cannot come without the pain and on the days I feel [Music] defeated God takes me back to one day long ago that's when mercy called my name that's when love broke Every Chain when his blood covered my sin and my life began changing [Music] and Grace became amazing when hope was lost my soul was found when my strength was running out that's when mercy Call My Name that When Love broke Every Chain when his blood covered my sin and my life began [Music] changing and Grace became amazing [Applause] [Music] amen amen thank you Lord if I could sing like him I wouldn't be preaching amen we're so grateful for God's grace this morning if you we let's go ahead and go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we we're meeting once again father to come around your word Lord so many different people spirits everything that's gathered here this morning Lord we've got some that's come here to just see somebody else we've got those that have come just to criticize this that that song that song leader whatever but we also have a bride that's come this morning Lord they've entered into worship they've entered into praise Lord and they've invited you this morning Lord because we feel that you're here Lord if you see anything in me Lord that you would possibly somehow call a gift Lord I pray that you would put it together as best as you can Lord because I know I can't but Lord we're trusting in you father this is your time so we ask that you would have your way bless those that have gathered here this morning father I pray that you would touch every need every prayer request that was read Lord we're so thankful for the testimony of our sister being healed of their migraines Lord you're still a healing God you're still in the healing business Lord and you're still calling out a bride so we ask you this morning to meet with us get me out of the way get them out of the way Lord and have your way we're so grateful for you in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles we turn real quick read two quick scriptures in Revelation 12 we're going to read 9- 11 and then we'll read John 8 7-1 11 John says here the Great Dragon was cast out and the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out unto the earth and the Angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death if you can go to John chapter 8 and so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her as you familiar with the scripture the Pharisees and the the the real religious people of that day had brought this the woman found in adultery as we read the scripture she's not denying anything she didn't say I wasn't the scripture said she doesn't say she wasn't so then in their in their in their Pious attitude and their self-righteousness they're going to Stone her and Jesus says you he that is with out sin cast the first stone I think that's a big lesson we should all learn this morning he that is without fault he that is without mistakes failures you Stone those around you throw it throw your stone if you are without sin without fault without failures without mistakes start chunking them and again he stooped down and rode on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience God did not convict them I want you to understand that God was not in these people their conscience convicted them it went out one by one being in the eldest even until the last and Jesus was left alone in the woman standing in the midst when Jesus lifted up himself and saw no one but the woman Jesus got lower than she was he had to lift himself back up to talk to her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee how could she say no man when they had drugg her into the city condemning her how can she say no man she had a revelation of who he was that he could take it away all condemnation she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more you could be seated I've had this stop for several months now and it's I've titled who are your accusers and now you're going to notice true to the way I am halfway through this I'm going to take a right angle and it's going to look like I'm going totally off of what the subject is and I am but I'll tie it back in so I won't be lost I was studying this last night and I was typing it things were coming and I was just typing it and I got to looking at it and I was like I'm totally way off the thought I was on but it will tie together I promise you that so if you'll bear with me but looking at this in Revelations when when it says they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony the word of their testimony is what what you test ify if you walk around testifying that Satan's beating you down he's made me do this I'm doing that I've got this besetting sin in my life and that's your testimony that is your testimony and how you overcome him is is not just you say well I trust in God that you know God's going to take care of you know you've got a job to do you why do you think in in in in the scriptures in Ephesians it tells you what you're armed with you've put on the the the breast of of Salvation and the the helmet in the sword of the of the word and all that and you're armed that means you got to do something yeah so in John tells them they overcome by the word of their testimony so what are the words that are coming out of your mouth when you feel defeated when you make a mistake when you you fall down and you stumble around and you you you get so convicted in your heart you feel condemned at that point what is your testimony yeah come on because when you testify what Satan Satan is doing to you what the enemy is doing to you you're giving him Victory you are not overcoming and and we read the scripture to me when I wrote down beside that when they overcome by the word of their testimony by the blood of the lamb and they love not their lives and I wrote John I mean James 4:7 submit yourself unto God resist the devil and'll flee from you how do you resist him by your testimony yeah yeah and then looking down here where Jesus goes and they all leave he says you know you without sin cast the first stone and it came down to it it was just her and Jesus nobody else that should all be all that matters in your life it shouldn't matter who's accusing you of this who's talking about the mistakes in your life who's saying the things that you've done and spreading it around the church and spreading it around your work the the things that you're that you are how you are whatever you and you worry about these people standing around you with stones they're always going to be there people will stones will always be in your life but she had an attorney that come up to her the attorney this was her courtroom they were condemning her this was a trial in fact they had already reached the Judgment they were getting ready to pull the lever on the electric chair and her attorney walked in and got a stay of execution that's what happened to you when when when Adam fell in the garden you became a prisoner you were lost you were there was no hope believe it or not you say I'm a Child of God always was in the mind of God yes you were but you had to be redeemed to get there you had there had to be a Redemption take place but you got to understand when Adam fell Satan went to work brother brandham said you became his property you became his property he owned you and his job is to continuously accuse you day and night yes sir the word accuser when you read the in this in the the New Testament there the accuser that is the that is the the term that the rabbis the Jewish rabbis of that day gave to Satan was the accuser you couldn't help the way you were born you were born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies yeah you couldn't help the way you were made and and when you're accused of things you you got to look at it and you say yeah I did do that your father before you did that his father before him did that generation after generation if we looked at the flesh if we look at where we were at after the fall we would have to say Not Looking Through The Eyes Of God but we would have to say I did do that I'm forever lost I'm going to the judgment you understand and I got this studying this and because as you know I I teach criminal justice and I like looking at law and we we do a lot of theory stuff I'm not intelligent but I did it for so long I understand some of it and they have what they call a differential association theory does anybody know what that is okay a child will become a criminal because his father was a criminal because his father was a criminal because his father was a criminal if you go to places like Washington Park on south side of Chicago my dad can tell you a bunch about that side of Chicago it's so much worse now than it was then violent crime in in Washington Park is 71% more than the national rate oh cops don't even go in there it's the wrong jungle I saw a video on YouTube about a year or two ago and this person's sitting on another part of town and he's got his camera up and he's pointing it over toward Washington Park in Southside Chicago and it sounds like the 4th of July just gunfire every night gang wars but ever so often somebody makes it out somebody says I I don't want to live like that it's rare but ever so often somebody breaks this Theory Satan tells you you have a differential association theory you'll fall like your father Adam on he wasn't deceived right but you'll fall like he he did look at the mistakes so and so made they were in the same situation you'll make them same mistakes and he gets over and over in your mind that you have this Theory and this is what is running running your life this is what's moving you you know Brother brandom Talks so much about how the natural type the spiritual you know and I get students that come in and my my first day of class I walked in there when I took the job two years ago over at tat and there's this young man sitting there and always ask him why do you want to get in law enforcement why do you want to do corrections and this young man he's sitting there and he tells me where he lives and I'm kind of familiar with the plac it's over in Solomon County near Bristol and he says I said why do you want to get in law enforcement he lived in a trailer park over there and he said I was so used watching cops come in and get my mom my aunts my dad instead of hating the cops he said I want to be like them his whole family generation I had a boy graduated him this past last year this past spring he's been in he got hired over at Carter County um Sheriff's Department it's been there about six or eight months I've arrested his granddaddy chased his dad granddaddy across state lines arrested his daddy for car theft arrested his mom on numerous his mom has been arrested so many times this month that young man became the top correctional officer in the whole state of Tennessee wow because he refused differential association theory I say that to say this to you just because you see somebody go down a path your family member you see this one fall away that one Fall Away you don't have to go that way Satan's telling you he's accusing you saying you're going to go this way you're going to do this cuz look at them they tried the same thing that you tried and it didn't work for them just remember he has a job to do the Bible says day and night even after the blood was shed for you he still the accuser of the Brethren he's not the accuser of the outcast right on he's accuser of the Brethren he's accuser and of Sons and Daughters of God so if that's you except the fact that he's got a job to do he's going to be accusing you that's his job yes it's not going to change until you take a Rapture until he's chained for a thousand years that job of his is not going to change yours can by the word of your testimony amen you don't have to say you know what he's right because so and so did this and I've tried it this way I've been fighting this thing for four years for for for 10 years this besetting sin in my life I can't get over it I can't I can't I can't I used to tell my boys I don't want to ever hear that come out of your mouth I can't I was at the police academy we got an obstacle course and the very last thing is the 8 foot wall I had this little fell he was probably 5859 he was a little heavy and he finished the course he got to the wall and there's there's a board there for you get your foot and go over and he just grabbed the top and just feebly tried to pull himself up I said go back again I said you can't you a leave until you get over the wall yes brother Rob I think I could have got over the wall I know what you're thinking I did get over the wall but I was younger but he kept trying and trying and finally he come around he goes I can't this is a guy that's going to work law enforcement in your community Community I said you can't I said you ain't leaving till you get over the wall guess what he did he got all over the wall yes and I told him I said I don't want to ever hear that word come out of your mouth again I will make you run 10 laps around this whole obstacle course if you ever say I can't again you can do more than you realize what you can do you're listening to things up here in your mind say that you can't and studying this it it just came to me you know the the things that we get we we've heard for years you know the bride's going through a judgment now we're not going through the great white Throne judgment because because we're being judged now you've already been judged God cannot pardon you write your name in the Lamb's Book of Life until you've been properly judged yeah am you think you get up in the morning God says okay I'm going to watch him today make sure he don't make no mistakes I'm watching him I'm judging him right now when that blood was shed your case was over yes your court case was over when the blood was shed he wrote his name brother brandom said his name in blood on your pardon that's right you've already been judged in fact you've already been given eternal life amen thank you Lord amen if you want to keep living under the law that's up to you but God gave Grace we're going to we're going to look at that here in a minute but you you've already been judged yes the the word you you know the the word is sharper than a two-edged sword and there's things in our hearts in our lives you know when brother brandom said you know when he went behind that door when God pulled him behind that door in that Diner when he was accusing that um that woman and that police officer just you know judging them and he comes in behind that door and he shows him Jesus up there and is hitting him Jesus being a buffer for him he says are those the sins of the world and he said no those are yours but God never saw him because God Jesus stood between him and God that's what the blood was for right brother brandham said after the blood you've accepted the blood your sins going into the blood says you've never done it God looks at you perfect white and clean amen let's move on here brother brandom said in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride both the heavens and earth now is contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God Jesus is there to intercede for us while the accusers keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers he came to redeem that elected that he he foresaw that's why it's so filthy today in the fourth seal as long as the intercessor is still on the throne Satan can stand there and accuse because he is the attorney for the other side he's the district attorney he's the prosecuting attorney he's the one that brings charges to you he said Christ he is the opponent of Christ he's standing there the opponent is stand there saying but wait Adam fell Adam done this I conquered him I got his wife to believe a lie and you said she would be damned by it I got it Satan's already doing his Victory lap saying I've already won I I made him fall I deceived his wife I made Adam fall now everything belongs to me so he's already thinking he's already won the case but there's a mediator standing there amen the kingsman kinsman redeemer stand there with the blood that can take the vile a sinner heart and change it the mediator is on the throne yes sir Satan said but they're guilty he could say they're not When God says you're not guilty the case is over a judge you ever heard of Double Jeopardy you cannot be tried for a crime that you've already been been tried with before in court you can't say we found new evidence if the judge says you're not guilty dismisses the case they can bring all the evidence they want it's double jeopardy you don't ask believe me ask brother the Matthew you can't you might even find video evidence you've ever been you've already been found not guilty right so what I've been building up to now is kind of putting you in a courtroom you know what we got to understand and this is something they stress nowadays and you hear it all the time is our rights we have rights the bride has rights American citizens have rights undocumented illegals have rights transgenders have rights homosexuals have rights everybody has rights yeah I think the bugs have rights everybody has rights but we we we hear the preaching so long we've been hear hear the the series that brother Donnie's been doing on the bride rights and I think it's so wonderful and and you if you look at the way he's preaching the rights you go read the the Bill of Rights and the Amendments all the way up the 27 Amendments and you start looking at that and realize how much parallels with the rights that he's been preaching to you and your rights as American CI you got people nowadays more concerned about their their rights as American citizen than they are about uh their rights as a bride this your rights as a bride should be more important to you than your constit tional rights I'm not saying that you won't that you can violate somebody else's rights but you have these rights that God gave you that Satan tries to violate day in and day out and sometimes I think we fail to understand what our rights are brother Bram said if we'd stayed where our forefathers planted the foundation we'd have built upon the principles of the Bible yes handwriting on the wall forefathers talking about George Washington James Madison and all those if we'd have built if we'd have stayed there we'd have built upon the principles of the Bible so we're going to look at some things today brother brother Bram says tested Faith produces goods in 58 here's where our forefathers landed for this freedom of religion on Plymouth Rock it is from these sacred Souls here that praying men and women went forth to establish this great spiritual economy that we are PR to serve today no American should be ashamed of their forefathers who landed in this country went to church packing guns who came here for freedom of religion went on Horseback covered in Old wagons fought the Indians and so forth to get to go to church those Bloods bathed this soil if we'll be sincere and believe in God that they believed in and serve him with the same reverence they served him with we'll see a Revival again yeah and I believe it will start in New England God's willing to do it if we'll carry it out what did they believe in we can take a history lesson this morning right brother Pete gave us one and that was absolutely wonderful and I probably don't know American history like brother Pete does but I know a little around the because I teach the Constitutional stuff but you understand in in people get confused think the Constitution was was signed in 1776 and it wasn't that was Declaration of Independence and if you look at the similarities you know I don't want to say types because people think you know you're taking the place of the Prophet or something if you say this type that and type I I won't say that I the similarities when you look at how the forefathers your forefathers that come to this country they they came away from a evil King they had a fight they come into a new land that was given to them God Was preparing it for you God Was preparing this land for a prophet to come in your day somebody had to come somebody had to fight for the land yeah and so the these guys come over and I like to look at the the similarities between between the old test and and the children of Israel coming out of Egypt how they had to they left a king that wanted to oppress them they wouldn't let him serve the god that they wanted to serve and they come to a land they had to fight for that land and then they wrote laws they get out in the wilderness and God gives Moses the law you understand the Constitution the way the Constitution was written it was all law Bill of Rights did not come till later it was law if you go read the first three articles it's the same thing is it was in in the Old Testament it was law it was judge and judgment that's what it was there was when they had the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in May through September 1787 and when they finished the Constitution they got it colonel George Mason from Virginia looked at it and says I would rather cut off my right hand than to sign that paper because there is no Grace there was no rights given to the people and you had go Christ come and looked at the law and says there's no Grace yeah there is no Grace there I was telling brother Robin other day how much I when I read the Constitution and read the how it came to be it makes me think of the Old Testament there was it was all law it was you had to live this way you had to do this do do this and if they accuse you of something they just threw you in jail they threw you in a dungeon and when you when you look at it and you you see how how Satan does the same thing you you're not Ling by the law in the Jes Jesus Jesus came and when the old the New Testament comes and he he sheds his blood he didn't just cut off his hand he said I'll give my whole life yeah so that we don't have to just live by law we have to have [Music] Grace 1 Timothy 1 ver8 but we know that the law is good and if a man use it lawfully knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the Lawless and dis disobedient for the ungodly and for Sinners the Unholy the profane that was me and you that's what the law was for and before the blood was shed that's what you had to live by that was you that was law you you Wen you weren't the righteous man you weren't the righteous woman you you're you're not the one that said God says well we don't need a law because these people are perfect you were the profane you were the sinful you were the ungodly but God knew you couldn't live by the law that's I said before you imagine if we still had to go by sacrifices we wouldn't have room for houses for all the herds right if we had to sacrifice something for every sin that we done we wouldn't have enough animals we'd be sacrific the stuff all day yeah but for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound Doctrine God always had a law look at the high priest these were the most revered men in in in the Bible in the Old Testament but God had a law you had to dress a certain way you had to smell a certain way you had to bring a certain smelling savior into him an incense you had to wear a certain color you had to make a certain sound yes and if you didn't you died right that was God's law amen if you if you did things on on the on the Sabbath or if you if you did looked on someone unclean or or many things that they did if you ate of this meat if you sacrificed the wrong wrong sacrifice God could kill you that was the law and God's always had a law you know when Grace came Grace didn't take away the law the law was still there the law is still there amen Grace didn't say the interpretation of some people now now it's Grace I can do whatever I want there's no it took away the law it did not take away the law God married them together the grace and law became married when you look at Adam and Eve God had a law God said on that day you eat that day that day you die they died that day you realize the lamb that God killed and clothed them in was not to cover the place of their sin it was to cover their shame God didn't say okay you can continue to live I'll kill this lamb in your place and you can go ahead and go on living they died that day they no man no longer lived a thousand years amen we're getting somewhere I'm kind of slow right now but we'll get there without the grace of God Satan could accuse you of anything before the Throne of God and he still does in Hebrews 12 and 18 I'm going read here a little bit and then we'll we'll get into something for you are not come to the Mount this is God's law this is him him telling you couldn't touch the mountain Mount s siia you were now coming not come into the mount that might be touched that burned with fire nor into Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of the trumpet in the voice of The Words which voice they that heard and treated the word should not be spoken for for them anymore for they could not endure that was which was commanded they couldn't endure the law and if so much a beast touched the mountain it it was stoned or thrust through the dart it was so terrible a sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but you are come unto Mount Si and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem into an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly I want you to understand what where we're going with this to the general assembly the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to God the judge of all the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of the sprinkling that speak better things than that of Adam General Assembly we now have a courtroom God the judge he sits on the on the seat the spirit of just men made perfect a cloud of witness you are compassed with a cloud of witnesses these are your Witnesses Jesus the mediator he is your defense attorney to the blood of the sprinkling this is your pardon yes when you look at the setting and you read down in verse 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear brother brandom said in the breach he comes forth to take his claims now comes forth to take his claims he has done the Kinsman work he has come down become man died he done the Kinsman work of redemption he had not as yet called for his claim now he comes to the scene to claim his Rights Watch what takes place for which he was slain for becoming a Kinsman to men to die in his place to redeem him but the Elder was right when he was a lion the Elder called him a lion called him and said a lion because he had been a lamb intercessor bloody lamb now he's coming forth as a lion his days of intercession is over seven horns was the seven churches the seven Church ages that was the Lamb's protection when he protected his rights on Earth with a god-sent group of people that you that protected see the Horn of the Lamb he claimed those rights and is the the God sent people that horn that was on the lamb you protect those rights those are your rights to protect are you using them are you accessing your rights It All Belongs to You overcoming power Deliverance healing yeah this is all that he whenever he did the intercessory work this is all that he claimed and he gave to you as your rights many men died in this country so that you can have rights a man died that you could have rights as a bride so what I want to do for a little bit if you'll bear with me is I want to look at a few of our rights in the Constitution and kind of look how they kind of are similar to the rights as a bride the First Amendment the freedom of religion you have the right to believe and worship however you wish in your country that's a great Freedom especially nowadays when they're trying to take it from you they're going to eventually work on they're not eventually they're wanting to form a ecumenical council a World Council of churches that says you have to worship this one way we'll see how much they they believe in this very first right that wrote in the constit amen as a bride your right your freedom of religion as a bride you have access to the throne of God yes you can worship God anytime any place anywhere you want to day or night you have been allowed into the holiest of holies right Hallelujah that is your freedom of religion freedom to petition is also in the First Amendment you have the right as a citizen of America to petition the leaders of your state of your community of your country with any grievances or anything that you have you have the right to petition as a bride you have access to the father for any petition that you may have need of any healing that you have need of any Deliverance that you have need of you can go directly to him and petition the father thank you Lord the right to assemble together that is your right to come in and freely in any church Cathedral synagogue mosque that you choose to go in and partake yes sir that is your right amen as the bride forsake not yourself to assemble yourselves together as you see the day approaching where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst that is your right the freedom of speech freedom of speech is right to articulate opinions ideas without interference as a bride there's a right to speak your true feeling desire and needs to God without any interference from hell you have direct access to the father oneway two-way communication you can speak to him without interference and he can speak to you without interference the Second Amendment how many knows what the Second Amendment is right to bear arms you'll see it on a few bumper stickers around here right brother William the right to bear arms the Bride 2 Corinthians 10:44 and 5 for the weapons of our war Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God pulling down strongholds casting down imagination everything High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God bringing to captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ you are armed in Ephesians you've been armed with the the the armor of God huah you have weapons and it is your right to keep and bear those weapons don't let don't let Satan tell you that you're not armed right don't let Satan tell you that you can't use this word this is for preachers only this is for the pastor only this is your weapon and you you have the right to bear it yeah to carry it with you right in here the third amendment I like this one anybody know what the third amendment is I know some do no quartering of soldiers you don't have to let the enemy stay in your house there the Revolutionary War when during the the 1770s and and so on during that time when the Red Coach would come over the British soldiers they would go into the Colonials house and just stay move them to the barn kick them out of the house many times take their food anything they wanted sometimes we let Satan do that to us we let him squat on our land and you have the right that says you don't have to quarter him you don't have to to let him live in your house you don't have to let him eat your food you don't have to let him take your joy but we get to the point we settle okay you can stay here but you got to stay over there we do the same thing to Christ that's who you should be letting live with you and have access to your whole house that's right everything you own but now you're letting the devil come in the enemy soldiers coming in oh he squatted his cancer right in there oh he squatted his depression right in there his anxiety financial difficulties in your life spiritual battles that you're fighting you let him squat right in the living room and your rights God says your rights is you don't have to quarter him you can close the door in his face and say you're not welcome here that's your right amen amen thank you Fourth Amendment we're going to get into brother Matthew's territory here right against unlawful search and seizure so what was happening was the Red Coach would come in and they would say we're looking for so and so or we're looking if you have guns or ammo or or gold or whatever and they would come and search your house that was nothing you could do by to kick the door in come and search through everything and they come up with this this amendment Fourth Amendment I've had to deal with this a lot of time on cases I worked Auto burglaries and and a lot of times I'd have to go search houses or cars and if I didn't get consent I would have to go do a search warrant because of the Fourth Amendment yes so Satan likes to come in and search your house he likes to trick you say I want to I want to come in and just I'm looking for let me tell you trick you I'll type it with it the the the natural leave you with a little food for thought so I teach in my class I tell my class I said listen so you got a warrant for so and so and you you go in this house and and you've got actual warrant that you can go in and look for this person and you're searching around and you go into the kitchen and you see a Bread Box you see a bread box and you open that bread box and you see four kilos of cocaine can you charge them with that how many believes you can you can't you can't charge you with that because a person can't fit in a bread box and you was looking for a person and Satan tricks you so many times tells you I'm coming in looking for this and then he'll find something else in your life that you didn't even know now you started a whole new battle over again he tries to seize your joy he tries to seize your sons and daughters your wives your husbands yes sir he tries to take them from you he enters unlawfully and takes the possessions that God gave you your peace your joy your comfort your healing and it's not his to take good the Fifth Amendment I call this the grace Amendment because it's the fifth this one give somebody to represent you that was God's grace to you you now have somebody to take your place because you couldn't the Fifth Amendment gives you the right to counsel you have the right to somebody to represent you as counsel it's called do counsel you have the right to do process without the Bloodshed without Christ you didn't have one right you didn't have an attorney that come in and say I'll take care of this for you I'll speak on your behalf but God says this is the grace Amendment for you you keep your mouth shut uhhuh yeah how many has ever heard plead the fifth do not self-incriminate if we would keep our mouth shut we would overcome a whole lot more of course the word of Our Testimony sometimes we don't we don't want to talk about Revelations we don't want to be the word of Our Testimony we want to be the word of the negative I've got this and other you'd be better off keep your mouth shut when you get an attorney your attorney tells you you shut your mouth yeah don't you talk I'm not putting you on the stand we we we've had to we arrest guys in there I want to take the stand you don't understand what kind of mess you're getting into if you're the defendant you want to take the stand you're opening a whole new can of worms so you have an attorney that says Don't incriminate yourself let me talk for you that's what Christ says to you I I'll go to the father for you yeah come on now I'll take care of this I'll shed my blood for you that's my job that's good the six a minute we're getting back around to where we was the right to face your accuser anyone brings an accusation against you you have the right to face them in a court of law the right to have witness on your behalf and the right to a speedy trial your counselor faced your accuser so you wouldn't have to he was also your witness your trial was so quick it was over before the foundation of the world you talk about a speedy trial in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he said I'll show you a speedy trial before the foundation of the world your trial was over you've already been judged found not guilty pardon and prom a better Dwelling Place brother brandham says in the church ages in 54 this is when he preached it the first time brass is always judgment you know the Brazen Altar and the brass serpent so forth brass speaks of judgment his feet then the Church of Jesus Christ is set upon Divine judgment Christ dying in herstead the just one paying for our judgment up there before God and died there as a sinner on the cross his soul ascended into hell and God not suffering his holy one to see corruption raised him up on the third day for our justification that's the one that took your place prise the Lord so now we we'll look at what happens if just say you're brought to court today If today was your court day and and Satan says I'm bringing so and so to court brother so and so sister so and so to court and I'm accusing them of this and we're going to have a court trial brother Matthew if I M this up you fix it for me later so before there could be a a charge brought to you there has to be an accusation you have to be accused of something and then they come arrest you and then they and they lock you up and they set you a court date and on your very first court date they have what they call an arraignment and here you are [Music] and you stand before the judge and the very first thing the judge asks you do you know what your rights are and the judges around here whether you know what your rights are or not he'll they'll read them to you do you know your rights and he tells you what you right then he tells you do you know what you're being accused of do you do you know what's being brought against you what your charges are and then he says can you afford an attorney if you can't afford one one will be appointed to represent you and trust me you can't afford one on the things that Satan accuses you of you can't afford attorney right on the things that he says that youve done and if you want to take your human mind and look back at everything you've done you've got no defense you've got no excuses you've got no argument for it and here you're St standing before a righteous judge just I want you to look at it for a minute without the blood you're standing before a judge without the blood of Christ in a courtroom how do you think that's going to end in for you how do you think it's going to end for you when you when when everything that you've done is brought across the screen as evidence and and the the the the prosecuting attorney says your honor I'd like to I'd like to present this evidence let me tell you about evidence evidence is your case it's very few times can you win a case just by proving the intent of somebody's mind it's so hard to do it's very hard to do evidence is what unless it's OJ OJ case totally different totally different but if your life wants to show before you and this puts all this evidence he brings a big screen up and he shows your life and everybody's looking at it and there's all these accusations against you you've got no defense so the judge judges around here an attorney can walk into the courtroom and the judge if I'm right brother Matthew a judge can say I want you to take this case he can pick any turn he wants I want you to take this case I'm I'm appointing you this case it just so happened one day on Calvary Christ walked into your life he said I want you to take this case you become the attorney you explain to him what his charges are you explaining what's waiting for him if he don't win you got no chance of winning so they have what they call the burden of proof so if you've been accused of something the burden of proof lies with the prosecuting attorney the prosecuting attorney has to prove that he accused you of something that you actually did and he has to provide proof of that I remember I was I had a case 2010 somewhere in there and I arrested this man and this woman for murdering their two-month old baby little Kaylee Atkins the thing that struck me was the power of the judge we presented this case with against one of the best attorneys Jim Bowman Matthew worked for him for a while wonderful man a great man outside the courtroom wonderful inter attorney but we presented so much evidence the evidence was overwhelming and we knew we had the case one and then when there all the evidence is presented closing statements are done the judge asked the defense attorney now I want you to put yourself in Christ at this defense attorney's table for a minute but judge judge cup looks at Mr Bowman and says counselor do you have any last statements Mr Bowman stands up and he says yes your honor I ask that you dismiss this case for lack of evidence I'd never seen that happen before and I looked at the da and I said can the Judge do that he said absolutely he can actually just sit there and say I haven't seen enough evidence and toss the whole case not guilty that didn't happen in our case but it showed the power you look at such a mighty powerful God that it growing up when you're a kid you know you get this image of God and what he is this big powerful God that if if you do something wrong he's going to strike you dead if you tell a lie the lightning is going to come down and strike you and that's that's what we picture Our God as until we get get a revelation of who he really is but he has the power but you had you you you had an attorney that could stand up no matter what the evidence was the burden of proof is on the prosecution and yet the defense says your honor we we ask that you dismiss this for lack of evidence and that's exactly what God did for you not guilty you haven't showed me enough Satan you haven't showed me anything I didn't see that right you you got to understand that the the prosecuting attorney's got his list of witnesses he's bringing all these Witnesses and do you realize he might bring somebody and your family subpoena them into court to witness against you who are his Witnesses look at the woman who were her her Witnesses against her they were going to be her they were her Witnesses against her they were her judges they were her judgment I want you to look the person beside you sometimes that's the witness against you silence do you realize now I'm not trying to step on toes when you talk about somebody when you bring up something that God forgave them of right you go pick up the phone and you call your daughter your best friend your daughter-in-law whoever it is your buddy you say you know do you hear about so and so did this you've become a witness for hell oh my you are on the prosecutions witness list you have put yourself there in studying this I don't know if I put it down here or not but brother brandom said whenever you start talking about people accusing people and backbiting you can't even call yourself a Christian yet and whether or not you like it you've entered into their courtroom yeah and you've pointed fingers and you sat in the witness box right beside the judge and you looked at the judge and said God they did this yeah that's what you're doing you've become a witness for the devil oh my remember that this is you are people that that your brothers and sisters here need to lean on for prayer for help and encouragement but instead we're armed with stones we've got people trying to take Rapture and we're standing with stones in our hands we've got people that want to get out of here and you're ready to Stone them you could you could you could tell me all you want brother Joe I would never do that I I would never do that and you probably wouldn't physically but that's what God hears oh Satan's got a new witness Satan's got a new witness got him on the stand brother BR said you're not even a Christian yet if you call up your friend to tell talk about somebody did this this brother did this and this sister did that get the Holy Ghost yeah you better find that attorney cuz you're going to need him in a little [Music] bit so moving on you you get the defense understands that the prosecution has all this evidence and we and the defense does what they call a motion for discovery that is the very first thing they do when you enter a court trial motion for discovery which means every little bit of evidence that you have you have to show it to me you can't keep nothing you have to say this is what I have the next thing that Christ did was filed a motion to suppress am I right so far brother Matthew a motion to suppress how many knows emotion to suppress is Paul have you figured that out yet he's going to law school emotion to suppress that's which means I am going to ask the judge to throw out everything that I found in Discovery so how does the Satan how does Satan gain the evidence on you I know you quiet that's fine so what what the defense attorney is going to say is your honor he's going to say well why should we suppress the evidence he's going to say your honor it's fruits of the poisonous tree how many knows what fruits of the poisonous tree is I know some of you do evidence that's obtained illegally hence comes the Fourth Amendment again if I was to go into somebody's house and start searching and I take things well I I know what this is this was stolen out of Auto burglary that I had a couple weeks ago searching the house I find this this is stuff that was from a robbery over at the pawn shop and I take that I take it no search warrant no consent no nothing I take it it's fruits of the poisonous tree you have to understand any evidence that is brought against you that is deemed fruits of the poisonous tree is thrown out it can't be used against you at all so Satan could say your honor I had a search warrant you understand who signs a search warrant the judge has to sign a search warrant and your judge says I would never put my name on a search warrant written by the devil right I'll never put my name so I know I didn't sign that so he had to get it illegally so God says now this fruits of the poisonous tree I'm putting it under the blood of calvary's tree Glory I can't see it no [Applause] more so when you got your attorney he knows what pro bono is brother Matthew is says I don't get paid when I do those yeah that's exactly what it is American Bar Association model rule 6.1 brother Matthews probably got this on his bumper sticker the state rule states that lawyers have a professional responsibility to provide legal services to those who can't pay you could not pay yes you couldn't pay amen it took a life it took a life to pay for your attorney a life so if you didn't get one it was going to cost you your life so God appointed you one it's a you got to understand and I'm I'm wrapping up you got to understand God every every case that that Christ has taken has been pro bono it cost him way more than it cost you yeah you know there there's people that get acquitted or or found not guilty y with a a pro bow attorney and they might buy him a a gift card or something you know they might it might feel insignificant all all all your attorney wants is hey when the case is over come over the house a little bit when the case is over want to go grab a bite he'll never bring up your case when it's over he'll never ever ever ever bring up your case ever you understand it's he don't even remember it either when your case is over he don't remember it now you're just friends now you're just buddies now he just wants to sit down and fellowship with you can we give him that much yeah c can we give him the the the one that paid so much for you that took care of your case for you amen you know he he calls his Witnesses too there's there's such a thing in in in the in the courtroom in a court trial when the defense will ask for the rule what the rule is is everyone that has to witness or testify in this case has to leave the courtroom they have to leave they can't sit in there and listen to testimony anything that would sway their testimony but they have to leave we we've had many witnesses on our behalf in our time that have left brother Jim bab sister Erica brother Daniel Nunley sister Sharon Ward they they've had to leave sister na me daily they've left but the scripture says we are incompass we are compassed about with a cloud of witnesses these are your Witnesses they're the ones that witness on your behalf and they're also telling you you can make it I am a witness is that what your reward when you win this case this is what your reward is we've seen it there's always a witness on your behalf there's more for you than is against you let's Stand Together Hebrews 12:1 wherefore sing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses lay aside every weight lay everything aside that Satan says is accusing you because it's dragging you down lay it aside and the sin which so easy easily beset us and let us run with patience the grace that has set before us your defense attorney called a a witness to your behalf called Mercy thousands of years maybe millions of years grace and mercy have been behind the veil hiding behind the veil Mercy is wanting to to speak on your behalf so bad it's pushed up against that Veil so tight but the veil wouldn't give Mercy screaming out to get to you I I want to get them I want to be a part of them I I want to help them through this for thousands and thousands of years Mercy was behind this Veil yeah then one day he was called out the day you got appointed your attorney the vent was the the veil was written too and mercy ran to you with everything it had yeah Grace came to you with everything it had Lord those are the witnesses that the judge listens to judge don't listen to all this these these false accusers these false witnesses that come in and tell you that you you have cancer because you have depression it tells you everybody's talking about you behind your back you know sometimes you you think that people are talking behind you back and they really ain't that's right sometimes they're not Satan's telling you they are yeah that's when you you're listening to the W the evidence the witness that the devil brings against you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I know it it's chopped up again as it always is father but Lord I pray if there's some bits and pieces that you could put together for someone Lord someone that's going through so much father that Satan's brought this against them brought that against them Father and that's all they hear they don't they don't how to testify what you've done for them Father because they're so overwhelmed Lord I pray that you would touch their heart speak to them or Lord may they realize whenever Satan accuses them of something he has to accuse Christ because your word says that you took our place your Prophet said we took your place when you wrote your name the Lamb's Book of Life you wrote ours so anytime Satan brings the accusation accusation against the bride he's bringing it against the groom Lord I pray that you would touch the needs here Lord Lord May something been said that would touch a heart father Lord as little as it was I pray that you would we thank you for it Jesus name amen want sing something I stood in morning the judge turn my way it looks like you're guilty now what do you [Music] say I spoke up your honor I have have no defense That's Where Mercy won mercy walked in and pleaded my call to the stand God saing grace the blood was presented that covered my sin given when mercy won't de I stood there and wondered how this could be that someone so guilty had just been
