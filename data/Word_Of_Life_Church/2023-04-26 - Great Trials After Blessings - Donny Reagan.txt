watch The Sound he said well they're all both old better hurry up they're going to do it so we wish some congratulations may the Lord bless them and be with them Matthew chapter 3 verse 16. and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a Dev and lighting upon him and lower voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased chapter 4. verse 1. the very next scripture now after this happens they're at the river then when Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil wow and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered you mean after getting the Holy Ghost the very next thing is this listen to this and a sermon called Witnesses brother brannerman says isn't it strange how God leads his people very strange just as soon as Jesus was baptized he went into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil just as soon as Israel came out under the blood circumcised the Holy Spirit leading them in the form of a light right straight up to the Red Sea and their cornered mountains on one side desert on the other Pharaoh's Army coming and the Red Sea cutting them off God LED them right up to that place then he asked this question why to get Glory praise the Lord to get Glory then Moses prayed and God told him to step right on down toward the Red Sea holding his stick out in front of him as he walked the Red Sea moved from one side to the other right across the Red Sea why God's paths LED through listen at God's path LED through as soon as they came out there right into the Wilderness of sin strange God's past LED right through that great Temptation there when they murmured against God they went from there on and from one murmur to another from one trial to another wow anybody ever been there I'd like to speak to you tonight on this great trials after blessings great trials after blessings how many I'd like to be remembered tonight as we pray God bless you I hold your request in your heart there Heavenly Father we are so grateful to be here Lord and we've already sensed your presence for that we are so grateful Lord God I pray that you would help me to be able to get out of the way tonight Jesus apparently some of your children have some needs I've been studying all week even last week for what I saw tonight's service would be but this evening You Changed Me Lord so I know when you do that it's for a purpose so I pray we would be sensitive to the spirit of God minister to us tonight Lord not only the visible audience but the invisible that'll strain granted father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated I'll be the first to admit to you tonight that I sure don't always understand God's ways the way that he leads his people the way that he allows things to happen and things to come up in our lives and things to set us back really and things that will affect us sometimes in a in a very profound positive way and then on the other hand sometimes in a very negative way we scratch our heads as it were and we try to understand it and figure it out and I'm sure you're probably like I am you get to a place to where you think Anthony let me try to figure it out a cane God's way is just so far beyond our way and we read from this tonight in Matthew one of the most profound astounding events that had ever been recorded in the scripture when the father God comes down into his Humanity his word or we call it his son no doubt we are still feeling the reverberation of what happened that day on the river I wonder sometimes if we still comprehend all that was taking place in that one event and yet it was so miraculous so phenomenal so profound so wonderful so outstanding that you think an event like that the the results would be ongoing for weeks and weeks a person living on the after effects of such Glory now the Lord Jesus we believe he was both God and man is that right but we know as far as his Humanity he was not born God he was not born with the fullness of the godhead bodily in him he was a man but he was the word but remember God separated the anointing from the word so he was the word made flesh but so is a tree a tree is the word made bark and leaves and life an animal was the word made skin and hair and all of that so the Lord Jesus was Isaiah 7 14 Isaiah 9 6 Isaiah 35 3 many of those scriptures and he was the word but the father had not yet come in his body and here it happens and we see what a great thing that it was that John hearing this great sound and maybe telling him to lift up his eyes and when he does he sees this Pillar of Fire as it comes down and John hears the voice and this great great event happening on the Earth and you'd think that after this event happening surely the Lord Jesus would go into great healing campaigns wouldn't he go out and just be rejoicing of what had happened in his life he just received the fullness of the godhead bodily if you can take it this way because this is the way the prophet said it he just received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what happened after he received it all hell broke loose I just wonder sometimes after God goes to doing things for us and in our lives and he will allow things like this to happen to us and if he doesn't do it for a great reason and yet we look at it and think something must be wrong something I I must have missed God somehow and when I I got to thinking about this was my mind in the last week or so I've been thinking about the youth camp and thinking about all the hundreds of people that were there use and others that were there as well how many miracles happened and how many lives were touched and changed and affected by the power of God but I know I think kind of strange and weird sometimes but I was also wondering how many of those lives that were so impacted by the power of God I wonder how many of those young people went back home and went back to their church and their job and the the other adults that were there as well and since that week a couple of weeks ago they have had one battle after another after another and I began to think about our own young people that are sitting here tonight wandering in my mind for some of you that felt like you received the Holy Ghost and I wonder if some of you have been battling things in your mind well I must not have got him I messed up after I got back home and I I thought this would happen and that would happen and I began to look at this and realize that sometimes God lets it happen this way after he will do great things for us in our lives and then it's amazing that he doesn't give us a long term sometimes for us to be able to enjoy that tremendous blessing and before you know it when we it are able to receive this thing that God has done whether it's a new job for you or it's a new wife or you got a you know a child it's calm or whatever it is that just such a blessing to you and your home or something has happened and you know you've been waiting for it and longing for it and before you get to really go and enjoy that thing then Here Comes one trial at your Nether and one test after another and it seemed like that it just robs the joy of that Newfound blessing that God gave you in your life and you think Lord why would you let this happen but yet we see here in the life of the Lord Jesus that the Lord Jesus did not even have two hours he did not have from the day of his baptism until the next day or the next week now remember he lived his life on the earth as a man without the Holy Ghost so he lived as he was 8 9 10 then he becomes a teenager then he becomes in his early 20s and then middle 20s late 20s and then now it comes up to 30 years old and he's lived all these years on the earth as a human being without the fullness of the father in him and he gets the fullness of the father in him now we have no record that he shouted or jumped or anything like that we have no record that he's spoke in tongues when he got it but we know that he did speak in tongues later but we really don't have any record of the joy that the Lord Jesus must have felt of him God to be able to receive that of being able to even enjoy it before he goes into this tremendous trial that only only he would be the only one that would ever be able to face such a thing now it was not like he got to enjoy this baptism of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the father coming in him it was just like he went straight from that straight into this tremendous trial now I know we read in Matthew 4 and also Luke 4 and both of them catch this and they both phrase it a little bit differently but we know that there was these three great trials that the Lord Jesus faced and remember he did not face them as an actor that well I'll act like I'm being tempted no he was actually tempted Satan offered him the kingdoms of the world remember I preached it to you years ago a kingdom without a Calvary and the Lord Jesus as a man was tempted to take that easy way now think that he had just received the fullness of the father in him and yet he had hardly any time at all to enjoy whatever that that had brought to his life so he goes straight from there walks right out of the water I'm not talking about three days four days five days but he goes straight out of the water LED of the spirit and the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil I wonder how many here tonight's ever went from a great experience with God or a great blessing with God and it's just you go straight from that into a trial you think Lord what in the world is going on with me well you know you ought to take it in one way as a compliment because there must be something about you that's like the Lord Jesus now you know this does not happen to everyone that professes Christianity this does not happen to everyone who says they are a Believer everyone cannot handle this great caliber of tests and trials now you say oh I wish you didn't love me so much sometimes I understand that feeling yeah you find favor with God you go through trials and tests and sometimes you wish well I wish I didn't have so much favor with him but that's only The Human Side in reality I'm glad I've got favor in his eyes now I know that we tend to look at healing signs wonders Miracles and all of that and we believe every one of those things but to me there's more favor with God than just that because according to the words of the Lord Jesus there will be people that will stand there that day and no doubt there'll be preachers that will be in that group and they're saying we cast out devils in your name heal the sick in your name down this and that and the other and he'll look straight at him and say depart from me you worker of iniquity so just because people have Miracles and signs and wonders don't even mean they're the elect of God is that right but yet God does not cannot give these types of Trials to those that are not his own now notice again we'll read in Matthew chapter 17 verse 1. and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bring us them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them now I realize we're living in a day whenever the word trans t-r-a-n-s it's in our news media every day if you get a newspaper it's there if you get it or whatever news you've got on your phone trans this and trans that and trying something else well let me tell you what kind of trends that I believe in tonight okay because I do believe in certain Trends and this is one of them transfigured there is a another trans that I believe in and that is transformed amen now this other stuff where you go to a doctor and you were born a boy you were born a boy and when you come out of surgery you're automatically a girl I call that an abomination oh I know they put up a new billboard down on Milligan Highway they put up a new billboard this week down on the Milligan Highway and they're they're saying that uh queer is Holy trans is Holy go down to the whole list and say it is Holy that is an abomination in the eyes of God well praise the Lord but we do believe trans and what I say is all them people who say that need to meet God and be transformed praise the lord well that'll give us some trouble but that's all right what's new about that now notice what happened then the Lord Jesus was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be Earth I will let us make three Tabernacles one for Z one for Moses and one for Elias what a great time it must have been an awesome thing like you can imagine that here is Peter James and John they are seeing Moses and Elijah in glorified bodies they are standing there looking at the Lord Jesus and one moment he was Immortal and then they see something sweep over him and they see his visits changed on his face and he becomes white like light emanating out of his presence and Peter gets so torn up that he said oh my what a what a place let us build three Tabernacles let's make one for the law and one for the prophets and one for you now you know what this is it is emotion Peter is so emotional under this presence no doubt he'd never felt anything like it before in his life so Peter just gets so torn up and he gets so emotional but he says something totally contrary to what the father is going to say now you see this ought to be a warning to each of us that when the presence of God comes near that we want to worship and we want to respond but we want to make sure that our emotion does not lead us contrary to God's word is that right we know the spirit of God never does that it'll always be in decency in order of course and while he yet Spain now while Peter was yet talking God interrupted Peter why because what Peter had to say wasn't right well he got spanked Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and a voice out of the cloud notice a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased hear ye him it ain't time for Moses to talk it ain't time for Elijah to talk and it sure ain't time for you to talk Peter hold your peace what you're saying ain't right boy but listen to what Jesus has got to say now notice what a great thing this was and the presence of God up on the mountain and then you imagine the apostles as they were standing there and they see this thing as it gradually came on Jesus and no doubt the glory began to dissipate again and it Gloria glory of God was little by little by little began to leave him and Jesus may be staggering as a man and standing there and they had to kind of support him because this was leaving his flesh I'm sure that as a man that it made him weak because the woman's One Touch made him weak and the Shekinah Glory of God it tends to do that to human flesh and maybe Jesus was teetering a little bit and kind of coming at himself and didn't know what to say maybe stuttering a little as he talked and all the apostles were sold related they were so blessed by what they had seen not another mortal dumb Through Time had ever seen such a thing now what a glory that this was but I want you to notice later in this chapter now those of you that know the chronology of the Bible and the chronological order you know that this happened not too long before the Lord Jesus is going to be crucified so he goes from this great Glory he's going to Golden shortly after this to Mount Calvary but before Calvary ever comes notice was me in verse 22 and Matthew 17 and while they Abode in Galilee Jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry now they come straight from this Mountaintop experience of hearing the voice of God say this is my beloved Son and God said this is my son so here ye him well now Jesus this is what he says they are going to betray me I'm going to be so and I'm going to be killed well now the son is speaking and how did it make them feel it made them feel not just sorry but they were feeling such an extreme exceeding Sadness and Sorrow in the heart after such an experience well when you think that if the son is going to speak it would be you're healed and you're delivered and you're set free the son is going to speak about death and sorrow well you know he does us the same way sometimes sometimes he'll tell us well you're going to be healed and this is going to happen thus saith the Lord that's going to happen and then there's other times that he gives us encouraging scriptures and encouraging quotes which lets us know our healing is down the road maybe a waste it don't mean he's going to do it tomorrow now don't sit there and look at me like that don't discourage you it does me whenever I'm praying I told the Lord the other day I said Lord I need a word from you so bad I'm begging you give me a word God you know you know where I'm at you know Lord what I'm praying about you know I need a word from you so bad and you know what he said nothing I told him the next day the same thing you know what he said nothing I told him the same thing today you know what he said nothing to me but gave me this for you something and sir do you know my address you need to email you need my phone number so you can text me so I could just bypass me but he wanted you to hear this well maybe my words after you tonight right now so brother Daniel you so discouraged you're going to quit are you kidding me quit how could I quit something I never started in the first place well does that mean that now you've got a problem with God absolutely I have no problem with God I've got a problem with me I'm always a hindrance it ain't never been God I've been serving him all my life and I he ain't never been no problem it's always been me anybody else honest enough here tonight to say the same thing about yourself now notice how that whenever the Lord Jesus bringing this straight from this Mountaintop experience and the sun speaks and the sun brings a message of exceeding sadness and something that would bring them a heaviness of their heart I wonder how many of you young people that was at the camp down in Louisiana if any all had any trials and test and difficulties since you got back home and oh brother Jonathan ah Oh Brother John you're not even a young person you raised your hand well apparently these things are not respect to persons 18 and under anyone else any of you young people and you come back so fired up and now you're saying well Lord why in the world happened to me I'm like an old models here I can hardly stand still down to Camp what in the world is a matter of me I feel so draggy well maybe you're falling in the footsteps of the Lord Jesus but let me just encourage you tonight to tell you that I don't think the Lord wants our expectation to be high just for Louisiana Youth Camp and then we come back to our home church and well it's church as usual it's brother Donnie it's brother Daryl it's whoever it is no I believe our expectation ought to be through this Ruth when we come in here because he's the same God right here in Johnson City as he was in Dry Creek Louisiana is that right but we have to understand sometimes what's going on now notice how Luke relates this in Luke chapter 9 verse 37 Luke brings it this way that when Jesus comes off of the mountain the mount Transfiguration and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him and behold a man of the company cried out saying master I beseech thee look upon my son for his mine only child and Lois Spirit take us in he suddenly cross out and it tells him that he foam us again and bruising him hardly departed from him and I Basalt thy disciples to cast him out and they could not so hear the Lord Jesus now comes down from this great experience and Luke in his own way writes it a little bit different than the other authors do and he catches this so we could see seeing that after Jesus coming off of the mountain that he meets a disappointment and who's this disappointment with it's with the preachers that are following him so this man brings his boy to the message preachers and the message preachers of that day they pray for him and pray for him and who knows what they've done but they could not get this Spirit to leave him now here's the Lord Jesus after this great experience can you imagine how he must have felt as a man disappointment the disappointment of these men are the ones that's going to take the message on these are the men that I've given them power remember he had already given them excusing authority to cast out evil spirits but this one was a tough one this one was one that could not just be cast out by little feeling this one had to come by prayer and fasting now the Lord Jesus then is met with this I want you to notice how he addresses them I the salt thy disciples to cast them out and they could not Jesus answering and said oh faithless and perverse Generation Now can you imagine coming out of the glory of God and seeing the Lord Jesus in his future Kingdom what happened on the mount Transfiguration which they say was Tabor Mount Tabor whenever John and Peter and James saw that it was a pre-figure of what is going to be the onset of the kingdom of God that was the Lord Jesus the resurrected Son of God that was Moses the resurrected death that was Elijah those which are alive and changed that was Peter James and John three that were standing there not in glorified bodies there were the people at the bottom of the foot of the mountain a pre-figure of the coming Kingdom of the Son of God and yet he has to leave that glory and come out and address a people like this and a way of rebuke what a contrast so he leaves that kind of Glory of God and he has to address people and call them by these terms oh faithless and perverse generation what a grieving that must have been to the Lord Jesus how will I be with you you suffer you you come straight on the mountain out of the glory of God and he has to stand up there and rebuke the people and say how long am I even going to put up with you all you imagine them saying Lord have mercy what kind of preacher is this boy he must have got up on the wrong side of the bed no he'd ever it wasn't him on the wrong side of the bed it's them on the wrong side of faith and you see when God will have his servants to rebuke us that ain't because God dislikes us and it's not because they dislike us it's to shake us out of a faithless time that we're going through and to shake ourselves and realize these things are part of being a child of God and actually we prove our faithfulness to God when the trial hits us out to the blessing more so than we do when we're getting the blessing when it comes you see it's really easy all my you young people that was on you adults that was there and the anointing was so great and the miraculous was so great absolutely phenomenal oh my goodness I believe about anybody could live right in that atmosphere but that is not the way it works you're going to leave from there and you're going to go back to your home back to your school back to your job same way with any of you that God has moved for you and you're going to face things it's going to be so difficult it's like well what happened absolutely nothing you're in the footsteps of Jesus Christ we we sang the song to be like Jesus oh how long to be like him do we do we want to be like him like this or we just want signs wonders and miracles well praise the Lord now notice Oh my Jesus says how long shall I be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither notice again now down at verse 46 so we again come off of the mountain he has to deal with this faithless and perverse generation and then verse 46 then there arose a reasoning among them which of them shall be the greatest now no doubt this is preachers of course which of them should be the greatest can you imagine the Lord Jesus has just the day before stood in this glorified premature glorified condition and he's got to hear these guys arguing and fussing of which one of them is going to have the biggest church or the biggest Ministry or who streams them more or we have more live views than you do and we do this and that and the other how carnal and the Lord Jesus has to step out of the glory of God and come back down to the Earth to deal with this kind of stuff sort of like you coming out of the presence of God and having to go to school and having to go to work having to go to family members that sometimes don't believe what you believe or people that just wants to argue and fast and debate and you think my goodness what in the world is a matter of me don't sound like to me there's nothing matter with you it just sounds like you're going in the same way the Lord Jesus went I wish somebody would preach with me tonight so what are we going to do when we come to these times of verse 22 verse 46 what are we going to do we're going to say well I guess I didn't get nothing I guess I didn't get the Holy Ghost after all I went through the prayer line and I guess I didn't get one thing you're letting the devil talk to you right out of your Miracle you're letting the devil talk you right out of the blessing the god the brother Donnie God I got the Holy Ghost said can't and I made a mistake and I fell short of the glory of God Welcome to the Real World this is after count this is after Sunday morning this is after our dedication service this is after when the special speaker preaches and we say oh my oh glory to God oh I love special meetings I love special meat but don't you understand what makes special meetings special if we didn't have the special presence of God already here on Wednesday and Sunday before the special meetings they wouldn't be near special as they are so you see about our everyday walk with God our everyday pressing but brother Donnie sometimes I come to church and I don't feel like cropping my hands I understand sometimes I come to church and I just feel so down I understand so you say well I ain't going to clap my hands in okay so I'll make a deal with you sometimes I come to church I don't feel like preaching [Applause] so if I walk out and you're not saying amen and you're not crapping your hand does that mean the deal between me and you is as long as you're silent I don't have to preach as long as you're just sitting there looking at me then I'm going to sit down in this chair and look at you oh you don't like that kind of deal do you but how do you want me to be I'm going to stand up like this I've been having a hard time it's been mighty rough been going through a lot of tests if I went on that way for 15 minutes some of y'all be bawling your eyes out dear God your brother Dominic doggy style what are we going to do I'll tell you what we're gonna do we're gonna act like we got to Victory even sometimes when we don't we're going to praise him even when we don't feel like it we're going to sing with all of our hearts we're going to clap our hands we're going to worship amen but mother Donny you mean we even when we don't feel it especially when we don't feel it because it's a whole lot easier to jump up and down when the anointing is all over you it's a whole lot easier to say devil where are you at when the anointing is all over and your hair sticking up on the back of your neck it's another thing when you don't feel God nowhere it's another thing when it seemed like God's ten thousand miles from you and you still stand up to the Jonathan say you better back off devil cause I'm a Son of God when I feel it I'm a Son of God when I don't I've got Victory when I feel it I've got veteran when I don't amen I may be down good dealing in verse 22 I may be down here dealing in verse 46 but I am an overcomer well I'm in verse 1 or verse 5 or verse 22 or verse 46 I want to be an overcomer in ever verse I want to be an overcomer when I'm sick when I'm weary if I get down if I get blue I want to be able to stand and look that devil in the face and say dude devil [Applause] well John I want to ask you a question buddy did you feel kind of down the other night after you preached you think of that field down after you preach you do now I want you to think of that a man that's been preaching for decades of his life seemed great Miracles well these days you folks will realize how God uses our brother they don't go around telling everybody but it's phenomenal the things that God has done through it I'd rather give him Rose now than whenever they wrote them up here tonight to pre-children raise the Lord but does he always feel like it no he said how do you know because he's calling me before laying on the floor in the motel room on his back with his legs up on the bed like this crying and agony and pain brother Donnie I've got to go preach in a few minutes would you please pray for me I don't think I can do it but you know what he'd done he got up got dressed went mashed the Devil's Mouth oh God oh Hallelujah notice this other rows of reasoning among them which of them should be the greatest in Jesus perceiving the thought of the heart took a child and set him by him and he said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever receiveth me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great now as humbling these Apostles and John notices and John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him glory to God John the Beloved one of where he's beloved went then we forbade him because he didn't go to our church I hate that old stinking denominational thing because he followeth not us wow John John of all people John and Jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem look this happened all this great thing and that he's hit was one thing after another among who the Pharisees the scribes his followers you can expect infidels to do this you can expect heathens and unbelievers to do this but when believers do it preacher Apostles Peter James John oh how discouraging it must have been and he set his face to go to Jerusalem I sit in Messengers before his face and they went and entered into the village and they went notice other Samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him so you come straight from this mountain people don't understand Apostles fussing your Apostles can't cast out Devils now you're going to just going through this Village and they won't even receive you there I wonder how he must have felt to take this attitude now to the cross instead of having people standing there on the side oh Jesus die for me Jesus died for me go please I beg you please please I need it I need it instead they were laughing making fun ridiculing and not one of the Apostles except for John was even there with him to incur oh my goodness and then we complain about what we have to go through now notice what happens they wouldn't receive Jesus and when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord will thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them we've got a scripture for it even as Elias did glory to God I feel it ain't right our lord Jesus that way are you one you want us to do it well I hate to inform them but they couldn't have done it you know why their attitude was totally wrong we don't believe me listen what Jesus said but he turned and rebuked them and all of this happens after Mount Transfiguration but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit you are of you kind of reminds me of us sometimes and folks cross us we're ready to turn them into serpent seed bless God how could they be brought out you know what ain't none of us got no magnifying glass and we got the Holy Ghost to look down in people's soul and see if their seed or not let God do the sort and friends let's just live right and do what's right let God take care of all the rest of that stuff he's the only one that can anyway so what are we seeing that great trials can come after such wonderful wonderful phenomenal blessings and it's not that you're out of the will of God when you're going through it so when God brings the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ma they hardly get any time at all to be able to enjoy the blessings of God to enjoy their freedom they've been down there for 430 years they don't even have it a few days before the tasks start coming and you say God why would you do this why would you do this why not let us enjoy our Newfound Liberty why would you send us straight into trials Exodus 32 15 and Moses turned it went down from the mount now remember it's been up there receiving the law of God Erica sent me a little thing the other day and it said had a thing of Moses standing in there with the Ten Commandments in his hand and he said Moses was the first one to use a tablet foreign 's been messing up like crazy it was acting up back on the office before I come out Moses had one that wasn't made by iPad so Apple had nothing to do with it so it's pretty reliable I figured don't you written with a finger of God coming out of that and Moses face so shown that they had to put a veil over his face because he'd been with God so long he took on the very image of God oh Moses turned and went down from the mound and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides one on the one side and one on the other they written and the tables the work of God and the riding was the writing of God great and upon the tables when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto Moses there's a noise of war in the camp and he said it's not the voice of them to shout for Mastery neither is the voice of them to cry for being overcome it is the noise of them that sing do I hear now notice you come straight from the very presence of God and it came to pass as soon as it came down to the camp he saw oh my Lord the calf so you come straight from God's presence into your church and you see the people practicing idolatry worshiping a calf now you know there's a paradox about Moses I can't say that I understand the Bible says that Moses was the meekest man on the Earth that that old boy had a temper like a buzz saw I'm not sure how that goes together I've met a few people like that myself I know a few preachers like that actually and yet he was the meekest man that was on the Earth but still yet had a real temper now I want you to notice what this does to him it so bends him out of shape as we say that he came to pass as soon as he came down to the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and Moses anger walks hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and break them beneath the mountain I'm going to tell them at six months after he was up there we're not talking about three years we're talking about he comes straight from the Mountain of God and takes the journey down and he comes down and hears the noise and he sees the calf and just immediately out of the presence of God gets so upset and you know who did it it was not the oxen of the camp it was not the sheep of the camp natural sheep it was not camels it was not animals it was his people his people mom and he took the calf which they had made him burn it in the fire ground it to powder of course no doubt all this has been done in such meekness and humility now you imagine him just taking the powder the calf and just Oh Glory to God he set me free I imagine there's some slamming ones God said calm down Moses calm down you don't want to know that water to your boy he burned it with fire and grounded to powder and swallowed it upon the Water and made the children of Israel drank so you go straight from that to this in your church so this is your first service after you receive your tablet didn't even have time to preach on it since I'd like to read my text now from the first commandment and then tomorrow now we're starting a series I'm taking the 10 9 series and I'm going to call it the Ten Commandments well praise the Lord let me tell you some Charlton Heston couldn't have touched the original Moses I guarantee you that the man never even got to preach the first time remember the Harvey because the people were so far out of sync with God and it's so upset Moses coming straight where no man had ever walked not even Abraham's countenance was ever changed like Moses was lost after God speaks to his servant Abraham and brings him a great lamb of Deliverance on Mount Moriah the Lord God had worked a miracle and created a ram in the bushes what a great experience and the very next written verse about the life of Abraham is Sarah died so from Jehovah Jireh Mount Moriah my son lives you imagine coming off that mountain brother Paul running and skipping Hallelujah Praise Adonai praise Jehovah and the very next verse of scripture says and Sarah died don't you understand why real Christianity can be so perplexing to people why many will come and they will turn away they just cannot handle the extremes as everybody anybody ever been there three of you four five six seven eight left to where you get in the presence of God and it is so wonderful and you have such an awesome service or maybe an experience of God in your home or whatever it is and you go from that to some terrible terrible thing that has happened some horrible news and you think God how Elijah's we looked at him not long ago standing up on the mountain calling fire out of heaven killing 400 Prophets and the very next day running from the threat of one woman I cannot imagine the anointing that was on that man that he would be able to take some type of instrument of Slaughter and one man killed 400 false prophets in a setting oh yeah 400 of them and then the very next day run for his life like a coward I did under a juniper tree and asked God to kill him he didn't even want to live another day from one extreme to the other great trials that fall great blessings oh Lord Jesus after the birth of the church and great power and miracles were given acts 5 17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and we're filled with indignation sure they were anointed of the devil I laid the hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison Well Jack they don't even get to enjoy this new and feeling that they've had they do a miracle or two and automatically all this starts turning loose all hell breaks loose all around them look in chapter 12 verse 2 and King Herod of course is who this referencing and he killed James the brother of John with a sword and because he saw it please the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also then were the days of unleavened bread so they don't get to come to church and enjoy their new church they don't get to come and enjoy this brand new move that God has never done it doesn't hardly last no time till All Hell Comes against them and what did they do get discouraged and stay home get signed and stay home oh I just don't think it's worth it I just don't think it's worth all the hassle they're going through they kept right on preaching anyhow now I guarantee you one thing we probably wouldn't have near as many preachers in this message if we went back to the acts too and if there was a risk of every message preacher been thrown in jail every time he'd preached I figured we'd get down to the real ones either that would not be a few crazy ones left but I figured that our numbers would definitely be a lot thinner than what they are right now because you know that you can be thrown in jail and what did it do to these guys they kept right on preaching like there was no Herod they kept right on preaching because they were called by God to do so and somehow they understood by hearing the teaching of the Lord Jesus and had been quickened to him by the holy ghost that these things must happen after great blessings they just got the Holy Ghost they just got their life changed they just got filled with the father himself and they expected all hell to break loose young people let me encourage you tonight you got the holy ghost at the used Camp then just look for it the devil's going to come but keep this in mind you've got more to face him with us than you had pre-use cap you've got more on your sides you've got more living inside of you that will give you the ability well what am I supposed to do brother Donnie Kim right on pressing on you older people said in your tonight you're going through a hard time oh brother Donald the Lord's been so good to me and he just blessed me here a few weeks ago but this and that of the other and it seemed like all hell broke loose well that's exactly what I'm talking about tonight and what are you going to do you're going to keep right on pressing you're not letting the devil not gain one inch as a matter of fact we're going to take away from him because it is our rights it is our privileges as the Sons and Daughters of God so let me put hell on notice tonight devil Let My People Go Let My People Go you try to hold them with bondage of Oppression and sadness and whatever more in the name of the Lord Jesus we have been called of God to bring Deliverance to the people of God Satan ain't got no right to claim you and I tonight in the name of Jesus Shake him off Hallelujah Shake him off but I don't feel I could shake him off anyhow I don't fill out praise from the Lord Praise Him anyhow great trials after blessings you see this is the law that we're under right now the law of contrast but it ain't going to be very long I'm going to close the law of contrast or no longer be needed and will no longer be living under it and when the Law changes after we get great blessings they'll be even greater in store so when you've been there Ten Thousand Years bright shining as the sun you've no less days to sing God's praise than when you first begun do you understand it will take Eternity for him to continuously be unveiling himself to us you imagine for you think you're going to get bored In Heaven There is no way in the world we are ever going to get bored ain't nobody's going to say myself well what are we going to do today what are we going to do day birthday and where are we going to go what are we going to do my goodness we've been your 385 million 975 331 days aren't you getting a little bit bored what are we going to do he'll still be revealing himself if we could even measure time as far as millions of years it would go on he's still revealing himself and you're not tired you're not weary you're not going anywhere you ain't got no watch praise the Lord for that you ain't got no time clock to punch you ain't got no schedule to be there and to be somewhere else y'all ever feel like you're going 40 different directions at the same time and you're trying to keep up with everything we live in a stressful age did we not but don't worry children there's a Time coming well there won't be no stress in that land there ain't going to be no schedules for you to keep there ain't going to be no appointment that you got to go to praise the Lord there'll be doctors there but they just won't be practicing no more they'll be former dentists there but they won't be feeling nobody's teeth they'll be preachers of it that won't be making no other cause and they won't be laying hands on those sex because they have finally reached the spot till where blessings follow blessings and goodness follows goodness and the great things of God is followed by more great things of God the second oh Hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord oh don't you love him oh my how many can relate to what I'm talking about tonight you know the thing with his friends if we're not aware of such things Satan will try to convince us we've done something wrong oh we've missed the Lord somehow well if we have let's just fix it and go on if you've done something wrong if you fell short of the glory of God repent make the thing right and go on don't wallow in that thing and let it steal your victory for the rest of your life but a lot of times it's not even that we've done something wrong it's following the sequence of God's Divine elect they're the only ones that God can bring from this extreme others yes to Baby them look at what the Bible says there when the people of Israel come out there was a more direct way for them to have gone to the land of Canaan a much more direct way it had been a lot quicker the journey the miles would have been drastically cut off but the Bible says that God would not bring them that way because they would become discouraged because of War so God LED them the long way around but they thought the long way around was the wrong way now they didn't have GPS of course Global position system the way we do but there might have been some people that have been there before say hey I've been close this way before this Moses God's taking us 175 miles away out of the way I don't understand this do you I don't understand this at all don't make a lick of sense to me there's a more direct route then God said yeah there is one but if you go that way you'd be so discouraged in three or four days you wouldn't want to make no further Journey so God said believe me sometimes when I take you the long way around it's my grace to to you it's my grace to you it's my Mercy to you well we ask God to heal us and know this oh God you know please bring it God said no I think I'll go this way and say well Lord how come looks like there may have been a whole lot easier well when you get to where you can be God and look down on the earth say maybe he'll he'll help you to understand that but until we do until you become God I figure we better just stay down here on the earth and become his children and act what we aren't dumb and just say well Lord I'm trusting you I don't understand and I finally got to a place I didn't want to ask to no more I'm just going to believe and I pray God give me strengths give me strengths help me that I can be faithful help me that I can be true help me that I'll stand right there at the promise of God and the church said praise the Lord who's that for you oh wow thank you Jesus I was hoping I hadn't said all that for nothing now maybe he'll give me my word oh Jesus thank you for your mercy to his father thank you Lord for showing us how our journey leads sometimes I pray for every person that raised their hand Lord God they would be able to contemplate and think about what was said maybe you've got them in the long road and they can see across the river and they know if they could go this other way be a whole lot quicker most of us prefer Miracles over Divine Healing most of us prefer Lord that our pain has shortened our suffering is shortened what we go through is short Lord sometimes we know your way is so much different than ours but Lord God I pray that you would help us when we feel it we'll praise you when we don't feel it we're still going to praise you when we feel it and we're excited to go to church we're going to go and when we don't feel like going to church and when we're not so excited we're still going to come anyhow and we're not going to sit down with a big long mule looking face because we ain't mules but we're going to put forth our best effort we're going to sing we're going to clap our hands and worship you and praise you because tonight might be the very night that I praise myself right out of this Valley hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus we worship you tonight father I pray for your encouragement I pray for healing I pray for strengths for your people Lord no doubt the people are facing different things and going through different things you would have never had me to go this way or not for multiple reasons Lord so I pray that you would Minister to every heart tonight Lord Jesus we believe you're mindful of us I pray for your god-called ministry around the world Lord I know been in touch with many of around the world preachers fight so much Lord and there's such an onslaught of Hell against the churches all over the world one thing after another after another hitting them Lord I pray father or if Satan can discourage the pastors especially get them where they're weary and feel like they're just wasting their time and no matter what they preach people do whatever they want to do and all but Lord I pray for your men servants tonight father may you encourage every god-called pastor may your soul bless them Lord and lift their hands when they feel weary lift their Spirits father when they feel like they're wasting their life and wasting their time may your presence undergird them Lord God I pray for your evangelist on the field father I pray for every aspect of the ministry tonight Lord may you help them Lord Jesus father we
