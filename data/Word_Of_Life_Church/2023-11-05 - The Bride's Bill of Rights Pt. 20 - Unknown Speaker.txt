we just expecting see what the Lord will do for us certainly wish to thank you for your continued prayers for us uh during this time with Erica's graduation and homegoing we thank you for that thank you for all your nice cards and letters and emails and WhatsApp and text and so on and so on and so on and um cards that you've sent in the mail and we've got condolences from people around the world and we're so appreciative of that um I know that um we're certainly not the first ones to go through these sort of things but you know whenever it's you it certainly makes it real doesn't it I've buried over aund and something people since I've been here the years that I came here years ago but it's uh I believe we're getting one grave closer one to the last one praise the Lord let's turn today if you would to Luke chapter 21 verse verse 9 Luke 21:9 I'd like to speak to you again today on a life above ungodly fear a life above ungodly fear but when you shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things what's that next word must must these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by then said he unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquake shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and Great Signs fearful sights kind of makes me wonder when the prophets and even the Lord Jesus when they would say things like this what they must have been looking up and the Bible tells us of course you're in verse n seven and 8 and n as it goes to deal with all this that there will be fearful signs in the heavens I wonder what they would have seen I wonder what they would have thought if they would have seen the video that Carol and I saw last night it is an aircraft that has been made by our nation which has been around for many years it's called the B2 bomber spirit is what they call it B2 Spirit bomber so it's not like an F-15 Tom Cat an A10 warthog an F16 but this one is made altogether different it's a flying wing so it's shaped like a bat wing cannot be picked up on radar it can contain over 50,000 lbs of armament Conventional Weapons and also nuclear as I looked at that last night and I saw that that B2 there and I saw all of those missiles and all of those bombs nuclear and conventional laying in front of this one airplane enough to be able to paralyze the country of Iran was only one bomber I wonder what them prophets would have SED that have looked up in division in the night and would have saw this Wing come flying through that's so massive is that terrifying yeah to the human aspect it is but I'm glad today it don't scare me notice what Jesus goes on to say fearful sights and Great Signs shall there be from heaven so this word here actually means in heaven as well but Romans 8:15 Paul writes and says for ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption where C whereby we cry ABA father or father father or dear father how many loves him today and me like to be remembered as we pray God bless you hold your hand there your request in your heart Heavenly Father we love you today we're so grateful for this privilege today Jesus that we could be gathered once again in your house thank you for every person that's put forth the effort to come today we're just asking that you'd take the service and speak to us we have needs Lord you saw all these hands hundreds of them that went up signifying a desire a request a need maybe multiple ones Lord we believe that we can cast our cares on you for you care for us Lord you see this prayer call that I have in my hand you see this need Lord this young woman I'm praying God for your mercy in the name of Jesus would you move in this situation father we're asking today that your Supernatural presence would come once again may we be called up into the shakina glory of God may we be benefited by our gathering together today we have come to shake one another's hands we have we've come to see one another we have but more importantly we've come to hear from you we're needy Lord I need you this church need you those that are streaming today we each one need you and we believe will not leave you disappointed if we'll come with the right attitude and the right approach bless us today Father in the name of Jesus we pray and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I can imagine the year five a 6 as they begin to look out over the walls and they saw this Mighty buildup they saw catapults they saw thousands times thousands of soldiers they saw weapons maybe that they' never even seen before they saw captains generals battalions ranks of men foot soldiers and they saw it building little by little by little if you're not familiar with the time frame it's Jerusalem it's the prophecy of the Prophet Jeremiah when he said that God would send a mighty Army from the north and they would destroy Jerusalem it must have been that the people in Jerusalem still many of them were convinced God was going to move everything was going to be found oh he had moved many times before and the enemy had been laid waste and they were convinced by false prophets to not believe the word of Jeremiah now if you would have been living in that day and I would have been in that day wonder who we would have believed Jeremiah or hananiah would we have believed Jeremiah or the rest of those prophets which were prophet prophesying and running up and down the road and screaming and all just glory to God I feel the anointing all over me but they were saying the exact opposite of what Jeremiah said it's always been that way that God will have his true Prophet come and then there'll be somebody or many that will come and try to water it down and make it more acceptable make it more social and so on but yet the minority of the people believed what God Prophet had said this Siege is going to take quite some time months actually they will come to a spot to where that they will be such desperation and eventually Nebuchadnezzar will take over the city will be destroyed and as I mentioned to you the other day I saw a piece of a temp that had been buried in the dirt around Jerusalem and the residue which had been laying there since 586 BC think of that 586 BC and just a short time ago they dug it up and carbon 14 dated it and here was a part of the Timber that actually made the first temple the house of God now did God want to do that of course not was it God being a mean God that wanted to destroy that Temple it was the sins of the people that made God do it and no doubt there were people there that were totally convinced everything is going to be fine there was an element of them that become as it become closer and closer and zedi got closer to the end of it then he began to consult with the prophet but by the time he said okay okay okay I I agree I agree you know what this is overwhelming and maybe I've messed up I I I want you to intervene for us I want you you Prophet because prophets of the Old Testament were entering into a place of God's presence and God would actually hear their cry but this had come too far God actually said it would be a time that even if Daniel was there he wouldn't hear Daniel if Jeremiah prayed he wouldn't even hear Jeremiah I'm afraid our nation and our world is at the same place again but it as sad as it was as difficult as it was that is very mild compared to what lays before us in this day we're living because even in the time of Nebuchadnezzar he did not have the Armament or the ability or the Ingenuity to be able to annihilate the Earth the B2 Spirit Bomb that I just or plane that I just described to you has capabilities of carrying nuclear weapons that are 22 times more destructive than the fat boy that was dropped on hirosima man has reached a place to where he can annihilate himself man has reached the place to where that one nation after another has nuclear capability what should we do run to the rock that is bigger than we are I tell you a friend you'll never be able to have a bomb shelter or brother Donnie I'm ordering a concrete one I'm ordering a steel one do you understand the impact of those bombs will cause concussion so strong it will break every bone in the human body body you'll not be able to survive now I'm not really preaching this way for bride I'm preaching this way for those who going to be left behind now I wish I could stand here today and say that I I know beyond a shadow of a doubt everybody in our church will be in the Rapture but I don't know that I wish I could say that everybody in Johnson City in the surrounding areas will be hid on the rock of ah but Al last you see I cannot say that the only way that I know that we will be safe and secure is not on your daddy's religion or your mama's religion but you yourself know the Lord Jesus in such a real way that you have the token applied to your life and that way you can look at the hour that we're living in and somehow you can look at the Spirit Two Bomber and you say I'm not afraid of it you can look at the messenger which is the one that Russia has built was Hypersonic missiles faster than the speed of sound five times faster than the speed of sound bombs that can move so fast that our F-16 tomat our A10 warthog our F-15 Fighters many of the on that we have cannot even intercept them but you can look at that and read about it and think I'm Not Afraid now that would seem foolish I know but what if brother Donnie what if what if they sneak in that's exactly what they will do but you see the majority of the world is so convinced All America is this Mighty power I will say America was this this Mighty power but she ain't no more come on you Americans you might as well say Amen America used to be the very symbol of strength and the Very symbol of power but she's no longer that our enemies recognize that we are a nation that was a great Mighty power but now we are a weak Nation because we have weak leadership and we have weak pull pits and we have weak preachers in them P pits and we have weak Mamas and weak daddies in the homes there's only one hope and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus imagine that when the people began to notice the upbuilding of this Great Mighty power and they looked at and realized it was too late you can imagine in 70 AD whenever Titus begins to move his mighty Army and they gather once again around Jerusalem the Lord Jesus had said it some years ago oh harem harem how of I would have gathered you as a hen does gather her brood but now your house is left unto you desolate and he wept as he sat on the Mount of Olives and cried and the people laughed and made fun of him I wonder what they thought whenever they looked out there and there was Titus with his mighty Army again the great catapults again the great ability to devastate their city and then they would starve them out once more they would starve them to a place that the parents would eat one another's children they pull the bark off of the trees they pull the leaf off of the trees when people would die out of starvation they would actually fight over who got the corpse becoming cannibals I'm not talking about Russians I'm not talking about Hamas right I'm talking about staunch Jews that's right that said they believed Adonai but they had crucified that on night when he become flesh somebody say Amen but remember Jesus told some of them whenever you see this come you beware and there wasn't one of those elect that was caught inside that City they got out of there when the good times was that's when they left look friend it's very important where you are found when these times arise you don't want to be found in that stalk Church you don't want to be found in a compromising hybridized Church system when the life cycle moves around oh no wonder the prophet said that if your name is found in that stalk book lost you will be it's very important where you are caught when the Rapture comes I'll tell you where I want to be caught I want to be called under the Banner of our Lord Jesus Christ I want to be if I'm alive and well I want to be identified among the saints of God I want to be identified in a church that believes he's the same yesterday today and forever and still preaches the oldfashioned gospel of Jesus Christ anybody want to be identified there I want to be hid right there because where you are found when the trumpet sounds will dictate where you wind up not one child of God was found there you imagine it got to such a place that when Titus actually finally took it over and marked through and again they burnt the temple and Jesus said it I stood there a few years ago and saw one Mighty stone that was longer than from this pull pit Plum to the back wall one stone one stone and it was sh out oh my just massive you just can't even hardly comprehend how they could do such and then hewers of that stone would take their chisels and carve all the way around it a band that would be similar to a Roman Ochi those of you that understand what that is and how they was able to cut that out of solid Stone and they thought no doubt this will never fall and Jesus Jesus said there won't be one stone that'll be left upon another and they laid there for years and years as I stood there as one of the last phases of our visit in Jerusalem and the guide pointed out that they had just recently found it it was called Wilson's Arch and it was a bridge made out of solid stone that had been carved and it had laid under the rubble for 2,000 years and they just dug it out and it was an archway that take him from where the street market was and the sellers and the vendors and it would take him to the upper platform to where the temple was and I thought there it was it had laid there for all of those years bearing the record of the words of the Lord Jesus there won't be one stone left upon another and now they have to dig down feet I'm talking about this was laying under debris that was 50 and 60 ft deep of debris yet it was prophecy laying fulfill right down there oh my if God would so watch over his word in that day what about in our day but I ask you does God want us to live under Atomic fear the answer is no does God want us to live under the fear of the tribulation period absolutely not does he want us to move with haste the Bible says when God spoke to Noah that Noah moved with fear you know that the Bible says that Noah moved with fear I believe that we in the end time ought to move with fear but not an ungodly fear God don't want you serving him God don't want me serving him out of a fear that I'm afraid I'll go to hell or a fear that oh no oh no God's going to get me God is not looking for an excuse to punish you God is not looking for an excuse to punish me he went out of his way to save us he went out of his way to heal us he went out of his way to deliver us he does not want to punish us he wants to set us free he does not want us to be under a slavish fear but he wants us to be motivated by a fear all right a fear that we're afraid will displease him that's my fear that this morning I'm so afraid that I might miss his will somehow or I might not do how many understands what I'm saying I might miss him or I'm not going a direction that wouldn't please him but I do not believe he wants us to live under a fear of cancer I don't believe he wants us to live under a fear of failure some of you sitting right here today and some of you listen are constantly living under a fear of failure and you're afraid you'll mess up up and mess up you won't even try to sing you won't even try to do nothing for the kingdom of God so you're F so afraid of fear but what if I mess up what if I mess up I preach thousands of sermons I ain't never preached a perfect one I've sung thousands of songs I ain't never sung a perfect one nor has any other preacher or any other singer do you want me to wait till I preach the first perfect one or should I go ahead and preach my Frailty this morning should the singers go ahead and sing in their Frailty sing in their Humanity that I say as a people of God we need to Rise Above This ungodly fear that will try to hold us back oh but there's cancer everywhere brother Donnie I understand I read just this morning where a disease X that they are already working on right now in the Laboratories and they're saying it will be 20 times worse than Co it will be more devastating it will be more deadly but I say as the people of God by his Tripes we are already healed of disease X amen by his promise of the word he cannot lie come on somebody he cannot lie our god is perfect oh my brother Donnie what if somebody dies with with disease act what if they do all I can say is it was their time to go let me remind you again cancer did not defeat my daughter my daughter defeated cancer amen every child of God that goes by the way of the Grave if they could not have went unless our father said come on home honey come on home child and it was only a way out of this world into that Kingdom that they have been born into oh I got such a beautiful text from a brother a minister up in Canada last week and he was telling me you know how that he had prayed and his church had prayed for Erica so many times we are so grateful for each prayer that was made and he told me he said you know brother Donnie the devil was not just after her body but the devil was after her face and he never got her face I thought what a powerful statement that the devil wasn't just after her body he was after her faith you know you realize that's what he's after for us today he would try to make us doubt and make us wonder over the sovereignty of God and why would God do this and why would God let this you know what he's after he's after your faith he wants you to somehow doubt and somehow question brother Donnie do you understand any better I don't understand any better today than I did a few weeks ago when we had our graduation service but I know this I trust him with all of my heart and what I can't understand I say the Lord don't make no mistake come on somebody let's have church do I understand why the Lord took her no I don't do I understand the way he took her no I don't but I understand this my God is absolutely perfect he is without fault he makes no mistakes and I'll say to the devil Satan you never won my daughter won Satan you did not win over Junior Davis Junior Davis won over the devil Satan you did not win oh Hallelujah over Jim bab Jim bab one over the [Applause] devil notice this second Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and love and of a sound mind 1 John 4:18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that fear it is not made perfect in love I love the way the prophet catches this dealing with fear and love and he said but perfect love casteth out fear the reason you're fearful is because the right temperaments of love has never entered yet praise God the right Temperance of love has never entered yet when there's real love all fear passes away amen when you really love the Lord anybody say Amen notice again so if the church only knew its position and the greatest hindrance in the church is fear they're afraid it just won't work it just won't work and as long as we're afraid it won't work most of us will never attempt it because we're afraid we'll get embarrassed so if we confess that God's A Healer and God's a deliverer and it would be God's will to take us then we feel like well I I I got embarrassed we got embarrassed somehow cuz we prayed for so and so and the Lord took them and said heal and we got embarrassed he heard your prayer that's right he healed them from their Mor ality don't think your prayer was not answered notice he said they're afraid it just won't work it won't work for you that way it will not work that way it must absolutely be Believers not make Believers but Believers from your heart love has no fear love casts out fear and I notice in my meetings so much when I come to the people one the great things I found among them is fear and what makes fear is a lack of confidence lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear praise the Lord it'll make you feel well I just don't know if God will or not well brother Donnie I mean you you pray for sister Eric and you pray for others is going to die I guess that means you're going to stop praying you guess wrong I'm going to pray more ferven than I've ever prayed in my life remember when brother Bram was a little girl died and she was in so much pain that her eyes crossed with the pain and notice what that done to that prophet he said there was never a crosseyed child that come across the platform that was not healed why because that looking reminded him of his little Sharon Rose it made him hate that devil more than ever before so if you think I'm going to pray for everybody except those that have cancer you are 100% wrong I'm going to pray with more fervency than I've ever prayed in my life because I hate hate that devil more than I've ever hated him come on somebody oh my just because we pray for him and the Lord takes them does not mean he did not hear our prayer he did oh my notice this he said what makes fear is a lack of confidence you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it Cast Away that fear and that's the way God wants the church not so much charter members he wants members that's loyal how many wants to be loyal and loves and believes and has confidence it but you see Satan works on these things that are naturally negativity that we're prone to we're born negative so we're prone to worry we're prone to have fear instead of Faith we're more prone to be scared than we are to be Valiant we're more prone to be fear fearful than we are to be Gallant we're more prone to be that way it comes that way in our natural birth so every time we stand galling on the word we have to go against ourself to do it oh man notice this about worry if you notice it's when you're discouraged oh my when you're discouraged that's when the devil can pour it on you how many's ever been discouraged and you know that to be the truth boy when you get down it's like the devil just empties out everything I me here comes a big old UK truck he EMP his this out on you he's got that and EMP his out and you say Lord have mercy what in the world is going on he recognizes that you're discourage I know y'all think I'm weird anyway but I'm going to share a little bit more of my auditude with you there's times when I get down so low and I go to pray I don't even say anything come on so I'm just there before the Lord and I'm not saying nothing cuz I know if I say it out loud the devil will hear it so I'm just there before the Lord and in My Heart Lord you know where I'm at Lord you see Lord I I I I really need your help but it don't say it here that's crazy is it question answer 64 brother brandom you told us when you went out west first and now the second time you ever went you know so well well brother sister that that's in my heart and if I speak it out the devil will hear it so he don't know anything about it I just keep it in my heart sometimes when you go to pray and you kind of we and you down the devil don't even know what a good job he's doing until you open that fat mouth of yours and say Lord I'm so down Lord I'm so weary Lord I don't know if I'll even make it another day or not you should never say that just get down and [Music] go Lord have mercy brother Donnie you don't I do oh yes I do and the devil say the boy's cracked the boy is out of his mind he don't know what's in my heart but I ain't going to tell him I ain't going to tell him Lord I've never been so low in my life Lord I've never been so this and that and the other because the devil say we finally got him boys we about got him but when you get down there and you just hold it in your heart and the devil's waiting and waiting and waiting and brother V he just getting tired of waiting and you're just smiling and just you know just sitting there and Lord in your heart you're just having a prayer meeting with God and God saying yes son I hear you yes daughter I know what you're going through and the devil's saying how's God hearing them I don't hear one thing said because God can hear your heart when your mouth ain't saying one thing a lot of us are too blabber mths We Get Down On Our Knees to pray and we tell the devil everything in the world that's going on oh I wish somebody would hear me today but sometimes we need to kind of Tri the devil a little bit and just get down and say oh thank you Jesus oh thank you Jesus oh I love you Lord oh thank you Lord God I worship you Lord God and the devil said what in the world's a matter with him what in the world's a matter with her well you refuse to be able to sell the devil how successful that he is and they said well I'm from confused I don't even understand what's going on well good that's what I wanted to do I think we let the devil mess with us too much and we need to start a kind of messing with him a little bit and let him know we are more than Victors we are more than conquerors through him that gave himself for us we're not going to live under ungodly fear we are going to live under the joy of the Lord because that's our strength yes sir if you come to church and say well I don't know I don't know where they're I'll ever get any better or not see I've been prayed for twice you might as well go home that's all but when you can cast that aside God don't want you to be everybody let your face know that quote now what are you frowning for trying to help make you laugh God don't want you frowning I need help us that little quote sometimes you ever brother's Zach now listen God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy praise God worry will cause temper so for the safety of the preacher the preacher is moving behind the lesler temper will cause cancer and yet you will take that long finger yours and point at people to smoke cigarettes and say don't you know that devil is going to cause cancer inside your body and you've got enough temper to fight a buz saw and that temper inside of you is causing cancer come on now just like that cigarette smoke is causing cancer in them and it's disgusting to you to watch them put snuff down in the bottom of their lip oh my and you say don't you know that's causing glory of God I'll tell you one time that's causing cancer y'all go ahead and tell them why don't you tell them in your temper and in your anger that what you're doing is causing you cancer as well hey amen amen oh I may be down for a while I may be sad for a while I may have to let my face know for a while but I am a winner I am a conqueror I am more Hallelujah death will not Hold Us Down sickness will not hold us down the world will not hold us down we will overcome we were made to be [Applause] happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset now you see to most of us this is just a really nice quote to me it should be a fulfillment in somebody's life just walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither Powers no things present things future nothing that can separate us from him now brother B preaches a sermon called spiritual Amnesia only preaches it one time it was Birmingham 1964 but there's such astounding statements in here let me just share a couple with you here now this Amnesia we told it can cause you to a place where you cannot identify yourself now maybe some of you have had family members or friends or people that you've known that had Amnesia it can be brought on by a shock it can be brought on by an injury it can be brought on by different things that go on in the brain and the person after they begin to recuperate they still don't know who they are that must be a terrible thing so they look in the mirror and they don't know who they are and they look at people that they should know and that person said don't you know me don't you know me and you're saying I don't don't you know me you you you you we've been friends we're in the same don't you don't you know me I don't so should I know you should I I know you yes yes I'm your uncle son so I'm your brother I'm your sister I'm your mother and there's something missing the connection between you and them I want you to notice where you cannot identify yourself now it's an unusual thing don't happen too often but the caus this is from shock it's somebody that don't even know who they are and you find it from Wars but ain't no wonder so many of our folks have got it too look at the battles we're in you see it can come from Wars and Wars sometimes are War one and other times they're lost and it can come from I've seen it many times as Christians that will lose battles in this war and they become so tore up because this besetting sin or whatever it is just upsets them once and then another time and another time and they get to a spot they I don't even know if I'm bride or not right I don't even know if I'm elected looks like to me if I was elected I I i' I'd do better I I'd be better all right and then they go to entering into this this trauma of Amnesia and they forget who they are like they forget so much of what God's done for them and they forget he's the one to reach them down and pick them up and and WIP them off and and Sanctified him and gave him so many good things but it's like they can't they can't focus on it no more you find it from Wars sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing causes it is worry so then a person can worry so much they actually get a spirit of worry on them and they worry and they fret and they fret and they worry and they're under such trauma and such sadness and such difficulty and little by little day by day they begin to lose their identity of who they are as a son or daughter of God God and it becomes such a Hal on them it's like they cannot shake it there's some powerful discernments that the prophet calls people out of course tells them different things but some of the ones that I I find so valuable myself are people that that would come up and one in my mind particular this morning I wouldn't think about speaking about it but a woman that comes up and he says you you've waited for a place where you could put your foot and people have told you get next to yourself get next to yourself and you've tried but you just can't do it but then he turns but I rebuke that spirit so now this person had entered into the stage of Amnesia and they tried and they tried and they couldn't do it notice he says worry has no virtue to it at all yeah just just skip worry worry and accept Faith skip worry and accept Faith someone said well now what if you were going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry I said no I don't think so why well I said worry couldn't do nothing but make me worse well what good is it to have faith I said it might deliver me it might deliver me and that's right now notice he said so worry has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue believe now worry sometimes causes it and another thing that cause among the people is getting between two opinions that'll cause Amnesia so getting between two opinions will cause Amnesia so people hear one idea about this and hear someone else come across with another idea about the same thing and then people now I don't know what to believe you know what happens an Amnesia strikes you and before you heard that opposing side you were settled you were oh I know exactly where I belong I know exactly where I stand I'm a Christian I'm in Christ Jesus I believe this word I'm part of the move of God and then someone else says something else you say well I mean I I mean I I thought I thought I was I thought I was okay I thought I believe this message I thought that I you know whatever it is and then they get to a spot but now I don't I don't I don't know Amnesia my brother sister PT s d post-traumatic stress syndrome what it call some heart battles hurt weariness exhaustion and then you don't know who you are and you don't know who anybody else is you don't know who your friend is you don't know who your enemies are can't trust nobody nine times out of 10 start drawing off to their s drawing further and further and further away oh I can't trust nobody can't trust nobody oh just get away from everybody I'm just going to stay home I ain't going nowhere I'm just going to stay home everybody leave me alone leave me alone you're falling right into the Trap Of The Devil God has a cure this morning for BTS D you imagine the prophet 1950 tells this individual whenever they come up on the platform all right sister don't worry about that cancer you got you got to be kidding me one of the most dreaded words for us as Mortals to hear I'm sorry to tell you this sir but you have cancer and yet you've got a prophet of God sting there telling them don't worry about it let me tell you this morning as Erica Reagan Parker's family members we saw a little woman that when she was diagnosed with it did not worry from day one until the end of her days on the earth now you may look at that and think but but it took her it did not he took her right that's right he took her he brought her here and he took her she left his presence as a thought but she went back under that altar as a manifested attribute alive she left his presence as a thought which had not yet come into expression but she lived on this Earth for 44 years in the last four she fought for her very existence she fought for her very life and she believed God's promise and I personally have seen her when the doctors would give her a terrible report one thing after another and she would me be sitting right there by her and get in the vehicle and take her home and she would life and say but God has the last word God has the last word so that is a daughter of God or a son of God that looks at God's promise and said devil not today not today devil oh Hallelujah I don't care if you're facing cancer I don't care if you're facing bankruptcy I don't care what you're facing today our God is bigger than every problem you got our God is bigger than your sin he's bigger than your sorrow he's bigger than everything you're going to I wish somebody would shout Glory with me this morning I God is a mighty God notice us through the services of this week trying to show people there's no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear it's worse than cancer it's worse than TB it's worse than any disease the worst thing he can put on you is fear even if you even had a Cancer and you didn't fear and believe God but heal you you wouldn't been too bad as God take care of that if you're sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place on a person now this week I've tried to prove by the scripture that that man that's born again of the kingdom of God has amen wonder why the angel of the Lord when he meets the prophet he could have named all kinds of diseases wonder why he only mentioned one and what was that one cancer not even cancer wonder why I didn't mention all the rest of them wonder why cancer there must be quite a devil ain't it but there won't be one devil that'll stand before our lord Jesus and be able to say nobody ever defeated me we've got people sitting right here today who have been healed by cancer some by Divine Healing some by Miracles I may believe God still heals cancer and he believes we're still going to pray with cancer for cancer patients with all of our heart come on somebody why because we believe our God can do it but brother Donnie what if the Lord takes them well if he does they walk that journey by faith and when it come right down to the end of it they could look the devil right Square in the face and say like Paul said the time of my departure is at hand I have been faithful I have been true Hallelujah I have Liv a Victorious overcoming life I did not fear cancer a child of God don't even fear death a child of God can look death in the face and say death you messed up today because all you're going to do is Carry Me home in the presence of God gu you are a loser Brothers Let's skip down the one quote there let's go to God's covenant with Abraham 1956 you got something wrong with your ear that's the bad part but there comes a dark shadow and you're scared cancer on the brain don't be scared don't how is that possible that the doctor can say you've got cancer on the brain it won't bother you now go on your road you're going to be all right why if you don't fear oh but brother Donnie the bombs you know the gbus and the this and that and the other and all that I know all of that's there but we've got a promise Hallelujah that before one of them ever go to hit us we will be gone why because we believe our God can I have a few more minutes notice with me in Psalm 2744 let's look at a principle of God that we as Believers look at his word and something that God requires of us wait on the Lord be of good courage he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord sometimes we wait for healing sometimes we wait for deliverance and sometimes we wait for a perspective about his will now I'm G tell you how I feel about the Lord Jesus I prayed to God and God has told me yes I prayed to God and God's told me no I prayed to God and God has told me to wait a while but if I pray for something with all of my heart and I really want a yes but he gives me a no if no is his will in reality I want no even though my flesh may not want no it may break my heart how many has ever been there sure you have have you been say very long I hear the prophet say in 195 Last Story Lord you have broken my heart over and over again but I thank you for it because his NOS are just as important to me as his yeses if that is his will and I don't believe the will of God will ever lead you and I to a place that the grace of God will not keep us while we're in that place but what must we do we must wait on him amen notice again David says in Psalm 33:20 our soul waiteth for the Lord he is our help and our Shield Psalm 377 rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prosper in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass psalm 79 for the evil goers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth Psalm 37:34 wait on the Lord and keep his way he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off Psalm 40 And1 to the chief musician of Psalm of David I waited patiently for the Lord patience and faith is not the same same thing millions of Christians have faith but only in the minority have patience come on you see God well let me just say it this this way I found it this morning the prophet said Believers are like change in your pocket in God's hand so he said you reach down in your pocket and you pull out pennies nickels times quarters silver dollars then it says lot was a penny he leaned toward the world he couldn't stick with the prophet in his message Abraham so he leaned toward the world and he was only a Pity but yet Abraham didn't throw him out and he said remember God can only use them in a penny way and they can only buy a Penny's worth of faith of course so they can go so far and maybe you're a a silver dollar and you look at them and say watch as plain as a nose on your face why can't you see this why can't you see that why can't you see this and you're able to purchase an entire 100 penny worth by your faith and and you're trying to reconcile and trying to fellowship and trying to talk to somebody that's all that'll ever be a Pity and they love the Lord a Penny's worth and then maybe you'll meet some it's a niichel worth and some of dime's worth and some a quarter's worth but if God's give you aund worth don't look down your nose at those it's only a penny cuz remember the key word was a prophet was says it was changed in your pocket but but it was in God's hand so where does it come from your pocket who's your pocket the church so the church is the one by which pennies nickels dimes quarters and dollars are found in the pocket so much of the church but the whole thing is what the kingdom of God and God is the one who drops that ability in a hearts of believe oh say glory to God I'll tell you one thing I know I'm aund I'm this and that and there man alive I'm this well if you are you ought to thank God cuz it's his grace to you cuz ain't none of us worth nothing noow even if you're a penny it's the grace of God if you're a silver dollar it's the grace of God if you're a dime if you're a nickel if you're a quarter come on somebody it's the grace of God some people will never be able to purchase a 100% worse of rapturing face they just see no need and sitting under the eagle anointing they see no need even though they're around the perimeter of it they see no need in preaching the message that they just see no need of it to them believing it is all they need to do they see no need in Reading quotes and and talking about the prophet and his message they see no need in it but if you're a silver dollar yes sir you realize you've got to be under an eagled anointing in order to fly out of here and it ain't enough just to believe it you want to share it so you want to share it on your Facebook account you want to share it in your emails you want to share it here some a lot of folks are secret belie they're going to wait I'm going Su I can what they're waiting for but one of these days they're going to tell everybody I reckon I just hope they don't wait too long to say you know what God sent a prophet and it's too late so God gives us the ability so some can believe Oh Glory to God I believe don't say they don't let them have their Penny walk let them use their Penny Faith let them use their Penny ability and if you're a dime don't look down your nose at them and said I'm 10 times better than you or 25 or 100 But realize it's God's mercy to use silver dollar notice in Psalm 625 David said my soul wait only upon God for my expectation is for him Psalm 69:3 I am weary of my crying my throat is dried my eyes fail while I wait for my God you're talking about a man in desperation I am weary of my crying how many's ever cried to where you you thought I can never shed another tear whether it's for a loved one whether it's death or someone that walks away from the word whatever it is and you cry and you cry and you think I I just can't do anymore and somehow here comes another and another and another and David said I am weary of my crying my throat is dry the Hebrew word there is parched up burned enkindled and then inflamed so David had prayed and he prayed and he called on God until his throat was so sore and become inflamed and he couldn't even hardly talk anymore the great Gallant psalmist of Israel couldn't harly talk and it wasn't because he been to the Ball Game and it Shout Ed his voice out he was crying and praying and asking God for Mercy oh my by excessive exertion of his voice had become so parched his eyes failed because of exhaustion and his eyes were nearly swollen shut the way mine were a few days ago as I said in the hospital and cried and wept and cried and my eyes as I was there started swelling shut on me anybody ever been there so you know what I'm talking about and what do we do in such times we keep on waiting his power of vision had failed him but he said notice while I wait for my God Psalm 13:5 I wait for the Lord my soul does wait and in his word do I hope my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning this would be pecul fcar to us because we don't have watchers anymore but you see living in a city the enemy was constantly trying to come in and they would have watchers during different watches of the night the three watches and they would watch and the worst one of course was the night watch which had broken up in two watches and they would wait for the Watchers to go to sleep and it must have seemed like the watch would would never end during the day it's easy to set up on the wall you got all the people hey John how you doing how's your crops doing this year doing good how's your all they're doing good how's your sheep oh everything's fine yeah everything good hey hey Fred hey hey how you doing down there buddy but at night time it's only you people are trying to sleep man a l oh but if you go to sleep the enemy is watching you and if you leave you're post of Duty and the enemy comes in well you forsook your post you will answer to God because you were not where you were supposed to be you imagine how weary they must have been and David said I've sought you Lord I've waited I'm waiting for you more than the Watchers of the night oh God that keep the walls Psalm 123:2 behold as the eyes of servants look under the hand of their masters as the eyes of a m into the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until that he ha mercy upon us verse three have mercy upon us oh Lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt Isaiah 25 59 and it shall be said in that day Lo This Is Our God we have waited for him he will save us this is the Lord and we have waited for him and we will be glad and rejoice and his salvation now let us change here for just a moment and look to the powder keg of the earth look friends how fast this thing in Israel can change I took her a few weeks ago I said you watch what'll happen initially the world will stand with Israel But as time goes on and they start defending their ground and really going after that enemy it will change one after another after another after another if you've kept up with it is that's what happens don't you understand that's exactly the way he wants to do you so then if we attack our enemy worldliness if if we attack our enemy complacency if we attack our enemy lack of desire to go to the house of God one enemy after the other after the other and people say all they all the time just preaching on us they're just all the time preaching on us I'm trying to destroy your enemy spiritual Hamas and what does the devil want the preachers to do lighten up oh you just demanding too much of the people just preach good to them all the time tell them how good they are tell them how sweet they are well if you're more sweeter I tell you you're more sweeter if he more gooder I could preach more gooder come on but if you're lazy and complacent then don't pray and don't read your Bible how can you expect me to preach any higher than you live come on somebody and what does the devil want to do the devil wants to shut the mouths of those men of God who wants to go underground and dig out your spiritual Hamas so what is the cry over a 100,000 people gathered in Washington DC was it outrage for babies that were beheaded was it outrage for people who were burned alive Jews praise the Lord it's almost like it's a one-sided deal I have the Jerusalem Post app on my phone had it for a couple years every day since this thing has happened I'm getting siren warnings on my phone got several before I come out actually where they coming from OS rocket siding coming near T you've got 10 seconds that's what you have 10 seconds after the warning to take cover but why is the world not see that also who are they focused on oh Israel done this and Israel done that Israel done this come on I hope there ain't no Pro Palestinian people sitting here I'm Pro lifee I hate it when the innocent people suffer but when you got these bunch of devils who plant their their headquarters right among the innocent people what in the world can you expect come on children oh you say brother Donnie you shouldn't blast this and that and the other you're hurting innocent people well get out of there then if you don't want your heart burned get out of that mess get out of that mess cuz we are not going to compromise on sin I'm going to preach against the spiritual homos I'm going to go underground if I have to and blast out their tunnels and do everything we can to destroy the headquarters of hell so what did prime minister b mean Netanyahu meet when Antony blinkin our highest ranking Diplomat whenever he met with him yesterday and said we need a ceasefire he said no that's exactly what OS wants get a ceasefire so they can regroup now don't just get Israel in your mind only look at your enemy what's he want me every other anointed man of God to bring a ceasefire let's let's get love let's quit preaching against the denominations and preaching against sin preaching against it we need new preachers need more love in your heart that's why I've got more love that's why I'm blasting that thing I love people I don't want them to go to hell I don't want them to go to wind up in hell if they do they're going to go to the top of my voice but what Satan calling for brother Joel a ceas fire right y'all quit firing y'all quit doing this and show love if I let you go to hell I don't love you amen amen I like Israel's tactics so what they did was they found one of the main entrances to one of the main tunnels and then they sent some of their Commandos in to draw Hamas out so when they drew them out then these other special unit which specializes in tunnel Warfare while they was out and gone these guys went right down in the middle of it took a bunch of pictures of all the information and hid in the tunnels and then whenever Israel come against them these other guys come back down in their safety zone ah but then they realize here's some Jews armed with ues and they Uzi caboo them well I tell I believe God's got some preachers to specialize in tunnel Warfare now needless to say some preachers are above ground and that's the only place they ever see they would know how to behave as they called them in the Vietnam War like a tunnel rat that's the name they gave them but there was men that the Viet Kong absolutely hated and it was men called tunnel rats and they would go down in them tunnels and they would flush the enemy out it's a dangerous deal cuz they got them booby trapped they had venomous snakes down in it they had all types of things but these men were trained to go down I'm glad God still got some men that know how to fight in the tunnels and they may go down where you and I ain't used to but thank God they're going down in there and flushing that devil out and here comes the devil Oh Glory to God get rid of that habit get rid of this temper get rid of this and that and the other and what's it do it flushes them out so these guys up on top can pick them off like flies thanks be to God for men of God that are willing to stand in this day and preach against evil and preach against darkness and preach against sin and also preach against fear and preach against our joy being taken from [Applause] us let's bow our heads together praise the lord lord Jesus we thank you today for your word forgive us father for being manipulated or controlled by ungodly fear help us I pray father Lord Jesus we're so grateful for lives that have lived Among Us I remember brother Junior Davis whenever he was going through his great battle and test of his faith Lord it was during that time frame and a little bit before that I was preaching about the confessions I would go to the hospital to see brother Junior and there at the foot of his bed no matter what room he was in there would be his little board that the family members had brought and it was his confession of Faith now no doubt some of them doctors and nurses and specialists in time they thought boy that guy sure missed it oh no he didn't miss it he was testifying of his confession of Faith Hallelujah and it was a great heroic deed I'm reminded of others that have posted their little signs here and there and there praise the Lord Karen brought one to Erica a few days before she transition from time into eternity it was a little sign set up on the wall something to the effect of then the miracle walked in well I have to be on the C I read that I thought yep yep that's what's going to happen the Lord's going to heal her body Miracle's going to walk in but the miracle that walked in wasn't the healing of her body but the healing from mortality Hallelujah as we heard her as she gasped for her breath we knew it wouldn't be long unless you intervened but the last one was taken and there was Silence from her body but little did we know she was only one breath away from Beth theophany praise God her little heart stopped beating oh I took her little precious hand in a few moments it was cold her fingernails started turning blue one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever experienced but he had I had to just keep consoling myself Donnie she's not there it's just a house house it's an empty house thank you Lord God oh Jesus I've got more to go to heaven for than I had the three weeks ago Jesus we're closer we're one funeral closer too actually for the Bob we may have a few more we don't know but we are waiting patiently on you Lord I'm waiting down here at the river will you come Lord Jesus Satan don't want me to Cross no Satan don't want me to Cross but I'm waiting down here Lord God may you anoint us with strength joy happiness may you anoint us as the army of God Lord as I saw a video the other day of Israel as they were gathered there before going into Gaza I hope the Bible readers here understand this is the exact same place where the Philistines were from Gaza the same area that Samson entered into the same area that David entered into and there was were some of David's sons and I watched them men as somebody turned on some type of Jewish music and before they went into the battle they started dancing before the Lord hallelujah hallelujah them men out there grabbing one another and dancing and screaming and hollering and someone had read a Psalm before they entered into the battle they was praising the Lord Lord God may we praise you before we get into it may we praise you while we're in it and may we praise you when we come out amen hallelujah we don't want to be the type of Christians that can only praise you when the battle's over we want to praise you before it ever starts we want to praise you when we're right in the middle of it and we sure want to praise you when we come through on the other side Lord God I pray for your tunnel Fighters I pray for those men who Step Up Lord and they risk their lives and hand toam combat your men of God around the world bless each one of them Father we need your men servants Lord in the last couple of years I've never seen such onslaught of Hell against the ministers and if Satan can't attack them personally they attack their family their wives their children it's unbelievable what's going on around the world Satan ain't attacking tape players he ain't attacking MP3 players he's attacking men of God like never before it shows us he knows where the thread is Hallelujah Lord God if I ain't nothing but a little Corporal if our church ain't nothing but just a little spot on the back side of the desert is as it was if I have to be a tunnel rat as it were Lord God if I've got to be a guy that carries the water or peels of ters don't make no difference to me whatever you want me to do I want to be a faithful Tater or peeler I want to be a faithful water hauler I want to be at my post of Duty and when the Rapture comes I want to be in the right place at the right time Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we love you Lord Jesus how many say today with me Lord God let me be at my post of Duty let me be faithful how many with me raise your hands to God as a living witness to heaven and hell today God strengthened me God help me hallelujah or some of you may never carry the banner some of you may never be a a commanding officer it was but maybe you're one of them like it was that held up the hands of Moses maybe you're one of them that's standing behind the men of God praying for them and you think that ain't important I'll tell you what it is very very important but each of us are called to do something friends Hallelujah would you lay your hands on one another would you mind dear father right now in the name of Jesus I pray that you'd help each of us I still don't think this church understands the value of their post of Duty I don't think most of us take it as serious as it is in the Civil War time if a person was placed to guard a certain post and they fell asleep or they just simply left their post of D and got out and wandered around a little bit from one post to another to another and the enemy came in and through that breach was able to kill several of their men that man was brought before the tribunal he was judged court marshaled and shocked because he left his post of Duty but somehow when it comes to the army of God people think they can just do whatever they wanted do well if I don't want to go to church I don't have to I'll do this I'll do whatever I want to do I wonder how many people are going to be judged when they stand before the Lord because they left their post of Duty at the beckoning of another person or because a feeling come over them and they thought they should Lord God help each of us at this church to realize no one can take our place no matter how small we think we are no matter how big we think we are no one can take our place and if we fail our post of Duty we will be held accountable before you Lord may we realize what a serious thing it is oh we've got so many of the message that ain't nothing but Church Hoppers they go from one to another to another to another and they don't realize one day they're going to be judged before almighty God help me Lord never to be one that'll Sher my responsibility help me Lord that I can stand faithful and when the trumpet sounds Hallelujah I will be found faithful at my post of Duty May every man woman boy and girl that belongs in our assembly father I pray you would shake them today help them Lord to realize what an important thing it is for them oh Lord to stand at their post and realize no one can take their place not only that but what a thing each of us have to answer for I have to answer that day Lord for many many Souls God help me but help these people to realize it's not just me that has to answer but they also have to answer they'll answer for that post that you gave them every preacher that's been here with us whether they are here or godone on they will have to answer every one of us Lord the claim we believe this message we will have to answer oh God may we be faithful may we be true Lord the call in the land is ceasefire ceas fire but we know how the devil plays ceasefire he only wants us to cease fire we don't make no deals with the devil so we ain't ceas firing as a matter of fact we're going to let him have it more than we've ever let him have it before we're going to bring out our GBU bombs we're going to bring out our bunker Busters we're going to bring out hand grenades if have to we'll pick up day old biscuits and hit them in the head we're going to do everything we can Lord God lord we're going to stand as an army of God hallelujah hallelujah amen and we

soul that seeketh him him habac 2:3 for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t when you
