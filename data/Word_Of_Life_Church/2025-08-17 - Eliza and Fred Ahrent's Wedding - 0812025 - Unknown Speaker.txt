[Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] All rise, please. [Music] You may be seated. family and friends are gathered here together in the sight of God in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman to enter into the holy state of matrimony which is commanded in the scriptures to be entered into reverently discreetly and in the fear of God. These two persons present today have come to be joined together not only just in vows but in commitment and in covenant and in love. Who gives this woman to be married to this man? [Music] One look at you, my whole life falls in line. I prayed for you before I called you mine. Oh, I can't believe it's true sometimes. Oh, I can't believe it's true. I get to love you. It's the best thing that I'll ever do. I get to love you. It's a promise I'm making to you. Whatever may come, your heart I will choose. Forever I'm yours. Forever I do. I get to love you. I get to love you. The way you love it changes who I am. I am undone and I thank God once again. Oh, I can't believe it's true sometimes. No, I can't believe it's true. I get to love you. It's the best thing that I'll ever do. I get to love you. It's a promise I'm making to you. Whatever may come, your heart I will choose. Forever I'm yours. Forever I do. I get to love you. I get to love you. I get to love you. I get to love you. And they say love is a journey. I promise that I'll never leave. And when it's too heavy to car, remember this moment with me. I get to love you. I get to love you. I get to love you. [Music] I wonder today if we would ask the meaning of love to different cultures in the world, to different people of the world. Probably every answer would be somewhat unique from one individual to the other depending on what they were taught that love really was. When the first couple stood in the Garden of Eden and the love that they had and experienced for each other, I dare say that there was very few people in the Old Testament after that fall that ever experienced that type of love again. As a matter of fact, many of the marriages in the Old Testament among the cultures of the people for thousands of years, love had a very small relevance in the union itself. It was more about what it could accomplish and what it could benefit the parents and business and transactions. You may love your husband or your wife or you may not. But you see, the Lord Jesus when he come to the earth, he didn't just come to redeem us from sin, but he came to restore love again. So since his coming to the earth and people being able to be born of his life, it restored a love that a man and a woman could have for each other that hasn't been anything quite like it since the Garden of Eden. So when we see a man and woman that are born of the spirit of God and they fall in love with each other, they have something working between them that is a restoration of what Adam and Eve experienced for a short time and then it was lost. There's a few characters in the Bible, Song of Solomon just speaks one, Ruth another. There's a few that we can read about them and their love was so outstanding and that's the reason it was outstanding because it was not common. For those of us today that are Christians and filled with the spirit of God and we have our wives, our husbands, we don't realize how grateful that we should be to know the love that we experience when we look them in the face and the eyes that we're experiencing the same type of thing that was on the original son and daughter of God. When we think of love, many people look at love and it's all about what love can do for them. Marriage is. So when a young man will look for a woman, he said, "Well, I like this and I like that. I like that and she'll do me good this way and that way and the young lady many times does exactly the same." But whenever we look at real love, real love is sacrificial love. So whenever a man finds a woman that he loves with all of his heart, and when it comes right down to it, he can't actually point his finger to it's the size of her fingers. They're so small. Oh, I just love the size of her fingers. Or it's how tall she is. There'll be all kinds of things that he could identify, but when it comes down to it, he cannot really tell you the one thing that it is. Neither can she. if it's true love because we're using finite descriptions the way we would describe the way we feel. But true love, the love of God is not just emotional love and it's not just sexual love, but it's a love that is even beyond that. And it's very sad in the day that we live in when over 50% of our marriages wind up in divorce in our nation. And we can see why because many of them do not have the restored love to be able to love their husband or wife in that way. Love is a self-giving love patterned after the cross. Paul does not define love as a rush of romantic hormones. Instead, love is the sacrifice of yourself for your beloved. It is a decision to nail your selfishness to the cross while giving your love to the one person you love the most in the earth. It is a decision to give up your selfishness for the sake of the one you love. This is the kind of love we trust this young man and this young woman will love each other with. You should love each other not because he or she gives you pleasure but because you want to give yourself up to each other. And see this is the real secret of the love of God. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved. So, it wasn't just about what can you all do for me? If I die for you, what will you all give me? Will you all live for me? Will you serve me? That had nothing to do with the equation. God so loved that he gave. Then it's up to us whether we receive that love or not. You can imagine then a man and a woman that love each other with that kind of love. they have a great advantage over the average person that just falls in love with somebody because of looks or lust or money or whatever else it is. Love is giving yourself up for each other. That is how Christ loved the church and that is how you need to love each other. And I suggest to you today that this unconditional love is a healthy model for every godly marriage. While it is right to long for your spouse to change and right now they love each other so much they think it don't even matter. But as they are with each other for a while he'll begin to say things about her and he may already have but he just hasn't told her yet. And she'll see things about him and she'll think I wish he didn't do that. I wish he'd pick up his clothes. I wish he wouldn't kick his shoes off by the door. And but you see real true love is actually an unconditional love. And as we fall in love with a person, we can also fall out of love with that person. If it's conditional love because the conditions were right for us to fall in love with them. When the conditions change, we no longer feel the same way. And what's so sad is to see two people living together by law. They're married. By God's covenant, they're married, but yet they no longer love each other. But if this couple can base it upon that, they'll have something that'll keep them for the rest of their life. Secondly, love is forgiving. And we can see this not only just by the first man and woman that was in the Garden of Eden because it's evident that Adam lost something that he had in those first few months or years, however long it was because he loved her so much he was willing to forfeit his kingdom for her. And once that holy image of God left him, he turns right around and blames God, the woman you gave me. So something left him. Something left him. That godly image. And that woman that he forfeited his godship for cuz that's what he was a god of the earth. And now that that left him, he blames God and he blames the wife. Why? Adam had lost this type of love. What will make a marriage last is the willingness to seek forgiveness and to forgive. That's why in the Bible Paul talks about love keeps no records. Do you good to read that in 1 Corinthians 13 sometimes love doesn't keep a tally. It doesn't keep a note on your iPhone or your Droid of how many times your husband or your wife or your friend or whoever it is has offended you or trespassed against you. Love keeps no records. You see, if real divine love kept records, there will be no one saved, absolutely no one at the white throne judgment. Because all of us have so much against us in God's sight, there's no help for any of us if love keeps a record. But you see, forgiveness involves more than just, okay, okay, I I forgive you this time. But then the next time you bring it up again and again and again. It's easy to keep a record of wrongs if you're not careful to keep a chart, a list, a running tally of all the times you've been hurt or offended. Forgive because that's what Jesus does. Find your ways of resolving your conflicts and forgiving each other and then enjoy the making up. What does it mean to forgive? Again, the meanings would vary as many several hundred people here today. This is quite a simple meaning that I think defines it well. It means to set the other person free by absorbing the pain into yourself that rightly should be theirs. Listen to me again. Forgiveness means to set the other person free by absorbing the pain into yourself that rightly should be theirs. You say, "How can you say that?" Because that's what he done for all of us. You see, he forgave us our wrong and all of our guilt and all of our pain. It should have been hours to bear. But he said, "I forgive you so much. I'll take that to me and I will release you." You know, the scripture tells us not to let the sun go down upon a wrath. And I think that's a good advice for married couples as well. We'll proceed to the wedding vow so everybody can relax now. Okay. I require and charge you both as you will answer at the day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. If either of you know of any impediment while you may not be lawfully joined together, you do now confess it. For any persons being joined together otherwise, and God's word do allow their marriage is not lawful. But believing that you have considered this solemn obligation before these witnesses and God, we will proceed. Fred, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in the holy state of matrimony? Do you promise to love and honor and cherish and support her in sickness and riches or poverty and forsake all others as long as you both shall live? &gt;&gt; I do. Eliza, will you have this man to be your lawful wedded husband to live together in the holy state of matrimony? Do you promise to love, honor, cherish, obey, support, and sickness, health, riches, or poverty, and cleave you only unto him so long as you both shall live. Repeat these words after me. I Fred take you Eliza &gt;&gt; I Fred take you Eliza &gt;&gt; to my wed wife &gt;&gt; to my wed wife &gt;&gt; to have and to hold &gt;&gt; to have and to hold. &gt;&gt; From this day forward &gt;&gt; from this day forward. &gt;&gt; For better for worse. &gt;&gt; For better for worse. &gt;&gt; For richer for poor. &gt;&gt; For richer, for poorer. &gt;&gt; In sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; in sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; To love. &gt;&gt; To love. &gt;&gt; To cherish. &gt;&gt; To cherish. &gt;&gt; Till death us do part. till death do his part. &gt;&gt; Eliza, repeat these words after me. I Eliza take you fre &gt;&gt; Eliza take you &gt;&gt; to my wed husband. &gt;&gt; To my wed husband &gt;&gt; to have and to hold. &gt;&gt; To have and to hold. &gt;&gt; From this day forward. &gt;&gt; From this day forward. &gt;&gt; For better, for worse. &gt;&gt; For better, for worse. &gt;&gt; For richer, for poor. &gt;&gt; For richer, for poor. &gt;&gt; In sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; In sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; To love. &gt;&gt; To love. &gt;&gt; To cherish. &gt;&gt; Till death has depart. I'll require a token is a symbol of your love. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Place this on his finger. Say these words after me. With this ring. &gt;&gt; With this ring. &gt;&gt; I be wed. &gt;&gt; I be wed. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. With this ring &gt;&gt; With this ring, &gt;&gt; I wed &gt;&gt; I be wed. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. [Music] Wipe your tears. Take a breath. Lay your head on my chest. Let me hold you through the night. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The world can bring us down, but I still believe somehow it's all going to be all right. Come what may, the highs, the lows, well, this life will be hard, but you and me won't. When the waters rise and we face the fire, we'll rest in our foundation. Hand in hand on our knees. Nothing between us. You, me, and Jesus. [Music] Oh, we'll have a few fights. Who's wrong and who's right, but I want you to know &gt;&gt; at the end of the day, I'm always here to stay. Though, you'll never be alone. Come one day. The highs, the lows. Well, this life will be hard, but you and me won't. When the waters rise and we face the fire, we'll rest in our foundation. Hand in hand on our knees. The pin between us. You, me, and Jesus. Oh, come on. May the highs, the lows. Well, this life will be hard, but you and me won't. Oh, when it's time to say goodbye, we'll rest in our foundation. Hand in hand on our knees, nothing between us. Cuz in the end, even death could only lead us to you, me, and Jesus. Can we bow our heads together? Heavenly Father, only you would know the number of couples that have stood since the dawn of time to be joined together. Many of them with your blessing, many of them with your approval, many others without. But Lord, we're believing and praying today for your blessings to be upon Fred and Elias as they start their new life together. May the presence of God always be welcome in their home, in their lives. as the song has just expressed it for them to love each other. That's a wonderful thing. That's a human value, a human trait that we can do. People do it all the time without you in their lives. But Lord Jesus, how much greater it is when you are that one. I pray that you would help them. Give them love for each other. Dear God, give them forgiveness, understanding, all that they make out of life. May it be pleasing to you. We don't always look at a wedding maybe quite in the right way, but in reality when they step off of this platform here in a few minutes and they will be greeted in a little bit by family, friends, and loved ones smiling, hugging them, shaking their hands. But truthfully, they will enter into a battlefield, one like they've never fought before. Because these two hearts have be merged together. Fred has his ways, his makeup. Eliza has hers. Now they will come from him from his family, her from her family. He will bring a normal. She will bring a normal. And they will start creating a new one. And both of their families will look at it and say, "Well, we didn't do it that way in our house." And no, we didn't do it in our house either, but they're creating a new one. And Lord Jesus, what a new one it will be if you're the creating force there between them. For truly a marriage, if it's sent from God, is a new creation. Just in a few moments, I will make a pronouncement and give their new name. Eliza walked up here, Eliza Davis. But in a few moments, you will walk off of this platform with a new name. So may your grace and your mercy be with them. May your blessings be upon them, Father. We pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. For as much as Fred and Eliza have consented together on holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before God and this company by exchanging vows and exchanging rings. I pronounce they are man and wife in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. You may kiss your bride. [Applause] Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mus Frederick Art. God bless you. Heat.
