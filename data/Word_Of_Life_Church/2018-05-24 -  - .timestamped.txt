[27:21] Archer tonight how do I cycle a few
[27:28] weeks ago and I said I'm clean I'm too
[27:30] horse to sing and brother Marley when I
[27:32] went back he said I thought she was a
[27:34] horse I said well he came through the
[27:36] Lord came through a man it's one great
[27:53] wonderful thing about Jesus he's always
[27:55] faithful starting the first John chapter
[28:00] 5 if you would tonight first John
[28:03] chapter 5 verse 1 I want to speak to you
[28:08] tonight on the devil's picnic well you
[28:16] say I don't want to be in his picnic oh
[28:19] but you don't understand yet you don't
[28:23] understand you're the reason he's having
[28:27] it but after tonight I hope that we tear
[28:37] up his picnic
[28:41] first John chapter five verse one
[28:45] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[28:48] Christ is born of God and every one that
[28:53] loveth him that beget loveth him also
[28:58] that is begotten of him but this we know
[29:05] that we love the children of God when we
[29:09] love God and keep his Commandments for
[29:13] this is the love of God that we keep his
[29:18] Commandments people who say they love
[29:22] him and don't want to keep his word
[29:25] well there's one simple answer for that
[29:28] they are liars
[29:32] whether that's Mayor you deacons
[29:35] preachers trustees you know whoever Pope
[29:37] priests don't matter this is the love of
[29:41] God that we keep his Commandments now
[29:45] listen I love this part and His
[29:47] commandments are not Grievous the way of
[29:54] a transgressor is hard not the way of a
[29:57] real believer
[30:01] now let me say something you think I'm
[30:03] strange anyway but if there was no
[30:06] heaven or no hail I would not change one
[30:12] thing about the way I live I would want
[30:15] to be a Christian a child of God if
[30:17] there was no promise of a tomorrow there
[30:22] was no future home there was no castles
[30:24] no palaces no mansions I'm not serving
[30:28] him for that myself well you say I would
[30:31] not do this that another see it shows
[30:34] you're not right was gone because if you
[30:37] loved him you'd serve Him and live for
[30:40] him if at the end of the way he cast you
[30:42] away well this is the love of God that
[30:50] we keep his Commandments and His
[30:52] commandments are not Grievous and just
[30:55] in case you're wondering that's not the
[30:57] initial ten for whatsoever is born of
[31:04] God overcometh the world and this is the
[31:08] victory that overcometh the world even
[31:12] our faith now listen to this in a
[31:18] message called turning northward in 1961
[31:21] let's love one another don't fight one
[31:25] another as long as the devil's got you
[31:28] fighting one another he don't have to
[31:31] fight at all
[31:33] he will set back and has a picnic while
[31:41] only message folks have gave him a lot
[31:44] of opportunities for picnics he will set
[31:49] back and has a picnic now listen what
[31:52] his entertainment is now he sets back he
[31:55] has a picnic drinks whatever Devils
[31:57] drink and eats whatever Devils eat their
[31:59] picnics but his form of entertainment
[32:03] at the picnic is us he don't have to
[32:12] fight at all he will sit back and has a
[32:14] picnic watching you fighting one another
[32:21] what better entertainment could Satan
[32:25] have than children of God fightin each
[32:29] other there's nothing he loves any
[32:34] better nothing any more fun nothing any
[32:37] more entertaining that's pitiful
[32:44] I've give him a few chances for picnics
[32:48] don't sit down look at me like you know
[32:50] what I'm talking about you have to
[32:52] listen to this now he will set back and
[32:54] has a picnic watching you fighting one
[32:58] another and the life that's you
[33:02] professing to have the Holy Ghost and
[33:10] fighting one another
[33:13] oh I'm mad already I'll tell you what I
[33:22] found that this week
[33:23] I just got pong mad I wouldn't mad at
[33:26] you when necessary mad at me I got mad
[33:28] at the devil never got mad at me and I
[33:31] got mad at you think of the children we
[33:38] could dismiss and go home and say wow
[33:40] but let's not I think we might want to
[33:43] stay around for a bit he don't have to
[33:47] fight at all he will sit back and has a
[33:48] picnic watching you fight one another
[33:51] and life it's you professing to have the
[33:55] Holy Ghost and fighting one another why
[33:59] would he laugh at that cuz he knows it's
[34:01] totally impossible for you to have the
[34:04] real Holy Ghost and constantly fighting
[34:10] let's pray together Lord Jesus we thank
[34:17] you to not father for the reading of
[34:20] your word we're so grateful Lord Jesus
[34:23] that you came to this world to care for
[34:29] us to love us to be able to help us Lord
[34:34] God I pray that you would speak to our
[34:37] hearts tonight
[34:38] help me that I can get out of the way
[34:40] and help the people that they can be
[34:43] able to get out of the way as well to
[34:44] hear Lord Jesus we certainly needs you
[34:49] with all of our hearts
[34:51] take the word tonight anoint us I pray
[34:55] that we can be able to receive father in
[34:57] Jesus name Amen god bless you may be
[35:01] seated
[35:09] Hemis ever been on a picnic a picnic can
[35:17] take place in different places sometimes
[35:22] folks go to the mountains sometimes they
[35:25] go down to the lake or they go to a
[35:27] beautiful serene spot that they think is
[35:31] so pretty and so calm maybe a lake could
[35:35] be a Creek River rushing water or from
[35:39] over steel-type person just the
[35:41] trickling of a fall but yet it is there
[35:45] for you to be able to relax and enjoy
[35:49] those that are with you the food that
[35:52] you have brought the drink that you've
[35:54] brought to be able to pull off the job a
[35:58] little bit get away from the worries and
[36:00] troubles of life most of us think of a
[36:03] picnic as something enjoyable pleasant
[36:07] it's not something that myself that I
[36:11] would think about the devil ever having
[36:14] a picnic and you realize it's a
[36:17] metaphorical saying it is a pair of
[36:19] parable that it is a earthly saying with
[36:23] a heavenly meaning so when you think
[36:26] about the devil ever wanting to have a
[36:29] picnic a gathering to where he can be
[36:33] able to rest as it was to be able to
[36:37] have a form of entertainment to get him
[36:41] from the every Dre's everyday stress of
[36:44] life of being the biggest liar that ever
[36:46] left the one has caused the most trouble
[36:50] of all that's ever lived down through
[36:53] time so every now and then he wants a
[36:57] little relaxing time to have a picnic so
[37:02] he chooses the most ideal setting Satan
[37:07] don't go to a bar for a picnic he
[37:10] doesn't go to a strip club for a picnic
[37:12] he doesn't go to any world he sings and
[37:16] all that sort of thing but he loves
[37:19] Church and he loves the homes of
[37:24] Christians and the workplace
[37:27] of Christians so Satan chooses for his
[37:33] favorite spots for the ideal place for a
[37:36] picnic around children of God
[37:39] now you think why in the world what do
[37:42] you want that kind of a setting because
[37:44] to get them upset to get them fussing
[37:49] arguing debating hating that gives him
[37:54] more laughs than anything in this world
[37:57] Oh Satan thinks it's funny when people
[38:02] they'll talk him into drinking and then
[38:04] he'll give him cirrhosis of the liver
[38:06] he thinks it's absolutely marvelous
[38:09] he'll talk people into smoking when
[38:11] they're 12 13 years old they become
[38:13] addicted and then he kills him with
[38:16] cancer they take their first lick of
[38:19] dope marijuana whatever it is I thinks
[38:21] it's hilarious that they become so bound
[38:24] by that they would sell their body they
[38:26] would sell their mother in order to get
[38:29] a fix he thinks that's wonderful but
[38:32] there is nothing that gives him the joy
[38:36] like children of God
[38:38] fighting it's just something beyond
[38:43] explanation to the devil it brings him
[38:47] such a static joy and pleasure he just
[38:52] laughs and lives and all if you could
[38:55] just see him double over and just
[38:58] holding as sad as it were when the
[39:00] children of God had claimed to be born
[39:03] again and have the Holy Ghost become
[39:06] bitter and hateful and contrary and hate
[39:10] one another ah
[39:14] so in Satan can find that in the life of
[39:17] a Christian or he can find it in a
[39:20] church or it can find it in a move a
[39:23] move of God here Satan decides to have a
[39:28] picnic
[39:30] now some picnics of course are held at
[39:33] parks that picnic tables are provided
[39:36] for you till where you go then you and
[39:39] your family decide well let's pick this
[39:41] table over here Oh Matt's a nice setting
[39:43] if you're a shade person or sudden
[39:45] person and then you'll pick out
[39:46] whichever one you want some of them have
[39:48] a little small grill then you brought
[39:50] your little hamburgers and your hot dogs
[39:52] or your Bologna or whatever you're gonna
[39:54] do and you'll sit there and you spread
[39:56] out a tablecloth on this concrete table
[39:58] or wood table and you'll take your nice
[40:00] favorite colored tablecloth your little
[40:03] red white checkered one or your blue and
[40:05] white checkered one and you lay it all
[40:07] out and my other wife drags out
[40:09] everything out of the basket and you go
[40:11] to lay everything with your plastic
[40:12] forks and your plastic knives item
[40:14] things don't you and you go to cut in
[40:16] your first cucumber and snap it breaks
[40:18] off but you say ah this is a picnic it
[40:21] don't matter
[40:22] nah I'm all for working and we left the
[40:25] kids with mother-in-law and all they
[40:27] let's have a great time the Flies are
[40:33] flying in your face people over here
[40:35] screaming kids over there run and you
[40:37] said this is so wonderful
[40:39] we're having a great time it's a picnic
[40:43] you have no thermostat to control the
[40:46] temperature you'll sit there and sweat
[40:47] if you've done that in church you'd be
[40:49] as mad as a Hornet but yet it's a picnic
[40:52] so we tolerate things but can you
[40:56] imagine Satan now he wants to have a
[40:59] picnic so he packs his lunch and here he
[41:03] comes and he says now where can I have
[41:06] my picnic today would it be the Weber's
[41:09] home will it be the Williams home what
[41:16] about the Philips home that might be a
[41:18] good place the walkers the Reagan's the
[41:21] Babs I'm gonna get on sharing a little
[41:24] bit to say hello something a little
[41:26] quicker harsh to Linda that's a perfect
[41:29] picnic setting I'll spread out my little
[41:32] blue and white cause you know light red
[41:33] the color blood I'll spread out my
[41:35] little blue and white tablecloth and
[41:36] I'll sit down and Jim will say some
[41:39] and then Lindo say something and then
[41:40] they'll start back and forth and I'll
[41:42] anoint boss I'm concerned no way they're
[41:44] gonna be beat she'll not let him get the
[41:46] last word iam and he'll death and not
[41:48] get her last word and I'll sit there and
[41:50] I'll just see my devil sandwiches of
[41:52] course he likes deviled eggs I suppose
[41:53] he'll sit I need his sandwiches and Greg
[41:55] one of the devil drinks and he'll just
[41:57] anoint them back and forth back and
[41:59] forth back a moral and he is dying
[42:00] laughing and this is so wonderful
[42:03] because they're both Christians and they
[42:07] both got the Holy Ghost and their boats
[42:08] are born again and they were from the
[42:10] greatest message that's ever been on the
[42:12] earth and they got piece of passeth
[42:16] understanding joy unspeakable full of
[42:18] glory but they're behaving like children
[42:28] the devil's picnic Satan loves Klamath
[42:35] he loves destruction he loves anxiety
[42:41] sorrow bitterness hatefulness
[42:45] contrariness he does not love divine
[42:49] love Satan King love he does not enjoy
[42:52] peace now if you would allow Satan to be
[42:57] able to lay out all of his beautiful
[42:59] condiments in order to have a wonderful
[43:02] picnic at your place and all of a sudden
[43:04] in the middle of this argument you
[43:06] realize wait a minute you know what we
[43:09] done we just invited the devil to have a
[43:13] picnic in our house
[43:16] what if in the middle of your argument
[43:19] with your brother or your sister or your
[43:21] wife or whatever it is you realize what
[43:23] you have just done you have just created
[43:26] a perfect atmosphere for the devil's
[43:29] picnic and if in the middle of that you
[43:32] realize Lord God forgive us forgive us
[43:35] and you grab your wife by the hand and
[43:37] kneel down right down on the couch
[43:39] all right there in the chair summer and
[43:40] you go to pray it and you pray and pray
[43:42] until you break through and the son
[43:44] and the strange language I guarantee you
[43:46] one thing if you could hear the devil's
[43:48] getting his little ditty bag together
[43:50] he's bunching all his stuff up in his
[43:52] basket and he's leaving the báb house
[43:54] and he's going to find out if there's
[43:56] anybody else at Happy Valley that he can
[43:59] have a picnic in their house but of
[44:06] course our rights are so important to us
[44:10] no one is going to cross us and get by I
[44:13] would imagine for a lot of the Saints in
[44:16] Happy Valley Satan has a hard time
[44:19] working in all the picnics among all the
[44:23] opportunities I'm not sure if the devil
[44:27] can have picnic on Facebook but if he
[44:29] can I'm sure that he's up 24/7 just
[44:32] keeping their Facebook picnics all of
[44:36] course in the love of God
[44:38] now what's whenever the new burst comes
[44:42] into an individual it changes them and
[44:45] makes him so different than the word
[44:48] they were before they were born again
[44:50] and John by the Spirit of God had such
[44:54] an understanding in looking at this
[44:56] Watson now chapter 5 verse 1 he said
[44:58] whosoever believe us that Jesus is the
[45:02] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[45:05] loved us him that began levels him also
[45:09] that is begotten of him now yet to be
[45:12] very careful in looking at this word
[45:14] because especially in the modern concept
[45:16] of the way that people are taking the
[45:18] word believe or believing or believe us
[45:21] and they look at it as merely an
[45:24] intellectual conception or believing
[45:26] that God so loved the world he gave His
[45:28] only begotten Son then by believing that
[45:30] mentally they accept it that way but
[45:33] when you look at the root word of
[45:35] believers and of faith it is pista sin
[45:38] the Greek which is not only a noun or
[45:41] something that you accept on the basis
[45:44] of substance but it actually is
[45:46] connected with a verb which places it in
[45:49] action so it's not just what you say you
[45:52] believe but it's the way you live
[45:54] you live out what you say you are
[45:57] believing now watch he says whosoever
[46:00] believe us that Jesus is the Christ is
[46:03] born of God so what is Christ
[46:05] it is Christos it is not enough to
[46:07] believe merely that Jesus is the Son of
[46:10] God that's important but notice what
[46:13] John said he that believeth that Jesus
[46:15] is the Christ he didn't say that
[46:17] believes that Jesus is the Son of God
[46:19] but Jesus is the Christ what does that
[46:22] involve Jesus was a prophet he was the
[46:26] son of God but he's also our King now in
[46:28] the concept of Christ which is crystals
[46:31] or messiahs it is all the anointed
[46:34] perspective of the office of the Lord
[46:36] Jesus so sons and seonhwa I said Jesus
[46:39] as the Son of God but do you accept him
[46:41] as your priest do you accept him as your
[46:44] king do you accept them as your
[46:46] all-in-all and then if you do not you
[46:49] are truly not born again yet but he
[46:52] whosoever believeth that Jesus is not
[46:54] was but it is the cross he is your
[46:57] Christ so it's not only your Savior but
[47:00] he is currently your priest he is also
[47:02] your Lord he is your master he is your
[47:05] king now those are the ones that are
[47:08] truly born again their will that they
[47:09] will be outnumbered a million to one
[47:12] as far as those that believe in the mind
[47:14] intellectually that Jesus is the Son of
[47:17] God yet they do not make him King they
[47:19] do not make him Lord they do not make
[47:21] him the Anointed Prince over their life
[47:24] they simply what is most of the world's
[47:26] the church was confession I believe
[47:28] Jesus is the Son of God he is the son of
[47:30] God that's important but that's not what
[47:32] all John said you must believe Jesus is
[47:36] the Christ I want him to be my Savior
[47:38] but I want him to be my Lord I want him
[47:41] to be my king I want him to be my ruler
[47:45] you as well know us whosoever believeth
[47:49] that Jesus is the Christ is born of God
[47:52] now the term born of God is kind of it's
[47:54] isolated actually by john the divine and
[47:57] he only uses that in the latter years of
[47:58] his ministry doesn't use it when he
[48:00] writes a epistle of john but he uses
[48:03] that after now he's been on the Isle of
[48:05] Patmos and
[48:06] has these great visions and visitations
[48:07] from God if you notice in first John 3:9
[48:10] he said whosoever is born of God now
[48:13] Peter doesn't use these terms Paul
[48:15] doesn't use these terms John alone uses
[48:17] his term born of God whosoever is born
[48:20] of God does not commit sin for his seed
[48:23] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[48:26] because he is born of God and the church
[48:29] said first John 4:7 beloved let us love
[48:32] one another for love is of God every one
[48:36] that loveth is born of God and knoweth
[48:39] God chapter five verse one again
[48:41] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[48:44] Christ is born of God so that means that
[48:46] everybody that believes Jesus is the Son
[48:48] of God they're born again careful
[48:51] careful
[48:52] once again verse verse for whatsoever is
[48:56] born of God overcometh the world oh so
[49:00] you can't just profess I believe Jesus
[49:01] is the Son of God if you're born of God
[49:04] you will overcome the world not maybe
[49:07] not perhaps I'm trying no it's not I'm
[49:09] trying
[49:10] you will verse 18 we know that whosoever
[49:17] is born of God sent us not but he that
[49:22] is begotten of God keeps us himself how
[49:25] in the world is that possible he keeps
[49:28] himself how by the power of God in him
[49:31] and that wicked one touches him not now
[49:35] watch this word believe it back to
[49:37] chapter five verse one whosoever believe
[49:40] us that Jesus is the Christ is born of
[49:43] God look at the word it is pissed you
[49:46] commit to ones trust notice nothing
[49:49] about your intellectual conception at
[49:52] all it's not about what you accept it's
[49:55] not about the intellectual part I said
[49:57] that in my mind I confess it with my
[50:00] mouth and therefore it's done that's not
[50:02] even the word John used look at the word
[50:05] whosoever believe us commit to one's
[50:08] trust
[50:08] be committed unto - think to be true use
[50:13] in the New Testament of the conviction
[50:15] and Trust to what a man is
[50:17] felled by a certain inner and higher
[50:20] prerogative and law of soul to entrust
[50:25] our saying to his fidelity to be
[50:29] entrusted with a say-so whosoever
[50:31] believe us
[50:32] it's not your intellectual conception oh
[50:34] I accept them as my savior you've known
[50:37] him on first base yet whosoever believes
[50:40] you believe in so much you commit
[50:43] everything your trust your fidelity
[50:46] everything you are that's a real
[50:48] believer
[50:50] praise the Lord Jesus now it is not even
[50:54] the proper meaning of the word which by
[50:56] which many theologians and preachers and
[50:57] teachers now Scout to the place it's in
[50:59] the message as well because it's an easy
[51:01] believe ISM to our person just believes
[51:04] and they accept and they believe it
[51:06] doesn't require anything it requires a
[51:08] no walk
[51:09] it requires no consecration to God
[51:10] because God knows nobody's perfect
[51:12] anyway and while I'll make mistakes we
[51:14] all do wrong that's a good modern gospel
[51:16] but it's not the Bible so the core
[51:20] meaning men of the root of this word is
[51:22] actually as a totus pissis in the Greek
[51:25] it is a personal relationship
[51:27] established my trust and trustworthiness
[51:31] it's not just trust alone but trust and
[51:35] trustworthiness so it's not believing in
[51:38] an historical Jesus that should pick up
[51:41] the Bible and you learn all the stories
[51:44] and Jesus He healed the sick and raise
[51:46] the dead he's done all these wonderful
[51:48] things Alma I believe that's true
[51:50] I believe that's true but it's never
[51:52] been made real to you faith in Him is
[51:59] abandoning our own will our own ideas
[52:03] our own abilities and trusting totally
[52:08] in him which is so hard for us to death
[52:12] now watch
[52:14] Peter believed but he didn't have a new
[52:17] birth Matthew chapter 16 verse 15 and he
[52:21] says unto them but whom say ye that I am
[52:26] and he says unto them whom say
[52:29] the disciples that I am and Simon Peter
[52:32] answered and said thou art the Christ
[52:37] now what
[52:39] John says whosoever believe us that
[52:42] Jesus is the Christ is born of God
[52:49] Peter seemingly matches that verse of
[52:53] scripture and he does from here but not
[52:57] here
[52:58] now what's Simon Peter answered and said
[53:01] thou the Christ the Son of the Living
[53:07] God
[53:08] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[53:10] art thou simon barjona flesh and blood
[53:12] has not revealed it unto thee but my
[53:16] father which is in heaven he had a real
[53:21] revelation but he wasn't born again he
[53:25] believed Jesus was a cross but he turned
[53:28] out to be a cussing preacher and naked
[53:32] on top of that but yet he believed he
[53:36] had a revelation praise the Lord
[53:40] what's this in the Greek text the word
[53:42] believe is present tense I love this
[53:46] indicating a present continuing activity
[53:50] the word born is in the perfect tense
[53:55] the perfect tense indicates a past event
[54:00] was continuing consequences the God
[54:07] thank you Lord Jesus now to us as
[54:10] English people even you know we would
[54:11] make that much difference at all but
[54:13] whenever you realize the way the
[54:14] scripture was written and the Spirit of
[54:16] God moving on those men to use the
[54:18] proper word then we bring it over into
[54:21] our thinking and we totally reshape it
[54:24] by our thinking and then we wonder why
[54:26] the word don't work it does work but
[54:28] it's placed in this proper place
[54:30] now what's the perfect tense of the word
[54:34] born in indicates a past event was
[54:37] continuing consequences in other words
[54:40] our present continuing activity of
[54:43] believing is the results and therefore
[54:46] the evidence of our past experience of
[54:49] new births by which we become and remain
[54:52] God's children this is why real believer
[54:57] will never stumble at any truth this
[54:59] reveals now that they struggle in this
[55:01] way when they share - oh my oh my I
[55:03] don't understand it all now but a real
[55:05] seat of God will keep him right on going
[55:07] why they are born of God other people
[55:10] will come up to a certain doctor in a
[55:12] certain trend and they'll go that far
[55:14] and they'll never make it over the top
[55:16] of that why they lack a new verse the
[55:18] Holy Ghost will never stop at anything
[55:21] that's revealed in his word he came he
[55:23] wrote it so to be born of God what is it
[55:28] the perfect test it is something that is
[55:30] ongoing in our lives even this knife if
[55:33] you've got a new verse and you're
[55:35] sitting in this place and you're born of
[55:37] God when the word brings something to
[55:39] you it will quicken that to you lighten
[55:41] in this very surface know what's in
[55:48] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[55:51] Christ is born of God and when a burst
[55:55] takes place the individual that is born
[56:00] is not born into a world of isolation
[56:04] they are not born into a place of total
[56:07] solitude - were there the only one that
[56:11] has ever been born now think of this
[56:13] when you weren't born you might have
[56:16] been the first morning I was in my
[56:17] family but yet I was not born into a
[56:20] world of solitude that was already been
[56:23] millions and millions of human beings
[56:26] that had lived on the earth and that had
[56:28] come by the same way that I had come by
[56:30] birth so it did not burst me into a room
[56:33] or a sphere where I was the only one
[56:36] there I was born into the family of the
[56:38] Reagan's I was born into the family of
[56:41] humanity
[56:43] well I wonder how that works with an
[56:46] uber said when we're born again into the
[56:49] family of God and yet we want to get
[56:52] this concept assess in our for and no
[56:54] more on our church and the one who gets
[56:56] our revelations are the one who streams
[56:58] our services OMA for one thing when
[57:05] you're born into this family there are
[57:07] shared traits and characteristics that
[57:11] mark you this being a Reagan or whatever
[57:14] you are now whenever you come in into
[57:17] this family
[57:17] you're a born out after the law of God's
[57:20] natural of reproduction but you're not
[57:22] the first one there more than likely you
[57:24] won't be the last one there so you are
[57:26] born into something that already pre
[57:28] existed before you came and no doubt it
[57:31] will be there would you leave this
[57:32] mortal realm now when we look at the
[57:34] burst of the air of the seed into the
[57:36] family of God we were certainly not the
[57:39] first ones to be born into the family
[57:40] and if the Lord tarries will not be the
[57:42] last ones that will be born and with
[57:44] that comes what a responsibility that we
[57:48] are born into a move of God so what gets
[57:52] among us in that wants us to isolate
[57:54] ourselves from everybody else in that
[57:56] same move we have no fellowship with no
[57:58] other church we have no confidence and
[58:00] nobody else but one preacher you're on
[58:02] dangerous ground if Satan can get you
[58:05] down to one preacher all he's got to do
[58:06] is come between you and that one
[58:08] preacher and you're finished Oh Lord
[58:14] Jesus and another thing that whenever
[58:17] you're born into the human family you
[58:20] have traits and characteristics of those
[58:23] who are your paternal parents now you
[58:26] may have certain things about you go
[58:28] suck your father certain things about
[58:30] they don't like her mother it could even
[58:32] be an uncle maybe you had a redheaded
[58:33] uncle my my years and years back
[58:35] your mama's black head and your daddy's
[58:37] brown headed all of a sudden you come
[58:39] out of there look around her an Irishman
[58:40] or something nothing lower than mercy
[58:42] what in the world is that what it was a
[58:43] gene of someone that came down and there
[58:46] you are
[58:46] the refraction of someone behind you so
[58:49] you know we bear the characteristics and
[58:51] the traits of that but
[58:52] we so struggle then with the spiritual
[58:55] sense of being morning the family of God
[58:57] we want everybody to be identical to us
[59:02] the music's gotta be like ours they're
[59:05] singers like ours
[59:06] they've definitely got to preach like
[59:07] Donnie regular let's hurry on the move
[59:09] of God
[59:10] friends you realize that's the spirit of
[59:12] organization we're born into a family
[59:16] some of our brothers and sisters in this
[59:19] family are Africans
[59:20] some are Filipinos summer Asians some
[59:23] are American Indians some are all kinds
[59:25] of folks they're never all going to be
[59:26] exactly like us thank God that worship
[59:29] will be different the manner and style
[59:31] of preaching will be different I think
[59:33] it's a sign of growing up that we can
[59:35] finally recognize God moves beyond our
[59:37] four walls I hate to say it but
[59:49] preachers are a lot of the ones that are
[59:51] guilty for giving the devil a lot of
[59:53] grounds for picnics well praise the Lord
[59:58] there ain't any preachers your all
[1:00:00] of them say man it ain't like you're
[1:00:01] outnumbered I mean y'all fifty to one
[1:00:04] the preachers so that's an answer so
[1:00:06] whenever a person is born then into the
[1:00:09] economy of God they're born under what
[1:00:12] attribute they are born we know not you
[1:00:15] when we're born Sates you know the 1956
[1:00:17] when I was born there was a certain
[1:00:19] planetary alignment also stars and it
[1:00:21] set my birth paths in a certain certain
[1:00:23] way it set my nature in a certain way it
[1:00:26] would affect me all of my life even
[1:00:28] though I tried to be born again and have
[1:00:30] a new nature and then the c-team would
[1:00:32] be quicker on the Spirit of God but
[1:00:34] there would be certain things I hear I'm
[1:00:35] born in a certain time Carol born
[1:00:37] exactly the same date map up in the day
[1:00:39] but yet something a little different
[1:00:41] made her a different personality and
[1:00:43] it's the same way with the family of God
[1:00:45] that we could be born into the family of
[1:00:47] God some will be really emotional my
[1:00:49] they've had search a faint not to fuse
[1:00:51] them others that they can't stand that
[1:00:53] said that's so most noisy their favorite
[1:00:55] scriptures be still and know that I'm
[1:00:57] God
[1:01:05] I'm the oldest of seven kids named none
[1:01:09] of us identical we first we fought we
[1:01:16] clawed one another's eyes out we call
[1:01:18] one other names we made fun of one
[1:01:21] another we we attached all kinds of
[1:01:24] nicknames to each other which some of
[1:01:27] them still carry to this day and you now
[1:01:30] kids can be they can be very cruel
[1:01:32] children can be very cool come on now it
[1:01:36] shows you although the message folks
[1:01:38] really are still their children no
[1:01:41] matter how long they've been around
[1:01:42] they're still children what's their
[1:01:44] behavior they act like spoiled children
[1:01:46] they don't get their way they throw that
[1:01:49] for spinning us know it's bad if it's a
[1:01:51] lay person it's worse if it's a deacon
[1:01:53] it's horrible if it's a pastor now all
[1:01:57] of us no matter what position if
[1:01:59] spiritually we're still affected by this
[1:02:01] and even though we're born into the
[1:02:03] economy of God he does not strip the
[1:02:05] genes out of us naturally he does not
[1:02:07] shut the burst path out of us naturally
[1:02:09] we're left in this body to still deal
[1:02:12] with all these negative aspects but
[1:02:21] every child of God has spiritual birth
[1:02:26] marks y'all know what birth marks are
[1:02:30] don't see every child of God has birth
[1:02:36] marks what marks it was phoned on you
[1:02:40] and your mother was carrying it was one
[1:02:42] of my siblings has a mark on their body
[1:02:44] but a certain event happened to my
[1:02:46] mother and it marked their body but we
[1:02:51] have other marks it brings our first
[1:02:54] subject but the last verse mark of a
[1:02:58] child of God will be the body change
[1:03:05] how much earlier into this is Johnson
[1:03:08] riding this in chapter 2 and chapter 3
[1:03:10] as it begins to emphasize on the love of
[1:03:12] God in chapter 4 he shows us that the
[1:03:15] characteristics of a child of God are
[1:03:18] being born into this economy of God and
[1:03:21] they will certainly walk in truth they
[1:03:23] will certainly dress a certain way and
[1:03:25] they'll certainly have lots of things
[1:03:26] about them that will be markers as far
[1:03:29] as the Christian but one of the greatest
[1:03:31] things that John is emphasizing here is
[1:03:33] love now I know this is a very confusing
[1:03:36] a lot of folks and folks of life to this
[1:03:37] series that I've been preaching at and
[1:03:39] making fun of it some of the message
[1:03:40] folks have because I don't think it's
[1:03:42] very deep they think that I'm talking
[1:03:44] about what everybody out here is as far
[1:03:46] as what I'm talking about
[1:03:48] divine love I'm not talking about this
[1:03:52] Oh a gooey marshmallow creamy stuff that
[1:03:55] Smathers all over everybody's face I'm
[1:03:57] talking about divine love that separates
[1:03:59] you from the world but makes you hate
[1:04:02] sin but love the sinner that's right now
[1:04:09] what John wants to bring this out and
[1:04:12] show that the love of God becomes the
[1:04:14] fixed point about which it is your North
[1:04:16] Pole as it was it is a pivotal point of
[1:04:19] your life by which you will start being
[1:04:21] navigated and controlled from that point
[1:04:23] on now we know that God wants to place
[1:04:26] something there within us that'll change
[1:04:28] this forever so it's wonderful part
[1:04:29] about it is that it'll change this
[1:04:30] forever so to be born of God is to be
[1:04:33] born into the family of God and we have
[1:04:36] the name of the father of the family
[1:04:37] over this household though it is a
[1:04:39] mystical body yet were born into it
[1:04:41] individually but yet we're born into it
[1:04:43] in the sense of what we're all members
[1:04:45] of the same body so how could I find
[1:04:48] bored of the Spirit of God and you're
[1:04:49] born the Spirit of God ever hates you or
[1:04:53] how could you ever hate me when the same
[1:04:55] father began us both
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:05:01] and you want to ask me if all my
[1:05:04] brothers and sisters got along together
[1:05:05] I don't told you we did y'all have any
[1:05:10] brothers and sisters Oh y'all have
[1:05:13] perfect Club and your family liar liar
[1:05:15] liar but yet you let somebody pick on
[1:05:22] one of their brothers and sisters my my
[1:05:26] my sister Tammy I'll still bear scars in
[1:05:29] my face where she called me and
[1:05:31] scratched me
[1:05:32] but somebody picked on me one day and a
[1:05:35] bus because I never could fight I always
[1:05:37] hated fighting and somebody picked on me
[1:05:39] on one day on the bus and I just hit my
[1:05:42] head and that guy was beating me on the
[1:05:43] head and pounded me like a drum cuz I
[1:05:46] just never could fight I know y'all
[1:05:48] don't believe that it's a truth I just
[1:05:51] never I couldn't stand fighting
[1:05:53] Tammy lit into him told him in the bug
[1:05:56] bites he was begging for mercy time she
[1:06:03] got up and a couple of days she leaned
[1:06:07] into me the same way and that amazing
[1:06:14] how whenever you see your brother that
[1:06:16] would be under something you go to his
[1:06:18] defense and yet you can be the very one
[1:06:20] also who would do the very same thing to
[1:06:23] him it's amazing and it's what our
[1:06:25] perception of love and loyalty know that
[1:06:27] is but when you think now that we look
[1:06:29] beyond the natural genealogy and we look
[1:06:32] and see that John said whosoever loveth
[1:06:34] him that begat levels him also that is
[1:06:38] begotten so every Christian every true
[1:06:40] born-again Christian you love those who
[1:06:43] are born of the Spirit of God have you
[1:06:45] said well how am I gonna know how am I
[1:06:47] gonna know oh so you got such a little
[1:06:50] love then you get a predetermine if
[1:06:52] they're born again for you or not
[1:06:53] you need another baptism
[1:06:57] I said you need another baptism God so
[1:07:00] loved the world the cows mops the world
[1:07:02] Lord that gave me something begun sir
[1:07:03] he loves the sinners he loves the
[1:07:06] homosexuals he don't love what they do
[1:07:08] he loves harlots prostitutes drugs drug
[1:07:10] addicts now can you imagine a son here
[1:07:16] that's born in a family he's got brown
[1:07:21] hair blue eyes whatever structures one
[1:07:24] size and his brother blonde hair green
[1:07:28] eyes smaller thin well then the bigger
[1:07:33] one would use himself that these people
[1:07:34] do that use himself as example and say
[1:07:36] don't look like me I don't believe
[1:07:39] you're a born of daddy and Mama
[1:07:41] you must be adopted one of my sisters we
[1:07:49] used to kid her that way when she's
[1:07:51] little we used to tell her all the time
[1:07:53] she was adopted
[1:07:55] poor little thing she'd cry and cry and
[1:07:58] cry why she didn't want to feel like
[1:08:02] she's the doctor is there anybody here
[1:08:03] wants to feel like you're not a member
[1:08:05] of the family of God he said anybody who
[1:08:07] wants to fill out that you're not one of
[1:08:08] those beloved ones or the Lord that
[1:08:10] would break your heart and mine too Wow
[1:08:12] we want to feel that we're special in
[1:08:14] his eyes and you are but you look at the
[1:08:18] love of God then being born into the
[1:08:20] family for not careful we will fuss and
[1:08:22] fight and rip and tear and hate and we
[1:08:29] are sending the devil

[1:10:23] catch them I don't know how that works
[1:10:24] in fishing I don't figure weren't you
[1:10:25] good though praise the Lord we want to
[1:10:29] clean them up wash your face up with a
[1:10:30] dress something that look God can save a
[1:10:32] woman in a past skin tight shorts God
[1:10:35] could save a man a big old burly
[1:10:38] looking outfit with earrings hanging
[1:10:40] down his nose out of his ears out of his
[1:10:42] eyeballs everywhere else God could save
[1:10:44] that man and then clean him out that for
[1:10:46] man want some he say man who hates his
[1:10:55] brother does not love God
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:05] my is Clyde on me listen what brother
[1:11:10] Ben says about loving one another the
[1:11:12] love of God sealed in your heart pressed
[1:11:15] in until all the world is pressed out
[1:11:17] and you see nothing but the Lord to love
[1:11:20] him and as you love one another you love
[1:11:25] the Lord and if you don't love one
[1:11:29] another you can't love the Lord
[1:11:34] Vince theater said this is not an option
[1:11:36] it's impossible
[1:11:38] if we don't love one another we cannot
[1:11:40] love the Lord right
[1:11:42] what's this again assess you'll never
[1:11:44] come up in the kingdom of God until the
[1:11:46] Holy Spirit is sealed you in the kingdom
[1:11:48] of God by divine love the whole
[1:11:50] Christian world is your brother and
[1:11:52] sister that's right the world sealed out
[1:11:55] in God sealed in when you love one
[1:11:57] another truly with divine Christian love
[1:12:03] then you know the Holy Spirit is really
[1:12:06] working through you then now when you
[1:12:08] speak in tongues not when you say you
[1:12:10] accept the prophet not when you say you
[1:12:11] believe the message when divine love is
[1:12:14] working through you praise God
[1:12:18] thank you Lord Jesus love one another
[1:12:21] above everything that you do love one
[1:12:23] another
[1:12:23] you love one another you'll love God see
[1:12:26] you love each other and you'll love God
[1:12:28] for god is love
[1:12:29] and a man that walks in love walks in
[1:12:32] life and perfect love casteth out all
[1:12:35] fear this is the kind of environment -
[1:12:39] Satan hates in a family this is the kind
[1:12:42] of environment that Satan hates in a
[1:12:44] church it's the kind of environment that
[1:12:46] he hates in a move of God it's a kind of
[1:12:48] environment he hates in an individual
[1:12:52] but if the church that family that
[1:12:54] individuals got bitterness and hatred
[1:12:56] and envy and strife you have set up a
[1:12:59] permanent picnic table
[1:13:04] a lot of us are such professionals have
[1:13:08] thrown a picnic for the devil we provide
[1:13:09] the meat the bread the drinks the french
[1:13:11] fries even the dessert we've got
[1:13:17] everything everything conducive for
[1:13:20] Satan's picnic kept us all floored kept
[1:13:29] us off I want you to notice this brother
[1:13:33] BAM follow this thought there's hundreds
[1:13:35] and hundreds of these quotes but I'll
[1:13:36] read you just a few but he follows the
[1:13:38] same thought all through the entirety of
[1:13:40] the message from the very beginning all
[1:13:42] the way to the very end
[1:13:43] what is fatherhood it's an attribute of
[1:13:45] God then if we be God's children then
[1:13:47] God wants us to love one another in
[1:13:49] doing so we love God teach you see you
[1:13:52] cannot divide loving God and loving the
[1:13:56] brothers now you can generally disagree
[1:14:00] that don't mean you agree with everybody
[1:14:01] but the thing of it is you can bitterly
[1:14:03] disagree and love them just as much when
[1:14:06] you get done which most human beings
[1:14:09] cannot I've had disagreements with
[1:14:15] preachers all over the world the message
[1:14:17] and with many of them when you do
[1:14:19] they'll never treat you the same again I
[1:14:22] don't care how great a man can preach
[1:14:24] there's something lacking in his life
[1:14:29] don't get scared
[1:14:31] preachers have got to line up to the
[1:14:32] words if a preacher cannot disagree that
[1:14:35] the preacher and still feel the same in
[1:14:37] his heart there's something wrong with
[1:14:39] that perjure that Deacon that matter
[1:14:41] that father you mean whoever it is the
[1:14:44] word of God declares friends we must
[1:14:46] love him and we must love his image in
[1:14:49] others
[1:14:51] mmm notices brother em says if you can't
[1:14:54] love one another
[1:14:55] how you gonna love God who you haven't
[1:14:58] seen love hides a multitude of sin get
[1:15:02] in love with God then you'll love one
[1:15:04] another all my then you love the church
[1:15:08] you love the coals okay sir I love God I
[1:15:14] love the Prophet

[1:15:46] trip you got this you're watching you
[1:15:47] watch all my 5:07 brother Lewis Center

[1:15:52] ten extra seven one once they're doing
[1:15:53] that wonder what they're doing that a
[1:15:55] real child of God never gets away from
[1:15:57] church cause a entire wise part of their
[1:15:59] life Isis your home and reflection down
[1:16:02] your what are we doing we're gathering
[1:16:04] here tonight there's an an attire of our
[1:16:06] future homeland we will gather around
[1:16:08] that reveal life for eternity
[1:16:11] and we love one another because I love
[1:16:14] him
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:17] notice it's love hides a multitude of
[1:16:20] sin get in love with God then you love
[1:16:21] one another
[1:16:22] you'll love the church you'll love the
[1:16:24] calls you'll love everything that's God
[1:16:27] in you keep away from the things of the
[1:16:29] world notice this as we go on how to
[1:16:32] unfold right on down through this he
[1:16:33] said if you get your place well I
[1:16:35] couldn't put my arm around any brother
[1:16:37] that's working for the kingdom of God
[1:16:39] and recognize him as my brother I feel
[1:16:42] I'm back slid I'd be scared to stand on
[1:16:49] the platform and face evil spirits to
[1:16:51] know that I had Envy in my heart against
[1:16:55] any brother in the Saints then can you
[1:17:02] imagine what a picnic grand aperture can
[1:17:04] be a preacher who has more chances for
[1:17:09] complexes than he the other person on
[1:17:12] the earth you folks can interrupt his
[1:17:16] meals you can interrupt these plans you
[1:17:19] can interrupt everything about him and
[1:17:21] he's to drop whatever he's doing at your
[1:17:23] beck and call and if he don't he's that
[1:17:27] dab off and you spend years of your life
[1:17:30] giving it to those people and then all
[1:17:32] of a sudden they decide they don't like
[1:17:34] you no more
[1:17:36] so they take to a post hole diggers and
[1:17:38] they dig up their posts and then they
[1:17:39] set it down to another post to duty and
[1:17:44] then they're gonna running you down I'm
[1:17:47] talking about you you saying my goodness
[1:17:50] all the years all the meals I missed all
[1:17:52] the night sleep I lost for them people
[1:17:54] and what happened all that if you don't
[1:17:56] keep abreast of it and if you don't keep
[1:17:58] above it all
[1:17:59] it goes to building and building and
[1:18:01] building on a picture and you lose a
[1:18:04] little more feeling and a little more
[1:18:05] and a little more and he'll start taking
[1:18:07] his harshness and his bitterness and
[1:18:09] finding scriptures to justify it
[1:18:13] God hates bitterness whether it's in a
[1:18:15] preacher or a singer you know men are
[1:18:18] different - it is and bitterness will
[1:18:19] grieve the spirit of God away from any
[1:18:21] man I don't care how good he can preach
[1:18:23] how good it can sing don't get quiet on
[1:18:24] my church I don't want that myself I
[1:18:28] want to be sweet full of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:30] don't you I think with that then a
[1:18:33] person can have this bitterness in them
[1:18:35] I we've got we've got so many
[1:18:37] opportunity to become bitter why would I
[1:18:39] want to remain bitter when there's so
[1:18:41] much of the love of God I've never even
[1:18:43] tasted of yet why would I want to become
[1:18:46] better now ability why would I want to
[1:18:48] become so complex and full of so many
[1:18:50] hurts have you been hurt brother don't
[1:18:52] you oh yes I've been hurt by them you
[1:18:53] know thousands and thousands of time but
[1:18:55] so of you let's go we can spend all of
[1:18:58] our time wallowing in our hurting our
[1:19:00] disappointment or we can say praise God
[1:19:02] there's a higher calling
[1:19:03] there's the City of God there's the
[1:19:05] kingdom of God let's move on that's not
[1:19:07] Waddell in our Hertz notices brother
[1:19:17] brems said to know that I had India in
[1:19:18] my heart again senior brother no matter
[1:19:19] who he is he's trying to preach the
[1:19:21] gospel or Jesus Christ or live a
[1:19:23] Christian life if we disagree on million
[1:19:27] mouths upon theology if he loves the
[1:19:30] Lord Jesus he's my brother
[1:19:34] and it's my sister and we've drawled
[1:19:37] those lines and if you can't love your
[1:19:39] brother who you have seen how can you
[1:19:41] love God who you can't or have never
[1:19:43] seen and brother when love goes out God
[1:19:46] goes with it
[1:19:47] [Applause]
[1:19:51] if we run the love of God out of this
[1:19:54] place all we'll have is a building with
[1:19:56] carpet and nice songs and nice musicians
[1:19:59] and nice singers but if God leaves I'm
[1:20:02] leaving with him
[1:20:05] I don't just want science I don't just
[1:20:07] want wonders and miracles I love divine
[1:20:12] love y'all want to stay with me notice
[1:20:25] this we must love one another keep the
[1:20:27] roots of bitterness out of us then God
[1:20:29] can go to working through us but till we
[1:20:32] get that we're just fighting the wind
[1:20:36] and of course this is another one of
[1:20:39] Satan's entertainments at his picnic he
[1:20:42] loves to watch us fight the wind now the
[1:20:47] wind is something which is very real
[1:20:48] it's something that we've all felt on
[1:20:51] our face on our back all around us all
[1:20:53] of our lives it's invisible comes when
[1:20:56] it wants ghosts when it once we don't
[1:20:57] know where it lists to 3-mile where it
[1:20:58] come from where it goes to so can you
[1:21:00] imagine I'm picking a fight with the
[1:21:03] wind come on come on face me like a man
[1:21:08] you're really bored aren't you
[1:21:13] can you imagine picking a fight whistle
[1:21:16] and and Satan just holes inside that
[1:21:23] mustard I had so much fun since Peter
[1:21:33] cast this is great in town message
[1:21:40] Malakoff for deepest people on the earth
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:52] but I come loaded tonight for the picnic
[1:21:55] brigade anybody wants to help me go
[1:22:03] through this picnic and turn there hey
[1:22:09] man I wouldn't come to your picnic and
[1:22:11] turn there cuz it wouldn't be nice I
[1:22:12] wouldn't go to a park Rotary Park or
[1:22:14] evermore and tear up a picnic but I
[1:22:16] think I'm perfectly justified in turning
[1:22:19] up the devil's picnic in my life or in
[1:22:21] my family or in a challenge so our God
[1:22:25] can so fill us with love that Satan said
[1:22:28] all Lord get out of here they broke into
[1:22:30] the realm of perfect love I never
[1:22:32] thought they'd do it I never thought
[1:22:34] they'd ever found the way all the devil
[1:22:36] let me tell you God's got a people on
[1:22:38] the earth around the world that will be
[1:22:41] filled with God's divine love they will
[1:22:43] preach deep things they will heal the
[1:22:45] sick but they will be so much like God
[1:22:48] that the world will know there is still
[1:22:50] a Living God
[1:22:52] praise the Lord Lord Jesus notice his
[1:23:06] mother man said we must love one another
[1:23:08] and keep the roots of bitterness out of
[1:23:09] us then God can work through us until we
[1:23:12] get that we're just fighting the wind
[1:23:14] true we got a love one another jesus
[1:23:16] said by all this will men know you're my
[1:23:19] disciples right or wrong how much of
[1:23:31] your short life do you think God would
[1:23:33] love you if he left you on the basis of
[1:23:36] when you were right there's probably
[1:23:42] things tonight that we believe that's
[1:23:43] wrong we just don't know it yet we'll
[1:23:47] find it out tomorrow Wednesday or
[1:23:48] something like that you mean God loves
[1:23:51] you when you're wrong believing this or
[1:23:52] that or the other but he's God but
[1:23:59] you're supposed to be born of God I know
[1:24:02] I know I know I'm a simple simple simple
[1:24:04] person but dogs beget dogs get to get
[1:24:07] cats horse beget horse so what does God
[1:24:09] to get praise the Lord

[1:24:30] this is when all men will know that
[1:24:32] you're my disciples you got love one
[1:24:34] another that's the greatest evidence of
[1:24:37] the Holy Ghost that I know of when you
[1:24:40] can love one another yes sir that's the
[1:24:44] great commandment great thing though you
[1:24:46] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[1:24:48] have not love it profits you nothing
[1:24:53] anybody here ever spoken tongues of
[1:24:55] angels angelic tons a French for German
[1:24:59] or Spanish or something that was
[1:25:01] interpreted anybody here if it could
[1:25:06] speak of tongues of men and of angels
[1:25:08] give our bodies to be burned all these
[1:25:11] great things and we don't have this
[1:25:13] we're still missed into our mark
[1:25:20] though we were so deep then when people
[1:25:23] got up and left our preaching they said
[1:25:24] man that's a deepest a fiber now life
[1:25:27] but if you're better paid fall contrary
[1:25:31] well kiss it on you look you've just
[1:25:34] held a seminar of some sort listen to
[1:25:39] this in Christ's mystery I love you
[1:25:42] don't forget the commandments of God to
[1:25:45] your little children love one another
[1:25:47] love everybody right or wrong
[1:25:51] sinner or Saint love them anyhow
[1:25:58] if you don't then pray God to help you
[1:26:03] praise the Lord because God loved the
[1:26:07] sinner and the nature of God
[1:26:09] you see you if the man is wrong love him
[1:26:14] anyhow don't protective his sin
[1:26:17] don't protective his sins but in
[1:26:19] sweetness not in sourness and rebuke in
[1:26:23] sweetness telling of the hope of life
[1:26:25] that rests within you so Jesus Christ
[1:26:27] being revealed to you by the Holy Ghost
[1:26:29] if you can't talk to a sinner if you
[1:26:31] can't talk to a woman that's dressed
[1:26:32] wrong if you cannot do it in sweetness
[1:26:34] then don't do it you'll bring a reproach
[1:26:37] if you're approaching and bitterness or
[1:26:39] anger or smart-aleck attitude leave it
[1:26:41] alone you'll only produce a stumbling
[1:26:46] block notice this as we love one another
[1:26:51] we love God so pick that person that you
[1:26:57] struggle with and think as I love
[1:27:01] brother so-and-so or sister so itself
[1:27:03] that's the way I love God and I love
[1:27:07] them with restraints I love them very
[1:27:10] little I don't care for them that well
[1:27:12] that's the way you love God cuz when
[1:27:16] you've done this to the least of these
[1:27:17] my brothers you've done it to me
[1:27:23] uh-oh some y'all just spread this the
[1:27:26] red and white checkered table cover back
[1:27:28] out get that salt out of your hand get
[1:27:32] that salt out of your hand pick up a
[1:27:33] sword
[1:27:34] we'll break it up this picnic around
[1:27:36] don't you reset that table on me you get
[1:27:40] your hand out that refrigerator oh
[1:27:46] listen to this watch him as he just
[1:27:49] keeps going keeps going on up to the end
[1:27:51] of his ministry same thoughts same
[1:27:53] thought this says we love one another
[1:27:57] now I cannot love him without loving you
[1:28:05] and if I say I love him and don't love
[1:28:08] you the Bible said I'm a liar notice
[1:28:16] again how do you know how will the world
[1:28:17] know that you love Jesus when we love
[1:28:19] one another that's how the world see God
[1:28:22] sees your face the world sees your
[1:28:24] action love one another now be kind to
[1:28:28] one another talk with one another be
[1:28:30] patient was one another well that's hard
[1:28:33] to be sometimes any man sometimes some
[1:28:36] of the people you go to church with are
[1:28:38] the sorriest bunch of mud I'm telling
[1:28:40] you what I don't know working anybody
[1:28:42] love them well God does so I guess if
[1:28:44] you're a part of him you got to love
[1:28:45] them do you put up as their shortcomings
[1:28:48] say for that but yours y'all put up a
[1:28:49] mine I put up in yours God puts up with
[1:28:51] us all
[1:28:53] and the love of God in our hearts will
[1:28:56] make us like him to put over you realize
[1:28:58] that's not the image of God this that's
[1:29:00] human part that we clash on that's not
[1:29:02] the image of God but the image of God
[1:29:04] has set something down on the inside but
[1:29:06] if we're not careful we so look at that
[1:29:08] outside we can't even love the inside
[1:29:10] because the outside stumbles us we love
[1:29:18] one another if we don't love one another
[1:29:21] we can't French so you see how serious
[1:29:27] this is if there is one person in this
[1:29:29] world that you hate there's something
[1:29:33] wrong with your walk was God not only
[1:29:36] you don't know what I've done I don't
[1:29:38] need to have you ever been treated to
[1:29:42] one percentile of the way my Lord Jesus
[1:29:45] frustrated northa let me go a bit
[1:29:58] farther most on my own aha love you with
[1:30:02] undying love listen level another you
[1:30:05] cannot dislike your brother who you see
[1:30:11] and say you love God
[1:30:14] now listen friends he brings it on down
[1:30:18] on Arts in our thinking
[1:30:23] he doesn't say hate that you hate your
[1:30:27] brother but you just dislike him he's
[1:30:33] still working on me
[1:30:38] did y'all see my sign under
[1:30:41] constructions
[1:30:43] y'all got yours out hold out your sign
[1:30:45] under construction Lord Jesus you cannot
[1:30:52] dislike your brother who you see and say
[1:30:54] you love God you haven't seen see so
[1:30:56] just love one another then you serve one
[1:30:58] another you serve God is that right as
[1:31:00] you've done to the least of these that
[1:31:02] Scott quickening power in them you've
[1:31:05] done it unto me what's the image of God
[1:31:07] the quickening power is the image of God
[1:31:10] or what would make us want to dislike I
[1:31:12] want to say something the crashing of
[1:31:14] this you've got one culture I got
[1:31:17] another use race and a certain protocol
[1:31:18] I was raised in another you've got a
[1:31:20] certain makeup I've got another little
[1:31:22] price and it'll rub wrong you remember
[1:31:26] what they cover the outside the
[1:31:27] tabernacle is badger skins matches a
[1:31:32] mean little feller but there's one thing
[1:31:35] about it before they ever put them
[1:31:36] badgers together they had to be dead
[1:31:38] when the old animal nature had to be
[1:31:40] dead and gone you imagine taking two
[1:31:42] badgers and sewing them together with
[1:31:44] their lives
[1:31:44] I can imagine you won't have no fingers
[1:31:47] left is what I can imagine cuz they're
[1:31:49] gonna tear your fingers off but if you
[1:31:51] kill that animal nature and let the
[1:31:54] animal nature leave then what is left
[1:31:56] the skin of the badger then you can sow
[1:31:59] a black one - a white one and they
[1:32:01] neither one got racial profiling
[1:32:04] hey man you can show European to an
[1:32:07] Asian or whatever more and they hug one
[1:32:09] another and call one another brother wah
[1:32:12] that'll racial thing install that Oh
[1:32:14] animal thing is dog and they can be
[1:32:17] showed together to make her a shelter of
[1:32:19] the holy presence of God may God help us
[1:32:23] that he can take our old badger skin and
[1:32:25] show it to that brother and that brother
[1:32:28] and that brother in that brother that we
[1:32:30] collectively can be the house of God
[1:32:38] you know what they dumber than batches
[1:32:41] they dip them all and crimson red you
[1:32:52] know who that red dye come from a female
[1:32:57] insect that had a little bitty drop or
[1:33:02] two drops in her body and they took that
[1:33:06] out of this female insect to make a
[1:33:12] certain color of red or crimson in the
[1:33:15] tabernacle and they would take that dye
[1:33:19] can you imagine how many insects it
[1:33:22] would take to pour that full of this dye
[1:33:28] glory to God when they put them in one
[1:33:32] might have been white the other might
[1:33:34] have been brown now they might have been
[1:33:35] black but when they pulled them all out
[1:33:37] there's all the same color that God
[1:33:43] hallelujah I'll tell your friends folks
[1:33:46] around this message that got race
[1:33:47] problems think outrace bombs I got soul
[1:33:49] problems they got soul problems they
[1:33:52] need to be took to the VAT of the blood
[1:33:54] of the Lord Jesus and died and they can
[1:33:56] buy they can grab a black man from
[1:33:57] Africa or a brother from Philippines or
[1:34:00] Asia or wherever they are and hug them
[1:34:02] ransom my brother I love you we are a
[1:34:05] one soul one move one body of all church
[1:34:08] it makes no difference whether you're
[1:34:10] black white red or yellow want some
[1:34:11] badges was God in that fact they come
[1:34:14] out of the lawn they come out of there
[1:34:16] so and dude with something that'd change
[1:34:18] them and transform him that they could
[1:34:21] be the hiding place of Jehovah what an
[1:34:24] opportunity God's given us that we in
[1:34:26] our bodies and in our church can be the
[1:34:29] tabernacle of the Most High
[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:42] mother bream said when the enemy comes
[1:34:44] in like a flood the Spirit of God raises
[1:34:47] a standard against it just keep lifting
[1:34:51] yourself up in prayer before God cling
[1:34:56] to one another hold to God for if you
[1:35:00] love one another it shows you love God
[1:35:04] and this one all men know that you're my
[1:35:07] disciples when you have loved one for
[1:35:11] the other things that are to be in the
[1:35:13] last sermon that actually preached
[1:35:15] before communion and then this will all
[1:35:17] men know that you're my disciples when
[1:35:19] you have love one for another that's
[1:35:20] right if we can't love one another who
[1:35:23] we do see how are we gonna love God
[1:35:32] brother been said years ago at the
[1:35:34] Tabernacle no clothes that the people
[1:35:37] there at that church was so in love with
[1:35:38] one another they would cry to see one
[1:35:43] another again they would cry because
[1:35:49] they got so homesick for one another and
[1:35:52] perjures had come to him and said how do
[1:35:55] you do that how do you do that in that
[1:35:58] church to make them people so loved so
[1:36:03] this was the foundation of brother brems
[1:36:06] ministry the man that we say we believe
[1:36:11] what a far cry we are from the spirit
[1:36:14] this message was introduced
[1:36:20] but instead our churches have become
[1:36:22] picnic grounds our homes our lives
[1:36:26] people go to church they don't like it
[1:36:29] it's too hot it's too cold I don't like
[1:36:31] this how about that in case you hadn't
[1:36:33] noticed we don't have a suggestion box
[1:36:36] in the back of the church this is not
[1:36:39] McDonald's we're not here to please each
[1:36:43] one of you that's totally impossible
[1:36:45] anyway we are here to lay aside our
[1:36:48] differences but brother Donnie I'm
[1:36:50] looking for churches perfect perfect

[1:36:56] an ER it's a psychiatric ward don't tell
[1:37:02] me it ain't I know it is I'm looking for
[1:37:07] the perfect church sign no such a thing
[1:37:09] this is horseshit folks are helped this
[1:37:12] is what drug addicts can be set free
[1:37:14] this is what drugs can be set free this
[1:37:16] is not a perfect place people's got all
[1:37:19] kinds of soul problems and spiritual
[1:37:21] problems and physical problems but
[1:37:23] they're coming to the right place and
[1:37:25] they're waiting in line to see doctor

[1:44:03] Lord Jesus there's so many wonderful
[1:44:06] things that I so appreciate in love
[1:44:10] about brother Branham but one of the
[1:44:13] things is that he was so simple that he
[1:44:17] would take simple statements like this
[1:44:19] the devil's picnic the devil just has a
[1:44:22] picnic laughs at us and in it can be
[1:44:26] volumes and volumes of things this
[1:44:29] speaks to our hearts I pray to not Lord
[1:44:33] Jesus that those presidents and those
[1:44:35] listening we can look at each of our
[1:44:38] lives and realize how many times we have
[1:44:41] been Satan's entertainment when we were
[1:44:44] fussing and fighting and arguing and
[1:44:46] debating Lord the futures meetings and
[1:44:50] I've been to I felt like it was awful

[1:44:57] and forth and losing their temper and
[1:44:59] face turning red and awful awful
[1:45:04] preachers Lord of bedding ground or a

[1:45:20] to their wives and their children to
[1:45:22] accept the responsibility of being a man
[1:45:26] Lord to look at their lives check their
[1:45:29] homes and see is everything in order is
[1:45:33] everything in line to place you or is it
[1:45:37] a constant place for Satan and his

[1:45:44] cannot change the world we cannot even

[1:46:20] the shelf and the love divine love would
[1:46:24] so move in the church that the Lord
