the way the way found us to be able to get back home oh yeah praise the Lord thank you Lord let's turn to the Book of Numbers tonight if you would chapter 1 verse 52 greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus and did a wonderful privilege for us to be guest gathered together in his house once again and on Wednesday night yes numbers 1:52 and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard throughout their host numbers chap 2 verse 2 every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard with the ins sign of their father's house far off about the Tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch so we know that there's a difference between order and organization God is against man-made organization but God is not against divine order Isaiah 5919 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the RIS ring of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard or an ins sign or a banner or a standard same thing the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him which of course is against the enemy Joel 2 verse 7 a prophecy of the last days now remember scripture can have compound meanings um this is one of them but a prophecy of the last days of the army of God now listen what the army of God will be they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War and they shall March everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks now this is the army of God they shall not break their ranks so they're assigned a certain rank a certain position the church ages have been designated to live under a certain anointing a certain message a certain move of God for that time the elect of God find that Rank and there they stay Satan's way is divide and conquer so if he can divide us from the anointing of the day divide us from what we're supposed to be then we're weaker all of us are and he's able to conquer us but we want to be like this Mighty Army that will run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War and they shall March everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray Lord Jesus we love you so much we're so happy just so happy to be your people we're so grateful Heavenly Father for the evening life that has got a hold of our hearts and helped us dear Jesus Lord we know the message of the last day did not come to replace the Bible it did not come to bring us a new version of the Bible but it come to shine light on the Bible that we already had so when I come from p cost I did not need a new version I did not need a new translation I just needed new inspiration and from that same Bible that I wrote and preached from I've still got the one my grandmother gave me when I got saved at 12 years old and I've still got the one that I preached from in Pentecost very same version King James but now I'm preaching things so different what is it wasn't the Bible that changed it was the light on the Bible so father we're so grateful to be living under the influence of the evening light we believe we are an army of God we believe that we've been assigned a rank a position where we're supposed to stand we desire to be faithful father help us as we look into your word tonight we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints you may be seated what a great thing it is to be able to find our position by the presence of God and we know that you know they asked brother random the question and question answers about how does one find their place in Christ Jesus and he said well generally your position is made known by whether you can do it or not whether you can do it or not so he said if a man claims that he's called to be a preacher watch how he interprets the word if a man claims he's called to be this or that then you watch and see if God has gifted him to be able to do it and it goes that way pretty much with anything that God enables his people to be able to do certain things now let us turn if you would to Revelation 4:5 we've been looking at that God has raised up a standard in every age and we can we can see by history that God did it down through the church ages also through the times of the Old Testament and we know that God has done it for us in this day and God we know goes by numerics threes fives sevens but one of the numbers that that's not very use that much actually Among Us is the number four four of course is a number of Earthly deliverance we don't care for four as much as we do for seven but yet four is very useful in the right place and we know that it was the fourth man in the furnace of fire of course that delivered the Hebrew children and four God uses four and we know that Ezekiel Saw four in his book and we know that Daniel also there was fours Book of Revelation there was fours so God chooses to reveal him himself under certain anointings and God will let the anointing be released and that anointing will anoint the people of that day that we receive it to come to the full accomplishment of what God wants them to be that's the only way they'll ever do it when never read oursel into it we'll never be able to get self self-help books and say well I want to be a better Christian so I'm going to get a self-help book and it's going to teach me how to be able to bring my flesh under control and I'm going to learn how to do that and learn how to do that we'll find out in a little bit where that where that stuff comes from but what we actually need is the anointing release to us from the presence of God for the day that we live in to help us accomplish the word that's been designated for that day you believe that with all your heart now watch Revelation 4:5 and out of the throne preceded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God now remember God is now revealed in in the seven so it's not that God has one Spirit then God has another Spirit but it's a manifestation of the same spirit of God now watch verse six and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind now watch so here we have four which is not just a number of Earthly Deliverance but there's also an answer to the four on the earth and we can see it reflected in heaven now I'm not trying to get deep tonight I'm not trying to go the top of your head but just to be able to help you to understand why we must stand under the banner that God has given for us in the end time if we want to be raptured how many it does we want to have our body changed how many does then we've got to be under the display of the standard of the Lord for the day that we live in and we also must be aware that Satan will try his best to influence us with a false standard or a previous standard which has lived out its time now part of the danger that will be is that Satan is always trying to point people backwards to something that God used for another day and it is lived out its time it's completed it's fulfilled and inevitably it's lost the fullness of its power because God has turned a new page the light is shining on something else so if Satan cannot blind us from what God is presently doing by helping us to you know see the scarecrows in front of us he will try to point us backward to what has been and then we go in reverse remember God never gives us reversed as the children of God it's always moved forward amen Now watch how that John sees this and it must have been so peculiar remember that the prophets in the fourth dimension is where they would see their Visions but John has actually moved up into another dimension so this is more like a dimensional Vision instead of John just being here in time and looking out before his eyes but John was transmitted there to watch his happened so he sees four beasts and they are full of eyes before and behind so the eyes of course are a symbol of the ability of a spiritual Insight so they must have looked very strange so John looks and he sees four beasts and they've got eyes everywhere well it wasn't that it was some type of weird creature but it was God symbolizing that the anointing in every age that's going to be released will have the eye of Deliverance the eye of power the eye of abundance of Revelation every one of them is going to be an Insight by which will empower the saints of God to live and overcome in the day they live in now watch he said the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast was like a calf and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle now here there's four different beasts which are powers and they're going to be reflected on the Earth by human voice now notice how strange this would seem I realize the majority of Christians in the age we live in they don't even read the book of Revelation they have no desire to because they read it they don't understand it it's symbols you know it's got all types of figures and numerologies and all that in they they just see no need whatsoever and even reading it but why would God give us the Book of Revelation if it's not going to be given for somebody to be able to understand it and what's really pitiful to me is that there are message people that feel the exact same way about the Book of Revelation all all they want to hear preach is the cross and the blood and mercy and forgiveness let me tell you something a preacher that that's all he preaches more than likely that's all he needs himself apparently he's got a lot of sin going on in his life and that's the only thing he knows how to preach well come on somebody and if all the people sting there they never want to hear about these things if you never want to hear about this you need to check your Holy Ghost cuz it was the Holy Ghost that anointed John to ride about this and everybody said now watch so they have identifications now watch what there are it's a beast which is representation of an animal so John sees it and one of them was like a lion it was not a lion but it was like a lion and the second was like it was not a calf but like a calf and the third had the face of a man and then the fourth was a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come now want you to notice how they worship they do not worship A God Called father and A God Called son and A God Called Holy Ghost they are Oneness beast and they worship in the Oneness Avenue Lord God Almighty amen and they know how to worship and they worship in the realm of Holiness holy holy holy now notice what they do holy holy holy Lord God Almighty father son holy ghost in One throne in one display of his great power now notice and they say which was which is and which is to come notice the attributes Lord God God Almighty which was which is which is to come the threes made perfect in one being now notice then when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him not to them but to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever so John now sees these four beast and he must have been just in in a state of bewilderment trying to understand what in the world would that means so prophets we know unless God would give them the interpretation of a vision they wouldn't know what to make of it brother R told us at himself about seeing visions he said sometimes you might see a lamb and it might mean a sheep or it might mean wool so it can mean two or three different things you remember there was a discernment in 1964 and brother random calls a woman out and he tells her that her name was strong or Stout whichever one that it was and you know it was it was symbolic in the vision and she says the opposite of what he said yeah I said it was it was that so whatever it was that he saw in the vision I'm from Kentucky like he was so a strong or Stout to a Kentucky boy means the same thing so whatever he saw in the vision he didn't Mis misread the pronunciation but it was a symbolic representation of strength and with a Kentucky demeanor you would look at and say boy he's as Stout as a mu somebody else say well he's as strong as a mule well to me you said the exact same thing so a prophet then whenever he would see this he would not know exactly what it meant all he can say is well I I saw these four creatures and they all had eyes all over them and one looked sort of like a lion and the other one looked sort of like a calf and the other one had a face of a man you notice he didn't say what it actually looked like but he said it had a face of a man and then the other one was a flying eagle and then then he says he noticed about these beasts that they all got to worshiping the Lord God and they begin to praise him now Journey with me if you would into the fourth seal and the prophet said now we find out this lamb open the seal and this first Beast if you notice the first Beast was a lion the living creature found notice now in the book of the church ages then the second beast I believe he said it was like the face of an ox or a cat and the third Beast was the face of a man and the first Beast was a face of anle now the face of a man what's that going to symbolize well it's going to symbolize a man's head if you notice it was not the arms of a man which be his strength or it was not the shoulders of a man which also would signify strength but it was the face of a man what's in the face the brain the intelligence we are recognized most of us you would never know me most of you would would never even know me if you only had my hand to go by my wife would my children would my grandkids would because they always want to see that that scar a man while I was bitten by a Rabbid Fox but most of you would not know my hand if aund hands was put up before you tonight on this screen most of you would not pick mine out but if my face was put up there you'd know me so there's something about the face of a man or a woman and that is what we identify with almost immediately is that right so then when John saw this Beast it was the identification of a man we don't know exactly what the man looked like and that was not the value but what the value was that it was a representation of a man so the man anointing was going to go for quite a lapse of time down in the church ages now remember this is the last one next to ours and I hope hope you understand what I'm fixing to say I'm afraid a lot of people I know in the Le ofan age but the sad part about it is I'm afraid there's some even around the ranks of our message that are still operating under the anointing of the man instead of the Flying Eagle now I want you to notice what the man's symbol was it was a symbol of the time or the age of Reformation now I want you to see that Reformation then comes from the man so the man symbolizes wisdom his ability to process but also remember that the prophet told us in the Garden of Eden that Satan chose man's head but God chose man's heart Malachi 4 was not sent to turn our heads to God but sent to turn our hearts to God but now watch what a lot of the men in the last days do so it's all about the head the mind trying to get them psychologically able to overcome so this guy will write a book and this guy will write another book and this woman will write another book on how to overcome and how to do this and how don't you understand why they're doing that because they've not moved under the eagle anointing which will Empower them to produce a word burst from the soul so what do they have to do then many of these preachers that are preaching the the majority of the denominational preachers don't even have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Soul themselves if they do they'll go on the Rapture if they do how could they ever lead their churches into a denominational trap and be barked with the bark of the Beast come on now and then you look at some of the ones around the message and see what they have done down through the years and it's easy to see that some of the the group leaders and those that have built little kingdoms a kingdom here and a kingdom there what have most of them been brother Daryl they've not been under the eagle anointing the eagle anointing is to point worship back to the Lord God Almighty the eagle anointing is not to establish the kingdom of any man I don't care who he is or what his last name is we are not interested in building a brandom kingdom or a Reagan Kingdom or a pu Kingdom or a Spencer or Ward or any other man we are interested in worshiping the Lord God Almighty but you see people that get under the man anointing then what do they do they take their head to try to figure out a lot of things and they cannot really produce the power the dunamus from God to be able to give their people the ability to overcome so they have to keep doing it by the mind so they got to work on the Mind well they've got to have special classes on lust and you got to have a special class on life and you got to have another class on this and another class on that and another class on that why I'm not against that now but if we're simply trying to approach it on the basis of the mind it shows we're missing something from the soul we will never overcome the devil just by our ability to quote the scripture because the devil can out quote every one of us right here [Applause] tonight so I want you to notice in the man anointing it was the closest one to the Eagle in the lap over watch this in the Sixth Seal the prophet said then here come the reformers the head of a man shrewd wise Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth Calvin finny Knox the rest of them here come forth and when they did they were reformers but now remember Pentecost 1906 Pentecost fit under the same thing of the man anointed so the man anointing did not stop with KNX it did not stop with finny it did not stop with Calvin it run right up to where the birth of Revelation 10 is going to usher in the anointing of Luke 17:30 Malachi 456 to where it will be a transition it's not just to change in Doctrine don't you understand what we've done many of us we've LED people to the message and we simply traded them from Baptist Doctrine to message Doctrine and they never really got the token in their lives and then they go on and they find out that their their lives is wrapped right back up in some of the same sins that they had before and they don't have power to overcome come on somebody preach with me tonight but we don't want to just have the doctrine of the message we want to have the power that it produces to be able to overcome and live a Victorious Life Now you see God realized how that man would be he could have released Eagle anointing of course if he wanted to in the beginning but God has an order of sequence and divine protocol by which he releases it so he chose the first anointing was what that of the Lion now the lion was the influence of the personal life of Christ himself so it was the alpha age the alpha Church which is what the vision that the prophet saw when he saw the bride standing there and she come through this beautiful music and she was all dressed you know and in her long garments and her long hair and he said the same bride's going to come back again of course in between those intervals he saw the church come through and the church was naked and wretched and blind and all of that then he said but wait a minute the bride will come back again and then whenever he didn't even have the interpretation of the vision and he tells the vision but then as he's preaching the message in the Masterpiece then God gives him the Divine interpretation and he said I just now got the interpretation of what that was and he said she was Alpha and Omega so now I thought Jesus was that well it's him and feminist form you see it was him in that original bride it was the alpha bride then in between that was what these other Church ages under the anointing of the man they were neither alpha or Omega but they were under the man anointed now remember that's all they could work under we cannot blame them for that because that's all they had that's all was given from the time that the reflection of the man be to shine on the church ages until the birst of the eagle anointing in the last day but now people choose people choose to stay under the man anointing or they will temporarily come out from under the man anointing and they will live under the eagle anointing for a bit and then they say no no no no no I can't handle that no sir no no this message s Malachi 4:7 you know they get it quote the prophet I can't handle that so they take what they want you know get this get that the other and then start slipping back under the anointing of the man again why because it's still here it's still here how do you think the majority of the churches are operating don't you think they have the spirit of God yes many of them do have a portion of the spirit of God what if it's the eagle anointing that fly out of them a denominational pins and become born of the word of the Hour come on now but they're not they can live the right they want to live so we have Christian drug addicts we have Christians that are hung up on on all kinds of Filth and sin we have Christians that's doing the same stuff that Sinners are doing except they just call them themselves a Christian come on search well why can't they do it they know it ain't right don't you think people don't know it's not right for them to live the way they live many of them do but they don't have the power to help them overcome and many the preachers standing in the pulit don't have the power either so they've got to figure out how they can water it down so the songwriters write songs about it well that's what the blood is for cuz God knows you can't live right God knows you can't do it so God gives you the blood so basically you sin every day and you ask God to forgive you and then the next day you do the same thing or worse and it's the same repetitive stuff over and over again oh but if you're really born of the spirit of God there is no desire of sin left in you anywhere the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin am amen but you see those who are still C under the Trap of the man anointing and that's where of course where would it lead them to it cannot lead them to a Rapture because it processes the gospel through the mind it processes the word to the mind so you know prophet and all that oh my goodness no no no we we can't accept none of that stuff well the law and the prophets want under John and you're kind trying to quote that and use that for a scripture that there is no New Testament prophets when Paul himself wrote about prophets after that one was written you don't even know what you're even quoting the law and the prophets was a Hebrew idiom it was a saying that was used among the Hebrews which meant the law the first five books of Moses and the prophets which was Isaiah Jeremiah Malachi Zachariah the law and the prophets was what the Old Testament so the law and the prophets the Old Testament was unto John and then the king of Heaven is preached and every man presseth his way into it how would a man ever come out with such a thing because he's under the anointing of a man so it's a man's mind well I can't understand that I I can't process all that stuff about visions and bride and church and election and all that well come up here where the Eagles are and be able to fly around up here where we are and you'll be able to see it's all through the Bible praise the Lord It's All Through the Bible it's not manmade I want you to notice then the reformers the prophet identifies this that they were reformers they come forth reforming don't you understand friend that that's what a lot of the message folks are doing that's what they've done for years and years we've got message reformers brother darl that's why they don't have the power to overcome and the same people that brother darl goes and preaches in a place and young people old people whatever come up in a par line another preacher come through another three or four weeks some of the same ones and the prayer line again another preacher come through come to the same prayer line again what for for some of the same stuff sure if you've got a different need come back but why can't we overcome God wants us to be prayed for God wants us to have prayer lines and we're going to continue to have them until we leave this world but I'll tell you one thing I cannot pray you through the victory brother Daryl cannot pray you through the victory the rest of these pre creachers cannot pray you through you've got to live you've got to walk in Victory you've got to have victory in your life or you'll never be able to obtain Victory up whenever we're having church and shout and jump and run around and ain't even got enough Victory tomorrow to overcome the devil you need to say God I'm sick of this I'm sick and tired of living like a yoyo I'm up and down and up and down God I want Power I want dunamus I want the anointing of the evil that I Can Fly Above pornography that I Can Fly Above temper I Can Fly Above [Applause] anger is Reformation good yep but it just don't take you far enough notice what it does they were reformers they come forth reforming bringing the people out yes but Redemption has two parts bringing them out and taking them in so people come to give their heart to the Lord no doubt every every weekend around the Tri Cities areas all the churches here there's all kinds of people that give their heart to Christ yeah wonder why it goes with that move to say Christ more than the Lord Jesus wonder why they'd rather say Christos which is the Greek for the anointed one instead of calling the name that the angel gave him now you watch them you watch a lot of these teachers and it's Christ this Christ that Christ this Christ that that's true well come on don't get quiet me you know what what really bothers me is when you go to see M's preacher going the same way uhhuh why not call him his name I mean you can call me preacher if you want to people do how you doing preacher how are you preacher how you doing preacher well that's who I am as far as my position but I do have a name my mom and daddy gave it to me I've got a name so preacher you know I me that's that's an identification but I do have a name and the Lord Jesus has a name well come on now oh the anointed one this the anointed one that I I tell you one thing whenever I'm in trouble I like to call on that blessed name and when that Devil's around me I like to say that name oh yes I have no problem in saying Christ it's in the Bible yes sir but you watch that identification generally the language of reformers Christ this Christ that Christ this well God understands God understands this age is so evil and there's so much Darkness God understands why we can't live right he sure does he understands you're not born again praise the Lord now watch this he said they come forth reforming bringing the people out and turn right back around exactly they did back back there and marriage straight back into the denominational system again the foreal now remember now in this first age was a lion Age The Lion of the tribe of Judah Christ on influence of life now watch Christ anointed one now we're talking about office Christ own influence anointed one anointing his sons and daughters Christ own influence of Life taken that age that's the first Beast so a beast was a power so the Lord Jesus allowed his own personal influence of his lion anointing to get on that first age that's what they needed they needed a lot of boldness did they now the line of the tribe of Judah of course is what he represented now he said that's the first Beast which means power that answered by human voice power that answered by human voice so if God would have come down and showed a line in every church service and a great supernal something would have been displayed oh my no doubt people would have come to the Altar and they'll run and scream for Mercy but God didn't do it that way what God did was took his own personal life and answered back out through human voice and then delect heard it and the others are blinded by the veil of the flesh so God anointed human beings with his anointing but it wasn't his voice that thundered from Heaven as it was on siia or Mount Transfiguration it was God anointing their human voice and some saw men others saw God hallelujah praise God that first be which means power that answered by human voice Lord Jesus Keep Us right there that next age was the ox age or the dark horse rider age the second age was a red horse rider and which was a dark age and the next age he said was the age that was the black horse rider he was the age of the reformers the Voice who spoke now if you've studied any and read much after Calvin KNX Finny they were men that were great men and they did have some truths yes they did they had some great truths but hardly any of them understood the true revelation of the godhead every one of them lucer Knox Calvin finny many of those great preachers every one of them nearly baptized en titles why because the man anointing would not anoint them Beyond looking at the scriptures and seeing and they looked right at and said there's got to be more than one who would Jesus pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane well who do you pray to when you're in trouble you pray to the god that lives inside you don't you well that's exactly what he was doing but the man anointing would try to figure it out in one plus one I mean how how could that be one it can't be it's got to be what is that the man the reformer well there's got to be well there's got to at least be two yeah you can see where that tun this thing come into the message can you some of the theologians in the message that weren't really under the eagle anointing what did they become brother Daryl reformers under the man AG so where did all these camps come from in the message reformers in the message come on now bring her around down brother Donnie where did all these things come through down Through the Ages all these denominational things as much as we hate them and yet they're right Among Us just as bad as they are here in the world and where did they come from Men that are working under the man anointing I'll tell you children it's going to take more than the man anointing to get us out of here we better be living walking talking praying revelated under the eagle anointing of this end time of Malachi 4 it's going to take more than Luther's understanding and Wesley's understanding we've got to have the influence of that flying eagle I want you to notice the posture of that Eagle it was not setting come on it was a flying eagle in action hey you don't you don't need Wings if you're going to set you don't need no movement you going but if you got Wings put them to use brother sister now notice this again in the fore but now when it comes forth the eagle age that's the one that God always Likens His prophets to Eagles he calls himself an eagle now could they do this of course in the days of Paul they couldn't could Peter have operated under that no he had to operate under the anointing of the Lion of the tribe of Judah so they would stand with great boness they would stand right in the face of dictators they would stand right in the face of neero and everybody else because the anointing on them they would look right at him in the face and tell you oh I would that you was just like me except for these chains they would say have you've been convicted also to be a Christian you're talking about men that could have them killed or men that could turn them loose but that anointing of that line it would move on them that'd preach the gospel that'd beat them they'd whip them that' threaten them and say Don't You Preach no more in the name of the Lord Jesus and the next day they found him right out on the corner of the street preaching the same gospel that they preached the day before now if You' have put the man anointing on them they thought now now Brethren now Brethren now I'll tell you what now we need to use wisdom so what we're going to do we're going to preach the message but we're not going to let nobody know it we're not going to use Paul's name and we're not going to use Peter's name for people who have a problem with people quoting men your whole Bible is written by men what do you think they preached in the New Testament they preached about Peter they preached about James about John about Paul oh my brother Donnie those those were those were holy men they were and what was Paul's writings in that day to a bunch of them people they thought that's just that man's ideas you look at it today and reverence it as the scripture you think they did in that day the elect did and the other said well that ain't nothing but just his opinion where did he get that in the Old Testament that a woman can't preach where did he get that in the Old Testament of this that and other he couldn't prove it was in the Old Testament to save his life Paul quoted it and said a woman supposed to remain silent in the church as also saith the law you bring me that scripture and I'll lead it 47 ways the Old Testament does not say that but it silence is what Paul was quoting because it gave the woman no position to be a priest he was quoting The Silence of the law oh my oh he was a prophet do you believe that now of course we do now but what would you have done if You' have been in his day when we sneaked around Paul's writing said boy this is good stuff wow on us in Christ Lord have Mery oh for whom he did for know them he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren wow what a Bo i' like to preach that but where am I going to tell I got it at well just tell them just tell them oh I was praying I was praying and this come to me go ahead you lying dog I'm going to tell you one thing some of the worst lies you ever heard in your life as a preacher uhhuh well what if if I have to tell them Paul said that if you say that and you quote him then you're going to be identified with him ah you see that's the problem brother Donnie if you'd let me I could help you brother I could help you and you we can make our church so big and and and full of what full of what I'd rather have a handful that I could preach the truth to than thousands that you couldn't tell them nothing you imagine them be El to that day brother do they stood right said glory to God brother Paul said that we were chosen in him before the foundation you imagine said now wait a minute I want you to show me where Moses said that I want you to show me where Joshua said that but them elect just kept right on Roaring under the lion anointing there was a time the anointing of the men was necessary but we don't need it now amen now watch this just like the day of the lon or the ox of the man it's the it's the anointing of the hour now you see I used to preach under the man anointing I was a Pentecostal preacher so I was under that for many years the man anointed sir I didn't read no other books I didn't study no other preachers the only thing that I preached was the Bible or so I thought all I quoted was the Bible I could quote it like a machine gun I was known actually in my ranks but being able to quote it I still baptize in titles preach for women preachers preaching eternal hell why man anointed yeah the man anointing whenever Carol's Uncle tried to introduce me to water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and I come back to him with some man anointing and said I'd rather do what Jesus said than what Peter said man processing it through your mind oh come on Word of Life and you see many of us do the same thing today we'll try to process it through our head your head will never be able to boot believe what your heart can believe if your head will amen the word that's good but I found out a lot of times mine won't mine will go opposite from what the word says and you know the sequence of events should be that from the heart the man believeth unto salvation and with the mouth confession is made you see when we speak from here most of the time is when we get in trouble it's okay to think from here but here's God's Divine direction or protocol call that we think from here pass it through the filter here and let it come out right here but when we think from here and go straight to here that's some of the biggest messes you ever made in your life and you might as well say Amen why because we go straight from this knad of ours straight into them big fat lips of ours and then we have to go back and say I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that if we would run everything from here down to here and process it out of here a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold and pictures of silver Thou Art SN snared with thy mouth thou art snared with the words of thy mouth and thou art taken by the words of thy mouth for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned I wish somebody would hear me tonight and I'm afraid a lot of us are still trying to fight the devil in this last day when Satan is already on the verge of the fourth cycle of his anointing and we're St find trying to fight among cycle three there's only one way we're going to be able to withstand the power of the fourth cycle of Satan in the last days and that is the fourth cycle of God must anoint us as his people and then when we do we will be more than conquerors we will be more than able I don't care what Satan does of what he said we are anointed against [Applause] him you know how we are dealing with the passing of my daughter Erica your sister Erica Lance's wife the Parker girl's mother this is what I'm telling them we committ it to God we don't understand why we don't understand God's will but I trust him even when I don't understand you see that's my heart talking and not my head my my head is saying how in the world could that be all things work together for good them that love the Lord them which are called according to his purpose how in the world can that be for God to take a mother how in the world can that be for God to take a boy or God can take a little baby how in the world can that be don't you see what we're doing we're trying to process it through right up here but whenever you bypass that and come right down down here oh Hallelujah I'm the Lord God I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I tell him all the time Lord I remind you of your words that you said through Jeremiah I know the thoughts that I think toward you that they are good and they are not evil I don't understand why good the bad things happen to good people and I don't understand why real good things happen to bad people but they do but if I try to figure it out under the man anointing I will be so down I will be so weary but whenever I bypass my knucklehead and go straight to the heart my heart says my God makes no mistakes my god is perfect his ways are perfect he will work this out to his glory because he said so why then it comes to my heart out of my heart my mouth speaks [Applause] it Hallelujah so we got some message churches flying their banners and then some of them actually going this far now brother you can come preach for us but don't read no quotes and don't mention brother bram's name I'll tell you one thing a preacher tells me that neither me or Jesus is going to show up if this word ain't welcome I ain't either I don't want to be identified in that come on now don't get quiet on me I know this shocks some of you all you say oh my Lord you mean there's people around the message yeah that's what they are around the message why in the world would we not want to make it the Center focus of our life a Christ centered life under the eagle anointing that's what's going to get us out of here friend if it's not it what hope do we have is time going to go on and on and on there's got to be a Breaking of the cycle four breaks the cycle Hallelujah four breaks the cycle we're living in the age when the cycle of death is going to be destroyed when the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain are going to be called up to meet the Lord in the air how we going to do it under the man anointed no how we going to do under the ox under the Flying Eagle under the Flying [Applause] Eagle praise God it's Eagle time it it's the anointing of the hour it's the time that we're living in it's the working of the holy spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead the things that he said he would do just before the evening lights went out so people feel like they can be sort of you know just kind of straddling between three and four well you know we we want to go in the Rapture but that we don't want to be reproached the way you know brother Donnie no I'll tell you now him and some of them other guys nah there's got to be a there's got to be a way of more wisdom you mean cowardly more cowardly so I'm supposed to know the truth and to keep YouTube from Banning us I'm not supposed to tell you all and I'm not supposed to tell the thousands of people who stream us from around the world I'm just is supposed to hold that truth to me so does that mean I'm the only one going to the Rapture then and y'all's going to be left behind because I didn't tell you the truth no I won't be going either because he going to whoop the fire of me cuz I didn't tell you the truth so I figure the best thing to do is preaching the truth preaching the truth under the eagle anointing you decide if you want to go or not if you want to stay here with the men get under the men anointing but if you want to leave with the e ghost come on over brother oh Hallelujah come on young people come on sisters let's move under the anointing of the eagle in the last day hallelujah what is it the power of the resurrected Lord [Applause] Jesus I love this in the used to S as it was in the days of lot so will it be in the hours that the son of man will be revealed on the earth not Son of God no more son of man come back as the prophetic message don't you understand when people turn down this message whether they're in it or don't really even want to be in it to the first place they don't understand who who they're turning down I had someone to write me the other day and said this leaving the message after 30 some years and I wanted to get in a discussion with the man and ask him since you say you're leaving the message what does that mean exactly the message teaches salvation by the blood you believe in that the message teaches justification by faith you believe in that the message teaches the baptism of the Holy Ghost you leave in that the message teaches water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus you leave in that the message teaches all kinds of things that are scripture over and over and over again so when people claim they're leaving the message are they leaving that it's evident some of them did cuz they went back and baptized in titles under what the anointing of a man why because Matthew stood at that gate and said I'm guarding the name I'm guarding the name but the elect come up to the gate and said out of my way Matthew I don't know what that name is you ain't keeping me away from that name Oh Glory to God you ain't keeping me away from that name now luk don't you try to keep me out John don't you try to keep me out that gate might have been put there to keep some people out it wasn't put there to keep me out it was there to try my faith and my faith says there is one God hallelujah here oh Israel the Lord our God is one unto thee it was shown that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God and God himself said is there any other God beside me I know not one I know not one you ain't keeping me out [Applause] John but us learned Theologian will set in his study and they the Greek Scholars trying to understand the dip thong of the condominium of the m recular and we're just sitting there saying what' he [Laughter] say I'm glad the Bible tells me the Common People heard him gladly notice this the son of man will come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the lion not the ox and the sacrifice age paragraph 186 but in the last message that went forth there came a flying eagle it's Eagle time reveal time reveal time so not shut up time not well we we just can't understand it no it's reveal time as I told you here Sunday the world is calling for us to do the same thing they're calling for Israel to do ceasefire well give us three days give us five days and we'll quit fighting they're right in the middle of a battle and all the world said well it ain't right for y'all to kill all these innocent people was it right for all their innocent people to be killed for the women to be raped their babies bodies to be burned and their heads be cut off that's okay I suppose yeah we can see exactly how the world is they Anointed with that same spirit that was on Hitler and on them German people at that time of the of the age and yet we see that same thing is doing right now and they're trying to tell the bride the same thing oh brother Donnie get off the internet brother you're going to run every one of us yeah that's what a few of these preachers told me a few years ago brother back off back off you're going to bring reproach on all of us I said it's about time somebody does bunch of you Yap peny waste outfits won't stand out and preach the gospel won't baptize in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and scream it out won't let them know God s a Prophet come on somebody I ain't going to stand up and say well well well We believe We believe We believe what tell me what he said tell me what he said don't just tell me God God sent a prophet but tell me what did he have to [Applause] say now I know some of you think I've cracked up don't you think poor fellas he's just cracked under the stress well I might have maybe I'm the find of that little Eagle I've cracked out that Chell and I'm just just fixing to turn loose now don't forget this church and you Brethren on tap I want you to examine this how could man do anything else besides the power notice not theology not Doctrine alone but the power yes sir the power oh my of God that had been released to them I'm going to set this box box so he has a box there inside the pulpit that was used for prayer request and things so he picks that box up and he sets it up the pulpit so the people's eyes can be able to focus on that now he said I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain Spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by amen don't you understand I can't do nothing no different amen amen cuz different people could tell you I've tried to reason with brother Donnie I've tried to tell him you'd have more friends and you'd be you know use a little wisdom except I've found out for a lot of them when they use the word wisdom it has two different spellings because when they get done trying to explain to me wisdom I spell spell it c o m p r o m i s e compromise which ain't wisdom at all come on now Saints well I've tried to tell him you you just can't tell him it's it's like there's a power that drives him amen there's a power that drives me to tell you tonight rep it and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it will give you power over all the powers of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you but Brother Don even now even now but there never been so dark and the light ought to shine brighter now than it's ever shine before when I was under the man anointing I operated Ed and gave my best I preached like a Pentecostal I was deding the wool I run I screamed I hollered I shouted I run the backs of the pews I'd start hearing run the back sideway jump off the back and start back this way and run back the other way now you try don't you point your finger me and tell me to cuz I ain't going to do it either this Eagle would I doubt I get past brother John I'd be laying down on the floor y'all be burying me next week but what was it a season an anointing oh my and some of the things that we did you think what's out of our minds I remember one night up down the Duvall Valley preaching her and caring knows where it's at and I got under the anointing I reached down they had a glass of water setting I reached down put my fingers in that water and I started throwing that water all over people people started falling out they started shouting they like to tore that building down what do it mean brother Donnie I got them wet other than that I'm not sure what was it a man anointing come on now all dripping out of people's hands this going on that going on and the prophet identified it that was not what the word said they do what was it man well if it worked tonight I was going to try it again tomorrow night and if it didn't work tomorrow night I'd try it the next night why was the man anointing it did not have the understanding of an eagle you might shout tonight and you might cry for the next three weeks when you go to church but the important thing is follow the spirit of [Applause] God and you better believe you s Brother Louis hard on you all trying to get you to get in the service you ought have been under the the influence of some of our Pentecostal song leaders and I used to be a song leader and if you didn't move I would move you or I'd embarrass you one you was either going to clap your hands you was going to move you wern't going to stand there like a dead up dead dried up message stick the way some of our stand there in this day what was it anointing of the man and did it move them yeah got him emotional got him worked up but did it change a lot of them two weeks time they'd be right back out there doing the same thing they were before and that's what makes me about some of our own ranks I see the same things repeating her that we saw back Yonder [Music] [Applause] [Music] good but there's another Scout it's the scream of a mighty eagle get ready children Mount up on the wings of an eagle how can we conquer death if if we cannot conquer pornography how can we conquer death if we cannot conquer somebody talking about us in M we're mad enough to bust them in the mouth and you're fixing to change your [Applause] body dear Jesus let me find a place to close here that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them now we'll prove that to you by the history of the church by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose now we emphasize so much on the mechanics which is the doctrine the labor of the word but remember it always comes in part A and Part B mechanics and Dynamics and when God gives a promise or God gives a commandment there's a power to be released out of that commandment to give us the ability to live what he said amen amen absolutely and talking to my family with the passing of Erica these are the things for those that have asked me wanted to know how to deal with it this is the direction that I have led them that if God's will demands something of us even though he knows it will break our hearts he has an anointing and a power sir to release out of that will promise in order to help us to deal with it I've seen it so many times that the will of God will come in people's lives and they argue and they question and they debate and they go on and on and on and on and this not they never allow God to release the power out of that will I don't mind telling you sometimes the will of God is so painful is it not all those parts of the will of god brother Timothy That's So Glorious I told Carol day before yesterday I said think of it Carol I said if the Lord would have raised up Erica out of that hospital in Sycamore shs if she would have laid there and an absolute Miracle would have transpired we would still be talking about it we'd still be praising God we' be everybody that would meet in Walmart and wherever we'd try to bring it up in a conversation to tell oh you'd not believe what I God done I said but why are we this way why are we so sadden and yet if it's the will of God for her to go that way you believe what you want to I do not believe Satan can take us until God is finished with us do I understand it I do not understand it does that me the broken place in my heart it does not but I believe if it's the will of God he will release a power to Erica's family to Erica's church family to Erica's friends that will help us deal with the will of God he would not be God if he doesn't do it he releases an anoint anointing that helps us I believe he releases an anointing for the bride to live under in this last day Victorious above [Applause] sin God will not tell you to forgive and to love your enemies if he does not also provide a power with that commandment to help you do it but it's like any other promise of God you have to receive it hallelujah hallelujah there's not just theology that comes with this message there's power our sisters can dress like they ought to they can dress decently they can just say you know what I'm I'm I'm not going to dress like the world still don't mean they had the power of God to do it because many of them have traded it off we know that some of the men can do the same thing but if it's been released to you that it's not just a quote it's not just a scripture but the promise of God the box of the age a box so what what do you use a box for it contains something but you have to open it and release whatever's on the inside well said brother Donnie I've tried I've tried I've got self-help books I've got apps on my phone I've got positive confessions I've got this out the other all that is good but that's mechanics but you need to to tell father father I need the power out of this promise I need the power to to empower me how in the world could women that were pregnant and under the anointing of their age them soldiers would take swords and rip their bellies wide open and cut that baby from that Mother's belly and dash its brains out on rocks them men watch their wives be ripped open their children burnt you remember me reading to you telling you years ago about Sosa sister Sosa having seven sons and every one of them martyred for the cause of the Lord Jesus if God did not release to our sister the anointing out of the box for her age she would have become so resentful to God and you claim you're a god of love a god of Mercy you imagine sister Sosa coming back to church maybe the Pastor said we're going to have a Thanksgiving night we're going to read and we're going to pray if you got a burning testimony on your heart I don't want you to be able to give that and share it with the church Church imagine everybody looking around well the Lord saved me Hallelujah I I I was an old Corinthian out there I was doing this and that and the other I really got a lot to praise the Lord for they probably looking sister in fro since said pulls thing lost all them seven boys one of them was pulled behind horses horrific deaths just how they' done to the Jews horrific deaths imagine sister Sosa being one of the first ones glory to God can I give testimony go ahead sister sroa I want to thank the good Lord for his Mercy to me as y'all know the lord gave me seven wonderful boys I got to spend several years with them the Lord in his great wisdom allowed all my seven boys to go to heaven before me I just want to thank him tonight for the truth and I wanted to thank him because my hope is in Jesus and I ain't lost my boys I know where my boys are you imagine the rest of them saints sitting in the church God bless your heart I've been complaining about I couldn't pay my electric bill I've been complaining about this and that and other don't you understand when God will allow some of his people as I heard it said the other day God lets his greatest soldiers not get wasp stung God gives his greatest Soldiers the hardest battles yeah God will use them and out of there comes a testimony that others say praise God if she can go through that and have Victory I can face what I'm going through how did they do that brother Daryl the box was opened amen and the anointing sister Sosa probably thought Lord I I I could never do that maybe she heard about some sister that lost a boy oh Lord I could never do that oh God don't let that happen to me please I beg you God don't don't and all seven of hers taken and she thought I'll never be able to take a God I'll have a nervous breakdown I can't do it but the mercy of God said here you go sister sros this box has got your name on it y'all pardon me the Lord Jesus sent me a special delivery it's for my broken heart Scott mom with your name on it Lance sister Cynthia brother Greg Sister Crystal Alicia Parker girls Carol you friends of Erica's notice and watch for your delivery yes sir cuz the Lord will send it to you watch but it won't do no good if you put that somewhere and hide it put it away open it up brother sister oh oh Jesus thank you so much thank you thank you Lord Brother D what would it be help amen help amen oh no I need understanding well just because we think we need understanding ain't what we need at all sometimes what we need is trust and healing of our broken heart don't you love him so what do you figure should we change our Banner here at the church should we we've been here now not hardly a year should we change our Banner that we're you know we're just trying to use wisdom and we're not going to quite be as tough and and we're you know we're going to believe certain things but I just get the ministers together now Brothers you know we're we're concerned about really kind of filling this place up and don't preach no more on this and Don't Preach no more on that and and uh let's let's just let's just kind of hold up and we'll reach up and take that standard of holess down we'll Fold It Up put it away now we still believe it or but we're just not going to say much about it we're going to take that Malachi Fork flag down in a couple years or less you wouldn't hardly recognize this church nor these people so you say my life will only be here for a while I'm replaceable I call if you are if the Lord carries I'll go by the way of the grave and yall will put in someone else or your children will wonder what a kind of man they look for will it be one that still stands under that Banner will it be one of more of a modernistic taste I hope not I hope not I hope as long as it's here it stands for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection and his changing power can we bow our heads oh hallelujah what about it young people you young men standing here you Sisters You Brothers some of you a few more settings of the Sun and your life will be gone may we not fail you where will we be found may we fly this Banner High maybe we not break our ranks I'm called to stand in this ranks of the message that God give me strength never to leave it anyone else here tonight like to be remembered God help me that I'll never leave the ranks of where you've placed me men women boys girls preachers deacons trustees those of you that are streaming tonight may God help us that we'll be at our post most I Ain talking about just this church building I'm talking about in Christ Jesus heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth Lord we're asking you tonight Jesus that you would help us Lord we know that as the world is calling for Israel to have a ceas fire and we know if they ever give in they give three days then they'll want five then they'll want seven then they'll want 10 and every day they take off their enemy is regrouping and it's going to cost them more lives more Israeli soldiers will die but that's the voice of the world and yet this little tiny State about the size of New Jersey sets there and basically the whole world against it so far America still standing with her and not forcing the ceasefire same with us people wants us to ceasefire quit preaching this quit preaching that quit preaching something else and what if we obey them Lord what will our church turn into theirs exactly and I look at some of them voices that want us to quit preaching this and that and I look at what their church is and I say no that's not what I want our church to be I want our church to be a church to where Sinners can come in and be set free by the power of God where people can be delivered of demon spirits and Men of God that are so Anointed with the Holy Ghost can speak to them evil spirits and they'll come out where people can receive the Holy Ghost where people can be healed and people's lives can be changed and then the the call will come and we'll be changed out of this world we know this it's not by signs only but it's by the preaching of the word of God help us father I don't know how many more days I've got how many more years I've got to preach I desire to be faithful and true Lord help me help me Jesus oh Lord help each one of us here tonight father that we will not join in with the devil on a ceas fire but we'll let him know right here again tonight you better run and get while the getting's good cuz I'm going to blast your hide I'm going to do everything I can against the kingdom of hell you might as well get used to it devil we are not ceas firing we are not quitting we're pressing on harder than ever before Oh Grant it Lord may that be our determination tonight father I pray in the name of Jesus thank you Lord praise God than Lord how many feels that way tonight before the Lord oh now friends I'm not telling you that the devil's going to like it huh but those of you that was right here Sunday you saw at the end of that service how I preached brother Zach come up for prayer I simply bend over and turn my head and when I turn my head down and a little bit sideways vertigo hit me just like that I thought it was going to fall flat on the floor brother Joel Brown come Carol told me and brother D I think come up had to help me Carol had to drive me home I couldn't even set up you know what it was the Devil he's bold ain't he but we're Boulder we know we've got an enemy but we know him well and we are not afraid of of him we are more than conquerors are we not what do you say we fly this same standard that Paul flew that we will stay in our ranks and whenever the time is made then we will walk I will stand there as your pastor and we will walk up under the opes of the seventh Angels Ministry the seventh angel will then in turn present us us to the Lord Jesus remember he did not see any of Paul's people the preachers of this day are not going to stand with Paul oh no message preachers think they know more about the Bible than brother bam did and they're going to stand with Paul no you ain't you're going to stand right there with Elijah and it'll be him that you'll look to well come on them voices told him the ones that was changed ain't none of y'all been there yet so I'm going to take what they say Jesus
