[35:43] morning no don't give up on your
[35:49] [Music]
[35:52] faith cuz it's almost a morning
[36:00] [Music]
[36:04] [Applause]
[36:16] praise the
[36:17] Lord how many's been there in those
[36:19] Lonely
[36:21] Nights maybe you're there today and
[36:24] you're
[36:24] facing things that you've never faced
[36:27] before or sometimes it can be repetitive
[36:30] things that you faced but the grace of
[36:33] God will always be there won't he thank
[36:36] Lord he loves to get his children in
[36:39] such a spot sometimes that they don't
[36:42] know what to do which way they're going
[36:43] to
[36:44] turn brother B said he loves it it's
[36:46] strange you know you'd think a father
[36:48] would love that but he loves to get his
[36:51] children to such a difficult spot that
[36:53] your back is against the Red Sea and the
[36:55] Egyptian Army is behind you and there
[36:57] seems like there's absolutely no way out
[37:00] and here he comes and he loves to
[37:02] manifest himself that way praise the
[37:05] Lord aren't you happy to be a child of
[37:07] God serving a wonderful father like that
[37:11] tonight let's turn a few go to the Book
[37:13] of Matthew chap 16 ver
[37:16] 18 we'll read together there and also 1
[37:19] Timothy chapter
[37:21] 3 we greet you tonight in the name of
[37:24] the Lord Jesus what a wonderful
[37:27] opportunities given to us to represent
[37:29] our Lord and his
[37:31] kingdom I want you to think tonight as
[37:34] we look into the scripture that we are
[37:37] part of the government of God on the
[37:40] Earth We're part of a kingdom a great
[37:44] portion of that kingdom is invisible but
[37:47] there is a portion that is visible and
[37:50] we are part of that visible part but
[37:53] we're driven by the
[37:55] invisible Moses Moses had an experience
[37:59] with such a thing so many many years ago
[38:01] but the Bible says that he saw him who
[38:04] was invisible so that's kind of peculiar
[38:08] isn't it you're going to see somebody
[38:10] who is
[38:11] invisible but if you ever see him your
[38:13] life will be changed forever amen so
[38:16] hopefully we can see him tonight in our
[38:20] presence the invisible part as well as
[38:24] the visible
[38:25] part
[38:27] and I say also unto thee that thou art
[38:29] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[38:33] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[38:36] Prevail against it how many believes
[38:38] that with all your heart the Gates of
[38:40] Hell shall not Prevail against it now
[38:44] Paul in 1 Timothy chapter 3:14 giving
[38:46] the the position of the church the New
[38:49] Testament Church remember it hadn't been
[38:51] that long in the gospel now to where
[38:54] that this was written 1 Timothy let me
[38:58] see 2 Timothy 66 1 Timothy been around
[39:02] 6162 a something like that so about 30
[39:06] years so the revelation of what God had
[39:09] been doing in the body had certainly
[39:11] become more clear but Paul wrote things
[39:14] about the body that the rest of the
[39:16] Apostles even Peter said he writes
[39:18] things it's hard to be understood this
[39:20] no doubt was one of them these things
[39:23] write I unto thee hoping to come un thee
[39:25] shortly
[39:26] but if i tar long that thou mayest know
[39:30] how thou oughtest to behave behave
[39:33] thyself in the house of God which is the
[39:37] Church of the Living God the pillar and
[39:42] ground of the truth now listen to the
[39:45] adjectives that he uses to describe this
[39:48] body of Christ how thou oughtest to
[39:50] behave thyself in the house of God so
[39:55] we're not just talking
[39:57] about how that when we come to this
[40:00] building here how we ought to behave
[40:02] ourselves that's important we know
[40:04] that's very important to God but how we
[40:06] ought to behave
[40:08] ourself in the house of
[40:11] God in the house of God each one of us
[40:16] is members in that house so your
[40:19] behavior can affect
[40:22] me my behavior can affect you so if we
[40:26] know how to behave oursel in the house
[40:29] of God and where do we get such teaching
[40:32] and training well we get it in this
[40:34] house of God we get it in this house
[40:37] here so that it will teach us how to
[40:40] behave oursel in the house of God which
[40:43] is he says the Church of the Living God
[40:47] we know this building isn't that one day
[40:49] it'll be destroyed totally annihilated
[40:51] so he's teaching us more than just the
[40:54] church house as we call it the the
[40:56] pillar and ground of the truth how many
[41:00] would say tonight Lord open my
[41:03] understanding have a prayer call here
[41:05] tonight from Sister Sandy bagot it's
[41:09] concerning her brother-in-law uh Dennis
[41:12] fleeman has a real rare form of cancer
[41:16] and they've been doing some tests and
[41:18] things on him I think they turn in
[41:19] actually maybe require prayer request
[41:21] and you Bou on Sunday so apparently
[41:23] they've got some of the results back and
[41:26] um
[41:26] it's a very serious situation so we'd
[41:28] like to uh pray for him tonight how many
[41:31] else has a need on your heart maybe a
[41:33] person or a thing or situation in your
[41:36] life let's just take it to the Lord
[41:38] right now Heavenly Father we know it's
[41:40] such a great privilege and opportunity
[41:43] that we can bow our heads to the dust of
[41:45] the earth to know that our father so
[41:48] many many years ago our Father Abraham
[41:52] when you were going to make known to him
[41:55] your Covenant and you told him first to
[41:59] look at the sand and you said if you can
[42:01] count the sand that will be the number
[42:04] of your seed then you raised him
[42:07] up and looked him up toward heaven and
[42:11] he lifted his eyes and said now look to
[42:13] the
[42:14] stars and if you can tell the
[42:17] Stars so the prophet picked that up and
[42:21] he used these words from dust to
[42:25] Stars so that's what we are here tonight
[42:28] from the dust of the earth we have been
[42:30] elevated by the new birth and our
[42:33] election becoming more clear and more
[42:36] plain every day so we're rising from
[42:39] dust to stars on our loved ones pass
[42:43] from us they go from dust into that
[42:47] Realm of the heavens not that they
[42:49] become a glistening star shining in the
[42:52] night sky but they move into that Realm
[42:56] of heavenly bodies when you were here
[42:59] Lord Jesus you said in my father's house
[43:03] are many mansions but we know it's not
[43:06] castles palaces but it's bodies
[43:11] Tabernacles we're so thankful that we
[43:13] have one but we know as we go through
[43:16] this life this old body here can
[43:18] certainly become Afflicted with anxiety
[43:21] and worry and sickness and disease and
[43:24] trouble so we bring these requests to
[43:27] you tonight father I pray for this
[43:29] request from Sister Sandy Lord you see
[43:32] the situation the diagnosis that they've
[43:35] given to Dennis and we're praying God
[43:37] for your mercy to him Lord you know the
[43:40] status of his soul has been some time
[43:43] since I've talked to him so I really
[43:45] don't know where he's at there but you
[43:47] do father so we're praying not only for
[43:50] his body but if there's anything lacking
[43:53] in that soul that you just deal with him
[43:55] Lord Lord we know what what a diagnosis
[43:59] like this can be to hear it from a
[44:00] doctor it can be heartbreaking but Lord
[44:03] God we believe that you're a God of
[44:05] Miracles a god of the supernatural so
[44:08] we're praying that you'd move for him
[44:10] for his family now Lord we all here
[44:13] tonight have a need we've assembled
[44:16] ourselves together that we could sing
[44:18] and pray and worship now we've come to
[44:21] the breaking of the bread of life and we
[44:24] need your help I need your help no doubt
[44:27] more than anyone here because I've
[44:29] studied I've prayed I've applied myself
[44:32] but yet it takes the anointing on me to
[44:34] help me to be able to convey what you
[44:37] put on my heart but they also need the
[44:39] anointing to be able to receive it so
[44:42] would you speak to us tonight father and
[44:44] then when the service is over we will
[44:46] say did not our hearts burn within us as
[44:50] he talked with us along the way granted
[44:52] I pray father in the name of the Lord
[44:55] Jesus
[44:56] amen God bless you you may be
[45:03] seated you know the government of the
[45:05] Lord Jesus is something that certainly
[45:08] been misunderstood down Through the
[45:11] Ages the greatest
[45:13] misunderstanding probably has been
[45:15] brought by those that are in the
[45:18] so-called church and we know of course
[45:21] that in 325 ad whenever they wanted to
[45:26] form a government which was contrary to
[45:30] Apostolic Doctrine then they begin to
[45:34] change the shape and the ideology of the
[45:39] way that people would look at the word
[45:41] church from that point on so since 325
[45:46] ad when it got worse and worse under the
[45:49] different um Emperors the Romans and
[45:52] then of course changed to to the
[45:54] pontificate or the popey himself then
[45:57] with the uh Wars that would go on under
[46:01] the great conquerors they would take
[46:03] over Jerusalem they would face the Moors
[46:06] they would come against the muhammadans
[46:09] they would kill them supposedly in the
[46:12] name of the Cross they would kill them
[46:15] in the name of the Christianity
[46:18] so-called they would have Christ on
[46:21] their Shields Christ on their ornaments
[46:24] and all that sort of thing and it began
[46:27] to change a mindset of what people
[46:30] thought about the church we know of
[46:33] course that that had nothing to do with
[46:35] the church that Jesus himself
[46:38] established is that right that's not
[46:40] what Jesus is even talking about yet to
[46:44] this day many of the Muslims still
[46:47] identify us as Christians with that and
[46:51] they say that's what the early
[46:53] Christians done there wasn't one one
[46:56] Holy Ghost filled child of God in that
[46:59] mess I can tell you that right now there
[47:02] wasn't one of them went around killing
[47:04] people and cutting their heads off
[47:07] killing their babies and doing all that
[47:09] nonsense is that right yet they done it
[47:12] in the name of a church and I agree with
[47:16] that but it was not in the name of this
[47:19] church that the Lord Jesus established
[47:22] then as we go along the denominations
[47:25] and from the mother they came down to
[47:27] become the daughters then the daughters
[47:30] would start accepting to their ideology
[47:34] what their government would be so each
[47:36] denomination would make its own
[47:38] government and they have their own
[47:40] government to this day and they have in
[47:42] their headquarters where it's in
[47:44] Cleveland Tennessee or wherever it is
[47:47] around the world and they will have
[47:49] their their order by which they do
[47:52] certain things they will also have their
[47:55] discipline Ary action by which if a
[47:58] minister and their denomination does not
[48:01] follow what they teach then they will
[48:04] discipline him and they will discipline
[48:07] that church so once the denomination of
[48:10] course if they build the building then
[48:13] they own that building so if you try to
[48:15] pull away from that building you can't
[48:18] really do much about it because the
[48:20] denomination itself funnels the money in
[48:23] which gives them great control of what
[48:25] goes on and then people think well
[48:28] that's God's government that has nothing
[48:30] to do with God at
[48:34] all it is a man-made system controlled
[48:38] many times by men which don't know a bit
[48:41] more about God than a rabbit would know
[48:44] about
[48:45] snowshoes they know nothing about God
[48:48] they quote his Bible but as far as
[48:50] knowing the person of God they know
[48:53] nothing about God and Satan did that
[48:56] first of all to deceive the multitudes
[48:59] and the masses down to the age but he
[49:02] also did it to be able to make a
[49:05] scarecrow so that then that would make
[49:08] those that are independent which we are
[49:12] that would make every independent child
[49:16] of God it would make them resent almost
[49:20] any form of government even gods
[49:26] because Satan took the false and made a
[49:31] scarecrow and it worked so well it
[49:34] scares
[49:35] Eagles now that's quite a scarecrow
[49:38] whenever you can take a scarecrow and
[49:41] scare Sons and Daughters of God can you
[49:44] imagine how Hell must laugh when sincere
[49:49] honest people are scared to death of
[49:52] scriptures and quotes because because
[49:55] they are so terrified of a scarecrow I
[49:59] imagine Satan that must be one of his
[50:02] greatest days in the regions of the lost
[50:07] when saved people are terrified to hear
[50:11] a servant of God read scripture read
[50:14] quotes and put together God's
[50:18] declaration himself and Satan and his
[50:21] demons watch the saints of God free up
[50:26] he watches them as they just sat there
[50:29] and they shudder and it just almost a
[50:32] terror comes over them why the Scarecrow
[50:38] the scarecrow has worked so effectively
[50:42] on them that they think oh my goodness
[50:45] I'll be glad when he gets done with this
[50:47] oh Lord Oh Lord where's he going where's
[50:49] he going straight in the scripture
[50:52] straight in the message of the hour but
[50:54] watch the scary about it it's the
[50:57] Scarecrow and the Scarecrow is so
[51:00] effective it even works on children of
[51:04] God now to me that is a sad scenario I
[51:08] see scarecrows should work on Crows but
[51:12] they should never work on eagles they
[51:15] should work on all that out there of
[51:17] course but it should have no fear tactic
[51:20] at all on a child of God and I hope
[51:23] tonight by the grace of God that we are
[51:25] going to be able to look into the
[51:27] scripture are you willing to take a walk
[51:30] with me in the word of
[51:32] God and we will be able to once we are
[51:35] done to look in and say okay I see I see
[51:40] why Satan has always wanted me to be
[51:44] afraid because of my past affiliation
[51:47] with this church or that church or this
[51:50] certain man that was nothing but a
[51:52] dictator now remember you don't have to
[51:54] belong to an organization to have a
[51:57] spirit of organization on you there's
[52:00] been many preachers around this message
[52:02] that have been as independent as they
[52:05] could be they were not controlled by
[52:07] headquarters they were not controlled by
[52:09] a bunch of men they were controlled by
[52:12] one man so whether you're controlled by
[52:14] one or 500 it's still the same Spirit of
[52:18] organization if it makes any man your
[52:22] head over Christ the word now that can
[52:25] even be your father or it can be your
[52:28] husband or it can be a businessman or it
[52:32] can be a preacher or it can be one pushy
[52:35] Deacon in a church that thinks he's got
[52:38] the upper hand and the say over
[52:40] everybody else well y'all are getting as
[52:42] quiet as a bunch of church house mouses
[52:45] already so you see people get their mind
[52:48] that it just has to be the preacher oh
[52:51] no I've known many many businessmen and
[52:55] this message that were just as
[52:57] controlling if not more so than any
[53:00] preacher I ever met you remember reading
[53:03] in your Bible there was a man that John
[53:08] began to write about doct tropies and he
[53:11] said that he would not even let the
[53:14] saints of God receive John sir now can
[53:18] you imagine what a control di atrophies
[53:22] had over the local assembly you know Di
[53:25] fees was not a preacher but he was a
[53:28] wealthy businessman and does had such
[53:33] control that John called his name and
[53:36] John said that he would not receive the
[53:39] men of God and he wouldn't even let the
[53:42] church receive him so here you had a man
[53:46] with a denominational Spirit on him and
[53:49] he was controlling the Assembly of God
[53:51] you know as I read that I've never
[53:53] understood for the life of me why the
[53:56] church would ever let that happen you
[53:59] think why in the world would the Church
[54:01] of the Living God ever allow a
[54:04] businessman to get such control in the
[54:08] assembly that they would not set that
[54:10] man down and say you sat down and shut
[54:14] your
[54:17] mouth I guarantee you some of you would
[54:19] do it to
[54:20] me you do it to me and you ain't got
[54:24] enough guts to to do it to a rich man I
[54:27] call you a panty waste
[54:32] [Music]
[54:34] coward well thank you Jesus praise the
[54:39] Lord but you see whether it's a preacher
[54:42] or whether it would be a man with so
[54:44] much money he don't know what to do with
[54:46] it well as far as God's concerned there
[54:48] ain't no difference between them money
[54:50] might say something to us but it sure
[54:53] don't say nothing to God is that right
[54:56] so God don't want the onean preacher God
[54:59] don't want the businessman God don't
[55:01] want a controlling Deacon or a
[55:03] controlling song leader whoever God
[55:06] doesn't want one person anywhere
[55:10] controlling the body the body is
[55:13] Sovereign within itself as you know you
[55:17] have the ability to vote me out you have
[55:21] the ability to vote in your deacons your
[55:24] trust sees all those offices but yet I
[55:28] don't have the ability to vote you
[55:31] out now boy we go to talking about Fair
[55:35] somehow or another that seemed like I
[55:37] got the short end of the stick on that
[55:39] deal but yet that's the way God set it
[55:43] up now he did that for a reason you
[55:45] believe that he knew that would be
[55:47] controlling men that would come in and
[55:51] take over so he allowed the apostles to
[55:54] be be able to write to us and give us an
[55:58] Apostolic Forum that would set it up for
[56:01] the ages that are to come and then the
[56:05] prophet picks it up the quote we read
[56:07] last Wednesday spoken words original C
[56:10] his shoulders is his body whereas the
[56:13] government on the Earth's act it's his
[56:16] body Saints shall judge the Earth is
[56:20] that right so not just preachers now but
[56:23] the Saints will actually
[56:25] judge Angels so Saints whenever they
[56:29] come into that glorified body God will
[56:33] make Fallen Angels walk before you right
[56:38] and you will judge them now Paul runs
[56:42] this parallel about the government being
[56:45] in the saints of God and some of the
[56:48] Corinthian folks were having arguments
[56:50] in the church and 1 Corinthians 6 I
[56:52] believe it is and he says what Would You
[56:55] all take one another to law don't you
[56:58] know that the saints of God will judge
[57:01] Angels so he said why would you take
[57:04] such matters then to to the law when it
[57:07] should be brought before the saints of
[57:09] God so Paul was bringing something to
[57:12] the assemblies that they would be able
[57:14] to recognize the government of God on
[57:17] the earth is actually in the church so I
[57:22] understand a lot of the message folks
[57:23] don't believe it that way I understand
[57:25] that the majority of Christendom does
[57:27] not believe it that way but I do cuz I'm
[57:30] a Bible believer amen I'm not just a
[57:33] Christian I'm a Bible believing
[57:36] Christian now you'd be surprised how few
[57:38] there are in the
[57:39] message cuz you show them the Bible and
[57:42] you show them the message they'll look
[57:44] right at it but I believe it this way
[57:47] well that shows you're not a Bible
[57:48] believing Christian you're only certain
[57:51] passages of the Bible well
[57:55] Hallelujah somehow I didn't think this
[57:57] is going going to go over this way
[57:58] tonight now watch the saint shall judge
[58:02] the Earth where's the government going
[58:03] to be upon upon the shoulders his body
[58:07] the government upon the shoulders that's
[58:09] a part of the body what is it his
[58:11] Earthly strength God's Earthly strength
[58:16] is his word made flesh in his body here
[58:21] on Earth bringing it to pass now now if
[58:25] people really believe that there's no
[58:28] way you're going to convince me that
[58:30] people would have the same idea about
[58:34] sitting at home and playing a tape on
[58:38] church service
[58:40] night they if they really believed what
[58:43] this Prophet just said right here they
[58:46] would know that every time according to
[58:49] what them tapes say if God is in your
[58:54] heart
[58:55] you cannot wait for them Church doors to
[58:59] come open now you understand why a lot
[59:02] of these people don't do that it's quite
[59:04] simple God is not in their heart it's
[59:08] just as simple as it can be it's not
[59:10] complex you know now notice this this is
[59:13] how that the administrative value of the
[59:16] body of the government of God on the
[59:18] earth will be orchestrated he never
[59:20] committed it now to a group of men that
[59:23] a group would come together at at this
[59:26] Council and that Council and they'll
[59:28] decide on this and that and the other
[59:30] God no God God don't trust that but God
[59:33] designated a way by which he would do it
[59:36] now he said you can only serve God as
[59:39] you and believe the servants that God
[59:42] sends you can only serve God on Earth
[59:46] see as God's servants that sent on Earth
[59:50] by divine inspiration interprets the
[59:54] word to you so it's not a group it's not
[59:59] somewhere at headquarters but God
[1:00:01] chooses and Seven Ages he chose the
[1:00:04] messengers of those ages is that right
[1:00:08] then God would anoint them being the eye
[1:00:12] and the horn and they would catch the
[1:00:14] message of God for that day now the
[1:00:18] reformers would go back to what was
[1:00:21] written but remember if God's got
[1:00:24] something something else that he wants
[1:00:26] to say which is not actually written in
[1:00:29] the pages of the Bible now I know that
[1:00:32] makes some folks that say they believe
[1:00:33] the message their nose get all wrinkled
[1:00:36] up but that's your nose and your problem
[1:00:38] because I look at the prophet of our day
[1:00:41] being in the same caliber as any of them
[1:00:44] of the Old Testament or any of them of
[1:00:46] the new now somehow some of y'all may
[1:00:49] look at our Prophet as being just a
[1:00:50] minor boy and one that really ain't got
[1:00:53] the authority well first of of all I'm
[1:00:55] not sure you understand what a prophet
[1:00:57] is a prophet is a Divine interpreter of
[1:01:00] the written word not only that but if
[1:01:03] God has something he wants to say he
[1:01:06] will convey that through his Prophet on
[1:01:08] the earth at that time God can't do that
[1:01:11] to me cuz I'm not a
[1:01:13] prophet praise the Lord God can't do
[1:01:16] that to any other Pastor any other
[1:01:19] teacher any other evangelist that can
[1:01:21] only happen to a word prophet and
[1:01:24] somebody said amen now God does it that
[1:01:28] way so watch he said he that heareth you
[1:01:31] heareth me and he that despises you
[1:01:34] despises me he that despises me despises
[1:01:38] him that sent me that proves that God
[1:01:41] speaks his message through his servants
[1:01:45] always has that's right no it's amazing
[1:01:50] how people look at Authority and
[1:01:54] subjection most people look at
[1:01:57] subjection as depriving them of
[1:02:01] authority but actually that's backwards
[1:02:05] you see when God designates a certain
[1:02:08] protocol in his body then every person
[1:02:12] in that order of protocol gets in their
[1:02:15] position and there they stay they are
[1:02:19] actually enabled with the spirit of God
[1:02:22] to give them the authority they need to
[1:02:25] carry out their particular office now
[1:02:29] when they step out of that position
[1:02:32] because they look at Authority above
[1:02:34] them and they resent that and they say
[1:02:37] oh no no no I I could never be under
[1:02:39] pasture I could never be under a prophet
[1:02:41] and you see that ain't just so with Ley
[1:02:44] but preachers get to the same place so
[1:02:47] preachers will get an idea of what they
[1:02:50] think in their mind and yet somebody
[1:02:52] will show them something in the message
[1:02:54] of the hour that's contrary and you know
[1:02:57] what they'll do now I know this
[1:02:59] firsthand because I've done it for
[1:03:01] decades to preachers you know and you
[1:03:03] hear a preacher say this or that or the
[1:03:05] other thing well maybe he don't know no
[1:03:07] different so you send him one quote and
[1:03:09] then another quote and then another
[1:03:10] quote then it becomes one page two page
[1:03:12] three page four page 40 pages 50 pages
[1:03:16] and then he comes right back and said
[1:03:18] well yeah I I know that but I still
[1:03:20] believe it this way well you see what
[1:03:22] that man just did he stepped out from
[1:03:25] under the protocol of God under the
[1:03:27] headship of a church a messenger
[1:03:30] everybody following me and instead of
[1:03:32] getting more Authority he lost more
[1:03:37] right why because we are empowered we
[1:03:41] are empowered as long as we stay in our
[1:03:45] position I I was meeting with some
[1:03:47] people last night and someone had a
[1:03:49] question about hair and as I begin to
[1:03:53] look at that in 1 Corinthians s chap 11
[1:03:55] and I begin to show this family which is
[1:03:57] part of our church and I show them that
[1:03:59] what Paul is dealing with about the
[1:04:01] woman having long hair and the man
[1:04:03] cutting his hair and I went the verses
[1:04:06] above the hair verses and showed them
[1:04:09] the protocol of God and that was that
[1:04:11] Paul was dealing with authority
[1:04:14] submission subjection and so on so he
[1:04:17] said that the man his head is Christ and
[1:04:22] that the man was of course the head head
[1:04:24] over the woman and God the spirit the
[1:04:27] invisible was the head over Christ now
[1:04:30] Paul sets the order of the protocol so
[1:04:32] here we've got the invisible God then we
[1:04:35] have the Christ the anointed Humanity of
[1:04:37] God then we have the man and then we
[1:04:39] have the woman now each one of them have
[1:04:41] a head except for the Eternal one and he
[1:04:44] is the head then after you set that in
[1:04:47] order then Paul comes down and he goes
[1:04:50] to talking about a man having long hair
[1:04:53] now he said says nature itself would
[1:04:55] teach you that it's a shame for a man to
[1:04:57] do that so then a man that would come in
[1:04:59] here and a man would get up and pray
[1:05:01] with a hat on or a man would get up and
[1:05:04] pray with shoulder linked hair or long
[1:05:06] hair then we'd look at him and say hey
[1:05:08] buddy that ain't right you're not
[1:05:10] supposed to do that well why do we
[1:05:11] believe that because we believe when the
[1:05:14] man does that he brings a part of
[1:05:17] femininity over onto his own body and he
[1:05:21] changes his image I I hope you're going
[1:05:23] to understand this but way back in the
[1:05:25] 70s when the hippie move started it was
[1:05:28] the Forerunner of the transgender saying
[1:05:31] we're dealing with right now you see if
[1:05:34] this transgender thing if they would
[1:05:36] have started that in the 70s well a
[1:05:39] bunch of them old hiil and tennesseeans
[1:05:41] that'll run them out years ago and
[1:05:42] they'll whoop the fire at of them and
[1:05:44] there would been no transgenders in this
[1:05:46] day so that didn't go over but what they
[1:05:48] do Satan knows how to put it in just a
[1:05:50] little at a time he don't never show you
[1:05:53] the poison rotness that he wants to give
[1:05:56] you but he wants to give you just a
[1:05:58] little bit of bad covered over with a
[1:06:00] whole lot of good and then what he does
[1:06:02] little by little he takes away more good
[1:06:05] and gives you more bad giving you more
[1:06:08] more bad less good more bad less good
[1:06:10] and then he Springs this big major stuff
[1:06:14] and you're thinking Lord have mercy I
[1:06:16] can't believe that I never thought it'd
[1:06:18] be that way of course that's the way he
[1:06:21] does so Paul was showing them from man
[1:06:24] to have long hair that he's bringing
[1:06:27] femininity upon himself for the woman to
[1:06:30] have short hair or cut hair then she's
[1:06:33] taking away from her image of what God
[1:06:36] made her to have her long hair and she's
[1:06:39] bringing the masculine image upon
[1:06:41] herself by doing so she Rebels out from
[1:06:45] under her head so when a man then has
[1:06:48] long hair what is it a sign of his
[1:06:51] Rebellion against the image of God so so
[1:06:54] when a preacher then will refuse to line
[1:06:56] up with the word of God he's doing the
[1:06:59] same thing so in other words Jesus has a
[1:07:02] right to put that preacher away in
[1:07:05] spiritual divorcement right just like a
[1:07:08] man has a right to divorce his wife now
[1:07:10] it don't mean that he will and it don't
[1:07:12] mean that he has to but whenever a
[1:07:14] preacher Pastor H who he is will not
[1:07:17] come subject to the teaching of the word
[1:07:19] of the day then that man is walking on
[1:07:23] very very very dangerous ground because
[1:07:26] if he does not repent and line up under
[1:07:29] the headship of God for the age he will
[1:07:32] be put away in
[1:07:36] divorce oh my goodness friends this is
[1:07:39] serious things this is very serious but
[1:07:42] now do even a lot of the message people
[1:07:45] who say they believe every word that
[1:07:47] that that statement just about makes me
[1:07:49] sick in my stomach whenever I hear some
[1:07:51] of them saying it because they don't
[1:07:53] believe 100th of every word much less
[1:07:56] every word if they believed every word
[1:07:59] they would find a church and said Under
[1:08:02] A God Called pasture and they would
[1:08:04] associate with the family of God and
[1:08:06] they would be identified with the family
[1:08:09] of God and instead of staying home and
[1:08:11] pressing
[1:08:16] play tell me how can you fulfill the
[1:08:19] scripture in the book of Hebrews forsake
[1:08:22] not the assembling of yourselves to
[1:08:23] together as the manner of some is how
[1:08:26] can you do that and say you can be as
[1:08:28] good a Christian being home you're lying
[1:08:31] God's Prophet said you cannot do it amen
[1:08:35] so they don't believe what he said now
[1:08:37] watch first Thessalonians chapter 1
[1:08:40] verse6 watch now Paul he wanted to
[1:08:43] assert his Apostolic position not that
[1:08:47] he could be a lord over God's people
[1:08:50] Peter even used that word he said that
[1:08:53] we would be be a lord over the heritage
[1:08:56] of God they never done that so that they
[1:08:58] would be a lord over the people of God
[1:09:02] but so that the people of God would be
[1:09:04] able to take their word as it was God's
[1:09:07] word himself so he must establish this
[1:09:12] Apostolic Authority so he said you
[1:09:14] become followers of us and of the Lord
[1:09:19] having received the word in much
[1:09:22] Affliction with joy
[1:09:24] of the Holy Ghost now watch Paul is
[1:09:26] identifying the real Believers of that
[1:09:29] age by the way they followed his
[1:09:33] teaching now the question is if you
[1:09:35] would have lived and this is 1
[1:09:37] Thessalonians around 55 ad so if you
[1:09:40] would have lived in 55 ad brother Nathan
[1:09:43] instead of
[1:09:44] 2024 what would have been our attitude
[1:09:48] toward these books right here so these
[1:09:51] books were being passed around among the
[1:09:53] churches and the people were accepting
[1:09:55] them and saying that these were the
[1:09:58] words of God but yet we know that they
[1:10:02] were written by Paul and sometimes by
[1:10:05] Luke as Paul would dictate to Luke and
[1:10:08] yet others are some that that that ain't
[1:10:10] the word of God that's just the words of
[1:10:13] them men you mean you were going to take
[1:10:16] that that book of Thessalonians and put
[1:10:19] it on the same level as the Torah you're
[1:10:23] going to put Romans and Corinthians and
[1:10:26] Philippians and and Timothy and Titus
[1:10:29] and Hebrews you you you people are going
[1:10:31] to put that on the same basis as Genesis
[1:10:35] and exodus and Leviticus and numbers and
[1:10:38] Deuteronomy you're going to put that on
[1:10:40] the same basis that's God's Prophet
[1:10:44] Moses what would you have said yes we
[1:10:49] are praise the Lord yes we are
[1:10:54] now watch again in 1 Thessalonians
[1:10:58] 1:7 so that ye were amples to all that
[1:11:03] believe in
[1:11:05] Macedonia and aaya now watch how that
[1:11:09] followers produced in
[1:11:13] samples so they become followers of Paul
[1:11:18] and true followers not in word only but
[1:11:22] in deed and in spirit then they actually
[1:11:26] become the word that he preached in so
[1:11:30] much that he would say that ye are
[1:11:33] written Epistles read and known of all
[1:11:37] men so God a lot of people want to leave
[1:11:41] it now well just the prophet of the age
[1:11:43] just the prophet of the age and there
[1:11:44] are certain things that apply only to
[1:11:46] the prophet of the age we know that but
[1:11:49] if the examples of this message of the
[1:11:52] hour stop with brother brandom then it
[1:11:55] does not fulfill the apostolic
[1:11:58] fulfillment of the Bride being restored
[1:12:01] back to the apostolic Foundation because
[1:12:04] it did not stop with Paul it did not
[1:12:07] stop with Peter but the real Believers
[1:12:10] become an expression of Paul's
[1:12:15] message now they were not worshiping
[1:12:17] Paul they were not going around talking
[1:12:19] about Paul more than they talked about
[1:12:22] Jesus but I can imagine if you would
[1:12:24] have been sitting in them churches and
[1:12:26] yes they had churches and yes they went
[1:12:29] to
[1:12:31] church praise the
[1:12:33] Lord notice again in 1 Thessalonians
[1:12:36] chapter 2:14 for ye Brethren became
[1:12:41] followers of the churches of God now
[1:12:46] this is not the Cleveland the other
[1:12:48] Mountain assembly either and it's not
[1:12:50] the Church of God of Prophecy either
[1:12:53] there ain't no such a thing in the Bible
[1:12:56] but it was the real Church of the Living
[1:12:59] Gods I want you to notice now the
[1:13:01] brethren in
[1:13:03] thessalonica which was made up of many
[1:13:06] Gentiles you Brethren became followers
[1:13:10] of the churches of God so whenever the
[1:13:12] churches started following Paul then
[1:13:15] what was going on the Law of Spiritual
[1:13:18] reproduction was happening they then
[1:13:22] were affecting other people's lives by
[1:13:25] that word that they heard and they
[1:13:27] thought this is absolutely wonderful I
[1:13:29] want to be a Christian like that I want
[1:13:31] to walk that way I know they were not
[1:13:33] making Idols no doubt of these people
[1:13:35] and they were not assuming that they
[1:13:37] were higher than what they were but they
[1:13:39] were simply following their ample which
[1:13:43] God had given to Paul for ye Brethren
[1:13:45] became followers of the churches of God
[1:13:48] which in Judea are in Christ Jesus you
[1:13:51] also have suffered like things of your
[1:13:53] own countrymen even as have they of the
[1:13:57] Jews now notice where they were
[1:13:59] suffering it from the Jews so the Jews
[1:14:02] which were holding the law of Moses and
[1:14:05] they were righteous and this and that
[1:14:07] and they were some of the greatest
[1:14:08] persecutors there was of the real
[1:14:11] children of god notice chapter
[1:14:14] 5:14 now there has to be if there's
[1:14:17] going to be government if there's going
[1:14:20] to be a body and there's going to be
[1:14:24] regulations and
[1:14:25] Regulators then there has to be order
[1:14:29] and there has to be a way that we will
[1:14:32] deal with people that will step out of
[1:14:35] line on
[1:14:38] occasion now listen what they did in the
[1:14:41] New
[1:14:41] Testament now we exhort you Brethren
[1:14:45] warn them that are
[1:14:50] unruly now listen warn
[1:14:53] them that are unruly friends don't get
[1:14:57] all bent out of shape don't get all
[1:14:58] nervous and all uptight I ain't fixing a
[1:15:01] call nobody's
[1:15:05] name notice we exhort you Brethren warn
[1:15:08] them that are unruly look at the meaning
[1:15:12] of the word
[1:15:14] disorderly out of ranks often so of
[1:15:21] soldiers irregular inordinate deviating
[1:15:25] from the prescribed order or Rule now
[1:15:30] Paul knew of course as well as Peter and
[1:15:32] the rest of the Apostles that there was
[1:15:34] going to be people that would come
[1:15:36] around and they would Buck against as we
[1:15:39] call it the order of God they knew they
[1:15:43] would so now Paul is not only going to
[1:15:45] tell them look what I'm writing to you
[1:15:48] is the Commandment of
[1:15:52] God that's settle right so then Paul
[1:15:56] must also tell them what to do when
[1:15:59] certain people wouldn't walk according
[1:16:01] to that order from
[1:16:04] God well praise the Lord notice I found
[1:16:08] another meaning of this word the word
[1:16:11] means careless out of line it was
[1:16:15] applied to a soldier who would not keep
[1:16:19] rank but
[1:16:21] insisted on
[1:16:24] marching his own
[1:16:27] way now Paul didn't say well just ignore
[1:16:31] them and just let it go nothing will
[1:16:35] come of it but Paul first said warn them
[1:16:40] now we exal you Brethren warn them that
[1:16:43] are
[1:16:46] unruly and I always find this amazing
[1:16:48] that the next thing he would say is
[1:16:51] Comfort the feeble-minded
[1:16:53] uhhuh I'll tell you why a lot of times
[1:16:57] we'll read another scripture here
[1:16:58] momentarily but it will be the
[1:17:02] feebleminded the
[1:17:04] weak on that will follow such
[1:17:08] people real scriptural trained people
[1:17:12] check every move they make by the word
[1:17:15] amen well praise the Lord now he says
[1:17:19] now exort your brethren warn them that
[1:17:20] are unruly so the the body of God is an
[1:17:24] army is it not so each of us then have a
[1:17:28] designated Rank by God and in that rank
[1:17:32] we will March at a certain place so this
[1:17:36] then is a person who is constantly
[1:17:39] breaking Rank and their rank is supposed
[1:17:43] to be at a certain position when they
[1:17:44] say no no no no no no no no no no I know
[1:17:49] I can do more than this I'm greater than
[1:17:52] this my potential is so much
[1:17:57] greater and they're all the time moving
[1:18:00] out of the rank and getting up and
[1:18:02] getting into things that they don't have
[1:18:04] the ability to take care of come on
[1:18:07] now now I know y'all know here that you
[1:18:09] only have one pastor but you actually
[1:18:12] have several hundred Associates
[1:18:16] okay cuz nearly everybody here has got
[1:18:18] an opinion how the church ought to be
[1:18:20] run come on and a lot of them tell me so
[1:18:28] now y'all's toes was crumpled up like
[1:18:30] this and your shoes now they
[1:18:34] went notice he says so
[1:18:37] warn
[1:18:40] warn
[1:18:42] warn which a lot of preachers don't do
[1:18:45] anymore they don't give out
[1:18:48] warnings why CU people don't want to
[1:18:51] hear them yeah right but Paul said warn
[1:18:55] them warn them that are unruly Comfort
[1:18:59] the feeble-minded support the weak be
[1:19:02] patient toward all men 2 Thessalonians
[1:19:06] chapter 3: 6
[1:19:09] now
[1:19:12] we
[1:19:15] uhoh we command you
[1:19:20] brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:19:22] Jesus Christ yes sir now we're moving
[1:19:26] into a different line here so we have a
[1:19:31] command from a prophet of
[1:19:35] God everybody going to do that you okay
[1:19:38] with that is that what you want you want
[1:19:39] you want to follow the
[1:19:42] commands now he said we command you
[1:19:45] brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:19:48] Christ that ye
[1:19:51] withdraw yeah yourselves from every
[1:19:56] brother that walketh
[1:19:59] disorderly and not after the
[1:20:04] tradition which he received of
[1:20:08] us
[1:20:10] wow now Paul is here not only telling
[1:20:13] the people of church in thessalonica but
[1:20:16] to us as well we believe that right so
[1:20:19] look at the meaning of this word
[1:20:21] withdraw
[1:20:24] to remove
[1:20:26] oneself withdraw oneself to depart to
[1:20:31] abstain from familiar
[1:20:35] fellowship with
[1:20:38] one but I wonder how many Christians do
[1:20:43] this and yet it's a
[1:20:46] command in God's
[1:20:51] word if you can't say Amen could you at
[1:20:54] least say ouch so I know you're still
[1:20:57] alive thank you now we
[1:21:01] command brethren in the name of the Lord
[1:21:04] Jesus Christ that ye withdraw yourselves
[1:21:07] from every brother so we're not talking
[1:21:10] about now that the saints of God are
[1:21:13] hanging around drunks Liars you know I
[1:21:16] mean these people that don't even
[1:21:18] profess Christianity but this is from a
[1:21:21] man who is claiming to be a brother of
[1:21:25] course it can be a preacher it can be a
[1:21:27] deacon it can be a a a good man as
[1:21:30] people
[1:21:34] say amen well it's getting hot in here
[1:21:36] ain't
[1:21:38] it okay so we are supposed to withdraw
[1:21:42] ourself from every brother that walketh
[1:21:46] disorderly oh oh no don't tell me it's
[1:21:50] the same meaning the same same
[1:21:53] word attack Taos out of ranks often of
[1:21:58] soldiers irregular inordinate deviating
[1:22:01] from the prescribed order or Rule now
[1:22:06] why is Paul saying this he knew Satan
[1:22:11] would not stay from without the ranks of
[1:22:16] this great Army of God that's right he
[1:22:19] knows he's going to move in just like he
[1:22:21] did in the Garden of Eden
[1:22:23] so Paul is giving them a heads up on
[1:22:27] what to do when Satan come among
[1:22:31] them you know what's so sad about it
[1:22:35] with that
[1:22:36] warning a lot of them never even
[1:22:39] listened if they would have done this
[1:22:41] down Through the Ages a lot of the false
[1:22:45] preachers and false doctrines and false
[1:22:48] moves that has been since the very
[1:22:50] beginning up till now
[1:22:53] the saints of God would have had the
[1:22:55] ability to put a Hulk to it
[1:23:02] immediately but it's the
[1:23:05] saints that don't obey this now this is
[1:23:08] not to the
[1:23:10] Sinners the Christians are the ones that
[1:23:14] starts giving an ear to false teachers
[1:23:17] and false prophets on oh my praise the
[1:23:21] Lord now what they should do is take it
[1:23:24] right back to the word and check it by
[1:23:26] the word and say wait a minute wait a
[1:23:27] minute now wait a minute this brother
[1:23:29] here I'll tell you one thing he's not
[1:23:30] saying what the prophet said he is not
[1:23:33] he is not carrying it out he's skipping
[1:23:35] over this he's skipping over that I know
[1:23:38] somebody confronted him on that and he
[1:23:40] he said oh yeah yeah yeah right right
[1:23:41] right right but he still don't admit he
[1:23:43] was wrong a preacher that won't admit
[1:23:46] he's wrong and the word is right you
[1:23:49] better run from him big time cuz that
[1:23:53] man's going to lead you straight to the
[1:23:54] tribulation
[1:23:59] period look friends if you're bride God
[1:24:02] will never set you under a preacher that
[1:24:05] ain't preaching a rapturing message we
[1:24:09] need more than healing we need more than
[1:24:12] shouting and jumping and I believe in
[1:24:14] all of that don't you but I need a
[1:24:17] rapturing message as
[1:24:20] well oh my
[1:24:23] notice the power of this verse now can
[1:24:26] you imagine some of the people in
[1:24:28] thessalonica and Corin uh and some of
[1:24:32] the other cities that begin to get this
[1:24:34] book as it was shared around well really
[1:24:37] what in book for it been more like a
[1:24:38] script or a scroll and they would have
[1:24:41] read it oh brother Larry I'd say some of
[1:24:43] them got some mad that said who does he
[1:24:46] think he
[1:24:47] is who does he think he is who put him
[1:24:50] in charge Jesus
[1:24:57] right well praise the Lord as a matter
[1:25:01] of fact Jesus put him in charge of this
[1:25:04] disciplinary action that would be set
[1:25:06] down through the church ages Peter never
[1:25:08] even addresses it this way nor does
[1:25:10] James if Paul hadn't done it we wouldn't
[1:25:13] have had it in the entire
[1:25:15] scripture so Jesus put him in charge of
[1:25:21] it hope that don't choke
[1:25:24] you
[1:25:27] notice I we command you brethren in the
[1:25:30] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you
[1:25:32] withdraw yourselves from every brother
[1:25:35] that walketh
[1:25:37] disorderly and not after the
[1:25:42] tradition oh you see it's a common thing
[1:25:44] it must have been in that day as it is
[1:25:47] today one that people will say well I
[1:25:49] I'll take everything that brother random
[1:25:52] said was thus sayith the Lord but all
[1:25:55] the rest of it you
[1:25:59] know maybe just his opinion might be
[1:26:03] right might not be right but if now if
[1:26:06] it's thus sayith the Lord then I'll take
[1:26:09] it so Paul said you're not only
[1:26:11] responsible for thus sayeth the Lord
[1:26:14] that I
[1:26:15] teach but the Traditions good yes
[1:26:20] sir anybody need a drink to help get it
[1:26:25] down now friends why is this strange why
[1:26:29] is this strange scarecrows going all up
[1:26:31] everywhere Lord have mercy I'd say some
[1:26:33] people's done kicked off the internet
[1:26:34] their computer done blowed up my say oh
[1:26:37] Lord Oh Lord where brother Donnie going
[1:26:39] well where does it look like to you I'm
[1:26:40] going straight into the Bible your Bible
[1:26:43] your Bible that you should spend more
[1:26:45] time
[1:26:47] reading now notice what tradition means
[1:26:52] ordinance tradition by
[1:26:56] instruction the
[1:26:58] substance of the
[1:27:00] teaching so you understand it was not
[1:27:04] necessary that Paul include a thus sayth
[1:27:08] the Lord after every scripture have you
[1:27:11] looked in any of Paul's writings and
[1:27:14] took an account of how many times when
[1:27:18] Paul said now this is thus sayeth the
[1:27:21] Lord
[1:27:24] are them the only ones you're going to
[1:27:27] read well you see people don't look at
[1:27:29] the teaching of the message and the same
[1:27:32] way they do the New
[1:27:34] Testament it's like they don't
[1:27:36] understand the substance of the teaching
[1:27:39] yes thus sayeth the Lord exactly right
[1:27:42] but I also believe the teachings of the
[1:27:47] message I believe the
[1:27:50] traditions of of
[1:27:55] Paul and as a matter of fact if you
[1:27:58] don't you won't go in the Rapture you're
[1:28:03] excluded because you broke your rank and
[1:28:07] you said well I think and I now I'm
[1:28:11] asking you who put you in
[1:28:13] charge CU it sure wasn't Jesus I mean a
[1:28:17] bunch of us didn't even have enough
[1:28:18] sense to know if it's one God two Gods
[1:28:20] three Gods God's going to put you in
[1:28:22] charge come on we didn't even know our
[1:28:25] way out of Darkness we wouldn't even be
[1:28:27] saved today if it wasn't for the grace
[1:28:28] of God we didn't know how to worship God
[1:28:31] we didn't know how to pray we didn't
[1:28:33] know if there's one God two God three
[1:28:34] Gods many gods we didn't know but we
[1:28:37] needed a godsent leader we needed a
[1:28:42] prophet in this age and yes he would say
[1:28:45] thus sayith the Lord but he would also
[1:28:47] have sound solid
[1:28:51] teaching
[1:28:53] amen sir praise the
[1:28:56] Lord notice now in chapter 3: 7 for
[1:29:01] yourselves know how you ought to follow
[1:29:06] us verse n not because we have not power
[1:29:11] but to make ourselves an ample unto you
[1:29:17] to follow us now what's he doing this
[1:29:20] for he knows people are going to follow
[1:29:25] somebody everybody's going to follow
[1:29:27] somebody if it ain't nobody but your
[1:29:29] wife or your
[1:29:30] mother yeah amen it's in
[1:29:34] humanity it's in humanity to look up to

[1:30:14] influence you to read your Bible pray
[1:30:16] get closer to
[1:30:20] God of course most of them preachers

[1:30:30] followers oh my goodness notice in verse
[1:30:34] 14 and if any man

[1:30:43] epistle then just act like everything is
[1:30:46] fine and don't nobody say anything and
[1:30:50] don't nobody you know just just act like
[1:30:53] everything is fine cuz we're covering it
[1:30:56] by love this ain't the kind of love I'm
[1:30:58] preaching about on
[1:31:00] Sunday that's the lay of seeing ooey
[1:31:02] gooey
[1:31:04] nonsense notice now what Paul says if
[1:31:07] any B obey not our word by this epistle
[1:31:11] our
[1:31:13] word a't it amazing brother a Paul
[1:31:15] didn't say God's
[1:31:17] word come
[1:31:19] on hello
[1:31:24] now listen what Believers are supposed
[1:31:27] to
[1:31:28] do
[1:31:29] note that
[1:31:32] man so if a man don't do Paul said what
[1:31:35] I'm
[1:31:37] teaching then you're supposed to note
[1:31:39] that man or Mark him put a check on
[1:31:44] him and then not him is part one part
[1:31:49] two is have
[1:31:55] no
[1:31:57] huh to mix together to keep company be
[1:32:02] intimate with
[1:32:04] one now you see this doesn't just apply
[1:32:08] to preachers it doesn't just apply to
[1:32:11] older
[1:32:13] people it can also apply to the
[1:32:17] youth all you needs one young boy or one
[1:32:20] young girl and gets in the youth group
[1:32:24] and they go I don't like this and I
[1:32:25] don't like that I don't like something
[1:32:28] else they go to complaining about this
[1:32:30] and complaining about that now don't sit
[1:32:32] there and look at me like you you young
[1:32:34] ones are a bunch of angels your mama and
[1:32:36] daddy sitting there looking at me like
[1:32:37] you are but you and I both know you
[1:32:40] ain't
[1:32:41] right and our church is like every other
[1:32:44] church and I hate this about us we're
[1:32:47] too
[1:32:48] clish we've got our own little three or
[1:32:51] four more no more shame on us we need to
[1:32:55] reach beyond our little cliff and reach
[1:32:58] beyond our little Clan come on somebody
[1:33:00] say
[1:33:01] [Applause]
[1:33:06] Amen thank you brother friend help us
[1:33:10] Lord so then a person that did not obey
[1:33:14] don't you understand friend why is Paul
[1:33:16] saying that is he trying to control the
[1:33:18] Saints he's trying to eliminate a lot of
[1:33:22] trouble in their lives and a lot of
[1:33:24] trouble in the
[1:33:28] church but wonder how many listen to
[1:33:30] them and yet we say we believe this word
[1:33:33] of God hallelujah I'll die for that
[1:33:36] Bible you might ought to read it first
[1:33:39] before you make that
[1:33:41] statement or you could say it this way
[1:33:43] I'll die for what I know all three
[1:33:45] verses
[1:33:46] Hallelujah I may change my mind after I
[1:33:49] know 15 but right now I'm firm on them
[1:33:51] tree that I know Hallelujah to
[1:33:56] God
[1:33:57] mama if any man now he didn't say
[1:34:00] excluding preachers excluding deacons
[1:34:03] excluding Sunday school teachers
[1:34:05] excluding old brother so and so and old
[1:34:08] sister so and so he put everybody in the
[1:34:11] same category said If any man obey not
[1:34:13] our word by this epistle note that
[1:34:16] man and have no company with him and
[1:34:20] this is the reason reason why that he
[1:34:23] may be
[1:34:26] ashamed now I wonder how much trouble
[1:34:28] down through the church ages would have
[1:34:31] totally been stopped by the government
[1:34:34] of the
[1:34:37] body so whenever the thing began to
[1:34:40] raise up about the nicians in the first
[1:34:42] church
[1:34:43] age it was already there the spirit was
[1:34:47] so the coldness and they didn't want the
[1:34:49] prophet said they begin to cry out them
[1:34:51] them you know fancy people come in and
[1:34:53] got saved and they didn't want no more
[1:34:54] of them jumping shouting screaming
[1:34:56] hollering people so they wanted to get
[1:34:58] away from that or what if the Church of
[1:35:00] the Living God would say hold
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:04] it you're not saying what Paul
[1:35:07] said so therefore you sir are a
[1:35:13] liar come
[1:35:16] on I just quoted your a quote except for
[1:35:20] the word sir I did
[1:35:22] that I guarantee if we had more of that
[1:35:25] going on in this day we'd have a whole
[1:35:27] lot less junk to deal with in our
[1:35:31] lives somebody goes to come to you after
[1:35:33] church with the latest gossip let me
[1:35:35] tell you so who some of the worst
[1:35:36] gossipers I know
[1:35:39] preachers I'm telling you what some of
[1:35:41] the preachers around this message they
[1:35:42] worse than women oh Lord
[1:35:45] Jesus oh my you get around them boy they
[1:35:48] got to K up on this and catch up on that
[1:35:50] catch up on some something
[1:35:53] else my goodness Brother Don what in the
[1:35:57] world are you doing I'm preaching for a
[1:36:00] Revival you say Revival yeah don't you
[1:36:03] remember when brother B stood on the
[1:36:04] great one of the Great Lakes there and
[1:36:06] he said the water was coming up through
[1:36:07] there and all the trash is blown out he
[1:36:09] said what was happening he said that
[1:36:10] Lake Michigan was having a Revival there
[1:36:13] was one more drop of water than what had
[1:36:15] had when it started but all the tri was
[1:36:17] washed out on the B that's what we need
[1:36:20] a bunch of Tri washed out on the B
[1:36:22] brother sister then you talking about
[1:36:24] having Revival we'll have
[1:36:27] one and it won't last from Youth Camp to
[1:36:30] Youth Camp and banquet to banquet it'll
[1:36:32] last from now through eternity praise
[1:36:36] God notice again in Hebrews 6:12 that
[1:36:40] you be not slothful but followers of
[1:36:43] them who through faith in patience and
[1:36:47] herit to promise now he's giv them
[1:36:49] Direction on who to follow follow again
[1:36:52] Hebrews 12:7 or 13:7 most people know
[1:36:55] the next verse I've heard very few quote
[1:36:59] the prior verse remember them which have
[1:37:03] the rule over
[1:37:06] you who have spoken unto you the word of
[1:37:10] God whose Faith follow considering the
[1:37:16] end of their conversation isn't it
[1:37:19] amazing that we don't quote verse seven
[1:37:21] right along with verse 8 so you're
[1:37:23] pointing to Men of God that have led you
[1:37:27] thus far and the end of those men of
[1:37:30] God's
[1:37:31] conversation is Hebrews
[1:37:33] 138 so you see a man of God that that's
[1:37:36] not the end of his conversation
[1:37:39] run I mean run even in the cold weather
[1:37:42] run if I ever get to a spot at the end
[1:37:45] of my conversation it's not that he's
[1:37:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:37:49] have an election boot me out
[1:37:52] praise the Lord notice whose face follow
[1:37:55] praise the Lord considering the end of
[1:37:59] their conversation Jesus Christ the same
[1:38:03] yesterday and today and forever may it
[1:38:07] always be my theme may it be the end of
[1:38:10] my conversation oh how many wants it to
[1:38:13] be yours notice again now Romans chapter
[1:38:16] 16:1 17 now you see the government ain't
[1:38:19] fun is it

[1:38:35] to do such and such and so and so and so
[1:38:37] and somebody's going to say what in the
[1:38:39] world we need that bill for in Carter

[1:41:44] which cause divisions so the divisions
[1:41:48] are those who cause divisions that may
[1:41:50] be surrendered to separate the people it
[1:41:53] can be into groups or it can be into
[1:41:56] clicks or little Clans you know those
[1:41:59] who calls different groups of people and
[1:42:03] it becomes a faction and then they will
[1:42:06] get their own little friends and their
[1:42:08] own little cliches and it'll happen in
[1:42:11] the church you know and they've got
[1:42:12] little certain little things that they
[1:42:14] do to one another and they'll do it in
[1:42:15] church I see them doing it sometimes and
[1:42:17] they'll do little things to one another
[1:42:19] and they'll sit there and giggle at one
[1:42:20] another
[1:42:22] I'll put up with it for a while but I'm
[1:42:24] warning you kids don't try my
[1:42:28] patience amen this is a house of God it
[1:42:32] is not a gym it is not a ballroom it's
[1:42:36] not a ballr it's not a place to play we
[1:42:40] come here to worship we don't come here
[1:42:42] to giggle we don't come here to tap one
[1:42:45] another in the side come on somebody
[1:42:48] we're not coming here to ride on your
[1:42:50] Notepad and let your girlfriend see it
[1:42:52] beside then she writes something else
[1:42:54] we're here to hear the word of God take
[1:42:59] heed take
[1:43:03] warning oh my notice Paul now I pray I
[1:43:08] know y'all are praying oh God help him
[1:43:10] help him help him talk fast now Lord
[1:43:11] talk fast isin't it amazing when I get
[1:43:13] on these good things how I slow down
[1:43:14] ain't it amazing it's just awesome the
[1:43:17] way that works ain't
[1:43:19] it now see your brother Mark which cause
[1:43:23] divisions so as I said it doesn't have
[1:43:24] to be a preacher of course so it will be
[1:43:27] those that will cause divisions in the
[1:43:29] body in the government in the government
[1:43:33] of the body and they will try to divide
[1:43:36] of course that's the way Satan always
[1:43:38] does so he said I beseech you Brethren
[1:43:40] mark them which cause divisions and
[1:43:43] offenses now look at this word I don't
[1:43:45] if you ever looked at it or not but it's
[1:43:47] the Greek word scandalon it's where we
[1:43:49] get our English word
[1:43:52] Scandal
[1:43:54] Scandal that's what offenses are
[1:43:56] stumbling block thing that offense the
[1:43:59] movable stick or
[1:44:03] trigger of a
[1:44:06] trap so then a hunter would set a trap
[1:44:10] and he would set a
[1:44:12] stick and then whenever the animal would
[1:44:14] either come by it or he would get in and
[1:44:17] take the bait and a string would be
[1:44:19] attached to the bait
[1:44:21] and whenever he moves it the stick Falls
[1:44:24] and the door closes behind him and now
[1:44:27] he's
[1:44:29] caught do you understand that's what
[1:44:31] some people are they're the stick in a
[1:44:37] trap and they will do their best to coax
[1:44:41] you into their trap now look just try
[1:44:45] one little puff just try one little shot
[1:44:48] one little this or that the other it
[1:44:50] it'll make you feel so good oh it'll
[1:44:53] help you it'll do this and that and the
[1:44:55] other and that friend of yours is
[1:44:56] nothing but that stick in the door and
[1:44:59] they're trying to get you to come in and
[1:45:01] take the bait and then when you grab it
[1:45:04] the door
[1:45:05] shuts you ought to see them after I deal
[1:45:09] with them when they've been on alcohol
[1:45:12] and drugs and marijuana for years can't
[1:45:16] even walk can't even several words
[1:45:19] together you think they ever saw that in
[1:45:22] the Trap of course
[1:45:25] not now this is why Paul is saying this
[1:45:28] in the body not to be a boss not to be
[1:45:31] somebody all right I'm getting everybody
[1:45:33] under my thumb don't you understand why
[1:45:35] preaching like this is so needful for us
[1:45:37] all it's to spare us of a lot of
[1:45:40] Heartache it's to spare us of a lot of
[1:45:44] scandals in our
[1:45:49] lives I beseech you Brethren
[1:45:53] Mark Mark remember God put a mark on
[1:45:59] Cain he's the first one with the mark of
[1:46:03] the
[1:46:06] beast so here Paul is telling us mark
[1:46:11] them mark
[1:46:15] them why so other people can know that's
[1:46:19] a troublemaker
[1:46:21] that is a stick in the
[1:46:24] trapo I'm going tell you friend some
[1:46:26] of's going to disagree as far as days
[1:46:27] from not and I really don't care I think
[1:46:30] I wish sometimes that them Devils them
[1:46:33] social media people that come up with
[1:46:36] social media I wish they had have never
[1:46:38] done such a thing I believe it's been
[1:46:40] one of the greatest detriments to
[1:46:42] humanity that's ever been on the face of
[1:46:44] the earth I find it so amazing how many
[1:46:47] country western Stars how many Hollywood
[1:46:49] stars how many of these rich and famous
[1:46:52] people will not allow their own
[1:46:55] children to get on social media I heard
[1:46:58] of several this week and they said they
[1:47:01] were not I'm talking about Hollywood
[1:47:03] people that live and dress and act like
[1:47:06] Jezebels and everything else but they
[1:47:08] said they would not allow their children
[1:47:11] to get on social media because of the
[1:47:14] impact on their lives and I Lord have
[1:47:17] mercy and here we got Christians that
[1:47:20] don't even watch what their children
[1:47:22] feed
[1:47:29] on Amen y'all like to send me and Carol
[1:47:33] to Bora Bora somewhere for a month's
[1:47:36] vacation oh some of y'all want to send
[1:47:38] just to Bor Bor that's right across the
[1:47:40] road over here you know Bor Bor now
[1:47:43] beseech you Breen mark them which cause
[1:47:45] divisions and offenses contrary to the
[1:47:49] doctrine
[1:47:51] not that thus sayith the
[1:47:53] Lords but the
[1:47:56] doctrine that ye have learned and this
[1:47:58] is what you're supposed to do to
[1:48:04] them
[1:48:06] what now the question is this do we
[1:48:09] believe this or do we
[1:48:13] not now so that'll make them be lost so
[1:48:16] that'll make them go to hell so they
[1:48:17] will be
[1:48:19] ashamed
[1:48:21] and hopefully
[1:48:25] repent look at the word avoid and we'll
[1:48:28] close and y'all say glory to
[1:48:31] God avoid to turn
[1:48:35] oneself
[1:48:36] away to turn away from to keep
[1:48:41] aloof from one
[1:48:43] Society oh yes read the last
[1:48:49] three
[1:48:54] this is God's
[1:48:57] government do we want it or not or do we
[1:49:01] want the soft
[1:49:05] leoan you will choose after
[1:49:09] tonight you see that's the thing that
[1:49:12] always breaks my heart when I have to
[1:49:15] preach certain elements of Truth Carol
[1:49:18] can tell you whenever I'm going to
[1:49:21] preach things or even if I'm going to
[1:49:22] have to meet with somebody and I've got
[1:49:24] to deal with them in in certain things
[1:49:26] of the scripture I get so tore up for
[1:49:30] days she said what's the
[1:49:33] matter and I'll tell her I know what I'm
[1:49:36] going to show them is going to be so
[1:49:38] straight from the scripture and the
[1:49:39] message and they'll do one of two things
[1:49:42] they'll embrace it or they'll walk away
[1:49:45] from it do you understand when we hear
[1:49:47] truths we will never be the same again
[1:49:51] we will embrace it and say thank God for
[1:49:53] the
[1:49:54] truth or we'll say I ain't doing it I
[1:49:57] don't care how much he says he can
[1:49:59] scream and holler and shout and spit and
[1:50:01] do whatever he wants to do I ain't doing
[1:50:05] it that's so
[1:50:09] sad let's stand
[1:50:12] together now notice Verse
[1:50:16] 18 for they that are such
[1:50:24] serve not our Lord Jesus
[1:50:27] Christ but their own
[1:50:30] belly by good fair speaking smooth and
[1:50:36] plausible address which simulates
[1:50:42] goodness good words here you go that's
[1:50:46] what some of these good preachers preach
[1:50:50] words that are
[1:50:51] plausible and simulate
[1:50:57] goodness now listen what Paul says these
[1:51:00] people that cause
[1:51:02] offenses by good words and fair speeches
[1:51:08] blessing
[1:51:10] Bounty
[1:51:12] praise fine
[1:51:14] discourse polished
[1:51:17] language language art ful
[1:51:21] adapted to
[1:51:23] Captivate the
[1:51:26] hearer I may be known for a lot of
[1:51:29] things right that won't be one of
[1:51:32] [Laughter]
[1:51:33] them so this is what people will do
[1:51:38] they'll use good words and fair speeches
[1:51:41] now I want you to notice now
[1:51:44] who it will
[1:51:48] deceive
[1:51:50] and it'll deceive the
[1:51:52] hearts of the
[1:51:55] simple not those who really have depth
[1:51:58] and not those who really look into the
[1:52:00] word and search the
[1:52:02] word but the simple many times the
[1:52:06] simple think they know so
[1:52:10] much but they don't know enough to check
[1:52:12] it by the
[1:52:14] word my for they are such that serve not
[1:52:17] our Lord Jesus Christ but their own
[1:52:20] belly and by good words and fair
[1:52:24] speeches deceive the
[1:52:26] hearts of the
[1:52:29] simple now I wonder how many if we would
[1:52:32] know the number from the time this was
[1:52:36] written in
[1:52:37] Romans around 55 ad and we bring it down
[1:52:40] to 2024 how many Christians how many
[1:52:44] churches how many moms and dads how many
[1:52:47] young Christians did not apply this
[1:52:50] in their life and they run across
[1:52:52] somebody that was telling them good
[1:52:55] words and telling them plausible words
[1:52:57] and Artful words that was put together
[1:52:59] in order to deceive
[1:53:01] them and pull them away from the
[1:53:03] teaching of their mom and dad pull them
[1:53:05] away from the teaching of a
[1:53:07] church and then when they got out into
[1:53:09] this depths of sin and they looked back
[1:53:10] and realized Lord God what am I doing
[1:53:12] here what happened to me but if they
[1:53:16] would have judged that friend by the
[1:53:18] word
[1:53:20] if they would have judged that preacher
[1:53:22] by the word or that Deacon or that
[1:53:26] whoever it is by the
[1:53:29] word and say they lost 10 15 years of
[1:53:33] their lives and then they're at the end
[1:53:35] of it and they're trying to pick up all
[1:53:37] the broken pieces and bring all the mess
[1:53:40] of their life listen
[1:53:43] friends the judgment will declare it
[1:53:46] You' not believe the people that I meet
[1:53:49] huh don't get in your mind that I only
[1:53:51] counsel with people from our church I
[1:53:53] counsel with people from all kinds of
[1:53:55] churches message churches and
[1:53:57] denominational
[1:54:01] churches and they come to you with the
[1:54:03] Clutter and the mess of their
[1:54:06] life and they don't know what to do and
[1:54:08] you try your best to tell
[1:54:10] them God have mercy one of the saddest
[1:54:13] parts of my job is I will sit there and
[1:54:16] tell them knowing they're not going to
[1:54:18] do it they will not do it they'll walk
[1:54:21] right out that door with their mind
[1:54:22] already made up you think how can people

[1:58:38] that because they love them our pastor

[1:58:45] hides Lord Jesus we approach you tonight
[1:58:48] father

[1:58:52] make a
[1:58:53] shout we don't really feel like running
[1:58:55] around the
[1:58:56] building after a sermon like this but oh
[1:59:00] Lord God how grateful I am for your
[1:59:06] government I've watched some of these
[1:59:10] preachers that have turned and walked
[1:59:14] away from this great
[1:59:17] message I see what they
[1:59:20] become it's like to have no guide no
[1:59:25] leadership nothing is a boundary to say
[1:59:28] what's right and wrong and what they
[1:59:30] used to consider wrong they don't
[1:59:32] consider wrong
[1:59:33] anymore so
[1:59:36] sad oh Jesus I'm grateful tonight for
[1:59:39] the boundaries of your
[1:59:41] word I'm so grateful Lord to us we don't
[1:59:45] look at it as bondage we look at it as
[1:59:48] protection

[1:59:54] and church enti looks at us and says oh

[2:00:01] walls we're up on top of these walls
[2:00:03] looking out and said oh we're so
[2:00:07] protected Behind These Walls and our
[2:00:09] youths are so protected from so many

[2:00:37] will why on Earth would I want to why on
[2:00:41] Earth would I want to walk away from
[2:00:43] this great protection I feel so
[2:00:46] protected in my little humble spot

[2:00:53] I'm not looking for a liberty where I
[2:00:55] can override what he taught I'm not
[2:00:57] looking for some uh education some PhD
[2:01:02] or whatever more that I can feel like I
[2:01:04] can straighten Paul out I just feel
[2:01:08] really protected walking in my little
[2:01:11] spot if I ain't nothing but a tater
[2:01:14] peeler Tater peelers are pretty
[2:01:16] important at supper time whatever you
[2:01:19] want me to be God is exactly what I want
[2:01:22] to be I do not want to break my
[2:01:25] ranks if I'm nothing but a tater Peter I
[2:01:28] don't want to get in my head I'm a
[2:01:29] general cuz I'll bring my own deaths and
[2:01:33] the deaths of those that'll follow me
[2:01:36] help each of us to find our place in the
[2:01:38] ranks every sister here Lord every
[2:01:42] brother help them to realize it is not a

[2:01:53] even know some preachers in this message
[2:01:55] and whenever people will ask some
[2:01:57] questions it's like they cannot hardly
[2:01:59] stand to say they don't know the
[2:02:03] answer it's like they have to give an
[2:02:05] answer whether it's right or wrong I'm
[2:02:08] so glad I'm just so dumb and so stupid
[2:02:13] that I can say sometimes I just don't
[2:02:17] know and I feel so protected Lord oh I
[2:02:21] know people look at me as an ignoramus
[2:02:23] that's okay they look M at me as an
[2:02:26] idiot that's okay let him say whatever
[2:02:29] oh he won't even say it if you can't
[2:02:30] find a quote he runs everything through
[2:02:32] the Bible runs everything through the
[2:02:34] message yeah they think they're throwing
[2:02:36] off on me but they're bragging on me to
[2:02:38] no end they just don't realize it I just
