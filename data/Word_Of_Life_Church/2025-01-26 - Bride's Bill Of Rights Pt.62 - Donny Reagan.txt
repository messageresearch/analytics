a few requests that we' like to take to the Lord today brother Brad Gilbert texts me before I come out and he's having real severe pain in he's neck today wanted us to remember that also brother Daryl still is not feeling well he's been sick for several weeks now certainly want to remember our brother that God will just continue to strengthen him and be with him my daughter Alicia has been sick and Scotty's not feeling well today also a friend of brother Tyler wanted just prayer close here so we'll remember that brother Joe Green had a heart attack a mild heart attack um sometime late last night or early this morning they do have our brother stable he was in the hospital earlier today so we'd like to remember him I wonder how many has a need a request maybe not physical maybe it's spiritual just hold that in your heart now we'll just approach the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we've just been singing this song about it's already done and we believe that our faith is what helps us to achieve these things in our life when symptoms can rage like a wildfire we can hurt worse sometimes after we've been prayed for and after we're claiming our healing we can have more anxiety and more trouble whatever it is that we're asking for but we know father if our eyes are upon the promise those symptoms like Jonah were lying vanities amen so you heard all these requests father that I make known to the people today plus the ones that Brother Louie has already read and this prayer calls Lord that I'll preach with today you see this need Lord of brother Tyler's friend we pray that You' be merciful Lord Brother green brother Daryl father Brother Brad Gilbert Lord my daughter Lisha and Scotty and Lord there's so much going on so many viruses and sicknesses and your Prophet has told us that there would be things comeing the last day that would make cancer look like a toothache and so insignificant father we're grateful that your healing virtue is with us even in this Evil dark day of sickness and disease and Lord if we get healed and if we live long enough we'll get sick again but we're fixing to approach something in your word that if we can get the contents of what the scriptures and the message teaches us from what we're about to hear though our bodies may get sick our souls will be redeemed forever and that's what we desire Jesus we want to please you we want to serve serve you with all of our hearts forgive us of our shortcomings our failures help me today Lord I pray in the name of Jesus and the saint said amen isn't it good to be a child of God yes it is to be in the house of God well I'll tell you one thing you would not believe all the comments that I heard about the service Wednesday night and here I was about ready to just resign and think y'all wouldn't didn't want me to preach no more but the time I got back there to my desk my phone had already just about blowed up with all the different things and I've talked to several different people this week and to hear how perfect that the word was how timely as a matter of fact some people talking about things that was preached Wednesday night on the way to church and the Lord turned right around some people talking on two days before and I just love it when the Lord does that I believe in that kind of discernment when the word discerns the secrets of our hearts don't you the word is always perfect and timely isn't it let's turn again to Second Peter today if you would chapter 1 verse4 and we want to speak to you by the help of the Lord on our right to be in divine order to be what God has called us to be you know it's been my privilege in one way I say it that way to be able to deal with thousands of people around the world both saved and lost message Believers non- message Believers and as I deal with people that have found their purpose it's such a blessing and such a wonderful thing but my lot in life has also been to deal with a lot of people who have basically a wasted life they don't serve God they just live any way they want to live you know live according to the world the things of the world and never seem to find the Lord and don't really even care they live and they die they pass it onto their kids or kids live and die just a wasted life and it just to me it just so sad that a human being would come here to the Earth and never get credit and glory to the Lord who brought them they live their life do whatever they want to do and it's just absolutely wasted don't you want to give your life to Jesus I'm not talking about you getting saved now I'm just talking about after you're saved that you give your whole being to him to let him to be able to fulfill his word in your life second Peter chapter 1 ver4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature now this is a very tricky word partakers it can be so absolute in some ways in verses of scripture where it's used and at others it's not quite so much now listen here because in this particular place it is that you might be Akers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue how in the world can you and I add virtue how can we add knowledge how can we add Temperance how can we add godliness how can we add brotherly kindness how can I add anything of this divine nature now on my own on your own we can never do it but we must first realize there's a need in our life that's one thing the preaching of the Gospel does makes us aware of our shortcomings not to discourage you not to dishearten you and I but to help us to see there's a need there then we open up the channel by which God can connect with the need in our soul and minister to us what we have need of how many as needs are here this morning needs of these things as well beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity may the Lord bless his word you may be seated I mentioned it to you last Sunday whenever we went this direction that to be a partaker of God's Amazing Grace it's a wonderful thing how glad I am today to have partaken of the grace of God so many years ago to save me and then the grace of God that helps me along my everyday Journey as I'm heading back to where I come from to be a partaker of Mer of Mercy UNM merited favor something something that God gives all of us every day of our life healing I've been healed many times I've experienced Miracles as you have and to partake of that it's absolutely awesome but the privilege that is given ultimately to what Peter is writing this toward of those that are partakers of God's divine nature now partake of his nature isn't the same thing as being able to partake of the blessings of God of the mercy of God God can save people from a terrible state that they're in and then turn around and be lost God can save them for a life of Darkness save them from a life of hell and then them somehow lose sight of that and they go right back into that life again and wind up being lost forever so to partake in the sense of what Peter is saying about the divine nature is not just to be able to get a little bit of it if I have it open this bottle here and be able to drink a little bit of this and take it into my body and my body will start that miraculous process of absorbing what's inside of here now I've drunk many of these before so I do know a little bit about what's inside them vitamin B3 6 c n calcium this that and the other is inside of there and it helps me it actually refreshes me a little bit not only to be able to quench my thirst but there's something inside of there and my body will start breaking it down now my mind directs my hands and then my hands pick up the bottle and then I go to doing it this way then my mind will tell my hand to put it up to my mouth I will then swallow it down and then from there it's a subconscious work that takes place so my mind is no longer just telling each move but in my body my body will start processing what I've just drank same with food just like yours does and it's the same in the Supernatural sense once we do our part now I could sit there and my body make crave after that I could be so thirsty out say I'm am so thirsty I need something to drink but my mind must have a Channel of communication and it will what will it do it will go to my sight so my sight sees where it's at knows where it's at it's good and cold the way I like it and then there'll be a coordination of skills and and mental things that'll take place and then reactions to those invisible thoughts you don't see my mind as it's telling me what to do but my mind is telling me my hands don't even see my mind's thoughts but my hand will reach down and pick it up then it'll start the process take the lid off start drinking it then it'll come inside my body and then subliminally there will be something that'll take place inside the body once we're born again we come to the Lord we bow at an altar somewhere the spirit of God does what it does initially then we respond to that then the spirit of God starts this work inside of us spiritually just like our natural body does our food now before long you all will be getting hungry again so you pray I can talk fast and I don't preach all day and y'all will be able to go eat you some lunch okay but there'll be something about your body in a little bit that'll start sending signals from your stomach and your stomach may start growling and making noises and you're feeling hunger pains and there'll be something there now your stomach can do that for many many hours but it will depend upon the rest of your body to go wherever you've got planned to go eat after church and then there's things about it that the outside conscience must tie in together with the inward need that's inside of your body that's what the preaching of the Gospel does that we hear the word and we see Lord I need more Mercy I need more love I need more forgiveness I I need more understanding and brotherly kindness and godness for my for my brothers and the church said so there's something in us that responds to that but God works with that element now people can also though partake of of mercy and blessings they can actually partake of a little bit of the light of God they can actually partake of a portion of the Holy Ghost and wind up being lost a person could partake of a real Divine gift from God and be lost so we want to do more than just to take and partake of of this and in a little while I try to drink this it'll be gone it runs in my body my body will do as yours it'll process it throw out the bad stuff try to take the good stuff and before long I'll want another one and it's the same way with our food and it's the same way with many spiritual things but whenever it comes to being partakers of the divine nature if we ever arrive to that state and our soul is sealed in the presence of God you will never lose that the rest of your life when you receive the Holy Ghost and your soul is sealed that is your part of deity it is yours forever thank you Lord it will never be taken away now the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ah that's a different thing altoe you see a person could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of their life and die lost right and go to hell Elvis Presley had the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't look at me bug ey that's what the prophet said the prophet said he knew his Mo his mother Pastor all of them that's where he learned how to shake his leg all that dancing and all that rock and roll he learned it in church assembly of godur Church in Western Tennessee so Elvis had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he did not partake of God's divine nature now let's turn to Hebrews chapter 6 this morning where this same word partaker is used Again by Paul for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened now this word is amazing word I love this word the Greek word fito which is the word we get photograph from or photo because it means to give light or illuminate give light illuminate make to see render evident for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift notice not gifts gift singular so people can be enlightened God will illuminate salvation to them give them light help them see they're lost help them to see they need you know various things in their life God will open up their senses their spiritual perception and illuminate to them and make them to see that they need something else and it's rendered to them evident it is evident from the way they're living evident from the Hunger in their soul so now notice what Paul said it's impossible for those who were once in life and have tasted so when I drink this right here does one drop of it go into my spirit does one drop of this go into my soul but did I partake of it did I did I partake of it but yet it don't have the ability to go into my spirit which is contacted by love imagination conscience memory and reason nor does it have the ability to go down into my soul which is contacted only by one thing free moral agency so this can go into me and you say Oh Brother Don you didn't get in your spirit you didn't partake of it but I did it refreshed me I felt better it helped me it revitalized me and momentarily I was changed I think the Holy Ghost can move on a person's body they could shout they could jump it could move on their eyes and open their eyes and let them see a vision yes right they could see a vision which is Supernatural if it come from God of course it could move on their tongue and allow them to speak in a language they never learned before and turn right around and interpret that tongue and still not be in their soul at all right but they are partaking of it I don't want to partake of the divine nature that way now watch this is a very scary scripture for many people it shouldn't be because if you're bride this don't even apply to you this is totally impossible for the elect to ever fulfill this verse so drive that devil away from your fear for it is impossible for those who were once once I'm not once enlightened I'm forever enlightened come on somebody say Amen we are not once oh no we're not once enlightened We Are Forever enlightened by the grace of God but this is speaking of people that have once experienced these things with God and then they turn and walk away and step across that line and if they ever do they can never come back I ain't talking about people backsliding now and being able to come back to God there people sitting here today that backslid and came back to God Peter backslid but he can never fulfill this verse of scripture cuz his name was on that bride book the Lamb's Book of Life is that right for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted can you imagine the Holy Ghost being so close to some people that they actually taste of the Holy Ghost I said oh oh my goodness that is so awesome that is so wonderful oh I'm never be the same that is so powerful oh hallelujah hallelujah but you see it enters in and their flesh reacts their Spirit rejoices I may hot or shout amen whatever but it never moves down in the soul to seal the soul look at the word tasted to taste to try the flavor of now I am familiar with the flavor of this and I'm going to tell you all the name of it dragon fruit Berry cool name huh yep tastes just exactly the way it did the last time I drunk that flavor so some people do the holy ghost that way they open the bottle as it were press it to the oh Jesus jesuses and they prayed well they get emotional or whatever it is oh Hallelujah I feel so better praise the Lord God done something for me and they tasted of the Holy Ghost so what look at the meaning of the word that Paul uses to try the flavor of so they're not there to die to get the Holy Ghost in their soul they're simply there to try it and see see if they like it or not and some will taste some oh oh I could tell but a look wrinkle or nose on some of y'all's face you wouldn't even try that flavor right there would you dragon fruit Berry I don't want nothing doing no dragon oh my goodness Ain't No Way in the world I would want to drink something like that well some people think they might want to deal with the Holy Ghost until they taste it and when they do this no no so to take to try the flavor of enjoy to feel yeah sounds like the Holy Ghost to feel make trial of and that's the Modern Day Gospel try Jesus I'm not telling you to try Jesus Jesus ain't like a you know try this and then try alcohol and then try this and try that I'm not telling you to try Jesus I'm saying come to Jesus and give him your all CU a lot of people try him and they don't like him a lot of people try the Holy Ghost and you know what they don't like it they don't like the demands they don't like the responsibility or the flavor might suit them for a little bit but the bottom line is it's only a trial and they decide they don't want it now these are the words that Paul uses so he says let's read it again on context it is impossible for those who were once enlightened so they've been illuminated and have tasted of the Heavenly gift the Holy Ghost and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost wow so they tasted they tried they experienced and they actually partook of it made partakers of the Holy Ghost watch this in question answer 61 the prophets quoting this scripture for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted watch tasted the Heavenly gift that been right on the edge of it tasted the Heavenly gifts now you notice they had never come to the baptism of the Holy Spirit they was enlightened to it they tasted of the Heavenly gift but were made partakers of the Holy Ghost by tasting of it so you see the difference between partaking in this degree of the Holy Ghost and being a partaker of the divine nature the only way you can truly partake of the divine nature is be immers into it and it changes you forever yes sirc blessings miracles signs wonders shouting knowledge quoting the word quoting the message even listening to tapes going to church being religious what is that that's partaking partaking so a person comes and they come to church and they participate in the service and they partake of it and then when they get out in the car they go to sort and to what you think about that what you think about that well I didn't like this and I didn't like that I didn't like this and didn't like that so they go to sort through well I didn't I don't think we have to live that way I don't think the Bible requires that so what are they doing they're sorting through and they're trying The Taste to see if they like it or not but you see if you ever become a partaker of the divine nature you will find the war that you were born with in you the moment you were born and that is you were at war with God if you ever become a partaker of the divine nature that war is over forever that's right now your old flesh May Ward against it and all that but that nature in you will never rebel against God again it can't you've been converted than oh my now notice he said they were partakers of the Holy Ghost by tasting of it having tasted of the good word of God and powers of the world to come now watch how Paul goes on to say it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost partaker sharing in partaking a partner in a work office or dignity let me tell you about a preacher very gift Ed very anointed very charismatic had healings signs wonders Miracles this preacher I'm referring to was actually baptized by Jesus Christ himself his name was Judas that's right brother amen he was illuminated to the message of the hour that Jesus was the son of God he was anointed a partaker of Jesus own Ministry he shared in the ministry with Peter James John Bartholomew all the rest of the Brethren notice this in the sardes and church age and the church age book now if language means anything at all we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus John 13:18 yet he was not clean John 13:10 to11 Judas was also given to Jesus by the Father John 17:12 now he goes on in this if you'd like to read the whole thing but to skip a or spare a little time I skipped on down to part of this quote down for a L's in it Judas was not numbered with the 12 and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost now keep in mind this man was not inferior and when Jesus you've heard me say this for years but when Jesus en enlightened them to the mystery that someone was going to betray him somebody's sitting there at the table and they begin to look around and they question thems before they even questioned Judas so he was so close in lifestyle in mannerism in vacular he talked the message talk it seemed as if though he walked the message walk he hung around the right people oh somebody preach with me today so it wasn't like that they would catch Judas all the time and he would be flirting with the young sisters or you know eyeing the women he couldn't keep his hands off of the women or you know he wasn't sneaking around and doing this and that and the other and they'd catch him drunk every now and then Judas lived such a Godly life as we would say that they never even doubted that it was him as a matter of fact in the way that they would have set at the table they did not eat the way we do they did not set in a chair in the position like you're sitting in now and they would pull their feet up under a table but they would actually recline so at the Last Supper the Lord Jesus would have been sitting on the middle and John would have been on one side sort of reclined and Judas would have been on the other side reclined oh my and the disciples actually with have thought in their mind Judas is going to take Jesus place they never even question his Integrity his character his preaching his signs his wonders and he was a devil the whole time so a person can partake of the min Ministry partake of knowledge partake of the Holy Ghost in the form of anointing Supernatural gifts and so on oh my notice this Judas was numbered with the 12 and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost acts 1:16-17 men and brethen this scripture must need to be fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was guide to them that took Jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry the part that Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then lost was neither inferior to the ministries of the other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign Ministry interjected amongst the ministry of the others that's think of it he was actually partaking a part of the real Ministry of the Lord Jesus he dear God help us acts 1:25 now the Brethren are getting together and trying to find somebody to replace Judas and may he take part of this ministry and apostleship from when Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place Judas a devil lost a god-given holy ghost Ministry oh Lord and killed himself and went to his own place now let me tell you every person sitting here today and every person on the sound of my voice around the world this is the choices that's before each of us today we will live our life we will choose our own paths we will partake of the Enlightenment of the message of the hour the word of God or you'll go the way of the world and just I don't want nothing to do with it at all or you will give yourself over to the Lord Jesus and you will not go in the direction that Judas went but you will go to your own place every lost person will go to their own place every church member go to their own place and the bride will go to her own place too but it wasn't because she deserved it it was because God gave it to her by his grace now notice the way that that the scripture says this in Acts and then the prophet when he mentions this in the church AG book that he died and went to his own place so the question is this morning then where is your place cuz it's inevitable every one of us are going to our own place but I don't mind telling you this morning I have no fear of going to hell cuz it ain't my place I have no fear this morning of being lost because that's not who I am I once was lost like you were I once was buying but now I see but I am not enlightened for a season only I am enlightened for eternity I don't want to just be a partaker of the Holy Ghost can't you see how frightening this is for a preacher for a man that stands up behind the pulpit knowing that he could be a partaker of the whole Holy Ghost Ministry and without that man himself being born again how many of us have we seen down through the years of men that had a real god-given Ministry and they wind up being a womanizer or wind up being after money or popularity or whatever it is and Fall Away have we seen it sure we have will we see more no doubt we will but I'll tell you one thing if Satan can do that and he makes a mimic and a copy then that lets me know there are some genuine God call men they will not sell out they are not for sale they are not for sale for a woman or for money or for popularity or anything else if God cannot produce god-given Holy Ghost filled Ministry then the rest of you folks might as well give up and quit because before the Lord Jesus ever called and established a church he called and established preacher ERS and told them preachers go preach my word and if there's going to be a bride in the last days and there is and if she's going in the Rapture then God must have a god-given holy ghost filled Ministry that will not compromise they will preach Jesus Christ and him raised from the dead they will cast out Devils they will lay hand on the sick and they shall recover because they are partaking of the ministry of the Lord Jesus oh my goodness notice Paul goes on to say about these people that that they have tasted the good word of God very same word that he used before to eat to taste to try the flavor of to feel to make trial of or experience so they've tasted the good word of God and they even acknowledged this is so good this is so good I love this this is so good I don't want to just say it's good and stop I want to say it's so good I can't live without it and I got to have more and more and more I me know I'm talking about it's a very strange saying this eternal life that we receive we get it but it ain't like you get it once and you partake of it once and that does you the rest of your life the more you get the more you want and the more you want the more you need the more you need the more you want and the more you reach out and the more you get God said that's exactly what I wanted it to be for you I want this to be something that'll satisfy you like nothing else but don't think you'll get it 45 years ago and that's the end of it I'll tell you one thing I need more now than I've Ever Needed in my life don't you H's been serving the lord for years and years and you say I need more and I want more than I've ever had but you see this category of people taste the good word of God and they say oh this is so good but they run across things that they don't like so they throw it out and they throw that out and that out and that out sir now traveling around the world I've had to eat a lot of things the lord gave me a missionary heart but he didn't give me a missionary stomach to match it so I don't mind telling you those things that I've eat woo boy if the Lord didn't help you I don't I don't how in the world brother Benton blessed his heart he's had to eat a whole lot more rough things than I have I know he has but yet some of the things that you had to eat on one of my trips to China One of the Brethren there asked me brother Donnie have you ever eat a dog I said are you kidding me it's pretty sure don't eat dogs and cats brother oh I'd love to fix you one I said well maybe the next time that could be the reason I ain't never been back I don't know I'm just saying yeah so when I'm went to markets guess what I never saw one dog on the street but I did see him hanging up in the meat markets so would I want a taste of ruff ruff no no uhuh I know it may be in my mind it may be in my mind like with you now you see when people get that attitude toward God's word well where does that come from well we believe God sent a i can't handle that Prophet so oh my goodness where'd that come from right out of your Bible that you pack under your arm so these people can taste of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come look how close they get they sit at the same table and they even taste of the powers of the world that is to come brother sister you're talking about close notice again in verse six if they shall fall away but you see Peter when he writes about these virtues he said if a man will have these things in him he will never fall I'm telling you this is important this is not something that we think well it's it's an option right like power windows if I don't want power windows I don't have to have them no this is a requirement a bride requirement if they shall fall away to renew them again un repentance seeing they no longer caiaphus no longer Pontius pilot no longer the Roman Centurion but they me you anyone else who does this to the Lord Jesus and it is no longer the centeron at the foot of the cross no longer cfus at the foot of the cross it's you it's me your mother your daddy and it's you crucifying Jesus oh again if they shall fall away to renew them again into repentance seeing they crucify to themselves so you put Jesus on your own cross so you want to know who the maker of the Cross is look in the mirror after church it was you and I who caus him to go there I may have caused it initially but by his grace I'll never cause him again amen you understand what I'm saying now notice these people that come here they are twice guilty because they caused him to do it in the first place and he went there in their stad even if they're not bride they can be saved but they turn him down again and they crucify him again the second time they crucified to themselves the Son of God a fresh fesh and put him to an open shame now let's change so I trust and hope and pray that there's no one here today that will ever be the fullfillment of Hebrews 6 but what we wish to partake of today is of second Peter and that which is the divine nature of God and how that God embodied himself in this human temple in order that through the breaking of the blood cell it would release the life of God now God forbid them in the Old Testament to be able to eat meat with the blood in there or drink the blood and God wanted the blood to be drained out of it because the life was in the blood now they would break the animal they would take and break the blood cell of the animal and it would release the chemistry out of the body and the blood was used as a paint or a symbolism the innocent life of the sheep could not of course go to God but it was a substitutionary life that God accepted for The Sinner so the sinner would come up before the altar he would lay his hands on the head of his lamb and while he was there the priest would take the knife and slice the Sheep's throat and the the lamb would die oh my in the stead of the worshipper and the worshipper would walk away feeling the guilt and the pain because his sin caused that sheep to die it was only a symbolism a prophecy pointing to a day whenever God would do something a little bit different now the innocent sheep could not give its life to come back on the worshipper so me and brother Paul Brother D you brothers and sisters have believe lived in the Old Testament with walk up before the the house of the Lord and we would bring our sacrifice and there we would lay it and we would feel so ashamed because that little lamb had to die for us and then we'd walk out of there out of back out of the court of the Gentiles and would' walk out we might see a woman and we would lust after her we might stop down and get us a drink we might cheat our brother we might have a temper fit or this or that or the other and before long that guilt would leave us and we was identified feeling guilty and feeling so bad because our sin caused that little lamb to die but that would only last for a little while because then we'd walk back out and that snake which was in our hearts would R up again and go to hissing for sin and he'd want to do this and that and the other and then our subconscious would free us from the feeling of guilt and would start doing the same thing if not worse than we did before well then next year we'd come back we'd go up to Jerusalem on y Kapur the day of atonement and we do the same thing over and over again before long it becomes a ritual to all of us it becomes a routine well you going up I reckon yeah I guess I am I need to get rid of these Sins Of Mine God knows I need it I sure need it I'll tell you one thing and we go up there and we lay our hands on that would you hurry up I've got an appointment out here I've got to do a business transaction and we lay our hands on the head of the lamb and we walk out well praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord that's took care for another year now I don't have to go back church for another year praise God for that I don't like going anyhow and before long it come to a place there was no emotion there was no feeling but you see what God wanted to do was to be able to bring divine nature in down inside and make it to where man would be able to protect of so you remember the the Redemption money of the Old Testament anybody remember that well was actually silver now remember the elements the metallurgical elements that God uses in Redemption gold is deity silver of course is redemption purple blue Heavenly so all of those things that God used in the Tabernacle so silver speaks of redemption and God told them if they needed to redeem their first born you know they need to redeem it then they could buy it back from the Lord and they had to have a a shekele of the Tabernacle so the Roman dinar wouldn't work the the Mediterranean money that they would have used would not work it was a special currency Meed to be able to Reed in the house of God and God was giving a type again of the ransom money or the shekele the silver shekele that they would be able to buy it back so God had to come down and make himself in the form of a currency that would be accepted for your sin the Sheep could not give you its life so God wanted to come down himself in a human body and then create blood inside of that human body a woman would carry it around to full term and give birth to that body but not one Speck of her blood or her DNA would be in that body and the church said you know who that body was right the Lord Jesus so God had this Holy Blood created in him but also in him was this divine nature that we just read about and God made him being the acceptable form of currency that could be accepted on your behalf so your righteousness God won't accept it your goodness God won't accept it all the things that you could do God will not accept now in my office desk back at home I've got money from France I've got money from Switzerland I've got money from Zimbabwe I've got money from different places around the world that I've just kept kind of is a souvenir now what do you think if we need to go to the grocery store and I go to Food City or Walmart or somewhere and I try to pay for the groceries that Carolyn I get with Zim dollars which is what they call them in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe dollars or I use Shillings from Israel sister hope Kenya is still in Shillings as well uh so if I would have I still have some of the Kenya money as well so if I would go there and I leted out on on the the counter there and they look at me and say is this Monopoly money well no it's real money but I'm in the wrong jurisdiction to use it so what do I do I have to have money that will be able to pay the price for what I want I hope you're hearing me this morning if we want eternal life if we want to be saved we don't want to just be partakers of the Holy Ghost but we want the Holy Ghost to have us and have us all then we've got to have a coin we've got to have a money that will be accepted at the great Tri tribunal of God so there before the white Throne we approach him and we come God we want to be saved God we want to be redeemed God how we do well do you have the right money do you have the right price well Lord I I help I help the people I feed the poor I I pay TI that won't work here well I I go to church I I go to word of live church and I go there every now and then and u i I don't understand what they're saying but I I do I do like to the people that the nice people that won't work well I I do I say nice things about people that won't work in order to be redeemed you've got to have the only money I will accept which is myself in human form and then when the blood cell broke open at Calvary what did it release not just tongues not just interpretation that was all part of it but it released the divine nature then by coming God's provided way we accept the divine nature to replace our sinful nature but this is the mysterious part so the sinful nature in the soul is eradicated and gone but you still have a human nature and you're living in a flawed messed up human body is there anybody H us here today that can say we're all messed up I don't care how good you think you are how wonderful you think you are you are messed up you got a belly button you're messed up you got a belly button you're a renegade you've got a human mother and father unless there's somebody here today virgin born that I don't know anything about all the rest of you are just like the rest of us your whole flesh is Low Down Rotten no good it'll bother you every day you live it is your greatest enemy drinking a't your enemy adultery ain't your enemy lying ain't your enemy your greatest enemy is your old stinking body amen woo praise the Lord now watch the prophet as he goes into this about divine nature see we got to be so in love with him till when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit God spoke something to me this week I'm just not sure yet as far as the time but when he wants me to bring it but it was along this line I found amazing because I've been listening to this tape I don't know 10 12 times this week and then I found this I heard this quote notice how he says that that we want to be so in love with him that if we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that it doesn't shake us a bit see why the only way you can do that is has become partakers of his divine nature now have we all asked God for things and God didn't give it God didn't give it in the way we wanted it or maybe God delayed the answer have we and then sometimes God just flat out say no what is it about us it's something about us human beings we don't like hearing that word we do not like no we didn't like it when we were kids and here we are most of us Ancient of Days a lot of us anyway and we don't like it any better so whether it come from our mama our daddy our pastor the deacons trustees or God we just don't like the word no in this application I'm talking about we like yes yes that's what we want to hear oh you know it's so easy for us if we're not careful and we have scriptures that seemingly allude to the point that whatever you ask God he'll do it didn't Jesus say whatever you ask in my name I'll do it if any two of you agree on Earth that's touching one thing whatever they ask will be done so it would seem as if though whatever that we ask without contingency that it is ours oh but there's other scriptures that we must also bring in in the same context you understand and that's where people get so hurt at God and offended at God but see if we are partakers of divine nature then it gives us an allocation that to be honest with you other people just don't have so if God tells us no and his no breaks our heart uproots our life changes us forever and not in a positive way how many of us can still love him with all of our hearts you don't have to raise your hand or not I mean just in your heart ask yourself that question if God says no so he says now watch that doesn't shake us a bit and the only way you could do that is to be partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you partakers of his divine nature now these people that Peter is saying here how that we must be partakers of his divine nature now each one of us now notice this is 1962 so the prophet has been preaching for years had the Holy Ghost for years October the 14th in the morning service and notice how he includes himself and what he's fixing to talk about now each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God and if you're looking for something to listen to I highly recommend this one also Blasphemous names which is just a month or so after this because he refers to the same thing Harvest Time be a good one as well so I want you to notice that his brother Brown talks about that that he said each one of us so here brother Brandon is including himself in the growing of the virtues well you say well I've already got it praise the Lord I'm so glad you do pray for the rest of us yeah cuz I need more of all these myself now he's talking about the key of Faith which he preached it just a couple of nights before and he said So today we're going to try to take that same key to unlock the way to become now notice what we want to become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God not a Christian what he's not making an alder call for us to get saved but to become a virtuous Christian virtuous Christian you know when brother random started praying for the sick and it would make him really weak and early on in his ministry he said he just didn't understand why it would make him weak and a brother told him he said brother brandom he said that's virtue going out of you and he said well I I knew that was said about about Jesus but he said I didn't I didn't want to apply that to myself and the brother told me he said well when you're praying for the people strength is going out of your body to them now I'm sure that you've seen preachers before in the prayer line uh whenever you've been to different meetings and they could pray for a thousand and they're just as strong whenever they get done as they were when they started and there's others they may pray for 10 they may pray for 50 they may pray for a 100 and brother brand referring to this he said it really helped him to understand understand what was going on because it would pull this strength so much out of him and he really didn't even understand it now you see maybe you'll never be called to stand and pray in a prayer line and strengths go out of you but being a virtuous Christian is not just limited to a preacher but God wants every one of his sons and daughters to be virtuous Christian so what will it be then when these Seven Virtues Of The Divine nature so flow out of our life that it's not us trying to make ourself I need to be more Godly I need to have more faith I I need to have more virtue I need to do this I need to make myself it's us asking God to let it flow out of us by Nature now this has affected me this way praying for people for years and years and it actually helped me whenever I found that not long ago where brother Brown talked about it and I prayed for people in hundreds and thousands of of people down through the years in prayer lines and there's times that you can go and go and go and you're praying and you you know God's flowing out of there and the spirit of God is moving and one person will come through and it's hard to explain it but it's like that one person reaches inside of you and they take out nearly every bit of your strength and you feel like you're going to fall dead as a hammer right there on the platform and there'll be times that you'll feel little by little by little but according to the need of the individual is what seems to be able to really pull on you and you realize that as Sons and Daughters of God those of you that love one another that God may use you to talk to somebody in the church or a brother or sister or somebody in your family to try to encourage them because they're having a a low time or going through a difficult time and whenever you get done you think oh I'm exhausted y'all ever been there you ever been there talk to somebody you know didn't even have a pray line you just tried to talk to them oh my goodness I'm telling you the last few days I have had I don't know how many phone calls I'm talking about Canada different parts of the states hour and a half at a time two hours at a time and time I got off the phone yesterday my throat was so sore I could hardly talk and I felt like I was so depleted of my strength and my energy simply by hours of phone call but what is it virtue going out of you so does God just want that to be the pastor only no God wants us as a group of Believers to be so virtuous it might be a sinner out on the street it might be somebody lost that you work with and yet they've got a need and they bring it up and you go to talking to them and you feeling virtue going out oh I wish somebody would hear me today we don't want to be just the type of people that all of this is word and it's all quotes and it's all just up here in our head what good does it do us if it's only in our head we want to be virtuous Christians oh my notice he said oh help us Jesus a virtuous Christian in the stature of God uh notice what it's going to be to be a living Tabernacle for the Living God to dwell in now our blood our which come through by sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us and changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God then we become a dwelling place for God so it's not just a baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not the anointing moving on us and making us do Supernatural things and that anointing leaving us it's a permanent re residence oh praise the Lord now the anointing does do that we know that the anointing comes upon us I don't just want to have the anointing I took care I was talking to someone on the phone yesterday and just talking talking been there for a long time and while I was speaking the spirit of God I was down in the basement been listening to a tape and the spirit of God come right down where I was at I hope you believe me and the spirit of God just like spoke right out of my mouth I said oh Lord have mercy and I was telling her the things that the Lord had said it was absolutely awesome I hope I get to preach it to you sometime but the spirit of God wants not only to use the pasture the spirit of God wants to use the sisters the spirit of God wants to use the young men and the young Brothers come on somebody to where you can be a tool by which God can encourage and God can uplift and God can use you to be able to minor I ain't talking about you taking a text now you sister putting your hand on your hip well glory to God Hallelujah you do that I'm going to set you down just a little heads up but God wants each of us to be so filled with his spirit and these virtues that people can know we are Sons and Daughters of God not just because our sisters wear skirts and they don't cut their hair and this and that we want to be known by our virtues as well as we are our outward dress oh my amen and we're supposed to do his work he that believeth on me he that believeth on me quotes St John 14:7 The Works that I do shall it do also you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ but listen this carefully but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us there's the trouble we find these things happening you know what I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heaps of Ministers of Christians piled along the road it's because they didn't go into it right that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church and myself don't you appreciate that I love a man of God that can stand there and say you bunch of people boy you need to move up I'll tell you one thing if it wasn't for you all I could be sorn in Heavenly f are you all ever going to catch up in me oh come on get next to yourself you're like all the rest of us sorry outfits you need help come on oh my my my I'm here to teach this little this little church and myself how we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many like to be that that Dwelling Place of the Living God do we want to just have this word in our head and we produce all types of arguments and debates and clicks and Clans and divisions and schisms Among Us or do we want to be Bible believing virtuous Holy Ghost fill Christians that people can disagree with you and actually hate you but from your heart you feel pity for them and you pray for them amen now we're talking about bride material Let Me Go a bit father can I have a few more minutes notice in ephes 4:8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high LED captivity captive and gave gifts unto men wherefor when he ascended up on high what did he do he led captivity captive emptied out paradise up captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the speaking of Jesus he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens that he might fulfill all things and he gave some now in verse eight he tells us that he gave gifts unto men now he's going to tell us what those gifts are and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelist and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry not plural but singular every godall man that's ever lived on the face of the Earth have partook of only one Ministry since acts the book of Acts came that's the ministry of Jesus Christ himself notice now for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a tius perfect man not human flawlessness now but perfect Age full age brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness that which is perfect consummate human Integrity ah and virtue of men full grown adult a full age mature ever God call man that's what he's called to produce unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so the word stature then refers to the growth of a man that which will be ultimately attained as it matches the measurement not of this preacher that preacher that preacher back there but the stature of Christ himself yeah notice this then you and I are not the standard our church is not the standard for the message amen praise the Lord this church and that church and the other church is not the standard for the message there's no certain preacher that is the standard that everybody is to be measured by him God has one measure and that measure is Christ Jesus now one of the reasons that people like to compare themselves to humans is they will always pick humans less than themselves or majority of them do less than than themselves so they can be greater than them but whenever we all compare ourselves to Lord Jesus there ain't none of us can brag about anything are they now look at the word that Paul used here it's a very strange word that he says the stature of the fullness of Christ and he said which is to fill up that which has been filled a ship in so much as it filled with Sailors rowers and soldiers in the New Testament the body of Believers is that which is filled with The Presence Power agency Riches of God and of Christ so Paul is speaking to the Ephesian church and even though they're one of the deepest churches in the New Testament he says look children you all are still like children and you need to come on up yes well let me speak to you this morning as your pastor who loves you with all of my heart and many ways I believe we are men but I believe in many ways we're still children yes we need to grow and notice I ain't saying you I said we we need to grow anybody in here be honest and raise your hand yes Lord I do so the perfect man reg refers to the man or woman that is grown up in Christ Jesus so Christ has appointed pastors and teachers that the infant Church might be conducted or ushered in to a stage of maturity so you can see why preachers want Satan becomes they become a tool if they're not careful that Satan wants to get on them and cause them to argue and fuss and debate and this one preaches his service against that preacher over there then that preacher hears it by Wednesday and then that preacher takes his text against that preacher over there and then they just go back and forth back and forth back and forth I've got better things to preach on today than message preachers oh yeah I refer to them but I'll tell you one thing I don't figure y'all come here today to hear me talk about me I don't think y'all come here today to hear me run down this man or that man I think you all come here to hear tell me what I can do to be a better man brother Donnie tell me what I can do to be a better young person a a a a better daughter of God tell me man of God bring something that will edify me that way henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine there's no way you're going to convince me that all the Mage folks still ain't children we've had too many brides revivals Among Us and some of the same people that was a part of this revival wind up being a part of the same one years later and they go from one move to another to another to another you know why their search for the Messiah has not stopped they're still searching for a messiah well let me tell you today maybe you are I am not I have found him or better stated he has found me that's right I'm not looking for a superhero preacher now it's something in our makeup why do you think Superman went over so good why do you think Batman went over so good Catwoman went over so good why is it that our kids start out Disney movies and this and that and the other and they're looking for superheroes Hercules and whatever men that are nothing of fiction there's something about a human being that looks for a superhero well let me tell you about one the only one ever existed his name is not Hercules his name is not Samson his name is not David his name is not Donnie his name is not Tim or Ron or D or any other human being his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's the only superhero that you can put your trust in and he will never let you down all other men will fail you all other men will disappoint you he is the TR the only the one superhero that will change our lives forever let's stand at our feet let's give him a hand oh come on let's give him a hand oh my let me jump down here to Ephesians 4:15 but speaking the truth in love so apparently people can speak truth and it not be in love or Paul would have never said it this way but speaking the truths in love may grow up into him now remember when brother Brandon preaches the statue of a perfect man he brought a drawing to church that day and put it up on a bulletin board and it was the seven Church ages and the Seven Messengers and then the Seven Virtues that he was preaching so he refers to it several times in his in his sermon there and he says that God did not require and he would point to one of those ages and he would say God did not require of this this age what he did of this one which was one above it and God not did not require of this and what he did with this one but it just so happens you and I are living at the very top and guess what God requires every word every word and there ain't a one of us here today that can do that with without divine nature being deposited in our soul and even when that's there that battle will still rage because remember there's 2third of you that's against you your spirit and your body so you're a Triune being the onethird the soul the gene is the part that's been born again the other two parts of you is not yet converted now remember he said that when you die your spirit breaks up you don't have a spirit in the theophany you don't have a spirit in eternity you were supposed to been C gen soul theophany and glorified body but human Spirit was substituted to you God knowing the fall would come but your spirit one day breaks up when you die and if you're alive and remaining then you take the soul to meet the theophany then you get the glorified body so in eternity it will be you the attribute you the theophany you the glorified body but right now this is you and these other two ain't you but they look like you yeah and they want to convince you that they are you and this is what you all have arguments with in amongst the church people their two against your two oh wow you husbands and wives when you get into them friendly disagreements it's her two against your two now I know y'all going to stand your NE like you're a bunch of angels all right but if you do that I'm going to tell you that might be the kind that wears rides motorcycles and wears leather jackets what we're longing for friends is our Trinity to fully be changed amen Carol and I was coming to church this morning right up the road here we're about 12 minutes away something like that and I told her I said look at her and I was talking about the Earth I said she's pitiful Barren gray cold there's some Woods there behind my house there and I was looking for a tree the other day I doing a little bit of taxidermic work so I went down to my Woods there looking for a tree that I can make a tree out of so I got down over the hills about 10 degrees something like that and went down over the hill and look around and I got down in there I knew there's several there and that was was a big massive tree that had fallen years ago L there rotten decayed couldn't use that then there was a younger tree that was laying there that I'm not sure what happened to it but about that Big R then there's another one laying over here and it was about the size of my finger tens of thousands of leaves laying all over the whole whole forest floor so debris and Rock Ness just everywhere I told her said look at this coming to church I said told her about the story going into the woods I I looked at I thought you that's the way there some people 80 90 something like that they get able to live their life some people goes it's babies some people go in their 30s some in their 20s yet they're laying across the face of the Earth dead but they were not meant to be that way neither was I meant to constantly have to content was myself yeah you were not meant to have this war within you day in and day out how many knows what I'm talking about we were meant to enjoy life and see good days and every day be good not a good day and then three bad and then one good and then four bad and you know a good half a day and then the rest of the day bad we never meant to have that I believe it's coming don't you I don't know how much longer I've got in this life but I want to give everything that I have for God and for his people I was talking to a friend of mine this week from Canada he's a pastor of a church there associate pastor and he he was talking about the pastor brother there and um he's a friend of mine I preached for him a few times he's want me to come back up there now this pastor this brother he's been preaching for many many years and he's 95 years old preaches two times a week and preaches like a fire brand and I said man that is absolutely awesome so he's just telling me this it's this younger brother's daddy in-law and he was just telling me I thought man that is so wonderful but then brother Daddy I had some negative thoughts and I thought 95 so does that mean I've got to preach so I'm 95 I hope we ain't here that long what are we waiting for what are we looking for so president Trump become the president is that going to change everything oh the United States is in a golden age when they cry peace and safety then sudden destruction comes upon them as travail upon the woman he's not my hope I'm looking for a trump all right but it's the last Trump when the Trump shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen don't you want to be ready friends can we bow our heads together brother Aaron can we sing this is your house now remember we built this place and dedicated it to God it was much easier for us to do we dedicate it to God if any of us are alive it'll never be used for nothing else but what about our house our building we give it to God and then we take it back we give it to God and we take it back how many wants to be able to surrender all that you are you want them not just be a Christian not just a message follower but a virtuous Christian you see friends I ain't talking about your virt my virtue we'll go on brother B talks about it but he says it's the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the godliness this is what it is it's him it's him and US Lord Jesus if we have our heads bowed to the dust of the earth and whence our bodies are taken and one day they'll return back to that Lord as we've sat in your presence today there have been somber moments there have been lighter moments now we come to the time of deep consideration and thought Lord as we read about Judas he went to his place Pharaoh went to his the Bible says that Abraham died and was gathered with his people Isaac died and was gathered with his people Jacob died and was gathered with his so does every man and woman boy and girl when they die as we say deaths they are gathered with their people kind after kind so Lord we pray that You' help us to choose our people correct ly Lord as I said we built this place here for the glory and the honor of God Wednesday night was preaching about seed for the rain and I told someone after service I said you realize our our place here our church here that the Lord's given us it's simply seed that we seed for years and years that God helped us by his grace build churches all over the world and God turned around and brought those seeds back up and gave us a place and we're grateful for it so we're living here today and worshiping here in a manifested seed of God so Lord we want to
