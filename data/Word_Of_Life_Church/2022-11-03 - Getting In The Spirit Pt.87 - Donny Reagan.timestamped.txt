[48:21] [Music]
[48:23] that's when love broke every chance
[48:31] [Music]
[48:35] and my life began changing tonight
[48:43] Grace became amazing
[48:48] thank you
[48:51] [Music]
[48:56] thank you
[48:58] [Applause]
[49:03] aren't you glad you can say that you
[49:05] know it's amazing
[49:08] there's a lot of folks that sing Amazing
[49:10] Grace but you can tell by their life it
[49:12] hadn't amazed them too much
[49:14] because they're still hanging on to the
[49:16] world things of the world
[49:19] if it amazes us enough
[49:21] it'll change us amen
[49:25] didn't have brother Andrew preach up a
[49:27] storm here
[49:28] oh my goodness
[49:35] we're so blessed amen so blessed
[49:38] and I heard some really good
[49:40] comments about the camp over in South
[49:43] Carolina's or done some really good
[49:45] things
[49:46] the devil must have got really mad
[49:48] because much of them got sick so
[49:51] best signs when the devil goes to fight
[49:53] and what God's doing in it
[49:55] I got some really
[49:57] nice text from some of the preachers
[50:00] over there actually the administrators
[50:03] that was running hitting all
[50:05] uh been so complementary
[50:08] of our youth group just really really
[50:12] nice things and I just wanted to give
[50:14] them flower tonight
[50:25] I said they didn't have one issue not
[50:28] one problem
[50:29] except
[50:31] for the John hornyak
[50:35] so they'll have to deal with him
[50:40] of course they were only teasing
[50:43] amen
[50:45] if our Christianity does not go with us
[50:47] everywhere we go what good is it
[50:51] doesn't have a representation of Christ
[50:53] no matter where we are
[50:56] I preached many of those camps through
[50:58] the years and
[51:00] I can tell you from dealing with the
[51:02] preachers that run it Sometimes some of
[51:04] the young people who come there are
[51:06] nothing but headaches
[51:08] nothing but troubles one issue after
[51:11] another
[51:12] so it makes me proud of those that go
[51:15] and they're going to get something from
[51:17] the Lord to be a blessing and to be a
[51:19] help amen
[51:21] God bless you let's turn to that if we
[51:23] went to Revelation chapter
[51:25] 18 verse 1.
[51:37] Revelation chapter 18 verse 1.
[51:41] now remember in reading this tonight
[51:43] that
[51:45] some people try to follow the Book of
[51:47] Revelation
[51:48] and numeric order
[51:50] I know a great preacher in the message
[51:52] that for years and years
[51:55] preached and said that Revelation 10
[51:59] actually didn't apply to brother Branham
[52:02] or the seven seal didn't apply to us
[52:06] because he was trying to preach chapter
[52:08] 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 chapter 4 then
[52:11] after chapter four The bribe is gone so
[52:13] chapter five six seven eight nine on
[52:15] down through the rest of the chapters
[52:17] didn't even pertain to the bride at all
[52:20] but of course it was a lack of
[52:22] Revelation from the brother but we know
[52:24] that the Book of Revelation is not
[52:26] written like that
[52:28] it's written to where it takes a prophet
[52:31] to be able to take it and unfold it to
[52:35] us
[52:36] and what we're going to read tonight
[52:38] these first few verses even though it
[52:40] seems like it's plum over in in the
[52:43] tribulation period yet we know that part
[52:47] of this actually applies to us
[52:50] now the thing is that God called us out
[52:52] of was the system of the churches of the
[52:55] world and while it is yet in her
[52:59] there is Mercy for people to come out
[53:02] and the prophet said come out of her
[53:05] before it goes into him
[53:08] once it goes into him
[53:10] that's it
[53:12] so I'm glad you heard the voice
[53:14] amen
[53:16] after these things
[53:19] I saw another Angel come down from
[53:21] heaven now remember which is chapter 16
[53:23] 17
[53:25] and I saw another Angel come down from
[53:27] heaven having great power and the Earth
[53:30] was lightened with his glory
[53:34] and he cried mightily with a strong
[53:37] voice
[53:39] saying Babylon the Great
[53:43] The Babylon has mentioned previously in
[53:45] the Book of Revelation but not by these
[53:48] terms but this is Babylon the great you
[53:52] remember reading of course if you know
[53:54] history very well that there was a Herod
[53:56] and there was a Herod the Great not the
[54:00] same man at all
[54:02] so Babylon is Mystical but it's also
[54:05] spiritual and it's a natural place too
[54:08] but this is Babylon the great is Fallen
[54:12] is fallen and has become
[54:15] the habitation of devils
[54:18] wow what a terrible thing to have said
[54:21] about you
[54:22] and the hold of every foul spirit
[54:27] and the word hole there means prison or
[54:31] watch
[54:33] guard
[54:35] persons keeping the watch
[54:38] the place where captives
[54:40] were kept
[54:42] so whatever this Babylon the grade is
[54:45] it's become the habitation of devils
[54:48] and it's a cage that holds other things
[54:52] what are those things what are they well
[54:55] the prophet will tell us I'll read to
[54:57] you in a bit
[54:58] churches
[55:00] churches
[55:01] so the systems are held in this cage
[55:04] here
[55:06] a cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[55:10] for all nations have drunk
[55:14] of the wraths the wine of the wrath of
[55:16] her fornication
[55:18] and the kings of the Earth have
[55:20] committed fornication with her and the
[55:24] merchants of the Earth are waxed rich
[55:30] through her the abundance of her
[55:32] Delicacies
[55:34] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[55:37] saying
[55:38] oh my goodness you mean some of God's
[55:41] people
[55:42] were in that mess
[55:46] I heard another voice from Heaven saying
[55:49] come out of her
[55:52] my people
[55:54] that you be not partakers of her sins
[55:57] and that re you receive not of her
[56:01] plagues
[56:02] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[56:06] and God has remembered
[56:10] her iniquities which means they were not
[56:13] repented of
[56:15] because if you ever repent of him he'll
[56:18] never remember them again
[56:21] so whatever this was and whoever they
[56:23] were they were doing all of this stuff
[56:26] and not repenting or if they were
[56:29] repenting they were repenting contrary
[56:31] to the way of truce and God could not
[56:34] pardon them
[56:36] I don't want him to remember mine
[56:39] aren't you glad that he's forgotten
[56:40] yours
[56:42] let's pray together
[56:45] Heavenly Father we counted such a
[56:47] privilege to be gathered together
[56:49] tonight we love you so much
[56:52] Lord just just to be able to gather with
[56:56] one another is wonderful
[56:58] but together with one another in your
[57:00] courts
[57:01] we're so blessed
[57:03] Lord Jesus makes us so mindful to know
[57:07] that you're not limited to be able
[57:09] together with your people and just even
[57:12] a church building
[57:14] I've shared it with them before several
[57:16] years ago that as I stood in Kenya and I
[57:20] had a school rented but there was a
[57:22] mix-up and another group had it rented
[57:25] the same day
[57:26] so they would not let us have that room
[57:29] to be able to have church
[57:31] so the Saints made a makeshift small
[57:35] platform
[57:36] and they had hundreds and hundreds of
[57:38] chairs
[57:39] they all set out in the sun and they let
[57:42] me preach under the shade of a tree
[57:45] but it didn't hinder you at all
[57:48] you showed right up
[57:51] as a matter of fact I got a testimony
[57:54] from a young man
[57:56] not too many months ago
[57:58] that was at that meeting
[58:00] that had malaria
[58:02] the doctors had told him he'd have it
[58:05] the rest of his life
[58:07] but you showed up in such a way
[58:10] and healed that young boy that he was
[58:13] then
[58:14] that he's been back to the doctors time
[58:16] and time he's a curious creature they
[58:18] want to still keep testing him
[58:20] but there's not a trace left in his body
[58:24] because Jesus showed up under a tree
[58:27] I remember reading in the Bible there
[58:29] was another man
[58:31] that could testify about you showing up
[58:33] under a sycamore
[58:35] and you raised your eyes and said
[58:37] Zacchaeus make haste and come down yeah
[58:40] so we believe you'll gather you with us
[58:42] again tonight father we're so needy of
[58:45] you Lord
[58:46] please help us father speak to us from
[58:49] your word we ask
[58:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus and the
[58:53] Saints said amen amen God bless you you
[58:56] may be seated
[59:03] I believe we're certainly living in a
[59:05] great prophetic hour
[59:08] but there's parts of Prophecy
[59:10] I have no desire to fulfill
[59:13] there's parts of the scripture which are
[59:16] allocated to certain people such as
[59:20] Judas such as pharaoh
[59:23] such as vessels of Dishonor that I
[59:28] personally have no anointing that pushes
[59:31] me in that direction to be able to
[59:33] fulfill that portion of scripture
[59:36] there are people that are anointed to be
[59:38] deceivers there are people that are
[59:41] anointed to betray there are people that
[59:45] are anointed to set even around where
[59:47] the truth is preached and yet they will
[59:50] Journey along for a while and they'll
[59:53] stumble over something that is said and
[59:56] they'll begin to reason in their mind
[59:58] and then they will contemplate that
[1:00:01] they're not sure that this is actually
[1:00:02] the truth anymore and then they will
[1:00:05] turn and go the other way and become a
[1:00:08] very enemy to the thing that they once
[1:00:11] embraced
[1:00:12] but that's not my anointing
[1:00:15] I may say that's not your anointing
[1:00:17] either my anointing is to say Amen to
[1:00:21] the truth
[1:00:22] not only with my mouth but with my life
[1:00:26] and I'm glad that God has helped us to
[1:00:29] see that but yet we know nevertheless
[1:00:32] there are people who are called that
[1:00:35] will fulfill this side of Prophecy as
[1:00:38] well and we know that whenever God
[1:00:41] allocates his word that he must have
[1:00:44] those that are as we read it here the
[1:00:46] other day that are vessels which are for
[1:00:49] prepared to dishonor and on the other
[1:00:53] side of that there are vessels that are
[1:00:55] prepared to glory and we know that God
[1:00:58] is Not unjust and that he will not allow
[1:01:01] people if they want to be saved they can
[1:01:03] be but we also know that if you gave
[1:01:06] some people ten thousand years on this
[1:01:09] Earth at the end of that ten thousand
[1:01:12] years they would still say I hate God I
[1:01:15] don't want nothing to do with him I
[1:01:17] don't want to live for him and this is
[1:01:19] the way that God can be able to make his
[1:01:21] program work but because we have been
[1:01:25] called by God and and we have been
[1:01:28] lightened as the scripture says about
[1:01:31] this Mighty angel of Revelation 18 1.
[1:01:34] notice how John when he sees this in the
[1:01:37] vision and he said after these things I
[1:01:41] saw another Angel come down from heaven
[1:01:44] now John by chapter 18 has been visited
[1:01:49] by many different angels and remember
[1:01:52] that God gives different Angels
[1:01:54] different charges of his anointing of
[1:01:58] what they are supposed to do some of
[1:02:01] them were actually Earthly men that were
[1:02:04] Anointed with an Angelic anointing
[1:02:07] others were truly angels and they appear
[1:02:11] like angels and they were not men they
[1:02:14] were Angels Angelic creations of God and
[1:02:17] there were others that were fallen
[1:02:20] angels in that they had been given the
[1:02:24] privilege to walk before God and them
[1:02:26] they made their choice to listen to
[1:02:28] Lucifer and they fell from their first
[1:02:31] estate so there's all types of
[1:02:34] categories of angels even in the angels
[1:02:37] that did not fall there are cherubims
[1:02:41] seraphims zoons there are Mighty angels
[1:02:45] and angels of lesser degree we know even
[1:02:48] when Daniel Prayed and there was the
[1:02:51] Monarch the great Angelic power that
[1:02:54] when Daniel Prayed and he withstood the
[1:02:57] angel of God unto God had to send a
[1:03:00] mighty angel angel in rank higher and
[1:03:04] rank than this Fallen Angel even though
[1:03:07] this fallen angel had given his power
[1:03:10] his ability over to the kingdom of Hell
[1:03:14] unless sir angel in rank which had not
[1:03:17] Fallen at the beginning could not
[1:03:20] withstand him so God had to send another
[1:03:24] Angel which outranked this demon and
[1:03:28] Daniel had prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:03:31] and he wondered what in the world was
[1:03:33] going on and the angel told him from the
[1:03:35] first day that you prayed your prayer
[1:03:38] Was Heard but God had to send an angel
[1:03:42] which outranked him and he finally Ward
[1:03:45] and battled and Ward and he broke loose
[1:03:48] and while this one broke loose there
[1:03:50] were other angels that were there still
[1:03:53] holding open the door that God would be
[1:03:56] able to answer Daniel's prayer I wonder
[1:03:59] sometimes when we pray and we call out
[1:04:02] on the name of the Lord and we wonder
[1:04:04] why that the Lord hasn't moved for us I
[1:04:07] wonder if there's not a great Angelic
[1:04:09] war going on in our day as well
[1:04:11] so once you're praying don't stop and
[1:04:14] don't give up just keep on asking
[1:04:17] because God is hearing your prayer and
[1:04:21] we see then when we come to the Book of
[1:04:23] Revelation that it will be the
[1:04:25] culmination of all of these Angelic
[1:04:28] Powers a lot of folks they look at the
[1:04:31] time of the tribulation period and they
[1:04:33] think that Satan is totally in charge
[1:04:36] and in one way that is true but in
[1:04:40] another way God also is going to be
[1:04:43] doing great Mighty things in the
[1:04:46] tribulation period as a matter of fact
[1:04:48] the two witnesses of Revelation 11 they
[1:04:51] will have great power to control nature
[1:04:54] so Satan himself is not the only conduit
[1:04:58] or the only Power that will call for
[1:05:00] storms and all these sort of things but
[1:05:03] Moses and Elijah will be able to control
[1:05:06] nature during the time of the
[1:05:09] tribulation period so not only is Satan
[1:05:12] crown on the Earth but God will be doing
[1:05:15] great things and by that I don don't
[1:05:17] mean that by great things it'll always
[1:05:20] be good and it'll always be kindness but
[1:05:23] it still will be great now probably a
[1:05:26] lot of us share tonight we've not yet
[1:05:28] learned how to give praise and honor and
[1:05:32] allelujahs to God when God will bring
[1:05:36] Vengeance and when God will do things
[1:05:39] that looks very destructive in nature
[1:05:42] it's not the nature of human beings to
[1:05:46] be able to really grasp that as an
[1:05:48] attribute of God's love all I know our
[1:05:51] insurance companies and your policy if
[1:05:53] you read it real close you'll find a
[1:05:55] cause in there somewhere called an act
[1:05:58] of God and they will identify the
[1:06:02] typhoons hurricanes tornadoes this and
[1:06:04] that and the other and they will call
[1:06:06] them acts of God but we know Satan is
[1:06:10] the prince of the power of the air but
[1:06:14] yet there is an attribute of God that
[1:06:17] will move in Justice in Revenge and in
[1:06:21] Vengeance for his people
[1:06:24] that's right now the strange thing about
[1:06:26] it is the real saints of God as we'll
[1:06:28] find out in Revelation 19 that actually
[1:06:31] there is a call from heaven for the
[1:06:34] saints of God to begin to say these
[1:06:37] beautiful phrases which is what we know
[1:06:39] as alleluia
[1:06:42] alleluia in other praise yah praise yah
[1:06:48] the heavens are called to do it the
[1:06:50] Saints are called to do it the universe
[1:06:52] is called to do it and the reason
[1:06:54] they're called to do it is because he
[1:06:57] has Avenged the blood of his people upon
[1:07:00] this church that we're going to talk
[1:07:02] about tonight now most human beings
[1:07:04] without a revelation they look at that
[1:07:07] and they think oh my goodness how on the
[1:07:08] world could a loving wonderful kind God
[1:07:11] do that so you see it takes Revelation
[1:07:14] and understanding to be able to do it
[1:07:16] now watch this the prophet picks this up
[1:07:19] and why I am against organized religion
[1:07:23] and if you haven't into a while to do
[1:07:25] you good it's preaching November the
[1:07:27] 11th and 19 and 62. now this angel of
[1:07:30] Light is said remember the last Angel
[1:07:32] it's the angel in the church age of
[1:07:36] laodicea it's the laodicea messenger and
[1:07:40] he says the very next chapter chapter 19
[1:07:42] is the coming of the Bride then this
[1:07:45] last angel came to bring the light
[1:07:48] before the coming of the Bride to go
[1:07:52] meet Christ so here brother Madam
[1:07:54] identifies the messenger of Revelation
[1:07:57] 18 1 through 4 as the seventh Church
[1:08:01] AIDS messenger of Revelation 3 which is
[1:08:04] also the same messenger of Revelation 10
[1:08:07] 1 and Luke 17 28 to 30. also Malachi 4 5
[1:08:13] 6. also Zechariah 14. Prophecies of the
[1:08:18] Old Testament pointing to the coming of
[1:08:21] a prophet in the last day now unlike son
[1:08:24] some who will say they believe brother
[1:08:26] Branham as a prophet I think it takes
[1:08:28] more than just saying he was a prophet
[1:08:31] to be identified in the bride I believe
[1:08:34] that it requires more than just saying
[1:08:37] well I come out of her but I really
[1:08:39] don't feed on what he had to say well
[1:08:41] you're not really the bribe then because
[1:08:44] the bride is going to feed on the
[1:08:46] message of the hour
[1:08:49] now but yet we have preachers in our
[1:08:52] ranks and they say they believe malach
[1:08:54] come for and they say they believe that
[1:08:56] this message was sent from God but they
[1:08:59] really don't preach this message they
[1:09:01] just keep going back to the same old
[1:09:03] Bible stories that we preach for
[1:09:05] hundreds and hundreds of years and
[1:09:07] really don't pull it through the evening
[1:09:09] light of the end time well my friend
[1:09:12] you're not preaching or rapturing
[1:09:13] message in order to be in the Rapture it
[1:09:16] must be pulled through the anointing of
[1:09:18] the last day remember when the prophet
[1:09:20] preaches the seals and he sets up a box
[1:09:23] there even the question answers and he
[1:09:25] said now this is the anointing and he
[1:09:27] takes those four powers in Revelation
[1:09:29] each one identified through a church age
[1:09:32] and he said they could only work through
[1:09:34] that anointing that was released to them
[1:09:37] well Luther could only respond to the
[1:09:40] anointing God gave them in their day
[1:09:42] same with Paul same with irania same
[1:09:44] with all the rest of them and we will
[1:09:46] never be able to make it under the past
[1:09:48] anointings that had been released down
[1:09:51] Through the Ages they were wonderful in
[1:09:53] their day but we are the generation that
[1:09:56] needs enough Faith to take a body change
[1:10:00] oh my how we love the Epistles of Paul
[1:10:02] do we not how we love Peter and James
[1:10:05] and how we love the New Testament but
[1:10:07] think of it friends those Epistles did
[1:10:10] not contain the Revelation to produce a
[1:10:14] body change if it did that first church
[1:10:17] Aid should have been raptured 2 000
[1:10:19] years ago if preaching the New Testament
[1:10:23] will produce a body change I ask you why
[1:10:26] did not the first church AIDS go up why
[1:10:30] did they die
[1:10:31] because God was given them what they
[1:10:34] needed that was the anointing that was
[1:10:36] released for them but it did not contain
[1:10:39] rapturing faiths it contained a face
[1:10:42] that would keep them until their deaths
[1:10:45] and then what would they need a face to
[1:10:48] believe that God would raise them from
[1:10:51] the dead which is not the same thing as
[1:10:54] a rapturing faith so many of ours mine
[1:10:57] the last couple of years we've had
[1:10:59] several of our Saints to pass and go on
[1:11:01] but yet we believe I believe with all of
[1:11:04] my heart there's people sitting right
[1:11:05] here tonight that will never face death
[1:11:07] that will never die yes I'm an old man I
[1:11:11] understand I'm an old man too I'm
[1:11:13] looking for the come of the Lord every
[1:11:14] day that I get up he didn't come today
[1:11:17] well yeah but he might come tomorrow if
[1:11:19] it don't come tomorrow looking for him
[1:11:20] the next day because I believe we are
[1:11:23] that close
[1:11:25] well if if the face of just preaching
[1:11:28] what Paul said and just going back to
[1:11:30] that it did not Rapture them it won't
[1:11:32] Rapture me I need a message that will
[1:11:36] bring Rapture in faith you need your
[1:11:39] sick you need healing and your body you
[1:11:41] need to be able to hear something
[1:11:42] that'll build your faith to a level of
[1:11:44] Divine Healing is that right you need a
[1:11:47] devil cast out you need a lust or so
[1:11:49] whatever it is you're dealing with you
[1:11:51] need to hear something that'll build
[1:11:52] your faith that'll let you know that
[1:11:54] God's not dead but he's the same
[1:11:56] yesterday today and forever if we're
[1:11:59] going to take a rapture we need
[1:12:00] preachers to be in the word under the
[1:12:03] anointing of the end time to be able to
[1:12:05] preach to their people a message that
[1:12:08] will not only help them to survive
[1:12:09] laodicea but defile lay of the sin not
[1:12:13] just have enough Faith to be buried in
[1:12:15] the ground but have enough Faith to be
[1:12:18] standing one morning and all of a sudden
[1:12:20] a sweep goes over you and your sales and
[1:12:24] your bones and your muscles and your
[1:12:26] hair and everything about your mortal
[1:12:29] body will be changed at a moment in a
[1:12:32] twinkling of an eye
[1:12:35] [Applause]
[1:12:39] noticing the prophet said it was the
[1:12:42] last Church age message calling them out
[1:12:44] of Babylon these churches were caught in
[1:12:47] the cage with her with her dogmas
[1:12:50] denying the word and accepting dogmas
[1:12:53] but this is the angel of Light to the
[1:12:57] laodicean church the angel of Light to
[1:13:01] the laodicean church so what's he going
[1:13:03] to do he's going to bring light now
[1:13:04] don't get in your mind that brother
[1:13:06] random come to replace the Bible he
[1:13:08] didn't he said that the Bible become an
[1:13:11] Uber not a replaced book okay women no
[1:13:14] longer read the Bible I I still preach
[1:13:16] the justification but I'm preaching
[1:13:18] under the opening of The Seven Seals I
[1:13:20] preach sanctification but under the
[1:13:22] opening of The Seven Seals I preach
[1:13:24] Faith healing Deliverance but why under
[1:13:26] the opening of The Seven Seals Wesley
[1:13:28] prayed for the sin my goodness the man
[1:13:30] was out riding one day going to a
[1:13:32] meeting his horse fell in a hole broke
[1:13:34] his leg he got down off the horse laid
[1:13:36] hands on the horse and God healed the
[1:13:37] horse and he went on and preached they
[1:13:40] believed in Divine Healing they had all
[1:13:42] kinds of healings and miracles in the
[1:13:44] days of the preachers of the haymarkets
[1:13:46] and they would go out there they saw all
[1:13:48] kind of Supernatural So Divine Healing
[1:13:50] is not something new but we're not just
[1:13:53] preaching Divine Healing I'm preaching a
[1:13:55] Divine house that will take you beyond
[1:13:58] the temporary Divine Healing that will
[1:14:00] move you into an eternal body well
[1:14:03] you'll never get sick again
[1:14:05] praise the Lord
[1:14:07] amen do you believe that
[1:14:09] now notice he said on the Angel's
[1:14:12] message let's jump down here in the
[1:14:13] bottom part of this paragraph the
[1:14:15] messenger come from God was echoing his
[1:14:17] message on the earth which was come out
[1:14:20] of Babylon now notice again in
[1:14:23] Revelation 18 2 John said he cried
[1:14:25] mightily with a strong voice saying
[1:14:29] Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen
[1:14:32] and has become the habitation of devils
[1:14:34] and the hold of every foul spirit and a
[1:14:38] cage of every unclean and hateful birth
[1:14:41] I want you to sing this is how God looks
[1:14:44] at whatever this Babylon is and it's
[1:14:47] amazing because there are billions of
[1:14:50] people on the face of the Earth that
[1:14:53] belong to this Babylonian move and there
[1:14:57] are millions of others that don't
[1:14:59] actually belong to it by name but they
[1:15:02] are a daughter of the same move and they
[1:15:05] think it's so wonderful
[1:15:09] it never ceases to amaze me how
[1:15:11] spiritually dumb people can be
[1:15:14] because something that God curses and
[1:15:18] something that God says is against his
[1:15:21] word and people will embrace it as if
[1:15:24] it's the greatest thing that ever hit
[1:15:26] the Earth
[1:15:27] you ought to thank God tonight for light
[1:15:30] now notice how fast whatever this is how
[1:15:34] vast it is in verse 3 for all nations
[1:15:37] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[1:15:40] her fornication and the kings of the
[1:15:43] Earth have committed fornication with
[1:15:45] her fornication with her and the
[1:15:48] merchants of the earth so she must be a
[1:15:51] move that has power with Kings and she
[1:15:56] is a move that has been identified in
[1:16:00] all types of money making schemes and
[1:16:03] all types of manufacturing and
[1:16:06] productivity and things that are bought
[1:16:08] and sold
[1:16:10] reckon who that would be
[1:16:15] I read a few of these to you the other
[1:16:17] night most of you probably don't
[1:16:18] remember them so I'm going to read them
[1:16:19] to you again 30 years ago the Vatican
[1:16:22] bank had 10 billion dollars invested in
[1:16:25] foreign companies now this is 30 years
[1:16:27] ago you imagine what it is now the
[1:16:29] vaults hold at least one metric ton of
[1:16:33] gold 31 million dollars was seized from
[1:16:36] the Vatican Bank by the Italian
[1:16:38] authorities during an investigation into
[1:16:42] money laundering now that don't mean
[1:16:44] they was washing their hundred dollar
[1:16:45] bills but they was trying to hide them
[1:16:48] from the government and being able to
[1:16:49] know what they had
[1:16:51] two billion dollars was paid out as
[1:16:55] settlements by the church for sex abuse
[1:16:57] cases just in the United States two
[1:17:00] billion dollars in 2011 one offering the
[1:17:04] Peter's Pence brought in 86 million
[1:17:09] dollars one offering 86 million dollars
[1:17:13] the Sistine Chapel offers a look at how
[1:17:16] difficult it is to be able to appraise
[1:17:19] all of this estimates range from 400
[1:17:22] billion all the way up to two trillion
[1:17:25] dollars just for this one Masterpiece
[1:17:28] now I've stood there in this place it is
[1:17:30] absolutely unbelievable and remarkable
[1:17:33] and this is only one of their buildings
[1:17:36] that they own and possess around the
[1:17:39] world so we're not looking then at a
[1:17:42] church that specializes in casting out
[1:17:44] Devils Healing The Sick laying hands on
[1:17:47] them baptize them in the name of the
[1:17:49] Lord Jesus but what we're looking at is
[1:17:51] a system and a church that has all kinds
[1:17:55] of money invested in schemes and bonds
[1:17:58] and stocks well come on now
[1:18:02] so it's not a soul-saving station it's a
[1:18:06] soul damning station
[1:18:10] look friends playing talk is easy
[1:18:12] understood
[1:18:14] If You're Expecting for me to water this
[1:18:16] down tonight and keep all this head from
[1:18:18] it you all don't know me well do you
[1:18:21] notice this the Catholic church is the
[1:18:24] largest top most Christian organization
[1:18:26] which has an estimated wealth of more
[1:18:30] than 30 billion dollars in 2022. now
[1:18:33] remember this is only what's traceable
[1:18:38] that's only what traceable there ain't
[1:18:41] no telling what all they have uh you
[1:18:43] ought to see some of the pictures that
[1:18:44] I've been able to find in the miles of
[1:18:47] caves and all that's underneath the
[1:18:49] Vatican itself of the wells that was
[1:18:52] stolen from the Jews and stolen from
[1:18:55] different ones even as far back as World
[1:18:58] War II and a lot of the treasures and
[1:19:00] the things that they have oh my you know
[1:19:03] what they think that's great wealths one
[1:19:06] day they'll find out it's nothing
[1:19:09] estimation of its net worth comes from
[1:19:11] its ownership of properties including
[1:19:14] churches schools presbyteries hospitals
[1:19:18] nursing homes offices tennis courts and
[1:19:22] telephone Towers
[1:19:26] wow and where does that fit in the
[1:19:28] original thing go you therefore and
[1:19:30] preach the gospel cast out Devils heal
[1:19:33] the sick raise the Dead
[1:19:36] can't you see they are not interested in
[1:19:39] getting folks saved
[1:19:43] apart from this Catholic development
[1:19:46] funds Catholic Church insurance and
[1:19:49] Telecommunications are the resource of
[1:19:53] their wealth
[1:19:55] oh my goodness
[1:19:57] the Catholic church is basically not one
[1:20:00] organization economically it runs the
[1:20:03] largest network of charitable
[1:20:05] organizations in the world and it's
[1:20:08] never so easy to calculate the exact
[1:20:10] wealth of their Foundation but their
[1:20:12] assets are likely worth billions and
[1:20:15] billions of dollars
[1:20:19] I guess that leaves us out
[1:20:24] anybody in here got billions
[1:20:26] really Millions
[1:20:29] thousands
[1:20:31] anybody got a couple nickels you could
[1:20:32] rub together
[1:20:37] and you folks think you're worth
[1:20:38] something
[1:20:39] you think you've got wealth that the
[1:20:41] world knows nothing about us
[1:20:44] anybody here on a telecommunication
[1:20:46] satellite
[1:20:48] really
[1:20:49] so y'all y'all don't know thousands and
[1:20:52] thousands of Acres of property and and
[1:20:54] you don't own any satellites out there
[1:20:56] and eat on musk and all that can do this
[1:20:58] and that at the Catholic Church said all
[1:21:00] this and some of you uh just barely get
[1:21:03] by
[1:21:04] and you can feel the pain of inflation
[1:21:06] every time you buy groceries and go to
[1:21:09] the gas station
[1:21:10] you have to worry about it don't you you
[1:21:12] know why because you ain't got a whole
[1:21:14] lot of wealth in this world but aren't
[1:21:16] you glad you've got it laid up for
[1:21:18] inflation don't affect it I'm so glad
[1:21:21] I'm not a rich man I could have been a
[1:21:23] millionaire yeah I could have been I
[1:21:24] could have been a millionaire a few
[1:21:26] times over actually but I decided a long
[1:21:29] long time ago me and my little wife were
[1:21:31] sitting down on the porch of our single
[1:21:34] wide trailer down in Kentucky for you
[1:21:35] folks ever knew me and we're sitting out
[1:21:38] there just talking about the Lord and
[1:21:39] his goodness and his mercy and we said
[1:21:41] Lord we just sat there and prayed
[1:21:43] together and held hands we said Lord we
[1:21:45] don't know exactly what you want us to
[1:21:47] do but if you got something for us in
[1:21:49] our life Lord just help us to be able to
[1:21:51] do what you want you want to put things
[1:21:54] in our hands we'll put it back into your
[1:21:56] hands you want to be able to commit this
[1:21:59] to us little did I know what my future
[1:22:01] held but I've realized a long time ago
[1:22:04] it's not so much what you keep that
[1:22:07] makes you great it's what you give away
[1:22:11] you know you'll never be rewarded for
[1:22:13] all that you've kept in life for
[1:22:16] yourself your reward will be for those
[1:22:19] things you've given away
[1:22:22] oh praise the lord well some of you got
[1:22:25] quiet over there what happened
[1:22:27] my goodness some of y'all satis you pull
[1:22:29] the hair Plum off of George Washington
[1:22:32] hahaha
[1:22:33] notice this the Vatican has billions of
[1:22:36] shares in the most powerful
[1:22:39] International corporations in the world
[1:22:43] such as Gulf oil
[1:22:46] Shell Oil
[1:22:48] General Motors so when you crank your
[1:22:51] vehicle after church rub it and thank
[1:22:53] the Pope
[1:22:54] General Motors Bethlehem Steel
[1:22:58] General Electric International Business
[1:23:03] Machines
[1:23:05] you see John did not even know who the
[1:23:09] Catholic church was he never saw all the
[1:23:13] business Adventures that they were going
[1:23:15] to make but he spoke those words as if
[1:23:19] though he was reading from Google the
[1:23:22] very things I read to you just now but
[1:23:26] that's the way prophets of God spoke
[1:23:28] they spoke when there was nothing there
[1:23:31] they spoke when none of this existed
[1:23:34] that they spoke with the faith of God
[1:23:36] and knew one day it would and here you
[1:23:40] are tonight standing here and say my
[1:23:42] Lord I live in that day this day this
[1:23:47] scripture is fulfilled
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:58] so if I get thrown in jail over this I
[1:24:00] hope some of y'all at least come see me
[1:24:03] as the largest non-governmental
[1:24:06] landowner in the world
[1:24:08] the Catholic church has a mass a diverse
[1:24:11] Global portfolio
[1:24:14] of parishes schools monasteries
[1:24:18] cemeteries hospitals care facilities and
[1:24:23] combining to be an estimated as far as
[1:24:25] land and all of that
[1:24:28] 177 million Acres
[1:24:32] a property this is only as I said what
[1:24:35] is traceable
[1:24:37] oh my banker's best guess is about the
[1:24:40] vatican's wealth put it out between 10
[1:24:43] to 15 billion dollars of this wealth
[1:24:47] Italian stock Holdings alone run 1.6 15
[1:24:52] percent of the whole Italian stock
[1:24:57] market value is owned by the Catholic
[1:25:00] Church
[1:25:03] no wonder when Russia bombs her
[1:25:07] the shipbuilders looked at her smoke and
[1:25:10] they wept
[1:25:11] and they cried
[1:25:14] all these people of industry and
[1:25:17] commerce do you think they'd do that for
[1:25:19] us message folks
[1:25:22] if something happened to all of us in
[1:25:23] this oh no there goes all my money oh no
[1:25:26] there goes all my telecommunication
[1:25:29] satellite oh no yeah there goes this and
[1:25:31] there goes that would hardly even be
[1:25:33] missed when we're gone from this world
[1:25:36] hardly nobody will know we're gone it'll
[1:25:40] just be a group of people that come up
[1:25:42] missing swept out of here by the
[1:25:45] presence of God
[1:25:47] and we'll Say Goodbye World goodbye I've
[1:25:51] seen all this world I want to say what
[1:25:53] about you
[1:25:54] oh my the Vatican has investments in
[1:25:58] banking Insurance chemicals steel
[1:26:03] construction real estate oil
[1:26:06] Telecommunications
[1:26:14] there's just part of what I know they
[1:26:16] don't own and that's what's made in
[1:26:18] China
[1:26:21] they're probably on that too
[1:26:23] what's more than one billion
[1:26:27] followers
[1:26:30] the largest religion
[1:26:38] with more than one billion adherents a
[1:26:41] Catholic Church
[1:26:43] is the largest non-governmental
[1:26:45] landowner in the world
[1:26:48] they own equivalent to 277
[1:26:53] 000 square miles
[1:26:55] on the face of the Earth
[1:27:00] they better enjoy it
[1:27:02] because I'm fixing to take it over
[1:27:07] and I won't have to fire one shot
[1:27:11] I want you to notice as John
[1:27:13] when he goes down through verse 1 then
[1:27:16] to verse 2 and on down to verse 4. and
[1:27:19] he says I heard another voice now you'll
[1:27:24] notice this when you're reading the book
[1:27:25] of Revelation that John to identify
[1:27:28] either another Angelic being or another
[1:27:32] being of deity or another being that is
[1:27:36] being anointed on Earth by an Angelic
[1:27:38] anointing he will use the word time and
[1:27:42] time again another Voice or another
[1:27:46] Angel what is it it changes from the one
[1:27:49] he just saw to another now it's moving
[1:27:52] from this seventh angel which has
[1:27:54] proclaimed with a loud voice come out of
[1:27:57] her my people and he said get out of
[1:27:59] that mess get out of it now I want you
[1:28:02] to notice that what the prophet said is
[1:28:05] going to be echoed from heaven this
[1:28:09] shows the continuity and the closeness
[1:28:12] that this Prophet had in relationship to
[1:28:15] God now watch this in verse 4 and I
[1:28:17] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:28:20] come out of her my people now this is
[1:28:24] not that angel of Revelation 10 of the
[1:28:27] Revelation 18 1 but this is another
[1:28:30] voice and what was this voice this voice
[1:28:32] was from heaven and he said come out of
[1:28:36] her my people that ye be not partakers
[1:28:40] of her sins that you receive not her
[1:28:43] place you see there is a danger in the
[1:28:46] timeline to where we stay into something
[1:28:49] so long that that becomes our
[1:28:52] identification of Who We Are
[1:28:55] now notice God calling to his own well
[1:28:58] I'm glad we heard that call come out of
[1:29:00] her my people why because there's a
[1:29:03] timeline to where you cross it there be
[1:29:05] not partakers of our sins look at this
[1:29:08] word for taker it means to come together
[1:29:10] with others or to have fellowship with a
[1:29:14] thing to have Fellowship so you don't
[1:29:16] actually even you know totally agree
[1:29:18] with it but yet you fellowship with that
[1:29:21] move and you don't stand against it you
[1:29:23] see the time is coming to where every
[1:29:26] individual must make their choice and
[1:29:29] some people love the world of neutrality
[1:29:31] they're just you know yell as they can
[1:29:32] be and they ain't got a backbone at all
[1:29:34] and they just love neutrality well I
[1:29:37] hate to say anything against anybody I
[1:29:39] just love everybody you know I'm not
[1:29:42] going to say nothing against no
[1:29:43] denomination we got some of our jelly
[1:29:45] bone preachers on the message that do
[1:29:47] the same thing man got a bit more right
[1:29:49] to call to preach the gospel and then
[1:29:51] the groundhog does and they stand behind
[1:29:53] the pulpit and they polish every word
[1:29:54] and think it through and they ain't
[1:29:56] going to offend nobody even the devil
[1:29:58] well I'll tell you one thing if I preach
[1:30:00] one sermon and it don't tear hell up I
[1:30:02] need to repent of it
[1:30:04] Ah that's exactly right I think we ought
[1:30:07] to preach we ought to sing We ought to
[1:30:09] live that the devil hates every day I
[1:30:12] live on this Earth I hope if I go by the
[1:30:14] way of the grave and you all have my
[1:30:16] funeral that hell breaks out an ordained
[1:30:18] smile they shout from one end of Hell to
[1:30:20] the other and say glory to God that Holy
[1:30:23] Roller is gone wouldn't it be awful that
[1:30:25] whenever we're having your funeral that
[1:30:27] the demons down in hell are crying and
[1:30:30] sobbing like a rat eating onions and
[1:30:31] they're saying oh Lord oh goodness I use
[1:30:34] her all the time in the church I used
[1:30:36] him all the time in the church to cause
[1:30:38] trouble what are we going to do now Lord
[1:30:40] God don't let that be my testimony but
[1:30:43] let them Devils jump let them shout let
[1:30:46] them do whatever oh we're so glad he's
[1:30:48] gone he tormented us since he was a
[1:30:50] little boy and once he come to the
[1:30:52] trueness of the godhead he tormented us
[1:30:55] a little more I don't believe God just
[1:30:57] wants the preachers to torment the devil
[1:30:59] I believe God wants every man woman boy
[1:31:02] and girl that's filled with the Holy
[1:31:04] Ghost to let hail know you are here
[1:31:07] you're a daughter of God you're a Son of
[1:31:10] God and you were ordained to torment
[1:31:13] hell you were ordained to turn it the
[1:31:16] devil
[1:31:26] now what's the prophet again in this
[1:31:28] paragraph 207 why I'm against organized
[1:31:30] religion
[1:31:31] and he deals with this verse 4. look
[1:31:34] immediately after her mystery was made
[1:31:36] known who she was what she was who her
[1:31:39] daughters was the mystery had been made
[1:31:41] known then God sent an angel a messenger
[1:31:44] to what call out
[1:31:46] then he says the message
[1:31:49] off the hour
[1:31:52] so the message of the hour is not just
[1:31:55] God
[1:31:56] sent a prophet
[1:31:59] but what did he have to say when he got
[1:32:01] here
[1:32:02] that's the message of the hour don't
[1:32:04] just tell me God sent a prophet tell me
[1:32:06] what he said tell me what he said about
[1:32:09] living tell me what he said about gifts
[1:32:11] tell me what he said about going to
[1:32:13] church tell me what he said about how
[1:32:15] men ought to treat their wives how we
[1:32:17] ought to treat our children is that
[1:32:18] right somebody tell me what he said
[1:32:26] come out of her my people that should be
[1:32:28] not partakers with her plagues
[1:32:31] listen he said he's going to curse her
[1:32:34] come out of her God sent a mighty angel
[1:32:36] or a messenger and his light wasn't in a
[1:32:39] corner it's scattered over the Earth
[1:32:41] come out of her what her and her sisters
[1:32:45] to lighten the Earth call these people
[1:32:47] out now you know that's the truth a
[1:32:49] messenger was sent from God to God God's
[1:32:52] people out of Babylon and his light
[1:32:54] lighted the Earth the great Holy Spirit
[1:32:57] notice this Angel is the last messenger
[1:33:01] before the coming of Christ
[1:33:03] myself I'm not looking for another
[1:33:05] Prophet to rise on the Earth
[1:33:09] I'm not looking for an old Malachi four
[1:33:11] and a half point five
[1:33:13] or Malachi 4 6 version 2. I believe we
[1:33:17] don't have that message
[1:33:18] and I don't think God's got any pastors
[1:33:21] any teachers any evangelists on the
[1:33:22] earth that are sent to correct that
[1:33:24] Prophet neither
[1:33:26] well praise the Lord what we're called
[1:33:28] to do is stand up and say what he said
[1:33:30] say right there and lay it right out
[1:33:33] just the way he preach it don't water it
[1:33:35] down don't weaken It uncle brother
[1:33:36] Donnie people won't like it I know they
[1:33:38] won't like it but God will like it if
[1:33:41] you say what God Said God will back you
[1:33:45] up
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:51] look friends if God don't stand with me
[1:33:53] when I preach the truth leave
[1:33:57] if God backs up what men of God preach
[1:34:02] listen carefully to them
[1:34:05] follow the teaching that they're giving
[1:34:06] you
[1:34:08] because God will speak behind his
[1:34:10] servants
[1:34:11] notice he said oh my this I love this so
[1:34:15] much if we notice when he gave his voice
[1:34:17] on the earth there was a voice echoed
[1:34:20] again in heaven
[1:34:22] if you want to read it the message on
[1:34:24] the Earth was so inclined with God
[1:34:28] until when he spoke it on the earth God
[1:34:32] echoed the same thing
[1:34:34] Out of Heaven
[1:34:36] wow can you imagine how privileged we
[1:34:39] are to set under the the message of a
[1:34:41] prophet of God in this day that he says
[1:34:44] something on the earth and almighty God
[1:34:46] says the same thing out of heaven and
[1:34:48] Echoes the same message
[1:34:50] praise the Lord then I'll tell you one
[1:34:52] thing to me that ain't something to walk
[1:34:54] away from that ain't something to take
[1:34:56] lightly well I only want this and I only
[1:34:59] like that and I only want this not me
[1:35:01] brother I'll let God do all that sort of
[1:35:03] thing I just want to believe it obey it
[1:35:06] and live it don't you and say what has
[1:35:08] already been said
[1:35:10] oh my what is the fourth verse
[1:35:13] translation he said what does it mean
[1:35:15] God's voice speaking to his
[1:35:18] predestinated people saying come out of
[1:35:22] her amen just exactly what the voice was
[1:35:25] he's got people all out in there all out
[1:35:29] through Babylon come out of her that you
[1:35:31] don't be partakers of her sins of her
[1:35:33] dogmas and her and the Creeds and this
[1:35:36] is what you're coming to to the word
[1:35:38] made spirit and life
[1:35:43] and what does the majority of the world
[1:35:45] many of them don't even hear about this
[1:35:47] ah
[1:35:49] Holy Roller cult
[1:35:52] following a man
[1:35:55] we don't deny that
[1:35:57] would you rather follow a man or a
[1:36:04] well come on now
[1:36:07] look here in the Book of Revelation
[1:36:08] you're going to follow a man that's
[1:36:10] messenger sent out of Revelation 18 or
[1:36:12] you're going to follow this whole move
[1:36:15] well
[1:36:18] ah goodness I'll stay with the man
[1:36:20] myself
[1:36:22] notices of the 19th Chapter he said did
[1:36:24] you notice here after these things watch
[1:36:26] after what the message of come out of
[1:36:29] her then he said is the shout
[1:36:32] of the Bride Saints with the bridegroom
[1:36:35] going to the marriage of the Lamb
[1:36:37] Revelation 19 it's whenever the great
[1:36:39] consummation of this takes place let us
[1:36:41] be glad and rejoice and make Merry for
[1:36:44] the marriage of the Lamb is come when
[1:36:46] does that come after this voice calls us
[1:36:49] out in Revelation 18 4 come out of her
[1:36:52] my people and it was a sign that we come
[1:36:54] out because we rejoiced and we said
[1:36:57] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we
[1:37:01] heard the voice of God we heard God
[1:37:04] speak through a man and we heard the
[1:37:06] same spirit of God echoing from Heaven
[1:37:08] look what did you hear when you heard
[1:37:10] the message of the hour I didn't just
[1:37:12] hear a Kentuckian I didn't just hear a
[1:37:15] man that never had a high school
[1:37:16] education I heard a voice behind the
[1:37:19] voice something else what was it doing
[1:37:21] it was calling my name what about yours
[1:37:24] it was calling you out of that system
[1:37:27] you were in and was not only doing that
[1:37:30] it's calling you to separate from
[1:37:33] yourself
[1:37:35] Hallelujah God don't want me to just
[1:37:37] come out of the church God wants me to
[1:37:40] come out of me
[1:37:42] [Applause]
[1:37:52] then he asked this question
[1:37:54] how close are we then brother
[1:37:57] what's the last call
[1:38:00] come out of Babylon now my brethren
[1:38:02] that's the reason I'm against that can
[1:38:04] you imagine now this is a change in his
[1:38:07] ministry the end of 62. he's fixing to
[1:38:10] go into another place and always God
[1:38:12] would tell him come away from them
[1:38:14] Brethren sanctify yourself remember when
[1:38:16] the Angels is going to appear to him he
[1:38:17] said separate yourself from them
[1:38:19] brothers what was it for a
[1:38:21] sanctification a set of partners that
[1:38:23] God could deal with him oh Hallelujah
[1:38:26] now he's fixing to introduce something
[1:38:29] different so he preaches this may those
[1:38:31] great sermons the end of 62 and then he
[1:38:33] consummates that was this as a sign of
[1:38:35] the end time sir and the vision of the
[1:38:38] Lord come and he began to see those
[1:38:39] seven angels what was it 63 was becoming
[1:38:42] a new turn something was fixing to
[1:38:44] happen little did he know that in
[1:38:46] February that seven angels would come in
[1:38:48] the constellation and then in March he'd
[1:38:50] come back in Jeffersonville and the
[1:38:52] breaking of those seals when he went
[1:38:54] right back to the old notes that he had
[1:38:56] preached years and years ago and he said
[1:38:58] I would have made a horrible mistake
[1:39:00] today but the angel of the Lord come in
[1:39:02] the room and corrected me do you
[1:39:04] understand what those seals was he said
[1:39:06] each angel came each day and made the
[1:39:09] mystery known which was only known to
[1:39:11] them don't you understand it was the
[1:39:13] theophany as it was of Paul that come
[1:39:15] down that first revelation on that first
[1:39:18] seal every messenger Church age
[1:39:20] messenger that must have been awesome
[1:39:22] when it's all Paul it must have been
[1:39:24] awesome when he saw erroneous that I
[1:39:26] imagine it must have been asked someone
[1:39:27] he saw himself
[1:39:28] well glory to God when the seventh angel
[1:39:32] come to the seventh angel and he began
[1:39:35] to reveal that secret that was made
[1:39:37] known in the last day the seventh Church
[1:39:40] age the seventh watch the seventh seal
[1:39:42] the breaking of it all where in your
[1:39:45] time frame
[1:39:47] in your age
[1:39:48] [Applause]
[1:39:56] but you see it's at the end of this
[1:39:59] that his ministry is changing
[1:40:01] and this of course is when the
[1:40:03] denominations begin to say
[1:40:06] false prophet
[1:40:10] he had a great ministry they say
[1:40:12] but he got off at the end
[1:40:15] which is where we figure he really got
[1:40:17] on
[1:40:20] you listen to him in 65 and you'll hear
[1:40:22] him say himself it's not when the
[1:40:24] seventh angel first started out
[1:40:26] but when he sounded his message
[1:40:28] he said Jesus was really loved when he
[1:40:31] first started out oh Rabbi come here
[1:40:33] Rabbi come there but when he stood up
[1:40:35] and said I and my father are one oh
[1:40:38] brother Branham they loved him around
[1:40:39] the world none of them could touch him
[1:40:41] as long as they just pray for the sick
[1:40:43] they didn't want him to preach because
[1:40:44] they didn't think he was called to
[1:40:46] preach he didn't have no doctor's degree
[1:40:48] and wasn't even a license probably by
[1:40:50] another organization because he turned
[1:40:52] his ministerial card in so they thought
[1:40:54] all he was called to do was to be able
[1:40:56] to lay hands on the sick and they'd
[1:40:58] recover they didn't know that what he
[1:41:00] was doing was casting out bait to catch
[1:41:02] the rainbow trout hey man all that
[1:41:06] healing all that Miracle yes it was
[1:41:08] absolutely wonderful but he was baiting
[1:41:10] and getting ready he said hey man he
[1:41:12] ain't just saying in the little Menace
[1:41:14] on the top he's after rainbow trout
[1:41:16] rainbow Covenant people and that sign
[1:41:19] will get their attention and they'll
[1:41:21] hear it and then they'll set her under
[1:41:23] the presence of the word and all of a
[1:41:25] sudden the light of God will begin to
[1:41:27] Break Forth on the sea Gene in their
[1:41:28] soul and they'll say I see it glory to
[1:41:32] God I see it I see what he's talking
[1:41:35] about oh God I see it
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:40] and all many of them got was the fish
[1:41:48] your name is so-and-so you want to
[1:41:51] adultery I see your doctor had a sent
[1:41:53] man
[1:41:54] got glasses on
[1:41:55] don't you live on
[1:41:57] 22nd 8th Street
[1:42:00] your doctor's heavy said guy this you
[1:42:03] was there three days ago I mean they're
[1:42:05] just sitting there just gobbling lime
[1:42:07] sink or hook
[1:42:10] oh
[1:42:13] but it become toward the discernment was
[1:42:15] an entertainment
[1:42:17] and whenever he'd rest himself in the
[1:42:19] prayer lines and pull the gift of
[1:42:21] discernment over and just lay hands on
[1:42:23] them then what would happen people's
[1:42:24] faith that start down there now friend
[1:42:26] don't do that he's still here he's still
[1:42:28] he's still here and then he come back
[1:42:29] again now brother you know you've got
[1:42:31] this and this and why their faith washed
[1:42:32] their faith it would climb right back up
[1:42:34] again but look what he was doing it was
[1:42:37] building upon entertainment and that's
[1:42:38] what he said he had to apologize he said
[1:42:40] God forgive me I point it to the sign I
[1:42:44] pointed to the sign instead of the city
[1:42:46] he said if you're going to a certain
[1:42:47] city and you come up and there's a sign
[1:42:49] there and he said you don't stop at the
[1:42:51] sign but the sign is pointing you in the
[1:42:53] direction of the city and he said God
[1:42:55] forgive me I I pointed the people to the
[1:42:57] side when I should have been pointing
[1:42:59] them to the city oh don't you understand
[1:43:00] when he come out from under the first
[1:43:02] and second pull and went into the third
[1:43:04] pole what was it pointing to the city
[1:43:06] instead of the sign but you see some of
[1:43:09] the Cardinal minded message people
[1:43:10] they're still pointing to the sign
[1:43:12] itself it's time we get a hold of
[1:43:14] ourselves and realize amen is the city
[1:43:18] we're looking for
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:32] so with this phase
[1:43:34] people start leaving him
[1:43:38] start pulling away
[1:43:40] I always knew there's something funny
[1:43:44] I knew he was really weird
[1:43:51] but it just kept right on preaching
[1:43:55] I imagine he got so discouraged
[1:43:58] he wrote a letter in 1962 to a brother
[1:44:00] down in North Carolina
[1:44:02] Parker Thomas was his name
[1:44:05] he begins to explain to the brother how
[1:44:07] the gift begin to change and how as the
[1:44:10] word went on revealing itself that the
[1:44:12] people started pulling away
[1:44:14] pulling away having no more to do with
[1:44:17] him
[1:44:18] by the time it got to the end of his
[1:44:20] ministry
[1:44:21] a lot of the doors had shut in his face
[1:44:25] lived in Tucson forever so long
[1:44:28] According To None the preachers would
[1:44:29] invite him to come and preach can you
[1:44:30] imagine brother Brown Living in Johnson
[1:44:32] City and that's not inviting encourage
[1:44:37] but what did they miss the voice of
[1:44:41] Revelation 18.
[1:44:43] that offends me oh he blessed my church
[1:44:46] uh he he told me I'd have to quit
[1:44:48] cutting my hair and I'd have to do that
[1:44:50] that offends me just pray for me to get
[1:44:52] well and mind your own business and
[1:44:54] don't tell us what to do
[1:45:01] but it just kept sowing seed
[1:45:04] so unsafe
[1:45:06] I know you know this but you realize
[1:45:08] many of the Great sermons that we listen
[1:45:09] to on tape were preached at Ramada Inns
[1:45:14] the Rapture sermon
[1:45:16] was preached at the Ramada Inn
[1:45:19] by the Earl Williams told me he was
[1:45:21] there
[1:45:22] the people were standing on the back of
[1:45:24] the building you were too brother Harvey
[1:45:25] brother told me that the people were
[1:45:27] standing on the back of the building
[1:45:28] waving their hands trying to get brother
[1:45:31] Branham to stop
[1:45:33] I'm glad he didn't
[1:45:35] now that had a meal that that damn
[1:45:37] breakfast or dinner whatever it was and
[1:45:39] brother Rams just kept right on going oh
[1:45:42] I'm so glad he kept on going oh my right
[1:45:45] turn the Ramada in when the first time
[1:45:47] the Revelation struck the Earth about
[1:45:50] the mystery of the Rapture it wasn't in
[1:45:53] a church
[1:45:54] but a Ramada
[1:45:59] there was room for Jesus in the end then
[1:46:01] there's room for Jesus in the end now
[1:46:05] mm-hmm
[1:46:12] notice this in Revelation 18 5 her sins
[1:46:16] have reached unto heaven
[1:46:20] her sins have reached
[1:46:23] unto heaven
[1:46:25] and God
[1:46:27] has remembered her iniquities it's not
[1:46:29] so much now that their sins are
[1:46:31] accumulation and accumulating in a mass
[1:46:33] or a pile and they're piling up in one
[1:46:35] power but they become so great you know
[1:46:38] there's difference of times in the Old
[1:46:39] Testament God come down to check Sodom
[1:46:42] and Gomorrah to see if it was the way it
[1:46:45] sounded and the way it heard
[1:46:47] remember Genesis 4 10. speaking to Cain
[1:46:50] he said why has what is thou done the
[1:46:53] voice of God brother's blood Christ unto
[1:46:56] me from the ground
[1:46:59] and God heard her sins
[1:47:03] God remembered
[1:47:08] God remembered every time John tetzel
[1:47:13] went through the time of the Dark Ages
[1:47:15] and started selling novenas because the
[1:47:18] church needed money
[1:47:21] so John tetzel is the Catholic Church
[1:47:23] representative begin to move from one
[1:47:26] city to another and come up magnified
[1:47:29] the ideology of being able to pray your
[1:47:33] family out of purgatory
[1:47:37] so you imagine you got an uncle that
[1:47:39] died and he wasn't right wasn't ready to
[1:47:41] meet God
[1:47:42] and your leader comes and tells you if
[1:47:45] you'll give us so much money
[1:47:47] we'll get him out of purgatory for you
[1:47:51] now maybe if you didn't have enough to
[1:47:52] pay the whole cash bail
[1:47:54] they would at least try to shorten his
[1:47:56] time there
[1:47:58] I'm glad we Bible Believers don't even
[1:48:00] believe in purgatory
[1:48:03] brother random said there is a Purgatory
[1:48:05] right now but it's it's right now we're
[1:48:06] going through it we're being purged by
[1:48:07] the washing of the water of the word
[1:48:10] but can you imagine you've got money you
[1:48:12] say my daddies are in purgatory he's
[1:48:14] there if I give them 500 who would say
[1:48:16] it would cut his time in half
[1:48:19] well who wouldn't that had enough money
[1:48:21] wouldn't do it
[1:48:23] so they started selling these
[1:48:25] indulgences and novenas
[1:48:27] God said it started reaching up so they
[1:48:31] got a saint for protection and they got
[1:48:33] a saint for health and they got a saint
[1:48:35] for this my luck I'd forgive which Saint
[1:48:38] it was and I'd call on the saint of
[1:48:40] broccoli and me needing a Deliverance
[1:48:42] for something oh
[1:48:43] oh
[1:48:44] all right aren't you glad you've only
[1:48:46] got one name to remember in the time of
[1:48:49] trouble and in the time of difficulty it
[1:48:52] ain't Saint Cecilia for a headache and
[1:48:55] Saint John for this it's the power
[1:48:57] powerful name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:00] It cast out Devils it heals the sick and
[1:49:03] it don't cost you one penny
[1:49:06] Hallelujah he purchased it for you
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:16] I've read this
[1:49:19] it seems where John said and God
[1:49:22] has remembered
[1:49:25] her
[1:49:26] iniquities
[1:49:29] Lord God
[1:49:31] you see remembrance
[1:49:34] of iniquity signifies
[1:49:36] a level of non-forgiveness
[1:49:40] Lord children can you imagine how much
[1:49:43] sin we would accumulate in a lifetime of
[1:49:46] just a mortar if we live 55 60 65 years
[1:49:49] old whatever we'd be and it would be an
[1:49:52] accumulation of stuff every day that we
[1:49:54] did and we had to stand before God at
[1:49:56] the end of our life
[1:49:58] with no blood to wash us for the gym
[1:50:01] can you imagine how horrible how
[1:50:03] wretched we would be and yet this system
[1:50:06] has been alive for hundreds
[1:50:09] almost 2 000 years
[1:50:13] so her monks her Jesuits
[1:50:20] her Bishops
[1:50:22] how many little boys
[1:50:24] have they fooled with
[1:50:26] and ruined them
[1:50:28] their life oh sat there and look at me
[1:50:30] like you know what I'm talking about
[1:50:33] what about those they've damned to hell
[1:50:36] with her false Doctrine
[1:50:40] so you do something wrong say 13 Hail
[1:50:42] Marys Hail Mary Mother of God pray for
[1:50:44] us sinners now the time of our departure
[1:50:45] amen so you repeat that 15 times what
[1:50:48] good does it do not one bit
[1:50:53] so it's accumulated through the Dark
[1:50:55] Ages accumulated when Luther saw the
[1:50:58] lighter the Reformation
[1:51:00] but now God says it's God's Soul
[1:51:02] accumulated
[1:51:04] I remember
[1:51:06] and now Grace has left the sanctuary
[1:51:09] Mercy's gone
[1:51:13] says I remember a little boy every
[1:51:15] little child you molested
[1:51:19] have a woman you told her
[1:51:22] to pray and say Hail Mary
[1:51:24] the rosary you imagine Peter having a
[1:51:28] rosary around his neck
[1:51:32] oh come on no said there look at me oh I
[1:51:35] know some of you all just your Fox
[1:51:36] friends favorites but if you ever listen
[1:51:38] to them some of them people are very
[1:51:40] close they pray to the Roser like any
[1:51:42] other Catholic does
[1:51:44] don't make them people your hero make
[1:51:46] Jesus Christ your hero
[1:51:49] amen
[1:51:52] over the dolly Fox and Friends I'd
[1:51:54] Rather Have Jesus and his friends
[1:51:56] they're real friends that'll stick with
[1:51:59] you
[1:52:03] oh my
[1:52:06] so the punishment
[1:52:08] of the sin is brought about
[1:52:11] by the remembrance
[1:52:13] Lord have mercy
[1:52:17] I'm so glad
[1:52:19] I won't be punished
[1:52:21] by my remembrance
[1:52:24] anybody in here to not remember things
[1:52:26] you've done wrong that you wish you
[1:52:28] hadn't have done wrong
[1:52:30] and you wished somehow the Lord rest the
[1:52:33] Goodman used to sing a song years and
[1:52:34] years ago Lord pay my mind
[1:52:39] with the blood of calvary
[1:52:45] wash something in the saw in the heart
[1:52:47] of that artist what not only sold to be
[1:52:50] painted
[1:52:51] why there you begin to relive those
[1:52:55] failures those mistakes me once they get
[1:52:58] past it but I'm so glad just because I
[1:53:01] remember they don't
[1:53:05] praise God
[1:53:07] you see that's one of the revelations of
[1:53:09] justification Luther preached
[1:53:11] justification it was wonderful in that
[1:53:13] light friends we preached justification
[1:53:16] not in the same light Luther did we
[1:53:18] preached justification that it's not
[1:53:20] you're forgiven from it you never did it
[1:53:23] in the first place
[1:53:24] looser did not preach it that way why
[1:53:28] how could we preach it that way the
[1:53:30] opening of The Seven Seals
[1:53:32] hallelujah it's not like well God will
[1:53:34] forgive you but he'll always remember no
[1:53:37] justification unto the Seven Seals what
[1:53:39] that seeking inside of you never done it
[1:53:42] in the first place it wasn't you it was
[1:53:45] that old nature you was married to but
[1:53:48] you never done it where do we get that
[1:53:51] at under the evening light
[1:53:54] Hallelujah
[1:54:02] then what does that do for us it brings
[1:54:05] us down to Invisible Union
[1:54:07] that he took your old book
[1:54:10] of divorcement
[1:54:16] Hallelujah he didn't just hiding under
[1:54:19] his arm and said all right I'm going to
[1:54:20] wash your eye now if he messes up I'm
[1:54:22] dragging out this book no that's the way
[1:54:24] we do one another
[1:54:25] and you husbands and wives that are
[1:54:27] getting into arguments and forgive one
[1:54:29] another of this and that and the other
[1:54:30] and then the next argument you bring it
[1:54:32] right back up again shame on you you
[1:54:35] need to forgive and you need to move on
[1:54:37] you need to move on by the grace of God
[1:54:40] don't be like the devil the devil is the
[1:54:43] one that brings back our sins and our
[1:54:46] mistakes but we need to move into the
[1:54:48] realm of God's grace and mercy and
[1:54:51] forgive from our hearts
[1:54:59] whew
[1:55:01] so God
[1:55:10] but God has just allowed a group of
[1:55:13] people and how about the time this is
[1:55:14] going on
[1:55:16] to come into His presence
[1:55:18] and he looks at them and said
[1:55:21] I want to say I don't ever remember
[1:55:24] you being anything
[1:55:30] or my daughter
[1:55:32] he's not acting he's not just saying
[1:55:35] that because that's you know it just
[1:55:36] sounds good
[1:55:38] he honors safe
[1:55:40] cannot remember
[1:55:42] God can do so many things
[1:55:45] but the blood of Jesus is so powerful
[1:55:48] it erases our past
[1:55:50] and he cannot wait
[1:55:54] that's more than my little puny mind can
[1:55:56] comprehend anybody and you're with me
[1:55:58] but it's not like it's just well I'll
[1:56:00] just I'll just act like he's not acting
[1:56:04] his mind is so released
[1:56:07] from our past
[1:56:10] then Carol will sit and have a
[1:56:12] heart-to-heart talks from time to time
[1:56:15] we shouldn't have one that long ago and
[1:56:16] she said
[1:56:18] thank you for loving me
[1:56:21] and she said I'm sure that I've
[1:56:23] I've disappointed you so many times I
[1:56:25] said probably not know as many times
[1:56:27] I've disappointed you
[1:56:29] she said I hope
[1:56:31] that you can find it in your heart
[1:56:33] to forgive me for every time I've ever
[1:56:35] hurt you or disappointed you
[1:56:40] I said Carol
[1:56:43] to be honest with you
[1:56:46] mainly all I remember
[1:56:49] about you
[1:56:50] and about our marriage
[1:56:52] about our time together
[1:56:55] it's not your failures
[1:56:57] it's not your shortcomings
[1:57:00] it's about what a great friend you've
[1:57:02] been to me
[1:57:04] what a companion you've been
[1:57:06] what an encouragement you've been to me
[1:57:10] and sometimes when I just absolutely
[1:57:12] felt like walking away from the pulpit
[1:57:14] and never preaching another sermon
[1:57:18] so discouraged
[1:57:20] that I didn't feel like even doing it
[1:57:22] again
[1:57:23] I know some of you find it may find it
[1:57:24] hard to believe
[1:57:26] but I have been so discouraged at times
[1:57:29] I didn't even have the strength
[1:57:35] I said just a few weeks ago
[1:57:37] with my laptop in my lap
[1:57:41] I was so distraught
[1:57:44] and so discouraged
[1:57:48] couldn't even study
[1:57:51] I had four Microsoft windows open with
[1:57:53] different things going I had four
[1:57:54] different message Windows going four
[1:57:56] different Bible Windows going all
[1:57:58] different kinds of things open and I sat
[1:58:00] there and I sat there and I looked at it
[1:58:03] I just thought
[1:58:05] I just can't do it
[1:58:08] I closed the lid on my laptop
[1:58:11] and laid it down beside my chair
[1:58:14] I sat there and started shaking
[1:58:16] uncontrollably
[1:58:18] my feet were shaking in my chair my face
[1:58:21] was shaking
[1:58:23] my hands
[1:58:25] my whole body went into this convulsion
[1:58:29] of sitting there shaking wow
[1:58:40] but you know what that little woman of
[1:58:41] mine does
[1:58:43] when she sees me discouraged
[1:58:46] she'll get in my face and she'll say
[1:58:48] God calls you
[1:58:53] don't you let the devil defeat you
[1:58:56] [Applause]
[1:58:58] Hallelujah
[1:58:59] [Applause]
[1:59:03] so if the Lord puts it on your heart
[1:59:05] some Wednesday morning at 3 30 in the
[1:59:08] morning
[1:59:08] don't call me at 3 30 please because I
[1:59:10] might have just went to sleep
[1:59:12] but to write me a card or send me a text
[1:59:15] obey him because you never know what I'm
[1:59:18] going through
[1:59:19] you never know that person that God puts
[1:59:21] on your heart
[1:59:23] oh my
[1:59:24] so you see when God calls us he don't
[1:59:27] eradicate all of our Humanity you
[1:59:29] imagine brother Branham brother Charlie
[1:59:31] Cox told me one time that brother Banks
[1:59:33] was living right next door to brother
[1:59:34] Branham he went into his house and
[1:59:36] brother random was sitting there with
[1:59:37] his head down in his hands crying
[1:59:40] and he asked sister media what's wrong
[1:59:42] with him what's wrong is he sick
[1:59:45] she said he don't know if he's called a
[1:59:48] preacher or not
[1:59:53] Elijah
[1:59:58] you see one day all this Humanity will
[2:00:02] be laid aside
[2:00:04] and I'll finally be able to have a mind
[2:00:07] that's like God
[2:00:10] I'll never again remember
[2:00:13] my weaknesses
[2:00:15] my failures
[2:00:17] bummer Stakes
[2:00:20] and neither were you
[2:00:27] Hallelujah
[2:00:30] Hallelujah
[2:00:33] listen in Revelation 18 6 reward her
[2:00:36] even as she rewarded you double
[2:00:40] unto her devil
[2:00:43] according to her works
[2:00:45] in the cup which you have filled
[2:00:49] to her double
[2:00:51] wow
[2:00:53] so this is how God
[2:00:55] is going to deal with this
[2:00:58] God says give her double
[2:01:01] of what she's done
[2:01:03] reward her double
[2:01:07] well you think about it on the grace
[2:01:09] side
[2:01:11] Jesus said
[2:01:12] we'll come up before in that day and say
[2:01:15] enter into the joys of the Lord
[2:01:18] you have been faithful
[2:01:21] over a few things
[2:01:24] but I'm going to reward you with many
[2:01:28] our little position in life will be so
[2:01:30] small No Doubt
[2:01:32] we'll live our life and go and in in a
[2:01:35] few years even if you're a great
[2:01:36] preacher just a few years and people
[2:01:38] heart even remember you
[2:01:40] you'll be gone just back to the dust as
[2:01:43] far as the body your memory will fade in
[2:01:45] time that's just the way it's always
[2:01:46] been
[2:01:47] but what little bit that we've done for
[2:01:49] the kingdom of God when we stand before
[2:01:51] him that day it will be so great
[2:01:55] in his eyes
[2:01:57] that's on this side of Grace but on the
[2:02:00] other side of Grace
[2:02:01] when you have sins that aren't forgiven
[2:02:04] he says about these people double
[2:02:07] what they've done double it
[2:02:13] let me jump over here just a little
[2:02:17] this is how I can have confidence in
[2:02:20] what's fixing to happen
[2:02:22] in this last days
[2:02:24] that God
[2:02:26] listen to this
[2:02:28] remember I say this
[2:02:30] as God's prophet
[2:02:33] the Russian Empire
[2:02:36] now remember not USSR
[2:02:40] the Russian Empire will drop
[2:02:43] an atomic bomb
[2:02:46] of some sort
[2:02:49] that's another way he says this
[2:02:51] of some sort
[2:02:54] on the Vatican City
[2:02:57] and destroy it in one hour
[2:03:01] thus saith the Lord
[2:03:07] she will be destroyed
[2:03:09] in one hour
[2:03:13] and while that's going on on here
[2:03:16] you'll be up there in another dimension
[2:03:21] then in that Realm you won't be able to
[2:03:23] remember your past either
[2:03:26] wouldn't that be awesome just to wake up
[2:03:28] in the morning
[2:03:29] and all of your past was just gone
[2:03:33] couldn't remember one mistake wow that
[2:03:35] that would pretty much be heaven on
[2:03:36] Earth wouldn't it would never remember
[2:03:38] any bad thing brother Levi nothing we've
[2:03:41] ever said or done or whatever it is
[2:03:44] oh
[2:03:45] be faithful children
[2:03:51] Lord Jesus
[2:03:55] we may go through this life father
[2:03:58] never be important people
[2:04:01] no doubt the majority of your people
[2:04:03] will never be in the who's who
[2:04:07] they will never receive a personal
[2:04:09] invitation from the president to come to
[2:04:12] the White House or
[2:04:13] some Senator or congressman
[2:04:16] come to their home and visit him
[2:04:19] most people
[2:04:21] will just never have that type of
[2:04:22] acknowledgment
[2:04:24] but yet the king of kings
[2:04:28] the Lord of lords
[2:04:30] the almighty God
[2:04:32] come down to this earth
[2:04:34] to take our sin
[2:04:37] upon himself
[2:04:40] oh Jesus how we thank you for that
[2:04:44] Lord I know tonight
[2:04:47] if our sins were to be remembered
[2:04:50] that wouldn't be one of us in this place
[2:04:51] or one under the sound of my voice
[2:04:54] that would want to stand before you
[2:04:56] and give an account of our sins
[2:04:59] and what makes us different
[2:05:02] there's not a doubt in my mind
[2:05:04] these popes these Bishops these Friars
[2:05:08] these monks
[2:05:09] they've read in the Bible they know Acts
[2:05:11] 2 38 they know it
[2:05:14] but they turn it down
[2:05:17] and they say the Bible is not what's
[2:05:19] important
[2:05:20] it's the church
[2:05:22] but when the church has been annihilated
[2:05:26] with an atomic bomb
[2:05:28] you said heavens and earth shall pass
[2:05:30] away but my word
[2:05:33] shall never pass away
[2:05:36] so Lord we don't want to be a part of
[2:05:38] this Babylon
[2:05:40] we want to be a part of that word
[2:05:42] because if we're a part of that word
[2:05:44] when Rome is destroyed when our nation
[2:05:48] fulfills the seventh vision
[2:05:51] when Russia
[2:05:53] blows our nation into such a position
[2:05:56] that the LIE saying the prophet saw was
[2:05:58] craters and smoke
[2:06:01] it didn't say anything about seeing one
[2:06:03] life human being
[2:06:07] Lord we know
[2:06:09] with the Satan II
[2:06:12] Russia's great
[2:06:14] powerful
[2:06:16] missile
[2:06:18] that can carry up to 10 Ward heads
[2:06:22] with many more times
[2:06:24] kilotons of power
[2:06:26] that was in the drama on Hiroshima and
[2:06:30] Nagasaki
[2:06:32] and when he comes up in the atmosphere
[2:06:34] miles above the Earth
[2:06:37] chamber will pull apart
[2:06:39] and each Warhead will be programmed one
[2:06:43] to Chicago one to Washington
[2:06:47] one to New Mexico one to Oak Ridge
[2:06:52] we have nothing in our Armory
[2:06:55] so far that can be able to even catch it
[2:06:57] it'll move so fast
[2:07:00] Lord God I'm so grateful
[2:07:03] that we're going to be hid
[2:07:05] ing so Rock of Ages
[2:07:08] let the world laugh at us
[2:07:11] let him make fun of us
[2:07:13] Lord Jesus let them call us names
[2:07:17] but let you call us out of here that's
[2:07:19] what we're waiting for
[2:07:22] if there's one year tonight Lord
[2:07:24] who needs the Holy Ghost if there's one
[2:07:26] father
[2:07:28] that there's a sin that hangs over him
[2:07:30] it's not so much in the past
[2:07:32] but it's in the present
[2:07:34] Lord God help him I pray
[2:07:37] in the name of Jesus
[2:07:39] May the spirit of God
[2:07:42] help us as your children that every sin
[2:07:45] every shortcoming will be brought under
[2:07:48] our feet by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[2:07:51] glory be to God
[2:07:52] Hallelujah
[2:07:54] Lord for some who still live
[2:07:57] in that world of their past
[2:08:00] and their memories so imprints upon them
[2:08:02] and Lord they'll hear a song going
[2:08:04] through Walmart and through those and
[2:08:06] it'll carry them back decades ago when
[2:08:08] they were drinking and this and that and
[2:08:10] the other I pray you'd help them Lord
[2:08:13] we know those things that they're
[2:08:15] imprinted on our mind
[2:08:17] Lord Jesus may we be faithful to one day
[2:08:20] our minds will finally be changed
[2:08:24] painted with the blood of Jesus as it
[2:08:27] were
[2:08:28] then we will no longer ever remember
[2:08:31] being a sinner
[2:08:33] but all will ever be able to remember
[2:08:37] then we'll be burst into that word form
[2:08:39] body which was ours and in there will
[2:08:43] know all things
[2:08:45] and it's as if though our past life
[2:08:48] will cease to exist in our memory
[2:08:52] I don't know how you'll do it but Lord
[2:08:54] the prophet said we'll all get together
[2:08:55] in just a few moments he knows we'll be
[2:08:58] looking around to see if so-and-so made
[2:08:59] it or so and so and then after we greet
[2:09:02] one another
[2:09:04] something will happen to our minds and
[2:09:07] if Mama didn't make it brother didn't
[2:09:08] make it sister didn't make it it's like
[2:09:11] that Association of them in our life and
[2:09:13] our minds will be forever settled and
[2:09:16] separated
[2:09:17] and will never again think of them as
[2:09:19] Brethren or mother or father or uncle
[2:09:23] Heaven wouldn't be heaven as long as we
[2:09:26] had to think that way
[2:09:28] but it's like we'll be born into a new
[2:09:30] family
[2:09:31] the Eternal family

[2:17:37] through the prayer line that brother
[2:17:39] Branham had in 65 there in Shreveport I
[2:17:42] believe it was and whenever she had been
[2:17:44] doing some things that wasn't right she
[2:17:45] got into prayer lines her mom and daddy
[2:17:47] didn't know she was doing these things
[2:17:48] she was scared totally to death because
[2:17:51] she hadn't seen that Prophet call people
[2:17:53] out and tell them this and that and the
[2:17:55] other well from the time she got in the
[2:17:57] prayer line until she got up to where
[2:17:59] brother Branham was she repented and
[2:18:02] whenever she repented and got before
[2:18:04] that Prophet not one thing was mentioned
[2:18:07] about her past
[2:18:08] now that hadn't been repented of 45
[2:18:10] years ago it just happened 15 or 20
[2:18:13] minutes ago but it was so taken care of
[2:18:16] that God couldn't even show it to his
[2:18:18] prophet
