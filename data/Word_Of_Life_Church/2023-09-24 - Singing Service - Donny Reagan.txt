let's let's sing some songs and get ready let's can we just pray before we do it would you stand with me just for a second if you would we'll say I appreciate each one of you coming several from Anderson South Carolina is here today we're grateful for each one of them I won't call their names because I'll probably miss somebody but I'm grateful for them that they're here today so let's just buy our hearts and our heads our gracious Heavenly Father what an opportunity we have today to be able to come before the Throne of mercy and Grace Lord come and praise and worship Lord as brother Philip has already spoke and prayed over the prayer request Lord but God to be able to come through these doors on a Saturday night Lord that where it's been closed down for several years because of the coven but God we're so grateful to stand here tonight with friends and family Lord and the Saints and the elect seed of God what a time that we can have tonight so Lord as we sang songs Tonight We Lay it in your hands Lord if there's a few testimonies Lord ever what you would lead us to do to read a scripture Lord to expound a few minutes whatever he wants what we want but Lord we're grateful to be here for the opportunity Lord that radanis give us and the Saints of this church here we're grateful for it and those that come with from Anderson South Carolina thank you Lord Lord may you heal the sick tonight God May every Spirit Lord if it's not like you Lord may it be cast out Lord I recall David playing there for Saul and Lord he played that when evil spirits would leave so there's power in worship there's power in prayer there's power in the music that these precious brothers and sis sisters will be playing we're grateful for it and take the words of each song Lord and may you use them for your glory in your kingdom for we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ and the Bride Can Say one more good hand clap of Praise in Jesus name amen Stephen amen you can be seated for a minute I have prayed over songs and prayed over songs and mother Donnie said let's preach I said well just let me sing and you preach and then I got win somebody said he mentioned a couple of weeks ago well my brother Tim said wants him to preach and he wanted me to preach and we went back and forth he said well we'll just see who wins the battle well I won the battle so but I I told him I'd really rather for him to speak in the morning because I just believe there's something to be said that God could do and but we appreciate the opportunity to be here today and sing a few songs for you in worship worship is a powerful thing John Calvin makes a statement he said when music and worship becomes just music and worship he said we've lost the effect of it we have all of these music and all this what they call gospel music and whatever they want to call it what have they done they've lost the effect of what it's for it's where you can take and open and a door will open and a door opens and you walk in the door where are you walking to into the presence of the king of kings what's amazing is when he holds out the golden Sepulcher as he did in this Esther and that's what we're here for tonight because it's powerful don't don't let Satan cheat you out of a blessing if you need something you say but if the word ain't coming forth I can't get in that no yes you can I've heard the prophet say he got it in JCPenney's parking lot you can get it anywhere you want it whatever you need you believe that brother Paul told me that he has been praying he's come expecting if we've all come like brother Paul told me the Rapture just may take place tonight it's very possible so we're looking for a good time and I prayed over songs that the right song Would Be Sung not just to get up here and be heard that's why I told brother Donnie I said I'm not one to come and take over a service I tried my best to get out of this I told him in there I ain't telling you I'm coming no more I'm just going to sneak in the back door and then one sister said well if you do that somebody's going to see you and they're going to come run and then brother Paul said you have to put a bag over your head so have you ever see somebody come through with a bag with their head you know it's Tim Burdette so we can't use that now brother Paul but it's good to be here ain't it amen let me get back here foreign you told me that at five o'clock today didn't you [Music] man it seemed like God has led me to this song over and over and over and over again I'd wake up at two and three in the morning brother Harry and it I was singing it and God was just I could see it so I want to start with this and I believe it's God doing this we're grateful for that today my Jesus my savior Lord there's none like you oh up my day I wanna praise the wonders of your mighty [Music] my comfort my shelter Tower huge and strength let every breath and all that I am never cease to work shove you Shout to the Lord

the promises in you [Music] in you in you [Music] oh Hallelujah if we can open the door and walk through brother Harry the door and the Praises and the smokes feeling amen the anointing that's what it's for just to bring worship and praise oh my there'd be something inside of that presence brother Aaron that each one of us could benefit from what's amazing about God is he knows every need and if you walk through that door and the presence of God begins to come down he knows this one's need and this one's need and this one's need and this one's need and this one's need and it's just one God Hallelujah oh give Jesus Christ a head cup of praise Glory hallelujah hallelujah oh he's a wonderful ain't he we'll go saying one that we haven't sung here well I don't have that paper but I think I know it you had to put me in the right leg you know it's tough so glad to be here with y'all again his uh it's hard when I have to read off of something it's easier when I can just learn the song and get up there and just let it froze by Donnie but I started to do this song here last time and I didn't do it and but I do love this song we saw second birth of uh some of you may have heard it before I've had a birth that I can't remember and I've had one that I can't forget but I that's pretty much what it's saying and it's it's a real good song and it's tough I play drums at our church and if I knew the brother here was going to be here I'd have him take this but I come in and I just rearranged his drums for you I'm sorry brother I made the throne a little higher but he's a little taller than I am as you can tell but I do love the Lord I know you love the Lord and we're such a blessed people I've been so blessed I really have more than I deserve through through my life he's done things for me that that couldn't be done without Christ and I thank him for that but we're going to do this song for you and you know any song we do you're welcome to we're all singers for Christ so you're welcome to join in let's see this is why I don't like reading off a paper [Music] when I came into this old world I just can't recall I don't remember anything about my birth at all but on [Music] in prayer I never will regret I've had a birth I can't remember one I can won't forget oh and to this world it makes no difference some may even frown wrong but the angels all rejoice when my name was written down unworthy of his Mercy but still he paid my debt I've had a birth I can't remember and one I can't forget listen to this it never made the paper never made the evening news when I took off the old man and Christ put on the news all of my sins were cast into the sea of forgetfulness as far as the East is from the West I've had a bird I can't remember one I'll never oh and to this world it makes no difference [Music] when my name was written down Unworthy of his Mercy but still he paid my debt I've had a bird I can't remember and one I came prepared now it never made the paper it didn't make the evening news when I put down your mind and Christ put on the news and all of our sins were cast into the sea of the Saints as far as the yeast is from the West I happy birth I can't remember and one that I can't forget oh into this world it makes no difference some may even proud but the angels all rejoice when my name was written down so Unworthy of his Mercy keep it my death I've had a bird I can't remember and one I can't forget to this world it makes no difference some may even proud but the angels all rejoice when my name was Mercy but still he paid my debt I had a birth I can't remember and one I can't forget I've had a birth I can't remember and one I can't forget days amen hallelujah how can you forget it when you were so stipped in sin and oh my goodness amen and he comes by one day and just lends out a hand brother if you can forget that you need to go back and get rebirth forget that I don't remember me being born in in the natural sense I I wasn't there for it to be able to see it and how it works how it understands but when he comes and something changes the you from the inside out there's no way you can forget that amen I he's done something down on the inside Hallelujah Hallelujah you can't forget it wasn't on the marquee signs it wasn't in the papers it wasn't wrote In Time Magazine it wasn't in live magazine but it was in my heart it

knowing a Bible story that I was told in the Sunday school and I'm talking about a personal relationship where he come down and spake from lip to ear and you hear that voice on the inside that's what we need so if you need something now you can get it we don't serve a God that shows up just on Sunday morning and then he'll show up on Wednesday night but he shows up anytime you need him come on

without him brother Paul I don't understand how people don't know him I don't know how people can lay down at night and sleep brother Donnie I don't know this Jesus and again I'm not talking about knowing his name oh well Jesus knows my heart no I wouldn't put my soul on that does he really know you do you love him I like this song right here this and isn't I'm [Music] sure I don't think you got a paper for it Tony's fault [Music] Hosea you know that don't you believe Harry see I like this song well plead with your mother where the works of Hosea as his sin is children to extend this murder Mercy so they Journey down the old path and led to much destruction all while their loving arms were hurting in their hopes were crushed inside as their compassion was denied the woman they so loved seemed like a stranger for sin now Reign and hope sing on the changer be the world there was some slaves being sold and the Restless love sent home say he is seeking one by one they brought them in they were so beaten down with sin all within his chest his anxious heart was beaten all at once she called his eye from his lips all the bits were so high she could not believe the voice that she could hear oh but he threw judge but to take her life forever ended pain and strife watch what happened as she saw him Drawing Near her I've come to take you oh [Music] but for you I'll give my life through your sorrow your pain in your stripes I cannot let you go we gonna leave the past behind one more time he took her hand and said I've got a new day just ahead you know I've come to take you home foreign that same place Bound by sin a broken slave or from the depths of my despair I pray for Mercy I heard his word the price was paid on the cross for you that day and he said the seed of God was already in me all at once my conscience awoke I found out all the seals have been broke and I found my name revealed I've been that boy the veil fell down from my eyes all at once I looked inside and I saw the Mighty God as he was looking he said I've come to take you home said I know that you've done wrong but for you I gave my life for your sorrow your pain in your stripes I cannot let you go I'm Gonna Leave the Past Behind love conquered another time [Music] thank you oh he took my hand and said I've got a new day just ahead church I've come to take you home oh let's sing it now well I've come to take you home I'll sing in church said I know that you've done wrong [Music] but for you I gave my life to your sorrow your pain in your stripe I cannot let you go no no I'm gonna leave your past behind love conquered another time he took my hand and said I've got a new day you know I've come to take you home [Music] oh [Music] she's standing there she looks at Mary stairs and the Beards is getting higher here in the bed here in the bed here in the bin here oh my Satan come by Brother Harry and there in the garden where everything was fell there we know that it goes back to the rightful owner the abstract deed but Satan now Takes Over Control of the garden because of the sin the prophet of God said he goes by and he picks up all these you know it was in seed time of course at that time brother Harry and he goes down and he places them in in pawn shops and you're hanging there I don't know about y'all but I love pawn shops and one day Jesus comes in Brother Don he walks by and he says that looks just like mine he says where'd you get that somebody brought it in and sold it to me I just took it he walks on Down the Line he's going in and out of the aisles because when I go in them I walk down this way and I walk up this way and I walk every aisle just to see if there's anything I'm interested in Jesus just walks on down Brother Louie goodness there's Brother Louie he turns the corner and begins to come back and he says oh my goodness there's brother Donnie where did you get him somebody just come in and I took him he says they're mine well you've got to pay me I've done paid the price for him amen he had to pay it and he paid it back it before time ever came in order for it he paid it down Calvary for sure but it was already paid before that why because I was in his mind so he goes down the aisle and he pulls Harry off and he pulls Louie off and he pulls this one off and he pulls Tony off and he pulls this and he said I'm taking them with me because they're mine I imagine that's the way she felt today she's standing in the line she's being sold as a slave and then dare stands Hosea [Music] if I don't make you shout something's wrong Hallelujah this same Jesus I could preach oh God that's why I said John Calvin makes the statement if you can climb into that presence brother Harry as the songs are coming can you imagine Saul so down in the dump man he's having a hard time go get David and David comes up with that harp and he's gives a strum that harp and evil spirits begin to leave the devil hates that he can't stand it cause we're in here singing tonight he can't stand you think we're gonna get it we gonna put a hurting on him tonight but we are going to put a hurting on him in the morning listen friends let's open the door tonight so when the word comes forth in the morning the presence just Falls we should come through the doors with bells on our shoes dingling and down the aisles and worshiping in praise our brother Tim you're crazy well I may be crazy but it's still the truth I love to worship Him I love to praise him [Music] try a brother Harry you ain't got your papers my papers is all mixed up but I will say this if I I had somebody one time want to give me wanted me to give a testimony give my testimony and I have so many brother Harry that God's been so good to me I remember a long time and go in Ryan's Steakhouse brother you and some brothers were there and I gave a testimony but Donnie I can't talk I mean I I don't know where words need to go so I told him I said let me put something together and I'll sing you one how about that I can sing it better than I can talk it but I said that to say this if we singing and I just start boohoo and it just and we're going to do one tonight that is just it just tears me up just the words of it but we'll do this one right here I think y'all know this one that's why I don't like papers never know where I'm at [Music] foreign brother Brown said don't ever forget no matter how much you know how much you learn how good you can speak it don't ever forget it was Grace if it if if it wasn't for the cross it was his grace that made us who we are today and I don't mean we're just you know the lowest of the low is the highest you know he made us worthy Saints he did [Music] just an emblem a formalities symbol that's been used so frequently many blasphemy man despise though it's ancient it abides a shrine to death that stands for life to me there was a cross made for the son of God Calvary to pieces of rough Timber on here [Music] mansion He took the nerves for you and me Angels watched as he died for the law though he could have walked away he chose the cross see why this old emblem is so dear to me stood for suffering yet brought us peace it bridged the gap for me awkward cleansing for our sins and I can't that reminds us that we're free there was a cross made for the son of God a Calvary peace pieces of rough Timber on him through his feet he took the nails for you and me Angels watched as he died for the Lord Lord though he could have walked away he chose to cross [Music] God forbid that I should ever let my memory fade but forever keep the crossing View cause that's where I was foreign [Music] [Music] Angels watched as he died for the law s though he could have walked away he chose the cross so there was a cross before the Son of God a Calvary [Music] zebra Timber on here [Music] hands and through his feet he took the nails for you and me and me angels watched as he died lost though he could have walked away he chose the crow s though we could have walked away he chose the cross though we could have walked away chose the cross Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] oh thank God for the cross I'm so glad he didn't have to go twice he didn't have to go three times over with Donnie one time took care of every person of humanity it just didn't cover them just a lot of songs he wrote says oh he covered my sins oh my God the blood covered my oh no he didn't cover in French he removed them I told my church Sunday I think it was I said people says oh brother Tim come to the altar you know and and this is just in general Humanity I'm not worthy oh God I'm not worthy you're telling me that Calvary didn't make you Worthy the problem that we're doing brother Paul we're looking at flesh you can't expect to go up
