foundation to it so this song is for the ministers that preach the spoken order I have a 1-up hearing problem so when I was little I start I'll learn to read people's lips and I was way off and I don't know if I heard the man's voice but it was in my mind and I heard what he said and he had preached a message somewhere and they kind of made him you know like a hotdog preacher you could say you know they were so interested and so well off they ate steak but I believe their prophet said what you bring to this table tonight is what you're gonna take out of here and my god don't serve any baloney he's always serving steak I always eat steak here I've been here for two years and that's all lovey so this song is for my precious brothers especially Jackie Benton a gallant soldier out

able to live together in eternity all the gray hair will be gone glasses contacts no I feel worried about forgetting your pain meds there won't be none there will all be young forever won't that be wonderful friends that's not a dream that's a promise of God every day we live we're getting closer and closer to that promise Virgil had some wonderful service as long as it go appreciate that it always makes the pastor heart very very glad and rejoicing whenever the sheep are fed it's my responsibility to see the Sheep or fed whether I do it or not one Martin whenever I'm gone and I hear disparate fruits and that one and generally I'll get them back over and over again if you all enjoy them I don't hear very good comments I'm probably not going to get them back were often sorry just the way it is so preachers that don't get called back don't get mad at me because you're not a blessing after Valley we just don't go the other way here so if you want to come back feed them feed them good praise the Lord so we're happy to be be back tonight I got a little plea this week from someone who needed some financial assistance it was kind of a different type of request and what I normally get we get all types of requests for financial assistance from people overseas but this one was from my father and it was kind of twofold because he wanted me to announce his daughter's engagement to a young men here in the church and then he had an association with that that there would be a great debt incurred he felt like on his part so he wanted us to maybe consider lifting an offering for the poor the poor Oh dad sister le Garvin and brother Robert mcaren got engaged so both Charles is your face 14 shades of red you know so we want to congratulate them let's give my dear wife render them apparently before church so she sent me a text while I was sitting back in the office setting and said you ought to see her ring it is so beautiful I felt typical woman she said they want you to announce it tonight okay all right so I'd also like to announce that there's a wedding supper that's being planned all of you I hope are invited now I can't actually invite you the list was already made before the foundation of the world but I do believe I'm preaching to people who were pre invited don't you want to go listen to Matthew chapter 16 if you would tonight we'd like to look again at this little little thought on the church if the Lord will help us when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say thou are John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven also I say unto thee thou art little rock Petra and upon this big rock I will build my church which is not on Peter as we know and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it Hemme believes that then if you are part of that church there is nothing that Hale can do to destroy this break together how many I'd like to be remembered before the Lord tonight just raise your hand out many needs visible and those that are streaming as well Heavenly Father as we come into your presence tonight Lord we are such a they blessed people God I thank you for grace I thank you for your mercy I thank you for our church I thank you for a place that we can come to Lord and to be able to hear the word Lord I get texts and emails and phone calls from people all over this world that Lord the church situation and their home it's awful Lord many of them have to try to sort through this church and that church this one's off the word but they worship this ones more on the word but they're dead this one's got a double married preacher this one's got this and I think Lord Jesus how grateful we ought to be to be able to come to the house of God and hear the word preached and to watch you discern our very hearts our very thoughts you the word Lord that places you right among us I pray we would never take it for granted father I pray Heavenly Father this prayer cost that I have Lord the sister berry you see her need Lord Jesus they streamed the service no doubt our tonight I pray the presence of God would just go with this cloth we know Lord that this is scriptural we know that and father we are not Elijah nor Paul but you are still Jesus so as our preach tonight the anointing comes to anoint me I pray Heavenly Father would go with this cough as well these hands that rep lifted signify the need or request we pray to not that you'd meet them may you speak to us through the channel of your word tonight it's in the name of the word we ask the Lord Jesus and the Saints said god bless you since you may be seated let's read this verse 18 again and all I say also unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my ecclesia let's look at the meaning of the word assembly a gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some public place an assembly of Christians gathered for worship we've not gathered here tonight to see one another's clothes we've not gathered here tonight just to hear pretty singing nice music we've gathered for worship and this is also a house of Correction the literal meaning of church is a called out assembly the word is used 114 times in the New Testament 90 of these times refer to a local assembly the other times of course are referring to the ecclesia part which is the mystical body we know that we become the member of a church very easy you go to an assembly somewhere you're baptized in water by the pastor by one of the Deacons you say I want to put my name on the book they write your name down there give you the dues the don'ts the wherefore is the wise you become a member of that church now that's much easier to do than it is to become a member of the body of Christ because remember now when Jesus says this word there was no church as of yet now there was a tie or a symbol of the church in the Old Testament and we know that Israel represented that but there was no New Testament church as of yet so when they heard Jesus say this they would have thought something totally different than what you and I think as we came to church tonight no doubt you passed several buildings the sign out front said so-and-so church so-and-so church so-and-so church so-and-so Church so when you and I hear the word church we may not take it in a too complimentary way if someone tells us or calls us Church we almost become offended by because we prefer to be called bride but now remember in looking at it in the New Testament terms when you look at the ecclesia it's exactly the same thing but the bride is an advancement of what the church is so what is it all about position and relativity to the Godhead in the son of man it's the way that we relate to our position in Christ Jesus now remember that Jesus did not ask them who do people say I the son of David am or who did say I the Son of God am but who do they say i the son of man am now in this day most of our churches talk about him being the son of God no doubt many would talk about him being the son of David what sets us apart we identify him not only in those two positions but we cherish his position as son of a man why because this is a position that he chose to reveal himself again in the last day to the Gentiles and may I say your prophet said that he's chosen to identify himself in the body of his bride in the form of the Son of Man he said in my flesh and in yours praise the Lord so who do you say that the son of man is all about a rider brother Ram see you're off right there that's as far as your understanding has let you go about who the Son of Man is this is why many the message folks need a reappearing again of brother Branham in order to usher in the resurrection so they believe me to them believe that brother Branham will have a private resurrection first that he will raise from the dead first then he will call the resurrection I have a problem with that you know Paul did not say that they would be brother Branham brother Branham did not say it would be brother Ram [Applause] the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout Amen the Lord Himself not a prophet not a pastor not a church hates messenger but the Lord himself a man now because our relation to him is identified by a dispensational office and a dispensation of claim we must find our own claim upon him in order to tap into the power that lies in the revelation of the word by the revealing of his person it's now God chose to reveal himself in the churches of course in a sevenfold personage of his being that person is is selective of his own choice by which he has chosen to reveal himself he could not have made himself known in the days of loser in the same light that he's revealed now now you know that we just had the five hundredth year of the Reformation whenever Luther attacked this 95 theses up on the door of Wittenberg Germany and me of the Protestants have now rejoiced with him pass the church sign today that they were celebrating it was a Protestant Church and they were celebrating when Luther had done this but but the Tim Milan that sitting in article by Larry McGee some different brothers and they was going through looking on the Catholic Church and the Protestants had said well we've been able to come together and reach some sort of agreement and we've been able to move beyond these differences that we've had for 500 years are they still disagree of course on the Holy Eucharist they disagree on many many things that they found one principle that most of them can agree on and you know what it is the Trinity that's what they said they said that they all can agree on the Trinity once again you're the odd duck a man once again you are left out of their agreement now that cannot agree on communion they cannot agree on marry they cannot agree on intersection they cannot agree on many many things but they've been able after all of these years whenever loser protested and remember loser was as much a trinitarian when he came out of the Catholic Church as he was when he was in it he wants to try to change souls Wesley so as many of these men but the evening light of the Godhead of Christ was too reserved to the last day remember the soul of Solomon it was not three standing at the door knocking of his war that's exactly right John said he saw one on the throne and let me tell you something if there's another sitting on the throne he's sitting on the floor cuz John only saw one for all there's only one on the throne and God said in the Old Testament there is none other beside me if there is he said I am the first that's part of the revelation of his being in the last day you will never see your own place until first he you can see him properly in his part of the restoration of the entire message is to bring Christ to his position in order to bring you to your seeing Christ in his by the random in his and you and your show me somebody that does not see Christ in his place nine times out of ten by Dennis Lee brother Wrentham right I'm more than likely they don't see themself right but if you can see cross right first then see by the brand right then you're on the right road of success and to seeing yourself right why because that is God's order we live in the day when the evening Shyne don't you thank God for it now look Jesus is addressing the ecclesia the called out and he asked them who do men say well they say you're this out of the other all right now let me bring it on down who do you say that I have now Peter responds because of the revelation that God had dropped his heart remember the appearing of the Son of Man is always an identification of man of God blending together a son of man what does how sees I see a scroll Daniel son of man Jeremiah son of man so what was it deity on the earth in a form by which the people would be able to relay Jesus came on the earth and he identified himself over and over again as what son of man and you must reappear again in the last day as what son of man he revealed himself in the form of son of God which is baptism of the Holy Ghost but the fullness of the attribute of God wants to return in the last days you see Luther could still remain the Trinitarian smoke a pipe and drink a little bit of beer on the side typical German in the 15th 16th century well she could be able to do this add the other Pentecostals could shout the shoe heels all baptized and Titus and believe in three gods but you won't be able to do it because the light shining brighter and is shining brighter about what the Holy Roman Catholic Church no this is shining brighter but Reformation or it's shining bright about the person of the Lord Jesus then we should not be amazed that the devil the very devil that the Spirit of God struck against by the prophet of God will try to come right back around at this message and Rob the deity away from Jesus Christ by message preachers an idiom born-again their self all friends I've said it for years and years and I'm going to keep on saying it one of the reason we've got so many errors and so many false Saints in this church the church around the message is because we got preachers send it behind the pulpit but they ain't born again what are you doing to preach with me we got preachers standing in the pulpit that are not born again they're not filled with the Holy Ghost they need not them but just converting Lutheran's or Methodists or Church of Christ but if we can get some of these matches preachers really born again you talking about breaking up revival you're talking about having the Word of God come and stir our soul but it's got to begin with the preacher himself oh my how and where did I get off from there now what's this in the Laodicean Church age book now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the creates or creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last stage when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as also of this new creation of God his sovereign power brought it to pass oh you say brother Donny I made up my mind baloney you never done no such a thing I don't care who it is from a prophet to a pastor down to a wash woman there ain't none of us got enough strength to be able to make up our mind over the powers of this day friends we are leaving living in a day when darkness is around us everywhere you heard it this week a man stepping into a church in killing 26 people that same thing else around everywhere why because the darkness is breaking through and you do not have power within ourselves to withstand hail that's breaking out don't you understand the tribulation is so close to coming the path the corridors of hell empty now in the realms of mortality and darkness and death and purification is spilling out from the very gates of hell that is not established by man she is not established by the ideology of some seminary who somewhere but she is the Church of the Living God still by Jesus Christ himself let me tell you right now if I built this church this church will fall if brother templar builds his churches no thought but if jesus built this show and loud menu to be part of it during and up gates in hell i sat down enough gates in hell to stop it by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation [Applause] he predestinated them to the adoption of truth according to the good pleasure of their will whose will never members quoting scripture his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his brethren if he did not make sure well I hope somebody feel sorry for me I'm going to go to theirs and I'm gonna die and I'm gonna go to the cross and I'm gonna bleed and I'm gonna suffer and I'm gonna have the preachers to preach a Sunday after Sunday after Sunday after Sunday and maybe they can plead and make people feel sorry for me nonsense he come to the earth to seek and save that which was lost he ain't got one extra fee often II he's not gonna had to create a theophany because somebody will show up that he didn't know would be there you ain't gonna wind up there and say Lord where's my C - oh then I didn't know yours coming hey I'm sorry about that oh they shift they often I didn't realize just come hey before he had you you was already invited that was sad before you became a turtle on the earth Lauren what's this hey man all things he knew all things he worked out according to what he knew and ordered that his purpose and good pleasure would be brought to pass if he's in so Levantine whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will hallelujah aren't you glad that you belong to him praise God aren't you glad you belong there now what's this back to what jesus said in matthew 16 also I say unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against the gates and the Bible represent Authority and power the city gate to a Jew was what the courthouse would be to us today now on to renew manacles tag on her car yesterday so where'd I go courthouse went to pay taxes our house where'd I go courthouse I want to make some sort of legal transaction but they didn't have a courthouse so they met in the gates so the gates are a place of business a place of transaction where deeds are traded out I want to buy this property I want to marry this woman and notice what Jesus said now not the windows of hell not the doors of hell not the laws of Hell but the gates [Applause] he knew won't even say important business was transacted at the gate notice Deuteronomy chapter 21 verse 19 then shall the father and his mother and that this is dealing with a rebellious son lay hold on him and bring him out to the elders of the city unto the place of his the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of this city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he's a glutton and a drunkard well it's a good thing we don't do this today o world we bury them all it's a good thing we don't do it in the church because I'm not sure where we buried all the dead church folks either now notice so if you had a stubborn son and he would not obey you then you would bring that son before work not a judge not a tribunal they had to send Hedren which was the judge in court but they would bring him to where was the Sanhedrin at the gate so the gate is the place of authority the gate is a place of judgment the gate is the place where transactions are verified and Jesus said just so he'll will know my church will be built so strong that the gates of hell and all of her business and all of Hale's transaction and all those property and all of Hale's business deals will not be able to defeat my church dinner on the 22:13 if any man take a wife and go into her and hate her and give occasions a speech against her I'm bringing up an evil name upon her and say I took this la woman I came to her I found her not a maid then shall the father the damsel another taken bring forth the tokens of the dams of virginity unto the elders of the city and the gate so you're accusing or beyond pure you are accusing her with laying with someone else worse or his instance proven that's a gate you see Jesus hadn't even gone down and took them gates yet but he knew his fixing this growing a God better daily hasn't even time and raised from the dead that he said let me just professor I'm fixin to take these gates I won't be like Samson well just take him up on my back and take him up on the hill on the rock of his hump but I will destroy their power against my church all the Blessed should be the Lord second Samuel chapter 19 verse 8 then the King rose and said in the gate and they told unto all the people saying behold the King does sit in the cage and all the people came before the king for Israel had fed every man to his tent so the gate was a sign of significant power and authority so the king went well not to the courthouse not to the recorder of deeds and records but he went to the gate so did our king go to the gates [Music] Ruth chapter 4 verse 1 then when those up to the gate praise be to God then when Boehm's up to the gate and set him down there and behold the kinsman of whom ballasts fake came by unto whom he said ho ho such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down verse 11 and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses now this is after he's bought ruth-marie the Lord make the woman that is common to thy house like a man Rachel and like Leah which ii did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in Ephrata and be a famous in bethlehem where was it comes maybe where was it saddled in the gate now jesus said on this rock I will build my church and the gates of hail this word here hail is actually Hades not Gehenna and those three words in the New Testament used Sheol Hades and Gehenna but here Jesus says Hades not she'll not Gehenna which is fired but simply the realm of the Dead the gates of Hades not of torment but it will be Hades that will come against my church why the gates of torments wasted their time for trial yet don't you understand if you're sealed in the presence of God by the Holy Ghost there ain't no need for the gates of fire to try to get you so what they'll try to get you these gates of Hades both natural and spiritual death the unseen counterpart of the visible grave not what is she'll she'll is the grave Hades is the unseen counterpart the invisible which answers back to the visible so when we take a person's body and we bury that body in the ground we place them in Sheol Jesus didn't say the gates of seal will come against my people but the gates of Hades the realm of the Dead don't you understand when Satan tries to get us to commit adultery against the Word of God it's the gates of Hill don't you understand when preachers or lay or to you whoever it is tries to corrupt the Word of God and hybridize the Word of God and get us to mix something else up with the word that'll cause a hybridize death don't you know what it is it's the gates of Hades hell is vomiting out remember when the Prophet said there he said that I was in JCPenney's sore back inhale again do you understand the invisible realm of Hades is all around us friends trying to kill you trying to kill me mama notice that so it is the all destructive Oh devouring part that every Mortal goes to Satan feels confident no one can defy death because every mortal must die so Jesus says no not really [Applause] now remember Hades leads to the prison of the souls of course that was imprisoned once they leave this realm of mortality so it also let's look at in this small form that it symbolizes the orchestrated organized satanic power by which the business of the outlets of Satan is able to be administered through the gates so if your sanding or the gaiter jerusem and as MO as was he wanted to be able to take Bruce to meet us why he wanted to purchase now on his property so he sets and he waits waits and he waits and when he sees the near kinsman the devil walked through just happens so on your snick skin - now no wonder some of us is something look at our family Trevor's came to the devil I could explain why somebody else Ilsa mean oh sorry sorry sorry but you see whenever he said I said how because we'd say hey but they said home so he said home oh you ah here they say the next of Kin's men and you know about now missus I've heard about it and she has this so dire and oh yes I've heard about tell you said well you're the closest of kin if you want to take a redeem it for yourself and said who is she says a Gentile yes sir oh no ed Mar my inheritance don't take speaking tongues don't they believe shopping and jumping around and carrying on and tell you them the ones that go to church of my goodness is not like a football game or baseball game they rally and Chum shouting holler praise the Lord I ain't they the ones that get all you know all religious and all that sort of thing they crab and they read the word they get all happy that'll go to just set down and go to sleep in church and say oh my such a people that definitely my my inheritance well he said if you don't water I'll take her now she's a Gentile she's a gold she worshipped ki mosh she got all this and that and the other I agree the outside he was totally guilty but you don't see what I see when I'm looking inside that soul well you don't see me what I see it's filled with the Holy Ghost well you don't see what I see it's a name on my board that's why I am the son of man and that's why I look Oh Satan you see their party its weak and weary and low you look upon the flesh and you ought to know but you don't see what I see when I look at my bag I see the bride and Morningstar reflected [Applause] Wow where'd that come from [Applause] so Jesus says just to let you know guys before I even build my church Mitchell let you in a little insight I'm fixing the storm the gates it won't be me and Gabriel it won't be me and wormwood won't be man Donny man down man Terry for he alone tread the winepress of the wrath of God I'm fixing a store in Hades I'm fixing a going to shield I'm fixing they're going together I'm fixing than going to all of Satan's trying to say I'm gonna defeat him in all three realms and I'm gonna conquer the gates and I'm gonna snatch the keys off his side I'm gonna walk up I'm gonna kick the door so hard everything on the wall it's gonna shut down and I'm fixing to go over and open up the six dimensional worry for him the fifth and I'm gonna let him come out Abraham on Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and Daniel and cheering mind self-aligned Zechariah obsession to leave my people out of the gates of hell [Applause] so here comes the stormtroopers and he delivered the catfish out of her gates [Applause] let me tell you something friend he is so powerful he didn't need an army if you honestly think he needs you to overcome you need to scratch your head and realize who you are he don't need you in the Millenium to come in and conquer he could do this whole thing by himself he's letting you go along for the ride he don't need me to conquer he don't need you to conquer he's letting us go along with him and Barry's glory [Applause] you imagine Satan in this month thinking fun but start a church start one but every one of them leaders will die I'll wind up getting them all so you made Peter special John special a new special fine they'll live their life they'll get old and they'll die inevitably she'll I'll get them and then what will happen to your church but you see he put a clause in this every age is firstborn generation [Applause] hopeless don't bother you tonight I believe I've got the same Holy Ghost reader head i baptize so what he did I preached what he did hope it's don't offend I actually appreciate a more understanding of what he had 2,000 years ago and so do you brothers here because of God's grace I say that but listen I could have stood up I could have been that in the upper room brother doubt it could have been me and you and you said sure tonight I'm gonna shut up that day and say men and brother you've got to repent and be baptized why I'm part of that same body I've got the same Holy Ghost I'm the same identified Christian as they were I'm not third generation fourth generation 500th generation I am the firstborn I belong to the tracks on the firstborn - did not destroy it [Applause] look at all Robertson his ministry and what he done no doubt a man helped a lot of people look at his son what happened now but his son gets old and dies who take it from better look up in the graph look at his side look a better plan look at his sons can they do what he did or not call to praise the Lord now we don't say that to run them down none of them that I just mentioned but it does not come by blood it comes by the blood of God not Branham blood greenberg Roberts blood Reagan blood it comes by the blood of God you've got to be born again well praise the Lord [Applause] imagine Satan saying all human travelers eventually and at this time remember paradise had not been cleared up yet they imagine him saying and words Abraham would you mind telling me where Jacob is tonight Maddie preacher and was just what about Hagar what about Malachi what about all the seed of Abraham where are they in my gates but Jesus could just kind of smile though that lot brother Darrell just smiled at me right there he can smile at the devil not say a word just kind of smile because he knew what the future held so he could go ahead and say it oh yes you all will live and you will die as mortals and your family will carry over the grave and then another generational pass and another generational pass but this is not the same thing as a natural kingdom this is a mystical kingdom called the church and I will have people in every day God has had somebody in every age that would stand for the truth this age will go old friends he will not let this age pass but not only having one or two he's gonna have thousands times thousands the disciples standing right there were dying men and dying mortal bodies so Satan could say no problem I'll wait my turn look at us look at what I look like thirty years ago when I come here look what you often turn to me we could turn around the other way look what I've done to you so Satan could make his bride go ahead do whatever you want to do eventually Center or suit prophet or sage they all go through my gates after gays now Jesus can't say too much right here in Matthew 16 cuz he died yet and they don't want to let the whole seventh seal I mean the whole program of God you know be outright plain where the devil can read it like a newspaper but he can go ahead and prophesy and say on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it let me just say it Satan has emptied his quiver Satan has shot Hobie shells he said he'd ever cannon he's got and the church is still marching [Applause] he tried to burn him he tried to stand the deck he tried to drown them he tried to shut him up he thrown up in jail he does everything he knew to do and in spite of everything he does they get stronger and stronger and stronger why Jesus said so the church's security is not just going to be based upon the longevity of these men the perpetuity of Peters preaching the perpetuity of James the longevity of Paul then heaven of if they will die but the church hold if the Lord tarries had a few years under my age eventually I'll pass and you'll have to get somebody else to be your pastor but will the real church darling I'd die if you do you are nothing but a South's down the wolf Reaganite brother down there here I can't make it off shame you ought to be ashamed of yourself you only don't want to be no Regan I do want to be a Christian hey brother there goes good fun people burn better Brandon went on to say they will go no no it'll be the end of the message guess again this message has been taken the corners of the earth that brother branham was never even allowed to go why the longevity of the message is not based upon the human messenger it's not based upon just the human preachers Jesus built this church so the gates are the place of strength place traditionary judgment the place of arms final word so you take the gates you control the city now you actually don't have to brake for that through eight-foot walls and you know knock down every wall you get two gates you've got the whole thing [Applause] hallelujah if you can pass through them gates all glory to God can you imagine old friend I imagine Satan must have got so mad at himself and so mad at his demons once he realized what has happened on Calvary oh I'd love to been down in hell just a few minutes after Jesus to die ghosts of the door and opens the door ha there you are I thought I'd got you when I got Abel in that amazing he thought he got him when they got Abel I thought I got you and I got Moses I thought I got you he was looking for God to become a man that's the third dad and you're the third man rather of Genesis 3 that man that God prophesied will bruise the Serpent's head it was the one that he kept looking for I said yes but now I'm here my blood is still hot on Calvary give me the keys give me the case praise God the blood of a bull and the goat was not strong enough to open up and clear the dimensions her Abraham would be able to release it going under the altar of God so when he died and he slept with his fathers and they burned his body his soul went down into paradise Jacob died that buried his body soul was covered with his father where paradise not in heavenly bliss not in bluegrass not in the sixth dimension in paradise once you're glad you're married to the Paradise Cynthia if he can enter paradise he can empty you all the hell that bothers you if he can empty out paradise he can into you of all your fears and your complexes go blessed be the Lord they long for David said he will not leave my soul in hell LLL not allow his Holy One to see corruption or leave my soul and hell no doubt the men didn't even know what he was saying his soul and shield but it was prophetic the Garber said I will come down myself I'll divide myself on the cross I'll let it wash you manatee die in the form of sonship but not the Alpha Nico parents I will appear and take the gates Oh glory to God I will appear in hell and I will take the power of the gates [Applause] Jesus secures his church against all men all movements all systems who gets their authority from the gates of hell [Music] the Sydenham II every movement that gets its authority from the gates of Hell against God's church Jesus said I will give you power over them people that set out to destroy you and claim to be Christians he let cannot persecute elect people got in the heart to destroy you to destroy me to destroy the saints of God

let's talk about the price of rice in China the self it runs at all the devil I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican the head of your party is the devil himself well praise the Lord there may be a few good people in there which would be a miracle the Lord Jesus does not say now I'm fixing to go down in the gates of Hell and I'm gonna nollie them but he simply says they'll not destroy you they will not prevail against you they will meet in the gates of Hades or another separator scheme now back in the 50s we had a love Lucifer I mean hallelu see and now we had the Beatles of the

follow certain more clouds and says dollar says old sand when paradise gates open up and Abraham come out and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph then they come up changing dimensions going up then the voices started screaming out lift up your everlasting gates and being lifted up and some voices from the inside they said the king of Gore's come and said who is the king of glory what did they do they knew who he was so they could answer for him Lord God have mercy don't you see those gates are fixing to open again if they ask I want to be able to answer who is he I don't say well he's the second person the third persons father's right head ain't got no Angels in the end I want to be able answer he's the king he say I am he's the fair signalized that'll be the password I know the girl at near the gates of paradise the gates can you imagine one of these mornings the gates of Hades he always vomited she's vomiting her faith on the earth and the gates are moving closer to you you and me our church and we'll walk right out of these gates one morning those great old big pearly ones or swim a lot help praise be to God glory Bittaker why because jesus said so don't you love him praise God he looked down through these ages they saw the darkness he saw them deaths on the cross the crucifixes he saw up near over do he saw that Nero would have some of our brothers and sisters wrapped up in muslin type cloths and he would have pitch poured on their bodies and he wanted to walk in his garden his palace garden at night so he would have them Christians lined up say this was the garden path right here he would have to Christians to Christians to Christians to Christians but the lawyer what he wanted to take a walk a stroll in the night in the garden past they would wrap up in Christians in this material poor pitch on the material and that set him on fire as human torches to me it is a reflection of what the gates of Hell saw in these believers they couldn't get their souls and fire close as they could get lose their bodies that already been lit by the pillar of fire and Satan is mimicking or making fun of them and ending their life all we take God's our healer God said old friend we don't know how we'll leave this world some of us may leave racked with pain with cancer or some car wreck this or that another don't you understand why whenever he's allowed to do that is allowed to do that to you it's to mark and mimic your testimony which proves it could never get you he hated you to the very end he's god that's a kind of believer I want to be don't you it's power hence again if you had praise of God Oh Heavenly Father we are so glad to be a part of this church tonight when I say that I don't mean just so much happy Valley but Lord a part of this mystical church this church that you built difference of these people here Lord told me of the beginning of this church happy valid started at Rome Hill or something like that I think they've told me and some of their fathers and grandfathers that started years ago as at Pentecostal church and then they tore down a building and about some of that material here and built it here then it was introduced into the message Lord many of them worked on it no doubt that laboring to it as far as building it the father we know you're the only one that can really build that true church Oh hallelujah you said upon this rock I will build my church and the administration the authority the dispensation said from the gates will not prevail against it praise God Satan emptied all of his cannons he emptied everything against that early church you could never destroy it second church age third force my thought he had it when it down into total darkness for hundreds of years under Catholicism but you got a hole to the little German priest a restlessness that had been on his soul for many many years he would beat himself he would pray agonizing trying to find peace with God one day while reading the book of Romans you click and it to his heart the just shall live by faith it probably caused a little rattle on the outer hinge on maybe the right-hand side of the gate of Hell Satan probably sent one of his demons over there with a little spiritual wd-40 it's kind of all that gate and say I am a little rattled maybe over there ain't nothing happened on the earth for hundreds of years now little did the devil know you were just set a man on fire praise God the gates of hell would be shook you've done it over and over again Lord in this day when a little baby was born glory to God and an angel signified his birth supernatural started following him imagine the gates was it real alert when he started telling people their names their addresses even that their dr. Ward tortoiseshell glasses I imagine the gate started shaken and rattled his worse than Elvis Presley oh ma I can just think in my mind in 1965 that prophet passed away they thought this is the end the message ends right here without him being here it was never gone immediately men started vying for positions of he ordained me he called my name on tape so many times I was this Saturday October pretty Jessica I was saying that help they'll kill theirselves she made it through the 60s she made it through the sadness Bluebird to God no doubt Lau these people that were saying thought the Hades I'll never see it they didn't know my name was on the book let him know the rapture couldn't take place Maya we made it to the eighties we made it to the 90s oh we never thought 2000 come now we passed it and we're still running in fine course we made it to the here I stand well he made it to the believer sign we made it through all the rest of it and the church is still said Satan is offered this administrative ID and this administrative idea and the gates of Hell have gathered over this message more than any message that's ever been on the earth glory to God we have calls more conferences than any other message on the earth because the person of the truth is back on the earth again hallelujah but the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is broad thank you Lord Jesus our own lives our own homes our marriages maybe our church we've been through so much like our brothers around the world Lord God and now it comes to my heart and Russia father's the government just intercepted some books started looking at him now Lord gonna have a hearing just in a few days and the preliminary look at it is that this message must be banned from Russia and if so Lord our brothers and sisters their churches will be confiscated the property will be taken become property of the government we pray for your mercy O God we pray for your mercy you who can move on Nebuchadnezzar may you move on the authorities their Lord God I pray Heavenly Father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray dear God the gates of hell has determined time and again to try to destroy but it cannot Lord and then we know Lord if the hours arrived that you would allow to be so than it means that the rapture is closer than what we thought so your will be done father help us our praise Lord may be right here tonight in our myths Lord and those that are streaming an administrative power from the gates of Hell has been sent to afflict a scene in their body the Lord may be in their home may be a decision Lord may be it's a mother having to try to make a decision about her agent mother and whether she should try to put her in a home or not or what she should do and she's feeling told back and forth as far as what to do oh mighty God may peace from the gates of Shalom enter into that mother's heart Oh hallo glory to God Oh best should be the name of our God hallelujah Lord I think of a couple of years ago when one of our sisters from over in England was facing such a dilemma and you had me Lord to pray a similar prayer even confounded me why even said it but the sister was praying about what she should do you spoke to the sisters heart through the prayer Lord Lord God we still believe you're the kings and hiked by the Randleman here Lord there's no profit here to be able to discern our thoughts but the mighty God is here or Jesus may be cycnus come against a home Lord God a child whatever heals all our Jesus we call upon the conquer of the gates hallelujah may you send forth your administrative power to break the hold of the gates of hell thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Oh blessed be the name of God hallelujah hallelujah for it will be in the face of the gates of hell that you testify of our tokens of our virginity glory to God for in the very gates of hell one morning you will change our bodies Satanists accused us these ponies finger at us and said we're not worthy but it'll be right there and the gates the very same place that boy asphalt Ruth it'll be the very same place that the testimony will come back it's proven she's innocent because she's gone in the rapture she is no more because she had this testimony she please God hallelujah glory to God you will throw it right back in the face of the gates of Hell you will change our bodies thank you Lord Jesus Oh blessed be the name of the Lord all children don't you just sense his presence whatever you meet and hide whatever whatever powers been released against you your wife your children maybe your business your home your mind whatever it is may the Spirit of God bring an answer to you as it did to Daniel that day they don't mean no one their conflict they don't mean the home be a war oh my god send whatever forces he needs to send to bring your ends please be to God Lord Jesus we worship you tonight I don't know great mighty God we're glad we know who you are to my father we're not praying to a little boy he left to look over to his older father and ask him if it's okay if he answers this prayer you are the father Philip have I been so long time with you and you haven't known who I am when you've seen me you've seen the Prophet comes and captures that and says when you see the word manifested you have seen the father God praise be to God baby to God that he comes as freeport and tells us the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight father oh I know it may seem similar the church calls the name of Jesus and the church calls the name of Jesus and people that don't know any different think that what's the difference these people call the name of Jesus they live this way dress this way do this and in the other they drink and do whatever more and yet these other people they look different they act different they believe strange doctrines and yet they called the name of Jesus as well but we're calling the name from the manifestation of the interpretation of that name in our lives we're not just repeating the name of Jesus is some magical connotation this is not a magical ritual it is he and us order to God it is him than us believing his own word against all circumstances that the Prophet said we doubt her doubts glory to God his faith in us we do not doubt his word we doubt our doubts so if we're gonna
