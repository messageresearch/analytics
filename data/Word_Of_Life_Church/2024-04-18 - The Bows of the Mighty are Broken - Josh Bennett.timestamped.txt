[10:09] amen we only have uh one prayer request
[10:12] so if you'll stand with me I was
[10:14] thinking about it today the first time I
[10:16] ever LED songs was at a youth service at
[10:19] the old church granted all the parents
[10:23] weren't there there's probably like 40
[10:25] young people there and my platform was
[10:28] uh looked a little different uh but kind
[10:32] of brings back old memories of how
[10:33] things used to be and where I was and I
[10:36] was had kind of given a testimony to a
[10:39] buddy of mine about my life and where I
[10:43] was and I remember when I was a young
[10:46] person it's like I had a little Bott of
[10:47] lighter fluid and I just spray the holy
[10:50] my Holy Ghost out and light it and I was
[10:52] good I was like
[10:54] quick and then it just go away come to
[10:57] church spray it again light it
[11:00] on fire every time and then one day my
[11:02] lighter fluid ran out and I didn't have
[11:04] nothing
[11:07] there then a year ago somebody put a
[11:10] piece of wood
[11:11] down they put that lighter fluid on that
[11:13] piece of wood and lit it then they put
[11:16] another piece of wood on it guy put
[11:19] another piece of wood on it I don't have
[11:21] that hot flash of fire no more I got
[11:23] something that's burning inside of me
[11:25] that's running and it won't never run
[11:26] out
[11:29] there ain't nothing that could ever make
[11:30] that fire burn out every now and then
[11:33] y'all the young people can come in here
[11:35] and y'all will light up every fire in
[11:36] this church y'all don't know how
[11:38] important you are you don't I didn't
[11:42] because I just thought well I'm just a
[11:44] young person I don't mean I don't amount
[11:47] to nothing I am a young person people
[11:50] know I'm going to mess up and they oh
[11:52] poor Justin poor we're just GNA have to
[11:54] pray for him but then I wasn't a young
[11:58] person no more and I was an adult who
[12:01] made continued to make mistakes and
[12:02] didn't have no
[12:07] nothing then one
[12:10] day I was snatched unbeknown to me un
[12:15] not really wanting to be snatched I was
[12:18] fine I
[12:20] thought then I was snatched up brought
[12:24] right
[12:26] there I don't know if he's in here my
[12:29] buddy
[12:30] Jordan he I remember I got right there

[12:35] a crier anyway but my buddy Jordan
[12:37] prayed with me and he grabbed me by the
[12:39] back of the neck and I was like in I was
[12:41] just crying and he said tonight's the
[12:44] night maybe somebody in here tonight is

[30:47] and he said did you ever have a major
[30:49] injury to your leg and I said no sir he
[30:50] said well your left leg is drastically
[30:52] longer than your right
[30:54] leg and I said that could be why I'm
[30:57] hurting
[30:59] and I told him this doctor probably
[31:01] didn't even know this and I said well
[31:03] last night me and the devil had a little
[31:05] Pow Wow over in the corner of the church
[31:07] and he left battered and bruised and I
[31:10] couldn't hardly walk so I don't know who

[44:28] [Applause]
[44:47] praise the Lord how wonderful it is for
[44:49] us to be gathered together here tonight
[44:52] want to thank each of you for coming
[44:54] putting forth the effort to be here um
[44:57] we're so grateful for all that has been
[45:00] done to make a make this a special time
[45:03] for the Youth and so appreciate all the
[45:06] work that's going on in the background
[45:07] all of our sisters getting everything
[45:09] ready for the banquet and food
[45:11] preparation and all that sort of thing
[45:14] the ministers that have put forth the
[45:16] effort to study and pray don't we
[45:18] appreciate that with all of our hearts
[45:21] so grateful
[45:30] I appreciate Servants of God that don't
[45:32] um cut a corner just because they're
[45:35] preaching a youth service that they give
[45:37] everything they are to the youths just
[45:41] like they would if it was all adults or
[45:43] if it's a big crowd medium-sized crowd
[45:46] large crowd a real servant of God gives
[45:49] their all it makes no difference how
[45:51] many is there if the Lord Jesus could go
[45:54] to one woman at the well then I don't
[45:56] figure any of us should be too big that
[45:58] we
[45:59] can't so brother Josh did a wonderful
[46:01] job last night and we're going to invite
[46:03] him to come now and just bring to us
[46:05] what the Lord has placed on his heart
[46:08] for us I'm sure you have needs tonight
[46:10] don't you things that you need in your
[46:12] walk with the Lord and we're just
[46:14] believing that God's going to take our
[46:16] brother get him out of the way and
[46:18] remember now a gift is something that
[46:20] God places in an individual's life and
[46:23] it helps them to be able to step aside
[46:26] and let God be able to use that part of
[46:29] himself that he puts in there but it's
[46:32] not operated just by the preacher the
[46:34] preacher studies and he prays and he
[46:36] tries to put it all together as best as
[46:38] he can but it takes the spirit of God to
[46:40] help him and it also takes you it takes
[46:43] you
[46:44] pulling and if you go preach many times
[46:47] I've done it these other Brethren here
[46:50] have as well and the people don't pull
[46:52] and pull oh it's so disappointing and
[46:55] God gives it to you in such a way and
[46:58] the people don't do their part and it
[47:00] just doesn't go over like you know that
[47:03] it could have but we don't want that to
[47:05] be so do we we want it to be that it'll
[47:08] just be above and
[47:10] beyond amen God bless you so I think
[47:13] it's such an important thing for us as
[47:16] as the people of God to be able to
[47:18] realize we we pull now remember a
[47:20] preacher will get a certain thought and
[47:22] God will give him that thought he go to
[47:24] building on that thought working on it
[47:26] working on it it and there'll be always
[47:29] Sidelines there'll be a little Direction
[47:30] this way and one that way and one that
[47:32] way and a real spirit-led man what he
[47:35] will do is he will go down this Lane for
[47:38] just a few minutes if it's no more than
[47:39] two three minutes do you know why he
[47:41] done that because somebody here or there
[47:44] or somebody streaming the service really
[47:47] needed that to be said and that's the
[47:49] kind of man we want to preach to us is
[47:51] it that's right so you remember you pull
[47:54] on the gift of God oh you sound nobody
[47:56] you should should never say that you are
[47:58] somebody you're a part of the body of
[48:01] Christ so if our brother studied in a
[48:03] certain direction tonight and maybe your
[48:05] need lays outside the confines of what
[48:08] he studied just remember the heavenly
[48:11] father can put on his heart and pull him
[48:15] in a direction and he's standing here in
[48:18] bewilderment he cannot understand why
[48:21] he's going down that path sister Rebecca
[48:24] Smith told Carol and I One Time there
[48:27] was a person in brother bram's meeting
[48:29] that had a real need and she was just so
[48:32] touched by that person's need and she
[48:36] began to pray that God would speak
[48:39] through her daddy to that individual's
[48:42] need and God answered her prayer and
[48:45] directed The Prophet to go right toward
[48:48] that person's need tell them you know
[48:50] whatever it was that they was dealing
[48:51] with now here was a a young woman a
[48:54] teenager at the time but God so heard
[48:57] her prayer and she was so concerned and
[49:01] God was concerned about that so maybe
[49:04] you're doing pretty good tonight but
[49:06] maybe you've got a friend that you
[49:07] brought with you or someone that you've
[49:09] talked to even if you've come this way
[49:11] today and you've talked about some of
[49:13] the things you're going through and you
[49:15] just said I need answers I need help
[49:17] well maybe you don't need it tonight but
[49:19] maybe you can pray for that individual
[49:23] and God will direct our brother I
[49:24] believe we're serving that kind of a god
[49:27] don't you amen Justin come saying
[49:30] something for us let's just open our
[49:31] hearts and want ask our brother to come
[49:34] and we've just told him just obey the
[49:35] Lord whatever he feels l in his heart to
[49:37] do if he wants to preach pray for the
[49:39] sick uh offer prayer after the the word
[49:42] has come just whatever we've just come
[49:44] here we've said as y'all ain't got
[49:46] nothing else seem more important to do
[49:47] do you come to the house of God and just
[49:50] see what the Lord will do with us we
[49:51] don't want just this to be another
[49:53] another service we want it to be a
[49:55] monumental
[49:57] visitation of the presence of God God
[50:01] bless
[50:05] you where would I
[50:09] be you only

[53:08] it this way he said I am what I am amen
[53:11] by the grace of God Amen and I believe
[53:13] that we can all say the same thing
[53:16] tonight and and you know I think it's
[53:18] amazing that the Apostle Paul would say
[53:21] he said the life that I now live I live
[53:25] by the faith of the Son of
[53:27] God Amen I I'm thankful that the life
[53:32] that I Live Now is not um it's not it's

[55:14] Lord because if there's one thing that
[55:16] we desire is that we would lift you up
[55:19] Lord and Lord may this service be like
[55:22] it was on the Mount of transfiguration
[55:25] there Lord when they saw you
[55:28] glorified and Lord Peter got excited and
[55:33] perhaps in his Zeal Lord and his
[55:35] excitement he said let's build a
[55:37] tabernacle for Moses and one for Elijah
[55:40] but Lord when it was all said and done
[55:42] and after the voice had spoke they saw
[55:44] no man saved Christ and Lord that's what
[55:48] we want to have here tonight Lord when
[55:50] it's all said and done Lord I pray that
[55:53] that we would see no man save Jesus
[55:55] Christ
[55:57] and Lord may you be lifted up and Lord
[56:00] we just put you in the highest place
[56:01] tonight Lord we're just Lord we're just
[56:05] surrendering oursel completely now Lord
[56:08] we give it to you in Jesus name amen
[56:12] amen if you take your Bibles this
[56:14] evening we'll turn to the book of 1
[56:18] Samuel just want
[56:24] to I just want to say uh what a
[56:28] privilege it is once again to be here
[56:31] and U to be a part of these services and
[56:34] appreciate your pastor and um his wife
[56:38] and the church here and the um
[56:41] hospitality and we so we just love each
[56:43] one of you um always um you know I look
[56:47] around sometimes at other ministers and
[56:49] and there's some great ministers here
[56:51] tonight but uh and I always wonder what
[56:54] in the world am I doing here
[56:56] but uh we just pray that the Lord will
[56:58] be able to use us and say something
[57:00] that' be a blessing to somebody and you
[57:03] know a long time a brother told me a
[57:05] long time ago a brother told me he said
[57:07] I was just a young man and just started
[57:10] preaching and hadn't been preaching very
[57:12] long and a brother kind of pulled me to
[57:15] the side and he said brother Josh he
[57:16] said I want to share something with you
[57:19] he said there's a difference in
[57:20] preaching and ministering and he
[57:24] said you need to uh always keep that
[57:26] before you that you're not just there to
[57:28] preach A good sermon but you're there to
[57:31] minister to needs right and um I I I
[57:35] pray that you know I I will always keep
[57:38] that before me and and like brother
[57:40] Donnie said even if if God has to take
[57:43] me off my notes tonight and when I get
[57:44] done and I feel like I made a mess out
[57:46] of it if somebody could be helped then
[57:49] that's what it's really all about amen
[57:52] so 1st Samuel chapter 2 and let's read
[57:56] from the first verse
[57:58] here it's kind of perhaps an odd text
[58:02] but um this is actually Hannah's Prayer
[58:07] of Thanksgiving to God for answering her
[58:10] prayer and giving her a son the Bible
[58:13] says and Hannah prayed and said my heart
[58:15] rejoiceth in the Lord my horn is exalted
[58:19] in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over my
[58:23] enemies because I rejoice in thy
[58:27] salvation there is none holy as the Lord
[58:30] for there is none beside thee neither is
[58:33] there any Rock like our God talk no more
[58:38] so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy
[58:41] come out of your mouth for the Lord is a
[58:45] god of
[58:46] knowledge and by him actions are
[58:49] weighed the bows of the mighty men are
[58:53] broken and they that stumbleth are
[58:56] girded with
[58:58] strength I also want to read from the
[59:00] book of 2 Corinthians the 12th
[59:03] chapter SE 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and
[59:06] we'll read from verse
[59:08] 6 and Paul writing here says for though
[59:10] I would desire to Glory I shall not be a
[59:14] fool I believe that what Paul's saying
[59:17] that if I did Glory I would be a fool it
[59:19] would be foolish in other words for me
[59:21] to
[59:22] Glory he said for I will say say the
[59:26] truth but now I forbear lest any man
[59:29] should think of me above that which he
[59:31] seeth me to be or that he heareth of me
[59:34] and lest I should be exalted above
[59:36] measure through the abundance of the
[59:38] revelations there was given to me a
[59:40] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[59:43] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[59:46] exalted above measure for this thing I
[59:49] besought the Lord thce that it might
[59:51] depart from me and he said unto me my
[59:54] grace is suff sufficient for thee for my
[59:58] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:00:01] most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:00:03] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:00:06] of Christ May rest upon me therefore I
[1:00:09] take pleasure in infirmities and in
[1:00:12] reproaches and necessities and
[1:00:14] persecutions and distresses for Christ's
[1:00:17] sake for when I'm
[1:00:19] weak then am I strong amen may God add
[1:00:24] His blessings as you're seated tonight
[1:00:25] I'd like to just speak to you for a few
[1:00:29] minutes this evening on the bows of the
[1:00:31] mighty are
[1:00:32] broken and and thinking about this
[1:00:35] tonight um just getting a lot of the
[1:00:37] inspiration out of the message that the
[1:00:39] prophet preached there perfect strength
[1:00:41] by Perfect weakness and I just been
[1:00:44] thinking about the the difference
[1:00:46] between human ability and the power of
[1:00:49] God because in that message there
[1:00:53] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[1:00:54] brother Brandon would say when we're
[1:00:56] thinking that we're able to do it he
[1:00:58] said then God can't use us because we're
[1:01:00] wanting to do it ourselves see and then
[1:01:03] on the other side we get these feelings
[1:01:05] that we think that we're just
[1:01:06] insufficient and we don't want to do it
[1:01:09] but then if we would just listen to the
[1:01:11] call of God that's the very thing that
[1:01:13] God wants us to get into into that kind
[1:01:16] of a shape so he can see when we are
[1:01:20] insufficient in ourselves then we are
[1:01:22] subjects to yield to God's spirit but
[1:01:26] see as long as we think that we can do
[1:01:28] it then we can't do it but when we get
[1:01:30] to the place where we know that we can't
[1:01:32] do it and then we just yield ourselves
[1:01:34] to God and he does it so then if it's I
[1:01:38] I if it's us trying to do it then we're
[1:01:41] going to fail but if we'll just yield
[1:01:43] ourselves to God then God can't fail
[1:01:46] there's only one thing that God cannot
[1:01:48] do and that's fail he can do anything
[1:01:50] else but fail how many believes that's
[1:01:52] the truth because God cannot fail so see
[1:01:55] he said as long as we're trying it in
[1:01:57] ourselves and depending upon our own
[1:01:59] abilities and so forth then we we we'll
[1:02:03] do nothing but when we get to the place
[1:02:06] that where we know that we're nothing
[1:02:08] then God can use us see the important
[1:02:10] thing is one of the most important
[1:02:12] things that we must Master now remember
[1:02:15] this and especially he says you young
[1:02:17] preachers and lay members alike there's
[1:02:20] one thing that we got to master if we
[1:02:23] expect to fulfill the God's desire in
[1:02:25] our our life and that is that we have to
[1:02:28] master the thought of human ability amen
[1:02:32] I just think that is so powerful because
[1:02:34] you know brother RM was saying on the
[1:02:36] one hand you know we get to the place
[1:02:38] that we think that we can do it he said
[1:02:40] and when we think we can then then God
[1:02:42] can't even use you he said but then on
[1:02:45] the other hand he says we get in a spot
[1:02:47] that because of our inabilities and you
[1:02:50] know that we just don't think that you
[1:02:52] know we have we're not capable of doing
[1:02:54] it he said then we don't want to do it
[1:02:57] he said but that's exactly where God
[1:02:58] wants you to get he said because then
[1:03:01] you can yield to him see amen I think
[1:03:05] that's so powerful and brother BR would
[1:03:06] even talk about Moses there's a lot of
[1:03:08] different ones in the Bible that he
[1:03:10] would uh uh you know Bible characters
[1:03:12] that he would use there in that message
[1:03:14] but he spoke about Moses and and in
[1:03:16] another message there in uh Paul a
[1:03:19] prisoner brother BR talks about Moses
[1:03:21] and all of his training he said see and
[1:03:24] today with all of our training making
[1:03:26] Bishops and so forth and great High
[1:03:29] Ambitions and and what will we do he
[1:03:31] said our Ambitions become just about
[1:03:34] like Moses see see because before God uh
[1:03:37] uh before he could get the man in his
[1:03:40] hand he had to strip him of his
[1:03:43] Ambitions just just about like uh Moses
[1:03:46] see our Ambitions are just like his and
[1:03:49] but before God could get Moses in his
[1:03:52] hand the first thing he had to do is
[1:03:53] strip him of all his train ring seat
[1:03:56] amen he had to go out there and see
[1:03:59] Moses went out brother BR said and he
[1:04:01] did deliver he killed one Egyptian
[1:04:03] that's all he accomplished on his own
[1:04:05] that's all he got done Moses went out
[1:04:07] and killed one Egyptian buried him in
[1:04:09] the sand and then he went running for
[1:04:11] his life that's what Moses could do with
[1:04:13] his own ability see amen so God is
[1:04:16] allowing this to to for us to and I
[1:04:19] think it's amazing that that these
[1:04:21] things are recorded in the Bible because
[1:04:23] I want to tell you you know men wrote
[1:04:25] this Bible they were scribes but they
[1:04:27] were not the author and I can prove that
[1:04:30] to you because men like Moses that wrote
[1:04:32] the Old Testament he had to include in
[1:04:35] there his own failures ain't that
[1:04:37] amazing amen when Moses was writing that
[1:04:40] he had to put his own failures right in
[1:04:42] the scripture because listen friends
[1:04:43] this Bible was never wrote to glorify
[1:04:46] man it was wrote to glorify God Amen and
[1:04:50] God included all the failures of men and
[1:04:52] the failures of Moses and the failures
[1:04:54] of Abraham and all the prophets amen and
[1:04:57] all their amen where they come up short
[1:04:59] God had it recorded right in the
[1:05:01] scripture Amen to show us that man's
[1:05:04] ability is never going to be enough amen
[1:05:07] a human ability is never going to be
[1:05:09] enough and and so brother R said that
[1:05:12] God Amen took Moses on the backside of
[1:05:14] the desert and and he had to get all
[1:05:16] that training out of and now the prophet
[1:05:18] of God said in God hiding himself in
[1:05:20] Simplicity he said notice he said he had
[1:05:22] him trained in in the worldly wisdom
[1:05:25] down there in Egypt amen and he and he
[1:05:27] had him trained so that he could fail to
[1:05:30] show that it isn't wisdom that will ever
[1:05:34] that that we will ever be delivered by
[1:05:36] see It'll be by faith that we'll be
[1:05:38] delivered so he let him go down there
[1:05:40] and get such an education until he could
[1:05:42] even teach the Egyptians wisdom and
[1:05:45] Moses took the high schooling and such
[1:05:47] great education amen till he could even
[1:05:50] teach the genius amen God let him get
[1:05:52] that way so he could display himself in
[1:05:55] humility to show that wisdom has nothing
[1:05:58] to do with it see Moses miserably failed
[1:06:01] in his genius and he let him get that
[1:06:04] way for his purpose that he would fail
[1:06:07] and he did fail amen and to show that
[1:06:10] it's not by power and it's not by might
[1:06:14] it's not by the wisdom of Egypt it's not
[1:06:16] by the wisdom of our schools amen it's
[1:06:18] not by the power of our seminaries it's
[1:06:21] not by the amounts of our organization
[1:06:23] amen it's not by the power of our
[1:06:25] scholarly teaching but it's by my spirit
[1:06:28] saith God hallelujah amen his wisdom was
[1:06:33] vanished in out his in but when he met
[1:06:35] God in the burning bush Hallelujah he
[1:06:38] took off his shoes and humbled himself
[1:06:40] amen he forgot about all his wisdom and
[1:06:43] listen friend brother R said what Moses
[1:06:45] lacked amen the burning bush had amen
[1:06:49] and when he went down there he went amen
[1:06:52] down into the desert of failure amen but
[1:06:54] when he met God in the form of a burning
[1:06:57] bush amen God Amen turned that failure
[1:07:00] around amen and send him back to Egypt a
[1:07:03] one man of invasion to the greatest
[1:07:06] country with the greatest army and the
[1:07:09] greatest power of that day amen an old
[1:07:11] man with a crooked stick in his hand and
[1:07:13] he went down there to take
[1:07:16] over is that right amen and brother
[1:07:19] Brown said God allowed it to happen to
[1:07:21] prove see that wisdom and training and
[1:07:26] knowledge and all these great things
[1:07:28] would never be enough right and he he
[1:07:32] allowed uh H uh Moses to become a
[1:07:35] failure and the prophet said to show
[1:07:37] that it's not by power it's not by might
[1:07:41] but by my spirit sayith the Lord that's
[1:07:43] Zechariah 4 Zechariah 4:1 and the Bible
[1:07:47] says and the angel that taught with me
[1:07:49] came again and wake me as a man that is
[1:07:51] waken out of his sleep and he saith unto
[1:07:53] me what seest thou and I said I have
[1:07:55] looked looked and behold a Candlestick
[1:07:57] allive gold with a bow upon the top of
[1:07:59] it and his seven lamps there on and
[1:08:01] seven pipes and seven lamps which are
[1:08:03] upon the top thereof and the two olive
[1:08:06] trees bite one on the right side of the
[1:08:08] bowl and the other on the left side
[1:08:09] thereof and so I answered and spake to
[1:08:12] the angel that talked with me saying
[1:08:14] what are these my Lord and then the
[1:08:16] angel that talked with me answered and
[1:08:17] said unto me knowest thou not what these
[1:08:20] be and I said no my Lord and then he
[1:08:23] answered and spake unto me saying this
[1:08:25] is the the word of the Lord unto
[1:08:26] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[1:08:29] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[1:08:32] of hosts brother Brown would picked that
[1:08:34] up in the church age book and he said
[1:08:36] here's another lamp of pure gold it's
[1:08:38] Burning Brightly because it has plenty
[1:08:40] of oil which is which is getting from
[1:08:42] the two olive trees which stand on
[1:08:44] either side the two the two trees here
[1:08:47] represent the Old and New Testament and
[1:08:49] the and of course the old types the Holy
[1:08:52] Ghost who alone can give the light of
[1:08:55] God to to the people the angel who spoke
[1:08:57] to Zachariah was as much as saying this
[1:09:00] this is what you see means amen the
[1:09:02] church cannot accomplish anything of its
[1:09:05] own might or power but only by the Holy
[1:09:10] Ghost amen and let me just say this
[1:09:12] tonight amen that is still true amen we
[1:09:16] cannot accomplish nothing listen friend
[1:09:18] even in this service tonight amen
[1:09:20] nothing will be accomplished except amen
[1:09:22] the spirit of God Amen would come and do
[1:09:25] the work amen amen listen friends it
[1:09:28] doesn't matter what amen we're trying to
[1:09:30] achieve or do and even brother B saying
[1:09:33] th this is what it means amen that the
[1:09:35] church the church can do nothing apart
[1:09:37] from the spirit of God or the Holy Ghost
[1:09:40] brother brenon would even say in the
[1:09:41] message Oneness he said God said not by
[1:09:44] power not by might not by spirit amen
[1:09:47] amen sayith the Lord he said that's how
[1:09:49] I'll unite my church it won't be by
[1:09:51] organization it will not be by education
[1:09:54] it will not be by theologians but by my
[1:09:57] spirit sayith the Lord I'll bring my
[1:10:00] sheep together he goes on in another
[1:10:02] message there taking size with Jesus he
[1:10:05] said because the people was
[1:10:06] predestinated to eternal life they're
[1:10:08] going to find it that's all all that the
[1:10:10] father has given me will come and all
[1:10:13] that comes to me I'll give them eternal
[1:10:15] life and raise them up at the last day
[1:10:17] and they'll not be one of them lost amen
[1:10:19] I'm holding right to that the prophet
[1:10:21] said it's not by works it's not by Deeds
[1:10:24] it's not by power it's not by might but
[1:10:27] by my spirit sayith God it's not what I
[1:10:30] done it's not what I am or what I will
[1:10:32] be but what he is and I am in him and
[1:10:38] whatever he is I'm a part of him I'm
[1:10:40] saved because I'm a part of him and he
[1:10:43] is God and I'm a part of him and being
[1:10:45] his son that's right so it ain't what I
[1:10:47] done or not what I will do it's what
[1:10:50] he's already done and that's what I'm
[1:10:53] trusting in right there how many of you
[1:10:55] are trusting in the same
[1:10:57] thing amen Isaiah 28:5 amen the prophet
[1:11:02] WR or says this in that day shall the
[1:11:04] Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory
[1:11:07] and for a diadem of beauty unto the
[1:11:09] residue of his people and for a spirit
[1:11:11] of judgment to him that Seth in judgment
[1:11:14] and for strength to them that turn the
[1:11:17] the battle to the gate brother bam picks
[1:11:20] that up and the and he says it uh about
[1:11:23] that scripture he said that to the him
[1:11:25] that who is standing for him and with
[1:11:28] him this great spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:11:30] that's prophesied will be the strength
[1:11:33] of him that stands at the gate in the
[1:11:36] battle see he is our strength and we
[1:11:41] rely upon him not upon culture not upon
[1:11:45] education not upon the things of the
[1:11:47] world not by power not by might but by
[1:11:49] my spirit say the Lord see the church
[1:11:52] rest solemnly in that he will be the
[1:11:54] strength of him that stands in the gate
[1:11:56] at the Battle amen it won't be the
[1:11:58] theological background it's not the
[1:12:01] denomination but the Holy Ghost will be
[1:12:03] his strength and he'll be the one
[1:12:05] that'll stand at the gate he'll rely
[1:12:07] upon the strength of the Holy Spirit to
[1:12:09] turn the alien away and I say this
[1:12:11] tonight that's what I'm relying on
[1:12:13] tonight listen I ain't got a lot of
[1:12:15] Education I ain't got no ability amen
[1:12:18] but I tell you one thing amen I have
[1:12:20] this in my life amen that I have the
[1:12:23] Holy Ghost amen and I found this is amen
[1:12:25] that the spirit of God is my joy it's my
[1:12:28] peace it's the strength Hallelujah like
[1:12:31] I preached last night I'm not holding on
[1:12:33] to him he is holding on to
[1:12:37] me and I found this that when you get in
[1:12:40] the battle amen that's what'll keep
[1:12:43] you amen that's what'll Hold You In the
[1:12:46] Heat of the battle listen friends I'm
[1:12:48] telling you this amen determination
[1:12:50] won't do it peer pressure won't do it
[1:12:53] amen uh H uh you know preacher religion
[1:12:55] won't do it amen just church membership
[1:12:57] won't do it because there's going to be
[1:12:59] times your preacher ain't there there's
[1:13:01] plenty of times you ain't in church
[1:13:02] there's plenty of times you ain't around
[1:13:04] your parents but brother sister if you
[1:13:06] ever get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:09] and you get the spirit of God down in
[1:13:10] your heart amen when you're weak he's
[1:13:14] strong Hallelujah and when you have no
[1:13:17] ability to stand amen he's still
[1:13:21] strong he'll keep you in the hour of
[1:13:24] Temptation he'll be your strength in the
[1:13:29] battle that's why Paul would say it this
[1:13:32] way in Philippians 4:13 I can do all
[1:13:35] things amen how many believes that
[1:13:38] tonight say well brother I can't do
[1:13:40] nothing you're exactly right amen within
[1:13:42] yourself we can't do nothing amen but he
[1:13:45] said I can do all things through Christ
[1:13:49] who strengthens
[1:13:51] me but I want to say this tonight but
[1:13:53] without him
[1:13:56] see without the Lord right we are
[1:13:59] helpless and
[1:14:00] hopeless and I'm just going to say this
[1:14:03] on your own friends and I I I'm not
[1:14:05] trying to this is not a service to beat
[1:14:07] you
[1:14:08] down but I I want you to understand
[1:14:11] something though within your own selves
[1:14:13] with your own abilities you're no match
[1:14:16] for
[1:14:18] Satan and and he's been dealing with
[1:14:21] people for for thousands of years now
[1:14:25] he has
[1:14:26] studied you know personalities and
[1:14:30] personality traits and genealogy and
[1:14:34] certain strains that are passed down and
[1:14:36] he's he knows exactly uh where the you
[1:14:39] know the buttons to push and exactly
[1:14:42] where to attack you at and amen he'll
[1:14:45] stand back and study you like a like an
[1:14:48] opponent and and he'll know exactly
[1:14:50] where to hit
[1:14:52] you and you on your own are are no match
[1:14:55] for
[1:14:57] him is that right amen and I'm telling
[1:15:00] you this tonight the only hope that we
[1:15:02] have amen is is that we got to get the
[1:15:05] Overcomer in
[1:15:08] us because the Bible says that he has
[1:15:12] overcome amen and and and once you get
[1:15:14] the Overcomer in you then you can have
[1:15:17] this testimony greater is he that is
[1:15:20] within
[1:15:21] me than he that's in the world Amen and
[1:15:25] then you realize it ain't me amen it's
[1:15:28] not me that's overcoming it's not me
[1:15:30] it's not my power it's not my might it's
[1:15:33] not my ability but greater is he that is
[1:15:37] in me than he that's in the world the
[1:15:39] prophet of God said greater is he that
[1:15:42] is in me than that overcoming sin
[1:15:44] greater is he that's in me amen than
[1:15:47] that than that uh sickness or amen
[1:15:49] whatever it is that you're facing
[1:15:52] tonight you believe that
[1:15:56] you see but without
[1:15:59] him that's What Makes You Different
[1:16:02] right cuz you know it's let's just take
[1:16:05] Israel you put God on one side in other
[1:16:09] words you separate God from from from
[1:16:11] Israel and Israel is just like anybody
[1:16:14] else can I just read a quote to you
[1:16:16] brother BR said you see the one
[1:16:17] difference between Israel and the rest
[1:16:19] of the Nations was
[1:16:21] God and by the way God didn't choose
[1:16:24] them because they were the greatest or
[1:16:26] because they were the strongest in
[1:16:28] another as a matter of fact when God
[1:16:29] chose them they were nothing he said I
[1:16:32] found you in a field in your own blood
[1:16:34] amen you are nothing but I picked you up
[1:16:37] and cleaned you up and washed you up
[1:16:39] listen friends amen God didn't choose
[1:16:41] them because they were great amen he
[1:16:43] chose them because he loved them by
[1:16:46] predestination and I say this tonight he
[1:16:48] didn't choose you either because you
[1:16:50] were great and he didn't choose you
[1:16:52] because of your last name and he didn't
[1:16:54] choose you because of your ability
[1:16:57] Hallelujah and I don't care how much of
[1:16:59] a failure are you are or feel like you
[1:17:02] are or what your past is tonight or the
[1:17:05] family you come out of or the mess that
[1:17:07] you're in amen the god that picked up
[1:17:10] Israel can pick you
[1:17:13] up Hallelujah when it come to the
[1:17:17] Gentiles he said I chose you a people
[1:17:20] that was not even a
[1:17:23] people and I'll raise you up for my
[1:17:26] name's
[1:17:28] sake
[1:17:30] Hallelujah do you believe
[1:17:32] it but brother R said the only
[1:17:35] difference between Israel and the rest
[1:17:37] of the Nations was God right you put God
[1:17:40] on one side and Israel was just like any
[1:17:42] other
[1:17:43] Nation when Samson cut off his hair he
[1:17:47] was like any other
[1:17:48] man you put the leadership of the Holy
[1:17:51] Ghost aside and the church is nothing
[1:17:52] but the world with God's name and
[1:17:54] attached to it the world and the church
[1:17:57] are of the same lump just like Jacob and
[1:17:59] Esau was of the same parents but the
[1:18:01] spirit of God is what makes the
[1:18:05] difference you know I I I I like brother
[1:18:07] Donnie said sometimes you go on side
[1:18:09] roads this is a side road but you know
[1:18:12] I'm always amazed at this cuz Israel
[1:18:14] when they come to
[1:18:16] Samuel they said we want a
[1:18:19] king and and and the reason why they
[1:18:22] wanted a king is because they wanted to
[1:18:23] be like other nations
[1:18:25] right Oh my he said we want somebody to
[1:18:27] go before us in battle we want a man to
[1:18:31] go before us in battle we we we would
[1:18:34] you know God was leading them and God
[1:18:37] had been going before them they had the
[1:18:40] greatest General that they that ever was
[1:18:43] or ever will
[1:18:44] be he never lost a
[1:18:47] battle amen but Israel amen under that
[1:18:50] kind of leadership says you know they
[1:18:52] got to looking at other nations and what
[1:18:54] other people and they said you know we
[1:18:55] want to be like them we want a man to go
[1:18:57] before us in battle and God said okay
[1:19:00] you want to be like everybody else then
[1:19:02] go ahead and be like everybody else but
[1:19:04] what they didn't realize amen as soon as
[1:19:06] they become like other nations that's
[1:19:08] exactly what they was going to be and

[1:20:30] church is not the pictures we got on the
[1:20:34] wall come on Friends what separates us
[1:20:38] from every other church is not you know
[1:20:41] necessarily that we got more gifted
[1:20:43] minister or or or greater musicians or
[1:20:47] or better uh singers or come on friends
[1:20:50] I think we got the best of the best but
[1:20:52] I'm telling you what makes us different
[1:20:55] is the spirit of
[1:20:57] God what makes us different is that the
[1:21:00] Holy Ghost is here what makes us
[1:21:03] different is that God's presence is with
[1:21:06] us amen that's what said amen that's
[1:21:09] what made Samson
[1:21:10] different Amen brother Bram said perfect
[1:21:14] strength by Perfect weakness again he
[1:21:16] said here's something to console
[1:21:18] us here's something that encourages us
[1:21:21] he said out of weakness and humility God
[1:21:24] chooses people to build his kingdom out
[1:21:26] of it out of that if we ever get to
[1:21:30] heaven amen if we ever stand in the
[1:21:33] presence of God with his church we'll
[1:21:35] stand with a bunch of people that's been
[1:21:38] weak and rejected and cast out by the
[1:21:42] world a bunch of know it
[1:21:47] nothings I love this
[1:21:49] message I love how brother Braham could
[1:21:51] say things he said God don't need a
[1:21:53] bunch of know- at- all
[1:21:55] he needs some know it
[1:21:57] nothings amen God is looking for I don't
[1:22:00] know about the rest of y'all but that
[1:22:01] that encourages me brother Jackie amen

[1:22:05] think and well you know if I just had a
[1:22:07] greater understanding or if I just you
[1:22:09] know or if you ain't careful you know I
[1:22:11] know what it is I'm a preacher so you
[1:22:13] know sometimes you start thinking well

[1:22:16] could sing like that brother and I know
[1:22:18] you're going through the same thing amen
[1:22:20] but I tell you this amen we ain't God
[1:22:22] didn't call us to compare ourselves with
[1:22:24] one another amen listen friends that's
[1:22:26] not what God is looking for amen he's
[1:22:28] looking for somebody not a know it all
[1:22:30] but a know at nothing and somebody say

[1:22:34] use me I don't know what you could ever
[1:22:36] get out of my life amen but I tell you
[1:22:38] what everything I have all that I am
[1:22:41] amen I ain't nothing but I give all of
[1:22:43] my nothingness into your hands and
[1:22:46] whatever you can do in my life I
[1:22:49] Surrender my life to you
[1:22:58] yes sir the Bible says in Hebrews
[1:23:01] 11:32 what shall I more say for the time
[1:23:05] would fail me to tell of Gideon and of
[1:23:07] Barack and of Samson of jethi and David
[1:23:10] and Samuel and of the prophets who
[1:23:14] through faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[1:23:16] righteousness obtained promises stop the
[1:23:19] mouth of
[1:23:21] lons quench the violence of Fire escaped
[1:23:25] the edge of the sword and out of
[1:23:28] weakness were made
[1:23:31] strong wax violent in in in in in fight
[1:23:35] turn to flight the armies of the aliens
[1:23:38] listen friends you know who he's talking
[1:23:39] about here the heroes of the faith right
[1:23:43] right the heroes of your Bible he said
[1:23:46] they amen these Heroes that he's talking
[1:23:48] about out of weakness were made strong
[1:23:52] brother Brown said they actually had to
[1:23:53] get weak
[1:23:56] before they could ever get be
[1:23:58] strong amen and he begins to name some
[1:24:01] of them I just going to take maybe one
[1:24:02] or two but probably one because I've
[1:24:05] already run out of time amen but but he
[1:24:08] mentioned Samson there and I got to
[1:24:10] thinking about Samson and how that he
[1:24:12] was you know such a great uh a warrior
[1:24:15] in the scripture and such a great man
[1:24:17] and had all these great victories you
[1:24:19] know brother Bram said you know that
[1:24:20] somebody dra a picture of him he said he
[1:24:22] said man his shoulders was so big he
[1:24:24] said I don't even see how the guy could
[1:24:25] even stand on the platform he has such a
[1:24:28] h you know such a big shoulders and and
[1:24:31] and and muscles he said he said there
[1:24:33] wouldn't be no mystery in
[1:24:35] that he said see there wouldn't be no
[1:24:37] mystery in that how he could amen take
[1:24:39] and tear a line apart or pick up the
[1:24:41] gates and walk up on the hill with it or
[1:24:43] something like that there wouldn't be no
[1:24:44] mystery in that he said but I think he
[1:24:46] was a little bitty curly-headed shrimp
[1:24:49] about like that a little mama's boy
[1:24:52] little curls hanging down amen but what
[1:24:54] where was the thing was see they
[1:24:56] couldn't understand how he could take
[1:24:58] the Jawbone of a mule amen and and just
[1:25:01] beat them Philistines and their helmets
[1:25:04] about an inch or half thick and and what
[1:25:06] was it it was a hidden
[1:25:09] power Amen brother BR said it wasn't
[1:25:12] amen the muscles in his
[1:25:14] arms no it was the it was at the power
[1:25:17] of God Came Upon
[1:25:19] him I I again I tell I just love the
[1:25:22] message cuz the message brother B talks
[1:25:24] about David being a a little Ruddy guy
[1:25:26] and he he and then brother Brown talk
[1:25:28] about Samson being a little curly-headed
[1:25:30] shrimp and you know I thought praise God
[1:25:34] Amen cuz I you know I wish I was 6' 10
[1:25:37] too and amen maybe packing about 200 lb
[1:25:39] right now amen but I tell you God didn't
[1:25:41] make me that way amen but I tell you
[1:25:44] what when I begin to read about Samson I
[1:25:46] thought I begin to find out God don't
[1:25:48] need no big
[1:25:50] man he's a big God
[1:25:55] I knew I'd get a good solid amen out of
[1:25:57] Joe
[1:26:01] Adams it really don't matter how big or
[1:26:04] small you are because it ain't the power
[1:26:07] it's not the the strength of that was in
[1:26:10] Samson's arm brother B said it was a
[1:26:12] hidden
[1:26:13] power right it was a hidden
[1:26:17] power he said and that's what the church
[1:26:19] today you got a hidden power something
[1:26:22] that fortifies what is it it's the
[1:26:25] word amen the manifestation of God's
[1:26:28] grace in his people amen that's the
[1:26:30] hidden power listen friends I'm telling

[1:27:18] the middle of Satan's Eden they don't
[1:27:20] know how you're doing it amen and
[1:27:22] they're trying to figure it out well I
[1:27:24] just don't well maybe it's a church or
[1:27:26] or maybe it's a you know they raising or
[1:27:28] maybe it's and all that's got something
[1:27:30] to do with it but friends amen The
[1:27:32] Secret of it is a hidden
[1:27:34] power hallelujah it's something down on
[1:27:37] the inside of the
[1:27:40] inside it's called the Holy
[1:27:43] Ghost Hallelujah well I know amen some
[1:27:47] people are ashamed to say that word
[1:27:48] anymore but you looking at one preacher
[1:27:51] I am not ashamed to be identified with
[1:27:54] with the Holy Ghost with the baptism of
[1:27:56] the Holy Ghost with the with the power
[1:27:59] Hallelujah of the spirit of God that's
[1:28:02] living within an individual I tell you R
[1:28:06] it's overcoming

[1:28:17] might it's not by power it's by my
[1:28:19] spirit sayeth the Lord
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:26] that was a secret of of Samson's
[1:28:32] Victory and that's what
[1:28:35] Delilah was trying to
[1:28:39] find the Bible says in judges 16 and4
[1:28:43] and it came to pass afterward that he
[1:28:44] loved a
[1:28:48] woman there's a great opportunity
[1:28:50] opportunity right here for me to preach
[1:28:53] to Young people but I'll be
[1:28:59] careful he loved a
[1:29:01] woman whose name was
[1:29:04] Delilah and the Lords of the Philistines
[1:29:06] came unto her and said unto her entice
[1:29:08] him and see wherein his great strength
[1:29:12] Li and by what means we may prevail
[1:29:14] against him that we may bind him to
[1:29:17] afflict him and we will give thee every
[1:29:20] one of us 1100 pieces of silver and
[1:29:22] Delilah said to Samson tell me I pray
[1:29:24] thee where in thy great strength lith
[1:29:26] and wherewith thou thou mest be bound to
[1:29:29] afflict thee and Samson begin to tell
[1:29:32] her well you know if you bind me with
[1:29:35] ropes that have never been used or you
[1:29:37] know and there was several different
[1:29:38] things that he said and or put a pen in
[1:29:40] my hair and all these kind of things and
[1:29:42] every time she would you know she would
[1:29:44] do what Samson said and then she would
[1:29:46] come Samson the fistings are and he'd
[1:29:48] rise and Shake himself and a and she
[1:29:51] would just go back and press upon him
[1:29:53] with her words
[1:29:54] brother Brown said that was Delilah's
[1:29:57] motive was to find his
[1:29:59] power that's where she could wreck him
[1:30:02] after she found his power and that's
[1:30:04] what the devil is trying to do with the
[1:30:06] church is to find the secret of the
[1:30:09] power is that right and then brother
[1:30:12] Brown would begin to say how that the
[1:30:14] Philistines would come and there would
[1:30:15] come a message and and he would rise up
[1:30:18] and brother Brown would even type that
[1:30:19] with the ages he said the church seemed
[1:30:21] to be bound there after the uh you know
[1:30:24] after the early church come and after
[1:30:26] the N counsel the church seemed to be
[1:30:28] bound he said but a message come the
[1:30:30] fistings are upon the and it rose up and
[1:30:32] shook itself and here comes Luther with
[1:30:34] justification then it was bound again he
[1:30:36] said but it rose up and shook itself and
[1:30:37] here come Wesley amen with say and he
[1:30:40] typed it down through the church like
[1:30:41] that amen but but watch but she just
[1:30:44] continued to press upon her the Bible
[1:30:46] says in the 16th verse there and it come
[1:30:48] to pass when she pressed him daily with
[1:30:50] her words and urged him so that his Soul
[1:30:54] was vexed unto death that he told her
[1:30:57] all his heart and said unto her there
[1:31:01] has not come a razor upon my head for I
[1:31:04] have been a Nazarite unto God from my
[1:31:05] mother's womb and if I be shaven then my
[1:31:08] strength will be will go from me and I
[1:31:10] shall become weak and be like and be
[1:31:12] like any other
[1:31:15] man did you hear what Samson's own
[1:31:18] testimony amen if you cut my hair off
[1:31:21] amen which was a representation of his
[1:31:23] Covenant with God God Amen he said I
[1:31:25] will be like any other
[1:31:29] man brother Brown said amen what caused
[1:31:32] it am me what was the cause of Samson's
[1:31:34] fall he let a woman lure him away from
[1:31:37] the promise of God and that's exactly we
[1:31:39] all know that he had Seven Locks he was
[1:31:42] born his birth path was to be a Nazarite
[1:31:45] an odd fell to the Lord but you see he
[1:31:47] let this woman lure him until she shaved
[1:31:50] his oddness
[1:31:52] off and that's the the same thing that's
[1:31:54] happened to the church amen you were
[1:31:57] born to Be A peculiar people a holy
[1:32:00] nation a royal priesthood but what has
[1:32:02] happened you let the world shave off
[1:32:05] your peculiar until you become one of
[1:32:08] them listen friends I say this tonight
[1:32:11] amen let amen I refuse to let the world
[1:32:14] shave off our

[1:32:32] your people we ought to be OD to the
[1:32:34] world brother say we're odd
[1:32:38] boss and the devil is trying to find the
[1:32:41] secret of your power and I'm telling you
[1:32:43] the prophet of God is standing right
[1:32:45] here and preaching to us that when you
[1:32:47] lose that and we allow Satan to shave
[1:32:49] off the thing that makes us different
[1:32:55] you'll lose the
[1:32:57] [Applause]
[1:32:59] power because the spirit of God left him
[1:33:03] and he was like any other
[1:33:04] man and watch this in the 19th verse and
[1:33:08] she made him to sleep upon her knees and
[1:33:10] she called for a man and she caused him
[1:33:12] to shave off the Seven Locks of his head
[1:33:14] and she began to afflict him and his
[1:33:16] strength had went from him and she said
[1:33:18] the Philistines be upon thee Samson and
[1:33:21] he awoke out of his sleep and said I
[1:33:23] will go out as other times before and
[1:33:25] shake
[1:33:26] myself and he was not amen he wish not
[1:33:30] that the Lord was departed from
[1:33:33] him but the Philistines took him and put
[1:33:36] his eyes out and brought him down to
[1:33:38] Gaza and bound him with feathers of
[1:33:41] brass and he did grind in the prison
[1:33:45] house and the Lord's in verse 23 and the
[1:33:48] Lords of the Philistines gathered them
[1:33:50] together for to offer a great sacrifice
[1:33:52] to deeon their God and to Rejoice for
[1:33:55] they said our God ha delivered Samson
[1:33:57] our enemy into our hand and when the
[1:34:00] people saw him they praised their God
[1:34:01] for they said our God had delivered into
[1:34:03] our hands our enemy and the destroyer of
[1:34:06] our country which slew many of us and it
[1:34:08] came to pass that when their hearts were
[1:34:10] Merry and they said and they said call
[1:34:12] for Samson that they that he may make us
[1:34:15] Sport and they call for Samson out of
[1:34:18] the house of prison and he made them
[1:34:20] Sport and they set him between the
[1:34:21] pillars listen friends Amen brother

[1:34:25] said they had actually gathered
[1:34:27] themselves together to celebrate the
[1:34:29] victory over Jehovah's
[1:34:32] servant why because he had lost the
[1:34:35] thing that made him
[1:34:38] different brother R said they had him
[1:34:40] doing tricks to entertain them and
[1:34:44] that's just about the way it's got
[1:34:45] instead of the Holy
[1:34:47] Spirit Come on is all right listen

[1:34:52] so that's what I'm going to do tonight
[1:34:54] because I want to tell you when the
[1:34:56] spirit of God leaves a church church

[1:37:12] somebody
[1:37:14] delivered that takes the spirit of God
[1:37:17] that'll take the presence of God and I
[1:37:19] don't know about the rest of y'all but I
[1:37:21] just want to lift my voice and lift my
[1:37:24] hands and say oh God come in these
[1:37:27] Services come in every meeting let the
[1:37:30] spirit of God be poured
[1:37:33] out let the Holy Ghost have his
[1:37:42] way brother brandham goes on to
[1:37:45] say he
[1:37:47] says we got a lot of that today but it's
[1:37:50] too
[1:37:51] bad he said but notice
[1:37:55] it didn't bring back the spirit of
[1:37:57] God and see the thing about it is is the
[1:38:01] people are not willing to pay the
[1:38:05] price he said I believe that God just
[1:38:07] Remains the Same as he ever was how many
[1:38:10] of you believe that right but the thing
[1:38:13] of it is the people has got so wound up
[1:38:16] in the world and the world in them till
[1:38:19] they just got enough religion to make
[1:38:21] them miserable come on and not enough to
[1:38:25] really turn loose to God and give their
[1:38:27] whole heart to
[1:38:28] him oh get enough just to say well I go
[1:38:31] to church certainly I enjoyed the good
[1:38:33] singing and the Clapping of the hands
[1:38:34] well I love that too see amen but the
[1:38:36] prophet God that didn't bring the spirit
[1:38:38] of God back and Samson had to get to a
[1:38:41] place of such desperation until he was
[1:38:44] willing to die with his
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:50] enemy he said we find out Samson prayed
[1:38:54] right he said Lord let me die with my
[1:38:57] enemy die to the enemy that that that
[1:39:00] had got him that way and if there's
[1:39:02] anything that people ought to pray for
[1:39:04] tonight and we see the thing that's been
[1:39:07] done is is getting away from the Bible
[1:39:09] and getting to Crees and so forth then
[1:39:11] die to that thing and get out of it see
[1:39:14] just die to it Samson was willing to pay
[1:39:16] the price to get the power of God back
[1:39:19] again and there's a price to be paid for
[1:39:21] it but today people don't seem to do do
[1:39:23] it see oh we hear Revival sure yes we
[1:39:26] have denominational Revival we got more
[1:39:28] members and all things like that but
[1:39:30] look at the morals is constantly
[1:39:32] decaying and look how further and
[1:39:34] further away from God they're getting
[1:39:36] all the time and getting away from the
[1:39:38] word but Samson knew one thing and I
[1:39:40] wonder if the church realizes that today
[1:39:43] he knew that in his backslid condition
[1:39:46] he could not meet the challenge of the
[1:39:51] hour listen I just want to say this
[1:39:53] tonight as far as a man Samson was just
[1:39:57] as much man as he ever was apart from
[1:40:00] his eyes being out taken out apart from
[1:40:02] him being blind he was just as as far as
[1:40:06] human ability he was just as much man as
[1:40:09] he ever was he had the same arms same
[1:40:11] legs same muscles he ever
[1:40:13] had as far as a man you see he was just
[1:40:17] the same but he knew I cannot meet the
[1:40:20] challenge in the condition that I'm in
[1:40:24] amen and Samson stood there stripped of
[1:40:27] his
[1:40:28] power stripped of his power but do you
[1:40:31] know there was something that the
[1:40:34] Philistines didn't
[1:40:35] notice that while Samson was standing
[1:40:38] there thinking all this
[1:40:40] over come on come on his hair begin to
[1:40:44] grow out
[1:40:45] again Hallelujah and listen friends
[1:40:48] while they were standing there looking
[1:40:49] at that powerless man amen and they were
[1:40:53] making sport of him and amen and what he
[1:40:55] had become amen they forgot to watch
[1:40:59] amen they forgot to watch and brother BR
[1:41:01] said what they didn't see was them tears
[1:41:03] running out of them dry sockets amen
[1:41:06] where the eyeballs used to be what they
[1:41:08] didn't see amen what they didn't see was
[1:41:10] his lips moving a prayer of repentance
[1:41:13] hallelujah what they didn't realize amen

[1:41:17] saw was an old blind man a defeated
[1:41:20] enemy a poweress church I'm church I'm
[1:41:23] telling you amen the devil might be
[1:41:25] looking at us tonight and the devil
[1:41:27] might be laughing at us right now and he
[1:41:30] said oh look they've lost their power

[1:41:37] the devil's looking at look at that all
[1:41:40] amen oh yes sir it's a defeated enemy
[1:41:42] but what the devil don't see tonight is
[1:41:45] there's a new shock of hair that's going
[1:41:48] out Hallelujah and while Samson was in
[1:41:51] prison his hair begin to
[1:41:57] grow Hallelujah and the prophet of God
[1:42:00] said all of a sudden he begin to feel
[1:42:03] something on his
[1:42:06] shoulder and and S begin to realize wait
[1:42:09] a
[1:42:11] minute I might be a blind man but the
[1:42:14] secret of my power was never in my
[1:42:17] eyes I might be weak but the secret of
[1:42:21] my power was never in my arm
[1:42:26] arms Hallelujah I might be a slave amen
[1:42:31] I might listen I might be a prisoner but
[1:42:34] the secret of my power come from within
[1:42:37] and he begin to fill them Seven Locks
[1:42:39] and he begin to realize I'm a Nazarite
[1:42:42] un God I was chosen to destroy this
[1:42:48] enemy
[1:42:50] Hallelujah and something in his heart
[1:42:53] heart begin to cry out is there a
[1:42:56] possibility just once
[1:42:59] more just once more just one more time
[1:43:03] could I see the power of God and brother
[1:43:05] BR said Samson wanted to see God's glory
[1:43:09] manifested more than he loved his own
[1:43:11] life he wanted to see amen the power of
[1:43:14] God return back more than his own life
[1:43:17] he was willing to die for it oh is there
[1:43:20] any senses in this building tonight if
[1:43:22] you get to war to see the power of God
[1:43:25] more than your own life and you're
[1:43:27] willing to give Pride Amen to sacrifice
[1:43:29] Pride or
[1:43:33] reputation Hallelujah and you ain't
[1:43:36] worried about what your neighbor thinks

[1:46:41] stand our
[1:46:43] feet listen to me because this is
[1:46:47] powerful
[1:46:51] on I wanted to get into
[1:46:53] Gideon a little while
[1:46:57] because Israel got in such a condition
[1:47:00] and backlit on God
[1:47:03] and the enemy come in and took
[1:47:07] over and God sent him a
[1:47:12] prophet and brother Brown said and
[1:47:13] Gideon was out there threshing wheat and
[1:47:16] he said the message of the Prophet was
[1:47:17] running through his heart but brother
[1:47:19] Daryl he the question he has was if God
[1:47:23] be for us and where's all the
[1:47:27] Miracles come on but an angel met him
[1:47:32] there you know what that angel told him
[1:47:34] he said thou Mighty Man of
[1:47:39] Valor you know what brother Brown said
[1:47:41] he said that that message from the angel
[1:47:42] was very surprising to
[1:47:44] Gideon he said cuz he didn't know he was
[1:47:47] a mighty man of
[1:47:48] Valor he said it maybe it's surprising
[1:47:50] to you he said but you're Mighty Man of
[1:47:53] Valor
[1:47:55] too and the prophet of God but you know
[1:47:57] what's amazing to me
[1:47:59] because as as you go on down through the
[1:48:02] scripture
[1:48:03] there and and and and the angel begins
[1:48:06] to give him his commission and call him
[1:48:09] to defeat the enemy Gideon says
[1:48:14] listen my family's
[1:48:17] poor and I'm the
[1:48:20] least in my father's house
[1:48:24] but you know what God didn't accept his
[1:48:28] excuse he just looked at him and said
[1:48:30] have I not called
[1:48:33] thee go in this thy might and you'll
[1:48:36] defeat the minites as one
[1:48:41] man because God never did need a great
[1:48:46] man listen when Jesse went down to the
[1:48:49] house of or I'm sorry when Samuel went
[1:48:50] down to the house of Jesse and he was
[1:48:53] looking for a king for Israel you know
[1:48:56] even Jesse said hey I know exactly who
[1:48:58] it is I'll go ahead and get him he
[1:49:01] called his eldest son I mean he looked
[1:49:02] like a king and you know conducted
[1:49:04] himself that way and all the kind he had
[1:49:06] all the traits character traits
[1:49:08] and and Samuel let him said no he that
[1:49:11] ain't
[1:49:12] him and then he called the next one he
[1:49:14] he said no he's he it's not him
[1:49:17] either he got went all the way down
[1:49:20] through seven sons and none of them was
[1:49:23] God's
[1:49:26] anointed and to the place even the
[1:49:28] prophet said you got any
[1:49:32] more yeah we got a little we got I got a
[1:49:35] little boy out there watching the Sheep
[1:49:37] go fetch
[1:49:39] him and when he brought Little David up
[1:49:41] to in the eyes of that Prophet fell on
[1:49:44] that little that little Shepherd
[1:49:47] boy he just took the Horn of the
[1:49:49] anointing
[1:49:51] oil poured it out over David's head he
[1:49:54] was the least in his father's house but
[1:49:58] he was chosen of
[1:50:01] God and God said I called you out of the
[1:50:04] sheep coat amen I called you out of the
[1:50:06] field I listen David you was nothing
[1:50:08] when I found you and I made you the king
[1:50:10] of Israel and David was one of the
[1:50:12] greatest kings ever was amen because of
[1:50:14] that very reason that God gave him his
[1:50:17] training out there in the field with a
[1:50:18] bunch of stinking sheep listen friends
[1:50:21] amen that's exactly how God ch
[1:50:23] amen the the the Bible says that man
[1:50:24] looks on the outward appearance but God
[1:50:26] is looking at the heart and that's what
[1:50:29] God is looking at you tonight and he's
[1:50:31] saying you're a mighty man of Valor and
[1:50:32] you your estimation of yourself might
[1:50:35] I'm the least in my father's house I'm
[1:50:36] the littlest in the church I have the
[1:50:38] least to offer amen but listen friends
[1:50:40] God is saying this amen my strength is
[1:50:43] made perfect in your
[1:50:47] [Applause]

[1:51:36] don't know exactly how you're feeling or
[1:51:37] what your battle
[1:51:39] is but a prophet said see you feel like
[1:51:43] you're too weak but really you're too
[1:51:47] strong he said because you're too strong
[1:51:52] to surrender yourself and yield yourself
[1:51:55] to

[1:52:02] ability he just needs you to surrender

[1:53:52] WI witness and begin to testify to non
[1:53:54] the leop and it would be through her

[2:27:33] people were in the back of the building
[2:27:35] waving their hands trying to get brother
[2:27:38] brandham to stop
[2:27:41] preaching they wanted him to hush they
[2:27:44] was moving dishes making all kinds of
[2:27:47] noise and he kept right on going aren't
[2:27:50] you glad he did aren't you glad he did
[2:27:54] you'd never even know that that was
[2:27:56] going on cuz God had a a message called
[2:28:00] The Rapture that needed to be preached
[2:28:03] he never preached it like that anywhere
[2:28:06] else around the world but he faced right
[2:28:09] through that opposition that'd be pretty
[2:28:11] distracting wouldn't it Brothers that'd
[2:28:12] be pretty distracting for people
[2:28:14] standing back there in the back waving
[2:28:16] their hands making noises with dishes
[2:28:19] and all that he just kept right on going
[2:28:21] thank God for a man thank God for a man

[2:29:24] on preaching and when he got done he
[2:29:25] said it has been spoken so shall it be
[2:29:28] and I believe we're looking at the
[2:29:29] people tonight that's going to take that
[2:29:31] Rapture amen amen let's bow our hearts
[2:29:34] together Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[2:29:36] you for the anointing that we feel in
[2:29:38] this building tonight Lord it goes
[2:29:40] beyond just emotion or sensation Lord it
[2:29:43] moves into that channel that Lord your
[2:29:45] Prophet talked about Lord that we're
[2:29:47] Messiah dear God we're not operating by
[2:29:49] the five inner outer senses but Lord
[2:29:52] we're operating by that super sense and
[2:29:54] Lord as your word has come forth tonight
[2:29:56] in power and demonstration Lord We
[2:29:59] Believe by that super sense that all
[2:30:01] things are possible Lord I pray tonight
[2:30:03] as we prepare to go our separate ways
[2:30:05] Lord May these things not just be
[2:30:07] another sermon Lord may we not just
[2:30:10] leave and say what a good message that
[2:30:12] was but Lord may we begin to feed up on
[2:30:14] these things until the word we heard
[2:30:16] tonight takes all the human ability out
[2:30:19] and Lord there's no way we can take that
[2:30:21] Rapture that we've been Lord just
[2:30:23] thinking about and speaking about here
[2:30:24] tonight but Lord we know that greater is
[2:30:27] he that is in us than he that is in the
[2:30:29] world and Lord we're so thankful tonight
[2:30:31] that your Prophet did not tell us that
[2:30:33] it was rapturing works but he said it's
[2:30:35] rapturing Grace and rapturing Faith and
[2:30:38] Lord that has been spoken now there's a
[2:30:40] people in position tonight to manifest
[2:30:42] that Lord may you place your hand of
[2:30:44] protection upon every car as they're
[2:30:46] traveling to these meetings Lord may you
[2:30:49] bless the minister Brothers as they'll
[2:30:50] labor to bring your word father May many
