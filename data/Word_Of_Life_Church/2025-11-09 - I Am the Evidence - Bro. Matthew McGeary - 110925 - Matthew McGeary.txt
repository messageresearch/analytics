If you missed the word Friday night and yesterday, it would do you really good to go back and listen to it. Um the evidence of salvation. So um that being said, you know, we're going to have activities here. Well, food for everyone. Brother Tony McGraw and Sister Jennifer. Um we I was in here late last night and they were still in there cooking for today. So, make sure and thank them. Brother Matt Willis. Um and those that cooked um lunch for us yesterday. Um thank you so much for that. And all the sisters and help if you would give all them a hand for helping. [applause] [applause] But I want to say that what I'm really thankful for is our youth. Um, you know, there's a lot of places they could have been this weekend, but they chose to come to come sit around the word. And, you know, I'm so grateful for that. And if I don't mean to bore you, you can sit down if I'm boring you. But um when you look at the youth and and in and the way that the devil is is going against the youth nowadays, the things that Satan offers the youth, you know, Brother Donnie asked me about four years ago, pull me in the office and asked me if I would help with the youth. And I I told him I I said, "I I'll not do it without brother Rob." And uh some of you parents that have kids my kids age of my kids when we didn't have all of this brother Rob two or three times a week would have the youth at his house singing doing games fellowshipping. I've often told him, "Brother Rob, I have no idea where my kids would be. If it hadn't been for you and Sister Sarah, we understand God is the glue that holds these youth together, but God needs a little brush sometimes to put it on." Brother Rob's been that. He always preaches, "Find a new friend, love somebody." And he don't always say it. Him and Sister Sarah have been that by example. And I don't I don't He's been a mentor to me. He's been around youth. He's not a minister. He don't claim to be, but he puts a lot of youth ministers to shame by the life he lives in front of our youth. And you know, Brother Donnie always says, "Give them a rose while they're here." &gt;&gt; You know, so I I I I wouldn't be able to do this without him and without brother Donnie giving us the the leadership to do it. So, if you would give Brother Rob, sister Sarah a hand. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's take these needs before the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful, Lord. Lord, where would we be if we didn't have the word of of this day, the message of the hour to come sit around, Lord, and lay our needs on top of it. Lord, as we've heard in the last week or two, Father, how your prophet said this was a sacred desk. If these needs, Lord, have been written down. They've been laid on this desk. Lord, we know this desk cannot heal them. This desk cannot meet those needs. But the anointing that you've placed in here because everyone here has brought that anointing with them. Father, you've sanctified this place. Lord, this is not a place to come in and criticize. It's not a place to come in and be bitter and hold grudges and not even a place to come in and think about what we're going to do when we get out of here. This is a place where we come, Lord, and we lay our needs at your feet and we re renew our strength for the days that lie ahead, Father. every need that's been written down, Lord. You're mindful of everyone. Not one is greater than the other. They're all great needs in your sight, Lord. So, we know that if we pull our faith together, if we believe, Father, in your word that you said, Lord, if we had faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed, we could say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea, Father, and it would be done." But you also said, "Sometimes you got to climb that mountain." So give us strength for one and faith for the other. Lord, we thank you for it. We're believing you for it. Pray, Lord, that the minister comes, Father, that you would anoint him as you have in the last two days. Meet every need with your word, Father. Bless the music that's played, Brother Aaron, Father, and all the songs that songs that are sung. We give you glory in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; We appreciate Brother Joe a little bit too this morning, don't we? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this little course. Brothers want to come receive the morning tithing offering [music] at this time. Um, also, we got three specials this morning. If they'd be making their way to the platform, uh, Sister Emily Allen, Sister Lydia, Sister Elise. I know there's a lot of a lot of specials that were turned in that they just couldn't get to this weekend.

The blind were carried into his presence and walked out with their sight. Church members walked into his presence, became sons and daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I guess the question today is for us. What do you have need of? &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. Don't you? &gt;&gt; He promised us whether it's two or three gathered together in my name, I'll be in his midst. We're so happy and grateful that all the visitors have been with us and our days has been set aside for these youth services and trust that something has been said or done that'll help you in your journey. We by no means have meetings like this to try to hinder or to hurt or to bring any type of thing in a negative way that would hinder your walk with God. I'm grateful that we still have men of God in this day who have given their life for the cause of Jesus Christ. Aren't you? Let's stand together. We'll invite brother Matt to come and just bring to us what what the Lord has placed upon his heart for today. Um we welcome each of you that are here in our gates with us and we trust that God will meet with us in a very special way. He's the only one that could be able to custom fit a service to where every hungry heart could have something. Amen. Sing something for us, Harry. [music] Let's just open our hearts together to the Lord now. And just whatever you have need now remember a minister studies and God gives him thoughts and scriptures and quotes and ideas and it goes to putting it together. And maybe your need lays outside the confines of what he's actually studied. But remember, you have the ability to pull on the gift. And the Holy Ghost can so come and minister to you in such a way. It may not be but two, three sentences or a paragraph. But those two, three sentences will change your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. woman [music] tried so many [singing] Jesus. Thank you, Father. Yet grew [singing and music] worse. So did Jesus. She came. [singing] [music] And when [singing] the unbelievers tried to frame her [singing] [music] she whispered these words [music] everybody together through her [singing] pain. This is what we [music] want to do. Oh, touching Jesus [singing] is all [music] that really matter. [music] And then [singing] your life will never be this. You believe that with all your [music] heart. Thank you, Lord, for there's only [singing] one way to touch. [music] You must [singing] believe when you [music] call on. Let's sing the chorus once together again, everybody. [music] Oh, touching Jesus [music] is all that really matters. [music] Thank you, Father. And [singing] then your [music] life will never [music] [singing] [music] [music] His name [music] is all [singing] that really matter. Then [music and singing] your life will never be [music] the same. For [singing] there's only [music] one way to touch him [music] and just believe when you call on his [music] name. [singing] My just a wonderful presence opportunity that we have to be gathered together. My I just feel the presence of the Lord is here. And as we're just singing this song, maybe they'll just keep playing that. We'll go into prayer. Touching Jesus. &gt;&gt; It It's all It's all that that matters. &gt;&gt; I mean, nothing else matters &gt;&gt; is touching Jesus. And when he comes by and he comes by your way and he starts to deal with your heart and and you know what I love about his presence and touching Jesus, it's it's not always words. It's not something that can be said. It's just his presence. &gt;&gt; And in his presence there's fullness of life and there's joy. There's there's peace. There's there's deliverance. There's there's comfort. It it seems like when he comes by, all the questions that you had, they kind of just melt away and the only thing that matters is him and him alone and and and you're with Jesus and you know, and the heartache and the pain and the struggle and all those things, you know, you start to understand it's going to be okay. It's going to be all right cuz I'm with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just go before our Lord, Lord Jesus, how we love you. And truly, Lord, as the song would sing, [music] touching Jesus is all that really matters. [snorts] Lord, how many of us here this morning could testify that you've come by and you've touched our heart and you touched our life, Lord? And Lord, we had the need of salvation and we had the need of deliverance and we were lost sinners and undone. Lord, your great love where in which you loved us, you saw fit to come and pluck us out of the muck and the mire and to let us know that you loved us and you forgave us of all of our sin and you've raised us up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Lord, what an hour, what an opportunity, what a privilege. Lord, we want to tell you we love you, &gt;&gt; Lord. Thank you for doing that, Lord. Thank you for Calvary, Lord. Thank you for shedding your blood that I could be forgiven and I could be free, Lord, from the things of this world and not in bondage, but have a real liberty, Lord, to serve you and to love you and to love this message of the hour that's called us out of the darkness of Lady Oilia, Lord, and it set us free to soar in heavenly places. Oh, how we thank you, Lord. Lord, as we just turn to the preaching of the word, Lord, I need you to come and just Lord, anoint myself to get out of the way. Anoint the ears of the hearer, Lord. And Lord, I always think of that that boy that had those fishes and loaves and there was the multitude and he didn't have enough to feed the people. But when he placed it into your hands, &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It was more than enough. &gt;&gt; They were taking up fragments and had leftovers, Lord. And I pray that, Lord, these scriptures and quotes that I have placed down, Lord, you'd just take it into your hands now. And you'll minister to the needs of your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of Romans chapter 8. uh Romans chapter 8, a very familiar scripture and uh verse 10. But I just want to thank uh brother Joe and brother Donnie for the opportunity to uh be in fellowship with you all and to speak to you. It's just been such a privilege uh to be here and an honor and and I started to realize and look out uh a lot of the young people that I've come to know and and see in different places and those from brother Josh Bennett and other uh churches uh am I just coming from Arizona and Oklahoma and certain places. I thought my goodness is this is wonderful to see all the saints of God. We just love each one of you and want you young people to know that we love you and cherish you and are proud of you. &gt;&gt; Really proud of you because you are the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And it's just a wonderful thing. And and while I have this uh opportunity, I I do want to let uh uh brother Donnie know how much I've appreciated him and his ministry and sister Carol and and my I I've over the years, you know, over the last 25 years of just being able to hear Brother Donnie minister, I I I when I I love a a ministry that it just pulls something out of you. It just identifies something in your soul. And and I just want to thank brother Donnie for your stand and unwavering compromise on the message of the hour. [applause] [applause] I I I've I've I've been a great beneficiary of the gift of God that he's placed in this body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, we do bring greetings from our pastor, brother David Mciri and the Saints in Bedford, Texas. and just want to move right into the word and see what God would have for us. Amen. Romans chapter 8 and verse 10, it would read, "And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you." Amen. You may be seated. And also just want to read a scripture we read on the opening night uh in Galatians 3 and verse 29. Galatians 3 and 29. It says, "If ye be Christ, then are you Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise." And we read the uh this quote out of possessing all things as we ministered on the evidence of salvation. Uh, brother Brandham says just what Joshua did for the children of Israel. Joshua means savior. The word Joshua and that's the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave. And he rose up again with the evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost that there is a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. Amen. And he come back and brought us an evidence. What does it do, brother Brandham? It makes you stop your lying, stealing, drinking, cursing, immorals, everything. It makes us a new creature, a new creature out of you. I who were once dead in sin and trespasses. Nevertheless, I, not me, but Christ lives in me. I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Heir to the promise. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That land belongs to us. How do you know it? Joshua rose from the dead, brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost, and I got it. Amen. Glory. I'm an heir. Oh, a child of the king, a child of the king, heir to all things. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we we ministered on the evidence of salvation, you know, the evidence, it's the proof, you know, I it's the Holy Ghost and how we are a possessor of all things. Uh we have been given a a promise. And you know, I was just thinking about the evidence and and and how the Lord would maybe lead in this service and you know, what we would minister on and and you know, he he said he brought back the evidence and the evidence is the Holy Ghost. And now the the Holy Ghost is in us. And and I was just even thinking about that, you know, that time there that those men went looking for the Welsh revival. They were maybe looking for some movement. They were looking for some gathering. and and and when they and when they saw uh uh that that officer there, you know, twirling the baton and directing traffic or whatnot, they came over there and asked him, they said, "Sir, we want to see if you can help us, but but we're looking for something. We're looking for the Welsh revival." And he said, "You're I am the Welsh revival. You're looking at it." And and what's on my heart to minister to to you this morning is is I am the evidence. &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the help of God, we'll just move along these lines as the as we just went through some thoughts how, you know, Christ is the word and the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word and makes it alive. And and we ministered last night how an evil spirit will will will a spooky spirit will will raise up and just how Joshua and Caleb I they went over into the the the land of Israel and they came back with the very evidence and the fruit that it was everything that God said it was and they said, "Let us go up at once." I mean, we are more than able. I I mean, it it's amazing to me what how how a believer looks at the promise and looks at the obstacle than than a skeptic or an unbeliever or a doubter because they were over there walking through the land and going, "Oh my goodness, uh we can't take this and it's too much and my you know that maybe the food is good here, but I tell you what, we ain't got a chance." And Joshua and Caleb, they're walking around and and looking at the biggest giants of the land and going, "Yep, we are more than able to do it." I tell you what, this is going to be a cakewalk because the same God that brought us out of Egypt, the same God that's been leading us through the wilderness, he's the same God that brought us through the Red Sea, he's the same God that's going to take us into the promised land. And he'll be the same God that'll annihilate and destroy all of our enemies. And because God gave us the promise, there is nothing that can stop us from going into our inheritance. I tell you, why not? Let's just go up at once. Let's take it all. Give me my mountain. There ain't no devil. There ain't no darkness. There ain't no demon that can stop me. We are well more able to take the land. Let us go up at once. [applause] And they got back over and Joshua and Caleb, they were all enthused about the evidence and they came here presented and say it's everything that God said it would be. Oh my, it just strikes me now. I want to tell you this message of the hour is everything that God said it was. It's my joy. It's my peace. It's my deliverance. It's my salvation. It's my reward. It's my glory. It's my all and all. It's everything that I ever wanted. And it's everything that I ever needed. It's more than enough. I want to say the message is more than enough. It'll save you. It'll deliver you. It'll fill you. It'll give you the joy. It'll give you the victory. It'll give you the peace. It'll take you to a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever forever. I tell you what, what a promise. What an inheritance that we have. I say we got something to be excited about. [applause] &gt;&gt; They come back excited and they come back enthused. &gt;&gt; We got the evidence &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden an evil report rose up. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a second, guys. How I mean, were we not in the same place? &gt;&gt; I mean, Lady Oia is a dark and wicked age. &gt;&gt; I mean, have you not seen the giants in the land and the lush devils and and all these these demons that were fighting that over there? There ain't no way we can take that land. There's no way a young person could live an overcoming life in Lady Osia. There's no way they can overcome all the strip teases and all the lust devils that walk around. There ain't no way we can go over there and take the land. And I tell you what, how in the world would we ever go into a body change? How in the world are we ever going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of the eye? See, they brought up all that doubt and all that wonder. But you know, Joshua and Caleb were over there saying, "He's more than able to do it." Why? Because the same pillar of fire that brought us up out of Egypt. The same pillar of fire that led us through the wilderness. The same pillar of fire is the one that bringing us into the promised land. I want to tell you, it's the same pillar of fire that was with brother Brandham. is the same pillar of fire that is right here in the building right here this morning. He will give you the promise. He will take you into the land. He will help you defeat every devil and every demon. I don't care what it is, young people, that you're fighting. There's an anointing upon the word of the hour to bring you into the manifestation and the fulfilling of every single promise of God. You don't have to worry. You don't have to fear. You just got to say that God promised it and I'm more [screaming] than a conqueror through Jesus Christ that strengthens me. Hey, let us go up at once and take the land. There ain't no devil. There ain't no sickness. There ain't no trial that can stop me from walking into my divine promise of almighty God. It's a good land. The message is a good land. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. An evil report rose up. &gt;&gt; No, you can't do it. You You You can't take the land. But my prophet said he rose from the dead and brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I got it. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm already feeling pretty good because I know what I had when I was out in the world. And it wasn't much. I had a bunch of fear. I had a bunch of anxiety. I had a bunch of bondage. I had a bunch of weight. I had a taskmaster that told me, "Go here, do this, bow here, smoke that, drink that." But one day, I called on the name of the Lord and I got saved and I got filled with the Holy Ghost. And I'm here to tell you, I'm standing in 2025. I got the Holy Ghost. I got it. Is there are people here this morning that can say, "I got the evidence. I'm the proof of his resurrection. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the message of the hour. I'm living it. I'm breathing it. I'm walking in it. I'm loving it. I got it. [screaming] Hallelujah. Is there a young people that can raise up in this generation of 2025 and say, "I got it." Or are you still listening to that spooky spirit? &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it. No. &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it. &gt;&gt; No, that was just that was just emotion. &gt;&gt; That was just a workup, &gt;&gt; you know. That was just you were just getting excited because you're friends. [sighs] What? That's what chapter is that? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What? What? What? Oh, that's that spooky spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the How do you know when the devil's lying? When he's running his mouth. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes it's a good time and maybe the only time that you can use that word and say, "Shut up. &gt;&gt; Shut up, you old dun devil. I've done heard from my theophony. I know where I came from and I know where I am going. I done got the evidence of the Holy Ghost shut up in my bones. So quit running your mouth. Is there a young people here that you just want to go ahead and testify the devil's been lying to me. He's been telling me I ain't got the Holy Ghost. Been telling me I ain't going to go in the rapture. Telling me I the message ain't for me. And you just want to shout out this morning and say I got [screaming] it. I got the revelation. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the evidence. A matter of fact, I am [screaming] the evidence. [applause] &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in a place he said, "The spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you." I want to just read this quote out of wisdom versus faith. Brother Brandham says, "The Bible said, "Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. Not by wisdom, not by knowledge, not by nomination, but with my spirit, I will what? Energize my word." &gt;&gt; The disciples had it swed into them. Then the spirit come to energize the word. See, not by power, not by might, not by wisdom, not by understanding. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for that &gt;&gt; because I I really can't understand a lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, not by that, but by my spirit, I will energize &gt;&gt; my word. Amen. &gt;&gt; By my spirit, say the Lord. It's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God and makes it work. So, I'm beginning to understand the promise isn't based on how I feel. The promise isn't based on what I can figure out. It It's not based on my ability. It's not even based on my good works. It's not based on something that I can do, but it's actually based on what he said. When God came to Abraham and he gave Abraham a promise and he said,"Abraham, I will make you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I will make you. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask Abraham, you know, uh, Abraham, do you think you can or or or would you would you do you think you can you can get good enough on your own? Or no, he come to him and he gave him a promise and said, Abraham, I will. &gt;&gt; And we know how the story goes. It was never based on Abraham's ability. It was always based on the promise. And it is no different because we are Abraham's seed. We are the the royal seed uh the elected of God. And it's not because of maybe what we can look at as our good works or our efforts. But it's always based upon the word. It's always based upon the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet would say this in end time signed seed. He said when the word come to Mary, she never doubted it. She said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word." See, she never said, "Now, you wait till I feel life." &gt;&gt; And then I'll go testify. &gt;&gt; You wait till I'm positive. &gt;&gt; That's the way we so-called Christians do today. Wait till I'm positive. Wait till I begin to get better. and wait till I see something happen and then I'll do it. No sir, that's not the question. You believe first. &gt;&gt; So, we have been taught by a vindicated prophet that you can take God at his word and I want to tell you if something in your heart is believing and wanting the word. We heard brother Brandham said that is eternal life that's calling to you and he said you are an heir to that. And so if God is making a call upon your life, then you don't base it on how you're feeling. You don't base it on your circumstance. You say, "That is the word of the Lord and I believe it." But many times when that happens, you know, the devil is always wanting to try to offer some type of emotion or some type of sensation and I'll just go launch right into it now because that's exactly what happened to me in in my conversion. And I got to a place, you know, where where uh uh you know, I needed help and and I I don't have time to go into all those things, but I I'd messed up my life pretty pretty bad and and I had an experience when I was 12 years old at at Louisiana camp, I knew God that was real, but but but I didn't feed that fire. I kept hanging out with the same kids in the neighborhood and and run around the neighborhood. And as they got older and started to do different things, you know, I I was around those influences and and and I held on for a while. And you know what? They actually even respected me and said, "Oh, wow. You're a Christian. and you don't do this and you don't do that. Well, that's okay. We like Christians. Come on around, old buddy. You better watch out. Them friends you're hanging out with and oh, you're a Christian, mom. I'm being a light. You better watch out. You ain't got no business being on their grounds. [cheering] [applause] I held my testimony for a season. But you know what? Then I lost my reason. There's actually a quote on that. when you lose your reason, when you get between two opinions and and and for a while I I said, "I didn't do this because of that. I'm a Christian. I don't I don't." And one day my friend said, "Man, why don't you smoke?" And I said, "Well, it makes you cough." Wrong answer. I had lost my reason, Brother Donnie. I used to be. I'm a Christian. I don't go I don't watch movies because of this. I I don't get on them websites because of this. I don't do that because I'm a Christian. But somewhere along the line, I had been beguiled and I lost my reason of why I didn't do the things that I I wasn't supposed to be doing. And I gave the wrong answer. And when I gave the wrong answer, I didn't give a word answer. &gt;&gt; I said, "It makes you cough." So guess what? Oh, just just a little. Just try a little. And and and right from that moment, I got pulled out into the world in a life of sin. I got myself into a lot of trouble. And I got to the place where I wanted the deliverance. And I remember making the decision in my heart and in my life that I'm never going to do these things again. I I really don't I I I well, I just go ahead and say it. I if if I didn't clean up my life, I was going to fail a drug test and I was going to go be in prison. &gt;&gt; That's just what it is. All right. And that's how Satan took me. And and I realized, man, if I don't clean up my life, I'm going to I'm going to fail these tests. And and I'm I started to think, man, I I need to clean up my act. I need to quit doing these things. And so I made a decision to quit doing those things. And and you want to know what? My decision didn't last long at all. &gt;&gt; There was some little old voice telling me, you got plenty of time. Just you got plenty of time. I tell you what, that same devil lives today. Don't give your heart to God Sunday morning. You just wait till Wednesday. Just wait till camp. Wait till your friends right here. Not this preacher. Not that preacher. Not brother D. Oh, there's always an excuse and a lying devil that wants you to put off the day of your salvation. But I want to tell you and declare to you, now is the time of salvation. Today is the salvation of the Lord. And I came to that moment and I had made the choice. I'm going to clean up my life. I'll never do these things anymore. I [laughter] I I I I can't risk ruining and throwing away my whole life. And I remember I made that decision and I came back in uh to the the you know, the officer that was going to test me for those things. And he said, "Oh, I won't see you here uh for another test." and and and and 45 days. And right at that moment when he said that, it was something like something next to me was going, "Hey, we got plenty of time. We we can do whatever we want to do." And in that moment, I realized that something else was making decisions for me. &gt;&gt; Ain't that strange? Something else was leading me. Something else was guiding me. Something else was pulling me into the lust and and telling me just one more time or just do that or just go down here. And I realized it was another nature. Actually, it was your first husband. uh uh the world that you're married to and you didn't realize that those thoughts that you've been having, that's the first nature of the devil that's leading you. Those ain't even your thoughts. And he told me, "You got plenty of time on Matthew. It'll be okay." And in that moment, I realized whatever that was was not me. And whatever it is, it's bigger than me. And I said, "God, I need your help." &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So I left and and I got into my car and you know I had called on the name of the Lord. Feels good to do that. &gt;&gt; And I got to driving down down down down the road and all of a sudden I don't know why but this voice this thing said we'll just get emotional and cry &gt;&gt; and I was like what? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, you've called on the name of the Lord. Now, just get emotional and cry. And I thought, get emotional and cry. And I thought, you know, I'd been raised, right? And I thought, well, it's not about getting emotional and crying. And then an old song came into my heart. I said, it's in the name of Jesus. I said, and I started singing that song. It's in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, we have the victory. And I started singing that song and and before you know it, I I didn't even realize that some guy pulled up next to me in what he thought was a fancy car. I thought maybe I had a fancy car and you know how ignorant people do. They pick fights with one another for no reason at all, you know. And he he pulled up beside me and and I I still my posture hadn't changed yet, you know. So I I'm I'm in there, you know, just kind of in my car and I look over there and I look at him, you know, and and all of a sudden he makes this big old face like this and goes and takes off and I'm like, "Well, what in the world is he looking?" I looked up in the mirror and before you know, I was crying and I was emotional. You know why? Because I put the word first. I I didn't I didn't say, "Well, it's about my how emotional I get. It's about crying." But something in my heart rose up said, "It's in the name of Jesus Christ that I had the victory." and oh then the spirit of God I I didn't realize it at the moment but he was moving upon my life but what was the what was the devil wanting to do? He was wanting to offer me some emotional &gt;&gt; as an evidence. &gt;&gt; But praise God, there was something in my heart. I needed more than an emotion. I needed more than just a shout. I needed more than just just just just some temporary moment. I needed something that could change my life. I needed the God of the Bible. I needed the God of Abraham. I needed the God of Isaac. I needed the God of Jacob. I needed the God of Paul and of John. I needed the God of William Brandom. I needed something to come down and energize my soul and change me. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, and since we're here, I'll just keep going. So, you know, I I'm I now I am I now I am getting a little emotional and I am crying. &gt;&gt; But I I I this is just a journey. It's a start. And I'm still in the journey. I ain't trying to say anything about about that. But so I got home and I was excited. I had called on the name of the Lord and you know and I I' I I'd been out pretty hard in the world and and my brothers, they were serving the Lord and but it just so happened it was a Friday night of my dad's anniversary meetings and there was believers in town and and people were out at the restaurant and and and I didn't have any dealings, you know, uh as far as maybe a a wave. you and I remember crawling out my window to avoid having to see folks and and uh but now you know I've called on the name of the Lord and and I'm feeling good and you know now I want to I want to I want to be with believers you know and so I get home I want to know where my brothers are. I said mom I said where where's where's everybody at? She's like well they're they're at the restaurant. You know she's kind of confused like why do why why do you care? And I said okay thanks. And I went out and I got back in my vehicle and I was about to about to just head to the restaurant in that same voice. Isn't it strange this this same thought that would come with just one more time, just one more moment, or or just maybe I'll put it in ways you can understand. Not this service, not not this morning, &gt;&gt; not not today. Just just put it off one more time. Or no, you're okay. And I got back in that car and and and and I and I was just about to go and and and and I heard that thought say, "I'll get you right back out in the world with music and TV." And in that moment, you know, I didn't realize, but I found out uh I found a quote for it because uh brother Brandham talks about Shamgar, I believe it is. And he said, you know, Shamgar got angry. The spirit of the Lord moved upon Shamgar and he got angry. And I didn't realize it in that moment when I heard that thought. He said, I'll get you back out in the world with music TV. I said, "Get me. You're you're going to get me." And I jumped out of my car and I I ran into the garage and I was looking all around in there and I found a big old pair of bolt cutters. You know, these big old eagle claw wire clippers. You know, they're uh cutters. I don't know. They're maybe 3 4t long. And I and I I didn't even know what I was doing. I found those things and I grabbed them and I ran back in the house and I started coming through the kitchen and I said, "I'm going to get you. You're not going to get me. I'll show you." And my mom goes, "Matthew, wait." Remember, I just asked her where my brothers were. She thought somebody was about to get it. &gt;&gt; Well, she wasn't wrong. &gt;&gt; And I remember in that moment, I I I rounded up the stairs and I flung open my door and there was a big old TV sitting there and I took them big old bunk bolt cutters and I swung them and I hit that TV and that thing exploded and I screamed out, "How you like me now? [applause] And in that moment, [applause] in that moment when I screamed out, "How you like me now?" There came something pouring out of heaven that came upon my life. Oh, and it changed the way that I thought. It changed the way that I wanted to dress. It changed my actions. It changed my thinking. My soul had become energized to be what I was always predestinated to be. And that was a son of God. I was heir to all the promises. I was heir to salvation. I'm heir to the resurrection. I was heir to all these things, but I was out there living in sin. I want to tell you if there's a young person here this morning or old alike, I say, you know what it does? Sometimes you just got to get mad at the devil and say, "Devil, I'm sick and tired of you robbing me of my joy, robbing me of my peace. I'm going to get you this morning. I'm coming after you. Take the word of God, which is the sword of the spirit. Look that devil right in the face and say, "I'm coming for you." And hit him with the word. If he don't move, hit him again. Hit him again. Hit him again. And then scream out, "How you like me now? [screaming] [applause] Where's the next one?" [applause] Hallelujah. I say there's an experience here for you this morning, &gt;&gt; but you got to believe first. Oh, that came after believing. &gt;&gt; See, my my first nature, &gt;&gt; you know, and I used to always give this testimony uh that, you know, for years I heard the devil say and I heard the devil say and I heard the devil say and then I heard a testimony one time uh given uh I can't verify but it seemed credible source that said it and and it meant a lot to me so I'll take it for myself. And he he was testifying how brother Brandham, I believe, was uh uh talking to um I always forget the brother. He mentions him as a prophet in South Africa. And he was he was he was speaking to him and he said he was talking about that that picture where it looks like the pillar of fire is kind of swirling up around the around the pulpit. And he he he said to him, he said, "You see that uh uh brethren right behind there? You see that image? That's an old Indian chief." He said he says, "That's my old nature." And he said, "It's always back there trying to" He said, "See what happens?" He says, "When the Holy Spirit comes in, it burns that nature out of you. &gt;&gt; And that old nature goes out behind you and it's always looking for an opportunity to come back into the seat of authority." &gt;&gt; Something along those lines. And when I heard that, all of a sudden, it struck me and I realized what I was calling the devil all those times was actually my first nature. It was my first husband that I was born with. And I caught the revelation. Oh, that was that first nature. That's why in Romans 7, Paul is telling the church, look, as long as as a woman's husband is alive, she's subject under the law. Has to has to live under that. And he brings down the type. And he's showing the only way that she can be free from that bondage is that first husband has to die and then he's free. And that's why Paul said, "Then you can be married to another. Then you can be married to Jesus Christ." Look, a lot of us are trying to hang on to the world and hang on to the word at the same time. But I want to tell you, you got to die. That first nature gots to die. You got to repent of your sins. You got to call out say, "Oh, God, help me. I want deliverance from the things. I don't want to listen to country music. I don't want to listen to the radio. I don't want to dress this way. I don't want to act this way. I don't want to watch these things." You got to realize there's another nature, a fierce nature. And that nature gots to die. And you got to call upon the name of the Lord with all your heart. Say, "Lord, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm tired of the devil running me here and there and me never getting the victory and going through cycles of revival and death over and over from one camp to the next camp. I need to put a stake down. I need to be changed. I need to meet the pillar of fire and know that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that first man's got to die. [applause] &gt;&gt; And die. It did. [gasps] &gt;&gt; But you know, [sighs] you still got this little bag of bones. But you know, you realize that I' I've been given a promise to bring it under subjection. [gasps] &gt;&gt; My promised land might not be some boundaries set out there with with with landscape stakes, but I've been given this land. &gt;&gt; This is the place that I can express the evidence. This is where I can prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and the forever. And the things that come out of this mouth can declare he is risen. And the footsteps that I can take can show he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And my attitude and my joy can can show that he is not dead. &gt;&gt; He is alive. &gt;&gt; Where is the Welsh revival? Where is the bride's revival? &gt;&gt; You're looking at it. &gt;&gt; I'm the proof. &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence. I once was dead, &gt;&gt; but I have been made alive in Jesus Christ. I've been set free from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; How, Matthew? Well, I I believed. &gt;&gt; But you know, you can't even believe unless it's given to you to believe. You realize how rigged this thing is? &gt;&gt; And and and and I don't mind saying it because brother Donnie, I I needed that. &gt;&gt; I needed it to be rigged. &gt;&gt; And so I know that I make mistakes. Sure. I I I go through hard times and I fall down and and I realize I I'm being built up into the stature of a perfect man and coming into that place of of perfect love and and working out of those things and I realize there's there's still some some things in this pest house that that God is working on and and sometimes, you know, things can rub you a certain way and you don't have the right response. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, it starts first with taking God at his word. And I tell you what, we make salvation and we make the the baptism of the Holy Ghost complicated. &gt;&gt; It is not complicated. &gt;&gt; Are you tired of living the way you're living &gt;&gt; or I mean, if you're still enjoying it, look, I'll tell you this. This happened to me 6 months before my conversion. Because I tell you what, sin is a it's a it's a it's a hard taskmaster. I mean, them mud pits and them slaves that beat you in Egypt, I'm telling you what. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might enjoy it for a little while, but then you start to realize they'll start, you know, making you make bricks without straw. &gt;&gt; And you know that thing that used to get you high, it don't get you high anymore. &gt;&gt; And that thing you looked at that you like so much, it just don't do it for you anymore. &gt;&gt; And it ain't one movies, it's two movies. &gt;&gt; And it ain't 25 bucks an hour, it needs to be 30 bucks an hour. And it ain't 50 bucks an hour, it has to be 100. The things of the world, they'll never satisfy. never never never never never never never never satisfy &gt;&gt; the hunger and thirst of a true son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I got tired of of you know, living under that. And so I'll never forget I jumped out I I I was driving down the road and and I jumped out of my my my car and I ran down and I got in a ditch and and I I started talking to the Lord and and it's kind of funny looking back on it because I was tired of the bondage but I kind of still, you know, like doing it. &gt;&gt; But there came a day &gt;&gt; I was just tired of it all. I didn't want to do any of that stuff anymore. I &gt;&gt; I actually realized what it was doing to my life and how Satan was trying to rob me and I hated it. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. If if you're there, &gt;&gt; if you if it's in your heart and you keep want to run out with the things of the world, &gt;&gt; it'll be there for you. &gt;&gt; But I say if something in your heart say, you know what, that's right. It's such a late hour. I don't need to fool around. you start entertaining things of the world, it'll take you way further than you want to go. &gt;&gt; And I remember praying there and and uh you know, but I I I remember in my heart, you know, I I didn't I didn't really I didn't really want to give up those things. So, I'm fast forwarding and showing you that when that first initial cry of my heart came and I really meant business, but I just remember in my heart it was just calling upon the name of the Lord and you shall be saved. It first comes by believing. And and I was just in this as we as I it struck me, you know, that's the same thing that happened with John Ryan. You know, he come through the the the prayer line and and and he said, you know, God bless you. You're healed. And he went through and he said he come back through and said, I thought you said I was healed. He said, I thought you said you believed. &gt;&gt; I thought you said I had the Holy Ghost. I thought you said you had it. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; Are you waiting for a feeling? Are you waiting for I don't know why we're here, but we're here. Or are you looking by faith into the word of God and saying, "God, you said if I repent of my sins and I'm baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall get the gift of the Holy Ghost." You know what brother Brandham told John Ryan? He said, "If you believe it, then go out there and testify. Go into action." And you know what he did? He really believed. So he started going around town saying, "I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed." And he actually had a testimony to go along with his faith. And you know the rest of the story that happened. He's sitting in that old barber chair and here they were making fun of him. and he went to testify. And once again, hey, God's healed me. And then his eyes come open. I want to tell you young people, if God give you a promise and you say, I got the Holy Ghost, don't let that old devil rob you of the Holy Ghost. You go feel free to testify, I've repented of my sins. I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and God give me the Holy Ghost. And if you've made a mistake or you've made a failure, get right back up and say, I plead the blood of Jesus Christ. God, give me the promise of the Holy Ghost. If I didn't overcome this time, I'll overcome the next time because God has given me a promise. And I'm heir to every single promise. And I got the faith to believe it. And there ain't no devil or spooky spirit that's going to rob me and take me away from my joy and my victory. Come on, people. Come on, young people. You got to testify about it. Brother Brandham goes on. He says, "What what just in this this quote that we're reading, you got to believe first." Well, we just ask for the Lord to help us here. He said, 'What did Elijah tell the woman that he went to with nothing but a handful of milk? He said, 'Make me a cake first. The miracle will happen after you take God's word first. You begin to believe God's word and then the miracle takes place upon the word &gt;&gt; because the word is the seed that brings forth the miracle. Go to take the word first. The Holy Spirit gives it life like water falling from heaven. Jesus said the he said it is the spirit that quickenth the flesh that profitth you nothing. The words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life. He said in one place the seed word itself is what? The holy spirit energizes. &gt;&gt; Now I like that because when you think about something that's energized when something's energized it's stimulated. It's awakened. It's quickened. It's electrified. &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been electrified? &gt;&gt; I want to tell you it's a revelation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you when you get shocked and you get the revelation of of voltage, I want to tell you that type of revelation, you can't stand still. &gt;&gt; You're going to move. &gt;&gt; You're going to shout. You're going to do something. You're going to be do something like this. You're going to what? Wow. [screaming] Whoa. Wow. Good. Go. Woo. That that got some that got some electricity into it. I want to tell you that's the same thing with the message of the hour. When you get a revelation, look, it will move you. You can't stand still. You're going to shout. You're going to tell somebody. Somebody's going to look over you and say, say, "Hey, why you acting like that? Hey, I've been electrified. I've been awakened. I've been stimulated. I got revelation." It'll put you into action. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's just like a seed with all the potential. It's just laying there, but it just needs to be energized. It just needs to be awakened. You know, it just reminds me as brother Brandon talks about how they everybody's saying, "Hunger, fast, pray, hunger, fast, pray." He said, "What are they doing?" He said, "They've missed the awakening of the bride." But God has sent a message by a vindicated prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30. There has been a message that has come forth and the breaking of those seals to awaken the bride of Jesus Christ to all the potential that the word says that you are. Brother Brandham says it takes the spirit of God to bring life out of broken sisters. And the life must not come out of just an intellectual revival. It has to come out of the Bible, a word revival. And what that that word is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And when it falls today, and quickened, you get the same results you did in Acts 2. Exactly. It always had, it always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere. It takes the spirit. It takes atmosphere to do things. That's the reason you men are always taught to bring your children here. &gt;&gt; Here, &gt;&gt; here. &gt;&gt; Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together. Right? &gt;&gt; Because when we come together, there's an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; When we come together, we bring the licks of fire. When we come together, we know there's the pillar of fire. We know the angel of the Lord is here. He's present amongst us and we're taught to bring our kids here. Why? Because when we come together, there's an atmosphere and it takes atmosphere to do things. I pray there'd be such an atmosphere created here this morning. There'd be such an expectation. There be be people who are sick and tired of their task masters. There's people that want to get born again. There's people that want to get filled with the Holy Ghost. There's such an atmosphere fear here for salvation, an atmosphere here for uh for for healing. I tell you what, there could be an atmosphere created here that faith can rise up to believe all things. I want to tell you right now, this morning, we are se seated in the realms where all things are possible to them that believe right here in this atmosphere this morning in this church. The supernatural can take place. &gt;&gt; Why? because an atmosphere you know the prophet of God said down in your soul is a predestinated seed which is eternal life. &gt;&gt; It was always there &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will come. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come. That means you're not going to just come halfway. &gt;&gt; You're not going to only come part of the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to come all the way because he said you're going to come all the way. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to maybe just move into some very familiar things. And maybe if we just need to act like we've never heard it before, &gt;&gt; but we've allowed things to become common to us. &gt;&gt; And and just what was on my heart is talking about the evidence of salvation and how a spooky spirit tries tries to to to rob you of it. My my heart for you young people I is is yes. Yes yes yes you are the bride of Jesus Christ. Yes, God has given you a promise and yes, God has promised you the Holy Ghost and and and maybe you're in a stage of justification or sanctification and you're believing for the the Holy Ghost. But I want to tell you I in in all of those stages, it's all the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's the word. It's the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's all a work of God in your life. And when God starts to move into your life, if if we start to doubt the word and doubt our experience and doubt our weapon, then the devil can corner you and he can start to discourage you and he can and you know what you instead of you going forward all a sudden you stop. And I can't tell you countless uh uh young people that that will come and and I'm not discouraging you to do that. You do that. I we we want to pray with you. We want you to come. You show who side that you're on. And many times they come for prayer and and what's on their heart is like I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost. I I you know I I might I want to tell you young people I I've come to the same conclusion after serving God for 101 15 years and knowing I got the Holy Ghost and knowing I've been changed and then I make some bad decision and do some things I shouldn't do and then I look into the word I'm like &gt;&gt; and then the prophet preach a message in such a way and I'm like man I brother Donnie I don't even know if I got it. Right? &gt;&gt; I mean, my goodness gracious, this is, &gt;&gt; wow, how could I ever be that? &gt;&gt; And then I go, &gt;&gt; okay, well, what what what happens if I don't got it? &gt;&gt; I mean, am I going to go back to the world? &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie, you know what? I realized I couldn't live it, so I'm just going to go down the Baptist church. &gt;&gt; Hey, what's your options? &gt;&gt; Like, really? &gt;&gt; What's your options? The problem is is we want the devil &gt;&gt; to give us options. &gt;&gt; Okay. What happens if I ain't got the Holy Ghost? Well, &gt;&gt; I'm going to repent of my sins. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say, Lord, you started the work. &gt;&gt; And you'll finish that work. &gt;&gt; And you said, if I repent of my sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And God is not a man that he shall lie. and Lord, if you never do another thing for me, you've already done enough for me. And then I start kind of feeling pretty good. And I realize, you know what? I maybe I messed up. But my Bible tells me my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world. So whether I got it now or whether I get it tomorrow or whether I had it yesterday, it really don't matter because this thing is rigged. I am going in a rapture. I got a promise of the Holy Ghost. I got a promise of victory. Hallelujah. That old devil, you old spooky spirit trying to rob these young people of the evidence of salvation, of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Somebody here ought to just get mad and say, "You old devil. You old spooky spirit. You've lied to me long enough. How you like me now? I got it. I got it. I got the evidence. Shut up in my bones. Glory. [applause] Now you can start walking &gt;&gt; because as soon as you listen to something that's not in the word, it stops your progress. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe I You know what? What? What's Nelly? Remember Nelly had a real experience? &gt;&gt; You know, she's walking down the road and all a sudden, oh, you know, &gt;&gt; high school prom, dance, friends, neighbor. &gt;&gt; Nowadays, it's all on your phone, Instagram, old friend went to school with. I'll see how they're doing. I'll like their profile. I'll just see what it's all about. I'll just stop for a moment. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you're pulled into some atmosphere. You're pulled into some temptation. And all of a sudden, you're in the arms of another man. And she came to herself. And I tell you what, people want to condemn Nelly Nelly Sanders. But you know what? She knew where to go. &gt;&gt; She didn't run down to the Baptist church. She didn't run down to this. You know, she said, "I'm going to go to the prophet of God. She ran on down to the prophet and said, "Oh, brother Brandon, brother Brandon, Brother Brandon, I messed up. I really made a mistake. I really messed up now. I've ruined it." Prophet took her. And he started to pray for her. And he started to rebuke that spirit. And you know what he said? He said, "You old Satan, you old devil. She didn't mean to do it. Hey young people, a lot of you didn't mean to do it. You were trapped into it when you showed up here. You didn't mean to give into those lust devils and all those things. There was just a nature hanging on you. You didn't mean to do it. But a vindicated prophet said, "Satan, you take your hands off of her. I claim her for the glory of Almighty God. And I will stand here this morning. I will claim every young person, every daughter and son of God for the glory of Almighty." Satan, you take your hands off these young people. They are free to serve God with all of their heart, with all of their life, with all of their soul. They've been pro promised the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They can put every devil, every demon, every suicide, every complex under their feet. Why? They've been predestinated to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, what about it, church? &gt;&gt; In an atmosphere like this, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Why wait any longer? &gt;&gt; We're more than able. &gt;&gt; I want to bring some evidence. [gasps] We listen to the devil so much. We listen to some spooky spirits and we've been ministering about the evidence of salvation, the Holy Ghost, and how Satan's always wanting to rob you of that. But what do you have to do first? You got to believe. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. The real invisible union, the real genuine eagles here. My sheep know my voice. A stranger they won't follow. Why? It was put in there by predestination. You were for ordained to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; You were in God before the foundation of the world. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I can still get excited. &gt;&gt; I can I can't even comprehend that, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; Call me a nut. Call me a lunatic. Call me a fanatic. I believe it. Something in here is more real than my five senses. It's more real than my emotions. It's more real than all of the other things. There's another uh sense, the sixth sense of faith that when I hear that, oh, glory to God, that's my reality. [applause] &gt;&gt; All right, all the young people in here, raise your hand. I mean, if the change is on, it's going the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I know time's speeding up, but come on. You walked in at 15 and now you're 50. &gt;&gt; Come on, all you young people, raise your hands. &gt;&gt; If you're 30 and under, raise your hand. We got some that are over and they're already claiming their promise. Glory, I haven't lost one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, God is speaking to you and and we we could go into it, but we take for granted that we live under the revelation of Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; I can't express enough of how privileged we are &gt;&gt; to hear a vindicated prophet. not not a gift of prophecy, &gt;&gt; but a very mouthpiece piece of God &gt;&gt; to tell you his thoughts of you. &gt;&gt; This is God's mind to you young people. &gt;&gt; And I want you to believe it &gt;&gt; because when we catch a revelation of these things, it it doesn't matter what comes or goes. You have an anchor. You have an absolute. &gt;&gt; And you're not subject to to trends and fashions and emotions. Yes, we're going to have hurt feelings. We're going to have broken hearts. There's a lot of things on this side that mold our character. You know, Brother Brandham said you, you know, it's it is joy. It is wonderful. But, you know, it's it's also a way of agony and suffering. So, we're not taking away from those things. You're going to have to go through hard times and through journey. But when you have a revelation in your soul to know God's thoughts towards you, it's the victory. &gt;&gt; All right, so some familiar things. We got some young people here. We'll try to move quickly. It is Sunday. We only got one service. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's all right, brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; You were fore orained to a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. You're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory. How can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God? Yes, sir. Which you are a part of that word by predestination. Because look, the God God is the word. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Well, if he always was the word, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God, then you were in God. the word. The part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world. He seen you. He knew you. He predestinated you to it. &gt;&gt; The part that you're to play. &gt;&gt; You are actually playing out a part &gt;&gt; that was predestinated in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; He knew your stature. He knew how tall. He knew how short. He knew how wide. And I want to tell you, we might laugh and chuckle at those things, but Satan does a lot of damage with the characteristics. Look, I should have given up a long time ago with a nose this big, &gt;&gt; but God knew how I would show up. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we got to embrace that part of the revelation, too. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because we'll battle complexes, &gt;&gt; generational curses. Why does my family have to be this way? Why is this all God knew exactly how you would show up? Look, look, when you do a play, you pick people to fit the part, &gt;&gt; right? So, something was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. He knew, I'm going to pick you. I'm going to pick you. I'm going to pick you. You're exactly what I want to be in the end time. and Lady Oia to prove to the God of the evil age. You might have come into my Eden in the beginning, but I sent my pride into Satan's Eden and she's going to tear your kingdom down. He knew the way you would show up. He knew how tall. He knew how short you would be. He knew the generational curses. He knew the things that you would struggle. But he predestinated you. He wrote your name on the Lamb's book of life. And he said, "Here she is, right on time, right on quue. Play your part, church. [cheering] Play your part. Play it with all [screaming] of your heart. With everything that's in you, play your part. [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when churches do plays, you know, they pick different people to do parts. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember we did a church play one time and [sighs] we had a brother in our church named Brother Towanda. And I don't know how he got the part, but he got to be a palm tree. And you know, I'm kind of glad I didn't get that part. But some people want that part. Some people want the part behind the curtains. &gt;&gt; I'll do the sound. I'll I'll sew the things together, but I ain't getting out on that stage. But whatever part you're predestinated to play and you know, I I got I got to thinking about that when I read that quote. It said, "The part you play." I started thinking about church plays. And I remember thinking about a play that was done at Louisiana camp maybe some 25 years ago or something like that. And I got the image in my head because, you know, they they picked Brother Eli Arbagast. If any of you know your big old tall brother, you know, we always knew who was playing Goliath. it was brother Eli, you know, so they picked him and then they picked some brothers, you know, to be David and and I was laughing about that and then it reminded me here not too long ago. I was having some fellowship with brother Matt Morris and and somehow that came up and he goes, "You know what?" He goes, "I was the rock and I got to and I was in my study and I got to think about I started laughing it and I sent brother Matt I sent brother Matt the the the text. said, "Man, I got to think in that play about and about, you know, about how how Goliath had to play his part and and and and you know, David had to play his part and how you played the rock." And he text me back and said, "Somebody had to do it." I tell you what, I actually got a noise complaint from the office downstairs because I realized, "Hey, somebody got to play the part. If I'm going to be the rock, I don't care what it is. Let me be a rock in his hand. Go ahead and put me in your sling, Lord. Throw me at every giant, every devil. I'll knock them out. I'll knock them down. As long as I'm on your hand. I don't care what part I play. As long as it's the part that the Lord Jesus wants me to play. &gt;&gt; Play your part, church. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You don't get all dressed up and memorize your lines and rehearse everything and then it comes time for your part. &gt;&gt; Oh no. We all go through it. I'm going to forget my lines. How many have ever got up to sing a song special and my goodness, your mind just goes blank. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we feel like that. We've we've gone to church. We've we've had the experience and everything and then in the moment or whatnot. Don't worry. He said, "I'll be with you even in you. The conductors right there. If you lose your lines here, here's the sheet music. &gt;&gt; I got the sheet music right here. &gt;&gt; If you forgot, just get back. Turn on a tape. &gt;&gt; If you forget, get into your Bible. If you forget, get into prayer. He's right there. &gt;&gt; Good time. &gt;&gt; Look, dress rehearsal's over. &gt;&gt; Time of playing games is over. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; This is time to go home. &gt;&gt; I mean, we we are right on the cusp. Even brother Donnie shared this morning. And I think right now uh the pope made some allegiance with with with you know the ecumenical council. Everything's tightening up. It's all coming together. Look, Satan's getting his superman and the world and all the ecumenical councils and everything's you what it's a uniting time and sign. The world's uniting. Christianity is re uniting. Everything out there's uniting. The devil's reuniting. Everything's uniting. But oh, glory to God. There is a bride and she is uniting under the headship of the word, the Lord Jesus Christ. And what are we uniting with? We're uniting with the word. [screaming] What are we uniting for? The rapture. [applause] Oh, hallelujah. It's time to play your part. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about that. Here stoods David. You know, David had to play his part. And here's Goliath standing there making his boast. We'll try to just bring this towards a close by the help of God somehow. So, here's here's Goliath. He's making his boast. And to think that the armies of the living God, they they had forgot who they were. They were letting their own enemy, the the the the the devil, just stand there and defy the armies of the living God. But I love what the prophet of God said. He said, you know, his boast happen to fall on the wrong ears. &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. It's time to quit listening to that boast. And when he starts talking to do something about it, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, you're going to get me. I'm going to get you. &gt;&gt; And you take the sword of the word. So here them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them that challenge came upon David's ears but you know what David was predestinated to meet the challenge &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; David had the victory before he even showed up &gt;&gt; what about you &gt;&gt; before you even showed up in Lady Oia the playwright was already written Your part was already chosen. It was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world world. You just showed up to manifest your part. And you are the victorious bride of Jesus Christ. There ain't no Goliath. There ain't no devil that can stop you. You already had the victory when you showed up. Look, that's what the prophet of God said about David. He already had the victory when he got there. So, he didn't come into the battle hanging his head. He come into that battle dancing and swinging that sling. He said, "You come into and defy the name of the Lord with your gods and the Philistine armies, but I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." He went dancing right into that battle and he had that rock of faith and he slung that right out and knocked that devil down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I said, "What about you?" The prophet of God said this, he knowed where he was at. Hallelujah. Everyone sitting here, you're person you, everyone sitting here tonight, you're positionally in Christ. God has confirmed it. election, calling, anointing, placing. &gt;&gt; He elected you and called you. He elected you and called you. &gt;&gt; Then he anointed you with the Holy Spirit. And now he's placed you in the body of Christ. Each one of you is David's. &gt;&gt; Where's the Goliath? Who's the Goliath, Brother Brandham? That cancer that's eating you up. That tumor that's hanging on you, them cataracts on your eyes, that crippled arm, every little thing looks at it and says it can't be done. The devil says you might as well quit believing. You might as well settle down because you never can no more get well. Your doctor said so. All of the rest of them said so. You can't get well. But the Christ that made you stop your drinking, your smoking, your lying, and stealing that saved you from a life of drunkenness, from riing, from a sin and a devil's grave is if God can do that for you, he can save you from your TV. He can save you from your cancer. He's the Goliath. Don't take his boast. Stand in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and challenge him to a showdown. Amen. I feel religious positionally. You are in Christ. If the believer knowed his position, he'd have it. God's great spirit is here. And his Holy Ghost is ready to fall on anybody that will believe. Do you believe? Do you believe? Hey church, play your part. You're anointed for the job. Hallelujah. [applause] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; I'm a winner and you're a loser. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven and you're going to hell. Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Facts. &gt;&gt; Facts. predetermined. &gt;&gt; I'm just playing my part. &gt;&gt; So, don't mind me. &gt;&gt; I'm just happy about the part God gave me to play. &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a palm tree. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a sinner. &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a drunk. He didn't call you to be in bondage. He didn't call you to lust after those last devils. He called you to be an overcoming son and daughter of God to put every devil and every disease and every sickness under your feet. I say, "Boo devil. I'm going to play my part and I'm going to believe [screaming] with all of my heart. I'm not basing it upon what I see. I'm not basing upon the past and I'm not basing on the future. I'm basing it on what he said. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; For my Bible tells me in Romans 8:28, "And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, &gt;&gt; whom he did predestinate then he also called. Is anybody hearing the call of God? &gt;&gt; May maybe maybe you you maybe right now you feel like you don't got the Holy Ghost and there's no hope for you. But do you feel God pulling upon your heart? &gt;&gt; You feel the call of God on your life. Listen to this. This is powerful. &gt;&gt; This right here will give you victory. &gt;&gt; You can whoop the devil with this. &gt;&gt; Come on. Have we forgot &gt;&gt; how powerful this thing is? &gt;&gt; It's so powerful. When our Lord was here, &gt;&gt; he used it &gt;&gt; to whip the devil. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, I come from the same material. &gt;&gt; So then I'll just take the same old Bible, &gt;&gt; same word. God's called you. If there's a call of God upon your life, &gt;&gt; them he's also called. Them he's also justified. And them he's also Them he's also justified. Them he's also glorified. &gt;&gt; I told you it's rigged. &gt;&gt; David picking up out of Why Christ speak. David would say, "The God that delivered me from the lion, the God that delivered me from the paws of that bear, he'll more than deliver me from that Philistine." Now, put whatever it is you're battling right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The God that justified me, the God that called me, he's the God that'll fill me with the Holy Ghost, he'll deliver me from that problem, here I come. I meet you in the name of the Lord, God of Israel. Amen. He prophet of God said he didn't pray through. He was already prayed through. God prayed him through before the foundation of the world. He was anointed for the job. He just had to speak and go forward. Glory to God. Hey, I might have messed up and forgot to pray this morning. But praise the name of the living God. He already prayed me through before the foundation of the world. So maybe I didn't dot all my eyes and cross all my tees and I walked into a problem and maybe I didn't get prayed up and I wasn't listening to tape. But you know what? It doesn't change that I'm a son of God. I can look that devil right in the face and say, "You know what? I made a misstep. I made a mistake. But Jesus Christ prayed me through before the foundation of the world. And I'll still whip you, devil [applause] &gt;&gt; because the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said it's here and stronger I and greater than it ever was in the true word bride. &gt;&gt; He said hold on to that word. Fill your heart and your mouth with it. Just going to work towards a close quickly. We got to do weapons. We got to fight with this. &gt;&gt; Some some of the some of the greatest scriptures uh that have done me the most good is my Bible tells me there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So then we allow condemnation and we allow those things to paralyze us. &gt;&gt; I I I did it again. I &gt;&gt; I did it again. I I feel like I can't even sing. Second, you know what? All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; And if you made a mistake, then we need more of God to overcome it the next time. &gt;&gt; You repent and you get up and that feeling. Now, there's a difference between conviction and condemnation. &gt;&gt; And the devil's pretty sly. He'll try to make you mix up the two. &gt;&gt; Conviction will lead you to repentance. &gt;&gt; Condemnation will hold you in sin. Yes, sir, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You fall to a temptation, I just, you know, I'll make it right later. No, be quick to repent. &gt;&gt; Be zealous to repent. That's the That's what should be for the age. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said the the the zealous to say, I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Somehow that went out of the maybe went out of some of the churches a long time ago. They they &gt;&gt; I'm right. Everybody else is wrong. Some people, they're so right. No, we we need to be quick to repent, &gt;&gt; you know, and if you feel something condemning you and and it's it's keeping you from the promises of God, it's keeping you from wanting to pray. It's keeping you from wanting to re, you know, you know, you're like, what what is it? But but conviction should say, oh God, I'm so sorry. It should drive you to your knees in repentance. &gt;&gt; There's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. Oh my, those are promises that bring you through hard times and trials as you're growing in the stature of a perfect man. And brother Bandham said this in the invisible union. He said, "He, the bridegroom, took away your shame." &gt;&gt; Just a few more moments. And put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. That's what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Your first husband that you were married to the world, &gt;&gt; right? We don't have to go into that. We We got a picture, right? &gt;&gt; Young people, are you seeing that first nature that's been warning against you? &gt;&gt; Can you see it better now? &gt;&gt; Why Paul said you got to be married to another? That first husband that you were married to, the world, the anointed bridegroom, which for ordained you, has washed you by the washing of the water, by the church, &gt;&gt; by your good works, &gt;&gt; by your impeccable standing and your impeccable attendance to Word of Life Church. by your knowledge of the message. &gt;&gt; By how many tapes you've memorized, &gt;&gt; by how well you've been able to study out and explain the Bible. &gt;&gt; Oh, are the signs and wonders that you've performed or how powerful your gift is. &gt;&gt; No, that that no, that don't sound right. &gt;&gt; Remember, we already went through that on Friday. Salvation is of the Lord. It's not salvation plus your good works. &gt;&gt; It's not Christ plus. It's Christ alone. From start to finish, salvation is of the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, that that don't sound right, does it? You might find that in the Almanac, but it's not in God's Bible. By the washing of the water, by the word. In the word. And I want to tell you that's why God sent a vindicated prophet to restore the word and to restore the faith back to the original word. &gt;&gt; Because without the opening of the seals, it's a closed book. &gt;&gt; And it's the very revelation of the age, the word of our age that's washing you. &gt;&gt; Is that all right, brother Donnie? &gt;&gt; You You can't find it any other place. So listen now. He says, "You are standing completely justified." That's right. &gt;&gt; As though you never did it at the beginning. Now I just asked the musicians to come to help me bring this towards a close. [snorts] I I I enjoyed that song, I've been changed. I believe it's even in the lyrics says no more shame. But think about this. I say, "What a what what a message. What a word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That could take a sinner. &gt;&gt; And pluck them out of the muck and mire and not only wash them up and and cleanse them up, but by the revelation of it, not a partial revelation under Luther. No, this is the full revelation of justification, &gt;&gt; which means you never did it in the first place. That ought to set somebody free here this morning. &gt;&gt; The devil's been trying to make you feel guilty. He's been trying to put condemnation on you. Maybe you feel like you lost your virtue and no one's ever going to love you right and you'll never be able to uh uh fit. And the devil's trying to rub your nose and all of your past and all your failures and all your mistakes. But if you're hearing the call of God, God is God is calling to you. And right now by the full revelation of justification, a vindicated prophet is telling you that you are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. Oh, praise the wonderful name of the living God. It doesn't matter about my past. It doesn't matter about my sin. It doesn't matter about what that spooky spirit has tried to tell me. God has syndicate a vindicated word, a vindicated message to tell me you are perfect. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in perfect faith said then the only thing you have to do is believe what you are. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what you are. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you are. Play your part. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you are. &gt;&gt; You are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Now, just picking this up out of Christ, the mystery of God revealed. Justified in his sight. Why are we justified? We are his victory. &gt;&gt; I'm the proof. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence &gt;&gt; justified. Why are why are we justified? We are his victory. The church is his victory. We come forth in the last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory. He died for this purpose. And we are proof of his victory. Amen. And when we see him coming down and living among the church, that's his victories shows that they couldn't keep him in the grave. Neither can they keep us. That's right. We're bound, right? And we're already potentially arised because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominations and creeds to an eternal word of the eternal God which is himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday, today and forever. [screaming] You are his victory. You are the proof of his resurrection. You are the very proof of the message of the hour. Where is the Welsh revival? Where is the bride revival? I am the bride. Where is the message of the hour? I am the message of the hour. I am the proof of Malachi 4:5. I am the proof of Revelations 10 1-7. Why? Because I'm the very spoken word that has taken on flesh in the evening time. I am the evidence. [applause] Hallelujah. Why don't you praise God? Praise God for the evidence. Praise God for the Holy Ghost. Praise God for the message. [applause] He sent back the evidence, the Holy Ghost, and I got it. &gt;&gt; We know that song. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I feel pretty good. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know what I used to be. But then I heard a message. &gt;&gt; It's not where you belong. &gt;&gt; It's not what you're here for. &gt;&gt; You're not here for a career. &gt;&gt; You're not here for some job. &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose &gt;&gt; because God thought of you &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And he loved you. And he thought of you and he said, "You know what? &gt;&gt; I want to have a bride. And I'm going to I'm going to place her right at the very climax of my great play and great drama. &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, they played their part out in the beginning and on down through the patriarchs of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and on down through Elijah and Elisha and David and all the judges. And they all played all the way down to John the Baptist. And here come the word made flesh himself. &gt;&gt; And he played his part as far as a redeemer. and he he laid his life down with us and then he sent the evidence back. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that it's no longer it's I that liveth in you, you and me and I in you. &gt;&gt; You were made for more. &gt;&gt; Some of us, you just need to walk away from that prison house you've been in. &gt;&gt; The rat race of Lady Oia. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the intellectual exercise of trying to make the message work, &gt;&gt; it'll drive you mad. &gt;&gt; It'll drive you insane. &gt;&gt; And there's there's plenty of casualties of people who have tried to make all the quotes fit together. You can't do it. &gt;&gt; You got to say, "Lord, I believe it." &gt;&gt; Walk away from the unbelief. Just call out to the name of the Lord. Say, Lord, I want the Holy Ghost to energize my soul &gt;&gt; that I can play my part. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song. I've been changed. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I've been changed [singing] here [music] free.

Please pray for Wanda Batman. She's in the ER with severe pain. Also, please pray for Josh and Megan Collins son Dawson. They ordered an echo tomorrow on his heart to check for any abnormalities. Every time you come off of seat pad, he struggles. Now, we believe the power of God that we've been feeling here ain't just good to make us feel good. &gt;&gt; It's not here just to stir our emotions. And it does stir our emotions. &gt;&gt; But we believe he ministers to the needy today. &gt;&gt; Can we pray together right now? And &gt;&gt; maybe somebody else didn't get personally ministered to today and you have a need. Just say, "Lord, be mindful of me. Would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for this wonderful time that we've had together, this visitation, Lord, of your presence here today. We thank you for these youth meetings. And we realize, Lord, it just wasn't for the youth, but we believe it's for all of us. Lord, you see, Lord Jesus, these needs that we've read. And Father, we're praying today that you'd move our sister Wanda Bman. You see the pain that she's dealing with and you know the cause of it. Lord, we pray, Father, for Dawson Collins and we're asking for your mercy for him. Dear Jesus, may your hand be extended, Lord. I know it's hundreds of miles away from us. They're in Ohio. But we know, dear God, there's no distance to you. Father, every individual here today that has a need in their home, their life, their family, would you move for them, Jesus? We pray that you'd restore our brother Matt's strength. Lord, we thank you, Father, for using him today to be a blessing to us Friday, yesterday as well. We're so grateful, Lord Jesus. We believe that we are living testimonies that Calvary was a success. &gt;&gt; May you go with us now, Lord. The food that's been prepared, may you bless it, nourish it our bodies. We ask, Lord God, in the name of Jesus. How many can say it's been really good to be in the house of the Lord? [applause] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God bless you. Thank you, brother Matt. God bless you. May God restore his strength. And you keep this in mind as you go today. Maybe you're a little bit weary, a little bit down. You've been through a lot of things and may have had mistakes and failures, but keep this in mind in the coming days, will you? Your name is already there. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your name &gt;&gt; is waiting on you &gt;&gt; to get there. &gt;&gt; And God don't make no mistakes. [applause] Your name is there. Amen. [applause] Bless you. Sing some. We'll be dismissed. God bless you. Thank you so much for attending [music] the services this week for the youth from the different churches and the different adults, parents, and so on that came with your children. [music] Thank you. God bless you. We trust that the Lord will just be with each of you. Keep us until we meet again. God bless you. It won't be long [music] till we'll [singing] be leaving [music] here. It won't be long. We'll be going [singing] [music] home. It won't be long. [music] God bless you. Go in the fear of God till [music] we'll be leaving [singing] you. It won't be long.

We'll be going home. [music] It won't be long. [music] You're dismissed in the fear of the Lord till we'll believe [music] in him. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We'll be [singing] going home. [music] Count the years as months. Count the months [singing] as [music] weeks. Count the weeks [music and singing] as days. Any day now, we'll [singing and music] be going home.
