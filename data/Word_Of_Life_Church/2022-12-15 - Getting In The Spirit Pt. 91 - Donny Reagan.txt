it's wonderful knowing you that way in life but oh Lord after a while we are going to be even happier if we can imagine him when this world is a rocket and shaken and the stars have fallen from heaven the vultures will be called to eat people's flesh we will be so glad we've been hid in the Rock of Ages so let us be reproached let people laugh at us make fun of us whatever more hide us O Lord God in your great covet of your wings speak to us tonight father would you counted an honor to be gathered together again and sense your presence help us tonight father as we Endeavor to look into your word granted I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you it ain't wonderful to be in the house of the Lord turn with them if you would to Revelation chapter 19 verse 11. now let me just give you a little heads up where we are for those that are living in the end time you're either going to be at supper or you're going to be supper quite simple you're either going to be at supper or you're going to be supper now without hearing my sermon I think anybody in the right mind wants to know which side you want to be on right you don't want to be supper I think they ought to sing some more of them songs it was beautiful let me sing it and we we realize as far as the majority of the world's concerned Jesus has really nothing to do with Christmas anyway but I trust we're not like that but we know that he couldn't have raised from the dead if he hadn't been first born you couldn't raise from the dead if he hadn't died we know that and we're certainly grateful that he came to the Earth but with that being said we're so grateful that he's coming back Revelation chapter 19 verse 11. Lord William Brother David salner be with us this Sunday speaking for us so we come expecting the Lord to speak to our hearts we love and appreciate mother David and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war is a terrible thing most of the time and that's because most wars are made for selfish motives selfish objectives and it's not for Godly principles but the Lord Jesus never makes a war with such principles now please listen to me don't misunderstand me sometimes Servants of God have to declare war they do they have to declare war on the worldliness they have to declare war on false doctrines and and different things but if they're true Servants of God they're doing it for Godly motives and godly objectives I see when you look at the Lord Jesus you can see that John said he that said upon Him must call faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns which mean he had many victories and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was closed with a vesture dipped in blood now of course one symbol after the other after the other a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God now his name is not the word of God in this instance but his name is rather called the word of God notice in verse 14 and the armies which were in heaven wow so there's more than one the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fine linen White and clean may the Lord bless his word you may be seated here is the symbol of the final victory to be obtained over the Beast over the false prophet and the Triumph of the church and who is leading this Mighty Conquest the Lord Jesus himself by this time the world has almost been annihilated there's been Atomic Warfare that has destroyed Rome but yet there's some characters here that are still living now let me just go ahead and be honest with you tonight I can't say that I know who all the characters and the Revelation in the Book of Revelation are because they switch back and forth and go from one symbol and one type to another some of them are quite plain others of them aren't them but I find this part of this passage of scripture quite amazing because he's coming to annihilate somebody somebody is fixing to experience the wraths and the word of God and as we all know if he's got killing on his mind ain't no place you can hide so I don't want to be on that side that he's looking for you now there's a division of what he's going to conquer and who he's going to conquer he's coming to be able to annihilate the Beast and the false prophet which are not the same they are actually going to be thrown into the Lake of Fire which burns with fire and brimstone but yet that's not the devil because the devil will reappear in a thousand years so we've got the symbol of the Beast we've got the symbol of the false prophet the Roman papal Authority by this time has already been annihilated because of the prophecy that was fulfilled as we saw in Revelation 18. so John focuses on what he sees coming open and he saw the heavens open and Revelation 4 he saw the heavens open and the bride went up and Revelation 19 he saw the heavens opened and he saw the bride and the bridegroom come down so it depends on which cycle it is when Heaven opens because it's like it's opens the curtains as it was and the scene changes from one thing to another now John says he that set upon him was called faithful and true so he doesn't designate him by his name Lord Jesus Jesus Christ or Lord Jesus Christ but he designates him by certain characteristics and traits by which he wants us to know who he is so he's faithful and he's true and then John says and righteousness doth he judge and make war now all of his acts of judgment are determining of course the destiny of men I realize we're living in an age whenever the liberal teachers and the liberal false prophets and sad to say but even some in the message they want to preach all about Grace and mercy and forgiveness and tolerance and so on and so on and to preach about judgment and the wraths of God well you're really not duck well you're looking at one real odd duck tonight because that's what I'm going to preach about because I still believe that God is going to execute wraths on the unbelievers and annihilate the wicked now if people in the message fall into that category they'll be burnt up just like the whoremongers just like the pedophiles just like the homosexuals and everybody else so you're not going to hide behind the shelter or I believe God sent a prophet anybody could say that from their mouths and still not obey what he said so you're not going to be free from the wraths of God in the last days because you're setting in a message Church you're going to be free from the wraths of God because you have got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the blood of the Lord Jesus speaks for your soul and when God hears that petition of yours he doesn't even hear your prayer he hears the voice of the Lord Jesus that's wonderful is it not now notice John says that he's going to come to judge and to make war now the war which he wages as I said is not a war of ambition it is not a war to be able to take over somebody's property he's not like Putin to where he wants the Ukraine he's not like Napoleon where he wanted this land and that land he's not like many of the Great conquests that have been down through time but it is a war but it is a war which will be sent forth in righteousness and this war was decreed by almighty God himself and I'm glad to say tonight I believe we are going to be in the side of the right when this war begins the purpose of this Conquest is not to take people's wives people's children it's not to take their gold their silver their land their houses or their property but it is to execute the rest of God on those who have turned down his mercy and when we finally turn down his Mercy for now at this stage even the foolish virgin the church the denominational system has moved out of her into him now you see while it's still in her the prophet tells us there is Mercy but if your name is found on that stalk book when he comes too late it will be and once it moves out of her into him and him as Satan of course then it will be too late there will be no more Mercy for the Gentiles but while there's yet Mercy even though people people are in a denomination God can still deal with them and call them out of that system as he did US is that right so shine your life wherever you are let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven notice the way Jesus said that that he didn't say they would hear your doctrine that they will tell you how you can explain this or explain that but they would see your good works and they would glorify God by seeing God inside of your life but now when it reaches Revelation 19 he's come now not in Mercy he's not come to be able to give people one last time a pardon no the world has already crossed the line between mercy and judgment so now he's come to make war now friend I know all of us have had great battles with the devil we've had tremendous battles with demon spirits and we've all had these things that we've dealt with our entire walk with God as Christians but let me tell you none of that would even compare to having God against you and just remember Satan is against you hell is against you people are against you but I'd rather have all of them against me than God against me because there's no winning when God is against you now Christ and his armies are riding force in this conquest of Victory notice how John describes him and this of course goes into the Sevenfold personage of his deity in verse 12 his eyes were as a flame of fire and he on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but himself and he was clothed with a vesture that was dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God now what we see is actually the ushering end of the great day now God is showing John a symbol of how a conqueror would have wrote in in this days of John so John sees him in this vision and he sees the the Lord Jesus setting upon this great white charger and he sees as it would have been in and that day the apparel of the time so a conqueror would have come through and he would had a vesture and unlike this one which was dipped in blood it would have been gold and silver maybe if he'd taken Libya and Morocco and many different places he would have taken taken a jewel from the crown of the king of Morocco he would have taken one from the diadem of maybe the princess of Mesopotamia and then he would have this engraved in his armor so when he come in he would sit there and they would have this long flowing garment and he would have his name actually embroidered in His Garment as it would flow down both sides so then when he would set upon this horse they would have his britches as it was and he would have His Garment parted here at the waist part of it going down this side part of it going down this side a crown it would have a gem from this Crown a Ruby from this Crown all of them were signifying his great conquest and his victory and there he would have as it was Napoleon Bonaparte or Julius Caesar or whoever it was but this one here he comes and his name is called the word of God notice as John sees this and the prophet picks it up in the uh patmosphere in the church each book and he said today is certainly not the Lord's day but this is man's day it's man's doing man's work man's Church man's idea of worship man's everything for it is man's world Cosmos but the day of the Lord is coming I mean he understands the day of the Lord is not here yet but it is coming yes it is it is just at this time of the revelation of Jesus Christ that John is caught up in the spirit and transported by the spirit into the great day of his coming so John was actually by the spirit of God caught up into the fourth dimension where the prophets would see their Visions in the fourth dimension of course is where television Wives come through radio waves where many any of these waves if they finally broke into it's the same Dimension where sicknesses are and in that Dimension it's like there's no tomorrow no yesterday you have access to all of that that's why a prophet could look there and see a woman standing before him 60 years old by Vision he can look back and see her 12. and said I see you running you're coming home from school you've got on the yellow check address I see you run up on the porch there's a dog after you you'll open the door you fall through the door and it caused a fear on you and you've dealt with that fear your entire life now he would go back in time and see her as a little girl then he sees her as she is and then he sees her as she will be and he watches as the vision keeps on and he can say thus saith the Lord but your well why because he could see an older woman and he didn't see the end of her life at the age of 60 that she was so John is now caught up into the day of the Lord Lord so John is seeing what we're fixing to experience 2 000 years ago he saw it the Lord's Day is when the day of man is over the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of our God the day of the Lord is when the judgments fall think what a paradox the day of the Lord is when the judgments fall oh brother sister let me be hidden Jesus Christ and after that comes the Millennium right now the world does what it wants to with the Christian they called him all manner of evil names making fun of him but there's coming a great and notable day they will wail and howl for the notable day will come and the lamb is coming to judge the world what a paradox that the lamb is coming to judge the world now the way the majority of Christendom preaches the lamb the only way they preach him is in Mercy and in forgiveness and he tolerates everything in the world my goodness time they get done with all the Toleration of abomination they're every single in the world will walk down Heaven There won't even be no separation between right and wrong everybody lives like the devil and lives like hell and then whenever they do whatever of the day whether it's a country music singer or a Hollywood star a rock and roll star they want some preacher to preach them in the gates I'll preach them in the gates too cause sheol in Hades well if you don't live right you're not walking down the streets of gold I don't care who you are that's exactly like come on somebody say Amen if you want to get to heaven you've got to live a Godly life my mind but you see it's the age of man now watch it goes on to say the wicked shall burn and the righteous shall walk over their ashes into the Millennium and then he quotes Malachi 4 3 you shall tread down the wicked and they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this says the Lord of hosts now you know this is Malachi 4 3. well I'm so glad Malachi 4 3 that part don't apply to me but Malachi 4 5 and 6 does so pick out whichever verse you want I pick out five and six that's me now watch it you know it was something that God got several of the Old Testament prophets into this same vision and even though they would record various parts of what was going to happen but many of them Isaiah Joel I become second of zephanage Zechariah many of them they use this same terminology the day of the Lord they knew there was a time coming but God only showed them part of it and they wasn't really sure what it was now whether you're a post-millennious pre-millennious or no millennialist you know when it comes right down to it we have to come back and base our Doctrine upon the word of God is that right so it's easy to see why that people would think that there was a post-millennial and a premillennial in other words some will sink the coming of the Lord will be before the Millennium something will be I to the Millennium and I'm talking about some message people too because I'm of us asked a few years ago by a young group of people in the message had been born and raised in the message all they knew was the message they wasn't even sure and they asked me the question Harry was that with me they wasn't even sure if the Rapture was going to be before the Millennium or after them I thought what a shame they've been born and raised in the message and they don't even know when it's going to be well I'll tell you I believe we better know and we better get ready for it now watch Isaiah 13 6 says it this way how ye how isn't that what a dog does isn't that what an animal does so people of course do it too and it's not that they're setting their oh I'm so tore up I'm just oh give me my hanky oh judgment is coming oh mud the Earth is going to be burned up they will scream they will holler they will how they will lament there's no way we can imagine how bad it's going to be I'm just hoping I'm not preaching to anybody tonight that's going to be here how are you for the day of the Lord is at hand now can you imagine Isaiah prophesied this about 700 years before the Lord Jesus ever come on the earth this has been 27 2800 years ago and he's saying the day of the Lord is going to come and when it does people are going to howl and he said it shall come as a destruction from the almighty verse 9 behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel cruel both with wraths and fierce anger have you ever heard the smiley preacher from Texas preach this the way he preaches it every devil Out of Hell will be saved I believe even all the demons will get saved well I hate to let Mr Smiley know no they won't and a lot of his congregation and him with it if he don't get right ain't going to be there himself well glory to God well come on you know what I'm talking my friends it's a social gospel and the further we get in time the worse it gets everything's gray anymore people don't gonna call this right and call that wrong you bunch a jelly-back Christians and gotten a more standard than that we need to take a stand for God's word and say what God's word said is right man ain't right Church ain't right no Society ain't right but let every word that God said be amen by the saints of God and say God is right and man is wrong I don't care who the man is oh my notice behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel you mean the Lord is going to bring a cruel day cruel both with rats and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of this some of them by nuclear explosion in the time of Rome and the rest of them that are alive will be annihilated by a nuclear fire and some of them their bodies will not be annihilated and totally destroyed and God will invite Birds by the thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands to come and eat them I find this quite a paradox because the first half of Revelation 19 is pointing to the marriage supper the last half of Revelation 19 is pointing to the vulture supper so Revelation 19 is suppertime isn't it amazing that this was not called breakfast time in Revelation 19 why the sun has set him it's the end of man's day so at the setting of the Sun what is the last meal of the day suppertime so God is going to call for all of these birds to come and they will Feast on captains they will Feast on corporals and lieutenants and popes and Bishops and false pastors and false prophets I wish somebody preached with me tonight oh my notice in verse 10 for the stars of Heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their life the sun shall be darkened of his going force and the moon shall not cause her life to shine notice that the sun is masculine gender and the Moon is feminist now I realize that don't go in the woke Society but we don't fit in the woke Society we are in the awoke Society we have been awoken from the dead so I don't want to woke I've been awoke Hallelujah I have been quick and I once was asleep but I'm not asleep no more I got woke up by that Great Mighty angel of Revelation 10. I've heard the voice of the bridegroom say come out of her my people [Applause] now notice this loving gentle wonderful sweet God what he says he'll do I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and I will cause the arrogancy of The Proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the Terrible so you're eating up with pride you better get rid of it you're holding think you're better than somebody else because you're worth more and your house is nicer and you drive a nicer car you better get rid of it this is what God said he's going to do to you after a while well come on children I will make a man more precious than fine gold praise be to God now we're talking about real value I will make a man more precious than find gold even a man more a man that will be even worse more value than the golden wedge of othar so now we're looking at real value that God says I will make one man worse more than gold which people have killed for people have murdered for Kings have conquered for it go right it's been the currency of the world for millennium but God said I'll show you what real value is I'll make one man worse more than go case you see friend why that the Lord Jesus looks at the bride and he values her at such value she's valued Way Beyond rubies and pearls and the wealths and the riches of this world and God gives us an inkling here by the prophet Isaiah that God would come to a Time on the earth that he would have a people on the Earth whose value would surpass look this little gathering of people right here tonight much less all the thousands times thousands that are Washed by the bloody word around the world this little handful of people and it is a small handful come compared to the 8 billion people that are on the Earth but yet we are worse more than Fort Knox 500 000 times over but yet people rubbed shoulders with us every day and they don't see no value in US they don't see that we're worth nothing why a bunch of Knuckleheads wow that's a skirt church this this that and the other but one of these days we're gonna find out I'm worth more than a wedge of old for I'm worth more than a wedge of the bank of Tennessee or the bank of Jonesboro praise the Lord you little Daughters of God you sons of God oh my we got nothing to brag about in our cell but what the Lord God is minting in our soul you see the Lord God is minting in our soul the gold of Christ like character it cannot be held in four knocks it cannot be produced in the Deep minds of South Africa it can only be produced by the grace of God and the predestinated heart that says Lord Make Me Like You make me like you and through the test of God and the battles of life God molds you and he saved you and he makes you and he will have a bride that is worse more than the gold of the world [Applause] oh thank God therefore I will shake the heavens and the Earth shall remove out of her place well of course she has to you see in the original he made her where she stood straight up she was not tilted on her axis in 23.5 degrees the way she is now and actually she wobbles as she spins were it not for the son being on the average of 239 000 miles from the Earth changes somewhat but the Moon is what keeps it in his spot the sun 93 million miles away and the Earth's great orbit being kept in its position if it was not for the moon and the gravitational pull of the moon it would do like a top and it would Spin and spin you notice your kids you probably don't even make them anymore but I remember seeing them at the little tops and you push the button how many has ever seen one like that what year was you born so you pushed that little top how many you got people have absolutely no idea what I'm even talking about you push that little top and it spins and spins but as it slows down it starts going this way and then eventually it'll just turn over that's the way the Earth would be wear it not for the gravitational pull of the moon this is why you need a church and a Godly Pastor because the Moon is like the church and the world will pull you out of orbit and cause you go to wobbling here and wobbling there but the church says all glory The Fellowship of the saints of God and gathering together and a pasture that won't cut Corners well Hallelujah that'll preach the Full Gospel and the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you go to wobbling and getting out of line with it and say hey hey hey hey get back up there tops come on top so stand upright let's stand that pinch Spin and worship God hallelujah so what's going to happen this great nuclear explosion will take place on the Earth and the Earth will go so it'll go oh oh there it goes and all of a sudden it'll go it should be perfectly on her pose again and then we'll have major global warming why it was the same temperature all the way around the Earth that's why they can dig in the Antarctica and all them different places I've still got a piece of shale that brother that brother Bobby Hayden gave me years and years ago I'm sure remembers it it got it out of a coal mine I forget how many feet that it was down that brother Bobby found this and it was a it was a a branch of a fern and just perfectly imprinted in that Shale and you know how deep was it how long had it been that I've told you before but Carol and I went into a gold mine and South Africa went way down a shaft I mean just out down An Elevator Shaft that abandoned coal mine and then you go down and this train ever so far and then they bring it to a spot and then they stop it and then they tell you to look up and when you look up you're looking up like this and it's a gigantic footprint of a dinosaur so here's this dinosaur's footprint right up on the ceiling and no he wasn't laying on his back playing this during the destruction sometime but there it was embedded in the solid rock it speaks of another civilization another world world that was already existed well praise the Lord the thing of it is we don't know how many times this Earth has already been through this cycle and we know the prophet tells us that those seeds there in Genesis 1 that they were there from some former civilization because it types you as the elect of God oh you don't remember it and I don't remember it either but that see Gene inside of you come from another world it existed before you ever existed in this life as a mortal human being it was there in the mind of God you wasn't a boy or a girl walking around of course but you existed in the mind of God but now you are made manifest Hallelujah we were out there wobbling around in the world wobbling around but the spirit of God got a hold of us and shut us up on our north-south axis and he gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he took the wobble out of her singing he took the wobble out of our walking he took the wobble out of our belief in he took the while a lot of our walk with God and set us on a straight path and said come on children come on children follow me back to the promised land so God said I will shake the heavens and the Earth shall remove out of her place in the Wrath of the Lord of hosts you say this is part of what the new birth is like that people don't really like about him they much rather like you just come up and give the minister your hand what in the world do I want with your old dirty Paul don't give me your hand you'll need it give the preacher your hand well I put my name on the church book I've done this or that you've got to die don't you understand the wrath of God has to fall on this Earth before it can become into a new image the wrath of God listen to you must be born again 1961 and you hear how the prophet describes it about coming up to the Altar and there the wraths of God falls on you don't you understand this is why so many people are just accepting an intellectual conception around the message well I believe God sent a prophet and I believe and I believe and I believe and that's all the message is look friend it was not a doctrine that died for us it was not a doctrine that raised from the dead it is not a Doctrine that's coming back after us it was a person that came it was a person that died it was a person that rose again it is a person that's coming back for the bride come on when the Judgment of God falls on your soul at the altar it annihilates you you're finished you don't get up well I'm going to wean myself from a winstons instead of smoking 13 I'm gonna smoke 12 and a half tomorrow and the next week I'll try for 12. and I'm going to get a self-help book for a Christian I'm going to get a self-help book for how to get rid of my porn and a self-help book of how to quit this and quit that I got that self-help book many many years ago and I tell you it don't work you've tried the same one I'm sure it's all altered by the same author the Devil Himself there's only one book that can help ourself it'll need a self-help book it's a self-dye book and it's called the Bible it's not helping yourself that'll do it it's letting yourself die under the rise of God then you can be born anew oh the Judgment of God Must Fall on the Earth the Judgment of God Must Fall on the earth and the heavens will shake and tremble and the earth oh God oh God the Earth has experienced his judgment many times remember I want to know I said that and preached and the Earth repented oh God I'm sorry God I'm sorry God forgive me God forgive me God said all right I accept your repentance and God baptized the Earth hold your nose and here come this big sphere about of this baptismal pool of water but it didn't take long the man got back on it started messing it up again why the Earth didn't get the fire she got the water well Glory some folks around the message got the water and got a tape and thought they got it all once they got that but if you ain't got no fire I'm telling you them tapes by themselves are not going to get you in well preach brother Tony now look Isaiah saw this also on this fold and Isaiah 63 1. who is this that cometh from Edom with God garments from beau's raw who is this that Cometh From Edom with god notice how this is spelled d-y-e-d died so these garments that he has on or died with something well what is it the blood the blood that's amazing because he can appear in a twofold way with garments with blood on them because he appears to the broad this way too but he says he tread The Wine Press of the wrath of God and when the bride looks at him she knows that he did this in a substitutionary way and he's got blood on him because he tread The Grapes of God for her but when John sees him in Revelation 19 he's got died garments on but this time I didn't for the bride he comes and wraths and he's got the blood of his enemies all over him oh my goodness who is this that Cometh From Edom what died garments from Boze roll this that is glorious in his apparel traveling in the greatness of his strength I that speak in righteousness Mighty to say wherefore art thou read in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadst the wine fat now this seems very unusual to us but this is the setting of them making wine so they would take the grapes and when the grapes would get right they would put them in what they called a wine press we saw some of them actually we were Israel and they found one that was very close to the little city of Nazareth and you couldn't keep from thinking my the Lord Jesus may have seen this himself thousands of years old so they would either put another piece of stone on top of it or they would take their shoes off and they would get inside it like this and they were tread on these grapes and they'd smash them and smash them and smash them and keep on smashing and as they begin to squeeze the blood as they called it out of the grapes they would have a little pipe that would come down and you'd go to see a drop a drop another drop two drops three drops four drops and then a little tiny Trickle and then a stream but the thing of it is the person doing the treading is getting that all over them they are becoming part of this and you know Isaiah sees him not so much coming for the bride but he says I am coming to introduce the day of the Lord I am coming to tread upon the wicked Vince you understand one day Johnson City the Holiday Inn Word of Life Church every other building ever sign of civilization will be totally annihilated off the Earth there will be no Great Sphinx or pyramids there will be no Fifth Avenue in New York it will totally be gone oh my notice the question that Isaiah asked this person in verse two wherefore art thou read in thine apparel and thy garments like him that tread Us in the wine fact and then this person answers I have trodden The Wine Press alone and of the people there was none with me for I tread them in my anger and trample them in my Fury and their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments you see this is an attribute of the Lord God the preacher's just more hardly preach about it's like God was this mean tyrant in the Old Testament and then the New Testament God went up to an altar some words that I need to repent oh I'm a bad God I'm a mean God I'm a hateful contrario God I think I'll go to my boy you know he's so kind and I'm so mean so I'm going to go to my little boy and say little boy would you please save me you heathen this is prophecy and it lays right in front of us look the parallels how close they are so here in this setting he has the blood of people on him but the bride is the opposite of this she has the blood of him on her that's what I will I don't want my blood on him because if my blood's on him it means he's mad at me and he's out to get me let his harass thought on me now I believe it happened to me years ago when the wrath of God fell on my nature oh Hallelujah when the wrath of God fell on my nature and God was angry was who I was he was angry was what I was and the fire of God broke loose on my nation their God slayed my first husband and set me free from that Old Union Hallelujah praise the Lord [Applause] oh he said notice this in my Fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and I will stain all my raiment for the day of vengeance is in my heart and the year of my redeemed praise the Lord so here he's fighting mad at somebody and in love with somebody else he's come talking about judgment and wrath and blood but he says oh yeah let me not get all caught up in this but let me tell you what this is all about this is the year of the redeemed notice in verse 6 that I will tread down the people I wish friends you could get people to see it it's just so sad and make them drunk in my Fury and I will bring down their strengths to the Earth my goodness Jeremiah 10 10. but the Lord is the true God I love this the Lord is the true God he is the Living God and an everlasting King at his wrath the Earth shall tremble and the nation shall not be able to abide his indignation this is one of the compound names of Jehovah Adonai Jehovah yah and it is Elohim he met e-m-e-t and it means god the god of Truth now you see it's one thing to have the truth of God I don't just want the truth of God I want the god of Truth amen because all kinds of people have had the truth and turned it away and walked away from it that's right but if you've got the god of the truth you'll have the love of the truth with you that's right you have Jehovah Elohim he met and he is resident in your soul that's why you can sit here and you're a sermon like this tonight and you say well praise God I hate it it's really a bad deal I'll feel sorry for those that's going to be here but he ain't talking about me tonight because I don't plan on being here I'm going to be coming back with the Lord Jesus on a white horses and we're representing a power because I have already met him in Wrath and my own nature is dead the old man has died years ago and I buried him in the form of baptism and I raised from the dead to a new life and I'm waiting for my body to be changed hallelujah amen my blood ain't going to be on him because his is on me praise God if his blood's on me I'm safe I'm secure oh notice Joel 1. verse 15. alas for the day for the day of the Lord is at hand can you imagine thousands of years ago they said this the day of the Lord is at hand well in God's time it's only been a couple days yeah so it isn't it notice the fervency and the urgency of the Prophet no doubt when the people heard this Vindicated Prophet they saw they don't even plant no taters they don't even planting on Mayors it's coming I mean it's right upon us they urgency must have so gripped the hearts and for some of them it was right upon them because someone probably didn't live to see the next day notice the day of the Lord is at hand as a destruction from the almighty shall it come chapter 2 verse 1. below ye the trumpet in Zion and sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let all of the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is not at hand a day of Darkness and of gloominess wow how many has ever heard the coming of the Lord preached like this before we're not afraid of truths are we a day of darkness and of cluminess a day of clouds and a thick Darkness as the mourning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong that there has not been ever the like neither shall there be any more after it even to years of many generations what a parallel so you got a bad Gloom in time and then you got a bunch of people on the Earth that there ain't never been none like them and never will be again Joel chapter 2 verse 11 and the Lord shall utter his voice listen children the Lord shall utter his voice before his army for his camp yes very great Glory for he is strong that executes his word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it well Joel asked that question a long time ago let me give you the answer the elect of God will you will abide the day of the Lord the wrath of God the Vengeance of God Obadiah chapter 1 verse 15 for the day of the Lord is near upon all the Heathen well praise God that leaves me out I used to be a trinitarian heathen but I ain't one no more as thou Hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon thine own head for as she have drunk upon my Holy Mountain so shall all the Heathen drink continually yay they shall drink and they shall swallow down and they shall be as though they had not been but upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance and there shall be Holiness and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions the great day of the Lord is near it is near and hastes greatly notice what a time is coming the wrath of God the Judgment of God well how come y'all ain't howling why aren't y'all terrified well some of you ought to be if you ain't living right but the majority of you are sitting here tonight and look at them and say what in the world's matter brother Donnie and he eats something bad and hurt his belly ain't nothing wrong with my belly I'm telling you the truth this is what's fixing to come on this Earth that we love this is what's fixing to happen to your family this is what's fixing to happen to your friends your employees your employer if they do not hear the word of God and will they all hear it they won't but thank God you have ears to hear and not only that but a heart to obey what you have heard don't be a forgetful hearer James said and listen and hear what you were and walk out and forget it but all my other really elect of God they're not forgiven for hearers they are obeyers to the word thank you Lord Jesus notice this in Zechariah 1 14 the great day of the Lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even The Voice of the day of the Lord The Voice of the day of the Lord the mighty man shall cry their ability there is a day is a day of rest a day of trouble and distress my God a day of wastedness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness in an amazing these prophets probably never even knew each other never even read one another's writings but they prophesied the same words second Peter 3 10 and we'll close but the day of the Lord will come now for those of you who think this is only the Old Testament the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt now remember this is pre-nuclear Bomb this is before they ever understood anything about the dividing of an atom but listen the way Peter describes this and it's a nuclear explosion the heavens shall pass away now we talk about nuclear bombs and they're often they're terrible but do you understand the Cobalt bomb the Cobalt bomb is so much more dangerous than the nuclear bomb they've got things that absolutely probably scare most Mortals to death are they talking they rattle their swords and rattle their swords but remember one day it'll be more than talk this scripture will be fulfilled and when it does the heavens themself not the heaven but the heavens will shake the elements the stars the constellations oh Lord God the heavens shall pass away with a great noise so the Fallout will go up so high the cloud and it will start igniting the heavens what is it filled with these gases and the heavens the gases and the heavens will pass away and catch on fire hmm and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up so in reality when that day comes what will we have left as the people of God much of the things that we have sought for and labored for and struggle for it won't even matter people have stolen lied and connived and cheated and done this and that and the other and when this day rolls around it will be as if though they were like the beggar on the street the person in the streets of Mumbai which I've been there used to be called Bombay and you see tens of thousands of people on the streets there the main streets the very main streets and they got cardboard boxes they got pieces of tarpaulin they got pieces of metal roofing which is a high-class place to live and if you've got a piece of metal roofing and there's thousands and thousands and thousands of people that line those streets and there's so many of them they cannot get rid of them they're homeless they have no place to live but when this day rolls around there won't be one bit of difference between them and somebody that lives in a penthouse on Fifth Avenue it will all be the same can you imagine their eyeballs will melt and fall out of their skull their skin will fall off what a terrible day is coming you're going to face the wraths of God then or you face it now at the altar I'm glad I took mine at the altar Hallelujah don't you love him let's stand thank you Lord thank you Lord notice this in Revelation 19 14 in the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the Nations as I begin to look at this and study I found it was so amazing the parallel of how the believer meets him and when the believer meets him versus when the world meets him so somebody's going to meet him he's going to have blood on him or they're going to have blood on them here out of his mouth goes a sharp sword and it will slay the Enemy by the thousands he won't let nuclear explosions take care of all of it out of his mouth the word will go forth and thousands times thousands will die he's providing the supper for the birds not me not you but one day that word went out of his mouth cut me to my it's so red my life and got me and when that old nature that old husband began to agree with God's word what did he do he slayed him on the altar the sword out of his mouth killed my nature [Music] and I'll come off of that altar a new person so you'll be killed here or killed here I choose mine here out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness of the rest of almighty God he tries now notice again twofold here he's treading it but who is it he's liking the wine press now to the wicked or before he was treading your sins here is the Lamb of God coming to the world he said I tread The Wine Press of the wrath of God Alone myself so there he was with all your lying all that your adultery all of your sins and he was right there in the middle of it I kill that adultery I kill that Obsession of pornography I killed that devil oh my God it all over me come out and say I've conquered it for you Donnie I've conquered him for you young ladies I've got the blood of your grapes all over me now you are free [Applause] but you see now it's fixing to introduce the millennium so he's going to tread on sinners tread on governments tread on society tread on everything they've done and he will fill the Beast and the false prophet and the fire which burns with brimstone Brimstone was used as a form of incense to purge the unclean you see those who have died for millennia they don't go to a burning Lake of Fire remember the parable Jesus gave it was just a parable the prophet said God never sends a man to a burning fire without first judging him well what's amazing is they go to Hades she old of the Old Testament Hades a prison house but the Beast and the false prophet go straight to the Lake of Fire apparently they've done been judged and they go into fire and brimstone oh my what is it incense coming up on the Earth coming with the nuclear fallout glory to God and all of a sudden there will be an earth that will merge and when she merges out of all of that you imagine now the prophet they asked him what would the bride be when this takes place he said he'll carry away somewhere he didn't know exactly where it was but lift the bride off the Earth while all these explosions are going on all this Atomic stuff and the Earth have begin to belch out like she did in the beginning no my unlike Lowe's in Home Depot we got to go build a house and this and that and we go over and buy this and buy that but God allowed the building materials to churn out of the bosom of the Earth in the beginning as she began to bolts the volcanic ash out of her all glory to God and whenever it comes on the Millennium and we will step out on the ashes of the wicked and the Earth will be back to her Eden condition again praise God praise God oh I wish it could happen today but mother Donnie we're so close to being in our new church forget our new church the coming of the Lord my goodness I ain't got one plan and I hope you don't don't take press and know everything in life the coming of the Lord supersedes everything praise be to God it'd be fine with me if we work like dogs and get that thing ready and we have to start the first service and Jesus said come on home youngins come on home come on up to my house that's fine with me any tune praise God that's about it it's Lord God how many of you tonight but no one looking around you want to be remembered he said Lord I I don't want to be here in this terrible time that we've heard talked about tonight I don't want to be here Lord oh God I raised both of my hands we don't want to be here Lord oh Hallelujah we want your blood to be on our garments not ours on yours Hallelujah let's arouse of God fall on us in this life help us Lord May the wraths of God meet us at the altar somewhere speak judgment upon that worldly nature praise God and right there that nature dies nor do we don't want to just shake hands with a preacher pick up a book and accept this Doctrine and that Doctrine I believe God sent a prophet all that's important that's part of it but we know we must be born again Hallelujah Lord we don't want to get people to shout we don't want to get them to emotional things we're speaking in tongues we want to get them to a new birth then let them shout then let them speak in tongues if the Holy Ghost gives it to them we don't want to accept no substitute whatsoever where it's intellectual of the mind or emotion of the spirit we want to make sure that old man is dead oh Lord if there's one here tonight or many if there's one or many under the sound of my voice it's streaming this at her archiving father in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God meet them at the altar let that brother that sister in the office that one driving a car maybe they're going down through Africa wherever they are Lord God oh heavenly father in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God deal with your children draw us Lord the hour is coming a dreadful Time Lord there's no way we can talk about it and make it real enough to describe what's coming oh but Jesus hide us hide us father to the death angel passes through Lord God let it let our Our Lives be covered in your blood let our sins be annihilated father in the blood of the Lamb of God there's one here tonight Lord that's not ready to meet you father May the spirit of God deal with them Lord maybe they've got cold and different May the Holy Spirit I pray touch them right here tonight Lord God you tread the wine press alone you got our filth our unrighteousness all over you you have to become a man you couldn't die as God you couldn't Dodge the eternal but you had to die in the form of sonship a man so in the form of sonship you tread all over our sins you tread all over our habits and you got them all over you and this is why Spirit God had to turn his back as it were on you and you had to die alone on the cross Eli Eli lemon my God my God why is Thou forsaken me because you had tread The Wine Press of God and God's judgment was on you God's Wrath was on you and God had to send you to hell O Lord Jesus thank you you were the creature of love the creature of Mercy the creature the creation of God's compassion but the prophet tells us that you forsook your sonship you let go of all you were to take our sin upon you Hallelujah you become us that we might become you you become a sinner that we might become children of God and when you look down and saw the Wrath of the grapes the dispensation of judgment that was on you you knew there was only one place Heaven could not receive you you had the blood of grapes on you you could not go straight to heaven you had to go straight to hell oh Jesus oh Jesus thank you thank you Lord God so you died out of the presence of God and became a curse and I hear the prophet say demonology part two paragraph 199 when I think of how Jesus when he died with our sins on him he died the death of a sinner and God because of his sins sent him to hell but you went to hell so we don't have to you tread The Wine Press of the wrath of God so we don't have to all we got to do is just meet you at that altar let the wrath of God fall on that nature and there it does and a little spot about the size of a button comes inside of our soul as it were and we start making these new steps toward our theophany praise the Lord we worship you tonight Lord God don't you love him children I hope he makes it more real to you tonight than it's ever been before that he died for you he took your place took your sin become your sins that you can stand here tonight and say I'm free I am no longer a sinner I'm no longer bound by Satan but I am free I'm washed I'm clean praise be to God oh we worship you Lord God lead us Lord Jesus then lead us through the word what is the little reproach that we bear in this life for you to even be worthy to be compared for the reproach of our sins and guilt that you bore for us you died a curse in the eyes of almighty God the Angels couldn't even stand to look at you because you were so sinful not because of what you've done but because of what you become for he who knew no sin became our sin oh Lord God that we might become the very righteousness of God in him oh Jesus we worship you tonight father no wonder that one day when the redeem starts singing those songs that the angels will back out of that presence and they'll circle the Earth and bow their heads as we go to singing about the Redemption power of God but Lord we don't want to wait to that hour we want to sing about it right here tonight we want to tell you we love you forgive me for complaining Lord forgive me for complaining about my cross and how heavy it gets sometimes what's what have I been through compared to what you suffered for me oh Jesus we love you tonight father I bless your name Lord I worship you don't you love him children can we just worship him just a bit before we go we got we got a while yet before we have to be out of here let's just love him just a little bit oh how he deserves Our Praise can you just imagine him in your mind now just look at him as he's there and in the wine press of the wrath of God in goes your sadness in goes you're smoking in goes your drink and in goes your lying in goes all of your sins Jesus is right in the middle of it treading it down his feet Hit The Grapes of your ungodliness his feet hit your cousin his feet hit all of that and the grape burst open and the blood of the grapes splattered all over him your impurities your unrighteousness all of your wrongdoing he must transport your sin down to Hell Hallelujah he must meet Satan glory to God Hallelujah to God why so you can meet him as a righteous son and daughter of God think of it we'll go out of this hell hole and in a moment we'll be changed in the twinkling of an eye and go straight into the presence of God can you imagine one day you wake up here you are in the middle of all this rotten nonsense and in a few seconds you'll be changed and you'll be moving
