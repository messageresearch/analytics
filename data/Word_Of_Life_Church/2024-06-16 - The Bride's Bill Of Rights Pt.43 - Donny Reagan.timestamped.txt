[24:34] it was really impressive if you got to
[24:35] see it but one thing I noticed this year
[24:37] that was very it was wonderful was to
[24:39] see a lot of the young people and a lot
[24:41] of people in general pouring in and it
[24:44] was it was like the body ministering
[24:46] unto itself like to into the younger
[24:48] children and they were the games were
[24:50] taken care of by the upper roomies and
[24:51] the and thank God for that and it was
[24:53] just fun it wasn't worked by one person
[24:56] it was worked by many people no one

[46:12] Happy Father's
[46:14] Day I'm sure most of your fathers feel
[46:16] the way that I do and um many fathers
[46:20] that I've spoken to through the years
[46:22] they feel like I've made a lot of
[46:24] mistakes along the way wish they could
[46:27] redo some things undo some things change
[46:31] some things but yet aren't you glad the
[46:34] Lord doesn't toss us when we mess
[46:37] up he gives us a chance to try over and
[46:41] over again we're so grateful for that um

[47:12] undertaking with just one person of
[47:14] course trying to do it so always so many
[47:17] people behind the scenes that are doing
[47:19] things thank you for that I trust our

[47:32] and his mercy and give you a little bit
[47:34] of time together amen let's uh turn
[47:38] today if you would to the book of Isaiah
[47:39] chapter
[47:41] 54 Isaiah
[47:43] 54 verse
[47:47] one sing O baren thou that did is not
[47:52] bear Break Forth into singing and crying
[47:56] out loud thou that didst not travail
[48:00] with
[48:01] child for more other children of the
[48:06] desolate than the children of the
[48:09] married wife saith the
[48:12] Lord enlarge the place of thy tent and
[48:15] let them stretch forth the curtains of
[48:18] thine
[48:20] habitations spare not
[48:23] lengthen thy cords and strength
[48:27] thy
[48:28] Stakes for Thou shalt Break Forth on the
[48:31] right hand and on the left and thy seed
[48:35] shall inherit the
[48:38] Gentiles and make the desolate cities to
[48:41] be inhabited fear not for Thou shalt not
[48:45] be ashamed neither shalt thou be
[48:48] confounded for Thou shalt not be put to
[48:51] shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of
[48:55] thy use and shall sh not remember the
[48:59] reproach of thy
[49:01] widowhood anymore the reproach of thy
[49:06] widowhood for thy
[49:10] maker read it with me is
[49:15] thine
[49:16] oh wow for thy maker is thine
[49:22] husband so there must be going to be a
[49:25] way made by which people can marry
[49:30] God praise the Lord amen for thy maker
[49:34] is thine husband the Lord of hosts is
[49:38] his
[49:39] name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
[49:44] Israel the god of the whole Earth shall
[49:49] he be called for the Lord has called
[49:54] thee as a woman woman
[49:58] forsaken notice now as a woman Forsaken
[50:03] and grieved in spirit and a wife of
[50:08] Youth when thou was
[50:12] refused saith thy
[50:15] God what a wonderful thing how many
[50:19] ought you been remembered today as we
[50:21] pray I want to also thank you for
[50:23] praying for Carol during her surgery
[50:25] she's doing doing better still not
[50:27] feeling great but the doctor told her
[50:29] probably take her a couple weeks maybe
[50:31] to get over to pretty extensive dental
[50:34] surgery and we certainly thank you for
[50:35] praying for her ask you to continue to
[50:38] do so so let's just uh go before the
[50:41] Lord and ask him to bless the word and
[50:43] all the needs and requests father as
[50:45] we've gathered here today in this place
[50:48] Lord Jesus we count it such an
[50:50] honor Lord we're asking you that you'd
[50:53] help us our needs are so many Lord Lord
[50:56] and we're here to be able to sing and
[50:59] worship and pray and praise and hear the
[51:03] word and respond back to the word father
[51:07] we just want to see you move among us
[51:09] our needs are so many and so great Lord
[51:13] there may be some here today that don't
[51:15] know you as father maybe there's some
[51:18] that's been saved but they've not receed
[51:20] the Holy Ghost others that need healing
[51:23] others that need Deliverance whatever
[51:26] the needs are we believe that you're
[51:28] mindful of every one of us then father
[51:31] for those that are streaming today that
[51:33] are sick and Afflicted and whatever
[51:35] their not needs might be we bring them
[51:37] before you as well help us all Lord
[51:41] Jesus as I stand before this people
[51:43] today no doubt the most needy person in
[51:46] here to try to say something that would
[51:49] help a mortal how can I do such Lord God
[51:52] I need you I pray that you'd help me to
[51:55] shut my mouth to anything that would
[51:58] displease you father would you just come
[52:01] and take charge of the service help us
[52:04] Lord each one that we can be able to put
[52:06] forth our very best to make this service
[52:09] everything you want it to be in the name
[52:12] of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the
[52:16] Saints said amen amen God bless you you
[52:19] may be
[52:24] seated for
[52:27] thy
[52:28] maker is thine
[52:31] husband thy maker is thine husband well
[52:36] we can all say we didn't start out that
[52:38] way for our maker certainly was not our
[52:41] husband when we were
[52:43] born born
[52:45] lost born without seemingly a hope until
[52:50] God and His Mercy reached out to
[52:52] us and then after we become saved
[52:56] and then we start moving and growing and
[52:59] moving toward what we believe God has
[53:02] for our lives then we start hearing that
[53:05] there's more to this than just
[53:08] salvation that a person can start laying
[53:12] aside things being cleansed of certain
[53:15] things
[53:16] Sanctified then we learn there's this
[53:19] indwelling of the spirit where you move
[53:23] Beyond justification and sanctification
[53:25] and God
[53:27] actually gives you a portion of himself
[53:30] and his Spirit starts living in you and
[53:34] then you move into a state to where that
[53:37] you're hearing that there's a message in
[53:39] the land and that God has done a great
[53:44] work in that he's bringing a people to
[53:47] be his wife or his
[53:50] bride and hearing that there's different
[53:53] degrees of people in the economy of God
[53:58] as there were in the Old Testament so
[54:00] are there in the new and then you go to
[54:03] wondering and you're puzzled about it
[54:05] you're trying to figure it out okay so
[54:07] everybody everybody comes to Salvation
[54:10] in the same sense and then some never
[54:13] move beyond that they just keep going to
[54:15] church and keep living their same old
[54:18] sinful life basically and they believe
[54:21] that that's pretty much acceptable in
[54:23] the eyes of God and then others seem to
[54:26] grab a hold to something that makes them
[54:29] different and they're able to overcome
[54:31] things that you think was totally
[54:33] impossible for them to do and it was
[54:36] because something had to help them of a
[54:39] greater power than what they had to do
[54:41] it and then you see others and it seemed
[54:43] like they move into a little deeper
[54:45] place even than that with God and they
[54:48] have such a love for him and it seems as
[54:51] if though he is their very life and they
[54:55] can't live live without him they can't
[54:58] be really motivated without him and then
[55:01] others they still go to church they love
[55:03] God they don't want to be lost they
[55:05] don't want to go to hell but they just
[55:07] don't seem to love Jesus in the same
[55:10] degree and then we hear it of course
[55:12] preach that everybody's going to heaven
[55:14] at the same time uh those that live good
[55:17] those that don't live so good you just
[55:19] try to do the best you can and God will
[55:21] help you you know and then we understand
[55:24] that those types do not answer back from
[55:27] the Shadows that we see in the Old
[55:30] Testament so we see people like Abraham
[55:33] that walked with God in such a sphere
[55:36] that God became his friend so not just
[55:41] an acquaintance not just his judge to be
[55:45] in the future but actually a friend what
[55:49] kind of man would God ever call his
[55:54] friend well he didn't call lought that
[55:57] he didn't call aimc that he never called
[56:01] Pharaoh that there's many great people
[56:04] of the Old Testament that God never
[56:07] called him friend I wonder why he would
[56:09] call this one particular man his friend
[56:14] I'll tell you that's quite awesome isn't
[56:15] it to be called the friend of God if the
[56:20] president of the United States would
[56:21] call you friend or the mayor or the
[56:23] governor or something like that and
[56:25] would say oh M what a great honor and
[56:28] I'm not saying that it wouldn't be but
[56:30] can you imagine that God himself would
[56:33] call you his friend yet others he would
[56:37] call them servants others he would call
[56:41] them his people but never his friend so
[56:45] it shows us that there are categories
[56:48] truly in the kingdom of God I guess the
[56:51] question then would be what makes the
[56:53] difference can we Elevate our our El and
[56:57] get to the different categories the
[56:59] higher category where Abraham was is it
[57:03] something that we actually do ourself is
[57:05] it something that we learn is it
[57:07] something that say the more faithful we
[57:10] are and the more that we do the more we
[57:12] help the poor the more that we reach out
[57:15] to others and we give of our substance
[57:17] is that what does it is it that we pray
[57:20] more we read our Bible more we go to
[57:23] church more often are is it is it those
[57:26] things that makes it different or are we
[57:29] looking at something that is not just
[57:31] what we do but it's actually his choice
[57:36] himself you see I would not wanted any
[57:39] of you to have chosen my wife for me as
[57:44] much as I love my mom and my daddy I
[57:46] would not want them to have chosen my
[57:49] wife for me I don't think any of you
[57:52] brothers that are married today would
[57:54] have wanted me as your pastor or your
[57:56] mother your grandfather some Aunt some
[57:58] uncle that you really love and respect
[58:01] but you would have wanted them to chose
[58:03] your wife for you you felt like you had
[58:06] a right is that true you felt like you
[58:09] had a right and you were the one that
[58:11] was going to live this woman for the
[58:13] rest of your life so you feel like you
[58:16] would have a say and what kind of woman
[58:19] that you would going to live with well I
[58:21] feel the same way today about God myself
[58:24] don't you that I I don't feel like I
[58:26] have a right to say this one's bride
[58:28] this one isn't that one is that one
[58:30] isn't that one is I I believe that God
[58:34] has the right himself to choose who he's
[58:37] going to be married to through
[58:40] eternity then if God does have that
[58:43] right then truly he will give those
[58:46] people whom he has chosen to be that a
[58:50] particular something that will respond
[58:53] to him and as we looked at it there's
[58:56] been last Sunday there's been special
[58:58] occasions when the Lord would manifest
[59:02] himself in a way that's quite unusual it
[59:06] wouldn't be uh something that everybody
[59:09] would even know it wouldn't be something
[59:12] that he would do just every week or even
[59:15] every year it would be something that he
[59:18] would do only on special occasions and
[59:22] special times times when it was needed
[59:25] because say the darkness was so severe
[59:29] it would take a special presence in
[59:32] order for the elect to even break
[59:35] through it and we believe that we are
[59:37] living in such a special time but we
[59:41] know we're not the only ones because
[59:43] he's done it before now the times have
[59:46] been scarce and they've been few really
[59:49] in comparison to Angelic visitations
[59:53] alone but this one that we like to look
[59:56] at today is the visitation of the son of
[1:00:00] man through the administration of the
[1:00:04] son of man the bridegroom call will come
[1:00:08] through that visit now it's different
[1:00:11] than just an angel of the Lord coming
[1:00:13] down and visiting manoah an angel of the
[1:00:16] Lord coming down and visiting different
[1:00:20] people this would be not an angel of the
[1:00:24] Lord but the angel
[1:00:26] of the Lord so it will be a theophonic
[1:00:30] appearance of God himself in a visible
[1:00:34] form he will come in such a way and
[1:00:38] release a power that will help the
[1:00:41] people of the Day become what they need
[1:00:44] to be let me read to you again the quote
[1:00:46] that we read last Sunday improving his
[1:00:48] word Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:00:51] Sodom now watch close so will it be at
[1:00:54] the coming of the son of man when the
[1:00:56] son of man is being revealed not no more
[1:01:00] as a church not no more as a church but
[1:01:04] the bride is called in that day the son
[1:01:07] of man will be revealed what to join the
[1:01:12] church to the Head unite the marriage of
[1:01:17] the Lamb the bridegroom call will come
[1:01:22] right through this now remember the
[1:01:24] bridegroom call will come through this
[1:01:29] manifestation of the son of man now
[1:01:31] notice it's not going to be called Son
[1:01:34] of God what was Son of God the spirit
[1:01:39] had a son and it was called Son of God
[1:01:44] that would that would last for many many
[1:01:49] hundreds of years 2,000 years actually
[1:01:54] that would be a great time for the
[1:01:57] church ages but it will not be able to
[1:02:01] consummate the end time for the
[1:02:03] finishing up of the bride and a
[1:02:07] resurrection so it must be something
[1:02:11] that will go beyond what Luther had what
[1:02:14] Wesley had what Pentecost had a
[1:02:19] restoration of gifts was wonderful but
[1:02:22] it never produced a Rapture from ausa
[1:02:25] Street on it certainly W produce one
[1:02:28] today and the church said so under the
[1:02:32] church ages the anointing that was being
[1:02:35] released was not son of man but Son of
[1:02:41] God now the Lord Jesus referred to
[1:02:44] himself through the gospels over and
[1:02:46] over and over again as son of man this
[1:02:49] is one reason the Pharisees and the Jews
[1:02:53] got so angry at him because he referred
[1:02:56] to himself as son of man now they knew
[1:02:59] that was a title that God gave to
[1:03:02] Ezekiel they knew that was a title that
[1:03:06] God gave to Daniel and then here the
[1:03:09] Lord Jesus is referring to himself as
[1:03:13] son of man so they got all bent out of
[1:03:17] shape well let me just tell you in
[1:03:19] advance people still do today so when a
[1:03:22] preacher really preaches about the manif
[1:03:25] estation of what the son of man has been
[1:03:28] in our day they still get all bent out
[1:03:31] of shape again first of all they don't
[1:03:34] understand it and they if they do try to
[1:03:36] look at it they St it through tradition
[1:03:39] but watch now he says the bridegroom
[1:03:41] call will come right through this one
[1:03:43] the son of man will come down and come
[1:03:47] in human flesh and unite the two
[1:03:50] together the church has to be the word
[1:03:54] he is the word and the two unites
[1:03:57] together and to do that it'll take the
[1:04:01] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:04:04] son of man so pastors is not enough
[1:04:09] preachers is not enough going to church
[1:04:13] is not enough praise the Lord somebody
[1:04:16] reading your Bible is not enough but it
[1:04:19] would take something beyond all of that
[1:04:23] so it will be the revealing of of the
[1:04:26] son of man not a clergyman he says now
[1:04:28] do you see what I mean it's the son of
[1:04:31] man now notice who the son of man is
[1:04:34] Jesus Christ will come down in human
[1:04:40] flesh Among Us and will make his word so
[1:04:46] real that it'll unite the church and him
[1:04:50] as one the bride then shall go home to
[1:04:55] the wedding supper amen she's already
[1:05:00] United okay so now if we're going to
[1:05:03] take this order or this sequence of
[1:05:06] events the son of man will come down in
[1:05:10] human flesh and make his word so real it
[1:05:13] will unite him and the church together
[1:05:17] and he says it think of it she's already
[1:05:20] United so apparently something had
[1:05:24] already happened when he says this
[1:05:27] improving his word you following me so
[1:05:31] far now I want you to notice when this
[1:05:34] is preached August the 16th
[1:05:38] 1964 so something has happened she's
[1:05:41] already united we go to the wedding
[1:05:44] supper not the marriage fill your flesh
[1:05:48] as you quot in Revelation 13 of the
[1:05:51] Flesh of Mighty Men cause the marriage
[1:05:53] of the Lamb has come but the rapture is
[1:05:56] going to the wedding supper now this
[1:05:59] breaks all tradition of theology this
[1:06:04] breaks all the teaching of the majority
[1:06:08] of the catechisms of the church who
[1:06:11] believe in the Rapture because they
[1:06:14] preach that the Rapture is going to the
[1:06:18] wedding not
[1:06:20] so the Rapture is going to the marriage
[1:06:25] supper
[1:06:26] cuz the bride is already
[1:06:29] United now how could that be but brother
[1:06:33] Donnie how can the bride be United to
[1:06:37] the groom and him not
[1:06:39] here H oh but you
[1:06:43] see he
[1:06:47] is but you see people are looking for
[1:06:51] the corporal uniting
[1:06:55] they're waiting for the
[1:06:57] coming in the
[1:07:01] clouds but this coming was not a coming
[1:07:05] in the
[1:07:06] clouds but a
[1:07:08] coming in the
[1:07:13] cloud you see Jesus himself identifying
[1:07:16] his
[1:07:17] coming and he talks about it in two
[1:07:21] ways that he will be coming in clouds
[1:07:26] then he says he will be
[1:07:27] coming in a
[1:07:30] cloud surely he knows the difference
[1:07:32] between
[1:07:34] clouds and
[1:07:36] Cloud unless of course he's talking
[1:07:39] about two
[1:07:40] advents when the word here unites with a
[1:07:44] person and they two become one then what
[1:07:47] does it do it manifests the son of man
[1:07:50] again oh my not the church theologians
[1:07:53] the son of man the word in the church
[1:07:55] become one whatever the son of man done
[1:07:58] he was the word and the church does the
[1:08:01] same thing now turn with if you would to
[1:08:03] Genesis 18 verse1 and let's look at one
[1:08:07] of these Earthly manifestations of the
[1:08:11] son of man on the earth and the Lord
[1:08:14] appeared unto him in the Plaines of
[1:08:18] mamory now I want you to notice the way
[1:08:19] the Lord is spelled capital L capital O
[1:08:22] capital r capital D and the Lord
[1:08:25] appeared unto him in the plains of
[1:08:28] memory and he sat in the tent Door In
[1:08:32] the Heat of the day so now Abraham has
[1:08:35] been accustomed now for many years to
[1:08:39] the divine
[1:08:41] presence and quickly he
[1:08:44] recognizes the divine presence and from
[1:08:48] his initial
[1:08:50] reaction he's sharing the same behavior
[1:08:54] that he's done done in Prior events when
[1:08:58] the divine presence has come down so he
[1:09:02] recognized him now I find it amazing
[1:09:04] that no matter what form the Lord comes
[1:09:07] in the elect will always know him now
[1:09:12] it's sad to say about the carnal people
[1:09:14] because they've got this certain mindset
[1:09:17] and they can only recognize the Lord
[1:09:20] Jesus when he appears according to their
[1:09:23] traditional concept I hope we ain't that
[1:09:26] way today here in church some people
[1:09:28] only recognize the Lord whenever he's
[1:09:31] moving in the form of shouting and
[1:09:33] running and jumping and screaming and
[1:09:35] hollering and he might move in a way of
[1:09:38] a still Small Voice and they sit right
[1:09:40] there and said well I'll tell you one
[1:09:42] thing I didn't get nothing out of church
[1:09:44] today maybe it's because you had your
[1:09:46] traditional idea in mind of the way you
[1:09:49] thought he ought to move I want to
[1:09:51] recognize him no matter how he chooses
[1:09:53] to move today anybody else here I
[1:09:56] believe in the running I believe in the
[1:09:58] jumping and the shouting absolutely I
[1:09:59] love all of that but I want to recognize
[1:10:03] him no matter what form that he appears
[1:10:06] in or what form he chooses to reveal
[1:10:09] himself in now notice in verse two so he
[1:10:14] lift up his eyes and he looked and lo
[1:10:18] three
[1:10:20] men three men stood by
[1:10:26] him so the Lord visited him in the
[1:10:29] plains of
[1:10:31] mamory and then he lifted up his eyes
[1:10:35] and whenever he does it's just like they
[1:10:38] appeared he lift up his eyes and he
[1:10:41] looked and lo three men notice how Moses
[1:10:44] writes this now three men so it's God
[1:10:50] and two angels and they look like men
[1:10:54] they talk like like men maybe sweating
[1:10:57] dust on their feet and they look like
[1:11:00] ordinary men but Abraham has this
[1:11:04] special way of knowing
[1:11:07] god that others would see a
[1:11:11] man but he saw
[1:11:13] God I guess the question is what do you
[1:11:16] see when you look three men stood by him
[1:11:20] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:11:24] from the tent
[1:11:26] and bowed himself toward the ground now
[1:11:30] the Son of God this is the the pre-
[1:11:34] incarnated form of him as he's going to
[1:11:37] be in the Virgin form of course of the
[1:11:39] Virgin born body this is the
[1:11:54] pre-incarnate word in the beginning was
[1:11:56] the word so God gave birth to the word
[1:11:59] which was the son of God so he's the
[1:12:01] central figure of what we want to look
[1:12:04] at and there's always something special
[1:12:07] about this attribute of God because the
[1:12:10] Son of God wanted to wanted to live
[1:12:15] among humans there's always been
[1:12:17] something about him that he wanted to
[1:12:20] come into humans
[1:12:23] homes and be around them
[1:12:25] that's that's mindblowing right he he
[1:12:27] wanted to come down and live among human
[1:12:32] beings this is why even had them to make
[1:12:34] the Tabernacle in the wilderness God
[1:12:36] wanted to hear him talk about farming
[1:12:39] and raising goats and raising cows you
[1:12:42] imagine God want to come down and live
[1:12:45] among these people and hear them talk
[1:12:48] about the hardships and the battles and
[1:12:50] things that they went through so he he
[1:12:52] did not go to a synagogue somewhere or
[1:12:55] some Temple but he comes in the plains
[1:12:58] of mamory and he comes right up to
[1:13:01] Abraham's tent door so it shows us a
[1:13:04] tray you know what this tells me friends
[1:13:07] the Lord Jesus wants to come to your
[1:13:10] house he wants to come to my do we have
[1:13:15] the type of homes that the Lord Jesus
[1:13:18] not only comes to but feels comfortable
[1:13:21] in
[1:13:22] staying now what so his desire then is
[1:13:26] to visit the homes and the hearts of
[1:13:29] those who love him so Abraham's
[1:13:33] communion with Christ now remember
[1:13:35] Christ was the pre-existing form of him
[1:13:40] before he was later called Jesus Christ
[1:13:43] the anointed one so Abraham's communion
[1:13:47] with Christ so these verses give us an
[1:13:52] Insight that Abraham and memory mamory
[1:13:56] means fatness so it's the largess of God
[1:14:01] so he's enjoying the fullness of God's
[1:14:04] blessing now notice where he's
[1:14:07] fellowshipping with Christ he's
[1:14:09] fellowshipping with Christ in fatness in
[1:14:13] the blessings of God in great things
[1:14:16] that God gives him where is he at he's
[1:14:19] in a tent which signifies he is a
[1:14:23] pilgrim so he's not living in a house
[1:14:26] with a foundation notice his journey now
[1:14:29] typified by the symbols and the types
[1:14:31] where he is so he lives in a tent there
[1:14:36] the presence of God meets him and when
[1:14:39] do these visitors come the Bible tells
[1:14:42] us They Come In the Heat of the day so
[1:14:45] they don't come at midnight or in the we
[1:14:47] hours of the morning when it still dust
[1:14:50] they don't come then but they come in
[1:14:52] the heat of the day when the Sun or the
[1:14:56] light is in its brightest Eminence as
[1:14:59] it's coming forth again in his walk with
[1:15:02] God it's showing that Abraham is walking
[1:15:06] in the fullness of the light of the day
[1:15:09] now others are totally oblivious to this
[1:15:12] they don't have a clue what's even going
[1:15:14] on notice again what he does his
[1:15:17] response to them is his haste Abraham's
[1:15:22] haste so it proves that he has this
[1:15:25] loving desire to be able to reach out to
[1:15:28] God now no doubt he had never seen him
[1:15:31] quite this way before remember whenever
[1:15:33] he had saw God in different forms but he
[1:15:36] had never seen him quite like this so he
[1:15:39] he spares nothing from the presence of
[1:15:42] the Lord he wants the Lord to feel
[1:15:45] totally at home you know Paul tells us
[1:15:47] in the book of Ephesians chapter 3 verse
[1:15:49] 17 that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[1:15:54] I love those words cuz it literally
[1:15:56] means this that Christ May settle down
[1:15:59] and feel at home in our hearts that
[1:16:03] Christ May settle down oh my and feel at
[1:16:07] home in our hearts so how important is
[1:16:10] it that you and I make our home and our
[1:16:12] heart such an important place for the
[1:16:15] Lord Jesus to feel comfortable because
[1:16:18] he yearns to have communion or
[1:16:20] fellowship with us now notice verse
[1:16:22] three and he said my my
[1:16:25] Lord my
[1:16:28] Lord now there's three that walk up but
[1:16:32] he only addresses one of them and he
[1:16:35] said my Lord if now I have found favor
[1:16:38] in thy sight pass not away I pray thee
[1:16:41] from thy servant now notice what he has
[1:16:44] the ability to
[1:16:46] perceive it's his Divine
[1:16:49] friend he's not sure why he's gone on a
[1:16:53] different costume
[1:16:56] he's not sure why he's looking different
[1:16:59] this time but he knows him that's right
[1:17:02] brother Joel he knows him and he
[1:17:04] addresses him as my Lord not the Lord
[1:17:10] but my
[1:17:12] Lord my Lord look in verse four let a
[1:17:16] little
[1:17:18] water now wait a minute we're talking
[1:17:21] about God are we not Elohim
[1:17:25] let a little water I pray you be fetched
[1:17:30] and wash your feet watch how that he
[1:17:35] changes with the time and he talks the
[1:17:40] talk that matches the
[1:17:43] manifestation so he's not asking for the
[1:17:46] Adoration of angels he's not asking for
[1:17:49] a throne he's not asking for you know
[1:17:53] some great heaven
[1:17:55] something but he's talking to God in the
[1:17:59] way Hallelujah that manifests the form
[1:18:03] that God's in I hope we can be as
[1:18:07] spiritual in the hour that we're living
[1:18:09] in a lot of people can praise that God
[1:18:13] that's millions of miles away they can
[1:18:15] adore that invisible being that's so far
[1:18:18] away and he can be right in their very
[1:18:21] midst and they don't even recognize and
[1:18:24] honor him for being there I hope you
[1:18:26] understand today that almighty God is
[1:18:29] right here in this church this morning
[1:18:31] it's good to be able to acknowledge that
[1:18:33] great Throne of God I don't know about
[1:18:35] you I've got needs here today I need a
[1:18:38] Healer I need a Deliverance I need one
[1:18:40] that'll encourage me anybody else so I
[1:18:43] want to be able to dress him in the way
[1:18:47] that is suited for this occasion this
[1:18:50] morning when I get to heaven I'll talk
[1:18:53] to him in heavenly language but like you
[1:18:56] I'm not in heaven yet so what am I going
[1:18:59] to talk about water feet food trees why
[1:19:05] cuz that's where he is I want to talk to
[1:19:07] him about my everyday life I wish
[1:19:10] somebody would hear me this morning I
[1:19:12] want to talk to him about your needs and
[1:19:14] those of you that are sick and those of
[1:19:16] you that are weary I don't want to be so
[1:19:18] Heavenly minded and got my head stuck in
[1:19:21] the clouds that I look beyond your needs
[1:19:24] and the things that are pressing you
[1:19:26] this very day that you have need of in
[1:19:29] your life with
[1:19:31] God oh my let a little water I pray you
[1:19:36] be fetched and wash your feet and
[1:19:41] rest yourselves under the tree water
[1:19:46] feet rest tree all natural things why is
[1:19:52] he talking such because God had
[1:19:54] manifested himself in a natural form and
[1:19:59] he has no problem you see he's not
[1:20:01] looking at this as not being spiritual
[1:20:03] we try so hard sometimes to be so
[1:20:06] spiritual and we look right over the top
[1:20:09] of the very things that God wants us to
[1:20:11] recognize can you imagine a man talking
[1:20:14] to God about feet water rest and
[1:20:19] trees that's a man that knew the hour he
[1:20:21] was living
[1:20:23] in let a little water I pray you be
[1:20:26] fetched and wash your feet and rest
[1:20:29] yourselves under the tree and I will
[1:20:33] fetch a morsel
[1:20:37] of you're talking to
[1:20:40] God and you are going to offer God a ve
[1:20:48] sandwich and a glass of
[1:20:53] milk you see how this category of people
[1:20:56] are so
[1:20:57] strange they are so weird because they
[1:21:01] are allowed by God to break into that
[1:21:03] realm to see where he is and they can
[1:21:07] talk to him where he is and it makes him
[1:21:10] so happy that they
[1:21:12] can I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[1:21:16] comfort ye your heart so water feet rest
[1:21:22] trees bread and comfort that sounds like
[1:21:26] a total human language to
[1:21:31] me why cuz God had become a
[1:21:37] man and we don't know how long it lasted
[1:21:40] maybe a few
[1:21:42] hours I'm not sure that you understand
[1:21:44] it yet but I'll go ahead and tell you
[1:21:45] this is a manifestation of the son of
[1:21:49] man it was for only a few
[1:21:52] moments and after that you shall pass on
[1:21:55] for therefore are you come to your
[1:21:58] servant I know why you're here Lord
[1:22:01] you're here for me to do this for you oh
[1:22:04] my would it be awesome if every one of
[1:22:06] us here today could have that attitude
[1:22:08] God I know why you're here you're not
[1:22:09] just here for brother Donnie you're not
[1:22:11] just here for brother bent you're not
[1:22:13] just here for Brother Scott you come by
[1:22:15] today for me you come by not only for me
[1:22:18] to get something for you but this is
[1:22:21] something I can do back for you notice
[1:22:23] Abraham was not asking God for anything
[1:22:27] it's what he can do for God oh children
[1:22:31] we come to church over and over and over
[1:22:33] again if we're not careful it's all
[1:22:35] about us it's all about well I need this
[1:22:38] I want that I need this I want and we
[1:22:40] bring our big old long list to God I'll
[1:22:42] tell you sometimes I think we need to
[1:22:44] leave that list at the house and come
[1:22:46] and say Lord I left my list at home but
[1:22:49] I've come to worship you I've come to
[1:22:51] praise you I've come to see what can I I
[1:22:54] give you what can I do for you on this

[1:23:07] servant and they
[1:23:10] said so

[1:23:18] unto Sarah and said make ready quickly
[1:23:22] three measures of find meal again

[1:24:33] sidetracked and went over there and
[1:24:34] whatever three hours later he come back
[1:24:37] but Abraham took off running he said man

[1:24:41] find I I'll give God this one
[1:24:44] this one here's got a spot on it it

[1:28:05] this or that or the other and you bring
[1:28:06] it to him you don't know him very well
[1:28:08] you imagine whenever God didn't have to
[1:28:10] send down his menu this is what I want
[1:28:13] he said he God you reckon we need to
[1:28:15] send it down he said men Abraham have
[1:28:17] Fellowship he knows what I like he knows
[1:28:21] oh I hope we do I hope I our father
[1:28:24] knows that we understand he loves praise
[1:28:28] he loves adoration he loves for his
[1:28:31] people to do what they do in haste give
[1:28:34] him their all give him
[1:28:38] [Applause]
[1:28:44] everything so he took
[1:28:47] butter and
[1:28:49] milk and the
[1:28:51] calf which he had dressed
[1:28:54] want you notice every one of these
[1:28:56] things that he's given to God signifies
[1:28:59] work
[1:29:01] preparation he didn't throw the milk at
[1:29:04] God and said God turn your own butter
[1:29:06] here God here's the calf kill it
[1:29:08] yourself cut it to way you want do
[1:29:09] whatever you want to do with it God but
[1:29:11] everything he gave signified his work
[1:29:15] his effort for what purpose to make God
[1:29:20] feel comfortable in his
[1:29:22] tent now you see it was In the Heat of
[1:29:24] the day that these Mediterranean people
[1:29:27] would sit in their tents the temperature
[1:29:31] sore very few trees
[1:29:34] there so they would set in the tent door
[1:29:37] because when the temperature would start
[1:29:39] Rising God in his Mercy would start
[1:29:42] allowing a little bit of a breeze to
[1:29:44] sweep across the desert SE so they would
[1:29:47] set in the door and the breeze coming
[1:29:50] off the desert sand and the door was the

[1:30:07] brightest In the Heat of the Day In the
[1:30:10] Heat of the battle we can find
[1:30:12] fellowship if we know where to
[1:30:15] look and he took butter and milk and the
[1:30:18] C which he had dressed and set it before
[1:30:21] them and stood by them under
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:26] tree and they did eat now you imagine

[1:31:02] meal that was so wonderful you all
[1:31:05] praised me you prayed and and you
[1:31:07] believed you didn't just pray but you
[1:31:09] believed when you prayed and you put
[1:31:11] forth an effort in the ministry studied

[1:31:15] the service you worshiped and you adored
[1:31:17] me thank you all for that fine meal it
[1:31:20] was truly Fit For A King
[1:31:25] Hallelujah so here it's all gathered
[1:31:27] around him and set right before him
[1:31:30] Abraham with a fly
[1:31:32] bush so he's standing
[1:31:34] there waving the
[1:31:37] Flies off of
[1:31:40] God I don't imagine God likes flies any
[1:31:42] better than we do I don't understand why
[1:31:44] he ever made them things in the first
[1:31:49] place and they said unto
[1:31:52] him where is Sarah
[1:31:55] thy
[1:31:56] wife and he said
[1:31:59] behold in the
[1:32:01] tent this is the kind of tent meeting
[1:32:04] I'm looking
[1:32:06] for and he
[1:32:10] said notice they all three asked the
[1:32:15] question where is Sarah thy wife they
[1:32:20] said and he said
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:26] I notice they didn't say it but he said
[1:32:30] it I will certainly return unto thee
[1:32:35] according to the time of life and lo
[1:32:38] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:32:41] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:32:44] was behind
[1:32:48] him so Sarah sitting in the congregation
[1:32:52] I I mean in the tent door behind
[1:32:55] him where he said now Abraham and Sarah
[1:32:57] were old and well stricken in age and it
[1:33:00] ceased to be with Sarah I to the man or
[1:33:02] women therefore Sarah lighted within
[1:33:04] herself saying am I wax old and shall I
[1:33:08] have pleasure my Lord being also old
[1:33:11] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:33:15] wherefore did Sarah
[1:33:19] laugh saying shall I have assur to bear
[1:33:22] a child which I'm old
[1:33:25] oh my goodness I want you to keep the
[1:33:29] timeline in mind Isaac the
[1:33:31] interpretation of his name is
[1:33:36] laughter Sarah actually
[1:33:42] conceives during the same time frame
[1:33:46] that Sodom and
[1:33:47] Gomorrah is
[1:33:51] destroyed now watch The Blessing of the
[1:33:54] elect and the cursed of the
[1:33:57] Damned how they run side by
[1:34:02] side so Sarah
[1:34:05] conceives after this visitation was
[1:34:11] God hallelujah
[1:34:14] hallelujah it will come to pass I will
[1:34:16] visit you he said and the baby will be
[1:34:20] born now God's not saying I'm going to
[1:34:21] visit you and you're going to conceive
[1:34:23] she's fix to conceive after this
[1:34:27] revelation of the son of
[1:34:29] man his presence brought a supernatural
[1:34:33] strength and power that Sarah had not
[1:34:37] yet been able to attain
[1:34:39] to until he revealed himself as son of
[1:34:45] man verse 14 is there anything too hard
[1:34:48] for the
[1:34:49] Lord at the time appointed I not we
[1:34:54] I will return unto thee according to the
[1:34:57] time of life and Sarah shall have a son
[1:35:01] then Sarah
[1:35:03] denied saying I life not now you're
[1:35:07] going to call God a liar to his
[1:35:12] face you're going to tell God he's a
[1:35:15] liar thank God for Grace children that's
[1:35:17] all I can say come on don't sit down and
[1:35:19] look at me like you know what I'm
[1:35:20] talking about there probably ain't one
[1:35:22] of us sitting here today that ain't
[1:35:23] question the Lord and doubted the Lord
[1:35:25] Lord how come this and why that come on
[1:35:27] anybody brave enough to say Amen but you
[1:35:29] know what God done God said Sarah
[1:35:32] because you're a part of Abraham I
[1:35:34] cannot destroy you I cannot touch you
[1:35:36] without touching Abraham that's the
[1:35:39] reason we're sitting here today saved by
[1:35:41] the grace of God why God didn't already
[1:35:43] wipe us out because of our unbelief
[1:35:46] because our husband the Lord Jesus has a
[1:35:49] covenant an Everlasting Covenant
[1:35:56] then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for
[1:35:58] she was afraid and he said
[1:36:01] nay but thou dest
[1:36:08] live listen this if God be with us in
[1:36:11] 1961 Gideon certainly had it was a
[1:36:13] scriptural man when the angel of the
[1:36:15] Lord said unto him if you notice it
[1:36:17] wasn't the angel of the Lord here it
[1:36:21] said the Lord kep capital L O R D it was
[1:36:26] not an angel it was
[1:36:29] God it was a
[1:36:32] theophany in a
[1:36:36] man in the form of God like appeared to
[1:36:41] Abraham back in the
[1:36:43] wilderness and look like a
[1:36:47] man so you mean a
[1:36:50] theophany could come into a man and use
[1:36:54] a man's
[1:36:56] body praise the
[1:37:00] Lord what's the last sign to the Seed of
[1:37:04] Abraham God coming down Discerning the
[1:37:08] secret of the
[1:37:10] heart not a dozen
[1:37:13] men
[1:37:16] one I'm not talking about one of the
[1:37:18] nine gifts of the Spirit I'm talking
[1:37:21] about the revealing of the son of
[1:37:25] man I realize this ain't for everybody I
[1:37:28] realize this ain't for everybody that
[1:37:30] claims they believe the message some of
[1:37:32] them will never go any farther than God
[1:37:33] sent a prophet and they'll go around and
[1:37:35] around and around and around this
[1:37:36] mountain and the bride will be gone and
[1:37:38] they'll still be going around and around
[1:37:39] and around this mountain but to the seat
[1:37:41] of Abraham God is
[1:37:44] calling watch this Christ you his own
[1:37:47] word now let us take St Luke 17:30 and
[1:37:49] watch what Jesus prophesied there saying
[1:37:51] as it was in the days of Sodom it'll be
[1:37:53] the same remember notice at this time
[1:37:56] the son of man would be revealed the
[1:37:58] revealing of the son of man now the son
[1:38:00] of man was actually revealed
[1:38:04] potentially for a few moments there just
[1:38:07] before Sodom was burned now that man was
[1:38:10] Elohim that was God and Jesus Is God and
[1:38:12] God was revealed potentially right there
[1:38:14] for a few
[1:38:16] moments and talked to Abraham in the
[1:38:20] investigation judgment just for a little
[1:38:23] bit the son of man was revealed the son
[1:38:27] of man Elohim do you see it church
[1:38:31] congregation
[1:38:33] says the son of man Elohim was revealed
[1:38:37] just for a few
[1:38:40] minutes if you believe God could reveal
[1:38:44] himself in human dust that he spoke into
[1:38:47] existence why would it be hard for you
[1:38:49] to believe that he could reveal himself
[1:38:52] in a prophet's body that has been washed
[1:38:54] claimed Sanctified by the blood of the
[1:38:57] Lord Jesus
[1:39:00] Christ watch's this again in Abraham's
[1:39:02] Covenant show me one thing more that
[1:39:04] Abraham did show me one more sign he
[1:39:07] gave him than that sign there that was
[1:39:09] the last sign all knows that's the Bible
[1:39:13] readers amen the last sign was given
[1:39:15] this is the last sign Church Hear Me In
[1:39:19] The Name Of The Lord amen look friend
[1:39:23] and I believe God is moving among his
[1:39:25] people saving sanctifying filling with
[1:39:28] the Holy Ghost healing doing wonderful
[1:39:30] things but as one Bible believer and one
[1:39:33] message believer I am not looking for no
[1:39:36] world shaking Revival to where some
[1:39:39] mighty preacher is going to raise up and
[1:39:41] everybody in the message is going to
[1:39:42] follow him that is a lie there is no
[1:39:46] promise in the Bible there is no promise
[1:39:48] in the message of the hour according to
[1:39:51] what God's Vindicated Prophet said we
[1:39:53] have already received our last
[1:39:57] sign last
[1:40:00] sign remember thus saith the holy spirit
[1:40:04] this is your last sign write it in your
[1:40:07] Bible if something Rises beside this and
[1:40:10] greater than this call me a false
[1:40:12] prophet that's quite a statement I watch
[1:40:14] what I say I'm in contact with better
[1:40:16] than 10 million people around the world
[1:40:18] see so I have to say that and I know I
[1:40:20] didn't say that myself
[1:40:24] again Jesus Christ is saying now this
[1:40:26] Messiah was to have a sign and that sign
[1:40:29] was a god
[1:40:32] prophet he was not only a prophet but he
[1:40:34] was a god prophet he was the god of the
[1:40:36] prophets but his Messianic sign was to
[1:40:41] do the sign of a
[1:40:44] prophet now remember the Lord showed
[1:40:47] Peter whenever ananas and Safara had
[1:40:51] sold their place and they kept back a
[1:40:53] part of the property you remember that
[1:40:54] in the book of Acts and the Lord showed
[1:40:57] Peter what they had done and the Lord
[1:41:00] told him about it so he called him out
[1:41:02] and then called his wife out later that
[1:41:04] was not the Messiah son can God show
[1:41:08] people things sh can but the Messiah
[1:41:12] sign is one to a generation amen as I
[1:41:18] said it's not one of the gifts of the
[1:41:20] Spirit watch he has brought through you
[1:41:24] through every one those elements like he
[1:41:26] did Abraham with the confirmation of the
[1:41:27] Covenant give you the Holy Ghost
[1:41:29] speaking in tongues as the spirit gave
[1:41:31] atance and these different things like
[1:41:33] he's promised and now brought you right
[1:41:35] up and send his Spirit among you giving
[1:41:38] you divine
[1:41:41] discernment just before to prepare you
[1:41:44] for the coming son amen it's the last
[1:41:48] sign the church will receive
[1:41:55] can I go on the next thing to the Seed
[1:41:58] of Abraham they're getting their life
[1:42:01] sign of discernment just like it was in
[1:42:04] Jesus day that's the last sign to the
[1:42:07] church again Feast of the trumpets the
[1:42:10] last sign that Abraham ever seen before
[1:42:12] the promised sign came the promised son
[1:42:14] was what God in the form of a human
[1:42:16] being that could discern the thoughts of
[1:42:19] the people one man not a dozen one man
[1:42:24] no matter how many
[1:42:25] impersonations they
[1:42:28] had one and he deser the thoughts that
[1:42:32] was in there the next thing happened
[1:42:34] Abraham and Sarah were turned back to a
[1:42:36] young man and a young woman now notice
[1:42:39] after this revealing of the son of man
[1:42:42] in the plains of memory Abraham and
[1:42:45] Sarah were turned back to a young man
[1:42:47] and a young woman and she
[1:42:50] conceived and brought forth laughter
[1:42:53] praise be to God in Moses time in Exodus
[1:42:59] 3:7 and the Lord said I've surely seen
[1:43:02] the Affliction of my people which are in
[1:43:04] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[1:43:06] of their taskmasters and I know their
[1:43:08] sorrows and I am come down notice again
[1:43:12] now God didn't do this every time the
[1:43:14] people were in a mess only in certain
[1:43:16] occasion so God said I heard it and I am
[1:43:20] come down to deliver them out of the
[1:43:22] hand of of the Egyptians and to bring
[1:43:24] them up out of that to a land good land
[1:43:27] large unto a land flowing with milk and
[1:43:29] honey unto the place of the Canaanites
[1:43:32] and the Hittites and the amorites and
[1:43:34] the perizzites and the hivites and the
[1:43:36] jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry
[1:43:39] the children of Israel is coming unto me
[1:43:41] and I've also seen the oppression
[1:43:43] wherewith the Egyptians press oppressed
[1:43:45] them come now
[1:43:48] therefore and I will send thee
[1:43:53] that's right oh you mean so God come
[1:43:57] down but God did not go in that same
[1:44:01] form before
[1:44:04] Pharaoh how did he go in the form of
[1:44:10] Moses W praise the Lord boy y'all ain't
[1:44:15] had many amens this morning no they're
[1:44:16] fixing to get scarcer than the H teeth
[1:44:18] ain't they do we believe our Bible or
[1:44:21] not do we believe the message to the
[1:44:23] hour so God came down but he did not go
[1:44:28] visibly to where the people but oh I
[1:44:31] know that's God I know that's God but he
[1:44:33] anointed a prophet in his
[1:44:36] stead I'm going to go ahead and choke
[1:44:38] you God told Moses you will be a God to
[1:44:43] pharaoh and Aaron will be your Prophet
[1:44:46] oh I know that scares people to death
[1:44:48] look at your spelling of the word little
[1:44:50] small letter g o d little small letter g
[1:44:54] o d Look up the word this afternoon when
[1:44:56] you get time look at the word Elohim
[1:45:00] Elohim is plurality of God it shows that
[1:45:05] there's not three Gods but God has many
[1:45:08] attributes in his being some are
[1:45:11] revealed with lesser Glory some are
[1:45:14] revealed with lesser dignity and honor
[1:45:17] but it still comes from Elohim I'm going
[1:45:19] to go ahead and say it you was part of
[1:45:21] Elohim from the beginning
[1:45:23] or you'll never be part of that bride
[1:45:25] that's something inside of you is not
[1:45:28] something that you done it is part of
[1:45:31] Elohim it's not L you it's not L me it's
[1:45:36] loh him and if we are his elected we are
[1:45:41] part of
[1:45:43] Elohim
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:50] Hallelujah and I will send thee
[1:45:53] Hallelujah unto Pharaoh that
[1:45:57] thou mightest bring forth my people
[1:46:01] Exodus
[1:46:03] 23:20 behold I send an
[1:46:07] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:46:11] way to bring thee into the place which I
[1:46:14] have
[1:46:15] prepared now remember this is not a
[1:46:18] created angel some
[1:46:20] angels had a beginning
[1:46:23] remember Paul talking about the elect
[1:46:26] Angels there son that's not
[1:46:29] elect there's some that had a day they
[1:46:33] began that's the ones the devil has
[1:46:36] access
[1:46:37] to you see actually your identity
[1:46:40] according to what the prophet taught us
[1:46:42] you was a part of them angels that
[1:46:43] didn't fall before the foundation of the
[1:46:46] world those angels which could fall had
[1:46:49] a day that they begin oh I like to
[1:46:51] remind the devil now and then and if you
[1:46:53] don't you should you need to wish him a
[1:46:56] happy birthday every now and then just
[1:46:58] to let him know you know he had a
[1:47:00] beginning and he will have an End Amen
[1:47:05] somebody say amen he had a day he
[1:47:07] started thou was created perfect until
[1:47:10] iniquity was found in thee he had a day
[1:47:13] he started he'll have a day he'll end
[1:47:16] he'll be the liest one no doubt in that
[1:47:19] Lake which burns with fire and brimstone
[1:47:22] all the rest of will die maybe some of
[1:47:24] them after 10,000 years some after a
[1:47:26] million years but no doubt he will be
[1:47:29] the very last one that will be
[1:47:32] annihilated I said annihilated for he
[1:47:36] will be no
[1:47:39] more praise be to God hallelujah but
[1:47:44] listen friend if you are part of Jesus
[1:47:46] Christ you never had a day you started
[1:47:49] and you don't have a day that you will
[1:47:52] end you are part of
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:59] God now watch this uncreated
[1:48:03] Angel it's the angel of God's
[1:48:07] presence watch an exodus 23:21 beware of
[1:48:12] him listen what God says I'm going to
[1:48:14] send an angel before you beware of
[1:48:17] him and obey his voice provoke him not
[1:48:20] for he will not pardon your
[1:48:22] transgression
[1:48:24] for my
[1:48:26] name is in
[1:48:29] him the angel sent by God is an
[1:48:33] extension of
[1:48:36] himself the angel of his
[1:48:40] presence you see to them names had much
[1:48:43] more of a significance than it does to
[1:48:45] us so if this angel had his name Yahweh
[1:48:49] had invested his name in this Angel then
[1:48:52] it's the same is God he's to be honored
[1:48:55] like God revered like God cuz it is God
[1:49:01] in a condescended form he's to be
[1:49:03] trusted obeyed and listened to it's not
[1:49:06] a creation Now something that spine off
[1:49:09] of God the angel is Jehovah
[1:49:12] himself in a temporary descent in a
[1:49:17] visible
[1:49:20] form God himself and a temporary
[1:49:25] descent
[1:49:27] invisibility in the sphere of
[1:49:31] visibility notice but if Thou shalt
[1:49:33] indeed obey his voice and do all that I
[1:49:35] speak then I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:49:38] enemies and an adversary to thine
[1:49:40] adversaries for mine Angel mine
[1:49:45] Angel what is this God's theophany
[1:49:54] Lord
[1:49:58] God my angel shall go before thee and
[1:50:01] bring thee into the amorites and the
[1:50:03] Hittites and the perizzites and the
[1:50:05] perizzites and the Canaanites and the
[1:50:07] hivites and the jebusites and I will cut
[1:50:10] them off Isaiah 63:9 and all their
[1:50:13] Affliction he was afflicted and the
[1:50:16] angel of his
[1:50:21] presence look at this Hebrew
[1:50:24] word
[1:50:26] paum the angel of his
[1:50:30] face
[1:50:32] person
[1:50:34] presence this is the exact same Hebrew
[1:50:38] word that God told Moses make you a
[1:50:42] table and make some
[1:50:44] bread and put on there call it the table
[1:50:48] of shoe
[1:50:49] bread the word shoe bread comes from
[1:50:52] this same Hebrew word the bread of his
[1:50:58] face the
[1:51:00] bread of his face upon them no wonder
[1:51:05] Jesus said I am that bread which came
[1:51:09] down from heaven that if a man eat of me
[1:51:15] he will
[1:51:16] never
[1:51:18] die don't you understand them 12 loaves
[1:51:21] placed upon the table all o represented
[1:51:23] the 12 tribes of the children of Israel
[1:51:26] so as the priest by representation ate
[1:51:28] the bread it was as of though the Jews
[1:51:31] themselves were eating the bread every
[1:51:33] age God has had a loaf of bread in every
[1:51:36] Church age what was it the message of
[1:51:39] the hour that came from God and the
[1:51:41] people of the age got a hold to the
[1:51:43] bread of the hour don't you understand
[1:51:45] why we live eating on the message of the
[1:51:47] hour it is the bread of his face and as
[1:51:51] we eat we are partaking of communion
[1:51:54] we're not feeding on the failing words
[1:51:56] of a man we're not feeding on the words
[1:51:59] of a Kian we are feeding on the
[1:52:01] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:52:05] our message friends is the bread of this
[1:52:08] hour the bread of his
[1:52:13] face and if you eat it it changes
[1:52:18] you so what will the Rapture and the
[1:52:21] resurrection be Gathering all the
[1:52:25] loaves Gathering all the loaves to bring
[1:52:29] them up before his
[1:52:35] face Lord
[1:52:37] God act 7:37 this is that Moses which
[1:52:40] said unto the children of Israel Prophet
[1:52:42] shall the Lord your God raise up unto
[1:52:44] you from your brethren liken unto me him
[1:52:46] shall you hear this is he that was in
[1:52:50] the church in the wilderness with the
[1:52:54] angel which spake unto him in the Mount
[1:52:56] Si with our fathers who received the
[1:52:58] Lively oracles to give unto us who was
[1:53:02] it pre-incarnate Christ 1 Corinthians
[1:53:05] 10:9 neither let us tempt
[1:53:08] Christ as some of them also tempted and
[1:53:13] were destroyed of serpents you mean
[1:53:15] Christ was in the
[1:53:17] wilderness Christ was actually back
[1:53:20] there they tempted Christ
[1:53:23] and they were bitten by serpents people
[1:53:25] that refuse the anointed Christ of this
[1:53:27] day still get by
[1:53:32] serpents Matthew
[1:53:34] 16:28 verily I say unto you there be
[1:53:37] some standing here which shall not taste
[1:53:40] deaths till they see the son of
[1:53:44] man coming in his
[1:53:49] kingdom oh wow
[1:53:54] so there be some of you standing here
[1:53:56] that will not die until you see the son
[1:53:59] of man coming in his
[1:54:02] Kingdom
[1:54:03] ah the son of
[1:54:06] man and of course there
[1:54:09] was
[1:54:11] John let me close with this Luke 17:28
[1:54:14] last likewise also as it was in the days
[1:54:17] of lot they did eat they drank they
[1:54:18] bought they sold they planted they build
[1:54:20] it but the same day that lot one out of
[1:54:23] Sodom it rain fire and brimstone from
[1:54:26] heaven and destroyed them all even
[1:54:28] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[1:54:33] of
[1:54:34] man is
[1:54:37] revealed
[1:54:39] revealed
[1:54:42] Apocalypto to
[1:54:44] uncover lay open what has been
[1:54:48] veiled or covered up
[1:54:53] ah disclose make bear disclose what was
[1:54:58] before
[1:55:00] unknown so it's not a parusia which is
[1:55:04] another Greek word used for comes come
[1:55:06] and
[1:55:07] coming so it's not a visible return it's
[1:55:11] simply taking the cover off of
[1:55:14] something that's been there so the
[1:55:17] people can be able to look at it
[1:55:24] don't you see why it's so dangerous when
[1:55:26] people walk away from this message and
[1:55:28] call this message false prophecy and
[1:55:30] call this Prophet a false prophet don't
[1:55:33] you understand how dangerous it
[1:55:36] is now remember these are the words of
[1:55:39] Jesus Luke
[1:55:41] 17:32
[1:55:42] remember Lot's
[1:55:47] wife Luke
[1:55:51] 2127 then shall they
[1:55:53] see the son of
[1:55:56] man
[1:56:00] coming in a
[1:56:05] cloud
[1:56:09] coming to come from one place to another
[1:56:13] metaphorically to come into being arise
[1:56:17] come
[1:56:18] forth find place or influence
[1:56:23] so there's going to be some people
[1:56:25] that's going to see the son of man not
[1:56:27] come in clouds as he said in Matthew
[1:56:31] 24 but will come in a
[1:56:36] cloud praise the Lord wonder what that
[1:56:40] cloud will look like head of a man no
[1:56:44] doubt the wigged one how blessed you
[1:56:50] are how blessed you are don't you
[1:56:54] understand friend this is not a bunch of
[1:56:55] preachers that got together this is not
[1:56:57] some man from down the hills of Kentucky
[1:56:59] got together and decided I'm going to be
[1:57:00] a prophet I want to I want to I want to
[1:57:02] make up a message and I I'm going to
[1:57:03] make people believe I'm this great
[1:57:05] person I'm that's not the type of man he
[1:57:06] was it was not him that called himself
[1:57:09] it was not him that imagined the angel
[1:57:11] walking in the floor at Green Mill it
[1:57:13] was not him that Vindicated himself an
[1:57:15] Ohio River it was not him that did all
[1:57:18] of these signs wonders and miracles TL
[1:57:20] osbor TL osbor daughter Sid Ross on and
[1:57:24] on and on and on of these Pentecostal
[1:57:26] people that are still
[1:57:28] making videos and programs and talking
[1:57:32] about the miraculous the supernatural I
[1:57:34] just saw one this week of TL Osborne's
[1:57:37] daughter and she was talking about the
[1:57:39] things that she saw as a young girl
[1:57:42] going there of her mother and father
[1:57:44] under the ministry of brother brand and
[1:57:46] the things that they told her that they
[1:57:48] saw they steal and she said he was the
[1:57:50] most anointed man
[1:57:52] that ever lived on the earth next to
[1:57:54] Jesus Christ I thought my goodness I she
[1:57:57] said with bobbed hair lipstick on and
[1:57:59] earrings and she can say it and get by
[1:58:01] with it if I say it they say I'm in a c
[1:58:05] but I say it with the understanding it
[1:58:07] wasn't just anointed to pray for the
[1:58:09] sick but God sent him with a message to
[1:58:13] call the bride out to what to call her
[1:58:16] to Jesus Christ that we could be United
[1:58:20] together not only to quote the this
[1:58:22] message but to live
[1:58:25] [Applause]
[1:58:28] it hallelujah hallelujah word
[1:58:33] [Applause]
[1:58:42] hallelujah St John
[1:58:44] 12:34 the people answered him we have
[1:58:46] heard out of the law that Christ abideth
[1:58:48] forever how sayest thou the son of man
[1:58:51] must be lifted
[1:58:53] up who is this son of
[1:58:57] man then Jesus said unto
[1:59:00] them yet a little
[1:59:03] while is the light with
[1:59:07] you walk while you have the
[1:59:11] light ah so you're asking who someone
[1:59:15] is and that someone you're asking is the
[1:59:18] someone you're asking
[1:59:19] about and this is the answer that that
[1:59:22] someone gives back walk in the light yes
[1:59:26] sir while you have light lest the
[1:59:29] darkness come upon you for he that
[1:59:32] walketh in the darkness knoweth not
[1:59:36] whether he
[1:59:37] goeth so he won't know if he's a woman
[1:59:40] or a
[1:59:41] man he won't know if he's a Baptist or a
[1:59:44] Methodist but I hope there's some people
[1:59:46] here today that know who you are Sons
[1:59:49] and Daughters of Goden and you know
[1:59:52] where you're going when Jesus comes
[1:59:55] you're going with him why we've been
[1:59:58] married to Christ don't you understand
[1:59:59] friend
[2:00:00] it well I'm going to jump over here
[2:00:03] Brothers Let's jump
[2:00:04] over to the very last quote that you
[2:00:08] have now we've had Elijah's and Elijah's
[2:00:11] coats and Elijah's manels and Elijah's
[2:00:15] everything but the Elijah of this
[2:00:20] day sir is the Lord Jesus
[2:00:28] Christ so you see that Elijah is not
[2:00:31] brother
[2:00:31] brandham it's the anointing of the son
[2:00:34] of man what is it he tells us in 1965
[2:00:37] you know the anointing was in time it
[2:00:39] seems to be so hard for you to get it
[2:00:41] separated now he said the seventh angel
[2:00:45] is not the son of man but he's revealing
[2:00:48] to the
[2:00:49] public the son of man
[2:00:52] the son of
[2:00:53] man is
[2:00:57] Christ but have we recognized
[2:01:02] him I wonder when we hear these things
[2:01:06] do we recognize it was the Lord
[2:01:08] Jesus using his prophet's human
[2:01:12] instrumentality I don't think some of
[2:01:14] the preachers would do with the message
[2:01:16] what they do if they believe this today
[2:01:19] well I don't like that I don't believe
[2:01:21] this I don't like that I don't want that
[2:01:22] I don't take that I don't take that this
[2:01:24] is not a
[2:01:26] cafeteria okay this is not where you
[2:01:28] walk through and you get your plate God
[2:01:30] dished it out to you so he didn't do
[2:01:32] without amen this is not a cafeteria I
[2:01:35] don't like that I don't like this I
[2:01:36] don't like that I don't like this is not
[2:01:37] a
[2:01:41] cafeteria the Elijah of this day is the
[2:01:44] Lord Jesus Christ he's to come according
[2:01:47] to Luke
[2:01:49] 17:30 says the son of man is to reveal
[2:01:52] himself among his people not a man God
[2:01:58] but it will come
[2:02:00] through it will come through
[2:02:03] notice God is not the
[2:02:06] prophet but it will come through you
[2:02:09] understand friend that ought to be so
[2:02:12] simple it will come through so how in
[2:02:16] the work could he tell those people your
[2:02:18] name is Mary you live on 22nd 32nd
[2:02:21] Street so and so I see you walking up
[2:02:23] three steps to your house you went to a
[2:02:25] doctor portly s heavy set man got
[2:02:28] glasses on he told you this that and
[2:02:29] other is that the truth is that the
[2:02:31] truth I don't know I don't know what I
[2:02:32] even said is that right is that right
[2:02:34] what was it it was the Lord Jesus
[2:02:37] revealing
[2:02:39] himself oh they love the signs I love
[2:02:41] the Wonders and then they say well it
[2:02:43] got off at the
[2:02:45] end where they say he got off is where
[2:02:48] we actually got
[2:02:49] on Amen they love the signs and the
[2:02:53] Wonders and the
[2:02:54] Miracles but we love the
[2:02:56] message I said we love the
[2:03:05] message he goes to North Carolina you
[2:03:08] find interstates named after Billy
[2:03:11] Graham you go through different states
[2:03:13] here and this bridge is named after this
[2:03:15] state trooper and this Road's named
[2:03:17] after this man and that man and that man
[2:03:20] and we have no Bridge is named after him
[2:03:22] we have no roads named after
[2:03:25] him because he didn't come to leave a
[2:03:27] legacy of prophet
[2:03:30] worship but he said his desire was to be
[2:03:33] able to lead people that they could have
[2:03:35] a relationship with Jesus
[2:03:38] Christ look friends as message people if
[2:03:41] we do not have that we have not took
[2:03:43] what he
[2:03:44] said he don't want to be a bunch of
[2:03:46] prophet worshippers or Pastor
[2:03:48] worshippers he wants us to worship God
[2:03:52] amen have we
[2:03:56] recognized the son of
[2:03:58] man has come Among
[2:04:01] Us the Lord
[2:04:04] Jesus the Lord Jesus himself I hear him
[2:04:08] say what was it
[2:04:10] Topeka 1964 June now the time has
[2:04:16] come that we must
[2:04:19] recognize who's in our SE city
[2:04:23] today the Lord
[2:04:25] Jesus
[2:04:31] himself
[2:04:33] Hallelujah if you can separate the two
[2:04:37] you're so
[2:04:39] blessed if you can hear the voice coming
[2:04:42] through the human instrumentality not
[2:04:44] idolize the human instrumentality but
[2:04:47] you're the bridegroom's call you're so
[2:04:50] blessed
[2:04:51] don't idolize your pastor no evangelist
[2:04:54] no other great man I just read it this
[2:04:56] week God's Prophet said when you go to
[2:04:58] lifting a man higher than you're
[2:05:01] supposed to God will allow that man to
[2:05:04] fall in front of
[2:05:07] you so you will get your eyes off of him
[2:05:10] don't do preachers that
[2:05:12] way there's one we should worship amen
[2:05:15] that's the Lord Jesus thank God for
[2:05:17] every man of God pray for him we love
[2:05:18] him we honor him but don't make Idols
[2:05:21] out of kn men friends you do yourself
[2:05:24] and them a great
[2:05:26] dishonor oh

[2:05:39] there some of those meetings got married
[2:05:41] and went to the service that night then
[2:05:43] you'all brother
[2:05:45] Harvey no doubt they could share some
[2:05:48] real stories with us of what they saw
[2:05:50] and what they heard and must have just
[2:05:52] been overwhelming but I guarantee you
[2:05:55] he'd be the first one to say he sees
[2:05:57] more now about the message and what it
[2:06:00] was than he did actually sitting there
[2:06:02] under the man himself right sister Judy
[2:06:05] why it's the time we're sitting in the
[2:06:09] tent

[2:06:53] I don't know that I'll ever forget as
[2:06:55] long as I'm in my right
[2:06:57] mind when I stood there on March the
[2:07:00] 27th of
[2:07:01] 1983 that little church in
[2:07:05] Kentucky and I preached that you had
[2:07:07] sent a prophet to the
[2:07:10] Earth the people could tell I was
[2:07:12] leading up to something but they didn't
[2:07:13] know
[2:07:15] what I laid out in the scripture and
[2:07:17] laid out the Old Testament and the new
[2:07:19] and then I brought it right up to
[2:07:23] pointing them to a prophet in this
[2:07:26] day so that was in
[2:07:29] March in
[2:07:31] May I preached about the
[2:07:34] revealing of the son of
[2:07:36] man in May of 83 so here I
