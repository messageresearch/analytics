eyes like the fish pools in heshbon by the gate of Basra beam that noses as the tower of Lebanon which look us toward Damascus down head is like Carmel and the hair of an had like purple the King is held in the galleries what a privilege brother warning sister Vicky god bless y'all so good see it tonight he's the Lord a man this just bow our heads together and ask the Lord's blessings on the word father we thank you so much tonight Lord for this wonderful opportunity again to be able to assemble ourselves together this place has been dedicated to be the house of God father we pray that your grace that you administer to us give us those things which we have need of Lord there's many many needs it's among us Lord I'm thinking of different ones that are sick but the bird gravely Lord you see this surgeon that a brother had to have this week and we're asking for your mercy to him others that are sick and afflicted dealing with various things in their lives Lord we know that you're mindful of us would you come by this way to not Lord Jesus whereas bartimaeus was so many many years ago Oh son of David don't pass us by we called upon you not under the name of son of David but under our true dispensation or linked to you and that is our husband our blessed Redeemer with predators speak to us than that father from your word I want to yield myself that you can be able to take this human instrumentality and speak through me to the glory of God in Jesus name and the Saint said God bless you you may be seated her journey is about two thousand years or excuse me two days this has been in the making for a long long time she's been through many dangers toils and snares got delivered of so many habits set free of so many terrible terrible sins he's washed her in his blood rooster from the Adamic nature that she was born with set her free from so many things that she was bound by in sin and yet here she is in this chariot as it's called of cedar the pilasters of silver covered with purple on the top and she's fighting the greatest battle that she's ever felt and that is the battle in her mind she's no longer a southern Galilean girl she's no longer under the control or the dominance of her brothers that can make her go here and go there and do this and that she's free from that she's free from the burning Sun of which she said I am black but comely and the word is in hebrew tanned by the sun which she had many long hours she said I kept my my family she but it did not tend to my own garden because of neglect she's free from that she's no longer subject to these overlords that would try to control her why would she still be fighting battles there she's free from the Lions and the caves that are near the mountain region which she was from near Lebanon she no longer fears the leopards lions and the sayings that was in her home stretch of land where she was from why she still fighting these battles and why does it seem as though these battles in one way are more difficult than even getting saved it makes no sense it would seem the hold of sin would certainly be the most difficult battle anymore - whatever fight to be loosened from that will truly bring the greatest Liberty that a person would ever known in what other battle could even compare to being loosed from sin but you see my brother Adam preached in 1962 and entitled the message the greatest battle ever fought he never said that being a sinner and being loosed from sin was the greatest battle he never said that being loosed from alcohol or cigarettes or pornography or profanity was the greatest battle ever fault but he brought it down to basically when you listened to that sermon down to the Christians the believers that are fighting the greatest battle ever fought not getting saved after you are saved not coming to God but after you come to God learning how to surrender to God knowing then that the sinner coming to God is certainly not the greatest battle a person that would be bound with such filth and decrepid nice of sin yet that but in itself is not the greatest battle that mortal will ever fight in one sense of the word when they come to Christ in the simplicity of believing he is the one taking upon himself their battle of darkness and liberating them from sin but after they become set free then they are the ones that enter into very great battle now let me let me go this direction for just a little bit I know a lot of folks don't like it when you go in this direction dealing with brother branham but I've never been one to really kind of cater to people anyway I want to follow the leading to the Lord that's the most important thing other bam tells us in 19 and 60 the biggest enemy that I've got is William Branham can Happy Valley say amen to that he's always in my way now there's a couple of questions now that I want to ask so brother branham's greatest enemy is William Branham William Branham and brother Branham is not the same person just not brother Donnie and Donnie ain't the same person that brother David and David in you and you and you and you you understand now I know message folks go to get all tore all nervous that ain't that complicated just listen that's the biggest enemy that I've got is William Branham not brother William Branham but William Branham notice now how he severs himself from William Branham the greatest enemy ah God well my question is who's I now you can't say that I is William Branham so I must be somebody different than William Branham the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's always in listen out some of the persons way so I and my is on the same side and William branham's on the other side ah am I is on warm side and darkness on the other side and go ahead and say man cuz you're the same way now notice he's always in my way he's always in God's way I will say he's always gets in God's way he's too tired he don't want to do this he don't wanna do that if I can just crucify that guy God can use it so the urea is a william branham that is in god's way and here is a william branham that is in brother branham's way and here is a william branham that brother william branham must crucify in order for God to use him oh praise the Lord I said if I can just crucify that guy God can use it God can use this and God can use this body use this microphone now notice how that he likens and you can search us if you like but he uses these terms very very over and over again repetitively in the message that he was simply like a microphone he says that ministers are like a microphone and the microphone is mute and the microphone does not have the ability to speak its own words and he said that he was like a microphone now the problem is that many folks are making him the microphone God you can't make the microphone God because the microphone is mute would it be done to call this Donny Reagan now Donny Reagan's used it ever since it was bought new as a matter of fact it has my name on the body pad right but the Louie has his name on his the visiting Minister had their own it's called vision Minister others has called the pale each one of them are named this one has my name on it nobody uses it but me it's set for me for the travel for the mid range for the mid treble for the bass exactly in the way that I like it so it's set for my voice but no matter how much my name is on the pack I'll tell what you do now next Saturday night when I'm in Switzerland take this microphone and laid upon the pulpit and turn it on and see if it will repeat my words see if it will say what I say tonight praise the Lord it cannot it will not and if it does run that's exactly right now it's the same of any true minister of God so to make brother branham's voice the literal voice of God it's contrary to what he taught my voice no other preachers voice is the literal voice of God there's only been one of those and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ that's right so brother Branham became a microphone now notice this you know I'm looking at this how that he brings us in God can use this body use this microphone it's a mute till I speak in it or somebody else speaks in it but it can't speak itself now what's this battle that we are engaging again it says in perfect change of perfect weakness I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he is the one that gets in God's way he gets lazy praise the Lord I know friends I know this is not popular but I as I said I really don't care it's the truth we need to hear it so that we can learn if we're going to overcome how many of us overcome well there's only one way we can overcome we've gotta know who our enemy is I mean if you think that tree is your enemy you pull the leaves off of it and you kick it and turning over and turn it upside down all you're going to do is get hot and sweats going to run down your face and your fragrance is going to be tore all the pieces and when you get down you still got your enemy if you think that Gatorades your enemy when you get done you know what you ain't you ain't done that's it but if you can identify who your enemy is and learn how to fight your enemy it will change your entire world that's right notice he's the one that gets in God's Way he gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes he thinks he can do something about it now notice this William Branham so this William Branham sometimes get to a place that he's lazy there's other times that William Branham would get to a place and he thought he could do something about it now this is you I'm talking about even though you're named a William Branham but this is a very epitome of us all we're never all exactly the same on the same day or in the same aisle really we can change from one thing to another so sometimes we're lazy and then other times we think we've got the answer and other times are not really sure so we just go back and forth and back and forth and that's what gets in God's Way rather Brennaman who said that he was exactly the same way by the RAM got lazy in you Christians ever get lazy brother Ram got lazy then there will be times he said he thinks he can do something about it and what he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that is out of the way then God can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about can happy valley say amen to that God can do it in a way that william branham knows nothing about it that's when God can use you that's what he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot now this is the battle you see when you as a sinner it was not you battling trying to get yourself out of the way you cut him God didn't ask you to get yourself out of the way when you was a sinner he simply asked you to take his atonement for your sin that imply the blood and bring you into the work of reconciliation but now that you're a child of God it is a day to a battle and this is why Paul said that I die daily here talking about the sin nature the sin nature god when he got born again it is the human makeup it is your makeup or your human nature that we deal with every day oh my notice this again he says improving his word 1964 William Branham is the greatest enemy I got now watch again he's separating William Branham from I now wonder how God feels and I wonder how brother Brandon would feel when people make an idol out of brother branham's greatest enemy according to him his greatest enemy was his flesh and yet people idolized brother branham's greatest enemy oh now don't sit don't judge them too bad because most of us did the same thing to ourselves now you see if we really believe that we are our greatest enemy I think we would attack ourselves in a much more aggressive way and we would attack others in a less aggressively because we would know really we are our enemy anyway it's not your husband your wife your pastor the Deacons and so on but it is yourself now we say we believe that and we say Amen to it but by our actions it is evident we do not believe it the way he believed it about himself now he really believed that William Branham was his enemy praise the Lord now if we believe the same thing then will not we take the same mindset toward him not notice he said William Branham is the greatest enemy our God see but when I can get him out of the way then Jesus Christ can use the body so there no doubt if brother branham's greatest enemy was William Branham then our greatest enemy will be us you agree with me so far now once again he says I used to preach over the Baptist Church a little sermon I called it let loose and let God that's I just let loose and that God as always you've got yourself into it there no way don't you love him theological terms there ain't no way you know who the biggest enemy I gots william branham he's always in god's way if I could just get him out of the way then God can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself I'm going to say it again that's your worse enemy it is yourself I'm going to say it again that is your worst enemy it is yourself that's better make it that you are sending me it as yourself just get yourself out of the way then God can go to work now be careful of your associates when you get out there and get among the people this one begin to tell you this and this one back then you get yourself all mixed up and you don't know what you do believe now why is this very important because the type of things we feed on type of preachers we listen to has a great impact upon our stand on the gospel notice again now this is a very peculiar quote you have to really listen to it several times give me give time to the old fashioned heartfelt pouring out of the Lord Jesus Christ until the Holy Ghost pours down upon your soul you'll get besides yourself now listen you'll get massaged yourself maybe you can get with Jesus if you get away from yourself once notice how you can't be with yourself and Jesus you find out you're the biggest enemy you got now listen you can't be with yourself and Jesus so what you want to do is get besides yourself now in the sense I'm not talking about just a static warship and jumping up and down and all that but get besides yourself get yourself where it needs to be not in the control tower of you but beside you so you can get with Jesus now what we're trying to different well all the Christianity in this a is merging you and Jesus and your nature on the same thing just put it all one big bow and let God work it out it'll never work you've got to get yourself out of the way and get you your soul in with Jesus but if you try to take them three and mix it together you're gonna have a mess you try to take your human makeup all your fears your complexes your inferiority and all that together let that dominate you know now Satan will try to convince us that our dearest closest friends is after all who do you talk to more than anybody else who do you trust more than anybody else who do you love more thinking about oh my goodness here we go in reality most of us subconsciously would consider ourselves our closest dearest trustworthy friend oh Jesus help us but there put me to more services and you'll have a break I'll be gone for a while now notice this he says a man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely over God and then he asked the question who himself that's the biggest enemy you got is your self but if you believe yourself is your friend will you try to overcome yourself or will you try to subdue yourself or will you not cater to yourself so if yourself tells you brother Donnie don't like you or the church don't like you or God don't love you what most people will believe who their closest friend so then they set there and they hear me preach or other ministers briefs and they will hear that word through what their closest friends interpretation so when they get a text they read that text through their closest friends interpretation which is complexes and fears and in very Ortiz and Oh Lord the further I go the Quadra y'all will get why because our friend our dearest closest personal friend is the one that we give the most credence to oh thank you Jesus notice instant reproach for the cause of the word brother Mercedes praying father he goes on he says in this prayer it's really touching to hear him say but he said heal the sick afflicted that's among us bind up the brokenhearted Lord we went through so much my heart's got so many scars on it Lord from hard battles I'm a tall veteran help me Lord I need your help help me Lord I need your help now remember we're in the greatest battle that's ever been fought and when you listen to this in 1962 you'll hear brother Branham said the greatest battle that's ever been fought is right in the future fixing to happen when him going on a 62 he said it's fixing to take place and soldiers truly we are in that battle right now now because of all that we are in the natural sense of see taste feel smell hear love imagination conscience memory and all the aspects of the gates of the flesh and the spirit and the main one of course to the sola supreme moral agency then satan has ten gates by which he tries to reach us and that is to the outer realm and then the spirit realm and on the inside is exactly where the seat of life ways but yet satan doesn't even have to have direct access to the soul in order to rob us a peace joy victory and all of that because when we become converted we are a new creation in the same old temple so we are born again added breath of God the seed of God inside of us it's quickened but the human element is still there and Satan can still aggravate is he can make a sick put sickness afflictions and we get in our mind this person no lock us in that one don't like us and God don't care if I ever die you know whatever more that we go through and if that is our closest dearest friend then when we go to talking to our self then if that's who we have the confidence in no matter what anybody else tells us they can come up and say look brother I love you I love you but if your dearest friend tells you they don't love you that's the gospel because that's the one that we paid the most attention to oh mama now why is that though it's because the two outer elements would still remain unconverted and this is the greatest battle that's ever been fought God is calling for every seed of Abraham to separate themselves from ck's fields now here imagination conscious memory reason and affection you imagine God is calling you to separate yourself from yourself this is a lot of friends yes as those it's going to take the rapture and only those what's this in standing in the gap he says I become an old man an old veteran preacher and had a lot of hard battles oh my and maybe I'm scarred all cut out on the inside from fights because my Lord the Lord gave me was not to back to kiss the babies and marry the young and bury the dead but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the battlefront against the wiles of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness inside it were the Word of God till I seen the enemy defeated I've been cut deep many times I remember just because you are a man of Valor because you are a great soldier even a great general as he was does not mean that you will leave the battle without being wounded and many times better animals greatly wounded he was wounded by enemies he was wounded by friends he was wounded no doubt my family and those of us around him as we all have been now every one of us said in here tonight that if you've been a Christian very long no doubt you have been wounded I prayed to God if I've ever wounded you forgive me now if the word has wounded ship I refuse to apologize for that but if I wounded you as a man I beg your forgiveness because you have enough wounds the way it is about me adding more but I figure as long as I'm your pastor I'm going to keep on wounding as far as the word so I'll go ahead and let you know that but whatever we see now that the human being because of the the way that were designed these things certainly can affect us how well your brother branham from his very heart saying that he's wounded am i this reproach for the word 1962 and then about six months or so later he's saying it a little bit more now the scars are coming out so it is the scars from war not because the sin didn't run around with other people's wives trying to steal money or any that sort of thing but it was because of the particular call that God had given him he was not a James as we've been looking on the book of Acts that James are so loved and respected by the Jews and James is not a controversial sort of guy Peter could go and preach among the Jews they didn't hang him up I've get one or two Paul but God has got different men in different positions and it's very tough on men like Paul right brother Branham who have a very difficult role and because of that brother Branham had got wounded many many times he held his scars very well he was able to hide them very very well but yet he come to a spot to where that they begin to leech out of him as it was and begin to affect his heart and his conduct and his behavior toward those that he was sent to personal come on go get quad on me you know this is true he said I'm all scarred and cut up on the inside now he says this is what God called him to be and the last 5-6 Verwoerd's there he says I've been cut deep many times now Satan of course knowing this and he's been dealing with human beings for six thousand years now so as he learns unlike you and I Satan no doubt has as we would say in a sense of perfect recall of remembering all the battles all the weaknesses all the frailties of dealing with human beings so whenever he learn something he can apply that to the next one the next one the next one and when he finds your repetitive pattern he knows exactly what to do against you and I in order to try to defeat us well he'd found that brother branham was quiet all night he was quite a soldier quite a general quite a man al valor but he also found he was silly human me autocad race you are I don't care what prophet pastor singer whatever you are you're still a human being now in this brother enemies reached the place to where that he's fighting this this war that's going on was in himself you remember standing in the gap it's not one probably the lot of message folks deliver player in their church because it displaces humanity a brother branham but I can follow a man like this I can follow a man that admit he was wrong come on I know some of you don't like it because you're going to idolize his flesh huh huh you want to worship William Brown I'll worship in the Lord Jesus I want to identify this man that William Branham said was his enemy because it will help me identify my enemy my enemy is not William Branham it's not Jim Bob it's not David Siler it's Donny Reagan will the true Donny Reagan please stand up now I'm standing you see this guy right here he wants to cook my lady that country shut your mouth get Elaine to real Tommy Reagan what's now standing of the gap paragraph 122 I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to and that's wrong I've built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message everybody okay to this now we're talking about friends Elijah the greatest man as far as ministry next to the Lord Jesus but it was a man with a ministry and as long as the man is there this can happen now for you all your brother doesn't do it may no but run the parallel in your own life what we're fixing to find is a prophet of God that is called to minister to the sick Minister the message of the word they get a loss of feeling for the people another can become so stressed with her children a father can become so stressed with work and with family and with this and that another never enough time never enough money never enough this never enough set and yet he's still in the role of father a mother still in the role of mother a deacon can still be in the role of deacon but yet we lose something in our heart now watch this is the very heart now this man that we see I let the sick way I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and God forbid that I try to compare the life like Moses but that's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him and when he come to deliver them so he just left him alone and went into the wilderness but God turned him around he long forgot the suffering people Moses forgot how in the world could you forget the suffering people because your best friend you see the longer we listen to our best friend the worse we get I hate to tell you all tonight the child's best friend's a two-faced liar ain't nothing but a hypocrite he'll lie to you on Monday he'll lie to you through Sunday he'll lie 24/7 come on I'm talking about your feelings I'm talking about your imagination I'm talking about your memory don't you understand for many of us the person that we have made as our best friend our closest confidant is a liar if I lied to you folks half as much as you lie to yourself you would have tarred and feathered me and yet you will lie to yourself and believe yourself daily yourself or say you ain't saved you don't feel I say you can while I even read the Bible you do get now the Bible you listen to pay for you don't get another wife and go to church you don't get nothing out of shirt he's a liar you do get something if you come at a halfway attitude you able to leave you're not without something out of the service but you're listening to your lying South Omaha he says Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him brother Roy and I remember in this story here in Roy Roberts inhabit a dream about brother randomly seen brother Branham carried up to a certain place and seen brother bedroom changed now brother Raymond's going to relate to this remember brother Roy in your dream and now I cannot go with a ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me whoa okay so God told him to go back I say I can't do it God I'm sorry oh dude chief where the gym is my life insurance paid that Betty I'm not needed after this service notice no matter of God did tell me but that is to change the scene in the dream role robertson saw brother Branham changed what was it his heart his attitude why his best friend been lying to him [Music] the William Branham that his heavens greatest enemy that William branham's got a big mouth oh Jesus he's been lying come on go children don't recollect or by saying I know by steam he was a sinner he needed to be saved like you needed to be saying he had to have the Holy Ghost he had to bring William Branham subject don't idolize that man's flesh you'll make yourself on a dollar to your Brice same the Holy Ghost notice he said something's got to change me because I'm a heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they also heard that message and they also done it I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have as I said I can follow up man like this to me this is a big man it ain't a big man that has his faults and has everything about income on children that's nothing but a coward a lot of preachers want you to think they never go through no battles he's a liar preachers fight hell they get discouraged they get down you get down brother don't I do get down I did weary I think what what's the use even go to church anymore and preach people come and they won't - don't come they don't want to what differences in math I'm gonna preach it in head to do my best for God it's up to you what you do with it oh I've gotta keep driving over the David I'm waiting on you to encourage me I appreciate it when you do but there's times I've got to encourage myself and I've got to say Johnny you're up on the wall and you're doing a good work and you are not coming down and my friend Donny will say I'm tired of this I'm weary of this and the seat of God will say shut your mouth you are not my friend you are a liar get behind me Oh notice he said I don't have the feeling for the people but I should have until I can get that feeling there's no need of me going because I'd be a hypocrite so his brother branham back slid his brother branham lost the Holy Ghost where's the problem lies in the realm of feeling all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite I'd go to I got a feel that that isn't Ricky and Rick Adam and remember the Lord rebuked him for that and it isn't that virtuous god's children that's in bondage and I must go to them until I can feel that way oh gotta be kidding me until I can feel that way oh Jesus there's no need to be gone I'd be ahead today guys go tell us the remedy most you can say while friends a lot of the idol worshipers can't listen to this tape it totally destroys their God image don't destroy my god image because I don't have a God image of other enim I've got a God image of Jesus Christ amen can't you say this is the william branham that was his enemy if you'll see him you'll see yourself if you don't see brother Brennan rot you'll never see yourself right if you don't see me Roddy's your posture you'll never see yourself right if you put me in this holy image old brother Donnie is always so strong he's always so good he'll always be here well ah make no man no man your ultimate example but Jesus Christ on the throne and leave in there no preacher no deacon nobody else right mama notices he says I'll just have to loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait dis loaf are you still going to get a salary you didn't say that it what what's going on they had been saved got rid of a temper been delivered of so many things but now the greatest battle ever false going on to William Branham against brother Branham so it's William Branham against brother William Branham there's only one word difference rather on the word word one word difference swing you and yourself and that's brother or sister god so they all need to sever your friendship to not face up Jordan seven just tell your closest friend move out from this point on I refuse to listen to your life if you say one more lie to me almost smacked you in the mouth well praise the Lord you talk about something to me listen fish and pretty girl for 73 would you do this one favor for me now both hearing on the tapes also you brethren pray that God will place into my heart that's something that I lost out there that complex it's so easy to build a complex now remember complex has nothing to do so you don't get complexes from the blood of Jesus you don't get complexes from the baptism the Holy Ghost you get them from yourself sometimes it comes from other people sometimes are inherited but it's basically the outer two realms I had an interview the other day with my brother way sitting here Sammy here in front a good man but built himself around the complex another kind of a complex did the same thing but the way you can so easy so easily do it it's just Allison how easy it is to build a complex you can so easy good you just get a little something no oh you mean we feel complexes from the mind out more children you get a little something in your mind and keep thinking that way now those of you that are familiar with the service right here when quoting from brother Wei is standing right here in front of brother Brennan pretty close up to the pulpit area his wife is a nurse brother Wei resents what brother Branham says and he dies in a heart attack okay they're in enough ambulances in Carter County in Washington County so for your own health don't resent what's been said tonight [Music] [Applause] now this is serious friend this is not playing now you remember that brother Brennaman by God's grace was able to pray over this man and raise him back up and I hear he talks about this occurrence happening in dimensions in Chicago a few three weeks ago while I was speaking a man standing before sees an Englishman's wife is Norwegian very fine nurse him a very fine man and so the man I was speaking of complexes and the man kind of resented it when I said it I told him a couple years ago when I first met him that he was bothered with a murmur in his heart he hardly didn't want to believe that I think at first and then finally the doctor told him that he had the murmur his art and that morning he had kind of bent a little Torah and when I said that he resented it and quickly dropped dead right on the for oh my fell out on the floor and his wife got down to examine him and he was gone now look at what this man which is very unusual for brother Brennan to do at this wedding I've never found myself anyplace else what he quite did it this way that he would you know expose a person in one sense like and the man it calls him to go in to resemble what you might do any of us the same way so here he calls it out and then the man dies and brother BAM goes and by the grace of God is to say he was able to bring the men back to life again but what do receive in this man now had the complex built from listening to all these things whatever it was that the man was troubled about hearing it exposed publicly caused such a rise inside of this and now it becomes so great and he becomes so resentful toward the prophet of God that his life is cut off momentarily oh god help us from that now you imagine then when we go to believing if yourself is your best friend then when we accept ourselves as our best friend we go to evaluating everything through the filter of that best friend so we will evaluate people we will evaluate situations we will evaluate sermons we will evaluate the way the preacher looks at you if he says a certain thing and then you will evaluate that in your mind now basically your best friend is your filter so you're pulling the word through that filter then you are pulling services and texts and emails and phone calls and so on and so on so you are hearing that as that best friend is interpreting under here see he's on that radix eulogy notice the way he said that about Judas he looked right at you look you know I got to look somewhere and I'll say Judas unless y'all want me to do this I'm not sure how safe that would be I'm afraid I'll fall and hurt oneself bad so you just got to realize and I'll talk about Judas you've got to have enough faith to say he told about me I'm Judas I don't belong to the Judas much I belong to the Jesus much when it talks about Farrell why because you've got a different interpreter in your heart you refuse to allow your best friend just said well that was you and that was you and that was you and you might as well leave you might as well get out this message it ain't for you in the first place and your best friend is trying to lead you to hell are you going to let your so-called best friend lead you to hell oh ma so we'll make your brother branham then we will put the filter of our best friend why our fears our inferiority Tsar complexes and we are also complex don't show us them one reason why we need to change it ain't just to make you young let may be open and honest and frank with you tonight there probably ain't but about maybe a dozen people that I'd want to spend eternity with like we currently are and I probably wouldn't make your dozen less now think of it really would you want to spend eternity was people the way we are now husbands don't don't move don't move husbands you wives don't you even flutter my lord some of you wouldn't want to spend seventy thousand years with your kids what's less eternity don't you see we all have to be changed our nature's already been change what's left the human make up with all of our scars and all of our hurts and all of our peculiarities I read this see last weekend but I thought it was so fitting I want to read it to you again Roy Graham says you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do and you just keep thinking they don't like me and the first thing you'll be shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you after a while it becomes so reality to you you'll actually believe that person doesn't like you now where are you getting this your best friend right your best friend is telling you this and that other person may tell you over and over and over again there's nothing between me and your brother sister I love you with all my heart but going to heaven you know we're going to shout down the streets of gold one day but the best friend will come back say huh sure right now you don't believe that you know we innovated it's a truce Boetticher this is what you need to do in my mouth [Applause] if my brother tells me there's nothing there I'm gonna believe him over you but you see most of us will do that well they'll believe our best friend cuz after all he's been with me all my life he stuck with me through second he's been with me when I had no friends he's probably one reason you ain't got many [Music] because he's telling you it's everybody else he won't be honest and tell you part of the problem is yourself whichever I'm a preacher Lord put this on my heart I'm a priest god help us why but we believe it and we make it so realest and how brother brems brings it you actually believe that that person doesn't like you who like you who which would wanna who you who you are you each one the best friend of course the soul ain't gonna believe no lies it's born again man and your body believes all kinds of stuff that's right so I've got to be changed now you might ballin out or say something telling for instance your wife or your husband or some neighbor someone that when the person is absolutely innocent of any you'll see and it's because that oh why do you have to use that little three-letter word that's your best friend you just imagined it so and where is your imagination in your spirit till it become very hot to you and then your best friend says see okay you ever invite you for a Big Mac y'all ever go to Dunkin Donuts for a cup of coffee don't invite me for coffee I don't walk off see what am i telling you what am i telling you but you see friends it's because our closest friend feels no threat from most of us he knows we just set right now he can lie to us he can spin the yarn and we'll set that we'll never questioned never asked him for proof never asked him for facts it was set right there and swallow down but I hope after tonight some things won't change I'm Patrick tonight by at least the time I get back from Switzerland that some of your old selves is so torn up around 14 xanax a day now physically now but your spiritual self is so nervous that yourself is afraid to open its mouth because you have set down and had a talk with yourself y'all ever do that well you need to sometimes me and me you sit down and have a talk cuz sometimes I get out of hand no I don't want to drink I don't want to run around I don't want to know that cell I just get wore out was preaching it wore out was studying and wore out you know just Dean with all that sort of thing and Donnie says look man you're 60 years old how many pictures do you know that preach three times a week and the message you're too old for this brother Graham said he was a veteran preacher you know how he was when he said that he was 53 I'm 60 so I'm older than he was OMA so you say my god but you need to set on say listen here you need to shut your mouth all could preach them and God says for me to quit preaching either that or they vote me out whichever comes first come on children do you ever just a dance and look here it's time for me and you to have a talk and I'm doing the talking and you're doing a listen you can speak when I give you permission let me start so high and the seed of God my name is on the Lamb's Book before the foundation of the world I was before you was and I'm going to lead you to a body change so set out and shout out I'm fixing to preach you or for our sermon I'm a child of God I'm ordained to live I'm a PI a Happy Valley I'm a part of the bride of Jesus Christ and you're going to follow what I'll say and you're gonna like it do you understand yes sir yes so whatever you say so there you go yeah we're in harmony [Applause] [Music] what's this in perfect faith brother Aaron said I get spells twos you know I get moody I get to a spot what gets me is when these spells I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me listen this nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world now if this was not believable for the film I would say never told him but somehow brother blames feelings or his emotions or you're not keeping relate to it every time people come to him most of the time that's always wanting something prayer for their daughter prayer for the son they lost her keys and he dis that need that you wonder how many people just come to him and want it to be his friend but try to coughs tell me whenever they'd come there and the visit said he'd never try to push him never try to ask all kinds of questions just let him come and just let him run and brother Ben would sit down the table and draw all kinds of spiritual things but they'd never pull on it just let him relax and let him rest and let him life oh oh wow some of you couldn't handle that milk it has to be walking around all the time of the pen and paper in his hand but he was a human being he needed to break away from that yes he did and I thank God there was people that was able to recognize it or drove him insane but you imagine he got to this spot where he was so Moody and overwork and Satan were telling you really ain't got a friend and yet was known around the world by millions just cause people know your name don't mean they're your friend remember I'm not immune to that temptation see I got over OMA I've got to overcome why don't you sing drinking doesn't run around with women dissing smoking so he's got to overcome that who is it William random talkin to brother room I've got to overcome that then when I look back and see something like this now what is relating here to the people is that he won one after and seen the license plates from the different states and all that people had stayed over from the morning service to the Sunday night service some of them will be driving 6 hours 8 hours 10 hours and they've you know they're going to be senators it whenever I see that I get in these moods and I get all that nobody really loves me nobody cares for me and then it amazing church attendance with what helping to overcome you don't know what it feels like would you spend hours and hours and sometimes days preparing a meal and half the church don't even show up how many times that your sister's put up to that and your supper praise the Lord oh I'm sorry y'all didn't realize then huh now this is what was going to over help brother branham to overcome listen to this and then amazing and I'm gonna take that word hallelujah I'm gonna use that scripture I'm going to quote that word oh no what he's going to do is remind Satan I remember a few Sunday nights ago when then people stayed over and drove six hours and eight hours to be in service on Sunday night here you go Dell you mean he's going to use that to combat the devil why preacher and his his flock and sheep are so tied together all sure friends every times you can't be at the house of God but when you're more busy vacation and going here in their livin you are the house of God you don't know how many times your pastor and the preachers that preacher leaves so down because you decided you didn't want to come just stay home and stream and one of these days and you stand before God you're going to be held responsible you're going to be held responsible oh ma notice is that I look back and see something like this notice what he said I put it right back in his face and say what about that what about that oh ma or the devil tells me I'm wasting my time and somebody stands up to preach it rather well with you oh you think well I shouldn't even done and I'm glad you done it because I want to take your face and your hand and your reaction and put it right in the devil's face and say see the devil see our devil it's the truth [Music] Roma can have a few matter what's the complexity of us as human beings now what's your trouble you've had an accident and that accident you were gassed with carbon monoxide gas that's true poisoned you poisoned your liver and you had trouble with that had troubled your stomach the brother says right you had trouble in your heart right so this is a false prophet it's this man's opportunity you're telling me Allah your guest and that ain't right show me one of these that they ever did [Applause] notice this oh ma who can glory I trouble in your stomach the brother says that's right I had trouble in your heart right it's makes you so nervous until you built yourself in a complex you're poor you must go back to work but you're afraid to go back to work you're afraid of that carbon monoxide gas so this mean gets poisoned on the job and it gets poor and he gets sick and he goes to all these things now look what the devil does the devil no doubt the one who caused it in the first place and now the devil is using the very thing that he calls to make the man worse and several more aspects of his life and no doubt telling the whole time if God loves you how come God ain't doing this and this is this he'll put sickness on you and then tell you God any heater boy if we ain't dealing with some kind of devil well if the devil put sickness on you I'm going to tell you God is a healer the army of the devil puts it on I'm part of the army of God that helps cast it off oh my notices but it's going to be alright now remember Jesus ha so tell me who you are Adam thing sure wasn't they if you're tell me who you're but you accepted in no and go on back and be of good cheer will you do it your name is mr. Wagner that's right that's right go on back on your road well I may not have the ability to go down through there until your name is mr. Sol and you remain as mr. Johnson this and that let me tell you what your real name is your real name is the word and let me tell you you well there's a complex about my mama or daddy or something that happened to you as a child our God wants you delivered tonight oh god what's every one of us to be able to fight this great old dad whatever then fall and find it and not only fight it but win Oh notice this a man just educate themselves so they educate themselves away from one another and they get complexes you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love you get love not a complex I'm a little bit bigger than somebody else a little bit better than somebody else can't you see what happens among us this message folks this doctrine and that doctrine and that go where we're bigger than you were the only bride well the only ones this is the bride's revival yeah more complexes we won't have nothing to us one another all nine notices she said you get love I'm bigger than somebody a little better than somebody else I know more than somebody else you just got your arms around everybody and it's a basis of love through the blood the blood cleanses because of this what's this just come in from California the other day and hadn't gotten my suitcase in been home and hadn't been home for two months right at two months got the second suitcase in the phone rang a lady she used to be kind of a girlfriend of mine years ago I used to pastor the mill town Baptist Church and she had two lovely daughters ready to find man Brotherhood he was a millwright that one of his fingers and thumbs cut off very nice brother they had twins and another girl making children the twins are staunch Christians they were ube I'm not sure exactly what that means people but they really believe God wanted a girl on a school she got a complex the girls tell her well why don't you smoke hot we do you think more better than well why don't you go to dances now they didn't go to dances and they didn't smoke or drink and I may find the healthier girl notice in this the healthier girl the healthier girl she said let him jump the river some y'all need her health you know I was emphasizing there for some reason didn't the healthier girl oh my glory to God let him jump in the river I'm the one serving Christ I don't want to I don't know her but the other one she began to think oh maybe I could do something she built a complex got nervous she went insane the header in an institution for two years my friends we're talking about complexes on steroids now that you would listen and think and make yourself your best friend and yourself what actually calls the departure don't ask me how this happens because I don't understand but remember first of this and he says when you went to see her begin to torture you remember the story he had to go out and find her spirit we say she'd lost her mind what does that mean exactly her brain was there the brain matter was there the stem cell was were there the brain all the tissues everything was still there what was it her thinking ability you don't think with your brain you think with your spirit so somehow another her spirit had went roaming this complex had got so severe it caused a breakdown let me tell you something some of you better get a hold of yourself as we say you can't toy with sin this is not something to be played with you better put your foot down on your complexes lest they drive you insane you better put your foot down and know who you are well unless I can find a church somewhere I'm accepted until you get different you'll never find one I wish I wish I could find the perfect Church so let me save you a lot of gas money there ain't no such a thing you better find where God puts you in settle down and set out yourself to shut up shut up I'm we're gone once made of it come on children I'm or will you folks want to go to Pentecost you want to go to Baptist methods go right ahead God call me to this message and in this message I'll die in this message I will rapture I'm not looking to go back to Pentecost why would I want to go back all that nonsense ah we've got the word of the hour a man that I want to tell myself surround Arnie and shut up I'm told of God I'm all dying to God I'm chosen of God I'm the bride of Jesus Christ himself shut up Oh hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Oh Lord so here we go on the palak wind of the king the men of valour are all around us they're fighting their own battles we've got everything we have native and yet we're still raging in our minds for some of you it's your past some of you have complexes because of your looks I understand that I'm not saying it to be funny I think I'm just about one of the ugliest preachers you'll ever see I have complexes about the way I preach I hate the way I preach hate it with a passion I think my style my mannerism there's one thing I like about my preaching that's when I walk out the door all the rest of it you can have it and Satan will always be sure to send people around you who say you preach like a Pentecostal you preach awful you preach that you preset why cuz Satan knows us and then your best friend is taking notes why he wants to talk to you later about it praise the Lord some of you may have complexes because of your financial situation or your family some of you have complexes because you've been married more than once Satan wants try to make you feel like a second-class citizen all the divorce folks up in heaven live over in the debt certain side of town and some of you make them feel that like shame on you lord have mercy there's many hundreds of people that there are here and many more that's here in the service it would probably overwhelming if we knew the complexes the fears and fiora teas I heard it twice this week exit from sisters in our church about always feeling inferior never really feeling loved feeling like they were apart you'd be surprised if the people who come up here and told me and asked me for prayer and say that they have a hard time relating to God loving them the way I preach it because her daddy didn't love him that way or the mother and they pulled that through themselves and when they hear love preached that God loves us so much they have a hard time processing it because the best friend is constantly telling them how long work for you he may love somebody I saw that but he don't love you doctor why it's the way we're made but won't it be wonderful wouldn't it be wonderful when the body change sweeps over on the earth all over there's all around the world some that were raised without a father some that were raised without a mother in the home some the commander divorce families and all just horrible horrible situations and still pack that in them and all of a sudden will be changed back to young men and young women and that part of us them complexes and all that would totally disappear and maybe people in our church or people in the message that you love them as far as loving them in the Lord but you've never really been compatible with them or never really been able to get close to them because of differences in this but if that
