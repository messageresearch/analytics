I pray that you'd help us tonight Lord you see the needs of the people here Lord lower those that are sick Lord our pastor over North Carolina brother Terry still out I know he desires to be here father Lord each everything he that's been mentioned here tonight we pray father that you would come Lord I've got nothing to say Lord in my own personal self Lord that would be of any benefit Lord I've gotten notes put down here Lord but if you don't come Lord it would be a mess they would leave with head not let's Lord and wondering if it was even true but Lord if you come Lord if you open the hearts of each one here deny Authority if you if you would help me get a side Lord because I need from you as well Lord I can't do this without you Lord I look at that back door sitting it off for so many times and every single time I've been there back there Lord I've had such a desire to run out that back door because Lord I though I don't want to say anything that would hinder your bride anything that would stumble some Lord it's such a responsibility to talk to the Queen of Heaven Lord invites you we welcome here Lord to come through these hours Lord see every need father touch each heart and bless the word in Jesus name if you have your Bibles and she could open to Genesis Genesis chapter 126 through 30 I'm thinking my wife and my sons and charity is I preached this in Kentucky a few weeks back and this is kind of part two to that so they'll have to sit through the first part of it I'll try to condense it a little bit but y'all pray that he comes to Hales mirror I'm gonna stumble through it the golden China dishes are in North Carolina tonight so y'all gotta eat it on paper plates and plastic tub but the menus the same I hope so God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he male and female created he VM God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful multiply replenish the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed with some on the face there's every tree in which the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be meat and every beast of the earth and every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life I have given you every green herb for meat and it was so and John one starting to verse three that which we have seen and heard declaring to you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full we got out of the blessings to his word you can be seated in reading that scriptures you might wonder how these two scriptures go together and really there's no tie that I know that I can think of it Hobie's two scriptures together but they stood out to me is what I'm going to speak on tonight the title what of title of giving is what God wants what does God want we reading in John 1 that God wanted fellowship God's desire was fellowship but yet he looks it we look in Genesis and bringing up to that fellowship God created all this everything that there was that God created and he give it to Adam and Eve this was his love for them this is the setting that he made for them that he could come and fellowship with him with them and so we look at you know what what does God want in our own feeble mind we think you know God wants us to live right he wants us to dress right now the sisters you know be modest wear the right modest clothes that don't cut your hair you know no smoking drinking we think you know that's what God wants and that's nowhere even near what God wants that's not what God desired of Adam and Eve and at first if we could we could go back the way that brother Branham did and nice he said God dwelt alone you know and when I was studying this I got to thinking you know God dwelling alone does God ever feel alone when he's with me does God it might never go back to when he he once fellowship to me and I'm not giving him that fellowship does God ever feel lonely does God ever desire that what he wants for me and I'm not giving it to you know so we look at gone brother brain said God dwelt alone stop and think that that for a minute the greatest beam that ever was through eternity that ever will be but he was lonely and yet he had a desire God have had been headed his desire this is a God that could have anything he wanted but has everything that owns everything but there's something he did not have there's something he didn't have and brother Brent said love makes you do things and when the church gets the real love of God in their heart they'll do things they'll not be ashamed Christ don't want you to be to be them so much to be loyal he don't want your Partridge you want your fellowship that's what God wants is to have fellowship with you so we look at God he dwelt alone with it and he wanted fellowship but he starts to create things he creates the chair rooms the angels you know any he looks at his thoughts he starts having thoughts and I know I've touched on this here before when God had his first thought of you his very first thought of you brother Jim when he thought of me the very first minute his heart began to beat that's for the second when he had that thought of you his heart began to beat out of his chest he never lost that the heart the very faint when he had that thought of you the very first desire God had was I wanna have fellowship with Gene so everything that God purposed when he said let there be light his purpose behind that was fellowship and with Gene his purpose was to fellowship with brother Greg with brother Roberts that was his thought and everybody needs to get that in their mind that when God thought of you he didn't have a better thought of anybody else than you you were his main thought you were his main purpose you are what drove God to create I've got a few quotes here and I've got a lot of quotes according to brother Bradley brother Bradley said they took him forever to put them all in there but I don't have that many I do have some but Bram said in the Easter seal now there's a great statement I want my ministry brothers to try to understand this in the beginning God the Great Spirit he wasn't even God then he was the eternal one he wasn't even God God was an object of worship so if there's nothing to worship you how can it be God he couldn't even call himself God he can't say I'm God because there was no one there to worship me and then when he began to create and he created cherubims and angels they couldn't have fellowship they didn't understand we've got to understand what God wanted to fellowship to us every attribute that he was he couldn't he couldn't fellowship with angels and say hey let me tell you about how a huge let me tell you how it redeems you how I pulled you out of sin angels could never understand that this was parts of God that he was desiring to push out to reveal that's why there was the fall in the garden was never a mistake that was not a mistake Satan didn't take God by surprise in the Seavey's not knew who was gonna happen all alone Eve had to fall so he can have fellowship with me Eve had to be deceived so he can fellowship with each of us so he can reveal himself as a redeemer that was God's purpose so what do we think what God wants God wants fellowship so here he began to create and his thought of you when he has his thought of you he says let there be light that's one step closer to fellowship to you then he says let there be let there be the earth the waters the trees each time he speaks each time he speaks a thought brother branham said when he said let there be that was God expressing a thought God Express the thought so he says let there be and in his mind he goes that's one step closer to by the West that's one step it might be millions and billions of years by the West before he would get to you but you were still thought Brooke Maps had had fellowship with you and his thoughts before the foundation of the world he had fellowship so this was his desire have you ever wonder I don't know how this came to me I could say was a father God he every you want to look how God still projects his thoughts he's still projecting his thoughts today every single day well you have a minister get up here to speak to you he had taken thought that God gave him then he gets up here and it's God projecting the thought it's not a thought of a man but still God projecting his thoughts you know never end they'll never become no more thoughts will never have not another thought God will say wow that was my last thought that it will all go home what Graham said eternity will never fully Express everything that God is God will take you turn to you to express his thoughts to each other it'll take you turn to express his thoughts just to one of you how he feels about you can you imagine God sitting for eternity eternity eternity would end before God would be finished tell you how he feels about you eternity would be over before God could fully express his feelings towards you in studying that just overwhelming that you know above all that God wanted all he had everything he had he didn't have to let he didn't have to let Adam Adam and Eve fall he didn't have to let the live even to be deceived here was at him in God's own image why couldn't God be happy with that having everybody like that right there he speak him and here they are they're standing here in the garden their their name in it there's millions and billions of people in the garden that were spoke why couldn't God be happy with that God could never ever expressed to Adam himself as a healer he could never Express to Adam himself as a redeemer till after Calvary it had to happen I don't mean to be stuck in this one spot y'all forgive me he wasn't even God then he was the eternal one here's an object of worship he had nothing to worship him there were no angels no nothing just God alone him alone in eternal is eternal but in order to be God there had to be something to worship him so he created angels and beings in cherubims and so forth to worship Him his plan began to unfold so God had a plan he had a plan he had a purpose but Bramson the greatest fellowship man could ever have is he fell ship with Jesus Christ it's that simple it's that's we complicate things so much I'm trying to I've got to do this I've got to do this I've got to do this if you read the definition of fellowship if you go into the Strong's and look at the definition of a fellowship there's so many words in it for I'll just put it this way mix company its intimate relations you haven't felt with Jesus Christ there's going to be a birth there's going to be a birth it's going to birth healing it's going to birth deliveries it's gonna it's gonna birth redemption salvation this is this is the fellowship that God requires but then we complicate it we feel like we we've got to we get so in our mind how worship is and we I'm getting jumping way ahead of myself but I can't help you get into it we we look at God sometimes in we worship God sometimes in this form of idol worship I don't worship I hope they don't some of you feel and I'll tell you where I'm going with this with God all we do is we approach God we we bow down God I need this I need this I need this our prayer life becomes a ritual God thank you for the day thank you for my food lord help me as I sleep and that becomes our life that's idol worship that's not fellowship to worship God is to fellowship with God it's a daily walk fellowship with God is a daily walk and when we turn our daily walk into worship of graven image I hope that's almost humble you but and I don't mean to say it in calling God an idol but that's that's the way we approach this so many times it becomes a ritual it becomes a tradition and then God is just something that's a part of our day and not our whole day God needs to be your day no I don't least need to be a part of your day he needs to be your day everything needs to come second hey I'm preaching to myself I'm feeling awful bad up here right now because I find myself focusing on the things I've got to do of the day and I forget I forget I thought Lord I had this name back here I meant to talk to you about and I'll let it go but this is God's desire his fellowship and we look at it so many ways look God you know when you took your first breath of life I'm not even off my first page here I apologize when you took your first breath of life and God placed that part of him down in you do you realize that part of God that's inside of you requires worship that's God that's God and then you know only God Himself knows how to worship that you can't worship fact it takes God to worship that you've been driving down the road you in your office and you feel something warm come over you can't explain it and you don't want it to go away we don't understand how God worships us we don't understand how many can tell me how God worships you how does God worship you oh well not out of order I want to do something here this is God worshiping that God it's not going to come up to brother ways to kneel down and say I'm worshipping that part of me that's in brother West God's not going to do that here's God worse than you how's your day today buddy Geoffrey good day yes you know I love you don't you you remember you remember way back many years ago you used to go through all them terrors at night all the things used to deal with and you had all of his hatred beat it just kind of built up in you you remember all that yes sir you know I never left I was there the whole time there was one time there was one time Wes it Michael wanted to come down there and run them off and I went Letty I went Letty I said he's got a part of me in here me he don't need you down there right now you wait to see what he's gonna be in the future this is why here's gonna Mull this is God worshiping brother Wes you know there's I heard somebody say the other day that you rhond them Peter you look like him and everything Peter's excited to meet you so from what I've heard he's already waiting by the gate but this is God worship this is on what God's worship to us that's God's fellowship thank you brother we're sore but that's the way God worships us that's God's desire of us and he had this thought of you all right we can sit here go through this all night and our human thoughts cannot contain contain all this we can't contain it but this fellowship brings harmony we wonder so many times we got things in our lives when we get desires in our life that we have needs in our life and we wonder you know what God why is this happening why is not this happening why am I going through these things that I'm going through and you wonder I've checked myself with this so many times most of the time it's because I'm not fellowship and like I'm supposed to thank God saying I'm allowing this I'm allowing this your son and daughters of God the first time God ever had a thought of you and and he does that in his thoughts you were elected that never changed it's an eternal thought when it leaves God it comes back to God it'll never change your eternal destination will never change ever it's impossible for your eternal destination to change if you were a thought of God God's thoughts will always come back to him always so you even though you go through life and you think you know what it's been three days and I meant to listen to this message I meant to read my Bible and God's checking you could put something in your life he'll put a problem not because he hates you it's because he loves you and he's doing that to turn you the other way he wants to turn you aside to fellowship talk to him about the problem God wants to hear about your problems but let's not get to a point that's all we tell God what God was telling by the West but God by the West God was to hear that back God I had a wonderful day today thank you for that I had the situation of work and you fix it just like that know what I want to thank you for that that's fellowship - god that's that's his children worshiping look at your own children which my kids are spoiled they can say but they are I my wife would say something the other day about I get feel bad about getting on Michael and then I go buying something he's the baby of the families but that's that's you know when you project yourself to your children there's nothing never going to change but through your children there's nothing I never change how you love them and that's the same way God protects himself but it's infinite times more than that in studying inside got to looking at different quotes your brother branham said about fellowship and I'm gonna jump around both Daniels so you'll you can get me afterwards in God and fellowship through reconciliation of the blood and 55 he's talking about Adam and Eve in beginning and God made man in his own image he put him in the Garden of Eden he had perfect fellowship perfect God didn't want it any other way it was perfect what was he saying Adam you did everything perfect you done it just like I would have done it you did everything perfect so God said he had perfect fellowship it was late in the afternoon the evening when the twilights were falling I could see the great Jehovah come across the top of the palm trees the roaring of the Thunder when Adam and Eve gathered their gathered there in the open the great open-air cathedral worship God had fellowship talked with him it was like this for who knows how long Bible doesn't say hell could have been billions of years but Adam had fellowship then Adam fail but the Branham said question answers law having a shadow there you are then the great picture of the fellowship was broken God can't talk to his people no more he done said so when God speaks he's got to keep his word I told Adam on that day you eat thereof that day you die he's got to keep his word he's got to but he said I've got to talk to him he said I can't I got to cut him off but something inside said I've got to get to him I've got to talk to him God does the same thing to you to me when we fall God don't say I told you not to do that we can never understand the love of God when we fall when we make mistakes Adam was just the type look what Adam did we'll new we'll never do anything we'll never do anything to talk what Adam did as far as fallen he destroyed the entire human race have you done that have you made that big of a mistake and God redeemed him back God said I'll bring him back if you've done something worse than that oh you're on your own my brains said yeah I've got to talk to him so God went over and got some sheeps Kim brought them old bloody sheep skins back throw them back in the bushes as I said put them all here come at him and he's wrapped up in them old sheep skins the Bramham said when you come God came running through the garden calling for Adam if you're centered autre of God when you fall when you make mistakes God desires fellowship with you so much you're come looking for you you didn't come into this message on your own you didn't decide one time to join this message if you're here tonight it's because God called you you didn't tell him one day Lord I think I'm gonna serve you today man does not have that in him man cannot put that in you it has to come of God and in what we was talking with brother Wes that part that's inside you is God so you can't say well I call out to God know if you made a call that's strong enough for God to answer it's God calling it you can't call God it's God go back and listen to deep call till the deep bed will clear everything up for you but Graham said they made themselves to religion they joined the church somewhere I thought they was going to get by with a fig leaf Church sorry Daniel I'm jumping on you you know just hide behind something hide behind something that's the human thing to do we make mistakes blame it on something else I will promise you you will feel so much better if you claim the blame your trials went in so much quicker instead of you trying to figure out who done it we're talking about fellowship tonight we're only human we're going to make mistakes we're going to fall we're going to stumble but don't blame God don't blame something else say Lord forgive me I've done wrong go to your brother go to your sister who would whoever you wronged and make it right don't behind behind something but when they went out to stand in the presence of God their fig leaf religion didn't hold up here he comes out with blood running over his manly shoulders look at Eve let's draw a picture that pretty little thing Adam's sweetheart and wife his darling and here she comes out and blood running down her legs here's Adam and the blood running off his shoulders I see you around his collar here where it's wrapped around his shoulders the blood shagging in his hair look at little Eve her head bent down the MOE bloody skins walk out before God they were no longer in fellowship only way God could speak to him something had to die it's a perfect type of Christ I was listening to fellowship through reconciliation in the blood today brother Branham was talking talking he talking about I had him you know the he said here he come walking out of the garden God drove them out of the guard here he comes with these bloody skins hanging on him and that that blood slapping him then bloody skins slapping his leg but Ram said I think of Jesus Christ he said here he goes this man with his white robe on dragging this cross he said you can see little bitty dots of red on the back of that red robe he said in the further he went the bigger them little spots got he said by the time he reached the bottom of the hill of Calvary it was one big spot and then I begin to run he said in that robe got bloody and that robe begin to spat and slapped Jesus on the legs God's covering for your sin God's covering to bring you back into fellowship perfect top he said brother branham said here here these this bloody robe was smacking the second Adam as he's carrying the cross no longer in fellowship but God says I'll bring you back in Parden in 63 well Bram says until the church gets to a place and away from its rituals and back to God's original plan there that men are born into the kingdom of God not joined in church that is the time that fellowship will reign everywhere the Spirit of the Lord will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea when it comes to a place that men forget their differences and come together in fellowship under the blood we can all come under the baptism of the tree the Baptist tradition the Presbyterian traditional methods tradition on the Pentecostal tradition but we can all meet and fellowship under the blood of Jesus Christ because that's God's original plan so we looked at God's plan I've gotten my notes here and God's plan and I've already preached about it so before you can have a desire of godly fellowship it has to be a God here to desire that and there has to be a god to respect that desire to fellowship with you know in and that's morning when God drops that in us when God drops that down in our hearts you wonder what that feeling is when you want to you miss church you have to go somewhere you get sick and you can't be here then you feel that feeling you hate not happy to be here that's not humanly that's not you will you miss these brothers and sisters that are not here when we miss brother Terry not being here because the God in me desires to fellowship with the God in him you know and you a lot of times will you hear people say well I just can't fellowship with with him and he just this she's your sister what do you bring into the fellowship what do you bring in is it because you can't fellowship them because you're approaching them humanely something about them if you got the same God if you got no don't get me wrong on this everybody's different God likes a variety and some people don't click but there's some people that shun some people because they can't feel like they can fellowship with him they believe something a little different than they do let me tell you something I've got a friend and y'all pray for him he had his name's Roger Ambrose he's Rogers probably in his 60s probably him about six in his 60s 70 a better Christian than Roger Ambrose that lives what he believes he's Baptist he's Baptist I love being around every time I'm around Roger Ambrose he gets me wanting to go to heaven quickly well the Roger his wife died about two years ago you start talking about the Lord within two minutes he's in tears well we like that I can fellowship with that I can fellowship with Roger because we have we have something kindred we love fellowship with the father if we ever get to the place that we can't fellowship with somebody because they don't see this message the way we see it the way they see it because you believe something different it's a belong altar it's long and I promise you they'll leave the doors unlocked long as you're down here you never get to to the point that we're too good to worship for somebody that don't believe the way we believe out of however many people that go this church I promise you there's people that see doctrine different that's human nature but we get to the point that we can't fellowship one with the other and then we come into church sometimes we can't fellowship with God in church that's human I mean that happens you got things on your mind you got bills you your mom's in the hospital you dad's in hospital or you're sitting here Warner of Tennessee one or not I've done it I've done it we've all done it if he likes fourths but I mean that that's a fact that's the fact we can't get into fellowship I found Michael Bailey in the bathroom one time checking his phone I really didn't but I hated getting back for something he told me today but seriously that's we need to come in you know with with our hearts with a purpose in our hearts to fellowship with God lately you have everything back there that we can leave it outside the doors you know that's God's desire would you want to walk in here would you want to walk in here not having the same desires God and you sit here you waiting for the the only way you can pull on this minister is if you have the same desire that God does that's the only way you can pull on him God's desires to fellowship by giving you one of his thoughts God's projecting his thoughts to you and you can't pull because your thoughts are somewhere else so if every single person in here we come in here every single time myself included we're human we get distracted that's that's human nature we make we're going to make mistakes in this whole body till we leave but if if we could purpose every single time I mean we've come here three times a week and for three times a week we can say tonight I'm walking through them doors leaving everything outside my purpose is to fellowship with God my purpose is to pull a net minister I have needs than things that I left outside the door those are my needs so when I go back out what I receive tonight I can apply those to their needs but if you bring those needs in here with you and let them ponder over your mind worried and in doubt and what am I going to do Lord bills are due and I'll leave that outside leave that outside you can't bring that into the presence of God leave it outside in fellowship it's an intimate relationship where you fellowship God you will birth a need you will you will birth something that will take care of your needs there's a birth that comes with fellowship it's an intimate communication that's what God desires let's look at Joe by talk about Jobe and every sermon I preached just about because Jobe is me Jobe is me and I love Joe is I be not afraid brother Ram said in 59 and Jobe came by the way of blood the shedding of blood that's the only grounds that God ever fellowship with a man his own basis of the shed blood there's no other way that God will fellowship with people only through shed blood that's how Calvary bought the fellowship to you without Calvary there's no fellowship with God there's without Calvary there's no way that God put that part of him inside you but when you took that first breath because God will not put himself on a sin body unless it's through the blood in the Old Testament Israel to come to a place of worship that was under the shed blood and when trouble struck Joe he would scream out I know my Redeemer liveth in the last days he'll stand on the earth though after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see God and he was screaming though he slay me yet I'll trusting he know what path to turn when he got in trouble he did for a little while Joe got on the ash heap his thoughts got a little different and I've got a quote Ryan got it with me where operator here before where le you came to job and said you've accused God wrong so job falls out of fellowship all these trials job thanks he's fell out of fellowship all these trials are heaped upon him he's lost everything he's lost his kids you think God don't love him no more so when job's mine I'm no longer having fellowship with God I can't fellowship with God anymore God don't like me he's gonna take taking everything of God there's no more fellowship every one of us can put herself in there we've went through them times where we feel like God's not speaking to us we can't hear and we sit there on our ass heaping we cry God don't love me no more God don't ain't spoke to me in a we've have you spoke to him sometimes God waits for you speak to him and most of time it it's not because you want something if you look at fellowship fellowship has nothing to do with requests we request God for this we request God for that and that's great Calvary was there so we can bring our needs our request to him but what if that's extensive our fellowship what if that's how we're bringing to God and so jobs on this ash heap it looked like his fellowship was over well God God's his fellowship was gone there we always sit on our ass cheap sometimes international bein we got financial problems cancer sickness these are our assets everybody's got an ass heap and we sit on this ash heap like Joe the problem with job is jokes have lowered him the flower dies and this message reconciliation of the blood brother Bram said the flower dies the petals fall off the grass goes leaves and it comes back but when I die I'm not coming back so he's accusing God that he can't redeem me he's saying God you can't redeem me Ellie who said you use God wrong but Branham called le who the little prophet he said he came to Java said you've accuse got wrong you heard him the last three four weeks you've you've heard God responds to Jo what have you done what have you done I've done all this but you've done nothing new you are sitting on your ass heap complaining that I can't bring you back brother Branham says him he said I do have it here I'm sorry he begin to straighten Joe bops head look Joe I'm not accusing you of being a secret Center but you've accused God wrong and now joke said ìlook I've noticed the trees they die they live again flower seed drops in the ground it lives again but man laughs down yeh he gives up his ghost his sons come to mourn and perceive it not he don't raise up no more he lays there oh that thou can hide me in the grave and distressed honest man getting a little bit of child training we still require some of that child training I'm gonna have to hurry I'm gonna get behind if this was June as long as I preach this was June y'all be getting out with sunup what if God required us to have fellowship the way they did in the Old Testament Lord of God required you to have fellowship once a year you could enter into the holiest of Holies in Shekinah glory of God through a certain certain way the only one way you could do it you had to find a red heifer you had to kill her outside the camp good to burn er you had to bring the blood here to mix the ashes with the water for the water of separation and the priest had to put seven stripes of blood over the door I've told the by the richest church town of Kentucky we couldn't we didn't have enough herds there wouldn't be no cows left in the country me one month I mean how many if you wanted to enter into the worship in the Shekinah glory with God every day there'd be a lot of dead cows it'd be a lot of dead heifers so what if God requires that of you and here it is once a year this was what they had to do be able to fellowship with God one time one time Tanner and brother Branham said he knew they would go in there and it would get all smoky in the holiest of Holies and they were enter into the Shekinah glory said then people would stand up say what's wrong with him people in there that's what they should be saying about your life what's wrong with them you should be in the Shekinah glory and fellowship on gana people looking at your life and saying what is wrong with that person the fellowship they've been and into the glory of God their fellowship and with God it's just you and him can you lose your fellowship can you lose it a lot of times in our life we get to feeling feeling like you know I haven't felt the Lord in a while I've done something or you might balk max lie you fall out of fellowship with God in here you you backslide and you don't have that anymore when you have things of your life your troubles and trials your life you have no way to turn because you've left God you haven't been to church in six months you're doing things you shouldn't do and you get out from under the fellowship of God I dunno I spent many years back slid many years never did one single thing that I ever didn't think that I was doing wrong not one time I knew it every time I done it I knew I was doing wrong something in my heart said you shouldn't be doing that something there was something still in there you'll never take that out you could never take that out what was that and inside they're saying that's wrong don't you do that I did it anyway what was that here we go back to that little moment when you took your first breath and God placed that part of him can we ever fathom that that God placed part of him inside you when you go walking around going where you go day to day you're walking around with a piece of God inside of you a piece of the eternal creator inside of you can you ever fathom that human minds will never fathom but here God says I thought of you before the foundation of the world I'm holding that thought to when you come it might be billions of years before you ever come on this earth and when you took your first breath God never forgot the thought he never forgot the thought he takes that thought of you that he and places it in there and you're his favorite person you're his favorite why would you not be why would hold a thought for billions and billions and billions in years if it's not dear to you you can't hold a thought that long if you didn't like it but God says I'll place that thought right down in brother West that's my thought I thought of this before the foundation of the world and now I'm putting it in him it may be many years before he knows it's there but there was things even when he but before I ever heard of this message there was things that struck his heart might not do that something that he couldn't explain it they couldn't explain it but he was in there so can you ever fall and stay fallen out of fellowship it's impossible it's impossible if God ever had a thought of you ever one single thought you're an eternity you're eternal listen this both Bram said in fellowship God wanted fellowship and if we no matter if meant today is a fallen son of God there are some parts of God still in that man in his fallen state you take a man today that can split an atom a molecule or whatever you want to call it you can drive a jet plane around the world in a few hours you can see that he is sometimes he is a fallen creation he cannot create anything he can revert what has been created is something better himself that shows that man man never came from animal life because animal can continually builds the same habitations to live in but man makes him a better house but a way of living better closed better transportation now all that shows there's something behind even in his following state he's the son of God fallen and then when he wants fellowship and when we get courtship and things like that it's blown a basis of agreement so you've got a son or daughter that's back slid you're backslidden you're in a place that you know you're not right with God I've actually had people tell me they want to come back to church but they think they went too far if you have a desire to come back Ewing went too far God says I put that if God placed that in you before the foundation of the world if you ever lose it he and God God's never lost a thing and so if you can stay in that following condition if you can stay there with that peace of God in you if you can stay fallen he's not God you may stay in that condition for years but when God quickens that thought there's going to be one day God's gonna quicken the thought you might be driving down the road and all sudden you just feel overwhelmed it's God's time for you you start thinking all you've done you think Lord I shoulda never done that I've got to get right with God you may take the loss of a loved one you may take a trial in your life that you know there's no way that I'm gonna get over this trial it may take something major in your life to quicken that little seed that was put in there before the foundation of the world but God's gonna quicken it it's impossible for you to stay falling if you have a part of God in you because God cannot fall I'm what I'm gonna jump here I'm taking too long what if God just as he did it in Adam just spoke a body here he is he speaks his body he steps into it but he did that and from that time to this what God had done that there'll be no sin there will be no sin here of all the things that we have today it'd be nice we could speak to trees mountains whatever what if God did that we think you know that would be nice you would never know him as a healer you would never know when there's a redeemer you would never know him as a savior these are attributes that God had there's not one single attribute that God has that he doesn't want to reveal to you the only way he can reveal that to you is through fellowship so feed had done that God's desire was to inhabit a man inhabit man inhabit fallen man through the blood I was tell I don't know after we were down in there Christmas I was talking to my brother not feel I said you realize when God spoke that body going to to fellowship with Abraham God the Creator spoke a body took the elements out of the ground and spoke a body and stepped into it even in that body God was not satisfied he was not satisfied this was a sinless body created body brand-new spoke it from the 16 elements of the earth and he speaks his body and to exist in steps into it and you think man that would be great but God says this ain't what I want this is that body did not satisfy God's ultimate desire to fellowship he could fellowship with Abraham in this body he could fellowship with him God's realtors are was it in habit Abraham was to be inside Abraham to be inside of you so you know the God the Creator that he could done anything he wanted look at yourself if we can look at ourselves through our own human eyes look at the things that you've done in your life that nobody knows about look how dirty and filthy that you are we're dirt WordArt there's things very there I dare say there's not anybody here that don't have a secret I've got him everybody's got secrets you would be ashamed if anybody knew but God said I want to live in that I want to live in that I want to live in that that's what I want to live in that dirt I want to live inside that dirt we can't comprehend it that was God's fellowship and here God wants to reveal himself revealing look at the way God chooses to reveal himself he reveals himself through the word to the word that's not all God uses creatures of time and implements of time to reveal himself how else would you know what all God created we brother Donnie V stick this stuff up here on the screen we see all the stuff that God created how would you know if God didn't take took a creature of time a man that's possibly a creature of time come inside him in his mind his mind and he puts together this thing they call the telescope and there's God builds his telescope back in the 1920's 1930's he begins to develop a telescope and starts looking in the galaxies and say hey y'all those little bright lights we sit there those ain't stars those are galaxies Edwin Hubble 1920s so God uses a creature of time to develop an implement of time to look into the eternal and then as time evolves men get smarter smarter God allows it God allows it man to get smarter to build these telescopes so they can see him light-years away and take pictures that we stand in our house would you know how great of a God created that God was if you didn't see it if God didn't use these implements of time such as a smartphone where you can look at it a laptop a projection screen that you can look at God's creation these are implements of time but God is usually needs to reveal himself and on it to eternity when these implements of time fade away then God can tell you about himself he can show you himself I'm gonna wind down here in study in this I got to thinking about Peter you know Peter you know he thought he done lost all fellowship after he denied Christ three times and it's just this is projected even more when we see him running to the tomb and he gets slower and slower and slower put yourself in Peters shoes when you look at Peter you thinking Peters thinking when I get there he's gonna say depart from me I never knew you you denied me I don't fellowship with you anymore Peter was the only one that he projected himself love to when he got there he loved him all but he wanted to he wanted to stress to Peter the love Peter do you love me you know I do Lord Peter do you love me when he was instructing him to feed his sheep this was God's trust in him this was him trusting and will give myself to you and will give my word to you you're gonna go feed my sheep because I love you and you love me so Peter in his human mind you realize the blood had already been shed his sins were covered the blood had already been shed but it Satan got in here devil was telling him when you get there ain't gonna have nothin to do with you you remember when he says when the crows three times you'll deny me and he did how many times has Satan got in our mine it says because you've done that God ain't gonna talk to you God don't have nothing to do with you people will actually leave fellowship over something that will quit church over something they done and afraid what people think sorry what God things listen long as I know I've got a part down here I got a part of God living inside of me it don't matter what anybody thinks long as I have fellowship with him and he has fellowship with me listen I'm gonna fail I'm gonna fall gonna make mistakes I'm gonna make people mad that's human nature that's human nature there was a thought that I had him will close now but here you go on account brother David Siler I was at his church about 3-4 weeks ago ain't preached his sermon called God remembers and it really struck my heart he's talking about God then how God wrote had this book that he wrote the sins of these people and God remembered that and cast him out but he there's another group that the things they did they said God remembered and he wrote him down and God remembered but the striking thing that he brother David said that really just sunk how I was studying some of this at the time that he said that he said when God looks at you what God remembers is the very first thought he had of him so when he looks at you when he looks at you in your faults and your failures the mistakes that you've made he looks at you and he still sees that first thought because God can't see you through anything but the blood and you're a thought of God and when he he projects himself to you and you project back and this fellowship that's how God sees if I'm having fellowship with a brother gene I'm having felt your brother Wes you know your fellowship as I said earlier your fellowship back to God is if God's just worship that's worship when you tell God how you feel God I had a wonderful day today it ain't all about tell him you're hot about all your problems God's concerned don't get me wrong God is concerned about your problems but he loves fellowship intimate communication so Strong's caused this word fellowship in the Bible intimate communication that's the kind of communication I have with my wife I don't talk to I don't fellowship with anybody else like I fellowship with her you shouldn't fellowship with anybody else like you fellowship with God you shouldn't fellowship with anything in your life like you fellowship with God if you're giving something else more fellowship than you're giving God my daughter might ought to rethink who you're what you're giving fellowship to let's stand I hope this was a blessing to you [Applause] I was thinking thought I was singing this song today my brother here you don't mind to sing it you know I was reading that that part one he said you ever never get falling into that in that place when your fallen condition that little part of God and you haven't had that fellowship in a long time you desire that fellowship but you think you too you're too far gone it's been a long time since you felt to fellowship yeah I think often about one brother branham said God they didn't speak to him for a long time because he went with some brothers when he wasn't supposed to and the brother in he said God he got he didn't feel God and I got to thinking that I was singing a song by the hair if you could sing it so and bring back the new again this is my desire if I ever get to a place every one of us if you could remember that one time when you receive the Holy Ghost I can think it's been years then I was sitting right back there when I received the Holy Ghost I've sitting round fronted by the Loess we hadn't been in this church very long I can think about that moment today I've never felt nothing like it since I have felt his presence a lot but that one moment when he comes down and he just washes you full and you think you know this is what Jesus must have felt like every day this is what Jesus must have felt like this every day and you get that feeling come over in then it goes away now you might go a week to month or you get in a hard place in your life and you're more worried about this issue in your life then you are fellowship with God and it's it's a while since you feel anything you think Lord remember that time back there when I was sitting in the back and you can fill me with the Holy Ghost I want to feel that again that's my desire that would just mean God alone we were fellowship come back I didn't care you saw me I didn't care God saw me let this be our prayer [Music] it seemed the world was mine I had joy I had springtime but that's all just a memory anymore furgus I took my's of you lord [Music] [Applause] but I don't want this callus peeling

we be gay how did I miss the road when did who's the glory where did undergo bring back the new again before we go if we could is we're gonna fellowship with him for a minute don't mean to keep using you I can't sing I sing that song what a beautiful name fellowship with you that's what we're here for that's what He desires make it personal you know it's it's not just a name what Bram said he is the name so if you can fellowship back to him he'll fellowship back to you I mean he's glad through your experience years of experience with the Lord that he's kept calling you never strayed away from him and you just like brother joe said the deep start calling and you might have got cold but something was calling you ain't you glad for that part if you don't mind I'll sing just a little bit of
