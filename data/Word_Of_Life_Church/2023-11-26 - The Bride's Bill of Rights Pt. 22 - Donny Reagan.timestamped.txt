[45:17] like to make an announcement brother
[45:20] William Smith and Sister Abigail buts
[45:23] from down in Louisiana got engage
[45:26] engaged um this past week and we want to
[45:29] wish them a congratulations on that
[45:31] they've got a tenative wedding date set

[45:41] married I hope Jesus comes first amen
[45:45] but we're happy for them and so grateful
[45:47] can we give them a nice
[45:54] hand a talk to the other day and I was
[45:56] making some references I always do
[45:58] whenever I talk to couples that's that's
[46:00] getting engaged want to get married and
[46:03] and I mentioned something that brother
[46:05] Matt Watkins had preached on Sunday and
[46:08] brother Williams said well to be honest
[46:10] I didn't get much out of the service
[46:11] Sunday because I was going to ask her to
[46:12] marry me so I was so nervous that so he
[46:15] must have been pretty tore up so I'm not
[46:17] sure if his words should say no or he
[46:19] scared of her daddy or what it was but
[46:22] he was really tore up so we're we're
[46:24] happy for them let's turn to James
[46:26] chapter 4: 7 if you would
[46:29] today I'd like to speak to you again
[46:32] today on the brides Bill of
[46:34] Rights as a child of God we have so many
[46:38] things that the Lord has purchased for
[46:41] us as his people like a lot of other
[46:44] rights people don't know them always but
[46:49] sometimes it takes um people that are
[46:52] acquainted and equipped to be able to
[46:54] get into the law in the sense of the law
[46:57] of the land in this situation the word
[47:00] to be able to bring out things that are
[47:03] obvious and very plain to see once you
[47:05] do see them uh to help us to see what is
[47:08] more of ours James chapter 4 verse 7 so
[47:13] I'd like to open up today on our right
[47:17] for Satan to flee from us amen our right
[47:24] our God
[47:26] given right that we have to make Satan
[47:32] flee from us
[47:36] amen submit yourselves
[47:39] therefore to
[47:41] God now notice how James puts this
[47:44] together two great things first of all
[47:49] submit the Greek word is
[47:52] hutas it means to be put under
[47:56] or be subject
[47:59] unto to submit oneself
[48:04] to it's a Greek military term to arrange
[48:10] troop
[48:11] divisions in a military fashion under
[48:15] the
[48:16] command of a leader and remember Paul
[48:19] was a very great intellectual man filled
[48:22] with the Holy Ghost of course but he
[48:24] would use military terms he would use
[48:27] terms that would appli to the Roman
[48:29] circus he used a great variety of things
[48:32] to be able to preach the gospel and this
[48:34] was one of them in the non-military use
[48:37] it was a voluntary attitude of giving
[48:43] in a voluntary attitude of giving in
[48:49] cooperating assuming
[48:52] responsibility and carrying a burden so
[48:57] this is the first part submit yourselves
[49:01] therefore to God so I believe both parts
[49:04] apply to us really in the military
[49:06] aspect and also the natural aspect
[49:08] because we too are in an army the army
[49:11] of the Lord so we find our position and
[49:13] there we stay and we submit under that
[49:16] and the real people of God have no
[49:18] problem knowing that God has leaders in
[49:21] the body in the Army and then the other
[49:24] aspect is that we submit to God the key
[49:28] to us being able to resist Satan part
[49:30] two of this verse is obeying part
[49:33] one submit yourselves therefore to
[49:37] God
[49:39] resist the
[49:41] devil
[49:42] resist the devil I want you to listen to
[49:45] this carefully and he will flee from you
[49:50] so while you yield to God in all things
[49:54] you don't yield to the devil and
[49:59] anything I'm afraid sometimes we have it
[50:01] in our mind that Satan is this all
[50:05] powerful being that can make us do
[50:08] whatever he wants to that is contrary to
[50:11] God's word he cannot make you do
[50:17] anything if you're filled with the Holy
[50:19] Ghost he cannot it's against God's word
[50:24] for him to be able to make you oh the
[50:27] devil made me do it the devil made me do
[50:29] it that's a lie if you're born
[50:32] again submit yourselves therefore to God
[50:36] resist the devil now listen how positive
[50:39] this is and he
[50:42] will not maybe not perhaps he
[50:48] will
[50:50] flee listen this word
[50:52] flee
[50:54] Escape seek
[50:57] safety by flight Amen to escape
[51:02] safely out of
[51:06] danger you mean the devil will do that
[51:09] to us why because you are
[51:15] dangerous you're dangerous I see most of
[51:18] us do you consider yourself as dangerous
[51:21] to hell would you consider yourself as
[51:24] dangerous to the devil this is why we
[51:27] need to know our
[51:29] rights resist the devil and he will
[51:34] everybody say those two words with me he
[51:38] will you believe
[51:41] it he will
[51:44] flee from you not you flee from him but
[51:49] he will flee from you prise the Lord may
[51:53] the Lord have the blessings to his word
[51:55] you may be
[52:03] seated Satan makes his way and secures
[52:07] his
[52:09] triumphs and his
[52:11] victory by
[52:14] Art
[52:16] deceptions
[52:18] cunningness not by
[52:21] strength not because he's greater than
[52:25] you you but by
[52:27] art by
[52:29] deception by being
[52:32] cunning studying the human race studying
[52:35] you and I knowing our weakness knowing
[52:39] what we're vulnerable to so by art by
[52:45] cunning by
[52:46] deception and by threatenings as well
[52:50] Satan is the original terrorist oh my
[52:58] the original terrorist is the
[53:01] devil so what does he try to do try to
[53:05] instill
[53:07] Terror on the children of
[53:09] God and he's very cunning he's very
[53:13] deceptive and he's had a lot a lot of
[53:18] opportunities to do it on the human race
[53:22] so it's not that he really had
[53:25] true
[53:27] courage I find it amazing we take what's
[53:30] going on in Israel and and Gaza and all
[53:33] that and you're familiar with it of
[53:35] course and a lot of these Hamas
[53:38] leaders the top three Hamas leaders one
[53:44] of them's worth is $4
[53:48] billion the other one is $4
[53:52] billion the number three man from hamar
[53:56] is worth $3
[53:58] billion wonder where they got all that
[54:01] money now then poor Palestinians who
[54:05] live under their reign of terror many of
[54:08] them even without war going on they live
[54:11] from one thing to another you understand
[54:12] that Israel sends water sends
[54:15] electricity sends Diesel and sends fuel
[54:18] over to them people and let tens of
[54:21] thousands of them I saw them when I was
[54:23] there tens of thousands of the gazans
[54:26] they would get them work permits to come
[54:29] from Gaza over into Israel and to work
[54:33] and then go back of course you'll never
[54:36] hear that on the news media because I
[54:37] don't want you to know that about Israel
[54:40] but yet it is these rulers and these
[54:44] great guys that live in Cutter and live
[54:46] this ridiculous lifestyle and they're
[54:50] the ones that call a lot of these shots
[54:52] about this and that and what are they
[54:55] professional terrorist so they don't
[54:57] really have to do a lot of stuff all
[55:00] they got to do is threaten to do it our
[55:03] FBI the top of our FBI just week before
[55:06] last said that they have many many
[55:09] hundreds of terrorist on the watch list
[55:13] which have slipped in our Southern
[55:15] border and they're concerned about what
[55:18] they're going to do well we live with a
[55:21] a combatting the greatest terrorist
[55:23] that's ever been ever day of our life
[55:26] and that is the Devil
[55:28] Himself but you understand that a lot of
[55:31] terrorists it's not just so much what
[55:33] they do but it's what they threaten they
[55:36] will do now yesterday they was going to
[55:39] release the second batch of captives
[55:42] that they've been been holding there for
[55:44] so long and then Hamas said that Israel
[55:47] was not doing this and Israel was not
[55:49] doing that and psychologically they were
[55:53] trying to put more Terror on the minds
[55:57] of Israel and also on the minds of those
[56:01] family members so they said well we're
[56:02] going to delay it now what's that all
[56:04] about it's about instilling Terror now
[56:09] you realize every one of us every day
[56:11] that we live under an onslaught of
[56:14] Terror from hell so it's either a terror
[56:18] or going to be able to pay our bills you
[56:20] know CO's going around again this
[56:22] sickness is going on that's going on
[56:25] this is going on and it may never hit us
[56:28] but he tries to terrorize us just by the
[56:32] thing of fear now you understand that
[56:35] the prophet of God Tau us that the
[56:37] reason that we do fear is because the
[56:41] right Temperance of love has never
[56:44] entered into our hearts now love comes
[56:48] like Faith Like patience like Mercy like
[56:50] many of the Great attributes of God it
[56:53] comes in degrees everybody here sitting
[56:57] here today that loves the Lord has a
[56:59] degree of love for God in your heart but
[57:01] everybody here today is not on the same
[57:04] plane when it comes to your degree of
[57:07] love for the Lord You Have Love sure you
[57:10] love him if I'd say how many love the
[57:12] Lord no doubt almost every hand would go
[57:14] up but yet there's some of you that love
[57:16] him with a different degree of
[57:19] temperance than other people sitting
[57:21] there cuz they love him until he goes to
[57:23] saying now I don't want you to do that
[57:25] and I don't want you to say that no more
[57:27] and I don't want you to go here then
[57:29] people say oh I've got a problem with
[57:31] that Lord now look I I don't want you to
[57:33] do that to me well God would tell that
[57:35] to somebody else and they'd say okay you
[57:37] know if that's what you if that's what
[57:38] you want I have no problem with it I'll
[57:40] lay it aside now how could they do that
[57:43] it's because they have a different
[57:45] Temperance or a different degree of love
[57:48] now whenever you look into it that's
[57:50] exactly the way it is with the devil
[57:53] some people they'll never be never be
[57:55] terrorists some people will never murder
[57:57] anybody they'll never absolutely do what
[58:00] a moss has done and what people have
[58:02] done down Through the Ages never and
[58:04] they just kind of live their life and
[58:05] mind their own business and they'll wind
[58:07] up going to hell just like terrorists
[58:09] well why because they refuse God's way
[58:13] of
[58:13] Salvation so their love for the Devil is
[58:16] not quite the same as people who give
[58:19] their their self to God as someone said
[58:22] in my office some couple of years ago at
[58:25] the old church and this individual had
[58:27] come to talk to me because of different
[58:29] things that's going through in their
[58:31] life and they wanted to open up to me
[58:33] about where they were and things they'
[58:35] been through so this individual as they
[58:37] sat there they said brother Donnie I
[58:39] hope I haven't crossed the line and I
[58:41] said well what make what would make you
[58:43] think that and I said they said well
[58:46] some time ago I just got all distraught
[58:48] and I got so upset and I just I I just
[58:51] got tired of serving God and I told the
[58:54] devil Satan you can have my
[58:59] soul from this day
[59:02] forward I'll do whatever you want me to
[59:07] do and since that time I've lived this
[59:11] way I've done this I've done that and
[59:13] I've tried to get back to God and I've
[59:15] tried this and I've tried that and it
[59:17] don't make no difference how much I seem
[59:19] to try it seems like I can never get
[59:22] over
[59:23] it so so do you think brother Donnie
[59:26] I've crossed the
[59:29] line I said well to me I'm so glad that
[59:33] God has kept that Knowledge from me as
[59:36] an individual to know whether you have
[59:38] or you
[59:39] haven't but I'll ask you this one
[59:42] question do you love the Lord
[59:45] Jesus do you want to go to hell do you
[59:50] want to be lost do you want to perish
[59:56] by this time that individual had broken
[59:58] down and was crying almost
[1:00:01] uncontrollably and said no I do not want
[1:00:05] to go to hell I do not want to be lost I
[1:00:09] love him I said then if I was you I
[1:00:14] would take your own answer and judge the
[1:00:17] destiny of your soul based upon the way
[1:00:21] you have responded if you want to be
[1:00:24] saved
[1:00:25] to me it proves There's Hope for you or
[1:00:29] you would have no desire to even want to
[1:00:32] come back to God but you see what was
[1:00:35] tormenting this individual the king of
[1:00:39] terrorism to try to make this person
[1:00:42] feel like they could never get into I'd
[1:00:44] say there's people sitting here today
[1:00:46] that's feel like in your Christian walk
[1:00:48] with God that you've crossed the
[1:00:49] boundary line and you can never get back
[1:00:51] to God I've talked to many many hundreds
[1:00:54] of them over the years that I've been a
[1:00:56] minister and yet you find out for most
[1:00:59] of them they love the Lord but their
[1:01:01] degree and the intensity of their love
[1:01:04] has never brought them to a spot to
[1:01:07] where they could be a real Overcomer now
[1:01:10] the the phrase here that James writes
[1:01:13] about is not the person that just gets
[1:01:16] saved and the person that comes to God
[1:01:18] and say I don't want to go to hell I
[1:01:21] don't want to be lost that's a degree of
[1:01:23] love yes it is but it's not a degree of
[1:01:25] love that whenever they go to resisting
[1:01:29] Satan that Satan will flee from them you
[1:01:32] see the way to be able to meet Satan and
[1:01:35] all of his tactics is this way and the
[1:01:38] direction that God gives us and that is
[1:01:41] resistance now think of the word that
[1:01:43] James used so the way for us to be able
[1:01:47] to cause the devil to flee it's not
[1:01:50] argument now many of us that's the way
[1:01:53] we fight Satan
[1:01:55] we argue with him and we argue and argue
[1:01:59] and argue that is not scriptural that is
[1:02:03] not the way for the devil to flee from
[1:02:06] you James does not use the word argue he
[1:02:11] uses the word resist the way to cause
[1:02:15] Satan and his demons I'm sure every one
[1:02:18] of us would be absolutely terrified if
[1:02:22] we could catch a glimpse of that demonic
[1:02:25] world that's right here present this
[1:02:27] morning I feel I'm already here them
[1:02:30] Devils have already gathered here if we
[1:02:32] could open our eyes and see and watch
[1:02:36] how they do you say demons come to
[1:02:38] church absolutely it's one of their
[1:02:41] favorite places together because you see
[1:02:44] when Servants of God are casting out
[1:02:46] Devils by the preaching of the word or
[1:02:48] laying hands on the sick and forcing the
[1:02:51] devil to leave them Devils know that
[1:02:53] unbel Believers gather there as well and
[1:02:56] it's one of the best places to be able
[1:02:58] to get yourself a new house if you're a
[1:03:02] devil is in
[1:03:04] church so whenever a preacher cast out
[1:03:06] devils and that devil leaves that person
[1:03:09] getting your mind set this way then
[1:03:11] whenever a man of God forces that devil
[1:03:14] to leave that devil raises up as it was
[1:03:17] over the congregation and goes to
[1:03:19] looking out over the hundreds of people
[1:03:22] that are there not looking somebody such
[1:03:24] at the length of your hair or the length
[1:03:26] of your dress not looking to see whether
[1:03:29] you've shadeed before you come to church
[1:03:31] but that devil is looking for you as an
[1:03:34] individual to see what you're putting
[1:03:36] out of your soul in the fourth dimension
[1:03:40] which is either rays of light or rays of
[1:03:43] darkness and if you are pulsating rays
[1:03:47] of Darkness out of your soul that devil
[1:03:50] in the fourth dimension is looking
[1:03:52] exactly for that and then that will be
[1:03:54] able to give them a channel by which
[1:03:57] them demons can go inside of your body
[1:04:01] I'll tell you when we come to church it
[1:04:02] ain't a place to play is it it's a place
[1:04:05] to be serious with God but you see most
[1:04:09] of the Christendom world that we live in
[1:04:11] today they live a life that is so
[1:04:14] shallow of God's love shallow of God's
[1:04:17] mercy so they lean more toward the grace
[1:04:19] side of God than falling in love with
[1:04:21] God the love when you talk about the
[1:04:23] love of God it's always a one-sided love
[1:04:26] it's how much God loves them and what
[1:04:29] God wants to do for them and they're
[1:04:31] recipients of this great love but they
[1:04:34] don't want to give much back to him so
[1:04:36] they wanted to be typical Ley and
[1:04:38] preaching to where that the preacher
[1:04:40] doesn't tell them what they've got to do
[1:04:42] you need to read your Bible you need to
[1:04:44] pray you need to do good deeds you know
[1:04:46] all that but they want to say well just
[1:04:47] tell me what God wants to give me today
[1:04:50] tell me what God wants to do how much he
[1:04:52] loves me and what new blessing and great
[1:04:54] blessings that I'm going to get do those
[1:04:56] people love God yes I would say an
[1:04:59] element of them do love him but it's a
[1:05:01] very shallow degree of love but the more
[1:05:05] that you go on into his love and those
[1:05:08] depths open up from the very heart of
[1:05:10] God and then you're able as you walk
[1:05:13] into one sphere of love and then he
[1:05:15] opens up a slight view into another
[1:05:18] sphere of that same love which you
[1:05:20] didn't even know was there you thought
[1:05:22] once you got saved you loved him and
[1:05:24] actually what you begin to feel was an
[1:05:26] affection for God which was not an agapo
[1:05:30] love at all but a FAL love but you see
[1:05:32] one of the great differences there's
[1:05:34] many differences between agapo and felo
[1:05:36] love but one of the great differences is
[1:05:39] that felio love comes with selfishness
[1:05:42] so you can love but still you're loving
[1:05:45] selfishly so many people that's the way
[1:05:47] they love God that's the way Peter loved
[1:05:49] the Lord Jesus whenever he said Lord I
[1:05:51] don't care what anybody else does I'll
[1:05:54] stand with you I'll not deny you and
[1:05:56] Jesus said before the crows this
[1:05:58] many times Peter you're going to deny
[1:06:01] that you even know me oh no Lord now
[1:06:03] there ain't no way I love you all my
[1:06:05] heart and he really did but he loved him
[1:06:08] with aial love so it was a selfish love
[1:06:12] so when it come right down to Peter's
[1:06:15] love for Jesus versus Peter's love for
[1:06:18] his own safety then Peter chose his own
[1:06:22] safety is that right now we know this
[1:06:24] man we saw him he was with Jesus oh no
[1:06:27] no no no I I I don't even know that man
[1:06:30] I've never even heard of that man I I
[1:06:31] never met him before I was never around
[1:06:34] him now did he love the Lord he did but
[1:06:37] yet because his human love had this
[1:06:40] element of selfishness in with it when
[1:06:43] it come to self-preservation then Peter
[1:06:46] loved himself more than he led Jesus so
[1:06:48] whenever Jesus of course in John what is
[1:06:51] it John 21 whenever they see him and his
[1:06:54] there he's cooking fish on the side of
[1:06:56] the water and and then Peter is there
[1:06:58] with the Lord and the Lord Jesus ask him
[1:07:00] do you love me said Lord you know I love
[1:07:02] you well Peter answers him from The
[1:07:04] Human Side you know I love you do you
[1:07:07] love me Peter more than Lord you know I
[1:07:09] love you and then the last the third one
[1:07:11] is Do You Love Me Lord you know I Agape
[1:07:14] you now he filio fio and then agle now
[1:07:19] Peter understands Jesus is calling for a
[1:07:22] deeper love than what it ever manifested
[1:07:25] before but actually Peter didn't have
[1:07:28] the ability to be able to love divinely
[1:07:32] without the divine nature being in him
[1:07:34] now Peter was an apostle he had been
[1:07:37] baptized by Jesus Peter had heard many
[1:07:39] of the teachings and The Parables of the
[1:07:41] Lord Jesus but he did not have the
[1:07:44] divine nature yet because the blood cell
[1:07:47] had not been broken on the cross and
[1:07:50] release the divine nature of God himself
[1:07:53] you can cannot receive that without the
[1:07:56] divine nature coming into you and
[1:07:59] somebody said amen so the true way then
[1:08:02] of meeting the devil is by by absolutely
[1:08:06] being anointed by the spirit of God
[1:08:08] through a direct resistance instead of
[1:08:12] an argument now know make any difference
[1:08:14] what you think you know how well you can
[1:08:16] quote the scripture the devil can quote
[1:08:17] it better than any of us can because
[1:08:19] he's had a whole lot more years and
[1:08:21] experience with it so we canot conquer
[1:08:25] Satan whenever he comes against us in
[1:08:27] this way to resist as strong as he is
[1:08:31] now as far as having ability and all the
[1:08:33] power that he has remember is the
[1:08:36] perverted power of God because according
[1:08:38] to the Bible in the Old Testament he was
[1:08:40] the anointed cherub and God said I have
[1:08:42] set thee so so God gave Lucifer an
[1:08:46] anointed position and whenever he fail
[1:08:49] his name changed his nature changed all
[1:08:52] of that but he still still kept that
[1:08:54] position so whenever Daniel is praying
[1:08:57] and Daniel's asking for God to send him
[1:09:00] an answer and an angel comes down and
[1:09:02] wars and wars and wars and Daniel don't
[1:09:05] understand why and then God sends
[1:09:07] another Angel down what was it it was an
[1:09:09] Angelic hierarchy that was still in
[1:09:12] order even though them Angels had fallen
[1:09:15] from their original estate so whenever
[1:09:17] God sent an angel down there was an
[1:09:19] angel of a higher order that was over
[1:09:23] the kingdom where Daniel was kept in
[1:09:25] that time frame and whenever the angel
[1:09:28] of God came down and War then the prince
[1:09:30] of that kingdom was Waring and Waring
[1:09:33] and he could not break through so the
[1:09:35] angel of God was Hil there Waring and
[1:09:37] Waring until Michael which was the great
[1:09:40] Archangel came down and then he broke
[1:09:43] through and the angel of God then come
[1:09:45] to Daniel said your prayer Was Heard 21
[1:09:47] days ago but I was wrestling I was sent
[1:09:51] there to wrestle and of course he broke
[1:09:53] through and brought the angel the angel
[1:09:56] brought the message of Deliverance to
[1:09:58] Daniel now I want you to notice that the
[1:10:00] only way that you and I then will be
[1:10:01] able to conquer especially in this day
[1:10:03] is whenever we continue to resist and
[1:10:07] God is obligated God will never listen
[1:10:11] to me God will never allow one son or
[1:10:16] daughter of God to be overcome or
[1:10:20] conquered by Satan as long is that son
[1:10:24] or daughter of God is resisting the the
[1:10:27] Devil with the right Temperance of love
[1:10:32] it is not possible for God to ever allow
[1:10:37] you listen to me how could God ever
[1:10:41] allow the devil to overcome you if his
[1:10:44] word says he will not be able to if you
[1:10:48] resist him don't you understand what he
[1:10:50] does though by his persistence he breaks
[1:10:53] down our will by his constant temptation
[1:10:56] of this or that or oppression or
[1:10:58] depression whatever it is that he's
[1:11:00] trying to hit you with and he'll hit you
[1:11:02] day after day he's trying to weaken you
[1:11:06] he's trying to weaken you you watch as
[1:11:09] these next releases of the hostages will
[1:11:12] come is't it amazing that in the two
[1:11:14] batches that's been released so far not
[1:11:17] one American not one American now we're
[1:11:20] supposed to be the most powerful nation
[1:11:22] in all the world watch if you watch the
[1:11:25] way terrorists operate you'll get a
[1:11:28] little bit of insight into the kingdom
[1:11:31] of hell you know why because they're
[1:11:33] under the influence of Hell itself now
[1:11:37] these are people that's not like
[1:11:39] ordinary Sinners out here remember these
[1:11:42] people train their little kids they
[1:11:45] train their little kids with these bands
[1:11:48] on their head and part of their motto is
[1:11:51] to kill every Jew that they can find I'm
[1:11:54] talking about when you're teaching yours
[1:11:56] about Jesus they're teaching them the
[1:11:59] value of killing Jews and oh yeah it's
[1:12:02] not just Jews but it's Christians so
[1:12:05] some of you Christians that are out here
[1:12:07] picketing in Chicago and all these
[1:12:09] different streets them same people if
[1:12:12] they get in charge you're next in line
[1:12:15] because they hate you just as much as
[1:12:18] they do the Christians because they hold
[1:12:20] a grudge against us because of what
[1:12:23] happened come on now somebody say Amen
[1:12:26] to the word because of what happened
[1:12:29] under the age whenever the Knights of
[1:12:31] Columbus and the different ones went
[1:12:33] forth to conquer them they identified
[1:12:36] them as our brothers they was not our
[1:12:39] brothers did not pick up swords and
[1:12:41] fight come on say Amen they hate
[1:12:44] Christians and they are out to destroy
[1:12:46] every one of them but typical typical
[1:12:49] terrorism would be to threaten you even
[1:12:52] if it's with things that cannot work
[1:12:55] things that cannot work and not even
[1:12:58] successful Ukraine has been using it in
[1:13:01] their war with Russia they have been
[1:13:04] making cardboard tanks and tanks made
[1:13:08] out of plywood and yet they have an
[1:13:11] assembly line of different places and
[1:13:13] they look like the latest greatest tanks
[1:13:16] the shans from us and then the ones from
[1:13:19] Germany the leopard tank from Germany
[1:13:22] and they make them out of cardboard and
[1:13:24] plywood they paint them identical
[1:13:27] they're exact same shape same height the
[1:13:30] length of the barrel is exactly the same
[1:13:33] and then Russia will send a missile that
[1:13:35] cost
[1:13:36] $300,000 to blow up a
[1:13:39] $200 plywood
[1:13:41] tank so what do they do but the way they
[1:13:44] look at it they're looking through the
[1:13:46] binoculars they're looking through their
[1:13:48] drones and it looks identical that's the
[1:13:51] way the devil wants to do you and I
[1:13:53] he wants to use a threat that ain't a
[1:13:56] bit more than cardboard that's all it is
[1:13:59] he wants to use a threat I'll do this
[1:14:01] and I'll do that it ain't nothing but
[1:14:04] cardboard it don't even have an engine
[1:14:06] it don't have a driver I wish somebody
[1:14:09] would preach with me this morning it
[1:14:10] ain't got no power it ain't got no
[1:14:13] Authority and then we will fight that
[1:14:15] thing and fight that thing and wear us
[1:14:19] out and there are whole days P that
[1:14:21] we've lost when we could have and
[1:14:23] praising God and thanking God for his
[1:14:26] mercy and we lost another day of Victory
[1:14:30] fighting was a paper
[1:14:32] tiger well come on somebody and if we
[1:14:35] would have just realized what in the
[1:14:38] world was going on remember you are
[1:14:40] fighting this type of an enemy and keep
[1:14:44] this in mind states that Satan cannot
[1:14:47] force the human will he cannot force the
[1:14:52] human will we we've got this mindset
[1:14:54] somehow that he is so powerful that he
[1:14:57] can overwhelm us and make us do things
[1:15:01] that are wrong if you get nothing more
[1:15:03] out of the service today leave with this
[1:15:06] one thought he cannot make you do
[1:15:09] anything young people he cannot make you
[1:15:12] get on your phone and look at things
[1:15:14] that you should not look at he can not
[1:15:17] make you go on YouTube and listen to
[1:15:20] music that you should not listen to he
[1:15:23] cannot make you men look at pictures of
[1:15:26] things you should not look at he does
[1:15:29] not have the power to make you do it he
[1:15:33] cannot override your human will but if
[1:15:37] he can make you think he can then he has
[1:15:41] assert his Terror over you and then you
[1:15:44] just cow down and you give into it and
[1:15:47] then in your mind well the devil made me
[1:15:49] do it you're believing a lie straight
[1:15:52] from the pits of
[1:15:54] hell oh my as a people of God we need to
[1:15:58] get it in our mind greater is he that is
[1:16:01] in me than he that is in the world now
[1:16:04] either that's the truth or it's not the
[1:16:06] truth but if we believe it is the truth
[1:16:08] I don't care how many Devils there are
[1:16:11] 150,000 may show up at your front door
[1:16:14] in the morning but you can just say
[1:16:16] right there and say devil you pick the
[1:16:18] wrong person to fight with you pick the
[1:16:21] wrong person not today devil and not
[1:16:24] tomorrow devil cuz I've done heard the
[1:16:26] word you cannot make me do anything what
[1:16:30] if you can't make me do it and I don't
[1:16:32] want to do it then that means I ain't
[1:16:35] going to do it it don't take a rocket
[1:16:37] scientist to figure that
[1:16:42] out notice in 1 Peter chap 5 verse
[1:16:46] 8 now if there's ever a man that could
[1:16:50] say these words with feeling
[1:16:53] it was this man he can say these words
[1:16:57] but the Dare by
[1:16:59] experience be
[1:17:01] sober be
[1:17:03] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:17:06] devil uh uh uh brother
[1:17:08] Peter can you tell me how you know
[1:17:11] this you know how I know it standing out
[1:17:15] in the courtyard warming His Hands by
[1:17:19] the wrong
[1:17:22] fire he wasn't sober he wasn't
[1:17:26] Vigilant he said your adversary the
[1:17:29] devil as a roaring line now he's not a
[1:17:33] line but he's as one so he's a cardboard
[1:17:41] tank I know friends it's hard for us to
[1:17:44] imagine I love the way the prophet takes
[1:17:46] the cover off of him when never he by
[1:17:49] discernment and a person would walk up
[1:17:51] on the platform with a tumor
[1:17:54] then there would be somebody out there
[1:17:55] somebody over there and he would watch
[1:17:58] that streak come from this person to a
[1:18:01] person right back there and he was say
[1:18:03] now there's another person sitting right
[1:18:05] there there's a dark streak going
[1:18:07] between can't you hear him can't you
[1:18:10] hear him keep them from believing so he
[1:18:13] could hear in the fourth dimension the
[1:18:15] language of demons as they were talking
[1:18:19] keep him from believing keep him from
[1:18:23] leaving now we said they're here tonight
[1:18:26] and which way the battle will go will
[1:18:28] depend upon whether you believe unbelief
[1:18:30] is gathering and then he would say fath
[1:18:33] is also Gathering so then demons I've
[1:18:36] often wondered when they get back down
[1:18:38] in hell can you imagine this person here
[1:18:41] that had that cancer devil and then that
[1:18:44] cancer devil went to screaming out to
[1:18:46] another person that had a cancer devil
[1:18:48] and because of that you know if he kept
[1:18:50] his mouth shut he'd been the only one
[1:18:52] cast out out but he told on his buddy
[1:18:55] back there and then both of them got
[1:18:57] cast out you imagine when they got down
[1:18:59] in hell and they got into a big fight
[1:19:01] and a big argument why didn't you keep
[1:19:02] your mouth shut you know why he done it
[1:19:05] because he was a coward he was afraid of
[1:19:09] that angel of God that was standing
[1:19:11] there and a servant of God that had the
[1:19:13] authority to cast him out so as long as
[1:19:17] he could Bluff he's not afraid as long
[1:19:20] as he's got you bluffed but when it
[1:19:23] comes to real courage he doesn't have
[1:19:26] it oh my when it comes to real courage
[1:19:30] he doesn't have it he's actually afraid
[1:19:33] of you today if you are filled with the
[1:19:35] Holy Ghost and you know your rights the
[1:19:38] devil is terrified of you but if he can
[1:19:42] Bluff you and convince you you're the
[1:19:46] weakling you're the one that don't have
[1:19:48] it you've made mistakes before You'
[1:19:51] fallen short of the glory of God what
[1:19:53] you trying to do terrorize you and
[1:19:55] convince you you are a weakling and
[1:19:58] he'll wait for your speech to break
[1:20:00] he'll wait for your determination or
[1:20:02] your steadfastness and the promise and
[1:20:05] when he hears it coming out of your lips
[1:20:07] well maybe I am maybe I can't oh no I've
[1:20:09] failed to this before he knows right
[1:20:12] then he's got you not because he had
[1:20:15] greater power not because he had greater
[1:20:18] Authority but because he endured and he
[1:20:22] terrorized you from your
[1:20:25] position notice what Peter says as a
[1:20:28] roaring Lon walketh about seeking whom
[1:20:33] listen what he wants to do to
[1:20:35] you devour
[1:20:40] you he does not want to bite
[1:20:45] you he wants to devour
[1:20:51] you several years ago Carol and I was in
[1:20:55] Kenya we got to go to a game Park that
[1:20:58] was real close there sister Hope's been
[1:21:00] there many
[1:21:01] times to
[1:21:03] Nairobi and
[1:21:05] there you could see the city actually
[1:21:08] from where we were but yet they were
[1:21:10] wild
[1:21:11] animals zebra and paa all kinds of
[1:21:14] different
[1:21:15] animals but a few weeks before we went
[1:21:18] through there there had been some
[1:21:21] tourist and whenever we got around to
[1:21:24] where the Lions was there was a big male
[1:21:28] lion and several of the females of
[1:21:31] course and these tourists thought these
[1:21:36] lions were
[1:21:38] tame although they had signs do not
[1:21:42] leave your vehicle do not get out of
[1:21:45] your
[1:21:47] vehicle but no doubt they had been too
[1:21:49] and this and that so they was in a
[1:21:53] similar Place actually where this event
[1:21:55] happened whenever we come upon it cuz
[1:21:58] someone told us where it
[1:22:00] was so as they pulled up their vehicle
[1:22:02] and they saw the Lions laying there and
[1:22:05] severed in the pride and they were just
[1:22:07] laying there chilling out as would say
[1:22:10] you know they sleep some of them 20
[1:22:12] hours a day so they're quite
[1:22:14] lazy so the tourists got out of their
[1:22:18] vehicle and they wanted to get a picture
[1:22:21] of them with the lies so say right here
[1:22:24] the lions are right here so they come
[1:22:26] closer closer closer so they're waving
[1:22:29] they're smiling they're doing all these
[1:22:34] things and the
[1:22:36] Lions raise up kill every one of them
[1:22:40] Maul them tear their bodies to
[1:22:43] Pieces someone else comes soon a ve
[1:22:46] vehicle and finds what's
[1:22:49] happened now they they were
[1:22:53] convinced that these lines were
[1:22:57] okay that's the way sin will try to do
[1:23:01] you well I I'm good I I've got this
[1:23:03] under control I'm good I I've got it but
[1:23:06] you we don't want to just be professed
[1:23:09] Christians we want to be
[1:23:11] Overcomers do we not we want to be
[1:23:15] Overcomers we want to be
[1:23:18] resistors
[1:23:20] resistors we want to be the army of the
[1:23:24] Divine resistance of God we resist lying
[1:23:30] we resist Pride we resist arrogance we
[1:23:34] resist lust we resist adultery we resist
[1:23:39] denominational spirits come on somebody
[1:23:42] we resist anything and everything that
[1:23:46] is contrary to the nature of our husband
[1:23:49] well do I resist it once and then I'm
[1:23:52] pray forever you all know the answer to
[1:23:54] that you know yourself that God May
[1:23:56] deliver you of something and 6 months
[1:23:59] later a year later five years later that
[1:24:02] same thing will come back and try to
[1:24:04] bother you again you see why would he do
[1:24:07] that because he knows if you don't keep
[1:24:10] your resistance up he will be able to
[1:24:13] overcome you again as he did the first
[1:24:17] time so when will I get relief when you
[1:24:19] get your body changed it won't happen
[1:24:22] till now want you notice Peter goes on
[1:24:25] to say and he uses the same word that
[1:24:27] James used Peter used the word resist
[1:24:30] whom
[1:24:32] resist steadfast in the faith resist
[1:24:36] steadfast look at the word steadfast
[1:24:39] here's a good word here for you brothers
[1:24:41] that like stereo here's you a
[1:24:44] stereos
[1:24:46] stereos strong firm
[1:24:50] immovable strong firm so this is how we
[1:24:55] resist in the faith steadfastness so
[1:24:58] when you made the Lord Jesus the Lord of
[1:25:01] your life and he filled you with the
[1:25:03] Holy Ghost Colossians says that he
[1:25:07] delivered you from a power of Darkness
[1:25:12] now the prophet tells us and whenever he
[1:25:14] was a young boy that he would have given
[1:25:16] his heart to God when he was a young man
[1:25:19] but there was a spirit that hung over
[1:25:22] him
[1:25:23] no doubt many of you could Testify the
[1:25:25] same there was something that like held
[1:25:28] over you sometimes it can be a a spirit
[1:25:31] that dominates a family it can be a
[1:25:33] spirit that dominates a church it can be
[1:25:36] a spirit that dominates you as an
[1:25:38] individual and you know you should do
[1:25:41] how many do I talk to how many I talked
[1:25:44] the other day to someone that was
[1:25:45] backing and they said I know where I
[1:25:47] need to be I know what I need to be
[1:25:49] doing I know I know I know I know and
[1:25:52] people people know and it's yet it's
[1:25:54] like they don't have the power or the
[1:25:57] will to carry out what they know they
[1:26:01] should do notice this in Colossians 1:3
[1:26:06] who has
[1:26:08] delivered us from the power of
[1:26:13] Darkness delivered to draw to on
[1:26:18] self to
[1:26:20] rescue as I saw on
[1:26:23] YouTube of those first group of
[1:26:26] hostages that was released and I saw
[1:26:29] them as they were coming from Hamas and
[1:26:32] going into the Red Cross and whoever it
[1:26:34] was that was delivering and they were
[1:26:36] going through and waving and you can see
[1:26:39] the looks on their faces and the little
[1:26:42] 9-year-old boy his pictures been all
[1:26:44] over the Internet he had his ninth ninth
[1:26:47] birthday while he was under captivity
[1:26:50] under
[1:26:51] Hamas the little boy didn't know his
[1:26:54] mama got killed on October the 7th you
[1:26:59] understand many of these hostages that
[1:27:01] are being released they don't even know
[1:27:03] what's going on they don't know that
[1:27:05] there's a war in Gaza they don't know
[1:27:09] what happened on October the 7th they
[1:27:11] don't know because they've been kept
[1:27:14] they br real dark sunglasses because
[1:27:16] they've been in a world of darkness in
[1:27:20] Gaza Metro the
[1:27:22] tunnels so they bring them special
[1:27:25] glasses to be able to to wear because
[1:27:27] the light is so bright so they're being
[1:27:30] brought from a world of
[1:27:33] Darkness back to a world of light so
[1:27:36] they rust him here to the hospital and
[1:27:38] there and they evaluate him physically
[1:27:41] and then they evaluate them
[1:27:42] psychologically and they say for some of
[1:27:44] them it will take
[1:27:47] years years of therapy years of
[1:27:51] psychoanalysis years of all types of
[1:27:53] treatment brother Daryl for them to ever
[1:27:56] be brought back to where they can get
[1:27:58] back in society of normal
[1:28:01] people and as I heard these things I
[1:28:04] thought yeah that's the way it was with
[1:28:07] us we were held in the devil's tunnels
[1:28:10] of sin we were in a world of Darkness we
[1:28:14] didn't know what was right we didn't
[1:28:16] know what was wrong we didn't know if
[1:28:19] this was up or this was up we didn't
[1:28:21] know how nothing but the Lamb of God
[1:28:25] paid the price that we might be set free
[1:28:28] and by the angels of God they came and
[1:28:32] delivered us oh my I saw that little
[1:28:34] nine-year-old boy on YouTube as he meets
[1:28:37] his daddy in the hospital no doubt
[1:28:39] wondering where's Mama but he he meets
[1:28:41] his father in the hospital and he takes
[1:28:44] off running to meet his daddy and his
[1:28:46] daddy reaches down and Scoops him up
[1:28:49] into his arms and I thought praise me to
[1:28:52] God that was me one day I got loose out
[1:28:55] of them tunnels of the devil's darkness
[1:28:58] and my father met me Hallelujah he met
[1:29:02] me and scooped me up into his arms
[1:29:05] Hallelujah to God I'll tell you one
[1:29:07] thing I never want to go back to the
[1:29:10] devil's Darkness again do you I never
[1:29:13] want to go back to that place of
[1:29:20] SAT but I have to to
[1:29:23] say my
[1:29:25] mind also went
[1:29:28] back and I begin to think about the
[1:29:32] saints of God when they leave this
[1:29:36] world and they step across on the other
[1:29:39] side and they're met at the river
[1:29:41] brother John by the Saints in their
[1:29:44] theophany
[1:29:47] bodies
[1:29:49] Hallelujah and you imagine as they're
[1:29:51] grabbed I've seen old women and you know
[1:29:53] they had one woman 88 years old and
[1:29:55] another one 82 and you know just people
[1:29:58] of all different types of of age and
[1:30:00] that sort of thing and yet here they
[1:30:02] come and one thing I've noticed over and
[1:30:04] over and over again in the different
[1:30:06] hostages that are released is that
[1:30:08] people are welcoming them and hugging
[1:30:11] them and pading them and taking their
[1:30:14] face and I thought yeah that must be
[1:30:17] what it's like when to say that God
[1:30:19] moves beyond the curtain of time and the
[1:30:21] move on the other side they step across
[1:30:24] the river and then saints of God go to
[1:30:26] meeting them down there the river and
[1:30:28] they go to patting them on the back and
[1:30:30] say he's home she's home he's home she's
[1:30:33] home you imagine as they rejoice and
[1:30:36] rejoice because what you say are they
[1:30:39] hostages yes every one of us sting here
[1:30:41] today are a hostage to time we are a
[1:30:45] hostage to this element of this world we
[1:30:48] are a hostage to old age come on
[1:30:50] somebody we are a a hostage to germs we
[1:30:53] are a hostage to the things that's
[1:30:55] around us but I'm telling you there's a
[1:30:58] world Amen there is a world that is
[1:31:01] beyond this one and we're not talking
[1:31:04] about the Lord Jesus negotiating with
[1:31:07] the Devil he's just waiting for the last
[1:31:09] one to come in and their name to be
[1:31:12] called on that book of life then every
[1:31:14] one of his children will going to leave
[1:31:17] in this world one day and we will be met
[1:31:20] by our loved on we will rejoice we will
[1:31:24] praise God we will shout in the presence
[1:31:28] of God for
[1:31:29] eternity hostages that have been set
[1:31:33] free hostages that have been
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:44] released and of course you know who I
[1:31:47] was thinking
[1:31:50] about I was thinking about my little
[1:32:01] Erica and when she was
[1:32:04] released a
[1:32:06] hostage that 44 year old
[1:32:12] body we was able to go down to South
[1:32:14] Carolina before she
[1:32:16] passed about two weeks not hardly two
[1:32:19] weeks about two weeks before her liver
[1:32:22] was so swollen she's look like she's
[1:32:24] about four months
[1:32:26] pregnant in so much
[1:32:29] pain so much
[1:32:37] suffering but she got set
[1:32:42] free one of the ministers posted it this
[1:32:45] week and it was a little
[1:32:48] video it was a prophet singing beyond
[1:32:52] the curtain of
[1:32:53] time somebody had taken that song and
[1:32:56] put it on there and then had made some
[1:33:00] sort of a video and it was showing the
[1:33:03] images and the faces of people and they
[1:33:05] were kind of blurry they did it that way
[1:33:08] intentionally you could see these men as
[1:33:11] they were running and then they had
[1:33:12] other people coming up dressed in white
[1:33:15] and they were meeting them and they were
[1:33:19] hugging I was down in the at the house
[1:33:22] and whenever I looked at that I
[1:33:25] just I just had a
[1:33:33] breakdown I said oh
[1:33:37] God we're not worried about where she
[1:33:43] is we just miss her so
[1:33:48] much and I've been waiting for him
[1:33:52] week after
[1:33:54] week to say something to
[1:33:57] me about
[1:34:01] her I've been
[1:34:05] right when I got my composure a little
[1:34:09] bit he said these
[1:34:12] words if
[1:34:14] you could only see
[1:34:17] her
[1:34:20] now
[1:34:22] wow thank you Lord praise God thank you
[1:34:26] Lord praise
[1:34:32] God who hath delivered
[1:34:36] us from the power of

[1:35:16] the authority of darkness when you were
[1:35:18] a sinner Satan controlled you if he said
[1:35:22] drink you drank if he said smoke you
[1:35:25] smoked but I'm afraid friend sometimes

[1:35:34] cardboard M16 there's no powerder in it
[1:35:38] it has no power over you as a child of
[1:35:41] God but he gets it up and he shakes it

[1:37:54] battle well you're weak you're afraid
[1:37:56] you're this you're this well of course
[1:37:58] that's what he wants to do and he can

[1:38:03] Humanity but what he sees is your
[1:38:05] clothes he standing there scared to
[1:38:08] death he's shaking like a leaf but if
[1:38:11] you go to speaking out of your Humanity
[1:38:13] he knows he ain't got nothing to fear
[1:38:15] with the clothes you've got on but if
[1:38:17] you stand there and say Satan in the
[1:38:20] name of Jesus you are a liar you are
[1:38:24] defeated you have overcome me for your
[1:38:27] lifetime I am sick of it I am sick of

[1:39:13] coward amen the Bible tells us about the
[1:39:17] devil they shall
[1:39:19] narrowly n
[1:39:21] nly look upon thee and consider thee
[1:39:25] saying is this the
[1:39:28] man not the God not the omnipotent one
[1:39:32] is this the man that made the Nations to
[1:39:35] tremble who you reckon is going to do
[1:39:37] that look at verse the verse before it
[1:39:39] Kings I will lay thee before Kings I

[1:40:14] be good and then Wednesday has to kind
[1:40:16] of be off and then maybe the next Sunday
[1:40:18] might be or might not be I believe we
[1:40:20] can have a tremendous time every time we
[1:40:22] come to the house of God it may not be
[1:40:25] exactly the same but if he shows up
[1:40:28] it'll still be

[1:44:55] I don't even know what to do with
[1:44:58] you he was so true to God by faith faith
[1:45:02] will work
[1:45:04] miracles if you'll stay true to
[1:45:06] God by faith but you see fear
[1:45:12] within exaggerates the causes of fear
[1:45:19] without fear
[1:45:21] within can exaggerate The Source or the
[1:45:26] cause of the fear
[1:45:31] without brother Donnie
[1:45:34] inflation it's it's awful I know and car
[1:45:37] went through Wy the other day and got a
[1:45:38] biscuit and a drink that's
[1:45:43] $19 I mean that biscuit wasn't that big
[1:45:46] if you're thinking I got a giant you
[1:45:48] know 55 gallon drum drink no
[1:45:52] this is going up and that's going up and
[1:45:53] this is awful and that's going awful our
[1:45:55] FBI warning us of terrorism they they
[1:45:58] all everywhere we look everywhere we
[1:45:59] look but let's look up this way there
[1:46:02] ain't no inflation up there there ain't
[1:46:04] no terrorists up there and you know what
[1:46:06] if we're not careful we'll surround
[1:46:08] ourselves with fear if you need to take
[1:46:11] all them news apps off of your phone and
[1:46:14] have the message app on there and have a
[1:46:16] Bible app on there and some good gospel
[1:46:19] singing that'll lift you voice because
[1:46:22] let's face the facts there's not a lot
[1:46:24] of good news except for the
[1:46:28] [Applause]
[1:46:30] gospel
[1:46:36] Hallelujah let me close with this 2
[1:46:39] Timothy chap 1: 7 for
[1:46:42] God hath not given us the spirit of
[1:46:46] fear but of
[1:46:48] power and of love
[1:46:52] and of a sound
[1:46:54] mind we'll pick it up again next time
[1:46:57] but let's read this in first John
[1:47:00] 4:17 herein is our love made
[1:47:07] perfect how many wants your love to be
[1:47:09] made perfect now remember it's thus
[1:47:14] saith the Lord after the prophet was
[1:47:17] carried beyond the curtain of time thus
[1:47:19] saith the Lord you'll have to have
[1:47:22] perfect love to get
[1:47:28] there so what is perfect love is it a
[1:47:31] different
[1:47:32] attribute than the Holy Ghost is it
[1:47:34] something that's different after we're
[1:47:36] born again is it something that we get
[1:47:39] after we get born again and you know we
[1:47:42] get the spirit of God in our life and
[1:47:44] then we seek for this something that's
[1:47:46] outside of the Holy
[1:47:49] Ghost no no it's
[1:47:52] not I want you to notice the way that
[1:47:55] John looks at this now remember this is
[1:47:56] the disciple of love herein is our love
[1:48:02] made perfect so it's not like that
[1:48:05] they're pointing to something outside of
[1:48:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:48:09] you'll grow and grow and grow and after
[1:48:11] you've been in for so many years then
[1:48:13] you get this thing called perfect
[1:48:15] love that's actually not what it
[1:48:18] is it's a deep ER degree of what you
[1:48:22] already have this
[1:48:23] morning if you have the Holy
[1:48:28] Ghost notice the way John says it not
[1:48:32] separate from the Holy Ghost herein is
[1:48:35] our love made
[1:48:39] Tio perfect look at what the word
[1:48:42] perfect
[1:48:43] means
[1:48:45] finish fulfill to make perfect or
[1:48:49] complete
[1:48:51] to carry through completely so you can't
[1:48:55] carry something through if you don't
[1:48:57] have something to begin with right so
[1:49:00] what is perfect love it's the completion
[1:49:03] of that which God deposited in you when
[1:49:06] the divine nature came in you when you
[1:49:09] were pulled out of the tunnels of
[1:49:12] Darkness it grows and it grows and it
[1:49:16] becomes more mature and more mature
[1:49:19] until it finally reaches the crescendo
[1:49:22] of heights remember when he was carried
[1:49:23] beyond the curtain of time and they told
[1:49:26] him this is what you preached was the
[1:49:29] Holy
[1:49:33] Ghost perfect love which is mature
[1:49:38] love this is what you preached was the
[1:49:41] Holy
[1:49:42] Ghost go ahead look at the rest of this
[1:49:44] meaning here to accomplish bring to an
[1:49:47] end add what is yet wanting in order to
[1:49:52] render a thing full now this is from the
[1:49:56] strong lexicon if you'd like to click on
[1:49:57] it when you're doing your studying bring
[1:49:59] to a close or
[1:50:03] fulfillment so this is when our love is
[1:50:07] made perfect in other words it moves
[1:50:10] from the phase of felo which has all
[1:50:13] these conditions I love you brother Dave
[1:50:15] if you love me now you watch how we
[1:50:18] humans are
[1:50:20] you watch that we are and if we find out
[1:50:23] say this brother right here oh brother
[1:50:25] Donnie I heard that brother man he loves
[1:50:27] you so much and he just said such great
[1:50:29] things about you and I said that's a
[1:50:31] good brother right
[1:50:35] there but let's just say he said I heard
[1:50:38] old brother Gary run brother Donnie down
[1:50:40] I'll tell you brother Gary said this and
[1:50:42] that and the other he can take this he
[1:50:43] knows I'm just picking that hey Bo I
[1:50:45] tell you he said this and what we can do
[1:50:47] I've always qu always had questions
[1:50:49] about Brother Gary something wrong wrong
[1:50:50] with him so what are we basing it on
[1:50:52] their treatment to
[1:50:54] us not the walk for God not the not the
[1:50:58] other things in their life but what
[1:51:00] somebody said which they might not have
[1:51:02] said in the first place but what
[1:51:03] somebody said they felt about us so we
[1:51:06] judge all people by us so if they think
[1:51:08] we're a great singer we're a great
[1:51:10] musician we're a great preacher the well
[1:51:12] they've got to be great if they think
[1:51:13] I'm great because I'm great that's
[1:51:14] expressed you know so I mean they can
[1:51:16] acknowledge greatness because they just
[1:51:18] see it
[1:51:21] that's not perfect
[1:51:23] love perfect love can love that
[1:51:26] individual which has become your enemy
[1:51:29] many times through no fault of your
[1:51:33] own and actually the prophet said you
[1:51:36] can love them which would kill
[1:51:40] you if they had the opportunity and they
[1:51:43] could get away with it they would kill
[1:51:46] you but complete love mature Love Will
[1:51:49] Set say Lord Jesus please help that
[1:51:52] person please Lord they didn't mean that
[1:51:55] please Lord I'll tell you friends you
[1:51:58] ain't when you arrive there you ain't
[1:52:00] but one step away from the sixth
[1:52:04] Dimension now we're talking about bride
[1:52:07] material I don't care how you jump how
[1:52:10] much you scream and
[1:52:12] shout show me how you love amen that's
[1:52:16] good oh my herein is our love made
[1:52:20] perfect that we may have boldness in
[1:52:24] that day now you see the people who come
[1:52:26] up to the white Throne judgment and they
[1:52:28] walk Before the Throne of God their
[1:52:30] degree of love will be reflected by the
[1:52:33] body they still have and by the look on
[1:52:36] their
[1:52:38] face because when they walk before him
[1:52:41] they will be fearful their own body
[1:52:45] testifies I'm not standing here in a
[1:52:47] theophany they never remember they go
[1:52:48] down through the grave in the
[1:52:49] tribulation period and they will stand
[1:52:51] and be judged and the prophet said those
[1:52:53] Sinners will be judged in the same body
[1:52:54] you imagine 70y old man he'll be raised
[1:52:57] and judged in a 70 year old body his own
[1:52:59] body will be a witness against him
[1:53:02] they'll walk Before the Throne of God
[1:53:04] and their life will reflect just like
[1:53:07] this gigantic screen you lied you stole
[1:53:11] you looked at this woman and that woman
[1:53:13] and you thought this and that and the
[1:53:15] other and there it'll be for everybody
[1:53:17] to
[1:53:18] see why the degree of love was so
[1:53:24] shallow they didn't want to go to hell
[1:53:26] they didn't they didn't want to be
[1:53:27] lost now it's reflecting by the record
[1:53:31] that's before
[1:53:32] everybody but for those who move into
[1:53:35] perfect love the fear of the Judgment
[1:53:39] has all
[1:53:40] passed they don't even worry about
[1:53:44] standing Before the Throne of
[1:53:48] God I was already convinced when my
[1:53:51] daughter had went
[1:53:53] anyway but whenever he told me that the
[1:53:55] other day it just reassured me
[1:53:58] again whenever he said if you could only
[1:54:01] see her
[1:54:03] now CU that lets me know she's just
[1:54:06] right under the altar where he is and he
[1:54:08] knows she's in good shape that's
[1:54:11] right oh don't you want him to say it
[1:54:14] about
[1:54:17] you so if I have to preach your funeral
[1:54:19] or you have to preach M brother the
[1:54:21] Daryl that the Lord Jesus can ech go
[1:54:24] back and say if you could only see Johny
[1:54:28] now if you could only see John
[1:54:33] now let's bow our heads
[1:54:41] together love like every other Grace has
[1:54:45] intensities intensities of degree and
[1:54:49] depth
[1:54:51] how many of us could be honest today
[1:54:53] before ourselves and before God and say
[1:54:56] Lord I Witness by raising my hands I
[1:54:59] need a deeper degree of love I raise
[1:55:03] mine Lord
[1:55:05] Jesus I love you and I've loved you
[1:55:07] since a little
[1:55:08] boy but father I want my love to be of a
[1:55:12] greater
[1:55:14] intensity Lord Jesus said I won't just
[1:55:17] love those that love me but I will love
[1:55:20] and be able to without resentment or
[1:55:21] attitude love and pray for those who
[1:55:25] cause me so much
[1:55:28] heartache and even pray for those that
[1:55:30] would kill me if they
[1:55:32] could and I know of some in the message
[1:55:34] that would have already done it if they
[1:55:35] could have got away with it
[1:55:38] legally but Lord God we desire to be
[1:55:42] able to walk into that
[1:55:44] sphere to where perfect
[1:55:47] love can be so manifested it out of our
[1:55:52] Lives I've often wondered myself how the
[1:55:55] prophet must have felt when he was there
[1:55:57] and he heard that this is what you
[1:56:00] preached was the Holy
[1:56:04] Ghost and he said there was no tomorrow
[1:56:07] they weren't tired they weren't tired of
[1:56:10] being there they wasn't going
[1:56:12] anywhere they had just
[1:56:16] arrived they had
[1:56:18] arrived
[1:56:20] praise
[1:56:22] God praise God all ready by now
[1:56:28] Lord Erica has done seen no
[1:56:32] doubt the saints that have passed
[1:56:35] through the years here at our
[1:56:37] church and Carol was talking about it
[1:56:39] against yesterday about sister Brown
[1:56:42] brother Joel's
[1:56:45] Mama
[1:56:47] Hallelujah different ones of the church
[1:56:50] that has already
[1:56:53] passed praise the
[1:56:56] lord we could hear back from them
[1:57:00] today from that Dimension that'd
[1:57:04] say maybe to the preachers brother
[1:57:07] Daryl brother John brother Joel these
[1:57:10] other
[1:57:11] preachers This Is What You Preach was
[1:57:13] the Holy
[1:57:15] Ghost keep preaching it
[1:57:18] Brothers keep preaching
[1:57:21] it it's worth every sleepless night
[1:57:25] every hardship every
[1:57:27] trial praise the
[1:57:30] lord we could hear their voices Echo
[1:57:33] from Beyond the curtain of time friends
[1:57:35] wonder what they'd say to you as
[1:57:37] individuals keep pressing the
[1:57:40] battle keep pressing the
[1:57:43] battle it's worth every
[1:57:46] hardship worth every difficulty keep
[1:57:50] resisting the devil you are more than
[1:57:55] conquerors praise the
[1:57:58] Lord
[1:58:01] father I pray you would help each of us
[1:58:03] here
[1:58:06] today it's evident Lord that we are
[1:58:08] still in the struggle of
[1:58:12] time I was delivered years ago from the
[1:58:15] darkness of the tunnels of an
[1:58:17] unconverted nature
[1:58:20] I came out of the tunnel of being
[1:58:24] unregenerated and walked into a higher
[1:58:28] sphere of
[1:58:30] life I come off of that
[1:58:33] dump and I started feasting on things of
[1:58:37] the word of God that I never knew
[1:58:40] existed and it was a great thing what
[1:58:42] you did for me
[1:58:44] then but Lord sometime after that you
[1:58:47] reveal your name to me
[1:58:49] then you begin to reveal more and more
[1:58:53] and with each revelation of we will
[1:58:54] allow it will bring a deeper intensity
[1:58:57] of
[1:58:58] love so I'm always afraid of people
[1:59:01] whose great so-called Revelations makes
[1:59:04] them cut everybody else
[1:59:06] off and they seem to have hate for
[1:59:09] people that don't understand them
[1:59:11] instead of
[1:59:12] love I don't understand that kind of
[1:59:15] Revelation because when the prophet of
[1:59:17] God went beyond the curtain of time
[1:59:20] and found out what the Holy Ghost and
[1:59:21] what perfect love is really all
[1:59:23] about as I read it this morning he said
[1:59:26] friends I will never be the same brother
[1:59:31] brandham
[1:59:33] again it changed
[1:59:35] him praise God it changed
[1:59:41] him oh Jesus I pray you'd touch each man
[1:59:44] woman boy and girl in this place today
[1:59:47] those that's streaming those that
[1:59:49] archived this service as they listen to
[1:59:51] it may the spirit of God grab a hold to
[1:59:54] their heart oh Lord many of them love
[1:59:57] you but it's the
[1:59:59] intensity it's the degree that needs to
[2:00:02] be magnified they need to go deeper and
[2:00:06] deeper and they'll find the more they
[2:00:08] love you the more they love your word
[2:00:11] and the more they love your word the
[2:00:12] more they love your people they want to
[2:00:13] be around the more they love going to
[2:00:15] church and it's just it's just a great
[2:00:17] big vacuum that pulls them in to the
[2:00:20] very soul of
[2:00:22] God help us today Lord
[2:00:26] Jesus we love you
[2:00:29] Lord would you lay your hand on that
[2:00:31] person standing by you and let's offer a
[2:00:33] word of prayer Right
[2:00:35] Now Praise the
[2:00:38] Lord praise the
[2:00:41] Lord Heavenly Father believer to
[2:00:45] believer we ask you now in the name of
[2:00:48] Jesus
[2:00:50] would you help us
[2:00:52] Lord to love one another more to love
[2:00:57] the body
[2:00:58] more Lord I believe that it goes hand in
[2:01:01] hand the more we love
[2:01:04] you the more we love our brothers and
[2:01:07] sisters John goes on to tell us that if
[2:01:10] a man say that he's a believer that he's
[2:01:12] walking in the light and hates his
[2:01:14] brother John says it shows that he's not
[2:01:17] passed from Death unto life yet the
[2:01:19] man's still stricken in the tunnel of
[2:01:21] Darkness but Lord the more we love you
[2:01:25] the more we love your body and and the
[2:01:27] more we want to do for them we don't
[2:01:29] want to bring anything evil on them Lord
[2:01:33] if there's something about us that wants
[2:01:35] to hinder the move of God that we don't
[2:01:36] have perfect love
[2:01:38] yet Lord Jesus help us as a body as an
[2:01:42] assembly father to fall in love with you
[2:01:45] in a greater way than ever before and by
[2:01:49] doing so we'll fall in love with our
[2:01:52] brothers and sisters and we will love
[2:01:55] those that hate us those that would
[2:01:57] ridicule us and run us down lord then
[2:02:01] we'll find that theal love is becoming
[2:02:04] less and less the temperance of it is
[2:02:07] smaller and smaller and the gape Love is
[2:02:10] Growing growing growing and as it grows
[2:02:13] it's becoming more
[2:02:15] mature I pray you'd help us this morning
[2:02:18] father's we look at it maybe some have
[2:02:20] been pondering it for a while wondering
[2:02:22] about perfect love and thinking about
[2:02:24] perfect love what it will be help us to
[2:02:26] see what it is it's the holy ghost that
[2:02:29] we have growing in a deeper degree than
[2:02:33] we've ever had
[2:02:34] before until the selfishness me and I
[2:02:38] and what's mine it all subsides Lord God
[2:02:43] and it's loving the way God loves caring
[2:02:46] the way God cares Hallelujah
[2:02:50] believing the way God
[2:02:52] believes oh
[2:02:55] Jesus we love you today
[2:02:59] Father Can we just worship Him
[2:03:02] Saints sing something for us har let's
[2:03:05] let's just open our hearts now please
[2:03:08] friends as we get ready to leave here
[2:03:10] just shortly think about what you've
[2:03:12] heard don't go to looking for perfect
[2:03:15] love as being some something out here
[2:03:18] that you don't
[2:03:20] have but as what you already have
[2:03:23] growing and growing and abounding and
[2:03:26] growing until it reaches its state of
[2:03:30] maturity imagine it as a little child
[2:03:34] brother Andrew Glover he sent me a
[2:03:36] picture of himself and his little boy
[2:03:38] today and just him with his little baby
[2:03:41] and my great nephew each little thing
[2:03:44] and he's getting where he's trying to
[2:03:45] call Crawl Jude and Wis together last
[2:03:50] week they they didn't hardly have it
[2:03:52] together he was kind of up on his hands
[2:03:54] and up on his knees and he was trying to
[2:03:57] call you know but he he he one leg he
[2:03:59] could do it but the other one was kind
[2:04:00] of dragging back here behind him I
[2:04:03] thought that's the way we are as
[2:04:05] children of God but we're trying to do
[2:04:07] it we try to stabilize oursel but it's
[2:04:09] like we're growing we before long we be
[2:04:12] up walking crawling
[2:04:14] running what would he be doing growing
[2:04:17] maturing yeah that's way God wants us to
[2:04:19] be we may get up and fall down and drag
[2:04:22] a leg and fall and bust our nose but
[2:04:24] don't you quit you get back up and you
[2:04:27] keep on until that love that you have
[2:04:29] this morning matures into one day you
[2:04:32] will Step Beyond the curtain of time
[2:04:35] yourself and you say will I be ready you
[2:04:38] will be ready before you leave this
[2:04:40] world or you will never get
[2:04:43] ready hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I
[2:04:47] believe with all of my heart children of
[2:04:49] God can be so walking with the Lord
[2:04:52] Jesus that when death comes they don't
[2:04:54] have to scream they don't have to honor
[2:04:56] I've been there when they've done it oh
[2:04:58] yes I've seen the deaths of sinners like
[2:05:00] I have saints it could be awful but I'll
[2:05:04] tell you I've never seen a child of God
[2:05:06] not one of them when deaths go to moving
[2:05:08] up and the breath getting shorter and
[2:05:10] them scared to death and terrified oh
[2:05:12] God oh God oh God why because they've
[2:05:15] walked in that walk with God day by day
[2:05:18] until matured and they could transition
[2:05:21] simply a transition out of this body
[2:05:24] into the

[2:13:07] our shoulder and gave us shots and they
[2:13:10] uh marched us to the mesle we wouldn't
[2:13:11] allowed to speak to nobody and we went
[2:13:13] by the
[2:13:14] Armory and they issued Us weapons with
[2:13:17] bullets and took us out into the field
[2:13:19] and we stayed there we was going to
[2:13:20] deploy from the field and I was thinking
[2:13:23] as brother Donnie was preaching this
[2:13:24] morning that's exactly what's happened
[2:13:27] here today you have come by the Armory
[2:13:30] of God and he has equipped
[2:13:33] you he's given you some real bullets to
[2:13:37] use against this ghost

[2:14:06] girl and I'd been out preaching and I
[2:14:10] got home about 3:00 3:30 in the morning
[2:14:12] and I didn't want to wake anybody up so
[2:14:14] I just sat down in a chair cuz I knew
[2:14:16] it' just be a little bit for the girl
[2:14:18] got up and got ready for
[2:14:19] school so I sat there in that old chair
[2:14:22] of mine was looking out the window and
[2:14:24] watching the sun come up and I was
[2:14:25] praying for the different ones that had
[2:14:27] come up for prayer that God would just
[2:14:28] meet their needs and thinking about the
[2:14:30] weekend and directly I heard a noise
[2:14:33] upstairs and it was the girls and they
[2:14:34] were up and Ally came downstairs into
[2:14:38] the kitchen or kitchen and den kind of
[2:14:40] goes together and she looked towards the
[2:14:42] kitchen she looked back at me look she
[2:14:45] looked she go daddy's home she ran and
[2:14:48] jumped up in my
[2:14:50] lap laid her head up against my

[2:14:59] going for mama she goes mhm I mhm I'll
[2:15:03] ask
