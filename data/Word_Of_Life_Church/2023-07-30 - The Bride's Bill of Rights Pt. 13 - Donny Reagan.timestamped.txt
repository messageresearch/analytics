[23:51] few months ago
[23:56] something brother Tony preaching about
[23:58] Paul last week
[24:00] kind of brought it back to me because
[24:04] I was thinking the man that wrote all
[24:07] things worked together for good in them
[24:08] that loved the Lord and our call
[24:09] according to his purpose I wonder
[24:12] when he was at a whipping post or in a
[24:16] bottom of a prison how many times the
[24:18] devil said
[24:19] I thought all things worked together for
[24:21] good to them that loved him
[24:24] and
[24:25] but I believe if we trust him no matter
[24:27] where we are in the journey
[24:31] if we follow our guide he'll bring us
[24:34] through
[24:36] [Music]
[24:55] thank you I wasn't meant

[28:35] [Applause]
[28:49] Stand Together
[28:51] turn to the book of
[28:54] job
[28:59] Book of Job
[29:01] chapter 23
[29:05] verse 1.
[29:08] that job answered and said
[29:10] even today
[29:12] is my complaint better
[29:16] my stroke is heavier than my groaning
[29:22] all that I knew
[29:24] where I might find him
[29:28] listen to this now
[29:30] that I might come even to his seat
[29:34] I would order
[29:36] my cause
[29:38] before him
[29:40] and fill my mouse
[29:42] with arguments
[29:45] wow this is a guy that's not in a good
[29:48] mood
[29:51] is it
[29:52] now he's not talking about me coming to
[29:55] my house or your house or your house or
[29:58] your house
[29:59] he's wanting to go to God's house
[30:02] is wanting to find God
[30:04] and he's wanting to tell God a thing or
[30:06] two
[30:08] he's had some real issues and some real
[30:10] problems
[30:12] and he just don't understand what's
[30:15] going on
[30:17] so it says verse three all that I knew
[30:19] where I might find him
[30:21] that I might come even to his seat
[30:24] I would order my cause before him
[30:27] and fill my mouth with arguments or
[30:30] complaints
[30:32] listen he says I would know the words
[30:36] which he would answer me and understood
[30:41] what he would say
[30:43] unto me
[30:45] will he plead against me with his great
[30:47] power no
[30:50] he would put strength
[30:52] in me
[30:55] I mean a lot to be remembered today as
[30:56] we pray
[31:00] Heavenly Father we thank you today
[31:03] For Your Precious word we thank you for
[31:06] the strength that we gain from it Lord
[31:09] we thank you that there were men like
[31:12] this one job
[31:14] that even when he got in his low place
[31:17] of life
[31:19] he still maintained an element about him
[31:23] that was helping helping him rather not
[31:25] to lose his faith
[31:28] he probably come to spots to where he
[31:31] felt like it wasn't even worth it
[31:33] anymore
[31:34] but we're so thankful Lord that you had
[31:36] a hold of him
[31:38] dear father would you sell the hands of
[31:40] the people there uplifted today when I'm
[31:42] asking you that you'll be mindful of
[31:43] them
[31:44] Lord these prayer calls that I have in
[31:46] my hand father for these brothers you
[31:49] know who they are and you know their
[31:50] needs I'm asking that you'll be mindful
[31:53] of them Lord God
[31:54] should go to their homes and their
[31:56] situations father would you anoint us
[31:59] today that we can be able to receive
[32:02] from you
[32:03] we've come here Lord from different
[32:05] walks of life and from different things
[32:08] that's molded us and shaped us Lord each
[32:11] of us our needs might be a little bit
[32:12] different but we believe that your God
[32:15] and that you can custom fit a sermon to
[32:18] be able to fit every Hungry Heart that's
[32:21] right here today would you grant it Lord
[32:24] in the name of Jesus
[32:26] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[32:29] you may be seated
[32:32] turn with me to job Chapter 19 Verse 14.

[32:40] the bride's rights is the right to be
[32:42] able to rule and reign with him
[32:46] that's all right
[32:48] but it doesn't quite mean we're up to
[32:50] our rights yet
[32:52] rights are like anything else it's given
[32:54] to you
[32:55] a person might be an heir or an heiress
[32:59] from a rich father a rich mother
[33:03] but they're only seven years old
[33:05] so it wouldn't do much different if
[33:07] there was the son or daughter of a poor
[33:10] man
[33:11] because they're not going to get what's
[33:13] been placed on the will to them
[33:16] until they're old enough to be able to
[33:18] know how to use it
[33:20] and our rights are many they are great
[33:23] they are tremendous they are wonderful
[33:26] but alas some of them will not be
[33:28] attained until we as the people of God
[33:31] have been brought into a place to where
[33:34] that we can be able to handle them
[33:36] aren't you glad that God don't give
[33:38] power to just anybody and everybody
[33:41] can you imagine if you had power to
[33:43] speak the spoken word
[33:45] you go out here and you turn right after
[33:48] church is over one of these gray-haired
[33:50] women that lives on this highway over
[33:52] here this blue hair sometimes and gray
[33:54] and pink whatever more she gets up to
[33:56] about 35 miles in there and you're
[33:57] starved to death and you're ready to go
[33:59] you have the power of the spoken word I
[34:02] wonder what you all would do with it
[34:04] I can tell you what some of you dude
[34:06] probably the same thing I would you'd
[34:07] push that button and spread it out your
[34:09] car and go up this way and go right over
[34:10] the top of them and go through the
[34:12] drivester and go home
[34:14] but God doesn't give that kind of power
[34:17] to everyone
[34:19] notice job as he's come into this spot
[34:22] in his life job 19 14. my kinsfolk have
[34:27] failed
[34:28] my familiar friends have forgotten me
[34:33] they that dwell in my house and my Maids
[34:38] count me a stranger
[34:41] I'm an alien in their sight
[34:45] now this is a man that was well thought
[34:47] of
[34:48] well looked up to
[34:50] admired
[34:52] a man that whenever he would have went
[34:54] to the marketplace
[34:55] people would have given anything
[34:58] just to be able to spend a few minutes
[35:00] time with him he was that type of a man
[35:04] but now something had happened to him
[35:07] and he didn't understand it the people
[35:09] didn't understand it so they're looking
[35:12] at it and they're trying to figure out
[35:13] what in the world is going on with this
[35:16] man it looks like he's lost favor with
[35:21] god well you and I go through things
[35:23] that can be similar well there's an
[35:25] oppression or a sickness or a situation
[35:29] in your home whatever it is and people
[35:31] begin to wonder what's going on with
[35:33] brother so-and-so Reagan what's going on
[35:36] with sister so-and-so well I'm beginning
[35:38] to wonder about the mhu all my of you
[35:41] noticed in church they've not been
[35:43] shouting like they used to shout they've
[35:45] not been as happy as they used to be
[35:47] happy all the time I'm on their third a
[35:50] little bit backslid if they're getting a
[35:52] little bit colder and different no it
[35:55] could be the word jobber
[35:57] and they might really need a friend
[36:01] you know I know I'll never amount to
[36:03] much too much in life I know that
[36:06] already I'm done too old to try to
[36:08] convince myself that I'll be much of
[36:10] anything
[36:11] but if I can just simply be a friend to
[36:15] someone in need or to be able to speak
[36:18] something to someone that is dealing
[36:21] with so much stuff and life that they
[36:24] have no clue which way they're going to
[36:27] go wouldn't that be awesome to be able
[36:29] to be that type of an individual now I
[36:32] hate to break the news to most of you
[36:33] all but most of y'all are not going to
[36:36] be the president of the United States or
[36:38] his wife or his grandson or grandson
[36:41] most of you aren't going to be Congress
[36:43] people Senate people most of you never
[36:46] be the mayor of Johnson City most of you
[36:48] will never be a CEO you'll never be a
[36:51] great great person of notoriety that the
[36:54] people of the earth will ever notice you
[36:56] but I'll tell you what an awesome thing
[36:59] it would be we may not be any of that
[37:01] but the Lord Jesus gives us the awesome
[37:05] opportunity to be able to help his
[37:09] children as we go through this journey
[37:11] and when we stand before him that day he
[37:15] will look at us and say thank you for
[37:18] helping me and you'll say Lord I never
[37:21] even saw you oh yes you did whenever you
[37:24] encourage my daughter when you encourage
[37:27] my son when you encourage the person
[37:30] that felt so low whenever you sung a
[37:33] song and you didn't even know why he was
[37:35] even singing it but it was such a
[37:37] blessing to them when you help them you
[37:40] helped me wouldn't that be awesome
[37:43] each of us had that opportunity now I
[37:46] wonder how many people that have been
[37:48] around job that job had helped but now
[37:52] job needs help and it seems as if so
[37:56] nobody will help him I was in a terrible
[37:59] State because by this time his
[38:02] children's gone his riches are gone his
[38:06] health has gone job is suffering from
[38:09] what they believed to be by the way he
[38:12] described what he had
[38:14] elephantiasis which was a swelling in
[38:18] his body that would have affected his
[38:21] muscles it would affected his skin it
[38:24] would affect it beneath the skin and it
[38:27] would it was it was a horrific type of
[38:30] disease and it would cause your flesh to
[38:33] start rottening and then you would put
[38:36] out this stench this odor that nobody
[38:40] wanted to be around you actually your
[38:44] breasts would become polluted with this
[38:47] stuff that you were dealing with in your
[38:50] body and then you would have big balls
[38:53] so the corruption was just oozing out of
[38:56] your body now your legs are swollen and
[38:59] tremendous size which is where it gets
[39:01] his name from The Elephant so your arms
[39:04] are swollen the pus is coming out of
[39:07] your body your face your lips his lips
[39:11] would have been swollen and bursted his
[39:15] mouth his ears his face he wouldn't even
[39:18] look like a human being so said been
[39:21] someone since you'd seen Joe
[39:24] and all of a sudden you hear job is sick
[39:26] and you happen to go near where he lives
[39:29] and you see him sitting on the porch and
[39:33] you smell this horrendous smell
[39:36] and someone from the house comes down
[39:38] and said Don't Go Near him we don't even
[39:40] know what the man's got the man is
[39:43] turned against God somehow and God has
[39:45] turned against him don't even go over
[39:48] there remember when his friends came and
[39:51] they saw job they sat there for seven
[39:53] days and seven nights and never opened
[39:57] their mouth and said one word
[39:59] they were so overwhelmed by what they
[40:03] saw now these men were great men as well
[40:05] and they were men of considerable
[40:08] understanding about life and a lot of
[40:10] things about life and whenever your
[40:13] situation would take the breaths of
[40:16] three great renowned men you're in bad
[40:19] shape
[40:20] now job himself didn't know what had
[40:23] taken place in heaven I love the way
[40:26] brother Branham describes it describes
[40:28] this and the message call I know 417 60
[40:32] which was a sunrise service if you want
[40:35] to hear it
[40:36] and he says that God and job had had a
[40:41] debate God and job had a debate and they
[40:45] were debating back and forth and God was
[40:49] the one who brought the special
[40:51] attention about job and God said to the
[40:54] devil have you considered my servant job
[40:57] that there's none like him in all the
[40:59] Earth
[41:00] so God goes to bragging on him and
[41:02] telling him what kind of a person that
[41:04] he is and then the devil of course comes
[41:06] back and said well of course you put
[41:08] this hedge around him and you protect
[41:10] him and you don't let him go through
[41:12] this or that or the other I'll tell what
[41:14] you do you let me have him and he I will
[41:18] and I get done with him he will curse
[41:20] you to your face God said you can't do
[41:24] it I know what kind of man he is the
[41:27] prophet said God had confidence in job
[41:29] because he had been fellowshipping with
[41:33] job but you see job was not aware that
[41:37] this debate had went on so he's praying
[41:40] he's asking God he's petitioning God and
[41:44] God ain't saying nothing to job it's
[41:47] just like God is totally silent so when
[41:51] God gets silent when we're in these
[41:54] times the devil goes to talking to us
[41:57] and then we go to talking to ourself and
[42:00] other people going to talking to us and
[42:03] one time all that talking gets done it
[42:06] leaves you about where job was
[42:09] so job says my kin folk have failed my
[42:13] familiar friends have forgotten me they
[42:15] that dwell in my house and my Maids
[42:18] count me a stranger now these these
[42:21] people would have been the people that
[42:24] would have had to answer to job so if he
[42:27] said come here they better not do that
[42:29] they're going to lose their position
[42:31] but he had lost so much respect even in
[42:36] his own house that maids and servants
[42:39] wouldn't even come now you imagine he's
[42:42] thirsting this disease makes you where
[42:45] you are so thirsty because your body is
[42:49] constantly putting out these fluids so
[42:52] your body is just seeping with these
[42:55] fluids and you're running pus and you're
[42:58] running blood and Corruption oh it must
[43:00] have been an absolute terrible thing so
[43:03] job would have been thirsty said was
[43:04] somebody bring me a drink
[43:09] hello
[43:12] will somebody bring me a drink
[43:17] even his wife
[43:19] wouldn't do it
[43:25] notice he says in verse 16 I call my
[43:28] servant
[43:30] and he gave me no answer
[43:33] I entreated him with my mouse prior to
[43:37] this condition if he would have called
[43:40] for his servant he'd come run it what do
[43:42] you want sir oh great Noble Joe what can
[43:46] I do your least desire whatever you wish
[43:49] for your wish is my command what
[43:52] whatever you want but now
[43:55] he's stricken
[43:57] smitten
[43:59] even his servants won't come
[44:02] so you can imagine the man trying to
[44:05] understand what have I done
[44:08] maybe some of you have been there in
[44:10] your life and you say Lord what have I
[44:12] done
[44:13] if I've done something show me and I'll
[44:16] fix it
[44:18] notice he says I call my servant he gave
[44:21] me no answer I entreated him with my
[44:23] mouse my breast is strange to my wife
[44:29] now even his wife wouldn't get around
[44:31] him now I guarantee you if we would have
[44:34] had a weak stomach
[44:36] it would have been a very difficult
[44:39] thing to get around a person like this
[44:43] I've seen some pretty awful things in my
[44:45] life in different parts of the world
[44:48] where I've been and prayed for a lot of
[44:50] people and you may think that our
[44:53] hospitals here are rough you ain't got a
[44:56] clue till you go to some of the third
[44:58] world countries and see what they deal
[45:00] with seen people on the streets with
[45:03] Leprosy nose gone hand gone fingers gone
[45:07] absolutely awful awful things and the
[45:11] stench that would take your breaths
[45:15] now you look at them and say Well
[45:17] they're homeless they're just heathens
[45:19] or this that the other so that helps us
[45:22] to feel better does it
[45:24] so and what would we say about this man
[45:28] would we have been able to maintain our
[45:32] integrity for who he was now remember
[45:35] who he is he's God's prophet of the age
[45:40] so he is the only one in that entire age
[45:44] not job's wife not job's children not
[45:49] anyone else that God could say was a
[45:52] perfect man what in the world is a
[45:56] perfect man doing going through anything
[46:00] like this
[46:02] but you see there's something about
[46:04] character thrown worthy character that
[46:08] does not come with even the new birth
[46:13] it's hard for us to imagine I know but
[46:15] the Lord Jesus when he came to the Earth
[46:17] how many believe he was the sinless son
[46:19] of God perfect creation of God but yet
[46:23] he himself did not have the character
[46:27] that was needed
[46:31] well according to the church age book
[46:34] and we've read it to you over and over
[46:36] again through the years his character
[46:39] was perfected by the things that he
[46:43] suffered
[46:44] now remember he he laid aside the
[46:47] canosis of God he laid aside many of his
[46:51] great qualities and characteristics and
[46:54] traits of deity and he took on a human
[46:57] form a human nature a human temperament
[47:01] but yet there was some of that that he
[47:04] maintained but he could not overcome his
[47:07] God it would be unfair to you and I he
[47:11] could not face Satan as God he had to
[47:15] face Satan as a man filled with the Holy
[47:18] Ghost using God's word as his only
[47:22] defense
[47:23] he could not use the crown of deity to
[47:27] defeat deaths he could not use the crown
[47:30] of deity to defeat Temptation Jesus
[47:34] conquered women in that day my brothers
[47:37] in the same way we will conquer them and
[47:41] that is the sons of God filled with the
[47:44] Holy Ghost
[47:45] if he conquered his deity and then told
[47:47] you and I to do it we could answer him
[47:49] back and say that is not fair you
[47:52] conquered as God and you are telling me
[47:56] to conquer as a man so what did he do he
[47:59] laid that aside and said all right Sons
[48:01] this is what I will do I will step aside
[48:06] from my position in the heavens I will
[48:09] not conquer sickness as God I will not
[48:12] conquer death as God I will not conquer
[48:15] Temptation I will not conquer Pride
[48:18] arrogant selfishness so on and so on as
[48:21] God I will conquer it as one of my
[48:25] brothers I will conquer it as one of my
[48:29] daughters I will humble myself and lay
[48:32] aside who and what I am
[48:36] and yet he when it comes to the Earth he
[48:40] is perfect as he was father did not
[48:44] create in him a perfect human character
[48:49] he come to the Earth like you and I when
[48:52] it come to that a character that must be
[48:55] molded now remember he was not flawed in
[48:59] the sense that we were but he was not in
[49:02] that sense of having that perfect
[49:04] character which was fit to rule so he
[49:08] must be tried he must be tested he must
[49:12] be misunderstood he must be rejected how
[49:16] many of y'all been ever been rejected
[49:17] before by friends family people of
[49:19] course we all have and there's something
[49:21] about being rejected that's hard on all
[49:25] of us rejection has a different reaction
[49:28] to us than acceptance does when we are
[49:32] accepted it's totally different than we
[49:34] are rejected and really what's different
[49:36] it's whatever you're accepted by people
[49:38] for a long time and then the rejected
[49:40] you'd experience that as far as friends
[49:42] so he had to come the same way he could
[49:46] not just be tried in the sense of up on
[49:49] the the great the Pinnacle of the temple
[49:50] he could not just be tried up on the
[49:53] Mountaintop shown the kingdoms of the
[49:54] world but he must be turned down he must
[49:58] be put into a spot to her whatever he
[50:01] said could happen and his human
[50:04] temperament want to be able to raise up
[50:07] and say I'll get you for that
[50:09] I will get you back remember I will get
[50:13] you no he never done that one time but
[50:17] he had to understand that feeling he had
[50:20] to be able to relate
[50:22] I noticed job says my breath is strange
[50:25] to my wife though I am treated for the
[50:29] children's sake of my own body
[50:32] now imagine his personal reputation as
[50:36] far as his wife was concerned now the
[50:38] one that she could point to him in any
[50:40] way of sin Jehovah you've done this and
[50:42] you've done that and you've done that
[50:43] there was not one thing that the woman
[50:45] could say as a matter of fact she turned
[50:47] right around and told him said why don't
[50:49] you just Curse God and die that's the
[50:51] best thing for you that's the best thing
[50:53] for me that's the best thing for the
[50:55] household just go ahead and curse God
[50:57] and die and get out of this wicked
[50:58] wretched measure in you're an
[51:00] embarrassment to me I have to put up
[51:02] with you you smell like I don't know
[51:04] what I've got to deal with you all the
[51:06] time I have to try to bring you some
[51:08] meals every now and then and you stinks
[51:10] about it can't hardly stand it Brothers
[51:12] can you imagine
[51:13] sisters can you imagine being treated
[51:15] that way oh my and yet job did not know
[51:19] that God had said this man is a perfect
[51:22] man you know myself as I get older and
[51:25] as I travel around and been in different
[51:27] parts of the world and I realize that
[51:30] there's many people around the ranks of
[51:33] our message and probably myself just
[51:36] looking at him I think one of the things
[51:38] that I found the lack which would be one
[51:40] of the biggest likes Among Us is a
[51:43] character which is fit to rule maybe you
[51:47] have signs and wonders and can cast out
[51:49] devils and do that sort of thing and
[51:52] sing and do all all types of works but
[51:55] when it comes to being able to have a
[51:58] character that is throne Worthy
[52:01] I'm afraid we're going to be short that
[52:03] day
[52:04] I'm afraid we're going to find out that
[52:06] many have said in our ranks and some
[52:08] that's even said in our church when it
[52:10] comes to dealing with people coming to
[52:14] know how to deal with them that will say
[52:17] thanks against you and treat you wrong
[52:18] and do this and that and the other it's
[52:21] really really hard it's really difficult
[52:24] for us to be able to rise above our
[52:28] Humanity because we tend to lean toward
[52:31] the nature that was given to us by our
[52:34] parents notice job says yay young
[52:37] children despise me now to us for us to
[52:41] read that in this day and in the age of
[52:44] disrespect that we have it ain't no big
[52:46] deal for little kids and whoever to
[52:48] disrespect you but in that day that was
[52:52] so anti-cultural for the way that they
[52:56] were brought up because the way that
[52:58] they would have been in silver remember
[52:59] job is the oldest book of the Bible so
[53:01] for them to have this this ability to
[53:05] treat job in this way they must have
[53:08] been hearing it in their home from their
[53:11] parents so their parents must have been
[53:14] the one that was talking maybe around
[53:16] the table and they were saying have you
[53:18] heard about job have you heard this how
[53:20] many of you heard about Joe yeah man I
[53:22] heard about that I'll tell you what I
[53:23] don't know when I've ever been surprised
[53:25] in my life I thought that was a great
[53:28] man of God didn't you I sure did I
[53:30] thought that man just walked with god
[53:33] well I guess we was wrong because it's
[53:35] easy to see now from what I hear you
[53:37] can't even get in the room or that man
[53:39] is they tell me I was talking down to
[53:42] some of some of the sisters the other
[53:44] day down at the store and they told me
[53:46] that they got kind of close out too
[53:48] though they brought some butter and eggs
[53:49] and things like that and wanted to say
[53:51] Miss Joe might want to buy some and they
[53:53] got right up close to the porch and the
[53:55] stench was so bad one of them sisters
[53:58] told me that she had to just run out
[54:00] there and leave she couldn't even sell
[54:01] her eggs and her batter and her molasses
[54:04] and her sorghum and all that stuff she
[54:06] got so sick and she got behind the Big
[54:08] Bay Tree over there and that poor Saint
[54:10] started vomiting because the smell that
[54:13] was coming out of that house well see
[54:16] right there that's what I'm talking
[54:17] about there ain't no way in the world
[54:19] that that could be a man of God and
[54:22] going through that type of trial
[54:25] come on
[54:27] uh testing one two three am I am I okay
[54:29] am I working I I wonder sometimes if we
[54:33] don't look at people and judge them by
[54:36] what they're going through and begin to
[54:37] sing ah there must be something wrong
[54:40] job's comforters
[54:44] oh my
[54:46] God oh my goodness notice yeah young
[54:48] children to despise me I Rose and they
[54:51] spoke they spake against me all my
[54:55] inward friends now we move into the
[54:57] closest friends that a person can have
[55:00] them I know we all have friends by
[55:01] degrees I have friends around the world
[55:04] my goodness I've been blessed by the
[55:05] grace of God I've got friends around the
[55:08] world but then you have close intimate
[55:10] friends and then you have that inner
[55:12] Inner Circle you know what I'm talking
[55:14] about and you may not have that many in
[55:16] that inner circle but you just feel like
[55:18] they're the ones that will stick with
[55:20] you through sick and sin they'll be
[55:23] right there no matter what you're going
[55:24] through and you can tell them anything
[55:26] and they're the type of friend that
[55:28] whenever you're down you can tell them
[55:30] and they're just brother hang in there
[55:31] I'm right there with him but yet job had
[55:34] tried that so it broke all of the
[55:37] circles of friends that he had those
[55:39] that were acquaintances and they all
[55:41] surely knew them and they knew him and
[55:43] that showed him respect but they were
[55:45] some of the first ones to get go but
[55:47] then it got closer and closer and the
[55:50] circles kept breaking and breaking and
[55:52] now Joe is actually at the inward Circle
[55:55] the very closeness of all friends all my
[55:58] inward friends abhorred me they whom I
[56:02] love are turned against me
[56:05] now over what reason what had the man
[56:08] done the man had not taken somebody
[56:11] else's wife had not molested one of the
[56:14] maids that was in the house he had not
[56:16] robbed anybody did not cheated anybody a
[56:20] man of honor and integrity oh but you
[56:23] see the hand of God
[56:24] have been turned loose on this man
[56:27] isn't it amazing
[56:30] I mean Carol heard
[56:35] the devours that we've known for many
[56:36] many years and we heard this as it was
[56:39] coming back down the road and you know
[56:41] the prophet when he relates to this you
[56:44] know I love to dramatize him how
[56:45] beautiful it was when he would do it his
[56:48] friends had turned against him and job
[56:51] did not know and understand that God was
[56:55] going to bring out of this the greatest
[56:57] thing of his entire life but it certain
[57:00] it didn't seem like it it's higher
[57:01] quoted it to us early when he sung the
[57:03] song and by the way I didn't know Harry
[57:04] was singing that song matter of fact
[57:06] first time I ever heard in my life I
[57:08] didn't know that Harry was singing to
[57:09] her he didn't know what I was preaching
[57:10] but I believe the Lord has us in mind
[57:13] today
[57:14] I love it when God does that don't you
[57:16] you see the real spirit of God I don't
[57:18] have to call Brother Louie and tell
[57:19] Brother Louie he's saying this song but
[57:21] the Lord have that brother sang that
[57:22] song have sister that sang that song but
[57:24] the spirit of God knows how to be able
[57:26] to orchestrate things together doesn't
[57:28] he
[57:29] so it must have been to where that now
[57:32] it has come so close notice that job
[57:35] says my N word all my inward friends
[57:37] abhorred me and they whom I loved are
[57:40] turned against me my bone Cleaves to my
[57:44] skin notice now he says my bone cleave
[57:47] us to my skin so this part of his flesh
[57:51] what's the elephantiasis has not are all
[57:54] swollen out his bones and they're just
[57:57] like glued his skin is glued to his
[58:00] bones and the inflammation must have
[58:02] been absolutely terrible no doubt when
[58:04] it first started there was he could
[58:06] afford some of the best doctors that was
[58:07] in the land of us and the like the
[58:09] doctors would have come in all types of
[58:11] Specialists and maybe he went to clinics
[58:13] and hospitals of that day whatever they
[58:15] were and they tried to diagnose him and
[58:18] they rubbed him with all types of herbs
[58:19] and compounds and this and that and the
[58:22] other I don't care what they would have
[58:23] tried there's absolutely nothing that
[58:26] could have cured this man until it come
[58:28] time time for God to turn the tide
[58:31] now let me tell you today maybe you're
[58:33] in the state and you're praying about a
[58:35] Deliverance of whatever it is now I
[58:37] don't know too much about God but I do
[58:39] know enough about him to know sometimes
[58:41] he has a reason the prophet said that
[58:43] this way when we pray that sometimes God
[58:46] says yes sometimes he says no and
[58:50] sometimes he says wait a while now if
[58:53] God says wait a while then he has a
[58:57] reason for making you wait because a lot
[58:59] of times during that waiting period
[59:01] there's pain involved there's separation
[59:04] involved those anxiety involved God is
[59:07] not doing that without a reason can
[59:09] anybody say Amen
[59:11] but when God does say wait maybe it's
[59:15] for one more doctor to see you and agree
[59:19] with all the rest of them there is no
[59:22] medical hope
[59:24] you'll absolutely be on hell you're
[59:27] beyond science maybe God wants one more
[59:30] rehab therapist or one more nurse or one
[59:34] more specialist to be able to add their
[59:37] name to the ones that's already on the
[59:39] list and say well we feel sorry for them
[59:42] but there's nothing else we can do and
[59:44] then when God turns it around it's one
[59:47] testimony after another after another
[59:49] after another after another of what God
[59:53] did what they could not do so I've
[59:57] learned myself that whenever the Lord
[59:59] delays it's not that he doesn't care and
[1:00:02] it's not that God gets joy out of
[1:00:05] watching his children and anxiety God
[1:00:08] does not enjoy him whenever he sees me
[1:00:10] and you so burdened down and so trouble
[1:00:13] and it seemed like that we cannot be
[1:00:15] able to make it another day and we think
[1:00:18] Lord what have we done what have we done
[1:00:19] tell us let us know it's not that God is
[1:00:22] saying haha I really enjoy watching you
[1:00:25] all suffer this is so much fun no God is
[1:00:28] not that type of a god
[1:00:30] oh my aren't you glad he's a loving
[1:00:32] father so many says wait a while it's
[1:00:35] for a reason now notice he said my bone
[1:00:38] Cleaver to my skin and to My Flesh and I
[1:00:41] am escaped with the skin of my teeth I
[1:00:46] don't take a rocket scientist to run
[1:00:47] your tongue over the top of your teeth
[1:00:49] right now you can do it if you like you
[1:00:51] realize you ain't got much there so it's
[1:00:54] pretty thin is it not job said I'm right
[1:00:57] down to the very last had pity upon me
[1:01:01] have pity upon me oh you my friends
[1:01:06] what's he doing now job is answering
[1:01:08] back to his comforters who've come down
[1:01:11] and they said you're a secret sinner you
[1:01:14] ain't right with God you've got
[1:01:16] something going on in your life yes
[1:01:17] that's what it is you've got something
[1:01:19] going on in your life why look here look
[1:01:21] that this certain certain woman could
[1:01:23] have come through a prayer line she come
[1:01:25] to that said bob hair had on lipstick
[1:01:28] this and that mother and God absolutely
[1:01:30] deal and yet look at you you love the
[1:01:34] Lord and you believe him with all of
[1:01:36] your heart and you've had a harder time
[1:01:38] since a prayer line than you had before
[1:01:40] then there must be something wrong with
[1:01:42] you no it must be something right with
[1:01:45] you
[1:01:45] there must be something about you that
[1:01:49] God can trust you I hope you understand
[1:01:51] what I'm fixing to say there are many
[1:01:54] many Christians in this world that God
[1:01:58] cannot trust with great trouble
[1:02:01] there are many message Believers that
[1:02:05] God cannot trust with great difficulty
[1:02:09] there are message preachers that God
[1:02:13] could not trust with a great load of
[1:02:16] anxiety and trouble he simply could not
[1:02:19] they could not bear it they could not
[1:02:23] take it
[1:02:24] now maybe you're saying Glory Hallelujah
[1:02:27] I hope I'm one of them well I feel sorry
[1:02:30] for if that's your attitude I want God
[1:02:33] to be able to trust me with whatever he
[1:02:35] knows I can bear don't you I'm not
[1:02:37] looking for a fiery bed of ease myself
[1:02:39] now notice he said have pity on me had
[1:02:42] pity on me oh you're my friends for the
[1:02:44] hand of God has touched me now you see
[1:02:47] here in a sense job is wrong
[1:02:52] hey send me a quote the other day and
[1:02:54] I'll read it to you momentarily that
[1:02:56] brother Randall said that if as long as
[1:02:59] Joe if Satan could convince job that it
[1:03:04] was God doing this to him he had him
[1:03:07] defeated
[1:03:08] but once he understood God was not doing
[1:03:11] this but God was allowing Satan to if
[1:03:15] you listen to that message I know you'll
[1:03:17] hear Brother random say that God will
[1:03:19] allow those Messengers you remember in
[1:03:22] the Old Testament when that demon that
[1:03:24] lying Spirit come and God said how can I
[1:03:26] get the people to be able to fulfill
[1:03:28] what I said by Mine by Prophet Elijah
[1:03:31] remember that an aligned Spirit come up
[1:03:33] before the Throne of God and bowed down
[1:03:36] before God and said I'll go down there
[1:03:38] and be a lying Spirit and the mouse of
[1:03:40] all them false prophets if you want me
[1:03:41] to now remember God cannot anoint
[1:03:43] anybody to lie God cannot anoint any
[1:03:47] person to ever leave his word that's why
[1:03:50] the word is our absolute feelings will
[1:03:54] deceive us that means ever had your
[1:03:56] feelings to deceive you of course they
[1:03:58] will dreams are not infallible now a lot
[1:04:03] of dreams you have is like the ones I
[1:04:04] have you ate too much sauce and chips
[1:04:06] before you went to bed that night and
[1:04:08] you had too much indigestion that caused
[1:04:10] this weird dream and then you get up
[1:04:12] thinking oh Lord there was 13 crows and
[1:04:14] there was three buzzards and there was
[1:04:16] three turpentine bottles and that was
[1:04:17] three moon pies one of them Moonpies are
[1:04:20] doing there I can't figure that out all
[1:04:22] that it must have been some spiritual I
[1:04:24] doubt it what did you eat before you
[1:04:26] went to bed now come on Church don't get
[1:04:29] quiet on me but yet you realize God will
[1:04:32] actually tap into that and allow these
[1:04:35] things to do it God did not touch Joe it
[1:04:38] was not the hand of God but job thought
[1:04:41] it was it was actually God bringing him
[1:04:44] to a state of perfection
[1:04:47] notice in verse 22 why do you persecute
[1:04:50] me as God are you not satisfied with my
[1:04:54] flesh you know in other words he's
[1:04:55] saying what what you mean you all can't
[1:04:57] see the pitiful shape that I'm in it
[1:05:00] must have been horrendous I cannot
[1:05:01] imagine by the Jack how them friends is
[1:05:03] even so-called even sat there within
[1:05:06] hearing distance of this man's voice and
[1:05:09] they were mesmerized by the state of
[1:05:12] this man sitting there so much that
[1:05:14] didn't even say a word for seven days
[1:05:16] and nights now notice he says all that
[1:05:19] my words were now written oh that they
[1:05:23] were printed in a book little did he
[1:05:26] know they would be
[1:05:29] thank God they were all that my words
[1:05:33] were printed in a book that they were
[1:05:37] Graven with an iron pen and led in the
[1:05:41] rock forever now notice when he comes
[1:05:45] right down to it look at something he
[1:05:48] knows
[1:05:50] for
[1:05:52] ah no
[1:05:54] now that was a lot he didn't know Joe
[1:05:57] why are you going through this I don't
[1:05:59] know why is your wife forsaken you your
[1:06:02] servants forsaken you why don't God hear
[1:06:04] you on your prayer I don't know why
[1:06:06] don't God heal you as soon as you ask
[1:06:09] him I don't know why has all of your
[1:06:12] friends turned away from you I don't
[1:06:13] know do you know of anything that you
[1:06:16] have done so I don't know of anything
[1:06:19] and he could say I don't know I don't
[1:06:22] know I don't know anybody ever been
[1:06:24] there besides job oh yeah and you just
[1:06:27] don't know this and you don't know that
[1:06:28] but there's one thing left which was
[1:06:32] very important that he knew I'll tell
[1:06:35] you a friend I don't care what you're
[1:06:37] going through here today if all hell is
[1:06:40] breaking loose against you if you can
[1:06:42] have this same I know that job had it
[1:06:47] will shake all hell around you

[1:06:58] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[1:07:01] lighter day upon the earth I do know
[1:07:06] this I have a redeemer now remember he
[1:07:10] was abled by the spirit of God to move
[1:07:13] forward in time under this divine
[1:07:15] inspiration and be able to say I don't
[1:07:18] know why I'm sick I don't know why my
[1:07:19] wife won't even speak to him and my kids

[1:07:41] thing my God's A Healer well I believe
[1:07:43] we know more than just one thing I
[1:07:46] believe our God is El Shady eyes I
[1:07:49] believe he is Redeemer he is our healer
[1:07:52] he is our deliverer I wish somebody
[1:07:53] would preach with me this morning you
[1:07:55] see job come down the way I had one
[1:07:58] thing left that he knew oh you have got
[1:08:01] a whole heart full today you have got a
[1:08:03] whole message full of things that God
[1:08:07] has given us in the positive affirmation
[1:08:09] I know this word is right I know there's
[1:08:13] a Rapture I know he's coming I know I'm
[1:08:16] going I know you're going with me well
[1:08:19] somebody say amen I know Jesus Christ is
[1:08:22] the same yesterday today and forever I
[1:08:25] know he's coming back I know Satan will
[1:08:29] bow
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:35] I know
[1:08:38] look at me again in job 23 8.
[1:08:42] look at the search and the Quest for God
[1:08:45] in such deep anxiety
[1:08:48] you know God
[1:08:50] has such a way of hiding
[1:08:53] he not only hides from the church orders
[1:08:56] and a lot of the seminaries
[1:08:59] but when he wants to
[1:09:00] he can hide from the elect
[1:09:08] behold
[1:09:09] I go forward
[1:09:12] but he's not there
[1:09:14] backward
[1:09:17] but I cannot perceive him
[1:09:19] on the left hand
[1:09:21] where he does work
[1:09:22] I see that's him I know that's him doing
[1:09:25] this so I go over to be a part of it
[1:09:30] and he will let me have nothing
[1:09:34] on the left hand where he does work
[1:09:37] but I cannot Behold Him so I see his
[1:09:39] works and I see manifest in himself and
[1:09:41] I said God please remember me please
[1:09:43] remember me
[1:09:45] mississaugi turns away from me
[1:09:49] he hideths himself on the right hand you
[1:09:52] imagine almighty God hiding from job
[1:09:57] well I'll tell you one thing I've never
[1:09:59] been through on show bad but I have
[1:10:00] experienced a few of these things myself
[1:10:01] anybody else in here
[1:10:04] well glory to God I'm so glad to know
[1:10:06] the rest y'all just live on Mount sunset
[1:10:09] or whatever the name of your mountain is
[1:10:11] wow it must be awesome come see me after
[1:10:13] church tell me how that is
[1:10:16] so I looked at him on the left and I
[1:10:18] looked for him on the right and whenever
[1:10:19] I just knew he'd be there and when I
[1:10:22] turned he hid himself from
[1:10:27] me oh my
[1:10:29] God he Harvest himself on the right hand
[1:10:31] that I cannot see him
[1:10:35] but he's still got some hope left
[1:10:38] but he knows
[1:10:41] the way that I take
[1:10:44] when he has tried me
[1:10:47] I shall come forth as gold
[1:10:53] and Word of Life said
[1:10:56] what he has tried me I shall come Force
[1:11:01] like gold
[1:11:04] notice this and how can overcome Christ
[1:11:06] is the ruler's Throne ruler at this time
[1:11:09] of the complete domain of God
[1:11:11] so will the church be with him the bride
[1:11:15] be with him in his throne in his entire
[1:11:18] domain see not on my throne but in my
[1:11:23] Throne now remember he's reading the
[1:11:25] scripture there in Revelation that we
[1:11:27] will set with him in his throne not on
[1:11:30] the liberal Throne itself but in his
[1:11:33] domain in his Dominion notice a throne
[1:11:38] is over a domain at a domain reaches as
[1:11:42] far as its boundaries does and this is
[1:11:45] from eternity to Eternity just think of
[1:11:48] it now this is what the Lord has given
[1:11:52] us the right to be
[1:11:54] but it's a mystery really because he
[1:11:56] calls us chooses Us by predestination
[1:11:59] thought of us before the foundation of
[1:12:02] the world that thought is eternal then
[1:12:05] when we come to the Earth that thought
[1:12:07] is deposited in our soul it lays our
[1:12:10] dormant for years and years then one day
[1:12:13] we become Born Again by the breast of
[1:12:16] God and we start changing my things just
[1:12:19] fall off and other things we have to
[1:12:20] work on for a long time but we started
[1:12:22] having or going heavenward and then day
[1:12:25] by day we go through things and there'll
[1:12:27] be days that things go good and there'll
[1:12:29] be times that will lose a little ground
[1:12:31] but we don't lose it for long we regain
[1:12:33] it again is that right and then we just
[1:12:35] keep on pressing and pressing and
[1:12:37] pressing and we're overcoming this and
[1:12:39] overcoming that but yet there's still
[1:12:42] something lacking in us that the baptism
[1:12:44] of the Holy Ghost did not give and that
[1:12:47] is a character that is so much like the
[1:12:51] Lord Jesus that one day Fallen angels
[1:12:55] and people will walk before us as we sit
[1:12:58] with him in his throne
[1:13:01] and we
[1:13:03] will judge them
[1:13:07] so was our present character here today
[1:13:12] I wonder how we would judge if the
[1:13:14] Judgment were called this morning
[1:13:17] no doubt there's people that we would
[1:13:19] judge wrongly in the sense that we are
[1:13:22] so convinced they are just such
[1:13:24] wonderful people but you don't know in
[1:13:27] six months from now they will do this
[1:13:29] this and this and this and totally turn
[1:13:31] away from God and leave his word yeah we
[1:13:34] judge by sight or how much we like them
[1:13:41] Ain't No Way in the world he'll be a no
[1:13:44] bride ain't no way she can be an old
[1:13:46] bride my goodness you know you you heard
[1:13:48] the latest one him or her done but you
[1:13:50] know this service might change him or
[1:13:53] her and they'll never be the same again
[1:13:55] so that you judge that they were serpent
[1:13:58] seed and you totally missed him can't
[1:14:00] you see even the new birth does not give
[1:14:04] to us that divine nature to be able to
[1:14:07] judge and have the right type of
[1:14:09] character or that we know how to deal
[1:14:11] with people well praise the Lord now it
[1:14:14] is that part that God must mold and
[1:14:17] shape in each of us now notice he says
[1:14:21] in the Sumerian Church age a man without
[1:14:23] character can't Reign because power
[1:14:25] apart from character is satanic but
[1:14:28] Power with character is fit to rule and
[1:14:32] since he wants us to share even as
[1:14:34] strong on the same basis that he
[1:14:35] overcame and has set down on his
[1:14:37] father's son that we have to overcome
[1:14:39] the set with him overcome what just
[1:14:42] drinking smoking lying help all of that
[1:14:45] too but mainly ourselves
[1:14:49] ourselves even after you lay aside all
[1:14:52] them habits you still live in that old
[1:14:55] stinking rotten body of yours just like
[1:14:58] I do in mine now notice he says that we
[1:15:02] have to have this type of character to
[1:15:04] be able to Reign he wants to share with
[1:15:08] us what he has then we have to overcome
[1:15:10] to set with him and the little temporary
[1:15:12] suffering we go through now it's not
[1:15:14] worthy to be competitive the tremendous
[1:15:15] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:15:18] it comes oh what Treasures are laid up
[1:15:22] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:15:26] his kingdom

[1:21:31] he said it will still come back whom I
[1:21:34] shall see for myself mine eyes Shall
[1:21:36] Behold and not another he said it job
[1:21:39] listen to this I love this why he was a
[1:21:43] believer
[1:21:44] and trials he was a Believer a man wants
[1:21:47] to be a believer in trials that's what
[1:21:49] gets a lot of people in persecution he
[1:21:53] was a Believer he was a genuine believer
[1:21:56] and trouble I want to be a believer and
[1:21:59] sickness I still want to be a be a
[1:22:01] believer in delays and circumstances I
[1:22:05] don't understand I still want to be a
[1:22:07] believer well that ain't hard because I
[1:22:09] am a believer so I'm not just a believer
[1:22:12] in the good times I'm not just a
[1:22:14] believer or come on somebody I'm not
[1:22:16] just a believer when things is going
[1:22:18] good I'm not just a believer when I got
[1:22:20] friends everywhere I was still a
[1:22:22] believer in love the message folks
[1:22:24] turned me down years ago but I'm still a
[1:22:26] Believer come on somebody I want to be a
[1:22:29] believer when Satan says he ain't going
[1:22:31] to move I say yes he is because I'm his
[1:22:34] son well when's he going to do it I
[1:22:36] don't know but I know he'll do it I
[1:22:39] don't know how he's going to change our
[1:22:41] body I don't know when the rights is
[1:22:43] coming but I believe with all of my soul
[1:22:46] it is I believe there's people here
[1:22:49] today that are going to enter into that
[1:22:52] rapture
[1:23:00] notice in this sermon I know it is
[1:23:03] written in one of the scriptures in the
[1:23:05] Bible the trials brought upon us are
[1:23:07] more precious to us than gold itself
[1:23:09] where does God giving us these trials
[1:23:12] after we become his property
[1:23:14] our confession and our baptism and our
[1:23:16] promise to walk in life for him then
[1:23:18] every child that comes upon us is to
[1:23:21] perfect us
[1:23:23] for his glory
[1:23:25] I say brother Donnie wait a minute I
[1:23:27] thought the blood of Jesus perfects us
[1:23:29] two different words
[1:23:32] two different words in the New Testament
[1:23:34] use for perfect
[1:23:37] one of them is complete
[1:23:40] adding what is lacking the other one is
[1:23:44] sinlessness
[1:23:47] this character of Trials and things you
[1:23:49] go through does not make you sinless the
[1:23:52] blood does that
[1:23:54] but these types of things what do they
[1:23:57] do they add what's lacking in our walk
[1:24:00] with God anybody here today be honest
[1:24:03] with me so I need help brother Tony I've
[1:24:05] got things missing in my walk of God I
[1:24:07] need it well you see what brother does
[1:24:09] that mean that I'm lost absolutely not
[1:24:10] I'm talking about a separate thing than
[1:24:13] your soul being sinless in the eyes of
[1:24:16] God do you understand whenever he hears
[1:24:17] you pray if you're in Christ Jesus say
[1:24:19] let me hear your voice it's coming right
[1:24:22] up through the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:23] it's the same as the Lord Jesus himself
[1:24:25] praying and yet our human character can
[1:24:28] still be flawed oh what a great mystery
[1:24:30] the new birth is and God absolutely
[1:24:33] hears us and the angels of God have to
[1:24:36] stand there while we which were lost
[1:24:38] without God God would hear our prayer
[1:24:40] the prophet says it over and over again
[1:24:42] who has more Authority in heaven a Son
[1:24:45] of God or an angel you know the answer
[1:24:46] to that it's a Son of God and yet that
[1:24:49] Son of God in the earth may be lacking
[1:24:51] oh my so much in his human character
[1:24:53] though one he prays Heaven answers
[1:24:56] whenever he prays have an answers and
[1:24:59] God will send angels to that son or
[1:25:01] daughter of God and yet they're missing
[1:25:03] so much in their character
[1:25:06] praise God
[1:25:08] notice this it's to bring us to a place
[1:25:11] where God
[1:25:13] can make himself more real to us than he
[1:25:17] was before the trial
[1:25:20] came
[1:25:22] wow
[1:25:25] so I'm standing at the Carter County
[1:25:27] Bank
[1:25:28] a little bit ago
[1:25:30] and the teller of the lady there
[1:25:33] they know us go to the banks with them
[1:25:34] for years and years from the church and
[1:25:35] stuff every time I walk in she says
[1:25:38] hello preacher that's why she calls me
[1:25:40] all the time preacher
[1:25:42] so there's several things going on there
[1:25:44] and I need to do a little something
[1:25:45] there for me she said well you just have
[1:25:47] to give me a minute I preacher he said
[1:25:49] patience ain't one of my virtues I've
[1:25:51] been praying God but give me more
[1:25:53] I said ma'am
[1:25:54] the Bible says tribulation workers
[1:25:57] patience
[1:25:58] patience experience experience hope hope
[1:26:02] maketh not a shame because the love of
[1:26:04] God has been shed abroad in our hearts
[1:26:06] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[1:26:08] and she said maybe I should not pray
[1:26:09] that way no more
[1:26:13] another teller lady was there and she
[1:26:15] said what was you just quoting to her so
[1:26:17] I go back through it again nothing like
[1:26:18] a Bible study right in Carter County
[1:26:20] Bank right
[1:26:22] she said but you mind telling me what
[1:26:24] that scripture is say Yes Man be glad to
[1:26:26] but there's something about it
[1:26:28] tribulation workers our patience and it
[1:26:31] brings something that after the trial is
[1:26:33] over I heard people and they're going to
[1:26:36] think I'm crazy but I've heard people so
[1:26:38] oh my in the last couple of years has
[1:26:40] had cancer had this and that and the
[1:26:42] other and one particular person said
[1:26:44] right here looking at me today said I
[1:26:46] would take absolutely nothing
[1:26:49] for what I went through
[1:26:51] because when I came through on the other
[1:26:53] side I was closer to God than I had ever
[1:26:56] been in my life and I've come to your
[1:26:58] church for years and years and heard
[1:27:00] you're preaching and this and that but
[1:27:02] that trial done something for me that
[1:27:05] all the preaching I heard never done of
[1:27:07] course the thing of it is all that
[1:27:09] preaching helped build up their faith
[1:27:10] and give them the ability to go through
[1:27:12] that trial and we know that but there's
[1:27:14] something about trials it does US good
[1:27:17] oh how many wants one now
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:22] one person okay God bless you sis I'll
[1:27:25] be praying for you oh Bob that's there's
[1:27:28] something about it it goes more than
[1:27:30] somebody writing you a check for ten
[1:27:31] thousand dollars time the IRS gets their
[1:27:33] part and your grandson gets the other
[1:27:35] four your wife gets the other party you
[1:27:37] won't have much left anyhow and trials
[1:27:39] bring something to us that is more
[1:27:41] precious than gold or if this building
[1:27:44] will stop full of gold today we say oh
[1:27:46] my everybody get what you want get your
[1:27:48] portion pay your household pay your car
[1:27:51] off pay your bills off mine we'll come

[1:27:59] got a house full of gold let me tell you
[1:28:01] something you have already heard enough

[1:28:11] when the world is on fire this will keep
[1:28:15] you in test when you ain't got a Pity to
[1:28:18] your name

[1:28:26] let me close
[1:28:29] but the band says I want to join in this
[1:28:31] morning
[1:28:32] with job
[1:28:34] to say I've lived long enough to know
[1:28:38] that's the truth
[1:28:40] I've seen it in my own life
[1:28:44] that every time a great trip situation
[1:28:46] arouses
[1:28:49] I can't get around it
[1:28:52] I can't go under it
[1:28:54] Oh Glory
[1:28:56] can't get around it can't go under it
[1:28:58] can't go over it
[1:29:01] God makes a way and comes out glorious
[1:29:05] I just wonder how his grace ever does it
[1:29:08] but he doesn't
[1:29:10] how many has been there one is fed so
[1:29:13] big and you look around well can't go
[1:29:15] that way I want about this way no can't
[1:29:17] go that way no can't go that way well
[1:29:18] what about is it better than maybe we go
[1:29:20] on the top of you trying you're trying
[1:29:21] nope it's It's Too Tall can't go over
[1:29:23] well what if we dig under it you go to
[1:29:25] digging digging digging sweating digging
[1:29:27] and you realize I think man it's way
[1:29:28] bigger than I thought it was so you
[1:29:30] can't go around to the left you can't go
[1:29:32] around to the right you can't go if
[1:29:33] every King oh Lord and how in the world
[1:29:35] does God ever do it well he comes right
[1:29:36] through sometimes he just carves a hole
[1:29:38] right in the middle of it and you walk
[1:29:39] straight through it on the other side
[1:29:41] God just perfect in building tunnels he
[1:29:44] is an absolute Master tunnel Beetle
[1:29:46] Builder so the greatest trial you've
[1:29:48] ever faced in your life you may be
[1:29:50] looking at a mountain today that is
[1:29:52] solid grounded as we would say and you
[1:29:54] think there is no way around it it's too
[1:29:57] tall I've done got binoculars up there
[1:29:59] and I've done done and we shot down in
[1:30:01] there 40 feet deep and we can't go below
[1:30:03] it well maybe the Lord God wants to just
[1:30:05] open up the Rock and cause you to go
[1:30:08] right through on the other side and
[1:30:10] quotes that when you get through and say
[1:30:11] see their child I was with you the whole
[1:30:14] time
[1:30:20] when it looks like everything has gone
[1:30:22] wrong
[1:30:24] God's given you a trial
[1:30:28] listen to this
[1:30:30] it's got confidence
[1:30:37] he don't have to baby you around
[1:30:39] you're not a hot blood plant a hybrid
[1:30:42] you're a real Christian
[1:30:45] God has given you a test see
[1:30:48] what you'll do about it amen no wonder
[1:30:50] Peter said these fire trials why countic
[1:30:52] Joy
[1:30:54] I'm still working on that part sometimes
[1:30:59] counted Joy it's more precious to you
[1:31:01] than go to many times we hum and haul
[1:31:04] Herman Hall how many over homes and
[1:31:06] Halls
[1:31:09] that's mule language you know that right
[1:31:11] humming Hall
[1:31:12] new language that's the stubbornness
[1:31:14] still in us wait home and home oh well
[1:31:17] well that well that something God's give
[1:31:19] to you to overcome
[1:31:22] he knows
[1:31:25] he knows
[1:31:28] you'll do it
[1:31:30] he's put his Trust
[1:31:34] and you
[1:31:41] maybe I'm crazy okay
[1:31:43] I would rather have that right there
[1:31:45] than every gift
[1:31:48] if I was the greatest preacher in the
[1:31:50] world if I was the greatest this and
[1:31:51] another wind up missing it and being
[1:31:52] lost now a person could be that and have
[1:31:54] this too
[1:31:55] but they could also have that and be
[1:31:57] lost
[1:31:58] as a matter of fact I sit at the funeral
[1:31:59] the other day and there was an older
[1:32:01] brother standing there
[1:32:02] him and his wife got married
[1:32:04] and they spent their honeymoon
[1:32:06] in Bakersfield California
[1:32:08] at brother Brown's meetings in 1964.
[1:32:11] so he's an older preacher I'd imagine
[1:32:13] 80s maybe something like that and
[1:32:15] somebody come to the message boy just
[1:32:17] you know just love so much about it
[1:32:19] but one thing that stumbled him awful
[1:32:22] women preachers oh you guessed it you
[1:32:25] had a woman pastor
[1:32:27] he saw this woman preacher raise the
[1:32:30] Dead
[1:32:32] he saw this woman preach or pray for
[1:32:35] people I have all kinds of Miracles all
[1:32:38] kinds of healings
[1:32:40] and he said brother Donnie I never heard
[1:32:42] a human being preached like that woman
[1:32:44] could preach
[1:32:45] said she could preach much better than a
[1:32:48] lot of men
[1:32:53] but he said one day the Lord made it
[1:32:55] real to him
[1:32:57] that it was against the word
[1:33:01] and when he did
[1:33:03] it just lifted him
[1:33:05] so you see you could cast out Devils you
[1:33:07] could raise the dead you could do all of
[1:33:09] those things but can God put his Trust
[1:33:16] I'm sure you feel like I feel I don't
[1:33:19] put my trust in everybody
[1:33:21] no I've been around too long for that
[1:33:25] there ain't nobody no mortal that I put
[1:33:29] my ultimate trust in when it comes to as
[1:33:31] far as a preacher no I've done been
[1:33:33] dealt too bad by preachers
[1:33:35] there's one person I put in my ultimate
[1:33:37] trust in
[1:33:39] I love you all and I trust you and
[1:33:40] you'll have to trust me if I can help
[1:33:42] you but don't put your ultimate trust in
[1:33:43] me because I'll fail you
[1:33:45] ever preacher that you've got your
[1:33:47] ultimate tested faith in I feel sorry
[1:33:49] for you because you're one closer one
[1:33:52] preacher closer to not even believing in
[1:33:54] them because all you got to do is be
[1:33:55] hurt by that one and then you're
[1:33:57] finishing person I don't believe in
[1:33:59] Precious no more got too much trust in
[1:34:01] him didn't you
[1:34:03] trust is such a great thing can you
[1:34:05] imagine almighty God
[1:34:07] putting trust in you young men
[1:34:10] your young sisters your brothers
[1:34:13] your preachers your Deacons
[1:34:15] God saying Judy
[1:34:19] I trust you I'm gonna take Junior
[1:34:22] it's my will
[1:34:25] but I know you
[1:34:26] I know you'll still love me
[1:34:29] Linda
[1:34:30] I'm gonna take Jimmy
[1:34:33] it's gonna break your heart
[1:34:37] you'll think you ain't got nothing else
[1:34:39] to live for
[1:34:41] but I trust you
[1:34:46] can he trust you
[1:34:54] that's a more value friends than tongues
[1:34:57] interpretation prophecy
[1:35:01] if God trusts
[1:35:04] you know how we are as humans the more I
[1:35:06] get hurt in life the less people I trust
[1:35:11] I saw a bumper sticker not long ago said
[1:35:13] the more I get around humans the more I
[1:35:15] love animals
[1:35:19] I'm fixing to have a body wrap done in
[1:35:21] my vehicle that way
[1:35:27] you know what I'm saying
[1:35:28] people that you feel are your closest
[1:35:31] and dearest friends and they'll stab you
[1:35:34] in the back
[1:35:36] and turn on you just like
[1:35:40] and what do we tend to do I won't trust
[1:35:42] nobody else I won't trust nobody and you
[1:35:44] know who you're fixing to hurt the worst
[1:35:46] yourself
[1:35:50] if you folks that had done to you what
[1:35:52] I've had done to me by preachers
[1:35:54] entering around this message and around
[1:35:56] the world you wouldn't be at this church
[1:35:58] today as a matter of fact you'd never
[1:35:59] Stark on another church door because you
[1:36:02] think hey no preachers right they'll lie
[1:36:05] to you for money I've had them to lie to
[1:36:07] me for money I've had them to lie for me
[1:36:09] for this and that the other betray your
[1:36:11] trust use you for what they can get out
[1:36:14] of you
[1:36:16] and I still believe in Preachers
[1:36:26] nobody had been hurt by preachers like
[1:36:27] brother Branham had but brother Branham
[1:36:30] hoped both of his boys would be
[1:36:34] preachers
[1:36:36] aha
[1:36:38] well Lewis Lawrence comes to our church
[1:36:40] here brother Branham dedicated his
[1:36:42] brother and himself in 1961 and he
[1:36:46] prayed a prayer over him may God make
[1:36:48] him a preacher notice the dedication
[1:36:50] that brother Branham had over little
[1:36:52] boys pray they're similar to the very
[1:36:54] same prayer make a preacher out of them
[1:36:56] make a picture out of him he had been
[1:36:58] hurt and more hurt by preachers than all
[1:37:00] of us put together no doubt but it was
[1:37:02] still God's word
[1:37:05] I want to trust his word
[1:37:07] and then he can trust me
[1:37:11] with Santa got him
[1:37:17] oh my
[1:37:20] he knows you'll do it
[1:37:23] he's put Trust
[1:37:26] he knew when he took Hope from Brother
[1:37:28] Branham
[1:37:29] when he took his little girl
[1:37:32] although brother Branham would get a gun
[1:37:34] and try to commit suicide
[1:37:37] the gun would fail
[1:37:39] it climb up the electric pole jerky's
[1:37:41] gloves off lay his hands over on The
[1:37:44] Wire
[1:37:45] and the angel of God must have been
[1:37:47] there to protect him
[1:37:49] because he come to himself at the bottom
[1:37:51] of the pole
[1:37:53] he thought he couldn't take it no more
[1:37:56] he thought he couldn't take it
[1:37:58] matter of fact I'll read it maybe in a
[1:38:00] week or so he said that stumbled me so
[1:38:03] bad
[1:38:04] why God would take him he said but then
[1:38:06] I saw some time after that and I saw my
[1:38:09] little Sharon beside that broken wagon
[1:38:13] a star is a beautiful young woman and
[1:38:16] then I realized if she would have lived
[1:38:20] something might have happened to her
[1:38:24] but now she's where nothing can ever
[1:38:26] happen to her
[1:38:28] so you see when God does things and we
[1:38:30] think I just don't understand I don't
[1:38:32] understand
[1:38:33] but we trust him even when we don't
[1:38:36] understand him
[1:38:38] let me loves him today with all your
[1:38:40] heart
[1:38:41] you want to trust him with all you are
[1:38:43] you want him to trust you
[1:38:46] it's about history
[1:38:53] beloved thinketh not strange
[1:38:56] concerning the fiery trial
[1:38:59] which is to try you
[1:39:01] as though some strange thing happened
[1:39:04] unto you
[1:39:08] Heavenly fathers we have our heads bowed
[1:39:11] today
[1:39:13] Lord God you know
[1:39:16] wherever person is today
[1:39:20] Lord I thought yesterday that I was
[1:39:23] ready but me and Carol around the house
[1:39:25] there a bit and doing some things
[1:39:29] just changed my direction
[1:39:32] completely and the way I thought I was
[1:39:34] going to go
[1:39:35] so I know this is Timely
[1:39:38] today
[1:39:39] father we
[1:39:41] desire that we can be faithful
[1:39:44] and true
[1:39:46] we know that Our Redeemer Lives
[1:39:50] for many of us most of us probably Satan
[1:39:53] has done come too late to tell us there
[1:39:56] is no God
[1:39:58] come too late to tell us that he don't
[1:40:00] move we've seen enough things among us
[1:40:02] my goodness
[1:40:03] we've seen more in our church than
[1:40:06] what's written in the entire book of
[1:40:07] Acts as far as things that you have done
[1:40:11] we thank you for that
[1:40:13] so it's come too late to tell us you
[1:40:15] don't move anymore
[1:40:17] but he tries to tell us
[1:40:19] you don't love us
[1:40:21] or you don't care for us as an
[1:40:23] individual or a man and his wife or a
[1:40:25] man in his family because they're going
[1:40:27] through such things
[1:40:29] some Lords struggles so hard with their
[1:40:31] finances and they just seem like they
[1:40:33] struggle and struggle and can never get
[1:40:35] ahead and if they do get a little bit
[1:40:37] ahead something will come up and set
[1:40:39] them back and they just back and forth
[1:40:41] and back and forth and they look at
[1:40:42] others around them being so blessed so
[1:40:45] financial and it just causes them a
[1:40:47] battle they just can't figure it out
[1:40:50] some Lord trusts you for healing in
[1:40:52] their body and they see others and know
[1:40:54] about others that get healed
[1:40:56] Lord we know the Hill People right here
[1:40:58] on the prayer line
[1:41:00] Lord that don't even believe this word
[1:41:03] dear God we know
[1:41:05] of ones that you touched and performed
[1:41:07] miracles for
[1:41:09] and yet some of your children
[1:41:11] come through with the same Faith believe
[1:41:13] it in the same hands laid on them
[1:41:16] and nothing's happened yet
[1:41:19] so it lets us know you're God you
[1:41:22] control it we don't
[1:41:24] so apparently you could not try some of
[1:41:28] these maybe weaker Christians
[1:41:31] to get Glory out of their life the way
[1:41:33] you can
[1:41:35] some of your mature ones father
[1:41:38] forgive us for complaining Lord and
[1:41:40] forgive us father
[1:41:43] whenever we question and doubt
[1:41:46] oh Lord we love you with all of our
[1:41:48] hearts as brother skip said it Lord the
[1:41:51] man said it well Lord I believe
[1:41:53] but help thou mine unbelief
[1:41:57] and that's what Satan tries to put on us
[1:42:00] we love you Jesus
[1:42:03] we worship you father
[1:42:06] we worship you today Lord God
[1:42:09] we bless your name Lord would you
[1:42:12] strengthen your children
[1:42:15] would you come father right now I pray
[1:42:18] in the name of Jesus to the sick to the
[1:42:21] weary
[1:42:22] Lord God may we as this assembly
[1:42:26] father have a greater burden and love
[1:42:28] for one another
[1:42:31] it reminds me Lord of people that Heaven
[1:42:34] their mind as I read it the other day
[1:42:38] and a person was liking it to people
[1:42:41] that are World Travelers and they
[1:42:42] they've been to France and they've been
[1:42:44] to Germany and they've been here and
[1:42:46] there and there
[1:42:48] and you hadn't had not even seen
[1:42:50] anything in the United States and said
[1:42:51] well the U.S is such an ugly place to
[1:42:53] live
[1:42:54] and yet people from France and Germany
[1:42:57] and everywhere else they've been are
[1:42:58] coming here to see it
[1:43:00] if we're not careful Lord will so get
[1:43:01] our vision out well let's let's go over
[1:43:04] to the hospital let's go over here to do
[1:43:06] that let's go over here and brothers and
[1:43:08] sisters in our own assembly hurting
[1:43:10] needing a friend
[1:43:11] needing someone to pray for them
[1:43:15] no wonder you told your apostles
[1:43:18] don't begin in Tarsus
[1:43:20] don't begin in Cappadocia
[1:43:23] but go to Jerusalem
[1:43:25] begin at home
[1:43:27] go to Jerusalem and go from there
[1:43:31] oh Jesus help us I pray father
[1:43:35] may we have a greater burden Lord
[1:43:38] for the brothers and sisters we go to
[1:43:40] church with
[1:43:41] Lord God our church family our our human
[1:43:45] family

[1:43:55] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:43:57] sing something for us Harry
[1:43:59] how many here today
[1:44:03] if God has a debate
[1:44:06] with Satan over you
[1:44:09] you want to be faithful to what God Said
[1:44:11] now remember God was the one who
[1:44:13] proclaimed I have confidence in him
[1:44:16] I know what he'll do I know he'll get
[1:44:18] low I know he'll get weary
[1:44:21] he'll curse the day was born
[1:44:23] he'll say why did it have to be said
[1:44:25] that there was a man child born why was
[1:44:27] it not in the morning hours that my
[1:44:29] mother did not pass me why did I have to
[1:44:33] come to the earth oh he got so miserable
[1:44:36] but God looked at the end he said I know
[1:44:38] my son
[1:44:40] I'm no job
[1:44:42] be strong children
[1:44:44] and the Lord and then the power
[1:44:47] of his might
[1:44:49] we will crest
[1:44:51] every wave
[1:44:53] we will come through every storm
[1:44:56] the Lord God
[1:44:58] will give us what we need
[1:45:00] he'll help you
[1:45:03] don't get weary
[1:45:07] he'll help us
[1:45:09] he'll be our stay
[1:45:12] and our strength
[1:45:13] you ever get that brother Donnie
[1:45:16] but I do
[1:45:19] but when it's all said and done and I
[1:45:20] get by myself

[1:45:24] I'm just so tired of preaching
[1:45:27] I've been preaching
[1:45:30] most all my life
[1:45:32] pastor
[1:45:33] over 40 years
[1:45:37] preaching longer than that
[1:45:39] I think I'm at the retirement age
[1:45:43] I guess
[1:45:44] maybe I could just
[1:45:46] retire
[1:45:48] just play the guitar here maybe or sing
[1:45:49] maybe I'll let me sing every now and
[1:45:51] then or something
[1:45:52] I say
[1:45:54] you labor for people and you pray for
[1:45:56] them
[1:45:59] they come to church when they want to
[1:46:00] come to church and they don't
[1:46:03] they'll turn their back on you just like
[1:46:04] that
[1:46:05] never even come and tell you how much
[1:46:07] they'll leave and go wherever never even
[1:46:10] pick up the phone and call you and tell
[1:46:12] you I appreciate all the labor you
[1:46:15] prayed me through to the Holy Ghost you

[1:47:46] little bit before we go let's just love
[1:47:48] it
[1:47:49] if God you found favor in his sight
[1:47:52] Erica told me probably seven eight
[1:47:54] months ago I sent her a quote from the
[1:47:56] victory dates tremendous service tape if
[1:47:58] you haven't listened to it in a while
[1:47:59] brother Bama said when you go through a
[1:48:01] trial it shows that you found favor in
[1:48:03] God's side
[1:48:04] she said Daddy
[1:48:06] I wouldn't mind a little bit if I didn't
[1:48:08] find so much favor
[1:48:11] I said I understand honey
[1:48:14] I understand
[1:48:16] you're praying for her aren't you I know
[1:48:18] you are
[1:48:19] every day I so appreciate that
[1:48:21] I don't know how we would have come
[1:48:23] through this trial
[1:48:24] if you all hadn't have helped us
[1:48:27] thank you for what you've done your
[1:48:28] prayers your concern I thank you so much
[1:48:32] I hear from people around the world

[1:48:38] this and that and praying for her thank
[1:48:41] you thank you so much we need one
[1:48:44] another but I don't want you to think
[1:48:46] she's the only one we pray for oh no
[1:48:49] there's many other needs in our church
[1:48:52] we don't want to just call Erica's name
[1:48:54] and say well the other a man and no
[1:48:56] brother the other day they're in Indiana
[1:48:57] and he said brother we pray for her
[1:48:58] every day and he said I got to be honest
[1:49:00] with you sometimes I don't remember her
[1:49:02] name but I'll say Lord you know who I'm
[1:49:04] talking about
[1:49:06] I said yes brother sometimes we have to
[1:49:08] do like the little boy
[1:49:10] that he was down praying on his knees
[1:49:13] praying and he was saying ABC a b c d e
[1:49:17] f g h i j k l m n o p
[1:49:20] somebody asked himself what are you
[1:49:22] doing he said well sometimes I don't
[1:49:24] know what to say so I just say the
[1:49:26] alphabet and let God put it together
[1:49:29] I hope we never get so deep and think we
[1:49:32] know so much that we Overlook those
[1:49:34] simple things or say but my prayer what
[1:49:37] would it do
[1:49:38] it might be your prayer that will climax
[1:49:41] Erica's healing
[1:49:45] the Lord laid it on his sister's heart
[1:49:47] here a few weeks ago she come to Carol
[1:49:49] out your service said I've got to go

[1:49:52] think I'm crazy he said okay she said
[1:49:54] wash shorts all right
[1:49:55] I don't care whose prayer God heals
[1:49:58] hears if I'm going through something I
[1:50:01] don't care if it's a kid if it's one of
[1:50:02] these little boys that prays for me and
[1:50:05] gone answers my prayer do you think I
[1:50:07] care who it is
