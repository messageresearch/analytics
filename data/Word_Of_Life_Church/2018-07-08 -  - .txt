realized we're living in an age when many of the lay of decisions want to worship but not many m-1 obey I don't only want to worship Him but I want to obey Him as I realize true obedience is what really leads to divine worship Sartain glad to be together tonight in the presence of God what a privilege it is for us Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse 4 that I hear brother already praying again no they are God bless you brothers just roberson my baby with us again tonight I love that accent don't you hope y'all been enjoying your visit around the states and different places sorry nice to see you again before you head home song on Solomon chapter 5 verse 4 this is quite a book the Song of Solomon it's a little book as far as chapters and verses but it's a big book when it comes to the mysteries that it contains my beloved put his hand by the hole of the door and my bowels were moved for him I rose up to open to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrrh in my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the log i opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake i sought him but I could not find him I called him but he gave me no answer for the of you tonight that are filled with the Holy Ghost verse six is one of the most devastating things that can happen in the life of a believer losing a mother losing a father losing a child things like that in the natural sense are terrible truly terrible but to know that our soul failed whenever he knocked and we did not respond there can be no greater disappointment to a real believer now realize the majority the world even the jarda christians don't even understand this they can't even relate to it at all because they don't feel the way the bride feels about him but listen to this again I opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself now notice she doesn't change her claim upon him as far as who he is she's still bride and he's still her beloved she's still elect she's still called and chosen she said open to my beloved and my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake I sought him but I could not find him I called him but he gave me no answer now we're going into the time of the silence into the time when before she could not take correction one thing I loved about the Lord he will always correct his children but not always when you've done the wrong you say God knows sometimes when we do wrong that we are so low and so despondent that we cannot take the measure of correction that we need right then so he'll kind of let you go for a little bit and wait till you get to feeling better then they'll turn you over and his knee and wear you out but that's still grace because it if people to wore you out maybe when you were so down it or drove you over the edge you tell them that love a man don't you appreciate his grace to us let's bow our heads tonight Heavenly Father we are grateful for such a wonderful loving father Lord Jesus we ask you tonight that you would come supernaturally take this word and speak to his father we are not ashamed to say that our needs are many but we are not also ashamed to say our God is greater than all the needs that we could muster up around the world if every individual in the face of the Earth's tonight billions and billions of people if every one of them had billions of needs and we would multiply the billions of people down the billions of needs and you would answer and take care of every one of them it would barely even touch your power so we know Lord your power is as great as it ever was your healing your deliverance all that you have all that you are so we pray to not follow that it should come and speak to us from your word help me that I can get out of the way and help the people that they can get out of the way Lord that we can be able to receive from You Lord Jesus were just asking that the presence of God would come and so arrest our thoughts as it were may we be so captivated by the presence of our loving Lord Jesus that will be changed people when we leave you tonight granted I pray Lord in Jesus name and the same said I'd like to say that someone's had a birthday today special person Harry I sent him a text this morning and said 55 and alive it can be seated god bless you the Lewis's having birthdays is much better than the other option so he does have a point on him I want to speak to you tonight from these verses of Scripture on I opened but he was gone I opened but he was gone it's amazing to me the element that remains the human element that remains despite the revelation of the supernatural birth that has taken place in the elect of God something so profound in the lives and the souls of the people of God that the scripture would call you and I a new creature in Christ Jesus a new creation a new being that's been made brand-new something that was not patched up something that wasn't kind of throw together new and old and wore out and this and that but totally transformed and made new and yet how could a person like that ever wind up refusing or turning down a personal call when the Lord Jesus would knock at our heart now this could be for a time of weeks this type of delay could be for months it could be for hours it could be for a day or so but whether it's for an hour or a day or a week or a month or a prolonged call the in result is going to be the same because every believer who has been germanized by the Spirit of God the beloved of their soul is Christ Jesus as a matter of fact he is the fairest of ten thousand to them he's he's everything but the truth of the matter is he is not everything to their body because their flesh still thirst after the things that satisfy the flesh now because God has made us this new creature this is what instills this ability to be able to love him like no other people can love it now I realize when I talk this way that it's not for everyone I don't want to say this but I've got to say it to be honest it's not for everybody in our church it's not even for everybody that says they believe God sent a prophet the kind of love that I want to bring to you tonight and tomorrow is only for the elect it is only for those who actually have become in rapture you see the rapture is not just an event but the rapture is a move a consummation of something that has already started in the lives of those who are already raptured those who have not had a rapture will not experience the rapture and those who have had a rapture will experience the rapture so if you're worried about missing the rapture don't worry about it no more if you've already been raptured in him now when I say that I'm not talking about just well I let aside this habit that habit I'm talking about your soul being so enraptured in the person of the Lord Jesus that you you are so moved by his being that there is absolutely nothing in this swirl that moves you like he does now I'm not saying that you don't enjoy things you go on a picnic and you do this and that in there that I'm talking about that but there is nothing that moves you like he does if there's any if Jesus has any rivals in your life you have not yet experienced a rapture that's right because if you ever do he has no competition there are no rivals to the soul once you are truly born again now watch this illusion here that that we have in the Song of Solomon is we looked at it's Sunday was that there was unlike this type of door lock on the latches on our door that it was actually as the term uses it was a latch and there was a hole in the door that would be either above or it beneath the latch which would go this way and beneath it would be a hole which only ahem size should be able to slip through and the person on the other side had the capability of locking this where it would not swing back and forth but the bride had at least left this part of it open so he runs his hand to the hole in the door and he moves a little thing over to the side and he reaches his hand through and when he does to raise the latch all but alas he finds that she has locked the latch itself so that his hand cannot be able to release his now remember they are married they are not courting they are not dating as we would say but they are married he has called her his sister his spouse his beloved she has already been been with him so they are married so what is she doing with a door locked against him anyway and you look at our lives especially in this latest seein time frame how the jobs in business and so many things can be M to lock the intimacy of the Lord Jesus out of our lives you you many of you never ever ever locked him out of your life when it comes to being Savior actually you have been saved not if you have locked him out there part if you've got the Holy Ghost don't get that in your mind that is what I'm talking about but notice where he's coming into he's not approaching her in the kitchen he's not approaching her in the living room he is approaching her in the bedroom where she is now retired and resting so here is the third room here is the Holy of Holies here is soma the most intimate place that he could find her and what he goes to finding her in the most intimate part of her being that is where she shuts him out she does not shut him out as being Savior all of well to see us Christians do not shut him out as far as being Savior because none of them want to be lost none of them want to go to hell so they do not shut him out of the kitchen many of them will shut him out when it comes to the living room because they don't want his uh you know its moves toward her and all of that but yet meaning it will go on and they will accept that but ultimately every one of them other than the elect will shut him out when it comes to the bedroom now the difference is that the bride in the beginning initially let him come into her but this is now actually they've already become married now most of you know if you've been say very long it's that day to day walk is where we slip up with God and Happy Valley said and the visitor said thank you visitors now that's the difficult part of our walk with God is being able to keep that fire burning that flame going that passion burning it's the same way with the marriage when a man and woman first get married if they've got any speck of love at all I'm sure they can live on love for a while and their lives but a day or two but outro wow you know you got a pancake and corn and means and taters and all the rest that sort of thing and then the man will start bolting in the door for his life and he'll stop doing those things that he done candy that's a thing of the past roses whoever heard of roses that you've been married for five or ten years so those things and then the woman will start reciprocating and pulling back from him the things that she did for him initially and that's what causes many marriages to suffer and it's the same way spiritually with the Lord Jesus that one were first saved on mine we love the Lord we love our Bible we love the tapes we love going to the house of God we love all those things but then answer while it becomes so awhile you know my goodness we've got church three times a week well on the world do I need to go all three times I mean why do I need to read my Bible every day and why do I need to do this and that and the other you don't have to know it's entirely up to you but it's up to you whether or not you want that intimate part that I'm talking about now if you want a Jesus that only meets you in the kitchen that's entirely up to you and he is a merciful God he will meet you in the kitchen if that's all you give him he will take that but for me on my house I don't want a kitchen Jesus I don't want just to live in rooms Jesus I want a whole house Jesus I don't want nothing in my closet I know one that's it in my bedroom nothing upstairs nothing in the basement I don't want nothing nowhere that Jesus can't feel welcome within my house right I want to be able to live for and answer them have every avenue of my life and I want him to be able to be intimate when I speak of that I mean by divine revelation of him pressing himself in my soul and entering into my soul with that mysterious part which only he contains now Satan has a certain element of the knowledge of salvation many of each preacher stand up and they'll preach it all the time but they never enter into the intimate part that the Lord Jesus reserves only for his queen and that is of course the elect of God now then this is the part that we want to look at the intimate part of our lives of us being Christian totally sold out to the Lord so in love the Lord Jesus that trials come trials go sickness calms sickness kills all kinds of things come and go but yet your soul is so tied in with God nothing moves you now your flesh may get where your spirit may get weary but down inside that so you have the tie posts and the anchor and you can no more perish than God Himself compares and the very design of sin has lets you you have no more desire to go out and commit adultery and run around and live the way you live because that old man is dead and you've got a new king living on the throne of your heart praise the Lord since now the illusion then that we want to look at is the intimacy of the daily wall that can become so difficult for us to keep now notice what she says in verse 6 I open to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself now all of this is timed exactly right even in the Avenue by which he will now correct her now he's going to enjoy himself he may have heard a rise he may have heard the pitter-patter of her feet he may have heard exactly what was going on and he chooses this time even though it seems an opportune to her but he knows it is exactly the right time now she must feel the disciplinary action of her rejected husband now none of a slight discipline I know that but yet every one of us absolutely need it and if your son and daughter of God you'll accept it and say man thank you Lord for giving it to me if your bastard born you'll hate it and you'll like the preacher brings it to you praise the Lord now she says I opened to my beloved and that this is exactly what he desired this is what he wanted her to do but she missed the window or the timeframe by which he stood there now the His grace was there and maybe he knocked and she heard and she's kind of sweep in and out of sleep I remember she said that she'd went to sleep and it's like this is sort of like a dream so she's coming in and out and conscious you now we all whenever we're sleep and waking all of a sudden and we don't know where we are and so this is sort of the way she was that she was coming out of that unconscious or subconscious first conscious coming together her alertness is now coming but she's able to recognize and know that it's him so it's not actually said well who's there hello hello who's at the door who's at the door but there was enough signs and enough sense to let her know that it was him because she smelled the myrrh which was particular to him and she also smelled the fine myrrh which was dripping from his fingers which was also particular to him so it was not like she's lying I get away from my door I don't know who you are are you a burglar or you were safer your robber there's no question who was at the door so lets us know them that's there to gain entrance into her room into their room I should say that he had already had access into the house so she was not alarm she was not concerned I don't know who this is I'm hood yes but there were several things that let her know it was him all children I would to God we can look around and recognize it is here in our midst it is he that is keeping his elect and this in time all the signs are pointing to everything but I'm not just focusing out there although looking at the Supreme Court's ruling or looking at their earthquakes we're looking at all of this now the other but I'll tell what I'm looking at I'm looking for that hole in the door and I'm smelling that sweet smelling savor I smell the stench of Sodom but what I want to smell more than the stench of father I want to smell the more of my Lord Jesus I want to smell his presence being near me hey man Oh hallelujah now what she comes to the heartbreaking realization that her beloved had withdrawn himself this withdrawing is going to serve his purpose to chastise her for her soft fulness and I realize a lot of us want to have the conception and our mind that we can sing and do whatever we want to do then we ask God to forgive us God takes his blood and wipes it all clean and it's all said now but remember when you do wrong you sow seeds now God will forgive you but God ain't gonna go out there in your garden and dig up the seeds that you planted if you don't want no bad seats to be there don't so um oh my come on children don't get quiet on me now whenever we do wrong Abraham done wrong and Abraham paid what days are done wrong David paid come on and they were the elect of God when Peter done wrong Peter paid when you don't wrong you'll pay well God will forgive you that's right but forgiveness is a total different concept than reaping and sowing that is a law of God as well as the law of forgiveness and whenever we saw even though God forgiveness you know go out those I said and take all the seeds up out of the ground so the best thing that he was so good seeds let all them bad seeds rain on the devil now notice here she comes into this this time to where that she's happened she stirred herself and she's aroused and she's awakened and she's gone open the door and she find that her beloved house was drawn himself she said I opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone now notice how that even the elect of God can turn down the intimacy of our Lord now he's not she's not lost she is not slid in the sensor back out in the world drinkin running around smoking cigarettes and all that sort of thing no she's not that but he simply was drawn himself from the position that he offered her because of her refusal and now she must enter into this time in her heart and in her soul to where she feels so bad because of what she done you know how blessed you are you understand how blessed you are in this age of reprobates that if you do something wrong or say something wrong or think something wrong you know how blessed you are to still feel bad for that do you realize we're living in a world when millions of people have been turned over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are abomination abomination the eyes of God and will bring damnation to their soul and they feel no wrong annoyance you realize how blessed we are tonight if we say one little same out of the way or if we raise our voices so whatever more and we feel so convicted in our heart you out of dance and shout when you still have conviction to know you are blessed of God that you don't have a reprobate mind reprobates don't feel bad about committing sin and abominations in the eyes of the Lord oh ma I want you to notice how she addresses this and she goes to the very core of the problem she says my soul failed my soul failed when he spake now what did he say open to me my sister my spouse my beloved now had she been in a dream totally unconscious she would have not been held accountable but there was enough about her there was conscience to know it was him so now she's looking back and realizing I've done wrong I was awake enough I knew better than to do this now this is the real breath the real body said well I'm elect I can do what I want to you sound like a reprobate I can sing I can do whatever I want God loves me so much he'll let me do it I don't want that kind of love from God myself I want the kind of life from God that if I do wrong he worries me l he forgives me and he wears me out and he corrects me you're crazy well I may be but that is scriptural it is bastard some illegitimate that he don't correct not sons now how sadly she recognizes that she has now slighted and neglected him I remember he's not divorcing her he's not putting her away nor is she going to be foolish enough to try to divorce self but what she's dealing with is recognizing the neglect then the glider she's been so busy with the things of life the things around her and the things of everyday business and jobs and this and that and the other and now she's dealing with the idea of her neglect was so severe that she never even comprehended it apparently before this thing is getting ahold to me it is changing me this thing that I think well I've got to do this and I've got to do that and I've got to go somewhere else God understands when I miss Church God understands that I can't pray God understands that I can't read my Bible no God don't God tells us in his words the things to get closer to God it's very simple read our Bible and pray how awful once a week every day oh look at her she says my soul failed when he spake now the very next step is I salt him don't you notice what she's now looking for it's the bridegroom himself which shows that she's moved beyond the Pentecostal age now we believe in gifts we believe in justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost but now by the gym she's been allowed to enter into the bedroom she has been with him before in this room so now she is not seeking or look for tongues and a confounded and I look for miracles and I can find it but notice what she was seeking after I sought him look friends I love visions I love dreams all of tongues I had those experiences myself and I thank God for but I'll tell one thing I'm not searching that your gifts I want him I want him I want the person of the world by the road that will make his world what about the Donnie you've been safe for all these years and you say you've got the Holy Ghost how much more could you get how wonder how little that I understand I don't look at how much I've got and saying well how could I get any more but the more I comprehend about him the more it makes me understand how little I have and how much more there is for me to attain to and if you feel like you've got so much and you have no more question how much you do have it shows you have very very little if you feel like in this mortal life you have attained to such an awesome God Oh hallelujah oh my she says I saw him I saw him but I could not find him then it amazing when she realized she missed him she went to church Lord she's seeking him well let me ask you some now if you were satiny and you're seeking for Jesus would you go down to the bar tonight you want to go to the honky Tonk place of this place or there's prostitutes or some content would you go on down and didn't tell the madam whoever's in charge I'm looking for Jesus or you will find Jesus sir go to the bartender sir I'm looking for Jesus have you served in anything lately I'm looking for Jesus if you're looking for Jesus you've got a word and go where Jesus is now God can save people in a bar we know God can do all that sort of sight but Jesus doesn't frequent bar rooms come on Church Jesus is why he said whether there are two or three gathered together in my name which leaves out the prostitute house which leaves out the barroom works leaves out the honky Tonk which leaves out most of the places of entertainment the people like to go to on Saturday night but Jesus said whether that's two or three gathered together in my name I will be in their midst so if she saw them a little she had to know where to find him would she go church house of God under the Ministry of the word to find him even if you're not where you need to be with an ID but God or you love shout that into the place and your walk with God you have come to the right place [Applause] it's not special cuz we're here that's special cause he's here all glory he was draws now she's awake she's fully conscious she needs correction she can now appreciate and accept discipline if he would have ministered this beforehand it would have been so discourage discouraging to her a matter for the handler many times you may look at the church and you look and he says situational anything wonder why brother Donna you doing this I wonder why brother don't eat doing that we see many times as a shepherd there's things I know about the situation that you don't know and if I administer the correction that is needed at the time you think it needs to be it'll push that individual right out them church doors and if I wait for God to give me the right time then it'll be exactly what it's supposed to be look at him I know sir he does you the same way why would you have a problem of him doing somebody else up there how many times have we been so down and basically we needed a rebuke but instead of a review we got loving arms around us we got loving arms foot around us from the Lord what's he doing now does that mean you're not going to get to rebuke no he's gonna hurt you were you well heaven then he's gonna wear you out now once what happens to her you know it's amazing that whenever we get in trouble the things that happen now this set that we're fixing to read it's absolutely self-inflicted the watchman that what about the city found me they smoked me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me every step of verse seven his self inflicted she's not being beaten for the glory of God she's not suffering for the glory of God all of this is really gonna add your testimony is it she's making her testimony her testimony to say what God don't need verse seven in our life to make her testimony we are reaping when we lived here for seven friends oh you're getting quiet on me again was it God orchestrating this in her life absolutely not this makes me sick when I hear people in their disobedience and they quit playing quit going to church put read in the Bible get away from God and get to life an office mess ever was well god let me go don't you blame that on my daddy she cannot blame their songs on father and say well God must have ordained that God never ordained her to be treated this way she done this herself I've had a lot of verse sevens in my life and I'll go ahead and said for most of you most of us had a lot of verse sevens in your life we don't like to brag about it we're ashamed of it which is good I'm glad we are ashamed because that means that we receive the correction and we recognize you know what we didn't have to have that in our life many of the things that some of you are going through even to this day it's because you brought it on yourself you fail to respond to him when he knocked on your hearts door maybe the Lord in order to Vincent preached or your pastor whoever and warns you about a certain thing don't do this and don't do that you kept right on going over the top of it anyhow and then listen and sitting here to pay into this day because of your neglect oh my remember the darling paying for your slothfulness but listen to me just because you disobey don't mean you're not bribed just because you get in verse 7 don't mean you're not a left is another verse that perceived all hallelujah that's what I want to keep on churning if I fail and I go through first seven and I go through verse eight I'm on my way on down I will not be stopped by my own failures I want you to notice where she goes she goes to the city what you doing in the city Brad what are you doing looking for him out there you ought to know where to find him at you ought to know where to find him go to his house now don't you notice how this reads the watchman that went about the city found them now there was two types of watchmen in the ancient cities and one of them was the ones that went about the city walking around going around from gate to gate and they was not posted in any particular place so they would go about and just check what was going on the streets the alleys the entrance to the gates and just watching for anything going on and then there was another set of watchmen which would be posted to a particular post they would watch that post and they might walk back and forth but it's a very small limited area so here she is she goes out and she begins to move over let's say she visits a soccer game first and then she goes through then she goes to a basketball game and then she goes over here and there now now I'm not saying those things are wrong with himself but it's what you can make out of them it's a basketball game wrong well no I wouldn't say the basketball game within itself is wrong unless you become intoxicated with basketball then if you become intoxicated with and it becomes your God then it's a beggar God than the Lord Jesus amen brother Donnie fishing anything else can become exactly the same way so what is she doing now now she's entering into the disciplinary action that God did not orchestrate but God did allow God never our doing this god never predestinated this God never even wounded it oh ma so the watzmann that went about the city found there they smoked me so they're taking her first streetwalker decent women should be in the bid that this time what are you doing woman out walking around you're looking for business now can you imagine the slurs and the things that they must have said to her can you think in your heart how you would have felt if you would have been called some of those dirty filthy names yes that's not who you were at all but that's the image that you were projecting you should have been in home and bad you shouldn't be out there walking around when the street prostitutes is out looking for me in come on children look at the identity that she brought on herself and when we become so called up of the world and the things of the world and we're bringing that identity upon ourselves and then people look at you are you a Christian or you say do you believe this do you believe that oh I can't believe well what do you expect if you're Akhtar Walter and what the Hobbs if somebody thinks you're one I'll tell one thing even if you get mad on angel's wings that's gonna be hard to tell them from an old pig snout [Music] and all bad on old Bassem bird I'll tell you once they get harder swings eagle's wings angel's wings you don't sit out down it's gonna be really hard that's why we need to keep ourselves from all this filth out here Laodicea not only keep ourselves from it but keep ourselves from bringing it inside our own church oh ma she said the watzmann that what about the city found me they smoked me they wounded me the keepers of the walls and here's the second category of watzmann now she gets away for these guys the ones who's walked him about now your she comes she's been hit meat kit blood all over stomped and they finally let her go and when they do she makes it over to these guys that are assigned a certain post and they look at him said what are you doing I got a woman you streetwalkers we don't allow this in our city you get back to your house you lowdown sorry say you're not set to kill that was not the truth but but the way she acted they mistook her for a legacy in church member hallelujah now watch he says the keepers of the wall they took away my veil from now the other men that alive can make fun of her and ridicule so what are you doing with the veil you're kinda long veil oh but I'm clean I'm pure sure you are that's why you're out here this time of the morning sure you are that's why you're here walking around looking for some man are you looking for some man well yes I am say no but simply shut up but these first Watchmen lift her veil so she comes up to the guys who go back and forth on the walls she said the keepers of the walls took away my veil the veil was the ornament of her gender being a woman being a pure woman now harlots wore veils but they were known by their veil as well they wore a particular type of veil remember Tamar whenever she takes out for certain clothes and then she veils herself in Canaanite dress but there was a certain type of veil that the prostitutes used to make themselves more seductive and to make themselves more alluring and they would hide their eyes in a certain way and they would paint their eyes in a certain way and they would take stimulants and make the eye look real real big which the Canaanites thought was very beautiful so they would make the eyes look really really large then they would be said in the white most of them with dark eyes and the wide around the eyeball and it would make the eye look real alluring so they leave her veil but when she comes up to these men they actually take her veil what's what did she get the veil she got it from her beloved she got it from her beloved it was him who gave her that veil and they took it away because he was letting her go through a trial because he was letting her go through a test every bit of this is self-inflicted oh ma I know this type of person will make us happy but hope he'll make us ready this veil was a badge of her modesty now when they take that badge away from her look in Genesis 24 65 for she had said unto the servant what man is this that woke us in the Fila this is Rebekah that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself now in the presence of Eliezer on this camel train going back she did not feel like she needed it but she's gonna come into the presence of the man that she's going to marry so she takes her veil and covers herself she will wear this veil of course in his presence they will go into the marriage tent he was in remove the veil showing that she has moved underneath his headship then he would take that veil and let over on his shoulder and show by a sign that he assumed full responsibility of that woman so she kept herself from other men not being touched by other men and the outward show was her closing amen and the album identity was a certain type of a veil which an unmarried had praise be to God tell me tell me why is it in the animal kingdom or the bird Kingdom amphibian kingdom or reptile kingdom tell me why there is no female among them that has the little virgin veil tell me why it is only in the human race tell me why it's in the human race God please sit there for that sacred trust hallelujah and listen little bride the Lord Jesus has watched you and cleanse you and sanctifies you and given you a veil of his protection of the word don't you get out here in the world don't you get out your mom the lettuce in watts keepers and watchtower man and let them steal your modesty away from you and steal that for charity what's Christ Jesus restores you to [Applause] so they tear the veil off Wow so the veil wrapped around their hair and their face they want to know who are these people they probably already know us but I figure they're gonna find this out a little bit more clear as we go on they passed a few more laws of this and that and the other make us breaking the law because we won't accept what society says what society has identified as marriage I'll tell you one thing I'll marry any gay couple in the world in the entire world if you can show me where God ever married case show me what God said they should be married fine show me what the Word of God gives any outline how a woman should treat her life show me any outline in the scripture how a man should treat his husband I know one thing that was one wedding that my father cut him that my father did he did it in the Garden of Eden a wasn't to women and wasn't to men it was a man and a woman that's the only one that we know of in history that he ever done he gave us that example because that's the right example show me work native of almería to [Applause] well you say that cause you're a religious fanatic and if you don't believe it's your devil fanatic I'm a fan for Jesus in these words you're a fan for the devil praise the Lord and get my virgin veil and get me to comprehend I'm gonna bury my head under the sand I don't care what laws they pass I don't care what they try to do to us whenever they go to pressing against you you remember no prophets that they'll come against her and they'll try to shut her out but they'll never shut her up he'll take her up so go ahead Sodom press against us God precedence it means our body changes right at the door it means our body friends this is why we need to make sure everything that's right in our lives oh ma now watch her here she staggers back out and she runs into some more people were st. I charge you o daughters of Jerusalem if you find my beloved that you tell him I'm sick of love now look how low she is she is so low she's looking to people beneath her to try to find help they've never even known the king the way she has but now she's so low that she's looking beneath her own integrity and her own character I say you shouldn't go to a Pentecostal church or a Baptist Church no God no you want to go go right ahead but to think that them folks have the message of the hour I charge you old daughters of Jerusalem if you find my beloved now notice she still does not make him their beloved notice noise she said I told you those are Jerusalem if you find your beloved but if you find marble so they're gonna find him before you do and they're gonna tell him your need when they don't even understand him the way you understand it when you do wrong you need to come back the right way come on children and the way of divine approach is still God's nature remember the Prophet tells us the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God so in order to make reconciliation and to come back to the divine approach we've got to come back through the way that God has let us come through so if you fall from this element of light how can you ever go back down to this degree of light and try to find him up here and you down there come back to where you left him at now notice she says tell him that I am sick of love now the English the way this words and it seems as if though she's saying I'm sick of your love I don't know more of it but actually what she's saying is I'm sick because I don't have it I'm sick not because I've had so much but I'm sick because I'm missing it you realize the elect are never perfectly at ease except in the presence of the king this is why whether you're at home praying reading your Bible on the job or in mainly in church cause more licks to the far gather together that's why there can be such a calm that enters into our souls that is beyond explanation there can be such a rest such a satisfaction I mean those who I'm talking about why because you come into the courts of the King and do you have an element of that home certainly you do but look at how many more licks afar you have gathered here on this place to not to just you by yourself or me by myself so as we enter into the nearness of the king the Bliss of heaven begins to emanate from His divine presence and that divine presence is there - what it is the bread of his face which is pawneean which is the very character of God so on his prey his face phrase comes through his manifestation as she says and behold his cheeks and she said his cheeks is as the bear of flowers and spices because the cheeks protruding out from the face and the face representing his divine presence and because of that why brings that something inside of us I don't care how much you love fishing how much you love hunting everything else nothing else can ever produce that kind of satisfaction in your soul it's totally impossible aren't you glad you know that's the truth you see the nearer to him that we get the nearer we enter into the calm of heaven and the peace of heaven and the Bliss of heaven oh praise God no wonder when I get in his presence I don't care if I ever leave or not I know some of y'all are excited in the service you want to go eat you want to go to Dairy Queen let me tell you one thing I dismiss early for your sakes I said here Wednesday night I took a fall Wednesday morning couldn't even we couldn't even walk laid on my driveway my back busted all up I didn't think off the Lord Jesus please help now stretch it winds I thought Lord if I can get it on I'll be all right there anointing come down I felt like a sixteen year old boy I wouldn't care if would stay here till midnight because I knew when that anointing left me left he unless he healed me I was going to be crippling back there sure enough I was after church there's something about being in his presence there's something about being in the saints of God that's a wonderful my minister but all brother system when we get in the presence of the King it changes everything it turns around our thoughts it eradicate things sister always may return the troubles may come back but my how that belief sister hmm what's this they're looking person now the daughters of Jerusalem they actually recognize they don't have the bride's place and they ask earnest she asked them said if you see my brother tell him that I'm sick of love and telling that I'm wanting him when I need him so bad and then the dollars of Joseph turned back around a verse 9 and say what is that beloved more than another beloved now what you notice the way they view it they view it that Jesus is not the only beloved Lord here we separate the bride from the church now they do they do acknowledge and recognize that she is different from them and they say what is cyber the not our not our that we shared joint feeling a joint communion with them but what is your beloved more than any other beloved as if though Jesus is one among three or one among many but to the bride he's not one of three he's all three and one [Laughter] you see everybody has a beloved or more than one but everybody has at least one thing in your life that is your beloved it can be your car it can be you your soul a high opinionated so self-opinionated you always express everything I me me me my my mind will most most more than likely your beloved is yourself some function beloved is at work it's the house it's their job that you know can be many many things and the daughters of Jerusalem recognize that Jesus is a beloved but that he's not the only beloved but they know I'm talking to her she's already weird and strange anyway so they're asking her why is he so much more than everything else to you yes sir my brother's sister she has not yet entered into his presence but the culmination of restoration is right on the verge of her own mouth she is going to talk her way right into restoration and that position is in Lord of Mercy she's gonna walk right back into his presence of chapter 6 verse 1 and how she gonna do it he's gonna bless her way right out of trouble she's gonna blow us all away right out of the valley that she's in and how she gonna do it Lord gave me a new Cadillac Lord gave me a new her BMW Lord give me this she is gonna bless his name right out of failure she is gonna bless his name right out of disappointment she's gonna praise her way right out of this trial not talking about how great she is or how great the preacher is but she's gonna talk about jesus himself and she's gonna walk right out of it by bragging on her beloved now tell one thing unless you want a sermon don't ask the bride this question what is thy beloved more that another bit of it thou fairest what is a beloved more than another beloved notice they emphasize it twice you're asking for now daughters of Jerusalem that thou does so charge what can become the chief object of people's love money science education music fashion on and on and on and on we could go now wants you to think music you can become soul addicted to music music is a great administration we know if it's the right kind but do you know that music is dead in the sense of you telling music I love that music and that music turning right back around and say and I love you I know I know you folks take your iPhone and you tell Siri I love you and Syria tells you back I love you but it don't love you at Kate love it's dead science you can get so engrossed or I love science I love sign but it's one science book ever answered you back and I love you you're so dear to me you're so precious to me why these are dead beloved's now money people love money whole my lady rethinking everything for money what did they go to I love money I live mine LM minute gotta have more more more more more more MORE but it's $100 bill ever as George Washington ever come out $500 bill or the fives and Lincoln's and all their and ever just smacked you a big ol smile right on the John said I love you too so your beloved is dead and before long you'll find out in this nation how worthless that it really is so your beloved will be taken away from you before long come on out don't you look at music you look at literature you look at education as your education ever encourage you when you were down on the dumps and your college degree all that I'm not against any of that but don't let that be your beloved let it be a tool that you use in this age but you better make sure your beloved can answer you back oh and I'm not just talking about a human force many people can say I love you I love you I'm talking about one that could answer you back Wes eternal life [Applause] friends don't you see why the Lord Jesus deserves a warmer more committed love than money science education civilization Jesus can love back you tell him you love him he told you before you was born I love you I love you this much I'll give my life for your education King do your PhD your lld whatever more degrees that you have use those things as tools your jacquimo bill your home as tools use them as tools use them they're the things of life but don't make them your beloved your house cannot put its arms around you and how do you close you don't have arms your job your boss many of those things in your life that you make a beloved all but Jesus the beloved he can embrace you he can put his arms around you when you're down he can forgive you when you've fallen short of his glory why he is the beloved with feelings the beloved with reality in eternal life so when you get a hundred dollar bill and you smile at it have you ever seen one smile back at you I mean if you get a hundred dollar bill you have to break it you know this and you break him guys I mean enough they're gone in two three days you think oh you're gonna hold on to them as long as you can't go Sue's you break em they're gone and you say oh that will build over roll their mouths back at you all I'll be out of there affording them done that to me Wow it's dead then why would I want to commit my life to something that could not love me they cannot help me if money should satisfy and fame and fortune that not these millionaires and rock stars and famous movie stars and these people that commit suicide and take their life that makes them sense if fame and fortune and riches for the mic and all that satisfies a person they should never they should live forever never never never never they should be the happiest people in the world they should open colleges for happiness and they should open all kinds of things to be able to teach people but they themself are looking for something why what they have made their beloved cannot smile back at them and when they come off the stage and they have to have something to shoot them up and something to shoot them down and they've got to have more money and more that's another why because their beloved could not die for them their beloved cannot heal them when they're sick their beloved cannot reach down and take a hold of an old Depression spirit and drive it away from them it'll only make more but sure but if one is your beloved more than money what is your beloved more than science because science will scientifically prove something this week and then if time Terry's in ten years have come back and said all we was wrong we scientifically disproved that theory so I guess I lost my beloved with a new scientific experiment in a laboratory come on and your favorite music oh my that you just love so much whatever it is that you make your beloved that's dead so I askew us are colossal so you tell me what is your benefit more than Jack Daniels what is your beloved more than pills and marijuana and politics because marijuana pills and politics can make you say [Music] because you take your pills and then you come down and then you got to have them over the next day and more the next day smoke your marijuana or it may take you out somewhere and produce all kinds of elucidation and when you come back you got to have more if you got more peace in what you had you're worse off than you was so your beloved is dead hallelujah but what is my beloved I do never the Prince of Peace the giver of life the forgiver of sins the partner of iniquities the healer of sickness is the razor from the dead the resurrection my first my last mile from my Omega but how about you know that preacher you ain't never smoked marijuana you're out of heaven you've never been how oh I wouldn't say that now I've been pretty high I've soared heard oh my sword where marijuana can't take it I'm sword in heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh I'm gonna come back down I didn't have a hangover and didn't have to use my babies no money to buy but I found out there's more where that come from it's free from the ask all the gods why because it is alive that's what my beloved is [Applause] as we leave this place tonight let us go with this in our hearts what is thy beloved more than another beloved all thou fairest among women what is thy beloved more than another beloved that thou are Justice so we can tell that you really believe this we can tell that you actually do but we don't understand it in verse 10 she begins to answer him and I'll just give you a little appetizer for in the morning she said my beloved is white and ruddy the chiefest among ten thousands so my beloved is white and red to be continued [Music] what a way to answer people when they're asking you the profoundness of your beloved and you say my beloved is red and white and they're probably centered looking thin what y'all looking at me okay the Lord willing will understand it better bye bye so of all the compliments that you want to answer and you answer this first your call to give an answer to these people and this is going to be your first disclosure of his character and who he is your beloved is white and red for duty is red I'm trying to just lead you on and lead you on and for you I better watch it though you'll pull me on over once you don't you love him children now really you're the only one that can answer this question that I'm going to ask you're the only one that can say it's Jesus really the beloved of your life is he the beloved of your life you have other things to do of course I know the things to pull on your time but is he your beloved your true beloved can you go a day without speaking to myself I can't go I can't go hours apart without speaking to him yes I knew you was net so now you know for sure that I am I wouldn't I wouldn't homer speak time I want to just speak to him whenever you call me but the don t pray for me this is happening that Sam I don't want it just him to feel like he's a Sears & Roebuck harmony house and I've come to play somehow order I don't want to go to him and I ain't got no needs I want to go to him and none of you ain't called me in the last 15 or 20 minutes pray for this pray for that pray for this I want to go to him just to say I love you I want you to know I love you I love you I'm getting prepared myself for city life now I'm a country boy okay born in the country raised in the country I know I live in the Johnson cities city limits but I'm still a country boy but I am going through daily preparation for city life I'm fixing to move to a city to work constantly it will be praise adoration love constant fellowship and communion with our Lord Jesus praise the Lord I'm getting ready for city life not realize everybody's not a city person that's why they come to church once a week and they're pretty well tells you about their church attendance where they live outside the city if you could come to church three times a week and only choose to come once that shows you're not ready for the rapture because you are putting what you think above what God said God said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and that much more as we see the Day approaching but if you exalt your on the pen well I don't think I need to I already don't think well that's you taking your opinion above God's Word but I'm getting ready for city life what would you want to do in the city if you only come to church once a week because it proves you don't love his presence that much sure you'd be here every time you could well now you think about it I've done right yes sir look children I'm trying my best to help you we're fixing to leave this world you'd better get ready I'm telling you you better get ready the days of planned Church are over if say your beloved or is it your spare time you see your everything does it mean everything did you let him control your life your temper your attitude but the dawn is that important let him control your attitude now he'll control your altitude after a while [Applause] listen you hear it you hear it it's sand coming through the hole on the door oh man what he found it you had the latch bottom saw his hand he stood there for a few more moments of grace you just kind of I can't do it no it's good I took with him later swing of sleeping pills not knocking me out I just can't and then you finally got up and you just kind of stagger over to the door and you open the door please go remember you're not lost you're not cast away but you missed your moment of intimacy where's the can because you put daddy first grandpa first your John your wife your husband of them all because you've convinced yourself you have to and then you get beat to death and then you blame it on God's whale well it was God so help me I'll say this from verse 7 to verse 9 is not that far but for some people it can be five years ten fifteen before they ever gets surrendered you said anything it takes God that long but sometimes it takes us that long in here to move from verse 7 over to verse 9 to where that we now have the opportunity to answer what is your beloved more just tell tell me go ahead and talk would you cuz you're fixin to talk yourself out of this valley and how you gonna talk yourself out of braggin on him till the now big years I wonderfully have when Joba solo he felt like he couldn't go no farther the man have been through so much stuff at trial going on for about a year 11 months to 12 months one a horrific thing after another all of a sudden God comes down in a whirlwind it's a job stand up gird up your loins like a man and I won't demand of you Nance this day and God goes too overwhelming job where were you when I created the foundations of the earth where were you when I hung the morning stars where were you and I made the hoarfrost to come where were you when I done this and that the other don't you see what God's doing God is magnifying his person and belittling job's trial but when you make your problem bigger than your God you're in a mess of trouble and then Jobe finally got up to a spot and he said I have heard of thee with a hearing of the ear but now - easy recognizing God and speaker than your problem God is bigger than the mass your daughter's in or the mass your son is in he's bigger than the mass your finances are in if you can only trust me [Applause] sprite together I found this to be such a paradox in verse nine that the daughters of Jerusalem saw a beauty in the bride that was overwhelming to them but yes she didn't see it in herself as a matter of fact she said about herself I am black the son found upon me this that the other but they looked at her and called her the fairest among women now here she's mr. time of fellowship but she hasn't missed who she is children may you realize temporary setbacks don't identify who you are glory to God glory to God you are who you are from your soul not from your failures and would like to be remembered before the Lord tonight you may say about yourself I'm black but comely I miss God I fell short of the glory of God brother Donnie what can I do do the talk on Matty go to talking about him and let let your sub-conscience the man in the engine-room let him hear what you really think when the devil says he nothing - you ain't that's not another you ain't bribed you ain't this and that why don't you let that man down there go to lining up of that word a man and hear yourself speaking it he's the living of my phallus I know you've read Psalms 23 many of us since she was a child let me quote it to you tonight the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters Psalms 23 this feel was a personal revelation of the shepherd and you as an individual sheep many many years ago a great man stood before thousands and thousands of people and he stands and they asked him to quote Psalms 23 he's a great orator he stands there with a great eloquence of a great speaker and he quotes Psalms 23 and my ever half and every now and every pronoun every verb every adjective was exactly right then they asked an old preacher to get up the old preacher didn't hardly say it quite as well but when the old preacher got done thousands of people in the auditorium will weep in the orator still that back to the preacher sat down and said now the difference ladies and gentlemen was I was quoting what I read he was quoting what he knew by heart and by experience that's the way I want to call this word don't you and so I want to call it again not by memorization not just my memory calling it up but I want to call it by experience knowing he is my shepherd it was pray together Heavenly Father I pray you'd look at every heart and this building tonight those that have streamed or those that will archive Lord God we say we're sorry how many times have you knocked in her bedroom door and we've made flimsy excuses I've took off my coat shall I put it on again have washed my feet shall I get them dirty again what excuses to give to the king of King forgive us Lord but your mercy is so bountiful and their renewed every morning Lord Jesus may you search every heart may you begin with me to that Lord there's anything you see in me Lord God that's displeasing to him my life is open before you search me I want no secret passages I want no secret doors that you're not allowed to enter to I want you to come through every door through every hallway go to the Attic go to the basement go to the garage go to every room in my soul search every place see if there's anything you find in me Lord God but sis presenting make it known to me before this night is passed I'll make it right Oh Lord God a prayer to help each of us maybe in the wee hours of the morning we hear you knocking on the door maybe Wilber tired weary I will fall a tremendous battle will say Lord it just keep I can't do it Laura just give us strength Lord give us strength to get up go and open the tower who let you in because if you've come to awake us you've not come to take from us no doubt you'll give us something that'll help us through the rest of the long weary night hallelujah Lord Jesus may you minister to every soul according to their need Lord God hallelujah oh my beloved Lord we want to do is I read today where brother Branham said there in 1957 he said I want my heart to be as the Song of Solomon where he said kiss the son lest he be angry he said no what you just want to kiss him tonight don't you want to kiss the son he said when he said her little lips looks like to do and he said you take your lover the Lord Jesus in your arms he said but what if you've been after kissing on the world and loving on the world he wouldn't feel welcome in your lap oh but Lord Jesus we open our arms to you tonight Lord we don't want to kitchen Jesus wouldn't want to live in a room Jesus we want a whole house Jesus praise God praise God thank you lord can we just raised her hands children many of you will give Jesus your ties you'll give Jesus throughout a tower on the outside your sisters would dress and long dresses and all that but many of you never make that full commitment of your emotions to him there was an element of your emotions if you've kept back you're afraid of what people
