[43:04] 11:1 certainly appreciate the
[43:06] opportunity for us to be able to be
[43:07] gathered together again tonight I
[43:09] understand you all had some wonderful
[43:10] meetings this last weekend what' you
[43:13] think about brother Josh Bennett he's
[43:14] quite a preacher a he amen so appreciate
[43:17] brother Josh and I appreciate his gift
[43:20] to preach some preachers are good
[43:22] preachers and they know it but brother
[43:25] Josh is a good preacher and he's so
[43:27] humble with it I just love a man like
[43:29] that where he just he text me and he
[43:31] said I think I've done the offest job
[43:33] that ever was and I'd already go heard
[43:36] so many compliments and so many
[43:38] wonderful things and he wasn't trying to
[43:40] be fake or false that's just the way he
[43:42] looks at it God can use a man like that
[43:44] can he amen had some good meetings up at
[43:47] brother Ron Spencer brother Timothy and
[43:49] brother Tim did an outstanding job just
[43:51] really good and so enjoyed being able to
[43:54] be there here We Are Tonight night on
[43:56] Wednesday night how many's got needs
[43:58] tonight wow I'd figured there' been more
[44:00] of you I figured everybody have double
[44:01] hands of well I'll raise both mine for
[44:05] you amen but we know the Lord is so
[44:07] mindful of us a he so we've come tonight
[44:10] to open our hearts to him and just see
[44:12] what he'll speak to us and see what
[44:14] he'll do for us I believe he has some
[44:16] wonderful things in store for us Hebrews
[44:20] 11:1 a very wonderful scripture most of
[44:23] you probably could quote it by heart now
[44:26] faith is the
[44:28] substance of things hoped
[44:31] for the evidence of Things Not
[44:36] Seen so Faith gives
[44:39] reality or substance to things that we
[44:44] hope for notice verse two for by it by
[44:50] What Faith by it the elders obtained a
[44:55] good report
[44:57] through faith now watch Paul use a
[45:00] different word from verse two to verse
[45:02] three verse two for by it the elders
[45:06] obtained a good report verse three
[45:10] through faith we understand that the
[45:13] worlds were framed by the word of God
[45:17] through
[45:19] faith you mean faith and the word is
[45:23] what frames the world well whose Faith
[45:25] walk was it it was God's faith so you
[45:29] mean God had to have
[45:32] faith wow so you see the term the faith
[45:37] of God shouldn't be an unusual thing to
[45:39] us God
[45:41] believed his own word God and you and I
[45:44] will believe his own word too so notice
[45:47] how the worlds are
[45:49] framed through faith we understand that
[45:51] the worlds not one but plural the worlds
[45:56] were framed by the word of God through
[46:00] faith so God spoke it Prophet said it
[46:03] might have been 800 years might have
[46:04] been a million years before anything
[46:07] happened but God believed it and it
[46:10] would happen so that things which are
[46:13] seen were not made of things which do
[46:16] appear by faith Abel offered unto God a
[46:20] more excellent sacrifice in Cain by
[46:22] which he obtained witness that he was
[46:24] righteous God testified of his gifts and
[46:27] by yet speaketh by faith Enoch was
[46:31] translated that he should not see death
[46:34] and was not found because God had
[46:36] translated him for before his
[46:38] translation he had this testimony that
[46:41] he pleased God but without
[46:45] faith it is
[46:48] impossible to please him for he that
[46:51] cometh to God must believe that he is
[46:54] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[46:57] diligently seek him I want to speak to
[47:01] you tonight on The
[47:03] Sixth
[47:05] Sense the
[47:07] sixth
[47:08] sense I mean lot to be remembered as we
[47:11] pray God bless you let's join together
[47:14] in faith
[47:15] now heavenly father as we have our heads
[47:18] bowed to the dust of the Earth from
[47:20] whence we were
[47:21] taken we've come once again tonight Lord
[47:24] that we might worship fell Fellowship we
[47:27] might clap our hands sing we might hear
[47:30] the word that we might preach the word
[47:32] that we might sayen to the word father
[47:36] we have come here because we're a needy
[47:38] people but we've not only just come for
[47:41] our needs but we believe you have a need
[47:44] to be worshiped and you have a need to
[47:48] be believed you are looking for someone
[47:52] who will believe
[47:53] you you're looking for for someone who
[47:57] will trust you I will be one of those
[48:00] tonight father you're looking for people
[48:04] who will worship you when they feel
[48:07] absolutely
[48:08] nothing they will trust you when they
[48:12] feel no different because they simply
[48:15] take you at your word you see our needs
[48:18] tonight father would you speak to us
[48:20] your word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:23] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[48:26] turn around and tell somebody for you're
[48:27] seated glad to see you in the house of
[48:30] God
[48:31] tonight now you can take your seats God
[48:33] bless
[48:35] you so what is
[48:38] Faith what is Faith now we know there's
[48:41] two kinds of it there's a supernatural
[48:44] faith and there's intellectual Faith
[48:46] there's an element of the promises of
[48:47] God and things that we'll get from God
[48:50] that will only come by us taking our
[48:53] human face and appropriating that faith
[48:56] and believing what God Said and God will
[48:59] honor that faith we know the prophet
[49:01] told us the right mental attitude toward
[49:04] any promise of God will bring it to pass
[49:08] but then we also know there's times our
[49:10] faith just won't do it our faith will
[49:14] never be enough to be able to do what we
[49:17] need and the Lord understands that so he
[49:20] gives us his faith now I got to be
[49:23] honest I wish that every time I'm in a
[49:25] very difficult spot the Lord would let
[49:28] me have his faith right off it'd be a
[49:30] lot easier for all of us would it not
[49:32] but he doesn't do that many times he
[49:34] waits till our faith runs out as he
[49:38] waits till our strength runs out as he
[49:40] waits till sometimes our human
[49:42] understanding and many other things runs
[49:44] out and then he will step in because he
[49:46] knows if he stepped in as soon as we got
[49:49] into a little bit of a trial would be
[49:51] more lazy than what we are already and a
[49:53] lot of us are pretty lazy to begin with
[49:55] so God will wait until our faith reaches
[49:58] its end He waited till Abraham's
[50:00] strength had totally run out Abraham
[50:03] could father and ishmail they're still
[50:06] dealing with that trouble today but God
[50:08] had to wait till Abraham's strengths and
[50:11] everything else about him was totally
[50:13] wiped out and when that happened then
[50:15] God intervened and proved it was by his
[50:18] strengths that Isaac would be born I'm
[50:21] convinced every one of us probably here
[50:22] tonight have produced ish mails in our
[50:25] life and you may be still dealing with
[50:26] that after effect and God will allow us
[50:29] to run to our strength's end before our
[50:32] Isaac will be produced now but let me
[50:34] read you a couple things here about what
[50:36] real revelatory Faith actually is what
[50:40] is Faith ano once the end time faith is
[50:43] something that's revealed to you that is
[50:47] not yet that's notice it's revealed to
[50:50] you but it's not yet but you believe it
[50:54] will be faith is a revelation of the
[50:58] will of God now for instance there's
[51:00] many people who believe that God Is A
[51:03] Healer and they have a real need in
[51:06] their body or maybe in their home
[51:07] somebody in their family has got a real
[51:09] need and they believe that God can but
[51:13] they don't have the Revelation that God
[51:15] will now do they have faith they do they
[51:19] have an element of faith that God can do
[51:21] it maybe they heard that God could do it
[51:24] well as I was sitting in the hospital
[51:25] room today and some people come in to
[51:28] talk to Erica and they was telling her
[51:30] Lance myself and Erica was there and
[51:33] they went through all the different
[51:34] things that they was thinking about and
[51:36] this and that and the other and Lance
[51:38] said well you know we we'll have to pray
[51:41] about this well as soon as Lance said
[51:44] pray about it then this woman totally
[51:47] changed and she started talking about
[51:50] the Lord I'm sure they had to be real
[51:52] careful you know what they say nowadays
[51:54] so she started talking about the Lord
[51:57] and how that God can move and she said
[51:59] let me tell you right now we believe
[52:01] that God can perform Miracles we have
[52:05] seen him and she said our church is
[52:07] having a Revival and she said I go to a
[52:10] certain certain Baptist Church and I saw
[52:15] whoa you mean to tell me that God can
[52:19] perform miracles in a Baptist Church now
[52:22] you're this woman has been in the
[52:24] medical field for years and years and
[52:27] yet believed in Miracles and said she
[52:31] had seen
[52:33] them and she wasn't a message believer
[52:36] but she was a Baptist believer now for
[52:39] those of you who think God is only
[52:42] moving in Bride churches you need to
[52:45] open up your understanding a little bit
[52:47] this is why the only identification of a
[52:50] Believer is not
[52:52] Miracles well praise the Lord to three
[52:55] different nurses since Erica has been in
[52:57] the hospital oh yes the Lord can do this
[53:00] and the Lord can do that bobbed haired
[53:02] makeup wearing pants a whole nine yards
[53:05] as would say so don't get in your mind
[53:08] that Miracles are only happening in
[53:11] message churches the Lord God loves
[53:14] Humanity so much he will heal some
[53:17] people knowing they will never serve him
[53:21] brother Ron Spencer told me the other
[53:22] day one of the greatest profound
[53:24] miracles in ever seen in his own
[53:26] Ministry happened to a person that never
[53:30] served God never gave their heart to God
[53:33] given just a few hours to live and the
[53:36] spirit of God moved for him and brought
[53:38] them out of the hospital the very next
[53:40] day they've never even gave one day to
[53:43] Jesus Christ since then so don't get in
[53:47] your mind that it's bride only you see
[53:50] God loves humanity and he wants them to
[53:54] be healed wants them to be saved but
[53:57] when we're talking about not trying
[53:59] people and God being able to trust
[54:01] people that's not your average Joe out
[54:04] here that's not everybody that goes to
[54:06] church but God wants to be able to try
[54:10] his bride like nobody else now watch how
[54:13] the prophet deals with this again and
[54:15] works as Faith expressed now Faith is a
[54:18] revelation from God faith is a
[54:21] revelation now there's where I want to
[54:23] stay there just a moment it's a
[54:25] revelation he has revealed to you by his
[54:28] grace it's nothing you did now listen
[54:31] about your faith how great it is you
[54:34] didn't work yourself up into Faith you
[54:37] never have
[54:40] faith well Glory you never have faith
[54:45] it's give to you by the grace of God God
[54:50] reveals it to you therefore faith is a
[54:53] revelation and the whole Church of God
[54:56] is built upon the Revelation and the
[55:00] church said so whenever you and I are in
[55:03] need now get in mind it's not just about
[55:05] healing we don't need Revelation just
[55:08] for healing only but maybe you're having
[55:11] family problems maybe you're having
[55:13] marriage problems you need a revelation
[55:17] about the will of God for your family a
[55:20] revelation about the will of God for
[55:23] your marriage did God put you and your
[55:25] wife together did God put you and your
[55:28] husband together then you need a
[55:31] revelation that if God puts you together
[55:33] God wants you to stay together God don't
[55:36] want you arguing and fussing and
[55:38] fighting God wants you to be able to
[55:41] love one another forgive one another and
[55:44] be what he intended for your marriage to
[55:46] be and somebody said amen well I just
[55:50] know somebody was going to say oh me
[55:51] about that but it's not just about
[55:55] Divine Healing Faith involves way more
[55:59] than Divine Healing as a matter of fact
[56:01] we're going to need faith for a
[56:05] Rapture listen this Rapture message now
[56:08] it is a revelation for the Revelation is
[56:11] Faith you cannot have a revelation
[56:14] without it being faith faith is a
[56:17] revelation because it's something that's
[56:20] revealed to you now God might drop in
[56:23] your heart tonight that you are going to
[56:26] be healed of a certain certain thing
[56:28] your husband may not know it your daddy
[56:31] may not know it your mama may not know
[56:33] it and it's not real to them yet but
[56:36] it's real to you and everybody else may
[56:39] say honey we believe it with you and
[56:41] we're standing there by you and yes a
[56:44] amen that's the word of God but even if
[56:47] your husband said now wait a minute darl
[56:49] and don't you think you're getting a
[56:50] little bit religious now don't you think
[56:52] you're bringing a little bit of reproach
[56:54] if your mama didn't believe it your
[56:56] husband didn't believe it your wife
[56:58] didn't believe it it wouldn't make no
[57:00] difference to you because God has made
[57:03] it known to you and it is so real if no
[57:07] one else believes it but you you and God
[57:11] are the majority now what it is a
[57:14] revelation Satan cannot talk you out of
[57:18] it let's resume again now in Hebrews
[57:21] 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God
[57:25] of things not seen as yet moved with
[57:28] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[57:30] his house by which he condemned the
[57:33] world and became the heir of
[57:35] righteousness which is by Faith by faith
[57:39] Abraham when he was called out to go
[57:42] into a place which he should receive for
[57:45] an inheritance notice obeyed and he went
[57:49] out not knowing whether he went notice
[57:52] the commonality among all of these
[57:54] people they didn't know where they were
[57:56] going they didn't know exactly what it
[57:58] all held they did not know all the
[58:01] particulars they didn't know the battles
[58:02] the tests and the trials that laid
[58:04] before them but all they knew was God
[58:07] had showed them something you see when
[58:09] God makes it known to us he doesn't
[58:11] always show us all the way to the end
[58:14] and every trial and every step of the
[58:16] way we're on a journey how many believes
[58:18] that you know there's stages in this
[58:20] journey that you may go days oh my and
[58:23] weeks and months and there'll be one
[58:25] Victory after another after another and
[58:28] then sometimes God and you don't hear no
[58:30] good news forever it's one bad news one
[58:33] bad report one bad this or that or the
[58:36] other and it may seem like it's getting
[58:38] worse you're praying for your son or
[58:40] your daughter and it seem like they're
[58:42] getting meaner and meaner keep right on
[58:44] praying for him that's a good sign God's
[58:46] heard your prayer and the devil knows
[58:48] the answer is on the way so he trying to
[58:51] discourage you to talk you into to
[58:54] giving up and giving in because he knows
[58:57] his days are
[58:59] numbered and somebody said am amen now
[59:03] watch what God did now by faith he
[59:06] sojourned in the land of promise as in a
[59:09] strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[59:12] with Isaac and Jacob the hirs with him
[59:15] of the same promise verse 11 through
[59:18] faith also Sarah herself received
[59:22] strength to conceive seed and was the
[59:24] delivered of a child when she was past
[59:27] age because she judged him faithful who
[59:32] had promised is anybody here tonight
[59:35] like Sarah how many judges God Faithful
[59:37] of what he said in his word now
[59:40] yesterday I was down in the basement at
[59:42] the house and I I was listening to a
[59:45] tape and talking to the Lord and praying
[59:47] and oh my I I was just having myself a
[59:51] time down there me and the Lord and I
[59:53] was listening to brother brand as he was
[59:55] preaching and talking about some great
[59:57] events that had happened in his life and
[1:00:00] all of a sudden while I was there in the
[1:00:02] basement assumingly by myself and the
[1:00:06] presence of God come there where I was
[1:00:09] and I heard the voice of God say these
[1:00:13] words is there anything too hard for the
[1:00:19] Lord and I answered back and said no sir
[1:00:24] there is is nothing too hard for you now
[1:00:28] read with me in Genesis
[1:00:31] 18:13 and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:00:34] wherefore did Sarah life saying shall I
[1:00:37] have assurity bear a child which am old
[1:00:39] notice now God is the one who said this
[1:00:43] to Abraham is there anything too hard
[1:00:48] for the Lord at the time appointed I
[1:00:53] will return unto thee
[1:00:55] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:00:59] Sarah is going to have a son now
[1:01:03] remember God did not he absolutely did
[1:01:06] not break his Covenant because of that
[1:01:09] but God asked Abraham this question is
[1:01:13] there anything too hard for the Lord so
[1:01:15] whatever you're dealing with tonight do
[1:01:18] you honestly believe whatever it is that
[1:01:20] it's too big for God is there anybody
[1:01:23] here tonight that has got a problem that
[1:01:25] in reality you feel like that problem is
[1:01:28] too big for God is cancer too big for
[1:01:32] God to heal no is is a wayward son or a
[1:01:36] Wayward Daughter too far gone that God
[1:01:39] by his grace cannot reach down to them
[1:01:41] if you've got a a terrible terrible
[1:01:43] thing going on in your home or in your
[1:01:46] finances whatever it is is that bigger
[1:01:48] than our God is any sickness any disease
[1:01:52] any heartache any anxiety oh your
[1:01:55] depression tonight oh you say it's so
[1:01:57] dark and it's so deep but is it bigger
[1:02:00] than God cuz somebody going to preach on
[1:02:02] me
[1:02:02] tonight is there anything too hard for
[1:02:06] the Lord is there anything that you and
[1:02:10] I are facing in this hour that's too big
[1:02:13] for our God that he cannot move you're
[1:02:16] at liberty right now to stand and point
[1:02:19] it out to me but I warn you before you
[1:02:22] do I will answer you back and say there
[1:02:25] is nothing too hard for my God there is
[1:02:30] nothing too great that our God cannot
[1:02:33] move I don't care how sick you are how
[1:02:36] much in debt you are how sad you may be
[1:02:39] our God is a veing and deliverance and
[1:02:43] happiness and peace and there is nothing
[1:02:47] greater than our
[1:02:50] God hallelujah
[1:02:53] hallelujah
[1:02:55] Hebrews 11:32 and what shall I more say
[1:02:59] for the time would fail me to tell of
[1:03:01] Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and
[1:03:05] of jeepa of David also and Samuel and
[1:03:09] the prophets notice what happened
[1:03:12] through faith who through faith subdued
[1:03:16] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain
[1:03:20] promises stopped the mouths of lions is
[1:03:24] there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:03:29] Abraham's body was dead is that too hard
[1:03:32] for God answer me Sarah's womb was dead
[1:03:37] was that too hard for God her her heart
[1:03:40] could not be able to support giving
[1:03:43] birth to a baby was that too hard for
[1:03:46] God her womb was dried up was that too
[1:03:50] hard for God it seemed like the world
[1:03:53] was in such darkness and chaos but was
[1:03:56] it too hard that God could not come down
[1:04:00] and take on the form of a baby and go to
[1:04:03] a cross and die and raise himself up
[1:04:06] from the grave could the Roman seal be
[1:04:09] too hard for Jesus to not break through
[1:04:13] come on somebody could Lazarus be so
[1:04:16] dead that he could not call his voice
[1:04:19] amen could not the blind man in Matthew
[1:04:23] could blindness keep him from seeing
[1:04:26] good Hallelujah Blind barus by the walls
[1:04:30] of Jericho was he too blind for Jesus to
[1:04:33] heal it answer me somebody were you too
[1:04:37] lost that he could not save you were you
[1:04:40] too sick that he could not heal you were
[1:04:43] you too bound that he could not deliver
[1:04:46] you is there anything too hard for the
[1:04:53] Lord
[1:04:57] Oh
[1:04:58] Glory women receive their dead raised to
[1:05:01] life again others were tortured not
[1:05:05] accepting Deliverance that they might
[1:05:07] obtain a better Resurrection others had
[1:05:10] trial of crewel mockings and scourgings
[1:05:13] yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment
[1:05:17] how did they overcome it by fa in the
[1:05:19] promised word think they didn't even
[1:05:21] have a
[1:05:22] Bible you understand me people didn't
[1:05:24] have a bible to read they did not have a
[1:05:27] Bible Abraham did not have a Bible that
[1:05:29] he could turn over there when he would
[1:05:31] get down and weary and discouraged and
[1:05:33] open up and say well that that's the
[1:05:35] word of God I I know my name is right
[1:05:37] there in the promise he didn't even have
[1:05:39] a Bible Isaac never had a Bible Jacob
[1:05:41] never had a Bible they did not have a
[1:05:43] Bible for hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:05:46] but they took God at his word how could
[1:05:49] they do it it was revealed to
[1:05:52] them notice this in Roman Romans 4: 19
[1:05:56] now the prophet said whenever he got
[1:05:58] discouraged he read Romans 4 if you
[1:06:02] haven't tried that it's a real good
[1:06:04] antidote for
[1:06:05] depression whenever you feel like you
[1:06:07] can't make it notice Romans 4 19
[1:06:11] speaking about Abraham and being not
[1:06:14] weak in FA he
[1:06:17] considered
[1:06:19] not he considered not paid no attention
[1:06:25] to the physical obstacles which were in
[1:06:28] his way or Sarah's way he didn't even
[1:06:33] consider now I doubt was that every day
[1:06:35] every day he was getting up he had his
[1:06:37] oh oh my these aches and pains and this
[1:06:40] and that and the other why just say well
[1:06:42] that that's all right that's no problem
[1:06:44] with God it'll be a greater Miracle
[1:06:45] tomorrow than it was today because I
[1:06:47] know I'm one day older Sarah's one day
[1:06:49] older I don't even consider glory to God
[1:06:52] we're going to have that baby in hell
[1:06:54] why you realize friend a person with
[1:06:56] this type of faith is an absolute idiot
[1:06:59] to the eyes of the world what's really
[1:07:01] sad is this person with this type of
[1:07:03] faith is almost like that in some of the
[1:07:05] message churches because they think
[1:07:08] you're crazy oh my you're bringing
[1:07:09] reproach no you're not you're giving
[1:07:11] witness to the word of God Amen notice
[1:07:15] being not weak in faith he considered
[1:07:18] not he didn't even look at it he paid
[1:07:21] absolutely no attention you imagine how
[1:07:24] hard that would be getting up your Lum
[1:07:25] bag go bothering you in the morning and
[1:07:27] your Feet's hurting you and your back is
[1:07:29] hurting and this and that and the other
[1:07:30] is hurting said I don't even consider
[1:07:32] that's fine it ain't no problem at all
[1:07:33] ain't nothing too big for my God cuz God
[1:07:35] was the one who told him that so he said
[1:07:37] there ain't nothing bigger than that say
[1:07:39] oh Lord oh Lord my back's kill me my
[1:07:41] loveo my arthritis I've got this and

[1:08:26] too hard for the
[1:08:32] Lord being not weak in faith he
[1:08:35] considered not his own body now

[1:08:46] dead when he was about a hundred years
[1:08:49] old neither yet the deadness of Sarah

[1:09:18] you'll feel it and I'll eat the whole
[1:09:20] book that's right he never never said
[1:09:25] that one
[1:09:27] time as a matter of fact you ain't got a
[1:09:30] feeling one or a sense that will even
[1:09:34] declare
[1:09:37] Fai you can't feel Faith you can't taste
[1:09:41] it you can't smell it you ain't got one
[1:09:44] sense in your body that will declare

[1:10:10] know what wor about him everybody keep
[1:10:12] your eye on Abraham P fell I believe his
[1:10:15] Alzheimer's is kicking in his dementia's
[1:10:18] acting up a little bit he's told me not
[1:10:20] to say I was old poor fell look at him
[1:10:22] he just barely get
[1:10:24] glory to God careful careful you fall

[1:10:56] God you're here y'all pull say just go
[1:10:57] along with them you know they say that's
[1:10:59] the way you have good people like that
[1:11:01] no People Like Us don't even care if you
[1:11:02] don't go along with us you don't want to
[1:11:04] go along that's up to you but we're
[1:11:06] going along anyhow I'd rather take God
[1:11:08] at his word than believe ever lie of the
[1:11:13] devil notice in verse 20 he staggered
[1:11:17] not and the word staggered is properly
[1:11:20] made to use of your own judgment and
[1:11:23] reason and Discerning things by what
[1:11:26] sort they are so staggering is that you
[1:11:29] look at it and you use your own reason
[1:11:32] and your own ability and you try to
[1:11:34] figure it out on your mind now this just
[1:11:35] makes perfect sense there's no way God
[1:11:38] is going to give a an old man 100 years
[1:11:40] old and his wife old too 90 and they're
[1:11:43] going to have a baby wife God was going
[1:11:44] to do anything and do it sensible he get
[1:11:46] an 18 year old boy and about 18 year old
[1:11:48] girl something like that and give them a
[1:11:50] child no he wouldn't God picked a 100y
[1:11:53] old man and a 90y old
[1:11:57] woman he staggered not at the promise of
[1:12:00] God to unbelief but was
[1:12:03] strong Lord God I hope God can say this
[1:12:06] about me he was strong in face giv glory
[1:12:11] to God so he didn't sit around oh me
[1:12:17] wowy wowy
[1:12:20] woo well I believe God for about 45
[1:12:23] minutes yesterday it didn't come I give
[1:12:26] God record after 10: and he told me
[1:12:28] about 9:40 or something like that and I
[1:12:30] give him record after 10 and if it
[1:12:32] didn't come I just said well I guess
[1:12:33] ain't going to come well it may not come
[1:12:35] today but it might come tomorrow and if
[1:12:38] it don't come tomorrow if I you I'll be
[1:12:39] looking forth the next day tell me what
[1:12:41] other option do we have tell me somebody
[1:12:44] what other oh oh you say medical science
[1:12:46] baloney Medical Science oh they run out
[1:12:49] to their end politics has run to its end
[1:12:52] World God government is run to its end
[1:12:55] we only have one real hope and that's
[1:12:57] the Lord
[1:13:04] Jesus notice verse 21 and being fully
[1:13:09] persuaded that what he had promised he
[1:13:13] was able
[1:13:14] also to
[1:13:16] perform and the church
[1:13:18] said now let's look at this substance
[1:13:21] Faith see feel smell here is is that
[1:13:25] right them five senses control the
[1:13:27] entire human body is that true then
[1:13:29] taste feel smell and he now there's none
[1:13:32] of them that declare
[1:13:35] Faith but why is it that we want to tie
[1:13:39] feelings to Faith Oh Glory to God I feel
[1:13:43] Faith I I feel it I feel it if you
[1:13:45] believe the message you know that's not
[1:13:47] true
[1:13:51] that's now you you know me well enough
[1:13:54] to know I wouldn't make that statement
[1:13:55] if I didn't have it in front of
[1:13:58] me and that's why sometimes people are
[1:14:00] defeated because I didn't feel anything
[1:14:03] I didn't feel nothing Brother Don he
[1:14:05] prayed for me and somebody else shouted
[1:14:06] and they passed out in the spirit and
[1:14:08] they fell out did that mean they got
[1:14:10] healed it does not I've seen people
[1:14:12] shout across the platform and totally
[1:14:14] miss their healing because they got so
[1:14:17] emotional so tied up in the emotion and
[1:14:19] others walk right through and just as
[1:14:21] dries an old dead Tater and lay right
[1:14:23] there and say well glory to God I Take
[1:14:25] God at his word and walk right out for
[1:14:27] they're healed instantly by the power of
[1:14:29] God never shouted never jump never sh no
[1:14:32] we're not against that we believe in
[1:14:35] that but feeling is no sign that you're
[1:14:38] healed jumping is no sign that you're
[1:14:40] Delivered come on somebody you believe
[1:14:44] God and take God at his
[1:14:47] word that's the six
[1:14:51] sense now he said face is the only
[1:14:55] direct and positive
[1:14:58] sense it's the sick sense faith is more
[1:15:03] than sight faith is more than
[1:15:09] feeling but do we believe that faith is
[1:15:13] more than feeling you do not feel
[1:15:19] facei you do not feel facei
[1:15:24] but is it amazing if we don't feel
[1:15:26] something then we think we didn't have
[1:15:28] faith no you're measuring you're trying
[1:15:30] to measure the super sense by one of the
[1:15:34] five you're trying to measure the
[1:15:37] phenomenal super sense by one of the
[1:15:41] five I didn't feel anything I didn't see
[1:15:44] anything I didn't taste anything
[1:15:46] somebody told me when they got prayed
[1:15:47] for oil run out of their hands and water
[1:15:49] run out of their hands and they just
[1:15:51] felt a chill from the top of their head
[1:15:53] go all over their body Oh Glory to God I
[1:15:55] felt Faith No you're measuring it by the
[1:15:58] wrong
[1:16:01] sense well Glory maybe I need to start a
[1:16:04] new
[1:16:05] series watch this faith is the only
[1:16:08] direct and positive sense it's the six
[1:16:10] sense faith is more than sight faith is
[1:16:13] more than feeling you do not feel Faith
[1:16:17] you don't taste Fai you don't smell face
[1:16:22] You Don't See see faith faith is the
[1:16:25] substance of things hope for and the
[1:16:27] evidence of Things Not Seen again he
[1:16:31] says God put man in five senses to
[1:16:33] contact his Earthly home you don't
[1:16:35] contact god with your five senses you
[1:16:38] know God by faith which is the Sixth
[1:16:41] Sense on down and later in this
[1:16:43] paragraph well you see I don't feel any
[1:16:46] different you're not supposed to feel
[1:16:50] any
[1:16:51] different that's friends I won't you
[1:16:53] look at what we've done if we're not
[1:16:56] careful we're going the exact opposite
[1:16:59] of what the prophet messenger taught us
[1:17:03] and then if we don't feel something I
[1:17:05] didn't get nothing I didn't get nothing
[1:17:06] you go right back through the prayer
[1:17:08] line again and again and again well what
[1:17:10] am I waiting for what am I waiting for
[1:17:12] God to make a better promise how can God
[1:17:14] make a better promise what what are many
[1:17:16] people looking for a feeling a sensation
[1:17:19] well they did Oh Glory to God I know I
[1:17:21] got it now so you're judging the
[1:17:24] supernatural by a feeling which can lie
[1:17:27] to you come on do you know the super
[1:17:30] sense can never
[1:17:35] lie how many's ever had your feelings to
[1:17:40] lie you ever see these drawings and
[1:17:44] diagrams and things where it'll be
[1:17:46] certain words or certain pictures and
[1:17:49] you'll look at it and somebody say you
[1:17:51] see this and this and you say
[1:17:53] no and they saidwell turn it this way
[1:17:55] and look at that and you say oh my
[1:17:57] goodness somebody showed me one the
[1:17:59] other day it was a picture of two girls
[1:18:02] and the way you look at one one was
[1:18:04] looking one way and one was looking the
[1:18:06] other and you look right at it depending
[1:18:08] on how you look at it and the image is
[1:18:10] so clear once you see it and I held it
[1:18:12] up to somebody else said you see it I
[1:18:14] said no I don't see it I don't see it so
[1:18:16] their sight was not being true to them
[1:18:19] but it had been revealed to me that
[1:18:22] there was another image in the photo and
[1:18:24] whenever I turned it around and pointed
[1:18:26] it out then they saw it don't you
[1:18:29] understand that cloud that appeared out
[1:18:30] there in Arizona in
[1:18:32] 1963 don't you understand who that was
[1:18:36] oh they may look at in the Science
[1:18:38] magazine and call it this and that and
[1:18:40] the other and it wasn't until
[1:18:42] 1965 that the prophet held it up before
[1:18:44] the audience of brandham Tabernacle and
[1:18:47] turned it to the right held it up like
[1:18:50] this and then turned it to the right and
[1:18:52] whenever looked and said who was it
[1:18:54] Christ in all his glory the scientists
[1:18:57] look at it preachers looked at it
[1:18:59] brother Bram even looked at it himself
[1:19:01] but until God revealed it to him he
[1:19:04] didn't see who it was but now you and I
[1:19:06] every time we look at it we know who it
[1:19:08] is so what our sight then could lie to
[1:19:12] us our feelings can lie to us praise the
[1:19:17] Lord notice this and El Shad we've had
[1:19:21] too much of this here High pressured
[1:19:24] Latter Day Divine Healing campaigns
[1:19:27] exactly right people saying I got it in
[1:19:30] the hand I feel it feel it you feel it
[1:19:33] no you don't feel it you might feel your
[1:19:36] hand but that's all you
[1:19:38] fed that's right Jesus never did say did
[1:19:41] you feel it he said did you believe it
[1:19:44] not did you feel it do you believe faith
[1:19:47] is not
[1:19:51] feeling faith is something that you
[1:19:54] don't
[1:19:57] feel oh my
[1:20:00] goodness you have no
[1:20:03] senses that will declare
[1:20:07] it only that six sense that Faith knows
[1:20:11] it you don't feel taste smell or hear it
[1:20:15] but you know it so you don't touch it
[1:20:18] you don't taste it you don't hear it you
[1:20:20] don't smell it but you know it and it's
[1:20:23] more real than your
[1:20:25] sight it's more real than your
[1:20:29] feelings glory to God notice this the
[1:20:32] six sense belongs only to the Christian
[1:20:37] you cannot have this six sense until you
[1:20:40] become a Christian
[1:20:42] wow okay so you cannot have the six
[1:20:46] sense until you become a Christian
[1:20:50] notice again same sermon in Jefferson
[1:20:51] Avail but when the five senses act
[1:20:53] contrary to the word of God then they
[1:20:56] are lying how many's had your senses to
[1:20:59] lie to
[1:21:00] you I me felt like somebody had
[1:21:02] something against you boy you just you
[1:21:04] just know they you know they did and you
[1:21:06] thought I'm going to go to him or I'm
[1:21:07] going to go to her and I'm going to ask
[1:21:09] him about it you go tell them and say
[1:21:10] well Lord have mercy brother sister
[1:21:12] goodness no I don't want what you're
[1:21:14] talking about I don't have nothing
[1:21:15] against you I love you all my heart and
[1:21:17] you know what we'll do many times we'll
[1:21:19] still believe our our senses and our
[1:21:21] feelings our sight over the word of a
[1:21:24] consecrated Christian because why
[1:21:26] because our feelings our sight our
[1:21:28] emotions whatever more has convinced us
[1:21:31] that person's got something against us
[1:21:33] and they'll stand right there and say
[1:21:34] well brother I don't have nothing
[1:21:35] against you at all I've always loved you
[1:21:37] and I thank God for you and all that and
[1:21:39] you said I don't believe it I don't
[1:21:40] believe it don't believe it you know
[1:21:41] what how many times have we been
[1:21:43] deceived and the devil's learned how
[1:21:45] dependent we are on our senses and on
[1:21:48] our feelings and all of that and he'll
[1:21:50] lie to us oh my goodness and what better
[1:21:53] person to lie or to use to lie than
[1:21:58] yourself cuz most of us will believe us
[1:22:01] over anybody
[1:22:04] else I just feel like brother Rob don't
[1:22:07] like me brother Rob I'm GNA pick on you
[1:22:09] I know you got broad shoulders i' I've
[1:22:12] just been noticing when I get around
[1:22:13] brother Rob I go to feeling
[1:22:16] funny maybe you wore the wrong shoes to
[1:22:20] church maybe you got an evil spirit on
[1:22:22] you
[1:22:23] or I I I feel I feel I feel your
[1:22:26] feelings will lie to
[1:22:29] you well I wish somebody preaching don't
[1:22:32] worry if we don't get done tonight we'll
[1:22:33] come back tomorrow night and have church
[1:22:38] again well at least 20 of you will be
[1:22:40] back anyway we'll see the rest of you on
[1:22:43] Sunday when the five senses act contrary
[1:22:46] to the word of God then they are
[1:22:51] lying now the the six sense
[1:22:55] cannot
[1:22:57] lie
[1:22:59] wow so the sick sense cannot never never
[1:23:04] has never
[1:23:05] will
[1:23:08] lie praise
[1:23:11] God it's a super
[1:23:14] sense and the super sense is the Holy
[1:23:18] Spirit the face of God
[1:23:23] that dwells in you and if you let the
[1:23:26] five senses be yielded to the six sense
[1:23:30] it'll guide you and bring all the other
[1:23:32] five senses under control so it don't
[1:23:34] mean that we eradicate feeling it don't
[1:23:37] mean we eradicate sight and taste and
[1:23:39] smell but what we do is we run all of
[1:23:41] them through the super sense so if
[1:23:45] you're running your faith through the
[1:23:46] super sense and then God gives you a
[1:23:48] good feeling well glory to God
[1:23:50] hallelujah praise the Lord I'm know it
[1:23:52] so but you know it not from the feeling
[1:23:56] you know it from the super sense itself
[1:23:58] and then the feeling is just a little
[1:24:00] cream on top and you say hallelujah I
[1:24:03] believe God but without this feeling I
[1:24:05] still believe him without any emotion I
[1:24:08] still believe you but when you're
[1:24:10] control right then God can pour out a
[1:24:12] lot of feeling on top of you CU he know
[1:24:15] feeling is not your absolute feeling is
[1:24:17] just a
[1:24:18] blessing oh I love that don't you the
[1:24:22] devil can get into these five
[1:24:26] senses Lord have
[1:24:28] mercy and lie to
[1:24:32] you but listen to this but he cannot
[1:24:37] touch that super
[1:24:40] sense don't you see friends how
[1:24:43] Christians get so mixed up on
[1:24:46] things it never ceases to amaze me how
[1:24:49] many Christians feel led to do this and
[1:24:52] do that and do the other and as a pastor
[1:24:54] you show them the scripture you'll show
[1:24:57] them the message and say look the spirit
[1:24:59] of God would never lead you to break
[1:25:01] this word you know break this scripture
[1:25:03] break all of this but I feel led I feel
[1:25:06] led you see what's happened the devil
[1:25:08] has got into their senses and lied to
[1:25:12] them and they are totally convinced it's
[1:25:15] God but yet it's totally contrary to the
[1:25:18] word but it's so real because the devil
[1:25:22] has got in to their senses and their
[1:25:24] feelings and their emotions and whatever
[1:25:27] more and they won't check it by the word
[1:25:29] look the spirit of God is never afraid
[1:25:31] of the word if the Lord is leading you
[1:25:34] then don't be afraid of scripture don't
[1:25:36] be afraid of the message of the hour if
[1:25:38] it's the Holy Ghost it'll only punctuate
[1:25:40] scripture and punctuate the message of
[1:25:42] the hour if if if that Spirit leading
[1:25:45] you will not receive scripture and the
[1:25:48] message I'm going go and tell you it's a
[1:25:51] devil am
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:56] amen notice this but he cannot touch
[1:25:59] that sup it's far
[1:26:02] beyond his reach so he reaches and he
[1:26:07] reaches he just can't get
[1:26:09] it that come from God it's called
[1:26:14] facei notice again the super sense if
[1:26:16] you hasn't haven't listened to this in a
[1:26:17] while you ought to listen to it Lord I'm
[1:26:19] going to listen to it again tomorrow the
[1:26:21] five senses does not control the six
[1:26:23] sense but the six sense controls the
[1:26:26] five senses the super sense controls the
[1:26:30] natural senses and the five senses see
[1:26:33] taste feel smell here and the super
[1:26:35] sense is something that'll make you
[1:26:37] believe God's word for that's the only
[1:26:40] thing it'll speak about so notice then
[1:26:44] the super sense does not just well I
[1:26:47] think and I believe and I feel and I had
[1:26:49] a dream dreams are good Visions are good
[1:26:52] but many folks have had dreams and been
[1:26:53] totally contrary to the word of God
[1:26:55] people have had visions and been totally
[1:26:58] contrary to the word of God come on
[1:26:59] somebody say Amen but the super sense
[1:27:02] can never leave God's word why it is
[1:27:07] god notice you walk by the six sense you
[1:27:12] talk by the six sense you live by the
[1:27:15] six sense you die by the six sense amen
[1:27:20] and you raised by the six sense
[1:27:23] Hallelujah that super sense something
[1:27:26] that's in you that's different from what
[1:27:28] the natural man is the six senses come
[1:27:32] upon the human being to make them deny
[1:27:36] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:27:38] God listen now what it'll do any symptom
[1:27:42] any symptom that's contrary to God's
[1:27:45] promise the six sense
[1:27:50] says right
[1:27:53] it isn't
[1:27:56] there so how are you going to deny
[1:28:02] migraine how will a six sense of someone
[1:28:05] with terrible horrific pain but the six
[1:28:08] sense will say it's not
[1:28:13] there now y'all I know what some of
[1:28:15] y'all saying and you're saying we're

[1:28:45] years it preach on those Bible stories
[1:28:47] that have produced a rapture we should
[1:28:49] have already had one but we've got to
[1:28:51] have a rapturing message to produce
[1:28:53] rapturing Faith that's why God sent us
[1:28:55] the seventh angel now come on somebody
[1:28:57] say Amen so people say that they believe
[1:28:59] the message of the hour I never even

[1:32:26] they're lying they are
[1:32:28] not the repeating God's word God said
[1:32:34] so that settles it the six sense only
[1:32:38] feeds on the word of God now notice
[1:32:42] brother man talking about the tree that
[1:32:43] the Lord Jesus cursed when he was here
[1:32:45] what did happen the tree had been
[1:32:48] cursed the face of God listen this
[1:32:53] placed against that tree's
[1:32:56] life there was nothing physical you
[1:32:59] could see but way down beneath the Earth
[1:33:02] down in the roots of that tree it's when
[1:33:04] Jesus said cursed be you may no man take
[1:33:08] fruit from you may you not
[1:33:11] live and Jesus was doing that for the
[1:33:14] tree of course because it was a
[1:33:16] reflecting Israel but he was also doing
[1:33:19] it for a type and a shadow of of
[1:33:23] cancer or any other disease from the
[1:33:26] fourth
[1:33:27] dimension notice this death was setting
[1:33:31] in it had been cursed the sick sense had
[1:33:35] come against it it had to die it started
[1:33:39] dying from The Roots it's the same thing
[1:33:42] taking place with the
[1:33:46] cancer it's the same thing takes place
[1:33:48] with a
[1:33:49] tumor the same thing takes place with
[1:33:52] any disease when the sick sense of power
[1:33:56] of the Lord God raises up against it and
[1:33:59] said Satan come out of there you might
[1:34:02] not see no physical condition happen
[1:34:05] right away but their faith holds just
[1:34:08] the same it's been cursed that super
[1:34:11] sense won't let it go it won't pay no
[1:34:14] attention to how you feel how you look
[1:34:17] how you act it won't have one thing to
[1:34:20] do with it God word's been applied the
[1:34:23] sick s takes a hold of it that's all she
[1:34:26] goes to work the CER begins to dwindle
[1:34:29] away it dies from the roots and it's
[1:34:33] gone
[1:34:34] amen and somebody
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:44] said let me share a few testimonies with
[1:34:47] you super sense up here CAD Tabernacle
[1:34:52] when we had the meeting that crippled
[1:34:54] boy that came in there and was prayed
[1:34:56] for him many of you was there to see him
[1:34:58] they brought him back in that emergency
[1:35:00] room Billy led me to him and they had
[1:35:02] him on the platform three or four nights
[1:35:04] in the building didn't get a prayer card
[1:35:06] so they put him in the emergency room
[1:35:07] and I went in there and prayed for him
[1:35:09] looked at him and said Mr Brandon can
[1:35:11] you tell me some
[1:35:13] consolation I said yes sir son polio got
[1:35:17] you this way he said that's right your
[1:35:19] name is such and such you come from a
[1:35:22] certain place that's right he said what
[1:35:24] about my healing I said now listen by
[1:35:29] his stripes you were
[1:35:32] healed AR you notice he tells him his
[1:35:35] name tells him where he come from but
[1:35:38] when it come to the promise of his
[1:35:40] healing notice where he went back to
[1:35:43] right to the
[1:35:44] scripture by his stripes you were healed
[1:35:48] he went home testifying giv giving God
[1:35:52] praise he brought such a
[1:35:56] reproach they claim in the neighborhood
[1:35:59] until one Sunday a group of ministers
[1:36:03] come in and set it down by him and said
[1:36:07] you must stop doing that you're bringing
[1:36:11] a reproach on the colon boy you talking
[1:36:15] about knocking the knocking the wind out
[1:36:17] of your sails a bunch of preachers can
[1:36:20] you imagine now if that happened here in
[1:36:22] our church me and brother bent and

[1:36:38] all know that there ain't no hope for
[1:36:40] you now sister don't you think you're
[1:36:41] going to bring some reproach on brother
[1:36:43] Donnie don't you think that the deacons
[1:36:45] and everybody else that you're really
[1:36:46] going away heav you say well Lord have
[1:36:48] mercy it's it's bad when the devil
[1:36:50] discourages you but when saints of God
[1:36:52] discourage you that's really bad or
[1:36:54] family members I mean knows that the
[1:36:56] truth now notice he said the young man
[1:36:59] sitting there he said

[1:37:08] am and you were in the chair that I'm
[1:37:11] sitting
[1:37:12] in you wouldn't try to rob me of the
[1:37:17] last hope I got in
[1:37:20] Christ
[1:37:22] and said by his
[1:37:24] stripes I am healed he no more than said
[1:37:27] that setting there paralyzed feet hands
[1:37:31] body and back no more than he said it
[1:37:34] out of the chair he went glorifying
[1:37:45] God his natural senses said he'll sit
[1:37:48] there the doctor said he'll be there
[1:37:50] forever as long as he lives but the six
[1:37:53] sense said by his stpes I am healed and
[1:37:57] he wouldn't have nothing to do it's
[1:37:59] casting away everything contrary to what
[1:38:02] God Said one day standing back here on
[1:38:05] top of the hillside at George RS the
[1:38:08] holy spirit said to me rise to your feet
[1:38:11] and I looked and there was a light
[1:38:13] shining onto a dogwood tree and said go
[1:38:16] by the way of Rights or go by the way of
[1:38:18] Carter and when I got there the the Lord
[1:38:21] Jesus had showed her mother a sign that
[1:38:24] I was coming that's talking about little
[1:38:25] Georgie Carter walked into that little
[1:38:28] girl laying on that bed so weak she

[1:39:27] power struck that girl for the first
[1:39:31] time in three years or nine years and 8
[1:39:33] months should been on her

[1:42:33] because the six cense by that same six
[1:42:36] cense three Hebrew children was thrown
[1:42:38] into a fiery furnace they defied the
[1:42:41] Flames of the furnace all reings had
[1:42:44] proed they'd be burnt to death before
[1:42:45] they got to it but the six cents stayed
[1:42:48] him in there two or three hours praise
[1:42:50] praise be to God praise be to God and
[1:42:53] when they open the furnace they seen one
[1:42:55] standing there among them like the Son
[1:42:56] of God that's the sixth sense it was the
[1:43:01] six sense that raised Jesus Christ from
[1:43:06] the
[1:43:09] dead the six sense raised Jesus Christ
[1:43:14] from the
[1:43:16] dead after he laid in the ground because
[1:43:19] he believed the word word of God said
[1:43:22] destroy this body in three days I'll
[1:43:24] raise it up jump on down a little bit to
[1:43:26] the next paragraph by this same sense
[1:43:28] God spoke on there was nothing what is
[1:43:31] that sense that super sense is God the
[1:43:34] faith of God in you the part of God that
[1:43:39] comes into you and gives you the super
[1:43:46] sense now what's absolutely amazing is
[1:43:49] when he preaches this at the Tabernacle
[1:43:52] the service before he preaches the super
[1:43:55] sign and then he comes and preaches a
[1:43:58] super sense we're living in a day of
[1:44:01] super super super but I wonder how many
[1:44:04] of us how many people of the earth want
[1:44:06] this super I
[1:44:08] do brothers let's jump over a little bit
[1:44:10] we'll go to Faith this a six sense in
[1:44:12] chiako paragraph 42 by that same six
[1:44:15] sense was working in little Marca when
[1:44:17] she came to see Jesus raise her brother
[1:44:19] out of the grave after being dead for 4
[1:44:21] days that same six sense cllean the
[1:44:23] leper that same six sense raiseed up
[1:44:26] Jesus Christ on the third day that same
[1:44:29] six sense will Rapture the church
[1:44:36] amen we'll Rapture the church one of
[1:44:39] these days and take it out of here to
[1:44:43] glory is it
[1:44:45] important is it
[1:44:47] important this is what will take us out
[1:44:50] of here here every time we see a Divine
[1:44:53] Healing every time we see a miracle you
[1:44:56] know what it is it's a little foretaste
[1:44:59] of the change of the body so a person
[1:45:02] comes up with an Affliction the sickness
[1:45:04] in the body and the spirit of God will
[1:45:06] change and move it out what was it a
[1:45:09] foretaste of the body change I mention
[1:45:12] it tell you I guess last time I preached
[1:45:14] about John Ryan brother B tells said his
[1:45:17] story here whenever he talks about this
[1:45:19] and the super sense and John Ryan was a
[1:45:22] castle he was a beggar begged on the
[1:45:25] streets and he come up somebody told him
[1:45:27] said want you go up prot that meeting so
[1:45:29] he had some people to bring him up so he
[1:45:32] come up there and the prophet told him
[1:45:33] and said your name is John Ryan said
[1:45:34] that's right said you're a cic that's
[1:45:37] right so he said you've been blind
[1:45:39] you're beggar on the street he said
[1:45:40] that's right so he said what about mahen
[1:45:43] he said by straps your heel he said all
[1:45:46] right praise the Lord so he walked off
[1:45:48] the platform now said happened to it it
[1:45:52] went back in the
[1:45:53] back and he started hollering hey hey
[1:45:57] preacher so he tried to get back up
[1:45:59] through the brother said hey you can't
[1:46:01] do that said yes I'm going back up that
[1:46:02] preacher he prayed for me and I ain't
[1:46:04] heal so brother R said bring him on so
[1:46:08] they bring him at he said hey you told
[1:46:10] me I was healed and he said yes and you
[1:46:13] told me you believe
[1:46:17] me well he said I do but you told me
[1:46:20] still I can't see he said that has not
[1:46:23] one thing to do with
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:26] it so he tells him he's healed and the
[1:46:29] man just emphatically tells him I can't
[1:46:31] seee it that has nothing to do with you
[1:46:33] being
[1:46:35] healed they see how confusing it can be
[1:46:37] to the carnal mind because people what
[1:46:39] the symptoms are still there everything
[1:46:41] is there as a matter of fact it's
[1:46:42] getting worse that has nothing to do
[1:46:44] with it if you have the six
[1:46:47] sense well I don't understand well he
[1:46:50] said you look by his stripes you already
[1:46:52] heal you take him at his word he said
[1:46:54] look sir I'm a Catholic and he said I'm
[1:46:56] taught to believe the word of my priest
[1:46:59] so he said what shall I do he said you
[1:47:01] go off this platform praising God so he
