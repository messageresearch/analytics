[23:01] love you
[23:09] you're this uh isn't going to be
[23:13] easy uh I just kind
[23:15] of I was going to supposed to top out
[23:18] what I was wanting to say but I just
[23:20] didn't have time it's just been so crazy
[23:23] so I just going to kind of start from
[23:25] the beginning and hope everyone
[23:29] understands uh Sunday evening I'd
[23:32] finally got home and was actually
[23:33] sitting in uh my recliner I had a bag of
[23:37] ice on my jaw my jaws have been out of
[23:40] whack so if I talk a little funny that's
[23:43] why that is and and Caroline called me
[23:44] said dad said you did you remember to
[23:46] get the stakes for the scarecrows young
[23:48] people were going to uh put together
[23:50] scarecrows for the Fall Festival Sunday
[23:53] and I said no Caroline I forgot I said
[23:54] I'll I'll take off right now so I went
[23:57] to Lowe's and came back and delivered
[23:59] them and there was some trucks up at the
[24:01] church and they were loading up and so
[24:03] we kind of came up here and uh if I
[24:06] understand it right brother Mark mcel
[24:09] had went trying to get to his um place
[24:12] of work over in Burnsville and
[24:15] apparently couldn't make it and they
[24:16] were on the back roads and came up on
[24:19] some men and they said nobody had been
[24:22] to them no contact or nothing and they
[24:25] needed supplies bad so Mark had arranged
[24:29] that and we sent out four trucks Sunday
[24:33] afternoon probably around 7:30 or 8: at
[24:36] night and to the they drove over to the
[24:39] community of popper it's Mitchell County
[24:41] it's been hit really
[24:43] bad and uh I think it was either that
[24:48] evening or the next next day I said Mark
[24:51] I said you want me to share it on the
[24:52] church Facebook and I did and I think I
[24:55] even posted it just on Facebook itself
[24:59] and uh from
[25:01] there we we have turned into a uh well
[25:06] we're not major we're just doing what we
[25:08] can but a
[25:10] major drop off and supplyment for the
[25:14] communities that nobody is going to
[25:17] we're we're trying to get back into the
[25:19] valleys the mountains where nobody's
[25:23] going to help these communities they
[25:24] can't get out so if nobody gets to them
[25:27] they're hurting really bad and brother
[25:29] Aaron Gil and the and the brothers
[25:31] they've been taking equipment out and uh
[25:34] I don't know if you've been seeing the
[25:36] pictures uh I've been posting they uh
[25:40] went to one community and the bridge was
[25:42] just totally full of trees and
[25:45] everything nobody could get out and they
[25:48] actually went over and and cleared that
[25:51] bridge for that Community it's actually
[25:54] from right here it's 15 ft taller than
[25:58] in our building 60 ft tall there was
[26:01] trees all over the top some of the trees
[26:03] were that big and they said a church
[26:06] went over that
[26:07] bridge so that tells you the devastation
[26:10] that the communities are are seeing and
[26:13] we found out um is either I can't
[26:16] remember you forgive me that it's been
[26:18] hectic either today or yesterday evening
[26:21] the the bridge that the brothers cleared
[26:23] they found uh four bodies under it that
[26:27] the brothers had worked on
[26:29] uh yesterday so it's just and they've
[26:32] been doing a tremendous job just going
[26:34] out where nobody can and that's and it's
[26:37] just been overwhelming we' we've never
[26:40] done nothing like this uh this is we've
[26:43] never had a facility like this to do it
[26:46] so this is the really the first time
[26:48] we've been able to help our
[26:51] community and uh it it's been
[26:56] amazing what social media can do and uh
[27:00] the number of people that have
[27:03] been donating to our Vin
[27:07] Mo and uh I just switched over to the
[27:10] church today but it's just been
[27:12] phenomenal I got a text from a lady
[27:15] today said this is my contribution from
[27:17] California God bless you all $1,000 you
[27:20] know and and uh a lady contacted me from
[27:25] Kentucky she said we see what you're all
[27:27] doing cuz nobody body is really going
[27:29] into the back Parts you know they've got
[27:31] the center set up which is great but you
[27:34] have to go there to get the supplies and
[27:37] we're trying to get back to the people
[27:39] that can't get out to get the supplies
[27:41] It's really hurting and a lot of people
[27:43] have seen that and U I had another lady
[27:47] uh contact me from Christiansburg and
[27:49] she said I want to do a fundraising up
[27:52] here uh for you guys and I said yeah
[27:55] that'd be great so you know we may have
[27:57] to go get the stuff I don't know if
[27:58] somebody could bring it down if they do
[28:00] that but we're starting to get it's
[28:02] starting to get pretty major for our
[28:04] little church and and it's really I I've
[28:08] been I went out Monday and to buy
[28:12] supplies to send out and I got over to
[28:15] Walmart and I said golly I need people
[28:17] to help me shop so I put on the Facebook
[28:20] so these people came in I said you go
[28:22] this you go get that you go get get
[28:24] buggies just fill your buggy full and
[28:26] you know and I emptied out the men's
[28:28] socks and men's underwear you know and
[28:29] everybody's looking at you you know and
[28:31] there was a lady there she said uh are
[28:34] you all helping people and I said yeah I
[28:36] said well this is actually getting ready
[28:38] we're getting ready to take a load to
[28:40] popper she said Mitchell County North
[28:42] she yeah she said that's where I from
[28:44] she said we had to flee we're having to
[28:46] stay over here and she said my kids are
[28:48] sick there's no doctors there's nothing
[28:50] over there and she just couldn't believe
[28:51] it we were getting ready to send a
[28:52] shipment over there and uh we went in
[28:57] the brothers took that first load and I
[28:58] went in the next day a couple of us and
[29:00] took some loads and it it's like a war
[29:02] zone I mean just unless you get out into
[29:04] the mountains and stuff and we were just
[29:06] standing there looking and it it it had
[29:09] to be a tornado way the mountain was
[29:10] just cut off all the trees were just
[29:12] leveled halfway up the top so it's
[29:14] tornadoes that came through a lot of
[29:16] those places and just devastated I mean
[29:17] there just you're trying to get down the
[29:19] road and they already had that road
[29:20] cleared down to the bottom but after
[29:22] that you couldn't get to the community
[29:24] and um it was just tree after tree after
[29:26] tree cut and so you know there's so many
[29:29] more places that they we still can't get
[29:32] into yet
[29:35] so it's a it's turning into a bigger
[29:37] operation and uh brother Ben and him
[29:40] brother Daniel we've got tractor trailer
[29:42] loads of water coming in next week for
[29:44] people so it it's starting to get bigger
[29:48] and bigger and flowing into the
[29:50] weeks
[29:53] and that's where it
[29:55] um kind of hits the Fall Festival
[30:00] and uh it been laying real heavy on my
[30:03] heart cuz I know what a blessing he is
[30:06] everybody
[30:09] but when you see our community and what
[30:13] the people was going through it just
[30:15] they're devastated you know I talked to
[30:18] brother Donnie and he said well you know
[30:20] he said this is the first time we've
[30:22] been able to help our
[30:23] community and uh he said I think that is
[30:26] a whole lot more important
[30:28] in the Fall Festival at this time you
[30:30] [Applause]
[30:43] know so we talked and I I told him
[30:46] that's what had been laying heavy on my
[30:47] heart I just didn't feel right having it
[30:50] when so much suffering is going on and
[30:52] we're in the middle of helping people
[30:56] survive you know and and it's just
[30:58] getting bigger and bigger for us to to
[31:00] help people and I just I just I weighed
[31:02] the balance and it just didn't didn't
[31:03] come out right so I hope you forgive me
[31:06] you know and maybe we can try to have it
[31:09] something later I don't know but
[31:12] uh you know in the Bible uh the little
[31:16] lady that
[31:17] brought gave her money and Jesus told
[31:20] her she'd gave more than
[31:22] all there was a little sister come up to
[31:25] me before church
[31:32] $468 she emptied her piggy
[31:35] bank you know and that's that's what
[31:38] it's that's what it's all about that's
[31:40] what that's what we're here for it's you
[31:42] know we're Christians but we're here to
[31:45] help everyone Christian non-Christian
[31:47] whoever they are if they're a human they
[31:50] deserve help you know and and that's
[31:53] what we're trying to do and U I don't I
[31:56] don't I hope I've
[31:58] understood what I tried to said tonight
[32:00] but uh we're still continuing uh
[32:03] receiving donations and but uh it's a we
[32:08] actually had to slow down today
[32:09] everybody's wore out I mean some of us
[32:11] put in 16 hours Monday and the brother's
[32:13] going out and working all day and
[32:14] getting in at night and um so if you can
[32:19] share you know our post the the
[32:22] donations is what's keeping us going and
[32:24] we had to slow down a little bit today
[32:26] because we we really got in the hole we
[32:29] were like $4,000 in the hole but we came
[32:32] out today and uh some people started
[32:35] fundraising for us and getting some more
[32:38] more money in but it's you know you say
[32:40] well you all received a lot of money but
[32:42] like yesterday we sent out over
[32:45] $115,000 of supplies in one day and so
[32:49] that don't last very long you know we go
[32:51] out I go out shopping and the trucks
[32:53] bring it in it's gone that day and we
[32:56] have to figure out okay what we going to
[32:57] do for the next day so the word is
[32:59] getting out and I think there's more and
[33:02] more churches uh going to start helping
[33:04] us so that that that's what keeps us
[33:06] going you know but we're just trying to
[33:09] do all we can and
[33:14] uh just doing what God's leading us to
[33:16] do so I hope you hope everyone
[33:19] understands and if we can't do anything
[33:21] reschedule
[33:23] it we'll look forward to it next year so
[33:26] God bless everybody I I really
[33:27] appreciate the help everybody's come in
[33:31] I mean like I said I was at Walmart and
[33:33] I got standing there and I said man I
[33:35] need help I came back I was I was
[33:37] planning on the stuff with God to just
[33:38] start separating myself the sisters were
[33:41] here already set up tables and was
[33:44] separating the stuff you know not even
[33:47] contacting anybody so it's it's been a
[33:50] learning curve our first time doing this
[33:53] type of thing and uh but every
[33:56] everything's just really fell into place
[33:58] and and we we've had to learn really
[34:00] quick but I just want to say I really
[34:03] appreciate everybody that has jumped in
[34:05] and helped I mean people's come in it's
[34:07] it's just been amazing there was a
[34:10] couple came in they were with a rafting
[34:12] company an hour east of chattano they
[34:15] couldn't find their home base they were
[34:16] taking supplies or something to us and
[34:18] they seen our signs out front chrisa
[34:20] made and put out and they come in and
[34:23] gave us their
[34:24] donations and they said they may said
[34:26] we're going to contact the other people
[34:28] so that night I left and uh Caroline
[34:32] College said there's some people here
[34:33] from the same rafting
[34:35] company and uh they couldn't find it so
[34:38] they bring in a tremendous amount next
[34:41] day the same company some guy bring in a
[34:44] Trailer Load of
[34:45] supplies so the Lord's blessing us and
[34:49] it's just tremendous to see
[34:51] everything going on and and working and
[34:54] the amount of people uh donating has has
[34:58] been a a phenomenal but uh you know I
[35:02] found out in something like this that's
[35:04] what keeps it going is is the money so
[35:07] but uh God bless you all and we'll just
[35:10] see what happens from here and see if we
[35:13] can do anything if not we'll we'll just
[35:14] try it again next year but I I really
[35:16] think this is just more important for
[35:18] our community what we're going through
[35:19] because people can't even hardly
[35:21] accesses that would be com from North
[35:23] Carolina South Carolina and Georgia so
[35:26] it it was just a
[35:28] uh would be a big hindrance for a lot of
[35:29] people and I know people's got plane
[35:31] tickets in Canada and Arizona so we're
[35:34] just trying to get the word out as quick
[35:36] as we we could so I hate to be you know
[35:40] the bear bad news but I think that over
[35:43] there far outweighs the Fall Festival
[35:45] right now so God bless you all
[35:59] [Applause]
[36:07] well praise the
[36:08] Lord just to kind of bring a little bit
[36:11] of detail into what brother Michael was
[36:12] saying and then uh we'll go right on
[36:14] into the service but as Michael said
[36:17] this all started uh from a simple phone
[36:20] call of a friend in need when brother
[36:21] Mark went over there seen the need to
[36:23] kind of how it it got started um and I
[36:27] just want to bring a few things out here
[36:29] to point out what's been done what's
[36:30] been accomplished we've been the first
[36:32] people on the ground in eight different
[36:34] communities uh we believe that there's
[36:36] been over 100 people whose lives have
[36:38] been saved because of the
[36:41] effort as of yesterday evening
[36:45] um the ground crew went out up towards I
[36:48] believe it was up towards Mountain
[36:50] City let me see this right
[36:53] here large work crew headed down to
[36:55] Jenkin Hollow area and then up into
[36:56] Mountain City here's what they reported
[36:59] we loaded five to six dumps off of
[37:00] Jenkins Hollow we left towards the other
[37:02] side of the mountain City and cleared a
[37:04] block Creek so that the home owners
[37:06] could access their homes easier we also
[37:08] checked on my friend's Papa that lives
[37:09] near there and got him some food and
[37:11] some water on the delivery side it's
[37:13] people taking food taking supplies water
[37:16] medical needs uh toiletries and
[37:19] different things like that uh there's
[37:20] been two trucks of supplies that's went
[37:22] into the new the North Carolina area
[37:24] they were the first ones to ever show up
[37:26] there and they was saying that when the
[37:28] team took the stuff into the in there to
[37:31] newand that the people just started
[37:32] crying they just started crying because
[37:34] nobody nobody had been there to help
[37:36] them at all and so when they saw that
[37:38] truck pull in with water you can imagine
[37:40] if you had no water and you had none of
[37:42] this and all of a sudden somebody showed
[37:43] up it it would really bring tears to
[37:45] your eyes we delivered six trucks to
[37:47] Burnsville North Carolina area took them
[37:50] to the Altech plant for further
[37:51] distribution into the community
[37:53] delivered two trucks of supplies to the
[37:54] little Milligan area were the first ones
[37:56] to show up with supplies for those
[37:58] people delivered three trucks supplies
[38:00] to the trade Tennessee area were the
[38:02] first ones to show up with supplies for
[38:03] those people in this area we able to
[38:05] deliver a generators of the people in

[38:40] things that we have done and you say
[38:42] well you know I've not been able to help
[38:43] so what we would like to do this evening
[38:45] just before we go into the services is
[38:47] to lift an offering that this offering
[38:49] will be used to uh buy gas buy food
[38:52] water whatever would be needed to help
[38:55] these people get back up on their feet

[38:58] back from the area said the pictures
[38:59] that you're seeing don't even do
[39:01] justice it's just from it's

[39:06] sat I was down in Missouri in the
[39:08] meetings and when all this began to
[39:09] happen and was looking at it and I just
[39:12] wept and the brother said are you okay
[39:14] and I said I'm just so burdened for the
[39:15] people up our way but this is one way we
[39:18] can help and if you if you don't have

[46:27] [Music]
[46:33] I I I personally saw something about the
[46:35] people in my church that I've never seen
[46:37] before I saw young men working like dogs
[46:41] just trying to clear roads trying to get
[46:43] supplies to people paying for their own
[46:45] gas their own Vehicles their own time I
[46:47] saw sisters preparing meals um doing Sho
[46:51] and putting everything together just
[46:53] just working so hard I saw brother Daryl
[46:55] Brother Louie
[46:57] um um brother Rocky Ward just so many
[47:01] people from all age groups I mean it was
[47:04] just uh you know it's it's it's good to
[47:07] have uh a faith like we've got but
[47:10] sometimes you got to we this
[47:13] world it needs a Jesus with some skin on
[47:16] it and H and Word of Life we we got to
[47:19] have some skin in the game you know we
[47:21] we we can't be separated from our
[47:24] community this is these are
[47:27] this is our this is our group but at the
[47:29] same time this is our community people
[47:31] that we rub shoulders with people are
[47:33] hurting so bad myself got to to make
[47:36] contact with um a lady when at the
[47:40] bridge that he was mentioning and and
[47:41] knowing that those bodies were under
[47:42] that bridge kills me because more than
[47:44] anything that's what I wanted to do
[47:48] because my own brother
[47:53] drowned I just can't stand the thought
[47:55] of that
[47:59] but even in the darkest of
[48:02] hours he is still
[48:04] God he's the same yesterday today and
[48:07] forever he is still
[48:10] alive his power is just as great as it's
[48:13] ever been uh his Mercy is just as great
[48:17] as it's ever been I know because his
[48:20] Mercy was new to me this morning when I
[48:22] got up his Mercy was dealing with my
[48:24] heart personally in the in the back here
[48:27] about things in my own life he is still
[48:30] God what could he do tonight forget
[48:33] about everything that's going on let's
[48:35] focus on tonight let let let tonight let
[48:38] let it just be a refuge from what we've
[48:39] been dealing with all week tonight could
[48:42] be your night tonight could be your
[48:44] night young person that you get filled
[48:47] with the Holy Ghost it don't have to be
[48:49] Sunday it don't have to be when brother
[48:51] Donnie's here or brother Daryl which I'd
[48:53] much rather him being up here just to be
[48:54] honest with you it don't have to be that
[48:57] way you could be delivered today of
[48:59] something that's been in your life
[49:00] that's just dragging you down and and
[49:03] you feel like it's going to take you
[49:04] under you could be healed today of that
[49:07] thing that's just uh that that nagging
[49:09] thing I've got things I've got a
[49:11] shoulder that doctors say is is uh is
[49:13] permanently disabled I don't want that
[49:15] and I ain't going to settle for that I
[49:17] could be healed tonight tonight could be
[49:20] my night it could be your night
[49:23] tonight amen tonight could be the night
[49:26] that he fills your heart with peace with
[49:28] all that's going on in this world today
[49:30] tonight could be the night that he
[49:32] restores your joy maybe so if you just
[49:35] got a I got a little cold on him tonight
[49:37] could be your night so let's not let
[49:39] this pass tonight Word of Life Church
[49:42] give him everything that you've got
[49:44] right now while you have this
[49:48] opportunity and let's go out let's live
[49:51] our faith let's live our faith Let's
[49:53] help our communities let's love our
[49:56] fellow men I I I tell a little story
[49:58] about Brother Louie um we say we give a
[50:00] rose while while some while they're
[50:02] still here with us I worked at a
[50:04] security post years ago and I got to
[50:06] talking to a guy and he was telling me a
[50:08] story about his testimony he got to ask
[50:11] him where I was where I went to church
[50:12] and I told him where I go to church at
[50:14] and he said well tell me some people
[50:16] that go there he said I don't don't
[50:17] recognize the name I said we got a whole
[50:19] lot of yanes I can tell you that you
[50:21] know I said got a lot of Babs and and I
[50:24] just got telling him some names and I
[50:25] said I said well our song leader you
[50:27] might recognize him everybody knows him
[50:29] I said his name is Louis blevens he said
[50:30] get out of town Lou bevens is your song
[50:32] leader I said yes he's our song Lead
[50:35] said let me tell you about that man he
[50:36] said that man changed my life he was he
[50:39] was my little league baseball coach did
[50:41] you coach Andy's baseball team he was my
[50:44] little league baseball coach and he said
[50:46] the way that man lived and the way that
[50:47] man treated us the life that I saw in
[50:50] him when I went down into drugs as an
[50:53] adult that life that I saw in that man
[50:56] is what pulled me out that was his
[50:58] testimony to
[51:00] me you never know what the what you're
[51:03] doing right now the impact that it could
[51:05] have on somebody else's
[51:07] life amen amen

[51:28] was nervous I'm not now I get excited
[51:31] there's a point where you get excited
[51:32] you just have to find that level between
[51:34] excited and control and it can be hard
[51:36] to do sometimes but I want to talk to
[51:38] you tonight about a little thought
[51:39] called just about what is Faith I think
[51:42] it might be appropriate for what we're
[51:43] dealing with right now what is Faith
[51:46] amen Hebrews chap 11 verse
[51:50] 1 now Faith is the substance of things
[51:53] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[51:56] Seen

[51:59] heads Lord Jesus once again your people
[52:02] are assembled together in this place um

[52:27] gift in my life help me to step aside

[53:05] any service that they that they're
[53:07] having and they're going to be talking
[53:08] about it they're going to be preaching
[53:09] about it it uh faith is the foundation
[53:11] of every Doctrine it's the foundation of
[53:14] every and it's the key to every blessing
[53:16] that we have it's uh the scripture
[53:18] teaches us that by Grace you're saved
[53:20] through faith um healing Deliverance
[53:23] Revelation all these things come by
[53:25] faith
[53:26] even here in our own message the a lot
[53:28] of our themes and our theme songs and
[53:30] and things of that nature are all
[53:32] they're all built around Faith um we
[53:34] think about brother brandom's favorite
[53:36] song only believe um the angel of the
[53:38] Lord really loved that song only believe
[53:40] what is it talking about faith it's
[53:42] speaking about faith um the campaign
[53:45] slogan Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ the
[53:48] same yesterday today and forever
[53:50] speaking about a faith in in a God that
[53:53] can do exactly what he did 2,000 years
[53:56] ago it's speaking about that same God of
[53:59] faith in that same God today uh I think
[54:02] about uh even in the message brother
[54:04] Bram I I I I I searched this before it
[54:06] came out
[54:08] 13,16 times that I see that he mentioned
[54:12] Faith 1481 times that he mentioned bride
[54:16] um just just to give you a little
[54:17] perspective faith is so important to us
[54:21] but there's a difference and here's what
[54:22] I want what I want to get into there's a
[54:25] difference in having faith and having a
[54:29] faith you understand what I'm saying
[54:31] there's a difference in having faith and
[54:33] having a faith we've all heard the
[54:35] expression my faith my faith won't allow
[54:37] me to eat a certain food my faith won't
[54:40] allow me to wear certain clothes my
[54:43] faith won't allow me to do this my faith
[54:45] dictates that I have to do this thing
[54:47] and it's spoken of almost it's almost
[54:49] like it's almost like a rule book a code
[54:51] of rules rules to live by uh like a
[54:54] belief system is that is is that friend
[54:57] is that what faith is is Faith just a
[55:00] bunch of dos and don'ts that we abide by
[55:03] uh the these things that we the these
[55:05] things that we follow is it just a
[55:08] belief system which is just a a belief
[55:11] system is just a set of principles that
[55:13] guide life there's over 4,200 religions
[55:16] in the world that I that that when when
[55:18] I Google that's what it told me anyway
[55:19] over 4200 religions all belief systems
[55:23] all of them have a code of conduct a a
[55:26] standard that that that the people have
[55:28] to live by thousands of them and
[55:30] thousands of them philosophies you have
[55:32] people that believe in believe in that
[55:33] the universe is God and people the the
[55:36] the the I think it's the Hindu or the
[55:38] Buddhist belief of uh of karma what
[55:40] comes around goes around type of stuff
[55:42] we have all kinds of belief systems in
[55:45] in in in in in our world in America we
[55:48] got a different type of religion called
[55:50] politics you know you're either maggot
[55:53] or you're
[55:54] liberal am I right
[55:57] you and and people talk about this stuff
[55:59] like they're talking about it's coming
[56:00] from the Bible For Heaven's Sake you
[56:02] know I've got my own political opinions
[56:04] but I ain't crazy enough to think that
[56:07] that that you know I think
[56:09] about I don't want to say anything too
[56:11] much but I think about how we're talking
[56:13] about making America great again I can't
[56:15] understand how any message folk could
[56:16] get it in your head that we're going to
[56:17] make this country great again the word
[56:19] of God has already been spoken we I love
[56:22] my country I expressed that the last
[56:23] time I talked to you I'm very patriotic
[56:25] I express that the last time I talked to
[56:27] you but we are not going to make this
[56:29] country great in
[56:34] the is that what our faith is is that
[56:37] all just a code is it a code to live by
[56:40] a code of ethics I promise I'm just
[56:42] building a little background and then
[56:43] we're going to go is it just a moral
[56:45] code of ethics that we uh or guidelines
[56:48] that we follow you know like the Rich
[56:50] Young Ruler John mentioned on Sunday he
[56:53] had a code of ethics called The Ten
[56:55] Commandments that we all believe we all
[56:57] believe that's
[56:58] true but this young man had this code
[57:01] that he lived by and this this young man
[57:03] came running to Jesus he came running he
[57:06] wasn't walking laad desically this young
[57:08] man was very
[57:10] sincere he came running to Jesus he
[57:13] knelt before Jesus showing great respect
[57:16] for the for him called him good Master
[57:20] letting you know he understood who this
[57:22] was only one is good and that is God and
[57:25] here he's telling him good Master what
[57:27] may I do that I may inherit eternal life
[57:31] that was that young man's problem right
[57:33] there he's he's a rich young man he
[57:35] thought it was something that could be
[57:36] passed down to him he wanted a religion
[57:39] he wanted a Faith with no death to
[57:45] self Jesus said scripture says Jesus
[57:48] looked at him and loved him love that
[57:50] boy that's a good young man he kept the
[57:53] word Jesus he he says what can I do that
[57:55] I inherit and Jesus says you know the
[57:57] Commandments keep them you know the what
[57:59] the word says keep the Commandments he
[58:01] says I've done them all my life from my
[58:04] youth he said I've kept the word of
[58:06] God and Jesus didn't correct him the
[58:08] word corrects the error Jesus didn't
[58:11] correct that boy that was some young man
[58:13] standing before Jesus Christ right there
[58:16] but all he had was a code of conduct he
[58:19] had a religion he had a faith but he did
[58:23] not have faith in the word of God he did
[58:25] not have faith Faith otherwise this
[58:27] young man would have yielded his life
[58:29] right there in the presence of
[58:32] God Jesus said you're lacking one thing
[58:36] and that young man when Jesus told him
[58:37] went away
[58:38] sad because he didn't want a
[58:42] faith that involved death to self and I
[58:45] think about our young men you know I
[58:47] love you guys I really do I get around y
[58:50] get around y'all working this week my
[58:51] goodness I get around you and I feel
[58:53] like I'm a young man again and then I
[58:55] wake up the next day and I realize that
[58:57] I'm
[58:58] not I did I was chucking logs the other
[59:01] day I'm cutting branches and I was
[59:03] having a time brother brother josi we we
[59:05] did we were I just felt like a young man
[59:07] again I love I love my young Brothers
[59:11] but let me say something to you to
[59:13] follow Jesus Christ you're there's going
[59:16] to have to be a death to self and he's
[59:18] going to ask you many times for that
[59:20] thing that is the hardest for you to
[59:22] give up you know like this young man was
[59:24] his wealth and I think about so many
[59:26] times our young men I I think about how
[59:29] I just just what I say we're Sports
[59:31] church here at Happy Valley is what I've
[59:32] heard people say uh Sports can be
[59:35] something football let me say that
[59:37] football there's not not nothing wrong
[59:38] with a game but many times if that thing
[59:41] is consuming you if that's the thing
[59:43] that consumes you we can enjoy things I
[59:45] enjoy things I like Hunting Fishing
[59:48] exercising Woodwork and all kinds of
[59:50] things but if that thing is what you are
[59:54] that thing defines you that is what you
[59:56] speak about every time you get around
[59:58] people if that is consuming
[1:00:01] you maybe Jesus is Calling to you you
[1:00:04] might need to lay that thing
[1:00:06] aside you know you young sisters your
[1:00:10] beauty sometimes can be the thing that
[1:00:12] just pulls you it'll make you cross the
[1:00:15] lines that you know you I don't know why
[1:00:16] we're going this way make you cross them
[1:00:19] lines because it's just it's that thing
[1:00:21] that you've got that thing that's
[1:00:23] special it's that thing that gets you
[1:00:24] attention and then you see yourself just
[1:00:26] getting pulled right across that line in
[1:00:29] in across the line of the
[1:00:33] word we don't have a
[1:00:37] faith we have the
[1:00:42] faith you know in in our country now
[1:00:44] there's another
[1:00:46] code another another religion called the
[1:00:49] wokeness code that has kind of kind of
[1:00:51] took over it's a little they call it a
[1:00:52] higher moral code of living they nothing
[1:00:55] but a of Pharisees it's all based on
[1:00:58] emotion it's all based on their feelings
[1:01:00] and saying if you disagree with me you
[1:01:02] hate me you uh um if you don't if you
[1:01:05] don't agree with everything that I say
[1:01:06] you're a bigot it's it's a it's there
[1:01:08] nothing but a bunch of a bunch of
[1:01:10] Pharisees and that same thing has crept
[1:01:13] around it can't it's crept around in in
[1:01:15] in our doors to the point people we saw
[1:01:18] people start getting enlightened of a
[1:01:19] higher way you know uh people walking
[1:01:22] away people getting away is brother l i
[1:01:25] just some of the stuff he says that's
[1:01:26] going on with ministers I just blows my
[1:01:28] mind I'm glad I don't hear this stuff
[1:01:30] it's good to be a nobody sometimes um
[1:01:33] the the ministers the things that they
[1:01:34] say about quoting the prophet and
[1:01:35] getting away from these things and
[1:01:37] talking about the Liberty in it well let
[1:01:39] me ask you this you those people who
[1:01:42] walked away from this where has your
[1:01:44] Enlightenment taken you
[1:01:46] today where is the victory in your life
[1:01:49] today where are your children today what
[1:01:52] kind of condition are they in how is
[1:01:54] your marriage doing now that you left
[1:01:56] the
[1:01:57] word and found another
[1:02:02] Faith they just a church Creed is just
[1:02:05] it all is a church Creed is something
[1:02:07] that dictates church membership this is
[1:02:09] what I got to do to be a part of the
[1:02:11] group and the message is no different
[1:02:13] we're no different we we got the the the
[1:02:15] God sent a prophet and that makes me
[1:02:17] okay that I got to have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:19] to see the message to believe the
[1:02:20] message um in Word of Life it comes down
[1:02:23] to us too just because you believe
[1:02:24] brother Donnie's a man of God and you
[1:02:26] love to sit and listen to him preach
[1:02:28] that that don't give you the Holy Ghost
[1:02:30] nothing replaces the Holy Ghost you must
[1:02:33] be filled with the Holy Ghost you will
[1:02:35] not go in the Rapture without the Holy
[1:02:39] Ghost brother B himself said don't just
[1:02:41] believe say I believe the message he
[1:02:43] said you obey the message come into
[1:02:46] Christ die to yourself be filled with
[1:02:49] the Holy Ghost let this life live
[1:02:52] through you
[1:02:58] this an odd this is an odd topic for a
[1:03:01] day like
[1:03:02] today the faith not a faith is spoken of
[1:03:06] in
[1:03:08] scripture Malachi 4 itself says be
[1:03:11] behold I sent unto you Elijah the
[1:03:13] prophet and he's going to turn your
[1:03:14] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[1:03:18] amen we see Paul teaching the the new
[1:03:20] Believers and the church is being
[1:03:22] established in the faith um there's and
[1:03:25] Paul and Barnabas exhorting the
[1:03:27] Believers to continue in the faith Jude
[1:03:30] telling us to earnestly contend for the
[1:03:33] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:03:35] Saints I now I ask you is the faith that
[1:03:38] was once delivered to the Saints is it
[1:03:40] just doctrines is it just things that we
[1:03:42] believe like water baptism in the name
[1:03:45] of Jesus Christ I believe that's right
[1:03:47] don't you is it just believing in the
[1:03:50] there is a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:52] which we do believe in is it believing
[1:03:54] is it just in believing that that we we
[1:03:58] believe in preaching the gospel in a
[1:03:59] five-fold Ministry in the power of God
[1:04:02] in
[1:04:03] Holiness on the inside and the outside
[1:04:06] is it just in in believing the
[1:04:08] revelations of the church ages our young
[1:04:11] people can teach they could probably
[1:04:12] teach you the church ages better than I
[1:04:14] could I can't remember nothing I can't
[1:04:15] remember what I had for breakfast this
[1:04:16] morning and that's not a joke um they
[1:04:19] could teach the Seven Seals the godhead
[1:04:22] we understand the godhead we understand
[1:04:24] election predestination we understand
[1:04:27] that we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:30] with genes that literally came from God
[1:04:32] not something separate not a a separate
[1:04:35] something that that he created and put
[1:04:37] in us but literally genes of God with a
[1:04:40] deposit from God himself living living
[1:04:43] with within us as as the
[1:04:46] elect is just believing that is that the
[1:04:50] faith that we're talking
[1:04:53] about is it believing the
[1:04:56] Mysteries serpent seed was one of the
[1:04:58] first ones I mean when I started to when
[1:05:00] I started seeing serpent seed my
[1:05:01] goodness that one blew my mind I mean um
[1:05:04] when you start seeing it just popping
[1:05:06] out of the out of the scripture you know
[1:05:08] and you just Trace that Antichrist
[1:05:10] spirit all the way down through the
[1:05:11] through time and we can see it today we
[1:05:13] see it in our own ranks and um all these
[1:05:16] things yes they do make up the
[1:05:20] faith but is that what God requires is
[1:05:23] that the faith that God requires for us
[1:05:27] to make it into Rapture is that the
[1:05:29] faith that God requires for us to have
[1:05:31] victory in our lives to have victory in
[1:05:33] our homes to overcome sin to overcome
[1:05:37] self is that the faith that's going to
[1:05:39] see us through I believe these things
[1:05:41] are true
[1:05:44] I these things alone are just knowledge
[1:05:47] and education to his
[1:05:49] friends and education ain't the same as
[1:05:52] experience you know we hear the saying
[1:05:54] knowledge is power all the time and I
[1:05:57] and I'm not saying it's a bad thing I
[1:05:58] appreciate the knowledge you know but
[1:06:02] we've become better educated Believers
[1:06:05] um than we've ever been naturally and
[1:06:07] spiritually um we're better dressed
[1:06:09] people than when when I first came in
[1:06:11] you know we we we look better in society
[1:06:14] now we're more well spoken we got more
[1:06:17] things than we've ever got had before we
[1:06:19] got more money we got more possessions
[1:06:22] we s we and we we say so many times
[1:06:24] we're blessed I'm not goodness I'm am
[1:06:26] not trying to scold you I Don't Preach
[1:06:27] like this good
[1:06:31] night we say we're blessed but why is it
[1:06:34] we when we say we're blessed we're only
[1:06:37] talking about the things that we we've
[1:06:38] been given the money the possessions the
[1:06:41] things that we get to do why are we not
[1:06:43] saying why am blessed because the grace
[1:06:46] of God has changed my life I've been
[1:06:49] filled with the Holy Ghost the word of
[1:06:52] God has been revealed to me
[1:06:56] the purpose of the of the Gospel is not
[1:06:59] to make us a better class of people the
[1:07:02] purpose of the Gospel is to change your
[1:07:07] life the purpose of the Gospel is to set
[1:07:10] you
[1:07:11] free to give each and every one of us
[1:07:14] overcoming
[1:07:16] power to open your eyes to see who you
[1:07:19] are as Sons and Daughters of
[1:07:23] God Amen
[1:07:26] second Timothy chapter 3 warned
[1:07:28] us you know there would be people that
[1:07:30] ever learning never able to come to the
[1:07:32] knowledge of the truth in the last days
[1:07:34] now there's two kinds of knowledge
[1:07:36] there's knowledge of me I can tell you
[1:07:38] something and now you know it and then
[1:07:40] there's an intimate type of knowledge
[1:07:42] like as the scripture says and Adam knew
[1:07:44] his wife Eve and she conceived there's
[1:07:46] an intimate knowledge a relationship
[1:07:48] that produces a life there's two
[1:07:51] different we're talking about two
[1:07:52] different types of
[1:07:53] knowledge there are two different types
[1:07:55] of Truth there is there are truths and
[1:07:59] there is the
[1:08:01] truth Jesus said I am the way I am the
[1:08:06] truth and I am the
[1:08:08] life the truth is not doctrines it is
[1:08:11] not these things these Mysteries the all
[1:08:14] these things that we understand and
[1:08:15] believe the truth is the person of the
[1:08:18] Lord Jesus Christ Living in you and
[1:08:21] living in me
[1:08:27] knowledge of the truth not truths my
[1:08:31] goodness I Don't Preach like this
[1:08:32] friends don't think I'm balling you out
[1:08:33] my goodness
[1:08:38] gracious Hebrews 11 again faith is the
[1:08:42] substance of things hoped
[1:08:44] for the evidence of Things Not Seen now
[1:08:47] substance is something that is
[1:08:50] possessed I've got it it's mine
[1:08:56] the evidence of Things Not Seen evidence
[1:08:59] is proof it's something that I got faith
[1:09:02] is something that I've got it's
[1:09:04] something that every one of you got that
[1:09:07] proves his word to be true it we
[1:09:09] literally possess it and it gives us the
[1:09:12] the ability it gives us the power to
[1:09:14] make the word of God live in our
[1:09:18] lives faith is a lived it is a LIF lived
[1:09:23] yes sir brother Brenham said your faith
[1:09:25] is what God sees in you your works is
[1:09:28] what other people see in you your works
[1:09:30] is what tells people that that that's
[1:09:32] what told I almost said his name that
[1:09:34] what told that man that Louis belev are
[1:09:37] something special about that man he saw
[1:09:39] he saw brother Lou's life and it touched
[1:09:41] him faith is a lived
[1:09:45] life and it has an impact when we live
[1:09:49] this gospel when we live this word it
[1:09:53] has an impact amen just the other day we
[1:09:55] were when we were out helping these
[1:09:57] folks and we got across that
[1:09:59] bridge had a man tell me he said I'm

[1:15:52] blood splatter and everywhere and offer
[1:15:53] that sacrifice

[1:30:26] take a stand on his word if you want to
[1:30:28] get
[1:30:31] somewhere by faith the scripture says
[1:30:34] that Noah prepared an ark and for 120
[1:30:37] years he was willing to go through the
[1:30:39] ridicule and the mocking and the
[1:30:44] jokes why his faith told him his word is
[1:30:49] the truth so he went to work he went to
[1:30:51] work he didn't just preach the word he
[1:30:54] didn't just tell him it's going to rain
[1:30:56] but he built a
[1:30:59] boat and because that man had some
[1:31:02] action behind his faith it saved it
[1:31:05] saved Humanity from
[1:31:07] extinction because everything would have
[1:31:09] been wiped
[1:31:10] out by faith Abraham was willing to
[1:31:14] separate from his family in his Kindred
[1:31:17] and leave them all behind to go live in
[1:31:19] a place like Johnson
[1:31:22] City to to follow a gospel chasing this
[1:31:30] promise and after 25 years for 25 years
[1:31:34] that man confessed for 25 years he held
[1:31:38] on and when he finally got it and that
[1:31:40] young boy becomes a he's starting to
[1:31:42] become a young man the Lord says now I
[1:31:44] want you to take him and offer him to me
[1:31:47] Abraham as a
[1:31:52] sacrifice and abraam did
[1:31:54] it because he knew this one thing think
[1:31:58] about the horror that man felt what if
[1:31:59] he don't stop me what I'm what I'm about
[1:32:02] to do what if he don't stop me but he
[1:32:04] was willing to go through with it
[1:32:05] because he believed he knew my son is my
[1:32:09] he is my air that is my seed if I do
[1:32:12] have to take his life God will raise him
[1:32:15] back up again and because of that we C
[1:32:18] he's referred to as the friend of God
[1:32:20] because of that he is referred to as the
[1:32:23] father of the faithful because Abraham
[1:32:25] was willing to take a stand on the word
[1:32:27] of
[1:32:29] God
[1:32:31] Amen scripture says by faith so many
[1:32:34] others stop the mouths of lions quench
[1:32:37] the violence of fire escape the edge of
[1:32:39] the sword wax Valiant and fight and
[1:32:42] women receive their dead to life
[1:32:44] again but others it
[1:32:47] says were tortured not accepting
[1:32:52] Deliverance that they might obtain aain
[1:32:54] a better Resurrection others had cruel
[1:32:57] mockings and scourgings bonds
[1:32:59] imprisonment stoned sown aund slain with
[1:33:03] the sword went through terrible things
[1:33:06] but they refused they refused they
[1:33:09] didn't know if he was going to save them
[1:33:11] or not they knew that he could they knew
[1:33:13] that he could but whether he does or not
[1:33:16] I ain't backing up on this word of God I
[1:33:19] will not deny Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:33:22] The Living Word
[1:33:26] by
[1:33:29] faith says others wandered around
[1:33:32] destitute Afflicted and tormented of
[1:33:35] whom the world was not
[1:33:39] worthy bring it on down to Home by faith

[1:33:49] was no other alternative to her but I by
[1:33:51] his stops I'm Healed I am healed and she
[1:33:54] won she wouldn't she have refused to

[1:34:24] to probably from 200 lb to what 80 90 lb

[1:34:30] we'd have a prayer line we would see our
[1:34:32] brother could have him being carried in
[1:34:34] on a stretcher why why he knew his God
[1:34:37] was able he knew he was he refused to
[1:34:40] back up on that promise he refused to
[1:34:43] say the negative you can't tell me he
[1:34:45] didn't get down you don't get down when
[1:34:47] you can't walk you can't eat you got to

[1:55:35] and I said this to some brothers the
[1:55:36] other night I can't remember who it was
[1:55:38] if I were to audibly hear the voice of
[1:55:40] God tell me or what I want to believe to
[1:55:42] be the voice of God to tell me Pete I am
[1:55:44] not your healer healing is not for you I
[1:55:48] ain't going to believe it see because I
[1:55:51] can I I can be deceived as a man by
[1:55:54] Voices I can be deceived by revelations
[1:55:58] I can be deceived by how I feel about
[1:56:01] things
[1:56:04] right
[1:56:06] Revelations sometimes can
[1:56:09] fail voices can deceive your feelings
[1:56:13] are going to lie to you the word of God
[1:56:16] the word of God will never fail you you
[1:56:19] got to understand who you are is Sons
[1:56:22] and Daughters of God Leah you are a
[1:56:25] daughter of God you are a daughter of
[1:56:28] God is who you are you know sometimes
[1:56:31] DNA matters okay DNA matters on the
[1:56:34] natural side I out the first of my
[1:56:37] people and this explains a whole lot to
[1:56:38] me his name was William Lawson they call
[1:56:40] him William Lawson refer to him as
[1:56:42] William Lawson the Scottish Rebel this
[1:56:45] is a is a 15-year-old boy he fought in a
[1:56:47] revolution against against England at
[1:56:50] the Battle of cin was taking captive
[1:56:53] spent a year in prison came aboard my
[1:56:55] first my people were slaves that came to
[1:56:57] America he was a
[1:57:00] slave William didn't take that laying
[1:57:02] down you know when they went to get off
[1:57:04] the the boat they they were making them
[1:57:06] sign this contract if you work
[1:57:10] diligently and obey your master in all
[1:57:13] things in seven years you can go free
[1:57:16] like aund and some men was on that boat
[1:57:19] only one of them was a teenager he's 16
[1:57:21] years old his name was William Lawson to
[1:57:23] a man every one of them refused they
[1:57:25] said almighty God did not make us sign
[1:57:28] any such contract when we were born we
[1:57:30] will not sign it for you so they made
[1:57:32] them they they they forced them into
[1:57:34] slavery William was was taken to a home
[1:57:37] I can't remember where it was that I
[1:57:38] think in the Carolinas is that right
[1:57:40] Micah is it in Virginia he's taken to a
[1:57:43] place in
[1:57:44] Virginia his master they were real hard
[1:57:47] on him um
[1:57:49] William he was a rebel he uh his master
[1:57:54] had told him cuz William would he didn't
[1:57:56] take being a slave too well so he bucked
[1:57:58] his master all the time refused to eat
[1:58:00] his master wanted to keep him strong
[1:58:01] refus to eat so one day William was
[1:58:03] sitting in the floor he wasn't allowed
[1:58:04] to eat around everybody else he was
[1:58:05] sitting in the floor and he uh a dog the
[1:58:09] Master's dog a very loved dog of the
[1:58:10] master came walking by and his tail
[1:58:12] flopped on his table William took a
[1:58:13] knife and whacked his tail off his
[1:58:15] master came in him he was livid he was
[1:58:17] angry said why would you do something
[1:58:19] like why did you do that he said you
[1:58:21] told me to eat was whatever's on my
[1:58:23] plate your dog's tail was on my plate I
[1:58:26] thought I'm not reading this I'm
[1:58:27] thinking that explains a whole lot to me

[1:58:32] have a natural a a a natural DNA and
[1:58:37] he's messed up you may not be as messed
[1:58:39] up as us Lawson but you all are messed
[1:58:42] up y'all's flesh is messed up but we've
[1:58:45] got another another another Jean line as
[1:58:49] I said earlier we have a deposit that
[1:58:52] came literally came from almighty God a
[1:58:55] part of God it's in my loss and DNA to
[1:58:59] be stubborn and rebellious and to be
[1:59:02] bullheaded but it is in my other DNA to
[1:59:05] be an overcomer it is in your other DNA
