[8:24] weeks since we've been here, don't it?
[8:26] We only miss Wednesday night, but we're
[8:28] so glad to be here again this morning.
[8:30] Glad you're here. Look at your neighbor
[8:32] and tell them you're glad to see him in
[8:34] church today. Praise the Lord. What a
[8:37] privilege it is to be here. And some of
[8:39] you ain't glad to see him yet. You ain't
[8:41] said a word to nobody. If you're glad to
[8:44] see him, tell him you're glad to see him
[8:46] this morning, brothers. It's good to see
[8:47] all of you this morning. Amen. Praise
[8:51] the Lord. Do you love the Lord with all
[8:53] your heart?
[8:54] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Trust all of you had a wonderful
[8:58] Thanksgiving. So glad to be back in the
[9:00] house of the Lord looking to what God
[9:02] would have for us today. We're going to
[9:04] look at our prayer request. If you don't
[9:06] mind, you just stand with me for just a
[9:08] few minutes. Please continue to pray for
[9:10] Brother Curtis Hunnel as he recovers
[9:12] from a hip and leg injury due to a fall
[9:14] several days ago. The X-rays did not
[9:17] show any broken bones. He is now
[9:19] scheduled for an MRI on Friday, December
[9:22] the 5th. Please pray he will re receive
[9:24] a good report for a speedy recovery so
[9:27] that he can return to church and back to
[9:29] normal activities. So we just commit
[9:31] that unto the Lord. Brother Samuel
[9:34] Shuffler turns this in this morning that
[9:36] he's going to be looking for a new place
[9:38] to live due to some things that's
[9:40] happened there uh where he's at now. Uh
[9:43] he could stayed all the time that he was
[9:46] permitted to stay there. Uh he just
[9:49] trusted the Lord for a miracle. So,
[9:50] let's help brother Samuel pray that God
[9:53] will provide a place. How many of you
[9:55] know God's got a place? We just commit
[9:57] that unto the Lord. Love brother Samuel
[9:59] Schuffer this morning. Amen. Want to
[10:01] remember Brenda Kite in prayer. That's a
[10:03] friend of ours suffering from breast
[10:05] cancer. She asked us that we would
[10:07] remember her in prayer. So, let's
[10:09] remember her today. Also, Sister Shirley
[10:11] Lunford fell, broke her arm up into her
[10:14] shoulder. She's in quite a bit of pain.
[10:17] So, we want to remember her that the
[10:19] Lord would just uh just be with her and
[10:21] give her a a real speedy recovery. We
[10:24] know he's more than able to do that,
[10:26] don't we? Amen. Want to remember our
[10:28] grandson in prayer this morning, Tucker.
[10:30] He's uh got a virus of some sort.
[10:32] They're asking that we would pray that
[10:34] the Lord would touch him. Also want to
[10:36] remember the Hatton family in prayer.
[10:38] Brother Bobby, Sister Sherry, and all
[10:40] that family. as you know, their son
[10:42] passed away
[10:44] and they're just uh some of the best
[10:48] people that the Lord ever put on this
[10:49] earth.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; I mean that with all of my heart. Not
[10:52] just saying that today, but they they're
[10:55] just God's some of God's great great
[10:57] people. Now, the service will be here at
[10:59] the church tomorrow. Uh visiting hours
[11:03] from 12 until 1 and the service at 1,
[11:06] the committal uh after that. So, uh, if
[11:10] you could be here to just show your
[11:12] support, and we certainly want to pray
[11:14] that the Lord would just remember the
[11:17] Hayden family and and be with him and
[11:19] just love him real good and and hold him
[11:22] in his arms. We know he's more than able
[11:24] to be a friend that that's closer than a
[11:26] brother. Is that right? Brother Bean
[11:28] wants us to remember Sister Lou being in
[11:30] prayer fighting bronchitis, a kidney
[11:32] infection. Let's remember her, brother
[11:35] Bird and Sister Barbara uh asking for
[11:38] prayer this morning that the Lord would
[11:40] just be with them. We know that God
[11:42] cares about those folks. Sister Ruth
[11:44] Louise Jack's called to request a
[11:46] special unspoken prayer request for both
[11:48] of her daughters. God knows all about
[11:51] their situation. So, let's remember them
[11:52] in prayer today. Brother Jim Hughes
[11:55] offered this testimony and prayer
[11:56] request. He wants to thank uh uh all of
[12:00] you for for your praying. uh his wife
[12:02] Ladonna during her knee replacement
[12:04] surgery and recovery. Everything went
[12:06] well. She's doing much better. Also,
[12:08] Brother Jim is asking for prayer for two
[12:10] close friends. Their names are John
[12:12] Balden and Samuel Bricky. Both are
[12:14] fighting cancer and are asking God to
[12:16] move on their behalf. Please keep
[12:18] Brother Jim in continued prayer. He's
[12:20] still dealing with severe pain in his
[12:21] hands from arthritis. They love and
[12:23] appreciate everyone very much. Would
[12:25] like nothing better than to be in this
[12:27] service with us. So, we certainly want
[12:29] to pray for those folks. That's some
[12:30] good people right there. Also want to
[12:32] remember little Kanan Woods. Hello. I'm
[12:34] requesting prayer for my greatgrandson
[12:37] Kanan Woods that God would put angels
[12:39] around him. He's only three years old
[12:41] going through a lot of changes due to
[12:43] others decisions. Please keep him safe
[12:46] and that God would remove anything out
[12:49] of his life that would harm him in Jesus
[12:51] name. So we want to remember that prayer
[12:52] request this morning that the Lord would
[12:54] be mindful of that situation. all the
[12:56] unspoken prayer request. We know God's
[12:59] got it all in control, don't we? Do you
[13:00] believe that with all your heart?

[13:04] him one more good hand clap of praise.
[13:06] Amen. Let's sing that again if you
[13:08] would. Holy Spirit rain down. Sing it
[13:11] with all your heart. How many of you
[13:13] just like to have an outpouring of the
[13:14] Holy Ghost in this service today? He's
[13:18] more willing to give it to you than you
[13:20] are to receive it. How many of you
[13:22] believe we're going to have it this
[13:23] morning? God is so faithful. Do you love
[13:25] him with all your heart? Somebody say,

[14:39] &gt;&gt; You know, we're all going through
[14:42] tremendous things. And I was reading a
[14:45] book this morning called I Know. And

[15:23] God, [snorts] but we we rely on you. We
[15:26] like we said, we have to go through
[15:28] things to get ready to leave here. And
[15:30] we know it's closer closer and closer
[15:33] every day as we see the world events,
[15:35] see people going through these things.
[15:37] And but there's also faith being raised
[15:40] up in people, Lord. The God that we love
[15:43] won't forget us. He'll be with us, Lord
[15:45] Jesus. And God, be with these requests.
[15:47] Every everyone is very important to you.
[15:50] And Lord, help us to take him on our
[15:52] hearts when we leave here. Just help us
[15:54] to leave here and pray pray for him
[15:56] during the week and things. Be with our
[15:58] pastor this morning. If he's here, may
[16:01] may you anoint him in a mighty way.
[16:02] Knowing our ears that we might hear in
[16:04] Jesus name. Amen. [clears throat]
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Skip. God bless you.

[26:08] my Savior
[26:11] lives. [music]
[26:16] Because
[26:17] [music] he lives,
[26:23] I can [singing] face [music] tomorrow
[26:30] because [singing]
[26:32] he leaves. [music]
[26:37] All fear is [music] gone.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Because [singing] I know
[26:48] [music]
[26:50] I know he [singing] holds the future
[26:56] [music]
[26:58] and life is worth
[27:03] [music] the living [singing] just
[27:06] because
[27:07] you lose.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[27:26] &gt;&gt; How sweet
[27:28] the sound.

[27:52] [music]
[27:54] The greater
[27:56] still
[28:01] that calm [singing]
[28:03] assurance. [music]
[28:08] This child can [singing] face
[28:11] uncertain
[28:13] days [music and singing] because Jesus
[28:17] leaves.
[28:21] [music] And then one day
[28:28] I'll [music] cross [singing]
[28:30] that river.
[28:35] I'll fight the fine.
[28:42] [music]
[28:42] No war with pain.
[28:47] [music]
[28:49] And then as death [music]
[28:56] gives [music] way to victory.
[29:03] I'll see [music]
[29:04] [singing] the lights of gloryy
[29:08] and I know he reigns [music and singing]
[29:16] because [singing]
[29:18] he [music] lives.
[29:23] I can face [music] tomorrow
[29:30] because
[29:32] he is [music]
[29:37] all fear is gone [music]
[29:44] because [music]
[29:44] [singing]
[29:45] I know

[29:56] [music]
[29:57] and life is worth the [singing] living
[30:02] just because [music]
[30:05] he
[30:11] [music and singing] because I know
[30:16] [music]
[30:17] he holds the future.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:24] &gt;&gt; And life is [singing] worth the [music]
[30:28] living
[30:29] just because
[30:32] you
[30:37] [music]
[30:40] [applause]
[30:50] Amen. I love that song. That's one of my
[30:53] top five favorite songs.
[30:56] If you help me sing the chorus of this
[30:58] song, I think everybody might know it.
[31:02] How I [singing] long
[31:05] to breathe the air of heaven
[31:10] where pain is [singing and music] gone
[31:14] and mercy fills the streets. [music]
[31:19] To look upon [singing]
[31:21] the one [music] who bled to save me and
[31:26] walk with him
[31:29] for [music and singing] all eternity.
[31:31] eternity.
[31:37] For there will [singing and music] be a
[31:39] day when all will bow before him.
[31:45] There [singing] will [music] be a day
[31:48] when death will be no more.
[31:52] standing face [singing and music] to
[31:54] face
[31:56] with he who died and rose
[31:59] [music and singing] again.
[32:02] Holy,
[32:04] holy is the Lord.
[32:08] And every [music]
[32:09] prayer [singing]
[32:11] we prayed in desperation
[32:16] the songs of [music and singing] faith
[32:18] we sang through doubt and fear.
[32:23] In the [singing] end
[32:26] we'll see that [music] it was worth it
[32:31] when he [music] returns
[32:33] to wipe [singing]
[32:35] away our tears. years.
[32:41] Oh, and [singing] there will be [music]
[32:43] a day when all will [singing] bow before
[32:48] him. And there will [music] be a day
[32:52] [singing] when death will be no more
[32:56] standing [singing and music] face to
[32:58] face.
[33:00] But he who died and rose again.
[33:04] [singing and music]
[33:06] Holy,
[33:08] holy is [singing and music] the Lord.
[33:12] And on that day
[33:15] we join the resurrection
[33:19] and stand beside [singing]
[33:22] the heroes of the faith. [music]
[33:27] And with [singing] one voice
[33:30] a thousand generations
[33:33] [music]
[33:34] singing [singing]
[33:36] worthy is the lamb who was slain.
[33:42] And on [music and singing] that day we
[33:45] join the resurrection
[33:49] and stand [music] beside [singing]
[33:51] the great heroes of the faith. [music]
[33:56] And with one [singing] voice
[33:59] a thousand [music] generations
[34:04] singing [singing]
[34:05] worthy [music] is the lamb who was slain
[34:11] [music]
[34:12] forever.
[34:14] He shall [singing] reign.
[34:17] So let it be. [music] Today we shout the
[34:22] hymn [singing] of heaven
[34:24] with angels and [music] the saints. We
[34:28] raise [singing] a mighty roar
[34:32] and glory to [music] our God who gave
[34:36] [singing] us life beyond the [music]
[34:39] grave.
[34:41] Holy,
[34:43] holy is the Lord. Oh, let
[34:46] [music and singing] it be today.
[34:49] We shout the hymn of heaven
[34:53] with angels and the saints. We
[34:57] [music and singing] raise a mighty ro.
[35:00] Glory to our [music] God
[35:04] who gave us life beyond.
[35:09] Holy, [music]
[35:11] holy is the Lord.
[35:17] Holy,
[35:18] holy [music] is the Lord. [singing]
[35:24] Holy, [music]
[35:26] holy is the Lord.
[35:33] [music]
[35:36] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[35:48] &gt;&gt; one who's made it possible, isn't he?
[35:53] It makes me sad in my heart
[35:56] [clears throat]
[35:56] whenever we think about stand together
[36:00] the season that we're coming into and
[36:04] people celebrate supposedly him coming
[36:08] to the earth and what he did and
[36:12] most of it turns into commercialization
[36:16] turns into Santa Claus and lights and
[36:19] icicles and all that sort of
[36:23] It makes you wonder how many people who
[36:25] even [clears throat] claim to be
[36:26] Christians
[36:28] understand one tenth of 1%
[36:32] of what he gave up to come to this earth
[36:35] for us.
[36:37] I hope we never forget that as
[36:40] Christians. We're not here today to see
[36:43] each other. Though we are here to speak
[36:45] to one another and have fellowship with
[36:47] one another. We're not here to be
[36:49] catered to. We're not here to find
[36:53] fault. We're not here to be able to pick
[36:57] over one another's clothes and who dress
[37:00] the nicest. And we're actually here to
[37:02] hear our faults, our shortcomings.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; How that we can be made more like him.
[37:10] Is that your desire?
[37:13] &gt;&gt; I want to
[37:15] serve him better.
[37:17] how much ever life I have left.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; I don't know about how long that'll be.
[37:23] An hour, a day, a month, a year, 25
[37:26] years. Who knows exactly what it'll be,
[37:28] but I want to live every day of my life
[37:31] as if though my life would come to an
[37:34] end that day and I'll never have the
[37:38] opportunity to fix anything with
[37:40] anybody.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; I want to live fixed.
[37:46] Praise the Lord. How many wants to live
[37:49] fixed?
[37:50] &gt;&gt; That you don't have to call somebody.
[37:52] Hey, I talked about you. Hey, I run you
[37:54] down. Hey, I spread a lie on you. I'm so
[37:56] sorry. One of these days when life
[37:59] leaves this body, we'll have no
[38:02] opportunity to do that.
[38:05] There's nothing like living a clean
[38:08] life.
[38:10] Nothing.
[38:12] I'm just so grateful the Lord has made a
[38:14] way that we can be clean.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad we could come to church
[38:18] today?
[38:20] &gt;&gt; It seems like it's been two weeks since
[38:22] we've been to church.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Man, a lot of we just missed one
[38:25] Wednesday night, but I know I'm weird
[38:28] and I look at it strange, but to me,
[38:31] church has such value. Amen.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; I honor I honor and still consider it
[38:40] sacred.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Brother John was able to build this for
[38:44] me. I saw a picture online
[38:47] and uh
[38:49] through trying to design it and figure
[38:51] out how big to make it and all this that
[38:53] and the other. The walnut came from a
[38:56] place not too far away. had the columns
[39:00] made and brother Dao and brother Den
[39:03] painted it for us, finished it and all
[39:05] that.
[39:07] And it wasn't the walnut that was any
[39:09] more special than other walnut. As a
[39:10] matter of fact, I got a whole bunch of
[39:12] it right down there in storage and a
[39:14] brother brought me some just this week.
[39:18] So, it wasn't that walnut that was
[39:20] sacred. There was no sacred tree out in
[39:22] the forest that they went and got. But
[39:25] what's made this place sacred is his
[39:27] presence.
[39:29] This carpet could have wound up on a bar
[39:31] floor. The sheetrock could have wound up
[39:34] in a honky tonk. These lights could have
[39:37] wound up in all kinds of places.
[39:40] But what makes it sacred to us, his
[39:43] presence,
[39:46] and he loves together with his children.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; I hope you love that, too.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Let's turn if you would. Today, we greet
[39:55] [clears throat] you all in the name of
[39:56] the Lord Jesus. What a great honor and
[39:59] privilege it is.
[40:01] I've been standing behind sacred desk
[40:05] for
[40:08] a long, long time,
[40:10] 51 years, I guess.
[40:13] And I hope and pray to God that it never
[40:15] becomes
[40:18] just a place where I preach
[40:21] my job
[40:24] something I'm supposed to do. When that
[40:28] happens to a preacher, he's in a mess.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; You see, when many of you get in
[40:34] trouble, you can go to your pastor or
[40:35] you can go to evangelist or somebody and
[40:37] you can empty out and just I'm I'm
[40:40] dealing with this. I'm dealing with
[40:41] that. But a lot of times when preachers
[40:43] get in trouble, they got too much pride
[40:47] for a lot of them to admit they need
[40:50] help. They can get bitter. They can get
[40:53] such hate in their heart, such an
[40:56] unforgiving, uncristlike spirit
[41:01] and they won't turn to anybody. So they
[41:04] preach with bitterness, they preach with
[41:06] hatred, they preach with all this sort
[41:08] of thing. Can you imagine a sermon being
[41:11] filled with that?
[41:13] God help me.
[41:16] God help me.
[41:18] And it's the same with leoty. Leoty can
[41:20] come with in their hearts with
[41:22] bitterness and all kinds of things and
[41:25] they hear things through that filter.
[41:27] But let's open our hearts today and see
[41:30] what Jesus will speak to us. And if your
[41:33] filter is the Holy Ghost,
[41:36] no matter if a preacher's preaching is
[41:38] actually not your favorite preacher and
[41:40] you really don't get that much out of
[41:42] what he has to say, but if you'll let
[41:45] the Holy Ghost be your filter, it's
[41:47] amazing what he can pull through that
[41:50] &gt;&gt; that you yourself would have just
[41:51] totally missed. How many has had it
[41:53] happen to you before? Sure, I have too.
[41:56] God bless you. Let's let's read
[41:57] together. Second Peter chapter 1 verse
[42:00] two.
[42:02] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[42:05] through the knowledge of God and of
[42:06] Jesus our Lord, according as his divine
[42:10] power hath given unto us all things that
[42:13] pertain
[42:14] unto life
[42:16] and godliness. And what does godliness
[42:19] mean? To be like God
[42:22] through the knowledge of him that has
[42:24] called us to glory and virtue. We're not
[42:28] called to hate. No, we're not called to
[42:31] be troublemakers. I've never found one
[42:34] scripture where Jesus ever said,
[42:35] "Blessed are the troublemakers,
[42:38] &gt;&gt; but blessed are the
[42:40] &gt;&gt; peacemakers, whereby are given unto us
[42:43] exceeding great and precious promises,
[42:46] that by these you might be partakers of
[42:50] the divine nature, having escaped the
[42:53] corruption that is in the world through
[42:54] lust. And beside this, giving all
[42:57] diligence, add to your faith virtue, to
[43:00] virtue knowledge, to knowledge,
[43:03] temperance, to temperance patience, and
[43:06] to patience godliness, and to godliness,
[43:09] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[43:11] kindness, charity. I was studying last
[43:14] night and I ran across something where
[43:15] brother Ren was addressing
[43:18] the Pentecostal people, his age, and he
[43:22] was talking about the gifts of the
[43:24] spirit. He was talking about how the
[43:26] wonderful they were, marvelous they
[43:28] were. But he had he was preaching on
[43:31] this about the seven virtues. And he
[43:34] said many people want the gifts and seek
[43:37] the gifts without this.
[43:41] And he said without that the gifts can
[43:45] absolutely make a mess.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Turns into confusion, division, all
[43:51] kinds of different things. But he said,
[43:53] "Get this first
[43:55] &gt;&gt; and then it'll produce perfect gifts."
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; How many wants that in your life today?
[44:03] How many has a need, a desire, request?
[44:06] All right, let's pray together. I've got
[44:08] three prayer claws here today. And the
[44:10] Lord knows all these needs and the
[44:12] seriousness of them. You pray with me,
[44:14] would you? Heavenly Father, as we come
[44:17] before you today, we are so grateful. Oh
[44:21] Jesus, I'm just so happy to be able to
[44:25] be gathered with your saints in your
[44:29] courts.
[44:31] Carol and I was talking about before we
[44:32] come to church and she said, "I'm going
[44:34] to be so happy to come to church." And
[44:36] she said, "It ain't no wonder David
[44:39] said, I was glad when they said unto me,
[44:41] let us go into the house of the Lord."
[44:44] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yeah, and think about it.
[44:47] David didn't even have church as we know
[44:49] it. He never even got to go into the
[44:53] holiest of holies.
[44:55] He never got to sense that deep divine
[44:58] presence that the high priest felt.
[45:02] He never got to hear singing in church.
[45:05] He never got to hear testimonies, prayer
[45:08] requests.
[45:10] But they would go and read.
[45:12] But David knew there was something about
[45:15] the house of God, how hallowed, how
[45:18] sacred that it was. I imagine if David
[45:22] had been here in the service today, we'd
[45:24] had a time trying to keep him under
[45:26] control to hear people worshiping and
[45:29] praising, clapping their hands, singing.
[45:34] Oh Jesus, I pray it never becomes common
[45:36] to us. Lord, you see this prayer cause I
[45:40] have in my hand. Father, dear God, we're
[45:42] asking you for your mercy. Lord, all
[45:45] three of these need a divine touch in
[45:47] their lives. Father, Brother John text
[45:51] earlier and Lincoln was up, Lord. A big
[45:54] portion of the night, still vomiting
[45:56] again, and we're praying, Father, in the
[45:58] name of Jesus for our brother. Dear God,
[46:01] you see, he's had all kinds of tests and
[46:02] things, and so far this thing is evaded.
[46:05] And we know what it is. It's nothing but
[46:07] the devil.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He might hide from a scan. He
[46:11] might hide from a doctor's eye. But he
[46:14] can't hide from you.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; May the spirit of God go to him today,
[46:17] Father, and help him
[46:20] &gt;&gt; speak to us through your word, Father,
[46:21] in the name of Jesus, we ask. And the
[46:24] saints said,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[46:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[46:34] So when brother Brandon was preaching
[46:36] this and he was
[46:39] down at brother Jeffy's house, which was
[46:41] a brother that I was privileged to meet
[46:44] um many years ago down in Kentucky,
[46:47] and he was talking to the brothers there
[46:49] about these virtues. And he was trying
[46:52] to go in every source of course that he
[46:55] knew at the time to find the meanings of
[46:59] the words. And he said he looked through
[47:01] one dictionary and another and finally
[47:03] he said they found one at brother
[47:05] Jeffrey's house to look up godliness
[47:08] what godliness actually meant.
[47:11] And he said that it the meaning that he
[47:14] found was that simply it meant to be
[47:17] like God.
[47:19] So to be like God what an awesome thing.
[47:24] But you think, how in the world could
[47:27] mortals that are born in sin ever be
[47:31] like God? How could we ever even think
[47:34] it possible that something could happen
[47:38] to us and deal with us in such a way
[47:42] that would transform us, change us, and
[47:46] give us a desire to even be like God and
[47:49] then for things to continually unfold in
[47:52] our lives and would become more and more
[47:56] and more like him. And maybe we could
[48:00] see it a little bit clearer by looking
[48:03] at the contrast of darkness and it might
[48:06] help us to see the positivity of the
[48:09] side of light. Now we can see in our
[48:12] world around us every day that the
[48:15] people that are unconverted that are not
[48:17] serving the Lord, they are every day,
[48:21] every week, every month that goes by,
[48:23] this world is becoming more like Satan
[48:28] and his demons. You see it every day
[48:31] when you drive back and forth to work,
[48:33] to school. You see it when you drive to
[48:36] church. People are so self-centered.
[48:39] Where can you find people that drive
[48:41] anymore that even drive courteous? A lot
[48:44] of folks you meet, you know, especially
[48:46] on these Tennessee narrow highways,
[48:48] crooked as a dog's leg, they want their
[48:50] part of the road out of the middle.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I could understand that if you're
[48:55] in an eight lane highway, but some of
[48:57] these roads that we live and drive on,
[48:59] barely wide enough for two vehicles. And
[49:02] when you want your half out of the
[49:04] middle, well, you know what the rest of
[49:06] us same people do? We head for the
[49:08] ditch. But everywhere you see it,
[49:11] selfishness is so predominant. And I
[49:15] want this and I want that. And it's all
[49:18] about self. People go to church anointed
[49:21] with selfishness. Many preachers get in
[49:23] the pull pit, they preach anointed with
[49:25] selfishness because it's all about them.
[49:27] It's all about their world. It's about
[49:29] their pain. It's about their sorrow. I
[49:32] get sick and tired of hearing all that
[49:33] stuff myself. You know what? To testify,
[49:36] sure. Tell me what you're going through
[49:37] so I can pray for you, but give me
[49:39] something that'll help me to fight what
[49:41] I'm fighting. Okay? Don't just come to
[49:43] church and just tell me a bunch of
[49:44] nonsense. Give me something that's going
[49:46] to give me strength so when I walk out
[49:48] them doors, I can be a better person. I
[49:51] can have something to be able to combat
[49:53] the devil with. But we know that God
[49:56] knew that it was going to be impossible
[49:58] for man, women, boys and girls to ever
[50:01] to display the godliness of the New
[50:04] Testament in the manifestation of the
[50:07] Old Testament. Totally impossible. No
[50:09] way for him to ever do it. So God
[50:11] conserved this type of godliness for it
[50:14] to be made manifest in the New Testament
[50:17] because it was not attainable in the
[50:19] Old. And then even at that, it would
[50:22] seem so overwhelming to some that they
[50:24] would look at it and say, "Well, how is
[50:26] that even possible?" Well, first of all,
[50:28] there must be a new birth, a
[50:30] transformation by which our nature is
[50:32] totally changed. We're born again, and
[50:35] we're, as Paul says, a new creature in
[50:37] Christ Jesus. And as the prophet said,
[50:40] we're a new creation in the same old
[50:42] temple. So something great has happened
[50:45] on the inside of our soul, but that
[50:48] great thing did not actually come to the
[50:50] outside and the body be born again at
[50:53] the same time. Boy, wouldn't that been
[50:55] something wonderful. So we're living
[50:58] actually in this old pest house. And
[51:01] every day of our life, we recognize it
[51:03] more and more. So God knew that in order
[51:06] to release this great power, he himself
[51:10] must first partake of humanity in order
[51:14] for humans to partake of deity. There's
[51:18] only one way it can be done. He himself
[51:21] must condescend to a level that he would
[51:25] take on our humanity, talk our language,
[51:29] eat our food, dress and our clothes,
[51:32] live in our type of structure and and
[51:34] embody himself in a body that would have
[51:37] headaches, pain, anxiety, sorrow,
[51:41] sadness. You imagine Jesus dealt with so
[51:43] much sorrow that the the Bible tells us
[51:46] in the book of Isaiah that he was a man
[51:49] of sorrow and acquainted with grief. So
[51:53] his identification was not that he was a
[51:55] rich man. His identification was not
[51:57] that he was a wealthy man but he was a
[52:00] man of sorrow. He must have had
[52:03] continuous sorrows for this to be his
[52:07] identification.
[52:09] Why is he doing that? in order to
[52:11] display what God would do in a human
[52:15] form. Now remember, he didn't do this
[52:18] maintaining all of those divine
[52:20] attributes which he had in the realm of
[52:23] the eternal before he become a man. Now
[52:27] for us, this is all we've ever known all
[52:29] of our life is humanity, flesh,
[52:32] weakness, failures, and we can't even
[52:34] imagine it really. If you were God, the
[52:38] great eternal, the mighty Elohim, and
[52:41] out of you comes this attribute and you
[52:44] gave birth to a son, which was not
[52:46] another being that looked like you, but
[52:49] it was actually the word. Then that word
[52:52] would make different manifestations in
[52:55] the Old Testament in forms called
[52:57] theophony. He could appear as a light,
[52:59] pillar of fire, bush, all different
[53:01] types of things, clouds. And then he
[53:04] manifested himself in a human body. Then
[53:07] you step down from being the light, the
[53:11] fullness of the godhead bodily. You step
[53:13] down from being all of that to become a
[53:16] human being. And your first breath of
[53:19] human life, a woman gave birth to your
[53:23] body.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; You couldn't feed yourself. You couldn't
[53:27] clothe yourself. A woman had to change
[53:30] your diaper. A woman had to nurse you.
[53:33] For the first time, you were dependent
[53:36] on anyone or anything.
[53:39] And you are the creator of heavens and
[53:43] earth.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And yet here you were when you come to
[53:46] the earth and you so condescended that
[53:50] you separated yourself from the all-
[53:53] knowing. You separated yourself from all
[53:57] knowledge in so much that the scripture
[53:58] would say in Luke 2:52 that Jesus grew
[54:02] in wisdom and understanding before God
[54:05] and man. And yet he knew everything.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; But he stepped aside from that all
[54:12] knowing and he asked us to sacrifice a
[54:15] little of this and a little bit of that
[54:17] and we just complain and groan. Oh my.
[54:20] Help us Lord Jesus.
[54:23] Now, think that he was going to display
[54:26] godliness. So, how would God act? Look
[54:30] at Jesus and you'll get a good idea.
[54:33] Now, in order to be godly, as we've been
[54:35] looking at it, there's things that that
[54:37] God loves and there's things that God
[54:40] hates. Now, I know we don't hear much
[54:42] about that in the age of living because
[54:45] people want to talk so much about the
[54:46] love of God. And we know the Bible does
[54:49] not say that God is hate. But it does
[54:53] say that God is love. But we do know to
[54:56] be God that he must hate certain things.
[55:00] Notice I'm saying things, not people. So
[55:04] God must hate certain things because it
[55:07] is so against his nature and against who
[55:11] he is and what he is. So then if we are
[55:13] born of his nature, as Peter said,
[55:17] partakers of that divine nature, then we
[55:19] truly to be godly, we will love what he
[55:22] loves and we will hate what he hates. So
[55:26] there were things that will be that will
[55:28] be awful to us, reprehensible. It's
[55:31] things that we cannot even tolerate if
[55:34] we are godly. And the more we become
[55:36] like him, the more godly then we will
[55:39] be. So this is why it's totally
[55:41] impossible say if God loves this our
[55:44] brother here and this brother and this
[55:46] sister and that brother and that brother
[55:48] and that sister and that sister and God
[55:50] loves them and yet we as Christians look
[55:53] at them and we hate them. We're not
[55:55] godly yet. We're not godly the way we
[55:58] should be because we should be able to
[56:00] love those that God loves. Praise the
[56:03] Lord. Is that right? Now, God hates the
[56:06] sins of the sinner, but he loves the
[56:09] sinner itself. As I read to you last
[56:11] week where brother Brandham said that
[56:13] God loves America, but he hates
[56:16] America's sins. And he loves the church,
[56:18] but he hates the church's sin. We seem
[56:21] to have a hard time in separating that.
[56:24] So, here Jesus displayed godliness then,
[56:27] God in human flesh. Read with me if you
[56:30] would in 1 John 2:4. He that saith I
[56:33] know him and keepeth not his
[56:36] commandments is a liar and the truth is
[56:39] not in him. So we don't want truth just
[56:43] in her head but we want truth to be
[56:46] personified so the truth lives out of us
[56:49] out of a predominant nature. So we don't
[56:52] have to even make ourel do it. It's
[56:53] there by that nature of godliness in us.
[56:57] And verse 5, but who so keepeth his word
[57:00] in him verily is the love of God
[57:04] perfected. You mean a human being
[57:06] keeping the word of God and living the
[57:08] word of God. In that human being is the
[57:11] love of God perfected. How? Because God
[57:14] is living and loving and expressing
[57:18] himself out of that human being. I don't
[57:21] want to just quote John 3:16, but I want
[57:25] to quote First John 3:16.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; How many knows what that even says?
[57:34] A lot of Christians wouldn't.
[57:36] Why? They've never moved into that
[57:39] sphere of godliness yet. They've met him
[57:41] at the altar in sanctification, maybe
[57:45] got blessed, but as far as moving to
[57:47] First John 3:16. Now, we're talking
[57:51] about bride material. Watch in verse
[57:54] six. He that saith, he abideth in him
[57:58] ought himself also to walk even as he
[58:04] walks. You mean God is wanting you and I
[58:08] to walk as he did in heaven? No. On the
[58:12] earth. So on the earth he walked godly
[58:16] yet had sorrow, anxiety, trouble,
[58:20] sickness, got discouraged with people.
[58:23] No doubt felt despondent at times. Is
[58:26] that right? The garden of Gethsemane
[58:28] prayed that the will of God would be
[58:30] somehow possible. Let this cut pass from
[58:33] me. So there's things Jesus knew he was
[58:36] the only one that could fulfill, but he
[58:38] didn't want to do it.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; I said he didn't want to do it.
[58:43] There's things in our life that we feel
[58:45] like God has allocated to us, but
[58:47] there's things in my life I wish it
[58:49] wasn't my lot to fulfill.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; I have to be honest.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said he wish this message
[58:55] was not his to bring.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; So you see people that are chomping at
[59:00] the bits to do something for God, nine
[59:02] times out of 10 they're not even called
[59:04] to do it in the first place.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Now watch what he done. How he walked in
[59:09] humility. Matthew chap 23:12,
[59:12] "And whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[59:16] be abased, and he that shall humble
[59:19] himself shall be exalted." You see this
[59:23] is where we come to momentarily here
[59:25] that God said let this same mind you as
[59:28] he anointed Paul to write this. Let this
[59:31] same mind which was also in Christ Jesus
[59:34] who being in the form of God thought it
[59:36] not robbery to be equal with God but he
[59:39] made himself of no reputation and took
[59:42] upon him the form of a servant. Notice
[59:46] again James 4:6 he says but he giveth
[59:50] more grace. Wherefore he saith, God
[59:53] resisteth the proud, but he giveth grace
[59:58] unto the humble.
[1:00:01] Now God himself by the nature of the
[1:00:03] Holy Ghost living in our regenerated
[1:00:06] life gives us a degree of humility by
[1:00:10] birth. But much of the economy of God
[1:00:14] and our life of service is not going to
[1:00:17] be on that humility through the Holy
[1:00:20] Ghost. It will be on our own personal
[1:00:24] humility that we humble ourselves.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. And God will never do that.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Only we can.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; So, we humble ourselves or we exalt
[1:00:40] ourselves.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice James 4:10. Humble
[1:00:45] yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and
[1:00:49] he shall lift you up. So truly
[1:00:54] the way up is down.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Now, it depends on the order you have
[1:00:59] it. If you've got it down, then you'll
[1:01:03] be up. If you've got it up, you'll be
[1:01:06] down.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; If we humble ourselves, he will lift us.
[1:01:13] If we exalt ourselves, he will humble
[1:01:16] us.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; So you and I have the choice today, even
[1:01:20] as the people of God, that we can choose
[1:01:23] humility
[1:01:25] or we can be humbled,
[1:01:28] which is not the same thing. You see, if
[1:01:31] we by choice choose humility, it
[1:01:35] automatically renders to us divine
[1:01:38] exaltation.
[1:01:40] If we choose human exaltation, it
[1:01:44] automatically renders to us God is going
[1:01:47] to humble us.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Woo! I hate that kind of humbling, don't
[1:01:52] you? Wow. BUT IF WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD,
[1:01:55] he's going to do us because he loves us.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Now, notice how Peter says in 1 Peter
[1:02:01] 5:5, "Likewise, you younger, submit
[1:02:03] yourselves unto the elder." Now remember
[1:02:07] this is totally contrary than it would
[1:02:09] be to Hebrews the way that they would
[1:02:12] have thought cuz the younger people
[1:02:14] coming up to elders I mean they didn't
[1:02:16] have nothing. They didn't have nothing
[1:02:17] to say. You couldn't hardly say anything
[1:02:19] in front of an older person. You just
[1:02:21] was dumb and that's just the way it was.
[1:02:23] But notice what Christianity did. It's
[1:02:26] reversing the roles to where it's taking
[1:02:29] away a hierarchy that was so in the
[1:02:33] Hebrew ranks. Likewise, ye younger,
[1:02:36] submit yourselves unto the elder, and
[1:02:39] yay, all of you be subject one to
[1:02:41] another. So here and now he turns it
[1:02:43] right back around and saying now look
[1:02:45] it's not going to be a carryover of
[1:02:47] Hebrewism but it's going to be a divine
[1:02:50] interruption of the spirit of God that
[1:02:53] each of you no matter what your position
[1:02:55] is you'll be able to humble yourself and
[1:02:58] realize you're servants to one another
[1:03:01] be subject one to another and be clothed
[1:03:05] with humility
[1:03:08] humility.
[1:03:09] The having a humble opinion
[1:03:13] of oneself,
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; a deep sense of one's moral littleness.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:03:25] This is good stuff.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Modesty,
[1:03:30] loneliness
[1:03:33] of mind.
[1:03:36] Now, if you want to know if some people
[1:03:38] think they are great or not, ask them.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; They will definitely tell you.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; It ain't no wonder we don't go on with
[1:03:48] God
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; and get more godly.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; But you see, we think as long as our
[1:03:56] dress is the right length.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; And thankfully this morning, none of our
[1:04:01] brothers wore skirts to church.
[1:04:04] Hopefully they don't do it at home
[1:04:05] either. They wear no dresses, earrings,
[1:04:09] and so on and so on. And we look at this
[1:04:12] and that and WE DETERMINE THAT'S GODLY.
[1:04:14] WHAT A GODLY person
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; really.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; How many do you know in dresses and how
[1:04:21] many men do you know that would never
[1:04:22] put on lipstick?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Although manicures and all that sort of
[1:04:28] thing is becoming very popular for men.
[1:04:30] Yeah.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Used to be just
[1:04:34] Maybelline was for women. Not anymore.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; The men of the age, bunch of sissified
[1:04:39] perverts. They have their own line
[1:04:42] makeup and their own line of lipstick
[1:04:45] and all that sort of thing. Bunch of
[1:04:47] sissies.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Preach. Brother Donnie.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; But yet, HOW MANY OF US WOULD SAY, "OH,
[1:04:54] WHAT A GODLY PERSON. WHAT A GODLY
[1:04:56] PERSON." AND YET YOU talk to them a
[1:04:58] little bit and a half of their
[1:05:00] conversation is about themsel
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; testing one two. Is my mic working okay
[1:05:09] to tell you? All right. All right.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Notice be clothed with humility for God
[1:05:16] resistance.
[1:05:20] So can you imagine God actually resists
[1:05:25] the proud?
[1:05:27] Look at the word proud.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Showing oneself
[1:05:33] above others.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Over topping.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Over topping.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Conspicuous above others. Preeminent
[1:05:45] with an overwhelming estimate
[1:05:49] of one's means or merits.
[1:05:54] I've preached for so many years. I've
[1:05:55] done this. I pray for this person. God
[1:05:57] showed me that. I've done this. I've
[1:05:59] done that and the other.
[1:06:03] So what if our nation
[1:06:06] passed a law?
[1:06:08] Everybody who makes under 250k a year
[1:06:13] loses citizenship.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Most of us would be in Somalia, wouldn't
[1:06:20] we?
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Ethiopia, Nigeria.
[1:06:28] And yet the Lord Jesus
[1:06:32] looks at his people and his economy
[1:06:36] and some of the poorest on the earth
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; are his.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the Lord Jesus
[1:06:44] never even owned a house.
[1:06:48] The foxes have holes and the birds of
[1:06:50] the air have nest, but the son of man
[1:06:53] hath now where to lay his head.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; I realize a lot of the folks at
[1:06:58] panhandle on the days that we live and
[1:07:00] stand and I will work by food. Have you
[1:07:02] noticed how many of them signs have
[1:07:04] changed? You don't find many of them
[1:07:05] signs anymore. I'll work for food.
[1:07:07] They're just going and asking for your
[1:07:08] money and they ain't going to work for
[1:07:10] it.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; But I never pass by those signs whether
[1:07:14] on university or wherever they are. you
[1:07:16] and I got their favorite spots never
[1:07:22] and think if I would have looked at the
[1:07:23] Lord Jesus in his day.
[1:07:27] He'd have probably dressed like some of
[1:07:28] them people
[1:07:30] saw one yesterday I'm hungry and I'm
[1:07:33] homeless.
[1:07:36] Then Carol was talking about I told her
[1:07:38] I said you realize in reality
[1:07:40] some of them may be actors and lying but
[1:07:43] if the Lord Jesus would have stood up
[1:07:45] with a sign
[1:07:47] his son would have said that
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; I'm homeless I'm rejected
[1:07:54] I'm hated I'm despised of men
[1:07:59] a man of sorrows
[1:08:01] and acquainted with grief
[1:08:06] and We stick up our nose in the air and
[1:08:07] look down upon people that we go to
[1:08:09] church with
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; cuz they don't dress as nice as we do.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Who are we?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Godliness.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:6. Humble yourselves therefore
[1:08:31] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[1:08:35] exalt you in due time. I love these
[1:08:38] words that Paul uses in Philippians 2:6.
[1:08:41] Who being in the form of God thought it
[1:08:44] not robbery to be equal with God. Now he
[1:08:47] tells us to let this mind be in you
[1:08:50] which was also in Christ Jesus. And this
[1:08:52] mind is a mind of self emptying.
[1:08:59] the mind of self
[1:09:02] emptying
[1:09:05] to where no matter how much God blesses
[1:09:07] you, whether it's financially or in the
[1:09:10] spiritual realm, that you're constantly
[1:09:14] selfmping.
[1:09:16] So you never allow yourself to be
[1:09:19] exalted above measure. I'm this, I'm
[1:09:22] that, I'm the other.
[1:09:24] He said, "Who being in the form of God,
[1:09:27] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:09:28] God, but made himself of no reputation."
[1:09:33] Look at the words that Paul chooses to
[1:09:36] use to describe our Lord Jesus. Look at
[1:09:38] what this word here, reputation means.
[1:09:41] Kenu, which is the word where brother
[1:09:43] Brandham got the word kenosis.
[1:09:46] Look at what it means to empty.
[1:09:51] Make empty. Deprive
[1:09:56] of force.
[1:09:58] Cause a thing to be seen.
[1:10:03] To be seen
[1:10:05] to be empty,
[1:10:08] hollow.
[1:10:10] So the Lord Jesus self emptied
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; to give the appearance
[1:10:18] that he was hollow.
[1:10:23] You imagine Peter could have woke up
[1:10:25] every morning and traveling around with
[1:10:27] him
[1:10:29] and let's say this morning when he woke
[1:10:31] up and he got up out of their cot maybe
[1:10:34] rolled out
[1:10:36] and he looked and he said, "Lord Jesus,
[1:10:40] look at that sunrise.
[1:10:43] That sun breaking across the east
[1:10:45] there."
[1:10:47] Jesus could have said, "I made that."
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And he could have said, "Listen to
[1:10:54] whipperwill. Listen at the birds. Listen
[1:10:56] at this." Jesus could have said, "I
[1:10:59] actually gave him
[1:11:02] that song.
[1:11:06] I composed it." And I made his his
[1:11:09] little beak and his little throat where
[1:11:12] it could quiver to produce the vibr
[1:11:17] as it would come out of his little beak.
[1:11:21] Oh, you gave him that song. Yeah, it's
[1:11:23] been a long time ago, but I still
[1:11:25] remember the chords.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; We said, "Lord, listen at that one."
[1:11:30] There it is. I wrote that song, too.
[1:11:35] that in the evening the moon could have
[1:11:37] come out the stars and he could have
[1:11:39] said WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WHAT a beautiful
[1:11:42] moon is. He could have said I made that.
[1:11:46] They could said look at those stars and
[1:11:47] said I made all them
[1:11:51] but we have not one place recorded.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Whoever told us any great thing that he
[1:11:59] himself did.
[1:12:01] As a matter of fact, if other people had
[1:12:03] not wrote about him,
[1:12:06] we would have never had one line that he
[1:12:09] ever wrote
[1:12:11] talking about what he ever did.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Godliness.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:12:28] Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; He made all the cattle on the hills,
[1:12:40] all the fish in the sea,
[1:12:43] and yet he humbled himself
[1:12:46] to catch them.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; So he could have said, "I'd like fish
[1:12:51] for dinner."
[1:12:53] And just spoke. it have jumped out,
[1:12:56] fried itself, salt and peppered itself,
[1:13:01] but instead he humbled himself
[1:13:04] to use in a net.
[1:13:07] Don't you see every aspect of his life
[1:13:11] and he made everything
[1:13:15] everything?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; So, did the world need another
[1:13:20] carpenter?
[1:13:22] Did the world need another fisherman?
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Did the world need another great king
[1:13:28] that would come and be like all the rest
[1:13:30] of them and would be a despot that would
[1:13:33] punish the poor and exalt the rich? And
[1:13:36] did the world need that?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, the world needed
[1:13:42] God.
[1:13:45] BUT NOT GOD IN ME LIKE THE OLD
[1:13:47] TESTAMENT,
[1:13:49] but God in the form of a man.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Notice Paul says, "But he made himself
[1:13:58] of no reputation
[1:14:00] and took upon him the form
[1:14:04] of a servant."
[1:14:08] So the word servant is dulos,
[1:14:11] a bondman,
[1:14:13] a slave,
[1:14:16] a man of survile condition.
[1:14:19] Metaphorically one who gives
[1:14:23] himself up
[1:14:26] to another's will.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:14:33] and was made in the likeness of men.
[1:14:37] Verse eight, and being found in fashion.
[1:14:41] [crying]
[1:14:42] Now, I want you to notice how that Paul
[1:14:45] when he writes this in verse six, who
[1:14:47] being in the form of God, thought it not
[1:14:49] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[1:14:52] himself of no reputation.
[1:14:56] So one emptying
[1:14:59] leaving the pre-incarnate state of what
[1:15:02] he was the great eternal he emptied
[1:15:06] himself and then after he comes to the
[1:15:08] earth he still carries out the same act
[1:15:13] of condensation that when he once he
[1:15:15] gets here he's still emptying
[1:15:19] or brother Johnny when will I attain to
[1:15:21] this will it be a one-time thing
[1:15:24] No,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; It'll actually be ongoing as long as
[1:15:29] you're here.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; You see, this is a divine process that
[1:15:33] goes on in regenerated human beings.
[1:15:36] That's where people backslide.
[1:15:39] Whenever they come to a certain spot and
[1:15:41] they think, "Oh, well, I've got saved. I
[1:15:43] got saved. I've got the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:15:44] doing really good." And then maybe they
[1:15:46] start, you know, maybe they're a singer
[1:15:48] and their singing is really blessed by
[1:15:50] God. And if they're not careful, they'll
[1:15:51] become bigger and bigger and bigger in
[1:15:54] their own eyes. Bigger and bigger and
[1:15:55] bigger. And then they'll start relying
[1:15:57] more upon their own ability. And they
[1:16:00] think, "Well, I don't need the anointing
[1:16:01] anymore." You'd be surprised the message
[1:16:03] preachers that I've heard about that say
[1:16:05] they don't need the anointing no more to
[1:16:06] preach. I hope I never get to that spot.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't feel that way about
[1:16:12] your own walk with God. Oh, I don't need
[1:16:14] the anointing. Yes, you do. Every day of
[1:16:17] your life,
[1:16:20] SO IT WASN'T THAT HE DID IT ONE TIME,
[1:16:23] but it was constantly ongoing. And this
[1:16:26] is where he wants us TO STAY. SAME WITH
[1:16:28] PREACHERS. Can't you understand why
[1:16:29] preachers we've seen them rise and fall
[1:16:32] and they topple like dominoes. CAN'T YOU
[1:16:34] SEE WHY GOD WILL GO TO USING A man and
[1:16:37] maybe it's in a gifted to preach and and
[1:16:40] maybe others it' be gifted to pray for
[1:16:42] people and gifted in this way and that
[1:16:44] way and that way. And if God blesses
[1:16:46] them and they get greater and greater,
[1:16:48] more signs, more wonders, more
[1:16:50] conventions or whatever it is, however
[1:16:52] God's gifted them, and if they don't
[1:16:54] keep this idea right here before them,
[1:16:57] CONSTANTLY SELFMPING AND GOD'S giving
[1:17:01] them more and THEY'RE SELF-MPING AND
[1:17:04] GOD'S MAKING THEM GREATER and their
[1:17:06] ministry, their understanding, and so on
[1:17:08] and SO ON. BUT HOW MANY HAVE WE seen in
[1:17:10] our own ranks, the bigger they get, the
[1:17:12] more they know it? The bigger they get,
[1:17:15] the more they think they know, till they
[1:17:17] get to a place they're not even subject
[1:17:19] to the word no more and cannot receive
[1:17:21] correction from anybody,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; including God.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Now, when we get so big we can't take
[1:17:29] correction from God, we're in a world of
[1:17:32] hurt. Friends,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; I hope none of us, including the man
[1:17:36] talking to you today, EVER GETS TO A
[1:17:38] SPOT THAT WE CANNOT be corrected by the
[1:17:41] Holy Ghost.
[1:17:43] You agree with this?
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:17:50] So already by his emptying the canosis
[1:17:54] now he humbles himself. not only took on
[1:17:57] the form of man but now it goes into the
[1:18:01] lowest stage of man to take on the form
[1:18:04] of a servant. To become king God to King
[1:18:08] Jesus to go straight TO A THRONE UPON
[1:18:11] THE EARTH WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AN ACT
[1:18:13] OF CONDENSATION. But to come from that
[1:18:16] great eternal to become a man and having
[1:18:20] no place to lay your head AS WE SAID AND
[1:18:22] to be ridiculed and misunderstood AND
[1:18:24] CRITICIZED AND TALKED ABOUT AND AND WENT
[1:18:27] STRAIGHT TO A THRONE. THAT'S STILL BEEN
[1:18:29] AN ACT OF CONDENSATION,
[1:18:31] but rather to go to a not a throne
[1:18:35] but a cross
[1:18:39] and become a serpent
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; on the pole.
[1:18:44] Demonology
[1:18:46] part two paragraph 199.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And I think
[1:18:53] when how God sent Jesus to hell
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; because of his sins.
[1:19:02] Not sins that he had done, but because
[1:19:05] of our sins.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; And who were we? A sixft pile of dirt,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; 4 and 1/2t pile of dirt.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And being found, notice, being found
[1:19:25] in fashion as a man,
[1:19:28] he humbled himself. So coming in the
[1:19:31] form of man was a great act of humility.
[1:19:35] But then after he was found
[1:19:38] in the fashion of man, he humbled
[1:19:41] himself again.
[1:19:45] When did it stop?
[1:19:51] When he went down to hell.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; What did God do? He raised him so high
[1:20:04] the angels have to oh glory to God bow
[1:20:08] down to his name. [clears throat]
[1:20:09] Everything in heaven and earth is called
[1:20:12] after his name. Reward for humility.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; He showed us how to live like God.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:23] I'm sure some of you have probably heard
[1:20:25] it, maybe some not, but TL Osborne makes
[1:20:30] some of the most astounding statements
[1:20:34] at Brother Brandham's memorial service
[1:20:38] about the way that brother Brandham
[1:20:40] lived. And he talked about how the
[1:20:42] preachers come and preach and so on. But
[1:20:44] he said William Brandham did not just do
[1:20:48] miracles and signs and but he showed us
[1:20:52] God
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; in flesh.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; A man who could have been a millionaire.
[1:20:57] A man WHO COULD HAVE BEEN WHATEVER HE
[1:21:00] WOULD HAVE WANTED.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; But what did he find the key to?
[1:21:06] Humbling himself. Imagine they bring a
[1:21:09] million and a half dollars to him and he
[1:21:11] tells them to take it back. HE WAS
[1:21:12] OFFERED THIS THAT THE OTHER. WHAT DO HE
[1:21:14] DO? TURN IT ALL DOWN. WHY? In order to
[1:21:18] stay small and humble
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; where God could use him. How many of us
[1:21:22] want that kind of spirit?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Notice the word humble.
[1:21:29] Tapping me. A base. Bring low. To make
[1:21:32] low. Metaphorically to bring into A
[1:21:34] HUMBLE CONDITION. REDUCED TO meaner
[1:21:37] circumstances.
[1:21:38] To assign a lower rank
[1:21:43] or place to to be ranked below others
[1:21:48] who are honored or rewarded.
[1:21:52] To have a modest opinion of oneself. to
[1:21:57] behave in an unassuming
[1:22:01] manner devoid
[1:22:04] of all hauliness.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; The more we go on, I wonder more I
[1:22:14] wonder
[1:22:16] how many be there'll ever be
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; that'll ever to attain to such a stuff.
[1:22:25] But there will be some.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, there'll be some.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Notice in Luke 22:27,
[1:22:35] for whether is greater
[1:22:38] he that siteth at meat or he that
[1:22:40] serveth? The Lord Jesus talking to the
[1:22:42] disciples now. Is not he that siteth at
[1:22:46] meat,
[1:22:48] but I am among you
[1:22:51] is the one that serveth.
[1:22:56] May God help every God call man around
[1:22:58] this message
[1:23:00] to always maintain
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; this view right here of our Lord Jesus.
[1:23:08] It's no wonder to me, brother Dave, that
[1:23:09] whenever the Lord Jesus
[1:23:13] had the last supper,
[1:23:16] and the Bible says he gets a towel
[1:23:20] and he girds himself
[1:23:24] and he bows down on his knees, something
[1:23:26] maybe like this.
[1:23:28] And he gets a pan of water and he comes
[1:23:31] to Peter and looks him up in the face.
[1:23:34] And Peter said, "You will never wash my
[1:23:37] feet."
[1:23:39] Are you being a footwash funky Jesus?
[1:23:42] This is beneath you. You're the GREAT
[1:23:46] KING. YOU'RE THE GREAT ALL THESE GREAT
[1:23:48] THINGS, PETER. If I don't wash you, you
[1:23:52] have no part with me.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; What was he showing them? Brother Rob,
[1:24:01] those that you may seem to
[1:24:04] [clears throat] look upon and THINK
[1:24:05] THEY'RE SUCH GREAT MIGHTY men
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; when they get to where they cannot wash
[1:24:12] the feets
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; of God's children. I ain't talking about
[1:24:14] just naturally. I'm talking about you
[1:24:18] all are not called
[1:24:21] to be my servants.
[1:24:23] Come on. I am called
[1:24:27] to be yours.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Every preacher, not just pastors, is
[1:24:34] called to be the servants
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; to God's people.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; But some preachers want to be
[1:24:41] potentates, kings, kingdoms. There's
[1:24:45] only one kingdom I'm interested in
[1:24:47] today.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And it ain't the kingdom of Donnie
[1:24:49] Reagan. It ain't the kingdom of no other
[1:24:51] preacher.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; It's the kingdom of the Lord Jesus.
[1:24:55] And the church said,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. You see, when he did this, he
[1:25:05] emptied himself of all symbols
[1:25:09] of divinity.
[1:25:12] So if you'd have been around the Lord
[1:25:14] Jesus and saw him working as a man,
[1:25:16] you'd have saw sweat roll down his face.
[1:25:22] hot days, drier Mediterranean climate.
[1:25:26] You'd have been around him and been out
[1:25:27] in the heat of the day and his human
[1:25:30] body, you would have probably smelt a
[1:25:32] body odor.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus would have needed to take a bath.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; HIS STOMACH WAS LIKE YOURS AND MINE. He
[1:25:42] would have got hungry.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; He would have got thirsty, weary.
[1:25:49] Oh, God.
[1:25:52] So he could not just I done this and I'd
[1:25:56] done that and I'd done what did he say?
[1:25:58] I do nothing until my father shows me.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I can't do this on my own.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Not saying he couldn't
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; in the preexisting form before the work
[1:26:11] of incarnation. But he laid that aside.
[1:26:16] HE LIVED ON THE EARTH AS A MAN FOR 30
[1:26:19] years without the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Godliness.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; How many wants it?
[1:26:37] Though he was God appearing in the form
[1:26:40] of a man, a divine person on earth,
[1:26:45] he did nothing to assume the
[1:26:47] representation of divinity
[1:26:50] or even his rights that preexisted
[1:26:54] before he come here like that.
[1:26:57] Notice in Romans 5:19, "For as by one
[1:27:00] man's disobedience, many were made
[1:27:02] sinners, so by the obedience,
[1:27:06] Uh-oh."
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Here's another act of condensation.
[1:27:12] God [screaming]
[1:27:14] obeying.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; God
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; obeying
[1:27:28] By the obedience of one
[1:27:31] shall many be made righteous.
[1:27:34] HEBREWS 5:8. THOUGH HE WERE A SON, yet
[1:27:37] learned he
[1:27:40] obedience by what? By the things
[1:27:45] which he suffered.
[1:27:48] Almighty God condescended in such a
[1:27:51] state of humanity that he had to learn
[1:27:55] things.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; The true and original knowit all.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; The only one there ever was or ever will
[1:28:04] be.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; But the know-it-all come down and had to
[1:28:07] come to a spot, brother Da. Brother Dao,
[1:28:10] that his mama had to teach him letters.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; You imagine as a little boy, his mother
[1:28:15] was teaching him Aramaic. He's the one
[1:28:18] who gave the original languages. He's
[1:28:21] the one who put all this together. You
[1:28:23] imagine Jesus as a little boy. Uh Colin
[1:28:26] learned it. Of course, what they would
[1:28:27] say was, "Ema, Emma." Jesus stuttering
[1:28:30] as a little boy. Jesus learning the
[1:28:33] phrases. Jesus, you know, his mama
[1:28:35] homeschooling him probably the way he
[1:28:37] was taught. His mama teaching him one
[1:28:39] plus one. Jesus, how much? I don't know,
[1:28:42] mama. I don't know. One plus one. Jesus,
[1:28:44] you've got to learn this. 1 plus one.
[1:28:47] But after he learned it, he could take a
[1:28:49] few loaves and a few fishes. Boy, did he
[1:28:51] learn how to multiply.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. BUT HE ALSO KNEW
[1:28:57] addition and subtraction. And he knew
[1:29:00] that if you COME TO THIS LIFE TO BE A
[1:29:03] SERVANT TO GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO SUBTRACT.
[1:29:05] YOU'VE GOT TO DIVIDE YOURSELF FROM WHAT
[1:29:08] YOU WERE AND SUBTRACT AND HUMBLE
[1:29:11] YOURSELF. AND BY DOING SO, IT WILL
[1:29:14] PRODUCE DIVINE MULTIP MULTIPLICATION AND
[1:29:17] DIVINE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN. MAY GOD HELP
[1:29:20] US AS THE PEOPLE OF GOD THAT WE CAN
[1:29:23] UNDERSTAND DIVINE MATHEMATICS. WELL, I
[1:29:25] HATE TO GIVE UP THIS AND I HATE TO GIVE
[1:29:27] UP THAT. YOU KNOW, to need to go to math
[1:29:30] school and that THE LORD JESUS TEACH
[1:29:32] YOU, IF YOU FORSAKE ALL MEN FOR ME, I
[1:29:35] WILL CONFESS YOUR NAME BEFORE THE
[1:29:37] FATHER. I WILL STAND THERE AND BE A
[1:29:40] WITNESS FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. BUT PEOPLE
[1:29:42] SAY, "WELL, I GOT TO GIVE UP THIS. I GOT
[1:29:44] TO GIVE UP THAT." THEY AIN'T LEARNED
[1:29:45] math yet. But if you understand it the
[1:29:48] RIGHT WAY, YOU GIVE UP THIS LITTLE
[1:29:50] SOMETHING, HE'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING SO
[1:29:52] MUCH GREATER. YOU FOREGO THIS AND HE
[1:29:54] WILL MULTIPLY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
[1:29:59] [applause]
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? In his incarnate state,
[1:30:09] he surrendered his right to manifest
[1:30:13] himself visibly
[1:30:16] in divine glory
[1:30:19] and splendor.
[1:30:23] Oh, I know how I feel when I get to get
[1:30:26] into his presence.
[1:30:31] You know the same because you've been
[1:30:33] there.
[1:30:35] Can you imagine on Mount
[1:30:36] Transfiguration, Brother Larry, as he
[1:30:39] was able at the father's choice
[1:30:43] at the right moment to enter into that
[1:30:47] glory which he had laid aside
[1:30:50] and been out of for so long.
[1:30:54] And all of the sudden, the father sends
[1:30:57] down a little future taste of what his
[1:31:01] coming kingdom.
[1:31:03] Isn't it amazing? He could have CHOSE
[1:31:05] ALL TYPES OF SCENARIOS to send down a
[1:31:08] little foretaste of divinity, but he
[1:31:11] knew what would mean the most to the
[1:31:13] Lord Jesus.
[1:31:16] Heavenly divine glory foreshadowed in
[1:31:20] his future kingdom in type. Peter,
[1:31:24] James, John, Elijah, Moses, resurrected
[1:31:28] saints, dead saints. And what did Jesus
[1:31:31] GET A FORETASTE OF? HIS KINGDOM with his
[1:31:34] bride. AMEN. THAT WAS THE APOSTLES UP
[1:31:38] THERE, THE NATURAL ONES AND AND
[1:31:40] UNCONVERTED BODIES. And there lays the
[1:31:42] others down there a perfect despion of
[1:31:44] the kingdom that WAS TO COME. AND FOR A
[1:31:47] FEW MOMENTS, JESUS WAS ABLE to enter in
[1:31:50] to that divine glory which he had
[1:31:52] separated himself from by choice. Don't
[1:31:55] ever forget this. JESUS WAS NOT A
[1:31:59] MARTYR.
[1:32:01] JESUS WAS NOT A MARTYR. HIS LIFE WAS NOT
[1:32:05] TAKEN from him.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; He gave it.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?
[1:32:14] WHAT GOD ONE OF THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE
[1:32:16] between the bride and the church? Many
[1:32:18] of them are martyrs.
[1:32:22] They have to be made to do this, MADE TO
[1:32:24] DO THAT, MADE TO DO THIS, MADE TO DO
[1:32:26] THAT. GOD DON'T WANT HIS BRIDE to be
[1:32:29] martyrs.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; He wants us to willingly give him
[1:32:34] whatever he wants. WHY? THAT'S THE WAY
[1:32:37] HE DID.
[1:32:39] It's our ability to selfmp.
[1:32:44] Read with me and I'll find a place of
[1:32:46] closure in a bit. Isaiah 53:2.
[1:32:51] Let's read about Jehovah's servant
[1:32:54] in service for death.
[1:32:58] For he shall grow up before him as a
[1:32:59] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[1:33:02] ground. He hath no form nor clumlinist.
[1:33:06] But when we shall see him, there is no
[1:33:08] beauty
[1:33:10] that we should desire him.
[1:33:13] So even when he come,
[1:33:16] he did not come as a handsome man.
[1:33:20] A man that people would look at him and
[1:33:22] say, "Oh wow, LOOK WHAT A PRINCE. MY
[1:33:25] LOOK AT THAT JAWBONE. LOOK AT THAT CHIN.
[1:33:27] Look at that.
[1:33:30] When brother Brandham saw him in the
[1:33:31] sagebrush field
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; and he looked on him, he said with the
[1:33:37] features and the face that he had,
[1:33:41] it was a man that you'd look at him
[1:33:44] and kind of feel sorry for him
[1:33:47] with pity.
[1:33:50] Not a profile of a rock and roll star or
[1:33:53] a Hollywood star.
[1:33:56] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:59] HE HAS DESPISED AND REJECTED A MAN, A
[1:34:01] MAN OF sorrows and acquainted with
[1:34:04] grief.
[1:34:06] WE HID AS IT WERE OUR FACES FROM HIM.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; So we hid from him.
[1:34:15] WE HID AS IT WERE OUR FACES FROM HIM. HE
[1:34:18] WAS DESPISED AND WE ESTEEMED HIM NOT.
[1:34:24] Surely he has borne our griefs and
[1:34:26] carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[1:34:29] him stricken,
[1:34:31] [snorts] smitten of God, and afflicted.
[1:34:35] But he was wounded for our
[1:34:36] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[1:34:39] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:34:42] peace
[1:34:43] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:34:46] healed. All we like sheep have gone
[1:34:49] astray and we have turned everyone to
[1:34:51] his own way. And the Lord has laid ON
[1:34:53] HIM THE INIQUITY OF US ALL. HE WAS
[1:34:57] OPPRESSED AND HE was afflicted
[1:35:01] yet he opened not his mouth. He has
[1:35:04] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[1:35:06] as a sheep before her shearers is dumb.
[1:35:10] So he openeth not his mouth. And yet out
[1:35:13] of his mouth went the universe,
[1:35:16] the stars,
[1:35:19] all the greatness of creation.
[1:35:22] But now he chose
[1:35:24] not to say a thing.
[1:35:28] He was taken from prison and from
[1:35:30] judgment. who shall declare his
[1:35:32] generation? FOR HE WAS CUT OFF OF THE
[1:35:35] land of the living. Listen to this. For
[1:35:37] the transgression
[1:35:40] of my people.
[1:35:43] He was SENT TO THE EARTH FOR A PURPOSE.
[1:35:49] He was cut off for the transgression of
[1:35:53] my people. Was he stricken. He made his
[1:35:57] grave with the wicked and with the rich
[1:35:59] IN HIS DEATH BECAUSE HE HAD DONE NO
[1:36:01] VIOLENCE,
[1:36:03] neither was there any deceit in his
[1:36:05] mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[1:36:09] him. He hath put him TO GRIEF WHEN THOU
[1:36:13] SHALT MAKE HIS SOUL, NOT JUST his blood,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; not just his flesh, his soul.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; An offering for sin. Can't you see the
[1:36:24] lamb would come up and the man in the
[1:36:26] Old Testament would lay his hand on the
[1:36:28] heads of that lamb and the blood would
[1:36:30] gush OUT ALL OVER HIM. BUT THE MAN'S
[1:36:32] nature was not changed because the lamb
[1:36:34] did not have a soul. The blood SPOKE AS
[1:36:37] A CHEMISTRY AS A PAINT. But when that
[1:36:40] lamb HUNG UPON THE CROSS, ELI ELI
[1:36:43] [screaming]
[1:36:44] SEBASTI, MY GOD, MY GOD, why is thou
[1:36:47] forsaken me? His soul is being offered
[1:36:51] for AN ATONEMENT. WHY? SO THAT you and I
[1:36:54] could come down here 2,000 YEARS LATER
[1:36:57] AND PARTAKE OF THAT SAME SOUL, THAT SAME
[1:37:01] NATURE OF THE LORD JESUS, NOT JUST TO
[1:37:04] PAINT AND US GO ON LIVING OUR SAME
[1:37:06] SINFUL LIVES, BUT BEING BORN OF THE
[1:37:09] SPIRIT OF GOD, FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[1:37:11] GHOST AND BE PARTAKERS of the divine
[1:37:14] nature and live WHAT KIND OF LIFE? A
[1:37:16] LIFE OF [screaming] GODLINESS.
[1:37:23] Praise God.
[1:37:25] [sighs]
[1:37:25] [panting]
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[1:37:33] He has put him decree. For thou shalt
[1:37:35] make his soul an offering for sin.
[1:37:38] He shall
[1:37:40] see his seed.
[1:37:46] He shall prolong his days. And the
[1:37:49] pleasure of the Lord
[1:37:52] shall prosper in his hand. He shall see
[1:37:55] of the travail of his soul and shall be
[1:37:58] satisfied. By his knowledge shall my
[1:38:02] righteous servant
[1:38:05] servant.
[1:38:07] Justify many. For he shall bear their
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; iniquities.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't just take your drinking. He
[1:38:17] didn't just take your immorality.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; He wanted to take one of man's greatest
[1:38:23] faults,
[1:38:24] pride,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; arrogance.
[1:38:32] Therefore will I divide him a portion
[1:38:34] with the great,
[1:38:36] and he shall divide the spoil
[1:38:39] with the strong.
[1:38:44] That's the kind of king he is.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; He who deserved all the glory.
[1:38:53] But he said, "Father,
[1:38:56] I don't want it all.
[1:38:58] I would that they would be with me where
[1:39:01] I am,
[1:39:03] but I don't want them to be
[1:39:05] empty-handed. Father,
[1:39:08] I want to give them things.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I want to reward them. I don't want them
[1:39:12] just to have life.
[1:39:15] I want to give them things.
[1:39:28] Therefore will I divide him a portion
[1:39:30] with the great, and he shall divide the
[1:39:33] spoil with the strong. Notice the divine
[1:39:35] ORDER OF GODHEAD. GOD THE FATHER THE
[1:39:38] ETERNAL WHICH COULD NOT DIE SAID I WILL
[1:39:40] GIVE him and then he will give
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS US TO
[1:39:47] DO. GOD HAS GIVEN US LIFE AND HE WANTS
[1:39:50] US TO TURN AROUND TRY TO SHARE IT WITH
[1:39:51] OTHERS. TRY TO SHARE ENCOURAGEMENT.
[1:39:54] Don't go around beating PEOPLE DOWN ALL
[1:39:56] THE TIME. TRY TO LIFT THEM UP. AMEN.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; He shall divide the spoil with the
[1:40:04] strong because he hath poured out his
[1:40:07] soul unto death. He was numbered with
[1:40:12] the transgressors,
[1:40:14] and he bare the sin not of everybody,
[1:40:17] but of many,
[1:40:20] and made intercession
[1:40:23] for the transgressors.
[1:40:26] I found this in studying in a book
[1:40:28] called Wilmington's Handbook of the
[1:40:31] Bible.
[1:40:33] I thought it was really good. I wanted
[1:40:35] to share it with you this morning.
[1:40:42] He left heaven's glory
[1:40:45] for earth's poverty.
[1:40:49] He made himself nothing or emptied
[1:40:53] himself.
[1:40:55] He hid his heavenly fame
[1:41:00] in an earthly frame.
[1:41:05] [laughter]
[1:41:07] Even though he retained every single
[1:41:09] attribute of deity while on earth,
[1:41:12] he surrendered the independent exercise
[1:41:16] of those divine
[1:41:19] characteristics.
[1:41:22] He took the humble position of a slave.
[1:41:26] It did not come as a mighty human king
[1:41:28] or philosopher
[1:41:31] but as a lowly servant.
[1:41:33] He taught our language,
[1:41:36] wore our clothes,
[1:41:41] ate our food,
[1:41:43] breathed our air,
[1:41:47] and endured
[1:41:49] our vicious treatment.
[1:41:53] After Paul talks about in humbling
[1:41:55] himself
[1:41:57] in Philippians 2:9, then Paul says,
[1:41:59] "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[1:42:03] him and given him a name which is above
[1:42:07] every name. That at the name of Jesus,
[1:42:11] every knee should bow of the things in
[1:42:14] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:42:17] under the earth. and that every tongue
[1:42:19] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:42:24] to the glory of God the Father.
[1:42:29] And the church said,
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; "Let's stand together."
[1:42:39] [applause]
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Down from his glory area.
[1:42:49] Hebrews chapter 2 verse 9. But we see
[1:42:52] Jesus
[1:42:54] who was made a little lower
[1:43:00] than the angels for the suffering of
[1:43:02] death crowned with glory and honor
[1:43:07] that he by the grace of God should taste
[1:43:10] death
[1:43:12] for every man. The word lower is to make
[1:43:15] less or inferior
[1:43:18] in dignity,
[1:43:20] to decrease
[1:43:22] in authority
[1:43:24] or popularity.
[1:43:27] So we see Jesus who was made a little
[1:43:31] lower. Can you imagine? He didn't just
[1:43:33] come down beneath his own position,
[1:43:36] but even the angels would look down on
[1:43:39] him.
[1:43:41] lower than the angels.
[1:43:44] Verse 10, for it became him
[1:43:47] for whom are all things and by whom
[1:43:52] are all things
[1:43:54] and bringing many sons
[1:43:57] unto glory
[1:44:00] to make the captain
[1:44:03] of their salvation
[1:44:06] perfect through sufferings.
[1:44:10] And the word captain literally means
[1:44:12] pioneer.
[1:44:15] One who opens the way
[1:44:20] for others to follow.
[1:44:25] In verse 11, for both he that sanctifies
[1:44:28] and they who are sanctified
[1:44:32] are all of one.
[1:44:34] For which cause?
[1:44:38] He is not ashamed
[1:44:41] to call them
[1:44:43] brethren.
[1:44:47] So how does it feel
[1:44:50] to be called brothers and sisters
[1:44:55] of God?
[1:45:04] You see, it should not exalt our flesh.
[1:45:08] It should not exalt our pride.
[1:45:11] It should humble us.
[1:45:15] For both he that sanctifies and they who
[1:45:18] are sanctified are all of one, which
[1:45:20] cause he is not ashamed to call them
[1:45:26] brethren.
[1:45:28] Paul goes on to tell us, "For he
[1:45:31] [snorts] by one offering
[1:45:34] hath perfected forever
[1:45:37] [snorts] them
[1:45:41] that are sanctified.
[1:45:45] He is not ashamed of you."
[1:45:49] But brother Donnie, I've made so many
[1:45:50] mistakes. Even that don't make him
[1:45:53] ashamed.
[1:45:55] But I've fallen short. Me too.
[1:45:59] Me too.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; I've got family members I don't mind
[1:46:03] telling you. They've embarrassed me.
[1:46:07] I got cousins, uncles, different people
[1:46:10] in my family on both sides. They've done
[1:46:12] things, said things, behaved in such way
[1:46:16] it's it's it's embarrassed me. They'd
[1:46:19] probably say the same thing about me.
[1:46:23] But there's something about Jesus and
[1:46:25] the way that he looks at his love,
[1:46:28] which you are. His love, the love of his
[1:46:30] heart,
[1:46:33] not only took my shame when he was here,
[1:46:36] but now he's here for me today to help
[1:46:38] me.
[1:46:40] And even when I fall flat on my face,
[1:46:43] he's there to say, "Donnie,
[1:46:45] get up. Come on, get up. You messed up.
[1:46:51] I knew you would.
[1:46:53] But I forgive you,
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Lord. I can't go back to church. Oh. Oh,
[1:46:57] everybody will know. Everybody will
[1:46:59] know. Are you serving everybody or are
[1:47:01] you serving me?
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Sure, there's shame and humiliation when
[1:47:07] we mess up. We just have to bear it.
[1:47:09] Just bear it. Come on back.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; You're coming to church where everybody
[1:47:13] else does the same thing. It's just
[1:47:14] different things.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:20] Church is sort of like a hospital.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; A lot of ER services, you know.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; I mean, you go to a doctor every now and
[1:47:28] then for a well visit,
[1:47:31] right? I went not long ago for a well
[1:47:33] visit to see my doctor. I like him.
[1:47:36] Really nice doctor. Brother William
[1:47:37] Smith's got got him in with me. My
[1:47:39] doctor retired. Really nice guy.
[1:47:41] Christian guy. Where where you been?
[1:47:43] Where you been going? You taking care of
[1:47:45] William? I said, man, you've asked me a
[1:47:47] hard thing, boy.
[1:47:52] You got anything wrong? Nope. Got any
[1:47:53] complaints? Nope. Nurses come in. Blood
[1:47:55] pressure's good. Heart this, this,
[1:47:57] everything good? Anything you want to
[1:47:58] tell the doctor? Nope. Well visit.
[1:48:02] Most people come to this church don't
[1:48:04] come to church for well visits.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; It's ER, ET, ED. I mean, they've got
[1:48:09] everything in the world going on. They
[1:48:11] feel like they're losing their mind.
[1:48:12] They're losing their home. They're
[1:48:14] losing everything in the world's ER
[1:48:15] service. I'VE GOT TO TALK TO BROTHER Jim
[1:48:17] Urgent. You don't ask me. I ask brother
[1:48:19] Jim Witson. They use them words all the
[1:48:21] TIME ON HIM. IT'S ABSOLUTELY EMERGENCY.
[1:48:23] I'VE GOT TO SEE BROTHER Donnie today.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; But you know what? I don't mind our
[1:48:30] church being like a hospital.
[1:48:34] I don't mind it at all.
[1:48:37] I just want to be the right kind of ER
[1:48:40] doctor.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. So when you get here,
[1:48:44] God will help me in his divine mercy to
[1:48:48] know how to administer to you what you
[1:48:50] have need of. I'm willing to roll up my
[1:48:53] sleeves and if you've had an accident,
[1:48:56] you've busted your mouth all over your
[1:48:57] face and you you've done this and that
[1:49:00] and the other. I I'm willing to get
[1:49:01] involved in your blood. I'm willing to
[1:49:04] get involved in your mess.
[1:49:08] I tell Carol all the time sometimes I
[1:49:10] feel like I work for the sanitation
[1:49:12] department of heaven from some of the
[1:49:14] stuff I have to deal with.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; But somebody's got to do it.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz I ain't just looking at you at your
[1:49:23] struggles now and what you are
[1:49:27] by a supernatural uncction. I believe
[1:49:30] one day I'm going to be looking at some
[1:49:32] of you same people walking down streets
[1:49:35] of gold
[1:49:37] and you and I will take off for a walk
[1:49:39] and we'll go walking down them beautiful
[1:49:42] streets and as brother Ram kind of gave
[1:49:44] an analogy of it at one of his sisters
[1:49:46] there when we get up around Papa's
[1:49:48] throne
[1:49:50] and said to go by some of the one of the
[1:49:52] sisters I sister so and so said oh we we
[1:49:55] haven't seen you for a couple thousand
[1:49:58] years were you what you been doing. So,
[1:50:00] I've been right here by my flower garden
[1:50:02] for the last 10,000 years.
[1:50:05] I just been here taking care of things.
[1:50:07] You imagine, friends,
[1:50:09] there'll be no alarm clocks. There'll be
[1:50:11] no beds cuz we don't be won't be
[1:50:13] sleeping. There'll be no place to go.
[1:50:17] There'll be no sickness.
[1:50:19] We'll just be fellowshipping for
[1:50:21] eternity.
[1:50:23] will have houses, parks, streams, trees,
[1:50:29] animals.
[1:50:31] Hallelujah.
[1:50:37] I plan on seeing you there.
[1:50:40] You won't look like you do today.
[1:50:43] Your glasses will be gone. Your contacts
[1:50:45] will be gone. Your wrinkles, mine, too.
[1:50:50] And we'll be forever young.
[1:50:54] But let's come this way
[1:50:56] by ourselves
[1:50:59] and he will exalt us
[1:51:02] in due time.
[1:51:07] Thank you Lord Jesus.

[1:57:54] Dwell [singing]
[1:57:55] us
[1:57:57] in me. [music]
[1:58:04] Dearly beloved, we are gathered here on
[1:58:06] the side of God and in the face of this
[1:58:08] company to join together this man and
[1:58:12] this woman in the holy state of
[1:58:14] matrimony which is commanded in the
[1:58:15] scripture to be entered into reverently,
[1:58:18] discreetly, and in the fear of God.
[1:58:21] These two persons present have come to
[1:58:24] be joined together today in this union.
[1:58:28] Believing you have considered this
[1:58:30] solemn obligation, I will present to you
[1:58:33] the marriage covenant.
[1:58:35] Lord Jesus, will you have this woman to
[1:58:38] be your lawful wed?
[1:58:42] Will you love her? Will you care for
[1:58:44] her? Will you cherish her?
[1:58:47] Will you actually serve her
[1:58:50] and becoming her atonement and her
[1:58:53] sacrifice for reconciliation?
[1:58:57] Do you promise to keep her, to love her,
[1:59:01] to put her above all others
[1:59:04] so long as eternity rolls on?
[1:59:08] He said, "I do.
[1:59:11] Will you,
[1:59:15] Hallelujah,
[1:59:16] take this man to be your lawful wedded
[1:59:20] husband?
[1:59:22] Do you promise to love him, to serve
[1:59:25] him,
[1:59:26] forsaking all others, and cleave thee
[1:59:29] only unto him so long as you both shall
[1:59:32] live?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Will you put him above your mother,
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; your father, yourself, your cousins,
[1:59:41] your aunts, your uncles, your job?
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; You will give your all to him.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; I will require a token.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; In this case, there's only one ring in
[2:00:00] this wedding,
[2:00:03] and the Lord Jesus is providing it.
[2:00:08] I will tell you what's inscribed upon
[2:00:11] this ring.
[2:00:15] A little tiny inscription on the inside.
[2:00:19] Oh, how awesome.
[2:00:22] I've married a lot of people and I've
[2:00:23] seen different inscriptions. I don't
[2:00:25] think I've ever seen one quite like
[2:00:27] this. What a strange thing.
[2:00:32] It says, "I loved her before the
[2:00:35] foundation of the world."
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; And actually, I slipped this ring on her
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; word fingering
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:00:47] Amen.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; For as much
[2:00:56] as Jesus Christ, the Almighty God,
[2:01:00] and his blood washed bride, have
[2:01:03] consented together by giving an
[2:01:06] exchanging of rings and exchanging their
[2:01:08] vows.
[2:01:11] I pronounce they are men and wife.
[2:01:15] You may kiss your bride.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Now they turn and walk up to the edge of
[2:01:25] eternity.
[2:01:27] Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:01:30] cereubams, saraphims,
[2:01:33] angelic host,
[2:01:36] I present to you Mr. and miseries
[2:01:42] Jesus Christ.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; And before long
[2:01:50] here they will go away.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:01:59] Jesus may be telling her this as they
[2:02:02] walk down the aisle.
[2:02:04] Come away, my love.
[2:02:07] the table spread in splendor.
[2:02:12] I've got a great big banquet
[2:02:15] already lined out for you, darling.
[2:02:20] [laughter]
[2:02:26] Thousands of miles long.
[2:02:30] There's your loved ones, your friends.
[2:02:35] Come, darling.
