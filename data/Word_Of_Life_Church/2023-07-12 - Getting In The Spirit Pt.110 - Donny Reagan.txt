the different names of preachers and church members at laity and alike that had passed in the last few years and the list was so overwhelming it's one after another after another after another brother brother Rose freezeberry just recently brother Hildebrand of course and we purchased many maintenance in Edmonton and he was talking about the different preachers that we had preached for and the more you think about it we're getting more and more and more on the other side before long there'll be more of them there than there'll be left of us on the Earth I don't know about you I want to be ready every day yeah now that's not just an old person's thing I know I'm getting older I know all that but I think it's a Young Person's ideology or it should be too because none of us have a promise of even being able to walk out these doors tonight so we want to be ready whether you're 60 or 50 or 20 or 15. don't we because we never know when our time will come but we have this promise Satan cannot take us under God is done I'm so glad we believe that tonight everybody doing well yeah are you happy to be a Christian I'm as mad at the Devil what God bless you let's let's turn together tonight if you would in First Corinthians chapter three hope you're not getting tired of me reading these these verses here I absolutely love them because it's such a display of God's God's grace and the magnification of Grace coming from the Old Testament to the new uh special contrasting good works and bad works of course and then looking at the Old Testament how the works there pretty much defines your soul and defines your destiny well in the New Testament a person could have absolutely wind up being wrong as far as it works and yet still be a Christian I know that stumbles a lot of folks but I'm certainly glad that God has such Mercy First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work and notice what it is every man's work of what sort that it is if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss yet he himself shall be saved yet so as by far now you see Grace has been so magnified from the Old Testament you look at the characters in the Old Testament they lost their Works they were lost I find it so amazing that God under Grace has provided such a place that there can be good people that love the Lord that are saved people not bride but saved people they can wind up in absolutely the wrong Doctrine the wrong works but yet because they have trusted the Lord an element of blindness that has forbidden them from seeing the full truth God will have mercy on them Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound how many lots of people remember tonight as we pray God bless you let's just hold our requests in our hearts Heavenly Father we counted such an honor and a privilege that we could be gathered together I've been so excited Lord today to be able to come back to church and Lord to be able to sing and worship and pray and hear the word and Lord would just come with anticipation tonight to see what you're going to do see what you're going to say how you're going to move we're just sharing of such wonderful things that's happening among us and we know it's because you're among us so we pray tonight Lord that you would meet with us and this Wednesday night service that you would take the service move me aside Lord help me that I can just become as this microphone that Lord God I will follow the unction of the Holy Ghost shut my mouth to anything that would displease you may the presence of God anoint me but anoint the people as well that we can be able to be submissive to the spirit of God it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen God bless you may be seated I'm going to speak to you for just a little bit tonight land this foundation on a very odd side of Supernatural gifts we believe in Supernatural gifts do we not we thank God for every gift that God has and every gift that God has Among Us and the way I feel about it I want every gift that God has for our church I want every one of them myself I want for us as individuals to be submissive to the spirit of God and let God be able to use us but there's also another side to Supernatural gifts now this is a frightening side that a person can actually have a gift that comes from God now it's not a fake it's not an impersonation but it's a real gift that comes from God and they can take that gift and use that gift in such a way that it will cause them to go to hell hello to you too yes they can actually use a gift in such a way that will cause them to go to hell now listen carefully the Harvest Time in 1964. now what she's talking about the devil when he come to the Lord Jesus and he made three attacks against the Lord Jesus and he parallels those attacks with a child of God every believer that they will be faced with the same three three things and he he takes it and shows how that when Satan offered these things to the Lord Jesus and then the Lord Jesus responded and then Satan used another approach and then the Lord Jesus responded and Satan used again another approach and then he responded again now once he said he makes you a supernatural offer I was talking about the devil how that the devil if he cannot stop you from serving God now he's able to do that to a lot of people the oh it's too hard it's too difficult I can't live right I I can't go through all that I don't want it well you don't have to try very hard on people like that but there's other people and they say oh no no I'm going to stay with that word I love God I'll tell you one thing I'm going to go on with God but you see he doesn't stop there but he will realign and then he will try to offer you something totally different now he will try to offer you something that seems almost impossible because you think that only God would be able to offer what the prophet is fixing to tell us but notice what brother REM says then he makes you a supernatural author okay so if he cannot stop you from going on with God and well I'm going back to the world I'm going back to my music I'm going back to the way I've done this and that and the other then you say no no no I'm not going to do it I'm sold out I'm going home as God well he just realigns himself and then he realigns to your confession and then it'll say okay all right fine so you I see then you are more determined than I thought you were so what I'm going to have to do is realign on where you are and I'm going to offer you not the world I'm going to offer you drinking I'm not going to offer you things like that but I will offer you tongues I'll offer you a gift I'll offer you something Supernatural but it'll be just a little bit off the word now that is much more deceiving than smoking right that's much more deceiving than vodka whiskey beer robbing a bank right so this is something in Satan's Arsenal that many people would never sing that he has access to but Satan actually has access to Supernatural gifts watch this now it says I'm going to come back to this so just before closing see if he can't tempt you away from the word now it says no no I'm going to stay with a word then he'll give you a supernatural offer he said I'll tell you what you get up here and dive off the temple now this is what he told Jesus now I want you to notice what he's offering to Jesus it's for Jesus to be a show-off now you see this is where many people mess up whenever they made up their mind I'm not going back to the world no sir I'll tell you one thing I burn all them Bridges behind me but then Satan will make them an offer to be a supernatural show-off so they you know they take what God's done and they begin to brag and if you notice it starts out so mildly and such a small mild mannered form and then it'll transition to where that becomes more and more and more about them and less and less and less about Jesus anybody here tonight that can perform a miracle you're free to do so right now anybody here who can heal anyone you're free to do it hello testing one two anybody that can pray the prayer of face without needing God's help you're welcome to do it my feet still bothering me I'll be the first one come lay your hands on them now see most of us we find that repulsive don't we because Satan don't come that way he comes in more of a slyway but it was your prayer you was the one that was the most sincere they was 583 932 praying for the same person but God heard your prayer and how do you know that for sure so you see Satan then will begin to make people a supernatural offer to where they feel like their prayer their anointing whatever more is more special more Supernatural how can you make Supernatural more Supernatural if it's supernatural It's Supernatural is it not now watch this is so strange and odd brother Rand doesn't say this anywhere else and the entirety of the message worded quite like this except in this message here he will give you a supernatural offer I'll tell you what you get up down you dive off the temple and bring back up see show the people that you can do something Supernatural now remember when the prophet preaches this he actually says that the Lord Jesus was tempted to do it so he was tempted to act like this Supernatural something was that his disposal whenever he wanted it so all right the devil wants me to do it I'll prove I'm a man of God well I saw that in Pentecost yeah I saw a lot of them guys running around with other men's wives all kinds of sin in their life and yet get in the pulpit and make the challenge now the time has come for God to testify of his man uh-huh I've seen all kinds of Supernatural events take place and come to find out that man was an absolute liar adulter money launcher and all kinds of things well praise the Lord that's why when I come to the message they are insert here in the morning once the end time I felt like a bird let out of a prison because I'd had them questions for years and years in my life now watch this show the people that you can do something Supernatural boy he got him there now watch this is it now watch when you get to the end where this temptation come now brother Brown is identifying this as a Temptation maybe he might let some of you speak in tongues and think you got it the devil the devil but you see if he can make you sing you've got the Holy Ghost and all he needs to do is cause a confusion of tongues that would be an easy trade-off I hope you understand what I'm fixing to say demon Spirits can talk in tongues that shouldn't stumble you what are tons there are tons of men and tongues of angels so whenever the apostles on them receive the Holy Ghost and they begin to speak in tongues remember the prophet said part of the miracle was that it was in the hearing of the people that was there each one of them from Cappadocia from all the different nationalities that were there part of the miracle was they heard them speak in their own language what was the tongues they were speaking at it was known tongues or known languages of the world you think the devil can't talk in Greek you think the devil came to talk in French you can't you think he can't talk in Spanish do you think he can't talk in the other language of the world why of course he can so you know as well as I knew that there are people that go into a coma I read a one not long ago the individual was there for six months spoke English only language they knew come out of that coma and spoke perfect French they didn't even know French they knew french fry french toast you know that sort of thing but they could no longer speak English but spoke French how is that even possible something happened in their body and it changed them well you imagine for a lot of Pentecostals of course this was exactly what they was looking for brother Jack oh my how many did I see when you're making all the call and they'd go up and Jesus you got it you got it you got locked you got what oh my God now what's this he says or he might even let you prophesy though it not be with the word I've seen people stand up and prophesy I was as contrary to the word is the East says from the West that's pretty contrary isn't it see it's the word that you live by them Supernatural gifts Satan listen Satan can hand them out by the handfuls not God Satan Satan can hand them out by the handfuls now listen to this certainly that don't mean one thing oh my goodness I figured y'all be quiet but I thought at least somebody would be breathing y'all go ahead and breathe I don't want y'all to die on me now brother Donnie the devil yes but you see he would only hand them out to people who would believe in them what for to trick them to make them think they got the Holy Ghost when they don't or they put such emphasis on a gift and be a little bit off the word Prophet tells us about that the church age book that people would operate a gift with a margin of error in it hit Miss hit Miss hit miss my God don't miss praise the Lord I said my God don't miss my God don't lie if God says something it is that way is that right but yet people if that's their inclination then Satan will want to give them a substitute but friends there's so much real why in the world would any of us want a substitute or a fake for a real genuine baptism Brother Don don't you believe in the gifts with all of my heart and I've said it for years of my life I have prayed and prayed and hoped that I would be able to see it before I left this Earth all nine gifts in true operation I've seen enough of the other kind you say well just trash them all it's one of God's words in the Bible if I'm going to trash that what about the cross what about the resurrection if it's in the Bible there's going to be somebody it I believe that's going to have a real manifestation of what God wants I'm talking about impersonators I ain't talking about somebody that wants to be a big shot I'm talking about somebody that wants to be nothing and let the Lord use them [Applause] oh my now with that in mind I want you to listen to this now so go on into this that a person then could have a real genuine gift from God and depending on how they use that gift that gift could actually be the means by which it leads them to the regions of the lost now in reality they've been better off if they've never had the gift they've been better off if they would have never had it now watch this again the prophet says a man can take a Divine gift and send his soul to hell with it now you think my goodness I could see that with a pack of cigarettes a fifth of whiskey you know taking somebody else's wife and then doing all that sort of thing but with a gift well of course which you think is the most deceiving a pack of cigarettes or a Divine gift a supernatural gift you know that a gift from God now I don't mean just something that you imagine I mean if God is giving you something and this is the key and give it to your charge aha you've got to use that with the wisdom of God now you see every gift of God is an element of God's glory and God is very precautious and the way he delves these out so every individual that has a real gift from God will get an element of Glory mm-hmm recognition honor so on and so on then it's going to be up to that individual how they will use that God has dispensed that to them and it will take the wisdom of God not the desired of human flesh but the wisdom of God for every individual to use that gift with wisdom because if you don't then you cross over the line from God getting the glory to be for long the line becomes blurred and then the man is sharing Glory with God and people will do that to you yeah they will people will I said people will notice again it says in Phoenix God can't trust his gifts with everybody do you believe that when God gives you a gift you have to watch what you are doing with it so you see the gift comes from God but yet God is not the one that is always operating manipulating the administrative side the administrative side and the operation of it is left of to who you God calls you to be a preacher the Holy Ghost is not the one that will make you study four hours a day three hours a day two hours a day he will give you the ability to study he will give you the ability for God to open up the word and then you will study according to the gift that God gives you but the Holy Ghost won't study for you and then facts you your sermon the Holy Ghost has never faxed me one sermon I've ever preached he's never emailed me one or text me what but I have to do a lot of that myself I have to pray I have to look sometimes at hundreds times hundreds of quotes because I don't want to get one quote and run with it I want to make sure that what I'm preaching is a balanced diet for the saints of God so I want to study it through and through and through to make sure that what I'm bringing is exactly right so the Holy Ghost is not the one who does all of that he inspires you while you do your part well somebody say praise the Lord now you know you realize we've got a lot of good talented folks here that play music and sing and all that but I'm so grateful that they also realize that you could be a tremendous singer but you don't give no time to practice you don't know what song what key you sing it in you don't know nothing well you can get up here and start out in G and then they have to go to F and then they have to go to a flat and then they finally find you on the upper end to be and you've took about five minutes of the people sitting here looking at you think why in the world didn't you do that back there in the music room you could have done it back there and been ready or you can stand up here and do it which one would you rather have do you want a preacher that'll stand up here oh let's see I believe brother Branham said that in uh in uh in was it the deity of Jesus Christ or or was that in Erie Pennsylvania in 1951 at Thy word no I don't believe it I think it might have been believing God maybe in 19 52 well I don't know it don't really matter no way you know what that's a man right there that should have done a whole lot more praying and a whole lot more studying but he's not accepting what God's given and applying himself in the right way well good night you think I was speaking to a preacher's convention wouldn't you but you see what happens that that man gets gets the gift from God and then god holds him responsible for what he does with and I said do you know that a man can take a gift of God and send his soul to hell with it do you understand that's what Judas did if you and I would have been in the days of the Lord Jesus when he chose his disciples I dare say every one of us would have been deceived by Judas Iscariot John was Peter was Matthew was all the rest of them were you know why because Judas did not have an inferior gift his was equivalent to the rest of the brothers Judas could preach listen to me this don't let it stumble you Judas even could cast out devils not by dunamis of an indwelling power but by excusia which is a jurisdiction or an authority given to you by someone who is above you so Judas did not have power within himself to cast out Devils himself being a devil it's an amazing thing because Judas could cast out Devils but he couldn't keep the devil from getting in him oh my goodness he could cast out Devils because Jesus said cast out Devils heal the sick that's the way he did it not because he was righteous not because he was holy not because he was a god-called man in the sense of Peter being one but he was given a gift you imagine he could stand there and preach he could preach and whatever come right down to it and Jesus said one of you is going to betray me Judas had lived such a holy life he had preached the message of that day in such a comparative way to the rest of them that they questioned themself before they questioned him now you know if they'd seen him flirting around with all the young girls and flirting around with the women and seeing him doing this and doing this oh I know who that is that's Judas man you can't trust that guy but he was so up to part with the rest of them they questioned their own credibility before they question him when you know how that they sat at the Last Supper they did not use a table the way we do but they lay down and reclined Jesus would have been said in the middle some of the disciples would have been laying on his left others have been laying on his right Judas Iscariot was the right hand man I know the Last Supper that shows you with him setting up that's not the way it was they actually laid down that's why the Bible said John leaned over on Jesus Muslim why because they were laying down so that that's the way that they ate and Judas they all looked around him when they want to look and they thought oh my goodness Judas is the right hand man Judas is laying right there John's on one side and Judas is on the other and the brothers there annoyed the traditions and they would have looked at it and said Judas he's the he's the one he he's the next one he's going to get Jesus ministry because Jesus is telling them I'm fixing to go boys I'm fixing to leave and when they looked at the way they had them said in order they said Judas is going to get it if you're not have been sitting there you know what with assault Judas is going to get it he was going to get it all right but he wasn't going to get to Holy Ghost but looking at it in the natural mind there was nothing inferior he stood with some messages we'd say but when it come right down to it Judas couldn't get the Holy Ghost he could heal Oh my he could cast out Devils he could preach he could do anything Peter could do and might have done it better than some of the things Peter done but Peter could get the Holy Ghost and Judas couldn't get it oh my but yet as far as gifts you said where did he come where'd the gifts come from the Lord Jesus oh my notice this again the prophet says how many knows that you could send your soul to hell with a Divine gift sure you can he says you have to watch what you're doing how many believes Moses was God's Prophet Say Amen he was God's Prophet but do you know what he done God told him to go down there to speak to the Rock and The Rock was already smitten he said is that right instead of Moses doing what God told him to do he went down and smote The Rock again well that absolutely broke the entire scripture right into right there Christ wasn't smitten twice he was smitten once we just speak to him from now on look what Moses died so Moses strikes The Rock twice and he broke every type and Shadow in the Bible when he done it yet he was God's prophet and he had been given power and he could use that power at his will even when it was wrong God gave him that power and he stands out and said you bunch of rebels Rebels even in his anger boy Moses gets all bent out of shape they've been built to left him at the house wasn't on that service he gets up there and strikes out at the people and then he strikes that rock and God said all right boy all right because you've done this you're not going in oh my goodness Moses smote the rock that broke God's complete program and it was done exactly what God told him not to do well you and I think in our mind well if he'd done what God told him not to do then the power wouldn't be there nope that's not true the power was there and when he smote that rock the water come gushing out totally out of the will of God and people say Oh Glory to God I know I'm in the will of God God blessed me and God done this and God done that yeah I agree totally and God will try us sometimes you know how he tries his people by his word he'll even let you feel led to do something not that he leads you to do it but he will allow you to feel led to do something contrary to his word as I said he don't lead you because the Holy Ghost will never lead you and I contrary to the word but he'll let the devil inspire you and you'll feel led to do a certain thing and yet look in the word the word says this the word says that the word says the message says the message well I know I know but I feel led I feel with it and God will try you to see is your soul birthed by the word or do you go by your feelings praise the Lord maybe I'll ask you again I'm just happy to be or not oh man nothing hers made me happy now don't tell me some of y'all ain't near as happy since we've left Happy Valley I got an email from one of the brothers over in India years ago or after we left the church over at Happy Valley and been a few months back and and he said Brother Don he said why did you rename the church he said I I was so used to Happy Valley he said I thought Happy Valley was a spiritual name I said no there wasn't a spiritual names the name of the community so he thought we was happy in the valley I didn't tell him that y'all wasn't always happy in the valley I didn't tell him that I wasn't always happy in that but he thought it's a spiritual name and he thought they ought to have the same thing I said well that's the name of the community those Happy Valley Baptist Church those Happy Valley this but I believe we can still be a spiritual happy in the valley don't you oh my god notice so he breaks the type when Moses smote the rock that broke God's complete program had he done exactly what God told him to do but he could do it anyhow whether it was God's will or not you see preachers can take their gifts and do things sometimes with them gifts totally out of the will of God and God will honor it people will be healed this and that and the other will happen and say see that glory to God that proves I'm right the word proves we're right not just signs not just wonders well praise the Lord now watch brother Graham knows it sounds strange and he says that that seems strange doesn't it but it wasn't God's will but he was a prophet he could do whatever he wished and what his power would permit him to do oh my I never study along these lines that I don't always think of one of the renowned men in the Old Testament that is a parallel of this by the name of Balaam Balaam is a very odd character to me just me looking at him I can't say I understand but the Jackie Howe all that worked with Balaam but he was a man that was a man of double identity he was a man that lived two lives as it were he's called a soothsayer yet also called a prophet he saw things by vision and by trance and yet he also used enchantments which was witchcraft he was a messed up dude I'm telling you what's this in Numbers Chapter 23 verse 16. I'm the Lord capital L capital r capital D Matt balam and put a word in his mouth wow and hence said go again unto balak and say thus now remember this man by this time had seen an angel of God an angel of God stood in the way and his donkey had more sense than he did and that the donkey's going down through there and then the donkey sees the angel of the Lord and he's beaten a time out of that donkey and finally he opened his eyes and their balance saw it so this man has seen an angel he stepped over what God wanted and moved into the permissive will of God and now God takes this man which has used enchantments and puts a word in his mouth and the Saints said chapter 23 verse 26. but Balaam answered and said unto bailout now you remember what happened you're that Balaam he was hired by balak and he wanted to become curse Israel well he got out there and he got praying got them you know in the presence of the Lord they opened his mouth and he said I see thy cancer Jacob they are goodly they are this and that in heaven and they'll obey them got to prophesy things that was absolutely phenomenal he prophesied one of the greatest Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament a soothsayer wow so balam started prophesying good things and balak I mean he hard him into this denomination to curse that bunch of message people and he got under the anoint he said man I hope my end is life thirst you talking about a Godly bunch of people that said what are you doing I hired you to bless them now notice this is his response but Balaam answered and said unto balak told not of these saying all that the Lord speaketh how must I do I can't help it I was going to blast them and I was going to tell them as an occult and all that sort of thing and the next thing I started saying was glory to God I went to that church it wasn't at all the way I thought it was Hallelujah I come a little bit of skeptical of it my well I come through the prayer line God heal me or my blood pressure God done this and God done that God knows how to make people testify now notice chapter 24 verse 1 and when Balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless Israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments you mean to tell me this man is mixing spiritual gifts with witchcraft I don't think we understand how important one simple thing is to God obedience we tend to think gifts emotion this that the other is the greatest thing I hate to disrupt your fan parade but obedience is one of the greatest things you will ever accomplish for the kingdom of God by not cutting your hair sisters it's one of the greatest things you can ever do why you're obeying God's word the prophet said what gets God's attention keeping his word but we tend to think oh this great thing and this great thing and that great thing those you're going to find out in Matthew 24 that there will be people who have done absolutely phenomenal Miracles and will go to hell why they didn't obey and some of you will walk down streets of gold that have never performed one Miracle at all and it will be said to you well done my good and faithful servant why because you obeyed you repented you got baptized you've done this you've done that the preacher preaching yourself well Lord I'm sorry I've been guilty I didn't know that was wrong Lord I'll quit you don't understand what that does to the heart of God you don't understand just by you getting up every day in praying reading your Bible you understand what it does to the heart of God when you and I praise him in the midst of Trials it's not just so the praise will come out of your mouth it's because you're obeying that's what he wants you to do and when you do that you're obeying what he says I don't understand it he didn't say understand it he just said do it obedience is such a tremendous thing to God kind of go on and balam saw that he pleased the lord to bless Israel and he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the Wilderness now the Wilderness now of course is where Israel is so he's going to go and get on their back parts and see what kind of thoughts that he can find what kind of issues that Sarah because man don't tell what this salary is pretty good and if he don't you know give out some stuff that's going to please all daylight he's going to drop his Social Security and Obey him think of man alive I got to retire this preaching stuff so I got to have something to kind of fall back on so I said if I get among them long enough I guarantee I'll find some fault somewhere look in verse 3. and he took up his parable and said Balaam the son of bior said and the man whose eyes are open have said he hath said which heard the words of God which saw the vision of the almighty where did he hear this name Almighty this was one of the Sacred names of God kept close for Abraham Isaac Jacob where did he hear this name now notice what happens to this guy soothsayer enchantment Seeker he fell into a trance having his eyes wide open so he's standing there kneeling whatever he is and all of a sudden he just goes into this Dimension so a portal if you will was opened up so Balaam is there and he's thinking that out you know balak he's going to get really upset at me and if this is going to happen all of a sudden he just in his eyes are wide open but he's in a rapt or a p t raptured state and he starts hearing the words of God the Almighty and he starts seeing this trance a soothsayer huh I hope you walk out of this building tonight with a different view of a whole lot of things I hope instead of you walking out of this building and thinking well I ain't never spoken tongues I ain't never prophesied I ain't never had no vision I must be a dirt bag I must be absolutely worthless in the eyes of God and what good does a vision or a trance do you if you don't obey God balam will use that gift and wound up taking him to hell fell into a trance having his eyes open verse 5. how goodly are thy tents oh Jacob and thy Tabernacles oh Israel verse 16 he hath said which heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the most high again where did he hear this name most high Abraham was the first man of the Bible that ever used this name where did he hear it he's a heathen this man not only broke into a trance but according to his words listen what he said that he broke into the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance having his eyes opened listen to these words friends I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not not there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel he's speaking of the Lord Jesus this is one that the magized this is what the majors God this is one of the scriptures they used when they was following the star that led them to where he was born and this was sad by a soothsayer under the anointing of God my thank you Jesus I live right thank you Jesus I can live right thank you I can be born again thank you I can have the Holy Ghost oh my God I may not be a great spiritual person I might may not be a great person that you know has all kinds of this and that never happened to but thank God I can be saved thank God I didn't have the Holy Ghost thank God I've got a desire to obey the word show me show me I'll do my best to do it with all of my heart show me why I'm wrong I'll repel I'll make it right I'll do what God wants me to do because I've got a desire told me him I may never see a vision like this I may never be able to move into another dimension as others do but I thank God there's one thing I can do I can live right I've got a desire to obey his word you ought to be so grateful tonight that you can do their friends there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab now remember where he's at balac is the king of Moab that when his salary Social Security welfare check you know everything just went out the window you imagine be like a sinner or listen this now what's he going to say now what's he going to say [Music] I said look at good Lord ain't never seen like that my life look at his eyes there shall arise a star out of Jacob a scepter shall come o Israel how goodly are thy dance I don't see him now I can't know him now but there will come one he saw the Lord Jesus oh my goodness and he shall Smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of chefs numbers 31 16. you remember when the children of Israel now sometime after this they begin to look upon the daughters of Moab and invited them to come over to a big convention they was having the Bible says that they begin to commit adultery with these Daughters of Moab you remember the story of course whenever the man puts an end to the plague and the justice of God Judgment of God breaks out on them but notice what caused this behold these cause the children of Israel through the council of Balaam you see his prophecy was a hundred percent accurate but it was his teaching so when Balaam got out from under the anointing he gathered the heads together and said I found their problem I found their weakness all their women have long hair and no women aren't allowed to wear many skirts to church and their women can't do this and can't do that so if you'll set up your denominational daughters out there in front of them put on makeup let them you know cut their hair let them do this and that another the more boys will fall for them the same man that saw Jesus the same man that knew the secret names of God Yeah by prophecy but it was his teaching his counsel so he calls all these heads together said now this is what you do you do this and you do that and you do that and you'll get them notice the Bible says behold these cause the children of Israel through the Council of Balaam to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of pior and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord in this amazing the Devil Himself could not Smite him but if he could cause them to become what disobedient to the word then the hand of God of Mercy would move back and he will allow the angel of death to Smite him so there's people dying everywhere and how did that come to pass under this preacher Prophet if you wish to call him that soothsayer under his counsel his teaching um praise the Lord everybody Joshua chapter 13 verse 22. now your battle breaks out sometime later listen who they kill Balaam also the son of Dior read it with me so a soothsayer prophesied Messianic prophecy astounding is it not Balaam the son of the or the soothsayer did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain so here Balaam actually lived after the Council of those that had committed adulter with the daughters of Moab had died Balaam went right on to live under this denominational auspice but the sword of God finally caught up with him second Peter chapter 2 verse 15. which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of Balaam the son of bosar who loved the wages of unrighteousness so here we see from Peter part of balaam's fall it was the Love of Money and it was the wages of unrighteousness and yet this man had a gift and that gift will eventually be part of his Destiny which will lead him to hell can you imagine this man standing Before the Throne of God what will he try to say I prophesied about your coming I'll prophesy this I blessed Israel but you also by your teaching pull them out of the Assembly of Israel to the assembly of moabites he pulled them out of the congregation of Israel oh my goodness you know friends whenever we think of the anointing of God now we're talking about rewards and works and the things that God wants us to do but you see how it works can actually work against us if it's not coupled with Divine obedience to God's Divine program you see God will try you after you become a Christian God tries leaders he tries preachers he tried Balaam it's easy to see he tried Moses he said his sin he failed every man that's ever been on the earth that was gifted of God has been tried and for many of them it's not when they first start out that's when they've been around for a while and they begin to feel confident the prophet tells us it's an influence of course they feel like they've got a little Kingdom built up so they they don't pray like they used to they don't think they have to be as spiritual as they used to so they can start you know doing this and doing that and not praying not being sincere and it'll catch up with them I don't care who they are our sincerity must be maintained the entirety of our life we can never let go of it our dedication to the Lord Jesus is that right can I have a few more minutes of your time let's read in first Samuel if you would chapter 15 verse 17 the character here is Samuel and Samuel is speaking to King Saul and Saul had by now become arrogant and proud and thinking of what he had done and what he had accomplished and Samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight you see the downfall of Great Men is not just when the people around them will try to make an idol out of them but it's when they begin to believe it that will always be I don't care who you are look friends if a man is going to be made to fall because people make an idol out of him then brother Branham would have been gone and destroyed years and years ago because people literally made him the Lord Jesus but God is not going to hold brother Branham responsible for what a bunch of Knuckleheads do around this message but that's not the danger for a real servant of God alone but the danger is when he begins to believe it about himself that he's so exclusive he's so anointed he can sing above everybody else and play the guitar play the organ or whatever it is he plays he's a little bit better than this and a little bit better than that a little bit better than somewhere else we are a body my little toe is ugly and some of most of you ain't never seen in your entire life but I hope I never lose a little Feller he's kind of hanged at being stuck on the side of the mother he ain't there as big as the big one he ain't they're as big as the second one and they're as big as the middle one but I'm glad I've got him my little fingers kind of t9y and small but I hope I never lose that little feather on a saw I hope I get to keep him the rest of my life praise the lord it's the same with folks that we may look out in the body well he ain't got much of a Ministry he ain't much of a singer well I'll tell you one thing if he's in the body we need him we need big preachers we need little preachers we need medium-sized preachers we need helps in the church we need governments in the church we did I was somebody would preach with me then hide we need prayer warriors we need young people we need all people we need middle-aged people we want everybody here that God wants here notice Samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight humble lonely and a low opinion of himself a low opinion of himself of his tribe and of his family notice what he says about himself in first Samuel 9 21 and Saul answered and said am I not a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel now this is when the prophet tells him God wants you to be the king notice the heartfelt opinion of this man about himself his family and his tribe had he kept this attitude we would not be reading this story we're fixing to read but you see the attitude changed within himself oh my goodness am I not a pinchamite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel and my family the least of all the families of The Tribe of Benjamin wherefore then speaketh thou so to me now this is his honest heartfelt view of himself brother Darryl this is the waste look at himself the Benjamins the smallest tribe as far as number it was at that time and he said my family is one of the smallest families in the whole tribe why would you come to me if he would have maintained this attitude about himself Oh my he would have had a dynasty that would have lasted a thousand years but he got to looking at himself and say boy look what I've done my goodness I've brought the tribes together we have been fighting battles we have done this and that and the other and we have done this and we have done that oh you probably started out that way we meaning him and the people and God and then somewhere along the way it changed from we to I look what I've done look what I've done now he's fixing to build and a wrecked a memorial right now for this battle that you can read oh to specify you the time but he's wanting to raise a memorial and he's wanting to build a great big Memorial of this battle that he has now won and he's looking at himself now look what I've done look what I've been boy I'll tell you one thing I have turned this thing around and my goodness it was in the office mess ever was I have done this and I have done that it always breaks my heart when I hear somebody go that way whether it's a preacher a deacon a trustee a singer a Sunday school teacher a housewife when they go to talking about them and I me and mine and you think oh no oh no not you not you why you've changed your view about yourself oh my goodness let me have a few more minutes and we'll pick it up again Lord God and the Lord sent thee chapter 15 verse 18. on a journey and he said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then get us thou not obey the voice of the Lord but did us fly upon the spoil and that is evil in the sight of the Lord evil what what evil I mean they didn't molest women there wasn't molesting children they wasn't robbing banks evil what evil was it disobedience to the words of God's prophet now of course they didn't have a written bible and maybe saw a thought well you know what now according to the word in the book of Deuteronomy isn't everything supposed to be proven in the mouth of two or three Witnesses and I don't have two or three witnesses that verifies here what uh what Samuel has said you know Samuel's getting pretty old and maybe he's kind of getting grouchy and mean I mean what man in his right mind but tell a man to go out and kill youngins what man is right man what prophet what what prophet reflecting the love of God well tell me to go over and kill all the people and kill the babies and everything and kill all them fat cattle and them fat sheep oh I don't think I I personally don't think that quote is really necessary what if that one quote separates your soul from death and life heaven hell now he's not refuting that Samuel was God's Prophet watch how he takes us now and twists it and Saul said unto Samuel I have all bathed the voice of the Lord what and have gone the way which the Lord sent me my goodness now this man is so far gone he cannot even see how wrong he is God's Prophet told him to kill everything and do not flying on the spawn don't bring back one animal don't bring back one man kill everything dead but Saul says I brought back AJ why we brought the all these animals here we're going to sacrifice them to the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus we're going to sacrifice them to the Lord but that's what we're going to do I just got that fresh from God praise the Lord that's what I feel led to do but God's Prophet said kill everything but Saul felt led will say or he had a dream or maybe got a word I don't doubt that I just wonder where the word come from and Saul said unto Samuel yay I have obey the force of the Lord I have done nothing wrong I talked to a Saul like this not long ago um yeah it's amazing to me when you show folks scriptures and quotes and they step right over the top of them and do what they're going to do anyway anything you can do me and Carol have a common saying around the house people's going to do what they want to do I don't care what you say you can prophesy in the name of the Lord you can speak in tongues over and you could do whatever they're going to do what they're going to do but the good side about that is so am I and I'm going to serve the Lord you do whatever you want to do okay I have gone the way which the Lord sent me and it brought Agate the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed their malachites but remember it didn't take but a couple of days for King agag to get with his wife and between this time and she became pregnant and this Offspring bore another and for another and then it winds up down in Persia in the time of Queen Esther remember his name remember his name Haman Brother David just preached about it so because he disobeyed God's prophet's word the children of Israel still dealing with this man if he would have carried it out to the latter that part of the story wouldn't have to be written come on children looking at me like you know what I'm talking about every one of us have let a gags live and then it causes us or our children or our grandchildren to still reap because of things that it would have cut the head off of that a gag would have been a whole lot better off and so were to some of our kids my goodness gracious I have utterly destroyed the amalekites his justification just overwhelms me he's standing right there in the face of the man that told him what to do and said I done what you said mom I haven't done anything wrong I am not to blame oh man you're getting all bent out of shape and stuffed torp off after all this stuff you ain't got no love in your heart Samuel let me go down and kill them kids how in the world could God tell the people of Israel kill them baby Canaanites kill them every one of them why because God knew a baby grows up to be an adult that's why God said don't spare the suckling or any of them tell them all you see he could not resist it was his pride this was a custom in their time that you would bring the king back and show your people what you did so instead of following the prophet of God's teaching he wanted to follow the tradition of the day I'm bringing hey gay back boy look at me look at this lead him on a leash or a chain look what I've done rah rah raw yay King Saul yay King Saul now watch him in verse 21. the people Talk of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief things which should have been utterly destroyed okay okay okay I amen the word they should have been destroyed but it wasn't my fault it was the people the people wanted me to do this what a leader a leader that follows what the people wants instead of what the word says Ah look at him he still can't take the blame can he so what's he doing blaming it on the people what my fault don't look at me and who are you the water boy you are the king all you have to do is say hey God's Prophet said we do it this way and that way and that way don't you bring them sheep don't you bring them cattle but instead the people the people the people don't want me to preach against sin anymore the people don't want me to preach against transgenders so I guess it came well if these people don't want me to I'm going to anyhow and if you vote me out I'll preach it on the side of the road I'm gonna follow what the people want I want to follow what the Holy Ghost wants oh my other people the people the people talk me into it well it was the people that pressured me it was the people and there's more of them than there was me I'm just after all King soul what an excuse for a leader but the people took of the small sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly just told okay okay okay I agree I agree with you are you happy now but watch him throws this little religious tone in it to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God notice how he says that not my God thy God does this please you okay get off my case would you you're the prophet of the age all right all right all right so we're doing this so that the Lord your God will be happy okay you're good now look at his attitude friends what happens to his respect of the same man that took the crews of oil and anointed him went down his head run down his eyes and him sitting there quivering and shaking and the prophet said now you'll find your donkeys in such and such a place and you're going to meet some menstruals and they're going to do this and the Bible says the spirit of God Came Upon Saul and Saul swept off his clothes I prophesied naked all day long this guy was messed up on me and the people saw among the prophets I always felt sorry for this guy because he didn't know how to repent it's like he could not ever admit it I messed up big time it's my fault I'm so wrong please even when he tries to grab a hole to Samuel's garment out what's his attitude and he reaches and grabs a hold of it and what he does he tears it he said just as you tore my garment so God has torn the kingdom from you Lord God laughs now go and smite amalek this is what God told him first Samuel 15 3 and utterly destroy all they have and spare them not enslave both man woman infant and suckling this would have seemed terrible would it not I mean you're standing there as a soldier you're told by God to kill a baby you are told by a prophet of God to kill a three-year-old child it would have been brought to a very difficult question would it not Brothers everybody the keys both great brother Byron God's prophets had killed them all so you go into a house there's a man with eight kids first she killed him then you kill his wife he's got a 14 year old a 12 year old 11 year old eight-year-old nine-year-old got one lady in the Cradle you mean to tell me you're gonna walk in there and kill those children if you believe his message you may cry later you may feel awful I don't believe these people were murderers you'll imagine the faces of some of these kids they saw brother Rob later sometimes it ain't easy carrying out God's will but looking at the other side of it to be lost I'd much rather carry it out and weep and cry later than to stand before God do you realize the compromising preacher is going to stand before God and it won't be saying no the next time it'll be God one preacher so sad and I said well other people didn't want me to preach this the people was the one that pressed me to do it the people wanted this and the people wanted that and the people wanted something else they wanted to go into an organization and they didn't want me to preach someone I was going to lose my job several years ago I started a church and that said search the pastor was in such a shape they didn't even have a right to be in the pulpit he'll actually got me run over three times picking me up at the airport and taking me to the hotel he wasn't even in shape physical shape to arrived Drive the Lord put it on my heart while I was there and I talked to him I said brother you don't need to pastor this church you're not you're not fit you're not capable you're just not capable his words were this brother Donny what will I do how will I make a living I said I'd rather be on the side of the road begging bread I said to me God will honor you God will honor you if you admit I could not do this I'm not serving the people his own family come and talk to me after I preach and sit outside in the dark for two hours after the service was over some of the Donnie we didn't help he cannot Pastor the church he called me about two months later and said I took your advice I signed up on Social Security that's the first picture I've ever talked out of preaching I don't mind telling you I fought hell after that you cannot imagine how that made me feel I thought God did I do the right thing yes I did the right thing because that man was not being the right kind of leader well we have to say things that are hurt yes the staff let's read verse 22 here first Samuel 15 Kenneth and Samuel said Health the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord and remember Samuel was a levite and a prophet so he was not doing away with the importance of sacrifice but he was showing if you don't obey God's word no matter how much you sacrifice you'll lose it can you imagine every woman preacher that prays and studies and labors and preachers when she walks before God expecting a reward she will lose every bit of it why she stepped over the top of the word and accepted a Feeling or as Harry and I knew a woman in Pentecost they kept feeling this pull to be a preacher and one night an angel walked into her room and took her Bible she set up in the bed and this Angel's presence and this Angel went over on her desk and got her Bible and handed her her Bible and said God had called her to preach now we all know it wasn't an angel of God I got a letter back on my desk and I noticed it was kind of strange because of return address was handwritten and the return name was Jesus Christ and the address was 777-1357 so I thought oh boy another dear Donny letter letter except they was accusing me of saying something that I never did say and I thought now you know what if Jesus would have sent me this letter he wouldn't have told a big lie he'll tell the truth you can imagine what that woman did she started preaching why she took that experience over the word of God notice Samuel has the Lord as great Delight look at this word pleasure desire longing the good pleasure as the Lord is great and delight and burnt offerings as in obeying friends can you imagine the Delight we bring to the Lord Jesus when we just simply obey his word and Satan tries to make us think it's nothing you're nobody you're just a you obey his words you love him well brother Tony I make so many mistakes and what do you do after you make the mistakes you obey his word and repent and make it right so you're still obeying his word and Satan wants to make us sing we're nothing great we're not doing this and that it brings God such pleasure as in obeying the voice of the Lord be whole to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken beautiful another beautiful word to hear be attentive heed pay attention listen to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams wow but look at the opposite of obedience for Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft Rebellion is a sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry my goodness so when we rebelled against God's word God's Prophet God's teaching I don't think we need that I don't think we have to do I don't think that's required you're rebelling you know offered's God hates that so bad because Satan is the originator of that I know you don't want to hear this but the reason we all find a problem with Rebellion is because we are a hybrid between Eve and Satan say Amen or don't say Amen don't really matter to me I know it's the truth anyhow that's why you fight rebellion and that's why God hates our Rebellion and stubbornness is as oh Lord as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King something just as simple it's not killing everybody and leaving the Sheep that's simple he rejected the word of the Lord yeah he rejected the word of the Lord may God help us powerheads oh Lord God I mean if you'd like to be remembered tonight before the Lord o children remember me remember me that God will help me that I'll always be little in my own eyes help me that I'll always be submissive to him and desire to obey his word desire to be little Hallelujah where he can always use us and when he wants to be that way before God never thinking big of yourself and how important you are and there's only one big one Among Us that's the Lord Jesus Heavenly Father Lord God I pray and have mercy on us Jesus help us Lord that we don't never get that kind of attitude father that we think we are something and we're so important Lord God may we always belittle in our own eyes oh most of us no no we think would never be like Balaam and most of us wouldn't I wonder how many of us would be closer to being like Saul it would get lifted up because of this or that or the other how many singers around the message have we seen do it how many preachers get lifted up and they start out sincere and love the people who love God and it's sad I can't say I understand it but when many men get older when they get up in years that's when they get so goofed up it's just like they go nuts please Jesus Keep Us Lord keep us father may we never handle the Bible and handle your prophet's message the way Saul did Lord if we are wrong show us may we always have a teachable spirit or we can see when the word is preached that we can see where we're wrong and repent God help us that we won't be like Saul that we'll stand right there and say I have done no wrong it's not me that's wrong it's everybody else help us Jesus help us Lord God I pray oh Father we worship you tonight Lord come by this way tonight Lord Jesus would you I know this is not the type of service makes us want to jump and shout and rejoice in that way but Lord if he can do a work in our hearts we'll have something to jump and Shout about then we can jump higher because we're living High father we don't want to just jump and not live what we're jumping about but we want to be a people that are submissive humble Lord that we don't filter Through the Bible and filter us through the message well I don't like this part and I don't believe that's necessary and I don't think we need to teach that I don't think who are we anyway just think that we poor blind people would be able to teach God anything speak your word to us Lord David made many mistakes along the way but there's one great difference between David and Saul David knew how to repent he knew how to admit he was wrong he knew how to come to the spot or it took him a while the sin of Bathsheba boy once it struck his heart he's constant repentance Psalm after Psalm later and years on down the road is still recognizing what a wrong that he done Lord may we be like that may we be able to be shown the word and say I'm sorry brother you're right I did this wrong and I'm going to go back and I'll go right back to square one I'll do it right or I won't do it but somehow we get it in our mind that when we start something wrong even will work for you well it wasn't right exactly no this one right now but that's okay that's okay God understands we don't realize we're building this on a false Foundation Lord we don't want to build our new births on a foundation of just emotion we don't want to build it on a foundation well I I went down to the Altar and I I couldn't speak English very good anymore I believe I've got it we don't want that or do we want it to be a change in our soul if you want us to speak in tongues so be it Lord if we do you want us to prophesy so be it but we want to be changed Lord we don't want to just have Victory when we go to youth camps we don't want to have victory in special meetings we want to have Victory right in the middle of hell and experience a youth camp or an experience of a dedication service if it don't keep us through the middle of hell it wasn't a very good one if we can only shout in special meetings and can't shout whenever we're having a regular Church there's something wrong with what we got in special meetings Lord God we want to be able to praise your name when we don't feel nothing we want to be able to come to church and we don't feel one thing we want to be able to worship and sing and pray and read our Bibles and listen to tapes when it fills out you're a Million Miles Away that's when we express the victory that's in our souls Lord we love you father come by this way tonight would you Lord come by here
