[36:48] and he believes he's worthy of all of
[36:50] our praise
[36:53] amen there's something about most of us
[36:58] we like to be appreciated
[37:02] loved told that we're
[37:04] needed if it's your natural family or
[37:08] your church
[37:09] family the place where you work we all
[37:13] like to feel that something that were a
[37:16] part of it
[37:18] right can you imagine you being the
[37:21] source of everything that is Holy
[37:24] everything that is righteous everything
[37:26] that is pure and true and
[37:29] genuine and yet many of the people who
[37:32] live on this Earth who breathe your
[37:36] air drink your water cut down your
[37:43] trees eat your food dig holes in your
[37:49] Earth and take out the granite and so on
[37:51] to make their cabinets every day they
[37:54] cannot live without what you have made
[37:58] and yet the majority of them don't even
[38:01] thank
[38:03] him right he's got way more love and
[38:06] patience than we do that's right because
[38:09] if people used us like that for about uh
[38:12] most of us what three
[38:15] days 6 weeks all right I'm really
[38:17] stretching it out now I'm going to go
[38:18] two months wow we think we are really so
[38:21] patient yet he has put up with the human
[38:24] race for all these thousands of years
[38:28] and they do that that I described and
[38:30] even more every day many of them deny
[38:34] that he even
[38:37] exists and yet if he stopped their
[38:41] breath they would drop in their
[38:44] tracks if you cut off the sunshine and
[38:47] never let it shine
[38:49] again I'm so grateful we have a heart to
[38:53] serve him you ever get kind of feeling
[38:56] low and w I don't know if God's blessed
[38:58] me or not I don't know you know this and
[39:00] that go to looking at how blessed you
[39:03] are I Ain talk about your house car all
[39:06] that I'm talking about you have a desire
[39:09] to live for him a desire to go to the
[39:12] house of God to desire when you get to
[39:14] the house of God to worship to pray to

[41:10] morning and as you all know I'm not
[41:13] getting any younger not yet anyway I'm
[41:16] on my way to it but I just haven't yet
[41:18] arrived so I certainly appreciate your
[41:21] prayers Revelation 10 verse
[41:24] 1 and I saw another
[41:28] Mighty
[41:30] Angel come down from heaven now remember
[41:33] this is not just an if I can say it this
[41:36] way an ordinary Angel if you can call
[41:39] any of them ordinary but this one has a
[41:42] special designation that it's a mighty
[41:45] Angel clothed with a
[41:48] cloud he's dressed in a certain dress
[41:53] it's for the occasion remember clothes
[41:56] have a significance of a season and a
[41:59] time so this Angel is dressed for the
[42:02] occasion clothed with a cloud and a
[42:05] rainbow was upon his head and his Fe his
[42:08] face as it were the Sun and his feet as
[42:12] pillars of fire had in his hand a little
[42:16] book open set his right foot upon the
[42:19] sea his left foot on the earth cried
[42:23] with a loud voice as when a lion Roth
[42:27] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[42:30] uttered their voices when the seven
[42:33] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[42:35] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[42:39] Heaven I notice there's a different
[42:41] sphere that this voice is coming from
[42:44] then where the seven Thunders come from
[42:47] when the seven Thunders had uttered
[42:49] their voices I was about to write and I
[42:52] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[42:56] see f up those things which the seven
[42:59] Thunders uttered and write them not and
[43:03] the angel which I saw stand upon the sea
[43:06] and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[43:08] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[43:12] forever and ever who created heaven and
[43:15] the things that therein are in the earth
[43:17] and the things that therein are in the
[43:19] sea and the things which are therein
[43:22] that there should be time no longer but
[43:25] in the days of the Void voice of the
[43:27] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[43:31] sound listen how important this is now
[43:33] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[43:38] of God should be finished as he has
[43:42] declared to his servants the prophets
[43:48] prophets wow well don't the Bible say
[43:51] though in the New Testament that the law
[43:54] and the prophets were unto
[43:59] John I always smile when people quote
[44:02] that and trying to say there are no
[44:06] prophets they don't even realize what
[44:09] they're quoting because the significance
[44:12] of that scripture is the law the Torah
[44:15] the first five books and the prophets
[44:18] let him realize the Old Testament is
[44:21] referred to as the law and the prophets
[44:27] the Bible is not saying there are no
[44:30] more prophets it's saying that the Torah
[44:34] and the prophets were until the coming
[44:36] of John then from that time on every man
[44:39] presses his way into the kingdom of God
[44:43] but God had prophets in the New
[44:45] Testament
[44:47] amen so apparently we still need them
[44:51] that's right that's right and when he
[44:54] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[44:56] should be finished as he hath declared
[45:00] to his servants the prophets how many
[45:03] like to be remember tonight as we pray
[45:06] sister Manley as many all know I'm sure
[45:09] already had had surgery and they were
[45:13] going to let her come home but they
[45:15] noticed there was just a few things that
[45:17] wasn't quite quite normal so they had to
[45:20] go back in again and uh had to have
[45:23] another procedure and I talked to
[45:26] brother man today or yesterday I talked
[45:29] to him on the phone and then text today
[45:31] and um they're just trying to keep her
[45:35] steady and she's better than she was
[45:37] still needing prayer but he ask if I
[45:39] would just mention her tonight before
[45:41] the Saints and we could just continue to
[45:43] pray for that the Lord will help her and
[45:45] help him as well how many has a request

[47:41] most needy person in the building is
[47:44] once again it's Fallen my lot to try to
[47:47] look into your word to try to Endeavor
[47:50] to bring something out of the word of
[47:52] God that would help your people that
[47:55] would encourage them that would correct
[47:57] them if they need to be corrected
[47:59] tonight father that would add a little

[48:05] that can be able to do that to all these
[48:07] people that are here how one in the
[48:08] world could I ever do it I couldn't so I
[48:11] pray that you would help me make me
[48:13] sensitive Lord Jesus to be able to
[48:15] follow the leading of your spirit we
[48:17] commit the reading of the word and the
[48:18] hearing likewise into your great
[48:21] presence in Jesus name we ask amen
[48:25] praise the Lord and the Saints said
[48:27] amen God bless you I do expect more of
[48:30] those as we move
[48:31] along amen thank you so that I trust
[48:35] won't be the last one that you'll say
[48:37] until we get ready to dismiss
[48:40] tonight what a a blessed people that we
[48:45] are to live in this day when the
[48:50] prophets the
[48:52] sages the
[48:53] seers of the Times Gone by
[48:57] believe that such a time would exist on
[49:02] the earth that man would be allowed to
[49:07] look into the program of God and
[49:11] understand more about what God's plan
[49:14] was they knew that when they were
[49:17] prophesying that they were doing it in
[49:21] part part of it would be in symbols part
[49:24] of it would be in types and and shadows
[49:28] part of it they would catch a word or
[49:31] more than one word from God and even the
[49:35] words that they would get would not
[49:38] always be a clear paragraph or maybe
[49:42] even a full sentence from God maybe just
[49:46] a few words and they knew god well
[49:49] enough to know that God didn't speak
[49:52] like that that God spoke with clarity
[49:56] and God could speak with things in such
[50:00] great terms and make his way known it
[50:03] must have been
[50:04] quite difficult for the prophets as God
[50:08] sometimes would give them a word and it
[50:10] would seem totally out of season it
[50:14] would seem as if though it wasn't even
[50:18] fitting for the time I asked brother
[50:21] Charlie Cox one time I said brother
[50:24] Charlie whenever brother Brandon was
[50:26] here and you all were there at the
[50:29] Tabernacle and going driving and hearing
[50:32] and preach and going different places
[50:35] that you was able to drive what did you
[50:38] think about the conditions that brother
[50:42] brandham was describing how how how did
[50:45] you relate to it because no doubt some
[50:48] of them were further advanced than the
[50:51] time you all were living he said well
[50:54] they were and and we realized that but
[50:57] we believe that maybe some of them
[51:00] existed in other areas that we were just
[51:03] unaware of or some of them or maybe in
[51:07] the future to be but he said you knew
[51:10] that there was things that was being
[51:12] said that the times had not yet caught
[51:16] up with the prophecy so but as we live
[51:20] in the time that we're at we believe
[51:23] that certainly the times are catching up
[51:27] with the prophetic word do we not and no
[51:30] doubt there are more words that are to
[51:33] be fulfill but as one believer I believe
[51:37] with all of my heart that things could
[51:40] happen at such a rapid rate we see
[51:45] already how the things can unfold in
[51:48] such a way and it could just be one
[51:51] after another after another and happen
[51:53] at such a fast pace that we could be
[51:57] looking right at prophecies that have
[52:00] been said hundreds of years ago and the
[52:03] Very fulfillment be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 just
[52:07] like that and the time is upon us you
[52:10] know it pays us every day as the people
[52:13] of God to be ready if I was you and I
[52:17] was here tonight I wouldn't be waiting
[52:19] till Sunday morning to try to make
[52:22] something right with God or right with a
[52:24] brother or sister I would be afraid to
[52:27] walk out that door tonight if there's
[52:29] anything in your life that you feel like
[52:32] would hinder you from making the Rapture
[52:35] can anybody say Amen am now because God
[52:39] will bring his word to pass that way
[52:42] especially to the illuminated and We
[52:46] Know by the grace of God we are
[52:48] privileged to be able to walk in the
[52:50] greater light and the greater
[52:53] understanding that has been given in the
[52:56] life day now we don't say that to try to
[52:58] puff oursel up and not CL that we're
[53:00] better than somebody else because we're
[53:02] not we it not for the grace of God we
[53:05] would be just as blind as ever live to
[53:07] seeing out there but God for his own
[53:10] purpose has measured out to us a measure
[53:13] of Grace and I know I look at it maybe
[53:16] different than some I do not look at
[53:18] Grace as just something that allows you
[53:20] to do wrong and get by with it and you
[53:23] go unpunished I don't look at Grace that
[53:25] way I look at Grace is the allotment
[53:27] that God gives me the portion that he
[53:31] gives me is not the ability to sin and
[53:34] get by with it but he gives me the
[53:36] ability to want and to desire to walk in
[53:40] such a way not see how much I can do but
[53:43] see how much I can stay away from I'm
[53:46] not looking for what I can do to get by
[53:48] get by with it I want to do what he
[53:51] wants me to do I want to live my life
[53:54] every day as if so it were my last cuz
[53:58] who knows it may be now looking at what
[54:01] God has done down Through the Ages and
[54:03] we're able by the grace of God to look
[54:06] backwards in retrospect and see the
[54:08] types and the Shadows through a
[54:10] prophetic understanding things that God
[54:13] has been planning and has worked out and
[54:17] the Mysterious powers of God as the
[54:20] prophet called it are still working on
[54:23] every one of those names that are found
[54:25] written in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[54:29] sometimes the wheels of Prophecy might
[54:32] turn quite slow and saying in Times Gone
[54:35] by that people might live their entire
[54:38] life maybe your grandfathers your
[54:40] great-grandfathers your great
[54:42] grandmothers and they serve the Lord and
[54:44] they love the Lord and they might live
[54:47] 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 years I never see
[54:53] three or four prophetic words from God
[54:57] in the Bible come to pass in their
[54:59] lifetime and they might just go on and
[55:02] be a good Christian a good child of God
[55:04] and they live in the changing of the
[55:06] dispensation say from from wesy and
[55:09] Pentecost and they would see the
[55:11] restoration of gifts and they would see
[55:13] that little portion of word come to pass
[55:16] and they thought it was the greatest
[55:18] thing that ever was and it was a great
[55:21] time cuz when any mortal can see just
[55:24] one of God's prophetic utterances come
[55:27] to pass with our eyes with our soul and
[55:31] understand it you are a blessed human
[55:33] being but then can you imagine that
[55:36] there are other people who were allowed
[55:39] to live in a time when one prophetic
[55:42] word after another after another after
[55:45] another and it begins to unfold so fast
[55:49] that it almost takes your breaths
[55:52] believe it or not I just spoke about you
[55:54] you see because nearly every day that we
[55:58] live more things are unfolding I'm sure
[56:02] you heard about it just today that three
[56:04] of the nations of the world have decided
[56:07] that they feel like that there needs to
[56:10] be a Palestinian State already South
[56:14] Africa has wanted to bring and I'm sure
[56:17] you've heard about the arrest that the
[56:19] international Court supposedly of
[56:22] Justice wants to get a warrant for
[56:24] Netanyahu and and some of the other
[56:27] Israeli leaders and you realize what
[56:29] it's all leading up to that is going to
[56:33] come to where the nations of the world
[56:36] will press against Israel and we know
[56:40] that it could happen just like that
[56:43] because the anointing is already here
[56:47] the anointing what we saw the protest
[56:50] and the campuses what we saw from the
[56:52] president on down no we're not doing
[56:55] this no we're not doing that and you
[56:57] know what they're doing they're ushering
[57:00] in and working under the authority of
[57:04] the mark of the beast think of it if you
[57:07] don't do what we say you cannot buy or
[57:12] sell so if you don't do what we tell you
[57:16] to do we will stop sending you bombs we
[57:20] will stop sending you grenades we will
[57:23] stop sending you this and that and the
[57:25] other you do what we say do when we say
[57:29] do it and how we tell you to do it or we
[57:33] will penalize you now listen and
[57:35] understand the mark of the beast is not
[57:38] going to be everybody with a tattoo it's
[57:41] not going to be a computer all years and
[57:44] years ago when they start putting the
[57:46] barcodes on everything now of course our
[57:49] groceries and every s we buy people were
[57:52] scared to death that it was a mark of
[57:54] the beast and y'all remember that
[57:56] whenever they started doing the computer
[57:58] people were terrified that the computer
[58:01] was going to be the mark of the beast
[58:03] now all of that is going to add up and
[58:07] make it easier whenever it begins to
[58:09] finally move in but remember the mark of
[58:12] the beast is not a tattoo and being in
[58:16] your right hand is not that you'll have
[58:18] a computer chip slid under your skin and
[58:21] you'll scan yourself over the computer
[58:24] it's you giving giving your right hand a
[58:27] fellowship to join up to something that
[58:30] is anti-
[58:32] word don't you wor about no computer
[58:35] chip slid under your skin and you
[58:38] scanning yourself they already doing it
[58:40] and part of the European nations anyway
[58:43] it's not of you getting some type of
[58:45] scan across your forehead it's you
[58:48] receiving the doctrine of The ecumenical
[58:51] move and bowing down to the
[58:54] denominations well come on somebody
[58:57] that's right don't worry about no tattoo
[59:00] don't worry about no scanning or nothing
[59:02] like that many of them have already in
[59:06] essence joined up with the Beast system
[59:10] now for those of you that's kept up with
[59:12] it you know that the United methodists
[59:14] just in the last couple of weeks as a
[59:17] whole have now agreed together to put
[59:20] gay people inside the ministry they
[59:23] already had a split a few years ago but
[59:25] the main body you know they stayed
[59:28] together but now what they're doing then
[59:30] the way the organizational system is set
[59:32] up if we were an organization then the
[59:35] organization would have built this
[59:37] building then if we did not do what the
[59:40] organization said they would kick us out
[59:44] of this building because the
[59:46] organization owns it now look what the
[59:48] organization does so I watched a little
[59:51] thing about it the other day a lot of
[59:53] these Methodist congregations that are
[59:56] are not going along with this homosexual
[59:58] agenda well come on somebody don't you
[1:00:02] understand the sodomites knocked on
[1:00:05] lot's door and lot opened the door to
[1:00:09] them and gave them ear and gave them
[1:00:13] place so the sodomites are knocking not
[1:00:17] on Abraham's door but on lot door
[1:00:21] organized
[1:00:23] religion so you understand then what's
[1:00:25] happening to some of these Methodist
[1:00:27] congregations if they don't accept this
[1:00:30] then the Bishops and all of these
[1:00:32] overlords over them are telling them
[1:00:35] then you all get out because this
[1:00:38] building belongs to the United Methodist
[1:00:42] Church well I'm glad I can say here
[1:00:44] tonight this building right here don't
[1:00:46] belong to the UPC or the upz or the upb
[1:00:51] or nobody else it belongs to you folks
[1:00:55] it belong to no organization it don't
[1:00:58] belong to a bunch of Bishops somewhere
[1:01:01] that can say if you all Don't Preach
[1:01:03] what we say then we're booting you out
[1:01:06] they're not booting that out we're the
[1:01:07] ones that make the payments on it well
[1:01:10] come on but you see what they're doing
[1:01:12] so they Asser their Authority one
[1:01:16] working under this pre-tribulation beast
[1:01:20] power so if they don't accept the gay
[1:01:23] clergy then what will they do they will
[1:01:26] put them out and they can no longer buy
[1:01:30] and sell under the Methodist mark of the
[1:01:34] beast so you either do what we say or
[1:01:38] you will no longer be able to belong to
[1:01:42] us as far as an organizational system
[1:01:45] now they may be crying about it right
[1:01:47] now but a lot of them will be happy once
[1:01:49] they get throw out because they realized
[1:01:52] God had mercy on them and they were
[1:01:54] thrown out of her before it went into
[1:01:57] him there'll be some of them that'll be
[1:01:59] saved no doubt and come up through the
[1:02:01] tribulation period so already the beast
[1:02:05] power is moving in the preliminary move
[1:02:09] upon the Earth right now now remember
[1:02:11] Satan is moving in the background with
[1:02:13] his mechanics and God is also which
[1:02:17] works in a two-fold way in mechanics and
[1:02:20] Dynamics and the prophet tells us that
[1:02:22] there will be a refilling of the Holy
[1:02:26] ghost which is the Dynamics of this
[1:02:28] church which the church has been working
[1:02:31] in part while The Headstone has been
[1:02:34] descending so The Headstone has been
[1:02:37] descending down to the church ages and
[1:02:40] there will be a refilling of the Holy
[1:02:44] Ghost which we've worked in part I say
[1:02:47] bring it on
[1:02:49] Lord now what are we doing well we're
[1:02:51] coming to church and we're preaching and
[1:02:53] we're singing and we're living right and
[1:02:55] we're trying to witness and we're trying
[1:02:57] to spread the light trying to do
[1:02:59] everything we can and is a lot of it
[1:03:01] mechanics yes and people say oh that's
[1:03:04] just a routine you call it routine if
[1:03:06] you want to I call it mechanics because
[1:03:09] I know if our mechanics are not in order
[1:03:13] when the fire falls what's it going to
[1:03:15] fall on now when Elijah got ready to
[1:03:18] reconstruct the altar of God by the
[1:03:21] vision that God had showed him he had to
[1:03:23] have the stones ready he had to turn
[1:03:25] down there heathenism and he had to
[1:03:27] build an altar for God had to dig a
[1:03:30] ditch had to put the rocks in order had
[1:03:32] to delay the wood in order what was that
[1:03:35] mechanics waiting for God's Dynamics to
[1:03:38] strike to mechanics but you see the fire
[1:03:41] of God would have never struck there had
[1:03:44] he not want to all that labor and all of
[1:03:47] that effort to get it in order so don't
[1:03:49] think when you come to church and every
[1:03:52] night we don't run around the the
[1:03:54] benches and we all Shout you know and oh
[1:03:57] we boy we didn't have much of a meeting
[1:03:59] tonight boy we just sung and we clapped
[1:04:01] our hands and we just prayed and we had
[1:04:04] prayer requests well maybe tonight's
[1:04:06] going to be a mechanics night and then
[1:04:08] on Sunday it'll be mechanics and
[1:04:10] Dynamics but he's the one that knows how
[1:04:13] to build the building you and I don't
[1:04:16] and we don't want we don't want us to
[1:04:18] feel like that we know how it goes
[1:04:20] together but we want to be led by the
[1:04:22] spirit of God so I want my mechanics in
[1:04:25] order do you understand why that I study
[1:04:28] so much so when I get up and the
[1:04:30] anointing falls on me the spirit of God
[1:04:34] has something to be able to pull back up
[1:04:36] so I study I'll sit back there I study
[1:04:39] and study and study is it requir did god
[1:04:42] require me to study as much as I do
[1:04:44] probably not but I want him to have so
[1:04:47] much when the anointing falls on me that
[1:04:50] that word will spew out of me I'm
[1:04:52] telling you what so I don't have a bunch
[1:04:54] of filler well amen and Hallelujah and
[1:04:57] amen and Hallelujah you know what I'm
[1:04:58] saying some preachers every third word
[1:05:00] is amen I'd rather have a little more
[1:05:03] for God to be able to work on instead of
[1:05:05] standing up praying and and just amen
[1:05:07] amen amen amen and glory to God and
[1:05:10] glory to God y'all ought to be gloring
[1:05:11] to God and I ought to be saying
[1:05:13] something for you to glory to God bow so
[1:05:15] I want plenty of mechanics there for the
[1:05:18] spirit of God to anoint how many
[1:05:20] understand what I'm saying you
[1:05:21] understand why it's so important for you
[1:05:22] to come in here and sit down and read
[1:05:24] your Bible and just clear your mind a
[1:05:26] little bit and get ready for the service
[1:05:29] to start for the song leader and all
[1:05:30] that you can stand out there and talk
[1:05:32] about politics and business and money
[1:05:34] and this and that and the other but I
[1:05:36] dare say it would be would be more
[1:05:38] beneficial for most of us if we'd come
[1:05:41] in and set down for a few minutes and
[1:05:43] clear our mind and just meditate upon
[1:05:45] the Lord and meditate upon his goodness
[1:05:48] lord well what do you got for us now
[1:05:50] come on Church somebody say Amen so what
[1:05:52] are you doing you're bringing your
[1:05:54] mechanics in too so I'm bringing mine in
[1:05:58] you're bringing yours in and what do we
[1:06:00] do we pile all the mechanics together
[1:06:02] and then the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:06:04] begins to anoint all them mechanics oh
[1:06:07] my you talking about a meeting there
[1:06:08] ain't no telling what God would do so
[1:06:10] Satan saw what God is doing and remember
[1:06:14] he knows he has but a short time so he
[1:06:17] must have a lot of his mechanics
[1:06:20] together so he's dealing with the
[1:06:21] nations of the world he's dealing with
[1:06:23] this anti-Semitism that's around the
[1:06:26] world he's dealing with the campuses and
[1:06:28] all that sort of thing all these friends
[1:06:30] it's not just well who's in charge of
[1:06:32] all that and they're trying to figure
[1:06:33] out well who is doing all this who's in
[1:06:35] charge well I can tell them I mean they
[1:06:37] won't believe me but I can tell them
[1:06:39] it's the devil in charge of it all he's
[1:06:42] getting all the world ready he he can't
[1:06:45] wait until the bride is gone can you
[1:06:47] imagine the very day the bride leaves
[1:06:50] and he recognizes that the sanctuaries
[1:06:52] become Smoky and the bride goes up he'll
[1:06:55] take over that day if the Rapture comes
[1:06:58] in the morning at 9:00 by noon the devil
[1:07:02] will have already taken over the world
[1:07:04] the mechanics have already set in there
[1:07:07] the United Nations there's men in every
[1:07:09] spot no doubt Moses and Elijah are
[1:07:12] already on the earth tonight already
[1:07:14] here well praise the Lord and the bride
[1:07:17] just getting ready and the 144,000
[1:07:20] cannot come in until the bride is gone
[1:07:23] and there might not be but one more
[1:07:25] person there might be a half a dozen we
[1:07:27] don't know but we want to be ready every
[1:07:30] hour of our life because we have not a
[1:07:34] clue exactly the time when the Lord may
[1:07:37] pull our card from the rack as it were
[1:07:39] if you're sitting here tonight without
[1:07:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me
[1:07:43] speak this to you as your pastor and
[1:07:45] your brother I want to see you filled
[1:07:47] with the spirit of God I want to see
[1:07:50] every member of our church every fiber
[1:07:53] of our being so full of the holy ghost
[1:07:56] that we can love those that hate us and
[1:07:59] we can forgive our enemies and we can
[1:08:01] pray for those that despitefully use us
[1:08:04] and watch the Living God come Among Us
[1:08:07] and fulfill his
[1:08:09] word oh
[1:08:13] Hallelujah you see the Lord God desired
[1:08:16] to bring his inheritance back to his
[1:08:19] people and as we've been looking at Ruth
[1:08:22] being a type of this again we'll pick up
[1:08:25] there Ruth 4:9 and Boaz said unto the
[1:08:27] elders and to all the people you are
[1:08:29] witnesses this day that I bought all
[1:08:32] that was alic and all that was Chileans
[1:08:35] and maon of the hand of Naomi moreover
[1:08:37] Ruth the moabitas the wife of meon have
[1:08:40] I purchased to be my wife to raise up
[1:08:44] the name of the Dead upon his
[1:08:47] inheritance that the name of the Dead be
[1:08:50] not cut off from among his Brethren and
[1:08:53] from the Gate of his place ye are
[1:08:55] witnesses this day but our Boaz did not
[1:09:00] go to the gate of Jerusalem in order to
[1:09:04] open the book but our Boaz went through
[1:09:08] the Gates of Jerusalem outside the city
[1:09:11] as Paul said that he had to suffer
[1:09:13] without the gate so he must go outside
[1:09:17] the gate in order to pay the ransom
[1:09:19] price but remember the book was not on
[1:09:23] the cross the book was not up on golasa
[1:09:27] he could not have even taken the book
[1:09:30] had the book been there but the book was
[1:09:32] still in the hands of almighty God so
[1:09:35] our Boaz you see it's all about location
[1:09:39] location location that's not just a good
[1:09:42] real estate idea it's God's idea
[1:09:45] location location location being at the
[1:09:49] right place at the right time with the
[1:09:52] right people under the right influence
[1:09:54] location
[1:09:56] location location come on somebody let's
[1:09:58] have church
[1:10:00] tonight now we read Revelation 10 but
[1:10:03] let us go backwards and read Revelation
[1:10:05] 5:7 and he came and took the book out of
[1:10:08] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:10:11] throne and what he had taken the book
[1:10:13] The Four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders fell
[1:10:15] down before the lamb having every one of
[1:10:18] them Harps and golden vials full of
[1:10:23] odors so they got Harps and then they've
[1:10:27] got these golden vows full of odors now
[1:10:31] what was the odors it was incense that
[1:10:34] was being burned but I want you to
[1:10:35] notice now what the incense actually was
[1:10:39] golden vows full of oders which are the
[1:10:43] prayers of the Saints so in heaven the
[1:10:46] angels in their vows or in their incense
[1:10:50] burner they did not have Sandalwood they
[1:10:53] did not have teak wood they did not have
[1:10:56] some type of aromatics of some type of
[1:10:58] bark off of a tree or some type of oil
[1:11:01] but what they actually had inside of
[1:11:04] these vials was Saints
[1:11:08] prayers so you imagine children of God
[1:11:11] down on the earth were praying and when
[1:11:14] the lamb takes the book and the angels
[1:11:18] of God have Harps which is music of
[1:11:21] course and then they're pouring out this
[1:11:23] incense and recognition of what the lamb
[1:11:26] has done but it's not smoked that's
[1:11:29] coming up but they're pouring out the
[1:11:32] prayers of the children of God you mean
[1:11:34] God stores up our prayers you understand
[1:11:37] what a a sacred holy thing that the
[1:11:40] prayers of the righteous people of God
[1:11:43] are that they are actually stored in
[1:11:46] great containers as it was in the
[1:11:48] heavens and those containers are given
[1:11:51] to the charge of the angels and whenever
[1:11:54] the people people of God are praying you
[1:11:57] may feel like when you're praying your
[1:11:59] prayers are going no higher than your
[1:12:00] head you may not feel one thing not one
[1:12:04] little bit of the anointing not one
[1:12:06] little bit of the presence of God but
[1:12:08] when you're praying as a saint of God
[1:12:10] under the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:13] them prayers are being stored up and
[1:12:16] when the lamb took the book in the
[1:12:18] symbol then was released in recognition
[1:12:22] of him taking that book was what the
[1:12:25] prayers of the Saints so the prayers of
[1:12:27] the Saints must have been associated
[1:12:31] with Redemption so the saints were
[1:12:34] praying Oh Come Lord Jesus oh Lord Jesus
[1:12:37] save my family Lord Jesus save my
[1:12:40] husband Lord Jesus grab a hold of my
[1:12:43] backslid brother Lord God please do this
[1:12:46] and whenever the lamb takes the book one
[1:12:49] of the most Sublime things in all of the
[1:12:52] entire Cannon of scripture And yet when
[1:12:56] that takes place there in the vision in
[1:12:58] heaven of all the things to be released
[1:13:02] it was not Angelic voices it was not
[1:13:05] cherubim that were praising it was not
[1:13:08] some Heavenly Choir that was singing at
[1:13:11] the time but what was released the
[1:13:14] prayers of the saints of God it ain't no
[1:13:17] wonder the devil don't want us to pray
[1:13:20] he don't want us to know the power that
[1:13:23] is in our prayer he does does not want
[1:13:25] us to see the precious value that is in
[1:13:29] our prayer somebody hearing me tonight I
[1:13:32] ain't just talking about you always been
[1:13:34] down on your knees once you learn that
[1:13:36] you can pray no matter where you are
[1:13:39] what time of the day it is you're
[1:13:41] pushing a buggy down through Walmart you
[1:13:43] can go with a prayer on your lips come
[1:13:45] on somebody as I gave you that example
[1:13:48] the other day of Sams you know what I
[1:13:51] wasn't a bit embarrassed to lay my hands
[1:13:53] on that little old lady because I saw
[1:13:55] there was a need there and apparently
[1:13:58] she sensed the presence of God so you
[1:14:01] know what I believe you and I as a
[1:14:03] people of God we ought to pray more we
[1:14:06] ought to be spend more time in the
[1:14:08] presence of our Lord Jesus of the Don
[1:14:11] I'm so limited in my time I know you are
[1:14:14] but you drive to work don't you you
[1:14:16] drive to the drive-thru don't you you
[1:14:18] drive back home from work don't you
[1:14:20] you've got enough time turn off your
[1:14:23] talk radio turn off off YouTube turn off
[1:14:26] Instagram turn off Tik Tok and begin to
[1:14:30] send some prayers Up Before the Throne
[1:14:32] of God oh God save my family oh God send
[1:14:37] Revival in my home oh God send Revival
[1:14:41] in our church bring your people together
[1:14:44] Lord give the angel something to store
[1:14:48] up
[1:14:49] [Applause]
[1:14:59] so if the Angels do have a vessel with
[1:15:01] your name wrad on
[1:15:03] it how big is
[1:15:08] it size of a
[1:15:12] thimble s there's this peach
[1:15:18] mango praise the
[1:15:21] lord it's one of the easiest things that
[1:15:23] we can do talk to our lord
[1:15:27] Jesus not for the sake of storage now
[1:15:32] but once you learn how to do it you
[1:15:34] realize how the devil's been robbing you
[1:15:37] I people I've had it for years and years
[1:15:39] and people say I don't know how to pray
[1:15:40] I don't how I don't how to I don't know
[1:15:41] how to talk to God and yet they've sat
[1:15:43] and just talked to me for 30 or 45
[1:15:45] minutes about this or that the other I
[1:15:47] always turn it right around on I'm and
[1:15:49] tell them that you know what just the
[1:15:50] way you talk to me just now talk to God
[1:15:53] the exact same way I don't go to God and
[1:15:56] hold my hands in a certain way you know
[1:15:58] and get my mouth in a certain way and
[1:16:00] these and thou and all that sort of
[1:16:02] thing that ain't the way I talk okay I
[1:16:04] don't these and th I'm not a King James
[1:16:06] version I'm a I'm a Tennessee version so
[1:16:09] I just go to the Lord you know just the
[1:16:11] way I talk to you I Lord I Lord I don't
[1:16:13] understand Lord I need help Lord God
[1:16:15] would you please help me with this amen
[1:16:18] I I don't get in this super religious
[1:16:20] voice you you hear people get up before
[1:16:22] the church sometimes and pray and you
[1:16:24] hear them get in that church voice and
[1:16:26] you realize that ain't the way they talk
[1:16:28] to God noow and God's wondering who is
[1:16:30] that anyway do I know him because that's
[1:16:32] sure ain't the way he talks to me every
[1:16:33] other day I want to just talk to God the
[1:16:35] same way when I pray before you that I
[1:16:38] do in my closet driving down the road in
[1:16:40] my truck or down in my basement because
[1:16:42] he knows who we are anyhow don't he so
[1:16:45] why should I be all prim and proper
[1:16:47] before you all when I sure don't talk to
[1:16:49] him that way when I'm just me and him
[1:16:51] byel and you realize in that prayer is
[1:16:53] that open ch of communication that God
[1:16:56] gives us as his children and it is so
[1:16:59] precious and so sacred that he links it
[1:17:02] to the Redemption of the book he links
[1:17:05] the prayers of God's children so when
[1:17:08] the book is actually taken it's through
[1:17:10] the acknowledgment of the Saints prayers
[1:17:13] that he comes and says now release their
[1:17:16] prayers cuz here is the
[1:17:21] answer oh God save my boy oh God save my
[1:17:24] boy and the lamb is taking the book to
[1:17:27] be able to call your boy's name out of
[1:17:29] the book so your prayers are associated
[1:17:33] with the book and open you understand oh
[1:17:35] yes pray about your light bill pray
[1:17:37] about your phone bill all that but get
[1:17:39] that done and then spend time with
[1:17:41] Fellowship get your list all done get
[1:17:43] that all done and then just spend time
[1:17:45] oh Jesus I just love you oh Lord I just
[1:17:48] love you I want to tell you how much you
[1:17:49] mean to me Lord you've been so good to
[1:17:51] me it's hard to stay down friends if
[1:17:53] you'll ever start talking him that way
[1:17:55] you know why a lot of y'all are so down
[1:17:57] and so low all the time you don't spend
[1:17:59] enough time in praising the Lord in
[1:18:01] Fellowship yall to spend more time just
[1:18:04] loving him and praising him instead of
[1:18:06] watering in your mistakes and watering
[1:18:08] in your shortcoming well I come short
[1:18:10] well so do I but I'm going to make them
[1:18:13] them things right with God and then I'm
[1:18:15] going to praise him I'm going to love
[1:18:17] him I'm going to adore him that's one
[1:18:18] reason I'm saved that's one reason I'm
[1:18:22] called oh my now notice whenever he does
[1:18:26] this then the Angels come with the harps
[1:18:29] every one of them has Harps and golden
[1:18:31] vows full of odors which are the prayers
[1:18:33] of the Saints and they sung a new song
[1:18:35] saying thou W worthy to take the book
[1:18:37] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:18:40] was slain and has has redeemed us to God
[1:18:43] by thy blood out of every Kindred and
[1:18:46] tongue and people and nation and has
[1:18:49] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[1:18:52] and we shall reign upon the Earth like
[1:18:55] Boaz our Boaz the Lord Jesus was not
[1:18:59] concerned about jeopardizing his
[1:19:02] reputation by being identified with us
[1:19:06] all of us know it's risky being
[1:19:09] identified with certain people I went
[1:19:11] and preached for preachers before that I
[1:19:14] knew they leaned in a certain direction
[1:19:17] about something even though I did not
[1:19:19] agree with what they believed I knew I
[1:19:23] would risk an element of my reputation
[1:19:26] by preaching for him because people say
[1:19:29] uhoh what's brother Donnie doing and
[1:19:32] then I've had preachers to come and
[1:19:34] preach for us and I knew that I differed
[1:19:37] with them on this and that and the other
[1:19:39] I knew that would be a risk of even some
[1:19:41] of you saying what's brother Donnie
[1:19:44] doing wonder how come he got this
[1:19:47] preacher here well what do you want me
[1:19:49] to do wait till we find every preacher
[1:19:51] that totally agrees with us on every
[1:19:53] point of Doctrine
[1:19:57] and we fuss and preach against the
[1:19:59] denominations and we're just as about as
[1:20:02] bad brother Ram talked about the
[1:20:04] Pentecostals how the one of them said
[1:20:06] he's coming on a cloud and the other
[1:20:08] said he's coming on a white horse and
[1:20:09] they said all right well make two groups
[1:20:11] that's about what we've done we've made
[1:20:13] two groups on the tent move we've made
[1:20:16] two groups on perusia we've made two
[1:20:18] groups on the gifts we made two groups
[1:20:20] on this we just keep on making them two
[1:20:22] groups about everything that comes well
[1:20:25] I don't believe it that way and I don't
[1:20:26] believe well I won't fellowship with you
[1:20:28] no more that's fine you won't come and
[1:20:30] preach for me and I won't come and
[1:20:31] preach for you and we won't send our
[1:20:33] young people to your Youth Camp well
[1:20:35] that's just fine and dandy we're not
[1:20:37] coming to your Youth Camp and then we
[1:20:39] preach against the nomination bunch of
[1:20:48] Hypocrites well preach it brother Donnie
[1:20:51] I'm with you brother Donnie Amen brother
[1:20:54] Donnie
[1:20:56] Hallelujah but the Lord Jesus wanted to
[1:21:00] share his inheritance with us so like
[1:21:04] Boaz Jesus made his
[1:21:07] plans
[1:21:10] privately but carried them out
[1:21:15] publicly so Satan wasn't there when he
[1:21:19] laid out the
[1:21:21] plan so part of it even now
[1:21:25] he don't quite understand we do have the
[1:21:28] advantage on him since we are part of
[1:21:31] the
[1:21:33] family you see we're part of the
[1:21:37] initiated that's right we're part of the
[1:21:40] initiated so the Lord Jesus made his
[1:21:43] plans in private and then paid the price
[1:21:47] in a public form now watch here in in
[1:21:50] the Book of Ruth chapter 4 I find this
[1:21:53] so amazing in the Book of Ruth 4: 1
[1:21:57] through 45 there it's five times that
[1:22:02] you find people sitting
[1:22:05] down now watch the posture of their body
[1:22:09] so five times in those first few verses
[1:22:13] you find people sitting down now there's
[1:22:17] a time to set and there's a time to
[1:22:21] stand and there's a time to kneel
[1:22:24] there's a time to
[1:22:26] run
[1:22:27] fast there's a time when you're behind
[1:22:30] run real fast so you can catch up right
[1:22:34] so the position of what we see in the
[1:22:36] Book of Ruth is reflecting part of the
[1:22:40] work now watch whenever the Lord Jesus
[1:22:43] actually finishes his Earthly stage of
[1:22:47] the work of redemption that he also
[1:22:51] moves into the most noted position
[1:22:55] in the in the four gospels and also in
[1:22:58] the rest of the New Testament is that he
[1:23:01] moves into a setting position okay
[1:23:06] notice in Mark
[1:23:08] 1619 so then after the Lord has spoken
[1:23:11] unto them he was received up into heaven
[1:23:15] and what s on the right hand of God
[1:23:20] Ephesians 1:20 which he had wrote In
[1:23:23] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[1:23:25] and set him on his own right hand in the
[1:23:28] Heavenly places Hebrews 1:3 who being
[1:23:31] the brightness of his glory and the
[1:23:32] express image of his person upholding
[1:23:36] All Things by the word of his power not
[1:23:39] the power of His word but the word of
[1:23:41] his power when he had himself purged our
[1:23:44] sins sat
[1:23:46] down sat down now remember when Boaz
[1:23:50] entered into this purchase price and
[1:23:54] when every moved along at a certain
[1:23:56] State he was setting but he also had to
[1:23:59] change his posture in order to stand up
[1:24:02] and take his shoe off so the change of
[1:24:06] the posture of the Redeemer signifies
[1:24:10] something's fixing to happen with the
[1:24:13] redeemed cuz remember the whole thing is
[1:24:16] the Redeemer and the redeemed oh
[1:24:19] Hallelujah sat down on the right hand of
[1:24:22] the Majesty on high Hebrews 81 now the
[1:24:24] things which we have spoken this is the
[1:24:27] son we have such an high priest who is
[1:24:32] set on the right hand of the Throne of
[1:24:34] the Majesty in the heavens why what is
[1:24:37] this signifying because the
[1:24:40] transaction of the purchase price is
[1:24:45] finished so hanging on the cross is no
[1:24:49] longer
[1:24:52] necessary now the Lord Jesus could not
[1:24:55] have
[1:24:56] sat on the cross wrong
[1:25:00] posture he could not have kneeled on the
[1:25:04] cross wrong posture he knelt In The
[1:25:08] Garden of Gethsemane you understand what
[1:25:11] I'm saying so he kneels in the Garden of
[1:25:13] Gethsemane the kneeling in the Garden of
[1:25:16] Gethsemane empowers him with the ability
[1:25:20] to then hang on the cross which
[1:25:23] fulfilled the promised word brings him
[1:25:26] out of the Tomb and then he can
[1:25:28] resurrect in his glorified body and set
[1:25:31] in the right hand of the Majesty so the
[1:25:33] setting is the significance that the
[1:25:37] word Earthly work of redemption is
[1:25:41] completed as far as the price being paid
[1:25:44] now you'll notice then there a few times
[1:25:47] and one of them of course was Steven
[1:25:49] whenever Steven was actually being
[1:25:51] stoned and then Steven said behold you
[1:25:55] know he looked up around to Heaven he
[1:25:56] said I I see the Son of God I I see him
[1:25:59] standing now notice this martyr in the
[1:26:03] New Testament brings the Lord Jesus up
[1:26:07] out of the mediatorial position to
[1:26:11] receiving a Son of God home so watch
[1:26:16] when he stands it is a significance to
[1:26:20] those on the earth oh glory to God look
[1:26:23] for him whenever he comes for his bride
[1:26:27] he won't be in a chair so whenever he
[1:26:29] comes down and the angels of God
[1:26:33] actually see him rise from the
[1:26:36] significant Throne that he's on and his
[1:26:39] position being changed it's a sign
[1:26:42] you're fixing to be changed yourself
[1:26:45] because his posture now notice in Ruth
[1:26:49] 410 moreover Ruth of motis the wife of
[1:26:52] meon have I purchased to be my wife I
[1:26:55] found the meaning of this word
[1:26:56] absolutely awesome purchase to get
[1:26:59] acquire create create by possess
[1:27:04] creating redeeming his people now this
[1:27:06] is the word that Boaz used I am creating
[1:27:11] Roose a new she is a moabitas but I'm
[1:27:17] going to give her a new name I'm going
[1:27:22] to give her a new book now remember to
[1:27:27] the devil was trying to stand between
[1:27:31] Ruth and her body
[1:27:34] change you see what Ruth needed was a
[1:27:38] new book and God gave her one actually
[1:27:41] he let her name be called over one of
[1:27:43] the books of the Bible right she got her
[1:27:46] own
[1:27:48] book praise the Lord so God was going to
[1:27:53] act out in her and to was trying to
[1:27:56] stand between her body change so she
[1:27:58] needed a name change she needed a book
[1:28:01] change and she also needed a body change
[1:28:05] in order to be pulled into the cycle of
[1:28:08] the seed of the Messiah what was that
[1:28:11] body change there had to be a Kinsman
[1:28:14] that would take her sin her moabi his
[1:28:18] condition upon himself and seow his seed
[1:28:21] in her and give her a body change right
[1:28:26] what you talking about Brother D what in
[1:28:27] the world it matter you ain't never
[1:28:28] matter to me by by Boaz taking her to
[1:28:31] himself prating her he ushered her in to
[1:28:37] a body change and she became with child
[1:28:40] and brought forth a son that's now to
[1:28:43] was standing between that promised seed
[1:28:46] which she was to carry notice the devil
[1:28:48] on down through after the fall in the
[1:28:50] Garden of Eden he's always tried to get
[1:28:52] to that woman look what he tried to do
[1:28:54] to Sarah he tried to get Sarah and get
[1:28:57] that King down there to fall in love
[1:28:58] with Sarah what's he trying to do he's
[1:29:00] trying to get to the chosen bride before
[1:29:02] Abraham does because there's a
[1:29:04] particular time what he do the same
[1:29:06] thing with Isaac and Rebecca and he's
[1:29:09] going to come right and do the same
[1:29:10] thing he tried to do the same thing on
[1:29:11] the day of Pentecost come on somebody
[1:29:14] tried to do the same thing with Mary
[1:29:15] that he would try to get her killed and
[1:29:17] have it assumed that she played the part
[1:29:19] of a harlot what's he trying to do after
[1:29:22] the fall in the Garden of Eden he's
[1:29:24] always been after the feminist
[1:29:26] counterpart don't you understand he
[1:29:28] knows he can never be able to get the
[1:29:30] male counterpart which is God but there
[1:29:33] was also female counterparts or
[1:29:35] attributes in the Eternal and he knows
[1:29:38] looking at us that we are the weaker
[1:29:41] that we are the ones in mortal flesh and
[1:29:43] that if he can try to stop the program
[1:29:45] of God he ain't going to try to get the
[1:29:47] Lord Jesus down he ain't going to try to
[1:29:50] make the Lord Jesus weary but he'll try
[1:29:52] to work on the female counterpart on the
[1:29:55] earth if he can stop you and I from
[1:29:58] coming to our position there will be no
[1:30:01] Resurrection there will be no Rapture
[1:30:03] there will be no raising from the dead
[1:30:06] but the Lord ain't worried because he
[1:30:09] knows the bride's fixing to get a body
[1:30:13] change oh
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:18] Hallelujah now notice the curse of the
[1:30:21] law rested upon the ammonites
[1:30:25] and the
[1:30:26] moabites so a moabitas could not enter
[1:30:29] into the congregation of the Lord until
[1:30:32] the 10th Generation and a generation was
[1:30:35] allocated for 40 years
[1:30:37] 400
[1:30:43] years 400
[1:30:45] years which would have
[1:30:47] excluded King
[1:30:51] David amen
[1:30:54] you'll find that in Deuteronomy
[1:30:56] 233 therefore the law could not bring
[1:31:01] Ruth in the law would have kept her out
[1:31:06] there's only one way to bring Ruth into
[1:31:08] the economy of God
[1:31:12] grace sir and Grace just so happened to
[1:31:17] be
[1:31:18] personified in a human
[1:31:20] being called
[1:31:22] Boaz Hallelujah let's take Grace off the
[1:31:25] pages of the Bible let's take Grace out
[1:31:27] of the out of the pages of a dictionary
[1:31:30] let's Let It Be embodied in
[1:31:33] us or we may find quotes and find
[1:31:35] scriptures that are seem like I I dare
[1:31:37] say there's probably not a person
[1:31:38] sitting here tonight it's been saved
[1:31:39] very long that we couldn't find a quote
[1:31:41] or a scripture for most of us and pretty
[1:31:43] much put keep all of us

[1:31:52] Headstone come crying Grace
[1:31:55] Grace Oh Glory grace alone can help her
[1:32:01] and this grace is
[1:32:04] personified in Boaz now watch this in

[1:32:19] owner oh no brother
[1:32:21] Donnie I see where you're going
[1:32:24] now you're going on that old
[1:32:27] predestination stuff ain't
[1:32:29] you you call it old predestination stuff
[1:32:33] if you want to I call it a great key to
[1:32:36] God's great plan it ain't stuff come on
[1:32:41] somebody I I tell you you know when I
[1:32:44] came here years and years
[1:32:45] ago brother Jerry
[1:32:48] Phillips was one of the first Brothers
[1:32:52] him and brother JD but brother Jerry I
[1:32:54] remember in particular brother Skip and
[1:32:57] some of us was talking about
[1:32:59] it and whenever brother Jerry come to me
[1:33:02] and we started talking he said brother
[1:33:04] how how how do you believe in election
[1:33:05] and stuff how do you believe in
[1:33:09] predestination I said well I believe it
[1:33:11] the way the Bible taught it the way the
[1:33:12] prophet taught it that there was a seed
[1:33:14] in you he said is that the way you
[1:33:17] believe it us yes sir he said well I'm
[1:33:20] going to tell you right now there's a
[1:33:21] bunch of folks in Happy Valley they
[1:33:24] don't believe it that
[1:33:25] way I said you're kidding
[1:33:28] me I mean I was dumb okay you think well
[1:33:31] what's new about that I know I'm just
[1:33:32] Dumber now I know but I thought
[1:33:35] everybody believed
[1:33:37] predestination boy was I
[1:33:40] surprised so I started studying on it
[1:33:43] and I started preaching on it boy the
[1:33:45] more I'd preach the more some folks
[1:33:46] would get mad and leave and I'm thinking
[1:33:49] oh my goodness I thought this Happy
[1:33:51] Valley Church that come to the message
[1:33:53] and how many ever years ago I thought
[1:33:55] they believed what the Bible said and
[1:33:58] what the prophet taught and you know
[1:33:59] what I found out after them how many
[1:34:01] ever years I've been here now I found
[1:34:04] out there's still folks around the
[1:34:05] message of the hour that don't believe
[1:34:07] predestination the way the Bible taught
[1:34:09] it they don't believe it the way the
[1:34:11] prophet taught it well come on somebody
[1:34:14] I hope there ain't none of them people
[1:34:15] here tonight already surely goodness I
[1:34:17] done preach most of them out of here by
[1:34:19] now but I can see why the devil don't
[1:34:21] want you to believe in predestination
[1:34:24] because you'll never recognize who you
[1:34:26] are until you see the election of God
[1:34:29] you'll always get hung up on yourself
[1:34:32] you get hung up on your shortcoming and
[1:34:34] you keep looking at this and this and
[1:34:37] this and you think that's you I'm here
[1:34:39] to tell you tonight that ain't you that
[1:34:42] ain't you the real you is a son or
[1:34:45] daughter of God that was in the mind of
[1:34:47] God before the foundation of the world
[1:34:49] it ain't this house you live in
[1:35:00] so I kind of noticed after preaching on
[1:35:02] this for a bit brother Jerry get around
[1:35:06] me kind of talk a little
[1:35:10] quieter brother I'm I'm with
[1:35:12] you that's that's the way I beli that he
[1:35:15] say smile come on his face that that's
[1:35:16] the way I believed that I wouldn't I
[1:35:18] wasn't sure how you believed it I said
[1:35:19] well you know how I believe her now in
[1:35:21] case y'all don't know I still believe it
[1:35:23] the same way except stronger tonight
[1:35:26] than I was 30 some years ago whenever I
[1:35:28] got here that's the only thing that's
[1:35:30] going to get us out of here as a matter
[1:35:32] of fact the prophet said if he didn't
[1:35:33] believe in election he'd be a mighty
[1:35:35] discouraged man I'm so glad God ain't
[1:35:38] depending on me and God ain't depending
[1:35:40] on you and God ain't depending on no
[1:35:43] human being to get there and God knew
[1:35:45] there was no flesh he could trust nobody
[1:35:48] I don't care how long they've been
[1:35:49] preaching how long they've been singing
[1:35:51] how long they've been shouting and
[1:35:53] jumping around God trust his word and
[1:35:56] God made that seed out of his word and
[1:35:59] planted that seed inside of you by the
[1:36:02] grace of
[1:36:04] God
[1:36:12] woo can I feel one minute thank
[1:36:16] you

[1:37:03] interceding until his blood has atoned
[1:37:06] for every
[1:37:08] person and the lamb now knows what's
[1:37:11] written in the book so he knowed from
[1:37:12] before the foundation of the world their
[1:37:14] names were in there so we stood back
[1:37:17] here and done medior work
[1:37:20] like this until the mediatorial work
[1:37:23] everyone that's been put in the book has
[1:37:25] been redeemed and it's

[1:38:04] Queen and he's going to be saying Here I
[1:38:06] Am Lord Here I Am
[1:38:09] Lord amen amen in this book is the whole
[1:38:15] secret of it wrapped up around Seven
[1:38:19] Seals God's law required a kinsman
[1:38:22] redeemer in the lamb come out boldly I
[1:38:25] am their Kinsman yes Lord I am their
[1:38:29] redeemer I now have made intercession
[1:38:31] for them and I've come to claim the
[1:38:35] rights for
[1:38:39] them amen amen I've come to claim the
[1:38:41] rights in that they have a right to
[1:38:43] everything that lost in the fall and
[1:38:46] I've paid the price oh
[1:38:48] brother Don't It Make You Feel
[1:38:52] religious amen
[1:38:54] now watch the title deed of redemption
[1:38:56] of all creation is in his
[1:38:58] hand and he's come to claim it back for
[1:39:02] the human
[1:39:04] race not claim it back to Angels but
[1:39:07] claim it back to the human which is
[1:39:09] given for to make sons and daughters
[1:39:11] again bring them back to the Garden of
[1:39:13] Eden everything they
[1:39:16] lost the whole creation trees animal
[1:39:19] life everything else oh my don't that
[1:39:21] make you feel good amen but now in this
[1:39:24] seven cell book of seals of redemption
[1:39:27] that the lamb took within
[1:39:33] himself he was the only one that could
[1:39:35] do it and he took it from the right hand
[1:39:38] of him to set upon the throne now
[1:39:40] declaim his
[1:39:41] Redemptive de claim his rights for me
[1:39:44] and you what he redeemed us
[1:39:48] from oh
[1:39:51] Lord notice paragraph page 105 now it
[1:39:55] comes here from this life seal now
[1:39:58] listen
[1:40:00] carefully you see when the prophet
[1:40:02] begins to preach
[1:40:04] this and if people don't follow
[1:40:08] carefully now listen when you go to
[1:40:11] listening to the Seven
[1:40:13] Seals keep this in
[1:40:15] mind the first sermon that he preaches
[1:40:19] is God in
[1:40:20] Simplicity then that night he preaches
[1:40:24] the
[1:40:25] breach then the next night he preaches
[1:40:28] the first seal so remember when he
[1:40:31] preaches God in Simplicity and when he
[1:40:33] preaches the
[1:40:35] breach the
[1:40:37] seals have not been yet fully opened
[1:40:40] even to him right so this is why some of
[1:40:44] the brethren in the message have taken
[1:40:46] quotes many of them from the
[1:40:49] breach and try to
[1:40:52] say that there was no more Mercy after
[1:40:56] 1963 because remember from where the
[1:40:59] Prophet is looking at it at the time
[1:41:01] remember he tells us in the first seal I
[1:41:03] would have made a horrible mistake today
[1:41:05] you remember that all right now watch
[1:41:08] each one of those seals is coming open
[1:41:11] every day right so Monday was the first
[1:41:15] Tuesday was the second on down on down
[1:41:17] then question answers and then he
[1:41:18] finishes up on the seventh seal on
[1:41:20] Sunday
[1:41:21] night so as he's PR preaching they're
[1:41:23] coming open each day so he preached the
[1:41:25] first seal but he didn't know what the
[1:41:27] second one was this is what he said he
[1:41:30] didn't know what the third one was or
[1:41:31] the fourth one was on down until each
[1:41:34] angel came each day and made known the
[1:41:36] mystery to that angel so there is a
[1:41:40] mysterious opening of the seals and that
[1:41:43] is by a symbol but then there's also a
[1:41:47] reality opening of the seals now keep
[1:41:51] that in mind when you listen to it
[1:41:52] because because it's so easy to
[1:41:54] intertwine it and you place it wrong
[1:41:57] dispensation this is what some of the
[1:41:59] Brethren have done not that I think I
[1:42:00] know so much but you like to go back and
[1:42:03] study what he said and just compare what
[1:42:05] he said to what he said I know there
[1:42:08] some folks around the message think
[1:42:10] brother Brown was totally infallible and
[1:42:12] they think brother Brown knew everything
[1:42:13] about everything but that just shows
[1:42:15] they don't believe what he said himself
[1:42:18] God don't show his profets everything
[1:42:20] that is a direct quote so notice now
[1:42:22] what happens now he comes from here at
[1:42:25] this last seal he's no more mediator the
[1:42:27] last seal he's King now what he does he
[1:42:30] do if he's King has to have subjects and
[1:42:32] his subject is them that he's redeemed
[1:42:34] that cannot come before him until he
[1:42:37] takes the rights of redemption so you
[1:42:40] see all of our loved ones that are going
[1:42:42] on and passing through the channel of
[1:42:44] death they are not going Before the
[1:42:49] mediatorial Throne into the seventh
[1:42:51] Dimension where are they going going
[1:42:54] sixth
[1:42:56] Dimension where have all of our loved
[1:42:59] ones gone that have belied the word and
[1:43:00] they're being identified with Malachi 4
[1:43:02] where are they tonight where brother
[1:43:04] Jerry go the other day sixth Dimension
[1:43:06] where sister Judy go sixth Dimension
[1:43:09] rest of our Saints your husbands your
[1:43:10] wives your children whatever they are
[1:43:12] they have not gone into the seventh
[1:43:14] Dimension yet because the lamb has not
[1:43:17] claimed his rights of possession why
[1:43:21] brother Donnie what's he waiting on on
[1:43:23] maybe it's your son maybe it's your
[1:43:25] daughter maybe it's your
[1:43:27] husband now notice he says his subjects
[1:43:30] is them that he's redeem and they cannot
[1:43:32] come before him they cannot come before
[1:43:36] him until he takes the rights of
[1:43:39] redemption now this is not that he has
[1:43:42] to die again he's already done that
[1:43:43] taken care of finished he's done sit
[1:43:46] down after that but remember Redemption
[1:43:48] is in stages so he purchases and he pays
[1:43:53] full price of the penalty then he has to
[1:43:57] take the book and when he claims that
[1:44:00] book it releases the right of the
[1:44:04] redeemed so they go to the sixth
[1:44:06] Dimension until this happens until he
[1:44:09] takes the right of redemption and now he
[1:44:11] walks forth from a mediate where death
[1:44:14] put us in the grave he comes forth with
[1:44:17] the rights amen when the lamb slain
[1:44:20] walked forward from eternity
[1:44:24] out of the father's Throne notice where
[1:44:26] he come out of he walked out of the
[1:44:29] father's
[1:44:30] Throne so there wasn't three beings
[1:44:33] setting up there in heaven and the
[1:44:34] father had a throne and the son had a
[1:44:36] throne and the Holy Ghost had a throne
[1:44:38] but there was one throne and the lamb
[1:44:40] actually walked out of the father's
[1:44:43] Throne it was the father's projection of
[1:44:45] himself in a condescending form that we
[1:44:48] call Son of
[1:44:50] God when the lamb slain walked for
[1:44:53] forward from eternity out of the
[1:44:54] father's throne and took his rights it
[1:44:57] was a judgment seat then he become not a
[1:45:01] lamb but a lion Comm a
[1:45:05] king and he calls for his Queen to come
[1:45:08] stand by his side know you not that the
[1:45:10] Saints shall judge the Earth notice
[1:45:12] there then he comes he leaves the throne
[1:45:15] as an
[1:45:17] intercessor as a slain lamb to become a
[1:45:21] Lion King
[1:45:24] I hate to inform Disney but this is the
[1:45:26] original Lion
[1:45:33] King amen so what is he doing even this
[1:45:37] very night if there's not but one name
[1:45:39] left if there's not but one little Asian
[1:45:41] or one black African somewhere or some
[1:45:44] white Caucasian on Ireland or Scotland
[1:45:46] or wherever it is he will be right there
[1:45:49] on that Throne I'm glad he would do it
[1:45:51] cuz that last one could have been me or
[1:45:53] it could have been you aren't you glad
[1:45:54] he'll wait on
[1:45:56] one so the whole thing is hinged upon
[1:45:59] them coming in every one of them he
[1:46:02] comes and he leaves the throne as an
[1:46:04] intercessor as a slain lamb to become a
[1:46:07] lion king to bring the whole world into
[1:46:10] judgment that's rejected our kinsman
[1:46:12] redeemer then is King over all why he's
[1:46:15] got the title deed of redemption it all
[1:46:17] Lays within his hand I'm glad I know him
[1:46:22] then claims his inheritance that's the
[1:46:25] church the bride now let's skip down
[1:46:27] here to this next one here it lays in
[1:46:30] the future
[1:46:32] notice so Mercy was not over that night
[1:46:36] when he's preaching this on the
[1:46:38] breach but here it lays in the future
[1:46:41] what lays in the future when the lamb
[1:46:43] will step from the mediatorial throne
[1:46:45] and call for his bride then mercy is
[1:46:48] over not March of 1963 Mercy was over
[1:46:51] but this Lays in the future friends you
[1:46:55] understand there's people around our
[1:46:56] message that taught their kids years ago
[1:46:58] that if they was born after 77 they
[1:47:00] couldn't even be saved there was a
[1:47:02] generation of people there's people
[1:47:04] sitting here not that had family and
[1:47:05] went to church with
[1:47:07] them and that was a generation of people
[1:47:09] that were lost think of it by the
[1:47:13] ignorance of
[1:47:14] preachers and the ignorance of
[1:47:17] parents of getting a quote here and one
[1:47:20] there and one there you imagine raising
[1:47:22] your children and telling them there's
[1:47:24] no mercy for
[1:47:25] you can you imagine what kind of people
[1:47:28] they turned into what a shame yes
[1:47:31] sir thank God for True men of
[1:47:35] God oh
[1:47:39] my notice it here it lays in the future
[1:47:44] tonight he's a mediator but he's coming
[1:47:48] to this it's even
[1:47:51] dispensation Christ must come to the
[1:47:53] allotted word you understand so tonight
[1:47:57] is's the mediator he has not yet come to
[1:48:00] this
[1:48:00] position oh praise God oh Hallelujah
[1:48:06] jump down you with me to Christ of God
[1:48:08] now you see the seals when he was in his
[1:48:10] mediatorial work back to redeeming but
[1:48:13] someday now notice this is July the 28
[1:48:17] 1963 4 months after the breach is
[1:48:20] preached
[1:48:25] someday he comes forth to get this
[1:48:29] book now wait a minute I thought he said
[1:48:31] he already got the book and the
[1:48:33] seals well in the symbolic form of the
[1:48:36] Revelation he
[1:48:38] did
[1:48:39] right well brother Donnie what kind of
[1:48:42] book is it a great old big book or what
[1:48:44] is it there well let's just find out and
[1:48:47] all that's in this book would be
[1:48:50] him for that's the believer amen yes sir
[1:48:55] the
[1:48:56] words in the
[1:48:59] book
[1:49:02] wow and the word is him and all that's
[1:49:05] in the book and he come forth for this
[1:49:06] book of redemption whose names are
[1:49:08] written on the book before the
[1:49:10] foundation of the world when the lamb
[1:49:12] was slain back to the first now the
[1:49:13] mystery of the book are revealed when
[1:49:15] the seals are broken notice the mystery
[1:49:19] in mysterious form it's revealed when
[1:49:21] the seals are broken
[1:49:23] and when the seals
[1:49:27] completely listen when the seals
[1:49:30] completely are broken the time of
[1:49:35] redemption is
[1:49:39] over which was not in 63 and it wasn't
[1:49:42] in 77 and it wasn't in 88 and it wasn't
[1:49:46] in 98 and it wasn't in 2008 come
[1:49:50] on he's the only one that know know when
[1:49:53] it
[1:49:53] is let's Stand
[1:49:56] Together praise be to God praise be to
[1:50:02] God so just stand I didn't say I was
[1:50:05] done I just told you stand up that's all
[1:50:07] right on so the
[1:50:09] book wasn't at the
[1:50:15] cross so he paid the price for the
[1:50:19] book but it wasn't at the cross so he he
[1:50:23] had to wait to take the
[1:50:25] book when he was righteous
[1:50:29] again I know that nearly chokes us to
[1:50:33] death I want you to listen to
[1:50:37] this I found this this evening I just
[1:50:39] sat in my chair and I just said Oh Glory
[1:50:41] to God lord
[1:50:45] Jesus the
[1:50:47] Earth didn't want
[1:50:50] him heavens
[1:50:54] couldn't have
[1:50:57] him he was a
[1:51:02] sinner so the Earth didn't want him and
[1:51:06] the heavens couldn't have
[1:51:08] him cuz he was a sinner oh my if you
[1:51:11] could only realize just think the Earth
[1:51:13] didn't know its
[1:51:14] creator heaven couldn't receive him
[1:51:18] because he had the sin of the Earth
[1:51:23] on
[1:51:24] him oh children don't you love this
[1:51:27] message don't you just love this message
[1:51:29] this message didn't come to to replace
[1:51:31] our Bible the message come to make the
[1:51:34] Bible a new
[1:51:36] book this is why Satan don't want this
[1:51:39] message preached he hates this message
[1:51:42] and he hates for preachers to get into
[1:51:44] this message and study it and preach it
[1:51:47] he hates it and the more he hates it the
[1:51:49] more we're going to do it
[1:51:59] so think heaven couldn't receive him
[1:52:02] because he had the sin of the Earth on
[1:52:04] him the Earth didn't want him they
[1:52:08] rejected and said away with such a fell
[1:52:11] Heavens couldn't receive him because he
[1:52:14] was a
[1:52:16] sinner so don't you understand there's
[1:52:18] only one place left for him to go
[1:52:25] hell
[1:52:27] demonology part
[1:52:29] two paragraph
[1:52:33] 199 and when I
[1:52:36] think that God sent him to
[1:52:40] hell because of his
[1:52:46] sins so he died out of the presence of
[1:52:50] God so you wouldn't have to
[1:52:59] don't you understand the Lord Jesus
[1:53:00] could not quote in his
[1:53:02] death Psalm
[1:53:05] 23 y though I walk through the valley of
[1:53:08] the shadow of
[1:53:10] death I will fear no
[1:53:13] evil for thou art with
[1:53:17] me he couldn't quote that brother
[1:53:20] Fred because the father can not
[1:53:24] stand to look upon
[1:53:28] sin so the book was not at the
[1:53:33] cross so he had to go to
[1:53:36] hell had to do something with all that
[1:53:38] sin he was packing
[1:53:41] yes don't you understand what he did
[1:53:43] with
[1:53:44] it he took it down to Hell
[1:53:48] right he went down to Hell as a sinner
[1:53:52] is
[1:53:53] unrighteous but all he's got to do is
[1:53:57] unload all of
[1:53:59] that right there where it belongs anyway
[1:54:02] not on you and not on
[1:54:05] him and he unloads all of that right
[1:54:08] there and what does he do then he kicks
[1:54:09] the door down on hell and reaches in
[1:54:11] there and grabs the keys off the devil's
[1:54:13] side and he goes immediately righteous
[1:54:16] form of theophany right over to paradise
[1:54:19] and sets Abraham free
[1:54:22] hallelujah
[1:54:24] hallelujah thank you
[1:54:26] Lord thank you Lord
[1:54:31] Jesus notice and Paul says in Hebrews
[1:54:33] 9:24 for Christ has not entered into the
[1:54:36] holy places made with
[1:54:38] hands which are the figures of the truth
[1:54:41] but into heaven itself now
[1:54:46] now to
[1:54:48] appear in the presence of
[1:54:50] God for us than the continual appearance
[1:54:56] of our Lord Jesus Christ in heaven for
[1:55:00] us is our great high
[1:55:02] priest is all we need think of
[1:55:05] it the justice of God is
[1:55:09] met seeing the
[1:55:12] face of the Lord Jesus that's all he
[1:55:14] need it's not like he has to bring a
[1:55:16] whole big bunch of blood and and a bunch
[1:55:18] of goats and a bunch of sheeps and a
[1:55:20] bunch of turtle notice how Paul puts it
[1:55:23] he he so he appears in the presence of
[1:55:27] God and just when he simply walks
[1:55:30] in God says my Justice is
[1:55:40] met our Justice is man it's
[1:55:43] satisfied he just walks
[1:55:47] in and in his
[1:55:50] face the justice of God was
[1:55:54] met and he stands right there so when
[1:55:56] you fall short of the glory of God and I
[1:55:58] fall short of the glory of God his
[1:56:00] presence he ever liveth to make
[1:56:02] intercession for us and he saves Paul
[1:56:06] goes on to say to the
[1:56:11] uttermost you Lord thank you Lord and
[1:56:14] that word don't only mean in time but
[1:56:19] forever you will never need anything
[1:56:23] else beyond that
[1:56:26] savior we're saved to the
[1:56:38] uttermost for Christ has not entered
[1:56:40] into the holy places made with hands
[1:56:42] which are the figures of the truth but
[1:56:43] into heaven itself now to
[1:56:47] appear just by him walking in
[1:56:54] in the presence of God for us so the
[1:56:56] continual appearance of Our Lord speaks
[1:57:00] for our innocence
[1:57:03] forever the very side of Jesus satisfied
[1:57:08] the justice of God he just himself just
[1:57:13] himself Hebrews 7:24 but this man this
[1:57:18] man because he continuous ever
[1:57:24] as an unchangeable
[1:57:26] priesthood wherefore he is able also to
[1:57:30] save
[1:57:32] them to the
[1:57:35] uttermost thank you Lord and the word
[1:57:37] means all together perfectly so that
[1:57:41] nothing should be wanting
[1:57:44] afterwards
[1:57:45] forever thank
[1:57:47] you praise be to God
[1:57:52] praise the
[1:57:54] Lord oh don't you love
[1:57:58] him praise
[1:58:00] God let's bow our heads together if you
[1:58:04] would how many would just like to say to
[1:58:07] the Lord Jesus tonight father I need to
[1:58:10] understand this greater yes Lord I do
[1:58:15] I've got both hands up before you
[1:58:16] tonight father I've studied it for
[1:58:19] decades and looked at it for years and
[1:58:21] yet Lord Lord sometimes I wonder how
[1:58:24] much I even know about it how much I
[1:58:26] even understand may we never get to a
[1:58:30] spot to where we think well we've been
[1:58:32] around for so many years and we've
[1:58:34] listened to so many tapes and I'm not
[1:58:36] sure that I can learn anymore help us to
[1:58:38] realize this word will still be
[1:58:40] unfolding
[1:58:42] itself you are so fathomless for the
[1:58:45] human mind on through
[1:58:48] eternity you will still be revealing

[1:58:55] us oh we worship you tonight Lord
[1:59:00] Jesus oh
[1:59:02] God how is it that

[1:59:08] awesome

[1:59:16] much we know in our own lives it's
[1:59:19] sometimes beautiful will of God God can
[1:59:22] be so
[1:59:24] painful I believe with all of my heart

[1:59:28] will to take my little
[1:59:31] daughter from this
[1:59:34] world but
[1:59:36] oh how it's
[1:59:41] hurt as I lay
[1:59:44] today tears rolling out of my cheeks
[1:59:47] down my face sweating my pill on both
[1:59:49] sides
[1:59:52] because of your beautiful wonderful will
[1:59:56] of
[1:59:58] God how you screamed in the Garden of
[2:00:01] Gethsemane and
[2:00:02] cried on the cross dying the death of a
[2:00:07] sinner for the beautiful
[2:00:11] awesome will of
[2:00:14] God help us
[2:00:17] Jesus help
