what's pulling us tonight [Music] everybody's feeling some pull if the world could sing the worldly rendition of that song tonight the words would be different the verses would say different things i feel the pull it's pulling in my veins i feel the pull it's pulling me to kill i feel the pull spoiling me to do this or that but i'm glad i feel this to life to love to be a child of god let's read if you would book a revelation tonight chapter 12 verse 7. this is where the pull of the end time for those who are not washed by the water of the word this is where they're fixing to be gathered revelation 12 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels now keep in mind who his angels are angels that god created for his own purpose and they fell from their estate in heaven remember satan was the first preacher that tried to pull people out of their position and prevail not neither was their place found anymore in heaven notice how the john says this neither was their place they had an allocation an allotment that was actually their place but neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice in heaven saying now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death that's real bride people right there therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time let's pray together heavenly father if we did not have a hope of being able to miss this that we have read i'm afraid we would be so sad and so depressed and so gloomy we would not want to live another day to see and hear the things that are fixing to break loose on the earth and to know father that you have made a way that we can escape if we wish to you even told us how to pray and what to say when we pray it pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man lord god may you speak to us tonight from your word we ask in the name of jesus amen god bless you you may be seated i realize there's an element of christians that don't really see a need for a preacher to preach deeper things or preach things that they really say don't understand or don't comprehend they they would rather have a preacher that would preach pretty much where they are and if your first grade teacher would have taught you that much you reckon you'd ever graduated out of the first grade but she had to prod you you know there's an element about the bible that many people miss and it's why that many preachers are not really pulled upon by their congregation especially pastors to preach the full bible now it's one thing to say that we are full gospel people but it's another thing for the preachers who say they are full gospel to preach the full bible i know i'm leading you out on a limb but don't worry i'll get you off and i won't saw us off so there's more to the bible to preach than just salvation healing miracles blessings new cars new houses right so whenever men of god are inspired by the spirit of god to go into avenues that people aren't aware of many times people were set in the service well i didn't understand that i didn't get much out of that i don't understand that i like hearing a preacher like that so you don't like to be challenged you only want me brother daryl brother joel whoever the rest of the ministers ever come in here is just basically preach what you already know you don't want us to ever go in any realm of a sphere of the word of god that's not beyond you i i don't understand your thinking at all myself i want to sit under men of god that motivate me to study the word that motivate me to move higher amen now this is the key why that that some people don't do that listen to this in the kinsmen redeemer brother rahm said the bible is a love story the whole bible is a love story not only is it a love story but it's a prophet not only is it a prophet it's also a history all right so the bible is a love story the bible is a prophet in that peculiar that you'd say the bible is a prophet so the bible is the love story the bible is a prophet and the bible is history now he said it's a love story a history a prophet it's god himself so for me i want to be a full bible preacher okay i don't want to just preach healing alone i preach even i believe in healing but the whole bible is not just about healing the whole bible is more than john 3 16. the whole bible is more than just preaching about salvation every night i figure the majority are you folks saved here tonight how many all saved how many y'all been saved for at least a week or two so is it okay if i preach something beyond salvation tonight now for somebody i hear this loss we will certainly make way for you too all right anybody here most y'all believe malachi 4 god sent a prophet most y'all believe there's one god most y'all been baptized the right way so you want me to keep going over and over and over and over and again so you'll feel comfortable sitting there backsliding no not if you love god you don't you'll tell me man of god preach what god lays on your heart and if i have to go back and listen to it five times it'll inspire me it'll stir me now once again in christ the mystery of god revealed he said the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life so four gospel preachers aren't necessarily for bible preachers so a full bible preacher especially pastors are going to get into more than just healing miracles signs wonders now there's no way evangelist is going to go out and preach a 37 part series because the pastor angler invited him back for 37 services more than likely so you can't expect an evangelist or a traveling minister that goes out from church to church to church but a pastor god will move upon them and they will go into areas of the word to where that they will be able to bring something about the word to their people that the people can sit there under them for decades and never get bored on the word amen now how is that even possible it's because god will take their gift and their understanding and as they grow now i saw last week some pictures and i saw some more today things by the way maybe they had posted them and it was the spec out in the universe that the hubble telescope had taken many many years ago now they aimed this new one james webb telescope out into the same field and it was like they said it would take a grain of sand and put it on the end of your finger and that's what it would be looking like that that tiny part of the universe and they took the exact same picture of the same stars now here it was and hubble was it was unbelievable compared to what they'd seen prior to that but now they take the same picture of the same part of the universe but they take it with new vision with a new capability to look at the same things and they're seeing constellations and stars and bright lights and colors and yellows and greens and oranges that they looked right at it under hubble don't you understand that's the way it is with the light of god's word looser looked out there and saw stars and he said oh my there's three of them father son holy ghost and wesley looked out there just a little bit farther and said oh my it's still father son holy ghost but we got to be sanctified and pentecost looked out there a little bit farther and then god got a prophet that was able to look way out there and said you know what you thought them was three stars but it actually was one they all blended together praise the lord now you see science wants to see more and they want to see farther and they want to see what they saw even clearer well i don't understand christians that don't myself to me is a child of god i want to understand the very basics of redemption and salvation not in the same repetitive form that i knew it 40 years ago but i want to see it with a clearer understanding don't you sanctification baptism of the holy ghost heaven hell all of those great things i honestly don't think we'll ever reach a spot that will ever understand it all as a matter of fact in eternity he will still be revealing himself because he is the eternal one so then the bible is a book of love it is a book of songs prophet another place says it's a book of poetry it is a book of history it is also a book of redemption it is also a book of mystery so in this great book is all these aspects of the same book and yet some people never go beyond we're just getting saved and sanctified and teaching me how i can overcome and all that i don't need to understand all the rest of this stuff well if it's in the bible god apparently wants somebody to be able to understand it myself and i look at it and say well lord maybe i ain't got the understanding but please let me hear somebody one of these preachers out here somewhere that god has dealt with so let me find something where the prophet said i just don't think that god placed scriptures in the bible to take up space do you i believe they're there for a reason now whenever we look at this in the book of revelation i know it's one of the most misunderstood books in the bible and this is the reason that we needed a prophet to come and bring a prophetic class of people along with it with a prophetic understanding so whenever i or brother dale or any other minister that's called of god when god lays something on our hearts to preach and it might not be exactly where your understanding is don't sit there and say oh my i can't understand i can't get nothing well maybe god wanted you to grow up a little bit more and pull up a little bit higher is that right now watch we're going to break in to whenever the bride goes up and satan comes down and the picture changes because it's a dispensational change that it moves from the grace of god to the wrath of god it moves from the lawyer of god being on the throne changing his garments and becoming under the aspect of the man child of revelation 12. now the man child of revelation 12 is actually the serpent bruiser the serpent bruiser whenever god is able to consummate the man child and bring it back up into the presence of god which happened of course 2 000 years ago but this other missing part of himself the entire reconciliation of the bride and groom is not finished until our rapture and resurrection now i find this amazing because satan was not cast out of heaven as soon as the lord jesus went up 2 000 years ago now was that that a great victory was not that a tremendous thing when the lord jesus overcome death hell on the grave and ascended right up and went right back on the throne of god and has been there as our kinsmen redeemer for 2000 years and yet that ascent into the presence of god never kicked him out of heaven that never rendered him powerless and sent him down to the earth but even with our lawyer being on the throne of god he can still have access to the throne of god and go before him day and night accusing us but here we read of something that has happened what was it it was not that a lion come it was not that an angel come what was it that made this great change that rendered satan finally powerless when the bride goes up so when the bride goes up into the presence of god those people who he has been accusing he can accuse no more so he loses his position before the throne of god as the opposing attorney i'll tell you one thing if you and i could ever let it grip our hearts by revelation and satan keeps trying to bring up your past and your mistakes and your failures if you by revelation could ever move into that spot to where you refuse to allow him to condemn you for those things you're forgiven of and you refuse not god but you refuse to allow him to bring up all of your past and remind you of them ten thousands of things that you've done wrong but you draw that line and say no more devil out of here i'm sick of it i'm sick of hearing my past yes i did that but that was the old man i'm a new man now i'm a new woman i'm a brand new creature in christ jesus he will begin to lose his hole on you before your ever changed oh hallelujah he will begin to lose his hold of power and authority on you before your body ever changes one cell now read with me here in revelation chapter 12 verse 13 and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child so when the dragon is now cast out of heaven into the earth knowing that his defeat has been brought about by the conquest of the man child now who is the man child the lord jesus and the lord jesus was produced out of the woman which was draped in this crimson color and all that that that john was able to see by vision and she brought forth the man-child it was the result of the manchild's victory that his back has been broke and the man-child's wife is now caught up into the presence of god and whenever she's called up into the presence of god the devil can't condemn her no more because the part that he was condemning which is her mortality has been changed now it can point his finger well they've done this they've done that they don't pray right they don't do this and that and the other and we constantly need a lawyer there before us is that right and he represents us but once the bride child is raised up and united with the man child then they themselves become one and the body has been changed satan can no longer condemn that bride oh happy day happy day then what does satan do notice now how his hatred begins to change up prior to this time he's focused on that bright church that's what all that he's been against so he's focusing on that now that she's lifted from the earth then what does he do he changes his hatred and he aims his hatred toward whom toward the woman that gave birth to this man child because the man child was actually the problem now the woman herself was not the problem in herself so he will concentrate his hatred notice this what the scripture said he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child now who was the woman the one of course was israel so the woman that was clothed in the sun and there she was clothed in the sun and she had 12 stars and all the symbolism of course and it was israel and whenever the sun came out of there then the sun was received up into the presence of god and a place was prepared for the woman in the wilderness and there she fled and she was kept time times and half a time which is three and a half years great tribulation the last part of daniel 7 is weak now notice this the prophet isaiah speaks of a prophetic time in the last days that will come isaiah 26 20 come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment now notice come my people god speaking to israel god speaking to the chosen 144 000 and beckoning them by the prophetic voice of the old testament come as it were but for a little moment until the indignation or the tribulation period be overpass notice isaiah 27 1 in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan now leviathan is a creature that's really hard for bible scholars to even identify what it was they thought it might have been a crocodile some thought it might have been a hippo they're not really exactly sure what it was but it's pretty plain to see here in the spiritual symbolism of isaiah 27 that he says the strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even the vile sand that crooked serpent and shall slay the dragon that is in the sea now notice your god in chapter 26 tells them to come into a place of protection that he has provided for them and there they will be kept from the great indignation on the earth and then god says by the same prophet that he will turn right around and punish the leviathan the crooked serpent of course you know the symbolism of the devil was a serpent from the old testament on down now notice whenever the dragon in revelation 12 17 and the dragon was ross with a woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and the testimony of jesus christ so here we have two categories of people we have people that are keeping the commandments of god the old mosaic law and then we have another category of people which are keeping the testimony of jesus christ notice he doesn't say both of them have kept that so you've got the jews pre-conversion you've got the jews before receiving the holy ghost and that's why the prophet said many of them will be them orthodox jews and they'll come out they'll be looking for their brother joseph they'll be looking for their messiah and these are the two that they'll be brought together and satan will come down on the earth with great wrath to look for the woman and for the remnant of her seed now here's where we get to what the prophet called the free threefold purpose of the sixth seal and the threefold purpose of the seventh seal now this is not just big words these are his words i believe they're important don't you now we find out also on the seventh seal who said that in this sixth seal now being open it was four or three full purpose here was the purposes the first thing was the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification now notice if the sleeping virgin was under the blood of the lord jesus as they say they are and the prophet of course tells us in the first seal they're not actually under the blood they think they are if they were under the blood there's no way they would need to go through a tribulation period to be purified the blood would make them absolutely sinless [Applause] so they think they're under the blood but they have to go through the tribulation period so the first fold of the revealing of this seal shows that they must be a people that will be purged so there's threefold purpose and the first one is that the gentile foolish virgin must be purged second fold of this is the 144 thousand must be purged third fold is that the earth itself must be purged this is the threefold purpose now he said the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the bible the blood the cross god soul of the world he gave his only begotten son what the message the message this she was done in the tribulation period we say that wind up and revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter she had been purged and she's been given white now notice this is the symbolism that they saw on the fifth seal she's given robes now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message now in this other paragraph he said it was people that had to be washed and cleansed of their you know of the message itself so there's some that didn't receive it some that rejected it or in some way they were blinded by these false prophets and they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in their heart and god knows their heart and hear their purge during this time so some will never hear about the message some will hear about it but they'll just not be bribed and they won't blaspheme and make all kinds of stupid websites and all kinds of things like that look for in some infos they've done across the line there's absolutely no mercy form at all no and god will give them blood to drink because they've crossed the line between mercy and judgment notice they're another purging time that's for israel when she gathers that's the second fold god purges israel and the tribulation period out of the millions that will gather there there'll be a selected 144 000 that's purged also god purging israel there's a whole earth is to be purged there will be such a thing as the moon the stars and all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth renewing herself being purged getting ready for the millennium the millennium coming up think of it friends no wonder that the atomic fire will have to burn the earth so deep wonder how many landfills that we've got on the earth they take our garbage and make mountains you drive right by the one over here and going to johnson city they turn that thing into a mountain as they keep on going i'm not sure mount everest even be able to compare to it and what is it garbage full of plastic full of this and that and the other can't you see why god is going to burn this thing off and leave not one trace of man god said them that destroy the earth he will destroy all right no tree hugger there's one tree i hug and that's the tree my lord jesus died on but i do believe that god has laws that we must live by now notice this in the fourth seal he said if we find out here that this satan after being kicked out of heaven he incarnates himself in the beast and now he is a beast antichrist false prophet now beasts given the name of death and hell follows him fully satan on his throne now this cannot happen as long as the bride is here and once the bride goes up then satan is able to move into the last phase of his kingdom the total embodiment of himself in the false prophet then he's given the heart of a beast now the head demon will be inside of this false prophet until satan is cast down so the mechanics will already be gone i'm sure i am totally convinced that while the mechanics for the bride are being operated and moved right now for the rapture the mechanics of hell are also being operated on the other side there ain't no telling what's going on amongst our government officials there ain't no telling what they're doing and what they're planted because the devil ain't gonna have long he's gonna do everything he can and he himself is busy up there trying to accuse you so he's seen his head demon whatever his name is he's got him down here and he's trying to manipulate and if this ain't the pope then it'll be the next one if it ain't happening it'll be the next one and he will no doubt get his message from the man himself and say this is him get in him and hold that house till i come down hold that house shall i come down and then he will be given the heart of a beast which is what the nature of satan this is the heart that cain had in the garden of eden y'all with me tonight this is the heart that cain had in the garden of eden this is why it would kill his brother he had the heart of a beast can't you see why people have no problem murdering babies can't you see why people have no problem taking a gun and killing 19 children and school teachers and all of that can't you see why mass killings are going on everywhere they're getting in the spirit what kind of spirit is it tribulation death sorrow anxiety suffering like this world has never never never known that there's another group of people on the earth they're not getting in the spirit of tribulation they're not getting in the spirit of murder they're not getting in the spirit of violation to the word of god but they are getting in the spirit of unity and harmony and love and fellowship they're getting ready for a body change they're getting ready to meet the lord jesus [Applause] notice this in this fourth seal it continues on now we find out here that this satan after being kicked out of heaven incarnates himself in the beast and now he's a beast antichrist false prophet and now beast and given the name of death and hell follows him fully satan on his throne oh my on the earth he's satan's representative on the earth that is now his head of the kingdoms of the world the very same kingdoms he offered the lord jesus in matthew 4. but it was beneath the lord jesus to take such trash to rule over well come on satan don't mind ruining over perverts and homosexuals and transgenders and all kind of kind of stuff now listen you're a homosexual can come to god and get saved a transgender can come to god and get saved get filled with the holy ghost they won't be trans no more they'll be changed they'll be transformed well wasn't that good they will be transformed come on church they will be changed by the power of god i don't believe in the jesus that this modern age has that they want to come to god as they are stay as they are go to heaven as they are there is no gay streets in heaven there will be no rainbow flags flying around in heaven it is the banner of the blood of the lord jesus that has changed us and loosed us and cleansed us from those vile things [Applause] paul wrote to some of them in the new testament whenever he said that they used to be effeminate [Applause] they used to be but not after they met jesus [Applause] so y'all believe in trans at your church we do transformed come on [Music] we're living in a nation where many of our politicians are so scared to death of the people they can't even define what a woman is they can't even answer a simple question can a man get pregnant what in the world does it matter what in the world is going on hell is eking its way out don't you understand what it's doing and they laugh at god's word and life at god's people let them life we'll get the last one notice he says my satan now becomes full king now this happens later on he's false prophet now he will become beast after a while when he breaks his covenant there with the jews you know how we've been through it now notice he says he will be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan will incarnate himself because when the church goes up satan's cast out it's done then all of his accusing is done as long as the intercessor this is so phenomenal to me as long as the intercessor is on the throne look who's on the throne not a judge the intercessor himself no wonder he kept standing there before him and said this is a rigged trial this is rigged the judge ain't on the throne it's the intercessor himself the eternity their eternity is almost all out of the world do you expect me to ever win this case is that i don't and i tell you right now you ain't gonna win i've already won them's my people i represent my people as long as the intercessor is on the throne listen to this satan can stand there and accuse as long as the intercessor why hey it tells him the bride ain't here yet the intercessors on the throne that when he changes his clothes and changes and puts on the crown on his head spiritual we'll put it on natural but when he steps out of that roy he'll die you're dead satan says oh my time's limited now he don't know exactly he don't know exactly when the lord's coming he don't know how long it's going to be it's he got a year yeah 2 five ten he don't know but he knows when this takes place he's only got three and a half left so when he sees zach he said oh my then their sister left the throne today is rapture day the intercessor left the throne what's fixing to happen those i'm accusing fixing to come up on the song so they no longer need an intercessor but they're meeting him as their lovely bridegroom praise god as long as the intercessor is still on the throne satan can stand there and accuse because he is the attorney on the other side he's the opponent of christ and christ is standing there i love this little illustration the opponent is standing there saying by the way adam fell right i'd have done this can you imagine he's still accusing adam my lord i didn't wonder that he can sign there all these thousands of years look at all the accusations he's got to bring against all the people of god so if he's still accusing adam you can imagine what he's saying about us well that bunch of dirt bags sorry low down rotten good for nothing so and so but you got an attorney you've got an attorney oh hallelujah oh glory by the way i don't fall i've done this i've conquered him i got his wife to believe a lie as all them sayings he just said the truth was that a lie toll they fabricate that truth truths truth people that tell you the devil can't tell the truth have not studied the message far enough the biggest lie there's ever told has 90 some percent truth to it notice i got his wife to believe a lie you said should be damned by it and i got it but here's the mediator standing there brother man gets pretty excited himself he says amen the kinsman redeemer amen standing now with the blood that can take the vilest sinner's heart and change it listen to this a mediator is on the throne wow what what a position to have on the throne of god not a judge not a jury a mediator why it's testifying that is our need because you see how blind some of the brothers are when they try to say it past in 1963 it didn't pass in 63 73 83 93 23 20 and 13 he's still here he's still there and it will be till that last one comes in and when the last one comes in and it's finished we're gone i'm going back on he said get out of here devil oh hallelujah get out of here devil leave my house my wife is coming home oh praise god my wife is coming on get out [Applause] man my first time to see jesus i don't want that long tongue lying false accuser standing eating this hitting us said don't worry donnie i'm going to take care of it when you get up the accused will be gone come on sweetie come on a mediator is on the strong yes sir satan is sad but they're guilty jesus said they don't listen to that but i forgive them i took care of that a mediator on the throne [Applause] but when that transition is made no more mercy now remember roose had a sustaining portion that she had kept back and she brought home and gave it to naomi that which was reserved and even though the lamb will leave the mediatorial seat he has reserved enough holy ghost for 144 thousand the jews brought it to us the gentiles will take it back to them it's reserved under our covenant hallelujah to god what will happen then all hell brexits i hope and pray to god that there's no one under the sound of my voice no one that will hear this service will experience what we're about to see here before us notice this the noise of naught and the prophet says now watch the spirit following there will come a time in the name of the lord the people will go completely insane the bible says so they'll scream and holler great hideous things in their imaginary mind radios and things and television programs are producing it there'll be such things as ants raised up on the earth as high as 14 trees there will be a bird that will fly across the earth with wings four or five miles across and people will see them they'll scream and holler and cry for mercy but it will be the plagues where do i preach on those plagues opening that the only reason you and i are not experiencing these things tonight it's because we have a mediator on the throne they see the only reason the earth itself the people of the world that's not even saved aren't experiencing this tonight is because our mediator is there our kinsmen redeemer now they don't know it they never acknowledge it but it's because of our tithe to him and his relationship with us is what's keeping this from happening and it will never happen as long as she's here because this does not fit what he has in mind for her he don't even want her around he don't even want her here when this stuff is happening all glory to god he loves her so much that's why i know with each passing day as we're getting closer and closer and closer and i saw a picture today to where in certain cities in russia that they have put up billboards just in the last few weeks showing the pictures of alaska joined of course to the top of the united states and they are saying we want it back it belongs to us and we're going to take it oh my goodness now you wonder what does mr putin have in his mind i ain't going to lose no sleep over it i've got enough stuff to lose sleep over i sure lose it over him well praise the lord but they're making all of these threats saying all of these things as i told the young people here monday night and speaking to them that china and russia are the only ones that have hypersonic missiles we tried one of ours about two weeks ago and it fell miserably into the sea so we have supersonic but not hypersonic which can travel over 7 900 miles per hour we have nothing that can intercept them nothing that can stop them except feathers and if you're under the wings of the heavenly father you'll be out of here before they ever take off they can't move fast enough if they put a hyper on their hyper and put that hyper hopper on steroids and then put another hyper hyper it can't move as fast as the twinkling of an eye they think hyper missiles can move fast they ain't seen nothing yet until i get out of the bed one morning and i'm kidding everything boy my back sore and my feet sore and this is sore and all of a sudden i'll stand there and i'll see myself and i'll be an 18 year old man and that'll be my beautiful wife an 18 year old woman and say to say wow it's on it's all [Applause] right i'm faster than a hypersonic missile we will be caught up together to meet the lord in the air [Applause] [Music] this is going to be a very paradoxical type of service tonight you're going to feel a little bit of hell and a whole lot of heaven or you're going to feel a whole lot of hell and a little bit of heaven just depending on who you are myself i'd like a whole lot of heaven stuff just let me hear enough about health and we'll kind of know what's there and all that sort of thing you know i'm gonna say i need my home i didn't come from hell i ain't going back to hell i don't want nothing to do with it jesus went to hell so i don't have to [Applause] anybody ever find a series where i preached on hell anybody a serious why i preached on hell [Music] and now we're preaching a series on why should i take a series on hell when we can go back to the future home and take another series on that notice revelation 15 5 and after that i looked behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened what peculiar phraseology that he chooses to say this with the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues ah so what had been happening before this how come they didn't come before the attorney was on the mediatorial throne but see now him and the bride are at that great old big table some of y'all think you've had receptions and we've seen some nice ones around down here haven't we you ain't seen nothing yet oh praise god it's amazing because this is going on where we are in that new place and over here in the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony plagues are issuing forth from these seven angels and we're all just over here eating laughing rejoicing well not wonderful this week about the lord giving us that about laughing in heaven oh i thought that was so awesome i've been trying it out a little bit this week just see what it's going to be like can you imagine friend where there's a place nobody will ever frown there'll never be anybody with just a grim serious look on their face but everybody will be so happy it will be a degree of happiness that we have never known our sister brown my goodness if she could speak to us from the other side here tonight can you imagine she's done met the prophet she done met brother daniel nunley they probably shouted a little bit together her and brother jim bath they've done one of you know around and around through them green fields of blue grass my my hair and sister mary and on and on and on brother gene lehman and oh my we've had so many to go on we're getting more over there and we got left here it's getting about going home time i figure oh hallelujah hallelujah can you imagine right in that other dimension when the prophet was carried down beyond the curtain of time he said i looked right there in my body and it said it wasn't 20 foot from where it was right in another dimension not the way we'd measure it with the measuring tape that's dimensional travel that you move beyond see taste feel smell and hear and the prophet was in that sixth dimension looking back at his body on the bed and he said you mean i've got to go back into that think of it he was about 51 years old 51 years old probably pretty healthy at the time what would he say about the age that we're in if he would call that body that oh no it surely is a past house is it not i can't wait i don't know about you i can't wait to get rid of these gray hairs i can't wait to get rid of these wrinkles i can't wait to get to the river this old age and get on a body that'll never change it'll never die it will never rot and it will never be corrupt why do you have that confidence because that quickening power lives in me tonight it has quickened me to the word and it's still quickening me to the world and if i do wrong my intercessor lives within me and he lets me know [Applause] and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues closed captioning not or a available or a measurement or a numeric number there's always a significance there so i want you to notice where the judgment is coming from the tabernacle the witness it's not being administered by gangs it's not being administered by the mafia it's not being administered by cartels but by the holy pure sinless angels of almighty god now this staggers people because they don't understand god's justice is pure unlike ours anybody in here ever want to get revenge on somebody i'll close my house soon but tom you're going to admit to that lord have mercy dear god help our poor brother how many's ever got revenge [Applause] and no doubt we bore that revengeful look and we felt happy before we felt so bad but notice how god despice the openers of these plagues they're not cartel they're not foul corrupt their attire represents their position and their purity as administering this justice to god now this is important to god that god would convey this about this administration because many people read this and look at it as mean and hateful it is not mean at all you see if god would have chosen to give me holy justice if i had not accept his holy pardon in reality i would have nothing to say because i deserved it but i accept his pardon and by accepting his pardon it canceled out the justice that was against me [Applause] amen now watch so they're clothed in pure and white linen having their breasts which is up this part of the body the torso up here higher rather and having their breasts girded with golden girdle so this is an ephod sort of like the high priest war so it was a symbolism and they would have it around them up high kind of right down under their arms and down to about their waist so their white garments are pure and white flax and i've told you before that about this time frame egyptian linen was worth more than gold it was so pure that they say it would glisten people who walked in this egyptian linen would come from the river nile and the sun would shine on it it's like their garments would glisten they were so white which is a great symbol of purity so they were tired in the manner of clothes that was fitting to their position and so is the bride now watch in verse seven and one of the four beasts now watch they've been four beasts which was the four powers administering down through the church ages and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials or bowls seven golden vials full of the wrath of god now these folks that's on the earth not only have the devil that's come down and he's pretty upset but they have god administering vials of judgment notice now they are full so imagine in your mind one angel one two three four five six seven so one of the four beasts hands each angel a vial or a plague to turn loose on the inhabitants on the earth and the temple was filled with smoke but notice what from not from the sacrifice but from the glory shechena the shekinas which said from the glory of god you understand that this does not convey a an image of a god that's like some mean angry hateful guy and then we measure god's wrath by ours and we think how we lose our temper whatever we do that's not the way god is at all god is the only being who has wrath that is so holy god don't have to repent after he gets done whooping somebody you see god never loses his temper in the sense of having to come out i'm so sorry i shouldn't have said that you know i mean i i've already just lost my cool god has never lost his school one time and he is mr cool himself so he's been around before anybody else was and yet he's punished people he's done all kinds of things but he's never had to come back and be able to offer sacrifice but here the god wants us to see through the revelator that this judgment of god is justly given lord god and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple now wait a minute so this stuff is going on in the temple and the bride is having this great celebration at the marriage supper of the lamb well you say how in the world is that even possible well let's just say it like this so whenever you're at a wedding whether it's over here in the fellowship hall or the way sister haven brother josiah was out out in the place out there that was really nice all the art and the decor and all that stuff was out here where everybody was eating but back there in the kitchen people were hustling and they were doing this and doing that and picking up and you know doing all this stuff to keep everybody with this and that and the other and yet you're out there just smiling and eating your ice cream and your fried chicken and whatever morning you're just having the best time ever was and they're down there counting the time i'll be glad these people leave i'll be glad lord have mercy how much longer is until they get out of here and you're just out there smiling like you're having the best time ever was it's two different dimensions of the same occasion two different dimensions of the same occasion and you're the ones that's being catered to and you're being pampered and humored and you know can we get you anything else sir thank you sir do you think them people like you they're told to do that have a nice day can i get you anything else how many times they walk out there and they're matter and a hornet but they have to put that on or they lose their job so they got to go out there and yet you're the ones you're just sitting there oh man this is so much fun and you're having fun yeah i'm having so much yes i'm having so much fun i'm having so much fun and while the bride is there all this is going out and the smoke is coming out of the temple and the angels are coming out and they're dressed exactly for the time and the season and the bride is over there in another part of it and shooting him no nothing's going on reaching across the table and shaking one other's hands just eating and drinking and oh my we're not going anywhere nobody's getting tired nobody's looking at their watch no watches there brothers praise god and we're just sitting down and said wow how long we've been here hello how long have we been here i think it's been about 18 months really my goodness i ain't even had no dessert yet oh my god this is this is absolutely wonderful and everybody's smiling and everybody's young oh yeah i forgot to tell you all that you're invited to the largest the absolute largest young people's retreat that has ever been on the earth [Applause] there only be the god there'll be no old people there there'll be no babies there we'll all be the same age how many wants to go and yet here we are in another part of heaven we're out here where all this is going on the angels is just standing around and watching us look at her watch him have you ever seen him like this we thought that was something when he made that borealis we thought that was something when he made jupiter and the sun look at him have you ever seen him so happy have you ever seen him this way and the angel said back vote well really when you think about it i mean he's been there on the throne for two thousand years now taking care of her wouldn't you be glad she's home now we can love her now we can love honor she can love only him you know that we were made not to be angels we were made to be humans you've heard me tell you before that i walked into the recovery room with people that's had bypass surgery and all kinds of surgeries and sometimes i'd be the first one in there maybe the wife wasn't able to go if there's a brother and i'd go in and she said brother okay i just can't go with you guys sure sis i'll go oh my it can be traumatic sometimes now i'll be the first one that'll reach over and touch them maybe they're shaking and quivering i'll never forget over the fred mcginnis harry down in kentucky and he had heart surgery years and years ago and they didn't give the brother much of a chance of even surviving it sister mossy that was his wife and she just couldn't do a poor thing she's sitting out there just a crying and a ball and i can't do it i can't do it well you go outside i'm going sister i'll go and see him oh my i went in our brother fred had all them tubes down his mouth and this and that and the other but i started petting so brother fred this is brother donny just that human voice and that human touch of his shepherd helped bring him out of that place and that's just a man can you imagine what it'll be when the great master walks out brother joel and he takes his robe and wipes the tears from her eyes and says don't cry no more you made it you made it your home i mean we're just so happy and we're so free and and we're just so pleasant and all hell's breaking news down here don't you see it all depends on who you are and where you're at can i have a few moments and i heard a great voice revelation 16 1 out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vows of the wrath of god upon the earth and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell annoys some and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image i found this word overwhelming today worshiped to kiss like a dog licking his masters to kiss the hand towards one in token of reference holy father but instead of you kissing that hand god has let you kiss the son you see he said kiss the son in the book of psalms kiss the son lest he be angry with thee were it not for the grace of god brother larry we would be bowing down kissing the hat but instead we'll be bound down kissing the feet oh jesus oh jesus jesus i love you i've always wanted to see your face can i take a minute take all the time you need tony i heard your voice when i was a little boy you've dealt with me my whole life oh i knew your eyes would be wonderful i didn't know they would be that powerful your hair your feet your fingers thank you thank you for loving me and jesus might say donny thank you for loving me oh my thank you for giving me your life thank you for letting me use you i was saying you ain't got nothing to thank me for i'm just an unworthy servant he said but you see you and i are partners together i needed somebody to preach my word and you were living you were willing to forfeit whatever it took oh the lord lord honey don't look at me thank you i loved you donnie before you loved me i had you in my mind there's a little seed and i took a picture of you when you was at your best and while we're just enjoying all this the people on the earth are screaming hollering they're broke out and sores because they took on the mark of the beast catholicism and protestantism you see every person that's baptized in the titles of father son the holy ghost is baptized into the catholic church many of the protestants will never bow down to the pope's ring but they bowed down to the pope's doctrine i wish some of our protestant brothers would go back and just study a little bit historically and find out what some of these illegitimate popes have said down through the years about your bible they don't believe that a bible a bit more than you believe a funny book is the gospel then you'd take a cartoon book they do not believe god's word hallelujah notice let me close so they pour out the vial upon the earth and their fell annoys them which is wicked and grievous sore and where did this come from the tabernacle the temple and the tabernacle and the testimony having that come out of the house of god stored up wrath and why didn't that have your name on it because the container that come out of the house of god with your name on it salvation man which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image the meaning of this word on down let's look at the rest of it before we close in the new testament by kneeling or prostration to do homage to one make obeisance whether in order to express respect or to make supplication years and years ago brother george smith and i was down in mexico had a service in a little old church they wanted prayer people started coming up one after another after another the lord doing great things among them and it started with one woman one woman came up and bowed on her knee and took me by the hand and i felt like somebody had poured cold water all over me and i told brother george i said brother george tell them to stop and he said it's just respect i said it may be respect but i don't think it pleases the lord another come up another i told him i said tell them to stop just walk up before us and let us pray i wonder how many people bow to a man in the message people feel allegiance to this man or that man and let this man or that man talk them out of the will of god because they love a man more than they love jesus christ we owe obeisance to no man no worship to no man god's word is first [Applause] we'll pick it up lord one next sunday night but verse 3 says and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea now don't that word soul stumble you because it's the same word that is used in yesh the same word that is used for living being so it's the same word used as spirit so everything in the sea dies and the blood the sea turns into blood but not just blood with life but blood after the life has left it which is coagulated and turns black and it becomes clotted people here in the medical field no more better than i would but it's this blood representation of a dead man a dead earth a dead kingdom and while this is going on down here here you are still eating worshipping praising isn't it amazing but in one way when you think about it and you put it all together in a in a smaller way that's going on right now people have gathered on wednesday night for wednesday night service all different kinds of churches around here right some of them some of the women come to church and many skirts some of the men come to church and shorts and some of the women come to church and shorts and they come dressed like everything looking like everything no telling one little bit of something another that they'll get to try to sustain them and here we've come tonight and we've had a feast of god's word set right before us we've been called up for just a little bit out of our worries and our troubles and you know what i'm saying let me know i mean so we've just been called up for it for a little while into his presence and we feel like we can face any challenge we can do anything that lays before us this is only a pre-figure of what you're fixing to experience full time can you imagine full-time glory full-time presence full-time peace full-time anointing full-time shekinah won't that be us full time [Applause] think of it were it not for the grace of god to us when this vial is poured out we would be here the name on that sign down there could be whatever worship in the image it could be a catholic church i could be standing up here tonight as a priest whatever it is i said serving you the holy eucharist you can't imagine me it's a priest can you i can't either i can't imagine you as a catholic by the time you're way too noisy but why ain't we grace christ but you see friends god offers for people that's not even bride yeah he'll let him come and take of the water of life really as i've told you before a lot would have been a whole lot better off even though it wasn't abraham just stick around abraham you get some real good influence yeah you're better off to hang around and even if you know well if i don't believe about god i'm leaving i'm going out in the world i'd rather hang around abraham myself that way you might not might not wind up having incest with your two kids well praise the lord it's such a privilege just to hang around the people of god much less to be one henry wants to be ready with all of your heart praise the lord praise the lord lord jesus in humility and thanksgiving we bow our heads tonight in your presence thanking you praise god that what come out of the temple for us was not plagues bowls vials of wrath but a bloody lamb praise god brother branham said why john didn't see it because he had done look back in there but you were hit back in the eternities and john looked right at that great holy being sitting on the throne of god but christ the mystery of course was hid in the very heart of god and john looked when the elder said the line of the tribe of judah hath prevailed and here come walking this attribute and it left john puzzled he thought i've done a look through heaven i looked everywhere i looked around the throne how did i miss this but the heart of god opened up and you walked out praise god and when the heart of god opened up you walked out and we walked out with you for we are that love part of you oh jesus forgive us lord for our failures our mistakes cleanse us because we have an attorney tonight doesn't make us want to sin it makes us want to say keep us from sinning lord keep us from falling short of your glory we want to be like you jesus we don't want to take your grace and abuse it father to us it is so precious and we are so grateful spiritual death is in the land this natural death was the last plague that hit egypt so the prophet tells us spiritual death is the last plague that will hit the church and it's all around us lord god keep us alive i pray in the name of jesus keep us in our position our god-given position of christ in the word when we get discouraged encourage us when we get sick heal us when we get weary lift us up lord we love you tonight father we worship you jesus oh we bless your holy name oh we need to sing something harry that'll that'll be fitted for this occasion oh i know you may look at yourself tonight and you look at me and i've got on this tan colored suit and a light tan shirt and brown shoes and a black belt and you've got on blue jeans and blue shirt but if you could look past that tonight you're standing here dressed ruth in another garment he took away your garment of condemnation and he gave you a garment of praise he took away your filthy garments zechariah and he's clothed you as a priest of god for as long as he stood there with him filthy garments on satan was able to accuse him but the voice spoke out of heaven and said change his garments remove his garments and when the garments was changed the accusation stopped hallelujah so let us not raise our hands here tonight as sinners let us not approach god tonight as sinners as lost people unless of course you are if you're lost and of course come and we'll we'll pray with you and lead you to the lord but as children of god let's approach him as bride as the redeemed with that being our testimony i am redeemed i am redeemed i'm bought with a prize jesus has saved my whole life my soul my body he has fully brought me to this state of the last day i'm only waiting for the final stage of redemption the changing of the body praise god i wonder children if we're so close that the angels are standing outside the temple gate a wonder long as the lamb of course is in there they cannot go in vows and mercy cannot be mixed but i wonder if it's so close they're standing near and that great power one of the four beasts were discharged to them the plagues to be poured out i'll be that close praise oh brother dawn that scares me to death well get peace in your heart get the token applied to your life you ain't got nothing to worry about oh man wants to worship him just a little bit before we come can we take just a few minutes i know these kids are still on school break won't be long wednesday nights they'll be starting back to school again but let's just worship him a little bit while we can shall we oh praise the lord sing some for us praise the lord i've heard them say to do things right one must take their time reason or but when i think about my new life [Applause] the first thing that comes to my mind is [Music] his amazing grace i wanna thank me imagine millions upon millions can't you see him standing [Music] just waiting for more [Music] [Applause] presence i'll take a thousand years maybe two to thank him for his wonderful love [Applause] to behold his [Laughter] [Applause] to face of his amazing grace [Music] his throat [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] of his grace [Applause] oh me is his face gonna is him for [Music] praise the lord you wonder just how close it is when your pastor starts preaching about it and you see the things that's happening upon the earth fulfilling the scriptures and them fulfilling that part to spoken of them then you know there's a people on the earth that's fulfilling this part that's spoken amen can you we'll have to have a body change can you imagine that it's more real than this but we look to the unseen things for we do not understand with the eyes of our head but we understand with the eyes of our heart amen there's just something about going home i don't care where you're at brother brother david some brothers used to laugh at me and when the meetings was over i'd be throwing my stuff in a suitcase because there's just something about going home i feel the pool don't you friends and you know when you think about it the things we heard tonight we're going to be one place or the other that's right and i don't think we're hearing about it because he's telling us we're going to be there but i i think he's telling us this is where you belong and young people don't let the devil lie to you don't let the devil tell you you've sinned away your day of grace or
