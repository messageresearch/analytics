[21:01] [Music]
[21:05] foreign
[21:08] [Music]
[21:18] 103 starting at verse 1.
[21:22] very familiar scripture to us all and
[21:29] a Psalm of David
[21:33] it says bless the Lord O my soul
[21:36] and all that is within me bless His holy
[21:39] name
[21:40] bless the Lord O my soul
[21:43] and forgetting all all his benefits
[21:46] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[21:50] healeth all thy diseases how many
[21:54] diseases does he heal
[21:55] he heals them all
[21:57] also from Exodus 15 26 just a portion of
[22:00] that scripture says this for I am the
[22:02] Lord that healeth thee
[22:05] I am the Lord that healeth thee
[22:08] let's bow our heads
[22:11] father we just commit this evening into
[22:13] your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name
[22:16] God bless you may be seated
[22:19] now look I didn't come to preach to you
[22:20] tonight and give you a sermon so you can
[22:23] all relax I just want to come and they
[22:25] asked me to take just an evening to
[22:27] maybe just share some of the things that
[22:29] we've seen the Lord do how many of you
[22:31] sitting here tonight has ever been
[22:33] healed of the Lord anybody here ever
[22:34] been healed
[22:36] see look at all the hands so you see God
[22:38] is our healer he can heal cancer he can
[22:41] heal physical trouble mental trouble
[22:43] spiritual trouble whatever need would be
[22:45] there's not a situation that's greater
[22:47] than our God
[22:48] you know one of the things that stands
[22:50] out to me is not just healing because
[22:52] you can be healed you know and then you
[22:54] get sick again you can be healed of of a
[22:56] disease and end up getting that disease
[22:58] again we we know those things are true
[23:01] but what always touches my heart more
[23:03] than healing is conversions is to see
[23:06] someone give their heart to the Lord and
[23:09] one that stands out to me that I'll
[23:10] never forget was on the Apache Indian
[23:13] Reservation
[23:14] and we was preaching there one night
[23:17] and there was a an Indian just a typical
[23:20] Apache probably in his late 60s and he
[23:23] had a bandana around his head and hair
[23:25] done to his shoulders and just the the
[23:27] look of an Indian and his and he he came
[23:31] walking up the aisle and
[23:33] this arm was artificial
[23:35] it was missing and this lead was
[23:38] artificial so he didn't have no arm or
[23:40] no leg and he'd come walking up the
[23:42] aisle with this artificial arm and leg
[23:44] and when he got about where me and and
[23:46] Paul is
[23:48] I could smell the alcohol on him he was
[23:50] drinking
[23:51] and he walked up to me
[23:54] and I said buddy do you need something
[23:57] from the Lord
[24:00] and he just laid his head over on my
[24:02] shoulder and just began to cry like a
[24:04] baby he was just balling his tears was
[24:06] making my shirt wet
[24:08] and I looked at him and I thought poor
[24:10] fella
[24:11] he said they they took his land away
[24:13] from him put him out here on this
[24:15] reservation and he said he probably
[24:17] drafted him into the army and probably
[24:19] lost that arm and leg in Vietnam
[24:22] he told me he said I don't want to hate
[24:25] no more
[24:26] he said I'm tired of hating
[24:28] he said lead me to that Jesus that you
[24:30] preached about tonight and he was just
[24:32] weeping on my shoulder and we prayed
[24:35] with him
[24:37] well about a month later I called Kevin
[24:40] after the meetings of Brother David
[24:41] Siler I mean Brother David was in those
[24:42] meetings together down there
[24:45] and I called brother Kevin and we was
[24:47] talking I said hey how's my buddy doing
[24:48] talking about the gentleman that had
[24:50] come up
[24:51] and he said
[24:53] I said she's still going to church and
[24:54] he said well he did for a while brother
[24:56] Daryl but he quit
[24:57] and I said he quit
[25:00] I said why did he quit
[25:02] he said he took sick and died
[25:05] I said died
[25:07] he said he died brother Daryl said I
[25:10] went down to his family to pay my
[25:11] respects and so to me said Kevin
[25:15] said he died so peaceful
[25:17] I said all the bitterness and hatred was
[25:20] going out of his heart he said he died
[25:22] so peaceful and I said Kevin what
[25:24] happened to his arm and leg do you know
[25:25] what happened to it
[25:27] he said he lost it in Vietnam brother
[25:28] Daryl
[25:30] but I thought here's a man just three or
[25:32] four weeks away
[25:34] and all the years that he carried hate
[25:36] and bitterness in his heart
[25:38] and three or four weeks before he left
[25:40] the Earth
[25:42] he found Jesus
[25:44] and he died so peaceful
[25:47] another thing that just stands out
[25:49] before we look at some things is
[25:52] sister Rebecca Brandon Smith years ago
[25:55] when my mama was sick she gave me a
[25:58] piece of brother Brandon suit
[25:59] I've still got it and I've carried it
[26:02] with me a lot when I feel like I'm going
[26:04] to pray for the sick and different
[26:05] things
[26:06] and so there was a gentleman down in
[26:08] Arkansas and if I remember right his
[26:10] name was David King
[26:12] I believe that was the man's name and he
[26:14] had went to the doctor and he had a
[26:16] cancer between his sternum and his heart
[26:20] and so he asked if I had a prayer cloth
[26:23] that I could send him he a brother
[26:24] called me and I said sure I'll be glad
[26:26] to send himself just told me so they
[26:28] gave me his address
[26:30] well I'm going to be honest with you I I
[26:32] didn't want to send him
[26:35] the whole piece of brother bring him
[26:36] suit so I pulled a thread
[26:39] I'm telling you the truth I pulled a
[26:41] thread out of that put it in an envelope
[26:44] and sent it to the Man
[26:45] he got that thread it was just a thread
[26:48] off of that off of the suit
[26:50] put it on prayed he went back to the
[26:53] doctor
[26:54] was not one sign of Cancer
[26:57] completely healed
[27:00] there's just nothing that our God can't
[27:04] do
[27:05] you know the first time I ever remember
[27:07] experiencing the Lord
[27:10] I was about three-year-old
[27:13] and there was a guy my daddy was a tent
[27:15] boy for a guy by the name of Bobby
[27:16] Pruitt no kin to temper it in him
[27:19] and they was having tent meetings and my
[27:21] daddy he would they call him tent boys
[27:22] they would travel around and set up the
[27:24] tents and so that put the chairs up and
[27:26] all that when the meeting was over they
[27:27] tore it down so if I remember right out
[27:30] like I said I was only about
[27:31] three-year-old but I think it was down
[27:32] in Kingsport come a big rain and it got
[27:34] muddy and we was going into the tent for
[27:36] the service and I slipped in the mud and
[27:39] fell on the tent stop and broke this
[27:42] collarbone this one right here
[27:44] and I just remember parts of it because
[27:46] I was just a young boy but it's the
[27:47] first time I ever experienced the Lord
[27:50] and they took me into the tent because
[27:52] if you break your collarbone you can't
[27:53] raise your arm and so Bobby Pruitt
[27:55] prayed for me and I remember having mud
[27:58] and so he prayed for me and he had me to
[28:00] do jumping jacks and when the man prayed
[28:02] for me God instantly healed me of a
[28:05] broken collarbone
[28:06] and I just remember doing the Jumping
[28:08] Jacks and the people screaming and
[28:10] praising the Lord because this little
[28:12] boy had just been healed of a broken
[28:14] collarbone
[28:16] he's God
[28:17] he could do anything
[28:21] I gave my
[28:22] heart of the Lord when I got out of the
[28:24] army I was 21 year old
[28:26] down here in Jonesboro and I know many
[28:28] of you have heard me tell that I was in
[28:30] the old building down there by myself
[28:32] and so when I went back to school in
[28:34] January I went back to ETSU and
[28:36] everybody they just couldn't believe the
[28:38] change that it took place in my life
[28:40] because in December I was a pretty rough
[28:42] character in January I was a new person
[28:46] and so I started witnessing the people
[28:48] about the Lord
[28:49] and I remember one day that I was
[28:51] walking on the campus
[28:54] and I was just kind of down in my spirit
[28:56] and I was just talking to the Lord and I
[28:57] said Lord
[28:59] I said how are we ever going to get out
[29:01] of here
[29:02] you know sometimes you just get weary
[29:04] you know and I was you seem like you
[29:06] talk to people about the Lord and they
[29:08] didn't want to hear anything you had to
[29:10] say you know and I was just kind of down
[29:12] I said Lord how are we ever going to get
[29:13] out of here and I was just walking like
[29:16] that just talking to the Lord and
[29:17] something said look up and when I did
[29:19] there was a tractor and trailer went out
[29:21] in front of me and on the side of the
[29:22] tractor and trailer in big old letters
[29:24] was the word Grace
[29:27] yeah it's Grace we're going to get out
[29:30] of here by the grace of almighty God and
[29:33] you know God will be just as real to you
[29:35] as you'll let him be
[29:38] and so many times he speaks to us but
[29:40] sometimes we're so busy that we fail to
[29:43] hear his voice
[29:46] so I've been serving the lord and
[29:48] witnessing
[29:50] and it come on my heart to preach
[29:52] and I thought how in the world do you
[29:55] start preaching
[29:57] I didn't know how to start preaching so
[29:59] I was working at the VA in surgery I
[30:01] believe it was or maybe I was going to
[30:02] school for surgery at the time to be a
[30:04] surgical technician but anyhow I took
[30:07] off and I went to the riverbank down in
[30:09] Kingsport and I spent all day praying
[30:11] and I said Lord if you want me to preach
[30:14] if you'll open the door I'll walk in it
[30:16] but how do you start preaching I don't
[30:18] know how to start preaching
[30:20] so I come home that afternoon been out
[30:22] there on the riverbank praying and
[30:24] Cheryl said my wife you know Cheryl and
[30:26] she said brother Phillips he was the
[30:28] pastor before Brother Don he said
[30:29] brother Phillips called
[30:31] I want you to call him so I called
[30:33] brother Phillips and I said brother
[30:35] flips this brother darling I said Cheryl
[30:36] said you wanted me to call you he said
[30:38] yeah brother Daryl said I was praying
[30:39] today
[30:40] and said the Lord put on my heart to ask
[30:42] you if you'll take the service Wednesday
[30:44] night
[30:46] oh my Lord y'all should have been there
[30:48] it was the shortest message I ever
[30:49] preached in my life 15 minutes you you
[30:53] missed it
[30:54] now you get those errors in the half but
[30:57] it was 15 minutes and I spoke on what
[31:00] Jesus did for me he'll do the same for
[31:02] you and I just told him how the Lord
[31:04] touched my heart
[31:13] so I started preaching
[31:15] and the Lord spoke to me one evening and
[31:17] said when you turned 30
[31:19] you'll start traveling and I was working
[31:21] with the young people as young people's
[31:23] leader I was Joel's young people's
[31:25] leader and
[31:28] Jennifer's young people's leader and
[31:31] we had some great times used to get into
[31:33] my basement have prayer meetings and all
[31:34] my we just some good times working with
[31:37] the young people some of the menstruals
[31:39] talking the other day that we missed
[31:40] those days of when we used to work with
[31:42] the young people
[31:45] but now the Lord said when you turn 30
[31:46] you'll start traveling
[31:48] and when I turned 30 year old I was
[31:50] sitting in the old church and there's a
[31:52] man sitting about three rows up in front
[31:54] of me and I looked this way and how you
[31:55] looked around and see who's in church
[31:57] and what they're wearing
[31:59] y'all don't do that
[32:01] well there's an alder up here just come
[32:03] on up in a few minutes you can get it
[32:05] right
[32:06] as I was looking around you know seeing
[32:08] who was there and who was misbehaving
[32:10] and
[32:13] so I saw this man and I looked this way
[32:16] and I looked and I looked back that way
[32:17] and I come back around and when I looked
[32:18] at the back of this man's head a voice
[32:21] spoke to me and said join yourself to
[32:23] that man you'll speak for him
[32:25] so I go out and the best of you and was
[32:27] sitting there and this guy walked right
[32:28] up to me and he said I said brother
[32:30] Daryl said I'm brother Bill Anderson
[32:32] from down in Columbia South Carolina
[32:34] said I have a church in Beaufort and he
[32:36] said I was praying about an evangelist
[32:38] and he said the Lord put on my heart to
[32:39] ask you if you'll come and preach for me
[32:41] and I was going yeah
[32:44] yes sir yes sir
[32:46] and so that was when I started traveling
[32:49] started preaching
[32:51] and when I started traveling
[32:53] you know I joined the army to see the
[32:54] world
[32:56] and you know where I went North Carolina
[32:58] spent all four years of my military in
[33:01] North six hours from home
[33:03] and so when I started traveling you know
[33:05] going to Charlotte airport and Atlanta I
[33:08] didn't know anything about that stuff
[33:09] and it made me nervous I was just just a
[33:11] kid and I you know I just didn't know
[33:13] anything about that stuff and and so I
[33:15] was praying one night I was in my study
[33:18] praying and when I was praying the Lord
[33:20] spoke to me a scripture to my heart and
[33:22] I'll be honest with you I had no idea
[33:24] what the scripture said I just know the
[33:26] Lord spoke this scripture to me Psalms
[33:28] 121. and so when I got done praying I
[33:31] got up open up my Bible to Psalms 121
[33:33] verse 8 and this is what it said it said
[33:36] the Lord shall preserve thy going out
[33:38] and thy coming in from this time forward
[33:42] and forevermore
[33:43] I have traveled
[33:45] over 1.3 million miles preaching the
[33:48] gospel in a car
[33:50] I've got almost a million miles in an
[33:52] airplane
[33:53] but he's brought me home every time he's
[33:57] brought me home because God don't give
[33:59] you a promise that he don't keep if God
[34:02] promised you anything he'll keep that
[34:04] promise sometimes our friends will lie
[34:06] to us we know that
[34:09] sometimes the people closest to us will
[34:11] lie to us but he will never lie to us
[34:14] whatever God told you that's what he'll
[34:16] do he's been truth of that promise so I
[34:19] just want to share with you just a few
[34:20] things when you've had enough just raise
[34:22] your hand and we'll quit Okay because I
[34:24] don't want to preach to you but just
[34:25] just want to share some of these things
[34:26] that I've seen the Lord do and some of
[34:29] it I know you've probably heard me
[34:31] preaching so you've probably heard them
[34:32] before but just as I was thinking and
[34:34] trying to write down a few things but
[34:36] just want to share some things with you
[34:38] I want to look at the thinkings of of
[34:40] healings down in Mexico you know the the
[34:43] brother Branham said about the Spanish
[34:45] people he said the Spanish people get
[34:47] their healing because they humble
[34:49] themselves and they're willing to eat
[34:51] the crumbs
[34:53] and I've seen the Lord do so many things
[34:55] among the South American people because
[34:57] they're just a humble people you know
[34:59] you just tell them and they believe it
[35:00] and that's it you know they don't they
[35:01] don't have to figure it out reason it
[35:03] out and so I was some of the things that
[35:05] I've seen the Lord do I was down there
[35:06] among the Maya Indians and the Maya
[35:08] Indians don't they don't even speak
[35:10] Spanish they got their own language they
[35:11] got the Mayan language
[35:13] I saw I was down there and I was
[35:15] preaching in English and they was
[35:17] interpreted into Spanish and the Spanish
[35:19] was being interpreted into the Maya and
[35:21] they was giving it to the Maya people so
[35:22] I had two interpreters
[35:24] and so this woman came up for prayer and
[35:27] she spoke to me in Maya which I didn't
[35:30] understand the word she said and I
[35:31] turned to my interpreter banaya and he
[35:33] said brother I don't speak mine he said
[35:35] but I do know enough of it to know that
[35:37] she said something about her ears and I
[35:39] said okay well we'll just pray for her
[35:41] so I took my fingers and I stuck them in
[35:43] her ears like that and just prayed for
[35:44] her
[35:45] and when I did when we said amen she
[35:48] goes
[35:49] just like this and she turns around to
[35:51] her friend and grabs her friend and
[35:53] pushes her up there and I told her I
[35:55] said the Lord just healed her because
[35:57] you see when the Lord does something for
[35:58] you the first thing you want to do is
[36:00] tell somebody
[36:02] it makes you a witness and so she was
[36:04] witnessing of our healing of her healing
[36:07] no when I started preaching
[36:10] I've not shared this to just a few
[36:12] people but I want to share it with you
[36:14] tonight since you're my buddies
[36:17] I was in Virginia sitting on the front
[36:20] row
[36:21] my brother Charlie Spencer which is
[36:23] brother Ron Spencer's Daddy
[36:25] he said and the meetings up there went
[36:28] up brother Donnie was preaching we went
[36:29] up there to hear brother Donnie preach
[36:31] and he goes brother Ward do you sing
[36:35] I said no sir not a lick
[36:38] well when I said that everybody started
[36:40] laughing and I embarrassed myself
[36:43] and so I was sitting on the front row
[36:45] and I said Lord
[36:46] what have you called me to do
[36:49] had a voice spoke to my heart just as
[36:52] real as I'm talking to you and said I've
[36:54] called you to pray for my sick children
[36:58] and I've always tried to do that because
[37:00] I feel like that's what he wanted me to
[37:03] do
[37:06] as a brother said
[37:09] the Lord told him I was the pastor at
[37:10] church
[37:12] he said the Lord told him I was to be
[37:13] the pastor of this church
[37:15] and I thought well if the Lord told him
[37:19] then I'm supposed to pastor and I'm the
[37:21] one that's supposed to do it he should
[37:23] be able to tell me ain't that right
[37:25] especially if I'm the one that's
[37:26] supposed to do it but you know I said
[37:28] well I appreciate you so I prayed about
[37:29] it and I prayed earnestly about it for
[37:31] like three years I waited on the Lord to
[37:34] give me an answer
[37:35] and I was down in Kentucky
[37:37] now that brother Billy lasters
[37:39] you know who that is don't you buddy
[37:41] brother Billy lasters I was I was down
[37:43] there we was deer hunting with Joe
[37:44] Pewitt and them guys down there and I
[37:46] was in a tree stand and I said Lord
[37:47] those people deserve an answer if you'll
[37:50] tell me what to do I'll do it if you
[37:52] want me to take that church I'll take
[37:54] that church if you'll just tell me and
[37:56] while I was in the street stand a voice
[37:58] spoke to my heart and gave me two names
[38:00] and said you'll preach for these two
[38:02] brothers and by this you'll know you're
[38:04] to stay on the field
[38:06] well I come out of the woods and brother
[38:08] Billy Laster he's gone to Glory now he
[38:10] had killed a cow we had a big steak
[38:12] dinner
[38:13] and he invited all these brothers to
[38:15] come to this steak dinner
[38:17] well when I went to his house for this
[38:19] dinner
[38:20] those two brothers was at the house and
[38:22] both of them that night asked me to come
[38:24] and preach so I go back up to where the
[38:26] brother said that the Lord told him I
[38:28] was the pastor of the church and I took
[38:30] a message on the sons of God are led by
[38:32] the spirit of God and I told the people
[38:33] I can't take the church because the Lord
[38:36] told me to stay on the field as an
[38:38] evangelist
[38:40] down in Mexico in those meetings down
[38:43] there
[38:44] just as I got ready to read my scripture
[38:48] they decided that there's going to kill
[38:50] a pig
[38:52] to feed the people that week and just as
[38:55] I started reading over here was a
[38:59] girl in the world
[39:02] couldn't you wait till at least got done
[39:03] preaching so anyway we had pig that
[39:06] whole week that they killed right when
[39:08] the service started they decided to kill
[39:10] the pig
[39:11] but at the end of the service I went
[39:13] into the kitchen to thank the sisters
[39:15] for cooking all week for us
[39:17] and there was a sister there
[39:20] who had cancer
[39:23] and she was so sick but she had she was
[39:26] cooking
[39:27] and there's another sister there
[39:30] who wanted to have a baby
[39:32] and so we pray and asked the Lord
[39:36] to heal the sister with the cancer and
[39:39] to give this other sister a child
[39:40] because they had labored so hard for the
[39:42] young people
[39:44] well about two years later I was back
[39:46] down in Mexico again
[39:48] and I run into those two sisters and the
[39:51] one that had the cancer was completely
[39:53] healed
[39:55] and the other one had a little two about
[39:57] a year and a half something like that
[39:59] just a little baby was holding in her
[40:01] hands God honored both of them for
[40:03] working so hard for his young people
[40:09] remember the story of the diabetic ulcer
[40:12] you may remember that story
[40:15] I was in a meeting and I preached on the
[40:16] bride's checkbook and that the checkbook
[40:19] has already been signed and all you have
[40:20] to do is fill out what you have need of
[40:22] because it's already been signed by
[40:23] Jesus Christ you know brother bear
[40:24] preached about that and so I was
[40:26] preaching on the bride's checkbook well
[40:27] this man came up and I was at Walmart
[40:30] and I bought this watch for 10 bucks and
[40:33] sure said why are you buying a watch you
[40:34] got two or three of them I said I don't
[40:35] know it's just a good deal I just you
[40:37] know if it's a good deal buy it right
[40:39] so I took it with me and when I got down
[40:41] there I seen this man and I gave him the
[40:43] watch
[40:44] well the man that I gave the watch to he
[40:46] came up for prayer he pulled up his
[40:47] pants leg and he had an ulcer a diabetic
[40:50] ulcer they had eight I could see the
[40:52] bone through the wound in his leg
[40:55] and it was going to amputate his leg
[40:57] because of the the bone gets infected
[41:00] it's got to come off and so he came up
[41:01] for prayer
[41:03] and he said I want to write a check for
[41:05] the helium of my leg
[41:07] and so we prayed with him well about
[41:09] several months later I was back down in
[41:11] that part of Mexico again and he come
[41:13] running up to me and when he did he goes
[41:15] like this shows me the watch I still got
[41:17] it I said well praise the Lord
[41:19] and he pulled up his pants leg and that
[41:22] tumor of that that diabetic ulcer that
[41:25] ulcer that was on his leg was completely
[41:27] healed there was just a little dark spot
[41:31] where the ulcer had been
[41:33] completely healed and so he told him he
[41:37] goes back to the doctor and the doctor
[41:39] says tell us what you did
[41:41] and we'll tell the other people to do
[41:43] that because we have other people that
[41:44] were going to take their leg off because
[41:46] of diabetic ulcers said tell us what you
[41:48] did and we'll tell them to do that and
[41:50] he said I told him I wrote a check
[41:54] to the bank of Heaven
[41:57] God healed him of a diabetic ulcer
[42:02] healings of those on canes
[42:06] the brother if you'll put the picture up
[42:13] yep
[42:15] that's a good news
[42:21] anyway I was down in Missouri
[42:23] here a while back
[42:24] and this sister I think they'll put the
[42:26] picture up in a minute but
[42:28] this sister was on this on this walker
[42:32] and so I said sis have you ever thought
[42:34] about getting your hip fixed
[42:36] and she said they won't operate on me
[42:38] because I'm in stage four kidney failure
[42:41] I said kidney failure she said yeah they
[42:43] won't operate on me I said well let's
[42:45] just pray we wasn't even in church we
[42:47] was actually at a fellowship hall eaten
[42:50] and so I just sat down beside her and
[42:51] took her by the hand I said well let's
[42:52] just pray God will heal your of your
[42:55] kidneys and get you hip operated on
[42:57] well I was down in Oklahoma just a
[43:00] couple of months ago back in June
[43:02] preaching for brother Bryce Collins and
[43:03] the sister I've got the picture but I
[43:05] guess they can't get it up but the
[43:06] sister came up to me she said brother
[43:08] Daryl
[43:09] she said you remember me I said yeah she
[43:11] said I'm gonna get my hip fixed I said
[43:13] you are she said yeah she said you know
[43:15] brother I said I went to the doctor said
[43:17] they couldn't find nothing wrong with
[43:19] the kidneys and she said I just come
[43:21] from a six-month checkup because it was
[43:23] last year when we was there and she said
[43:24] I just come from the six month checkup
[43:26] and they told me they said your kidneys
[43:28] are so good we're going to take it off
[43:30] of your chart that you ever had kidney
[43:33] trouble
[43:37] Hallelujah so good that they took it off
[43:41] my chart yeah here's the sister right
[43:42] here you can see she's got the Walker
[43:45] she said it's so good they took it off
[43:47] the chart that I ever even had kidney
[43:51] trouble
[43:53] you remember the story of the sister in
[43:54] France anybody ever remember that alley
[43:57] you do I guess anybody else remember
[43:59] that story
[44:00] you do we won't tell it then anybody
[44:03] else
[44:04] don't remember it want me to tell it you
[44:06] don't want me to tell it you do want me
[44:07] to tell
[44:10] I ain't gonna tell it
[44:12] I'm just kidding I was in France
[44:14] and so I had preached this little
[44:16] message that the lord gave me on for the
[44:18] sake of one what God would do for one so
[44:21] because you see if he was the only young
[44:24] person ever lost he would went to
[44:26] Calvary for you that's that's how much
[44:28] he loves you if he was the only person
[44:30] in the history of humanity that was lost
[44:32] he would have went to Calvary for you if
[44:34] he was the only person in the history of
[44:37] all Humanity that was ever sick he would
[44:40] have took every stripe for your healing
[44:43] that's just how much he loves you so I
[44:45] took this thought for the sake of one
[44:46] and when the service was over this
[44:48] sister was sitting on the second row
[44:50] and she's on a cane her hair was real
[44:52] short big old earrings she had on pants
[44:55] and so I just stepped down off the
[44:57] platform I was actually leaving going
[44:58] out and I just stepped down and I went
[45:00] over where she was and she had her hand
[45:01] like this on her cane she's standing
[45:03] there and I just laid my hand on her
[45:05] hand and I said father I said this poor
[45:08] woman
[45:09] I said she don't understand the word I'm
[45:11] saying
[45:13] I don't speak French I barely speak
[45:15] English
[45:16] and I said this poor woman bit on this
[45:18] cane probably had a rough life and I
[45:20] said father if I can find favor I said
[45:23] take take her off this candy she can
[45:25] just enjoy the rest of her life without
[45:27] this cane so I just went on said amen
[45:31] and went on on the way home Brother
[45:32] David Myers he was the guy sitting up
[45:34] here on the platform with us during the
[45:35] dedication service on the way home
[45:37] Brother David said what what did you say
[45:39] to her so I told him what we said
[45:41] well the next morning she comes to
[45:43] church and she wants to testify
[45:45] and she said I got up this morning
[45:48] and I didn't need my cane
[45:51] the Lord took her off of the cane and I
[45:52] was there in February before the
[45:54] pandemic destroyed the world
[45:57] and I saw her and since that time she's
[46:00] repented been baptized in the name of
[46:02] Jesus Christ received the Holy Ghost she
[46:05] had on a skirt her hair was way down her
[46:07] back and she was vacuuming the church I
[46:09] said Lord have mercy every time I see
[46:11] you you're getting younger and younger
[46:13] she went from a cane to vacuuming the
[46:15] church
[46:16] because that's the kind of God that we
[46:19] serve and I was in Poland and I was
[46:22] leaving the meeting in Poland and
[46:23] there's a man standing there and he was
[46:25] on a walker and it reminded me of the
[46:27] sister in France and so I just went over
[46:29] I was on the way out I went over and
[46:31] never even spoke to the man I just laid
[46:33] my hand on his back and asked I said
[46:34] father
[46:35] you're the god that took that sister off
[46:37] the king there in France
[46:38] you can take this brother off a walker
[46:40] in Poland and just went on when I got
[46:43] home about three weeks later brother
[46:44] Robert Fisher sent me a text he said
[46:47] brother
[46:48] said that man you prayed for in Poland
[46:49] that was on that Walker
[46:51] I said yeah I said how did you know I'd
[46:53] done that because I didn't it wasn't a
[46:55] public show I just went out I said how
[46:57] did you know that he said because he
[46:58] contacted me and said he don't need his
[47:01] walker anymore
[47:04] that same God that done it in France
[47:06] done it in Poland and the same God had
[47:08] done it in Poland done it for my sister
[47:10] sitting right back there about two weeks
[47:12] ago I guess it was I was sitting over
[47:14] here and at the end of the service I
[47:16] felt led to go pray for her and I just
[47:17] got up went over sat down beside her
[47:21] and prayed for my sister
[47:23] and she came over at the house yesterday
[47:25] she's walking really good
[47:27] she's not been on her cane now for over
[47:29] two weeks because the same God that done
[47:31] it in France done it in Poland can do it
[47:34] in America
[47:36] he's God
[47:38] sister Vera Frost in Missouri
[47:42] where you at buddy I know

[48:06] around and Drug herself off just like
[48:08] she came up
[48:10] and the devil spoke to me and said see
[48:12] there she came up for help and you
[48:14] couldn't help her and I said I'm not the

[50:30] but if you put up that next picture
[50:32] all right good night
[50:37] I was in Ohio
[50:40] this sister came up with this thing
[50:43] hanging off of her head
[50:45] she wanted prayer and when I laid my
[50:49] hands on her head like this I just come
[50:50] up and it was just hanging off of this
[50:52] ear and I just and when I put it made me
[50:55] so sick
[50:56] I thought I was going to vomit it just
[50:58] made me sick at my stomach but that
[51:00] woman's Faith was so great I thought man
[51:03] we are going to have some church because
[51:04] this thing's fixing to follow up on the
[51:06] floor we're having some church tonight
[51:08] will
[51:09] I prayed for her she turned around
[51:11] walked off
[51:13] he was still there
[51:16] I couldn't understand it I thought it
[51:18] wasn't me it was her it was her faith
[51:20] brother Robbie it was so strong I
[51:22] thought why did that not fall off in the
[51:24] floor
[51:24] so I was talking to David Siler my buddy
[51:27] you know I was talking to David I said
[51:28] David I do not understand why that
[51:30] didn't it should have fell off in the
[51:32] floor
[51:33] well I guess the Lord heard me whining
[51:35] because I get a text from Brother Wayne
[51:37] Lawson said I'm up in Ohio and said
[51:38] there's a sister up here said do you
[51:40] know brother Darryl he said yeah I know
[51:41] brother Daryl she said will you text him
[51:43] and tell him
[51:44] that four days after he prayed for me I
[51:47] was walking through the house
[51:49] and the tumor fell off in the floor
[51:52] so the next picture Mikey
[52:02] you see sometimes it'll happen when you
[52:03] think it happened but it'll happen in
[52:06] God's time and when it happens in God's
[52:08] time it's always right on time so if you
[52:12] pray little brother Daryl I prayed
[52:13] nothing happened never doubt your
[52:16] ability to pray the greatest weapon
[52:18] placed in any of our hands is the weapon
[52:21] of prayer it's more powerful than an
[52:23] atomic bomb
[52:26] is that not true he gave Moses a stick
[52:29] he gave David a slingshot he gave Samson
[52:31] a Jawbone but he gave you the name of
[52:33] Jesus in prayer and when you hold that
[52:36] name in prayer every devil is subject to
[52:39] you they're under your feet
[52:43] look at your feet tonight
[52:46] we're the only preached on their feet
[52:48] last night you know when I was thinking
[52:49] when he preached on that no matter how
[52:51] ugly my feet is every Devil's still
[52:53] underneath my ugly feet oh
[52:56] well praise the Lord
[53:00] I was in Arizona Cottonwood Arizona
[53:03] his sister there had a tumor on her
[53:05] chest and she had been putting this side
[53:08] on it and so that night I was just doing
[53:10] like I'm doing right now I took a little
[53:11] thought on a witness of his majesty and
[53:13] was just sharing some of the things I
[53:15] seen the Lord do it was only just a
[53:16] Wednesday night service and she was she
[53:18] never came up for prayer she never asked
[53:21] for prayer she was just sitting in the
[53:22] service rejoicing over what the Lord did
[53:24] she goes home takes her blouse off to
[53:26] put some ointment on this tumor that was
[53:28] on her chest and it completely
[53:31] disappeared during the service no scar
[53:34] no scab no nothing it was completely
[53:37] gone she didn't even know what happened
[53:39] when she went took her blouse off to put
[53:41] ointment on it it was gone
[53:44] tumor disappeared during the service
[53:48] I was in Oklahoma there's a young girl
[53:51] there had a growth on the side of her
[53:52] leg and she came up for prayer and I
[53:54] told her I said when the Lord heals you
[53:56] you tell your pastor to let me know
[54:00] well she said as soon as the saints of
[54:02] God prayed for her she goes and checks
[54:04] and the tumor was half the size it was
[54:07] and three weeks later I get a text from
[54:09] her pastor and the sister said it was
[54:11] completely gone off her leg
[54:17] there's a sister Nicaragua had cancer
[54:19] and they wanted her to start her
[54:21] treatment right away but she said I want
[54:23] a brother to pray for me before I start
[54:25] my treatment so I was down there in
[54:28] January I've been to Nicaragua 15 times
[54:29] and I was down there in January and she
[54:31] came up for prayer and she told me she
[54:33] said I'm ate up with cancer they want to
[54:35] start treatment she said but I wouldn't
[54:36] let them start it until you prayed for
[54:38] me said will you pray for me I said yes

[54:42] the sister just kneeling at the altar
[54:44] she goes back to the doctor she's alive
[54:47] today not one sign of Cancer

[54:54] it's just that simple faith just that
[54:58] simple
[54:59] faith
[55:00] pieces of prayer cloth
[55:03] I shared the one about the thread off of
[55:06] brother Brennan's suit
[55:08] but a brother from down in
[55:10] Arizona sent me some prayer cloths that
[55:12] brother Benham had prayed over
[55:14] and so I was going down to brother I
[55:16] believe his brother Tim Pruitt's to
[55:17] preach and I just reached up I had him
[55:19] in a bowl and I reached up and grabbed a
[55:20] couple of them put them in my pocket

[55:23] know I'll get a chance maybe we pray for
[55:25] the sick we'll just take them with us
[55:27] and so I'll get to the room I go out to
[55:29] preach that night I just take these
[55:30] things I'd never even looked at them

[55:33] sister came up that was real heavy with
[55:34] child and she said brother Daryl she
[55:37] said
[55:38] she said I'm pregnant and I said

[55:46] said they tell me my baby's dead
[55:49] and she said I was wanting a girl said
[55:52] they tell me I'm going to have a boy but
[55:53] they tell me my baby's dead and she said

[56:08] it out of my hand and I just put it in
[56:09] her hand like this and prayed with her I
[56:11] said now when you have that baby and
[56:14] it's healthy you send that prayer cloth
[56:16] back to me as a testimony of what the
[56:18] Lord did for you well I was down there a
[56:20] few years later and this sister come up

[57:06] I got an envelope in the mail the other
[57:07] day from Canada and opened it up and in
[57:10] it was a handkerchief
[57:12] I said brother Daryl I'm completely
[57:14] healed said here's your handkerchief

[57:23] I give so many I give so many
[57:25] handkerchiefs away that's what my family
[57:27] buys me handkerchief for Christmas
[57:29] I think I'll start giving bicycles or
[57:31] something
[57:35] well this is being streamed ain't it oh
[57:37] I'm in trouble
[57:40] amen I just I just didn't want to preach
[57:43] to it and I just kind of wanted just to
[57:44] relax you know and just just witness to
[57:47] some of the things that we see the Lord
[57:49] do
[57:51] torn rotator cuffs and shoulder trouble
[57:56] I was down in Oklahoma this woman had
[57:58] tennis elbow and I was preaching a
[58:00] little message the lord gave me on the
[58:02] healer is passing by and at the end of
[58:04] the service this sister she's everybody
[58:06] was clapping their hands and singing and
[58:08] she started clapping her hands and when
[58:10] she did she started yelling
[58:12] I'm Healed and she said I couldn't do
[58:15] that and I'm doing that
[58:17] and as soon as she done that it's just
[58:19] like the door opened up and this one's
[58:21] got healed and that one got healed and
[58:22] that one got healed because she broke
[58:24] that barrier and when that barrier's
[58:26] broke you can step into whatever you
[58:28] have need of
[58:29] I was over in North Carolina Scott
[58:31] Smith's mother had a torn rotator cuff
[58:33] she couldn't raise her arm and right at
[58:36] the end of the service I think also in
[58:38] that same I think I was preaching that
[58:40] same message the healers passing by but
[58:42] in towards the end of that service the
[58:43] spirit Lord just kind of fell among the
[58:45] people well I turned the service over I
[58:47] went into the study and I was sitting in
[58:49] the study wiping the sweat off my face
[58:50] and all of a sudden I heard a roar out
[58:52] there and I thought what in the world
[58:54] and brother Scott come in he said
[58:55] brother Daryl I said God Tell My Mama of
[58:57] a torn rotator cuff says she's got both
[58:59] hands up praising God
[59:02] okay
[59:04] amen
[59:07] I would just oh there are just so many
[59:13] healings in the eyes
[59:16] the sister in Pennsylvania I know you
[59:18] heard me tell this many times sister
[59:19] Betty had glaucoma it's so bad that the
[59:23] lights of the church hurt her eyes she
[59:24] had to wear sunglasses sitting in church
[59:26] and so she came up for prayer and she
[59:29] said I gotta go see an eye specialist on
[59:31] Monday about my eyes and she said but
[59:32] would you pray and I said sure we'll
[59:34] pray so me and the Saints pray for
[59:36] sister Betty she goes back to the doctor
[59:38] on Monday the eye specialist and he
[59:40] examined her eyes and he told sister
[59:41] Betty he said whoever whoever sent you
[59:44] here needs their eyes examined he said
[59:46] there's nothing wrong with your eyes
[59:48] he healed her of glaucoma well I was
[59:50] sharing that testimony up in Oregon and
[59:52] a man sitting in the back with cataracts
[59:54] and he said Lord if you can heal sister
[59:56] Betty's eyes you can heal my eyes and
[59:58] the cataracts fell off of his eyes
[59:59] sitting at the back of the service he
[1:00:01] got up and testified I can see he said
[1:00:03] everything was real milky now it's clear
[1:00:07] so I was over in New York City brother
[1:00:08] Evan carrion and I was sharing what the
[1:00:10] Lord did for Jessica you know Jessica
[1:00:12] was blind and the doctor said she'd
[1:00:14] never see again but the Lord opened her
[1:00:16] eyes and now she sees better than me and
[1:00:18] so I was sharing the testimony of what
[1:00:19] the Lord did for Jessica and the man was
[1:00:22] down in Florida streaming the service
[1:00:24] and he I think he had glaucoma at his
[1:00:26] eyes but he stood up in the living room
[1:00:28] and said Lord if you could heal
[1:00:29] Jessica's eyes you can heal my eyes he
[1:00:31] goes back to the doctor gave him a clean
[1:00:34] bill of health on his eyes
[1:00:35] in that same service as a Drug Act was
[1:00:38] streaming the service and when I had the
[1:00:40] Saints lay hands on one another for
[1:00:41] prayer he stood up in his living room a
[1:00:43] drug addict and God delivered him of
[1:00:45] Meth
[1:00:52] that's the kind of God that we serve
[1:00:55] I was in Ohio preaching we had a just a
[1:00:58] prayer line developed didn't call for a
[1:00:59] prayer line it just kind of developed
[1:01:00] and so these people was coming up for
[1:01:02] prayer and so this sister came up and I
[1:01:04] said do you need something from the Lord
[1:01:05] and she said no I come to testify she
[1:01:08] said I was at home streaming and said
[1:01:10] the Lord Heal Me and she got in her car
[1:01:12] drove all the way to church came up to
[1:01:14] the Altar and testified over healing and
[1:01:17] then proceeded to shout the church down
[1:01:20] sitting at home watching the service and
[1:01:22] God healed her she said I didn't come
[1:01:26] for prayer I'd come to testify
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] I seen on the Facebook
[1:01:32] of this woman whose little boy
[1:01:35] had diagnosed with asthma six-year-old
[1:01:38] and they told her he was going to have
[1:01:40] to be on oxygen
[1:01:41] and she said I don't want my little boy
[1:01:43] to be on the oxygen I want him to play
[1:01:45] you know
[1:01:46] and that just kind of touched me I
[1:01:48] thought poor little fella so I just
[1:01:50] typed out a prayer I said father this
[1:01:53] little fella wants to just be normal and
[1:01:55] enjoy I said just take that up oxygen
[1:01:58] away from it you don't have to wear it
[1:02:00] and he can just be normal
[1:02:02] and I just
[1:02:04] Tapped Out The Prayer
[1:02:06] it's a little while
[1:02:07] I get a reply from this sister said
[1:02:09] thank you brother dial for praying for
[1:02:11] my little boy he said you prayed for my
[1:02:13] husband when he's a little boy down here
[1:02:14] in Arkansas and said God healed him of
[1:02:17] asthma and said if God healed him a
[1:02:19] basma I know he can take care of my
[1:02:20] little son so I was down in a meeting in
[1:02:23] Arkansas and this man and his boy come
[1:02:25] walking in to the to the study said you
[1:02:27] remember me and I said no sir I don't
[1:02:29] believe I do he said when I was a little
[1:02:31] boy said you prayed for me
[1:02:33] said the Lord Heal Me of asthma said
[1:02:35] this is my son that you prayed for on
[1:02:37] Facebook and he didn't have no oxygen
[1:02:42] amen
[1:02:46] heart disease
[1:02:48] that's down in Arkansas
[1:02:51] and a brother came up
[1:02:52] he grabbed me I heard bones I didn't
[1:02:55] even know I had pop
[1:02:57] he about killed me and he was he said
[1:03:00] brother I said two years ago when he was
[1:03:01] down here he said I had a heart disease
[1:03:06] I said they told me I was in heart
[1:03:08] failure head put me on all this medicine
[1:03:09] said I came up for prayer
[1:03:12] and he said I went back to the doctor
[1:03:13] brother Daryl and they said said your
[1:03:15] heart is so good he said they took me
[1:03:17] off all my heart mess and said I don't
[1:03:18] even take heart medicine anymore and he
[1:03:20] said I just wanted to come and thank you
[1:03:22] and I thought Lord
[1:03:24] handshake would have been good
[1:03:27] about squeeze the breath out of me
[1:03:29] but you remember Tony Burdette he was
[1:03:32] here during the dedication service he's
[1:03:34] talking about the Lord touching his
[1:03:35] heart
[1:03:36] I was in that service when that happened
[1:03:38] and brother Tony came up and he was
[1:03:40] telling me that the doctor said he
[1:03:42] couldn't live without that medicine but
[1:03:43] he wanted to trust God for his healing
[1:03:45] he said I'm not taking any more of it
[1:03:47] and I said well I'll agree with you
[1:03:48] brother Tony we'll just pray together
[1:03:50] and that's been however many years ago I
[1:03:52] don't know how long it's been but he's
[1:03:53] never took any more heart medicine and I
[1:03:55] was sharing it with him because up in
[1:03:57] Virginia there's a man came up I didn't
[1:03:59] even know where he even got the medicine
[1:04:00] but he had it in his hand like this and
[1:04:02] he said it on the on the platform like
[1:04:04] that and he said the doctor says if I
[1:04:06] don't take this I'm going to die he said
[1:04:07] but I'm giving it to Jesus
[1:04:10] it kind of made me a little bit nervous
[1:04:12] I thought well you know what this guy's
[1:04:14] just called up an emotion or something
[1:04:15] but I thought well you know if it's got
[1:04:17] that kind of faith I'm not going to I'm
[1:04:19] going to stand with him man never took
[1:04:21] another to the day he died he never took
[1:04:23] another pill for his heart
[1:04:24] so and I was telling that to brother
[1:04:26] Tony down in South Carolina about the
[1:04:28] man up in Virginia and brother Tony's
[1:04:30] testifying up here the other day you
[1:04:31] know he said brother Charles probably
[1:04:32] said it different places but the Lord
[1:04:34] healed brother Tony of heart disease I
[1:04:37] think it was an enlarged heart if i
[1:04:38] remember
[1:04:39] right
[1:04:41] skin diseases
[1:04:43] y'all getting tired you want me quit

[1:04:51] I had this stuff all over his arms is
[1:04:54] that the byc camp a few years ago
[1:04:57] and I come down off the platform and
[1:04:59] went back where he was and just laid
[1:05:00] hands on him prayed for him
[1:05:02] by the time he left the camp he didn't
[1:05:04] have a sign
[1:05:07] it was just the Lord took it right off
[1:05:09] of him I was in the backfield working
[1:05:10] Brother Richard tester called me he said
[1:05:13] brother Daryl
[1:05:14] he said my great grandson
[1:05:16] I told it wrong before I told it as his
[1:05:18] grandson it was actually I talked to him
[1:05:19] the other day and he was telling me it
[1:05:20] was actually his great grandson he had
[1:05:22] an incurable skin disease had been to
[1:05:25] four different doctors and every one of
[1:05:26] them said the boy will never be well he

[1:05:31] me said you got a rash from the top of
[1:05:32] his head to the soles of his feet
[1:05:34] and he said will you pray I said sure

[1:06:40] done preaching man I went over behind
[1:06:42] the organ and I set my Bible down like
[1:06:45] this
[1:06:46] because she was so hot I thought it was
[1:06:47] going to die I went down to the
[1:06:49] concession stand before the service I
[1:06:50] drank a whole quart of Gatorade
[1:06:52] took another one with me to the pulpit
[1:06:55] because it was so hot that night
[1:06:57] and I I was just dizzy and I went over
[1:06:59] behind and I set my Bible down like that
[1:07:02] when I did this girl was looking at me
[1:07:03] right in the face
[1:07:05] and a voice said pray for her
[1:07:07] so I looked up and I thought where is
[1:07:09] she at so I'll come back around the
[1:07:11] organ and I was just all these faces
[1:07:12] looking I thought where and I was
[1:07:14] looking trying to see her
[1:07:15] and when I was looking like that and she
[1:07:17] walked right up in front of me and stood
[1:07:19] right there in front of me and I told
[1:07:21] her I said sis God is my witness he told
[1:07:24] me right over there behind that organ to
[1:07:25] pray for you and she just melted into
[1:07:27] the carpet
[1:07:29] isn't it isn't he wonderful
[1:07:32] you know when Jessica was hurt real bad
[1:07:34] and
[1:07:36] we was in the hospital room that night
[1:07:38] and Cheryl was crying
[1:07:40] I was crying and you know Cheryl's Daddy
[1:07:43] was dead and little Rachel had been
[1:07:45] killed and
[1:07:47] sure said I've lost my daddy and I've
[1:07:49] lost my sister and she said if I lose my
[1:07:51] baby she said I'll just die
[1:07:53] and I knew that I just
[1:07:55] her heart was just broke and I just
[1:07:57] turned to the wall and I said Lord I
[1:07:59] said
[1:08:00] what are you doing
[1:08:01] I said you're taking everything away
[1:08:03] from me
[1:08:07] and I looked and I saw me and Cheryl and
[1:08:11] Jessica walk out on the platform at
[1:08:13] Happy Valley and Jessica had on the new
[1:08:15] dress and right before we came home from
[1:08:18] the hospital sister Becky Johnson came
[1:08:19] down and brought this new not doing
[1:08:22] anything brought this new dress
[1:08:24] and when we came out on the platform
[1:08:27] what I had saw weeks before in a
[1:08:30] hospital room become a reality when me
[1:08:33] and Cheryl and Jessica walked out on the
[1:08:36] platform and Jessica had on a new dress
[1:08:41] she
[1:08:42] thank you Lord
[1:08:45] thank you Lord
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:56] amen
[1:08:58] as a young girl
[1:09:02] I didn't pray for this girl but I was
[1:09:04] just there when it happened
[1:09:06] she was a cutter
[1:09:08] she had all these scars where she'd cut
[1:09:10] herself
[1:09:11] and in this meeting she wanted to
[1:09:13] Worship the Lord but she was kind of
[1:09:15] ashamed of the scars
[1:09:17] she said Lord I Want To Worship You and
[1:09:19] I believe I'm telling it right just
[1:09:21] remember if it's a thumb
[1:09:23] she said I want to worship you but I'm
[1:09:25] ashamed of these scars and said a boy
[1:09:27] said lift your arms and give me praise
[1:09:29] and when that young girl raised her arms
[1:09:31] to worship Jesus the scars disappeared
[1:09:35] off of her arms
[1:09:38] you got scars in your life
[1:09:40] he can take them away from you
[1:09:42] he can take them away from you
[1:09:45] amen

[1:10:04] me and Brother David solid was in this
[1:10:06] meeting together
[1:10:07] he's having a prayer line
[1:10:09] this man came through the prayer line
[1:10:11] like this right here this way this is
[1:10:13] the way he walked
[1:10:14] and when he'd go to shake your hand he'd
[1:10:16] have to look up like this and Shake Your
[1:10:17] Hand he'd been there all week in the
[1:10:19] meetings he was actually a preacher but
[1:10:21] he walked like that he couldn't raise up

[1:10:25] walked around like this right here and
[1:10:26] he'd look up at you and shake you he
[1:10:28] came through the prayer line
[1:10:30] and when that man got to the end of the
[1:10:32] prayer line he was standing straight up
[1:10:35] and he shouted that place to the ground
[1:10:39] and I tell you when you have walked like
[1:10:41] this for so many years and then God let

[1:13:23] out in the world
[1:13:28] I was in a prayer line and this sister
[1:13:30] came in I'll stop there
[1:13:35] but she came in and she said
[1:13:38] brother said I've got a son and we had
[1:13:42] it falling out
[1:13:44] said we've not spoke to each other in
[1:13:46] years
[1:13:47] I said I've got a little granddaughter
[1:13:48] that I've never seen
[1:13:51] because me and my son
[1:13:52] don't talk to one another
[1:13:54] and she said I'm getting old
[1:13:57] and she said I will just
[1:13:59] what a joy my granddaughter
[1:14:03] she said would you pray
[1:14:05] that God will reconcile my family so I
[1:14:08] can know my granddaughter
[1:14:11] I said sure says we'll just pray I said
[1:14:14] and when you
[1:14:16] family reconcile them I said you let me
[1:14:18] know what the Lord did for you
[1:14:21] I think it was two years
[1:14:24] I get a letter in the mail from a sister
[1:14:27] and she said brother Daryl
[1:14:28] she said my son's wife called me
[1:14:31] and invited me to my son's birthday
[1:14:33] party I think it's his 50th birthday or
[1:14:36] something like that
[1:14:37] said he invited me to the party
[1:14:39] she said I went there
[1:14:42] said I've been reconciled said I've met
[1:14:44] my granddaughter
[1:14:46] she said God is just so good
[1:14:50] well I was down
[1:14:52] preaching somewhere and I shared that
[1:14:54] testimony and a man came up with his
[1:14:55] wife at the end of the service
[1:14:57] he said brother I said I got a son we
[1:15:00] hadn't heard from him in years he said
[1:15:02] but if God can do that for that sister
[1:15:03] he can do it for my family he said would
[1:15:06] you pray that my family would be
[1:15:08] reconciled
[1:15:09] I said sure we'll just pray we'll just
[1:15:11] believe together and we prayed
[1:15:14] it was like on a Saturday night that
[1:15:16] Tuesday the following Tuesday his son
[1:15:19] called him they was reconciled the boy
[1:15:22] returned to Christ gave his heart back
[1:15:24] to the Lord and the last I heard he was
[1:15:27] leading singing in his daddy's Church
[1:15:32] it's just the kind of God
[1:15:34] that we serve
[1:15:36] and the last thing I want to share with
[1:15:38] you is
[1:15:39] Our God can raise the Dead
[1:15:44] I was in Pennsylvania
[1:15:46] it's been several years ago Andrew
[1:15:48] Glover was in the meeting with me
[1:15:50] and just as I read the scripture there's
[1:15:52] a guy sitting right over here about
[1:15:54] where the sister's sitting
[1:15:56] and he just goes
[1:15:58] like that
[1:16:00] and from the pulpit I could see the
[1:16:01] watch of his eyes
[1:16:03] his wife jumped up started screaming
[1:16:06] just hysterical just weeping you know
[1:16:09] just
[1:16:11] sitting right behind him was the pastor
[1:16:13] and behind him was a deacon they got up
[1:16:15] and he come and just put his arms on the
[1:16:17] because he was just slumped back like
[1:16:18] that he was just down and so he's just
[1:16:20] kind of holding him in the seat
[1:16:22] but nobody of course the wife I mean
[1:16:25] that's to be expected but the rest of
[1:16:26] the people they never kind of sitting
[1:16:28] like you are just kind of just sitting
[1:16:30] you know and they just started singing
[1:16:32] oh how I love Jesus or just just a soft
[1:16:34] song nobody got excited
[1:16:37] they didn't even call 9-1-1
[1:16:40] and they was just singing
[1:16:42] and so from where I was I could see the
[1:16:44] whites of his eyes
[1:16:45] and so we just prayed
[1:16:48] said everybody said just bow your head
[1:16:49] we'll just pray and we just prayed a
[1:16:52] prayer
[1:16:53] the Saints was praying the prayer and we
[1:16:55] said amen
[1:16:57] he was just laying like it he goes he
[1:16:59] goes just like this right here he goes
[1:17:04] and he just raised up he just go he was
[1:17:06] just like that and he goes
[1:17:08] that's it brother Jack you okay he said
[1:17:12] let's go buddy
[1:17:14] so we went on we had Church
[1:17:18] and remember just a few weeks ago right
[1:17:20] here in this Auditorium what the Lord
[1:17:22] did for sister Ruth Garland sitting
[1:17:24] right back there
[1:17:26] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:29] forever
[1:17:31] and the same God that saved that Apache
[1:17:34] is the same God that gave sister Ruth
[1:17:37] back to us is the same God who gave
[1:17:40] Jessica back to me is the same God who
[1:17:43] can meet every need that you have
[1:17:45] tonight
[1:17:46] that's just the kind of God that we
[1:17:49] serve and
[1:17:53] I've just seen him do so many things
[1:17:55] there's nothing that our God can't do
[1:17:59] and so now you've heard me now just for
[1:18:02] a few minutes I want to hear you does
[1:18:04] anybody here have a testimony
[1:18:06] because I know sometimes you have these
[1:18:08] meetings you know and and the preacher

[1:18:19] gonna be a long one
[1:18:21] oh my Lord
[1:18:26] I was waiting for you to ask
[1:18:34] um
[1:18:35] this has been four or five years ago a
[1:18:39] lot of you don't know this a lot of you
[1:18:40] don't know me that well I'm not from
[1:18:42] here some of you
[1:18:44] are closer to me than others but I I was
[1:18:47] a very very sick person
[1:18:50] for a large chunk of my life
[1:18:53] I'm gonna pull myself together a little
[1:18:55] bit
[1:18:56] um so I was diagnosed with what's called
[1:18:58] primary immune deficiency and for
[1:19:02] let's see
[1:19:05] I wasn't planning on talking so let me
[1:19:07] get the details right six or seven years
[1:19:10] of my life I I went once a month and got
[1:19:12] an infusion for four hours to help boost
[1:19:14] my immune system I was in and out of the
[1:19:16] hospital once a month once every three
[1:19:19] months for four or five years of my life
[1:19:22] um
[1:19:23] and you know and and it was just part I
[1:19:26] just accepted it you know I was like
[1:19:27] this is what I've got I'm gonna live
[1:19:29] like this forever
[1:19:30] and uh
[1:19:32] we were in Happy Valley
[1:19:34] um I had started coming down here and
[1:19:37] I think I mean I also been dating a year
[1:19:39] or so or maybe two years
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:44] brother Daryl was preaching and uh
[1:19:47] he said you know everyone
[1:19:49] he pulled the whole congregation to the
[1:19:51] altar everyone I mean we all some of you
[1:19:54] may remember but we were all up close
[1:19:57] and I just raised my hands I said Lord I
[1:19:59] don't want to live like this forever
[1:20:02] and and
[1:20:03] um
[1:20:04] and he touched me that day and I and I
[1:20:07] went I went back home I had to go to
[1:20:09] school
[1:20:10] and kept doing the infusion thing and
[1:20:14] when I came back down here I switched
[1:20:16] doctors
[1:20:17] and he uh
[1:20:19] you know I went to my doctor's
[1:20:21] appointment I told him my diagnosis I
[1:20:23] told him about my life and my history
[1:20:24] and he said well
[1:20:26] you know I don't let's just let's just
[1:20:28] take a month off and see how you do
[1:20:31] I said okay
[1:20:32] let's do that sure I was like this guy's
[1:20:34] crazy I'm gonna be sick I'm gonna be in
[1:20:35] the hospital I've been through this
[1:20:37] we've tried this my whole life you know
[1:20:38] I know and it's been
[1:20:43] three or four years now not a single one
[1:20:45] haven't been in the hospital a single
[1:20:47] time lord touched me and my life has
[1:20:49] been forever changed and I'm I'm up here
[1:20:51] now
[1:20:52] and I was thinking about this the whole
[1:20:55] time he was talking
[1:20:57] I've never told my family knows and a
[1:21:01] few of my close friends but I've been
[1:21:02] scared to testify
[1:21:04] because you know you get up and you
[1:21:06] testify and the devil starts coming at
[1:21:08] you and I've been scared this whole time
[1:21:10] so I'm not going to say anything
[1:21:12] because I'm scared I'm scared that the
[1:21:14] devil come after me and
[1:21:16] and uh you know I haven't told Daryl to
[1:21:19] tell that he knows it but I'm here
[1:21:21] tonight to give him a black eye and tell
[1:21:23] him that if the Lord's done something
[1:21:24] for you
[1:21:26] you need to tell it and you need to
[1:21:27] testify and I'm ashamed of waiting this
[1:21:30] long to get up and tell people but he's
[1:21:32] a Healer he's my healer and he has been
[1:21:34] and he's changed my life forever
[1:21:43] anyone else
[1:21:45] come on up here little brother
[1:21:47] God bless you
[1:21:49] appreciate you
[1:21:51] uh also was not planning on talking so
[1:21:53] if things get you know
[1:21:56] confusing man
[1:22:00] uh some of you may know this
[1:22:03] um I haven't been very secretive about
[1:22:05] it necessarily but I also don't
[1:22:08] I don't throw it out there for many
[1:22:10] people to know because whenever you
[1:22:11] start opening yourself up to people you
[1:22:13] know to the wrong people you can you can
[1:22:15] get hurt uh about two three years ago I
[1:22:19] struggled with horrible horrible
[1:22:22] just mental battles just depression
[1:22:24] anxiety just literally anything and
[1:22:27] everything you could think of
[1:22:29] um
[1:22:29] and during that time I mean I'm sure
[1:22:31] people Knew by I mean the way I acted or
[1:22:34] the way I was you know presenting myself
[1:22:36] or whatever but it wasn't
[1:22:38] like a communicative thing like people
[1:22:40] didn't know brother Daryl knew dad dad
[1:22:41] had to talk to him about it
[1:22:44] brother Daryl um gave dad a
[1:22:47] uh a prayer cloth and I I didn't know
[1:22:50] that he had given given to the prayer
[1:22:52] cloth and dad had pinned it on my bed
[1:22:54] underneath my my bed sheet and even
[1:22:57] before then I talked about it Aaron he'd
[1:22:59] given me one of his one of his his
[1:23:01] handkerchiefs to bring it back to me
[1:23:03] whenever you're healed
[1:23:05] um well I hung on to it for a while you
[1:23:06] know and then you know you have moments
[1:23:09] in church you have you know experiences
[1:23:10] and I was like oh for sure I felt how I
[1:23:13] was broken you know I'd broken through
[1:23:14] and part of me feels like I had but I
[1:23:17] let the devil
[1:23:18] get to me again and I just got defeated
[1:23:21] but in that time I came back to the
[1:23:23] other day I was like you know here's
[1:23:25] your handkerchief I've been delivered he
[1:23:26] was like hang on to it and I was part of
[1:23:29] me was like okay wonder wonder why he
[1:23:31] did that he was like you know
[1:23:33] if if the dev over comes back you can
[1:23:35] have that as a testimony
[1:23:37] and you know in my head I was like well
[1:23:38] I wouldn't need it for that I feel like
[1:23:39] I'm delivered well came back harder than
[1:23:42] ever which you know I'm not going to get
[1:23:44] into all the all the all the Gory
[1:23:46] details but it got bad and then I
[1:23:49] realized why I still had that
[1:23:50] handkerchief and why why he told me to
[1:23:52] hang on to it
[1:23:54] um
[1:23:55] then Virginia meetings rolled around is
[1:23:58] 20 20.
[1:24:01] 2021 I think
[1:24:02] and I've been praying that whole that
[1:24:05] whole time I didn't want to go to those
[1:24:06] meetings I was just like uh you know I
[1:24:08] was caught up in stuff School whatever
[1:24:11] um
[1:24:12] but Saturday night we had that prayer
[1:24:14] line and
[1:24:16] never in my life have I experienced
[1:24:17] anything like that the the spirit that
[1:24:20] dropped down there in those meetings was
[1:24:24] you could almost see it you could feel
[1:24:25] it it was a a pressure it was it was
[1:24:28] awesome and I came out that prayer line
[1:24:30] and
[1:24:32] you know because the the tent's out in
[1:24:33] the middle of a field there was you know
[1:24:34] people all around people that came out
[1:24:36] to prayer line everybody was praying
[1:24:37] everybody was you know just just
[1:24:39] worshiping and they they put me down on
[1:24:42] a chair and I was I was just sitting
[1:24:43] there and I was praying I was thinking I
[1:24:45] don't feel nothing I don't feel any
[1:24:46] different I don't
[1:24:47] because whenever you get in a state like
[1:24:49] that
[1:24:50] without knowing it consciously you
[1:24:52] worship that demon that's that's held on
[1:24:54] to your life because you start thinking
[1:24:56] who am I without this because it becomes
[1:24:58] your identity and I didn't realize I was
[1:25:01] hanging on to it and I was I was sitting
[1:25:03] there
[1:25:04] and a voice spoke to me and it was like
[1:25:06] do you want to be healed
[1:25:09] and in my head I was like I mean I
[1:25:11] thought I was well what
[1:25:14] it was all it was all a mess everything
[1:25:16] was because two worlds were meeting in
[1:25:18] that moment and that darkness that had
[1:25:20] been in my life for
[1:25:22] years since I was 12 years old 11 years
[1:25:24] old it was it was clashing and I was I
[1:25:26] was all confused and the voice said
[1:25:30] you're healed say it
[1:25:32] and I whispered and I was like I'm
[1:25:33] Healed nothing happened I said I'm
[1:25:36] Healed and then I yelled out I'm Healed
[1:25:38] and the second I said that I physically
[1:25:40] felt it break I felt it break off my
[1:25:43] body
[1:25:44] um I've never been the same since ever
[1:25:47] it never been the same never struggled
[1:25:51] with any any thoughts like that I became
[1:25:53] a totally a totally new person and that
[1:25:55] that handkerchiefs that brother Dale
[1:25:57] gave me anytime the Lord does something
[1:25:58] for me in my life I write it down on
[1:26:00] that on the handkerchief and I put the
[1:26:02] date beside it and a year later at the
[1:26:04] same meetings I got the Holy Ghost so
[1:26:07] that's my testimony
[1:26:14] praise the Lord
[1:26:16] you know brother Jonas Hildebrand up in
[1:26:18] Canada he had so many sinus infections
[1:26:20] they had so many surgeries they cut the
[1:26:22] nerves out of his couldn't smell so he
[1:26:25] came through a prayer line up here it's
[1:26:26] February 20 I believe it was and I gave
[1:26:28] him a handkerchief and I said when the
[1:26:30] Lord heals you you send it back to me
[1:26:31] it's a testimony of what the Lord did
[1:26:33] for you I've just seen the Lord use that
[1:26:34] so many times well I was in a hotel room
[1:26:36] and I was in bed and my phone goes
[1:26:40] so I looked at it and it was brother
[1:26:42] Jonas he said are you asleep
[1:26:45] I said no
[1:26:47] not now so I said can I call you I said
[1:26:50] sure sure so he called me said well
[1:26:52] Daryl he said I don't know where you're
[1:26:54] at don't even know what time it is where
[1:26:55] you're at he said but I was coming home
[1:26:57] from church tonight he said guess what I
[1:26:58] said what buddy he said I smell the
[1:27:00] skunk
[1:27:04] I believe that's right when the Lord
[1:27:06] touches you even the skunk smells good
[1:27:10] I remember another time a prayer cloth I
[1:27:12] was in Virginia and this sister came
[1:27:13] through the prayer line and she said I
[1:27:16] don't I'm tired of going to church by
[1:27:18] myself said my husband won't come to
[1:27:19] church with me and I said will you take
[1:27:21] his handkerchief you put it under the
[1:27:22] mattress with inside he sleeps on and
[1:27:24] when he starts coming to church you send
[1:27:27] it back to me and so several years later
[1:27:29] I was up there and she come up to me
[1:27:30] with that handkerchief and she said I'm
[1:27:32] going to give this back to you said I
[1:27:33] said yeah I remember
[1:27:35] she said oh there's my husband I said
[1:27:38] not only is he coming to church and now
[1:27:40] he's a deacon in the church
[1:27:42] just the kind of God that we serve he's
[1:27:45] just he's just wonderful I was in
[1:27:46] Nicaragua one time and I was too
[1:27:48] handkerchief and tore it off and give it
[1:27:50] to the kids piece of it and I said when
[1:27:52] the Lord heals you you give it to Mike
[1:27:53] sieber to send back to me and you know I
[1:27:55] knew they wouldn't send it back to me
[1:27:56] but it's just something that for your
[1:27:58] faith to Anchor you know and so I was
[1:28:00] turning it off giving it to him he's
[1:28:01] coming through the prayer line and oh
[1:28:03] man we prayed for so many and before the
[1:28:05] prayer line was over the kids that was
[1:28:07] in the front of the line had got back in
[1:28:09] the line and was giving me pieces of the
[1:28:10] handkerchief back the Lord had already
[1:28:12] healed them before they ever left the
[1:28:14] building and that same service that
[1:28:15] night I was coming out they was helping
[1:28:17] me out of the building I'll never forget
[1:28:19] this I was talking about salvation but
[1:28:20] there's a young guy he wasn't even a
[1:28:22] part of he's actually part of the camp
[1:28:23] he worked there he wasn't part of our
[1:28:25] young people and he was standing at the
[1:28:27] back door and I was going on and I just
[1:28:29] looked at him he's looking at me and I
[1:28:30] said do you need something from Jesus
[1:28:33] he's just he just fell on his knees and
[1:28:37] repented
[1:28:38] and gave his heart to the Lord and his
[1:28:40] girlfriend was also there and she went
[1:28:42] to the altar that night and the Lord
[1:28:43] saved both of them in that meeting that
[1:28:45] night and he's just wonderful
[1:28:48] I didn't mean to get emotional but it
[1:28:49] just touches my heart anybody else
[1:28:56] come on up here sis
[1:29:04] to bear with me I'm gonna cry
[1:29:08] um
[1:29:11] I
[1:29:12] maybe start of the year
[1:29:17] I dealt with a lot of anxiety and
[1:29:18] depression
[1:29:20] and it wouldn't go away
[1:29:23] I tried to go to church
[1:29:26] and I went up for prayer many times and
[1:29:29] nothing happened
[1:29:31] so
[1:29:34] in Louisiana camp this year
[1:29:37] my I I was really searching for the Holy
[1:29:41] Ghost and I wanted it so bad
[1:29:43] and I kept praying and praying and
[1:29:46] praying and I received it
[1:29:48] and
[1:29:50] I got back home
[1:29:53] and Satan
[1:29:55] blinded me so much that
[1:29:58] I didn't I didn't even think I had any
[1:30:01] more
[1:30:02] and I was blind
[1:30:06] um
[1:30:07] whether Andrew Spencer when he came for
[1:30:10] our meetings
[1:30:14] preached and he said
[1:30:16] and if you have if you know you had the
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost
[1:30:19] and I didn't know I sat there and I was
[1:30:22] like do I stand or do I sit down
[1:30:25] and he was praying for people it took me
[1:30:27] a long time to come up here and get
[1:30:30] prayed for and I finally I finally did
[1:30:33] it
[1:30:36] told them and I said
[1:30:39] I don't I don't know I received it
[1:30:43] at Louisiana and I don't know if I have
[1:30:46] it I really don't and he looked at me
[1:30:49] and he said
[1:30:50] I can see it all over use this
[1:30:53] and that's when I knew and now
[1:30:56] I feel
[1:30:58] nothing defeat me or God and now that I
[1:31:04] know that I have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:11] thank you
[1:31:13] there's nothing like knowing that you
[1:31:15] know that you know amen anybody else
[1:31:23] this is your chance
[1:31:25] some of you've been wanting to preach
[1:31:26] this is yours
[1:31:32] I knew it come on up here buddy praise
[1:31:35] the Lord
[1:31:39] that's the way I'm going to look in the
[1:31:40] Millennium right there
[1:31:44] it's just something small
[1:31:46] um
[1:31:47] I think it was
[1:31:49] like form four or three months ago I had
[1:31:52] pain on my right side and um like right
[1:31:56] here I would push down and I was like oh
[1:31:59] what what is this like every time I bend
[1:32:00] over at work it would hurt and I'd be
[1:32:02] like oh man like I really don't want to
[1:32:03] go doctor you know I don't want to find
[1:32:05] out you know I have liver problems or
[1:32:07] something so I just kept putting it off
[1:32:09] putting it off and I kept praying and
[1:32:11] claiming my healing and then we have the
[1:32:14] special meetings
[1:32:15] and I
[1:32:18] went up to get prayed for and I was like
[1:32:21] Lord please take this away I don't
[1:32:23] I don't want I don't want to have this
[1:32:24] pain you know I don't want to know what
[1:32:26] it is I was actually pretty scared and
[1:32:30] then
[1:32:31] weeks passed by and before I knew it I
[1:32:35] totally forgot about it and then when we
[1:32:37] were you were pre you were talking and
[1:32:41] um
[1:32:42] talking about the testimonies and the
[1:32:44] healing I just reached over I was like
[1:32:45] you know what I didn't
[1:32:47] I haven't really felt it in a while and
[1:32:49] it doesn't hurt no more and after mark
[1:32:52] telling his testimony just so I was like
[1:32:53] you know I wasn't planned on speaking so
[1:32:55] but you know it just encourages just to
[1:32:58] let you know if when someone else has
[1:33:00] testimony it encourages you encourage me
[1:33:03] and I'm sure it's encouraged a lot of a
[1:33:05] lot of YouTube so so praise God for
[1:33:07] healing and just yeah amen
[1:33:10] [Applause]
[1:33:17] it's wonderful what the Lord can do in
[1:33:19] it
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:25] come on up here sister from Canada
[1:33:32] so this isn't my testimony but I'm
[1:33:35] sharing it because I need it
[1:33:38] um but last year at our church camp
[1:33:41] um we had a testimony night at the end
[1:33:43] of the service and one of my friends
[1:33:44] she's had stomach issues for as long as
[1:33:47] I've known her
[1:33:48] um gluten dairy nothing like and she
[1:33:51] always had a struggle with it you know
[1:33:52] come to Youth and she had to have her
[1:33:54] special meals and
[1:33:56] and it was the last night of camp and
[1:33:58] God moved in such a special way of that
[1:34:00] camp but I remember I was up there and
[1:34:02] praying with some of the young girls and
[1:34:05] and she came and she came up and got
[1:34:07] prayed for and and she turned to me and
[1:34:09] everybody else was you know and having
[1:34:12] their moments and she turned to me and
[1:34:13] she goes Chloe I'm Healed
[1:34:15] and it was like I looked at her and I
[1:34:18] knew I knew she was healed and and we
[1:34:20] were so encouraged by it and the next
[1:34:22] morning
[1:34:23] we went and I was the only one me and
[1:34:25] her were the only ones that knew what
[1:34:27] had happened and we went for breakfast
[1:34:29] and
[1:34:30] um right as we're in the line a girl one
[1:34:34] another one of her friends comes up to
[1:34:35] her and she goes I had a dream last
[1:34:37] night and
[1:34:38] and my dream you ate a sack of Pancakes
[1:34:41] and you were fine and that breakfast
[1:34:44] that morning was pancakes and she went
[1:34:47] and she took a full stack and some
[1:34:48] friends told her you know maybe you
[1:34:49] should try just one pancake and see how
[1:34:51] you feel and she said nope God healed me
[1:34:53] and she ate the whole stack the biggest
[1:34:56] stock I've ever seen and I know I I have
[1:34:59] a lot of stomach issues and it's been
[1:35:01] something that I've been struggling a
[1:35:02] lot especially since being down here
[1:35:05] um and I know that if God did it for her
[1:35:07] he can do it for me so I'm just claiming
[1:35:09] it here
[1:35:16] here a few years ago I was up at the byc
[1:35:18] camp and we had prayed for so many kids
[1:35:21] and I was going up the aisle leaving
[1:35:23] just really tired and and this girl
[1:35:27] stepped out and she said I'm uh bulimic
[1:35:30] is that where you eat your food and
[1:35:32] throw it back up is that
[1:35:34] she said I'm I'm a bulimic she said I
[1:35:38] won't I don't want to be like that no
[1:35:39] more so we prayed and I told her I
[1:35:41] thought about that when she said that I
[1:35:43] told her I said sis I said now go get
[1:35:44] you a hamburger and eat it
[1:35:47] well when I got back to the room
[1:35:49] kind of come to myself a little bit you
[1:35:51] know I thought kind of scared me bro
[1:35:53] Paul because I thought wow maybe you
[1:35:55] know maybe this girl maybe she's not had
[1:35:57] food on her stomach because she throwed
[1:35:58] it up for so long maybe I maybe she
[1:36:00] should have had soup first or something
[1:36:01] you know I I thought oh Lord have mercy
[1:36:04] I hope I hadn't told that girl something
[1:36:05] something wrong you know and she and so
[1:36:07] all that night I just I was just praying
[1:36:09] I said Lord you know Lord I just was
[1:36:11] trying to be a help you know and so the
[1:36:14] next morning when we went for breakfast
[1:36:16] I was looking for her make sure
[1:36:18] make sure she's alive you know and so I
[1:36:22] saw her and she come running up to me
[1:36:23] and I said how you doing sis she said
[1:36:25] bro Daryl said not only did I eat one
[1:36:27] hamburger she said I ate two I said well
[1:36:30] praise the Lord for two hamburgers but
[1:36:32] that you're right when the Lord heals
[1:36:34] you you don't have to have one pancake
[1:36:35] you can have them all amen amen God is
[1:36:39] so good
[1:36:41] anybody else said it's getting late one
[1:36:43] time we need to come
[1:36:48] on up here sis
[1:37:01] probably like so many of you all one of
[1:37:04] my biggest troubles in life has been
[1:37:05] depression and anxiety and
[1:37:10] one of the biggest things that I've
[1:37:11] thought is always that nobody cares
[1:37:14] about me and I could just
[1:37:16] disappear tomorrow and
[1:37:19] why would it matter
[1:37:20] and it created a lot of bitterness in me
[1:37:23] and a lot of hatred towards people for
[1:37:25] many many years
[1:37:27] and
[1:37:28] just a few months ago I can remember it
[1:37:30] was it was really bad for me and I was
[1:37:33] sitting here in church and I
[1:37:35] saw somebody else come up and get prayed
[1:37:37] for and she had you know a moment with
[1:37:39] the Lord and when she did I just saw
[1:37:41] all these group of ladies go and pray
[1:37:44] for and I I leaned over to somebody and
[1:37:47] I said
[1:37:48] you know if that happened to me nobody
[1:37:50] nobody would come pray for me nobody
[1:37:53] would care
[1:37:54] and just a few weeks later I went up for
[1:37:57] prayer and um
[1:37:58] the Lord really moved for me in a way he
[1:38:00] never had before and as I know
[1:38:02] at the altar of just crying and praying
[1:38:04] I felt the hand on my back and then I
[1:38:07] felt another one
[1:38:08] and another one and another one
[1:38:11] and I realized a group of girls said
[1:38:13] I'll come and they had prayed for me
[1:38:16] and it made me realize people to care
[1:38:18] about me and I walked up and I haven't
[1:38:21] felt that bitterness or that hatred
[1:38:23] toward people anymore
[1:38:24] I just love all of you and I'm just so
[1:38:26] blessed to be a part just thank you all
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:37] you know one thing I learned if you're
[1:38:39] if you ever felt led to pray for someone
[1:38:43] you should go do that
[1:38:45] because you know program talked about
[1:38:47] the mother who had the child and she
[1:38:50] didn't have a seat and this woman got up
[1:38:52] to give her her seat and she just felt
[1:38:54] compelled to pray for the baby but she
[1:38:56] thought you know the woman to get a
[1:38:57] prayer card and brother Brennan will
[1:38:59] pray for the baby and God will heal it
[1:39:00] and but she could not get that up so she
[1:39:02] asked she said do you mind if I pray for
[1:39:04] your child and she said well sure so she
[1:39:06] prayed and so she went up in the balcony
[1:39:08] and sat down and so sure enough that
[1:39:10] woman got a prayer card she got called
[1:39:11] come to the platform with that baby and
[1:39:14] the brother Brennan went to pray for the
[1:39:15] baby and he said the baby's already
[1:39:17] healed he said the woman up there in the
[1:39:19] balcony and the planted dress prayed for
[1:39:21] the baby and brother Brennan went on to
[1:39:23] say he said her being a mother could
[1:39:25] have more compassion on that child than
[1:39:27] I could and so you realize here's to the
[1:39:30] prophet of God with the ability to
[1:39:31] discern but God never used him to pray
[1:39:34] for that baby he used that woman and so
[1:39:37] and that's something I've always tried
[1:39:39] to do is be if I feel led to go pray for
[1:39:41] somebody and and just go pray for him
[1:39:43] and I don't know how many times that
[1:39:45] people people's told me said I was
[1:39:46] sitting here praying they said Lord if
[1:39:48] you can hear my prayer let brother Daryl
[1:39:49] come and pray for me and you know and so
[1:39:52] if you I just want to encourage you
[1:39:53] because we need one another's brother
[1:39:55] Donny preached last night we're a body
[1:39:56] it reminds me of a story during World
[1:39:59] War II and the Americans have been
[1:40:01] overrun by the Germans and they had to
[1:40:02] pull back and and anybody's ever been in
[1:40:04] the military you know that a Model A
[1:40:06] code of honor that we have among us as
[1:40:08] soldiers is we leave nobody behind no
[1:40:10] one's left behind but in this particular
[1:40:13] battle they've been overrun so fast they
[1:40:15] was pulled into the rear and they said
[1:40:16] leave the wounded we'll get them later
[1:40:18] but we've got to pull back we're going
[1:40:19] to lose every man if we don't well the
[1:40:21] sergeant turned around and this young
[1:40:23] boy had to sober up on his shoulders and
[1:40:25] the guy had been shot through the hips
[1:40:27] and the blood was pouring out of his
[1:40:28] body and this young boy he was much
[1:40:30] smaller than this man but he had him up
[1:40:32] like a fireman's ladder and he was
[1:40:34] trying to carry him and the sergeant
[1:40:36] yelled to this private and he said drop
[1:40:38] the man said we've got to retreat to the
[1:40:40] rear we'll get him later drop him let's
[1:40:41] go and so he turned back around and the
[1:40:43] boy was still struggling time to run
[1:40:45] with this man up on his shoulders and he
[1:40:47] told him the second time he said drop
[1:40:49] the man we've got to retreat to the rear
[1:40:51] we'll get him later we've got to go
[1:40:52] we've got to go drop him
[1:40:54] and so he he turned around again you
[1:40:56] know and he turned back around and the
[1:40:58] boy was still trying to carry the man
[1:41:00] and he said as your non-commissioned
[1:41:01] officer I'll order you drop that man
[1:41:04] he's too heavy for you you're he's too
[1:41:06] heavy to carry and the boy yelled back
[1:41:09] and he said Sarge He Ain't Heavy
[1:41:13] he's my brother
[1:41:16] he was trying to get his own brother off
[1:41:19] the battlefield and perhaps before they
[1:41:21] left his mama caught him in the kitchen
[1:41:23] said he said you know take care of
[1:41:24] Willie you know how he is he said oh
[1:41:26] mama I promise y'all maybe he's just
[1:41:28] trying to keep a promise to his mama but
[1:41:30] he said Sarge He Ain't Heavy
[1:41:32] he's my brother
[1:41:34] I promise you ain't none of you tonight
[1:41:37] He Ain't Heavy
[1:41:39] you're my brother you're my sister we're
[1:41:42] going to leave here together no one's
[1:41:44] Left Behind we're all going together and
[1:41:48] we're all going to sit at Daddy's house
[1:41:50] and it'll be all over one day and until
[1:41:53] then let us press on love one another
[1:41:56] encourage one another lift one another
[1:41:58] up leave no one behind don't draw a
[1:42:01] circle and get little clicks among you
[1:42:03] and leave this group out we all
[1:42:06] need each other
[1:42:08] all need each other I guess we we should
[1:42:11] close but I don't want to share One More
[1:42:12] Story with you
[1:42:13] I've told you about what the Lord did
[1:42:15] for other people
[1:42:16] I want to share One More Story
[1:42:19] my favorite scripture for years in the
[1:42:21] Bible has been Jeremiah 29 11. I know
[1:42:23] the thoughts I think towards you saith
[1:42:25] the Lord thoughts of peace and not
[1:42:27] available to give you an expected end
[1:42:28] and it's just always kind of been a
[1:42:31] scripture that that means something to
[1:42:33] me
[1:42:35] and I was preaching the meeting in
[1:42:36] Arizona and I had to preach on a
[1:42:38] Saturday morning and I woke up and I had
[1:42:40] a demon headache I was so sick the sweat
[1:42:44] was literally coming off of my face
[1:42:48] and I had to preach
[1:42:50] and brother Dale Smith called me and he
[1:42:52] said hey you want to go get some coffee
[1:42:54] I said brother Dale I said I am so sick
[1:42:56] buddy I said I got to preach in a few
[1:42:58] minutes I said my head it feels like
[1:43:00] it's going to blow off of my shoulders
[1:43:02] he said well I'll pray for you and I
[1:43:04] said man I appreciate it so in a few
[1:43:06] minutes there's a knock out my door at
[1:43:07] the hotel and opened the door is brother
[1:43:09] Dale Smith and he had some coffee and a
[1:43:10] prayer
[1:43:12] and so I went and preached and I was so
[1:43:14] sick I put one leg in my pants and I had
[1:43:17] to lay on the bed and I just laid there
[1:43:19] forever to get up put the other one in
[1:43:20] so I got up and went and preached like
[1:43:22] that and so when I got to preaching the
[1:43:25] headache kind of went away and so when
[1:43:26] the service was over
[1:43:28] I felt pretty good compared to what I
[1:43:30] felt like and so they was having a big
[1:43:32] fish fry up in Flagstaff and I was done
[1:43:35] in a place called Cottonwood
[1:43:37] and so I told him I told the brother I
[1:43:39] said I'm just going to go lay down for a
[1:43:41] little bit and I said I'll come on back
[1:43:42] the wall and he said yeah come on up and
[1:43:43] when you feel like it get your shower
[1:43:45] and so I could feel the headache coming
[1:43:47] back but it wasn't as bad
[1:43:50] and so I laid down for a little bit and
[1:43:52] I got up and I was headed up to
[1:43:53] Flagstaff and I was going up a road
[1:43:55] called 89A if you're ever out that way
[1:43:57] take 89A it's a beautiful drive from
[1:44:00] Cottonwood up towards Sedona
[1:44:02] and so
[1:44:08] I got the wine and
[1:44:10] just going to be honest with you I just
[1:44:12] a big baby
[1:44:13] I got homesick I was so homesick
[1:44:16] I just couldn't stand it
[1:44:21] and I was going up the road by myself
[1:44:24] and I began to talk to the Lord and I
[1:44:26] said Lord
[1:44:27] I said do you even know I'm out here
[1:44:30] I said am I doing any good at all
[1:44:33] I said baby I should just go home and
[1:44:34] sit down
[1:44:36] I said I don't feel good that's about to
[1:44:38] see my family
[1:44:41] I said do you even know I'm here
[1:44:44] and I saw a sign that said Scenic knew
[1:44:46] one mile and I just I just loved Sedona
[1:44:54] I'll be happy
[1:44:56] I just love those anybody been out there
[1:44:57] those Red Rocks it's beautiful beautiful
[1:45:01] so I pulled in and I got out and there
[1:45:03] was a bench there and I got out of the
[1:45:05] car and I sat down on that bench
[1:45:07] and I began to whine again
[1:45:10] I said Lord do you even know my name
[1:45:12] I said
[1:45:14] you even know about here
[1:45:17] I just go home
[1:45:19] I just want to go home
[1:45:23] as I got done praying
[1:45:26] and I looked beside me
[1:45:32] this was laying beside me
[1:45:36] and at first I thought it was in the
[1:45:38] bench
[1:45:39] but when I touched it it moved and I
[1:45:42] picked it up
[1:45:44] and it said before I formed you in the
[1:45:46] womb I knew you
[1:45:48] and before you were born
[1:45:51] set you apart
[1:45:53] and I turned it over on the other side
[1:45:57] it was Jeremiah 29. I know the thoughts
[1:46:00] I think towards you
[1:46:02] and I looked at that coin
[1:46:04] but I thought
[1:46:07] He Knows My Name
[1:46:11] and I tell you tonight
[1:46:13] everyone else no matter how lonely you
[1:46:16] may feel that nobody knows you or nobody
[1:46:18] cares about you their sister talked
[1:46:20] about but I want you to know tonight
[1:46:22] we serve a god
[1:46:25] who knows your name
[1:46:27] who can give you
[1:46:30] encouragement when you need it the most
[1:46:33] when you can't even Encourage Yourself
[1:46:35] we serve a god
[1:46:37] who can put a coin on a bench
[1:46:41] to help a whiny preacher
[1:46:43] get through
[1:46:45] a Saturday afternoon
[1:46:48] and I tell you tonight young people
[1:46:51] he knows her name
[1:46:53] he knows everything about you
[1:46:57] can't can't we serve with Gods like that
[1:47:00] can't we love a God Like That
[1:47:03] who would give a whiny preacher a coin
[1:47:07] when he needed it the most
[1:47:10] that's the kind of God
[1:47:12] we serve
[1:47:13] do you love him
[1:47:16] can we just bow our heads up
[1:47:19] I appreciate you letting me come and
[1:47:21] share some things with you tonight
[1:47:26] while her head's about just a moment
[1:47:30] forgive me for being a baby
[1:47:45] amen
[1:47:49] just before we close I just wondered
[1:47:51] tonight
[1:47:53] you've heard the testimonies and some of
[1:47:56] the things that we've seen the Lord do
[1:47:58] some of the things I've never shared
[1:47:59] never will share but it's just
[1:48:03] but if you're here tonight and
[1:48:06] we've we talked about skin trouble we've
[1:48:08] talked about depression we've talked
[1:48:10] about heart trouble talked about
[1:48:12] diabetic trouble
[1:48:17] and if you're here tonight and maybe you
[1:48:20] have a need
[1:48:22] and maybe your particular need wasn't
[1:48:24] even mentioned as far as a testimony but
[1:48:26] surely you can see if God can take a
[1:48:29] rash off of a boy that you saw the
[1:48:31] picture just clean skin
[1:48:34] if God can take depression off of a
[1:48:36] sister
[1:48:39] then whatever your need would be tonight
[1:48:41] sister Caroline's sitting there tonight
[1:48:43] healed of cancer Jessica's sitting there
[1:48:46] tonight and blinded in a wheelchair and
[1:48:48] now look at her
[1:48:51] he's God he can do anything
[1:48:54] you know what he never asked for our
[1:48:56] money he never asked for our ability but
[1:48:59] all he ever ask us to do was to believe
[1:49:02] him if those can believe all things are
[1:49:07] possible
[1:49:08] and while you're here tonight if you if
[1:49:10] you have a need
[1:49:12] but you believe that the God who met
[1:49:14] these needs of these testimonies can
[1:49:16] meet your need tonight
[1:49:18] would you just raise your hand to him
[1:49:19] and say Lord
[1:49:20] I believe that tonight
[1:49:22] God bless those hands there God bless
[1:49:24] those hands there
[1:49:26] I bless that hand there yes
[1:49:30] if you're here no one looking around but
[1:49:32] if you're here and you've never accepted
[1:49:34] Jesus Christ as your savior
[1:49:36] I wonder if he would just slip you not
[1:49:38] to point you out I would never embarrass
[1:49:40] you
[1:49:42] but if you feel something pulling on
[1:49:43] your heart tonight do you just raise
[1:49:45] your hand
[1:49:46] say Lord would you remember me
[1:49:49] I keep remember that Apache man just
[1:49:52] before he passed
[1:49:54] you touched his heart
[1:49:56] would you raise your hand just yes God
[1:49:58] bless that Handler
[1:50:01] anyone else just before we yes God bless
[1:50:04] that hand God bless that hand
[1:50:06] Hallelujah
[1:50:08] God bless that hand right there yes
[1:50:11] isn't he wonderful
[1:50:14] amen
[1:50:18] God bless your hand he saw your hand
[1:50:22] isn't he wonderful
[1:50:25] there is no God
[1:50:27] like by God
[1:50:31] thank you Lord
[1:50:34] here's what I want us to do tonight
[1:50:37] I want you to lay hands on one another
[1:50:39] will you do that just reach over brother
[1:50:40] to brother sister to sister
[1:50:43] and then if you're out there by yourself
[1:50:44] just find somebody and just slip your
[1:50:47] hand over on them would you do that
[1:50:48] tonight
[1:50:50] would you be a conduit a channel
[1:50:52] that the spirit of the Lord could touch
[1:50:54] someone
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:58] amen
[1:51:04] now that person you got your hand on
[1:51:06] might have been the one that raised her
[1:51:07] hand
[1:51:09] I don't want you to pray honestly you be
[1:51:12] that brother on the battlefield
[1:51:14] so he ain't heavy
[1:51:16] he's my brother that's my sister

[1:52:01] Lord some of them need an experience

[1:52:18] that you don't love us that you don't
[1:52:19] care for us that this ain't for us
[1:52:22] but Lord we hear your voice tonight
[1:52:23] speak into our hearts
[1:52:26] and Lord we surrender to you and we lay
[1:52:28] our hands upon one another and may the
[1:52:31] same anointing that raised my Lord from

[1:59:12] I was meeting in New Mexico one time and
[1:59:15] my back went out
[1:59:17] I laid in the floor of the hotel room
[1:59:20] put my feet up on the couch on ice
[1:59:25] I left that little thing at the door of
[1:59:27] the hotel with the door wouldn't shut so
[1:59:30] brother Giovanni could bring me food
[1:59:33] I ate my food
[1:59:34] laying on the floor of a hotel room
[1:59:37] because I wasn't able to sit up
[1:59:39] I had to preach that night brother Jewel
[1:59:42] said if you can't make it I'll take the
[1:59:45] service and then you can take my service
[1:59:46] two nights later
[1:59:49] so I text brother Donnie Texan Brothers
[1:59:51] ask him to pray
[1:59:53] so I text brother Joe I said brother
[1:59:54] Jewel I believe I'm going to preach
[1:59:56] tonight
[1:59:58] he texts back and he said ooh man
[2:00:01] he drove me to the meeting it was all I
[2:00:03] could do to get up into the study
[2:00:06] I laid in this floor of the study with
[2:00:08] my feet up on the couch so they called
[2:00:09] me to the pulpit sister Cindy hunt was
[2:00:11] in those meeting she's out there that
[2:00:13] year
[2:00:13] I come up the aisle I could hardly walk
[2:00:17] I got to hold the pulpit honestly my
[2:00:19] knuckles were white because I sprayed if
[2:00:20] I let go I'd fall in the floor
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:24] but when I was laid up there I said Lord
[2:00:29] please don't make me stand in front of
[2:00:31] your people like this
[2:00:36] and I was standing there and greeting
[2:00:37] the people
[2:00:39] holding on to the pulpit
[2:00:41] and I felt a hand touched me in my back
[2:00:44] you know I always have mock trouble
[2:00:46] you've been around me enough to know
[2:00:48] whatever time I come to the woman I told
[2:00:50] somebody if I die and cross over and
[2:00:52] somebody hands me a microphone I didn't
[2:00:54] make it I went somewhere
[2:00:57] so when I felt this hand touched my back
[2:00:59] and I thought
[2:01:00] something's wrong with my mic so I
[2:01:02] turned around thinking it was a song
[2:01:03] leader and I thought that's funny
[2:01:05] there's no one behind me
[2:01:08] when I turn back around
[2:01:10] he's like two warm vials of water
[2:01:13] just run down my legs
[2:01:17] and it was over
[2:01:21] I was instantly healed
[2:01:27] every word of worship is due our God
[2:01:32] there is no God
[2:01:33] like our God thank you for your time I
[2:01:36] hope I've not kept you too
[2:01:40] Here Comes Michael he's going to testify
[2:01:42] God bless you all thank you for letting
[2:01:45] me be a part of your service
[2:01:47] [Applause]
[2:01:52] y'all can just be seated yesterday
[2:01:57] I'm probably one of the few that's here
[2:01:59] tonight that uh
[2:02:01] was part of this
[2:02:03] probably one of the best youth leaders
[2:02:05] that you could have
[2:02:08] and
[2:02:09] I look look around and
[2:02:14] some of the brothers and sisters that
[2:02:15] were in our youth group they've got
[2:02:18] positions now in the church they're
[2:02:20] Sunday school teachers I.T people all
[2:02:23] they do just stuff all over to the
[2:02:24] through the church and
[2:02:26] when you're this age you don't realize
[2:02:31] what God's doing to you
[2:02:33] and what if time lasts God forbid if it
[2:02:37] does the way the world is but if it does
[2:02:40] you're going to look at these times
[2:02:43] and look at your leaders like we look at
[2:02:45] brother Daryl and held you guys together
[2:02:49] our group
[2:02:52] the church was probably in the it was on
[2:02:55] the verge of splitting
[2:02:57] is almost on the verge of collapsing
[2:03:00] this church look what we are now but
[2:03:04] during that time it was the lowest
[2:03:05] probably lowest part I can remember
[2:03:08] but our youth group
[2:03:12] was on fire
[2:03:14] and I look back and to me that's what
[2:03:18] held our church together I mean going to
[2:03:20] brother Daryl's House our meetings
[2:03:24] had spiritual meetings
[2:03:27] and then we had non-spiritual meetings I
[2:03:30] mean we did it was fun you know I won't
[2:03:32] get into it but we had a good time and
[2:03:36] it binded us together as a group and
[2:03:40] you don't realize it this is what these
[2:03:43] brothers are trying to do with this
[2:03:46] this Divine you don't know how important
[2:03:48] it is just to get together
[2:03:51] and just play ball or sit and talk you
[2:03:54] know it keeps you guys together and
[2:03:57] during that was it brother Donnie come
[2:03:58] for a youth service brother Donnie came
[2:04:01] first time at our church was for one of
[2:04:03] our youth services
[2:04:05] and because we were so on fire
[2:04:08] and from there you know it's just
[2:04:10] history God's got it all in control but
[2:04:13] you know I just want you guys to know
[2:04:16] how important your your youth leaders is
[2:04:19] you know
[2:04:20] and that like I said you don't realize
[2:04:22] it right now but just try to give them
[2:04:25] you know a rose while you can you know
[2:04:28] because
[2:04:29] we're not young anymore you know
[2:04:32] I'm on the verge a couple years of what
[2:04:35] you want to say
[2:04:36] we just have the youth meet
[2:04:39] it's like when Wednesday night and the
[2:04:41] you've done everything they took up the
[2:04:43] offer and all the specials they opened
[2:04:46] the service and we had a well like
[2:04:48] brother Donnie came from one of the
[2:04:49] meetings so I was preaching at that I
[2:04:52] think it was like I was opening up the
[2:04:54] service someone sent me a prayer request
[2:04:56] to pray for the family of so and so
[2:04:59] passed away so it's okay okay and I was
[2:05:02] so nervous and Michael goes well what's
[2:05:04] that note and I said so-and-so wants
[2:05:06] prayer so Michael gets up and says
[2:05:09] so-and-so's moving prayer with the guy
[2:05:11] he's talking about
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:19] the family wanted prayer but I told
[2:05:21] Michael the God wanted prayer
[2:05:23] and to pray for those that well the guy
[2:05:24] was dead that was his first miracle
[2:05:29] but I just wanted to say that to you
[2:05:31] guys you know how important this is
[2:05:34] right now you don't realize
[2:05:38] I really appreciate you know what
[2:05:39] brother Daryl did with their group and
[2:05:41] what brother Joe and brother Rob is
[2:05:42] doing now you know it's keeping you guys
[2:05:45] together and time last some of you'll be
[2:05:49] musicians you know maybe preachers
[2:05:51] sitting here Sunday school teachers
[2:05:54] to see some of them coming up so you
[2:05:57] know just
[2:05:58] it's more important than you think but
[2:06:02] I'll just tell my little testimony
[2:06:06] still remember I woke up on a Monday
[2:06:09] morning my back was hurting right here
[2:06:11] first thing I thought of was a kidney
[2:06:14] stone because I'd heard of them you know
[2:06:15] you know you do not want one and I went
[2:06:18] into work and brother Jimmy and Ron and
[2:06:20] all of them and I heard all through the
[2:06:22] day started getting worse that evening
[2:06:24] and by Tuesday I don't think I came into
[2:06:28] work
[2:06:29] and I was hurting pretty bad and brother
[2:06:31] Donnie was contacting me and I was
[2:06:34] hurting really bad he said what you need
[2:06:36] to do he said you need to make a
[2:06:39] concoction of asparagus and Coke
[2:06:42] together and drink it
[2:06:45] that will dissolve your kidney stone
[2:06:46] well I did that
[2:06:49] lo and behold after I drunk all that
[2:06:52] kidney stone had blocked I could not go
[2:06:55] to the bathroom so there I was
[2:07:00] dying
[2:07:01] and so I ended up going I think it was
[2:07:03] Wednesday going to the emergency room
[2:07:05] and they finally got me where I could go
[2:07:07] to the restroom but I went home and
[2:07:11] still had the stone and how many knows
[2:07:13] what a fetal position is
[2:07:17] I was on top of my bed in the fetal
[2:07:19] position I was in the floor in the fetal
[2:07:22] position
[2:07:24] yo you'd come in and
[2:07:27] nothing you could do and every time that
[2:07:29] stone would move it's just like it had a
[2:07:32] knife in your back
[2:07:34] and the next Thursday was Thanksgiving
[2:07:36] and we always go brother Daryl's for
[2:07:39] Thanksgiving to eat and we should have a
[2:07:41] real good time well the family went on I
[2:07:44] had to stay
[2:07:46] I had a Thursday Friday Saturday and
[2:07:49] still killing me Sunday
[2:07:51] it was still killing me and they went to
[2:07:54] church and I was screaming I was one of
[2:07:56] those God bless our streamers thank God
[2:07:58] for streamers because I was streaming
[2:08:00] and I was watching it on my phone laying
[2:08:02] in bed and at the end of service brother
[2:08:04] I said I just feel led to pray for
[2:08:06] brother Michael said he's at home got a
[2:08:08] kid who stole
[2:08:09] and he said that I grabbed my phone I
[2:08:11] still remember I grabbed my phone
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:15] and the church prayed for me I got up
[2:08:18] out of the bed went to the restroom and
[2:08:19] passed the stone within five seconds
[2:08:22] after they prayed for me so you know
[2:08:25] after I'd had it for seven days that was
[2:08:27] my miracle that the Lord did for me but
[2:08:31] oh
[2:08:33] that just look at these services that
[2:08:37] you have a little little different you
[2:08:40] know it's it's molding you
[2:08:43] for the future for what future we have
[2:08:46] and just look at your your leaders a
[2:08:48] little different you know
[2:08:50] all four of us guys love you we're not
[2:08:53] here to you know for nothing these guys
[2:08:57] we love you guys and we put forth time

[2:09:14] see while we're having these meetings a
[2:09:16] little bit better and
[2:09:20] something a little more spiritual than
[2:09:22] just Gathering and playing ball so
[2:09:25] that's what I just want to say and I
[2:09:27] really just wanted to say I really
[2:09:28] appreciate brother Daryl I think we had
[2:09:30] one of the greatest youth leaders that
[2:09:33] for the time
[2:09:37] thank you for all the years that you
[2:09:39] give to us and it shows you know from
[2:09:42] the brothers and sisters you see the

[2:10:13] happen
[2:10:14] around here without the behind the
[2:10:16] scenes guy have to have him
[2:10:19] in fact Michael Bailey does more in his

[2:10:26] does more in this church than anybody in
[2:10:28] this church
[2:10:30] you wouldn't
[2:10:32] we wouldn't have the things we
[2:10:34] the times we have together for one for
[2:10:37] Michael Bailey so
[2:10:39] he told me he's going to for the last 20
[2:10:42] years he has kept telling me he's going
[2:10:44] to lay it down but it'll never happen
[2:10:47] me and brother Rob's going with him when
[2:10:49] he goes so
[2:10:50] but you know it's sometimes it's behind
[2:10:54] the scenes guys that
