[44:00] spafford's heart as he went to his cabin

[44:05] the spirit of God spoke words of Hope to
[44:08] him as he said to himself it is well the
[44:12] will of God be done

[52:45] they've got a
[52:46] another daughter that's a couple years
[52:48] old they let them dedicate to him both

[53:34] what do you think about this new sister
[53:37] yeah you like it yeah yeah
[53:43] let's just pray together
[53:46] Heavenly Father our brother and sister
[53:49] they realize they have a great
[53:51] responsibility in these two daughters of
[53:54] theirs
[53:55] to try to raise them teach them
[53:58] to be able to make them as best as they
[54:01] possibly can
[54:02] ultimately we know that when our
[54:04] children come to the spot that they will
[54:06] begin to make decisions for themselves
[54:09] but they want to do everything they can
[54:12] to try to help them and lead them in the
[54:14] right way
[54:16] today Lord God they feel in their heart
[54:18] that they want to bring them to you
[54:21] and ask of your great counsel and
[54:24] guidance You're The Giver of Life You're
[54:26] The Giver of these children to their
[54:28] charge we bring them before you today
[54:31] Lord and we dedicate their little lives
[54:34] to you we pray father of time with Terry
[54:36] that they would be old enough to be able
[54:38] to make the choice of their soul
[54:41] destination they will be able to make it
[54:43] while they're young before the evil days
[54:46] would come upon them I pray for my
[54:48] sister that you would help her Lord that
[54:50] she can be the Fifth Gospel and Living
[54:53] Color May the spirit of God help my
[54:56] brother to be able to be the right kind
[54:58] of father the right kind of example Lord
[55:01] God whenever we stand there that day we
[55:04] want to look and there'll be those two
[55:06] not baby and a little three-year-old the
[55:09] two beautiful women that have served God
[55:12] and given their life to you and they
[55:14] will through eternity look to that
[55:16] mother and father and say thank you so
[55:20] much we commit them to you today Father
[55:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus amen
[55:28] thank you
[55:31] ready to sleep
[55:35] you're welcome
[55:37] God bless you to stand together
[55:45] certainly appreciate the goodness of the
[55:47] Lord to us today
[55:49] all of his mercy and all that he's done
[55:51] for us
[55:52] we've got so much to praise him for
[55:53] don't we so many wonderful things that
[55:56] he's done
[55:57] Romans chapter 8 verse 16.
[56:00] well you're turning there Carol and I
[56:01] would like to express our appreciation
[56:03] for all the birthday cards and gifts and
[56:07] um wedding anniversary cards and all of
[56:10] that we thank you so much for that
[56:12] but for more than that we thank you for
[56:15] your prayers we thank you for loving us
[56:18] and putting up with us
[56:20] thank you for what you mean to us from
[56:22] our hearts
[56:24] let us read from the book of Romans
[56:26] chapter 8 verse 16.
[56:29] we're just speaking about the bride's
[56:31] rights for several Services now and
[56:34] would like to continue them
[56:36] the right to reign with him
[56:40] as all rights are
[56:43] you have to fight for them of course
[56:45] some of them are more difficult to
[56:47] attain than others
[56:49] some of them will a great portion of
[56:51] their happening will be by Divine
[56:54] Providence
[56:55] but there's much of it that God will
[56:58] incorporate our own lives into and make
[57:00] it blend together the Divine side and
[57:03] The Human Side
[57:04] let's listen at the great inspired
[57:06] servant of God righteousness in Romans
[57:09] chapter 8 verse 16.
[57:11] the spirit itself Bears witness with our
[57:15] spirit that we are the children of God
[57:18] if you have that today you ought to be
[57:20] one of the happiest people in all the
[57:22] Earth
[57:23] that the spirit Bears a witness with
[57:25] your spirit that you're a child of God
[57:28] and if children then heirs
[57:31] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[57:37] but now listen how this is correlated
[57:40] together not only with sovereignty but
[57:43] with something else
[57:45] if so be that we suffer
[57:49] with him
[57:51] that we may be also glorified together
[57:56] so we are Heirs of God John Heirs of
[57:58] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[58:02] that we may be also glorified together
[58:07] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[58:09] present time
[58:11] are not worthy to be compared with the
[58:14] glory which shall be revealed in US
[58:19] for the earnest expectation of the
[58:21] creature listen to this now wait us for
[58:25] the manifestation
[58:27] of the sons of God
[58:29] and his longing for that day
[58:32] I may like to be remembered today before
[58:33] the Lord in prayer I certainly
[58:35] appreciate you remember Eric if you
[58:37] would since you had that Bob said the
[58:39] other day she had been having quite a
[58:40] bit of pain
[58:42] um not sure exactly where it's coming
[58:43] from but we stopped to pray for it today
[58:46] before we came to church
[58:47] sort of like in her pancreas maybe but
[58:50] today moving up into her shoulders but
[58:52] we believe our God is greater than all
[58:54] pain don't we
[58:56] this is approaching now Heavenly Father
[58:58] we're so thankful for your love and
[59:00] grace to us today we thank you for the
[59:02] opportunity that we can be gathered
[59:04] together here Lord we've realized you're
[59:06] gone that we're living in the closing
[59:09] hours of the Gentile history
[59:11] we desire Our Lives to be pleasing to
[59:14] you more than anything else in this
[59:17] world
[59:17] we desire father that we would be able
[59:20] to obtain all of our rights given to us
[59:23] by the Blessed Son of God for we know it
[59:27] was you who purchased our right to be
[59:29] saved our right to be Sanctified our
[59:32] right to be justified to be filled with
[59:34] the Holy Ghost all of these great things
[59:37] you purchased it freely given it to us
[59:40] and we're so thankful and yet we know
[59:43] and obtaining those it's like many of
[59:45] our rights as an American citizen there
[59:48] may come times that we will have to
[59:49] fight for them because people will try
[59:52] to take them away so I pray that you
[59:55] would help us today Lord as we look into
[59:57] your words you saw the hundreds of hands
[59:59] that were uplifted signifying a need or
[1:00:01] many would you be mindful of them today
[1:00:03] Lord speak to every heart we ask in the
[1:00:07] name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God
[1:00:10] bless you you may be seated
[1:00:17] turn with me to Second Corinthians
[1:00:19] chapter 2 if you would verse 14.
[1:00:22] all things are for your sakes
[1:00:26] that the abundant grace might through
[1:00:30] the Thanksgiving of many
[1:00:33] redowned to the glory of God
[1:00:37] for which cause we faint not
[1:00:40] but though our outward man perish
[1:00:44] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:00:50] for our light Affliction which is but
[1:00:53] for a moment worketh for us
[1:00:56] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[1:01:01] of Glory
[1:01:03] this is certainly not the words of a man
[1:01:06] who had it easy all of his life
[1:01:09] certainly not a man that since he had
[1:01:11] become a child of God and then of course
[1:01:13] become a preacher and become the first
[1:01:17] church AIDS messenger in this first
[1:01:19] Ephesian age it's not the words of a man
[1:01:22] that had everybody to like him everybody
[1:01:26] thought he was this great fellow it was
[1:01:29] not the words of an individual who had
[1:01:32] served god without a lot of Heartache
[1:01:35] but we hear from his pen
[1:01:38] from the words inspired by the suffering
[1:01:42] in his body spirit and soul that this is
[1:01:46] a man by this time in his ministry now
[1:01:49] it's around 55 60 A.D something like
[1:01:53] that he doesn't have too many more years
[1:01:55] before they're going to cut his head off
[1:01:58] he's went through more than Could Be
[1:02:01] Imagined he suffered so much for the
[1:02:05] gospel sake now we know he went through
[1:02:08] a lot no doubt like all of us have
[1:02:10] because of his own shortcomings he dealt
[1:02:13] with remembering short things that he
[1:02:16] had done he dealt with all of those that
[1:02:19] he had persecuted for the cause of
[1:02:21] Christ they live for the Lord and he
[1:02:24] hated the Lord Jesus at the time no
[1:02:26] doubt he would remember over and over
[1:02:29] again I've wondered myself how many
[1:02:31] times Paul would lay at night and could
[1:02:34] not sleep and he would see the faces of
[1:02:38] the martyrs that he had caused to die
[1:02:41] for the gospel I wonder how many times
[1:02:44] that he relived as those that was having
[1:02:48] their heads bashed in with stones and
[1:02:51] being imprisoned all that he'd done that
[1:02:54] of course was not for the glory of God
[1:02:57] but that was his own mistakes but how
[1:03:00] much now has it changed since he's
[1:03:03] become a prisoner of the gospel and
[1:03:06] because of that he's went through so
[1:03:09] much stuff for the Lord Jesus and we
[1:03:13] know ourselves that once we become
[1:03:15] Servants of the Living God Children of
[1:03:19] the purpose of almighty God there will
[1:03:22] be so much that we will go through which
[1:03:24] we have absolutely nothing to do with
[1:03:27] ourself it's not our mistakes it's not
[1:03:30] our frailties it's not even us reaping
[1:03:33] for past sins but it's something that
[1:03:36] has been attributed by the grace of God
[1:03:39] to our life now you and I may not think
[1:03:42] it's a blessing that God would give us
[1:03:44] such things but yet in reality it is
[1:03:47] because there's something about the path
[1:03:51] to Glory that is Laden with a heavy load
[1:03:55] of a cross
[1:03:57] there's something about the correlation
[1:03:59] of the weight of our cross in time that
[1:04:04] will bear out to the reflection of the
[1:04:07] crown that we'll receive on the other
[1:04:10] side now of course in this layout of cnh
[1:04:13] people want a crown they want to be
[1:04:16] honored of course in the resurrection
[1:04:18] they want their deeds to be resounded
[1:04:21] before everybody they want the mind what
[1:04:24] they've done to be put upon a great
[1:04:25] large screen and you bought somebody a
[1:04:28] meal one time you did this and that and
[1:04:31] the other that's typical for Leia to
[1:04:33] sins they want to be recognized and what
[1:04:35] they do they want it to be resounded
[1:04:38] from the housetops
[1:04:40] all but do they realize in order to wear
[1:04:44] a crown that day there will be such a
[1:04:48] weight on the human before they ever get
[1:04:52] there how God would measure the size the
[1:04:57] glory the Effigy of your crown by the
[1:05:01] burden related here in this life even
[1:05:06] our reward which will be given to us
[1:05:10] will be measured by The Works that we
[1:05:14] have done
[1:05:15] for his cause
[1:05:17] now notice in second Corinthians chapter
[1:05:19] 6 verse 3. Paul speaking about himself
[1:05:23] and about others
[1:05:25] and he particularly goes to the ministry
[1:05:28] here and he says giving no offense in
[1:05:32] anything
[1:05:34] that the ministry be not blamed it's
[1:05:37] just too sad that a lot of preachers
[1:05:39] don't carry out this same verse now
[1:05:43] notice he realizes the value God calls a
[1:05:47] man and then God gives a man that gift
[1:05:49] and that ability and much of what will
[1:05:52] become of that gift is not just about
[1:05:55] God but it's about the man himself I
[1:05:58] will apply himself what will he do with
[1:06:00] it now Paul realizes that offenses can
[1:06:04] be brought on the ministry by the
[1:06:07] ministry themselves
[1:06:09] so it says giving no offense in anything
[1:06:13] that the ministry be not blamed now we
[1:06:17] realize in our ranks there's many people
[1:06:19] that don't even believe in Ministry and
[1:06:21] a lot of them it's no wonder it's no
[1:06:24] wonder what they've seen the way they've
[1:06:26] been treated by preachers and the things
[1:06:28] that preachers have done the doctrines
[1:06:30] that they've done and all that sort of
[1:06:33] thing but that does not change that God
[1:06:36] still has a holy ghost film Ministry and
[1:06:40] yet them preachers if they would only
[1:06:42] recognize as Paul did giving no offense
[1:06:46] in anything that the ministry be not
[1:06:50] blamed but in all things approving
[1:06:53] ourselves as the Ministers of God so
[1:06:58] it's not just for you to prove me it's
[1:07:01] not for God to prove me but I am to
[1:07:05] prove myself so is every other
[1:07:08] god-called man now that part the Holy
[1:07:11] Ghost will not do the angels will not do
[1:07:15] and it's not your responsibility to do
[1:07:17] but it is my responsibility I will
[1:07:21] answer that day to the Lord for what I
[1:07:25] have done was what he's given me I
[1:07:28] realize that I have much to be
[1:07:30] accountable for if I had only this
[1:07:33] visible audience with hundreds of people
[1:07:36] here today but I have also the invisible
[1:07:39] possible audience which stream us which
[1:07:42] many of them have no church to go to I
[1:07:45] have hundreds times hundreds way more
[1:07:48] than what you see here today that I will
[1:07:51] give an account for then you go beyond
[1:07:53] that of those who feed from our church
[1:07:56] that have churches of their own I have
[1:08:00] thousands times thousands I have to
[1:08:04] answer to God for and let me set this
[1:08:06] way any man that wants that without a
[1:08:09] call from God is an absolute idiot he
[1:08:13] ain't got a lick of sense
[1:08:15] to realize the responsibility each one
[1:08:18] of you fathers that God will make you
[1:08:21] answer for the direction of your home
[1:08:24] for you husbands that will give an
[1:08:26] account for your why and for your
[1:08:29] children it's a great thing to answer
[1:08:31] for is it not so Paul then look as that
[1:08:35] as it Beyond just he was not a married
[1:08:38] man did not have children but he
[1:08:40] recognized as a messenger a church age
[1:08:44] messenger he had so much he would be
[1:08:47] accountable for if he led the church in
[1:08:50] one error of a false Doctrine if they
[1:08:54] followed his example in some way of
[1:08:57] something that he did wrong and there
[1:08:59] might be thousands of people that would
[1:09:03] follow in that error because they had
[1:09:05] confidence in him it's a very scary
[1:09:08] thing now notice he said but in all
[1:09:11] things approving ourselves as the
[1:09:14] Ministers of God in much patience in
[1:09:18] afflictions in Necessities in distresses
[1:09:22] notice now this is a man that is filled
[1:09:25] with the Holy Ghost a man who loves God
[1:09:27] with all of his heart but look at what
[1:09:29] he's going through as a minister proving
[1:09:32] ourselves as the Ministers of God in
[1:09:35] much patience in afflictions in
[1:09:38] Necessities in distresses again he says
[1:09:42] in stripes in imprisonments in tomats in
[1:09:48] labors and watchings and fastings listen
[1:09:53] what this man have been through so we're
[1:09:56] not talking about a man that just went
[1:09:58] through some Seminary College somewhere
[1:10:00] he was never reproached for the gospel
[1:10:03] never hated you realize a lot of the men
[1:10:06] that are preaching on this day they for
[1:10:08] the most part heart have had hardly no
[1:10:11] absolutely no difficulty whatsoever
[1:10:14] they've not been persecuted for the
[1:10:17] cause of Christ their life has not been
[1:10:20] threatened by people who would look for
[1:10:22] an advantage to kill them because of
[1:10:25] what they preached for they have never
[1:10:28] been threatened in any way demons don't
[1:10:31] bother them people don't bother them
[1:10:34] hell is not out to get them they have
[1:10:38] this easy road that is paved before them
[1:10:41] because they preach only things that are
[1:10:44] going to make people feel good they're
[1:10:46] never going to cross people they're
[1:10:48] never going to tell people if you don't
[1:10:51] get right with God you're going to hell
[1:10:53] I ain't going to say nothing like that
[1:10:55] not in the day we're living in Preachers
[1:10:57] are looking for the easy way out I'll
[1:11:00] tell you one thing I'd rather be hated
[1:11:02] and despise and talked about and
[1:11:06] misunderstood and when I stand before
[1:11:08] the law Lord that he says well done then
[1:11:12] beloved by everybody that ever hears me
[1:11:15] and people Pat me on the back and said
[1:11:17] what a wonderful man that guy I'm
[1:11:20] telling you what he he just loves
[1:11:23] everybody if love means not telling them
[1:11:25] the truth that ain't real love
[1:11:28] I would rather people misunderstand me
[1:11:31] and even not even like me and yet for me
[1:11:35] to stand before the Lord and him say
[1:11:37] Well done then for everybody and their
[1:11:40] brother to Pat me on the back and say oh
[1:11:43] my what a great man what a great man and
[1:11:46] then me stand before the Lord and him
[1:11:48] look at me in the face and say you are a
[1:11:52] false prophet you are going to hell
[1:11:57] at not only you but thousands of people
[1:12:01] you are responsible for
[1:12:05] not me brother sister no sir I'm going
[1:12:08] to tell you the truth if you get so mad
[1:12:10] at me you'd feel like smacking me on the
[1:12:12] face but one day you'll hug the net
[1:12:16] now notice
[1:12:22] Paul doesn't just leave it in the sad
[1:12:25] difficult side of verse four and five
[1:12:27] but look in verse 6 how he takes a
[1:12:29] different Avenue by pureness by
[1:12:32] knowledge by long-suffering by kindness
[1:12:35] by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned now
[1:12:40] you would come to a very peculiar verse
[1:12:43] in second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 5.
[1:12:47] there's no other writer in the New
[1:12:50] Testament that says it quite in this way
[1:12:53] and Paul must have had a real insight
[1:12:56] into this that not only by the
[1:12:59] inspiration of the spirit of God but I
[1:13:01] personally believe by dealing within his
[1:13:03] everyday walk so he said as the
[1:13:06] sufferings of Christ abound in US
[1:13:11] so our consolation also abound Us by
[1:13:15] Christ I want you to notice how he coins
[1:13:17] this term he does not say suffering
[1:13:21] things for Christ
[1:13:24] read it but he says for as the
[1:13:27] sufferings of Christ
[1:13:31] so many true Christians are not just
[1:13:36] suffering for Christ
[1:13:38] it is actually Christ's sufferings in
[1:13:42] them
[1:13:44] it is him living out now we believe that
[1:13:47] all of our hearts that he's living out
[1:13:49] the miraculous do we not these sounds
[1:13:52] shall follow them that believe in my
[1:13:54] name they shall cast out devils and lay
[1:13:56] hands on the sick we see that do we not
[1:13:58] we see those things but how many of us
[1:14:01] want the sufferings of Christ as well as
[1:14:05] the signs of Christ
[1:14:07] now notice again the word that he uses
[1:14:11] here whenever he he words this as the
[1:14:13] sufferings of Christ abound now this
[1:14:17] word is a Greek word that was used of a
[1:14:20] flower or it could be on a tree or it
[1:14:22] could be on a bush or it could be a
[1:14:24] flower that comes up out of the ground
[1:14:26] and it defines the stages of the flower
[1:14:30] how that when the flowers were first
[1:14:32] break force and you can barely see a
[1:14:35] tiny tiny peak of color and then the
[1:14:38] leaves around that or the covering on
[1:14:40] the outside would protect it it's not in
[1:14:43] its Glory yet but you can see it is a
[1:14:47] flower it's going to make a beautiful
[1:14:49] flower so this was a Greek word that was
[1:14:52] used of the flower coming from that
[1:14:55] primitive hidden stage and then it
[1:14:58] starts opening up day by day by day it
[1:15:02] opens and it opens and then the little
[1:15:04] coverings on the outside begin to turn
[1:15:07] down as that as they turned down then
[1:15:09] they begin to magnify the yellow or the
[1:15:12] red or the pink or the purple of the
[1:15:14] flower this was the word that Paul used
[1:15:17] that it was abounding so it was slowly
[1:15:20] unfolding and he said this is what the
[1:15:24] sufferings of Christ will do in his true
[1:15:27] body now not everybody that claims to be
[1:15:30] a Christian but it's like the sufferings
[1:15:33] of Christ will start be molded in that
[1:15:36] child of God's life and as they grow
[1:15:38] they will begin to abound and God will
[1:15:41] find them faithful and more faithful and
[1:15:44] more true and more committed and as they
[1:15:47] grow the abounding of the suffering of
[1:15:50] Christ begins to unfold itself in their
[1:15:53] life then that which was hidden becomes
[1:15:56] revealed and the Mystery the The Mystery
[1:15:59] of the color that was on the inside of
[1:16:01] that it begins to become magnified as
[1:16:04] each trial and each test begins to lay
[1:16:07] yourself backwards and the little petals
[1:16:10] begin to unfold oh I pray that God can
[1:16:14] find that in our lives as well I don't
[1:16:17] want to just stand before in that day
[1:16:18] and say Donnie you laid hands on a bunch
[1:16:21] of people with cancer and they were made
[1:16:23] well I see you built churches in Uganda
[1:16:26] you built churches in Kenya you built
[1:16:29] churches here you've done this and that
[1:16:31] and the other I don't want just him to
[1:16:33] say that about me I want him to say I
[1:16:37] saw the abounding glory of my sufferings
[1:16:40] in your life even though you did not
[1:16:43] understand even though it was not your
[1:16:46] choice you did not shirk when I put you
[1:16:49] into a position to where you knew that
[1:16:53] if you preach this and this and this you
[1:16:56] would lose many friends and you could
[1:16:58] have chose to left that out of your
[1:17:00] notes you could have chosen not to say
[1:17:03] this or that or the other but you said
[1:17:06] it anyway because I inspired you little
[1:17:09] did you know that would abound more and
[1:17:12] more to the glory of God now listen what
[1:17:15] Paul said as the sufferings of Christ
[1:17:18] nor for but of Christ abound in us so
[1:17:23] our consolation also abound Us by Christ
[1:17:27] that's a peculiar sin who would have
[1:17:29] ever thought that trials abounding in
[1:17:33] our life sufferings of Christ would turn
[1:17:35] right around and cause Comfort to also
[1:17:39] abound in our lives for us to comfort
[1:17:41] ourselves no to comfort others so Trials
[1:17:44] come and it brings such difficulty and
[1:17:48] hardship but if we will allow it it will
[1:17:50] turn it right around and it will produce
[1:17:53] consolation
[1:17:55] I was talking to Lance yesterday my
[1:17:58] son-in-law and he was telling me Brother
[1:18:00] Don you know this has really done
[1:18:01] something for me in the way that it's
[1:18:04] changed me about Erica and he said
[1:18:07] before I would hear of people with
[1:18:09] cancer going through this and that I
[1:18:11] would feel sorry for him he said but not
[1:18:13] like now so whenever I hear of someone
[1:18:16] going through something he said I not
[1:18:19] only think of the person that is sick
[1:18:21] but I think of the caregivers
[1:18:24] now why would he sing of the caregiver
[1:18:27] because he is one as a matter of fact
[1:18:30] he's taken a leave from work for almost
[1:18:32] three months
[1:18:33] so that he could be with Erica because
[1:18:36] Erica wanted him to be there by her side
[1:18:39] he's been a faithful husband
[1:18:41] so that opened up how by reading about
[1:18:45] it no by walking in that position and
[1:18:49] then watch what it does it will begin to
[1:18:52] abound so the petals have begin to
[1:18:54] unfold himself every request that I get
[1:18:58] from around the world of someone who
[1:19:00] requests for prayer was cancer I always
[1:19:04] forward that to Erica you know why she
[1:19:07] knows it better than I do how them
[1:19:10] people need prayer and you know when
[1:19:13] you've gone through something say it's
[1:19:15] it's dimacular something with your eyes
[1:19:17] and you're degenerating or say it's a
[1:19:20] kidney stone say it's a blood pressure
[1:19:22] and when the request is read from behind
[1:19:25] the pulpit remember so and so they're
[1:19:27] dealing with high blood and you're
[1:19:28] saying oh Lord I know how that feels
[1:19:30] Lord I know that kidney stone Lord I
[1:19:33] know a wayward son I know that so
[1:19:35] there's something about what we go
[1:19:37] through that begins to abound in our
[1:19:40] lives and it's not just for this life
[1:19:44] itself but it is actually leading us to
[1:19:48] a glory that will be revealed in us at
[1:19:52] that day now the Greek word that Paul
[1:19:54] uses here which I know means nothing to
[1:19:56] us as far as Greek but it's just an
[1:19:58] unusual word that he chose to use and it
[1:20:01] was parissa which means in us so the
[1:20:05] sufferings of Christ himself are
[1:20:08] actually reliving out of us so it's it's
[1:20:12] exemplifying itself through our lives
[1:20:16] you know it's no wonder that the prophet
[1:20:18] said that the church is not being
[1:20:19] persecuted and not suffering is not in
[1:20:22] the will of God
[1:20:24] Christ's suffering sin are represented
[1:20:27] as overflowing out of this word parissa
[1:20:30] it is overflowing so it's coming from
[1:20:33] the very heart of Christ can you imagine
[1:20:36] that we're saying healing and salvation
[1:20:38] and miracles and all of that oh sure we
[1:20:41] all want that coming from the heart of
[1:20:43] Christ but we're talking about a people
[1:20:45] that are going to reign with him
[1:20:46] remember John mentions in Revelation
[1:20:49] chapter 20 verse 5 and he mentions it in
[1:20:52] several place of Revelation chapter 1
[1:20:53] verse 7 but when he talks about those
[1:20:56] that will rule and reign with Christ
[1:20:58] well how does that come about it does
[1:21:00] not come about by simply being given to
[1:21:03] us but there must be a character which
[1:21:05] will match our lord and there must be a
[1:21:08] union between us and Christ Jesus that
[1:21:11] we have suffered as being a child of God
[1:21:14] read with me in Philippians chapter 3
[1:21:16] verse 10. Paul said that I may know him
[1:21:19] I'm the power of his resurrection now
[1:21:22] look at the very next words that he's
[1:21:24] says and the fellowship of his
[1:21:27] sufferings wow so you mean Paul wanted
[1:21:30] to know him in the power of his
[1:21:31] resurrection how many of us stopped
[1:21:33] there what is the power of his
[1:21:34] resurrection well a deposit of that is
[1:21:37] Divine Healing and miracles every person
[1:21:39] we see healed my husband you're an
[1:21:42] absolute tremendous Miracles and things
[1:21:43] that the Lord did in the prayer line
[1:21:45] that I'd like to share with you and what
[1:21:47] is those healings and miracles it is a
[1:21:50] deposit of the Resurrection but Paul
[1:21:52] didn't just have that but this man had a
[1:21:55] peculiar desire that he wanted to enter
[1:21:58] in again the word Fellowship here's
[1:22:01] coinia it's a very popular word used
[1:22:03] among the charismatic Christians in this
[1:22:05] day they name their churches and their
[1:22:07] fellowships and so on after this it's
[1:22:09] the word koinia because it means joining
[1:22:12] together having something in common so
[1:22:15] Paul didn't just want signs wonders
[1:22:17] Miracles healings discernment and all
[1:22:19] that but Paul said I want to be the type
[1:22:22] of individual that if God looked for
[1:22:25] somebody to enter into Fellowship of
[1:22:28] suffering that I would not be one that
[1:22:31] would turn my back and run away but I
[1:22:33] want to be oh my I want to be one so in
[1:22:36] love with the Lord Jesus that he if he
[1:22:39] chose me to fellowship with him in
[1:22:42] suffering I would say here are my Lord
[1:22:46] anybody else in here the same way well I
[1:22:48] don't expect you to raise your hands one
[1:22:50] at one at a time but you'll think about
[1:22:51] it you will now notice that I may know
[1:22:54] him and the power of his resurrection
[1:22:56] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:22:59] being made conformable unto his deaths
[1:23:03] now he wanted to go so deep into the
[1:23:07] sufferings of Christ in this peculiar
[1:23:09] statement brother Paul that a man would
[1:23:11] desire to enter into the fellowship of
[1:23:15] Christ's sufferings even made to
[1:23:17] conformable to the deaths of the Lord
[1:23:19] Jesus Colossians chapter 1 verse 24 who
[1:23:24] now rejoice in my sufferings I want you
[1:23:27] he separates the sufferings of Christ
[1:23:29] and he identifies them as his own who
[1:23:32] now rejoice in my sufferings for you and
[1:23:36] Philip that which is behind of the
[1:23:39] afflictions of Christ
[1:23:42] in my flesh
[1:23:45] the afflictions of Christ
[1:23:50] in my flesh again it's like he's setting
[1:23:53] it for us that it's reliving
[1:23:56] brother Pete reliving the very
[1:23:59] afflictions of the Lord Jesus in his
[1:24:03] body this should help you to understand
[1:24:04] that this man when he first met the Lord
[1:24:07] Jesus and whatever he asked Lord who are
[1:24:10] you and he said I'm Jesus who you're
[1:24:13] persecuting
[1:24:15] how who was he persecuting the body of
[1:24:19] Christ so Christ was living out in his
[1:24:22] body in so much that he took the
[1:24:25] persecution that Paul was rendering to
[1:24:28] the church members the apostolic
[1:24:31] Christians and he said you are
[1:24:33] persecuting me
[1:24:36] If people could only get this in their
[1:24:38] head when you are persecuting or making
[1:24:42] it hard on a daughter of God
[1:24:45] you are persecuting the Lord Jesus
[1:24:50] when you are causing a son or daughter
[1:24:53] of God a hard time do you understand
[1:24:56] what you are doing you are making it
[1:25:00] hard personally
[1:25:02] on the Lord Jesus himself
[1:25:06] that ought to make us treat one another
[1:25:08] a whole lot better shouldn't it
[1:25:10] now notice that he says
[1:25:13] so I I've entered in let me go back and
[1:25:16] read it again who now rejoice in my
[1:25:19] sufferings for you and fill up that
[1:25:20] which is behind of the afflictions of
[1:25:23] Christ in my flesh for his body saved
[1:25:28] now Paul realizes much of what he's
[1:25:30] going through it's not just for himself
[1:25:32] but it's a joint Union of himself and of
[1:25:36] the church he said Christ in my flesh
[1:25:37] for his body's sake which is the church
[1:25:40] so Paul identifies the body of the Lord
[1:25:44] Jesus as the church so every person that
[1:25:48] persecutes you and I every person that
[1:25:51] lies and runs us down as burden and
[1:25:54] difficulty and so on they are
[1:25:56] persecuting the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:59] you imagine how it's going to be when
[1:26:01] they stand before in that day and he
[1:26:03] said hey why did you run me down why did
[1:26:06] you tell this line me why did you do
[1:26:08] this and that well Lord I've never even
[1:26:10] seen you oh yes you did because you've
[1:26:13] done that so Donnie you've done that to
[1:26:16] Paul you've done that to Janet you've
[1:26:18] done that to Carol you've done that to
[1:26:20] Zach you don't know that that wasn't you
[1:26:23] but it was me in my bride form
[1:26:27] so because you did that to them now
[1:26:30] you're going to answer to me for what
[1:26:33] you've done Lord God help me to never
[1:26:35] have to stand before the Lord that way
[1:26:37] and the church said
[1:26:39] so suffering look at it ah that little
[1:26:42] friend don't expect me to be able to
[1:26:44] explain to you how it all works because
[1:26:46] I don't understand it myself but
[1:26:48] suffering is the beaten path to Glory
[1:26:52] suffering is the beaten path to glory
[1:26:56] and that which will make it more and
[1:27:00] more and more glorious on that
[1:27:03] Resurrection morning you see Glory must
[1:27:06] have something to be able to compare
[1:27:09] itself against it's like we're living
[1:27:12] under the law of contrast so we have a
[1:27:14] day like and then before long we'll have
[1:27:16] night time we have Sunshine we have rain
[1:27:18] we have good days we have bad days we
[1:27:21] have days so we fill out my we never
[1:27:23] have a trial and on those other days you
[1:27:25] feel like you can't get your head above
[1:27:26] the water is that right what is that the
[1:27:28] law of contrast what will make your
[1:27:31] glory now I can't go in this two Farm
[1:27:33] because I don't go over your head but
[1:27:35] there will be a an element of God's
[1:27:38] glory the Greek word doesn't the New
[1:27:40] Testament used for Glory it's doxa and
[1:27:43] it is something about the personage of
[1:27:46] deity that will be shared with his
[1:27:49] people now I believe according to what
[1:27:52] happened to Moses out in the Old
[1:27:53] Testament that Moses entered into the
[1:27:55] pillar of fire when he come out they had
[1:27:57] to put a veil on Moses face because his
[1:28:01] flesh Shone with the glory of God and
[1:28:03] that was just the revealing of the law
[1:28:06] what would it be when we get our
[1:28:08] glorified bodies and we're in the
[1:28:10] presence of God what's one thing that's
[1:28:12] going to make you different as the bride
[1:28:13] than the church an anxious you living in
[1:28:16] the city it's going to be part of your
[1:28:19] appearance it's going to be part of you
[1:28:22] entering into the glory of God that
[1:28:25] which you bypass to come here as a
[1:28:28] mortal remember a mount Transfiguration
[1:28:29] what did Jesus do he was allowed to
[1:28:33] enter back into momentarily what he was
[1:28:37] before he became a human so he was
[1:28:40] allowed to enter into that Glory which
[1:28:44] he had with the Father which was his
[1:28:46] desire to go back into he said I
[1:28:48] proceeded forth and came from God and I
[1:28:51] go back to God not to his but another
[1:28:54] Throne ain't no two Thrones in heaven
[1:28:56] there's only one but he was God and he
[1:28:59] condescended from being that to become a
[1:29:02] man but it went back to being God again
[1:29:06] you were assault a part of God's Great
[1:29:09] thinking that is deity just like God's
[1:29:13] thought of Christ to us because God has
[1:29:16] thoughts in his mind that are only for
[1:29:19] time God has thoughts in his mind that
[1:29:22] are only about the universe and say
[1:29:24] certain things in our Earth that in the
[1:29:26] new Earth will not be here at all but
[1:29:29] there are other thoughts that God has in
[1:29:31] his mind which are Eternal they are
[1:29:34] identified in the godhead they are part
[1:29:38] of the godhead associated with him oh I
[1:29:41] wish somebody would hear me preach this
[1:29:43] morning if you have the true baptism of
[1:29:46] the Holy Ghost you know what that is
[1:29:48] that is your portion of the godhead
[1:29:52] oh what in the world are you talking
[1:29:54] about brother Donnie it is God himself
[1:29:57] living in you I'm talking about in a
[1:29:59] baptism I ain't talking about in a gift
[1:30:02] I'm talking about your portion of him
[1:30:05] remember you are Heirs of God which
[1:30:08] means you get God you don't get just a
[1:30:11] fine fancy Council to live in you don't
[1:30:14] get no Palace you get God himself
[1:30:17] praise the Lord but how how will we get
[1:30:21] to that that spot leaving from this
[1:30:23] Mortal life well suffering will be along
[1:30:26] the path by which we're projected up
[1:30:28] into that glory and the suffering in
[1:30:31] this life you see this is why the
[1:30:32] martyrs will receive what is identified
[1:30:35] in the New Testament as a Martyrs crowd
[1:30:37] you and I will never share that what's
[1:30:39] it mean it's got more stars it's got
[1:30:41] more gold more silver no but it is a
[1:30:43] reflection of the glory of God that they
[1:30:46] paid the ultimate price and you imagine
[1:30:49] now prophet of God that lived for years
[1:30:51] and years of his life and gave so much
[1:30:53] for the cause will you and I receive a
[1:30:55] reward like them absolutely not but
[1:30:58] every one of us will receive the reward
[1:31:00] that will match what we were here in
[1:31:03] time and some people's reward it will be
[1:31:06] given to them it will be great it will
[1:31:08] be exceeding and tremendous and because
[1:31:10] it was a preacher say and they lived
[1:31:13] their life for decades and they serve
[1:31:14] God's people and they went through so
[1:31:17] much stuff but most of what they went
[1:31:19] through were for the cause of Christ not
[1:31:22] for anything they done themselves so the
[1:31:24] Lord will reward them accordingly you
[1:31:27] understand there will be others they
[1:31:29] will be associated with the great
[1:31:31] Supernatural Miracle as a man in John 9
[1:31:33] that we look at last Sunday when the
[1:31:35] disciples said which one of these sin
[1:31:37] this man or his parents Jesus said
[1:31:39] neither but that the works of God might
[1:31:42] be made manifest in his life this man
[1:31:45] gave up years and years of seeing gave
[1:31:48] up years and years of a vocation gave up
[1:31:52] years and years of a family all types of
[1:31:55] things he gave up so the glory of God
[1:31:57] could be made manifest in his life he
[1:32:00] was never a preacher he was never a
[1:32:02] trustee he's fortunately no never a
[1:32:04] church-aged messenger but no doubt that
[1:32:06] man will be rewarded his life has been
[1:32:08] preached for 2 000 years we don't even
[1:32:11] know what his name was how many people
[1:32:14] has been healed by reading this story
[1:32:15] about this man in John 9. how many
[1:32:18] people have used this man as an
[1:32:20] encouragement God wrote in this man's
[1:32:23] life a great portion of his own glory
[1:32:26] and that man was just a poor blind
[1:32:29] beggar that no doubt people would walk
[1:32:31] by and they had all kinds of thoughts
[1:32:33] don't sit there and look at me like you
[1:32:34] don't do the same thing when you pass
[1:32:36] people on the side of the road and they
[1:32:38] got a sign we'll work God bless I'm a
[1:32:41] vet I'm this and that the other and part
[1:32:43] of them may be that you don't know but
[1:32:45] because there's people out there that's
[1:32:47] Liars we look at them and say yeah right
[1:32:49] he probably makes more money than I do I
[1:32:52] ain't giving him no dollar so what do
[1:32:54] you do you seek evil or you sing bad and
[1:32:57] then no doubt they did that man the same
[1:32:59] way that the glory of God could be made
[1:33:03] manifest in his life
[1:33:05] oh my goodness so you see what happens
[1:33:09] in in this life's journey as Paul is
[1:33:12] relating it here how the what he went
[1:33:14] through and that the glory of God was
[1:33:16] going to be revealed in him in such a
[1:33:19] great way so by wearing and bearing the
[1:33:23] cross we are being fitted for the crown
[1:33:28] by carrying your cross whatever that is
[1:33:32] you are being fitted for your crown
[1:33:37] if there is no cross there is no Crown
[1:33:42] can't you see why the multitudes that
[1:33:45] will live outside the city and many of
[1:33:47] them receive no reward whatsoever
[1:33:49] because their works are sown in concepts
[1:33:53] of denominational ideas which are not
[1:33:55] even scriptural they will be saved but
[1:33:59] they will live outside the city with no
[1:34:02] reward they will never be rewarded they
[1:34:06] don't even get the honor to live in the
[1:34:08] city itself but they will come up from
[1:34:11] New Moon to New Moon and Sabbath and so
[1:34:14] on and when they walk in the city watch
[1:34:17] some of the glory they're going to see
[1:34:19] you
[1:34:23] you imagine if they come up by them
[1:34:25] great gigantic Gates of pearl onto the
[1:34:28] streets of gold and they see some of the
[1:34:31] saints of God who are allowed to live
[1:34:33] inside this city all the time and they
[1:34:36] will see from your image projecting part
[1:34:39] of the glory of God little children that
[1:34:42] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[1:34:45] we know that when he shall appear we
[1:34:48] shall be
[1:34:50] like him like him how are we going to be
[1:34:54] like him we're going to have fingers
[1:34:55] we're going to have toes yeah but we are
[1:34:58] also going to Bear the image of the
[1:35:01] Shekinah Glory of God why because we
[1:35:05] have already already been sized for our
[1:35:09] Crown according to the size of our cross
[1:35:14] so in this age when people want the
[1:35:18] crown but they don't want to cross they
[1:35:21] don't want to be reproached for being a
[1:35:23] Christian Life God for being a Christian
[1:35:25] guess how big their Crown is same size
[1:35:28] as their cross
[1:35:31] so what about those that go through so
[1:35:34] much stuff for the glory of God not just
[1:35:35] preachers but Christians who bow the
[1:35:38] reproach and God identifies them perfect
[1:35:41] can you imagine the Lord Jesus that is
[1:35:44] sick person and they're in bed and
[1:35:45] they're going to this and that in the
[1:35:47] other and God has a purpose for their
[1:35:49] life a miracle that is in the making and
[1:35:52] that's actually Christ Jesus is
[1:35:54] identifying that person with bearing his
[1:35:57] own sufferings
[1:35:59] so it's as if Jesus himself is suffering
[1:36:02] again
[1:36:03] the sufferings of Christ
[1:36:08] don't be despondent you're being
[1:36:10] measured for your crown
[1:36:14] Oh Glory to God
[1:36:16] what about the body it becomes so
[1:36:18] difficult I know it does friends
[1:36:21] I know it can become so difficult
[1:36:24] I know that the pain whether physically
[1:36:27] psychologically mentally can be so
[1:36:30] difficult the reproach can be so hard to
[1:36:34] bear
[1:36:35] but how can I have confidence that God
[1:36:38] will will help me that he won't let me
[1:36:41] go through more than what I'm able to
[1:36:43] Bear well first of all his word tells us
[1:36:45] that
[1:36:46] secondly we can look at the examples
[1:36:49] that have been before us we can read
[1:36:52] sought in with the Old Testament and
[1:36:54] find of those great Patriarchs of Faith
[1:36:57] who live lives that were even without
[1:37:00] the spirit of God in the Old Testament
[1:37:01] but that love the Lord and God kept them
[1:37:05] and the church said
[1:37:07] if you haven't heard this message in a
[1:37:09] while it do you good to read it or
[1:37:11] listen to it this is one of my favorites
[1:37:14] and has been since I came to the message
[1:37:15] many many years ago and whenever I get
[1:37:18] kind of despondent life and down and all
[1:37:20] that sort of thing oh brother don't you
[1:37:22] mean you do yeah just like all the rest
[1:37:23] of you do I go to this one now the
[1:37:26] prophet preached this twice he preached
[1:37:28] it once in 1958 in Jeffersonville and he
[1:37:30] gave it a little different title and
[1:37:32] this one is the sunrise service in the
[1:37:34] 1960 and he entitled it I know done in
[1:37:38] the 1958 he called it I know my redeemer
[1:37:40] liveth now I want you to listen this and
[1:37:43] let us let us end up on this part here
[1:37:45] in a bit he could not drown Noah in the
[1:37:49] flood until the purpose of God had been
[1:37:54] finished now there's some words I want
[1:37:57] you to notice in these next few pages
[1:38:00] that we're going to share until
[1:38:02] and after
[1:38:04] and then we'll go to the next one until
[1:38:08] and after now watch he could not drown
[1:38:11] Noah in the flood until the purpose of
[1:38:15] God had been finished he could not burn
[1:38:19] up the children of Israel
[1:38:22] until the Hebrew children the purpose of
[1:38:26] God had been finished he could not kill
[1:38:29] job with boils and troubles
[1:38:33] until the purpose of God had been
[1:38:37] finished he kept my thought neither
[1:38:39] could the lions eat Daniel until God's
[1:38:44] purpose had been finished neither could
[1:38:47] death and old age take Abraham
[1:38:51] until the purpose of God had been
[1:38:55] finished now let's bring her home
[1:38:57] neither can he take you oh hallelujah or
[1:39:01] take me until the purpose of God of our
[1:39:06] life is finished so we gather from their
[1:39:10] consolation
[1:39:13] so Satan could not take Noah he could
[1:39:16] not take Abraham he could not take Isaac
[1:39:20] he could not take Sarah he cannot take
[1:39:23] you I think we need a certain notice on
[1:39:25] the devil today that we know where we
[1:39:28] are standing and we know our life is in
[1:39:31] the hands of almighty God the devil is
[1:39:33] not our Master we don't serve him he
[1:39:37] cannot do with us as he pleases he
[1:39:40] cannot take us until let me just go
[1:39:43] ahead and add a few more names the devil
[1:39:45] cannot take Dan Robbins until the devil
[1:39:49] is until God is done with it the devil
[1:39:51] cannot take Erica Parker until God is
[1:39:55] done with her the devil cannot take
[1:39:57] Michael Brown until God is done with it
[1:40:00] the devil cannot take peace losses he
[1:40:04] cannot take you or you or you or you
[1:40:07] until the purpose of God is God with
[1:40:10] your life so like it or not devil that's
[1:40:14] just the truth
[1:40:15] [Applause]
[1:40:25] anybody see which door he went out
[1:40:29] I want you to listen to this next quote
[1:40:32] why does God
[1:40:34] let troubles come
[1:40:37] God
[1:40:38] harnesses
[1:40:41] trouble what an odd statement
[1:40:45] so harness
[1:40:46] it's what you put on an animal
[1:40:51] to pull something
[1:40:53] or tote something
[1:40:55] a horse a mule if it's a small enough
[1:40:58] load a goat
[1:41:00] so you have a harness made
[1:41:03] and then you hook it to this animal
[1:41:06] and then the animal is to transport this
[1:41:10] whatever it is from point A to point B
[1:41:14] look at how the prophet of God
[1:41:15] identifies what trouble is why does God
[1:41:18] let troubles come he harnesses trouble
[1:41:29] I said stand still trouble
[1:41:34] and God puts bits
[1:41:37] in trouble's mouths
[1:41:40] now if you've ever had very many horses
[1:41:42] we all could have named one or two of
[1:41:43] them at least trouble
[1:41:45] because boy I tell you one thing when
[1:41:46] you head toward him with a bit some of
[1:41:48] them oh my goodness how they like to
[1:41:50] carry off you'll think that old plug
[1:41:52] horse ain't fit for nothing he won't do
[1:41:54] the same take the Bridle toward him and
[1:41:56] you'll see how much life he's got that
[1:41:58] right Brookfield yeah that's the way it
[1:41:59] is well sometimes God not an amazing
[1:42:02] that God doesn't harness healing God
[1:42:04] doesn't harness Miracles God doesn't
[1:42:06] Harner great finances and great pride
[1:42:09] and great arrogance and this and that
[1:42:11] and the other and God grabs a hold of
[1:42:12] Pride and say come here now let me set
[1:42:14] my preacher writer apparently let
[1:42:15] everybody yeah yeah yeah here he come
[1:42:18] Glory Glory Hallelujah oh my my that's
[1:42:21] what a lot of support and then God
[1:42:22] harnesses Pride come here pride and the
[1:42:24] preacher's gonna suffer oh
[1:42:30] you're a six foot pile of dirt and I
[1:42:32] call the rest of us
[1:42:34] but God harnesses trouble
[1:42:37] and then he puts bits
[1:42:40] troubles mouth a trouble saying
[1:42:44] all about
[1:42:46] and you're standing there scared to
[1:42:47] death because you said oh Lord that's my
[1:42:50] buggy
[1:42:53] why did God pick my burger and heart is
[1:42:56] trouble
[1:42:57] he's harnessing trouble go on papers
[1:43:01] God's harness and trouble to my buddy oh
[1:43:06] no I was wanting Prosperity I was
[1:43:08] wanting a new car I was wanting a new
[1:43:10] home I was wanting this out God God you
[1:43:14] got the wrong body that's by the
[1:43:16] Harrisburg eating not mine that's Sister
[1:43:18] Janice beg you Lord you got the wrong
[1:43:19] about you God said I know which buggy I
[1:43:21] want I've got the right buggy I've got
[1:43:24] the right trouble I've got the right
[1:43:26] difficulty but I've got the right
[1:43:29] in his mouth
[1:43:32] hmm
[1:43:36] so God harnesses trouble
[1:43:39] puts bits
[1:43:46] in its mouth
[1:43:51] and makes
[1:43:53] it
[1:43:55] obey him
[1:43:57] and somebody said
[1:43:59] and those troubles
[1:44:02] bring us
[1:44:05] into a closer Fellowship
[1:44:08] with God
[1:44:10] how many has had it to happen to you
[1:44:12] you pray Mormon you got trouble or more
[1:44:15] than you got less trouble
[1:44:17] which I'll praise the most
[1:44:20] you're probably the most and
[1:44:20] everything's going good right no
[1:44:22] hardships no difficult everybody loves
[1:44:24] you that's when you pray the most no you
[1:44:26] don't you pray the most whenever things
[1:44:28] that's going on that you don't
[1:44:29] understand things you think you can go
[1:44:31] through well God harness that trouble
[1:44:32] and God hits it up to your beautiful
[1:44:35] little Cadillac
[1:44:38] there have been no rainbow
[1:44:42] until
[1:44:44] look at this word until think of it oh
[1:44:48] my I was headed out the other day after
[1:44:50] these flooding rains that we've had and
[1:44:52] I was going out of the neighborhood
[1:44:53] there and I I took a picture always
[1:44:54] absolutely beautiful a rainbow saying
[1:44:56] almost vertical like like that and it
[1:44:58] was standing right up in the clouds The
[1:45:00] Creeks was flooded all kinds of stuff
[1:45:02] going on everywhere and I thought yeah I
[1:45:05] took a picture of it and sent it to
[1:45:06] Carolyn I said look God still remembers
[1:45:08] his promise she said yes he does and he
[1:45:10] still remembers his promise concerning
[1:45:12] our daughter too she said he's going to
[1:45:13] heal her make her well well that's her
[1:45:15] profession of Faith so God remember so
[1:45:18] that after all the storm that there had
[1:45:20] been no beautiful of the seven colors of
[1:45:22] the rainbow until
[1:45:25] the flood came
[1:45:27] after Noah was pressed into that
[1:45:30] condition he was in to float 40 days a
[1:45:33] night in a storm and a little art
[1:45:36] pitching up and down in the water it was
[1:45:39] after the flood was over that he saw the
[1:45:43] rainbow
[1:45:44] for its first time
[1:45:46] the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of
[1:45:50] promise at your head went through the
[1:45:53] tribulation then he saw the promise all
[1:45:57] friends I hope you understand today
[1:45:58] that's exactly the way God does in our
[1:46:00] life how we want to see a rainbow we
[1:46:03] want to see this we want to see that but
[1:46:05] before we can see that we've got to see
[1:46:07] these other things
[1:46:09] out your head went through the
[1:46:12] tribulation he saw the promise that's
[1:46:13] the way you see the Promise after you've
[1:46:17] gone through the tribulation it wasn't
[1:46:20] until the Hebrew children were forced
[1:46:23] into the fiery furnace one of the most
[1:46:26] outstanding trials they've seen one like
[1:46:28] the Son of God standing among them
[1:46:30] listen to this their troubles produced
[1:46:35] wow
[1:46:37] [Applause]
[1:46:40] their troubles produced did it for you
[1:46:44] sister Becky your trouble produced what
[1:46:46] the mighty Son of God how many of us is
[1:46:49] a witness here today that you went
[1:46:51] through this and that and the other but
[1:46:53] if it had not been for your trouble he
[1:46:55] wouldn't have showed up like he did
[1:46:57] Oh Glory to God came we see he will make
[1:47:00] all things work together for the good to
[1:47:03] them who love the Lord
[1:47:05] their troubles not their faith not their
[1:47:08] jumping not their shouting their
[1:47:11] troubles
[1:47:12] when it got absolutely to a spot it was
[1:47:15] totally impossible for any Earthly
[1:47:18] Deliverance
[1:47:21] can you imagine Florence Nightingale
[1:47:25] being so far gone
[1:47:28] oh my those of you that have seen the
[1:47:30] pictures of that woman when the prophet
[1:47:32] of God prayed for her it's hard to
[1:47:34] believe that a human being could live in
[1:47:36] that kind of state
[1:47:37] and yet the spirit of God something in
[1:47:41] her with no hope my my floor to South
[1:47:44] Africa and the spirit of God give the
[1:47:46] prophet an opportunity to be able to
[1:47:48] pray for and here come God in the form
[1:47:50] of a dove a little Dove sitting over
[1:47:53] there hallelujah what was it her trouble
[1:47:56] produced the son of God her trouble her
[1:48:00] sickness her disease her hopelessness
[1:48:03] her hopelessness produces Son of God or
[1:48:07] if we could only get it today we'd
[1:48:09] realize when we get down so low we say
[1:48:11] oh no we're too far gone there's no hope
[1:48:14] left yes there is he may have been
[1:48:17] waiting for that very time when your
[1:48:20] hopelessness would produce the greatest
[1:48:22] Miracle you've ever seen in your life
[1:48:25] oh thank you Lord thank you Lord
[1:48:32] their troubles produced the son of God
[1:48:36] standing among them in breezes
[1:48:40] to wave away the heat wave praise God
[1:48:43] but not until they went into the fire
[1:48:47] that that comforter appear
[1:48:51] so I wonder if we could gather them here
[1:48:53] today and ask him Shad wrapped me shock
[1:48:54] and Abednego was you boys terrified yes
[1:48:57] sir brother Donnie we were scared T
[1:48:58] totally to death we wasn't sure that our
[1:49:00] God would deliver us we didn't even know
[1:49:02] you know they said that we're not even
[1:49:04] sure our God will deliver us but that's
[1:49:05] one thing we do no we're not bound to
[1:49:07] that image we don't know for sure what
[1:49:09] he's going to do but if we'd say would
[1:49:11] y'all do it again again and again and
[1:49:13] again and again because what we saw in
[1:49:16] that fiery furnace has been preached
[1:49:17] about for thousands of years it was the
[1:49:19] most awesome thing you can imagine the
[1:49:21] men who threw us in there they were
[1:49:23] scalded they were like fried eggs and we
[1:49:25] went flying right in the middle of that
[1:49:27] we didn't even break out in the sweat as
[1:49:29] a matter of fact Brother Don you're
[1:49:30] sweating more than we was that day
[1:49:31] because all of a sudden we got inside of
[1:49:34] there and it was like a great big air
[1:49:35] conditioning I remember this was pre-air
[1:49:37] conditioned brother William so there was
[1:49:39] no AC inside of there and headed down
[1:49:41] about 55 but the spirit of God come down
[1:49:44] Hallelujah the spirit of God came down
[1:49:47] and began to Fan off him oh boys they
[1:49:49] said
[1:49:50] I'm getting a little chilly in here him
[1:49:52] I got a jacket
[1:49:54] and the Old Kingston on the outside said
[1:50:01] did not we cast them sorry
[1:50:04] they said that's true so great well he
[1:50:06] said how come it is I see four
[1:50:09] and the form of the force is like unto
[1:50:11] the Son of God it was their troubles
[1:50:13] that produced the manifestation of the
[1:50:16] son of God
[1:50:17] oh are there any Christians that want to
[1:50:20] be like them guys that God will allow
[1:50:23] you to go to an impossible State and
[1:50:26] allow you to go to a position where you
[1:50:28] think there's no way out absolutely no
[1:50:30] way and then Jesus says pardon me
[1:50:41] will glory glory
[1:50:44] well Hallelujah oh since I'm lame
[1:50:53] well they're still alive
[1:50:55] they're not fried like ribeyes they're
[1:50:57] not even like pork ribs they standing
[1:51:00] right up there and there's another one
[1:51:01] in the midst of them what in the world
[1:51:03] produced it their troubles
[1:51:06] or was somebody over here
[1:51:09] that was Daniel who purposed in his
[1:51:12] heart that he had not defiled himself
[1:51:13] with the things of the world I was
[1:51:16] forced through a trawl where they had
[1:51:18] prayed to God or go into a lion's den it
[1:51:21] was after the heat was put on and he was
[1:51:24] thrown into the lines then after that he
[1:51:28] saw the angel of the Lord standing in
[1:51:30] the midst of him
[1:51:36] Erica told me before service
[1:51:39] on the prayer line she said Daddy
[1:51:42] hope it don't sound selfish
[1:51:44] but I don't want to be the first one
[1:51:46] prayed for
[1:51:48] I said okay
[1:51:49] no problem
[1:51:52] she said my need is so great
[1:51:54] she said would you care to ask brother
[1:51:56] Ron
[1:51:57] brother Tim
[1:51:59] I know the anointing really gets to move
[1:52:00] it
[1:52:01] but he called for me there
[1:52:03] I said yep
[1:52:05] sure
[1:52:06] so I told Brother wrong before service
[1:52:07] he interns spoke to Brother JD
[1:52:10] he said Brother JD whenever I let you
[1:52:12] know
[1:52:13] bring her out
[1:52:14] so we pray for many I don't know how
[1:52:16] many we prayed for
[1:52:19] but you know what motivated him to call
[1:52:21] her
[1:52:23] because an angel was standing right
[1:52:25] there
[1:52:33] so when he comes great things happen
[1:52:42] not look friends I believe the angels of
[1:52:45] God are still Among Us
[1:52:48] he was seen at the other church this is
[1:52:51] twice has been seen at the new one
[1:52:55] I'm glad to be able to go to church or
[1:52:57] angels are welcome
[1:52:59] I'm really glad to go to church
[1:53:02] for our angels are welcome
[1:53:05] Hallelujah and it wasn't just for
[1:53:08] Erica's need that he showed up but there
[1:53:10] was many many others who had great needs
[1:53:13] and what did it do your needs about the
[1:53:18] angel of the Lord I believe they're
[1:53:20] right here this morning as a matter of
[1:53:22] fact I believe the Bible tells us they
[1:53:24] can't round about a smile when you go to
[1:53:26] work for that when you go to home
[1:53:28] they're there when you go to church so
[1:53:30] that they don't never leave you they all
[1:53:33] right there but there's certain times
[1:53:35] you need such a visitation and it is
[1:53:38] your distress it is your trouble it is
[1:53:41] your heart and your sorrow that brings
[1:53:44] them on the scene and they are there
[1:53:46] because of you
[1:53:50] Oh Glory to God
[1:53:54] I imagine as a man Daniel was afraid
[1:53:57] I imagine there's a man that he felt so
[1:54:00] alarmed how is it possible for anyone to
[1:54:04] ever live past them power of those
[1:54:06] mouths lions or their mouths and the
[1:54:09] breaking power of the force hundreds of
[1:54:12] pounds per square inch in their jaws as
[1:54:14] they would crush these bones
[1:54:17] but Daniel's need
[1:54:18] brought the angel of God well it's no
[1:54:21] less the day whenever the doctor said
[1:54:22] well I'll tell you one thing your report
[1:54:24] didn't come back very good we've got
[1:54:26] this and that and the other going on
[1:54:27] with you and I'm afraid you're at the
[1:54:29] end of your road and the angel said into
[1:54:30] the road that sounds like my cue that
[1:54:33] sounds like what I'm supposed to
[1:54:34] manifest myself right now I'm supposed
[1:54:36] to go down the end of the road last days
[1:54:38] uh prepare you're at the end of life yep
[1:54:41] sometimes that's it we want him to come
[1:54:42] and start start we want him to come even
[1:54:45] before one you know zero we wanted to
[1:54:47] come in Deliverance but what if he's got
[1:54:49] a purpose in mind that the glory of God
[1:54:52] will be magnified 50 times over if
[1:54:55] you'll bear something for three years if
[1:54:58] you would bear something for four years
[1:55:00] and it would bring him a thousand times
[1:55:03] more glory and make medical science
[1:55:07] testify we don't know
[1:55:12] we don't know
[1:55:14] like a man who got a prayer cloth from
[1:55:16] the prayer line here on Saturday night
[1:55:18] had one order 100 another 80 percent
[1:55:21] they did a stent and one is going back
[1:55:23] for the Nether and they took him in for
[1:55:24] the procedure took a prayer cloth and
[1:55:26] come back out my doctor said I don't
[1:55:27] know how to explain it and I don't know
[1:55:29] what's going on I don't know what took
[1:55:31] place but he don't need to see it no
[1:55:34] more well what was it it's a need it's a
[1:55:38] need and it brings him on the sea but
[1:55:41] we've got to have needs we've got to
[1:55:43] have hungers we've got to have desires
[1:55:45] and then we say Lord all right
[1:55:47] everything's set everything's fell
[1:55:49] through the buildings collapsed the
[1:55:51] walls just fell down no more doctors no
[1:55:53] more hope no more this no more that I'm
[1:55:56] on your hands Jesus I'm on your hands
[1:55:58] Jesus and that's why the prophet said
[1:56:00] you pray day and night you prayed I'm
[1:56:03] afraid I'll wear him out no I'll tell
[1:56:05] you what the prophet said about that
[1:56:06] when he's talking about the little woman
[1:56:07] that had the daughter that was so sick
[1:56:09] and also the woman of the unjust judge
[1:56:11] he said you say to Jesus he said Jesus
[1:56:13] are you getting tired of hearing me
[1:56:15] because I'm sure having a good time
[1:56:16] talking to you I'm talking day and night
[1:56:19] I'm talking in the noontime I ain't
[1:56:21] never gonna let this down till you
[1:56:22] answer me I'm on your hand that woman
[1:56:25] come to the unjustice she knocked and
[1:56:27] knocked and knocked and not whatever you
[1:56:29] got neither today don't pray one time
[1:56:31] and stop don't pray one time and quit
[1:56:33] keep on praying and pray it I'm praying
[1:56:36] I believe it I'm knocking I'm knocking
[1:56:39] Deliverance is on my way healing is on
[1:56:42] my way I will not give up I will not
[1:56:46] give up never
[1:56:53] listen
[1:57:00] the prophet said the Lions could not get
[1:57:02] him because it went through the trials
[1:57:04] and The Temptations and the troubles he
[1:57:07] knew that his God was able to deliver
[1:57:08] him from that
[1:57:10] it was Abraham after he'd seen the
[1:57:14] ground get Barren and the drought come
[1:57:17] and lots separate himself and go down to
[1:57:20] live deliciously into the world notice
[1:57:24] what all happened to Abraham the crown
[1:57:26] was Barren the Shepherds was fussing and
[1:57:28] fight the prophet tells us anything to
[1:57:31] our the Lord told us in 1960 he said I
[1:57:33] could just imagine Sarah that day she
[1:57:35] got up in a bad mood
[1:57:38] of course I don't have none of us but
[1:57:40] I'm just saying Sarah you know
[1:57:42] she got up in a bad mood that day and
[1:57:44] the crops is all bad there wasn't hardly
[1:57:46] no water
[1:57:48] and he said little did they know
[1:57:51] God had just come down
[1:57:53] the road a little ways
[1:57:56] and stepped into a human body
[1:58:00] but it's when everything was so far gone
[1:58:02] there was no hope
[1:58:05] it's amazing though when we get to that
[1:58:07] spot we're right at the last step before
[1:58:10] he delivers and we give up
[1:58:13] the very thing that's fixing to
[1:58:15] producing is the very thing we say well
[1:58:17] there's no hope
[1:58:22] on the Dickens Brothers wives had a
[1:58:24] dream this week about Erica and they
[1:58:26] said he wasn't saying it was the Lord
[1:58:27] anyone said it was God or nothing like
[1:58:28] that
[1:58:29] but she was in the hospital
[1:58:31] all of her family was gathered around
[1:58:33] her
[1:58:34] we was crying
[1:58:36] they basically give her no hope
[1:58:40] we couldn't hardly even understand
[1:58:41] anything just say it
[1:58:44] but from a faint voice she said
[1:58:47] I'm here
[1:58:50] I'm Healed I'm Healed
[1:58:59] I remember ordering and according to the
[1:59:02] dream she sat right straight up in the
[1:59:04] bed
[1:59:05] just our cat and said I'm here
[1:59:08] [Applause]
[1:59:10] and guess what she was here
[1:59:14] sometimes you get that while you say why
[1:59:16] does he do it
[1:59:18] that produces the son of God
[1:59:21] then he will have to make the doctor say
[1:59:24] and testify
[1:59:26] only God
[1:59:30] only God
[1:59:32] can do that
[1:59:35] I'm in heaven he today
[1:59:39] Oh Glory to God
[1:59:42] Hallelujah
[1:59:47] let's wear our heads if you would
[1:59:53] humanly we probably would all
[1:59:55] more than likely say we
[1:59:58] we don't really care for the way you do
[2:00:00] some of these things sometimes
[2:00:02] because unlike us
[2:00:04] you don't get nervous
[2:00:07] you don't get jittery
[2:00:09] but Lord we do
[2:00:11] we we just have to be honest we get
[2:00:13] nervous and when it gets down they're so
[2:00:15] close we think oh Lord
[2:00:17] are you going to show up or not
[2:00:20] I don't know why we do because you
[2:00:21] always do you always have
[2:00:24] you always show up on time
[2:00:27] but you know how we are as Mortals
[2:00:30] Lord God for every person that's
[2:00:32] standing here today and those under the
[2:00:33] sound of my voice wherever they are
[2:00:35] whatever they're going through
[2:00:38] maybe some of them right now
[2:00:40] those soldiers have got their hands on
[2:00:43] their arms
[2:00:44] and the furnace door is open
[2:00:46] and they're fixing to throw me
[2:00:48] maybe they're like Daniel
[2:00:51] the doors then been opened
[2:00:54] oh my
[2:00:55] and they've already been thrown in and
[2:00:57] standing there at the entrance to the
[2:00:58] door of the cave
[2:01:01] Shivers is running up and down his spine
[2:01:03] I said lions come toward him
[2:01:08] the Hebrew children and the fiery
[2:01:09] furnaces
[2:01:12] they feel the heat as they start to
[2:01:14] approach
[2:01:15] and the next thing they walk into this
[2:01:17] air-conditioned fiery field furnace
[2:01:21] as far as I know you're the only one
[2:01:23] who's ever been able to produce such a
[2:01:25] thing
[2:01:26] that the temperature was thousands of
[2:01:28] degrees by an internal fire
[2:01:31] and then men were as cool as cool now
[2:01:33] Lord that's that kind of cool I want to
[2:01:35] be this age wants to be cool that's what
[2:01:38] kind of cool I want that's the cool I
[2:01:41] want in the middle of my troubles

[2:01:45] my trials Lord God

[2:02:24] child at 35 and his wife at 25. but what
