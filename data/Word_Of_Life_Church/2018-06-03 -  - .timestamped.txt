[18:57] to get them to be Carter County people
[18:59] hope that'll work out don't know if that
[19:01] he will but I hope they will don't you
[19:02] go brother Brandon and his father a nice
[19:04] hand this morning as they get ready to
[19:06] sing for you
[19:21] enjoyed the service last night we
[19:24] enjoyed the message it's so true about
[19:28] fear I knew as a young man God had
[19:32] called me to minister but so many times
[19:36] we let fear be that guiding force you
[19:40] know we I kind of thought well I may not
[19:43] be as good as the next guy and I may
[19:49] make a mistake God said you probably
[19:52] will the devil kept saying well you're
[19:55] not worthy
[19:56] the Lord said you're right but he said
[20:00] because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[20:01] that was spilled
[20:02] I made you worthy so you never give a
[20:06] preacher that God has taken the fear
[20:09] away a mic so I appreciate I'd been sick
[20:15] back in the back in the winter and early
[20:18] spring and I appreciate all the prayers
[20:20] and about the last five or five weeks or
[20:24] so felt felt a lot better and also just
[20:27] like to praise the Lord for I've got a
[20:29] brother that has terminal lung cancer
[20:32] started in his throat thought they had
[20:36] it cleared up went to his lungs a little
[20:39] bit over a year ago but for about the
[20:42] last two months he's been completely off
[20:44] of oxygen he's off of his steroids
[20:49] they tried two medicines and each
[20:51] medicine the cancer grew each time and
[20:54] finally it come down to where they said
[20:58] we don't have any other choice there was
[21:00] no other medicine that's been proven
[21:02] that can help they said we've got two
[21:05] that will try one doctor even refused to
[21:08] try and he said I want to try he's got a
[21:12] little nine-year-old girl he said
[21:14] whatever I can do he went for a scan
[21:17] about two weeks ago he got his report
[21:20] and they said that the cancer had
[21:22] decreased by 50%
[21:25] I don't believe it was the medicine I
[21:27] believe was the hand of God you know my
[21:32] brother had run he had run from the Lord
[21:34] for many many years sometimes the Lord
[21:38] allows tragic things to happen in her
[21:43] life to get us where we need to be and
[21:46] so for the last four or five months he's
[21:51] been sitting in church he's giving life
[21:54] to the Lord he told me said in February
[21:58] he said the battle stopped he said I
[22:02] give up he said so I'm okay if God takes
[22:06] me and it's his will he said I'm fine
[22:09] with that but he said I'm glad that I'm
[22:11] still here and that God has given me
[22:14] another opportunity to live a few more
[22:17] days so I thank the Lord for that God
[22:20] still a healer I agree with the brother
[22:23] he said the world thinks we're crazy
[22:25] they do but let me be numbered among the
[22:29] crazy and I'll serve God with all of my
[22:33] crazy heart because he's worthy of our
[22:36] praise he's worthy to be honored I thank
[22:41] him that it's all him and none of me
[22:43] them
[22:43] the minister said last night he said
[22:45] right here it's all of it's all the Lord
[22:48] it's none of us and so I appreciate the
[22:52] Lord because he's been good to me he's
[22:54] blessed me just to know him in the
[22:58] fellowship and the fullness of his
[23:00] spirit to know God that that he has
[23:03] given us what we need in this dark age
[23:06] we are living in a dark age and so I
[23:09] appreciate the Lord for his love and for
[23:11] his great mercy

[23:24] the fountain

[37:32] question we're going to look at that
[37:33] today for we wrestle not notice this it
[37:37] doesn't say that we don't wrestle
[37:39] because we do it's not what Paul's
[37:42] saying he's saying we don't wrestle we
[37:44] don't fight we don't we don't war no we
[37:46] do war but we don't war against flesh
[37:49] and blood issues or flesh and blood
[37:52] problems or flesh and blood addictions
[37:57] you may have addictions people may be
[37:59] addicted but the problem is not a flesh
[38:02] and blood issue but we wrestle against
[38:05] principalities against powers against
[38:09] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[38:12] against spiritual wickedness in high
[38:15] places
[38:18] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[38:21] of God that you may be able to withstand

[38:33] with truth and having on the breastplate
[38:35] of righteousness and your feet shod with
[38:38] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[38:40] above all taking the shield of faith
[38:43] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[38:46] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[38:50] take the helmet of salvation and the
[38:53] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[38:56] God praying always with all prayer and
[38:59] supplication in the spirit and watching
[39:01] thereunto with all perseverance and
[39:04] supplication for All Saints and for me
[39:07] that other utterance may be given unto
[39:10] me that I may open my mouth boldly to
[39:12] make known the mystery of the gospel 2nd
[39:16] Corinthians chapter 2 one more scripture
[39:18] will have you be seated second
[39:21] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11
[39:31] we'd like to speak to you this morning
[39:33] on a title dimensional discernment
[39:38] dimensional discernment less Satan verse
[39:42] 11 of 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11
[39:44] lest Satan should get an advantage of us
[39:48] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[39:55] amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[39:58] this morning God that you've gathered us
[40:00] and assembled us here again Lord under
[40:04] that name that is above every name Lord
[40:06] it's higher than any sickness higher
[40:09] than any disease Lord that name is
[40:12] higher than any addiction Lord or
[40:16] problem that we could face today Lord so
[40:19] we lay all of our burdens at the feet of
[40:21] Jesus this morning Lord you told us cast
[40:25] your cares upon me for I careth for you
[40:28] so we cast them down Lord Jesus this
[40:31] morning we lay them down Lord and I pray
[40:34] God that you would just come speak word
[40:36] Lord a word of refreshment to your body
[40:39] Lord may we just be attentive to the
[40:41] Word of God that goes forth Lord I pray
[40:44] that you would bind every evil spirit
[40:46] that would try to hinder the preaching
[40:48] of your word this morning Lord may you
[40:51] bind every evil spirit that would try to
[40:53] hinder the receiving of that word Lord
[40:56] in the bringing forth I pray God you
[40:58] would be with us Lord in this church
[41:00] this morning we ask in Jesus Christ's
[41:03] name amen you can be seated this morning
[41:08] dimensional discernment we like to look
[41:11] at and and and just for a few minutes
[41:14] here to look at this multi-dimensional
[41:17] world that we live in and the first part
[41:19] of this will just be laying a foundation
[41:21] so just stay real attentive this morning
[41:24] is we'll be going through this quickly
[41:26] through some scriptures and some things
[41:28] the Prophet had to say about this but
[41:31] what we need to have happen this morning
[41:33] and if I could accomplish this purpose
[41:35] it would be to have our spiritual eyes
[41:38] opened because Paul said we shouldn't be
[41:41] ignorant of Satan
[41:43] devices that when he speaks of devices
[41:47] he's speaking that Satan has a plan or a
[41:50] tactic or a scheme and the prophet of
[41:53] God says it this way that overcoming is
[41:55] recognizing the devil's tactics to
[41:58] recognize the devil's schemes and he's
[42:01] got a playbook that he's playing by just
[42:04] as two teams that would face each other
[42:05] the one team would study the weaknesses
[42:08] and the strengths of the other team and
[42:10] they would literally devise a plan or a
[42:13] playbook to exploit the areas of
[42:16] weakness in the other team and Satan has
[42:19] devised the playbook against humanity
[42:22] against God's people and he wants to
[42:25] enact those plays and he wants to enact
[42:27] his schemes but Paul said we should have
[42:30] wisdom our spiritual eyes should be open
[42:33] so that we're not ignorant of Satan's
[42:36] tactics were not ignorant of his devices
[42:43] oh no brother Matt don't go there Paul
[42:48] says were not ignorant of his devices
[42:50] were not ignorant of his tactics but
[42:54] what we're speaking of when we speak on
[42:55] dimensional discernment is understanding
[42:59] that there is a kingdom understanding
[43:01] the kingdom of the devil and of Satan
[43:04] understanding the reality that there is
[43:07] angels and there is demon spirits and
[43:10] that there's demons that are lurking in
[43:12] another world in another dimension that
[43:16] tries to influence you every day of your
[43:18] life angels both good and bad a bad
[43:22] angel is called a demon spirit that's
[43:25] what a demon is it's a fallen angel an
[43:28] angel has a free will they have the
[43:31] ability to make a choice their disk
[43:33] their their their position that God gave
[43:35] them was to be a messenger and they can
[43:38] have a choice to choose to deliver that
[43:41] message or to rebel against God we're
[43:44] told in the scripture very clearly that
[43:46] angels rebelled against God and against
[43:49] heaven and that they left their own Jude
[43:52] says that they left their first estate
[43:54] they left their habitation and those
[43:57] angels that were good angels created for
[44:00] good purposes became bad with bad
[44:02] intents and they become demon spirits
[44:06] what the Apostle Paul is saying here in
[44:09] Ephesians 6 is that there's a real
[44:10] struggle a real battle a real war that's
[44:14] taking place and it's not against flesh
[44:17] and blood it's not a physical what we
[44:19] need to understand and as mature
[44:22] Christians today is that no matter what
[44:24] issue you bring up today no matter what
[44:27] problem or sin or disease or addiction
[44:31] that it's not a flesh and blood battle
[44:33] that you're facing today but it's a
[44:36] spiritual battle and it's a real battle
[44:39] that's really taking place right now in
[44:41] another dimension Paul says that we
[44:44] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[44:47] against principalities against powers
[44:49] against spiritual wickedness in high
[44:52] places that word high places that Paul
[44:56] is speaking
[44:57] that is another dimension it's it's an
[44:59] atmosphere that we wrestle our war our
[45:02] struggle every day as a believer as a
[45:05] Christian and sometimes we can get
[45:07] confused and think that were we're
[45:09] dealing with real sit with with sin that
[45:11] is physical or we physically fall or we
[45:14] physically say the wrong thing but what
[45:16] you have to understand as a believer is
[45:19] that there was a spiritual influence
[45:21] that caused the natural response or
[45:24] action of doing the wrong thing
[45:27] that before you said the wrong thing
[45:29] there was a spirit in another dimension
[45:31] that influenced you whether you seen it
[45:35] or didn't see it or heard it or didn't
[45:37] hear it there was a spiritual action or
[45:40] pressure or influence that you're
[45:43] subjected to as a believer that causes
[45:45] every bad action are you with me here
[45:50] this morning and you may look at
[45:52] addictions today and you may look at a
[45:53] person who has a nicotine addiction or a
[45:56] drug addiction or a sex addiction or
[45:58] some addiction to popularity or money or
[46:01] fashion and you may look at those things
[46:03] and and think we're struggling against
[46:05] alcohol and if we could just defeat the
[46:07] alcohol the person may be addicted by it
[46:10] by a spirit of alcoholism but what you
[46:13] have to understand is that that's not
[46:16] alcoholism that you're facing or you're
[46:18] battling but it's a spirit a demon
[46:21] spirit that for some reason that person
[46:24] has given access to that demon to dwell
[46:27] inside of their spirit and that demon
[46:30] builds a stronghold in that man's life
[46:33] and we label it alcoholism but it's a
[46:39] stronghold a drug addiction is a
[46:41] stronghold a sex addiction is a
[46:43] stronghold no matter what you face today
[46:46] and are tempted within your flesh it is
[46:48] a spiritual battle taking place in an
[46:51] angelic dimension and you are call in
[46:54] the middle of a good influence coming
[46:56] from above and a bad influence coming
[46:59] from beneath and every single day your
[47:02] mission is to have victory in a
[47:05] dimension that you can't see and that
[47:07] can't feel and that you can't touch but
[47:09] it's taking place and the battle and the
[47:12] struggle is to get victory in that
[47:15] dimension hallelujah are you here today
[47:19] so we as believers need to understand
[47:21] that these problems are not
[47:22] flesh-and-blood issues but they're
[47:24] spiritual wickedness in high places and
[47:30] you could be demon-possessed
[47:33] today in this church sitting here
[47:35] hearing the Word of God you could be and
[47:41] so you can fight it in Jude that the
[47:43] scripture tells us that there's real
[47:45] angels the Bible says that they kept
[47:48] there they kept not their dwelling place
[47:50] but they left their own habitation and
[47:53] what we realized is that the demonic
[47:55] world is a real world the underworld is
[47:58] real it's not some Hollywood film that
[48:01] they create and they create my evil evil
[48:04] things that you see today produced by
[48:05] Hollywood even just the labels and the
[48:08] and and the images that they create
[48:10] they're tapping into another dimension
[48:12] that is a real dimension it's not fake
[48:15] it's not man thinks that they've created
[48:17] this world and their imagination and
[48:20] they think they crown them and give them
[48:21] a prizes and awards and say oh you you
[48:24] you you you acted so great in that film
[48:27] and you played that part so well in that
[48:29] film we're going to give you a an Oscar
[48:31] we're gonna give you an award what they
[48:32] don't realize is that the ability was
[48:35] given by a spirit who anointed that
[48:37] individual and gave them an inspiration
[48:40] to play a part to deceive the world no
[48:46] matter what you look at in the news
[48:47] today and you read about mass shootings
[48:49] in a every single day it seems like we
[48:52] turn on the news and there's another
[48:53] school shooting and someone's went up in
[48:55] the school and shot the shot people and
[48:58] and turns on fire alarms and as people
[49:00] are running outside
[49:01] it's gunning people down and you ask
[49:03] what happened was that person just a bad
[49:05] apple did they did they just have a
[49:07] messed up childhood no my brother
[49:09] it is demonic oppression that has
[49:12] literally infiltrated the minds of
[49:14] humanity to where the only
[49:16] thing that keeps an unconverted person
[49:18] sane is low in order and rules and
[49:22] regulations but by nature they are
[49:25] literally a beast by nature and more
[49:28] than ever before you're living in a
[49:30] world that the Prophet would call an age
[49:32] of total neurotics the brother madam
[49:35] said the world I promised I will go to a
[49:37] place to where they go completely insane
[49:41] and we're seeing the manifestation of it
[49:44] today it's the because you say why is it
[49:47] brother Matt why does that happen
[49:48] because a book but they've disregarded
[49:52] and then they've taken out of their
[49:53] schools but they've take it out of there
[49:55] and people don't want to preach it
[49:56] anymore but a book prophesied in the
[49:59] book of Revelation and said that the
[50:01] demon the dragon has unleashed forces
[50:04] and unleashed his wrath upon humanity it
[50:07] was prophesied in Scripture and it's
[50:10] happening before our very eyes the
[50:15] scripture says that that D that dragon
[50:17] has unleashed his wrath and fury the
[50:20] Bible says it this way that Satan has
[50:23] poured out his wrath because he knoweth
[50:26] that he hath but a short time and as the
[50:32] time gets shorter and shorter
[50:35] he gets angrier he gets more desperate
[50:38] and what you're seeing today is
[50:39] desperation attempts trying everything
[50:42] he can to for it the plan of God but it
[50:45] won't be thwarted no weapon formed
[50:48] against this church shall prosper
[50:50] no tactic and no scheme that Satan wants
[50:52] to plan our devised or give us devices
[50:55] by but God's bride I'll have a
[50:57] supernatural discernment of a dimension
[50:59] of another world she'll be so on fire
[51:02] with the Holy Ghost and so rested there
[51:04] will be the Bride of Christ brother
[51:06] Branham said it this way she'll be in
[51:08] the very image of Jesus Christ
[51:12] her senses will be exercised to discern
[51:15] both good and evil so the scripture says
[51:20] what is it what the Bible teaches us is
[51:22] we just have to not get ahead of
[51:24] ourselves this morning but that there's
[51:26] the Bible what we understand from the
[51:28] scripture is that there's a real world
[51:31] there's real beings called angels
[51:35] intelligent creatures in the world that
[51:38] are supernatural beyond our human senses
[51:42] and they are there all the time I'm not
[51:48] just speaking of demon spirits I'm
[51:49] speaking of angelic spirits also but
[51:52] there's spirits all the time what the
[51:56] scripture teaches is then Jesus you see
[51:58] dealt with these even in his earthly
[51:59] ministry he deals with some of these
[52:02] spirits a demonic oppression and men
[52:05] people that were totally possessed and
[52:07] couldn't even speak they were so
[52:08] possessed by an evil spirit what the
[52:11] Bible teaches us is that there's good
[52:13] angels and there's bad angels and that
[52:15] you as a present believer are literally
[52:18] surrounded by a spiritual host of good
[52:22] and wickedness at all times and there
[52:25] are certain conditions that you can
[52:28] create that allow or invite the wrong
[52:31] spirit and there are certain conditions
[52:34] that you can create that invite or allow
[52:38] the right spirit that's why we don't go
[52:44] to certain places why because we're
[52:49] inviting the wrong spirit but there are
[52:52] certain places that we do go like Church
[52:55] why we're inviting the right spirit
[52:59] right
[53:00] and so these bad angels are not what we
[53:04] learn is there not in some underworld or
[53:06] some lair are somewhere way below that
[53:09] if you dig far enough you'll eventually
[53:10] come to the demons domain that demon
[53:13] spirits are not in some other world or
[53:16] other some millions of millions of miles
[53:18] away but what we learn
[53:20] that they're just right here right now
[53:23] just in another dimension and the real
[53:29] battle taking place right now is not
[53:31] happening on earth in a flesh and blood
[53:33] battle but it's happening in heavenly
[53:36] places got this chart here that if the
[53:39] brothers can just display it's a very
[53:41] busy chart and you may not be able to
[53:43] get too much from it the image that I
[53:46] had displayed the very first one but it
[53:48] just goes to show some our brother in
[53:50] the Philippines crater if you ever if
[53:52] you want it you can get with me I can
[53:54] get it to you it's a great way to
[53:55] describe the multi-dimensional
[53:58] environment that man lives in yeah
[54:01] brother you could go ahead and display
[54:02] that one that you got there yep it does
[54:05] it display it shows how that man lives
[54:07] in a multi-dimensional environment if
[54:10] you can't get it that's okay but where
[54:12] are we as humans are subjected to this
[54:15] environment at all times and this chart
[54:18] shows the different dimensions that we
[54:21] have here you notice over to that what
[54:23] would be your left you have the first
[54:25] dimension being liked the second
[54:27] dimension being matter and the third
[54:29] being time and you'll see how that the
[54:32] fourth dimension is this blue strip that
[54:35] goes from the very bottom all the way to
[54:37] the top and this is that fourth
[54:39] dimension that interacts with all of the
[54:42] dimensions that exist and that fourth
[54:44] dimension brother branham called science
[54:46] this is where television exists this is
[54:49] where internet radio waves science
[54:53] always is moving within and without even
[54:56] right now as I'm speaking to you today
[54:58] there is horrible images images you
[55:01] would never want to see that are
[55:03] flashing through this room right now
[55:05] there's voices that are taking place can
[55:08] you hear them can you see those images
[55:12] right now no no you can't there's
[55:14] ballgames in sports that are taking
[55:16] place and literally there's an image
[55:19] going across this room right now but you
[55:21] can't see them
[55:23] you can't hear them but if I take then
[55:26] place the right device that can tune
[55:29] into that dimension you would suddenly
[55:33] the images that are moving through this
[55:35] room now they were there all the time
[55:38] they didn't just suddenly appear if I
[55:40] was the stick of television right here
[55:41] and turn it on they wouldn't just
[55:43] magically appear but they were there
[55:45] before I turned the TV on the only
[55:47] difference was is that something I play
[55:50] something in front of you that have the
[55:52] ability and in a crystal to tune in to
[55:56] that other dimension are you with me
[56:01] here this morning it's the same exact
[56:03] way when the worship service begins to
[56:05] go and songs are being saying some
[56:07] people are literally existing and
[56:10] singing the songs of Zion in a physical
[56:13] dimension only but others are tapping
[56:15] out of this dimension and turning a
[56:18] crystal in their own spirit and type it
[56:20] into another dimension and those are the
[56:23] ones that are really worshiping God in
[56:26] spirit and in truth what is it it's
[56:29] worship from another dimension I want to
[56:33] be one of those worshipers I don't just
[56:35] want to be trapped here in this physical
[56:37] world of pain and sickness and problem
[56:39] but when I worship the Lord I want to
[56:41] move out of this world into a world that
[56:44] maybe I can't see with my eyes or hear
[56:46] with my ears but my spirit is tuned and
[56:49] synched with that dimension hallelujah
[56:54] and you have that fifth dimension the
[56:56] underworld brother branham says it this
[56:58] way that right underneath this dimension
[57:00] and underneath this realm of humans is
[57:02] the realm of the regions of the lost and
[57:05] just below that is the river the region
[57:08] of demon spirits and he says it this way
[57:10] that right below that is the very lair
[57:12] our kingdom of Satan Hell itself and
[57:17] then you're here caught in this realm
[57:20] and this light and matter in time but
[57:23] just above that is the sixth dimension
[57:26] where paradise is it's where the prophet
[57:29] went to and remember he said I've seen
[57:31] real bodies real people I was looking
[57:33] back at my body laying on a bed
[57:35] I was watching what was it he had
[57:37] stepped
[57:38] of that dimension he didn't know a
[57:40] million miles he didn't get on a car or
[57:43] our-our-our a plane and fly somewhere he
[57:46] literally changed the mentions and there
[57:49] was other people who was walking healthy
[57:51] without issues without problems without
[57:54] sickness without paying they were living
[57:56] real life it's just another dimension
[58:04] and then right above that as that
[58:06] seventh dimension called heaven where
[58:08] God dwells and what we understand
[58:11] through the teaching of the message is
[58:13] that man lives in this multi-dimensional
[58:16] environment and were subject to those
[58:18] seven dimensions around us at all times
[58:21] what we learn is that heaven and hell is
[58:24] not some million miles away but it's
[58:27] just across the chasm and when we die we
[58:33] don't go somewhere on a trip we don't
[58:36] get on a plane and fly off somewhere we
[58:38] don't get on some fast car and go and go
[58:40] off somewhere millions of miles away but
[58:42] the Prophet says when we die we just
[58:44] change dimensions that's it and the only
[58:52] thing we take all of our possessions
[58:54] stay in this dimension but our character
[58:57] comes in this dimension that's why every
[59:01] sermon that's preached the Holy Spirit
[59:04] is trying to work on your character he's
[59:06] trying to work on your spirit he's
[59:07] trying to work on your life what is it
[59:09] it's the only thing valuable rather you
[59:12] can't take that car you can't take that
[59:14] house you can't take that bank account
[59:16] but there's what else you can't take you
[59:18] can't take your problems you can't take
[59:20] your sicknesses you can't take that back
[59:22] pain over there you can't take those
[59:24] headaches that disease you can't take it
[59:26] over there
[59:27] the only thing over there is life real
[59:30] life's real living real joy real
[59:33] happiness
[59:34] Oh somebody say praise the Lord this
[59:38] morning ain't gonna take any my troubles
[59:42] but I'm not gonna take some million mile
[59:45] journey I'm just gonna change dimensions
[59:48] as the song says I'll speed up just a
[59:52] little bit and now slow down so the
[59:57] prophet teaches this if you're a
[59:59] Christian and you've been born again
[1:00:01] when you die you go to a place called
[1:00:03] the sixth dimension place of paradise
[1:00:05] where the dead in Christ await and goes
[1:00:08] back to being young again and to a
[1:00:12] celestial body waiting for the day when
[1:00:16] Christ shall come back to earth again in
[1:00:18] a rapture to pick up that body that you
[1:00:21] left behind and we literally will raise
[1:00:25] our mortal body and that theophany body
[1:00:29] and mortal body will make up one body
[1:00:32] called the glorified body well raised it
[1:00:38] in a raise from the dust of the earth to
[1:00:40] a body that's immortal and incorruptible
[1:00:43] in a glorified body one that's not
[1:00:47] limited that's the body Christ wants to
[1:00:52] get you to but if you're a sinner and
[1:00:55] you die and you missed or you didn't see
[1:00:58] the gospel of Jesus Christ and you've
[1:01:01] rejected it maybe you've never rejected
[1:01:03] it by saying I don't believe it or
[1:01:05] blaspheme dydt but you never took the
[1:01:08] opportunity or the chance to get your
[1:01:11] life wrapped up in Christ and die from
[1:01:14] your old man and be regenerated unto a
[1:01:16] new birth by the Holy Spirit by the
[1:01:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and if you die
[1:01:21] in that condition and you died without
[1:01:24] repented of your sins and never
[1:01:27] receiving Christ you go to a place
[1:01:29] called the fifth dimension there on the
[1:01:33] chart you have it that dark place that
[1:01:36] fifth dimension where the souls of the
[1:01:39] wicked are imprisoned awaiting the great
[1:01:42] white throne judgment to be judged
[1:01:45] according to the deeds done in their
[1:01:48] body
[1:01:49] brother brandon says it this way and the
[1:01:51] brothers had the quote he says no light
[1:01:53] matter and time and our five senses
[1:01:57] contact film dimensions light matter and
[1:02:01] time our sight contacts light our
[1:02:06] feeling contacts matter and so forth now
[1:02:09] he says but we have contact through
[1:02:12] science the fourth dimension as it was
[1:02:16] because coming right through this
[1:02:19] building right now comes pictures voices
[1:02:26] of radio pictures on television that our
[1:02:30] senses does not contact that but yet
[1:02:33] they have a tube or a crystal that picks
[1:02:35] up those ether waves and manifests them
[1:02:38] so you see right in this building this
[1:02:41] is from present stage in my ministry
[1:02:42] right in this building right now and
[1:02:46] this building is live actions of people
[1:02:49] in the air live voices they're here we
[1:02:54] know it they're absolutely the truth and
[1:02:58] the only thing you do they catch it on I
[1:03:00] don't understand the mechanics of those
[1:03:02] things that science has invented but we
[1:03:04] know that it proves to us there is a
[1:03:08] fourth dimension now the fifth dimension
[1:03:12] is where the sinner goes the fifth
[1:03:16] dimension is the kind of well the
[1:03:18] horrible dimension now this man when a
[1:03:22] Christian dies he goes into the sixth
[1:03:25] dimension and God is in the seventh
[1:03:26] dimension now then you see the Christian
[1:03:30] when he dies he goes under the altar of
[1:03:33] God right into the presence of God
[1:03:36] hallelujah
[1:03:37] under the altar and he's at rest to
[1:03:43] break it down when a man has a nightmare
[1:03:45] he's not altogether asleep neither is he
[1:03:48] awake he's between sleep and awake and
[1:03:51] that's what makes him have a horrible
[1:03:54] shaking and screaming because he's not
[1:03:56] asleep he's not awake and
[1:03:59] take that it shows where a man goes when
[1:04:02] he dies unconverted he's lived his time
[1:04:06] up he's dead on earth and he cannot go
[1:04:11] into the presence of God because he's
[1:04:13] not fit to go there without the blood
[1:04:15] he's called my goodness he's caught he
[1:04:22] can't come back to earth because as
[1:04:24] times finished here on earth he's caught
[1:04:26] between he's in a nightmare see he can't
[1:04:31] go in the presence of God to rest he
[1:04:34] can't come back come to earth because
[1:04:36] his time's up he's in a nightmare and
[1:04:38] there he stays until the day of judgment
[1:04:42] a horrible thing to be in and now in
[1:04:44] this vision I believe I was called to
[1:04:46] that sixth dimension looking back down
[1:04:49] here
[1:04:50] I could see back see sight isn't exactly
[1:04:55] with the eyes that's earthly but sight
[1:04:58] is a greater thing than that the sight
[1:05:02] that they have there their contact is
[1:05:05] far beyond any contact that our natural
[1:05:09] senses would contact so what is this
[1:05:14] other dimension it's another place it's
[1:05:16] another world it really exists right now
[1:05:19] the only difference is is that you don't
[1:05:21] have the tool or the crystal to tune in
[1:05:25] to be able to see with your two eyes
[1:05:27] that are the dimension but it's there
[1:05:29] all the time it's there all the time
[1:05:33] no matter what you see or what you feel
[1:05:35] or you maybe you say I can't I can't see
[1:05:37] it today but it's here right now the
[1:05:39] fourth dimension proves that it even
[1:05:43] right now there's voices there's people
[1:05:45] there's images the brother Bantam says
[1:05:46] that there's actions moving right
[1:05:48] through this room right now and if you
[1:05:50] take the right instrument it Tunes in to
[1:05:53] that other dimension and God sent a
[1:05:57] prophet who had an instrument to where
[1:05:59] he could see past what you see with your
[1:06:01] own two eyes and he could peer into
[1:06:04] another world or another dimension and
[1:06:07] then use his voice to try to describe it
[1:06:10] and
[1:06:10] use our imagination as we tried to
[1:06:13] imagine it but it's a real place Jesus
[1:06:18] dealt with this even in his ministry you
[1:06:21] notice some of these spirits the Bible
[1:06:22] says in Matthew 4:20 for his fame went
[1:06:25] throughout all Syria they brought unto
[1:06:27] him all sick people that were taken with
[1:06:29] diverse diseases and torments and those
[1:06:32] which were possessed with devils and
[1:06:33] those which were lunatic and those that
[1:06:35] had the palsy and He healed them let's
[1:06:37] turn over to mark chapter 5 quickly if
[1:06:40] you have your Bible I didn't knot it and
[1:06:42] give you this a brother so if you just
[1:06:43] want to stay right there if you have
[1:06:44] your Bible let's turn there today mark
[1:06:50] chapter 5 verse 1 that came over onto
[1:06:54] the other side of the sea end of the
[1:06:56] country of the gadarenes and when he was
[1:06:58] come out of the ship immediately there
[1:07:00] met him a man immediately met him out of
[1:07:03] the tombs a man with an unclean spirit
[1:07:06] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[1:07:10] no man could bind him no not with chains
[1:07:12] because that he had been oft bound with
[1:07:15] fetters and chains and the chains had
[1:07:18] been plucked asunder by him and the
[1:07:19] fetters broken in pieces neither could
[1:07:21] any man tame him always day and night he
[1:07:25] was in the mountains in the tombs crying
[1:07:27] cut of himself with stones but when he
[1:07:31] saw notice who he's talking about he's
[1:07:34] not referring to Legion because Legion
[1:07:38] is the spirit the name of the demon
[1:07:40] spirits that are and that are possessing
[1:07:43] the man he's speaking about the man are
[1:07:47] you with me notice what he says he says
[1:07:51] and when he had his dwelling among the
[1:07:52] tunes and and and in verse verse 5 and
[1:07:55] always day and night he was in the
[1:07:57] mountains verse 6 but when he who he
[1:08:00] this man the man before he was possessed
[1:08:03] before he had demon spirits he was a
[1:08:05] good man he had good intentions maybe he
[1:08:08] came to church he wanted to serve God he
[1:08:11] was a good person in his heart and his
[1:08:13] core he was a good individual he didn't
[1:08:18] start off bound and the scripture says
[1:08:22] in verse 6
[1:08:24] but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran
[1:08:27] and worshipped him what was it any cried
[1:08:34] with a loud voice now what happens now
[1:08:36] you see the difference between humanity
[1:08:38] and add angelic world because the man is
[1:08:42] going to worship but the Spirit is going
[1:08:44] to despise and speak against Jesus verse
[1:08:49] 7 and he cried with a loud voice and
[1:08:50] said what have I to do with thee Jesus
[1:08:52] thou son of the Most High God I adjure
[1:08:56] thee by God that thou torment me not
[1:09:00] it's almost an oxymoron in verse 60 s
[1:09:03] worshiping in verse 7 he s cursing him
[1:09:06] now this man didn't start off this way
[1:09:09] this man started off a good man bondage
[1:09:12] and chains that he had physically the
[1:09:15] chains that you could physically see
[1:09:16] they didn't start there but what started
[1:09:19] was changed in his spirit and trains in
[1:09:22] his mind as he fed on that addiction and
[1:09:24] he fed on that spirit and he fed on the
[1:09:27] wrong thing and he watched the wrong
[1:09:28] thing he said their own thing and he
[1:09:30] refused to heed the voice of God and
[1:09:33] eventually that spirit literally
[1:09:36] possessed his body he was literally
[1:09:42] possessed by a demon spirit notice what
[1:09:48] it says here do you realize that that
[1:09:49] when you become possessed by a demon
[1:09:52] spirit it's the same when you receive
[1:09:54] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:55] what is receiving the Holy Ghost it is
[1:09:58] the Spirit of God literally possessing
[1:10:01] your body and you are possessed you say
[1:10:07] do we have any possessed people here
[1:10:08] today I hope we do I consider myself to
[1:10:11] be possessed I consider myself to be
[1:10:13] possessed of a Holy Spirit a spirit that
[1:10:16] literally has to possess the body and
[1:10:18] takes control of my actions and takes
[1:10:21] control of my voice and my man
[1:10:23] and what I faked and where I go and what
[1:10:25] I say why do you live the way you live
[1:10:28] because there's a spirit that is
[1:10:30] possessing you how would it be possessed
[1:10:39] come out of the man notice what he says
[1:10:41] here verse eight Jesus says come out of
[1:10:44] the man thou unclean spirit he asked him
[1:10:46] what is thy name he answered saying my
[1:10:48] name is legion for we are many he
[1:10:51] besought him that much that he would not
[1:10:53] send them away out of the country now
[1:10:54] there was nigh unto the mountains a
[1:10:57] great herd of swine feeding all the
[1:10:59] devil's besought him saying send us into
[1:11:01] the swine that we may enter into them
[1:11:04] and forthwith Jesus gave them leave and
[1:11:06] the unclean spirits went out and entered
[1:11:09] into the swine and the herd ran
[1:11:11] violently down a steep place into the
[1:11:13] sea there were about two thousand how do
[1:11:18] you get to the place to where you're
[1:11:19] bound by two thousand demon spirits
[1:11:24] because you give heed to one you allow
[1:11:27] one and then another once you allow one
[1:11:31] it's just a domino effect the next and
[1:11:35] the next and the next and the next and
[1:11:36] the next and the next to where you're
[1:11:37] totally bound and you become like Legion
[1:11:41] was a social reject no one wanted to be
[1:11:44] around and he was angry all the time
[1:11:47] never knew why he had anger and wrath
[1:11:49] and he was always upset maybe it started
[1:11:52] with just a temper and he sent the wrong
[1:11:53] thing and that spirit that voice that
[1:11:56] came to him to try to correct him and
[1:11:58] said make that right
[1:11:59] you shouldn't have spoke to her that way
[1:12:01] you should - shouldn't have spoke to
[1:12:02] your children that way but pride kept
[1:12:04] him from repeating and he held that
[1:12:08] anger in that's when the Bible says
[1:12:10] don't let the Sun go down upon your
[1:12:11] wrath make it ride don't let the devil
[1:12:14] have a place but he continued to give
[1:12:19] him place and continued to feed and feed
[1:12:22] and feed on the addiction and feed on
[1:12:24] the addiction coming to church looked
[1:12:26] fine everybody thought he was a good
[1:12:28] believer no issues no problems but
[1:12:30] inwardly there's a spirit a lion that is
[1:12:33] consumed in his body consumed in
[1:12:35] mine consuming his faults consuming
[1:12:37] everything he does and he never brings
[1:12:40] it subject to the Holy Ghost say that
[1:12:45] cannot happen to me it can happen to any
[1:12:47] one of us the Bible says that he verse
[1:12:51] 14 and they that fed the swine told the
[1:12:54] city in the country and they went out
[1:12:55] into the sea where did this evil begin
[1:12:57] we got out we gotta move past this just
[1:12:59] for a moment we've got a he says where
[1:13:01] does it where does evil come from you
[1:13:03] say where did it come from man it didn't
[1:13:06] come from man when God created man God
[1:13:08] said it's good it's a good creation man
[1:13:11] is not evil within the creation of man
[1:13:13] it didn't come from nature nature is
[1:13:16] under a curse nature was originally good
[1:13:19] but where did it originate from let's
[1:13:21] find out notice Ezekiel chapter 28 turn
[1:13:24] in your Bible I didn't send this back so
[1:13:26] let's let's use our Bible today amen
[1:13:29] let's hear the rustling of those leaves
[1:13:30] this morning turning Ezekiel chapter 28
[1:13:40] look at where excuse me we're gonna look
[1:13:42] at where evil became from where it
[1:13:45] originated from Ezekiel 28 verse 1 the
[1:13:48] word of the Lord came unto me saying son
[1:13:51] of man saying to the Prince of Tyrus
[1:13:53] thus saith the Lord God
[1:13:55] because thine heart is lifted up and
[1:14:00] thou has said I am God I sit in the seat
[1:14:04] of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou
[1:14:07] art a man and not God thou though thou
[1:14:11] set thine heart as the heart of God
[1:14:13] behold Thou are wiser than Daniel there
[1:14:16] is no secret that they can hide from
[1:14:18] thee verse 12 son of man take up a
[1:14:21] limitation upon the king of sight Tyrus
[1:14:24] saying to him thus saith the Lord God
[1:14:25] thou sittest up the sum full of wisdom
[1:14:29] and perfect in beauty thou has been and
[1:14:33] eat in the garden of God what's he
[1:14:35] talking about here every precious stone
[1:14:38] was thy covering the sardius topaz
[1:14:40] diamond the Beryl the Onyx the Jasper
[1:14:42] the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle
[1:14:44] gold the workmanship of that tablets and
[1:14:47] of thy pipes was prepared
[1:14:48] in the day that was created thou art the
[1:14:51] anointed cherub that covereth
[1:14:53] and I have set thee so that was upon the
[1:14:56] holy mountain of God thou has walked up
[1:14:59] and down in the midst of the stones of
[1:15:00] fire that was perfect in thy ways from
[1:15:04] the day that that was created until
[1:15:07] iniquity was found in thee
[1:15:13] that's the origination of evil and they
[1:15:17] try to figure out science and where does
[1:15:19] morals come from where does evil come
[1:15:20] from they tried to sin under experiments
[1:15:23] and research and doctors and and
[1:15:24] scientists looked at it that all they
[1:15:26] got to do is turn to Ezekiel you'll find
[1:15:28] it right here this is where it started
[1:15:31] the very beginning the seed started in
[1:15:35] Lucifer by the multitude of that
[1:15:38] merchants they have by the multitude of
[1:15:39] thy merchandise they have filled the
[1:15:41] midst of thee with violence and now a
[1:15:43] sin therefore our caste is profaned out
[1:15:45] of the mountain of God I would destroy
[1:15:47] the old covering cherub from the midst
[1:15:49] of the stones of fire thy heart was
[1:15:51] lifted up because of thy beauty thou has
[1:15:53] corrupted I wisdom by reason of that
[1:15:55] brightness I will cast thee to the
[1:15:57] ground I will lay thee before kings that
[1:15:59] they may behold thee Isaiah chapter 14
[1:16:03] verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven
[1:16:06] o Lucifer son of the morning how art
[1:16:09] thou cut to the ground which did weaken
[1:16:11] the nation's for a Taoist said in thy
[1:16:14] heart I will ascend into heaven I will
[1:16:16] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[1:16:18] will sit upon the mountain of the
[1:16:20] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:16:23] will ascend above the heights of the
[1:16:25] clouds I will be like the Most High yet
[1:16:29] thou shalt here's what God says and all
[1:16:33] your boasting and all your motion that
[1:16:35] you want to boast and say I'm gonna be
[1:16:37] this and I'm gonna be that God says yet
[1:16:39] thou shalt be brought down to hell to
[1:16:42] the sides of the pit they that shall see
[1:16:45] thee shall look narrow shall narrowly
[1:16:47] look upon thee and consider the saying
[1:16:50] is this you know what you're gonna do
[1:16:54] when you see the devil it's gonna go
[1:16:58] that little that little peon
[1:17:02] that little shrimp that little that
[1:17:05] little oh that's who bothered me Maya
[1:17:07] that's who I was that's who was
[1:17:09] bothering my family that's who I was so
[1:17:11] intimidated by when the doctor gave me a
[1:17:13] bad report that's who I was so nervous
[1:17:15] and fearful of the Bible says they'll
[1:17:18] look upon him narrowly saying is this
[1:17:20] the man that made the earth to tremble
[1:17:22] and that did shake the kingdoms that
[1:17:24] made the world as a wilderness and
[1:17:26] destroy the cities thereof that opened
[1:17:27] not the house of the prisoners that's
[1:17:29] why the brother branham says he's just a
[1:17:31] bluff he's just a liar he's just a bluff

[1:17:44] Jesus you have no part in me you have no
[1:17:46] part in my family you have no place in
[1:17:49] my mind hallelujah notice what it says
[1:17:57] about this man in revelations 12 verse 4
[1:17:59] and his tell his tale the dragon this is
[1:18:04] what Satan does his tail drew the third
[1:18:06] part of the stars of heaven and did cast
[1:18:09] them to the earth and the dragon stood
[1:18:12] before the woman which was ready to be
[1:18:13] delivered for to devour her child as
[1:18:15] soon as it was born verse 7 and there
[1:18:17] was war in heaven Michael and his angels
[1:18:19] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[1:18:21] fought and his angels he deceives a
[1:18:28] third part of heaven who do you think
[1:18:32] you faced every single day of your life
[1:18:35] fallen angels rebellious spirits started
[1:18:40] in hell yeah rebellious spirits started
[1:18:47] in hell that's why the Bible equates it
[1:18:49] to this sin of witchcraft are you here
[1:18:54] today
[1:18:55] yeah we better not go down that that
[1:18:57] that alley will get lost the Bible says
[1:19:00] that a third of heaven it would mean how
[1:19:02] many is that I don't know but I guess it
[1:19:05] would be millions of demon spirits that
[1:19:08] have been unleashed upon the earth
[1:19:11] millions of spirits notice what the
[1:19:14] prophet of God says here he says in the
[1:19:16] message and brothers you have this in
[1:19:18] the message proof of his resurrection
[1:19:19] now the same thing is wrong with you is
[1:19:23] wrong with that woman
[1:19:25] setting yonder noticed this the same
[1:19:28] thing wrong with you he points to a
[1:19:29] woman is the same thing wrong with that
[1:19:32] woman sitting over yonder looking right
[1:19:35] at me on the end of the road ride out
[1:19:38] there with a little round hat on there's
[1:19:41] a dark string a dark string now notice
[1:19:46] no one's seen it but a prophet was there
[1:19:47] and he looked into another dimension and
[1:19:50] there was a string going from that lady
[1:19:52] all the way over the audience attaching
[1:19:56] of this lady over here there's a dark
[1:19:59] string the lady looking across this
[1:20:01] lady's head looking at me right here
[1:20:03] with their handle that's it lady that's
[1:20:05] right here it is coming from one to the
[1:20:09] other it's evil powers pulling a dark
[1:20:14] streak yeah you realize when you're in
[1:20:21] church and you have a spirit of doubt
[1:20:23] that spirit of doubt can jump on
[1:20:24] somebody else who was not doubting
[1:20:27] before but suddenly they're afflicted
[1:20:28] without trying to hear the Word of God
[1:20:31] and it started because you gave the
[1:20:33] devil place in your mind but the very
[1:20:38] same opposite effect can happen when you
[1:20:40] start to pull on the Word of God and you
[1:20:42] start letting go of that oppression and
[1:20:44] depression somebody else that's
[1:20:46] afflicted with depression suddenly has
[1:20:48] the power to let go they don't realize
[1:20:50] it's happening in another dimension
[1:20:51] somewhere that's why it's important that
[1:20:54] we pull on the Word of God even if you
[1:20:56] don't feel like you need it today
[1:20:58] pulled for someone else and say God set
[1:21:01] him free this morning let them be free
[1:21:03] of that spirit let them
[1:21:04] free of that oppression that'll be a
[1:21:06] free of that addiction Lord but the
[1:21:08] powers of Hell be cast aside and let
[1:21:11] Christ come into the building today it's
[1:21:19] evil powers pulling a dark streak he
[1:21:23] says in darkest hour Jesus comes now
[1:21:24] here's two spirits calling one to
[1:21:29] another I only wish that my lovely
[1:21:32] audience could only be in this dimension
[1:21:34] and see this this woman standing here is
[1:21:38] suffering with the same thing that that
[1:21:40] woman sitting there with her hands cross
[1:21:42] like that here's a dark line sees it
[1:21:46] again because the spirit that's on this
[1:21:49] woman is calling to the spirit for help
[1:21:52] just like Legion why did you come to
[1:21:57] torment me why did you come to torment
[1:22:00] us what have I to do with thee Jesus son
[1:22:05] of God of the Most High what have I to
[1:22:07] do with thee Jesus what is that the man
[1:22:10] wants to worship God but the Spirit that
[1:22:13] is possessing him is resisting the Word
[1:22:16] of God in so much that he literally
[1:22:20] thinks that Jesus is there to torment
[1:22:24] him do you realize that's what Satan can
[1:22:30] do to some people who are in so much
[1:22:32] need of God they're in so much need of
[1:22:34] the Word of God to come and set them
[1:22:36] free yet they sit there with their arms
[1:22:38] crossed and folded and they think the
[1:22:40] preachers they're just a torment film or
[1:22:42] to make a mad or to pick on him when it
[1:22:45] was the opposite Jesus was there to set
[1:22:48] him free he was there to set him free of
[1:22:51] that problem don't let the devil tell
[1:22:53] you that the preaching of the word is
[1:22:55] trying to torment you are trying to pick
[1:22:57] on you it's here to set you free today
[1:22:59] it's here to break every chain in your
[1:23:02] life today
[1:23:07] he says oh I wish my lovely audience
[1:23:10] could only be in this dimension and see
[1:23:12] this this woman standing here is
[1:23:15] suffering with the same thing that woman
[1:23:17] sitting there with our hands cross right
[1:23:19] like that there's a dark line because
[1:23:21] the spirit that's on this woman is
[1:23:23] calling to this spirit for help and it's
[1:23:25] both the same disease arthritis to both
[1:23:31] and if you listen to the tape the women
[1:23:33] start screaming and God sets both of
[1:23:36] them free though only one of them came
[1:23:38] to the altar to be prayed for because a
[1:23:43] person tuned all hallelujah because
[1:23:45] there was a person who had the ability
[1:23:47] to peer into another dimension and
[1:23:49] exposed not just the spirit on this lady
[1:23:52] but to expose it in the audience and
[1:23:54] when the devil is exposed he only has
[1:23:57] one choice and that's to run for his
[1:23:59] life he only has one option when he's
[1:24:02] exposed has to call for help
[1:24:05] and go run it like a coward because
[1:24:06] that's what he is but God set them both
[1:24:09] free because God delivers and God saves
[1:24:13] and God heals you say can't he do it for
[1:24:15] me he can do it for you right now under
[1:24:18] the preaching of the word of God he
[1:24:20] could set you free in your seat right
[1:24:22] now where you sit hallelujah what if I
[1:24:29] told you that your heart trouble can be
[1:24:31] made well in Jesus name do you believe
[1:24:33] it he says to the woman on the stage do
[1:24:37] you believe it then go woman starts to
[1:24:40] walk on the stage as you hold your just
[1:24:43] a moment just a minute prophet says
[1:24:46] demons screamed what happened this woman
[1:24:49] brother Branham simply has her and the
[1:24:51] prayer line she's coming before do you
[1:24:53] believe Jesus Christ can okay then go
[1:24:55] ahead the woman starts to walk off the
[1:24:56] stage brother Branham starts to go to
[1:24:58] another person says hold on hold on just
[1:25:00] a minute a demon just screamed you
[1:25:03] believe it he says demons scream
[1:25:04] something called for help
[1:25:07] demon power it come from the audience
[1:25:12] when this woman was healed that demon
[1:25:16] spirit screaming to one
[1:25:18] for help it's the spiritual world we're
[1:25:21] not talking about the outside it's the
[1:25:26] spiritual friends they're just as real
[1:25:29] as your real and I see them many times
[1:25:31] when they leave
[1:25:33] I've seen them leave right from this
[1:25:35] platform I've seen them some of them in
[1:25:37] the shape of bats looked like long hairs
[1:25:39] hanging on their legs but when you came
[1:25:46] up here and you watched that person come
[1:25:47] and get prayed for and they raised their
[1:25:48] hands and the preacher bowed down and
[1:25:50] kneeled down and prayed with him you
[1:25:51] didn't see anything but in another world
[1:25:54] Satan has been defeated that person has
[1:25:56] been set free and that spirits looking
[1:25:59] and calling for help and running for his
[1:26:01] life looked like a little hairs hanging
[1:26:07] out but an epileptic demon looks like a
[1:26:09] tortoise with round legs hanging up like
[1:26:11] that usually but usually a demon of
[1:26:14] oppression seems to be more of a cloud
[1:26:16] form like a wave and it just makes a
[1:26:19] real funny sound when you're in that
[1:26:21] other dimension to see the spirit you
[1:26:28] see how important it is to have
[1:26:30] discernment of that dimension if I can
[1:26:35] get you accomplish one thing here today
[1:26:36] it'll be this to make you understand
[1:26:38] this is a real world these are real
[1:26:44] demon spirits that can really possess
[1:26:46] you and attack you and it's important
[1:26:49] more than ever before that we realize
[1:26:51] that we need to have our senses
[1:26:53] exercised to discern both good and evil
[1:26:56] to be mature Christians to understand
[1:26:59] we're not dealing with flesh and blood
[1:27:01] here
[1:27:02] we're dealing with spiritual wickedness
[1:27:03] in high places you may think that's
[1:27:09] wrong but some of these days you'll
[1:27:11] realize if you could only take a
[1:27:13] spiritual looking-glass and look into
[1:27:15] your soul you'd out and you'd find out
[1:27:19] what it looks like and the greatest
[1:27:21] devil the chief of all Devils
[1:27:26] [Applause]
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:31] that's gotta be pornography er or murder
[1:27:34] rape molestation er some kind of
[1:27:37] horrible no prophet says the chief of
[1:27:40] all Devils is unbelief the chief the
[1:27:48] captain the chief the leader the main
[1:27:52] one the main the biggest the greatest is
[1:27:55] unbelief why do you think more than and
[1:28:00] more than any other spirit that we face
[1:28:02] at the closing scenes of history is
[1:28:04] Satan trying to get people to disbelieve
[1:28:08] the Word of God because he's the chief
[1:28:13] of all Devils and he affects you he
[1:28:17] affects me affects our children he
[1:28:18] affects our family trying to get us to
[1:28:20] doubt the Word of God are you hear this
[1:28:27] today and these angels that afflict and
[1:28:34] Satan's scheme has been thoroughly
[1:28:37] written about in the scripture his plan
[1:28:39] and his blueprint more than ever before
[1:28:42] he's attacking like a roaring lion the
[1:28:46] scripture calls him a roaring lion our
[1:28:49] adversary is like a roaring lion seeking
[1:28:51] whom he may devour you say brother Matt
[1:28:54] what does the demons want to do what is
[1:28:56] their purpose do they have a purpose
[1:28:58] they do a demon spirit wants to deceive
[1:29:02] you into until you're thinking it's so
[1:29:05] crooked and you look at things so
[1:29:07] backwards until you can't see straight
[1:29:09] until you can't see the truth the demon
[1:29:12] spirit wants to delude your mind from
[1:29:15] what's right and twist you and destroy
[1:29:20] you either physically mentally
[1:29:23] emotionally or socially
[1:29:31] person would you Satan wants more than
[1:29:34] ever before to make you a hermit to go
[1:29:40] into here for and no more
[1:29:44] you think fellowship is not important
[1:29:47] you're mistaken
[1:29:49] thank you could just come to a church
[1:29:51] and go home and be with your family and
[1:29:53] don't have anything to do with anybody
[1:29:54] anywhere there's a spirit trying to lead
[1:29:57] you there's a spirit trying to do that
[1:30:00] to you trying to separate you from
[1:30:03] everybody else he wants to make you like
[1:30:06] Legion to push you away from society
[1:30:08] Legion literally live by himself
[1:30:11] couldn't be around anybody or he'll
[1:30:16] destroy you if he can't get you that way
[1:30:18] he'll destroy you spiritually the
[1:30:20] scripture talks about this leader of the
[1:30:22] demons the person that we call the devil
[1:30:25] we call him the devil generic name just
[1:30:29] the devil that was just a devil the
[1:30:31] devil made me do it well the scripture
[1:30:33] gives this devil five names and twenty
[1:30:36] four titles in just the New Testament
[1:30:39] alone this powerful angel what the
[1:30:42] scripture calls him the anointed cherub
[1:30:44] the anointed cherub means he was closest
[1:30:47] to the throne of God so you can be
[1:30:51] closest to the throne of God and still
[1:30:53] rebelled
[1:30:55] the scripture calls him in the Bible
[1:30:58] here's his name's Satan Abaddon in Greek
[1:31:04] that a bad a name means apollyon means
[1:31:09] destroyer another name given to him is
[1:31:13] Beelzebub another name given in the
[1:31:18] Bible is Belial and in another place
[1:31:22] they call him Lucifer
[1:31:25] there is nothing sweet or tender or kind
[1:31:30] about any of those names
[1:31:32] did you just feel a sweet spirit when I
[1:31:35] say that Lucifer oh just melts my heart
[1:31:41] just does something to me Beelzebub but
[1:31:48] what about when I say Jesus
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:56] emanuelle
[1:31:59] does it do something to you give us fill
[1:32:03] that gentle spirit Jesus that's why it's
[1:32:06] important to say his name he shall be
[1:32:08] called Prince of Peace
[1:32:11] he's called everlasting father he's
[1:32:17] called son of the morning he's called
[1:32:21] the lily of the valley oh I love him
[1:32:24] don't you
[1:32:26] he's typed as different animals in the
[1:32:28] scripture in the Bible the Bible refers
[1:32:31] to him as a serpent a snake in the grass
[1:32:33] a red dragon cruel and powerful he's
[1:32:36] described in the New Testament as a
[1:32:39] prowling lion do you realize when you go
[1:32:42] out of church today and you walk out
[1:32:44] those doors there's a prowling lion
[1:32:47] following behind you let me ask you if
[1:32:52] you've turned on the news today and
[1:32:54] Happy Valley Elizabeth and whatever your
[1:32:55] newspaper is or however you follow your
[1:32:57] news here and there was a picture of a
[1:32:59] lion prowling the streets of
[1:33:01] Elizabethton and I couldn't find it and
[1:33:04] the news article was a lion on the loose
[1:33:06] how many of y'all would be going
[1:33:07] downtown to Elizabeth's in today with
[1:33:09] your children and your families and if
[1:33:13] you were forced to go in public would
[1:33:14] you just be sort of just walking around
[1:33:16] casually not really care if you're
[1:33:18] watching or looking no but do you
[1:33:20] realize this is the reality that the
[1:33:22] scripture gives you that in this
[1:33:24] atmosphere in this dimension there's a
[1:33:26] prowling lion on the loose trying to
[1:33:30] devour you that's why Paul said put on
[1:33:32] the whole armour of God that you may be
[1:33:35] able to withstand the wiles of the devil
[1:33:39] [Applause]
[1:33:41] it's called the ruler of this world the
[1:33:44] Prince of this world Jesus calls him the
[1:33:47] god of this world you know he's the only
[1:33:49] person Jesus ever called God it's out of
[1:33:53] his father the god of this evil age we'd
[1:33:57] like to look at something today and it's
[1:33:59] gonna this it's gonna be lengthy
[1:34:00] brothers if you'll go ahead and pull up
[1:34:01] that article felt led to read this
[1:34:07] I want you to look at one of the schemes
[1:34:09] of the devil just as we close just give
[1:34:12] me can I have just about 15 20 more
[1:34:14] minutes I want you to look at just some
[1:34:17] of the sudden this article that I found
[1:34:19] believe the Lord led me to it
[1:34:22] and I read it to our church and it's
[1:34:25] good it's gonna be it's gonna be quite
[1:34:26] shock you know I don't think I'll have
[1:34:28] any trouble keeping anyone's attention
[1:34:29] and you'll see why when we begin to read
[1:34:31] it but the scripture says we're not
[1:34:34] ignorant of his devices is that what
[1:34:37] your Bible says I want you to read from
[1:34:40] this children psychologist today as he
[1:34:43] wrote this article called the undoing of
[1:34:46] families and the social medias attack an
[1:34:50] assault on young people he says here my
[1:34:55] practice is a child adolescent
[1:34:58] psychologist is filled with families
[1:35:00] like Kellis these parents say their kids
[1:35:02] extreme overuse of phones video games
[1:35:04] social media is the most difficult
[1:35:07] pairing issue they face and in many
[1:35:09] cases it's tearing families apart
[1:35:11] preteen and teen girls refuse to get off
[1:35:14] their phones even though it's remarkably
[1:35:16] clear the devices are making them
[1:35:17] miserable I also see far too many boys
[1:35:20] there's gaming obsessions lead them to
[1:35:22] forego interest in school
[1:35:23] extracurricular activities than anything
[1:35:25] else productive some of these boys as
[1:35:27] they reach our later teens use their
[1:35:29] large bodies to terrorize parents who
[1:35:31] attempt to set gaming limits common
[1:35:34] thread running through many of these
[1:35:35] cases is parent Gilda's as so many are
[1:35:37] certain they did something to put their
[1:35:39] kids on a destructive path now listen
[1:35:41] close hear what none of these parents
[1:35:43] understand is that their children's and
[1:35:47] teens obstructive obsession with
[1:35:49] technology is the predictable
[1:35:52] consequence of a virtually unrecognized
[1:35:56] merger between the tech industry and
[1:36:00] psychology
[1:36:01] this alliance pairs the consumer the
[1:36:06] consumer tech industry's immense wealth
[1:36:08] with the most sophisticated
[1:36:10] psychological research making it
[1:36:13] possible to develop social media video
[1:36:16] games and phones with drug-like powers
[1:36:19] to seduce young
[1:36:20] users these parents have no idea that
[1:36:25] lurking behind their kids screens and
[1:36:28] phones are a multitude of psychologists
[1:36:32] neuroscientist and social science expect
[1:36:36] spurts who use their knowledge of
[1:36:38] psychological vulnerabilities to devise
[1:36:41] products that capture kids attentions
[1:36:43] for the sake of Industry profit what
[1:36:47] these parents and most of the world have
[1:36:50] yet to grasp is that psychology a
[1:36:53] discipline that we associate with
[1:36:55] healing is now being used as a weapon
[1:36:58] against children nestled in an
[1:37:04] unremarkable building on the Stanford
[1:37:07] University campus in Palo Alto
[1:37:08] California is the Stanford persuasive
[1:37:13] technology lab notice the word
[1:37:15] persuasive technology founded in 1998
[1:37:19] the labs creator dr. BJ Fogg is a
[1:37:22] psychologist and the father of
[1:37:24] persuasive technology a discipline in
[1:37:26] which digital media and apps including
[1:37:29] smartphones social media and video games
[1:37:31] are configured to alter human thoughts
[1:37:33] and behaviors as the labs website boldly
[1:37:36] proclaimed machines designed to change
[1:37:39] humans Fogg speaks openly of the ability
[1:37:43] to use smartphones and other digital
[1:37:45] devices to change your ideas and actions
[1:37:48] quote we can now create machines that
[1:37:51] can change what people think and what
[1:37:53] people do and the machines can do that
[1:37:56] autonomously called the millionaire
[1:38:00] maker Fogg this man has groomed former
[1:38:04] students who have used his methods to
[1:38:07] develop technologies that now consume
[1:38:09] kids lives as he recently touted on his
[1:38:12] personal website my students often do
[1:38:16] groundbreaking projects and they
[1:38:17] continue having impact in the real world
[1:38:20] after they leave Stanford for example
[1:38:22] Instagram has influenced the behavior of
[1:38:25] over 800 million people and the
[1:38:28] co-founder was a student of mine
[1:38:35] intriguingly there are signs that fog is
[1:38:37] filling the heat from recents currenty
[1:38:39] the use of digital devices alter
[1:38:40] behavior his boast about instagram was
[1:38:43] president as web says lays of January
[1:38:44] 2018 has been removed Falls web fogs
[1:38:47] website also has lately undergone a
[1:38:49] substantial makeover as he now seems to
[1:38:51] go out of his way to suggest his work
[1:38:53] has benevolent aims move on down brother
[1:38:55] just just to the slide later while fog
[1:38:59] emphasizes persuasive designs sunny
[1:39:02] future
[1:39:03] he is quite indifferent to the
[1:39:05] disturbing reality now that hidden
[1:39:08] influence techniques are being used by
[1:39:12] the tech industry to hook and exploit
[1:39:15] users for profit his enthusiastic vision
[1:39:20] also conveniently neglects to include
[1:39:22] how this generation of children and
[1:39:24] teams with their highly malleable minds
[1:39:26] is being manipulated and hurt by unseen
[1:39:29] forces he calls the section weaponizing
[1:39:33] persuasion if you haven't heard of
[1:39:36] persuasive technology that's no accident
[1:39:40] tech corporations would prefer it to
[1:39:43] remain in the shadows as most of us
[1:39:45] don't want to be controlled and have a
[1:39:47] special aversion to kids being
[1:39:49] manipulated for profit persuasive
[1:39:52] technology also called persuasive design
[1:39:54] works by deliberately creating digital
[1:39:58] environments that users feel fulfill
[1:40:01] their basic human drives to be social or
[1:40:05] to obtain goals betters and real-world
[1:40:10] alternatives kids spend countless hours
[1:40:13] in social media and video game
[1:40:15] environments in pursuit of likes friends
[1:40:19] game points levels because it's
[1:40:22] stimulating they believe this makes them
[1:40:25] happy and successful and they find it
[1:40:28] easier than doing the difficult but
[1:40:30] developmentally important activities of
[1:40:32] childhood while persuasion techniques
[1:40:36] work well on adults they are
[1:40:38] particularly effective at influencing
[1:40:41] the still maturing child and teen brain
[1:40:44] video games better than anything
[1:40:46] in our culture deliver rewards to people
[1:40:49] especially teenage boys says Fogg
[1:40:52] teenage boys are wired to seek
[1:40:55] competency to master our world and get
[1:40:59] better at stuff video games and dishing
[1:41:02] out rewards can convey to people that
[1:41:04] their competency is growing you can get
[1:41:07] better at something second-by-second I'm
[1:41:13] just I'm just leveling up just got to
[1:41:15] get to the next level you think it's an
[1:41:19] accident it's not and it's persuasive
[1:41:23] design that's helped convince this
[1:41:25] generation of boys they are gaining
[1:41:26] competency by spending countless hours
[1:41:29] on game sites when the sad reality is
[1:41:33] that they're actually just locked away
[1:41:35] in their rooms gaming ignoring school
[1:41:39] and not developing the real-world
[1:41:40] competencies that colleges and employers
[1:41:43] demand now this man only sees this from
[1:41:47] a psychologist view I want you to put on
[1:41:49] your spiritual thinking caps this
[1:41:51] morning and see the spiritual
[1:41:53] implications of this
[1:41:55] likewise social media companies use
[1:41:57] persuasive designed to prey on the
[1:41:59] age-appropriate desire for preteens and
[1:42:02] team kid 's especially girls to be
[1:42:04] socially successful this drive is built
[1:42:07] into our DNA since real world relational
[1:42:10] skills have fostered human evolution the
[1:42:13] Huffington Post article what really
[1:42:16] happens on a teen girls phone describes
[1:42:18] the life of 14-year old Casey from
[1:42:20] Millburn New Jersey with 580 friends on
[1:42:24] Instagram and 1110 on Facebook she's
[1:42:27] preoccupied with the number of likes her
[1:42:30] facebook profile picture receives
[1:42:32] compared with her peers as she says if
[1:42:35] you don't get 100 lights you make other
[1:42:38] people share it so you get 100 or else
[1:42:40] you get upset everyone wants to get the
[1:42:43] most likes it's like a popularity
[1:42:45] contest article author Bianca Bhaskar
[1:42:50] says that there are costs to Casey's
[1:42:52] phone obsession noting that the girl's
[1:42:55] phone be it on Facebook Instagram or
[1:42:57] iMessage is constantly pulling her away
[1:43:00] from her
[1:43:00] work sleep conversations with her family
[1:43:02] Casey says she wishes she could put her
[1:43:04] phone down but she can't I wake up in
[1:43:08] the morning and go on Facebook just
[1:43:10] because no it's not just because it's
[1:43:15] because there was a there's a
[1:43:16] psychologist and neuroscience who has
[1:43:18] designed something you think you're just
[1:43:20] looking in a screen what you don't see
[1:43:22] behind that app is an addiction
[1:43:25] happening it's not like I want to or
[1:43:29] don't I just go on and I'm like forced
[1:43:31] to I don't know why I need to Facebook
[1:43:33] takes up my whole life BJ Fogg may not
[1:43:37] be a household name but Fortune magazine
[1:43:40] calls him the new guru you should know
[1:43:43] and his research is driving a worldwide
[1:43:45] legion of user experience UX designers
[1:43:48] who utilize and expand upon his models
[1:43:51] of persuasive design as Forbes magazine
[1:43:54] writer Anthony week Auster notes no one
[1:43:56] has perhaps been as influential on the
[1:43:58] current generation of user experience
[1:44:00] designers as Stanford researcher BJ Fogg
[1:44:03] UX designers come from many disciplines
[1:44:05] including psychology as well as brain
[1:44:08] and computer sciences however the core
[1:44:10] of some UX research is about using
[1:44:13] psychology to take advantage of our
[1:44:14] human vulnerabilities that's
[1:44:16] particularly pernicious when the targets
[1:44:18] are children as Fogg is quoted in
[1:44:21] Koster's Forbes article Facebook Twitter
[1:44:23] Google you name it
[1:44:25] these companies have been using
[1:44:26] computers to influence our behavior
[1:44:29] however the driving force behind
[1:44:31] behavior change is a computer the
[1:44:34] missing link
[1:44:35] isn't technology it's psychology says
[1:44:41] Fogg UX researchers not only often
[1:44:44] follows Foggs model but some may also
[1:44:47] share his apparent tendency to overlook
[1:44:49] the broader implications of persuasive
[1:44:51] design they focus on the task at hand
[1:44:53] building digital machines and apps the
[1:44:56] better demand users attention compel
[1:44:58] users to return again and again and grow
[1:45:00] business bottom lines let it less
[1:45:02] considered can be how the world's
[1:45:04] children are affected by thousands of UX
[1:45:06] designers working simultaneously to pull
[1:45:09] them onto a multitude of digital devices
[1:45:11] and products at the expense
[1:45:13] of real life according to BJ fog the fog
[1:45:17] behavioral motto is a well tested method
[1:45:20] to change behavior and in its simplified
[1:45:22] form involves three primary factors
[1:45:24] motivation ability and triggers
[1:45:27] describing how his formula is effective
[1:45:30] at getting people to use social network
[1:45:32] the psychologist says in an academic
[1:45:34] paper that a key motivator is users
[1:45:38] desire for social acceptance although he
[1:45:44] says an even more powerful motivator is
[1:45:47] the desire to avoid being socially
[1:45:50] rejected regarding the ability Foggs
[1:45:53] suggests the digital product should be
[1:45:55] made so that users don't have to think
[1:45:58] hard hence social networks are designed
[1:46:01] for ease of use
[1:46:02] finally Fogg says that potential users
[1:46:05] need to be triggered to use a site this
[1:46:08] is accomplished by a myriad of digital
[1:46:10] tricks including the sending of
[1:46:12] incessant notifications urging users to
[1:46:15] view friends pictures and connect your
[1:46:17] app out to our notice what he's trying
[1:46:19] to do
[1:46:19] they're always notifications you ever
[1:46:21] notice your phone look at my phone today
[1:46:23] I got one two three four five six seven
[1:46:26] eight just on my phone right now
[1:46:28] you know what that causes it causes an
[1:46:31] autopilot till when I get done preach
[1:46:33] and I get done praying and I get back to
[1:46:35] my car and start managing the first
[1:46:37] thing I do
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:47] telling them that they're missing out
[1:46:50] that's what it's trying to do to tell
[1:46:52] you're missing you're missing you're
[1:46:54] missing the university better get to it
[1:46:55] some people can't even avoid it in
[1:46:56] church preachers preach and phone
[1:47:07] vibrates a man brother you preach it
[1:47:22] telling them they're missing out while
[1:47:27] not on the social network are suggesting
[1:47:29] that they check yet again to see if
[1:47:31] anyone liked their post or photo fogs
[1:47:34] formula is the blueprint for building
[1:47:35] multi-billion dollar did multi-billion
[1:47:38] dollar social media and gaming companies
[1:47:39] however moral questions about the impact
[1:47:41] of turning persuasive techniques on
[1:47:43] children and teens are not being asked
[1:47:45] for example should the fear of social
[1:47:46] rejection be used to compel kids to
[1:47:48] compulsively use social media is it okay
[1:47:50] to lure kids away from school tasks that
[1:47:52] demand a strong mental effort so they
[1:47:54] can spend their lives on social networks
[1:47:55] or playing video games that don't make
[1:47:57] them much at all and is it okay to
[1:48:00] incessantly trigger kids to use revenue
[1:48:02] producing digital products at the
[1:48:04] expense of engaging with family and
[1:48:08] other real important life activities
[1:48:14] prophet of God prophesied said the
[1:48:17] families in trouble you know why the
[1:48:20] church is in trouble you know why the
[1:48:21] church is in trouble because the
[1:48:22] family's in trouble and the church is
[1:48:25] made up of the families and the families
[1:48:27] are made up of how much value you have

[1:48:51] of their apparent triggering of the

[1:51:32] products are used clandestine techniques
[1:51:35] that manipulate users to fulfill a
[1:51:37] profit motive are regarded by
[1:51:39] programmers as dark design why would
[1:51:41] researchers
[1:51:42] why would firms resort to such tactics
[1:51:44] as former tech executive bill David L
[1:51:46] says it is Atlantic article exploiting
[1:51:48] the neuroscience of Internet addiction
[1:51:50] the leaders of Internet companies face
[1:51:52] an interesting if also morally
[1:51:54] questionable imperative either they
[1:51:57] hijack neuroscience to gain market share
[1:51:59] and make large profits or they let
[1:52:01] competitors do that and run away with
[1:52:03] the market there are a few industries is
[1:52:06] cutthroat and unregulated as Silicon
[1:52:08] Valley social media and video game
[1:52:10] companies believe they are compelled to
[1:52:12] use persuasive technology and the in the
[1:52:14] arms race for attention profits in
[1:52:18] survival children's well-being is not
[1:52:21] part of the decisions cupcakes while
[1:52:25] social media and video game companies
[1:52:28] have been surprisingly successful at
[1:52:29] hiding their use of persuasive design
[1:52:31] from the public one breakthrough
[1:52:33] occurred in 2017 when Facebook documents
[1:52:36] were leaked to the Australian the
[1:52:37] internal report crafted by Facebook
[1:52:39] executives showed the social network
[1:52:41] boasting to advertisers that by
[1:52:43] monitoring post interactions and photos
[1:52:45] in real time the network is able to
[1:52:47] track when teens feel insecure worthless
[1:52:50] stressed useless and a failure why would
[1:52:54] the social network do this the report
[1:52:55] also bragged about Facebook's ability to
[1:52:57] micro-target ads down to the moments
[1:53:01] when young people need a confidence
[1:53:03] boost
[1:53:06] and these neuroscientists and
[1:53:09] psychologists think that they're so
[1:53:10] intelligent and so smart what they don't
[1:53:12] see is that in another dimension there's
[1:53:14] a smart devil and smart demons who is
[1:53:17] anointing their minds and hands and
[1:53:19] ideas when they write ideas on paper who
[1:53:24] do you think is the master of targeting
[1:53:26] and micro targeting temptations just at
[1:53:29] the right time that temptation that
[1:53:34] lures you comes at the very right moment
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:45] persuasive technology the use of digital
[1:53:48] meat I'm almost done
[1:53:49] Digital Media to target children
[1:53:50] deploying the weapon of psychological
[1:53:52] manipulation of just the right moment is
[1:53:53] what makes it so powerful these design
[1:53:56] techniques provide tech corporations a
[1:53:58] window into kids hearts and minds to
[1:54:00] measure their particular vulnerabilities
[1:54:02] which can then be used to control their
[1:54:04] behavior as consumers this isn't some
[1:54:06] strange future this is now Facebook
[1:54:12] claimed the leaked report was
[1:54:13] misrepresented in the press but when
[1:54:14] child advocates called on the social
[1:54:16] networking to release it company refused
[1:54:18] to do so preferring to keep the
[1:54:19] techniques that uses to influence kids
[1:54:20] shrouded in secrecy
[1:54:23] the official tech industry's line is
[1:54:26] that persuasive technology or
[1:54:27] technologies are used to make products
[1:54:30] more engaging and enjoyable but the
[1:54:32] revelations of industry insiders can
[1:54:34] reveal darker motives video game
[1:54:36] developer John Hobson who has a PhD in
[1:54:39] behavioral and brain science wrote the
[1:54:41] paper paper behavioral game design he
[1:54:44] describes the use of design features to
[1:54:46] alter video game player behavior
[1:54:48] sounding much like an experiment an
[1:54:51] experiment or running lab animals
[1:54:53] through their paces answering questions
[1:54:55] such as how do we make players maintain
[1:54:58] a high consistent rate of activity and
[1:55:01] how to make players play forever now one
[1:55:08] of the most popular video games that's
[1:55:10] being played right now on xbox in place
[1:55:12] pramatta uprichard against video games I
[1:55:14] mean that's not what I'm doing here
[1:55:15] today do you think I am you've missed it
[1:55:19] sorry if you got excited and you have
[1:55:21] some against video games and you thought
[1:55:22] I was I'm sorry to disappoint you it's
[1:55:24] not what I'm doing trying to get you to
[1:55:27] have dimensional discernment one of the
[1:55:33] most popular video games that has kids
[1:55:36] are playing right now the graphics they
[1:55:37] used to think it was all about graphics
[1:55:39] get it more real and more real or more
[1:55:40] real the most popular video game being
[1:55:42] played right now won't even give it a
[1:55:44] mention but you teenagers know what I'm
[1:55:46] talking about graphics aren't even that
[1:55:47] special graphics really aren't that
[1:55:49] great but yet people want to play it
[1:55:52] more than ever before because there's a
[1:55:55] neuroscience there's that there's an
[1:55:56] addiction of persuasion to get you to
[1:55:59] perform and you're getting better and
[1:56:01] you're getting better and you're getting
[1:56:02] better
[1:56:02] oh I'll read it from down here if I need
[1:56:07] to I'll bring my laptop down here no one
[1:56:10] will have to see my face these video
[1:56:16] game developers are asking how do we
[1:56:17] make players play forever revealing the
[1:56:21] hard science behind persuasive
[1:56:22] technology Hobson says this is not to
[1:56:25] say that players are the same as rats
[1:56:27] but that there are general rules of
[1:56:30] learning which apply equally to both
[1:56:32] after pinning the paper Hobson was hired
[1:56:34] by Microsoft where he helped lead the
[1:56:37] development of the Xbox LIVE Microsoft's
[1:56:40] online gaming system he also assisted in
[1:56:45] the development of Xbox game Xbox games
[1:56:47] popular with kids including these in the
[1:56:49] Halo series the parents I work with
[1:56:51] simply have no idea about the immense
[1:56:54] amount of financial and psychological
[1:56:57] firepower aimed at their children to
[1:56:59] keep them playing video games forever
[1:57:05] that's why you don't just give your
[1:57:07] child a video game and say just get
[1:57:08] whatever you won't play anything you
[1:57:10] want I really don't care do you really
[1:57:11] not care do you really really do you
[1:57:13] really not care two parents not care
[1:57:15] anymore
[1:57:16] do you realize you're releasing that
[1:57:18] child to let them shut their door and
[1:57:20] lock them self away and they're in a
[1:57:21] room with psychologists and
[1:57:23] neuroscientists
[1:57:24] and perverted minds of with demon
[1:57:26] spirits hallelujah and they're trying to
[1:57:32] destroy everything you're trying to
[1:57:35] build they're trying to tear everything
[1:57:38] you try to do down hallelujah you okay
[1:57:51] he says here the officials Peck tech
[1:57:54] line official tech industries lines the
[1:57:56] persuasive technologies are used let me
[1:58:00] let me find my place again where I was
[1:58:02] he says that the parents I work with
[1:58:04] simply have no idea the immense amount
[1:58:05] of financial psychological firepower
[1:58:07] aimed at their children to keep them
[1:58:08] playing video games forever
[1:58:10] another persuasive technology expert is

[1:58:22] consulting agency phone is a transparent
[1:58:25] troponin is transparent about the power

[1:58:30] the game in industry disclosing and big
[1:58:32] four accounting firms Pete PwC's tech
[1:58:35] business journal if game designers are
[1:58:37] going to pull a person away from every
[1:58:39] other voluntary social activity or hobby
[1:58:41] or pastime they're going to have to
[1:58:44] engage that person at a very deep level
[1:58:46] in every possible way they can this is a
[1:58:53] major effect of persuasive design today
[1:58:56] building video games and social media
[1:58:58] products so compelling that they pull
[1:59:00] users away from the world world to spend
[1:59:02] their lives in for-profit domains but to
[1:59:06] engage in a pursuit at the expense of
[1:59:08] important real world activities is a
[1:59:10] core element of addiction and there is
[1:59:17] increasing evidence that persuasive
[1:59:19] design has now become so potent that it
[1:59:22] is capable of contributing to video game
[1:59:25] and Internet addiction diagnoses that
[1:59:28] are officially recognized in China South
[1:59:32] Korea and Japan and which are now under
[1:59:35] consideration in the unite
[1:59:37] an addiction to the Internet an
[1:59:41] addiction to video games you think
[1:59:49] you're not living in Satan's Eden you
[1:59:51] are not only dis persuasive design
[1:59:55] appear to drive kids addictions to
[1:59:57] devices but knowledge of addiction is
[1:59:58] used to make persuasive design more
[2:00:00] effective at hijacking the mind as
[2:00:02] dopamine labs Ramsey Brown acknowledges
[2:00:05] in the episode of CBS's 60 minutes since
[2:00:07] we figured to some extent how these
[2:00:10] pieces of the brain that handle
[2:00:12] addiction are working people have
[2:00:14] figured out how to juice them further
[2:00:15] and how to bake that information into
[2:00:18] apps the creation of digital products
[2:00:20] with drug like effects that are able to
[2:00:22] pull a person away from engaging in
[2:00:24] real-life activities and is the reason
[2:00:26] why persuasive technology is profoundly
[2:00:29] destructive today persuasive design is
[2:00:32] like distracting adults from driving
[2:00:33] safely productive work and engaging with
[2:00:36] our own children all matters which need
[2:00:38] an urgent attention still because the
[2:00:40] child and adolescent brain is more
[2:00:42] easily controlled than the adult mind
[2:00:44] the use of persuasive design is having a
[2:00:47] much more hurtful impact on kids
[2:00:49] persuasive technologies are reshaping
[2:00:52] childhood luring kids away from family
[2:00:55] social work schoolwork and spend more
[2:00:57] time more and more of their lives
[2:00:58] sitting before screens and phones
[2:01:00] according to the Kaiser Family
[2:01:02] Foundation report younger u.s. children
[2:01:04] now spend five and a half hours each day
[2:01:07] with entertainment technologies
[2:01:09] including video games social media and
[2:01:11] online videos even more the average teen
[2:01:15] now spends an incredible eight hours a
[2:01:16] day playing with screens and phones
[2:01:20] products productive uses of technology
[2:01:23] were persuasive design is much less a
[2:01:26] factor are almost an afterthought as US
[2:01:29] kids only spend 16 minutes each day
[2:01:32] using the computer for home or school
[2:01:36] how much time did they spend reading
[2:01:39] their Bible how much time do they spent
[2:01:41] at the family altar how much time did
[2:01:43] they spend and listening to the message
[2:01:47] and we wonder why we're losing our kids
[2:01:51] we blame it on the pastor and we blame
[2:01:52] it on the preacher and we blame it on
[2:01:54] the message told man we're in some deep
[2:01:59] water yeah really hits home donut the
[2:02:09] combined effects of the displacement of
[2:02:11] vital childhood activities and exposure
[2:02:14] to unhealthy online environment this is
[2:02:16] the very last one that I sent you
[2:02:17] brother a wired generation falling apart
[2:02:20] one of the last ones the combined
[2:02:23] effects of disk of the displacement of
[2:02:25] vital childhood activities and exposure
[2:02:27] to unhealthy online environments is
[2:02:29] wrecking a generation in her recent
[2:02:32] Atlantic article have smartphones
[2:02:34] destroying a generation dr. Jean twinge
[2:02:36] a professor of psychology at San Diego
[2:02:38] University describes how long hours
[2:02:40] spent on smartphones and social media
[2:02:41] are driving teen girls in the u.s. to
[2:02:43] experience high rates of depression and
[2:02:45] suicidal behavior you say for the matter
[2:02:50] you preaching against videogames not
[2:02:52] what I'm doing
[2:02:53] you preach it against phones and
[2:02:55] obviously not what I'm doing
[2:02:58] guilty if that's what I'm doing I'm
[2:03:01] trying to get you to understand that
[2:03:03] there's another dimension and that
[2:03:06] there's another world and us as
[2:03:08] believers more than ever before need to
[2:03:10] have our senses exercised to discern
[2:03:13] another dimension to realize that there
[2:03:16] are certain conditions we can create in
[2:03:19] our home that invite the wrong spirit
[2:03:22] there are certain things we can watch in
[2:03:24] our home that invite the wrong spirit
[2:03:27] there are certain places that we can go
[2:03:29] that invite the wrong spirit there are
[2:03:32] certain things we can play and watch and
[2:03:34] and take part of and have on our phones
[2:03:36] that invite the wrong spirit but there's
[2:03:38] the right things you can place before
[2:03:40] your children and before their eyes that
[2:03:43] create the right spirit I want to create
[2:03:46] the right spirit in my home I want to
[2:03:48] say God let me be let me discern that
[2:03:50] there's another dimension and there's a
[2:03:52] Holy Ghost that can really influence my
[2:03:55] children and influence my family
[2:03:57] and influence their decision it's called
[2:03:59] the Tolkien and I can apply it to my
[2:04:01] home in so much that it affects the very
[2:04:04] minds of my children the influences of
[2:04:07] their behavior I want them to be
[2:04:09] influenced from above how many people
[2:04:11] here today want to say Lord let me be
[2:04:14] influenced from above
[2:04:15] let me discern another dimension where
[2:04:17] you can influence my behavior you can
[2:04:20] change my behavior your word you know
[2:04:22] what this word does it's persuasive
[2:04:24] design it persuades you to live right it
[2:04:28] persuades you to talk right it persuades
[2:04:30] you to go right it persuades you to live
[2:04:33] right why because it's designed to give
[2:04:36] you strength it's designed to give you
[2:04:38] faith it's designed to give you hope if
[2:04:41] you just feed upon it today o stand to
[2:04:45] your feet and rejoice this morning
[2:04:53] hallelujah o glory to God
[2:05:00] praise You Lord Jesus hallelujah
[2:05:05] simmer the map what I want to get
[2:05:08] questions and emails after I leave here
[2:05:12] what are we trying to do we're trying to
[2:05:14] get you to understand there's a real
[2:05:16] world and he wants your mind those demon
[2:05:20] spirits want to wreck you and twist you
[2:05:22] spiritually physically emotionally
[2:05:24] anoint you they want to possess you but
[2:05:28] you know what there's a Holy Spirit
[2:05:30] that's here and he wants to possess you
[2:05:34] this morning how many want to be
[2:05:37] possessed by that spirit how many want
[2:05:40] to say lord give me discernment let me
[2:05:43] understand I'm not wrestling against
[2:05:44] flesh and blood addictions that happen
[2:05:47] in my family or my life or my children
[2:05:49] or my loved ones that's not a flesh and
[2:05:50] blood problem
[2:05:51] it's a spiritual wickedness in high
[2:05:56] places that's why we preach against how
[2:05:59] yes why we preach how you address
[2:06:00] because it carries spirits so why we
[2:06:03] preach on what kind of music you listen
[2:06:05] to because it carries spirits rap music
[2:06:09] is not created to give you joy it's not
[2:06:11] created to give you love country music
[2:06:14] has not given made to make you more
[2:06:16] happy rock and roll music is not it's
[2:06:18] not there to make you joy to make you
[2:06:20] joyful or happy is there to anoint you
[2:06:23] with the wrong spirit to lead you down a
[2:06:25] path of self-destruction
[2:06:30] there's the right condition in their own
[2:06:33] condition I want to create the right
[2:06:35] atmosphere I'll bow your heads with me
[2:06:37] this morning every head bowed just play
