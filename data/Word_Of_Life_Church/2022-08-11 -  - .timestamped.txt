[0:01] it may seem strange to people outside of
[0:04] our ranks but
[0:06] we know that our companion
[0:10] that was given to us by God
[0:13] it's actually not just our choice
[0:17] now it is our choice
[0:19] but when you look at it in reality
[0:22] the church that you go to
[0:24] is not really your choice
[0:27] the pastor that you set under
[0:29] it should not be your choice I mean I I
[0:32] hear it all the time that there's people
[0:34] actually come to Happy Valley and I
[0:36] wasn't their choice of a pastor
[0:38] now it always makes me feel so wonderful
[0:42] I mean they're just being honest they
[0:44] would rather went here and there and
[0:45] there and and they're they're trying to
[0:47] make a point whenever they will tell me
[0:49] that I'm so glad that they always tell
[0:50] me the point afterwards because I'd
[0:53] probably just walk away very discouraged
[0:54] but but the point was that brother
[0:57] Donnie my first choice would have been
[0:58] to go here or there or there but I just
[1:01] kept feeling the Lord was leading me
[1:03] here and now I see why because under
[1:05] your ministry we've changed and we've
[1:07] done this and that and the other so it
[1:09] it might be the same way with a mate so
[1:12] the very one that God might have for you
[1:16] initially you might look at them and
[1:18] they might look at you and they might
[1:19] not like you at all
[1:22] and they think what in the world is a
[1:25] matter of that girl what in the world is
[1:26] the matter with that boy sort of like
[1:28] Carol did me when we initially met
[1:31] I knew she'd come around bless her heart
[1:35] she was just a little bit slower than me
[1:37] but she finally called up
[1:38] but God when God gives us that something
[1:42] it is truly a revelation now I'm sure
[1:46] that all of you young people sitting
[1:48] here tonight have had Revelations from
[1:49] God in your life have you not whether
[1:51] the serpent seed God sending a prophet
[1:53] whatever doctrinal saying and you may
[1:55] have heard it since she was a little boy
[1:57] or a girl but one day reading and
[2:00] reading the Bible listen to a tape
[2:02] setting in a service maybe at a used
[2:03] camp or a banquet all of a sudden that
[2:06] doctrine that you had heard all of your
[2:08] life and yet a preacher just went a
[2:10] little different angle than the way
[2:12] you'd ever heard it before and it's just
[2:13] like a light bulb switched on and you
[2:17] say oh my goodness I see it oh
[2:20] I'll see it and now they're saying you
[2:22] see what serpent say serpent said you've
[2:24] heard that since she was in Sunday
[2:25] school but all of a sudden it becomes so
[2:28] real to you what was that a revelation
[2:31] from God
[2:32] and a real mate that God puts together
[2:35] that's what they really are but brother
[2:38] Donnie what about the brown eyes and the
[2:40] blue eyes and the broad shoulders and
[2:42] the tall dark and handsome he might be
[2:45] short fat and squatty
[2:48] hey
[2:51] Sister Sarah are you saying amen
[2:53] I noticed it was just one-sided there
[2:59] but there's something about it when God
[3:02] puts you together
[3:04] that
[3:05] time can never separate sickness
[3:09] heartache can never separate I love the
[3:12] way that brother random deals with this
[3:14] in Kinsmen Redeemer When a Man Loves a
[3:17] Woman
[3:18] and marries her because she's just
[3:21] pretty
[3:22] there'll be an end to that
[3:25] but when a man finds a woman that he
[3:28] loves
[3:30] he don't know why
[3:32] now how odd is that
[3:36] now that would be the very opposite of
[3:38] the way most people would describe what
[3:41] we call Falling in Love
[3:44] y'all familiar with the term right I
[3:46] mean truth of goodness that ain't
[3:47] outdated falling in love so some people
[3:49] say it's love at first sight and truly
[3:51] for some it might be that way but for
[3:54] most people it's probably the term that
[3:56] I just used falling in love so you're
[3:58] around that person and you get to liken
[4:00] them more and more and you become more
[4:02] compatible and you all these things are
[4:04] going together so what's happening
[4:06] you're falling in love with that
[4:09] individual but if you can write down all
[4:13] the answers
[4:14] of why you love that person
[4:17] I would advise you not to marry them
[4:25] brother darling
[4:26] you didn't catch the quote
[4:29] he said when a man finds a woman that he
[4:31] loves
[4:32] he don't know why
[4:37] oh she's pretty she's you know her hair
[4:39] is certain certain color her eyes you
[4:42] know he's this tall dark handsome or
[4:44] short
[4:46] whichever I know and whenever they you
[4:50] know well and then that that well every
[4:52] one of those things you listed
[4:55] might change
[4:57] so as the electrician
[5:00] was up on the roof of a certain Baptist
[5:03] Church
[5:04] and he's repairing an electrical War
[5:09] and he gets into that wire
[5:11] and his body grounds The Wire
[5:14] and his face a married man with children
[5:18] nearly all of his face caught on fire
[5:21] and burn off
[5:24] so if his wife married him
[5:28] because he was handsome
[5:30] and she goes to the hospital his flesh
[5:33] is melted he has no eyes no nose true
[5:37] story
[5:38] no lips they do surgery after surgery
[5:41] after surgery
[5:44] as a matter of fact this man is the
[5:46] first one in the United States
[5:48] to get a full face transplant
[5:52] so if she married him because of looks
[5:54] she would have a right to divorce him
[5:57] and marry another
[5:59] but what if she married him because she
[6:02] loved him
[6:03] and she couldn't really Define oh yeah
[6:06] his looks with certain certain so-ands
[6:07] always eyes his hair this and that and
[6:09] the other you can ask a lot of the men
[6:11] in our church
[6:13] that hair might go in time
[6:17] oh
[6:20] and if it don't turn loose it will turn
[6:22] gray so it's going to turn one way or
[6:25] the other
[6:26] so when a person notice how he says this
[6:29] a man finds a woman he loves her and he
[6:31] don't know why he loves her and she
[6:34] finds the man that she loves
[6:37] or sisters this is a tough quote to
[6:39] swallow
[6:40] no matter what he looks like
[6:43] brother rob you should have said hey man
[6:45] right there buddy
[6:48] he loves her she loves him
[6:51] listen what this is
[6:53] that's an eternal mate in glory deaths
[6:57] nor nothing else can ever separate him
[6:59] because they are from
[7:02] eternity and stepped out into a space of
[7:06] time and will return back to Eternity
[7:10] eternity has dropped down in a body
[7:12] called time and it goes right back up
[7:14] into eternity again it can not perish
[7:19] so how do you know when someone is right
[7:22] the right one that God has for you you
[7:25] pray you look at it now there's nothing
[7:27] wrong with looking at the differences
[7:30] that you have and you've heard me say it
[7:32] before that whenever I'm counseling a
[7:34] couple that's going to be engaged to get
[7:36] married and most of them will come to me
[7:38] before they get engaged and we're
[7:39] praying about it and I will ask them do
[7:41] you love each other yes yes have you
[7:42] prayed about it yes if you talk to her
[7:44] father yes we've got his Blessing and
[7:46] then I'll say do you like each other
[7:49] yeah that's what they always do they
[7:51] always life what are your life when I
[7:53] say that
[7:54] now the reason I asked that is because
[7:56] after counseling 40 plus years
[8:00] of married people what I find is many
[8:03] times things that get on one another is
[8:06] things they don't like about one another
[8:09] it's not that they don't love anyone
[8:11] each other anymore but it's just the
[8:13] habitual day-to-day activity say some of
[8:18] you guys don't pick up your clothes very
[8:20] well
[8:22] now I'm not saying I'm just saying you
[8:24] know I'm just I'm not saying that
[8:26] there's anybody guilty here and you
[8:27] you've got you oh all right we've got a
[8:29] brother here under conviction lay your
[8:31] hand on your mercius and so he doesn't
[8:33] pick up his shoes very well and each of
[8:35] us have our makeup the girl was raised
[8:37] in her Norm the boy was raised in his
[8:40] norm and when you come together what are
[8:42] you going to do you're going to have
[8:43] trade-offs and you're going to find a
[8:45] new norm and create a new one but the
[8:48] difficult part is being able to merge
[8:51] together but if you've got real Love by
[8:53] which you can base it on your love will
[8:55] be stronger than your dislikes for this
[8:58] and other now my wife Carol she is a
[9:01] neat neat person I mean she loves Nate
[9:04] super neat no more neat the better it is
[9:07] well I'm the type of guy if I'm working
[9:09] on something I've got this drawer open
[9:11] that door open this door open it don't
[9:14] make no sense to me to get screw out and
[9:17] put it back together get it open it or
[9:18] get another screw out do that that don't
[9:20] make no sense so I've got cabinets down
[9:23] in my basement and I like to build
[9:25] Woodworking and taxidermy work and
[9:27] different things that I do down there so
[9:29] I've got cabinets to stand about this
[9:30] tall double doors you open them up well
[9:32] I've got wood here I've got you know
[9:34] feathers over here I've got snake skins
[9:36] here I've got this this so if I'm doing
[9:38] a Taxidermy something for some of some
[9:40] of the brothers I may have eight or ten
[9:42] of these cabinets open at one time
[9:45] that is until Carol comes downstairs
[9:50] now Carol's only going to be there 10 or
[9:52] 15 minutes
[9:54] but as Carol comes by each double door
[9:57] them double doors don't close
[9:58] automatically but Carol automatically
[10:01] closes them for me
[10:03] so she'll come through and close every
[10:04] one of them
[10:06] and when she leaves now I have to exert
[10:08] more energy to open every one of them
[10:11] back up
[10:12] let's see you're laughing
[10:14] but you'd be surprised how many people
[10:17] that I have counseled that have had
[10:18] things just this simple and causes the
[10:21] office problem ever was oh I dealt was
[10:24] an issue several years ago a man and
[10:27] wife it was nearly it was nearly a
[10:30] divorce case
[10:32] they called me it was screaming it was
[10:35] hollering it was awful
[10:39] and it was simply because she wanted
[10:41] breakfast for supper but he wanted
[10:43] supper for supper
[10:47] you think that's funny did you
[10:49] I'll call you the next time they call me
[10:55] did they love each other of course
[10:58] of course
[11:00] would they wish harm on either one no
[11:03] but it was just the likes and the
[11:05] dislikes real love can look at the flaws
[11:09] of that man that you want to marry
[11:13] and they don't have to say no they don't
[11:15] exist no I close my eyes to any of her
[11:18] faults you better look at them buddy
[11:21] that's going to be what's going to
[11:22] aggravate you
[11:24] but if you love her more than her faults
[11:26] and you love him more than his faults
[11:29] and his shortcomings ah sounds like to
[11:32] me you all stepped out of eternity
[11:33] together
[11:35] to live here in a body call time so
[11:38] don't be afraid to look at shortcomings
[11:41] and don't be afraid to be able to
[11:43] acknowledge well this is fine knowing
[11:44] you that that's okay I have no problem
[11:46] with that because our love will help us
[11:48] to deal with it that's the way Real Love
[11:50] Is
[11:51] that's the way he loves us
[11:54] he looked at us and knew
[11:57] we would cause him so much pain
[12:00] even after we got saved
[12:03] but he loved us so much he said I'm
[12:05] willing
[12:06] I'm willing to embrace you with all your
[12:10] shortcomings aren't you glad boy I'll
[12:12] tell you one day if Jesus didn't love me
[12:13] like that there'd be no hope for me
[12:16] how do you know when someone is right
[12:18] the right one God has for you again
[12:21] proach it prayerfully open-hearted open
[12:24] mind be able to look and see are you
[12:26] compatible and don't just look at him
[12:29] but whenever I'm counseling sisters I
[12:33] will tell them that young man that
[12:34] you're looking at see how he treats his
[12:37] mama
[12:38] see how he treats his sisters if he has
[12:41] them that'll give you a pretty good idea
[12:43] of how he's going to treat you because
[12:46] if he has inferiority complexes toward
[12:49] women if he's raised by a strong woman
[12:51] in the house he may take that out on you
[12:54] once you're married
[12:56] I might not go into this office here and
[12:58] finish this
[13:01] and it's the same way young men whenever
[13:04] you are looking to marry a girl
[13:07] look and see how she treats her daddy
[13:11] look and see how she treats her brothers
[13:13] her uncles look and see how she treats
[13:17] the pastor
[13:18] or other men of authority in her life
[13:22] because don't think she's going to
[13:24] despise the pastor and her father and
[13:27] every other male figure in her life and
[13:29] all of a sudden oh she's just going to
[13:32] melt in your arms and everything is
[13:34] going to be wonderful you're dreaming
[13:37] boy
[13:38] I should say you've got a nightmare
[13:41] why because there's something in her
[13:44] that has molded her that way real love
[13:47] can look at that now see some of y'all
[13:48] thinking I'll never be married I'd
[13:50] rather for you to delay it and find the
[13:52] right one I don't want to talk to you
[13:54] all in there
[13:57] right
[13:59] so when it's real love it can look at
[14:01] the flaws the shortcomings the mistakes
[14:03] and there's something in you that drives
[14:05] you toward that individual because it'll
[14:08] be God that pulls you together
[14:11] clear
[14:14] okay
