[music] Yeah, you're still rain [singing] and you're still God. And when [music] it feels all hope has [singing] faded, the heavy questions hit so hard. [music] And though my [singing] soul may feel forsen, you still [singing] reign and you're [music] still God.

Though voices whisper that [music and singing] you're not, you'll never leave me nor [music and singing] forsake me. Cuz you still [music and singing] reign and you're still God.

Jesus, [singing] for you are God and I am not. &gt;&gt; Though I [music and singing] can't see what's before me, &gt;&gt; I know [singing] that I can trust your heart. &gt;&gt; And this one truth [singing and music] will be my story. &gt;&gt; You still [singing] reign. You're still God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You are good [singing] and you are faithful. As you've been [singing] from the [music] start, you work all things for [singing and music] your glory.

[music] [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; I've seen a vision [music] harsh and sweet of one who gave all he had for me. [singing] [music] I've seen the passion of his [music] death and [singing] the forgiveness in his final breath now can never [singing] be [music] the same. My [singing] heart has been forever changed. [singing] [music] I've got to live in love and give the way he gave. [singing and music] Now I'm [music] giving my life [singing] away. [music] Laying [singing] it down on the altar. Now [singing] I'm giving [music] my life away. The [singing and music] very least I can offer is my all. [singing] So here I [music] stand today [singing] giving my life away. [singing and music] No earthly price could be [music and singing] too great. No sacrifice too [singing] much to make. No way of measuring [singing and music] the cost next to the blood of Calary's cross. [music] So if I live, I live for him. [singing] Or [music] if I die, I count [singing] it gain. My [music] life is not [singing] my own, but his from this day [singing] on. [music] Now [singing] I'm giving my life away. Laying [singing] [music] it down on the altar. Now I'm giving my life [singing] away. [music] The very least I [singing] can offer is my all. [music] So here I stand today, [music] giving [singing] my life away. [music] Now I'm giving my life away. [music] Laying [singing] it down on the altar. Now I'm giving [music] my life [singing] away. The very least I can offer [music] is [singing] my all. [music] So here I stand today giving [singing] my life [music] away. So [singing] here I stand [music] today giving [singing] my life away. [music] [applause] Amen. We enjoy those specials this evening. Brother Alexander, buddy, I don't know how long you've been hiding that, but you're in trouble now. [music] Amen. Let's all stand. We'll ask Brother Donnie to come and bring us the word of the Lord. Amen. We'll sing Leave it on my mind. The old house that I'm living [singing] in is needing [music] repair. [singing] The windows and the [music] shutters are letting in the cold [singing] cold air. I [music] say to myself, I'm going to fix them. when [singing] I can [music] get the time. But all [singing] I'm getting lately [music] is leaving on [singing] my mind. [music] And lately, all I've got is leaving [music and singing] on my mind. Oh, it seems [singing] that's [music] all I think about [music] so much [singing] of the time. [music] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; I got even [music] [singing] on my mind. Can we sing it together again everybody now? Thank you Lord. [music] Just close your eyes. You're talking about your new home. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So much [music and singing] of my time. I'll be soon and very soon [music] I'll leave [singing] a tr [music] behind. Lately [singing] I got [music] leaving [singing] on my mind. [music] Praise the Lord. Oh my. Well, we realize there's no place quite like home. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've traveled in different parts of the world and seen some beautiful places, some very interesting places, some places that were just places. But there's no place quite like your home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Might not be that fancy, might not be that big. It might not be anything like the homes you saw when you were gone, but it's yours. And if we feel that way about a natural place, &gt;&gt; what about a place that eye hath not seen, ear not heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man what God has prepared for us. &gt;&gt; I long to go, don't you? &gt;&gt; Every day that we live in this world is truly becoming a more unfitting place for us to live. If our old age wasn't enough, just all the sin and stuff around us would be enough to make us more homesick. &gt;&gt; But everything we deal with and everything we see around us and knowing that it's going to get worse, it just gives us a greater desire to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read about it tonight. Genesis 24. While you're turning there, I certainly want to thank all of you for um your nice cards and gift cards and um different things for pastor appreciation month. I thank you for that. Genesis chap 24 verse one. We'll read um down through verses u 7. And Abraham was old and well stricken in age. And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. Now, there's probably times in Abraham's life that he questioned those last three words, in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had, "Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh." Now, this sounds very peculiar and strange to us, but this was the most sacred vow that you could make. So, they'd put it under the thigh, just something like that. And then they would swear, whatever it was, dead wasp. And I will make these swear by the Lord, the God of heaven. I'd rather have him on the floor dead than on top of my head stinging me. You do want me moving by the spirit, right? Where was I? And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell. But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac." Now, to me, these two verses are so strange in the way that they're set forth. So, he points out to the servant. Now, notice what he says, "Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell." Well, Abraham, what are you doing there then? If these people are so repulsive to you and you don't even want your son to marry any of these daughters, why are you there? Because God led him into that place of trial and test. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But listen at him now in verse four. But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred. What was he saying? I'm not at home at this place. &gt;&gt; And take a wife unto my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, "Per adventure, the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land." You don't want to be here. It's evident. You don't want to be here. And you're sending me out there to bring a woman here. What if she don't want to come any more than you don't want to? What am I supposed to do? Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? So do you want me as the messenger with some message to take your son into what you left? &gt;&gt; You want me to take him back to the denominations, nations, denominations? You want me to return him back to Leodysia Pentecost, Catholicism, Protestantism? And Abraham said unto him, "Beware, beware that thou bring not my son thither again." Every man who preaches this end time message &gt;&gt; needs to keep this before him. &gt;&gt; Beware &gt;&gt; that you don't tra try to take this bride back to the country we come out of. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Lord God of heaven which took me. Now watch. He's going to bring these verses together. Which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from this. Now this is the answer to his question. So what if she won't come? She will come &gt;&gt; because the angel of the Lord will go before you and you will bring my son a wife into the new land. &gt;&gt; You understand what your land is, friends? &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced Satan hates this message right now more than he's ever hated it. &gt;&gt; Way back in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s, sure he hated it. But he hates it now more than ever. It's why he's fighting it. So he wants to question the credibility of the messenger. Question the credibility of the message. Why? In order to get you and I to lose the value of this land, our land is the message of this day. Unto thy seed will I give thee this land, and he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then. How could he go with such confidence? Because Abraham, which in this parable was a type of God, God told his messenger, "You go and my angel will go before you and you'll not preach in vain. The denominations will throw you out. They'll hate you. They'll get rid of you. But you will bring a bride &gt;&gt; for my son." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And where's this bride going back to? Where the father and the son is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; How many life to be remembered as we pray together? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads if you would hold your request in your heart. Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads in your divine presence, Father, we're so grateful that we've been given an ear to hear what the spirit is saying in this last day. We realize dear God that only you can illuminate human hearts. Only you can enlighten the spiritual eye. Only you can break open your word and make your word so clear that it will help us to see where we are, where we come from, and where we're going. As we look in the scriptures tonight, we pray, Father, that you would help us, that we would be benefited by looking at these great things. It's a story that has been told so many, many years ago. But to us, it's not just a story of history, but in it is present living truth, which is being lived out by people that are on the face of the earth this very day. speak to us tonight, Father, from your word. We ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. So our father knew that when the angels left his presence and fell from what the New Testament calls an estate. Now we think of an estate as being a house, land, whatever your idea of that would be. You know, if you like horses and you'd think of the white painted fence, or if you like cattle, you'd think of a woven wire or whatever you would think an estate would be, or a fine fancy house and a great subdivision and lighted gates and all that sort of thing. But when we're talking about angelic estates, we're not talking about a palace or a castle made of stone or brick or mortar, but we're talking about a position in a realm which we still understand so very little about. So they were given the ability to appear, disappear. They were given the ability to be able to manifest and come from where they were in eternity when the father created time. And they would be able to merge from eternity into time, go from time back into eternity. They could look at the sphere of the universe, the stars, the planets, all the things that he made and their relation to that. To what extent we don't yet know. So this was the boundaries of their estate. They were given the privilege to stand before God's holy presence. They had never done any wrong up to this time. But they were placed in a similar state that Adam was in the beginning when God placed him on the earth. And it was a state of a lapse of [snorts] time by which they would be able to make a choice. And in there they would forfeit one thing to get another. So when the New Testament writer says that they fell from their former estate and then they were moved into a new sphere that they were held in chains of darkness. Now, God knew that when those angels did that, they actually fell. Of course, before man was brought upon the earth. But God knew that Satan, Lucifer, the lightbringer, morning one, that he would gather them under his opaces, his headship, because he himself would never be able to have a worldwide dominion and a worldwide kingdom if he was the only one in it. &gt;&gt; He's not omnipotent. He does not have omnipresence, omnisientship. He doesn't know all things. He cannot be at all places at one time by his omnipresence. &gt;&gt; So, father knew he would need help. And these angels when they made up their mind, I I I I can't I can't even imagine it that they decided from this day on I will praise him no more. &gt;&gt; From this day forward, I will never love him. I will never give him my all again. This day I walk away from Almighty God and I join my allegiance to Lucifer. From this day I lay aside righteousness, purity, holiness. I lay aside an element of divinity which has been shared with me by Almighty God. I lay aside truth, morality, character, trust, and from this day on I choose darkness. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; immorality, sin, perversion, treachery, &gt;&gt; darkness. This is my choice. I will give my power that God gave to me. I will give my angelic influence, my ability to appear and disappear. I will give it to Lucifer. In the future of whatever lays ahead for God to unfold, I will no longer aid in the kingdom of heaven. I will oppose it with everything I can. I will hate God from this very moment. I will hate everything God loves and everything that God sets his attention toward. I give my all from this day on to despise it, &gt;&gt; to do everything I can to destroy it. They've kept their word. &gt;&gt; Yes, they have. Now to me it's one thing for angels to do that for human beings. Now remember there is no redemption for an angel. &gt;&gt; Once an angel ever makes that choice they can never come back. &gt;&gt; There's probably people sitting here tonight. I know people actually that have told me before that they gave the devil their soul. &gt;&gt; They turned their soul over to Satan. And then I've had them people ask me, "Do you think there's any way back from me?" And this has been my answer every time. If you want to come back, that's answer enough. There's a way back. But if AN ANGEL WERE TO ASK ME TONIGHT, PREACHER, is there any way for me to get back to God? I would have to stand and look that demon in the face and say, "You crossed the line and you made your choice when you gave up your estate. Therefore, I am against you and I tell you, you are forever separated from the presence of God, and there is no way back for you. &gt;&gt; Now, God knew these beings would be quite the enemy. So God started letting the angels, the elect ones, according to what Paul called them in Timothy, as soon as man was brought on the earth, the first angels that we see appear actually not just mystically, but in a visible form were not angels of darkness, but rather angels of light. As a matter of fact, when you study from the Old Testament to the New, the one which takes precedent in the scripture is always the angels of light and purity which appear many more times in the scripture in the visible realm than do fallen angels. Now they do appear of course BUT IT'S AS IF GOD WANTED HIS children to know you are not here alone. Now, I believe that the Lord wants his children to be a little bit more understanding and a little bit, brother Joe, more in tune with this realm that we have access to and these beings that God has already been using all of our whole lives. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT HE WANTS US TO be in more contact with that supernatural realm than we ever have before. You say, "Why would you even say that?" Because we can look around and see for sure that the people of the world are in closer contact with the regions of the lost than they've ever been. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can see that hell has opened up her gates &gt;&gt; and vomited out as it were her influence upon the inhabitants of the earth. Well, if if hell has done that, do you mean to tell me that we as Christians believe hell has done that and heaven has not opened up its gates for the angelic influence that we need as the people OF GOD? THANK GOD for the blood. Thank God for the cross. Thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But I want to tell you tonight, God knows with all of that awesome thing that I just mentioned to you, there is also another realm &gt;&gt; that he wants to influence our lives daily. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's angels. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Read with me in Exodus chapter 14 verse 19. And the angel of God, notice now it's not plural but singular. and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them. And the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them. Now I want you to notice the angel of God which was in front of the children of Israel, HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY offense and defense. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. So all he did was change his position from being in front of them to moving behind them. And now he's going to blind their enemy. And it was the same angel of God. Well, if he loved them that much, what about you and I? &gt;&gt; Now, notice what he did. that he separated his people from the Egyptians by this angelic presence. And this angelic presence, it made darkness on one side and on the other side it was light by the same angel. Well, it's no paradox to me that the very thing that gives the bride people the light and the illumination of this message, that same angel causes darkness to those who will stumble at it. They'll look right at the very same message and what they see as flaws and mistakes and a human being and they JUST AND THEY STUDY the message for that sort of thing. And you and I study it for rapturing faith. Why? Depends on which side of the pillar of fire you're on. &gt;&gt; And it depends upon whether the angel of GOD WAS FIRST AT your forefront in order to defend you and then moves BEHIND YOU. BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND, the only reason he moved TO THEIR BACK PART was because the enemy was fixing to attack them from behind. He had not LEFT THEM. HE ONLY CHANGED HIS PLACE of defense because that's where they needed it the most at the present time. SO SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO NOT SEE THE angel of the Lord in front of you and it don't seem like that he's leading you very far and leading you very fast, it could be that he's moved his position behind you because he sees your enemy coming up behind you and that's where you need him the most. &gt;&gt; Can we trust his leadership? &gt;&gt; I believe we can. Notice in 2 Chronicles chap 32 verse 21. And the Lord sent an angel. I want you to notice in the Bible that it would be said many times that it would be more than one. And yet sometimes one angel would be able to take care of multiplied thousands as we read the other example to you a week or so ago. And it's amazing to me because it's showing to us the angelic hierarchy that still exists even though there might have been oh my thousands of demons but yet one angel of God in the proper order of hierarchy could outpower thousands of the devil's angels. So the Lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valor and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was COME INTO THE HOUSE of his god, THEY THAT CAME FORTH OF HIS OWN BOWELS slew him there with the sword. Now listen, one angel come against all the captains and all the mighty men and HE CALLS THIS KING. NOW THAT ANGEL COULD HAVE KILLED HIM, BUT HE CHOSE NOT TO. HE CHOSE to let this king return back in shame and humiliation and let him go back to the house of his God and let someone from his own family kill him. Now you believe what you want to believe. God still has them same angels at your back today. &gt;&gt; NOTICE 1 TIMOTHY 5:21. I CHARGE THEE BEFORE GOD and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect ANGELS. NOW HERE THE ANGELS OF God are brought into the court as it were and the magistrate of the first church age is bringing them before the COURT OF GOD. I CHARGE YOU BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND before the elect ANGELS THAT THOU OBSERVE these things without preferring one oh my before another doing nothing by partiality. What a charge that Paul would charge them not to have respect to persons. Isn't that strange and unusual? NOW YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT WE AS THE PEOPLE OF GOD need to remember that same thing that to have respect to persons is sin. Right? &gt;&gt; So if this man and that man and that man, we treat them in a certain way, they get in a certain sin and they do a certain THING AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE CHURCH gets caught exactly in the same way and we treat them different because well maybe they give more in the offering or because of this or that or the other. ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE, THOSE who do that are sinning &gt;&gt; according to the book of James. Now, if there are circumstances in the situation, sure, we look at the circumstances. But Paul ain't addressing difference in circumstances. He's identifying with the same scenario, with the same setting, and yet you handle it different because you like this person better or they're kin to a deacon or kin to the pastor, you know, however it works. NOW NOTICE IT WAS THEN THAT the angels of God were brought into the court of the magistrate and that Paul is now charging the saints of God of that day before God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels of God. Notice with me in Psalm 34:7, just in case you're wondering, how do the angels of God relate to us? THE ANGEL OF THE Lord encampeth round about them that fear him &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; deliverest them. &gt;&gt; Anybody believe this scripture tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you TO NOTICE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. NOT THE angels &gt;&gt; of the Lord, &gt;&gt; but the angel of the Lord. This is the Lord's angel. &gt;&gt; You see, the Lord God himself has an angel. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; his theophonyic appearance which appeared before Moses and before the elders. Anybody know who that was? Christ himself. &gt;&gt; It was before he became Jesus. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S ANGEL. IT'S GOD'S ACT OF condensation of working himself down to take up a human body on THE EARTH. SO GOD MADE HIMSELF AN angel or a theophony just like he made your theophony before he made your body. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me tonight because you're made in the exact form or format that God chose to make himself. &gt;&gt; So, the angel of the Lord appeared in and now remember this could not be said about any other angel even in THE ELECT ANGELS BECAUSE NOT ONE ANGEL could be with every saint of God all over the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS IS NOT YOUR PERSONAL THEOPHONY. THIS IS NOT YOUR OWN PRIVATE GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT THIS IS THE OMNIPOTENT, omnipresent angel of God himself. &gt;&gt; I DON'T JUST HAVE AN ANGEL that will stand by me and say, "The Lord rebuke thee." But the Lord himself can say, "I rebuke you, Satan." &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to sing. I'm going to go ahead and say it to you right now. I'm jumping ahead of myself. BUT EVEN THOUGH THESE ANGELS ARE AS GREAT AS THEY ARE, YET THERE'S THINGS about the economy of God that I have more jurisdiction than an angel does. &gt;&gt; Not only me, BUT EVERY SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD THAT'S FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN THINGS that angels cannot touch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; NOW, WANT YOU NOTICE WHENEVER MEN OF GOD HAVE TO STAND UP AND PRAY. THE EXAMPLE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT IS NOT THAT THEY WOULD DO as the angels did in the Old Testament AND SAY, "THE LORD REBUKED THEE." But they stood there themselves and said, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I resent you. I rebuke you. Come out." What happened, Harry? HOW COULD MORTAL MEN STAND ON THE earth and not invoke the presence or the name of God in the same way an angel could? An angel CANNOT DO THAT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S NOT UNDER THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS NOT SHARING HIS NAME WITH AN angel in the same way he is with sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. LISTEN TO THIS. THE PROPHET SAYS IT THIS WAY. MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD ENCAMP about everyone here. MAY THE GREAT POWER OF THE RESURRECTED LORD JESUS JUST shadow over. MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD, I LOVE THIS, SPLIT their wings over THIS BUILDING AND they distill do drops of divine healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Drop on every sick person. MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD SPLIT THEIR WINGS AND may they distill dew drops. THANK YOU LORD. DISTILL DEW DROP DROPS OF DIVINE HEALING DROP ON EVERY SICK PERSON. I WANT YOU TO NOTICE NOW THE PROPHET WOULD actually make angelic visitation a part of the way that he prayed for their services TO GO. SO HE DIDN'T JUST ASK, "LORD JESUS, PLEASE COME. LORD JESUS, COME AND BE WITH US." BUT OVER and over again, HE WOULD PRAY, "LORD, LET your angels come. Let them energize. Let them DO THIS. LET THEM DO THAT. LET them do that." I wonder how many of us do that. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; DO WE EVEN PRAY FOR THE ANGELS OF GOD TO COME &gt;&gt; and be in our midst? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, saints. NOW, &gt;&gt; MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD SPLIT THEIR WINGS OVER THIS BUILDING. NOW, REMEMBER, IT'S NOT SAID IN THE Bible that all angels have wings. &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE ONE THE PROPHET SAW, he never mentioned no wings on them at all. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But apparently, there are some THAT DO. NOW HE SAID, "MAY PARDON from sin drop on every sinner." CAN YOU IMAGINE RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING TONIGHT ARE THE ANGELS OF God and THEY'RE WANTING TO SPLIT THEIR WINGS RIGHT HERE IN THIS SERVICE AND BRING down the distilled drops of healing for everyone that's sick. AND IF THERE'S A PERSON HERE THAT'S LOST OUT OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD, THEY WANT TO DROP MERCY. Oh hallelujah. PARDON THE SIN DROP ON EVERY SINNER. MAY THEY BE SAVED AND BE HEALED. FOR WE ASK IN THE NAME OF THY beloved child Jesus Christ. AMEN. SO HE WOULD ACTUALLY PRAY AND I AND I'VE been saying the last couple OF WEEKS AND FOUND ONE prayer after ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER THAT HE WOULD ASK THE LORD to send the angels and let the angels do this and the angels do that. And I began to ponder. I'm thinking, MY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME BECAUSE IT WAS ELEAZAR that was sent with a message and HE COULD TAKE ASSURANCE BECAUSE ABRAHAM HAD ALREADY TOLD HIM THE ANGEL of God is going to go before you. So whenever Rebecca goes down, another prophet tells us that he believed that the ANGEL OF THE LORD SPOKE TO REBECCA DOWN THERE ABOUT 30 MINUTES BEFORE ELEAZAR EVER GOT THERE. So the Lord was moving on both ends OF THE SPECTRUM. AND HOW WAS IT THAT IT WAS COMING to pass? Angels of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS JOURNEY WITHOUT angelic assistance. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. SATAN WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CULMINATE HIS HEADSHIP in the earth AND BECOME WHAT HE WANTS TO BE WITHOUT ANGELIC ASSISTANCE. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? EVEN IN THE REALM OF POLITICS AND ELECTIONS AND SO ON, DEMONS GET ON PEOPLE. DEMONS WILL GET ON PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WILL RAISE UP AND BECOME LEADERS. And it absolutely astounds, you know, the the politicians CUZ THEY SAY, "HOW COULD THAT PERSON HAVE EVER raised up to BECOME THIS OR THAT? THERE'S NO WAY TO BELIEVE THAT it could even happen." Demonic power. DEMONS WILL GET ON THEM AND THEN THEM other demons WILL GET ON OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY'LL RALLY AROUND THEM and rally around them and they're not EVEN REALLY A GREAT POLITICIAN. THEY DON'T HAVE TO. THEY DON'T HAVE TO EVEN BE THAT DEMONS GET ON THEM. WELL, WE CAN SEE THE negative side. What about the positive side? IF DEMONS CAN DO THAT, CANNOT THE ANGELS OF GOD BE ABLE TO COME AMONG US AND BE ABLE TO DISTILL THE DEW DROPS OF GOD'S GRACE and mercy to us as we need them. &gt;&gt; NOTICE AGAIN HE SAID NOW LORD REALIZING THAT STANDING NEAR THERE'S PERHAPS MANY many angels. Now this is the reason why he would say they were there cuz there's believers here. NO DOUBT THERE'S MANY, MANY ANGELS HERE CUZ THERE'S BELIEVERS HERE. SO YOU MEAN ANGELS GO TO CHURCH, TOO? &gt;&gt; GOD GOES TO CHURCH. BELIEVERS GO TO CHURCH. And angels go to church cuz we come to church. &gt;&gt; SO THE ANGELS DON'T JUST COME IN HERE AND HANG AROUND AND SAY, "MAN, ain't this church nice? This is so cool." They show up on Monday. They just sit here all day on Monday and Tuesday and just say, "This is really a nice place. This is really comfortable. I LIKE BEING HERE. THEY'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE OF THAT. THEY'RE HERE because of you. &gt;&gt; OH MY. CUZ THERE'S BELIEVERS HERE. AND THE BIBLE says the angels OF GOD ARE ENCAMPED. NOT GOING BACK AND FORTH, BUT THEY'RE ENCAMPED ABOUT THOSE THAT FEAR HIM. MANY MORE ARE BEING CALLED FROM GLORY TONIGHT TO ENCAMP AROUND THOSE WHO RAISE their hand &gt;&gt; to teach them the way of life, &gt;&gt; how they should live. SO YOU MEAN THE ANGELS OF GOD WHEN A PERSON WOULD GET SAVED, THEY WERE BEING CALLED. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHY? A NEW POST OF DUTY WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THEM. AND WHERE WAS IT? PEOPLE THAT JUST GAVE THEIR HEART TO GOD. AND THEM ANGELS ARE GOING TO HELP THEM ALONG IN LIFE TO DO WHAT? TO TEACH THEM THE WAY OF LIFE, HOW THEY SHOULD LIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU MEAN angels are GOING TO ASK SO is the angel going to take a MESSAGE BOOK AND SET UP IN THE PULL PIT OR OR TAKE A MESSAGE TAPE OR OR YOUR BIBLE and you and the ANGEL HAVE BIBLE STUDY AT HOME? NO. BUT THERE WILL BE A MAN ANOINTED BY THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGEL TO HIM TO ELIMINATE HIS WORD AND THEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL SEND YOURS AND THE ANGELIC BEINGS ARE CONNECTING WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAY, "FEED ME, LORD. FEED ME, LORD. HELP ME DENY JESUS. I GOT NEEDS. I GOT THAT. AND THEN DON'T YOU THINK, WELL, IT'S JUST I I'M PRAYING. I'M PRESSING IN. THANK GOD YOU NEED TO DO THAT. BUT REMEMBER, YOU GOT SOMEBODY STANDING BY YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT HALLELUJAH. YOU GOT SOMEBODY THAT'S STANDING RIGHT THERE BY YOU AND THEY'RE TRYING TO NUDGE YOU ALONG. YOU BETTER BELIEVE, FRIENDS, DEMONS COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, TOO. AND THEY'LL OCCUPY YOUR MIND. THEY'LL GET YOU ALL BUSY ABOUT THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER. YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR WORK TOMORROW. YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS OR THAT. THAT'S DEMONS. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, THERE'LL BE SOMETHING THERE. KEEP FOCUSED. KEEP YOUR MIND ON THE WORD. KEEP LOOKING. KEEP PRAISING GOD. AND YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S YOU SAYING THAT THAT AIN'T YOU. IT'S THE ANGEL OF GOD. THEY'RE CAMPING ROUND ABOUT YOU. THEY'RE TRYING TO ENERGIZE YOU. THEY'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here by this sacred desk. I found it amazing how many times brother Brandham used this word sacred desk, sacred [snorts] place, &gt;&gt; sacred pullpit. He used his words over and over and over again. SO IF IT'S THE SAME STAYING AT HOME AND PLAYING A TAPE, &gt;&gt; wonder why he didn't call it a sacred tape player. &gt;&gt; Wonder why he didn't sell you sitting in your your recliner. He said there's a sacred lazy boy. &gt;&gt; There's a sacred stereo. WHY WOULD HE CALL A PIECE OF WOOD USED IN A CHURCH A SACRED DESK? BECAUSE THE PRESENCE of God is there anointing men to speak THE WORD. AND THAT MAKES IT SACRED. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME YOU CAN BE JUST AS GOOD A CHRISTIAN SAYING AT HOME AS YOU COME THE HOUSE OF GOD. NOT ACCORDING TO WHAT MALACHI 4 says. YOU CAN'T DO IT. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOUR HOME, SURE, YOUR HOME OUGHT TO BE SANCTIFIED FOR THE LORD. YES, IT SHOULD BE. BUT SHOW ME ONE TIME WHERE HE EVER SAID YOUR COUCH WAS SACRED, YOUR RECLINER WAS SACRED, YOUR KITCHEN TABLE WAS SACRED. YOU'LL NEVER REPLACE THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH YOUR HOUSE. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice how he says this. There's believers here and the Bible said the angels of God are in camp, NOT GOING BACK AND FORTH. SO THE ANGELS JUST DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH. They camp around you. They set up their tents. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, they're with you. They're encamped about you. &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD. MANY MORE ARE BEING CALLED FROM GLORY. &gt;&gt; WELL, I guess I've got one question. Who's calling them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Them people that just got saved. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BEING CALLED FROM GLORY. THE NIGHT I GOT SAVED, I call one from glory. &gt;&gt; THE NIGHT YOU GOT SAVED, THE NIGHT YOU GOT SAVED, THE NIGHT YOU GOT SAVED, YOU GETTING SAVED SETTING YOU ON YOUR JOURNEY, CAROL, YOU [screaming] CALL THE ANGEL OF GOD AND HE'S NEVER LEFT YOU. &gt;&gt; IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE HOW MANY TIMES WE FALL SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. WE MAY PULL AWAY FROM HIM, BUT HE DON'T NEVER PULL AWAY FROM US BECAUSE HE IS A SIGN TO US AND HE WILL NEVER LEAVE US, BROTHER, SISTER. NO MATTER HOW [screaming] LOW WE GET, HOW SICK WE GET, HOW DOWN WE GET, THEY ARE CALLED HERE BY US AT OUR NEW BIRTH. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON THEY WILL LEAVE, AND THAT'S WHEN THEY TAKE US HOME. THEY ARE WITH US THROUGH OUR LIFE'S JOURNEY. [applause] THIS IS PART OF YOUR DOWY, &gt;&gt; REBECCA. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here by this sacred desk. This is a wonderful moment. The angels of God have set down their camps along the side of this place tonight. First written in the word, the angels OF GOD ARE ENCAMPED ABOUT THOSE THAT FEAR HIM. AND IN THE GREAT UNSEEN world that is now around us, stirring our emotions to repentance. &gt;&gt; So you mean angels, brother D, move our emotions. I know there's some of people around the message that hate emotions. THEY DON'T WANT NO EMOTIONS IN THEIR CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BUT I I QUOTE WHAT THE PROPHET SAID. ANY ANY RELIGION WITHOUT EMOTIONS DEAD NEED TO BE BURIED. &gt;&gt; THE ANGELS OF GOD, DEMONS WILL ANOINT PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS OUT HERE. THEY WILL HAVE PROTESTS AND RIOTS AND THEY GO TO BALL GAMES AND MY TURNS FROM A BALL GAME TO A BRAWL. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES THAT? DEMON SPIRITS GET AMONG THEM AND THEN DEMONS SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THIS INTO A BRAWL AND A BIG RIOT. WHY? TO KILL SOMEBODY, TO INJURE SOMEBODY. WHAT'S DOING IT? DEMONS MOVING THE EMOTIONS OF THEM PEOPLE. IF DEMONS CAN DO THAT TO A ROWDY CROWD, WHAT ABOUT THE ANGELS OF GOD TO SANCTIFY PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE LORD? CAN NOT THOSE ANGELS OF GOD MOVE OUR EMOTIONS TO REPENTANCE? &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. STIRRING OUR EMOTIONS TO REPENTANCE AND TO BRING EVIL BEFORE OUR EYES. &gt;&gt; SO THE ANGELS OF GOD WILL OPEN [screaming] OUR EYES AND HELP US to see this is wrong, that's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we have done wrong with penitent tears. &gt;&gt; We surrender our evil ways, Lord, and ask FOR DIVINE MERCY. MAY THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO HAS PROMISED THIS MERCY GIVE IT TO EACH OF US AS WE HUMBLY BEG and ask God to fulfill his word and to mold our lives and our character to fit his word. &gt;&gt; Tell us that many TIMES FRIENDS THE EMOTIONAL STIR that you feel and you don't want nobody to see it. Would you say well what will my friends say? I DON'T CARE WHAT my friends say. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND? SOMETIMES WHAT YOU'RE FEELING, IT'S AN angel of the Lord standing right there by you, &gt;&gt; MOVING YOU TO CRY, MOVING YOU TO RAISE YOUR HANDS, AND you're ashamed to touch. I SAY, SHAME ON US, &gt;&gt; SHAME ON US. ANGEL OF GOD WILL NEVER MOVE US TO DO ANYTHING contrary to his word. in the church house. Not in your house, but in the church house, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I believe the angels of God encamp around because &gt;&gt; of the saints gathering there, [snorts] &gt;&gt; brother Donnie, do I have to be in church? Won't my angel go with me at home? Yep, sure will. That's right. &gt;&gt; But you and your wife and your two young ones, how many angels you figure you got there? &gt;&gt; All right. So, if y'all bring your angels to church &gt;&gt; with the rest everybody else bringing their angels to church, then look around here tonight. &gt;&gt; How many more angels we got than if you'd stayed home? &gt;&gt; So, the two hosts have gathered tonight. Mayhem the angelic host and the earthly host. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, [groaning] hallelujah. &gt;&gt; NOTICE OF GOD. HE SAID THE SAINTS OF GOD HERE ARE GATHERED THERE. IT'S A noted place for God where he comes and meets with his people. SO YOU MEAN A CHURCH THAT'S DEDICATED to the Lord is a noted place &gt;&gt; TO GOD &gt;&gt; WHERE HE COMES AND MEETS WITH HIS PEOPLE IS ALWAYS SEEMED kindly good to me &gt;&gt; to be in the living room with a bowl of ice cream and a glass of good old southern sweet tea you're amending brother Donnie from your favorite CH EXCUSE ME AMEN BROTHER DONNIE PREACH IT, BROTHER. I'M WITH YOU. I'M BEHIND YOU. YEAH. Way behind me. &gt;&gt; WAY behind me. &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN IT'S A NOTED PLACE OF GOD. AND HERE [screaming] OUR prophet said, "It's always seemed kind of good to me to be in a church. I don't understand people who claim they have the Holy Ghost." Then I ain't talking about if they're sick. I ain't talking about if they go to church to go to. I'm talking about they got churches to go to, but they think they're doing the will of God by staying home and pushing play. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother D. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD ASSIGNED these angels their position. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I just think about it, you think I'm crazy anyway, but sometimes I wonder what my angel done before I come along. I MEAN, IT'S ASSIGNED TO ME. &gt;&gt; AND I JUST CAN'T KEEP FROM BELIEVING THE ANGEL THAT'S BEEN ASSIGNED TO ME is more powerful than the demons that have been assigned to me from the other side to try to wear me down. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe God. Give me a little T90 amp of an angel. It goes around like this. Oh, Jesus. Jesus. I'm scared of them demons. No, I can't believe that. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOD ASSIGNED THE PROPHET OF GOD, A LITTLE OLD PUNY ANGEL ABOVE WHEN HE WALKED in that room, 200 LB OLIVE OLIVE COLORED SKIN, standing there with his arms cross, HE MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE A MIGHTY ONE. COME ON, SOMEBODY. I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR ANGEL IS SOME TYPE OF LITTLE WEAK little tiny THING THAT'S HERE TONIGHT AND ROLLS OVER AT EVERY LITTLE DEVIL. THE ONLY ONE THAT ROLLS OVER IS US BECAUSE WE DON'T IDENTIFY. YOU'VE GOT AN ANGEL OF GOD THAT GOES WITH YOU TO WALMART. HE GOES WITH YOU TO THE GROCERY STORE. HE GOES WITH YOU ON VACATION. HE GOES WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO TO CHURCH. OH, HALLELUJAH. HE'S ASSIGNED TO [screaming] YOU. [applause] FATHER, may the Holy Spirit come near. May that same pillar of fire that led the children of Israel move down, settle around the holy place, this pulpit. May your angels of God take their position and places positionally out among the people. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY'RE NOT JUST WITH THE PREACHERS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THEIR POSITION IS NOT FOR ALL OF THEM TO BE WITH ME. &gt;&gt; But you, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; POSITIONALLY OUT AMONG THE people speaking to their hearts, getting them to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's perfectly predestination. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in question answer 64, it's not promised that sinners has angels, &gt;&gt; only the redeemed. Right. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES WOULD WE STAGGER AND STUMBLE OVER THE WORD OR THE WILL OR THE GREAT PROGRAM OF GOD AND SOMEWHERE A VOICE OUTSIDE OF US, OUTSIDE of our own intellect would say, "Believe. &gt;&gt; Believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe. And a lot of you for years have been thinking that's you. &gt;&gt; It's not you, it's yours. &gt;&gt; Your you part is like my you part. It ain't no good sometimes. &gt;&gt; And it'll doubt and it'll question and it'll, you know, I don't understand. I don't understand. But yours, yours will come and say, believe. Believe. What's it doing? Accumulating faith. The prophet said there in one place that there was a warfare going on. Streaks was ALL OVER THE BUILDING AND THEM DEMONS THERE WAS SAYING KEEP THEM FROM BELIEVING. KEEP THEM FROM BELIEVING. NOW YOU imagine living in a world where you would hear this and you'd hear them DEMONS AND THEY KNEW THE DEVILS HAVE GOT ENOUGH SENSE TO KNOW. NOW A LOT OF THE MESSAGE FOLKS DON'T BELIEVE IN GATHERING TOGETHER BUT IT SHOWS HOW DUMB THEY ARE BECAUSE DEMONS GATHER TOGETHER FOR STRENGTHS. AMEN. THEY GATHERED TOGETHER AND HE SAID WHENEVER THEY'D STAND THERE, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE DISCERNMENT SOMEBODY UP HERE HAVE CANCER AND THAT DEVIL WOULD GET SCARED AND GO TO CALLING ON SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE AND IT WOULD RUN A STREAK FROM HERE TO THERE. THIS [screaming] DEVIL TOLD ON THAT DEVIL. I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHEN THEY GOT BACK DOWN IN HELL IF THEY DIDN'T DUKE IT OUT. SAID, "WHY IN THE WORLD YOU DO THAT TO ME? HE HADN'T EVEN SEEN ME YET. YOU CHICKEN. YOU LITTLE COWARD. YOU [screaming] YOU TOLD HIM EXACTLY WHERE I WAS. I LOVE IT THOUGH. SO INSTEAD OF ONE DEVIL BEING CAST OUT, TWO GOT CAST OUT. [applause] THEY REALIZED THEIR STRENGTH AND THEM COMING TOGETHER. ALL SAINTS OF GOD. CAN'T YOU SEE WHY WE NEED TO ASSEMBLE OURSELVES TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Oh [laughter] my. Notice what they do. Speaking to their hearts, getting them to believe. TAKE AWAY ALL UNBELIEF. MAY IT GO FROM THIS BUILDING TONIGHT THAT IT might be a great marvelous meeting. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, be well with us. Lord, we realize that opposition stands close. Satan is raging. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is trying to settle in upon the people. Unbelief is trying to settle in on the people. But now notice how he prays. &gt;&gt; Yet the angels are at their position. YES, &gt;&gt; THEY'RE STANDING READY. &gt;&gt; EVEN THE BLACK FLAGS will wave or the white flags of heaven will wave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You imagine every service this place is full and there's beings there waving their flags. keep them from believing. Oh, it's too hot in there. IT'S TOO COLD. OH GOD, I'M ABOUT to die. I'm going outside. Oh Lord, I can't sit still. OH GOODNESS, I DID. I LEAVE MY CURLING IRON ON. OH NO, I LEFT the crockpot on. OH MY GOODNESS. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS? &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER DONNIE STORING THAT STRAIGHT AT YOU. HE DON'T LIKE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU KNOW HE AIN'T SHOOK YOUR HAND AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S TALKING TO YOU? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU COULD SEE THE FACE OF THAT DEMON IS SCARING YOU TO DEATH. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT AT the same time, the angels of God are saying, "This is your night. &gt;&gt; Believe, listen, focus on the word. Tonight is your night of deliverance." Glory to God. I believe it myself. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH TO GOD. AND RIGHT THERE, THAT WAR IS GOING ON. THEM DEMONS ARE WAVING THEIR BLACK FLAG AND THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE SEND. COME ON, SAINTS. RALLY AROUND THE BANNER. RALLY AROUND THE BLOOD STAINED BANNER OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. YOU KNOW WHAT A FLAG IS, DON'T YOU? IT'S A BANNER BY WHICH YOU'VE GOT TO BE IDENTIFIED. THE DEVIL WAVES THEIR BLACK FLAGS OF UNBELIEF AND FEAR AND DOUBT AND FRUSTRATION. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE SIDES WITH ONE OR THE OTHER. I SAY RIGHT HERE TONIGHT, WE TAKE OUR SIDES WITH THE FLAG OF THE HEAVENLIES. THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE WAVING THE WHITE FLAGS OF HEALING AND DELIVERANCE AND PEACE. [applause] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. Praise God. [sighs and gasps] Brother Daryl, I wonder when I said in this, I wonder what the people of that day, you know, this is in the 50s. I wonder what the people of that day thought when they would hear these things. What is this man? What's he even talking about? Why? He was talking things that had never been taught &gt;&gt; before. Don't you understand what it was? God had sent a window &gt;&gt; to the supernatural. &gt;&gt; We hadn't had one in decades. The Gentiles had never had one. It was like this solid wall right here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We couldn't look beyond it. We couldn't go beyond it. &gt;&gt; But God sent simply sent a Malachi 4, a geometric design of four and five and 17 and 30 and 10 1 and 7. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD OPENED UP THIS THIS VISION into the supernatural and he went over there AND SAID, "HEY CHILDREN, THESE IS OVER HERE AND THAT'S OVER THERE." NOT ONLY THAT, I SAW ALL OF YOU ALL OVER THERE. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. GOD OPENED UP THAT. IT WAS THERE ALL THE TIME. WE DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE NO WAY TO LOOK IN THAT, BUT GOD SAID, "HERE, WOW. LET ME raise the window." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. LET THE ANGELS OF GOD TAKE THEIR POSITION, their places tonight along these lines of people and help us now to recognize your omnipresence. &gt;&gt; Your omniresence. [laughter] I love reminding the devil. He don't have this. He don't have omnipresence. He don't have omnipotence. He's not all knowing. He don't know near as much as you and I think that he does. I love reminding him every now and then, you had a day you started. That means you got a day you going to die. And when there ain't no more devil, I'll still be shouting down the hills of glory. When there ain't no more cancer, when there ain't no more sickness, no more disease. THANKS BE TO GOD. AMEN, CHILDREN. WE WILL BE THERE FOR THE ETERNAL AGES WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; I say we rejoice a little bit now while wait till we get over y. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now listen carefully. An angels a servant. We're sons and daughters. Which is the most thought of, your servant or your son or daughter? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel. Yes, sir. Because he's a son. Oh, that's right, my brother, sister. I I DON'T BELIEVE THIS SIDE OF ETERNITY how will we'll ever realize what you are the position that YOU ARE THAT GOD HAS PLACED YOU SPIRITFILLED people you're sons of GOD WHY AN ANGEL'S A SERVANT YOU'RE A son an angel can only bring you a message &gt;&gt; but you have to act &gt;&gt; AMEN MAN, YOU'RE THE actor on the scene. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand what Paul said in the Corinthians that he called preaching foolishness? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And you're saved by foolishness. &gt;&gt; PREACHING. AND YET IT IS THE VERY HEART PURPOSE OF GOD MADE MANIFEST through the foolishness of preaching. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE WAY YOU'LL BE SAVED IS BY HEARING IT AND ACCEPTING IT. &gt;&gt; AND YET ANGELS OF GOD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT FOOLISHNESS. IF AN ANGEL OF GOD STOOD HERE, HIS FIRST SERMON, EVERY SERMON WOULD be perfect. I'VE BEEN PREACHING ALL THESE YEARS AND AIN'T NEVER preached a perfect one and never will. &gt;&gt; Amen. nor has or will any other preacher. &gt;&gt; Things that you know in your mind is wrong and you'll stand up and quote the scripture wrong and you don't even know you've done it. &gt;&gt; You imagine the devil saying, "Ah, your boy up there kind of foolishness. Don't you think God, well, it may be foolishness to give it to me. I call it great. I call it so awesome. Donnie ain't never preached a perfect sermon. Daryl ain't never preached one. NOW THE REST OF PREACHERS I'VE ever seen on the earth, BUT THEY BROUGHT MY CHILDREN OUT OF DARKNESS. THEY BROUGHT MY CHILDREN OUT OF SICKNESS BECAUSE I ORDAINED THAT AVENUE FOOLISHNESS OF PREACHING. [sighs] &gt;&gt; An angel can only bring you a message, but you have to act. Remember what I was preaching a few weeks ago about the theater that Paul said? We are the actors on the scene &gt;&gt; and you're the angels say this, say that. They say, "You can do it better than me. You do it." Oh, no. No. I'm forbidden to act. I cannot do it. This This the father's drama was written for children only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're the ACTOR ON THE SCENE. YOU'RE THE SON. THE ANGELS ARE servants to bring you THE MESSAGE SAID I BROUGHT THIS MESSAGE FOR YOU TO DO THAT AND SO THIS IS FROM FATHER I BRING IT TO YOU YES THERE THAT'S it amen your SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD PREDESTINATED us &gt;&gt; there is not an angel holy enough righteous enough pure enough I don't care if he's a cherubam a seraphim a zoo whatever he is that could ever scripturally be the pastor of this church or be an associate minister or even be a son or daughter of God. [sighs] &gt;&gt; GOD, WE WOULD PRAY TONIGHT that the angels of God would take their position now in the midst of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me close your short hand. live so that if God would want to use you, he knows right where to come and get you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're in a position, you're living a life clean before God. Your words are honest. &gt;&gt; Your life is true. Now listen, &gt;&gt; your words are honest. Your life is true. THAT'S THE KIND OF A PLACE that angels Amen. COME. LOOK AT ELIZABETH AND ZACHCHARIAS AND HONEST UPRIGHT WALKING IN ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD. THAT'S THE WAY WE WANT TO LIVE. SO WHEN GOD GETS READY TO USE US, HE SAY THIS IS MY PEOPLE. I CAN DO THIS WITH MY CHURCH WHAT I WANT TO. THEY BELIEVE ME. THEY stand on my word. See that's the way you want to live. live the life. &gt;&gt; Oh, and then when it comes time &gt;&gt; for that saint of God to leave this life, their soul needs ushering in to a realm where an undertaker cannot go. Their soul needs help crossing a sphere and into a dimension that the husband, the wife, mother, father, the pastor cannot go. So who does God use? Those beings who have the ability to move from mortality in the realm of time and take a hold of that soul and transport it across the river. &gt;&gt; Luke 16:22. And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels. Isn't it amazing? Angels in plural. Angels in plural. into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. But the difference between the rich man and the poor man was the angels wasn't present at his death. &gt;&gt; Doesn't say anything about the beggar being buried. So made you wonder if he was ever buried OR NOT. NO DOUBT THE RICH MAN WAS BURIED WITH GREAT ADO, but the angels of God never packed him to his regions of the lost. Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WHEN WE COME TO THIS, THERE'S not a single friend or parent or brother or sister that can make that transition. I've stood by the bedside of many of the saints here through the years and watch them take THEIR LAST BREATH. SOMETIMES I've been the last one to speak to them. And I tell them similar words to this. be waiting for me when you get across the river. I'll be following you shortly. The last two years, some of the ones that I've talked to, I've told them, "When you see my little girl, tell her we're coming. &gt;&gt; I LOVE THEM. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S GOOD. &gt;&gt; BUT I can't go with them. &gt;&gt; I can't cross." Oh, but I've sensed in that hospital room or in that nursing home or in their home other beings that were there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I could read Psalm 23 to them, might sing a song to them as they're getting ready to leave, but then the angels of God could say, "Excuse me, brother Donnie. We'll take them from here on." &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. This would be the most difficult time in their life. If they ever needed an angelic assistance, it would be moving from this mortal REALM TO THERE. YOU IMAGINE THEM SAME ANGELS THAT SPOKE TO THEM, KEEP ON BELIEVING, KEEP ON BELIEVING, AND SPOKE the word, DON'T LIVE THAT WAY, live this way, DO THIS, DO THAT. NOW, THE ANGELS COULD SAY, come on, today is the last day of your mortality. I've seen them lay there in them beds and them death rattles. I hate hearing that. I hate it. They can't hardly breathe. But right beyond what I can see, the angels of God are in the room. Heavenly pawbears. And they're not putting the the soul in a casket, but rather transferring the soul into a word form body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. MOSES WHEN HE DIED, THE PROPHET SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PAWBEARS HE HAD? ANGELS. WHY A man couldn't pack him where he was going? &gt;&gt; He had to have angels to pack him where he was going. Can you imagine friends? Oh my whenever death is coming up to us, my goodness, I I I think of the various ones. But whenever I went to see sister Naomi Daily and and she was in the hospital there and they said, "Well, brother Donnie, they told me I'm going to die today." They said, "I'm going to leave." I asked him, "Is there anything they can DO TO SPEED IT UP?" And I'm thinking, they're probably thinking, "Lord have mercy. This woman's out of her mind." I thought, "Yeah, out of her mind and fixing TO BE OUT OF HER BODY, FIXING TO BE OUT OF THIS OLD PEST HOUSE." SHE SAID, "I'M READY TO GO." AND THE LAST TIME I SEEN HER, SHE'S SMILING AND LAUGHING AND SAYING, "THIS IS THE DAY I'M GOING HOME." OH, HOW IN THE WORLD CAN A MAN OR WOMAN FACE MAN'S GREATEST ENEMY? IT'S GREATER THAN CANCER. IT'S GREATER THAN TV. OUR GREATEST ENEMY WOULD [applause] BE DEATH. BUT A REAL CHILD OF GOD LOOKS DEATH IN THE FACE AND SAY, "YOU CAN'T MAKE ME TREMBLE. YOU DON'T SCARE ME. YOU DON'T SCARE ME. I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE. YOU ARE [screaming] MINE. ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PACK ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY KING. &gt;&gt; OH, he had to have angels to pack him where he was going. Why? He had forsaken the glamour of the world. &gt;&gt; And he took the reproach of Christ. Brother Brown talking about his wife and his baby. Where did I get that baby? Who gave it to me? Not mine anyhow. He just lo to me &gt;&gt; for a while. He just loaned her to us for a while, girls. Us thanking him today. Us thanking him for loaning her to us. Maybe you think of your loved ones and those that departed that could have been born in that family and that family and that family and you never known them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But God loaned them to you. So remember that wife, that husband, your children, your grandchildren, they're on loan. &gt;&gt; And he will want them back one day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he may call them back before he calls you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So love them while you can. &gt;&gt; Love them while you've got them. He laundered to me for a while and I said, "Satan, get away from me." I went over and laid my hand on the baby and I said, "God bless you, sweetheart. In a minute, daddy will take you down and put you on mama's arms and the angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in the morning." I said, "Lord, you give her to me. You're taking her away. Though you slay me, like Job said, "Yet I love you and I believe you if you send me to hell, I will love you." &gt;&gt; Anyhow, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Let me close token and shport. God is displaying his token now and he'll ever be true to it. In the hour of your death, the angels of God will come and pack you not in death but from death. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand your body is what's dying, not you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It must be outright torment for demons out of hell when they come into the hospital room where saints is fixing to pass on and all this and they come. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them to do like they did MOSES AND THEY ARGUING. I WANT THE BODY OF MOSES AND ANGEL REBUKE YOU. YOU CAN'T HAVE ANYBODY. GET AWAY FROM HERE. And they come there just TO MAKE SURE. MAYBE THERE WASN'T A BELIEVER. MAYBE THERE'S A SECRET CENTER. MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THERE. AND THE ANGELS OF GOD HAVE TO MOVE BACK OR HERE COMES the angels of God right down and they reach down and take that soul out of that cancer stricken body or out of an automobile accident and grab that soul out of that body. Angels all around him and say come dear one &gt;&gt; come with us. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; in your dowy saints. It's healing, it's peace, it's sanctification. So many wonderful things of God. But angels are in your daring. Brother Don, what should I do? Maybe you should start praying the way your prophet prayed. &gt;&gt; Lord, let the angels of God be in church tonight. &gt;&gt; It's only Wednesday, Jesus. Does that matter to you? Well, I made Wednesday, too, Donnie. I'm God on Wednesdays like I am on Sunday. &gt;&gt; The angels of God are with you on Wednesday. If your expectation is low, don't blame them. They're right there to have the dew drops. and they're here tonight to distill split their wings and distill healing, distill peace, &gt;&gt; distill salvation. Or maybe you just need a charge going through you like a battery. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Thank my precious friends what our father has done for us. You mothers and fathers remember there's been stage in your children's life if you send them to public school or if you took them to you bring them to Bible school whatever it is and you have to drop them off and you know you take them to Sunday school and you've got to leave them there and you're leaving them with their teacher and the first time they've ever been oh my goodness you know you there's things you have to do and oh you want to make sure that they're taken care of &gt;&gt; and our father wanted to make sure we were taken care of I'm going to live in them I'm going cleanse them. I'm going to send a ministry. I'm going to send them a prophet. I'm going to send them all these things. But I know they're going to face such things. &gt;&gt; I'm going to assign each one of them an angel. And when the record of this life is over and they all come before me and I flash back their life on a screen and I'll show them what was invisible and I'll show them. They should have died in that car wreck. They was heading out on vacation, &gt;&gt; but they got in the car to leave and the kid said, "I need to go to the bathroom or spill Kool-Aid." &gt;&gt; And dad got mad in a hornet. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. I TOLD YOU NOT TO BRING THAT RED KOOL-AID in this car. What in the world are you doing? Little did they know, the angel of the Lord was protecting them from a head-on collision. &gt;&gt; Amen. They come to church time after time and they're struggling. They're struggling. They got there, they barely barely made it to church in time and they didn't even been able to eat and they just ate something real fast coming to church. I walked the parking lot out here sometimes and I've passed by here on Wednesday night, seen saints sitting in their vehicle eating pizza, eating sandwiches cuz they come straight from work to come to church. Hallelujah. Why? They want to be where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you think about this place. To me, this is a sacred place, sir. &gt;&gt; I said this is a sacred place. This is a sacred desk. And just in case you're wondering, Brother Brandham never said that only at his church. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the first place that he ever mentioned, it wasn't even in his own tabernacle. This is a sacred place. Hallowed set aside. Praise God. Let's bury our heads if you would. How many wants God to help you that you'll be more conscious and be more aware of of these things that we've talked about tonight? You all, by the grace of God, going to approach it in a different way. Are you going to start praying, Lord? Let the angels of the Lord. I don't I don't know how y'all do before I get ready to go out somewhere. I always pray first. May the angels of God go with us. Oh, I'm a good driver. I don't care how good a driver you are. And I ain't worried about me. I'm worried about them other people out there. &gt;&gt; My good and driving may not keep me out of a wreck, but an angel of God can. And I'm going to ask &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope that we come back here Sunday and from this point on to the rapture asking God, Lord, let your angels, let your angels be in the service. May they distill healing. Oh, glory to God. Do you understand, friends? Right here in this church, the dead have been raised in this church. Women which could not conceive have conceived and the doctors told them they never would. There's children here tonight that their parents are told they can never have them. How many great things have happened here among us? Yes, it is a sacred place, a holy place. Father, I before I ask you for anything in the line of illumination and help, I want to say I'm sorry. I apologize for myself and I apologize for these people that we have not recognized. Not only your presence at times, but the angels of God. How many times have you spoke, Lord, and let the angel of the Lord say something and I just thought it's me or my mind? When the angels have been around us to energize our faith, they've whispered, "Believe. Believe. Trust. Wait." We can know it'll be an angel of the Lord because it'll never believe the word. Never. Not one time. Oh Jesus. Help us as Christians, Father, that we can make up in our minds. If our home is not the type of home that angels can feel welcome in, if there's anything in our home that would defile it, anything, Lord, in our behavior, our actions that would prevent angels of God from coming around us, may we take care of it, Lord. For those of us, Father, that believe that all things are clean between us and you, we're asking, dear God, make us more mindful. &gt;&gt; Make us more mindful. Lord, I realize some people get scared when you go to talk in this way, but I don't believe that you intend to terrify us, but only in the capacity that we're ordained to see them is what we're praying for tonight. Lord God, we ask you. May we recognize when we come to the house of God. This is a sacred place, a holy place sanctified by your presence, Lord God. The angels of God are here waving their white flags. Demons are here waving their black ones. But I'm going to go ahead and tell them they might as well roll up theirs and walk back down to hell &gt;&gt; because they ain't claiming the victory in this place tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We worship you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Would you lay your hand over on the person standing by you tonight now? Glory to God. Hallelujah. Brother Daryl, would you care to come up buddy and pray over the needs request of the people? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, [snorts] &gt;&gt; we are so grateful in our hearts, Lord, &gt;&gt; for your word that you have illuminated to us tonight. Lord, we are so grateful, dear God. We have come to this sacred place, Lord, to open our hearts, Lord, to receive of your word that we could become more light, Lord, to this dark age. We pray. And Lord, you see the heart of every person in this building tonight. And I ask you, Lord Jesus, may your spirit, Lord, be felt upon every heart, Lord, and touch every life, Lord, as we lay hands upon one another. May the Holy Spirit, Lord, that anointing that raised my Lord, from the grave, may it move, oh God, about every heart and about every life, dear God, that our sick, dear God, would be healed. That our weak would be made strong, Lord. that those that would struggle, God, would find strength to stand in this hour, dear God. For Lord, though the world may be sinking around us, we are rising, dear God, to our rightful positions as sons and daughters of God, Lord, to be an example to this dying generation that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord. And God, I pray, Father, that each person here tonight would receive that which they have need of, dear God. May you move upon every home, Lord, upon every heart, upon every life, upon those dear God, that are streaming and around the world, God, who are gathering, Lord, to hear of your word tonight. I pray, oh Lord. God, we know that times and situations and and landmarks, Lord, and geographical situations does not hinder you from moving above the needs of your people, oh God, tonight. And we call you on the scene, Lord Jesus. Oh God, may the angels tonight, Lord. May they wave the white flags of victory and may the black flags be drugged out in DEFEAT TONIGHT, LORD. BECAUSE THE SONS and daughters of God have exercised their God-given rights, oh Lord, to lay hands upon one another for it is written IN THY WORD. THEY SHALL lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. And we believe that tonight, oh God. We believe that tonight, Lord. And we thank you, Lord Jesus. forever time. Lord, your hand has touched us, Lord. At a red light when it's turned, Lord, and we should have left, but you held us back, God, and it was you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Your prophet said, "One day you'll know it was the hand of Jesus holding you back, keeping you from that accident, Lord. How we thank you for it, God. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; From the times you have watched over us and protected us, Lord, that we weren't even aware of it. But tonight, we thank you from the depths of our heart. &gt;&gt; And you've brought us home every time. [laughter] You've brought us home every time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God, you'll bring us &gt;&gt; to our our heavenly home. &gt;&gt; Oh, we bless. &gt;&gt; Oh, and to thee, Lord. Let us labor. I pray. Touch your children, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for hearing our prayer. Yay. Lord, I thank you that thou always hear us when we pray. &gt;&gt; How we love you, Lord. How we bless your holy name tonight, oh God. How we thank you, Lord, that we got an angel with us, Lord. Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus, tonight. Bless brother Donnie, Lord, renew his strength, Father. Thank you, dear God. Lord, as we've we watched him, Lord, study this week, God, and these quotes, Lord, how we thank you, Lord, how he's put them together and fed us, oh God, a seven course meal tonight. Thank you for our brother, Lord. Strengthen him, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Father. We pray, oh God, may we labor until that day that we lay our weapons down, Lord. May we labor to that day God we pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus name we ask these things. Amen and amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
