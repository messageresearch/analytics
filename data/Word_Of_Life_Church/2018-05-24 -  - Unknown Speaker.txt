I said I'm clean I'm too horse to sing and brother Marley when I went back he said I thought she was a horse I said well he came through the Lord came through a man it's one great wonderful thing about Jesus he's always faithful starting the first John chapter 5 if you would tonight first John chapter 5 verse 1 I want to speak to you tonight on the devil's picnic well you say I don't want to be in his picnic oh but you don't understand yet you don't understand you're the reason he's having it but after tonight I hope that we tear up his picnic first John chapter five verse one whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and every one that loveth him that beget loveth him also that is begotten of him but this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments people who say they love him and don't want to keep his word well there's one simple answer for that they are liars whether that's Mayor you deacons preachers trustees you know whoever Pope priests don't matter this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments now listen I love this part and His commandments are not Grievous the way of a transgressor is hard not the way of a real believer now let me say something you think I'm strange anyway but if there was no heaven or no hail I would not change one thing about the way I live I would want to be a Christian a child of God if there was no promise of a tomorrow there was no future home there was no castles no palaces no mansions I'm not serving him for that myself well you say I would not do this that another see it shows you're not right was gone because if you loved him you'd serve Him and live for him if at the end of the way he cast you away well this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous and just in case you're wondering that's not the initial ten for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now listen to this in a message called turning northward in 1961 let's love one another don't fight one another as long as the devil's got you fighting one another he don't have to fight at all he will set back and has a picnic while only message folks have gave him a lot of opportunities for picnics he will set back and has a picnic now listen what his entertainment is now he sets back he has a picnic drinks whatever Devils drink and eats whatever Devils eat their picnics but his form of entertainment at the picnic is us he don't have to fight at all he will sit back and has a picnic watching you fighting one another what better entertainment could Satan have than children of God fightin each other there's nothing he loves any better nothing any more fun nothing any more entertaining that's pitiful I've give him a few chances for picnics don't sit down look at me like you know what I'm talking about you have to listen to this now he will set back and has a picnic watching you fighting one another and the life that's you professing to have the Holy Ghost and fighting one another oh I'm mad already I'll tell you what I found that this week I just got pong mad I wouldn't mad at you when necessary mad at me I got mad at the devil never got mad at me and I got mad at you think of the children we could dismiss and go home and say wow but let's not I think we might want to stay around for a bit he don't have to fight at all he will sit back and has a picnic watching you fight one another and life it's you professing to have the Holy Ghost and fighting one another why would he laugh at that cuz he knows it's totally impossible for you to have the real Holy Ghost and constantly fighting let's pray together Lord Jesus we thank you to not father for the reading of your word we're so grateful Lord Jesus that you came to this world to care for us to love us to be able to help us Lord God I pray that you would speak to our hearts tonight help me that I can get out of the way and help the people that they can be able to get out of the way as well to hear Lord Jesus we certainly needs you with all of our hearts take the word tonight anoint us I pray that we can be able to receive father in Jesus name Amen god bless you may be seated Hemis ever been on a picnic a picnic can take place in different places sometimes folks go to the mountains sometimes they go down to the lake or they go to a beautiful serene spot that they think is so pretty and so calm maybe a lake could be a Creek River rushing water or from over steel-type person just the trickling of a fall but yet it is there for you to be able to relax and enjoy those that are with you the food that you have brought the drink that you've brought to be able to pull off the job a little bit get away from the worries and troubles of life most of us think of a picnic as something enjoyable pleasant it's not something that myself that I would think about the devil ever having a picnic and you realize it's a metaphorical saying it is a pair of parable that it is a earthly saying with a heavenly meaning so when you think about the devil ever wanting to have a picnic a gathering to where he can be able to rest as it was to be able to have a form of entertainment to get him from the every Dre's everyday stress of life of being the biggest liar that ever left the one has caused the most trouble of all that's ever lived down through time so every now and then he wants a little relaxing time to have a picnic so he chooses the most ideal setting Satan don't go to a bar for a picnic he doesn't go to a strip club for a picnic he doesn't go to any world he sings and all that sort of thing but he loves Church and he loves the homes of Christians and the workplace of Christians so Satan chooses for his favorite spots for the ideal place for a picnic around children of God now you think why in the world what do you want that kind of a setting because to get them upset to get them fussing arguing debating hating that gives him more laughs than anything in this world Oh Satan thinks it's funny when people they'll talk him into drinking and then he'll give him cirrhosis of the liver he thinks it's absolutely marvelous he'll talk people into smoking when they're 12 13 years old they become addicted and then he kills him with cancer they take their first lick of dope marijuana whatever it is I thinks it's hilarious that they become so bound by that they would sell their body they would sell their mother in order to get a fix he thinks that's wonderful but there is nothing that gives him the joy like children of God fighting it's just something beyond explanation to the devil it brings him such a static joy and pleasure he just laughs and lives and all if you could just see him double over and just holding as sad as it were when the children of God had claimed to be born again and have the Holy Ghost become bitter and hateful and contrary and hate one another ah so in Satan can find that in the life of a Christian or he can find it in a church or it can find it in a move a move of God here Satan decides to have a picnic now some picnics of course are held at parks that picnic tables are provided for you till where you go then you and your family decide well let's pick this table over here Oh Matt's a nice setting if you're a shade person or sudden person and then you'll pick out whichever one you want some of them have a little small grill then you brought your little hamburgers and your hot dogs or your Bologna or whatever you're gonna do and you'll sit there and you spread out a tablecloth on this concrete table or wood table and you'll take your nice favorite colored tablecloth your little red white checkered one or your blue and white checkered one and you lay it all out and my other wife drags out everything out of the basket and you go to lay everything with your plastic forks and your plastic knives item things don't you and you go to cut in your first cucumber and snap it breaks off but you say ah this is a picnic it don't matter nah I'm all for working and we left the kids with mother-in-law and all they let's have a great time the Flies are flying in your face people over here screaming kids over there run and you said this is so wonderful we're having a great time it's a picnic you have no thermostat to control the temperature you'll sit there and sweat if you've done that in church you'd be as mad as a Hornet but yet it's a picnic so we tolerate things but can you imagine Satan now he wants to have a picnic so he packs his lunch and here he comes and he says now where can I have my picnic today would it be the Weber's home will it be the Williams home what about the Philips home that might be a good place the walkers the Reagan's the Babs I'm gonna get on sharing a little bit to say hello something a little quicker harsh to Linda that's a perfect picnic setting I'll spread out my little blue and white cause you know light red the color blood I'll spread out my little blue and white tablecloth and I'll sit down and Jim will say some and then Lindo say something and then they'll start back and forth and I'll anoint boss I'm concerned no way they're gonna be beat she'll not let him get the last word iam and he'll death and not get her last word and I'll sit there and I'll just see my devil sandwiches of course he likes deviled eggs I suppose he'll sit I need his sandwiches and Greg one of the devil drinks and he'll just anoint them back and forth back and forth back a moral and he is dying laughing and this is so wonderful because they're both Christians and they both got the Holy Ghost and their boats are born again and they were from the greatest message that's ever been on the earth and they got piece of passeth understanding joy unspeakable full of glory but they're behaving like children the devil's picnic Satan loves Klamath he loves destruction he loves anxiety sorrow bitterness hatefulness contrariness he does not love divine love Satan King love he does not enjoy peace now if you would allow Satan to be able to lay out all of his beautiful condiments in order to have a wonderful picnic at your place and all of a sudden in the middle of this argument you realize wait a minute you know what we done we just invited the devil to have a picnic in our house what if in the middle of your argument with your brother or your sister or your wife or whatever it is you realize what you have just done you have just created a perfect atmosphere for the devil's picnic and if in the middle of that you realize Lord God forgive us forgive us and you grab your wife by the hand and kneel down right down on the couch all right there in the chair summer and you go to pray it and you pray and pray until you break through and the son and the strange language I guarantee you one thing if you could hear the devil's getting his little ditty bag together he's bunching all his stuff up in his basket and he's leaving the báb house and he's going to find out if there's anybody else at Happy Valley that he can have a picnic in their house but of course our rights are so important to us no one is going to cross us and get by I would imagine for a lot of the Saints in Happy Valley Satan has a hard time working in all the picnics among all the opportunities I'm not sure if the devil can have picnic on Facebook but if he can I'm sure that he's up 24/7 just keeping their Facebook picnics all of course in the love of God now what's whenever the new burst comes into an individual it changes them and makes him so different than the word they were before they were born again and John by the Spirit of God had such an understanding in looking at this Watson now chapter 5 verse 1 he said whosoever believe us that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loved us him that began levels him also that is begotten of him now yet to be very careful in looking at this word because especially in the modern concept of the way that people are taking the word believe or believing or believe us and they look at it as merely an intellectual conception or believing that God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son then by believing that mentally they accept it that way but when you look at the root word of believers and of faith it is pista sin the Greek which is not only a noun or something that you accept on the basis of substance but it actually is connected with a verb which places it in action so it's not just what you say you believe but it's the way you live you live out what you say you are believing now watch he says whosoever believe us that Jesus is the Christ is born of God so what is Christ it is Christos it is not enough to believe merely that Jesus is the Son of God that's important but notice what John said he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ he didn't say that believes that Jesus is the Son of God but Jesus is the Christ what does that involve Jesus was a prophet he was the son of God but he's also our King now in the concept of Christ which is crystals or messiahs it is all the anointed perspective of the office of the Lord Jesus so sons and seonhwa I said Jesus as the Son of God but do you accept him as your priest do you accept him as your king do you accept them as your all-in-all and then if you do not you are truly not born again yet but he whosoever believeth that Jesus is not was but it is the cross he is your Christ so it's not only your Savior but he is currently your priest he is also your Lord he is your master he is your king now those are the ones that are truly born again their will that they will be outnumbered a million to one as far as those that believe in the mind intellectually that Jesus is the Son of God yet they do not make him King they do not make him Lord they do not make him the Anointed Prince over their life they simply what is most of the world's the church was confession I believe Jesus is the Son of God he is the son of God that's important but that's not what all John said you must believe Jesus is the Christ I want him to be my Savior but I want him to be my Lord I want him to be my king I want him to be my ruler you as well know us whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God now the term born of God is kind of it's isolated actually by john the divine and he only uses that in the latter years of his ministry doesn't use it when he writes a epistle of john but he uses that after now he's been on the Isle of Patmos and has these great visions and visitations from God if you notice in first John 3:9 he said whosoever is born of God now Peter doesn't use these terms Paul doesn't use these terms John alone uses his term born of God whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God and the church said first John 4:7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God chapter five verse one again whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God so that means that everybody that believes Jesus is the Son of God they're born again careful careful once again verse verse for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world oh so you can't just profess I believe Jesus is the Son of God if you're born of God you will overcome the world not maybe not perhaps I'm trying no it's not I'm trying you will verse 18 we know that whosoever is born of God sent us not but he that is begotten of God keeps us himself how in the world is that possible he keeps himself how by the power of God in him and that wicked one touches him not now watch this word believe it back to chapter five verse one whosoever believe us that Jesus is the Christ is born of God look at the word it is pissed you commit to ones trust notice nothing about your intellectual conception at all it's not about what you accept it's not about the intellectual part I said that in my mind I confess it with my mouth and therefore it's done that's not even the word John used look at the word whosoever believe us commit to one's trust be committed unto - think to be true use in the New Testament of the conviction and Trust to what a man is felled by a certain inner and higher prerogative and law of soul to entrust our saying to his fidelity to be entrusted with a say-so whosoever believe us it's not your intellectual conception oh I accept them as my savior you've known him on first base yet whosoever believes you believe in so much you commit everything your trust your fidelity everything you are that's a real believer praise the Lord Jesus now it is not even the proper meaning of the word which by which many theologians and preachers and teachers now Scout to the place it's in the message as well because it's an easy believe ISM to our person just believes and they accept and they believe it doesn't require anything it requires a no walk it requires no consecration to God because God knows nobody's perfect anyway and while I'll make mistakes we all do wrong that's a good modern gospel but it's not the Bible so the core meaning men of the root of this word is actually as a totus pissis in the Greek it is a personal relationship established my trust and trustworthiness it's not just trust alone but trust and trustworthiness so it's not believing in an historical Jesus that should pick up the Bible and you learn all the stories and Jesus He healed the sick and raise the dead he's done all these wonderful things Alma I believe that's true I believe that's true but it's never been made real to you faith in Him is abandoning our own will our own ideas our own abilities and trusting totally in him which is so hard for us to death now watch Peter believed but he didn't have a new birth Matthew chapter 16 verse 15 and he says unto them but whom say ye that I am and he says unto them whom say the disciples that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ now what John says whosoever believe us that Jesus is the Christ is born of God Peter seemingly matches that verse of scripture and he does from here but not here now what's Simon Peter answered and said thou the Christ the Son of the Living God jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven he had a real revelation but he wasn't born again he believed Jesus was a cross but he turned out to be a cussing preacher and naked on top of that but yet he believed he had a revelation praise the Lord what's this in the Greek text the word believe is present tense I love this indicating a present continuing activity the word born is in the perfect tense the perfect tense indicates a past event was continuing consequences the God thank you Lord Jesus now to us as English people even you know we would make that much difference at all but whenever you realize the way the scripture was written and the Spirit of God moving on those men to use the proper word then we bring it over into our thinking and we totally reshape it by our thinking and then we wonder why the word don't work it does work but it's placed in this proper place now what's the perfect tense of the word born in indicates a past event was continuing consequences in other words our present continuing activity of believing is the results and therefore the evidence of our past experience of new births by which we become and remain God's children this is why real believer will never stumble at any truth this reveals now that they struggle in this way when they share - oh my oh my I don't understand it all now but a real seat of God will keep him right on going why they are born of God other people will come up to a certain doctor in a certain trend and they'll go that far and they'll never make it over the top of that why they lack a new verse the Holy Ghost will never stop at anything that's revealed in his word he came he wrote it so to be born of God what is it the perfect test it is something that is ongoing in our lives even this knife if you've got a new verse and you're sitting in this place and you're born of God when the word brings something to you it will quicken that to you lighten in this very surface know what's in whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and when a burst takes place the individual that is born is not born into a world of isolation they are not born into a place of total solitude - were there the only one that has ever been born now think of this when you weren't born you might have been the first morning I was in my family but yet I was not born into a world of solitude that was already been millions and millions of human beings that had lived on the earth and that had come by the same way that I had come by birth so it did not burst me into a room or a sphere where I was the only one there I was born into the family of the Reagan's I was born into the family of humanity well I wonder how that works with an uber said when we're born again into the family of God and yet we want to get this concept assess in our for and no more on our church and the one who gets our revelations are the one who streams our services OMA for one thing when you're born into this family there are shared traits and characteristics that mark you this being a Reagan or whatever you are now whenever you come in into this family you're a born out after the law of God's natural of reproduction but you're not the first one there more than likely you won't be the last one there so you are born into something that already pre existed before you came and no doubt it will be there would you leave this mortal realm now when we look at the burst of the air of the seed into the family of God we were certainly not the first ones to be born into the family and if the Lord tarries will not be the last ones that will be born and with that comes what a responsibility that we are born into a move of God so what gets among us in that wants us to isolate ourselves from everybody else in that same move we have no fellowship with no other church we have no confidence and nobody else but one preacher you're on dangerous ground if Satan can get you down to one preacher all he's got to do is come between you and that one preacher and you're finished Oh Lord Jesus and another thing that whenever you're born into the human family you have traits and characteristics of those who are your paternal parents now you may have certain things about you go suck your father certain things about they don't like her mother it could even be an uncle maybe you had a redheaded uncle my my years and years back your mama's black head and your daddy's brown headed all of a sudden you come out of there look around her an Irishman or something nothing lower than mercy what in the world is that what it was a gene of someone that came down and there you are the refraction of someone behind you so you know we bear the characteristics and the traits of that but we so struggle then with the spiritual sense of being morning the family of God we want everybody to be identical to us the music's gotta be like ours they're singers like ours they've definitely got to preach like Donnie regular let's hurry on the move of God friends you realize that's the spirit of organization we're born into a family some of our brothers and sisters in this family are Africans some are Filipinos summer Asians some are American Indians some are all kinds of folks they're never all going to be exactly like us thank God that worship will be different the manner and style of preaching will be different I think it's a sign of growing up that we can finally recognize God moves beyond our four walls I hate to say it but preachers are a lot of the ones that are guilty for giving the devil a lot of grounds for picnics well praise the Lord there ain't any preachers your all of them say man it ain't like you're outnumbered I mean y'all fifty to one the preachers so that's an answer so whenever a person is born then into the economy of God they're born under what attribute they are born we know not you when we're born Sates you know the 1956 when I was born there was a certain planetary alignment also stars and it set my birth paths in a certain certain way it set my nature in a certain way it would affect me all of my life even though I tried to be born again and have a new nature and then the c-team would be quicker on the Spirit of God but there would be certain things I hear I'm born in a certain time Carol born exactly the same date map up in the day but yet something a little different made her a different personality and it's the same way with the family of God that we could be born into the family of God some will be really emotional my they've had search a faint not to fuse them others that they can't stand that said that's so most noisy their favorite scriptures be still and know that I'm God I'm the oldest of seven kids named none of us identical we first we fought we clawed one another's eyes out we call one other names we made fun of one another we we attached all kinds of nicknames to each other which some of them still carry to this day and you now kids can be they can be very cruel children can be very cool come on now it shows you although the message folks really are still their children no matter how long they've been around they're still children what's their behavior they act like spoiled children they don't get their way they throw that for spinning us know it's bad if it's a lay person it's worse if it's a deacon it's horrible if it's a pastor now all of us no matter what position if spiritually we're still affected by this and even though we're born into the economy of God he does not strip the genes out of us naturally he does not shut the burst path out of us naturally we're left in this body to still deal with all these negative aspects but every child of God has spiritual birth marks y'all know what birth marks are don't see every child of God has birth marks what marks it was phoned on you and your mother was carrying it was one of my siblings has a mark on their body but a certain event happened to my mother and it marked their body but we have other marks it brings our first subject but the last verse mark of a child of God will be the body change how much earlier into this is Johnson riding this in chapter 2 and chapter 3 as it begins to emphasize on the love of God in chapter 4 he shows us that the characteristics of a child of God are being born into this economy of God and they will certainly walk in truth they will certainly dress a certain way and they'll certainly have lots of things about them that will be markers as far as the Christian but one of the greatest things that John is emphasizing here is love now I know this is a very confusing a lot of folks and folks of life to this series that I've been preaching at and making fun of it some of the message folks have because I don't think it's very deep they think that I'm talking about what everybody out here is as far as what I'm talking about divine love I'm not talking about this Oh a gooey marshmallow creamy stuff that Smathers all over everybody's face I'm talking about divine love that separates you from the world but makes you hate sin but love the sinner that's right now what John wants to bring this out and show that the love of God becomes the fixed point about which it is your North Pole as it was it is a pivotal point of your life by which you will start being navigated and controlled from that point on now we know that God wants to place something there within us that'll change this forever so it's wonderful part about it is that it'll change this forever so to be born of God is to be born into the family of God and we have the name of the father of the family over this household though it is a mystical body yet were born into it individually but yet we're born into it in the sense of what we're all members of the same body so how could I find bored of the Spirit of God and you're born the Spirit of God ever hates you or how could you ever hate me when the same father began us both [Applause] and you want to ask me if all my brothers and sisters got along together I don't told you we did y'all have any brothers and sisters Oh y'all have perfect Club and your family liar liar liar but yet you let somebody pick on one of their brothers and sisters my my my sister Tammy I'll still bear scars in my face where she called me and scratched me but somebody picked on me one day and a bus because I never could fight I always hated fighting and somebody picked on me on one day on the bus and I just hit my head and that guy was beating me on the head and pounded me like a drum cuz I just never could fight I know y'all don't believe that it's a truth I just never I couldn't stand fighting Tammy lit into him told him in the bug bites he was begging for mercy time she got up and a couple of days she leaned into me the same way and that amazing how whenever you see your brother that would be under something you go to his defense and yet you can be the very one also who would do the very same thing to him it's amazing and it's what our perception of love and loyalty know that is but when you think now that we look beyond the natural genealogy and we look and see that John said whosoever loveth him that begat levels him also that is begotten so every Christian every true born-again Christian you love those who are born of the Spirit of God have you said well how am I gonna know how am I gonna know oh so you got such a little love then you get a predetermine if they're born again for you or not you need another baptism I said you need another baptism God so loved the world the cows mops the world Lord that gave me something begun sir he loves the sinners he loves the homosexuals he don't love what they do he loves harlots prostitutes drugs drug addicts now can you imagine a son here that's born in a family he's got brown hair blue eyes whatever structures one size and his brother blonde hair green eyes smaller thin well then the bigger one would use himself that these people do that use himself as example and say don't look like me I don't believe you're a born of daddy and Mama you must be adopted one of my sisters we used to kid her that way when she's little we used to tell her all the time she was adopted poor little thing she'd cry and cry and cry why she didn't want to feel like she's the doctor is there anybody here wants to feel like you're not a member of the family of God he said anybody who wants to fill out that you're not one of those beloved ones or the Lord that would break your heart and mine too Wow we want to feel that we're special in his eyes and you are but you look at the love of God then being born into the family for not careful we will fuss and fight and rip and tear and hate and we are sending the devil Satan you want a picnic I'm fixing the rider brother in the church a scathing email now I'm gonna burn his heart I'm gonna do this my monitor that's a wait a minute wait a minute let me get my hot dogs yeah yeah let me get my kool-aid let me get my mustard my ketchup my salt my pepper my potato chill I wanna have a picnic cuz I know him if you post that on Facebook this morning he'll post this this evening and I want to get right in the middle of you so I can enjoy this while both of you claim you're born again and both of you got the Holy Ghost and you're so illuminated and I'm gonna dial heaven please don't send in there till I get my dog buns whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God every one that love us him that beget with us him also that is begotten of him why they're in the same family got the same image brother Donnie but what if some woman come in here to happen with look Bob his head on pants daddy no image of God certainly not yet what if she's a real daughter of God her name is on the book and you treat her like a you see we're looking at the cover many times on the covers no honey I'll say what let's do let's catch the fish and we'll let God clean them none of us message folks want to claim them for the catch them I don't know how that works in fishing I don't figure weren't you good though praise the Lord we want to clean them up wash your face up with a dress something that look God can save a woman in a past skin tight shorts God could save a man a big old burly looking outfit with earrings hanging down his nose out of his ears out of his eyeballs everywhere else God could save that man and then clean him out that for man want some he say man who hates his brother does not love God [Music] my is Clyde on me listen what brother Ben says about loving one another the love of God sealed in your heart pressed in until all the world is pressed out and you see nothing but the Lord to love him and as you love one another you love the Lord and if you don't love one another you can't love the Lord Vince theater said this is not an option it's impossible if we don't love one another we cannot love the Lord right what's this again assess you'll never come up in the kingdom of God until the Holy Spirit is sealed you in the kingdom of God by divine love the whole Christian world is your brother and sister that's right the world sealed out in God sealed in when you love one another truly with divine Christian love then you know the Holy Spirit is really working through you then now when you speak in tongues not when you say you accept the prophet not when you say you believe the message when divine love is working through you praise God thank you Lord Jesus love one another above everything that you do love one another you love one another you'll love God see you love each other and you'll love God for god is love and a man that walks in love walks in life and perfect love casteth out all fear this is the kind of environment - Satan hates in a family this is the kind of environment that Satan hates in a church it's the kind of environment that he hates in a move of God it's a kind of environment he hates in an individual but if the church that family that individuals got bitterness and hatred and envy and strife you have set up a permanent picnic table a lot of us are such professionals have thrown a picnic for the devil we provide the meat the bread the drinks the french fries even the dessert we've got everything everything conducive for Satan's picnic kept us all floored kept us off I want you to notice this brother BAM follow this thought there's hundreds and hundreds of these quotes but I'll read you just a few but he follows the same thought all through the entirety of the message from the very beginning all the way to the very end what is fatherhood it's an attribute of God then if we be God's children then God wants us to love one another in doing so we love God teach you see you cannot divide loving God and loving the brothers now you can generally disagree that don't mean you agree with everybody but the thing of it is you can bitterly disagree and love them just as much when you get done which most human beings cannot I've had disagreements with preachers all over the world the message and with many of them when you do they'll never treat you the same again I don't care how great a man can preach there's something lacking in his life don't get scared preachers have got to line up to the words if a preacher cannot disagree that the preacher and still feel the same in his heart there's something wrong with that perjure that Deacon that matter that father you mean whoever it is the word of God declares friends we must love him and we must love his image in others mmm notices brother em says if you can't love one another how you gonna love God who you haven't seen love hides a multitude of sin get in love with God then you'll love one another all my then you love the church you love the coals okay sir I love God I love the Prophet I love the Nishizawa not the church you don't love God you're deceived you cannot be in love with God and in love with the Prophet in the message and not love the move of God and love to go to church of God's in your heart you can't wait to come praise the Lord and that in eastern Christmas I said I need on Easter and Christmas you can't wait to get to the house of God mine's got a trip you got this you're watching you watch all my 5:07 brother Lewis Center for reading the prayer requests and figuring out the special song it's about ten extra seven one once they're doing that wonder what they're doing that a real child of God never gets away from church cause a entire wise part of their life Isis your home and reflection down your what are we doing we're gathering here tonight there's an an attire of our future homeland we will gather around that reveal life for eternity and we love one another because I love him [Applause] notice it's love hides a multitude of sin get in love with God then you love one another you'll love the church you'll love the calls you'll love everything that's God in you keep away from the things of the world notice this as we go on how to unfold right on down through this he said if you get your place well I couldn't put my arm around any brother that's working for the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I feel I'm back slid I'd be scared to stand on the platform and face evil spirits to know that I had Envy in my heart against any brother in the Saints then can you imagine what a picnic grand aperture can be a preacher who has more chances for complexes than he the other person on the earth you folks can interrupt his meals you can interrupt these plans you can interrupt everything about him and he's to drop whatever he's doing at your beck and call and if he don't he's that dab off and you spend years of your life giving it to those people and then all of a sudden they decide they don't like you no more so they take to a post hole diggers and they dig up their posts and then they set it down to another post to duty and then they're gonna running you down I'm talking about you you saying my goodness all the years all the meals I missed all the night sleep I lost for them people and what happened all that if you don't keep abreast of it and if you don't keep above it all it goes to building and building and building on a picture and you lose a little more feeling and a little more and a little more and he'll start taking his harshness and his bitterness and finding scriptures to justify it God hates bitterness whether it's in a preacher or a singer you know men are different - it is and bitterness will grieve the spirit of God away from any man I don't care how good he can preach how good it can sing don't get quiet on my church I don't want that myself I want to be sweet full of the Holy Ghost don't you I think with that then a person can have this bitterness in them I we've got we've got so many opportunity to become bitter why would I want to remain bitter when there's so much of the love of God I've never even tasted of yet why would I want to become better now ability why would I want to become so complex and full of so many hurts have you been hurt brother don't you oh yes I've been hurt by them you know thousands and thousands of time but so of you let's go we can spend all of our time wallowing in our hurting our disappointment or we can say praise God there's a higher calling there's the City of God there's the kingdom of God let's move on that's not Waddell in our Hertz notices brother brems said to know that I had India in my heart again senior brother no matter who he is he's trying to preach the gospel or Jesus Christ or live a Christian life if we disagree on million mouths upon theology if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother and it's my sister and we've drawled those lines and if you can't love your brother who you have seen how can you love God who you can't or have never seen and brother when love goes out God goes with it [Applause] if we run the love of God out of this place all we'll have is a building with carpet and nice songs and nice musicians and nice singers but if God leaves I'm leaving with him I don't just want science I don't just want wonders and miracles I love divine love y'all want to stay with me notice this we must love one another keep the roots of bitterness out of us then God can go to working through us but till we get that we're just fighting the wind and of course this is another one of Satan's entertainments at his picnic he loves to watch us fight the wind now the wind is something which is very real it's something that we've all felt on our face on our back all around us all of our lives it's invisible comes when it wants ghosts when it once we don't know where it lists to 3-mile where it come from where it goes to so can you imagine I'm picking a fight with the wind come on come on face me like a man you're really bored aren't you can you imagine picking a fight whistle and and Satan just holes inside that mustard I had so much fun since Peter cast this is great in town message Malakoff for deepest people on the earth [Music] but I come loaded tonight for the picnic brigade anybody wants to help me go through this picnic and turn there hey man I wouldn't come to your picnic and turn there cuz it wouldn't be nice I wouldn't go to a park Rotary Park or evermore and tear up a picnic but I think I'm perfectly justified in turning up the devil's picnic in my life or in my family or in a challenge so our God can so fill us with love that Satan said all Lord get out of here they broke into the realm of perfect love I never thought they'd do it I never thought they'd ever found the way all the devil let me tell you God's got a people on the earth around the world that will be filled with God's divine love they will preach deep things they will heal the sick but they will be so much like God that the world will know there is still a Living God praise the Lord Lord Jesus notice his mother man said we must love one another and keep the roots of bitterness out of us then God can work through us until we get that we're just fighting the wind true we got a love one another jesus said by all this will men know you're my disciples right or wrong how much of your short life do you think God would love you if he left you on the basis of when you were right there's probably things tonight that we believe that's wrong we just don't know it yet we'll find it out tomorrow Wednesday or something like that you mean God loves you when you're wrong believing this or that or the other but he's God but you're supposed to be born of God I know I know I know I'm a simple simple simple person but dogs beget dogs get to get cats horse beget horse so what does God to get praise the Lord conduct a kind don't forget dogs can't baguettes guess God baguettes gods oh my notice turning north sort of game look laughs one another jesus said this woman all men know you're about disciples and you got love one another this is when all men will know that you're my disciples you got love one another that's the greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost that I know of when you can love one another yes sir that's the great commandment great thing though you speak with tongues of men and angels and have not love it profits you nothing anybody here ever spoken tongues of angels angelic tons a French for German or Spanish or something that was interpreted anybody here if it could speak of tongues of men and of angels give our bodies to be burned all these great things and we don't have this we're still missed into our mark though we were so deep then when people got up and left our preaching they said man that's a deepest a fiber now life but if you're better paid fall contrary well kiss it on you look you've just held a seminar of some sort listen to this in Christ's mystery I love you don't forget the commandments of God to your little children love one another love everybody right or wrong sinner or Saint love them anyhow if you don't then pray God to help you praise the Lord because God loved the sinner and the nature of God you see you if the man is wrong love him anyhow don't protective his sin don't protective his sins but in sweetness not in sourness and rebuke in sweetness telling of the hope of life that rests within you so Jesus Christ being revealed to you by the Holy Ghost if you can't talk to a sinner if you can't talk to a woman that's dressed wrong if you cannot do it in sweetness then don't do it you'll bring a reproach if you're approaching and bitterness or anger or smart-aleck attitude leave it alone you'll only produce a stumbling block notice this as we love one another we love God so pick that person that you struggle with and think as I love brother so-and-so or sister so itself that's the way I love God and I love them with restraints I love them very little I don't care for them that well that's the way you love God cuz when you've done this to the least of these my brothers you've done it to me uh-oh some y'all just spread this the red and white checkered table cover back out get that salt out of your hand get that salt out of your hand pick up a sword we'll break it up this picnic around don't you reset that table on me you get your hand out that refrigerator oh listen to this watch him as he just keeps going keeps going on up to the end of his ministry same thoughts same thought this says we love one another now I cannot love him without loving you and if I say I love him and don't love you the Bible said I'm a liar notice again how do you know how will the world know that you love Jesus when we love one another that's how the world see God sees your face the world sees your action love one another now be kind to one another talk with one another be patient was one another well that's hard to be sometimes any man sometimes some of the people you go to church with are the sorriest bunch of mud I'm telling you what I don't know working anybody love them well God does so I guess if you're a part of him you got to love them do you put up as their shortcomings say for that but yours y'all put up a mine I put up in yours God puts up with us all and the love of God in our hearts will make us like him to put over you realize that's not the image of God this that's human part that we clash on that's not the image of God but the image of God has set something down on the inside but if we're not careful we so look at that outside we can't even love the inside because the outside stumbles us we love one another if we don't love one another we can't French so you see how serious this is if there is one person in this world that you hate there's something wrong with your walk was God not only you don't know what I've done I don't need to have you ever been treated to one percentile of the way my Lord Jesus frustrated northa let me go a bit farther most on my own aha love you with undying love listen level another you cannot dislike your brother who you see and say you love God now listen friends he brings it on down on Arts in our thinking he doesn't say hate that you hate your brother but you just dislike him he's still working on me did y'all see my sign under constructions y'all got yours out hold out your sign under construction Lord Jesus you cannot dislike your brother who you see and say you love God you haven't seen see so just love one another then you serve one another you serve God is that right as you've done to the least of these that Scott quickening power in them you've done it unto me what's the image of God the quickening power is the image of God or what would make us want to dislike I want to say something the crashing of this you've got one culture I got another use race and a certain protocol I was raised in another you've got a certain makeup I've got another little price and it'll rub wrong you remember what they cover the outside the tabernacle is badger skins matches a mean little feller but there's one thing about it before they ever put them badgers together they had to be dead when the old animal nature had to be dead and gone you imagine taking two badgers and sewing them together with their lives I can imagine you won't have no fingers left is what I can imagine cuz they're gonna tear your fingers off but if you kill that animal nature and let the animal nature leave then what is left the skin of the badger then you can sow a black one - a white one and they neither one got racial profiling hey man you can show European to an Asian or whatever more and they hug one another and call one another brother wah that'll racial thing install that Oh animal thing is dog and they can be showed together to make her a shelter of the holy presence of God may God help us that he can take our old badger skin and show it to that brother and that brother and that brother in that brother that we collectively can be the house of God you know what they dumber than batches they dip them all and crimson red you know who that red dye come from a female insect that had a little bitty drop or two drops in her body and they took that out of this female insect to make a certain color of red or crimson in the tabernacle and they would take that dye can you imagine how many insects it would take to pour that full of this dye glory to God when they put them in one might have been white the other might have been brown now they might have been black but when they pulled them all out there's all the same color that God hallelujah I'll tell your friends folks around this message that got race problems think outrace bombs I got soul problems they got soul problems they need to be took to the VAT of the blood of the Lord Jesus and died and they can buy they can grab a black man from Africa or a brother from Philippines or Asia or wherever they are and hug them ransom my brother I love you we are a one soul one move one body of all church it makes no difference whether you're black white red or yellow want some badges was God in that fact they come out of the lawn they come out of there so and dude with something that'd change them and transform him that they could be the hiding place of Jehovah what an opportunity God's given us that we in our bodies and in our church can be the tabernacle of the Most High [Applause] mother bream said when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises a standard against it just keep lifting yourself up in prayer before God cling to one another hold to God for if you love one another it shows you love God and this one all men know that you're my disciples when you have loved one for the other things that are to be in the last sermon that actually preached before communion and then this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another that's right if we can't love one another who we do see how are we gonna love God brother been said years ago at the Tabernacle no clothes that the people there at that church was so in love with one another they would cry to see one another again they would cry because they got so homesick for one another and perjures had come to him and said how do you do that how do you do that in that church to make them people so loved so this was the foundation of brother brems ministry the man that we say we believe what a far cry we are from the spirit this message was introduced but instead our churches have become picnic grounds our homes our lives people go to church they don't like it it's too hot it's too cold I don't like this how about that in case you hadn't noticed we don't have a suggestion box in the back of the church this is not McDonald's we're not here to please each one of you that's totally impossible anyway we are here to lay aside our differences but brother Donnie I'm looking for churches perfect perfect this is an ER this is a hospital this is an ER it's a psychiatric ward don't tell me it ain't I know it is I'm looking for the perfect church sign no such a thing this is horseshit folks are helped this is what drug addicts can be set free this is what drugs can be set free this is not a perfect place people's got all kinds of soul problems and spiritual problems and physical problems but they're coming to the right place and they're waiting in line to see doctor Jesus so it's not about you and what you think and I don't like this that ain't about that and ER is not set up for your particular taste it said help to dad the dying praise the Lord [Applause] well I'm not sure how long you made it through he might have got a couple of bats off his hotdogs but I hope after I got within 10 or 15 minutes he bout choked on that thing I hope his favorite tater chips got sideways in his throat and his favorite kool-aid I hope he never made it to his dessert look friends I want you to think how serious this is wouldn't you hate to know if there was a tally down inhale and Satan had your name on it of how many picnic days you'd made for him now appear people may not know that tally oh nice things beautiful things like oh look at her hair it's so long mediums got a tongue the same size [Applause] Timber like a buzzsaw and down inhale Satan's got page after page after page [Applause] and what you looking at all my picnic schedules with Donny these are past tense these are ones he said had a real nice atmosphere around him now is it that's Charlie Torres oh my lord not Yahoo himself you're kidding me brother Louie oh no but there's one thing I know and I love about my Lord Jesus his records up there in heaven might aboard the same thing against me that I said a lot of picnics for the devil but this one thing I've learned to do and I learned to did a long time ago and that was asked for forgiveness and when I do [Applause] oh this picnic has officially been canceled you got riding down devil the Holy Ghost over shouting at some point out of Holy Ghost eyes along the only one getting drunk around you're the night devil is us cuz you ain't welcome the only ones having a party or having a picnic it's all since we feed on the unfailing Word of God hallelujah now if you want to stay around where folks are shouting and praising God and talking in tongues you're welcome to stay [Applause] Wow [Music] and if not how I'd advise you to pack your lunch at the door [Applause] [Music] would have more pleasant homes more pleasant churches would just be more pleasant human beings if would stop having as many picnics with the devil know we're sisters I'll pick at this mess I just want to destroy all mountain pass records a picnic think of the children how many times have we the great message people we have given them opportunity after opportunity we have been his entertainment you husband's your wives preachers you people and we are his father yes entertainment if I could find him I'd mass his mouth but I can do something worse than that time I can determine by God's grace I want to live a life that's so pleasing to God but Satan will feel comfortable Myers he will feel comfortable in my life he will feel comfortable we have Church is that what you want is that what you really want is you tolerable we got some wonderful musicians here and wonderful singers and all that that was a cell phone driving away we're gonna announce place to worship we thank God for our driving away love divine love the greatest power in the world atomic bombs hydrogen bombs who knows what they've got now they didn't even drop in the bucket it's not lighting a match to the love of God let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus there's so many wonderful things that I so appreciate in love about brother Branham but one of the things is that he was so simple that he would take simple statements like this the devil's picnic the devil just has a picnic laughs at us and in it can be volumes and volumes of things this speaks to our hearts I pray to not Lord Jesus that those presidents and those listening we can look at each of our lives and realize how many times we have been Satan's entertainment when we were fussing and fighting and arguing and debating Lord the futures meetings and I've been to I felt like it was awful purchase fussing and arguing and back and forth and losing their temper and face turning red and awful awful preachers Lord of bedding ground or a picnic ground help us like Jesus help the men of this church help those that are made to be the right kind of example to their wives and their children to accept the responsibility of being a man Lord to look at their lives check their homes and see is everything in order is everything in line to place you or is it a constant place for Satan and his picnics help us in our church we know we cannot change the world we cannot even change the folks in our message but we can't change ourselves by your grace if we'll take what you've given us lord help us that we can love the unlovable I love to pray for the sick and sim get healed I've seen you do miracles Lord how many miracles have been turned over this pulpit testimonies of things you've done among us and we thank you but Lord for us to have your love in a divine way what a miracle that would be the Warner brother brems said he longed for the hour when the gifts would be laid up on the shelf and the love divine love would so move in the church that the Lord Jesus would take it over himself or if we come in church and somebody's got our Pew we don't get mad and stick her lips out we just move over somewhere else and get right in the service anyhow somebody's got our parking spot somebody done this and we just say hey that's not why I'm coming to church I'm a worshiper I'm a worshiper Sweatt may be running down my face and down my back I may be sent your luck on I'll sickle but I'm gonna do my best to break this ice and worship God help us lord please Lord Jesus forgive me forgive me Lord for ever opportunity I've ever had give the devil to have a picnic I can't stop him from coming around I know but I know your word tells me this if I'll submit myself unto you and resist the devil he will flee from me that's the kind of Christian I desire to be not once a week but every day of my life where he says I ain't even taken to a picnic lunch around Donny he makes you miserable that's the kind of testimony I want to have coming hey help
