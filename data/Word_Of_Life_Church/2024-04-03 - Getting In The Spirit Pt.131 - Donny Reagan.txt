burning here tonight right amen we just love our young people don't we praise the Lord amen uh remember this the last day to sign up for the young adult banquet is this coming Friday April the 5th if you're going to sign up get it done by this coming Friday if you'll remember that the young adult banquet remember that all the unspoken prayer requests I know there's tremendous needs in our group tonight let's just stand to our feet brother Rob if you'd come at this time take us to the Lord in prayer and give us a give us a little update buddy we appreciate this guy right here don't we amen God bless you all uh well first of all I've recovered it's uh Camp is amazing C Camp is amazing and it's and it's something over the years I feel like you know I talked to certain of you and and adults and I think you wonder how did they do how do they end up going to camp on a 12 hours on a bus right but it is something that uh you have to you do you want to be made for that and I I get it's like a privilege I get to go witness kids go to camp and one of the things about Camp that's so spectacular is their expectations they come right expecting God to move for them so it is filled with expectations I many of you and many of I I wish like we have almost camp meeting a lot here right as far as the the worship and the and the the love of God and the moving of the spirit but the in the children what you see is they're they they lose all their inhibitions and they are free to move in the SP spirit and to see that has been a privilege of My Life One of the the strongest experiences I've had with God is I think it's because we get away for 3 days and there's nothing else to concentrate on you counselors that are in John did you have a great experience I it's an amazing atmosphere and we have that and I don't want to take anything for granted it's so rich and it's also now the The Challenge and I speak to the youth that were there right you need to bring that back right to these people amen bring back what you bring your lick of fire back fact that you can you can share don't let God is Not different in Louisiana than he is right here in our home church right and so it is critical that you bring your experience back and what you got is you nail down a stake and say you know because one of the the favorite things that I have is that we come back and I make the kids talk to each other that they don't like that so much because I you know pull them and make them talk to each other but then I also make them do testimonies of what God has done for them so for a couple hours on the way back from the bus they're able to say like thing you know peace after peace after what God's given them and it's a treasure and there's a child that you think that they didn't really get anything and then they come out with something that's amazing so as you get an opportunity ask the children about what their experience was in Camp we did testimonies last year and they have some this year that are just as Supernatural just as wonderful but it's a joy to be a Christian in this day it's a joy they do a wonderful job in Louisiana it is solid and we're just so blessed and thankful we had two people get baptized from our assembly and a few more as well and it's just a privilege to be a Christian I cannot imagine what it would be to not be a Christian in this day I don't want to and I thank God for it let's pray dear Lord thank you for your grace to us I pray for the the inspiration of this service to be so rich and to flow so freely in the spirit I pray Lord God for the young people to let the fire that start in Louisiana continue on and and Catch Fire and a refilling of the Holy Ghost I thank God for a refilling down that I received it camp and I thank you Lord help me to keep that that fire burning let the children be an example for the for all all that that are here and I thank you Lord as we support each other in one body filled with love and grace I am so so blessed to recognize and so many people around the earth The Same Spirit whether it be different cultures and different races different uh age different age groups or whatever different groups and assemblies there are slight differences but you recognize that spirit of God that comes forth wherever it may be and you and and that's a um you bond with that Spirit you see it and you recognize I recognize you in my brother brothers and sisters and I thank God for that very fact as a revelation of the perfect love of God coming through the body is is something to behold

wasn't for the grace of God right wonder how many of you would be drunk tonight on dope laying somewhere in a grave dead lost without God but God in his Mercy has reached to us and given us his grace amen question answers tomorrow night at 7:00 still good for that Revelation is the lamb now we'll go to five chapters after he took the book watch as he moves from his position of taking the book into now sharing the inheritance of what's in the book Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven closed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head I want you notice the different symbols now and where they are pertaining to him so John sees an angel come down from heaven a mighty Angel not just an angel but a mighty Angel clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire so the pillar of fire had to be in the right place rainbow had to be in the right place then notice in verse two and he had in his hand so head feet hand he had in his hand a little book open and his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth so he sees him standing in s now one foot on the land the other foot on the sea with all these symbols and cried with a loud voice as when a r lion roars and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices so when he cries as a lion then out of that issues forth seven Thunders and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write so John was commissioned remember Revelation one to write what you see in here so John actually heard what the seven Thunders said in those mysterious voices so he took up his pen as would' say took up his pen to write it and he said I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and Rite them not now want you keep in mind now the seven Thunders were heard by a prophet they were not actually written in the Old Testament or in the four gospels or the Pauline Epistles but they were heard and a prophet was going to write down what they had said but the voice said seal them up in verse five and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven the things that therein are in the earth the things that there and are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer now remember this Advent of this angel of Revelation 10 is not declaring that there won't be any more increments of time because the Millennium which is over in Revelation 19 still comes after this which is an increment of time a thousand years but he's cutting off a time for certain things what is it denominational ages have run out right right no more time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets we are truly living in a blessed day amen amen we're going to pray and um I'm sure that probably some of you have heard by now that brother Ron Spencer had a heart attack like last night and they had to rush him to the hospital and they did a heart cast on him and one artery was 100% another one was 90 and another one was 70 they were able to put a stent in um the one that was 100 get it opened up but they didn't feel comfortable in doing the other two so I've heard from him today just heard from brother Mark if few me a few minutes ago and they're fixing to take brother Ron from the hospital that he is in in one part of Virginia up to UVA which is in Charlottesville and they're going to do the other one uh tomorrow the 90% one and the one that 70% is located in a very difficult place so they're going to try to treat that by medication brother Ron himself text me this evening and said these words brother Donnie I need a miracle so I text him back and said that's exactly what we're expecting that's right that's what we're believing for now brother Ron was just in Louisiana and preached and shouted and run and danced and I mean just had a Time must have made the devil already all been out of shape so we want to just pray for our brother that the Lord will just move for him and give him strength and uh I tell he's been through so much hasn't he but we we know enough about the program of God to know that some people are actually used for such purposes like this to be able to strengthen the other people of God and we know that it certainly has how many of you have a request you'd like to to raise your hand signifying tonight also have a prayer call here for a sister that will sister naen Patterson like to remember that as well Heavenly Father we come to you tonight Lord with Thanksgiving and appreciation for all that you've done for us for all that you mean to us Lord Jesus just singing about your grace and you were so worthy to come father you were the only one that could take this book and we're so happy that you did Father we come tonight that we might understand a little bit more about our inheritance and what you purchased for us naturally we could be some of the wealthiest people in the world but if we didn't know it we could actually live the life of a poer we could be set in on the side of the road as I saw a man yesterday and roll down my window and give him a little money he might have been a crook but I didn't know that for sure but my heart just went out to him and I thought Lord that could be me if it wasn't your grace that could be some of these people sitting here tonight they could be homeless they could be without a car without any friends and it's his son said lonely but you and your grace have smiled upon us tonight father and we want you to know we're so grateful Heavenly Father we bring before you tonight our precious brother Ron Spencer Lord you see what happened to him last night and Lord just in communication brother Tim this evening brother Tim said he was just so just so overwhelmed by this happening because brother Ron was doing so well and seemed to be enjoying the meetings and you you knew all of this of course father what we're praying for our brother just a few moments ago brother Mark text to me and tell me they're just fixing to move him right then so we pray that you'd be with him and as they transfer him to this other Hospital Lord we just ask that the grace of God would be with our brother as they undertake this procedure tomorrow we're believ in you father that you're just going to be with him May the angels of God be there Lord and just may everything go well oh Father we just believe that devil cannot take us until the purpose of God is done amen be with our brother Lord we've seen so many things that's happened to him and out of so many of them one after another after another the testimony of the power of God so we're believing you once again Lord it'll be the same way father I pray for my sister naen you see Lord this need in her body I'm asking you tonight in the name of Jesus that you'd strengthen her father we commit the speaker and the hearers of the word into your divine presence in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you Saints love you so much so appreciate you tonight you can you can be seated let's turn if you would to to Ruth also chapter 4 verse 7 I love I love parallels and types and anot types and all that in the scripture I love seeing how that God portrayed something in the Old Testament L it left it in mystery form and then would reveal it in the New Testament and then come the last days and even make it more real than it was then and when I read Revelation 5 and also Revelation 10 I I so see the book of redemption and the Plan of Redemption of what God had in his mind something that he wanted to accomplish people have read it for many many Millennia of course and they thought they had an understanding and they did they had a partial light of what God was doing but we're living in the day when God has promised according to his word that under the administration of the seventh angel there would not only be healings miracles signs and wonders but there would be an opening of the Gospel an opening of the scriptures that had never been given before I emphasized that to you while ago in reading that that it was a prophet which heard what the the four gospels and the Pauline Epistles did not declare now keep that in mind it was a prophet on the aisle of Pat that caught the unwritten word of God well you see that's the way God chose to write his Bible was with them men now if there's anything that God would want to reveal out of that which is not written in the pages of the scripture then he has one Outlet by which he can do that it is an infallible means and let me explain that to you it is an infallible means you see a prophet is so designed he's unlike me unlike you unlike any other of the fivefold ministry in that God gives him that direct channel of communication that channel is absolutely infallible now I'm going to do my best tonight to preach to you without any mistakes but I know before I even start I'm going to have some I'll either quote something wrong not intentional I'll quote a scripture wrong or a quote wrong or leave out an adverb and I should have used verb or use a noun when I should have used an adjective you know what I'm saying there's there's no perfect sermon I'm not made to when the spirit of God falls on my gift that everything that comes out of my mouth even the order that I say it in is infallible and when a prophet himself is talking without that anointing being on him neither is he he's just like any other man but when the spirit of God moves him in that realm God makes it so that that man speaks the infallible word of God now God had to have it that right that way because God was not going to print the Bible himself in the beginning and hand out Bibles to everybody but God wanted to allocate his word in certain dispensations and he would have prophets and through these ages and the spirit of God would strike them and God would say tell them so and so tell them it's going to rain tell them it's this well what scripture if you'd have been living in the days of Noah and you're a fundamental believer and you want to check Noah by the Bible what scripture would you check in by and what scripture would Noah give you that there is a promise in the word of God for a flood there was no such promise but Noah being a prophet had the ability to catch the unwritten word you understand same in the days of Moses how are you going to cross reference Moses mooses on the Ten Commandments how you going to check Moses out to make sure what Moses is saying by the law by the Torah first five books of Moses how are we going to cross reference Moses with some other writings to make sure what he said was the truth ah you mean you're going to take Moses word for it we're going to take Moses word people have taken Moses word for all these years that God bet him now was any of us there when God wrote on the on the tablets of s of course not yet we took his word for it because we saw God vindicate the man and if God vindicate the man we believe the message that the man said it's quite simple really when you let go of your thinking and it's the same way in the days of Amos and the day days of habac Hagi Zachariah Malachi all those prophets that have been down through the Old Testament same now when we come to the New Testament then that God anointed Paul to write down things that neither man Matthew Mark Luke or John wrote now how are we going to cross reference some of the things that Paul said and check Paul out by the Bible to be able to prove what Paul said was the truth now Paul said that the women are to remain silent in the churches as also saith the law I want you to stand tonight and show me where the law said that you have the opportunity ah now see not only can you not show me that neither can any Theologian because the law doesn't actually say it but because the law did not make an allocation for women priests the law spoke by its silence amen so a prophet can catch the silence part of God and recognize it that that was his program so a prophet can C catch that which is UN written he can catch the silent part of it and he's made to where that God absolutely trusts that channel you see God don't trust me God don't trust the office of a pastor God doesn't trust the office of an evangelist he himself made it this way because I'm not infallible no no is any other office there's only one that is and that's a prophet so then when a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord that is not the prophet standing there repeating the name of the Lord but it actually is the Lord himself now whenever that comes in that's why God would trust that and give that only to just a handful of men in comparison to the population that's lived on the earth now think about it how many true Vindicated prophets that there have been since Moses on down my goodness it'd be very very few in comparison to the populace of the Earth that has lived on there since the beginning of time to the end but God knew that he would not need Millions times millions of prophets he would only need really relatively a small number because he would be able to cover the span of time by which they would prophesy and everything that the people would need would be under the dispensations given to those few men is't that awesome and then God would have others that would come out from under them and they would preach what they had to say pointing back to what those men with that infallible gift have now you see the problem that ministry will have is that they get to a spot to where they feel so confident in thems that they step over the infallibility of the word and they said well you know the prophet almost said that and I'm sure that's what he meant I'm I'm sure that if he would have said something else he would have went ahead and said that that's when men become too conf of their own gift and they don't re recognize that they do not have that power of infallibility I'm sure you're you're familiar are you not familiar with a quote in the church age book that the power of infallibility would return in the last days now it's not going to come back to everybody it's not going to come to every preacher it's not going to come to every Pastor it's not going to come to Le no but it's going to come to the one that needs to have it which will be the seventh angel of Revelation 10 so then if a prophet on the aisle of patmas heard the seven Thunders and was about to ride them and the voice said don't do it then who do you figure in that office will be able to catch the revelation of what the seven Thunders heard wrote rather said on the aisle of patmas would it be a pastor would it be a teacher would it be a a songwriter would it be a Sunday school teacher a youth leader who do you all figure it will be what office talk to me now what office will it be do I have that Authority I do not does any other Pastor any evangelist Any teacher no don't you understand God must entrust that alone to one who has the ability to be a Seer to catch the unwritten word you see a prophet is not just one that interprets what's already written and he does do that that's part of his credentials he interprets that which is already written but he also is so made that he can catch that which is not even written thus far and God can speak that through him and it is the true word of God I I find it so amazing though how many people that say they believe the message of the hour that do not believe that point I just gave you oh I check out preachers sometimes with that one because it stumbles even preachers and you realize they really don't believe the prophet either they think he's like a commentator he's like a Luther or a Weist or a Wickliffe or some of those men Adam CL John Wesley Charles Wesley just men that wrote A Commentary of the Bible and then any of us have the right to question them we don't even know what a prophet is if we believe that's the way brother Bram was but a true prophet of God that is part of his credentials not because I say so but because that's what God identified them being look in the book of Deuteronomy sometime and you get a chance and the Lord said that I will raise them up a prophet Moses prophesying it and said the Lord said that he would raise up a prophet like an unto me and you will say unto me how shall we know if a man is truly a prophet he said that man that speaks in my name and what he says does not come to pass you will know I have not sent that man but if I have sent a man that is a prophet and he speaks in my name then fear that man fear that man because what he is saying is not from him but it's from the Lord himself now whenever God was going to then reveal the mystery of Revelation 10 now there must be a a human a human counterpart on the earth that'll be able to match the revelatory grace of God of what God wants to do so God just can't pour it out among among a whole big bunch of people and you'll get a little and you'll get a little and you'll get a little and you'll get a little and you and you and you and then we all come together try to figure it all out you talking about a mess that's what denominations do well I I feel this and I I feel that God could never trust his word to that he's going to finish up the ages the same way he started them years ago with the power of infallibility given back to the only one it could be given to there is no one else that ever lived in time that could have ever fulfilled Malachi 4 but the one man who had his name written there somebody say Amen now to me this is why it's so important that we never never ever leave this message because it holds and contains the very ending of the mystery under the administration of the seventh angel for when the seventh angel shall begin to sound then should the mystery of God be finished not before it was not finished in the days of Paul now how wonderful and what a great man of God that Paul was but the mystery of God was not finished Paul never preached about the Seven Seals he never knew nothing about them if he did he didn't ride them we don't find nowhere in the Pauling Epistles where he mentioned the seven Thunders one time he never mentioned the Seven Seals do you understand when John catches the revelation of the Seven Seals on the aisle of panas all of the apostles were dead and buried their theophanies they were living inside their theophanies in the sixth Dimension Paul was already gone Peter was gone James and John Bartholomew was gone all of the original 12 were already gone they never preached the seals they never knew anything about the seals or the seven Thunders why it was not their age so what is God going to do is God going to trust it then after the last prophet that many people think on the Earth was Paul so if the last Gentile Prophet was going to die how is God ever going to get them Thunders which was heard by a prophet how is he ever going to get him back on the earth unless he's got a counterpart to that in the last AG so who will it be won't be a pastor won't be a t evangelist it won't be a money loving preacher it won't be a compromising preacher it'll have to be a prophet on the earth with the power of infallibility then God will give to him and it will be totally scriptural now remember no true prophet of God is ever going to say something contrary to what another Prophet has said and this is why God CHS this way because it's actually himself so it was God using Amos God using habac God using Zephaniah God using zachari so whenever years ago whenever they put the Bible you know through all this great software and able to come out on the other side and they attributed the whole book being to the power of one being because there was thoughts and phrases and things that was run through the entire Cannon of scripture and it wasn't like all these different authors it was all put together but somehow in their computer science they come up is one thing that there's one being behind all them different books and they're written over different spans of time different nations on the earth different men why but one man one being almighty God was the one who inspired them all well don't you understand if you and I get the Holy Ghost that same God living inside of us he'll say Amen to his word so he won't make you say amen and then make me mad make you aggravated make you happy if we've all got the Holy Ghost we've got to say Amen to the word of God why because it's the same author that inspired them to write it so then God knew that there would be a reservation of his word that would be left in the last days why because we're really going to need something in this age the power of darkness is going to be released against the people of God like never before and the chains of Darkness are so pressing out of the regions of the lost and remember the K the lids been tore off the K as he told us in 19 1961 and many times we see the opening of the seals was only the Angelic side and the bright holy heavenly side but there was also another one remember if the seals come open then we know that it's the answer to the prophecy of the Old Testament that when the the powers of Hell Breaks Loose that what will God do when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him so if the seals come open and the revealing of the sun th ERS what was that it was a standard of God in the last days that was being raised against an evil that had never been manifested before in such a way is that right so God knew that this last day bride was going to face things that no other age faed now I granted the days of the martyrdom and many of those things they went through was absolutely terrible but our battles are somewhat different the church would go through a cycle of hardship and then it would get better and then they go through it again and it would get better but with us it's every day of our life it's in every you know it's trouble around you everywhere it's political it's trouble in your home trouble in your family trouble in the church trouble everywhere come on somebody say amen and it's like there's no reprieve once you get over one thing and you finally get over that three more sticks its head up and you get over them three and four four more come and five more and six more but I want to tell hell tonight we are more than conquerors we're not survivors I said we are more than conquerors but how how is that so how is that so because with the releasing of the mystery and people just take that as oh well that's just a bunch of stuff it's just a bunch of terms if that's all it is to you then they've never been revealed to you personally you see when God gives gives a promise that's the intellectual side of it and it can produce an intellectual Faith but with every promise comes a power to release the manifestation so you're able to live it don't you understand when God makes promise is known there's an element about him oh yes that's right praise the Lord that's wonderful that's good but if God don't release a power with that promise we'll never be able to make it ours we pack it under our arm we memorize it in her head and we debate and argue about it what good does that do unless the power of that promise comes in our life my many of us have quoted the scripture greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and we can quote that and not have an ounce of victory in our life well don't we have the promise we do we've committed it to memory we may have it underline yell and one Bible and green and another Bible and blue and another Bible but apparently the power of that promise has not been released to us if it had then whenever the Devil Comes against us we would stand right there flat foot and say let me tell you something devil you ain't got power over me you ain't got power to make me do wrong you ain't got no power to force me to do nothing I know who I am I'm a son or daughter of God I'm filled with the Holy Ghost you can't make me lie you can't make me do nothing wrong you ain't got no power over me you are a blood and I'm calling your blood on the basis of the revealed word of this hour get behind me sat oh but as long as it's just a good promise you go ahead and do wrong anyway and it feel like a dog cuz you done it why cuz the power of the promise has not been revealed to you but when it's opened up to you and you realize you don't what the devil ain't got no power to make you do anything friends get this out of your head that he's an all powerful being that can make you do whatever he wants to if he can you're demon possessed if Satan controls you and you have no power over him you're not even saved much less got the Holy Ghost come on somebody that ain't the way it is he's only trying to convince you he ain't got enough power to even make you lie he can't make you steal he can't make you commit adultery he can't make you pick up your phone and look on your phone at something filthy and ungodly he cannot make you quit church he cannot make you go to hell I wish somebody would preach with me tonight he ain't got enough power to do it and you need to recognize you are facing a defeated enemy he has no power power over the Church of the Living [Applause] God so let's look at the ceremony of the shoe the ceremony of the shoe I want you to notice that Jesus had one foot on the sea and another foot on the land I if you've ever noticed it in your Bible or not shoes the word Sho or shoes is not mentioned in the Garden of Eden or in the Book of Genesis but choose down through time after the dispensation changed and man was placed out then the word shoes the first time it's shown in the Bible is when God told Moses to take his shoes off so shoes can be a symbol of what you're fixing to do or where you're fixing to go it's also a symbol of power and possession you can can also be a symbol of captivity it can be a symbol of transfer of position property and Authority notice in Ruth 47 now this was a manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor this was a testimony in Israel therefore the Kinsman said unto Boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe now the Bible of course written by the same offer now people you know may wonder where did the prophet get all these types and one to where he got this and one to where he got that he was in real close fellowship with the author so you can see why that a prophet would have such insight into the channel of that forth submission you see what a prophet is is a window to the supernatural so even from Adam on down we had a little excerpts by which God opened up the dimensions and we were able to look at them for just like a moment and then back out but in this age God allowed us because this is the age of the homegoing and God wanted to familiarize his Rapture people with what's fixing to take place he allowed the dimensions to be opened up so we could familiarize oursel with where we are going so he allowed the prophet to be able to speak to us some of the things that he saw now maybe Jeremiah saw him but he never recorded maybe Ezekiel s and never recorded them but God allowed the prophet in this day to be able to go into those dimensions and then come back and say I saw this I saw that this was that and that was that and that was that and then we look into until it's like oh my oh wow what in the world so when God created and light matter time science where the unbeliever goes where the believer goes and where God is the seven dimensions were the first four light matter time and science the elements become to where that are natural like might matter time science breaks in from the fourth dimension into the realm of invisible now the invisible can come into the other three which is what happened in the form of demons and things sicknesses and diseases so a prophet is able to go into the fourth dimension in that realm and see Yesterday Today Tomorrow a thousand years or a million years whenever it is so he's broke broken out of time into that that Dimension and he can be able to declare things that had never been declared before and then he would come back down out of that real and said I saw this and had a scribe if you couldn't write in that write it down and I I saw that and and I saw that so when ever God wanted to open it up to us in this day and then in that realm demons were talking and they've been doing this for thousands of years they communicated with each other but we just didn't know it but in the fourth dimension he allowed the prophet say you're praying for a person with cancer and another person sting back there with another cancer and he' saw this communication Channel between these two demons and there'd be a dark Street go from this person to that one and he would hear them can't you hear them can't you hear them they're saying keep them from believing keep them from believing keep them from believing unbelief is gathering and faith is gathering he said how will the outcome go depend on which way you believe now you imagine them demons all these thousands of years had their line of communication that was totally shut off to the human race so they were able to talk and communicate we never heard them we never know nothing about it but all of a sudden God got a code talker on the earth so this code talker broke into their language and this for the first time it was made known what they look like and then there would be people that would come up and say oh I I see you're a Believer you're a Christian I want you to notice if you've ever looked at this in discernment he never like on a woman said I know you're a Christian because your dress is really really long and you know how ready toong on this but he said every time that he' identify him as a Believer it was by the light that emanated from within their soul now you see I can't see it tonight and you all can't say it I don't don't imagine but even around me and around you there's this pulsation either of light or of Darkness that emanates from the soul you follow me so far and that's something that's always been there since man was on the earth and yet it was closed off totally to us so God had one that could break into it and he wouldn't just look at the length of a woman's hair and the length of her dress and so on but he would communicate by light and darkness oh hallelujah praise the Lord and then when God wanted to write then some of these things in the Old Testament he said now part of it I'm going to make real plain but a lot of it I'm going to leave it to where that the scholarly and the wisdom and the proud and all them they'll never be able to catch it if they won't humble themsel and listen to one that I vindicate you see people totally missed that part even today that God wants to humiliate this age and God could have chose a a Harvard guy he could have chose a guy with so many degrees behind his name we could have wallpapered this whole wall with it but instead God chose a simple Kian praise the Lord so he took something that would appeared foolish in the eyes of the world and he would confound the wise and he would hear things that had been kept secret since the foundation of the world by Vision one night he was standing there preaching and at the end of the service when he got done preaching the Lord God let him see Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and he swatched Adam and Eve as they walked out of the Garden of Eden he comes back the next night and he said the service at the end of the service he said I I was so carried away and he said I saw Adam take Eve by the hand and I saw her walk out some of you wonder how he knew she had blonde hair and blue eyes well if you can see it in a vision well Hallelujah so what did God do God opened it up what if God would do that just to let him see him physically what about what laid in the word which would help give us a rapturing face that no other age ever had why they didn't need it Paul did not need to preach the revelation of the Seven Seals or the seven Thunders his age did not need to understand that oh but don't you understand first second third fourth fifth sixth and then God reveals the Thunders right at the very top of the pyramid and he sends the seventh angel with a restoration message and whenever those Li Believers on the earth those living ones when they catch that Revelation and the time rolls around and they see who they are then the Rapture will go their FA rising to the Capstone level will call the dead out of the grave it will release the saints of God from the sixth Dimension the entire body cemented together from the top down woo [Applause] Hallelujah so you see we've got places to walk we've got places yet to tr notice this so in Bible times the foot symbolize power or possession Deuteronomy 1:36 save Caleb the son of jafan he shall see it unto him all I give the land that he has Oh you mean it wasn't enough to believe it oh now what if he said I agreus with the Landis I agree us with the propheus but I'm just not going to walk us what if you ain't going to walk us you ain't going to get nothing this come on Saints it's the same way you and I God's given already done paid the price for Divine Healing but you will fight for every healing you ever get from God if it ain't no more than a headache or a toothache you'll fight to get it and then you'll fight several days afterwards to keep it well come on because God knows his kids are Fighters he knows he don't have to Baby him around a bunch of denomination or whatever more but he knows they'll fight through hell they'll walk away from family members they'll walk away from church members it don't make no difference what they've got to do they are ordained of God they are tied to the original [Applause] altar oh my God said I'm going to give it the land to him he has trodden upon it and to his children because he has holy follow the lord look what you impart to your children you parents tried this land they wasn't even in the original trading but they inherited their father's inheritance praise be to God Deuteronomy 1123 then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater Nations listen this and mightier than yourselves God wants to know up front y'all can't even do this you're a weak people you're a small people you the smallest people on the Earth but God said I chose you anyhow and God said just to remind you of how little you are well he likes to do us the same way it's an amazing how God can remind us of how little we are how powerful we are in the very same verse but you know what he wants us to do he wants us to realize how little we are in this but how powerful we are down here and ourselves will'll never do it I don't mind telling you I would not want to live one minute I would not want to live one minute and face the devil lord and mercy is a power of Darkness the way it is in this age I wouldn't want to live one minute without the holy ghost in my life would you but with the Holy Ghost in me I'll face any of them that God allows to come before me and I'll tell you I will overcome them why he'd never let them come against me if I couldn't oh my notice in verse 24 every place s on the thoughts of your mind your mental attitude every place where in The Souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours now if there's any Palestinians that's listened to us tonight from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates to the uttermost Sea so I believe from The River To The Sea as well from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean glory be to God and he wasn't talking to Hamas come on somebody he wasn't talking to No Children of Allah cuz there ain't no God name Allah Noah he wasn't talking to a bunch of heathens he was talking to the Seed of [Applause] Abraham praise the Lord Joshua chapter 1:3 every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses and you know what's sad about that verse we just read in Deuteronomy 11:24 they never never never obtained this promise it has never been done even in the days of Solomon but it will be in the Millennium and then when I think of them I think about us and I think so what promises brother Pete has God allocated to us in the message in the end time how much of our land brother Larry will never be conquered oh Lord but I'm glad it's separated you see when we're looking at this we're talking about n National possession but some of them people got every inch of ground God described to them because they had an individual possession as a group as a move of God we're identified as a message but as an individual I'm getting all my property even if you don't want all yours come on somebody brother Dave you want yours you can get it if I don't go on you can get everything belongs to you come on somebody why because God makes it so that as an individual you will not be bound down by my laziness or me Bound by yours but I can rise up and say Lord God you promised it it's mine and I can tell you about Caleb I can tell you about others even though many of those other people never forgot their full inheritance O CB walked up there and said give me this mountain God's Prophet said I could have it I'm just as able today to fight I'm able to go out and come back in glory to God he said I'm 40 years older but let me have this mountain where's that devil at let me have him let me at him oh my notice Joshua 3:13 and it shall come to pass his soon soon as the souls of the feet of the priest that bear the Ark of the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that came down from above and they shall stand upon a heap Hallelujah so what if they would have just thought about it what are you trying to do move the Jordan back God didn't say thoughts he said feet Glory feet so Footprints truly means possession notice in Joshua 10:24 he came to pass when they brought out those kings under Joshua that Joshua call for all the men of Israel and said it to the captains of the men of War which went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these Kings Joshua said come on boys that ain't just me it ain't just a hierarchy but I want some of you fighting guys come on up here so they humbled them Kings and them old boys come over and say can't wait can't wait can't wait I'm going to put my big foot on top of old big neck the son of anoch I'm going to put him on the jebusites I'm going to put them on the H tight what did that mean Footprints meant possession you see what you had your foot on top of you was claiming as yours so what is that that angel of Revelation 10 if he's got one foot on land and the other on sea what's he doing he's claiming it back Hallelujah he's claiming it back this is for me and my children I'm going to stand right here he said and say time for denominational ages has run out it's time for the calling of the Bride it's time for the marriage of the laamb and the bride's got to get herself ready and my feet upon these two real say the dead shall come out of the Sea and the dead shall come up out of the earth Hallelujah see you won't be able to hold them Earth you won't be able to hold them I claim every one of [Applause] them now you imagine some Little old fell come up here maybe had one ear flop down you know on one eyes was kind of funny and he didn't want much to look at he said come on buddy and now there LS a Big King Big Rich King he might have been a little bit nervous but the go ahead son put your foot on that lying devil put your foot on the neck of that that high blood pressure devil put your foot on the neck of that cancer devil put your foot on the neck Oh Glory to God of that devil that's trying to steal your boy of that devil that's trying to steal your daughter or break up your home put your foot on the top of that neck and say you're a dead devil you're a dead devil you ain't getting my boy you ain't getting my daughter and they came near and put their feet on the necks of them first Kings chapter 5:3 thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house unto the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every side unto the Lord put them under the souls of his fate you see the dispensation changed with David the reason Solomon didn't have to fight any wars was David done burn all the rest of them up he done killed everyone that needed to be killed he slayed Giants bigin Lin fatland skinni didn't make no difference what they were and he made a way chill fathers listen listen what you can do for your children you can make their way a lot easier seow the right kind of seed do the right kind of thing let them have a father that reads and praise a daddy that they know calls upon the name of the Lord you can make it easy for your children oh come on somebody you can make it easier for your children to have a heritance and an inheritance we behind to them fathers of children that know my daddy called on the name of the Lord my daddy was an honest man my daddy was a man of integrity I was somebody would preach with the T night and because you have done that then your Solomons and your daughters will be able to say hallelujah now I can go into the Millennium because my daddy my mama live the right kind of [Applause] Life Psalms 86 thou mest him to have dominion talking about men over the works of thy hands thou Hast put all things under his feet Ezekiel 43:7 and he said unto me son of man the place of my Throne now notice the Millennium this is Ezekiel setting the Millennium and the place of The Souls of my feet don't you understand why the Rapture the Lord Jesus will never touch the Earth we will meet him in the middle of the air once them precious feet lifted on the Mount of Ascension his Corporal feet will not touch the Earth again in this way until we come together with him in Revelation 19 to the battle of Armageddon I find it so amazing that Russia is talking about Armageddon Germany is talking about Armageddon Poland's talking about Armageddon the United States is talking about Armageddon ah if it's that close that they're thinking that it's near I wonder how much closer the Rapture is for us notice this in Malachi 4:3 you shall tread down the wicked now remember the Millennium is approaching now you should tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the SES of your feet in the day that I do this sayith the Lord of hosts Hebrews 10:12 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting his enemies be made his foottoo wow so this is a promise a Messianic Psalm that David said Christ's enemies will be made his foottoo and you don't when you look at it I think that's what we're longing for when mortality will be swallowed up sickness disease trouble and God will have it subject to what his feet which is his body now notice sacred rights have also been declared by shoes Exodus 3:5 and he said draw not hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground so shoes are necessary only on the Earth because the Earth has become filthy and polluted so it separates your contact so when God would have them to remove their shoes they were leaving their unworthiness their dirt their FS as it were outside the door and walking into the sanctuary of Adonai hell Barefoot you see remember moving them symbolically with showing that they're separating the thing which is catching all the contagion and the dust and the dirt Joshua 5:15 the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so so here's an emanating presence coming from the captain of the Lord's host he tells Yoshua you won't need them shoes to separate you from the filth of the earth walk into my presence and I will sanctify you glory to God hallelujah 2 Samuel 15:30 and David went up by the ascent of the Mount of olet and wept as he went up and he had his head covered and he went Barefoot you realize some Churches still do this today some people still do it being Mexico City several years ago brother George Smith and we saw thousands times thousands of them as they was doing penants and they were crawling up this this mountain it was some type of Saint something or another and women with dresses on blood all over them steps as their knees were being tore on them rocks most of them barefooted left the shoes down at the bottom cuz they felt like they were on Holy Ground oh my now I'm me bring a stark contrast to that watch this in the trial sermon brother B said one night a little camp where I was fishing way back in the mountains I was laying back there and about 3:00 in the morning I seen a light coming I'd just been reading the Bible and I thought it was somebody coming shining through a KN hole or a lantern or something and it was way in the wilderness and I thought somebody was coming up the light was on the floor and it spread greater and greater and I heard of somebody walking and when it did it was a man he was barefooted so here come this Angel down on the earth and he didn't have no shoes on if that's the requirement for heaven I'm definitely going have to be changed are you talking about one tender-footed preacher I am Tenderfoot he was barefooted he had hair to his shoulders had on a robe and it like have scared me to death he said don't fear I'm sent from the presence of the Lord God to tell you you procure your life don't try to get from these things this is your calling God will be sending you to different places all over the world to pray for the sick and if you'll get the people to believe and be sincere nothing will stand before the prayer now what I found amazing was when I was studying this when the prophet is carried beyond the curtain of time oh I can see those women so pretty with long hair weigh down their back and long skirts way down they was barefooted there wasn't walking on a contaminated Earth any longer but these saints were in the sixth Dimension that didn't need shoes praise the Lord the significance of no shoe shows there's no dirt nothing they're picking up that would separate them I seen them men with shaggy hair around their neck red heads blackheads all different colors they were throwing their arms around and I could feel them I felt their hands God is my judge in the sacred book I could feel them just the same as I feel my hands on my face and they were throwing their arms around me no sensation of women like it would be now I don't care how holy you are who you are what kind of a Preacher you are preach or whatever you might be there's no man you can let a woman throw her arms around you without having a human sensation and the church said that's exactly the truth but brother when you pass beyond here and Yonder it ain't the way there oh my it's impossible it's all love everything is a real brother everything's real sister there's no death no sorrow no jealousy nothing and he sees the hair he sees the eyes he sees the teeth and he notices they're barefoot running through fields of beautiful Blu grass streams and hills and flowers and Barefoot notice he he gives this again he says when I looked coming to running to me it look like to me a million so the doctrine of my four and no more is a lie a million of young women about 20 years old I never seen such pretty women in my life their eyes look like stars their teeth as white as pearls long hair hanging down to their waist white robes on down to their feet and was barefooted barefooted what were they doing close to Eden than we are tonight you see the prophet said those that have died and gone on they are more privileged than we are man Carol was telling about the other day and I said you know but you think about it Carol I said in reality if we are alive and remain when the Lord Jesus comes when the Rapture comes we will not see the sixth Dimension right the sixth Dimension is there for them who goes by the way of the Grave many of them's been there for thousands of years we won't see that one we'll go straight into his presence oh praise the Lord now you see shoes can also represent preparation for a certain task that God wants you to do Exodus 12:11 and thus shall you eat it talking about the Lamb with your loins gted your shoes on your feet now friends we're in a journey and we need to be shaw it ain't time to go barefoot I'm talking my spirit now it ain't time to go barefoot don't you understand what the devil's doing to thousands of these message people they think they don't need a church to go to they think they don't need a pastor don't you understand what they're doing they're Barefoot they're walking barefoot in this ungodly sinful dark world and they think they're all ready for the Rapture how can you be ready for the Rapture when you deny part of God's word does it make any difference to God whether you denied Malachi four or Ephesians 4 If you deny one word you're not going in the Rapture how can you go in the Rapture without believing every word of God so they were to eat the land with bitter herbs and they were to do all this and have their shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover Ephesians 6:15 Paul going through the Armament of the gospel and your feet shine with the preparation of the gospel of peace but sometimes shoes simply was a status of the wearer's freedom the prodical son returning back home the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe which we know was his robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet amen shoes on his feet so the father told a servant to go get a robe and go get shoes and go get a ring what was it preparation of the gospel of peace who's it litigated by the Servants of God who are anointed in office of representation of the Lamb himself people do not believe that the true God called ministers are here actually representing the lamb come on somebody they're doing what the lamb has ordained them to do what is that to shod you because there's many snares there's Nails in the road there's all kind of things that you're going to get into yes friend we need shoes now Barefoot time is coming but it ain't right now and we need to be shot by men of God that know the snares of the devil we need men of God oh Hallelujah I don't want some pansy come trying to pasture me and say oh you don't need them old shoes my goodness just get these old flip-flops that's good enough flipflops ain't good enough on nails flipflops ain't good enough if you're deal with a bunch of copperheads and rattlesnake man I want hip boots up to

Christ I don't want to stand out there with a PA of flipflop song I want to stand out there with combat boots on the Lord Jesus did not go down to Hell and knock on Hell's door and the prophet said he kicked that door so hard everything on the walls fell down and he kicked the devil back in there and shut the door on him he didn't have on a pink pair of sandals he didn't have on a pink pair of flipflops he had on the gospel shoes Oh Glory that's exactly what you and I need in this [Applause] hour in the Feast of Pim anybody know what that is that's the feast that was established by Queen Esther and morai you remember remember the story of course Brother David Siler just oh my did an awesome job bringing that to us in our meetings and what they would do and they still do it to this day

Glory I read it not long ago where the Prophet said this folks had come to his church to his Baptist Church there's some black folks and they come in and they started kind of moving around a little bit you know got out in the aisle started carrying on he said oh what's my Baptist Church going to think what these people going to say he said the next thing I knew I found myself out on the floor dancing with that woman I realize that's not a favorite quote of a lot of folks in the message that hadn't had a Pentecostal experience and that's what I figure a lot of the problem is the reason a lot of folks don't want our children to have the Holy Ghost because ain't got it yourself I don't understand anybody that's got the holy ghost that wouldn't want everybody to have the Holy Ghost why would you have the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and want your children to have an intellectual something no if you've got the real Holy Ghost you want them to experience the same thing you got you want them to feel the power of God I I sat the other night and I heard my four granddaughters talking about being in the Pres of God and how the Holy Ghost come down you know the spirit of God Mo I thought Lord what a treasure let your mama lean over the curtain of time let her be able to hear what her what her daughters is talking about the presence of God brother Jonathan and I was talking the other day call me and was talking about one an experience he had down at the camp I said Thank You Jesus I said Thank You Jesus I felt like taking off running myself why I want our church to know there is a living God I want you to know there is a resurrected savior he ain't dead he's still in the healing business he's still in the saving business he's still delivering and setting folks free come on somebody I believe he wants to do it on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning on Monday night on question and answers tomorrow night he wants to move Among Us he wants to prove himself that he's the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever praise the Lord oh ain't he good let's pray together dear Jesus how we thank you what a day to be living in father one day the power of God will sweep over this entire Earth they'll be living in different time zones some of them asleep in the bed some of them already working some of them just stirring and the presence of God when the bride arrives to that place and they'll see their loved ones appear in the room and they know it won't be long praise God what a time it's going to be when all them holy rulers get together praise the Lord oh Jesus don't let to be one of us missing father that day oh Lord God I pray you'd pull back the seals father let us see not only our message inheritance as a group but may we see it as an individual if my brothers don't go on father I want all my land if my sisters don't go on it start happening of course we know in the Book of Judges when Joseph and then was manasse then Ephraim they did not drive out these inhabitants and then this tribe didn't drive out that inhabitants and before long it swept the entire move of God of that day and the next thing they knew they had these parasites amorites Hittites hivites jebusites all those Canaanite people living right on their land next door neighbors to them they traded off a complete possession for a partial possession and years later them people became a thorn in their sides and led many of their children off into idolatry because them parents did not take all their land they let a little bit of sin go to creeping back in and this creeping in and that creeping in they thought they had it under control in their generation and truly most of those people never raised up in that generation they waited till the next one so it was the children of those compromising parents that began to deal with help us to see the same thing father oh Lord may we keep the standard where you've always had it on truth and Purity not only for ourselves but for the sake of those coming behind us because we are sowing seeds today of what this church will be tomorrow if there is one so if we SE a little bit of doubt and a little bit of fear a little bit of compromise here and a little bit more compromise there if you te within 10 years from now or 15 no doubt by then I'll be so old I won't be able to preach so who would they get then some younger fellow there's plenty of these out on the message today that's just looking for a church and looking for a pull pit they'll do whatever they have to do to get it I know it's hard for them to believe that but if they had to deal with preachers the way that I do they'd understand it a little clear we've got as many parasites and hivites and Hittites and Canaanites it's awful Lord God may we keep our swords in hand may we keep them so sharp we don't want no rubber sword so that if there is a tomorrow we can hand over to our children a true baptism of the Holy Ghost a God that still loves and still moves praise God that's what we want father as we go from this place tonight Lord would you go with us keep us bring us back Sunday Lord we look once again for you to meet with us and you allow us to be in your presence thank you Father we love you hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight father can we just raise our hands now in his presence before we go oh thank you
