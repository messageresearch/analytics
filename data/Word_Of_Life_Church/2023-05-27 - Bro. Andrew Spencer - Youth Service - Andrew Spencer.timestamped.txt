[18:39] we're gonna sing one more song before

[18:44] sing out because of who you are which
[18:51] I was thinking about it the other day
[18:52] and I was thinking about when we worship
[18:54] and how often times we're looking to get
[18:57] something out of it but then I thought
[18:59] about the real reason we worship the
[19:00] Lord is because of who he is and
[19:03] everything that he is to us
[19:05] so I just want to focus on that it
[19:07] really had this on my heart last night
[19:10] [Music]
[19:11] because of who you are I give you glory
[19:21] Because of Who You Are
[19:24] if you praise
[19:30] because of who you are I will live my
[19:36] voice and say Lord I worship you because
[19:42] of who you are

[36:32] couple portions of scripture in the Old
[36:34] Testament here in the book Genesis
[36:37] chapter 22 and verse 13 just one
[36:40] scripture there
[36:41] also Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23.
[36:55] Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13.
[37:00] and by the help of the Lord I'd like to
[37:02] speak to you something that the Lord
[37:04] woke me up about about a month ago and
[37:07] specifically asked me to say these
[37:10] things here or or just begin to deal
[37:12] with me and I personally never it's not
[37:15] how I would typically open up a youth
[37:17] service it's not how I would typically
[37:20] become acquainted with a congregation to
[37:22] speak some things like this
[37:24] but he he laid some things on my heart
[37:27] about a month ago to speak tonight on
[37:29] The Cry for Help The Cry for Help
[37:32] Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13 and
[37:36] Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[37:39] and behold behind him a ram caught in a
[37:42] Thicket by his Thorns by by his horns
[37:46] and Abraham went and took the realm and
[37:48] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[37:51] the stead of his son Exodus chapter 2
[37:54] and verse 23.
[38:10] amen Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23 and
[38:13] it came to pass that in the process of
[38:16] time that the king of Egypt died and the
[38:18] children of Israel's Side by reason of
[38:20] the bondage and they cried and their Cry
[38:23] came up unto God by reason of the
[38:26] bondage and God heard their groaning and
[38:29] God remembered
[38:31] his Covenant with Abraham and it's a
[38:33] very powerful thing when God goes to
[38:35] remembering his promises when God goes
[38:39] to remembering his promises something is
[38:41] laying there in store for his children
[38:43] and God remembered his Covenant with
[38:45] Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and
[38:47] God looked upon the children of Israel
[38:50] and God had respect unto them
[38:52] verse chapter 3 and verse 1. now Moses
[38:55] kept the flock of Jethro his
[38:57] father-in-law the priest of Midian and
[38:59] he led the flock to the backside of the
[39:01] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[39:03] even to up and the angel of the
[39:06] Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
[39:08] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[39:10] looked and behold the bush burned with
[39:11] fire and the Bush was not consumed and
[39:15] Moses said I will now turn aside and see
[39:17] this great sight why this bush is not
[39:21] burned and when the Lord saw that he
[39:23] turned aside to see God called unto him
[39:26] out of the midst of the Bush and Moses
[39:28] and said Moses Moses and he said here am
[39:33] I and he said draw not nigh hi hither
[39:35] put off thy shoes from off thy feet for
[39:37] the place where on thou stand is is Holy
[39:40] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[39:43] thy father the god of Abraham the god of
[39:45] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[39:47] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[39:49] God and the Lord said I have surely seen
[39:53] the afflictions of my people can we say
[39:55] that together I've seen the Affliction
[39:57] of my people
[39:59] which are in Egypt and I have heard
[40:02] their Cry by reason of the taskmasters
[40:04] for I know their sorrows and I am come
[40:08] down to deliver them out of the hand of
[40:10] the Egyptians and to bring them up out
[40:13] of that land into a good land and
[40:14] enlarge in a land flowing with milk and
[40:16] honey unto the place under the place of
[40:19] the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites
[40:21] the rizats and the hivites and the
[40:22] jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry
[40:26] of the children of Israel is come unto
[40:29] me and I have also seen the oppression
[40:31] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them
[40:34] come now therefore and I will send thee
[40:37] unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[40:39] forth my people the children of Israel
[40:42] out of Egypt may God bless his word he
[40:45] may be seated in the presence of the
[40:47] Lord as we said we'd like to speak to
[40:48] you just for a few minutes tonight on
[40:51] the cry for help and we realize tonight
[40:53] that we are serving a God who is a very
[40:57] caring God a God that knows all things
[41:00] he understands all things and we
[41:02] recognize that that by the teachings of
[41:04] the Bible that our God is an omniscient
[41:06] God and him being omniscient we
[41:08] recognize that he is omnipresent he
[41:10] knows all things he understands all
[41:13] things he sees all things there is
[41:15] nothing that is happening that our Lord
[41:17] Jesus Christ doesn't already know or
[41:20] have in his control and this conference
[41:23] that we've just read about here in
[41:25] Exodus chapter 2 came from a time when
[41:28] when God was speaking to Abraham and he
[41:31] told him that I am going to watch over
[41:33] your seed and your seed is going to
[41:34] sojourn in a Strange Land they're going
[41:37] to be there for 400 years and he
[41:39] recognizes that that that there in this
[41:42] moment that before Moses ever got on the
[41:45] scene that God had already made a way of
[41:48] Escape out for the children of God
[41:50] before they ever got in the midst of
[41:52] trouble and I think it's a wonderful
[41:53] thing tonight that before we ever got
[41:55] ourselves in the mess that we got
[41:57] ourself in that God has already
[41:58] pre-planned a way to get us out of the
[42:01] chaos of life that we sometimes get
[42:04] ourself into and it's a wonderful thing
[42:05] to know that the god that you're serving
[42:08] is already working everything for the
[42:10] good to them that love God and we
[42:12] recognize that that when Moses was in
[42:15] this spot that he was in that he was
[42:17] serving a God that would never leave him
[42:20] and never forsake Him and I say this
[42:22] tonight that tonight we're not serving a
[42:24] different God that Moses was serving but
[42:26] we're serving the same exact God tonight
[42:28] that can do exceedingly abundantly above
[42:31] all that you could ever ask or think and
[42:33] tonight we recognize that his eyes run
[42:36] to and fro and I know as young people
[42:38] that there are certain things in your
[42:40] life that you face in and there's
[42:42] certain calamities of life and things or
[42:44] anxieties of life that you're going
[42:45] through but there is nothing that our
[42:48] Lord Jesus Christ can't help you out
[42:49] with tonight can you say Amen tonight
[42:52] that God is able to get me out of the
[42:55] chaos that I am in and we recognize that
[42:57] very very familiar to the word of the
[43:01] three Hebrew children that God didn't
[43:02] send somebody else down there to get
[43:04] them out when they were in need of help
[43:06] that God himself came down there and he
[43:09] showed up now the Bible said in Psalms
[43:12] 18 and 6 that in my distress I called
[43:15] upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he
[43:17] heard my voice out of his Temple and My
[43:20] Cry came before him even unto his ears
[43:24] so David found him that in his midst of
[43:27] his distress and in the midst of his
[43:29] danger he called upon God and he found
[43:32] out that God was ready to help him in
[43:36] Psalms 34 and 15 it says the eyes of the
[43:38] Lord are upon the righteous and his ears
[43:41] are up open under their cry Psalms 139
[43:45] and 4 it says that therefore there is
[43:47] not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord
[43:50] thou knowest it all together thou Hast
[43:53] beset me behind and before and laid
[43:56] thine hand upon me such knowledge is too
[43:59] wonderful me for me it is high and I
[44:01] cannot attain it wither shall I go from
[44:04] thy Spirit or wither shall I flee from
[44:06] thy presence if I ascended to the heaven
[44:08] Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell
[44:11] behold Thou Art there so what was David
[44:14] finding out he was finding out that he
[44:17] was serving the god that is known as
[44:19] Jehovah's Hammer that the Lord is there
[44:22] if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there
[44:25] so there is showing to you as young
[44:27] people there is nowhere that you can run
[44:30] to that our God isn't already there and
[44:33] to think that tonight before you got in
[44:35] the Trap of sin and before you got in
[44:37] your sickness and before you got in your
[44:39] pain God heard you and he saw you where
[44:42] you are
[44:43] Psalms 107 and 6 says then they Cried
[44:46] unto the Lord in their trouble and he
[44:49] delivered them out of their distresses
[44:52] so you see there is a spot in life and I
[44:55] understand that you can go over in
[44:56] Exodus 14 when God is having a
[44:58] conversation with Moses and he says why
[45:01] cry speak but there are times in your
[45:04] life that you just have to have a cry
[45:06] session there's some times in your life
[45:08] that you are in the midst of distress
[45:10] and you need to be able to roll upon the
[45:12] Billows roll upon the bosom of Abraham's
[45:15] father upon almighty God and lay your
[45:18] head over on El Shady eye and nurse from
[45:21] El shadiah brother Bosworth told us he
[45:24] told us that the baby that cries aloud
[45:26] us is the one that gets the most
[45:27] attention and brother Branham says so I
[45:30] think it pays us to cry a little bit
[45:32] once in a while you recognize that
[45:35] immediately in the Bible that the Bible
[45:36] tells us about a woman that was a
[45:39] persistent Widow that was constantly
[45:41] knocking upon the unjust judge's door
[45:43] laying there and telling him to avenge
[45:46] me of my adversary but tonight you are
[45:48] not a widow you have a you have a
[45:51] faithful husband that is willing to help
[45:53] you out of any chaos of life that you
[45:55] are in but we recognize going back to
[45:58] our text tonight that God had a Time
[46:02] that he was going to fulfill his word he
[46:05] promised to Abraham and his seed that
[46:07] his seed was going to sojourn in a
[46:09] Strange Land I don't know if that's all
[46:10] right to put it there but I'm gonna put
[46:12] it there but he promised that Abraham
[46:14] that his seed was going to sojourn in a
[46:16] Strange Land for a long time for 400
[46:19] years but he was going to bring them out
[46:21] of it when the time of the promise Drew
[46:24] not and it's a wonderful thing to know
[46:26] that God has a perfect time that he's
[46:28] going to do things and I want you to
[46:30] know that you're in the time of that now
[46:32] so God raised up a Boy by the name of
[46:35] Moses and Moses was born for a specific
[46:38] purpose you know Moses had never heard
[46:41] of the voice of God he'd just been told
[46:43] about it by his mama and the daddy and
[46:46] the teachers of that day that such and
[46:48] such was coming that God was going to
[46:50] send a deliverer and he said it his mama
[46:53] would tell him says son I believe that
[46:55] you are the one and Moses didn't
[46:57] necessarily know it for sure but he was
[47:00] laying upon the experience of a his
[47:02] mother or his father and I believe
[47:04] that's the problem with so many children
[47:06] today or young people is that they're
[47:08] relying upon their mother or their
[47:10] father's experiences and they've never
[47:12] had an experience with a pillar of fire
[47:14] for themselves but they want you to know
[47:16] young people that that same Pillar of
[47:19] Fire that Moses met is in the building
[47:21] tonight so that you can have a
[47:23] conference with him say that you met him
[47:25] for yourself it's not just for brother
[47:27] Joe it's not just for brother Rob it's
[47:29] not just for brother Joel it's for
[47:31] everyone here tonight so Moses knew that
[47:34] God he knew God by intellects he
[47:37] understood him by intellects but there
[47:39] was something that was placed on the
[47:41] inside of Moses that seed that was born
[47:44] in him he was laying there in his heart
[47:46] and even though he tried with an
[47:49] intellectual experience with the word to
[47:51] bring them out to deliver them because
[47:52] he knowed that he was born for that
[47:54] promise or for that purpose and I want
[47:57] you to know that all the schools of our
[47:59] Theology and all the intellects can
[48:01] never be able to improve or never
[48:03] produce that power to get you out of the
[48:06] mess that you're in but the god that met
[48:08] Moses in a burning bush has the ability
[48:11] to get you out you see Israel needed
[48:13] Deliverance but Moses couldn't do it on
[48:15] his own on his own you need help but you
[48:18] can't do it on your own you know you've
[48:20] tried but you can't do it on your own
[48:22] but there is a faithful father
[48:26] Hallelujah they couldn't be delivered
[48:28] upon their own intellectual conceptions
[48:30] they needed a deliverer and they needed
[48:33] somebody that had met a mighty Angel
[48:35] that's why we needed more than just a
[48:38] school theology to get us out of the
[48:40] chaos that we were in that's why we
[48:42] needed a prophet messenger that had
[48:44] personally met the mighty Angel for
[48:46] himself
[48:48] you see Moses had that great call upon
[48:51] his life and he was basing it upon all
[48:53] that he knew until one day he found out
[48:56] that it was for him
[48:59] you see what it was all of the
[49:01] intellects was laying there but then the
[49:03] anointing came upon his intellects and
[49:06] it anointed what he had on the inside of
[49:08] him so you see your intellects are all
[49:10] right as long as the anointing comes
[49:12] upon it but your intellects as long as
[49:14] it ain't got no anointing on it it ain't
[49:17] worth nothing more than a piece of paper
[49:20] Hallelujah but you recognize that
[49:22] tonight that William Branham told us
[49:24] that the pillar of fire has what you
[49:26] lack
[49:28] so that pillar Fire come whirling Out of
[49:31] Heaven Come whirling out of heaven and
[49:34] came down upon that bush Dropped Out of
[49:36] Heaven came down upon that bush what was
[49:39] it it was God he was attracting the
[49:42] attention of his Prophet to show him
[49:44] that it was time for their attention to
[49:48] be drawn to Israel that their eyes
[49:50] needed not to be upon Egypt but their
[49:52] eyes needed to be upon God and his
[49:54] promise
[49:56] to be honest young people we sometimes
[49:59] we get into a spot when we focus
[50:01] ourselves so much upon the problems that
[50:04] we're facing and the current world
[50:05] crisis or the demographic that we're in
[50:08] and the thermometer of the world that
[50:10] we're in but God is doing these things
[50:12] he's sowing the supernatural he's
[50:14] showing us a supernatural to get our
[50:17] attention upon him
[50:20] you see if the pillar of fire would show
[50:22] up in this building tonight and I
[50:24] believe that it's here it is only doing
[50:26] that to get your attention
[50:28] you see brother Madam said that he was
[50:30] simply trying to attract the attention
[50:31] of Moses he said and you know he said
[50:34] how today the church is in bondage of
[50:36] sickness and he said the church is
[50:38] crying and been crying for years for
[50:41] deliverance
[50:42] you see and the devil will try to tell
[50:44] you that there is no help for you and
[50:47] there is no relief for you that there's
[50:49] no way out of your problem but I want to
[50:51] assure to you young people tonight that
[50:53] the devil would like to implant in your
[50:55] mind that that you are his
[50:58] and there's no way out of the problem
[51:00] and that he's got a claim on you but I
[51:02] want to tell you that is a lie straight
[51:04] from the pits of hell because the Bible
[51:07] tells us that you are of God little
[51:09] children and greater is he that is in
[51:11] you than he that is in the world now if
[51:14] there's a spirit that is a spirit of
[51:16] fear that is afflicting your life God
[51:18] didn't put that on you
[51:19] if it's a spirit of chaos or a spirit of
[51:22] unsetterness or a spirit of bitterness
[51:24] God didn't put that upon you you know
[51:27] the Bible tells us in second Timothy 1
[51:29] and 7 that God has not given us a spirit
[51:31] of fear but of power and of love and of
[51:34] a sound mind so God wants you here
[51:36] tonight in a sound mind upon his word
[51:39] the Bible says in Psalms 82 and 6 that
[51:42] you are gods and all of you are the
[51:45] children of the most high God
[51:48] look at your neighbor say I'm a child of
[51:51] the most high God
[51:53] but Satan would like to whisper in your
[51:55] ear over and over again that you're his
[51:58] and there's no way out of the crisis
[52:00] that you're in but I want to tell you by
[52:02] the word of God that there is a way
[52:06] when there seems to be no way
[52:09] you know what it's like to be in a spot
[52:10] when you need help
[52:13] when you need help and you can't get
[52:15] yourself out of it
[52:17] you need somebody bigger than yourself
[52:19] to get you out of it you know that the
[52:22] devil would lie to you over and over and
[52:24] over again and I find that a lot of
[52:26] times young people have a better
[52:28] opportunity to quote Satan's lie what he
[52:31] said about them than what they're
[52:32] quoting about God's word now we know
[52:35] that that there's over 8 800 promises in
[52:38] the Bible and I want you to know that
[52:40] over 8 800 times God never lied but nine
[52:44] times in the Bible the devil made
[52:46] promises and I want you to know that the
[52:48] devil never kept any of his promises
[52:51] the devil if he's whispering in your ear
[52:53] it's alive if he's telling you you're
[52:56] not good enough it's a lie if he tells
[52:58] you that healing isn't coming for you
[53:00] it's a lie if he's telling you that you
[53:02] can't get out of your trouble it's a lie
[53:04] if he tells you you're not good enough
[53:06] it's a lie if he tells you you're not
[53:08] qualified it's a lie if he tells you
[53:11] you're not election it's a lie
[53:13] I'll tell you what kind of person I am
[53:15] I'm a positive and a negative kind of
[53:17] person so if the devil is telling me
[53:19] that I'm not good enough that means I am
[53:22] good enough if he tells me there is no
[53:24] help for me that means there is help for
[53:26] me if he tells me I can't get out of my
[53:29] crisis that means I'm already out
[53:33] young people I don't care where you are
[53:35] I don't care what family you came out of
[53:38] I don't care what problem you're going
[53:40] through there is nothing too big
[53:44] there is nothing too big for my God
[53:47] I've watched for the past three years my
[53:50] father facing brain cancer and lung
[53:52] cancer and I have witnessed the power of
[53:55] the Holy Spirit
[53:56] that my God is greater than cancer my
[54:00] God's bigger than brain bleach not God's
[54:03] bigger than sugar diabetes
[54:09] you see remember the story when brother
[54:11] Brandon would talk about that man that
[54:13] came to Lincoln that he came up there
[54:15] that his friend had been put in prison
[54:16] for something that he didn't mean to do
[54:18] and he got himself in jail and he got
[54:21] himself before the firing squad but
[54:23] there was a faithful friend that went to
[54:25] the president or the land and he and it
[54:27] was talking to him he said look Mr
[54:29] President you had the power to release
[54:31] him or you have the power to kill him
[54:34] and he'd give him the pardon but the man
[54:36] went back to the prison cell he went
[54:39] back there gave him the piece of slip
[54:40] that Abraham Lincoln signed but what did
[54:43] the man do in the prison cell he refused
[54:46] the pardon there's a way out of your
[54:48] chaos there's a way out of your
[54:51] situation there's a way out of your
[54:53] depression there's a way out of it but
[54:56] you've got to accept what God has put
[54:59] before you you see a pardon is only a
[55:02] part and if you accept it as a pardon
[55:06] you see he had the power to release him
[55:08] and there is one in the building right
[55:10] now
[55:11] that has the power to release you from
[55:14] Every Chain of every complex of every
[55:17] sickness
[55:22] when you cry yourself to sleep
[55:24] he hurt you
[55:27] when you're asking for a breakthrough he
[55:30] heard you
[55:31] when you are asking for the Holy Ghost
[55:33] he heard you
[55:35] when you thought you weren't good enough
[55:37] he heard you
[55:39] don't you listen to the devil's life
[55:41] because brother Bynum told us in a
[55:43] church age book he said to listen or
[55:46] believe the devil's lie is to serve
[55:48] Satan
[55:49] don't listen to his lie
[55:52] it don't matter whether you hear me now
[55:54] or whether you hear this 10 years from
[55:56] now don't listen to The Devil's lie you
[55:59] were never his child hell was not made
[56:01] for you hell was built for him and his
[56:04] angels but you're not a child of Satan
[56:07] you're the child of the most high God
[56:15] you see you see I understand what the
[56:18] battles that you go through as young
[56:20] people I'm not too I'm 35 years old my
[56:23] wife told me when I turned 30 that I had
[56:25] to finally grow up
[56:27] I turned her down
[56:30] I understand what it's like facing
[56:33] the pressures of the age that you're in
[56:36] and I'm about 17 years
[56:40] past graduation and we recognize that
[56:43] every generation gets ten thousand or
[56:45] ten times worse so I can't even imagine
[56:47] what you're facing in the world that
[56:50] you're in but I want to Turn Your Eyes
[56:53] Upon the word of God you've not been
[56:56] given a vision to look at upon the world
[56:58] and see things as though they are not
[57:01] you've been given an Eagle Eye Vision to
[57:05] be able to look at the word of God and
[57:07] see the word of God as your preeminence
[57:09] in this life
[57:12] you see you see brother Brandon preached
[57:14] a very powerful message on the message
[57:16] look and if you go in there brother
[57:17] random starts talking about those
[57:19] binoculars how that you've got to learn
[57:21] to focus those binoculars he said at one
[57:23] time he said somebody was telling me to
[57:25] look out there at those lines or those
[57:27] antelopes and he said I was looking out
[57:29] there and he said I seen three he said
[57:31] but I knew it was one he said but what I
[57:33] had to do he said I had to focus it down
[57:35] I had to get my vision correct with what
[57:39] was out there and a lot of times Satan
[57:41] will try to blur up your vision to get
[57:44] you construed misconstrued on what you
[57:47] are to be seen you're not supposed to be
[57:49] seeing three Gods you're supposed to be
[57:51] seeing one God you're not supposed to be
[57:54] looking at something as seeing that you
[57:56] can't get out of it
[57:59] I want to say this to you there is
[58:02] nothing too big for my God Erica
[58:05] Parker's situation is not big enough to
[58:09] roll God's eyes and say well I just
[58:11] ain't got enough power to do it he's got
[58:13] enough power to do it and I happen to
[58:15] believe that he's more than able to do
[58:17] it because I've got my eyes turned
[58:24] the other day uh the other day I was
[58:26] getting out of the shower and I put my
[58:27] glasses on and I thought dear Lord I'm
[58:29] going blind
[58:30] I couldn't see anything everything was
[58:33] blurry I thought I can't read nothing
[58:35] something's going on
[58:36] but the big dummy right here forgot to
[58:39] have my contacts in
[58:42] so everything was double blurred I
[58:43] couldn't see things I wasn't focusing
[58:45] right and if you've got a filter over
[58:48] top of the word of God you won't be able
[58:50] to see the word of God correctly
[58:54] you see Moses had got to a spot that he
[58:58] had to turn his Focus away from what
[59:00] Pharaoh was telling him
[59:02] Pharaoh had the ability they looked out
[59:05] the same window Pharaoh only seen slaves
[59:08] and mud daubers but Moses looked out
[59:10] there and he'd seen Children of the
[59:12] promise what did he do he focused
[59:14] himself away from the lust of the world
[59:17] and the pride of the life and the beauty
[59:19] and the power of Egypt and he had those
[59:21] potentials laying on the inside of him
[59:24] Pharaoh didn't have those potentials
[59:26] there but Moses had the potentials to be
[59:29] able to focus it down
[59:31] to see what God was saying
[59:34] you ever looked at a problem and you
[59:36] looked at it in your eyes and then you
[59:38] turned it and looked it from God's point
[59:40] of view
[59:42] if you look at it from your house you're
[59:45] always going to say well I'm not I'm not
[59:47] able to get it I I'm not going to be
[59:48] able to have my breakthrough like this
[59:50] person had their breakthrough but if you
[59:52] look at it in the word of God
[59:54] you'll be able to see that it's for
[59:55] every one of you that whosoever the
[59:57] world the Lord will call it's for you
[1:00:01] so Moses simply he turned and he refused
[1:00:06] to see he refused to focus on the things
[1:00:09] of the world what was Moses doing he was
[1:00:13] taking his faith in the word of God and
[1:00:16] that's what faith is it's designed to
[1:00:18] see what God wills and God wants you see
[1:00:22] that's what your faith will do here
[1:00:23] tonight it's designed to see what God
[1:00:26] wants for you
[1:00:27] and the faith that is in you will focus
[1:00:30] you right to the word of God
[1:00:38] I can't imagine
[1:00:40] 400 years
[1:00:42] walking past Joseph's bones
[1:00:46] being beat
[1:00:48] being whipped
[1:00:53] but I got a promise land right here
[1:00:55] that were coming out of here
[1:00:57] I can't imagine a young people saying
[1:01:00] it's not for me when we've got the word
[1:01:02] laying right here
[1:01:03] I can't imagine what it was like to be
[1:01:06] beat day in and day out making bricks
[1:01:08] for somebody else
[1:01:11] but God had a promise you're coming out
[1:01:14] of here
[1:01:15] it might look like you are never going
[1:01:17] to get out of the spot that you are in
[1:01:19] but remember when the prophet was up
[1:01:22] there on Hurricane Mountain and he
[1:01:24] thought he was good enough
[1:01:25] to get himself out of their mess that he
[1:01:27] got himself in he thought I've got it in
[1:01:29] my nature I can get out of here but it
[1:01:32] finally got to a spot when he was on
[1:01:34] that Indian death walk that he realized
[1:01:36] that he didn't have the ability to get
[1:01:38] back down the mountain to where his what
[1:01:41] he truly loved his wife and his son down
[1:01:43] there he didn't have the human abilities
[1:01:45] to get himself down off of that mountain
[1:01:47] and go back there but he heard these
[1:01:50] words of Psalms 46 that God is our
[1:01:53] refuge a very present help in a time of
[1:01:56] trouble and you remember the story when
[1:01:58] William branham's up there and he sees
[1:02:01] there's a hand that touches him lays his
[1:02:03] hand on his shoulder and tells him look
[1:02:06] back there and he sees the point that he
[1:02:09] needs to be walking but what was he
[1:02:10] doing he had his hands up looking for a
[1:02:14] Lifeline looking for that line that he'd
[1:02:16] put up those years before let me tell
[1:02:18] you young people keep your hand up
[1:02:21] lift up those hands at once hung low
[1:02:27] lift up those hands keep your hands up
[1:02:29] brother random said one time I thought I
[1:02:31] grabbed it thought I grabbed it and I I
[1:02:33] began to shout about it he said but I
[1:02:34] found out it was just a twig or a branch
[1:02:36] but he kept his hands up and finally
[1:02:39] when his hand Struck it it was a sure
[1:02:42] fact that he was going to the spot that
[1:02:44] he loved and if you can find your name
[1:02:46] in the word of God you're going
[1:02:51] you're not saying on that mountain
[1:02:53] you've circled the mountain long enough
[1:02:56] you've been in depression long enough
[1:02:58] you've been in anxiety long enough
[1:03:00] you've listened to the world long enough
[1:03:02] get your hands up
[1:03:05] get your hands up God's heard your cry
[1:03:12] he's heard you cry when Zacharias was a
[1:03:15] priest and he walked into the house of
[1:03:17] God time after time he walked in there
[1:03:20] and he was offering incense when him and
[1:03:22] his wife had prayed year after year
[1:03:24] about having a baby
[1:03:26] but finally one day he walked into the
[1:03:29] house of God when he was offering
[1:03:30] incense unto the Lord and Gabriel said
[1:03:32] these words I have heard your prayer
[1:03:37] I have heard your prayer and William
[1:03:40] Branham told us he said if you want an
[1:03:42] angel appear to you get your life right
[1:03:44] get your heart right he said and God
[1:03:46] will hear your prayer and the angels
[1:03:48] will come if you've got the right
[1:03:50] atmosphere
[1:03:54] I'm on my own in this journey no you're
[1:03:56] not
[1:03:58] look at these brothers they would not
[1:04:00] have had this meeting if it was just for
[1:04:02] themselves they had it for you you are
[1:04:05] not alone you're not in the midst of a
[1:04:07] trial all alone there is one that
[1:04:10] sticketh closer than a brother brother
[1:04:12] Bynum said just walk unconscious of fear
[1:04:15] he said walk unconscious of criticism
[1:04:17] walk unconscious under the world walk as
[1:04:19] you walk in Christ walk with him not
[1:04:21] paying any attention to the right hand
[1:04:22] or the left he said just keep moving on
[1:04:25] something comes up in the church walk
[1:04:27] with God hallelujah his sickness strikes
[1:04:29] you walk with God if the neighbor don't
[1:04:31] like you walk with God just keep on
[1:04:33] Walking with God he said Enoch one day
[1:04:35] walk like that you know what he done he
[1:04:37] walked all the way home
[1:04:39] he walked with God so far up the road he
[1:04:42] didn't want to come back anymore Walk Of
[1:04:44] God doctor says you're going to die walk
[1:04:46] with God doctor says you can't walk with
[1:04:48] God just walk with God that's all for
[1:04:50] God has promised you I'll never leave
[1:04:52] you nor forsake you I'll be with you and
[1:04:54] to the end of the world he took an oath
[1:04:56] by the Covenant that he give you that he
[1:04:57] would confirm and just walk with God
[1:04:59] you're going to have your ups and downs
[1:05:01] don't you worry you go to the third
[1:05:03] you're going to go through Briar patches
[1:05:04] and over shop rocks over Bluffs down
[1:05:07] over the hillsides up to the mountains
[1:05:09] over Waters but walk with God
[1:05:14] what am I supposed to do brother Andrew
[1:05:16] walk with God
[1:05:18] just walk with God when Abraham was up
[1:05:21] on Mount Moriah and he was up there with
[1:05:23] his Isaac what was he doing he was
[1:05:26] walking with God surely if he can trust
[1:05:28] him in his 100 Year age to make him new
[1:05:31] again surely he can give him Isaac back
[1:05:33] again
[1:05:35] and when Isaac and Abraham was found
[1:05:38] faithful
[1:05:40] God provided for them a sacrifice to get
[1:05:43] themselves out but Abraham didn't have
[1:05:45] some intellectual Faith he had a genuine
[1:05:48] faith he'd already seen what God could
[1:05:51] do
[1:05:52] laughs I've already seen God feel young
[1:05:56] people of the Holy Ghost so I know he's
[1:05:58] going to do it again this weekend
[1:06:00] I've already seen our God deliver young
[1:06:04] girls out of all kinds of chaos of
[1:06:06] spirits
[1:06:07] so I know he'll do it again this weekend
[1:06:10] already know that God heals the sick so
[1:06:12] I know he'll do it again this weekend
[1:06:15] I know God listens to his promises and
[1:06:17] he remembers them and he cast out the
[1:06:19] devil so I know he'll do it again this
[1:06:21] weekend
[1:06:22] you don't have an intellectual Faith or
[1:06:25] you would be in the building
[1:06:27] you know what intellectual faith is and
[1:06:29] I'll tell you what it is it's a discount
[1:06:31] of Faith it's a faith that only gets you
[1:06:34] so far and you don't want discounted
[1:06:36] Faith you want the real genuine faith
[1:06:40] you feel the atmosphere in the room
[1:06:41] don't you you recognize it it's been set
[1:06:44] by your worship and by you Amen in the
[1:06:46] word of God
[1:06:47] but there's coming a time on Monday
[1:06:49] morning when you don't feel this
[1:06:51] atmosphere
[1:06:53] and you're going to have to walk with
[1:06:55] God you better hope that you have a
[1:06:57] genuine Faith because an intellectual
[1:06:59] faith will let you down intellectual
[1:07:01] faith is like buying something down to
[1:07:02] the Dollar Tree you know good and well
[1:07:04] it's going to let you down at some time
[1:07:07] is that right you buy yourself you buy
[1:07:10] yourself a car at the Dollar Tree it's
[1:07:11] going to leave you on the road sitting
[1:07:13] somewhere
[1:07:14] but if you're fired
[1:07:16] be careful here but if you find yourself
[1:07:18] a real genuine Ford at the Ford
[1:07:20] dealership he won't leave you Hank and I
[1:07:22] know they say that it's found on the
[1:07:23] roadside sitting dead but if you buy it
[1:07:26] down at the Dollar Tree it's going to
[1:07:27] leave you sitting somewhere hey if the
[1:07:29] prophet had it for it I guess it's all
[1:07:31] right for me to have afford sorry for
[1:07:32] you Chevrolet fans I guess you got your
[1:07:35] own heartbeat
[1:07:38] help me Jesus
[1:07:41] Genie a genuine Faith Ain't Gonna Let
[1:07:43] You Down
[1:07:44] but an intellectual faith will let you
[1:07:46] down
[1:07:47] you'll see if Abraham was dealing with
[1:07:49] intellectual faith he would have got up
[1:07:52] there brother Randall said he would have
[1:07:54] got up there and that intellectual Faith
[1:07:56] would have went to work and Satan would
[1:07:57] have said now what's Sarah going to say
[1:07:59] about this
[1:08:00] if you commit Isaac to that Altar and
[1:08:03] you slay him what's Sarah going to say
[1:08:05] about this but he didn't listen to his
[1:08:08] intellectual Faith he listened to what
[1:08:10] God Said and when he listened to what
[1:08:13] God Said God provided
[1:08:16] his way out
[1:08:19] let me tell you young people God has
[1:08:21] already provided on the cross 2 000
[1:08:23] years ago a way for you to go free a way
[1:08:26] to get out of depression a way to get
[1:08:28] out of suicide a way to get out of your
[1:08:31] chaos
[1:08:36] you remember when William Branham
[1:08:39] you remember when William Branham is in
[1:08:41] his early Ministry
[1:08:44] and he has a vision
[1:08:46] he has a vision
[1:08:48] of a sheep caught in a Thicket
[1:08:52] and he and he kept hearing this this
[1:08:54] sheep hollering hollering and crying for
[1:08:57] help and brother Brandon said I was
[1:08:59] going through those Briar patches trying
[1:09:01] to find my way
[1:09:02] find my way to and he said I heard that
[1:09:04] sheep behind you buying for it and he
[1:09:07] said I finally found it and he said when
[1:09:09] I got there it was crying Middletown
[1:09:13] Middletown brother Burnham didn't know
[1:09:15] anything about Milltown or of where it
[1:09:17] was or anything about it so he presented
[1:09:19] it to his church and he went up there
[1:09:21] went up to Milltown and you know that
[1:09:22] brother Branham was holding a Revival up
[1:09:25] there just trying to find where where
[1:09:26] the will of the Lord was and he began to
[1:09:28] hold a Revival and those things and he
[1:09:30] he's up there and he's just he's
[1:09:31] preaching away and while he's preaching
[1:09:34] there they begin to tell him that
[1:09:35] there's a little girl by the name of
[1:09:36] Georgie Carter that had been laying in
[1:09:39] the bed for nine years nine years and so
[1:09:42] many days dealing with tuberculosis all
[1:09:45] over throughout her body
[1:09:47] and there but the random goes up and he
[1:09:49] begins to pray for her begins to go up
[1:09:51] there and see her and she said I heard
[1:09:54] your story or I heard the story about
[1:09:56] the nailed little girl I heard that
[1:09:58] story you see faith comes by hearing and
[1:10:00] she said what brother back let have a
[1:10:03] vision for me do the same thing that you
[1:10:05] did for her he said I can't do that he
[1:10:08] said the Lord just did that for her he
[1:10:11] said that little nail girl was eat up
[1:10:12] with arthritis couldn't hardly move got
[1:10:15] up out of the wheelchair and went back
[1:10:17] completely normal
[1:10:19] Georgie Carter was laying in this
[1:10:22] condition
[1:10:23] and you know the story you've heard it
[1:10:24] over and over again but she was laying
[1:10:26] there because of a condition where her
[1:10:29] uncle took and abused the situation and
[1:10:33] because of that situation of him
[1:10:36] mishandling a situation he went in there
[1:10:39] I noticed immediately what happened
[1:10:41] because of that condition or that
[1:10:43] emotional uh thing that happened
[1:10:45] immediately tuberculosis is attached to
[1:10:48] her spirit and destroys her body Georgie
[1:10:52] Carter is ringing her wrist out upon
[1:10:55] those bed posts ringing out in pain
[1:11:00] she's ringing out in pain going through
[1:11:02] the motions trying to get help but she
[1:11:04] finds faith in a man of God
[1:11:08] and said I if he could do it for her the
[1:11:11] Lord Our God can do it for me
[1:11:17] the Bantam said he just prayed for and
[1:11:18] let it go and as it was he said I didn't
[1:11:20] see no vision that said but they had
[1:11:22] been taught by the current denomination
[1:11:25] that they were under
[1:11:27] that God didn't do those things no more
[1:11:31] I'm afraid that too many times that
[1:11:33] people have the belief that God doesn't
[1:11:34] do those things no more I'm not just
[1:11:37] talking about natural things of your
[1:11:38] body but I believe there's a lot of
[1:11:40] people that God don't give out the Holy
[1:11:42] Ghost no more there's a lot of people
[1:11:44] that believe that that she that we
[1:11:45] shouldn't we shouldn't preach emotion
[1:11:47] that we shouldn't preach all of these
[1:11:49] things and they say well that's not for
[1:11:51] our church or it's or we're past those
[1:11:53] days just preach us the word I believe
[1:11:55] that if it's in the word of God no
[1:11:57] matter if it's from Genesis or
[1:11:58] Revelation then we ought to preach it if
[1:12:00] healing is in the body then we ought to
[1:12:02] preach it if there's gifts in the body
[1:12:04] then we ought to preach it if there's a
[1:12:06] power of the Holy Ghost you ought to
[1:12:07] preach it had a God one time tell me he
[1:12:10] said well all you are is a holy ghost
[1:12:11] preacher so what else you want me to do
[1:12:14] what else you want me to do that's what
[1:12:17] I'm here to do this weekend it's preach
[1:12:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:12:21] I can't get you out of your trouble I
[1:12:24] can't help you 10 days from now but the
[1:12:26] Holy Ghost can
[1:12:33] and something may have happened to you
[1:12:37] not as bad as Georgia Carter but all of
[1:12:40] a sudden a complex can attach itself to
[1:12:42] your spirit
[1:12:44] and because of it it eats at your body
[1:12:46] it eats at your mind
[1:12:49] but God has heard your cry for help
[1:12:53] Georgie
[1:12:55] he's heard you he's heard your little
[1:12:58] lamb he's heard you crying he's heard
[1:13:01] you weeping he's heard you asking
[1:13:03] Georgie he's heard you crying
[1:13:06] he's heard you in your trial
[1:13:09] you ain't got some discounted faith
[1:13:16] what happened he worked his way through
[1:13:18] those Briars until he found the lamb
[1:13:22] what happened when William Brandon was
[1:13:24] up there praying and seeking the Lord
[1:13:25] them Briars were hitting him in his face
[1:13:27] trying to get him distracted from prayer
[1:13:30] but all of a sudden the spirit of the
[1:13:32] Lord come whirling over top of those
[1:13:34] mountains said go by the way of the
[1:13:37] corridors what was about to happen it
[1:13:40] was something in the natural that was
[1:13:42] getting ready to happen but I believe
[1:13:43] that it's for the spiritual tonight you
[1:13:46] may have been laying in your condition
[1:13:47] for nine years nine years you may have
[1:13:50] been laying there how long how much
[1:13:52] longer are you going to lay there
[1:13:53] how much longer are you going to cry
[1:13:55] yourself to sleep how much longer are
[1:13:57] you going to ask for your breakthrough
[1:13:59] but we're here to break some barriers
[1:14:01] down this weekend we are here to tear
[1:14:03] down every stronghold that the enemy has
[1:14:07] tried to attach to you
[1:14:10] you know what you know that if that
[1:14:12] plane if he can ever get to a spot that
[1:14:14] he can pass on past that sound barrier
[1:14:17] that it begins to move into another
[1:14:19] realm that it's never built before that
[1:14:21] it's never been before and you might
[1:14:23] struggle after struggle after struggle
[1:14:26] but keep struggling
[1:14:29] I've been through it over and over again
[1:14:31] go again press on keep struggling keep
[1:14:35] struggling because when you press
[1:14:37] through that barrier you're going to fly
[1:14:40] like you never flew before
[1:14:42] it's an unlimited speed when you can
[1:14:45] break through there and when you can
[1:14:46] break through your sin barrier young
[1:14:48] people when you can break through
[1:14:52] well necessarily what is sin it's
[1:14:54] unbelief in God's word I'm not saying
[1:14:56] you've got certain things in your life
[1:14:58] but sin any type of unbelief is sin
[1:15:01] against God's word
[1:15:04] if something comes in and you say well I
[1:15:06] don't know that's immediately where you
[1:15:08] sinned right there why well why didn't
[1:15:10] he do it for this that's where you sin
[1:15:12] right there it wasn't when you started
[1:15:14] drinking alcohol you sinned when you
[1:15:16] disbelieved God's word
[1:15:18] but if you can break past that sin break
[1:15:21] past that doubt break past those things
[1:15:23] you're going to break forth in an
[1:15:26] unlimited Revival
[1:15:30] Hallelujah if you can ever get past that
[1:15:33] sin barrier if you can ever get past it
[1:15:40] can I prophesy
[1:15:41] God's going to use these young people
[1:15:43] he's going to use a mouth of these young
[1:15:45] people to break cancer
[1:15:48] he's going to use the mouth of these
[1:15:50] young people to break doubt and break
[1:15:52] sin and break change and break
[1:15:55] circumstance
[1:15:56] he's going to use the mouth of these
[1:15:58] young people like the Bible said in
[1:16:00] Deuteronomy 30 and 14 the word of God is
[1:16:03] now thee even in thy mouth that thou
[1:16:05] mayst do it
[1:16:06] somebody is going to do what Revelations
[1:16:08] 10 8 says go and take the book and eat
[1:16:11] the book
[1:16:12] there's going to be a young boy or a
[1:16:15] young girl that rise up and said I'm
[1:16:16] sick and tired of the devil winning
[1:16:19] if you give up now you're gonna always
[1:16:22] give up
[1:16:24] if you always you're never going to win
[1:16:26] a surrender
[1:16:30] you keep surrendering to the devil
[1:16:32] you're never going to win the battle
[1:16:34] but if you said I'm here to win I'm here
[1:16:37] to press on I'm here to press the battle
[1:16:39] I'm here for the Holy Ghost I'm here for
[1:16:42] healing I'm here for my church I'm here
[1:16:44] for my breakthrough
[1:16:46] well the random was one time dealing
[1:16:48] with a lady that had colon trouble and
[1:16:51] she said he said he said now you're
[1:16:53] sitting there wondering when is it your
[1:16:55] time he said your time is right now I
[1:16:57] want to say to you young people your
[1:16:59] time is right now the time is at hand
[1:17:02] the time to break through is right now
[1:17:04] the time to overcome is right now
[1:17:08] don't you go down in defeat
[1:17:11] don't you walk away from this meeting
[1:17:12] going down in defeat you are here to win
[1:17:16] because the Bible said as a man thinketh
[1:17:19] in his heart so is he I was born a
[1:17:21] winner because I was born by the Breath
[1:17:23] of God
[1:17:25] I was born and Overcomer because God
[1:17:28] made me what I am
[1:17:29] I was born to be a devil Destroyer
[1:17:32] because God made me that way
[1:17:34] I was born to be a shouter because God
[1:17:36] made me that way I was born to be a
[1:17:39] dancer because God made me that way
[1:17:40] don't you back off when the devil tells
[1:17:43] you that you shouldn't do things that
[1:17:45] way God made you that way if God wanted
[1:17:48] you that way then you ought to be that
[1:17:50] way
[1:17:56] it's for you
[1:17:58] this is your time
[1:18:00] brother Brandon told us in the message
[1:18:02] power of God a very powerful message
[1:18:04] man y'all good group to preach to
[1:18:09] another man preached a very powerful
[1:18:10] message in 1955 he preaches he preaches
[1:18:13] on the power of the devil the power of
[1:18:15] God and then the power of decision very
[1:18:17] powerful powerful messages go listen to
[1:18:19] him and brother Bynum says there in the
[1:18:21] power of God he said Satan's power is
[1:18:24] limited
[1:18:25] so he's like a dog on a chain he can
[1:18:28] only go so far
[1:18:30] he can only go so far he can only hear
[1:18:33] that he can only hinder your walk so far
[1:18:35] he can only torment your mind so far his
[1:18:38] power is limited but brother random said
[1:18:41] directly after that he said but face
[1:18:43] power
[1:18:44] brings to pass God's revealed Revelation
[1:18:47] so faith says I'm more than able to do
[1:18:50] it I am persuaded that I'm a mighty
[1:18:53] conqueror
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:59] my goodness y'all
[1:19:01] y'all y'all y'all good people to preach
[1:19:04] to
[1:19:05] y'all enjoy the word of God don't you
[1:19:09] why are you enjoying it because it's
[1:19:11] your opportunity it's your chance let me
[1:19:14] tell you William Brandon Brad William
[1:19:15] Branham had his opportunity he ran his
[1:19:17] race but it's your turn
[1:19:20] brother Madam said that each generation
[1:19:22] has their opportunity at the fresh word
[1:19:25] of God it's our opportunity brother
[1:19:28] Branham said brother Burnham said in
[1:19:30] bless him prophet he said I look out
[1:19:32] there and I see all of my missed
[1:19:34] opportunities
[1:19:36] and you think my I missed my opportunity
[1:19:38] last Wednesday or last weekend let me
[1:19:40] tell you if William Bynum missed
[1:19:42] opportunities you're going to miss
[1:19:44] opportunities
[1:19:46] but the thing is is to learn from your
[1:19:49] mistakes think about this opportunity
[1:19:52] that you've been given right now
[1:19:54] you don't see it but there's another
[1:19:57] world in this room
[1:19:58] you don't see it but there's power that
[1:20:01] is moving through this room there's
[1:20:03] Deliverance moving through this woman
[1:20:07] there's a breakthrough in this room
[1:20:10] there's healing in this room
[1:20:13] there's relief
[1:20:15] in this room
[1:20:19] it's time you start letting off the
[1:20:20] pressure
[1:20:23] and you find yourself
[1:20:25] running to a rock that is higher than
[1:20:27] yourself
[1:20:28] you remember when William Branham and
[1:20:31] I'm closing
[1:20:34] but you remember when William Branham he
[1:20:36] he one time he goes to
[1:20:38] it goes to a spot
[1:20:40] in a psychiatric ward
[1:20:43] and he and he's he's working the room
[1:20:45] and he's and there's all those cases
[1:20:47] that are laying there
[1:20:48] and he he just simply saying to the
[1:20:51] brother that's with him he said where do
[1:20:53] we start at
[1:20:55] where do we start at all of these cases
[1:20:57] where do we start he said there was
[1:20:58] people sitting there in straight jackets
[1:21:00] and people that were beating their heads
[1:21:02] and all of these things he said where do
[1:21:04] we start at
[1:21:05] and there was a there was a little girl
[1:21:06] that was sitting there and said why
[1:21:08] don't you start with me
[1:21:12] and he said surely you're not a patient
[1:21:16] she said oh yes I am
[1:21:17] and she began to tell brother Brandon
[1:21:20] her story about where things went in her
[1:21:22] life and how she how she once was a good
[1:21:24] girl and how she how she once was raised
[1:21:26] right in all of these things but she got
[1:21:28] out with the wrong boy one time and it
[1:21:31] took her down a dark Road
[1:21:33] you got to watch your friends young
[1:21:35] people because if your friends aren't
[1:21:37] leading you to the lord they're not your
[1:21:39] friends
[1:21:41] if your friends aren't bringing you
[1:21:43] closer to an atmosphere like you feel
[1:21:44] tonight
[1:21:46] then you need to ditch your friends God
[1:21:48] will give you new ones
[1:21:52] you know that was one thing that I
[1:21:54] I wondered about when I when I gave my
[1:21:57] heart to the Lord how in the world am I
[1:21:58] going to get rid of them old friends let
[1:21:59] me tell you I didn't have no problem
[1:22:00] getting rid of them they got rid of me
[1:22:02] they didn't want to hear about the
[1:22:03] message they didn't want to hear about
[1:22:05] the gospel they wanted their own things
[1:22:07] I didn't have to worry about getting rid
[1:22:08] of them they got rid of me
[1:22:10] foreign
[1:22:12] she was raised in her right home did
[1:22:15] right things but she got around the
[1:22:17] wrong crowd one time you know brother
[1:22:19] Brandon said that's what happened to
[1:22:20] Legion
[1:22:21] he got out and he started playing cards
[1:22:23] with the wrong people
[1:22:25] had a nice family had had about three or
[1:22:28] four different children back home and
[1:22:30] the devil took him and put him in a cave
[1:22:33] chained him up there put him under
[1:22:35] chains of circumstance and every time
[1:22:36] he'd start to come back to his right
[1:22:38] mind
[1:22:39] he'd start beating himself again
[1:22:42] it's so easy
[1:22:44] to get under the enticements of the
[1:22:46] devil he's only wanting you to smoke one
[1:22:49] cigarette or take one drink or listen to
[1:22:50] the wrong piece of rock and roll one
[1:22:52] time and he's got you
[1:22:56] and then all of a sudden he's going to
[1:22:58] call and make you feel like you're not
[1:23:00] good enough as soon as you do it he's
[1:23:03] going to make you feel like you're not
[1:23:04] worthy enough for this gospel
[1:23:07] and this girl starts telling brother
[1:23:08] Branham her story of Where She Went she
[1:23:11] went from this house she she went to
[1:23:13] this Association she went to this church
[1:23:15] she went from she went from the
[1:23:17] Protestant church to the Catholic Church
[1:23:18] she went from here and went to there
[1:23:21] and I start to come to myself and
[1:23:23] finally I I ended up here
[1:23:25] I ended up in this condition
[1:23:27] I was a good girl
[1:23:30] let me tell you young people I grew up
[1:23:32] in one of the greatest homes that you
[1:23:34] ever could have been reared in
[1:23:38] but I still needed to meet the God of
[1:23:40] this Bible
[1:23:42] listen to The Prophet every day brother
[1:23:44] McGrady I listened to it I heard it
[1:23:46] every day it wasn't because my daddy
[1:23:48] didn't do the right things in front of
[1:23:49] me I was born a sinner and I was shaped
[1:23:52] in iniquity I came to this world
[1:23:54] speaking lies and I needed my own
[1:23:55] experience
[1:23:58] but something on the inside of me was
[1:24:01] crying for help and one day I found him
[1:24:05] walking on the streets I dropped and
[1:24:08] surrendered my life to the Lord and I
[1:24:10] never went back to that world no more
[1:24:19] it don't have to be in church but it's a
[1:24:21] fine place to get it it don't have to be
[1:24:23] necessarily around Believers but it's a
[1:24:25] fine place to get it I got it on the
[1:24:27] streets in Canada so if you can get it
[1:24:30] in the streets you can surely get in a
[1:24:31] church building you can surely find the
[1:24:34] god of Abraham right here tonight but
[1:24:36] God of Moses is in this room
[1:24:40] why don't you say start with me Lord
[1:24:43] start with me Lord
[1:24:47] and she began to pray
[1:24:49] she said why don't you pray while I go
[1:24:51] around to these other ones
[1:24:55] and you think well the Lord seems like
[1:24:57] he's dealing here and he starts working
[1:24:59] the room somewhere else and this girl is
[1:25:01] over there
[1:25:03] and she comes on brother Bynum comes
[1:25:04] back to her said
[1:25:06] he said now look she said I believe I'm
[1:25:09] going to go out there and I'm sure going
[1:25:10] to try he said no you've done that
[1:25:12] before
[1:25:15] a lot of times people get the idea of
[1:25:18] just going to the altar and that's good
[1:25:20] enough but you've been here before but
[1:25:22] it's time to go past that
[1:25:27] I'm a Believer in altar cause I'm a
[1:25:29] Believer in it but the experience of
[1:25:31] this altar has got to get you out of the
[1:25:33] chaos that you're in
[1:25:35] it's more than a preacher's hands it's
[1:25:37] more than a preacher's words but there
[1:25:40] is a power
[1:25:42] I believe that tonight that we're
[1:25:44] setting before the greatest power that
[1:25:46] there is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:50] and she'd been here before she'd been at
[1:25:53] this spot before she prayed through
[1:25:54] before and she tried before but it
[1:25:57] failed her
[1:25:59] but finally when she got down brother
[1:26:01] Brandon began to talk to her
[1:26:04] he began to talk to her
[1:26:06] I said don't you
[1:26:08] don't you ever want to be married
[1:26:10] she said what could I offer what could I
[1:26:13] offer to a husband
[1:26:15] he said you can offer your soul to Jesus
[1:26:16] Christ
[1:26:18] he said I love this
[1:26:21] he said he can take you back to your
[1:26:25] innocency
[1:26:27] he can take you back before you did the
[1:26:30] wrong
[1:26:31] he said he has the ability to take you
[1:26:33] back to your urgency he said the blood
[1:26:36] is sufficient
[1:26:39] this girl had tried everything else she
[1:26:42] looked at everything else she tried
[1:26:44] Religion she tried church but it didn't
[1:26:46] help her but what she needed was an
[1:26:49] experience
[1:26:51] and finally she got down there when
[1:26:54] Brethren prayed with her finally there
[1:26:57] came a breakthrough finally there came
[1:26:58] what she was asking for I want you to
[1:27:01] know that what you've been crying for is
[1:27:04] in the room
[1:27:06] what you've been asking for is in this
[1:27:09] room
[1:27:12] your breakthrough is in this room don't
[1:27:14] you limit God tonight but let's let the
[1:27:17] chains off
[1:27:18] take the limits off
[1:27:20] Focus your eyes to the word of God say
[1:27:23] God I'm here for you
[1:27:25] I know you're here for me I know you
[1:27:28] want my life I know you want my spirit I
[1:27:31] know you want my soul
[1:27:34] God
[1:27:36] start with me
[1:27:42] start with me
[1:27:46] won't you let God take you back to the
[1:27:48] place
[1:27:49] before you ever did wrong
[1:27:53] he said well I'm going to need I'm going
[1:27:55] to need some scripture for that I want
[1:27:57] to tell you that God knows how about how
[1:27:59] to roll back the time
[1:28:01] in your life when Hezekiah was in his
[1:28:04] condition
[1:28:06] and he began to cry out
[1:28:08] and begin to turn his face towards the
[1:28:10] wall and begin to plea before God
[1:28:12] and the prophet told him to prepare to
[1:28:14] die the prophet had to come back because
[1:28:16] of his prayer
[1:28:18] and Hezekiah asked for a son
[1:28:22] and God rolled back the Sundial upon his
[1:28:27] he turned back the time it's a sign to
[1:28:30] you young people before you ever got
[1:28:32] into trouble
[1:28:33] before you got into sickness Our God has
[1:28:36] the ability to restore and roll back the
[1:28:40] time
[1:28:41] you said well you don't know my story I
[1:28:43] don't need to know your story I know his
[1:28:46] story and his blood is sufficient his
[1:28:49] holy ghost has the ability to roll back
[1:28:51] scars and complexes and sickness and
[1:28:55] change
[1:28:56] the blood is more than April
[1:29:01] let the musicians come
[1:29:05] why don't you have your fresh chance at
[1:29:07] the word of God
[1:29:08] once you have your opportunity right now
[1:29:10] where you are why don't you say God
[1:29:13] I'm not leaving here
[1:29:15] the same way I came in here
[1:29:19] Lazarus was in a worse condition than
[1:29:21] any of you
[1:29:26] they're right here in bad condition
[1:29:29] I'll be honest I didn't walk in here
[1:29:31] tonight the first thing I seen was a
[1:29:32] bunch of corpses
[1:29:33] I didn't come to preach to the Living
[1:29:35] Dead tonight
[1:29:37] I didn't see no corpse here Lazarus was
[1:29:39] in a bad spot
[1:29:40] but his sister
[1:29:42] said these powerful words even now Lord
[1:29:47] even now
[1:29:49] you know what lazarus's name means
[1:29:52] without help
[1:29:56] without help from Jesus he wouldn't get
[1:29:58] it out of that tomb
[1:29:59] without help he wasn't coming out from
[1:30:01] where he was he was enjoying life where
[1:30:03] he was
[1:30:04] but because the helper was in the room
[1:30:07] you might be without help
[1:30:10] but our lord is here to meet your Ever
[1:30:13] Need

[1:37:19] what time I was
[1:37:21] I was at a meeting quite like this
[1:37:27] I was in a meeting quite like this and
[1:37:28] there was a young sister to come up to
[1:37:31] me
[1:37:33] she began to pour out her heart
[1:37:37] where some things were in her current
[1:37:39] life that she was in
[1:37:42] the spirit of the Lord Dropped In My
[1:37:44] Heart
[1:37:46] to say these words you've not lost your
[1:37:49] salvation sis you've just lost the joy
[1:37:51] of it
[1:37:54] and when I when I spoke those words
[1:37:56] sometimes you say things you don't even
[1:37:58] realize what you're saying
[1:37:59] when I spoke those words
[1:38:02] it had the ability to set her free
[1:38:05] she took off running and laughing in the
[1:38:07] spirit because she recognized she hadn't
[1:38:09] lost her salvation she just lost the joy
[1:38:11] of it
[1:38:12] and a lot of times this world has a way
[1:38:15] of crippling our faith to steal our joy

[1:47:44] what amen
[1:47:52] Joe enjoy the word tonight amen that was
[1:47:55] wonderful
[1:48:01] cry for help I was thinking when he
[1:48:04] we're sitting there preaching sometimes
[1:48:05] Satan's going to make you look like
[1:48:06] you've got something in your life that
[1:48:08] that God can't deal with that God can't
[1:48:11] touch
[1:48:12] you've just you've got that one thing
[1:48:14] God can do all things except whatever it
[1:48:17] is you have
[1:48:18] job thought that one time
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:21] Joe thought that that's what he's
[1:48:23] talking in the upper room last week was
[1:48:25] you know job said God you know all the
[1:48:28] flowers died the grass dies everything
[1:48:29] around me dies but it comes spring it
[1:48:32] comes back but when I die
[1:48:36] you know Joe thought what was me this is
[1:48:37] one thing that God can't do
[1:48:40] he can't deliver me he can't bring me
[1:48:42] back and I'm dying and brother Branham
[1:48:43] said I love it when he talked about that
[1:48:45] binoculars brother Andrew he said God
[1:48:48] gave him God's binoculars
[1:48:50] he said he looked he saw Calvary four
[1:48:53] thousand years ahead
[1:48:56] and where was job when he said I know he
[1:48:58] is God and he can do all things job was
[1:49:02] still an ash Heap
[1:49:03] job still had boils job had no more
[1:49:06] friends he still had no children he had
[1:49:09] no more possessions he still had a wife
[1:49:11] that doubted him
[1:49:13] he still had all that stuff but he said
[1:49:15] I know he is God he can do all things
[1:49:18] so no matter what your your situation is
[1:49:21] we've got about a hundred here so we've
[1:49:23] probably got 100 different situations
[1:49:25] he's still God
[1:49:28] you don't you might be in the middle of
[1:49:30] your ass sheep you might have just
[1:49:31] started your ass Heap you might be on it
[1:49:33] for a year like job
[1:49:36] but through that year God will still be
[1:49:37] God
[1:49:38] [Music]
[1:49:40] he'll never change what was God doing to
[1:49:42] job he was showing Satan how perfect he
[1:49:44] was
[1:49:46] so if you're going through a trial
[1:49:48] you're going through something in your
[1:49:49] life
[1:49:52] God might be proving something to
[1:49:53] somebody
[1:49:55] that when you come Victorious on their
[1:49:57] on the other side
[1:50:01] you'll know why God brought you through
