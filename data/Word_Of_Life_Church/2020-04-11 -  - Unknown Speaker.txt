abundant grace and mercy but I'm grateful that we in this day of abuse of grace that we understand grace does not mean that we can live in a way we want to and keep doing it over and over and over again and that's what grace is for that's not what grace is for grace is to help us in the time of need not to excuse us for a lack of new birth amen to be able to think of the essential love and projection of Almighty God kundan Singh from the great eternal into the form of the logos this type of glory can never be replicated yet the Lord Jesus prays that we would be able to share with his glory that glory was that which was given to the son from the father not of his essential being but of that which he endured as a mediator this great honor to become a son what an honor it is for us as sons and daughters today when we do that we are sharing of that glory which the Lord Jesus prayed Father I pray for them may this glory which I had with thee before the world began may they be able to endure it you may look at yourself to dance that what in the world have I ever done look how frail I am that's what you're looking at from the human side but God looks at you the way you really truly are we need understanding friends to help us to understand such a love that's right amen those of you that missed the service I'm telling you it was just absolutely tremendous or just used by the David I just saw appreciate it and we've got another service your Lane before us today and we're believing the same Lord Jesus has laid something on his heart for our needs today and then he has needs of course I know you do physical spiritual financial whatever they are but keep in mind that the greatest thing that hat can happen to us today in the service is to receive a revelation from the Lord that no matter what our need is that God is the sufficiency the provision to be able to help us with that need let's sing together Harry is the Lord we'll just open our hearts to his word and all the Lord Jesus in the simplistic way that he has of dealing with us as human beings liking himself to a bridegroom as we looked at it last night but the David bringing so beautifully of Hosea as him walking himself to a man likening himself to so many things well here the common term today used by so many this man was a self-made man he took himself and he done this and that neither but in reality the true and original and only self-made man was God because he made himself a man all of us were born and maybe we were given abilities and we had to struggle to make ourselves and raised ourselves out but really he's the only self-made man and he did that that he might transform us that was appreciate him with all your hearts thank God for His mercy sing something for say it's just hoping a horse that I agree she'll always be my soul [Music] was a slore there by my [Music] just [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] all of my fall [Music] raise the Lord aren't you glad he's not dependent on this flesh he looked beyond your mistakes or troubles or shortcomings he saw the predestinated seed that was living on the inside of you Psalms 102 verse 12 but to go to the scripture this morning Psalm 102 verse 12 what a great honor it is been to be here with you this weekend like to look again on being loosed from the house of your bondsman Psalms 102 verse 12 but Thou O Lord shall endure forever and thy remembrance unto all generations thou shall arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her now what she uses us first the time to favor her yay the set time is come so he tells us that he's going to arise because of his remembrance to all generations and he tells us the time to favor her the set time has come this morning I woke up and I was looking at this portion of the scripture and this keeps going over and over in my heart this week and for some time he's going to favor the dust he said for the time to favor her the set time has come this just that terminology the set time it's not the English word that we use Chronos which means chronological order after one comes two after two comes three after three comes four but it actually comes from the word Kairos which is actually referring to an event it's something that's been pre-planned there's an occasion that's going to take place as the tabernacle the Feast of the Tabernacles feasts of the wave sheaf so there's an event an occurrence not one two three Cana logical but actually a predestinated moment a pre-planned occasion he uses the same term ecology glory to God in Genesis 17 where elegan was going to visit Abraham and he said at the appointed season I will return it comes from the Greek word Kairos it's the same word used in Genesis 24 when Eliezer went to get Rebecca because it was evening time it was the set time that the virgins would go to the well and God had pre-planned a woman to meet a messenger where he's the Lord it's a predestinated moment or we say prophetic arrangement thou shall arise and have mercy upon Zion the time to favor her yay the set time has come for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof so the temple would be destroyed and David's prophetically saying that God's going to remember but he's not just going to remember the stones because they could tear down the stones they can tear down the courts but one thing they can't take away they can't take the dust away and God says I'm going to remember and favor that spot that dust so then the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory notice what he calls their going to fear the name of the Lord and the kings of the earth my glory when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory he shall regard the prayer or the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord for he had looked down from the height of his sanctuary and from heaven did the Lord behold the earth this is why to hear the groaning of the prisoner and to loose those that are appointed to death to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and praise in Jerusalem Gabriel's instructions of Daniel 1961 God never did deal with Israel till she come to her homeland you hear me thus saith the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the homeland the message of the hour comes back to the original a man I'd like to speak to you on that today I would like to look from this direction favoring the dust by the Lord has list his words you can be seated today it's quite a setting and we know that God has ordained for Zion to be a the place where God would set up the temple where God would set up the tabernacle it would be in God's provided place that he would ordain this specific spot for his children to be able to come and worship and out of all the places on the earth today we'll run the same parable from last night the parallel rather that God would actually choose this place that God would choose this spot out of all the places that he would create and put up on the face of the earth that God would choose this place of Zion it would be Palestine that God would choose out of all the places upon the earth today now Moses tells us in Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 11 he said then shall there be a place at which the Lord your God shall choose to call his name to dwell there so this isn't something that man has decided to be able to come to this place and to be able to set up this this place for God to be able to meet him at but actually this is God's provided place this is God's place that he has initially called for this as we would say for this this worship to be able to be restored this worship to be able to be set up and God did not leave this up to the agency of man that man would have the ability to choose a certain spot or choose a favorite place that they would like or what they think is a beautiful spot what they think is a great place but rather God chose this area and we know that God's choosing God's God's allotment as we would see no doubt that God can look across the earth there would be a lot of beautiful places that God could choose to be able to put this but God you know by the natural eyes we've we would think well God could have chose this land over here it's such a beautiful place or he could have chose this land over here there's more water that would come to this land or there's more grass that's more populated that the animals could be able to feed better and the cattle will MA they would grow and become so fat and then you know maybe would choose somewhere that would have a great big trees that would grow up from the earth but God did not choose at many of those places but God chose Israel and we know that God looked down upon Israel and that God was going to favor this land and so much that God had instructed Israel that when they would come into the land that God is going to allow the same parable with the people he's going to also run that to the land that when they would come into the land the first thing that God did my promise is he tells them this is what I want you to do when you come into this special place when you come into this ordained position the first thing that I want you to do is I want you to tear down every altar of these false gods the first thing I want you to do is I want you to take and tear down these groves and burn them up remember burning in the scriptures atop a judgment I want you to judge this false idolatry I want you to judge this false worship and I want you to tear down their altars so as God wants the people to be holy as God wants the people to be separated God wants the place that he has provided for worship he wants that location to be set apart as well now Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 3 you would tell them and you shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves was fire and you shall hear down the graven images of their God and destroy of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place so notice it was in that place where these other gods was going to be worshipped that God is not going to take and allow his people to be able to come into this land and he's not going to share this place with other gods I said he's not going to share this place with other gods if there was other gods that was in the provided place he wants you to dare tear down every altar every Idol that you may have he wants you to completely destroy because God ain't gonna share his worship with no other gods in this place he wants it to be set apart he wants it to be holy he wants it to be a consecrated place unto himself and God don't want you sharing his worship with nothing of this world nothing of laodicea nothing in this time he wants to have an exclusive rights to himself he don't want to share your praise with nothing else he don't want to share your praise with Hollywood he don't want to share your praise with football stars and baseball stars and rock and roll stars and country music stars he don't want to share his glory with nobody else when you come into the land tear down them all altars he tells them I want you to take and I want you to tear down the names of their gods in that place so he does not want their name even he don't want the mission of their name in the place where God's provided so he tells them tear down these pillars then take the Groves and destroy the Groves in other words this is the place where I'm gonna put my name this is the place where my presence is gonna dwell at and I'm not going to share it with nothing else now notice what he tells it in court in Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 10 he said but when you go over Jordan and you dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from your enemies round about so that usual in safety so when they come into this chosen place this provided place when they come into the position that God had ordained them to be able to come into he's going to favor them and by this favor a man he's going to give them rest from their enemies now notice they cannot have rest until every idolatry has been torn now cannot possess this kind of rest as long as the names of them other gods is in this place but when they are torn down he said I'm gonna give you rest from about your enemies so that you dwell in safety can you imagine this ain't a mere man saying this to thee but this is Jehovah God this is the creator of heaven and earth and he's letting them know I'm gonna give you rest from your enemies and when it comes to safety you can dwell in this provided place and safety you don't have to worry about a rogue enemy coming by and taking you out you're going to dwell in the land in safety so it may have taken them a while to be able to go through this land to be able to take in to tear these altars down it may have to come quite some time to be able to tear these images down but let me tell you they was going to eventually overcome and you are eventually going to overcome because God had already sent a time hey man he's already said a season an allocated time by his word that you are going to dwell in the land of safety hallelujah he's already gonna want it by Kairos by the appointed season you are going to overcome hallelujah then what's God gonna do he's gonna look down from the heart of his sanctuary and behold the deaths the wrath and you're gonna receive favor from the Lord rest from your enemies again he promised it in Joshua chapter 21 verse 44 and the Lord gave them rest roundabout so not only did he tell them they're gonna have rest but now he's bringing that promise to pass and he give them rest roundabout according that he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them because the Lord delivered them out all of their enemies hand so their failed not on any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel look at these next words all came to pass that already encouraged you this morning if God said it it will come to pass it may take a while it may take a few months it may take a few years but eventually because God has already made an oath by his spoken word that word will not fall short but it will come to pass just as not said it would do for all shall come to pass when God speaks his word his word will not fail when God honors his covenant hey man you can take God's Word and base your life upon it knowing that God's Word cannot tell us [Applause] notice it's in God's provided place remember it was going to be David that David was going to be anointed before the Lord remember how that the prophet Samuel had come down why David was yet in his adolescence and we would see how that Samuel would come down and all by the natural eye he would have chose another land to be able to be king by the natural ID program tells us there was some man that was bigger than the other but he began to look around but that wasn't God's provided person that wasn't God's choice that wasn't why God had ignored it but it was going to be David that was going to be anointed by the prophet Samuel Samuel is not moving by education he's not moving by the cydonia he's looking for God's provided person and you realize that David would have to find a million battles and how the David before he could take his throne that would have to be some overcoming in David before he could take his physician be able to take his spot but David of course at this time had not taken his physician as yet because David had some overcoming to do David had some Cochran to be able to do but then there come a season then there come a time like a rose but come a time when David any man was gonna put the enemy behind him and he was going to step into his position hoarding the second samuel 7 of 1 and it came to pass when the King sat in his house when the kings in his house and the Lord had given him rest around about from all of his enemies until the king came to his house David did not have no rest but jog over to God but just as soon as David came to his physician came to his place came to authority when David sat in his house the Lord gave David rest from his enemies I hope you follow me that the king said unto Nathan the prophet see now I dwell in the house of cedar the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains so after he comes to his place God favors him from his enemies and David when he sees this favor Dave his desire is I want to build a tabernacle for God to be able to dwell him so notice David wants a place after he comes to rest hallelujah he wants to be able to build God a permanent place to be able to dwell him now notice where David wants to build this app he wants to build it in this special lamp this is God's lamb this is the place that God shows favor to and David wants to build God a place to dwell in Jerusalem oh I'll just say this God would not let David build the temple because David had shed too much blood David according to the scripture he had shed blood but it was going to be after the shedding of the blood there's gonna come another officer Paul of the Sanna David and the seller David was going to build a place for God to be able to dwell and so because of the shedding of the blood God would have a tabernacle hallelujah to be able to dwell in after the shedding of the blood now God is specific and how he wants this there's no there's no wiggle room in this God tells him exactly the way he wants us to be not only did he want it to be built a certain way he wanted it to be built on a certain place but he tells him exactly how big that this Tabernacle should be he tells him how many rooms it's going to be what the size of the rooms is going to be how many courts is going to be in it and this temple is not something David designed this is what God designed and sent the word to David and then it was David's responsibility to taking it the word of Solomon hallelujah and once Solomon received David's word he built it according to the word of the Lord it would be a place set aside for God a place that God could put his name a place where they could worship think about this don't just put it anywhere put it in Zion put it in sign that's his ordained spot God is always showed favor to that spot God's always show favor to Zion it's a special place for God in so much that God loved Israel so much he would call the people by the name of the land that they was going to dwell in a clean spoon feed you this morning just had to hang on he was going to call his people by the name of the land that they was going to dwell in so you realized that that was the name they was going to be called by the name of their homeland the name of their inheritance hallelujah the name of God that he ordained them to be he was going to call his people by that name of that city it's God's ordained place it's God's predestinated place God ordained this place so much that it would be built in Zion that every Old Testament sankt would want to be buried in that special land come on I said they wanted to be buried in that particular place where God shows favor to that's where they want to be buried at that's where job was buried at that's where Jacob was very down that's where Sarah's buried that that was where we're at in the land of promise but why Palestine why in that particular place why not somewhere else that'd be more convenient to be able to bury the dead why not somewhere else why why would they go many times to the extreme to be buried in this land why is it that they would it seemed like it'd be so unconventional would be so much easier to do it a better way let's just be buried over here just be buried over there why do they want to come to this land notice the Jacob tells us in Genesis 47 29 and the time drew nigh and the time drew nigh that is from us diatom at Jacob and he called his son Joseph and said unto him him now I found grace in thy side now notice he's warning his son to look down upon hill hallelujah and he says if I found grace and the word grace means favor if you looked upon me and I found favor in your sight could I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and he'll kindly and true lose me bury me not I pray thee in Egypt but I'll allow with my father's and thou shalt carrying me out of Egypt and bury me in the burying place and he said I will do as thou has said so Joseph notice now Jacob tells Joseph I want you to make a covenant with me I want you to make me promise make me a no I don't want you to forget about this this ain't something I'm just gonna say because I'm in my own age or maybe I'm till there I want you to take either one I'm telling you I want you to give me an old give me a pledge that she won't bury me in Egypt in so much that Jacob I'll think about it he would tell his son give me your hand and put your hand on the hand put your hand in the space put your hand in the place where God touched me act I want you to put your hand in the same place where God made a covenant with me I want you to put your hand I want you to put it in the same place make a cabinet by putting your hand where the angel touch me hallelujah I want you to put your hand where God's hand was at and I want you to spit when you put your hand in that place where it pulls me to walk different it calls me to live but I was a blessed liver I was blessed because I lived I was blessed because that's a covenant with God put your hand put your hand over that spot right there that special place that special place where the Lord touched me that night and I want you to speak the word of Covenant over that place I want you to vow before God that when y'all come out don't you leave me here and you are going to come out and when you leave I want you to pack me along with you so there was going to be a group of people who is packing the bones of a dead prophet everywhere they went hallelujah notice besides this this him wanting to be able to to come out with him because he don't want to be married ten in Egypt Egypt is seeing he don't want to be buried in sin he wants to be buried where Abraham and Isaac oh my but why go through all of this what difference does it make why would you even want to do this while them bones mom what does it matter where them burn bones is buried act what does it matter is it dirt just dirt come on in old dirt just the same dirt no it's not there's some dirt she lifted dirt her son dirts predestinated dirt we don't preach replacement reap reach resurrection hallelujah we do not preach replacement we preach resurrection and there's some distant gods was a favor hallelujah and God's will is show favor upon death no now there was some beautiful places down in Egypt no now that boy had some tremendous cemeteries with a lot of decoration maybe there was nothing up there in Palestine at this time but I want to tell you that prophet didn't care about decorations he didn't care about natural things he wanted to be buried in the ordained place where God allocated his word two paintings dust disfavored dust I said it's a favorite place they wanted to be buried in the position where God would favor the dust Egypt was cursed the Land of Nod was cursed Babylon was cursed but not Palestine Palestine is the land of promise so God would show favor to those who's buried in the promised land God would show favor to those who's buried in the promised land now notice if you can't be buried in Egypt and have rest from your enemies and Jacob node if I'm buried down in Egypt I will not rest if I'm in Egypt I cannot be buried in that ground I must be buried in the right promise you'll notice if you're going to have rest from your enemies make sure home ah you are buried in the right place you cannot be buried underneath the Buddha and be in the right place come on you cannot get rest under Buddha you cannot get rest under Muhammad you cannot get rest under sistah there's only one place you can be buried to receive this rest Christ hallelujah you've got to be buried in Christ there ain't no rest and organizations there ain't no rest in the nomination there ain't no rest increase there ain't no rest anonymous only in the homeland the message of the aller can you receive rest notices from the church where em says Along Came Abraham for the promise of Sarah died he buried her right near job bought a parcel ground and buried her when Abraham died he slept my Sarah Abraham my god I think Isaac God he slept with Abraham I said but God Jacob Jacob died way down in Egypt but he said don't you bury me down here swear that you won't bury me here take my dust take my bones and bury them up there with my father why why that's not written brother it's in between the lines Joe somebody died something you put my bones here in this casket but don't you bury me here don't you bury me down here you take me up there and bury me in the promised land bury me up there I said God's going to visit someday and I'm leaving my bones here to represent something and I'm still banking from that same thing tonight what God told April save you and your seed I believe it in some day you're going to come out of here and they believed it in one day old Joseph's bones Moses started out and the Holy Spirit spoke to him and said you're forgetting something Moses now watch man forgot about them bones but the Lord would have a remembrance from generation to generation he would remember and he would look down from the hat of his sanctuary and he was the set town would come that he's going to favor the dust and God would not let Moses hallelujah forget the bones of this prophet Moses started out in the Holy Spirit smote him said you're forgetting something Moses go down and get them bones of Joseph Moses wrap them up and here he comes a pillar power leading him on to the promised land and he buried him by the side of Isaac and Jacob why they know there was coming the like know that was coming the firstfruits of them that slept they know they was coming the firstfruits that's the firstfruits it's those that comes up from the ground they know there was coming a resurrection one of these days for them days and they know that just one that job says I know not Redeemer liveth the last nations stand upon there and they know that job had an idea where he was going to stand so he said bury me here they wanted to be with Joseph were with Jove and they buried right around there in Palestine because that was the promised land they note the resurrection wasn't going to be in Egypt it wasn't going to be in Europe it wasn't going to be somewhere else it was going to be in Palestine so they buried them there because Palestine is the land of the Resurrection it's the land that the firstfruits which they would plucked the first one that come forth from the ground the first one from the crop they would take it and they would wave that one over the rest of the crop and when they would raise that one over the rest of the crop they wouldn't have to go out there and examine every every piece that come up out of the field they know God's law every sink fourth of its own kind they wouldn't have to go out and examine the rest of the crop but they would examine the first one hallelujah the first one came forth from the grave that's the one that would be exhibit and Jesus resurrected and he sprinkled his brother from the mercy seat took me what bring acceptance for you and I oh my the resurrection was it gonna happen down in Egypt it was only in the promise there is no resurrection anywhere else but where God puts his name at do you realize that's why God told Abraham to leave your father's house I want to bring you out I want to alert you have and lead you to a certain place in a certain land and that's where I want you to dwell that right there do you know why that's where God was gonna visit after it was in that land that Elohim would come down and speak to Abraham and Sarah now God had showed faith though they've got ain't no respecter of persons well he may not be but he is a respecter of his own life he is a respecter of his own seat and God showed favor to Abraham and Sarah and he told Abraham Abraham you're gonna be a father and his seed now watch he tells him your seed is gonna be like the dust but yet it would be numbered like the Stars notice he would tell him it's going to be like the stars do you realize that scientist tells us some of the very same things that is found on stars and on the moon and in the Sun is some of the very same elements that's found right here in this earth right so it ain't that there's such a difference between our dirt in that dirt but it's the position they're put in it's the position that they're called to come on you look up and nine you see them stars listen across the stars and you think oh my look how bright that is that's such a heavenly star and it's not so much that the dirt is so different it's the place where God put it at [Applause] hallelujah God tells Abraham I want you to have a son oh my and notice to a man that doesn't have one cent yet those are big words but watch he said and Sarah thy wife so he's not telling him just any land can produce this son not just any woman can produce this son but God is very specific on what parcel a ground hallelujah that he wants the promised son to be burned out of paint say no better than that I said God has a specific place as a specific location that he wants sons to birth sons out of and then why is he gonna come through nobody but God's allotted woman she's God's chosen place she was God's chosen vessel no now hey guards dust listen friend there ain't no different it was both dust but is that Sarah was put in a special place hallelujah as a matter of fact by the natural eye no doubt it will it look made sense by the natural thinking of man by the natural a man's - oh well you know you a Hagar's younger Sarah's older it seemed like that would make sense here's you want here is Hagar she's fertile but Sarah's ever had one son it would been a lot more convenient a lot more convenient to be able to bring it through Hagar but the problem was that's not the land that God chose she was not God's chosen place she was not God's elected place to be able to produce this promise she was not a covenant wife she was not included in the promise she was not included in the Covenant come on church she could not produce the blessing listen Hagar can have gifts she can have blessings but she cannot produce the spoken word of God so at a set time hallelujah and a crayons atop God's gonna favor Sarah now watch the way this favor works that God did not leave this to Abraham but God comes down himself God come down and picked up a handful of so he favors some dust and he creates a body and God oh mighty God stepped into that body of dust come on somebody notice what God was doing he was going to use a dust body hallelujah he's using dust to speak to dust he's using dust to favored us come on church he's using dust hallelujah he's using does elements out though are you hear me he uses preachers he uses it does to speak the promise of God's Word over Sarah and the Lord descended from heaven with a shout which is a message what's he gonna do what's he here for what's he's showing up now why would God come to this dried-up desert why would he come to a place that ain't hardly got any grass left or any water left because God's intending on visiting his children so he descends from heaven and he has a message with him listen to me this message ain't just for everybody but this message is for specific people it's for specific people so a lithium was not sent to bring the message to Sodom because Sodom cannot produce this message it's not God's chosen place come on church ala him did not pick up dust and go down to Egypt Egypt was not God's provided place but this message was sent to Abraham's tent it was sent to Abraham's family God was sent to the place where the promise was going to come out of and the promise wasn't gonna come out of them sodomites come on Church the promise ain't gonna be birthed out of the Egyptians not gonna be birthed out of the Canaanites hallelujah ain't gonna be birthed out of the hip-hop's for the air it's gonna come through Sarah it's gonna come to Deadland and he tells Abraham I will certainly return to the according to the time of life I will return unto thee according to the Queiroz and those Sarah thy wife shall have a son Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him and of course she hears what God says in her land her dust it laughs and God cast her aside said you ain't elect no more you're in the promised child Oh more you laugh at me I'll just kick you to the side come out he cannot just cast her away hallelujah said he cannot cast her away he cannot forget about her she's already included in the promise yes she laughed yes she made a mistake but she still held the promise that got over their life a mistaken town could not change the eternal word I know people think one of this divorce is gonna in me mistakes in time cannot change the eternal word what God is already populated by his word he cannot change his mind but he left it seems it's not one day you're gonna be or one day you're gonna because you already seeds are already cold you're already elected Jewesses 1814 and he said is there anything too hard for the Lord and at the time appointed at the time at the season at the hour at that predestinated moment at that occasion I'm gonna return unto thee according to the time of a life Sarah shall have a son there's an appointed occasion for this and allotted season to manifest this promise son I'm just going to tell you Ishmael was not Abraham son I said Ishmael was not Abraham son Ishmael was Abraham's son his smile Colonus abraham could not produce and Isaac as long it was in the ride an inground but when it got in the wrong way in the government of the right promised God had to change Abraham's name hallelujah and were god's name would dwell and that's where the promise was gonna come out of in the land where he puts his name in the land where he puts his name and the land where he shows favor that's where the promise is gonna come to about news for you that was Abraham son then tell me why God said Abraham take down son thine only son he favors he favors the dust he's always favored that land he's always favored Pacific places not something that man come up with not something that man manufactures but it's what God's promise has been allocated for a certain spot under there a certain purpose in a certain time right even when it didn't even make sense like this situation right here there's a woman named Rahab living in the walls of Jericho Jericho is a cursed City I said Jericho was a cursed City and she lived in Jericho a long time but let me say this she was not in her right position yet she did not have rest from her enemies but notice something started happening around Reds house a set time at a certain occasion begin to take place and her time to be loosed from the house of her bondsman the time to be set free come to receive favor she hadn't been around them canaanites long enough she'd been around those denominational walls long enough now it's time to favor her that's when God came her way notice what happened some spies come into this city and Joshua had signs Joshua had the same signs and Moses had the Holy Ghost right how didn't ask to see Joshua sign she just heard a top of the church the top of the true church that's been pulled away from prostitution you say I'm Methodist say I'm madness come on principal tarian the next day pulled away in prostitution but all of a sudden a little preacher enters a little preacher enters the city and said and said there's a God that lives there's a God that lived that yesterday he's the same today his powers just the same he does the same works that he did when he was here on earth his ancients plural his agents are on the road right had the harlot notes she was the harlot she was the top of the believer today no this is the real believer she didn't say now I hear Joshua can do science because he's the success from Moses I like to see those signs no if I could see those signs and I believe it will he didn't absolutely have to show those signs because she believed it anyhow come on she wasn't there and BC down in Egypt she went there in BC out in the wilderness she went there the Red Sea she wasn't there in that land she wasn't there when the Kings got destroyed but she hurt I said she hurt and when the right appropriate season ain't meant that the Word of God would fall upon the ears on this predestinated see that God living in Jericho her city that God planned to do something to this dust she said I heard what God's done for you I heard I destroyed the Kings I heard hi open up the Red Sea I've heard what God has done and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the and she told the whole notices and she says the smiles I'll hide you I hide you I hide this message but I'm gonna need a favor I'm gonna need you to show me favor I need favor look at this two preachers imparts a word of promise to Rahab that would keep her during the hour of judgment [Applause] now notice these spawns did not have to run back to Joshua and get permission to give her this Scarlet thread they didn't run back to the duster said can we give her a promise can we give her the word can we let her in on it can we let hurry on this one they didn't have to ask permission the word was his word that her promise was his promise dar boys was his voice their mouth was his mouth I was ambassadors that was ambassadors for Joshua and their word kept that church in the hour of the judgment if it was enough for Rahab living in a place of judgment living behind these walls come on church living in a nation that's forsaking God taking him out of our schools taking him out of our Court huh if they reject him what about today he says and I was with Moses she never seen God she never seen the works of God she just heard others had seen it and she believed by hearing it now she said I want favor for me and my father and my mother come on they're both old and crippled up I've got something it's some brother I want to have faith for them and the spies the preachers [Applause] played the tape and the spies the preacher said listen 130 listen at the message yes he's coming he's coming this way and we're going to take the land notice what they're telling her there's a promise that's coming there's fulfillment coming there's a season that's coming there's an hour that's going to take place get yourself ready [Applause] I'm gonna need something and they said here's a token this is what we want you to do with it we want you to hang it at your window put it on public display don't be ashamed of it no I hide it in the closet come on don't hide in the bedroom put it on public this way let your friends know about it let your family know about it that's the way I'll know about it don't be ashamed of this put it on this big display and when Joshua comes in he'll see that covenant and he'll favor the dust and they'll save you in your house sushi done exactly what the word told her to do and when Joshua come into the land Joshua went looking around those big old walls but Ram said he was looking for a battle plan on how to take these things down come on and all of a sudden he comes to a specific place in the wall he comes to a certain spot in the wall and there's a red ribbon hanging out of the window come on and when Joshua looks there's a man standing there and he's got his sword rolled and because she wasn't ashamed of this red token come out oh yeah just because she had a Facebook account she's still presented the token there ain't no confusion about what she believes even though she had against the ground she still presented the token her words were seasoned because of the token she handled it home she held on vacation everywhere she went she had this token she didn't want to be caught without it she didn't want to be found without it because there's coming the season that's coming to town that Jen's was gonna shock and the only way to escape that judgment you must possess the token [Applause] hallelujah he's standing there with a sword in his hand it ain't the day's the first Pole no more he laid the days of second pole no more he's got a sword in his hand hallelujah John Smith's coming to Jericho and God's gonna show favor during the hour of judgment it's gonna show favor because it's the promised land so here's a woman living in the promised land she's just out of her position without a token but once the token comes in hallelujah she comes to her place she comes to her position judgment cannot strike her home because God's gonna honor the word I said God's gonna honor the word God always shows favor to those that's in the right promised in the right land remember buttrum said whenever anytime that they would leave Israel he said that you is Baxley it's only when they're in the homeland can blessings come upon them remember our top of court in the scripture that when they Omi's husband left the homeland the blessings was left in the homeland right which is a type of a Jew being backslidden God because they left the land of promise and when he got outside the promise her husband dies right they had a boy come out and his name was sickly but he married a woman outside the promise outside the covenant of Israel come on but the promise he died ruse old husband died and she tells no I mean wherever you go I want to go she been hanging around Naomi long enough she got to hearing about this Jehovah God she got to hear about the ways of God and she said we're going to go him back into that special land hey man now notice because a ruse husband being dead she's free to go to the land of promise he wasn't just divorce he wasn't set aside for another occasion her own husband was dead dead completely dead and buried in that aside though Aram says I like this and gossamer by the way y'all hurry notice the top of the Jewish Church Ruth the top of the Gentile he said notice the Gentile Church here she comes back roots being a Gentile heathen worship her she looked back and she said I'll go with you where you live I'll live or you die I'll die we're your BAE we're your BAE we're your mate I'll be buried let's sure God be my god that's the Gentile Church accepting the salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord and the second chapter Ruth it reveals her time to return and she come back just in the harvest time barley season so she don't just come back under Paul's planting season she comes back notice now not under reformers she comes back deering at the harvest time she comes back at a set time into the right land of promise she's coming back during the hour of the harvest so she's coming back to the right land and when you get in the right land in the right place under the right season something's about to happen and the Bible said she went and came and cleaned in the field after the Reapers enter her half was a lot on a part of the field belonging to Boaz who was the kindred of MLA so she ends up in Moses field you talking about blessed you talking about the right season and the right time she all of a sudden because she God's gonna show favor because she comes back to the homeland she ends up in her kinsman redeemer field there's a lot of other fields you could have ended up in come on church I said there's a lot of other fields you could have ended up here but because God looked down from the heart of his sanctuary he favors the Death Star he brought her in to rot seizes the Racha under the right message under the rod Redeemer under the rock kitchen to do art by her back but him said it happened to be that Boaz was coming to check on the harvest so the kinsman redeemer descended to where she was at and when he sees her bertram said it was love at first sight and he says don't you leave this field don't you go over here and pluck some grain out of these other denominations you stay in my field you stay in my place you stay in this spot hey man you stay out of the rest of them fields stay out of them get out of them come on over you're safe here you can have rest here for he tells her in chapter 2 verse 9 let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go though after them have not I charged the young men that they shall not touch these she's found a place where she's safe from all the enemies that would want to do her harm because the word a bolas was over her the word of Boaz had said don't you touch her come on Noah's nothing could strike her without bonus giving permission first hallelujah he doesn't charge he doesn't give his word he done made his I'll study hearing you're safe here what did she do to earn this what did she do to merit this seriously what'd she do to do this deserve this she didn't do nothing she receives favor in the eyes of her kinsman redeemer and because God favored the dust she got redeemed God favors this land it's this land that God ordains to receive favor God wants it to be set up just right that's reasoning when Solomon sets up this temple God tells him exactly house to be done he's careful to build it exactly the way God told him to listen friends them stones wasn't just stones that was gonna be God's place to dwell at that rock wasn't just gonna be eating Rock that dirt wasn't just any dirt but when Solomon had everything in its place when he put everything in its rightful position when he lined up according to the word of the Lord notice the stones her stones had to be in her place and when the stones got in her place and the dust was in its right place the Lord descended down upon the tabernacle the Lord descended upon Ray had the Lord descended on earth and the Lord descended on the tabernacle first Kings eight and ten and it came to pass when the priests would come out the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priests could not stand to Minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord notice verse 13 I've surely built their house for dwelling in a settled place for thee to abide in forever and the king go listen and the King turn notice his face he turned his face and he blessed the congregation of Israel so God's presence his face would turn from the king and the Kings face shows favor the Kings face being turned means the people are a blessed people bertram says like this an indication of the lord descended down upon the place till it filled the entire temple the pillar flower came in there was such great glory of God to the ministers could not Minister any more because of the glory of the Lord glory of God that's when it found its final resting place that's when it found its final resting place for Sakana glory that followed those the capping stone not the corner the capping stone the main thing all the other stones is not effect until via notice every other stone did not come into effect until the end but when the capping stone comes every other stone comes to its place because God casts it but this main stone came in the headstone and it took its place positionally for it's resting place for that generation and the glory god fill the place where they were sitting there was a Chicana glory upon the whole building so when the headstone comes to its place it finds a resting place now watch it's God's ordained spot for that stone and then God sends his glory the rim says it like this let me close if the headstone come in Luther's time look what out-of-the-way place it would have been so God caps off Luther's message it's out of its way it's out of place look at me come in Wesley's time notice it's gone it'll come in its own it will come in its own predestinated time so god a lots a season for the cat stone to descend but the church will be honed in such a condition until the church's ministry the church's ministry will be so close he'll be just exactly another kind of ministry that Jesus had to make it all fit together for the them rocks less of this they don't hold on regard their rocks laying up there for hundreds of tons lying out there it's so close together without mortar they can even run a razor blade between them and when the head stone comes Christ comes to his it'll have to fit perfect like the rest of it then david says thou shall arise and have mercy on zion for the time to favor her yay the set time has come so there's a time and a season there's a people there's a land there's a message there's a cat stone there's a glory hallelujah it's all going to come together at the right time for thy service take pleasure in her and favor the dust thereof look what david says in verse 16 when the lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory we had when he builds up sign when he gets Luther's message Wesley message pinnacle when he sends the castle he gets every one of them lined up he's going to appear in his glory he'll regard the prayer the destitute not despised our prayer then this shall be written for the generation it heard the people which shall come by the spoken word shall praise the Lord for he looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the Lord behold the earth he looks down from the heights of his sanctuary he looks down upon this earth a little yeah and when he looks down from the height of his sanctuary notice he's looking to the right brother branham said which means that's where the thief on the cross that received favor he got favored he's looking for his bodies looking for his ride she receives favor because he looked out from the half of his sanctuary Psalms went over to verse 20 what's he looking for to hear the groaning of the prisoner to lose those that are appointed to death to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and this praise interest stand our feet Oh aren't you glad but REM tells us how the god when his picture got taken in the cloud he said he was looking to the right said we looked at that picture wrong and it took a messenger to show us exactly how to look at it and what eyes to look through but I want to say we've recognized who it is and it amazing that's why they condemned Jesus they said Jesus ain't nothing he's a man trying to make himself God you know how they missed it he was not a man trying to make himself God he was God that made himself a man and God conned in sinning and looked down upon man because that's where he wants to dwell at in his temple in his place he wants to dwell he wants to be the utmost part of every one of us and he don't want any other name upon us he don't want some denominational name over you he wants his name over you it was to be our husband he wants to be our Redeemer hey man he wants to make a love to his people because they belong to him he can't simply forget about her and cast her aside but he looked down and he undid the shackles from the neck of his people and he took off the shackles of denominationalism and he said now arise and sit arise and serum come up how that oh dust your favorite aren't you glad you are praise be to God think about it you're a favorite people today we've sit here for the last 45 minutes to an hour if you've heard the word these tops these shadows they mean something to you you know why the words got a resting-place and when the light of the word strikes a lot inside of you something begins to respond out of it because you know it's truth listen friends this ain't just something we preach about it's a good sermons good words this is who we are this is who we are it's not just playing Church those days is over we must recognize who we are and display this token publicly the set time has come the hour is here there's no more days to come make sure

hearts praise be to God praise be to God thank you Lord Jesus praise God thank you lord oh Jesus truly Lord you look beyond all the faults of this dust Laura we don't deny we was full of them our mortality Lord was a part of this world but there come a set time become a day Lord where he was going to favor this dust and at a certain season at a certain time it may not even been in a church it may have been somewhere somebody mentions a name or maybe you picked up a book somewhere or something happened we just think it's coincidence but it's favor it's an allotted moment because God's light was going to shine over that seat Oh God your puffit tells us in the rising the Sun it's like the great Eagle you noted had its eggs somewhere it note it had a seed somewhere but at the right time the Eagle would come looking and you found us you didn't just go looking for us but you found us you've changed this Lord from this world you've changed our thinking you've changed our mind Lord we can't

there but this one here found special favor in the eyes of God it's dust was chosen then in all the earth there was a spot called Eden which is a chosen spot out of all the earth then there was another chosen spot in the chosen spot called the Garden of Eden and God chose another spot and brought man out of the dust of the earth and then placed that man and the chosen of the chosen spot just

get sick and afflicted and have difficulties along the way but you came to this earth in a body of dust and you allowed that body of dust to be striped before you ever suffered the penalty for our sins you came to us and dust to heal our dust so you allowed your dust right so that we could be delivered Oh Lord God in the name of Jesus would you minister to the needs of your people today we know

hour we are the people of the book and we have returned to our place and the Word of God from there you will call the rapture Matthew 27 53 we know when that great resurrection took place and they

glad you're in your homeland that I could still go free let people ridicule us friends let them say whatever they want to you imagine Abraham when he paid that tremendous tremendous price for the field that day that had a cave on the other end and they laughed at him and they made fun of him and when you look at the documents that have been found many many years ago and called a uniform it was actually documents from the time during the time of Abraham and seen real estate exchanges of what value of property was worth he paid an exorbitant amount for this property it made no sense they laughed at him they ridiculed him but he had insight into that land there was a cave there of course and we know the name of the vicinity today was the Cave of Machpelah and it had two doors going into the cave one to go in I wanted to come out if we all live the natural course of human life we'll all find the door in but I want to find the door out and the out go is the resurrection praise God praise God you imagine they life they really kill they all got together the sons of else the Hittites and they made fun of Abraham and they laughed at him and they laughed in him but Abraham when he said praise God I didn't know where job was buried at but all of a sudden by vision I saw it in that land of the resurrection laugh at me really kill me call me what you want but one day you'll go looking for me and I'll be gone why I found the field of the Prophet place of the resurrect laugh at our young girls laugh and our sisters ridiculed and make fun all they while you won't - but one day when the bombs start falling I saw a video just yesterday where Russia has just now released a video a little bit of a fright thing of course for America but which they was able to shoot simultaneously for missiles coming out of the water it was absolutely breathtaking to watch it from this new submarine which they're able to load with nuclear warheads and I saw my how it must make the Pentagon and others tremble but it didn't make me tremble because I'm gonna be gold praise be to God I found my homeland it's in Christ Jesus god bless you you can law me in a prison it's just

many years ago could it be that you were brought to this place for such a time as this little would we have known when we were young children even when we become teenagers we started thinking of what we wanted to become in life and maybe my parents would ask us what do you want to be well I want to be a farmer I want to be a housewife I want to have a bakery I want to do this or that or the other how could we have ever known the Almighty chose us to sit with him at his throne for many of us the height of our goal would have been to be a businessman and maybe had the American dream or to been a lady and had a little bakery maybe somewhere and we made a nice living for us and her family what we're so glad that your plans go beyond ours or Jesus how we love you today thank you that we have found favor in your sight blessed Lord God may there not be a one of us missing at that day for we know the last and final display of favor will be all of a sudden a sweep will go moving across the earth praise be to God and all of a sudden dust will be changed praise God Thank You Lord our bodies will start changing in Africa in India in Europe in America in the islands all over the world a
