want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen how many want to see him amen tonight you believe that he can be seen you know actually that's what exactly what brother brandham said if you want to see him that means he wants to show himself to you amen so I just want to say Lord I want to see you I got eyes Lord right here but I've got spiritual eyes that I say Lord I want you to come and speak to my heart amen tonight God bless you amen uh greet you in the name of the Lord amen just want to say how much uh of a privilege it is again Amen to be here with you and I just have one uh motive and one objective and that's just to be an encouragement to you if I could uh be used in some way just to serve you in a way that could help you and encourage enourage you and strengthen you amen then I that that say Lord then that's just my purpose amen and so I just want to um want to say again thank you brother Donnie thank you for having me brother Joe all the brother Rob different Brothers um what a wonderful wonderful body to be a part of the family of Christ no family like it amen I feel right at home with Believers and so I just uh want to minister what the Lord laid upon my heart what I thought I was going to preach last night and then he went another way I trust that that you were blessed that the Holy Spirit spoke to you in some way amen and that you were encouraged amen by last night and so we just have something upon our heart you know I just want you to know I'm I'm I'm here for you you know when when anybody comes and you go preach somewhere and you're ministering somewhere you know I I I you could be pulled in all kinds of different directions and something I could preach and maybe something I even want to preach and I you know cuz a preacher wants to preach that's what he does I've got a card in my wall that says I'm an evangelist that's what God how God made me but you know I I also realize that I'm a servant of the Lord and I don't get to make my own decisions in fact I don't even get to preach what I want to preach but I I've learned that I've got to be obedient to the Lord and you you as young people here tonight as we said last night I'm sure all of you I don't know where you're at and what stage you're at in your life and uh at a at a group like this they would be all at different spots of our journey I I would be go as far as to say that there's those here that are lost don't know the Lord some here that do know the Lord that have maybe been Justified maybe going through sanctification never been sealed by the Holy Ghost some of you been born again been baptized with the Holy Ghost and you're on your journey to to maturity and in in Christ so it doesn't matter what stage you're at the holy spirit will speak to every single person here if you'd have an ear to listen say Lord come and use brother Matt get him out of the way amen and come and speak to my heart I believe the Lord Jesus can do that so I'm here for you amen here just to be used and let the Holy Spirit speak to you I'm going to minister to you tonight and I'm going to title this being changed being changed Romans chapter 7 if you have your Bible let's open up there and read a portion of scripture and then we'll have you be seated amen now I've got notes here before me but you know brother Bram said it this way you operate the gift that God puts in a man's life so I've watched myself preach a sermon before and think I'm going to go One Direction but actually because the pool of the people I went completely off of my notes off of my outline and ended up preaching not even really what I thought I had laid out because that's the gift that you have is to operate the gift that God puts in another man Jesus actually didn't see that little woman father brother Bram said didn't show him that you know the little woman with a blood issue and brother bham says that the father had shown him everything but that little woman he didn't show him and that's why he said who touched me virtue left me brother bham says what was it she had a need in her life to touched Jesus and she Drew out from God what she needed from God when she reached out by faith and touched the Hemm of His Garment now if a little woman could do that how many believers do we have here to say Lord I'm going to draw out what I need I'm going to pull on the word of God and draw what I need I believe the Lord can can do that Hallelujah Romans chapter 7 let's just begin reading here and I just want to begin reading at verse 14 very familiar scripture for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal so sold under sin now I want you to notice very carefully and if you got to be careful when you read this because the Apostle Paul is going to refer to me and he's going to call himself me this is written to him but he's going to divide the way that he answers that if you could just mute that just here for a moment actually actually that's fine that's actually the scripture brother thank you that's good we could read it from there he's going to divide the way he answers me of who he is let's look at it here let's read that again uh uh let's read here just uh read that verse 16 again uh verse 15 for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not or what I don't want to do I can s unto the law that it is good now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me how many can say me now are you any different than the Apostle Paul are you any more a human than he was a human I'll ask it this way are you any more Born Again than the Apostle Paul was born again no no and so notice the way he answers this for I know that in me parenthesis that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing my goodness you mean nothing nothing brother Matt nothing I have nothing inside of me I mean I thought I was pretty bad but I got something good inside of me well you do if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but in this flesh Paul says I have no good thing for to will oh what a quandry that I can identify with for to will is Pres isn't with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do how many have ever felt the way Paul just described now if I can do just one thing here tonight I've got a very simple uh uh uh burden upon my heart if I could help you understand you a little better because I believe that in understanding who we are that's where overcoming strength really comes from and so notice this here he says inside of me I want to do good I want to serve the Lord I I've got a desire how many would say I've got a desire to to only do with that which pleases the father how many would say that I only ever want to do what really inside of me brother man if I'd be honest I really ever want to please the Lord but that's not always the case that's right I've not found the secret notice Paul says this here and he says here I find the notice verse 21 I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me now how when just before you're born again no no no no evil is present with you at all times yes sir right evil is present with me for I I this here now he's going to speak about the spiritual man for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring here's a war here's the battle you don't think you're in a battle let me wake you up tonight you're in a real struggle here tonight brother notice Paul he says for I find that a law and my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God how many can thank god with Paul through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin if you have a need you just want to raise it and identify it amen to the Holy Spirit now as we bow our heads Lord Jesus we just ask you God to come in a special way Lord there's been so much preparation for this service these Services here this weekend I'm not even talking about Lord the physical things and the time and sacrifice that these young people have made some of the adults to prepare this and put this on Lord but I know there's mothers and fathers and there's a church that has asked you Lord God to move in a special way Lord we've prayed for these meetings now God I just ask one simple thing Lord help me just to get out of the way completely Lord I pray God that you would make make me sensitive to your spirit Lord if you'd want me to say something give me the courage to say it if you don't Lord then keep me from saying it oh God and I pray Lord for every person under the sound of my voice in this audience Lord may we just say right now holy spirit come and have Liberty in my life I pray God you'd Grant it to each and every single one of us in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated notice brother bham is going to get this questions and questions and answers and you can display that here and and he quotes this scripture I'll keep it on for a minute thank you brother he quotes this scripture here in Romans 7:14 again and he says we know that the law he's going to read this again uh that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under understand so here's this question that Paul that that that that here's this question this man has in the blue at the very end it's a very simple question this I cannot understand isn't it incredible after all of this everything that he could have asked brother brandom here was what was so upon his heart in other words I need help understanding this so you you what you're going to find is here in a minute is what the way brother brandham answers this is that there's more to you than what you see in the mirror there's more to you than what you've lived with all the days of your life there's more that that than what meets the eye that makes up Who You Are today listen how brother bandam answers this let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see he said in me is two persons you mean two people live inside of me am I schizophrenic brother Matt well in a way you really are you see brother bam said you're made up of body you're made up of spirit and you're made up of soul and in that body you have five senses you contact the natural world with but then in that Spirit here today I'm not talking about prior to being born again I'm talking about filled with the holy ghost from your head to your toes you've got a human spirit inside of you of memory and conscience and reasoning imagination affection all of these things make up who you are and all of your experiences in life the things that you go through the family that you're born into the kind of home that you grow up in not all of us grow up in the same type of home some of us here grow up in homes completely whole marriages a mom and dad not perfect by no means but a a marriage that where there's a union there but others grow up in broken homes with no dad uh no mother maybe that's you here tonight and you've grown up in a different circumstance than maybe what I did but notice all of your life experiences make up who you are all of your challenges all of the all of the struggles that you go through friends let me to say there are things that you will go through in your life that that I'll never have to go through but there's things in my life that I'll go through that you'll never have to go through the point is is that I can't walk down the road that God's called you to walk because God has anointed you in your life to meet the challenge of your of your life but God has called me in my life to meet the challenges and he's equipped me and he's equipped you for anything you go through in your life so there's more than just this then brother bandam says then down inside there's a soul and now that he would say it this way is the real you you mean this isn't the real me brother Matt this body that I look at in the mirror every single day and I comb my hair and I get dressed and and I try to look good and I try to keep you know this figure the the the looks that I have listen friends the prophet of God said this you've actually never seen each other that's right yes sir brother random says actually did you know we've never seen each other we've never seen what we really look like all we see is just this outward vessel this outward body brother bandam says but one day you'll see the real you you'll see the real each other friends I take courage in that because sometimes I look at this guy and this guy doesn't match this guy but I realize that down on the inside that's not really who I am who I am is a Believer I love the word I accept the word my Inside Man is the real me that's why the prophet of God said when you heard this message was Eagle food and you recognized it you heard from your theophany what was that that's the real you yes sir that's exactly Hallelujah notice this here brother bandam says this let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see he said in me is two people right one wants me to do he's going to say right wrong the other wants me to do right right right brother brandom you mean you had something inside of you that wanted you to do wrong every time I start to do right then the wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interviews this afternoon has run that same thing you you got an interview with the prophet of God and this is really what was on the hearts of people listen friends it wasn't some great mystery or some great you know ethereal thing or some great spiritual Revelation but what real people face is real people problems and what real people need is real people real answers from God that can answer real human battles this is what they were asking on the interviews has run the same thing this morning the same thing notice how can I take a Cocker bird this is the way brother brandom answers this and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it let me pull it up on mine so I don't have to follow there and he says he says how can I do it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cockabur has been transmitted from a cckar wheat a cockabur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cocko bur and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the Cocker and the life of the Cocker has been taken out but the nature on the nature of the Cocker you mean this doesn't go away let's let let's let him let's let him answer it the nature of the Cocker is still sticky that's right it's still prickly it's still thorny it it's still a Cocker on the outside the nature of it and it will be until you are born of the Holy Ghost on come on can you say Amen to the word it will be until you finally repent and God finally fills you with enough of the Holy Ghost and then your Cocker bar will no longer be sticky all right and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again so when will this when will it fully be developed when it comes out of the ground and raised up again what's he pointing to the resurrection you see friends what you've received is the earnest of the Holy Spirit what we have is a deposit a down payment something from Heaven that has came down to earth that's why you pull on the word of God that's why you believe the word of God listen you don't believe the message because of some good thing about yourself or because you studied it long enough or because you're anybody or better than anybody else there's one reason you're a Believer and that's because God put a seed Gene of God down inside of your soul so that you would recognize the word of the hour and you could say Amen to the word of the hour I don't say Amen because of anything good in me but there's an amener down on the inside of me I said there's a Believer down on the inside of me and I can't help but believe brother brand says notice this by the nature the nature of the Cocker is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed so brother bam says this here and and he no notice you notice this even from the scripture uh and in the Bible you notice the the the scripture makes it clear that there's two distinct life forces always at work if you could turn me up just a little bit on the monitor brother uh just a little bit there that'd be wonderful and so not notice this here the Bible makes it clear there's two distinct life forces let me just go ahead and cut to the chase if you thought you were a weirdo you are if you thought you was a little bit strange let me go ahead and just wake you up you are a little bit strange you're not normal you're not like everybody else in fact friends I'll go as far as to say if the world really knew really who you really are that think you was about as weird as you can get you tell some of think about it some of the things that bothered you some of the things that you struggle over and you repent over and say Lord I'm so sorry I made I'm so sorry I lost my temper Lord I I I'm so sorry I did that I shouldn't have said that God do you realize that to to those things that seem so large and so great and so massive to you to the world they look at that and go really really that's what's bothering you you're really stressed out over that just a little thing come on that that that's so small that's so ins significant and to them really it is insignificant you mean you're bothered over letting the Lord come on don't you as long as you love the Lord I mean God sees your heart he knows your life God does it doesn't matter if you drink a little bit you know a little social drink there I mean you're not getting drunk you're just drinking just a little bit you mean you don't even have a television in your home come on what what's wrong with a little bit you're going to hear cursing all day you mean you won't watch that movie do you realize that if you started telling I'm talking about real Believers here if you really started sharing some of your convictions and how you live they look at you and say man you are stressing over nothing you know what's different about them and about me is that God they can somehow get away with it but there's something inside of you that won't let you get away with it there's something inside of you that when you mess up God convicts your heart there's something inside of you that says you're not called to that you're not called to be like the rest of the world you're a believer of the word of the hour you're a believer in the message of the hour and you can't get away from it let me go ahead and tell you you can't get away from it yes sir you can run but you won't outrun God if there's a seed Gene of God down inside of you you will be miserable trying to fit in to a world you weren't made to fit in there nothing more miserable than a believer seion of God trying to fit in with the rest of the world you'll never do it God will never stop coming after you thank God for that kind of Grace notice this so he says there's two of me there's two distinct life forces down on the inside of me one wants me to do good the other wants me to do evil and brother bandam says it this way that there's even an angel do you realize this that even when you're born you're born with an angel a guardian angel over your life brother brandom answers this he ask it several times in in in the message you could go look this up and he quotes the scriptures the angels that behold my father's face and brother Madam says sure brother mam do you believe in angels absolutely there's an angel of God listen friends there's an angel over your life at all times that's right yes sir but just like there's an angel over your life there's a demon spirit that tries to anoint you and influence your life also brother Brandon would even say that there was a demon spirit that hung over his life that prevented him from giving his heart to the Lord long before he did that's right and he said a spirit hung over me notice it was a spirit trying to prevent him from coming to his identity now if a spirit would try to prevent a prophet from coming to his identity how much do you think a demon Spirit would try to anoint your life preventing you from seeing who you really are I'm going to preach on that just here for a moment you find brother brandham saying that over and over a dark Spirit hung over me he would go to prayer lines and he would he would call out and say sister I see a dark shadow hanging over your life it's amazing he always said it this way a dark shadow in another place he would call it a dark cloud something that we couldn't see but was very much real something that with our own eyes you say but the matter I don't see it that doesn't make it not real in fact those things are more real than what you see here and now yes sir that's exactly right listen faith brother brandom said faith is the six sense that six sense that a Believer has when he's born of the spirit of God calls those things that are not as though they are that's right that's the real faith of a Believer so it doesn't matter if you can't see it it's really real and there's a spirit that can come over your life that's always there you say brother Matt when are those two Spirits one trying to work the good one trying to work the evil they're there all the time right right sure they're there trying to prevent you from coming to a new birth that they're trying to bind you and afflict you with addictions and and and issues of your flesh they're trying to deceive you they're trying to destroy you they're trying to pervert your mind and Destroy uh distort your view of God I don't think we realize sometimes how real that other dimension really is but the prophet of God said it was a very real Dimension and so notice there's two Spirits always at work one Spirit an angel brother bandam says let me get back to that do you believe in an angel a guardian angel brother Brom says absolutely a a ministering Spirit or an Angelic spirit that would be there throughout your entire life listen friends that same angel that ministers to you is the same one who Woos on you and he calls on you and he pulls at you that tug that you feel is an angel from sent from God trying to pull you to surrender your life yes amen thank you Lord and at the same exact time while an angel's pulling this way another Angel a fallen angel a demon spirit is trying to put a dark cloud over your life to keep you from the identity of a son or daughter of God that you really are and so brother Randon would say that there's a spirit always there trying to trying to prevent him and he said there was a spirit that said Oh Come come on you got you got all your life you got all the time in the world you got plenty of time to get right with God that's the spirit that hung over brother bram's life that prevented him from coming to the New Birth before he did that's are you with me here tonight and so notice he says and as long as you're in this life let me find it here as long as you're in this life how many are still in this life as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside you you're born again sir you say brother Matt when am I going to be changed when is the struggle I'm preaching to you on being changed when is it going to finally end when am I finally going to be really changed well let me say this God changes you but it's not just important that you're changed but it's more important that you're changing you say when is it going to end when is this when is the struggle when am I finally going to be changed let me say it this way when you turn 18 for the second time it'll be over some of you that ain't 18 now don't worry one day you'll be about 18 19 years old and that life that you live now will be fully developed into the Life of Christ that's why Paul said said we know not what we shall be when he appears but we know this we shall be like him in his very image that's right but but meanwhile I've got this struggle brother B says when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you that's the thing so notice brother bandam types this and he says it's going to be in your life now watch the way he continues to answer this question somebody told me he once he's speaking of this Indian chief that brother Billy Paul lets through the prayer line and he and he's saying me sick me sick and brother brother Billy can't get it out of him he's sick and he goes through the prayer line brother Bon refers back to him and says somebody told me at one time he was converted he received the Holy Ghost and he said to him hey how you getting along and he said pretty good and pretty bad you know if you'd be honest and I asked you how you doing that's how you'd answer to how you doing pretty good pretty bad and he says and he said pretty good and pretty bad and he said 'well how do you mean pretty good and pretty bad he said well since me receive the Holy Ghost there's been two dogs in me and one of them a black dog and one of them a white dog and said they argue all the time yeah that's right they argue all the time said they growl and they fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good but the black dog wants me to do bad said well Chief which one of them wins the fight said that depends on which one Chief feeds the most that's right so I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God that does it oh no no no I got to have a more complicated answer than that it's just that simple which one do you feed will determine which one will win inside of you how many here want to be Overcomers how many here want to be Victors how many want victory over sin in your life in every aspect in area of life well which one are you feeding this man or this man it never ceases to amaze me that sometimes the very thing that we want free of is the very thing that we feed the most I said the very thing we want Fe free from do we realize sometimes that anxiety that we want so delivered from do we realize it's the things that we ingest inside of our spirit that sometimes feeds that depression how many of you here have Instagram go ahead and raise your hand it's all right it's all right don't be ashamed but don't lie whatever you do you got Instagram raise your hand it's all right see everybody everybody's raising their hand it's okay I got a question for you ask the same question back home how many of you have Tik Tock now I don't even know what that is but uh I know that it's an app I don't have it Tik Tok how many that's fine H how many of you have a smartphone let's get real honest here right now how many of you have a personal copy of the Seven Seals book Church age book it's good now let me ask you if the Instagram is called a feed and Facebook is called a feed do you realize that it's intentionally that way it's feeding you something then what do you think this does when you scroll through this sometimes what's it doing it's feeding you something one's feeding you one thing this one's feeding you another what you got to do is start out what's feeding the wrong thing and start feeding the right thing you want more of God feed more of God you want more of the power of God feed on the things that give it hallelujah it's amazing to me how much we don't realize the very thing that is giving us our anxiety is the very thing that we're feeding got a question how many times have you looked through insta you don't have to answer how many times if you scrolled through your feed and after you get done scrolling through your feed you felt stressed you felt worried you felt anxiety well I'm going to answer for you I guarantee you whether you realize it or not you go feeding I can just feed through Fox News and and and there will be fear upon me stress upon me anxiety and worry that wasn't there before and you feed on those kind of things and you get stressed and you get worried and you get bothered and you get anxiety of what you don't have what you could have what this person's doing do you realize friends it's a rat race and how many times do you feed on those things and then you say my I'm so depressed my I've got so much anxiety I've got so much worry and you don't realize the very thing that you want free of is the very thing you're feeding I got news for you I've never turned off a tape of the prophet and felt anxiety I've never turned off the tape of God's Prophet I never felt depressed I've never felt stressed I've never felt word clacked actually the opposite I felt encouraged I felt strengthened I felt picked up I felt like I can I'm going to make it I felt like greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world it's time to stop feeding the wrong things and start feeding the seed that God put on the inside of you can you give the Lord another hand clap of Praise he's worthy of that Hallelujah notice this in greatest battle ever fought he says a devil is almost harmless unless he can have something to work in he's got you remember those Devils that were cast out of Legion they had they wanted to do more mischievousness so they wanted to go into the Hogs so Devils must have something to work in somebody to work through all right Satan his power he's God is the perverted power of God everything Satan is got is power something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today sitting here and one or the other power is going to control us so let's cast out the evil one let's take our position like the stars of the heavens so notice this inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imagination conscience memory reason affections that's the thing that controls the soul uh so he says that's the thing that controls the soul so notice you say brother Matt what's he saying here in questions and answers let me pull it back up I lost it here for a second and he says inside of the body is of Soul it's controlled by imagination conscious memory that's the thing that controls the soul then what does that from the middle of the heart from the middle of the heart which is the soul from There Goes Forth feeding every channel you say how much access brother Matt I'm Bor Bor of the spirit of God been baptized with the Holy Ghost I want to know how much access does the devil have to me now all right as much as you give him I said as much as you give him why am I struggling why why why why is this bothering me why is this tripping me up why do I come back to the same spot over and over and over again how much access are you giving the devil no notice this he says from the middle of the Heart It Goes Forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that Channel with the true word of God then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts is the inside Satan's approach is from the inside a ha aha you mean Satan doesn't actually all the attacks that I feel in my flesh you know let me say what I said last night the devil realizes he can never get to your soul if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost yes sir so he say brother matth what does he move through memory conscience reasoning complexes bitterness sure on division right yes sir you give give Satan an inch he'll take a mile you say what access do does he have as much as you give him it's what's on the inside brother random says you got to clean out the channels notice this here so his approach is from the inside he attacks us from the inside here see it's what's cover covered over with you say well now here see what it's covered over with you say well now well these conscience and senses and so forth I don't have any anything to do with it brother brandom certainly it does you mean that matters you mean it's not just get the Holy Ghost just get get get get the Holy Ghost be born again I believe in all of that friends absolutely but let me tell you that's only when the battle really begins yes sir that's right and brother Adam says notice this here you feed every channel your memory conscience reasoning imagination that doesn't matter certainly it does does notice but if you let the word come in and cover it over with conscience then it can't grow you let the word in accept the word believe the word but then cover it over with a grudge cover it over with malice come on somebody covered over with jealousy you think these things don't affect us oh they do covered over with jealousy with anger oh it does that really doesn't matter I mean all that really matters brother matter is just that I'm born of the spirit of God whether I have a temper or not God doesn't really care about that oh really we can emphasize one and I've always found people will either emphasize one thing only to deemphasize another thing and brother bandom said that what is the gift what is the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know the Lord I'm just going to take just a moment here to to say this because the Lord just is so impressed it upon my heart even while I was driving up here and I've argued with the Lord asking him uh you know do Lord do you you really sure you want me to go to to say that and so I'm going to I'm just going to go here just a moment because I believe that one of the greatest quandries that the devil can have so much victory in people's lives is do I have the Holy Ghost any of y'all ever asked that question oh yeah am I sure brother bandham they would ask him over again brother bam I just I want to know I want to know you know let me just say this brother bham never emphasized uh brother bam never emphasized a gift to speak in tongues or a gift to shout or brother random would always stand in the middle of two sides yes sir and you always find that people will emphasize one thing only to deemphasize another thing yes sir they'll either deify the words of brother brandom or they'll deemphasize the words of brother Bon right in fact this is the exact battle that brother brandham stood in his entire Ministry always in between two ditches hello always in between two ditches and so he would always argue with the Pentecostals always always have to always have to hit at them about about majoring on speaking my tongues but brother Brandon would stand right in the middle of both you had the Baptist Triad confession intellectuals who brother random would say would have the fruits of the spirit that have the nature of Christ they'd be kind sweet loving affectionate but they they denied the spirit then brother V said then you had the Pentecostal over here on this side and he's just shouting dancing jumping screaming having a good old time but he's got a temper enough to fight a buzs saw you say well then which side was brother beram in the fruits of the spirit or the gifts of the Spirit both you see just because brother bham said that the fruits of the spirit are not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that the Holy Ghost won't produce the fruits of the spirit if we want to believe that then we've got to believe he did just let me get let me take it the other way just because brother brandham didn't believe that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that brother brandham didn't believe believe that the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues but people always want to Major on one thing emphasize one thing but deemphasize another you say well then which one do we need brother Matt you need all of it that's right amen I said you need every single bit of it and so brother Brandon would say this let me just answer this question what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost I was asked one time what I thought I don't have this about the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking was it speaking in tongues I said no can't see that he said neither do I said though I've been taught that and said what would you think would be an Evidence I said the most perfect evidence I could think of is love now even brother bramman himself notice how he said it the best evidence I could think of was love sounded good and he says and so we got to talking on that and then I thought huh that sounded pretty good so I just held that if a man's got love but one day yes one day in a vision brother bam says one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out on that and he said I'm just going to tell you what he said cuz really it doesn't matter what I say what you say what another person says all that really matters is what he he says and he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word that's right neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word that's exactly right thank you Lord now let me go further because I'm already here might as well preach as brother Andrew Glover says let me go a little bit further brother Brandon would say now neither one notice that let's read it again the evidence is accepting the word receiving the word notice and then he was saying to me that that's scriptural he said because in John 14:26 when he the Holy Ghost is coming to you he will reveal the things to to you that I've taught you and will show to you things to come so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost he's never told me anything wrong yet that is it the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it yes now many people brother brandham said here in this Pentecostal audience if I was to ask you how many here have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I guarantee you every single hand 99% of the hands would go up brother Ram says but I can show you by just quoting one scripture and ask you do you have this evidence in your life just one scripture if the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able to say Amen to every word of God I said every word not just the part you like not just the part brother Matt likes not just the part that I would emphasize or you would emphasize but all of the word of God brother bam says I'd ask you do you have the Holy Ghost if they if that be he said every hand go up he said now I can prove to you I could quote just one scripture and I guarantee you there wouldn't be two or three hands at the most would go up wow and you know the scripture he quotes those that sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city the prophet says how many of you lose sleep at night sighing and crying over the Abominations done for the lost and the dying that are in the world oh but I shouted I danced I jumped I scream oh but I I've got all the fruits over here but listen friends it's all of the word or it's none of the word yes sir and the prophet of God says notice this here but how about you that would really sigh and cry over the Abominations done in this city notice can we go a little bit further brother B says see it's covered over with you say well now you say well let me get something straight here you say brother the matter you preach it against fruits nope you preach it against the fruits of the spirit love absolutely not preaching against dancing and and and shouting absolutely not let me give you the way that brother brandham says that's just what a normal Christian does you say is that the evidence it's not the evidence it's just what a normal Christian does if you're a human being brother random says human beings don't go live in trees they don't jump out of trees thinking they could fly cuz that's not what human beings does human beings Works they have a wife they have a home he says that's what the normal human does then what does a normal believer do he shouts he can Rejoice he can speak in tongues he also loves he also forgives he also has the love and the nature of Christ that's right amen amen he has all of it good right notice it's covered over with you say well now well the conscious certainly does it'll be notice this brother random says but if you let the word come in and cover it over with conscience then it can't grow now listen as we take a turn here it'll be a deformed word did you ever see a good grain of corn planted in the ground and let a stick fall over it it'll grow crooked any Vine anything that grows up will because something has hindered it something has hindered it something has fallen upon a good grain something that it didn't ask for but brother Ram says in another place he talks about this I think it was a stock of corn and he said all of them were just growing up perfectly but this one it was it had grown crooked this thing had fallen over a branch had fallen over when it was young and growing and he says a branch had fallen over it and that Branch began to grow left and right and crooked and this way what had happened why didn't it grow up like the rest of the stalks because something had fallen upon it and deformed its life now I'm going to say here I'm just going to cut to the chase as I'm preaching to you and being changed friends let me just say this to you tonight it is wonderful that you you need to be changed let me say it this way thank you Lord the Holy Ghost ghost in your life will change everything in fact Paul said he that is in Christ is a new creation but let me say it this way the Holy Ghost doesn't change everything say how can you say that brother Matt well actually this morning I woke up and I had a headache had to go up to the store get me some Tylenol but brother Matt you got the Holy Ghost you mean it didn't change you no it didn't change me yet I'm being changed you say brother man how can you reconcile the two the Holy Ghost changes everything but when you're born of the spirit it doesn't change everything all right one day it's going to friends one day we'll receive the fullness of our inheritance of the adoption will be what to Wi the Redemption of this body but why while I'm here I've got a memory I've got conscience I've got imagination I've got affection I've got a human flesh that still gets tripped up I can still backslide you can still backslide in fact brother brandham said only a Christian can backslide you can still sin in fact brother Ram said only a Christian sins so then what is it brother Matt what is it is that it's important and vital you must be being changed I'm preaching to you a title being changed it is absolutely essential I know my thought's very simple but I'm just going to emphasize it here it is absolutely essential as a believer that you are continually being changed let me say it this way you cannot stop I don't care how good your experience was last month at Camp how good it was is going to be next month at Camp there's a battle still raging inside of you and you've got to say Lord I'm here again I need more of you God I need more of your life I need more of your spirit I need more of your word you can't stop you can't settle you've got to keep moving forward brother random says what happened this grain this this Branch fell over over and now a life that was going to grow up straight now because something that it didn't ask for had fallen upon it but do you know what the miracle is it was still alive amen that's right I said the miracle was that it was still alive through everything the devil has thrown at you in your life you ought to raise a hand and say God the miracle is I'm still here thank you Lord Satan you might have thrown everything you had at me but I want you to know tonight I still am here and I'm still going to fight I'm still going to press I'm still going to believe I'm still going to have faith you might have thrown the whole entire kitchen seek at me sa but I want to let you know I'm still a Believer I still got faith inside of my heart I'm still pressing the battle in spite of everything the devil threw my way the miracle is I'm still alive I've got a desire to serve the Lord I might not be perfect but I still say God I still want to be like you I want to be in your image Lord I might have got a lot of mistakes but there's still a desire inside of my heart to be changed brother bandam says notice this here sometimes we find people going through the prayer lines across the nation they just run up and think that the Lord ought to heal them right then but then notice there's something maybe down in there and we set before the Lord until he reveals he reveals that what it is there's something notice this there's a reason for everything wow I want you to understand young people there's a reason you are the way that you are in fact everything that you are brother Brandon would say there's a reason for everything and you've got to find the reason first and then you could find what to work on I found someone listen not excuse me in the interviews this morning I guess a person notice this here he says I I guess the person is still here in the building about speaking with tongues the person is a genuine person a real person and they've lived right and they've heard me say the evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't but I advise that person to ask God to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy because it's the nature ah you mean that a person can have a nature inside of them in so much that brother Brandon would say that I advise them to the to ask ask the Lord to let them speak in tongues let's go a little bit further he says the first thing I went to that person and found their birthplace and what sign they were born under and could tell what their birth was which way it set them in their natural nature sets them in a certain line you mean your birthplace has something to do with how you're made up absolutely yep you mean the home that you grew up in the house that you were raised in the kind of parents that you had the kind of father the kind of mother breeds into you the kind of nature that they had and so brother Randon makes it very simple he says then when they're born again they're over here in another nature and then when you find into this nature that's the inside and the inside conscience brother bam says it's been one of the most amazing things I I've noticed along the lines of Ministry for our Lord Jesus it's the peculiar ity of people and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch nature of people and the different parts of the Nations and worlds to where you go you'll notice there's a different attitude that people take toward Christ towards his service and towards his servants towards worship oh no brother bandham we're all the same everybody every body's the same well is that what brother bandam said come on somebody young people no we're all the same we all got to look the same we all got to act the same we all got to do the same things no because God said brother bandam said God's a god of variety and he makes everybody different and that's okay I'm not like you and you're not like me and I don't want to be you and you don't want to be me I'll say it the way brother Bram said it be who God made you to be you don't have to be anybody else other than who God made you to be and we're all different come on can I get an amen here tonight we're all different God's a god of variety he didn't make us all the same in fact our churches aren't all the same not all preachers are the same I wish I could be Donnie Reagan I promise but I'm not you say brother Matt then what are you going to do I got to be brother Matt that's right and brother Don's got try to be brother Donnie and if I try to go being brother Donnie brother bam said this way the wheels will fall off I guarantee you they would so you say brother manthan who do you got to be you got to be who God made you to be because God made you a particular way for a particular purpose for a particular life because you'll contact people I can't contact you'll reach people that I can't contact my experience will be totally different than yours but you've got to be who God God made you to be brother R says I've noticed the peculiarity people receive it differently he says he says and one thing it's been one type of meeting will just be wonderful in one part of the country where it won't work I love his honesty in the other part of the country so notice this here it was a peculiarity something that was different about everybody now listen friends I'm preaching to you here tonight I'm being changed because in inside of you is a memory a conscience imagin ation affection and you have the ability within the channels of your spirit to ingest things let me say this Co killed a lot of people you may have be here tonight and may say Co didn't even affect me didn't even hurt me man I barely got sick I got a flu that was worse than that I'm going to tell you it killed a lot of people and there's some people that it never even affected but I tell you what affected most everybody is actually the spirit of fear that people ingested from covid did more damage for a lot of people than the actual disease itself you say what is that because people can ingest fear and you have the ability to ingest things inside of your spirit that prevent you or hinder you in your walk with the Lord Jesus sir you can ingest a complex and not even realize it you can ingest a fear and not even realize that you have a fear over something and that fear has so great made a stronghold in your life listen friends we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness in high places what is that that's other atmospheres and I want to tell you here tonight that there's a spirit in this world that you don't want to ingest inside of your spirit it's a spirit of hatred and Malice and jealousy and envy and destruction that's the only way that you can make sense to what's happened in our world today how could a world turn their back so much against a little bitty Nation small minuscule nation of Israel you say how could it how could it happen brother Matt I'll tell you how because a six seal Spirit pre-tribulation s Spirit from the six Seal have people have literally ingested a destruction Spirit upon them and they don't even realize it that's right that's the truth and there's hatred and there's malice and there's jealousy and there's envy and there's fighting and toxicity amongst people and divisions and divides and this group over here with that group over here and this click over here and this click over here friends it ought to not be in the family of God it ought to not be in the body of Christ it ought to not be we have clicks and and groups and groupies over here what happened to The Sovereign body or we're all brothers and we're all sisters and we're all fighting for each [Applause] other you need each other more now than you've ever needed each other before it's a spirit of destruction brother B I just hearing him say that before God could destroy the world people would have to get into the spirit of destruction first and so it's a spirit that comes to to bind you to afflict you as we preached on last night and you can have a chain upon your life and not even realize serving God I serve the Lord I love the Lord I'm born of the spirit of God I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not realize that in your memory and your conscience and your reasoning and your affection there's a dark shadow or a dark spirit that hangs over you because you've ingested something that you need to clean out tonight prophet of God would say that's what's wrong with so many blowed up Christians they don't clean out the channels memory conscience reasoning imagination affection they don't clean out the channels and they go years and years and years get married have a wife have a husband young couple gets married the problem is is that inside of his channels he's ingested a complex from his father and then he takes that complex into marriage and then it exact masturbates and gets worse and then for 10 years 15 years maybe and then if he never cleans that out pressure will start to build and pressure will start to build because we live in a pressurized world and then before you know it suddenly poof and you say what happened how did that person end up that way they're a blowed up Christian they've taken something inside of their spirit and they don't even realize it much like this Daughter of Zion in in Isaiah chapter 52 notice this here awake this is Isaiah 521 awake awake put on your strength oh Zion put on your beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no longer come to you shake yourself from the dust of arise I want you to notice this portrait of this Daughter of Zion as the Bible says she was laid on the ground chained about a chain about her neck this wasn't a daughter of Jezebel this was a Daughter of Zion and the Bible says she's laying on the ground Isaiah 52:1 brother if you got it you can put it up and God begins to speak and says Shake yourself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem notice this go further loose yourself from the bonds of your neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus saith the Lord you have solded yourself for nothing in other words God didn't save you for you to be bound God didn't save you for you to be chained by some complex or some fear or some Grudge or some hate hateful spirit that you've ingested from the world that you live in he says loose yourself Isaiah 52 and he says you have he says loose yourself Shake Yourself arise and sit down loose yourself from the bonds of your neck oh captive Daughter of Zion Isaiah 52 I see you trying to find it brother verse 1 through verse3 you have sold yourself for nothing and you have you shall be redeemed without money now revealed here is to Isaiah is literally what Israel had become bound Afflicted in bondage in Chains God never envisioned this for her you say how did you end up here oh Daughter of Zion God had made you to be pure and undefiled free not just in your soul but free in your body free in your spirit free in your flesh freeing your nature I'm preaching you on being changed what is God wanting to do he's wanting to change you so that he can free you of every fear of every struggle of every complex and God saying to you tonight I don't want you to make an excuse for any part of your carnal nature to say well that's just the way I am that's just the way I was born I'm just going to deal with that the rest of my life how did you end up here Daughter of Zion on the ground bound captive the Bible says that she was this Daughter of Zion once pure once a beautiful woman who gave birth to Sons but now she's laying bound like a slave she wasn't a slave but she was acting like a slave you see you cannot be a slave but the devil will make you act like like he's got you held and he's got you bound she was clutching at the neck abused uncircumcised and the uncleaned came unto her now her garments were torn filthy dirty tattered what a portrait what a picture of a Believer who's been born again has came to a real New Birth sealed by the Holy Ghost but they've allowed the channels of their mind to become so infected and now they're bound and fearful anxiety depressed worried stressed her enemies stand by mocking and blaspheming God taunting her notice here in Isaiah 51 verse Verse 18 notice this here she felt like no one cared about her you know that's a real spirit that the devil can put upon a young person no one cares no one sees me no one sees the struggle that I'm going through no one sees the bondage that I have no one's going to come from me no one's going to help me no one's going to pick me up and now she's laying there grasping at this neck grasping at this chain grasping clutching she's laying there in disgrace ramled by the enemy trampled by the enemy who walks over her one I want you just to I feel the Holy Spirit right now so just pay attention real close once the Lord she was a clean vessel one who the Lord used clean pure holy undefiled unadulterated once a vessel for the Lord Jesus but now pitiful in slavery helpless and she's fallen into a stuper she doesn't know how to get out she's trapped she knows she's been listen friend you know that you're born of the spirit of God you know you love the Lord Jesus with all of your heart you know that you want to make Heaven your home you know that you know all of these things inside of you but there's a struggle something real that you say I I want free of this I just can't get over it brother Matt I've struggled with it I fought over it I've battled over it in my life and she's laying there defenseless you know what the tragedy of all of this is is that she had sold herself the devil can't purchase what God has already bought but you can sell yourself and you'll sell yourself to a lie you'll sell yourself to a fear you'll sell yourself to a to a to to to a complex she had sold herself listen you have sold yourself for not you sold yourself in other words for nothing for nothing and listen to what the Lord Jesus begins to say as the father comes to her look at it verse one Isaiah 52 awake awake wake up it's like it's like a father shaking wake up wake up you're in a stuper you've forgotten who you were you forgotten what what army you're part of you forgot you've been purchased you forgot you've been bought you forgot you're a son you forgot you're a daughter wake up put on your strength this is the words of a Kind Heavenly Father put on your strength oh Zion put on your beautiful garments notice there's no rebuke there's no condemnation there's no a rraw or withdra draw of his contract or his love he's not going to abandon her a lot of people might abandon you but let me go ahead and tell you the Lord will never abandon you a lot of people will walk away from you but the Lord Jesus will never walk away from you and he says notice no abandonment no withdrawal no recoiling from the Lord but love and mercy listen friends God never forgets you in your moment of greatest weakness and your moments of moment of greatest Affliction the Lord hath never forsaken you God has never walked away from you as we preached last night I don't care how alone you feel tonight God has never forsaken you can a woman forget her suckling child that she should have compassion on the child of her womb yay yay that woman might forget the Lord says but I will not forget you behold I have Graven you on the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me this is Isaiah 49:16 how alone sometimes we can feel even when we feel so distant from the Lord because we feel we failed the Lord and if Satan can do anything I'm just obeying the Holy Spirit here friends if Satan can do anything he'll try to isolate you that's and if he can use guilt to isolate you from the Lord he'll use guilt he'll use fear and condemnation you've send your day of Grace away God doesn't love you nobody loves you nobody wants you you're worthless but God says can a mother for forget yes she might but I'll never forget thy woes are continually for me in other words I'm joined to you I'm literally joined to you in your captivity this word is sha it means to be joined to a wall it's literally a brick mason what a brick mason does when he lays a brick and he lays mortar and he lays another brick and another brick and another brick this is the word God is using in other words you might be in a prison and you might be bound in captivity but I want you to know I'm in your walls of prison with you I've never left you I've never forgot you I've never forsaken you in other words your walls are my walls let me give you a new testament language he's a high priest who can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and notice this here she had became so bound she had became so locked up brother random deals with this in in in the message you can go back brother that'd be wonderful 20th century Prophet you can you can read this and actually watch it he says excuse me sister have to relax my mind once in a while now we'll be strangers I see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're from away from here you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart notice you've got a lot of trouble on your heart to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of Blackness there he goes there's a whole lot of Blackness I see a black sheet keep following you like that yeah oh oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and that was a man professing Divine Healing you could hear it in the tape as brother brandom goes to this discernment and she starts to weep as he says that he says oh there's a black sheep following you now listen the sister couldn't see it she had no idea in fact all she had was the physical man manifestation of a heart trouble inside of her flesh and brother Ram says oh it's a lie and he says then it was a man professing Divine Healing he said you was a witch yes is that true and you got a whole stir in your church or something another about it isn't that right your pastor's sick right now has got polio is that right yes sir sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're a liying the only thing wrong with you is your heart that is nervous in a nervous condition got your heart worked up go on home in peace and God bless you you're all right God bless you you're not a witch Hallelujah wasn't it amazing something that she had ingested and she didn't even realize it a lie that she had accepted from somebody else had so bound this sister and she had a black sheep following her and it was a lie that she had ingested you say brother Matt what was it you know what I love so much about this quote is brother random didn't perform any kind of magic he didn't speak some kind of spell over her all he did was identify a demon Spirit of a lie and she was free of it you say brother Matt what do I need to get free let the Holy Ghost say God Shine Your Light down inside of my soul and expose the devil's lies in my life you're not a [Applause] witch and strangely I went to a place where I made an odd turn instead of turning there I went up to make a turn the lights flashed on a lovely couple outside two fine young ladies that I had just married to fine young ministers Satan after he seen the minister one of them in his ministry begin to be he says being said and he took a life's companion right there at this altar they went away happily on their honeymoon and the enemy jumped in on jumped on to this young man and I'm saying this to express what I'm saying does he care somehow with faith that would not take no they turned and returned back here knowing after they was all the way over way in the East here somewhere on their honeymoon returned back and was sitting waiting and I walked in fine handsome young man his wife sitting on the outside crying her and their little companion the other man the other brother come running which is a friend of this young man saying oh brother brandham such and such a thing has happened went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life a leader of young men sitting there and Satan had bound him he never noticed but I took my hand left to shake with his right to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of f sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting upon the Lord the anointing of the Holy Spirit was there and that's why it led us and then seeing this Shadow Of Darkness over him I never said what I was doing but in the less than a couple moments time it was all gone the coldness of his hand had left he was shouting and praising God a few minutes to find himself a few minutes to find himself and here they sat this morning sitting in the audience see how Satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him of some complex you mean brother brandham he was bound you didn't lead him to an altar and tell him he need to be born again no no that's not what he needs that might be what you need here tonight but that might not be what you need you mean brother bandam you didn't just have him repent over it no no actually what brother bham did is he started going back into his life and he started W Discerning this in his life and he looked all the way back now it doesn't tell us what he does but he tells us this he says Satan was trying to refer to him of some complex to be built back you mean the devil will try to rebuild something that God has delivered you from oh yeah he'll try to rebuild Jericho after the walls have already fallen I got a news for the devil tonight I'm not going to let you rebuild anything God has broken down in my life I'm not going to allow a complex a fear if God has Set Me Free Satan you don't have any place in my heart and I seen it by a vision of the Lord but God cared for that man God cared for that young boy imagine clutching bound like this Daughter of Zion by a black cloud just coming in a few moments ago a lady I seen her sitting here in the with no just got a seat some way and sat down she said n Years brother Brandon I tried to get a hold of you and she said I'm so desperate oh I read these words this afternoon and I wonder if there'd be a young person here tonight that could resonate with this woman I'm so desperate brother brandom I'm so desperate nine years I've tried to get a hold of you I'm here late and couldn't even get a prayer card to be in the line the lady moved back she said brother brandom just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman see that her heart was burdened and she was trying to work to make a living and a great thing happened way back in the time of her parents wow you mean something that had nothing yeah to do with her something way back in the time of her parents that had caused this great thing to happen to her and the Lord Jesus revealed it and showed what it was and there in a moment's time took it from the woman wow she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience friends I want you to notice something she had lived with this Dark Cloud for 9 years but one moment under the presence of the Lord changed everything in her life I say tonight you might have struggled for the last two years in your life but one moment with one word of God you say what brother mat for the Holy Ghost to expose the devil in your life I say exposing Holy Ghost expose the devil in my life she was free you say brother mat but she was free by the Holy Ghost she was born of the spirit of right that's right but you see you can be raised up to life again like Lazarus was but still Bound By Your Grave clothes brother Ram says she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience with us rejoicing with tears as she's wiping her eyes now knowing that the truth of the thing was made known and what that little poor neurotic woman that was so nervous and she didn't know what to do with herself thinking that she was gone and there was no Holy Spirit and this is her last day she had tried for n years and she was about at the end of Despair God cared for that little woman who know one cares for what a time he does care when he was here on Earth I say he cared for the people so much till he healed their sick comforted their hearts told them a place that where he would go and prepare for them he would come again to receive them unto himself he cared for them and notice he cared so much until he knowed when he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I will send the Holy Spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's no one cares like Jesus brother bam comes to this message and I'm going to close here give me just a few minutes can I have just a couple he comes to this boy and he's brother ROM deals with this young man and he's he's going to get married he's likes a girl brother V says he couldn't he he he he he he couldn't get over this whatever it was in his life this Grudge or the anger brother B doesn't actually tell us what it was but he says a few instance for instance a few days ago I was caught on a scene of a little something going on fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl as much had promised to do a certain thing and didn't do it didn't really know what it was and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't in him to do it and the father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire to know what's wrong with with her boy now it's not easy to do sometimes but you must be truthful and be honest therefore the boy was a Christian as far as a Believer notice how he divides this he had repented and had been baptized and had a position among the Believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had and the father and mother notice you were you thinking let's read it you thinking you having it and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you hav't and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run Sensations speak in tongues or shouting whatever you might lay upon it which is all right I believe in all of that but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it cuz the fruit of the spirit I goes to the Fruit of the Spirit vind Ates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells you what it is Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them now this young fellow's parents his mother's German no reflection on the German but there's a strain in that family that is they'll just sit I preach to a lot of people like this and you can talk to them they'll just stare at you right in the face they got this girl sister the mother this boy her sister I've come down on the street many a morning this young lady be sitting the yard I'd say good morning to you she'd just look at me I'd stop and I'd say sure a fine morning she'd stand look right at you an intelligent woman and I'd say come up to see us sometimes she'd just stand and look well her brothers are that way father and mother is that way now the father so he points to the mom now let's go to the dad now the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman Moody high-tempered High strung is brother bram's family that is that's his whole family's like that except one or the other out of the family converted now in this boy in in this boy inside of this boy this father and mother both Christians filled with the Holy Ghost they have brought this young man up the way of the Lord and now the young man is about 17 18 years old something along there veryify kid he's been a real model boy at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girl the mother's family lives close to the Fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no they just know it's right but it just it's not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning then I guess brother Brandon that's okay he's all right just leave that there uh-uh they just won't do it it's not in them now the genes in this father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the the flesh that's been inbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where the boy stands now I said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up said I look at you out of your look at you look at you out of your family all of them drunks fighting shooting cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there won't speak very independent so forth they're reverent to religion but I said it's not you you're the only one out of all of your sisters and brothers and you're sweet kind forgiving what does that and your tree part of the family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your your people anymore it's your Christ that lives inside of you I went said to the boy look at your family practice all of them are drunk so forth I said how Moody High tempered High strong strong but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you're no more what you are it's Christ in you I said now that same thing has to happen to your son father raised up said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus water Baptist The Bu said I know my son has come to Christ I said that may be all right the outward motions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he's regenerated born again I'd advise that man never that I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her her that's right until that gentle oh Lord sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in I read these words and I raise up my hand and say let that gentle sweet loving forgiving kind Holy Spirit that'll be a paradox itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then amen it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God could you bow your heads with me every head bowed every eye closed there's she laid musicians could you come laying in the dirt what are you doing there God didn't save you Daughter of Zion for you to lay there graveling enslaved in the dirt listen the message of God here tonight it's very simple it hasn't been rebuked it's not a rebuke it's not a it's not a chastisement it's a simple word from your heavenly father child awake awake put on your strength wake up you've got it down inside of you you say brother Matt what does this woman have to do what does the daughter of Zion have to do she must Shake herself she must cast off her chains you say brother Matt you mean no one's going to come and pick her up no no one's coming you mean no one's going to come and unlock that chain no friend you see the power of the of the chain the key was in her hands I said the power to unlock the bondage that she was under was already within her and God says wake up put on your strength put on your beautiful garments because if you don't you'll die there if you don't you'll perish there gring in the dirt but you don't have to child you don't have to stay there another minute in that addiction you don't have to stay there another second in that complex you don't have to stay there another Moment One Moment in the presence of God can change everything I wonder how many here would just buy your heads with me would just raise a hand to the Lord and say God I want to be changed tonight I want to be changed Lord Jesus I've been maybe you could say here tonight I've I've received the Holy Ghost I know that I have I'm born of the spirit of God but tonight I just want to say Lord Jesus I want to be freed out of every channel inside of my spirit my fa my my memory my conscience oh hands going up everywhere some people standing I'd invite you to do the same thing as you raise your hand stand to your feet and say God I want free of every chain that the devil has put upon my life I want to be changed from this moment on wonder if they could play something softly just music just before the Lord just as we pray you just hold that hand up to the Lord Jesus I invite you to come Daughter of Zion I invite you to come those of you that have been bound but you say tonight I want to go free I want to be free brother Matt I don't want to hold on to this thing anymore I've fought it I've struggled with it it's in my I I I know that that that that that I've I've battled it it's in my nature something inside of my heart but tonight I'm coming I'm coming to say Lord Jesus I want to be set free I don't want to die laying down on the on the ground graveling you say what do I got to do brother Matt arise arise loose yourself from the bonds of your neck say how am I going to do it brother Matt the power is already inside of you child I said the power and the strength was already inside of her put on your beautiful garment take off of that dirty garment take off of that guilt that Satan has tried to put on you take off that complex that the devil has tried to lie to you about take it off and put on your beautiful garment be set free be changed tonight I pray God you'd Grant it to every heart every young person that's coming to this altar Lord that's responded to the preaching of the word of God I pray Lord Jesus that you would send a spirit of Freedom here tonight I don't know Lord God I father I know this that you directed me directly specifically to minister tonight God I don't know who's here and what they're under and what chain that's binding their life but Lord I know that it was for one person maybe two maybe three I pray God that they would recognize that they don't have to work anything there's nothing that there's no great thing that they need to do other than just to surrender to the Holy Spirit to that genan seat of God that's already down inside of them and say God if there's a stick that's laying over my life causing me to grow crooked I won't free of it tonight Lord Jesus if there's something trying to deform the word out of my life maybe some trial that I've went through some burden that I'm bearing oh God I pray that you'd bring freedom to that young lady bring freedom to that young man here tonight Lord Jesus set them free God we ask Lord for a special blessing Grant it Lord Jesus there is power in the name of Jesus there is power in the name of Jesus there is power in the name of Jesus The Brak Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain there's an army

you thank you for yielding to the Holy Ghost and I thank you so much for being with us this weekend now pray for the service tomorrow for the because you've had a start now through this weekend that we look to continue to the service tomorrow but in hearing that there's I thank God for the message there are so many things in the message to calm our anxiety and it's something and I when I was first when I first started becoming aware and I first started feeding and all the things of the message and trying to make sense of it my mind I felt would explode there's so much content and information and I had a brother and he shook my hand and he can tell I was troubled and he said Let It Drop into your heart and it was something I had learned and I was reading the message the token and Understanding God's Own Life coming into you and I was trying to figure it out with my mind but Let It Drop and then the he told me the message this was just someone in the parking lot one body of believer to another saying the message that he preached after was desperations and so my prayer for you is that you become desperate for what it is that you have heard that's if you get to that condition and you drop it down in your heart you don't have to understand it all but to be desperate to recognize God's presence and you become desperate that's when everything changed I pray a blessing upon you beyond belief we love you we support you we are here for you now let's let's pray for the food and fellowship dear heavenly father we thank God for your presence among us we thank you Lord for your presence where would we be without your presence I pray for these young people and I thank God for the testimony of their lives I wish Lord that they become desperate desperate not for the things of the world but desperate for the things of God and the kingdom of heaven that awaits thank you for the Grace Grace a double portion of the bride and the Thanksgiving in our hearts knowing you the Creator and author of Our Lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you're [Music] dismissed of you that's the way it's got to be any more of you till there's no room left in me all those wasted hours and minutes they're yours now from the start to the Finish I need more oh of you in [Music] me
