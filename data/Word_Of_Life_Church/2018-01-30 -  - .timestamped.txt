[27:24] fine
[27:29] [Music]
[27:32] praise the Lord I was telling Caroline
[27:37] I'm when we left the service you know
[27:38] it's greatest he is with all that he's
[27:41] done what a little bit that we've been
[27:43] able to see that he's done yet if he
[27:47] couldn't forgive and couldn't pardon and
[27:50] couldn't understand us as feeble mortals
[27:54] really what good but all that do he
[27:58] could speak and the worlds could come
[28:00] into existence make so many many stars
[28:03] that we can't even count them but yet if
[28:07] he couldn't understand how we are
[28:09] couldn't be our Savior our Redeemer I
[28:13] love him for that don't you
[28:15] I'm sure that there's so much about the
[28:18] greatness of our God and the things that
[28:20] he has done I don't believe we'll ever
[28:22] comprehend it in time when we get there
[28:24] he'll make known to us that which is
[28:27] good for us and beneficial for sure
[28:30] let's turn again today if you would to
[28:32] the book of cautions chapter one praise
[28:37] the Lord thank you Jesus
[28:40] Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 so I ask
[28:48] you again today
[28:49] what is your beloved more than another
[28:52] what makes him different what makes him
[28:55] special your Jesus let's take the words
[29:00] of Paul answer this who is the image of
[29:05] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[29:10] creature for by him we're all things
[29:13] created that are in heaven that are in
[29:18] earth visible and invisible whether they
[29:23] be Thrones or dominions principalities
[29:25] or powers all things were created by him
[29:31] and for him he is before all things and
[29:37] by him all things
[29:41] Revelation chapter 4 verse 11
[29:45] thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory
[29:49] and honor and power for thou hast
[29:54] created all things and for thy pleasure
[29:59] they are and were created as I said last
[30:07] night even things about God's creation
[30:09] that you and I may not care for winter
[30:11] time is probably not most of our
[30:13] favorite seasons ice snow Frost
[30:17] maybe there's different animals that we
[30:19] really don't like we just really don't
[30:22] care for them we don't like their
[30:23] demeanor we don't like their behavior
[30:25] but yet God created all these things for
[30:29] his pleasure many of them most of us
[30:32] will never even see in life most of the
[30:35] rare insects and spiders and snakes and
[30:38] all kinds of African animals that lives
[30:41] on the plains most of you will never see
[30:43] them most of you will never even know
[30:45] their existence you can't even pronounce
[30:46] their names so it's evident that they're
[30:49] not just here for your benefit but they
[30:54] are for his pleasure if we could ever
[30:56] get that in our minds today this is the
[30:58] why we're serving God for his pleasure
[31:01] not just for our own it's not just so
[31:04] much what can I get out of Jesus it's
[31:06] what can Jesus get out of me
[31:08] it was our heads together and pray today
[31:11] if you wouldn't Heavenly Father thank
[31:14] you once again Lord Jesus that we could
[31:16] come together in this allotted time we
[31:19] would be able to gather together and
[31:22] church on Sunday what an honor it is to
[31:24] sing to worship to pray to bring prayer
[31:28] requests and testimonies things that you
[31:31] have done among us in such a wonderful
[31:33] way now father were approaching the Word
[31:36] of God and we believe that this word is
[31:39] so vital important to our lives you told
[31:43] us when you were here that man shall not
[31:45] live by bread alone but by every word
[31:47] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[31:50] you know the word has such wonderful
[31:52] wonderful
[31:53] things of the content and the context of
[31:56] the word is so astounding but we know
[31:59] what we need father is not just the
[32:01] logos but the Rhema word which is the
[32:03] word which is in season for where we are
[32:06] I pray that you speak to us today Lord
[32:09] those things that we have needa you say
[32:12] all these hundreds of people that are
[32:13] gathered here today there's absolutely
[32:15] no way that I would be able to speak
[32:18] something that would go to every heart
[32:20] but you can so we're just asking that
[32:22] you would that you would take charge
[32:24] Lord help me that I can get out of the
[32:26] way that you can use that part of
[32:28] yourself that you put in my life to a
[32:30] gift the same thing in them the ability
[32:33] to hear anointest that we can receive
[32:36] from your presence today in Jesus name
[32:38] we ask amen
[32:40] god bless you Saints you may be seated
[32:47] let's read job chapter 38 if you would
[32:51] verse 31 we looked at the almighty last
[32:58] night as he was speaking to job about
[33:01] very common things that job had saw on
[33:04] the earth but yet job could not make eye
[33:09] hoarfrost we've been through the snow
[33:13] the wind God goes on to ask him about
[33:17] the hinds as they will care the unicorn
[33:21] many many things that God relates to job
[33:24] the levy earth on which job has no
[33:27] understanding of even how they work or
[33:30] how they operate as great as science has
[33:33] advanced today there are many many
[33:35] things about what God asked job
[33:37] thousands of years ago they still don't
[33:40] know about and they never will because
[33:43] God has limited man's ability of
[33:46] breaking into his laboratory in so far
[33:49] and he won't let him go any farther
[33:51] because he is the Almighty so last night
[33:55] we looked at it where God had mentioned
[33:58] to job and then we broke down in verse
[34:00] 30 but today we'd like to pick up if we
[34:02] can in verse 31
[34:04] canst thou bind the sweet influences of
[34:08] cádiz or loose the bands of Orion now
[34:14] let me settle you again as I said last
[34:16] night many message folks at altura an
[34:19] aperture goes to talking about stars and
[34:22] the heavenly hosts and the planets and
[34:24] this and that because they have heard
[34:26] the false side which makes them afraid
[34:29] and they relate it to astrology but let
[34:33] me emphasize to you again we are not
[34:35] talking about astrology but astronomy
[34:39] astronomy is of God astrology is of the
[34:43] devil astrology is just something there
[34:46] is a scarecrow to try to keep us away
[34:49] from the real true facts of what God has
[34:51] done now
[34:52] we call them planets so does God God
[34:55] also calls them stars so there are many
[34:58] heavenly bodies that are identified by
[35:01] creation and they vary in degrees as far
[35:04] as size luminosity purpose and all of
[35:08] that as we do as the people of God we
[35:11] could not take a very small planet one
[35:14] that does not shine very great one that
[35:17] does not have a great magnetic pull and
[35:20] look at that one and say you are not
[35:22] necessary if God made it it is necessary
[35:26] we might look at our lives as Christians
[35:29] and saying what have I ever done what if
[35:31] I ever accomplished for the plan of God
[35:33] I've never really led that many people
[35:36] to the Lord it's not that I have that
[35:38] much gravitational pull about my walk
[35:41] with God - I've affected many people my
[35:44] spiritual luminosity comparing it to the
[35:47] Stars is not very great I've never had
[35:50] that many people to come up to me and
[35:51] say oh you're a Christian you're a child
[35:53] of God I sense something special about
[35:56] you and you might sense that you've
[35:58] never really done that much for God I
[36:00] guarantee you every child of God on the
[36:03] earth has a great purpose in the plan of
[36:05] God I'm convinced most of us will never
[36:09] even know the effect that we have had in
[36:13] the plan of God until we get on the
[36:15] other side
[36:16] the people we've influenced the people
[36:18] we've affected and people that we were
[36:21] totally unaware of that God allowed us
[36:24] to affect them it's the same way with
[36:27] say heavenly bodies there are some that
[36:29] are so great and we'll look at some of
[36:31] them today are tourists Beetlejuice some
[36:35] of the ones that are just magnificent
[36:37] the great red glowing planets and their
[36:40] size comparison to the Sun some of them
[36:43] a thousand times larger than our Sun
[36:45] some of them twenty two thousand times
[36:48] larger than our Sun and yet each one of
[36:52] them have their place in the economy of
[36:54] God but we realize it's not always how
[36:57] big we are but it's finding our place in
[37:01] the place of where God wants us to be
[37:04] something can be very very small and
[37:07] very insignificant in relativity to
[37:10] where you had compared it to other
[37:12] things in size and yet that very small
[37:15] thing may fulfill such a wonderful
[37:19] purpose that it's beyond human
[37:21] comprehension how that God would do such
[37:24] now as I mentioned to you last night let
[37:26] me repeat it again today that the
[37:28] scientists and what they've been able to
[37:30] observe thus far was helped with Hubble
[37:33] and with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 that
[37:36] they estimate that there are 70
[37:39] sextillion stars in the known universe
[37:45] show them how many zeros that is brother
[37:48] Daniel that's more fingers and toes and
[37:53] we've all got today all the streamers of
[37:56] the world wouldn't be able to put all of
[37:58] our toes and fingers together with me
[38:00] now as brother joel said these numbers
[38:02] overwhelm you they do me and I want them
[38:05] to I want these things in these facts to
[38:09] totally overwhelm you so you will
[38:12] understand how great our God is and how
[38:17] little that we are but yet how great he
[38:21] loves us
[38:22] and his concern now notice this in
[38:26] Genesis chapter 1 verse 16 get the next
[38:31] one ready brother Daniel the pale blue
[38:34] dot God made two great lights the
[38:38] greater light to rule the day and the
[38:42] lesser light to rule the night he made
[38:47] the stars also I love the way Moses did
[38:51] that he just concealed trillions and
[38:58] trillions of stars in those few words
[39:06] and he made the stars also and God set
[39:17] them in the firmament of the heaven to
[39:22] give light upon the earth so God made
[39:31] the Sun and you could take 1 million of
[39:37] our earths and place in that Sun the
[39:44] moon and the stars but yet God made them
[39:48] for the benefit of this tiny blue dot
[40:00] February the 14th 1990 Apollo 1 was
[40:07] leaving our solar system
[40:11] NASA directed it to turn its cameras
[40:16] back toward home as the camera from
[40:21] Voyager 1 come back toward Earth this is
[40:28] the picture that it took that little dot
[40:33] that's your home that is 3.7 billion
[40:41] miles from Voyager and yet God so loved
[40:51] that tiny blue dot he made the Sun so
[40:59] bright and so brilliant for life on that
[41:03] dot he placed the moon in its orbit
[41:07] 238,000 miles out there so its
[41:11] gravitational pull would be able to
[41:14] affect the tides on that tiny blue dot
[41:19] now you you are in the middle of
[41:22] trillions and trillions of stars and yet
[41:27] this is your home and what a Lord God
[41:31] wanted to condemn sin to the greatest
[41:33] act of condescension he'd ever done he
[41:38] did not pick Betelgeuse he did not pick
[41:41] raise your hell he did not take some of
[41:44] the great great planets in the universe
[41:48] it shows that tiny blue dot praise Peter
[41:56] God
[41:58] that little speck of dust but believe it
[42:03] or not that little speck of dust is
[42:05] ordained to life out of all those
[42:12] planets as great as they are all of
[42:14] those stars as great as they are science
[42:17] has never found a one of them that has
[42:21] life but this one has life who are you
[42:27] in comparison to the world a little
[42:30] speck of dust
[42:32] what is this church in comparison to the
[42:35] world churches a tiny speck of dust what
[42:39] are we in comparison to all the peoples
[42:43] of the earth a tiny speck of dust but
[42:46] what makes us so wonderful and blessed
[42:49] in the eyes of God this tiny speck of
[42:52] dust is ordained to the eternal life so
[42:59] you see you don't always have to be the
[43:02] greatest planet you don't have to be the
[43:05] largest planet or the one with the
[43:08] greatest luminosity you have to be the
[43:12] one that God chose
[43:17] Genesis 1:18 think about the Daniel to
[43:20] rule over the day and over the night to
[43:23] divide the light from the darkness and
[43:25] God saw that it was good now the stars
[43:30] of course declare a story they are
[43:34] natural be no time but they are also
[43:37] spiritual representatives of the way
[43:40] back to God in Genesis 15 5 speaking of
[43:45] Abraham he brought him forth abroad and
[43:47] said look now toward heaven and tell the
[43:50] Stars if shall be able to numbers in and
[43:53] he said unto Him so shall thy seed be
[43:57] Genesis 22 17 that in blessing I will
[44:00] bless thee and multiplying I will
[44:02] multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven
[44:05] so the stars also symbolize children and
[44:10] as the sand which is upon the sea shore
[44:12] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[44:15] his enemies and the stars can also have
[44:19] a spiritual representation of human
[44:22] beings Joseph in his dream and Genesis
[44:25] 37 9 he dreamed yet another dream and he
[44:28] told his brethren and said behold I have
[44:30] dreamed a dream more and behold the son
[44:32] which was his father and the moon which
[44:35] was his mother and the eleven stars
[44:37] which were his brothers made obeisance
[44:40] to me
[44:41] so God then uses the Stars the Sun the
[44:45] Moon the heavenly host and the heavenly
[44:47] bodies to be able to represent great
[44:50] stories of obedience and Submission and
[44:53] also Redemption notice again in judges
[44:57] chapter 5 verse 19 the kings came and
[45:00] fought them notice now they fought the
[45:02] kings of Canaan
[45:03] Betina by the waters of Megiddo they
[45:06] took no gain of money
[45:08] they fought from heaven the stars in
[45:12] their courses against Caesarea
[45:16] listen el they fought from heaven the
[45:21] stars in their courses they fought
[45:25] against cess RIA now this is one of the
[45:29] great battles of the children of Israel
[45:31] whenever God had declared he would be
[45:34] with them but God is now allowing the
[45:37] paths of the stars to be able to affect
[45:41] the influence of what's going on on the
[45:44] earth now remember one of the things
[45:45] that God asked Joel was can you bind the
[45:48] sweet influences of Pleiades now of
[45:52] course Pleiades is the constellation of
[45:54] the Seven Sisters and it is a forerunner
[45:57] of the spring equinox which is
[46:00] prophesying that the earth is fixing to
[46:03] come under the sweet influence of the
[46:06] heavenly bodies now what's this
[46:08] josephus tree like this and about this
[46:10] battle that we just read eisah battle
[46:13] began a violent tempest came on a great
[46:17] downfall of rain and a hailstorm which
[46:21] drive in full in the faces of the
[46:23] Canaanites so blinded and benumbed them
[46:26] with coal they could neither use their
[46:29] bows with effect nor hold their swords
[46:32] yet the book of Judges the writer of
[46:34] Judges does not describe to us all of
[46:37] these but just Josephus in story him
[46:39] tells us what actually happened so there
[46:42] was rain and there was driving wind and
[46:45] there was hail and yet they all sir of
[46:48] the book of Judges identifies this with
[46:50] the stars of the heavens that they are
[46:53] assisting man upon the earth now you'll
[46:56] have to take of course the scriptural
[46:58] word in the spiritual understanding of
[46:59] this that no doubt there's many
[47:01] influences that the stars the Sun and
[47:04] the moon have upon the effect on the
[47:07] earth that science knows absolutely
[47:08] nothing about and really I think if we
[47:11] needed to know a whole lot about it God
[47:14] would have enlightened us in his word
[47:16] you agree with that but yet we can see
[47:18] little excerpts of that influence by
[47:21] which God was able to project that
[47:23] notice again in Psalms chapter 8 verse 3
[47:26] when I consider the heavens the work of
[47:28] thy fingers the moon and the stars which
[47:31] thou hast or
[47:32] now there's always been something about
[47:34] the heavens that has mesmerized man not
[47:37] only those who were god-fearing but
[47:39] those others as well
[47:41] psalms 136 and six to him that stretched
[47:44] out the earth above the waters for His
[47:47] mercy endureth forever to him that made
[47:50] great lights for his mercy endureth for
[47:54] ever the Sun to rule the day for His
[47:57] mercy endureth forever o beginning the
[48:00] thought of what David is saying those
[48:02] heavenly bodies and their influence are
[48:05] placed up in the heavens because of the
[48:08] mercy of God that's right notice the
[48:12] moon and the stars to rule the night for
[48:15] His mercy endureth forever Psalms 148
[48:19] three praise ye Him Sun and Moon praise
[48:24] him all ye stars of light praise Him ye
[48:30] heaven of heavens and that be above the
[48:34] heavens amen let them praise the name of
[48:38] the Lord for he commanded and they were
[48:41] created now you and I of course do not
[48:45] have the ability to be able to hear the
[48:47] stars and say whether they sing whether
[48:50] it is or orbital noise and those of you
[48:52] that have looked into this you know that
[48:54] scientists actually recorded sounds out
[48:57] in the universe so whether it is those
[48:59] which are intelligible to a recorder and
[49:02] they're able to pick it up or whether it
[49:04] is in their own star language that we do
[49:07] not have the ability to be able to
[49:09] receive their frequency somehow another
[49:12] the Sun the Moon the Stars the heavenly
[49:14] hosts they are worshipping God as I said
[49:18] last night if they're doing it then
[49:19] there's Christians we ought to do it as
[49:21] well Psalms are Isaiah 14:13
[49:24] for thou was said in thine heart I will
[49:26] ascend into heaven speaking to Satan I
[49:29] would exalt my throne above the stars of
[49:32] God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[49:34] the congregation on the sides of the
[49:36] north and we know of course we've looked
[49:37] at this many many times that they stars
[49:39] all the Messiah's brothers or the
[49:41] Messiah's progeny here again
[49:44] is identified in a spiritual symbol that
[49:47] the stars
[49:48] he drew a third part of the stars of
[49:50] heaven which was a symbol of the angels
[49:52] which followed it with the devil a
[49:54] jeremiah 31 35 thus sayeth the Lord
[49:57] which giveth the Sun by death by light
[49:59] by day and the ordinances of the moon
[50:02] and of the stars for light by night now
[50:05] you see God with someone who set up the
[50:07] ordinances which are the laws of the
[50:10] universe this is the reason why that we
[50:13] can look up in the sky we see Orion we
[50:15] see Pleiades we see Virgo we see libera
[50:18] we see all of these stars that have been
[50:20] there Adam saw the same thing and man
[50:22] has looked at this for thousands of
[50:24] generations what have they not moved
[50:27] from those original spots they are kept
[50:29] there by the ordinance of God they are
[50:32] kept there because it pleases him to
[50:35] tell the story of redemption by the term
[50:38] called the zodiac which lays on the
[50:40] elliptical view of the angle about what
[50:42] you are able to view them how you go
[50:44] outside of our little place a habitable
[50:46] zone as it is called you would not even
[50:48] see the constellations in the same way
[50:51] remember the constellations are gathered
[50:54] together so the people on this little
[50:56] blue dot can view them and read the
[50:58] story now if you'd go out to Jupiter and
[51:00] try to look at the same constellations
[51:03] you'll get all mixed up and you wouldn't
[51:05] get the right interpretation of the
[51:07] story because you got to be where
[51:09] there's life in order to understand what
[51:11] the life giver is saying praise be to
[51:15] God
[51:16] notice this now he said which divideth
[51:18] to see when the waves are of roar the
[51:21] Lord of Hosts is his name Daniel chapter
[51:24] 12 verse 3 and they that shall be wise
[51:26] shall shine as the brightness of the
[51:29] firmament talking about the saints now
[51:31] and they that turn many to righteousness
[51:33] as the stars for ever and ever
[51:38] now it shows the personification of
[51:40] glory which will be revealed to in the
[51:43] latter times to the elect of God as we
[51:46] move into our glorified bodies our
[51:48] glorified bodies is actually the answer
[51:51] to the parallel
[51:52] the glory of God was just given to the
[51:54] stars er luminosity in the beginning
[51:56] actually Burma glow up before the Lord
[51:58] and we are rewarded according to what
[52:00] he's been able Duss to do on this earth
[52:02] he will say enter into the glories of
[52:04] the Lord they new to this kingdom which
[52:06] is prepared for you before the
[52:08] foundation of the world there will be
[52:09] degrees in eternity as there are degrees
[52:12] in time now what if that degrees we
[52:15] won't look at it the same way we do now
[52:16] most people have a hard time dealing
[52:18] with degrees now because of jealousy and
[52:21] this and that if someone can sing better
[52:23] than them preach better than them play
[52:25] the guitar better than them a lot of
[52:27] folks really have a hard time with that
[52:28] but once we get into eternity and we
[52:31] reverted back to the original glory
[52:33] there will still be diversities of
[52:35] glories there there always has been
[52:38] there always will be but yet the part
[52:40] about us that bothers us will no longer
[52:42] be there so we will be able to see the
[52:45] Apostles setting on throw Thrones nobody
[52:47] will be jealous of it will see their
[52:49] names written on their will see the 24
[52:51] elders will see all of these things that
[52:54] God will have and yet nobody will be
[52:57] bothered by know about it be over in
[52:58] their little mansion apartment said I'm
[53:00] so aggravated my name wasn't wrote on
[53:02] the city gate I can't believe that then
[53:05] Jesus know what a great benefit I was to
[53:07] the kingdom of God thank God that part
[53:09] about us all will absolutely be an ally
[53:12] didn't be changed but yet there will be
[53:14] glory so here God likens the Saints that
[53:18] will receive glory two stars and how
[53:21] they will shine so the Stars will in the
[53:24] glory of God in the kingdom of God in
[53:26] the world that is to come surely you
[53:28] don't believe that you and I will have
[53:29] the same position as were the Twelve
[53:32] Apostles or would even the prophet of
[53:34] God of our age there's no way but yet
[53:36] it's not like we're going to be unhappy
[53:38] with what we are we will be as the stars
[53:40] because the transfer of the glory which
[53:43] has been viewed by man for thousands of
[53:45] years will now receive its height in
[53:48] eternity and here will be the real stars
[53:51] of God sons and daughters of God living
[53:54] in the kingdom around us
[53:56] - Owen hallelujah and we will be
[53:59] answering back to what he has done for
[54:02] us and enabled us to do no jealousy no
[54:05] sickness no pain no heartaches all that
[54:09] world done away with hey man notice Amos
[54:16] chapter 5 verse 8
[54:18] seek him that make us the seven stars
[54:27] the seven stars of the Seven Sisters or
[54:30] clear these and Orion in his strange
[54:33] that a prophet of God would tell the
[54:35] people to seek him who makes the Stars
[54:38] and turneth the shadow of death into the
[54:41] morning and make us sad a dark and night
[54:44] that caller for the waters of the sea
[54:45] and pour sand out upon the face of the
[54:47] earth the Lord is his name
[54:51] notice in Jude in the New Testament out
[54:53] chapter one verse thirteen raging waves
[54:55] of the sea foaming out their own shame
[54:57] wandering stars to whom is reserved the
[55:01] blackness of Darkness forever again a
[55:04] spiritual symbol so here we see those in
[55:07] who will follow away from truth they are
[55:09] likened to wandering stars so it is a
[55:12] symbol of a meteorite or a comet which
[55:16] moves out of its particular orbit and
[55:18] moves down into another orbit and when
[55:20] it does hit breaks down which we say
[55:22] well that was a shooting star know that
[55:24] one a shooting star that was a meteorite
[55:26] and it was something that dropped down
[55:28] into the Earth's atmosphere and when it
[55:30] does what happens to them they are
[55:32] burned up what will happen to those who
[55:35] leave the Word of God and leave the
[55:37] truth and never come back and repent
[55:39] they will drop down in the atmosphere or
[55:42] the in time message and there they will
[55:44] be annihilated I'd say I hate to say it
[55:47] but it's the truth
[55:48] Revelation chapter 1 verse 16 and it had
[55:51] in his right hand seven stars again our
[55:54] spiritual symbol now remember he who
[55:56] made Pleiades he who made the
[55:59] Seven Sisters called and made the seven
[56:03] brothers you see the church ages did not
[56:10] need the Seven Sisters they needed the
[56:15] seven messengers thank you Jesus happens
[56:23] fresh from the man of heaven right there
[56:24] he had in his right hand seven stars and
[56:28] out of his mouth when a short two edged
[56:32] sword and his countenance was as the son
[56:34] shyness in his strength verse 20 the
[56:37] mystery of the Seven Stars which thou
[56:40] sawest in my right hand and the Seven
[56:42] golden candlesticks the seven stars are
[56:45] the seven angels of the seven churches
[56:49] and Happy Valley said now these are the
[56:52] words of Jesus amen
[56:55] so seven stars were in his right hand
[56:57] and those he tells us those stars were
[57:00] actually messengers to the churches this
[57:03] is why we believe we need one that's
[57:05] right it's not our words it's the words
[57:07] of the Lord Jesus and the seven
[57:09] candlesticks which thou sawest are the
[57:11] seven churches chapter 2 verse 1 under
[57:14] the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write
[57:16] these things saith he that holdeth the
[57:19] seven stars in his right hand who
[57:23] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[57:25] candlesticks which are the church again
[57:28] revelation 3:1 under the Angel of the
[57:30] Church of Sardis write these things
[57:33] saith he that have the seven spirits of
[57:35] God and the Seven Stars I know thy works
[57:38] if thou hast a name that thou livest and
[57:41] art dead revelation 12:1
[57:43] and there appeared another great wonder
[57:45] in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun
[57:48] now here is Israel clothed with the Sun
[57:50] the moon under her feet and on her she
[57:53] had a crown of twelve stars verse four
[57:56] and his tail drew the third part of the
[57:59] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[58:02] earth so stars then can be spiritual
[58:04] symbols of a child which Christ it was
[58:07] we know it was a symbol of him it was
[58:09] also a symbol
[58:11] the devil is he truth is with his tail
[58:13] he drew the third part of the stars
[58:15] which was fallen angels it was a symbol
[58:17] of Joseph and his brothers but now let's
[58:19] go back to the stars itself because God
[58:22] is not speaking to job of the spiritual
[58:25] aspect but more the natural aspect so he
[58:27] asked him this question can now bind the
[58:30] sweet influences of Pleiades or loose
[58:34] the bands of Orion now this is as we
[58:37] said the constellation of the Seven
[58:40] Sisters or please whichever you prefer
[58:42] to call it and it comes in the rising in
[58:45] the spring and God is projecting from a
[58:49] deity standpoint something what science
[58:52] may never relate to never understand and
[58:55] that is that the constellations have an
[58:58] effect or a parallel of what is going on
[59:01] on the earth so God actually uses the
[59:04] word and he calls it sweet can South be
[59:08] able to bind the sweet influences out
[59:11] please not asking him about the
[59:13] luminosity of Pleiades or the glory of
[59:15] Pleiades but about the influence so the
[59:18] stars you have an influence on the earth
[59:20] you believe that these are God's words
[59:22] so it is the pleasantness of its
[59:26] position in the earth now those of you
[59:28] that know a thing about this you know
[59:29] that whenever you look at those
[59:31] constellations they appear in Greater
[59:33] time now when we go into the fault we
[59:35] see of course Orion which comes around
[59:37] around October September October goes up
[59:40] to January February be even possibly
[59:41] into March and whenever you see him he
[59:44] is a symbol of cold and winter and
[59:47] storms but yet when you see the Seven
[59:50] Sisters where we are and you look how
[59:52] according to what are you on the Earth's
[59:54] and the way the earth still surround
[59:55] that you see them in different times so
[59:58] God actually uses them as a symbol again
[1:00:01] as he said in Amos 5 a seek him that
[1:00:04] maketh the seven stars and Araya so the
[1:00:07] appearance of spring is four on are the
[1:00:11] heavenly stars
[1:00:15] so record of God was going to call a
[1:00:18] bride in the last days Rick and it sent
[1:00:21] a church or an automobile reckon what
[1:00:25] God but decline in the heavens stars
[1:00:29] angels
[1:00:32] now whatever Pleiades begins to move
[1:00:35] around to word that it is visible and
[1:00:37] the spring equinox comes upon the earth
[1:00:40] the earth is going to start releasing
[1:00:44] its influence of winter time now the
[1:00:48] constellation whether or not God is
[1:00:50] speaking poetically or God is speaking
[1:00:53] scientifically in the sense that there
[1:00:55] is a natural force by gravitational pull
[1:00:58] that is affecting on the on the planet
[1:01:00] well I don't know we'll ask you maybe
[1:01:02] when we get up there
[1:01:03] but God relates this as if though there
[1:01:06] is an influence from Pleiades itself to
[1:01:09] the earth and he identifies this as the
[1:01:12] influence when the earth is going to be
[1:01:15] released out the harshness of winner now
[1:01:18] it won't be long that Pleiades will
[1:01:20] appear again and she'll be so visible
[1:01:23] and so beautiful and in the night skies
[1:01:25] of May June July August September
[1:01:27] absolutely just phenomenal the way she
[1:01:30] appears but where's her coming is a
[1:01:33] loosening of something on the earth
[1:01:36] Laurie so the eyes that we looked at
[1:01:40] last night the snow and the things that
[1:01:42] accompanied by winner was the for
[1:01:45] running or the Ryan the hunter she now
[1:01:48] breaks that hole and another cycle is
[1:01:52] coming upon the earth which is what
[1:01:54] spring these stars God placed them there
[1:01:59] and part of the mystery of redemption as
[1:02:03] well so God now is relating to job part
[1:02:07] of the things that he along those that
[1:02:09] he asked job all you you think you're
[1:02:11] smart you think you know so much can you
[1:02:14] bind up the sweet influences of Pleiades
[1:02:17] now you're a human smart alec and you
[1:02:20] just question me how come I'm letting
[1:02:22] you go through this how come I'm letting
[1:02:24] you go Saturday and walk
[1:02:25] world's going on in your life and you
[1:02:27] think you know so much about stuff and
[1:02:28] you're questioning me about what I let
[1:02:30] you go through now let me ask you a few
[1:02:32] questions big boy
[1:02:37] apparently Jobe had developed an
[1:02:39] attitude in this trial now God says
[1:02:43] before the trial that the man is perfect
[1:02:46] he's upright and there's nothing wrong
[1:02:49] with the man but we can watch the man as
[1:02:52] he goes through the trial and he goes to
[1:02:54] developing some attitudes well praise
[1:02:59] the Lord
[1:02:59] anybody ever been there and done that
[1:03:01] besides me and Jobe you ever goes
[1:03:03] through a trial and go to develop an
[1:03:05] attitude and getting real mouthy with
[1:03:07] God that's what Joe Basu it Joba
[1:03:12] developed a real lousy lousy attitude
[1:03:16] with God this is why God's absolute ly
[1:03:20] wearing him out God uses lightning bolts
[1:03:23] he uses clouds he uses goats he uses
[1:03:25] unicorns he uses Arcturus he uses all
[1:03:28] kinds of things to finally job says our
[1:03:29] repentance eye calls analysis I'm sorry
[1:03:32] Lord I shouldn't have said those things
[1:03:33] now it would appear that Joe did not
[1:03:36] have this attitude but remember he had
[1:03:38] never been in this particular place
[1:03:40] before and this trial that he was going
[1:03:43] through was not only proving him but it
[1:03:45] was also proving something about Jobe
[1:03:48] that God already knew but no doubt Joe
[1:03:50] did not even know and recognize in
[1:03:52] himself because this trial was bringing
[1:03:55] it out the friend please don't
[1:03:57] misunderstand me
[1:03:57] you know God allows us to go through
[1:03:59] things sometimes that will bring out the
[1:04:02] deep things that are buried within our
[1:04:04] spirit always and our maker that maybe
[1:04:07] you've never had a trial so far that's
[1:04:09] ever brought that weakness out of you
[1:04:12] and God will allow something to come
[1:04:14] your way as apparently did with Joe and
[1:04:17] that brought something out of Jobe an
[1:04:19] attitude a harshness a mousy thing
[1:04:22] toward God that maybe Jobos told me
[1:04:25] surprise I can't believe I'm saying this
[1:04:27] to God what is the matter with me I
[1:04:29] cannot
[1:04:30] leave I've got this attitude toward God
[1:04:32] anybody ever been there and then when
[1:04:35] you're met 11 she say hog the world's
[1:04:37] the matter with me what am I saying what
[1:04:40] am i doing
[1:04:46] well me and garden Shogun brother and
[1:04:48] really we've been there the rest of you
[1:04:51] I hope y'all
[1:04:53] if you don't brother Donnie I have I've
[1:04:57] opened my big fat mouth and questioned
[1:05:00] God God why this and how come that so
[1:05:06] God is now bringing showed to that spot
[1:05:09] so you've got such an attitude ami would
[1:05:11] you care to make me a little hoarfrost
[1:05:13] this morning before breakfast
[1:05:18] well I seems to be your favorite word I
[1:05:23] felt what I want you to do
[1:05:24] I like for you to call the lightning
[1:05:26] bolt out of heaven would you first of
[1:05:32] all do you understand how they work boy
[1:05:36] do you understand how to make a bolt of
[1:05:39] fire that will reach 50 thousand votes
[1:05:41] hotter than the surface of the scythe
[1:05:46] I'll settle for one five thousand three
[1:05:51] you can even use an angle batter come on
[1:05:54] man make something you know so much
[1:05:59] sometimes God has to shame us because in
[1:06:02] reality we need to be shamed well praise
[1:06:06] the Lord now God is asking Joel these
[1:06:12] questions he knows he can't it's amazing
[1:06:18] to me that the writer of joven all these
[1:06:19] questions when God asked it I don't know
[1:06:22] if job is sitting there looking all the
[1:06:23] way y'all were looking at me when I'm
[1:06:25] preaching or if job's answer is not even
[1:06:27] worth answer or if Joe does not say a
[1:06:29] word till chapter 42 but if he does God
[1:06:34] don't give him no room to write down his
[1:06:36] response everything is God that God lays
[1:06:39] it on him and God says can you do this
[1:06:41] are you the one who calls the line
[1:06:43] for a are you the one who causes the
[1:06:44] hansik at the ring there's an answer to
[1:06:47] you can you look up to the crowds of the
[1:06:49] bottles of heaven can you stop this can
[1:06:51] you do that can you do this and you do
[1:06:53] that and you do this sometimes we just
[1:07:02] need a good war bit so when the Pleiades
[1:07:09] comes around the earth the temperature
[1:07:17] starts warming up on the globe the ice
[1:07:21] starts melting the rivers and creeks and
[1:07:25] streams and ponds which were held but
[1:07:28] the harshness of the influence of Orion
[1:07:30] the water start melted the days start
[1:07:34] getting longer the temperature starts
[1:07:37] climbing on the earth the sweet
[1:07:40] influence of days may I take this this
[1:07:46] way for a few moments I remember my life
[1:07:51] Alfa mended the influence of the Civil
[1:07:54] Star I remembered my life in a world of
[1:08:00] Pentecostal blackness and darkness when
[1:08:04] I thought us doing something for God
[1:08:06] I remember my life wandering around and
[1:08:10] trying to understand what God was and
[1:08:13] how much more there must be about God
[1:08:16] something down in my soul calling for
[1:08:19] more of God but it didn't know what it
[1:08:21] was God let me get underneath the
[1:08:24] influence of the seven star for a pizza
[1:08:29] God and when I started hearing and when
[1:08:32] I started reading and what that prophet
[1:08:34] of God had to say and listening to those
[1:08:37] tapes the waters of life started on
[1:08:40] thawing out of my soul praise be to God
[1:08:43] I had no longer walk by the down and the
[1:08:45] darkness that I walked into and the
[1:08:49] prior understanding that I had what was
[1:08:51] it the change at all
[1:08:53] it was the influence of the seven star
[1:08:57] don't you appreciate it today no glory
[1:09:03] glory to God
[1:09:05] notice can you bind the sweet influences
[1:09:11] brother Daniel has shown some pictures
[1:09:14] of Pleiades can Dowe canst thou bind the
[1:09:21] sweet influences of 3ds or loose the
[1:09:26] bands of Orion now once you look at
[1:09:33] these stars how they vary and what
[1:09:36] scientists call luminosity there's
[1:09:40] apostles prophets pastors and teachers
[1:09:45] and then there's song leaders in there
[1:09:47] and their special singers and there's
[1:09:50] rooted musicians and their Sunday School
[1:09:52] teachers and there's people who can work
[1:09:54] in the library and people that can make
[1:09:55] tapes and there's all kinds of oh y'all
[1:09:59] didn't see that look at the luminosity
[1:10:01] of these stars look at how they vary
[1:10:03] look at how one bigger and the size look
[1:10:06] at how that they shine and the others
[1:10:07] that you know it's absolutely amazing
[1:10:09] because what you see in the heavens is
[1:10:11] what you see reflected in the church but
[1:10:13] online unlike us on the earth I don't
[1:10:16] argue in fuss and debate now I want to
[1:10:18] be this and I want to be broader god
[1:10:20] this ain't fair don't you understand
[1:10:22] what you've done you missed a grand
[1:10:23] opportunity you made me a point eight in
[1:10:26] the luminosity I should be a point two
[1:10:28] now the way they measure luminosity the
[1:10:31] smaller the number the brighter it is
[1:10:33] Lord you made me a point eight that was
[1:10:35] a bad mistake
[1:10:36] I don't want of the greatest Christians
[1:10:38] in this message I'm one of the greatest
[1:10:40] most devout most holy most humble most
[1:10:43] liar
[1:10:44] I'm either mosa
[1:10:47] I may have a slight problem with
[1:10:52] bragging lord but I mean all of the
[1:10:54] stars have some flaws hallelujah
[1:11:03] Adam looked up when God made him the
[1:11:05] first night after his creation you
[1:11:09] imagine his father come down and the son
[1:11:11] says come here son let me show you
[1:11:14] something human I made all of them Wow
[1:11:29] double Wow quadruple waffle sextillion
[1:11:32] Wow now let me show you the story this
[1:11:40] plane out here hung across the elliptic
[1:11:44] is going to be termed as the zodiac or
[1:11:47] in other words the zodiac word means the
[1:11:52] way let me show you those twelve symbols
[1:11:57] and this begins with the Virgin ends
[1:12:02] with a lion it's the mystery of
[1:12:05] redemption
[1:12:09] you made all the kind of what nothing I
[1:12:14] just spoke
[1:12:17] it's freaky you imagine Adam walking
[1:12:24] around sir Wow so God says to choke
[1:12:32] you're so familiar with survival can you
[1:12:36] bind the influences of the Seven Sisters
[1:12:46] come be excused
[1:12:48] I need gross bathroom I need to drink
[1:12:53] water set out job you're gonna hear my
[1:12:57] sermon think of it friends they've never
[1:13:04] moved
[1:13:06] now as you behold this year you see some
[1:13:09] absolutely wonderful things those seven
[1:13:10] bright stars that some of these others
[1:13:13] that you see behind them aren't stars
[1:13:16] they're galaxies which contain millions
[1:13:20] of stars within themselves but the view
[1:13:25] of Hubble Deep Field when you're able to
[1:13:28] look at this you're seeing trillions of
[1:13:30] stars at one time and here you are
[1:13:34] living on this little blue pail dot and
[1:13:39] the mighty God the mighty God did all
[1:13:45] this for you next can you bind the sweet
[1:13:53] influences can you be able to affect
[1:13:57] speak to them would you all like to tell
[1:14:02] them to do something but mother that's
[1:14:05] the pitcher will go out and that will
[1:14:06] all come to your house tell us what time

[1:14:27] consult bind the sweet influences of
[1:14:30] Pleiades or loose the bands of Orion job
[1:14:38] chapter 9 verse 7 which commanded the
[1:14:40] Sun and it rises not and seal earth up
[1:14:42] the stars which a long span us out the
[1:14:45] heavens and travels upon the waves of
[1:14:47] the sea which make us our tourists
[1:14:50] Orion and Pleiades and the chambers of
[1:14:55] the south which newest great things pass
[1:14:59] finding out yay and wonders I said it
[1:15:09] last night let me say it again this is
[1:15:10] one reason why I hate my fears don't
[1:15:19] look at me like you know what I'm
[1:15:20] talking about I heard God say in his
[1:15:23] word I'll do this and I'll never leave

[1:15:26] back up against the wall sometimes and I

[1:15:29] which way it's gonna go
[1:15:30] and what do I feel my nameís human fear

[1:15:49] they're gonna be lost what is it you
[1:15:51] know the same thing that I feel it's a
[1:15:53] human fear and the God who made all of
[1:15:56] this cannot he help us you think he
[1:16:03] loves Pleiades more than brother Keith
[1:16:05] Phillips he who hung those stars and
[1:16:10] gave the ordinance of the universe
[1:16:12] cannot he speak this very day to our
[1:16:15] brother's body but that disease is
[1:16:18] trying to take his life
[1:16:20] and silly things whatever you're facing
[1:16:27] whatever you're going through and maybe
[1:16:28] you're on the winter time of an Orion
[1:16:30] and the influence of its bands it's so
[1:16:32] gripped upon your life and you seem like
[1:16:34] nothing's gonna break hold on Springs
[1:16:36] coming please rise in the sky can sell
[1:16:50] buying the sweet influences of Pleiades
[1:16:52] or loose the bands this constellation
[1:17:00] appears in the winter bring the high
[1:17:04] raging winds this is the constellation
[1:17:05] actually the Paul dealt with in the book
[1:17:07] of Acts this was the rise a part of what
[1:17:10] Paul was dealing with you see the winter
[1:17:13] time reflecting upon the earth is
[1:17:15] reflecting what Paul was going through
[1:17:16] as a winter time a cycle a very terrible
[1:17:19] cycle maybe some of you are there now
[1:17:21] you can imagine as ancient people begin
[1:17:24] to look in the skies under the direction
[1:17:26] of Adam which handed it down to Noah as
[1:17:28] I mentioned to you last night these
[1:17:30] constellations are in every major
[1:17:33] nationality culture and religion of the
[1:17:35] world they are reflected even the 12
[1:17:38] signs of the zodiac are reflected in
[1:17:41] every aspect every civilization the
[1:17:43] Mayan Indians the Aztecs who evermore
[1:17:46] the Great Pyramids of Giza are built in
[1:17:49] an exact replica of the year 10,000 735
[1:17:53] BC the way they would have been lined up
[1:17:55] over the plaza or the desert rather of
[1:17:57] the state of Egypt and they built it
[1:17:59] exactly with the same thing the Mayan
[1:18:01] Indians part of their civilization part
[1:18:04] of their buildings to this day they have
[1:18:06] found out some of the foundations which
[1:18:07] answer exactly to the belt of Orion so
[1:18:10] people looked up and they sir knew and
[1:18:12] saw that there was something there now
[1:18:15] depending on of course how you look at
[1:18:16] this and you think oh my I don't
[1:18:18] understand this and about that well I
[1:18:20] understand very little about it but all
[1:18:21] I know is I see my father's handwriting
[1:18:24] also at all
[1:18:25] now what does it all mean I don't have a
[1:18:27] clue I do about how to spell every now
[1:18:29] and then oh what a little bit I do
[1:18:30] understand but the band's notice the
[1:18:33] bands are variety here like this you can
[1:18:35] see there again look at the stars in
[1:18:38] glory do all of them make up the image
[1:18:41] of the hunter they do not but picked out
[1:18:43] are certain ones that will tie together
[1:18:45] to make a constellation to tell a story
[1:18:48] that story has been read and reread and
[1:18:52] reread millions of times again and God
[1:18:57] Himself quoting this think of it can you
[1:19:02] bind can you bind all right what does
[1:19:07] Orion do Oh Ryan was cold binds up life
[1:19:11] Orion was cold binds up the streams
[1:19:14] Orion was cold numbs the hands of people
[1:19:18] and they can't work as they could under
[1:19:23] the influence of Pleiades you and I were
[1:19:28] living in a cold dark winter time of
[1:19:30] church age but God sent the rising of
[1:19:34] the Sun our eyes come open we'd all been
[1:19:39] sleeping up in the loft as it were we
[1:19:42] needed some grease home our eyes
[1:19:47] was all mannered together and somebody
[1:19:49] was looking up and trying to understand
[1:19:51] the Godhead you saw to some of the time
[1:19:53] and then you saw Sri and then you
[1:19:55] thought you saw one but you couldn't
[1:19:56] figure it out so you try to get that
[1:19:58] matter out of the eyes and you go down
[1:19:59] to your past your posture huh I'm really
[1:20:01] confused about the Godhead well to be
[1:20:03] honest with you I am too
[1:20:04] he needed some I saved as well so what
[1:20:06] did God do God sent the spring equinox
[1:20:09] upon the church and said it is the
[1:20:12] rising of the Sun
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:17] lose the bugs of winter time on your
[1:20:20] life sort of Ryan strengths
[1:20:34] it makes men come in you understand what
[1:20:40] she was feeling here a few weeks ago

[1:21:00] breathe right him I don't want to
[1:21:01] talking about you couldn't even breathe
[1:21:03] right this amazing when the temperature
[1:21:05] changed how much better you can breathe
[1:21:10] God takes conflict in constellations to
[1:21:15] show job in the same verse he takes the
[1:21:21] constellation of spring versus the
[1:21:24] constellation of winter in fest case you
[1:21:28] see this is part of who you are don't
[1:21:37] get me wrong I think you're incredible
[1:21:39] it's just your influence I don't like
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:44] I understand why folks go to Florida on
[1:21:50] the south in Arizona especially the
[1:21:54] older I get I understand why folks don't
[1:21:59] like the cold weather yet coldest part
[1:22:02] of it now I'm not speaking just now
[1:22:04] naturally I'm speaking spiritually as
[1:22:06] well I understand why folks don't like
[1:22:09] valleys it's the hunter mr. hunter
[1:22:13] what's he doing better not move gene
[1:22:17] I've got you in my spot you better not
[1:22:19] move that one Otello I don't like to
[1:22:22] have been prancing my guardian and
[1:22:24] something I've been going to church I've
[1:22:25] been several services I ain't felt
[1:22:27] nothing
[1:22:27] I don't know what Malone's going on
[1:22:29] don't you understand it's the numbness
[1:22:31] of Orion strengths and stem bears oh my
[1:22:34] that's coming upon you and you're in the
[1:22:36] wintertime a struggle of your life I'd
[1:22:38] remember there will be another spring
[1:22:41] friends o globo the doggie I prayed that
[1:22:43] pray one was supposed to do keep right
[1:22:45] on praying appearing in the autumn you
[1:22:54] imagine now for sailors and them as they
[1:22:56] begin to watch the constellations of the
[1:22:58] skies as they changed and they saw Orion
[1:23:01] appearing in the autumn it was a bad
[1:23:03] omen the waves as always get worse the
[1:23:07] winds more tumultuous they knew with
[1:23:10] Orion's coming his bands oh they could
[1:23:19] stand there and say there will be
[1:23:20] another spring that's a beautiful song
[1:23:27] but I'm gonna tell you one thing
[1:23:28] sometimes and you're down on the valley
[1:23:29] hit don't do a lot for you Donnie Rambo
[1:23:33] wrote some pretty songs about being in
[1:23:35] the valley in the valley he restoreth my
[1:23:38] soul it's a wonderful Psalm to saying
[1:23:40] but sometimes in your low and it seemed
[1:23:42] like God don't even know your address or
[1:23:44] know where you are
[1:23:45] come on Saints sometimes we get to a
[1:23:48] spot we just need a little bit of
[1:23:50] inspiration from the Lord
[1:23:51] [Applause]
[1:23:55] can you go up to arrive and grab ahold
[1:23:59] of this bounce can you grab ahold of his
[1:24:11] sword and say I don't like you leave me
[1:24:25] testing one two
[1:24:34] now to suck at Orion from a heavenly
[1:24:38] perspective
[1:24:39] Orion consists of seven major stars -
[1:24:42] for his shoulders - for his feet three
[1:24:47] for his belt each star has a name
[1:24:49] astronomers measure distance in
[1:24:51] lightyears one light years the distance
[1:24:53] light travels in one year five point
[1:24:56] eight eight trillion miles to go one
[1:25:00] light year and the Space Shuttle would
[1:25:02] take you 40,000 years the distance from
[1:25:09] the earth to the stars in Orion's belt
[1:25:12] the nearest one is GJ 30 379 it is 17
[1:25:18] light-years ninety-nine point nine six
[1:25:22] trillion miles
[1:25:31] so give up reaching to try to know the
[1:25:38] brightest star is racquel eight hundred
[1:25:42] light years away
[1:25:44] Miguel is sixty-six thousand times more
[1:25:49] powerful than our Sun a super blue giant
[1:25:55] 18 times more massive think of it
[1:25:59] the light you see from réguel some
[1:26:03] spring or winter night left réguel 250
[1:26:08] years before Columbus ever found America
[1:26:18] so in the year 1200 and something
[1:26:22] whoever made these pictures that's when
[1:26:26] the light would have left raquel
[1:26:31] overwhelming right are y'all overwhelmed
[1:26:37] everybody overwhelmed the constellation
[1:26:44] mainly consists of bright blue
[1:26:45] supergiant stars
[1:26:46] the most notable exception being the red
[1:26:49] supergiant Betelgeuse which lies in
[1:26:53] Orion's shoulder now once you look at
[1:26:56] the relativity and sighs this is
[1:26:57] Betelgeuse what a name for such a
[1:27:03] critter Betelgeuse look at the size
[1:27:08] Rogell
[1:27:09] the Sun look at your son now it's a dot
[1:27:13] can you imagine what we are brother
[1:27:15] Frank in comparison to the earth and
[1:27:17] then hone it down to you you're not even
[1:27:22] the size of a piece of lint
[1:27:27] carpet fuzz is a giant compared to oh
[1:27:44] why didn't he pick retail to be home
[1:27:48] why not Betelgeuse to be home bigger
[1:27:51] brighter but you see it's a supergiant
[1:27:56] you take a plant within so many miles of
[1:28:00] Betelgeuse even fry it in a matter of
[1:28:03] seconds so the Earth's don't have the
[1:28:06] fire it don't have the mass but it has
[1:28:10] the ability to have life
[1:28:14] oh darling if these things you're saying
[1:28:17] another man's messages right well I
[1:28:19] didn't go out do some great renowned
[1:28:20] picture why you some little
[1:28:22] insignificant speck of Kentucky dust he
[1:28:27] likes to use insignificant specks of
[1:28:30] dust Betelgeuse is also the largest star
[1:28:37] in the constellation it has 1,000 times
[1:28:40] the radius of the Sun sometimes the
[1:28:49] radius the three stars which form a line
[1:28:54] through the middle of the constellation
[1:28:56] are known as Orion's belt if you follow
[1:28:58] imaginary line down through Orion's belt
[1:29:00] it will take you to the brightest star
[1:29:01] in the night sky Sirius follow the line
[1:29:06] up in the southern hemisphere and you'll
[1:29:09] find it you imagine this job a joke
[1:29:13] think of it you are one of the people
[1:29:15] that's privileged to live in this age
[1:29:18] Abraham Adam Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses
[1:29:23] David Solomon Jeremiah Ezekiel and an
[1:29:27] eye I got none of them ever got to see a
[1:29:29] picture like this only in this age of
[1:29:34] enlightenment could people be able to
[1:29:38] see such a thing they come blessed we
[1:29:40] are Harry just to be able to see this
[1:29:42] naturally well what about supernaturally
[1:29:45] what about supernatural a brother/sister
[1:29:47] where they miss when God has opened our
[1:29:49] eyes to let us see the opening of the
[1:29:52] seven seals and the revealing of his
[1:29:54] word way in the age of the stars let me
[1:30:06] close show 38:32 can sell bring forth
[1:30:13] mazzaroth
[1:30:14] in his season him sell guy doctorís with
[1:30:22] this
[1:30:27] mazzaroth of course is the
[1:30:30] constellations Arcturus is the bear
[1:30:34] guard of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor here
[1:30:40] again God is overwhelming his servant
[1:30:45] because he needs to be unloaded friends
[1:30:49] no matter how much you love the Lord
[1:30:51] there's something left in us that still
[1:30:54] wants to question God God why this God
[1:30:58] why that how come meet God how come my
[1:31:00] husband's going through this why's my
[1:31:02] wife how come you took my wife why I got
[1:31:04] cancer I've been a Christian all this
[1:31:05] time why Lord why may God help us today
[1:31:11] tell me about our heads praise the Lord
[1:31:21] Oh Heavenly Father I know when we walk
[1:31:33] out of this place today the majority of
[1:31:38] these numbers the majority of these
[1:31:41] things that have said to them and trying
[1:31:46] to relate to them the greatness of what
[1:31:48] you've made they can't remember it
[1:31:50] they'll not recall it but hopefully
[1:31:53] they'll get the significance of it Lord
[1:31:57] and that is to proof you who hung all of
[1:32:00] this hung the moon and the stars by your
[1:32:04] word hallelujah you know our names today
[1:32:11] father what we're going through might be
[1:32:14] so tremendous to us and you do not
[1:32:18] belittle that you and your gracious
[1:32:19] mercy understand since you come to the
[1:32:22] earth as a human how it is to feel
[1:32:26] frustration and worry and trouble
[1:32:28] thank you for that Lord Lord Jesus you
[1:32:33] want to encourage us
[1:32:34] maybe there's some here today father and
[1:32:37] they're in the going through a winter
[1:32:40] cycle spiritually they're very familiar
[1:32:44] with the snowflakes that we reflected
[1:32:46] the other night the very very familiar
[1:32:48] was the hoarfrost that was showed last
[1:32:50] night in the eyes it feels like their
[1:32:54] water of life has dried up and froze
[1:32:56] over they feel so cold
[1:33:00] they prayed they get nothing they
[1:33:03] listened to tapes it seems like they get
[1:33:04] nothing they come to church and it seems
[1:33:07] like they get nothing and they're just
[1:33:09] discouraged and disheartened and it
[1:33:12] seems like everything's froze up I pray
[1:33:15] you'd strengthen them today Lord Lord
[1:33:20] Jesus may your presence encourage them
[1:33:24] Lord we know this cycle has been ongoing
[1:33:28] now for thousands of years I'm always
[1:33:32] glad when we hit January in February
[1:33:34] because I know the leaves have fallen
[1:33:37] mountains are in that ugly stage we've
[1:33:40] got a spring to look forward to I can't
[1:33:44] say wintertime is my favorite time of
[1:33:45] the year Lord I love spring summer and
[1:33:49] fall and yet there's a sadness to me
[1:33:50] about fall and we see the leaves falling
[1:33:52] turning colors we know that the
[1:33:54] harshness of winter is right on its
[1:33:57] trail we look up in the night sky and
[1:34:00] who do we see the great hunter he starts
[1:34:04] reflecting his bands of influence upon
[1:34:07] our little blue dot the nights start
[1:34:10] getting chilly and then then cold and
[1:34:12] then real cold we have to start wrapping
[1:34:15] water lines and blowing plants and that
[1:34:18] will freeze the Lord we know winter time
[1:34:21] will not always be upon the earth spring
[1:34:25] will come back around
[1:34:27] Lord Jesus may you encourage your people
[1:34:30] today not only those your present are
[1:34:35] those that are here this surface may the
[1:34:38] Spirit of God strike them Lord we know
[1:34:41] even in Canada parts of Alaska
[1:34:45] there's so much darkness in the
[1:34:47] wintertime even parts of Norway and
[1:34:50] Denmark that the people buy special
[1:34:53] light bulbs and change out in their
[1:34:56] house because they eliminate rather rays
[1:35:02] of light that help relieve people of
[1:35:05] depression because so much darkness Oh
[1:35:10] Lord Jesus we look around and we see the
[1:35:14] darkness around us Lord it's in the
[1:35:18] churches it's in the world it's in
[1:35:19] politics everywhere we look it's around
[1:35:24] us you didn't give us a light bulb but
[1:35:28] you sent us a star praise God and that
[1:35:33] star illuminated our paths thank you
[1:35:37] Lord Jesus
[1:35:39] and it helped drive away part of the
[1:35:42] depression in the darkness of layer to
[1:35:45] see of living in this age we have senior
[1:35:49] star in the West and we have come to
[1:35:54] worship not the star
[1:35:56] but you because that star never led us
[1:36:00] to himself he pointed us to you Jesus
[1:36:05] Christ the Son of God Oh Lord Jesus may
[1:36:11] your bright rays enter into these hearts
[1:36:14] and lives today
[1:36:16] blessed Lamb of God as we close the
[1:36:18] service out last night here this Sun
[1:36:23] beautiful bright ball of fire and yet
[1:36:27] the greater serves the lesser we do not
[1:36:31] serve the Sun we give nothing to the Sun
[1:36:35] no color no water no ambience we give
[1:36:41] nothing and yet we could not survive
[1:36:44] without the Sun so the greater serve
[1:36:49] the lesser Lord God we think of you
[1:36:52] coming to the earth it was the greater
[1:36:55] that come to redeem the lesser but you
[1:37:00] picked us up and redeemed us and in so
[1:37:02] much that Paul said in Hebrews that you
[1:37:05] are not ashamed to call us brothers to
[1:37:11] call us brothers praise God
[1:37:16] a little speck of dust whirling out in
[1:37:20] eternity and yet the Spirit of God
[1:37:24] called us to yourself
[1:37:27] we're thank you Lord I may not to
[1:37:31] remember before the Lord today just
[1:37:33] raise your hand would you you believe

[1:45:48] places of your word or God it breaks my
