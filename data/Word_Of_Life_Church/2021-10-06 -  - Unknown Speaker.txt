greet you today in the name of the lord jesus let's turn to the book of job chapter 1 verse 13. job chapter 1 verse 13. setting of our reading today is in the land of us us was located in the western part of the arabian desert near the country of chaldea the bible says in job 1 and 1 and there was a man whose name was job and he was a perfect man upright before god he feared god and skewed evil which means that he voided stayed away from evil and verse 13 says and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and there came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses were feeding beside them and the sabians fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee now that would be a pretty bad situation but notice verse 15 while he was yet speaking more bad news there came also another and said the fire of god notice the fire of god is fallen from heaven wow pretty impressive huh the fire of god has fallen from heaven and it's burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell thee let's put our heads together if we pray lord jesus we thank you today for your great word we're so thankful father in your word contains history it's a love story it's a historical book it's a book of geography it's a book of people's wrongs it's a book of promises it's a book of comfort in it lord contains so many wonderful wonderful things and we thank you for your precious book today i pray that you would help me to be able to reach into the history into the drama into the aspects of great people of faith to be able to bring something that will be a help to your people today father we all are needy i've heard many needs expressed already lord i'm thinking of those that are still dealing with sicknesses and things in their body for those father who are still dealing with loved ones that have gone on yesterday lord having to go over to virginia and bury another young man 28 years old from a good godly family to short family i pray for them today lord that you would just help them may the spirit of god comfort their hearts and strengthen them as well as others in our assembly here today and around the world we believe you're the god who can comfort us when no one else can speak to us today father we ask in the name of the lord jesus and the saints of god said amen amen god bless you you may be seated keep your bible there and let's continue reading in verse 17. so the first messenger says that they were plowing with the oxen and they were feeding the asses and the sabians came and took them all away while he was yet speaking another one came and said the fire of god has come down from heaven and burned up all the sheep and the servants were also burned up verse 17 says while he was yet speaking i want you to think of what a scenario that this must have been the man did not have a couple of days a couple of weeks or a month to go from one great traumatic thing to another but one messenger standing there and giving him this terrible awful news and while he is yet speaking another one comes in the door and starts telling him more bad news now i want to speak to you again today on the absolute and you better believe job needed one while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yay and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only and escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine and their eldest brothers house and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men word actually men there's people so it's the young people job's family and servants and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tilt thee it shows that awful things can happen to good people and not just one or two things every now and then but one blow after another after another now remember job is actually the oldest book in the bible older than genesis so genesis was not written when this happened to job as a matter of fact job had no written word he had no bible no quotes no tapes no quote books no pastor no deacon he had no committee to come and encourage him but job had an absolute amen now the way is that the writer we're not even sure who actually wrote the book of job but he writes it in such a way to project the mysterious part about the will of god so the wind come and here's proof again that satan is the prince of the power of the air as he is churning today down in the gulf of mexico with a cat 4 hurricane that will be making landfall sometime this evening and we know that since man fell and gave away his title deed to the earth then satan became the prince of the power of the air so he has ability to stir up wind and he understands barometric pressure straight line winds and vertical and horizontal winds and the way that they move he understands the way that sun is able to warm the temperature and cause the thermal waves to move the way they come over the mountains and so on so he knows a lot about this earth hemisphere stratosphere all that we're living in so he gets into all of that to be able to manipulate it but he loves to do these things and then turn around and blame it on god and if you read your insurance policy if it's like mine and probably most of those in america it will have those little small words that are written in the fine print called an act of god now let me just tell you today it is not our father that is down there in hurricane ida that is going to make landfall and do all kinds of destruction and take all kinds of people's lives but satan loves to do those things and then hide behind the name of god or the act of god as you can see the writer here and one of these verses called the fire that come down out of heaven fire from god no doubt they attributed the great wind and this was quite normal and is so even today and this part of the desert that the winds can start moving in in the desert and i've spent time myself in the desert and it's amazing how it can be so hot during the day and then as it begins to cool and the temperatures drop and how the same place can be so cold at night and even without trees and without great bodies of water to be able to regulate and affect the barometric pressure and the condensation necessary for storms yet the winds can travel for hundreds and hundreds of miles and this is no doubt what happened one of the winds that would be a norm over the western part of the desert in saudi arabia and it came while all of job's children were gathered together now we know this great event transpired uh because there had been a meeting which had taken place now let's look at all of the losses in one day and i would like to challenge any individual who is here today or under the sound of my voice streaming if any of you have had equivalent to this or more please email me and if you are here present and you've had equivalent to this or more happen to you in one day please raise your hand and we will signify that you are a person of great faith i don't say that derogatory now i say it because i believe and mean it and one day he lost seven sons and three daughters now i've had a lot of funerals to preach in the last few weeks but how would you like to been the preacher that preached those ten children of one man and one woman and he was not a backslider he was not a hypocrite he was not a secret sinner he was the most righteous noble man in the land is that right [Applause] seven sons and three daughters and one day i wrote this down so be sure and remember it job was stripped of his wealth 500 yoke of oxen 500 donkeys 3 000 camels seven thousand sheep were struck by lightning and all ten children by a windstorm now he was not allowed a span of time in between each of these now we all are familiar with trauma and we're familiar with distress and we know how that it triggers something within not only our spirit but our bodies and we've all seen so much of it more than our share i'm sure we feel that way and as we've been been dealing with uh several people passing away and we see the loved ones in the family whether it be a wife or a husband or sons or granddaughters or whatever it is and we stand there and we watch them and you know sometimes as a minister and us as i stand near where they are i feel like i'm on a sacred ground as it were that really no other mortal should experience because you're you're entering into something that is so deep and something that is so private between this this person and this loved one that is gone or this family and you were there and you're watching their body tremble and shake and you cannot see it because we're limited by our sight of seeing their spirit but how their spirit is so affected by this and even if they're not emotional people they will shake and tremble many times quiver they will buckle their knees or buckle and they will cry and they will mourn and lament and it's because of this trauma and this trauma is not just psychological it is psychological but it is emotional it is physical it contacts every aspect of our being and it feels like that it becomes so great that you do not want to live i'm sure there's people sitting here today whose loss has been not so far away and some of you are still trying to focus on what am i going to do with the rest of my life my life is of no value because the love of my wife whether it was your husband or your wife is taken from me i have nothing to live for i have nothing that i feel like will ever bring me joy or happiness again but let me speak to you today and tell you as your brother if you will allow god if god in his wisdom took that family member from you then our god makes no mistakes we believe that but yet we know in times of such pain and sorrow and agony it can be hard for us to look at a scenario and say how could this be the will of god how could something that has brought such sorrow such difficulty and such trouble ever bring honor and glory and praise to god and i agree with you there are times in our lives that we have to look by the eyes of faith and look beyond what we are dealing with currently and presently and be able to say somehow that god will work this for our good i want you to notice now in job chapter 1 verse 20 then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground is this man out of his mind and worshipped he just lost thousands of sheep hundreds of donkeys hundreds thousands of camels he's lost seven sons and three daughters and his reaction is worship i wonder if he didn't understand something about worship that we are yet to learn because it's so hard for us when things are difficult for us to worship now we can feel it in the church and we know the church has been through a great time of trauma we can sense it spiritually but i can also see it in your worship i can see it when you come in and you sit down and the song leaders can feel it the musicians can feel it the people streaming can feel it they can feel the heaviness that is upon us as a body is that normal and natural it is if it's not then there's something wrong with us but yet i believe there's also a key during the time of our great trauma and difficulty and that is the key and the power of praise that we praise him when we feel like it and we praise him when we don't we praise him when things are going good and we praise him when things are going bad [Music] now job had learned somehow by this revelation that god had given to him there was great great power and praise now remember he didn't have a bible so psalms 150 was not written yet psalms 133 psalms 48 many of the great praise psalms of the old testament job knew none of them the gospel songs that you and i sing about today they were not written there were nobody there to be able to come and comfort him while they called job's comforters actually turned out to be tormentors so he really didn't have anybody even his beloved wife which had given birth to these 10 children eventually she turned against him as well and yet at the beginning at least in the stage of this great thing job was able to keep this balance and listened and said naked came out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly. now no doubt in his mind his wanting now this is initial stage of course of the trial and we know that job and time became changed because trials can do that to us as they are prolonged and as they keep on going and it seems like there's no reprieve it can affect our spirit it can affect our worship it can affect our understanding it can affect our psychological view it can affect so much about us even as the children of god and this is why it's so important to keep our praise going even when things aren't good because the lord jesus is praiseworthy no matter what you're dealing with but you know job unlike us today in retrospect we can look back and read the book of job and we know of course what was going on but job did not know that remember the book of job was not written so job unlike you having the book of revelation you're able to read in the back of the book you can flip over to the back and you see the back and you see the devil is going to be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone and you see that we're going to have new bodies and we're going to live forever so we have these things to look forward to because we have a written word job had not one page of written scripture so he did not have the verse that said i will never leave you or never forsake you i will be with you all the way to the end of the world job did not have the scripture delight thyself also in the lord and he will give thee the desires of thine heart job did not have the scripture beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as our soul prospers job had none of these things and yet job still had an absolute now where was his absolute act it was not written it was not on a piece of sheepskin or written on a stone it was not on an ipad it was not upon some type of magnetic tape but yet he had to have something in order to get him through this trial where was it it was within him now it was a revelation from god that god had given a simple way to be holy in that day and job had kept it and he believed god would keep his word now job did not know also about this prior meeting which was held in heaven turn with me if you would if job chapter 1 verse 6. now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan once cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it now if you want to know what the long tongue blabber mouth does day by day he just told us he goes up and down through the earth and walking up and down in it what is he a troublemaker he's a covet maker he likes to bring divorce he likes to bring sickness and trouble and all kinds of heartache look friend covered oh satan loves every aspect of covet he loves not only the aspect of sickness and the disease part and the death part that it brings to many but he loves the confusion that covet brings he loves that people get on facebook and argue about it he loves it because one doctor says this and another doctor says that and this person will say this and another person will say that he loves for people to be confused he loves for people to argue well i wish somebody would preach with me this morning he loves for them to argue and first look let's be spiritual enough to realize whenever satan is the author of this we ought to be grown up enough to know that whenever satan tries to bring contention division in our church it's not from god it's from the devil so satan walking up and down in the earth and he's doing the same thing today now i want you to notice this in the lord and verse 8 said unto satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and askus evil then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for not in other words you're kind to job and you're giving him things and that's the reason that he's serving you that's the reason it ain't really because he loves you with all of his heart he's serving you because he got all these children he's got all these cattle he's got all this wealth then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for naught hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he has he will curse thee to thy face so god gives a testimony of what job is satan gives a testimony of what job will do right which one's going to win now that we have to give credit for the devil we can knock him down we can beat the tar out of him and he still gets back up and he's ready on monday morning more unlikely be ready after service today so no matter what god said and what a positive affirmative action that god took toward job satan somehow still believed that he would be able to bend job away from this testimony that god had now isn't it wonderful that almighty god testifies about people this way in heaven some of y'all scared to say amen to that ain't you now it's a tremendous thing that god now remember this is before the blood of the lord jesus job did not have a new birth he did not have a baptism of the holy ghost but he did have an absolute for that day and that absolute for that day kept job through what he was fixing to go through so god knew the integrity of his servant and god knew the man's heart but satan only thought he knew job's heart now to me this is where a lot of it comes in that satan does not have omnipotent power to look into the soul and into the nature of a human being satan studies this and of course and he sees our weaknesses and tendencies that each of us have and he's saying well if god would get this out of the way and remove this hedge then i can really crank down the pressure on that old boy and i'll see his weakness i see that strain that runs in his family i see that strain that runs in her family and if god will take back his hand i believe i can make him compromise i believe i can make her bow down to me but god said no you came now brother bam tells us the reason that god knew job this way was that he had been fellowshipping with job oh what a testimony to have so god and job had been testifying now this didn't happen about five minutes now before the trial but god and job had been big time friends so god and job had been buddies as we would say and that had fellowship one with another and god revealed the absolute for that day to job now it has not been revealed to his family it had not been revealed to his wife apparently and it had not been revealed to his friends only elohim christ of course was the one that connected with the absolute of the day so job was the only man of that day that the revelation had come clear to so god had said nope you can't do it i know him i've been fellowshipping with him we've been hanging around one another as we'd say and then why i know job job knows me and satan now notice so satan says and the lord said unto satan behold all that he has is in thy power all that he has is in thy power let me just tell you something this morning friends even satan cannot do something to god's people without god allowing him or giving him permission now remember the hedge was the power of the word now it was not that there was a rail like this or a concrete block wall or a titanium fence or something like that but the hedge was an invisible hedge by the spoken word now when god said all that he has is in your power god is simply drawing back the hedge which was the power of the word so once god allowed satan through the word and he says all right i will give everything that he has is in your power so the hedge which was the word was pulled back and only only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord now we know that there's different names in the old testament that identify the name of god he was el ella elohim it was el shaddai he was uh you know many many different titles name but the book of job it's really amazing the way that the writer writes this because he calls him almighty god now this is used 31 times actually right here in the first few verses of this setting force of these couple of chapters so the writer wants us to know that who is in charge of this whole scenario is the almighty god now it is not just el shaddai jehovah jehovah shalom jehovah's canoe but it is the almighty god so this shows us when we go through great trauma and great trials of life that it is the almighty god that is watching over us and remember satan might want to get you to think he is almighty but he is a liar there's only one almighty god and that's your father is that right so god now is going to do something that seems very very strange that he's going to turn a man and his property and his possessions over to the power of the enemy that the enemy might be able to touch him brother raymond says that this one the absolute look of job now he had an absolute everything went wrong for that man a just man and would be darrison to say that he wasn't just because god said he was there was no one on earth like job he was perfect in the sight of god and he knew it now notice he was perfect in the sight of god and he knew it now this is important when you're facing a battle when you are facing a battle of great trauma in your life you must know that god knows where you are and you must also know that you have a right standing with the lord now myself when i'm going through something i'm trying to discern by the spirit of god is this a trial that i'm going through or is this something of disobedience that i've done to the lord have i said something that i shouldn't have said did i not say something i should have said or you have a miss the lord somehow and whenever i go to the lord and prayer lord please help me to see this because if god's allowing me to go through something i don't want to rebuke it right but if satan is punching after me i don't want him to hide one of his punches behind what he calls a trial when it's not a trial at all it's just him trying to steal my victory so it's important for myself and also important for you to go to the lord lord please help me is this a trial of my faith or have i done something wrong lord are you allowing something to come upon me as a whip well if that's so lord that i don't want to rebuke it so i go before the lord and i pray and i pray and you know many times the lord doesn't tell me anything he doesn't say yes or no or one of the above or i don't give him a whole list to chat so the lord says absolutely nothing to me anybody ever been there oh okay i figured there'd been more than that i didn't realize the lord spoke to all the rest of you now i know why you don't have time to talk to me so myself i do not take silence as god did not hear me i do not take silence is god ignoring me but if i sincerely am asking my father father is there something i've done wrong is there something out of cater in my life lord help me to know is there something there's just something i need to make right i take my father's silence as an answer that there's nothing there because i know him and i know that he loves me and i love him and if i sincerely am asking him and there's something i got to straighten out he knows there's no way for me to straighten it out if he don't tell me what it is so if he does not answer me i don't say oh no oh no god's forsaking me oh no he ain't answering it yes he did answer me by his silence you say that's crazy no it's not paul said in the new testament about the women not being able to preach paul said as also saith the law but when you get time i want you to go through every verse of the law and i want you to find me one word not a verse but one word in the hebrew where it said women were not allowed to speak the torah i want you to find me one word where it said they were not allowed to speak well either that you take my word for it the word does not say they can't but it does not say they can so paul was quoting the silence of the law well praise the lord so the silence of the law as where he substantiates in the new testament that women cannot get in the pulpit and preach well praise god so the silence of the law then was where he's able to verify this and it ought to be the same with you and i would pray with all of our hearts and if the lord doesn't tell you anything apparently that means there's nothing to tell there's nothing in your way there's nothing out of cater so then you know how to approach that that god in his wisdom is allowing you to go through a trial then you can hold your head up during that trial and trust that god will give you grace and strength remember that job was a man of great great faith and great position he was the greatest man in the east at this time so he was a man of noble character and no doubt surrounded by great people and job said whenever he would go to the marketplace that the people would come up and all just to be able to speak to him and get a word or two of his wisdom because he was a man of great resound wisdom and understanding and just for them older brother joe how are you god bless you brother god bless you could you you got a word for us today from the lord god have you got something you'd like to drop with us and my they just they just be in awe of this man's presence but god had a great plan for job and it wasn't just blessing but it was to prove his faith now job is unaware of what you and i just read if god would have said no way but job don't get all upset because i'm just going to let you know what's going on here uh i had a testimony of eating about you up in heaven and i was testifying about what a great boy i had done on the earth how faithful you were how true you were how honest sincere and so on and then my enemy challenged my testimony so the enemy challenged the testimony service and i figured out the best way to resolve this this testimony dispute was to prove you before him and prove he is a liar don't you understand god many times uses our lives to prove that the devil ain't nothing but a lying devil that's going to hell and going to be burnt up one day and he ain't going to use angels to prove it he's going to use children of god like you and i that cry and weep and lament and have burdens and troubles and heartaches absolutely that's the way our father does it once you notice again the prophet said when everything seemed to be contrary sickness broke out his friends might have said now there your job that proves you are sinning you're wrong and then the bishops come down and they call job's comforters instead of comforting him they see nothing but sin in his life because god had dealt with him the way that he did his children was killed his property was burned everything went wrong even his own life in jeopardy setting on an ashy oh my broke out from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet with boils and his lovely sweet companion the mother of those children said you should curse god and die the death but in the face of all that job had an absence [Applause] happy valley what's yours every individual what's your absolute well mama and daddy mom and dad is good but you better have a deeper absolute in your soul mama can't get in your soul notice this he said in the time of sickness if we could only tie ourselves to that absolute job know that he had done jehovah's bidding he had faith in what he had done because jehovah required it if we can just do that jehovah required to burn offering for his sin and job not only for himself but for his children had made a burn offering and that's all god required all you might say i wish that's all he required of today it's less than that just faith in his word god requires less of you and i today than he did of job just faith and what god says oh if you make his words your absolute any divine promise of the bible you can die your soul to it no matter how much the waves whip you around you're still tied to your absolute no we know of course at phase one of this trial that job proved faithful his integrity was right exactly where god had said it would be but we know the trial goes on and it intensifies job chapter 2 verse 3 and the lord said unto satan as i'll consider my servant job there's none like him in the earth perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and excuse evil now god updates the testimony oh glory to god if you'll notice god says word for word what he said before but job had sent a fresh update to heaven and god updated his testimony because of the behavior of his son praise be to god praise be to god and still he holdeth fast his integrity oh my now god must update now god didn't just say the same thing that he said last time but god gave a revised version amen of what was going on he wanted to let the devil know now god wasn't just saying what he had said but he was saying what he had said plus what job did and that made the new declaration or the mandate of the day the logos so hear god can you imagine almighty god quoting almighty god quoting the success of the life of a believer on the earth that has come through such trauma and come through such difficulty and it's so moved the very being of adonai that he upgraded the testimony and the confidence that he had to say oh my as we do in the testimony well i want to thank god today that the lord saved me and gave me the holy ghost and the lord done this or that or the other and then you go through a trial and maybe you get a chance again in a month or two i'd like to testify and say thank god for saving me thank god for giving me the holy ghost thank god for bringing me through this trial i just come through what are you doing you're acting like god you're updating what god has brought you through and god said i want to let you know devil i've got a son down on the earth he wasn't just faithful but he still is faithful he is faithful to my word he has his integrity he believes what i said all children i wonder what papa has been saying about us in the last few weeks we've given him a lot to say over the years but he don't want to just repeat the past he wants to update what's the present see this is the kind of child of god that you and i ought to want to be to wear that our father just just doesn't repeat our initial testimony that we were saved from sin filled with the holy ghost and accept the message of the hour and god says the same thing about us for the next 75 years i don't want that or i love that but i want it added to i said i want it added to oh my my my i want my testimony so reverberating in heaven that god weekly because that's how often it seems like i'm getting hit anymore my don't you you understand what i'm saying you've heard me say it before boy it seemed like years and years ago the mountaintops my my you'd get up on them it was just days and weeks and months up on a mountaintop and then you go back down the valley and up on the mountaintop but anymore it's like this you better be careful you better not sleep you'll be a shore mountain shore as a world and them valleys are longer and deeper my and they're more depressed than they ever were before but i want almighty god to be able to say about me to be able to say about our church satan have you took notice of happy valley [Applause] [Music] they're still loving me they're still praising me they're still going to church they don't understand they don't understand this they don't understand that but satan they're still living for me you said they'd turn their back on me you said the pastor would compromise once again he burnt your head again this morning devil my children worshiped me they loved me they praised me they are proving what i already said you are a liar [Applause] he still hold us fast his integrity although thou movest me against him i'll tell you one thing france we have got quite an enemy now all right but don't fear him you're more than conquerors although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause if almighty god could say this about a man before the shed blood of the lord jesus what can god say about blood wash saints filled with the holy ghost hallelujah now watch old bible mouse and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin all that a man has he will give for his life but put forth on hand now and touch his bone in his flesh and he'll curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life so satan went forth from the presence of the lord i want you to notice satan told god to do it you see he's a master of impersonation but i want you to notice who did it satan run forth from the presence of the lord and smote job the sore boils from the soul of his foot and to his crown and he took him a pot shed which is a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself with all and set down among the ashes then said his wife unto him thus i'll retain thine integrity lord have mercy children if you got a good wife or a good husband who in the world would you confide in more who would be a greater comfort to you there are all the trials and things you're going through then your companion and satan got on her oh but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speakers what shall we receive good at the hand of god shall we not receive evil and all this did not job sin i want you to notice with what oh some of you don't smoke you don't drink whiskey you don't do marijuana this that another but you're saying right here ain't talking about cussing i'm talking about speaking out under the undefeat of defeat rather than unbelief but god don't let me god don't care for me you're sinning with your mouth when you say that you're saying things that are not true oh my god now notice the news makes it over to job's three friends job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came every one from his own place elephants the team of night bill bildad the shut so far the nephite for they had made an appointment to come together to mourn with him and to comfort him they've been better off state the house wouldn't they now listen in verse 12 and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not harry he was so disfigured by disease he was so changed by affliction the last time they'd seen him mob still had that crown of life and no doubt his skin was a healthy color and his spirit was vibrant oh he had just something to spring in his step and he had his health but his friends can you imagine them as their sin and they they come upon job's estate brother wayne as they walk up near they see the fences are broken down and they see his crops are all withered his trees and his shrubs around his house was in horrible shape the shingles as you can relate to it had blowed off of his roof his doors are hanging sideways on his house there was no one there to meet them and the closer they got job was sitting out in the yard throwing dust and ashes upon himself which was their custom as a sign of grief and they say looked and looked they said oh god oh god no that can't be joke they didn't even recognize you imagine big boys open sores which would make scabs and then he would take the pot shared and rub the scabs off to try to make them heal his wife had got bitter against him honey would you bring me a drink job said i spoke to my servants but they refused me hey so and so out in the barn come and bring me some shame i'm hungry the servants laughed mocked his wife's voice her breasts became strange to him so he just set her turn scrape himself and mourn oh [Music] what have i done what have i done not one thing wrong how can this picture make sense his cattle are gone his wealth is gone his children is gone his wife is there but she's gone to in reality she's gone from his heart his sermons are still hanging around but they're gone too and he seemed like god it's gone and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven his sickness and trials and so emaciated his body you imagine his skin all drawed up skinny his skin just pulled over a frame of the shell of a man that he was his face sunk in his eyes circles around his eyes blacks in the bottom poor old fellow sitting out turn the flies blowing him coming and eating the pus the most righteous man on the earth the most perfect man you see why laodicea don't like this kind of preaching their idea of the most perfect man on the earth is a guy that's got a set of rolls-royce keys lives in a ten thousand square foot house that's just his little summer cottage oh but he's this and that and the other because that's what laodicea considers blessings i ask you which would you rather have the mouse of god to testify about you in heaven and look like you have nothing in this earth or to be the richest man on the earth and god almighty to say about you i do not know you give me the other amen notice this friends verse 13 so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake away unto him they were so affected by what they saw they just couldn't believe it but they didn't know what to say they just sat there day one day two day three day four they fought armed for seven days never said one word i've had a few of them comforters around ain't you and sometimes some of the words they say you'd been better off they've kept their mouth shut how did this man take it the absolute almighty god spoke to him in a rhema word and said do this and you will be just you remember reading in the first chapter how that the bible says that the sons and the daughters had gathered together at the eldest son's house and they drank wine and they were eating and job said per adventure my children might have done something wrong periadventure they might have said something wrong or they might have got carried away and they might have done something wrong against god and job applied the token to his house hallelujah don't give up on them children of yours or their waiver brother down in their backseat they may be now but it might be your faith that will move on their heart and bring them back in don't give up on them friends joel believed that god not only gave this to him but he believed he gave him his children you imagine as they come up and they sat down cross-legged as they would sit at that time and they just stared and stared and stared what is going to their mind this man is a sinner there's something wrong with him i always felt funny about him anyway i always knew there's something about him i hate that kind of discernment don't you but their testimony one matching gods you see when they went to criticizing job when they went to saying all these things against him every word they said against the percentage of job was blasphemy compared to what god said when things are going wrong for people be careful what you say it's easy for us to pass jeff oh there must be something wrong that person must be something wrong there must be something wrong with there may not be nothing wrong at all god may have done had a testimony meeting up here in heaven and they're fulfilling what god said about them well god god moved for this brother dawn and god healed this brother of coven and then god let this other one go on that's right and the same people prayed for both so you know what we have to do we have to commit it to the wisdom and the providence of god that apparently god wanted to heal this one and take this one home because the devil cannot do anything to us without permission from the hand of god do i understand where we are do i understand everything we're going through i do not but i know my father well enough to know he is not a god of chaos he is not a god of trouble he is not a god of confusion and i know the devil well enough to know he cannot take you our eye until our father is done with us and when god is done with me in life i'm finished with life let's stand don't worry we'll get old job took care of you just i love the way brother ram says this in page 13 then when he come to that spot when that absolute hell finally he begin to feel the string tighten up it's been running loose now so you'll understand the setting of this brother random had talked about a man that was walking down the street one day and he's seen a little boy with a string in his hand and the man asked the little boy sonny what are you doing he said i'm flying a kite well he said i can't see no kite he said well no i don't see it either he said how do you know it's there he said i feel the pool [Applause] and the string is tied to the absolute brother bam said so he identified the kite as being the absolute and the string is tied to the absolute so every now and then we feel a little tug aren't you glad you still feel the tug so i can't see it i don't know where it's at it's so far out of sight this is what had happened to job brother ben said he began to feel the string tighten up that had been running loose bouncing around and it began to tighten up and the spirit come on him and he stood up being a prophet and said i know my redeemer liveth he tightened up to his absolute he'd come in contact maybe the wind's friends in the last few weeks or months whatever it is has blowed around you you you don't feel that pull it's just exactly right the tension made the holy ghost come by this morning and let it tighten up a little bit oh i don't know about you sometimes i love to dance and shout but sometimes it does my heart so much good just to feel a little pull just a little tug sometimes it don't take nuts oh girl really god brother jimmy it don't take much just just a little something every now and then yep it's still there i don't see it i don't feel it i don't smell it i don't taste it but i know it's there why i still feel the pull on the string amen this marriott lord jesus oh father god i know this has been a simple thing today but i felt in my heart to go this way so simple as it may be yet i believe sent by you to our needs so father i pray you'd help each man woman boy or girl young person that's going through a trial a testing time and we know that many are and have been father our country our world has been under this demon of covet lord it's certainly not affected us the way it has others in many other places we know that but we have had

oh father i pray you would help us sometimes the wind blows around us lord god can't keep from alarming us as humans you yourself when you knew you were facing deaths in the book of hebrews tells us that you feared it you allowed yourself to experience fear help us father when satan will send his hounds of hell as it were and they blow their hot breaths right on our trail and we're saying oh god they're going to get us they're going to get us but may we stand still and know that we have an absolute oh how we thank you for the bible how we thank you for every message book ever tape we have every god called man every church every pastor but how we thank you also for that personal absolute that we have in our soul the baptism of the holy ghost that seals us to the day of our redemption

our boast and we wind up in the bottom of the atlantic ocean but we confess what the word says upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it so it's not our
