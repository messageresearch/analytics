[15:10] [Music]
[15:12] oh oh all things are
[15:20] possible
[15:23] [Music]
[15:27] only
[15:33] that is so simple and yet so
[15:37] powerful we know that we've set aside
[15:39] these uh particular services for
[15:41] questions and answers but we just need
[15:44] to keep in mind that while we're
[15:46] here um the Lord is mindful of every
[15:49] need that we have there may be a need
[15:51] that will lay outside the confines of
[15:55] these questions and answers but if you
[15:59] have a need that does if we can be
[16:01] sensitive and believe and just reach out
[16:04] to the Lord tonight I believe he can
[16:06] move me in a direction for two minutes
[16:09] three minutes five minutes whatever it
[16:11] need be to be able to minister to you
[16:14] not only to you but there's many many
[16:16] more that stream in this service than
[16:18] what there is here in this visible
[16:19] audience so we say the same thing to
[16:22] them as well certainly privileged for us
[16:24] to be gathered together like this
[16:26] tonight we're so grateful
[16:29] uh not been that long ago don't seem
[16:31] like that we was having to have service
[16:33] and on the holiday in and such an
[16:36] inconvenience the brothers having to
[16:38] take the music down um many services
[16:41] after every service set it back up again
[16:43] we couldn't have of course special
[16:45] services like this and I'm just so happy
[16:47] the Lord's give us our own place back
[16:49] again aren't
[16:51] you I'm going to start tonight with this
[16:54] um this question I want you to listen to
[16:57] the question carefully because it's it's
[16:58] a little bit unusual but it was um a
[17:01] question that that was U sent to me by a
[17:04] couple of different people that were
[17:06] talking about this subject so I thought
[17:09] instead of just answering them
[17:11] individuals that I would um answer it
[17:14] before you all and also for the for the
[17:17] whole church since it affects um several
[17:20] people in our church Someone told me
[17:23] that breeding dogs cannot offer tithes
[17:27] for this kind kind of service because
[17:30] God doesn't want money from these things
[17:34] can you explain and you can see there
[17:36] that breeding dogs can offer tithe in
[17:39] this kind of service because God doesn't
[17:41] expect money from these two things can
[17:43] you please explain because we have
[17:46] people in our church that breed
[17:49] dogs for a living is breeding dogs wrong
[17:55] now this is the
[17:56] scripture that uh the indiv indviduals
[17:58] both of them actually sent to me there
[18:01] shall be no
[18:03] whor of the daughters of
[18:06] Israel nor a
[18:09] sodomite of the sons of Israel and then
[18:12] the next verse Thou shalt not bring the
[18:16] hire of a
[18:18] or the price of a
[18:22] dog which seems really
[18:24] odd that you talk about
[18:27] prostitution and talk about a Bow
[18:31] Wow but actually this word is not a
[18:35] four-legged
[18:37] dog anybody know what it
[18:39] means you do Rob Carol is okay Thou
[18:42] shalt not bring the hire of a or
[18:44] the price of a dog into the house of the
[18:48] Lord thy God for any vow for even both
[18:52] these are an Abomination to the Lord thy
[18:56] God let's just pray together again and
[18:58] we'll answer this question by the help
[19:00] of the Lord Jesus we thank you tonight
[19:01] for your mercy to us Lord thank you that
[19:04] we could be gathered together again Lord
[19:06] just such an honor to stand before young
[19:09] people who have a desire to come they
[19:11] were just here last night but they
[19:13] wanted to come again and I'm sure others
[19:15] wanted to and they couldn't for whatever
[19:17] reason but we pray that you just be
[19:19] mindful of us Lord and those that are
[19:21] streaming the service would you help us
[19:23] to understand thank you Father for these
[19:25] questions and I pray that you'd help me
[19:27] to move us side that I would be able to
[19:29] answer them in the correct way granted
[19:31] father I ask in Jesus name amen God
[19:34] bless you you can be seated now let's um
[19:39] let's look at this uh verse 17 again now
[19:42] I ask you this question it would seem
[19:44] kind of strange and odd but once once I
[19:46] go to giving the meanings of the word
[19:48] it's pretty much a
[19:50] self-explanatory but whenever we would
[19:52] read it especially in the English
[19:54] language we would tend to think that God
[19:59] um was talking about dog raising but
[20:02] this was a Canaanite practice that was
[20:05] very common especially among the
[20:08] Canaanites that worshiped and had a
[20:11] goddess of fertility most of the
[20:14] Canaanites had gods and goddesses and
[20:17] there were many of them they were plural
[20:20] so if they had a goddess which was a
[20:24] goddess um that they wanted to bless
[20:26] their crops their children
[20:28] and all that sort of thing may seem very
[20:30] very weird and strange to us but they
[20:33] would actually have Temple prostitutes
[20:36] both male and female and whenever you
[20:39] would come to bring an offering to this
[20:42] goddess the most common one was asteroth
[20:46] as it changed of course down through a
[20:47] time it became a sty but it was the same
[20:50] God began with the the Phoenicians but
[20:53] um each one of them developed their own
[20:55] so it was the goddess of fertility
[20:58] so whenever you would come to worship
[21:00] then and bring an offering a sacrifice
[21:03] then they would also have these male and
[21:06] female prostitutes that was there and
[21:10] they was not there for any good reason
[21:12] you can imagine what they were there for
[21:15] so they were there to worship this
[21:16] invisible goddess and they were there to
[21:18] bring an offering and they were also
[21:20] there to partake of prostitution so they
[21:24] felt like that by doing that that would
[21:26] bring them fertility to their lands to
[21:28] their children and so on so now let's
[21:31] read this verse 17 Again there shall be
[21:34] no wh of the daughters of Israel now I
[21:38] know sometimes the Bible can use very
[21:40] plain language and the Bible of course
[21:42] wants it to be clear so it's easy to
[21:44] understood but I want you to look at the
[21:46] meaning of this now remember the Old
[21:48] Testament was written in Hebrew and the
[21:50] New Testament was written in Greek so
[21:53] the word here is Kesha Kesha and it
[21:57] means means a female Temple prostitute
[22:03] or a harlot so there shall be no
[22:07] of the daughters of Israel nor a
[22:11] sodomite of the sons of Israel now look
[22:14] at the meaning of this word very similar
[22:17] kadash which was a male Temple
[22:23] prostitute so God said there be no male
[22:25] no of the daughters of Israel or a
[22:28] sodomite of the sons of Israel now look
[22:31] it jumps down to verse 17 and it would
[22:33] seem to be opposites but actually verse
[22:36] 17 and verse 18 are talking about the
[22:38] same thing Thou shalt not bring the hire
[22:42] of a now it may seem very weird to
[22:46] us but apparently there was the tendency
[22:50] or the possibility because Israel did
[22:52] get into this eventually and they got
[22:55] into many of these false gods and some
[22:58] of them were going to be so farfetched
[23:01] in their minds and so perverted that
[23:03] they were going to either prostitute
[23:06] themselves or they were going to pimp
[23:08] out their daughters and their
[23:10] granddaughters and so on and then
[23:12] whenever they would make the money off
[23:15] of this prostitution they would actually
[23:17] want to pay tithes off of this
[23:20] prostitution now that shows how corrupt
[23:23] that a human being could be now we would
[23:25] think people would become so VI like
[23:28] that they just get away from God and
[23:30] don't want nothing to do with God but
[23:32] whenever a person gets a religious
[23:34] spirit on them they're actually seven
[23:36] times worse than just a rank sinner
[23:39] because then they get religion and they
[23:41] get evil mixed together so God wanted
[23:44] this to be established don't bring this
[23:46] to me because I will not accept this
[23:50] tithing of this type of the life but
[23:53] then you think well why would God then
[23:55] talk about the high of a female
[23:58] prostitute and then talking about
[24:01] selling a dog and making money off of a
[24:05] dog Thou shalt not bring the hire of a
[24:09] or the
[24:11] price of a dog but look at the meaning
[24:14] of the word
[24:17] dog dog literal or it can mean contempt
[24:23] or abasement or a male
[24:29] cult
[24:31] prostitute a male cult prostitute so
[24:35] both 17 and 18 are speaking the exact
[24:40] same thing so the price of a dog here
[24:43] that the Bible is referring to is not
[24:45] money obtained from the sale of a dog
[24:48] but rather a male prostitute which God
[24:52] called a male
[24:53] prostitute a
[24:56] dog so I guess I wonder then today
[24:59] whenever we've got um males and females
[25:04] that stand in a lot of the
[25:05] denominational churches that are
[25:08] homosexual they claim to be pastors they
[25:11] claim to be teachers they say that God
[25:14] accepts them God wouldn't even accept
[25:17] the tithe of one much less one
[25:20] themsel and God has not changed has he
[25:25] but yet you look around in the world and
[25:28] they will get to a place to where they
[25:30] will try their best to force us to
[25:33] accept them as normal they can cut off
[25:37] my head I will not accept them as normal
[25:41] because if I do I will have to call
[25:44] almighty God a
[25:46] liar praise the Lord so God would not
[25:50] accept them the tithing of a woman which
[25:53] was in prostitution neither would God
[25:55] accept the tithing of a man which was in
[25:58] prostitution now let's read a few
[26:00] scriptures in the Old Testament and show
[26:03] you how that the Jews related to dogs in
[26:08] general and when you look at this and
[26:10] it'll help you to appreciate why that
[26:12] this symbolism was used in this in 1st
[26:15] Samuel chapter 17 verse 43 whenever
[26:19] David went out to meet Goliath and the
[26:22] Philistines said unto David am I a dog
[26:28] that thou comest to me with staves and
[26:30] the Philistine cursed David by his Gods
[26:34] so it was a common thing not only among
[26:36] the Jews but among the Philistines that
[26:40] a dog a natural dog did not have a very
[26:43] good representation among them now David
[26:46] whenever Saul is after him 1 Samuel
[26:49] 24:14 after whom is the king of Israel
[26:53] come out after whom Dost thou pursue
[26:58] after a dead dog so here he puts a
[27:03] Double Indemnity upon this so just to be
[27:07] called the dog would have been bad
[27:09] enough so David adds another negative
[27:12] thing to that and he says King you're
[27:15] this great king of Israel why would you
[27:18] waste your time coming out to somebody
[27:21] like me now look what he's trying to do
[27:24] Saul feels like David is a threat to his
[27:26] kingdom but David calls
[27:29] himself something that was so low and so
[27:33] a base now he's not calling himself a
[27:35] male prostitute in this instance but
[27:37] he's calling himself just an animal so
[27:41] he would be able to relate to Saul I am
[27:44] no threat to you I am no threat to your
[27:47] kingdom I am no more than a dead dog
[27:51] compared to you so why would you waste
[27:54] your time coming after me and then he
[27:57] said after a flea 2 Samuel
[28:01] 16:9 then said abashi the son of Zariah
[28:04] unto the king now this is whenever David
[28:07] had went up to the city and asked for
[28:09] victuals there and they would not do it
[28:11] because they said we don't want you here
[28:13] we don't believe in your Administration
[28:15] we we follow Saul we have nothing to do
[28:18] with you so he cursed him and and and of
[28:21] course it made all the rest of David's
[28:23] followers very angry why should this
[28:26] dead dog curse my Lord the king let me
[28:30] go over I pray thee and take off his
[28:33] head so this is the way naturally then
[28:36] that they would relate to a doll now
[28:38] watch Psalm 22 this is the prophetic
[28:41] Psalm of the Lord Jesus hanging on the
[28:44] cross and David under inspiration is
[28:47] speaking these words as if it was the
[28:50] Lord Jesus himself for dogs have
[28:54] compassed me the assembly of the wicked
[28:58] have enclosed me they pierced my hands
[29:02] and my feet verse 20 deliver my soul
[29:06] from The Sword my darling from the power
[29:10] of the dog so this is the way they
[29:12] related it so for God to call a man a
[29:16] dog it was one of the lowest things that
[29:19] he could be called Isaiah 5610 his
[29:23] Watchmen are blind now listen at God
[29:26] talking about the leader
[29:28] of Israel listen how obase they had
[29:30] become themselves his Watchmen are blind
[29:34] they are all ignorant they are all dumb
[29:39] dogs that was by no means a
[29:43] compliment they cannot bark sleeping
[29:47] lying down loving to
[29:50] Slumber yay they are greedy dogs so it
[29:55] wasn't bad enough that God called them
[29:57] one adjective and dog but God said I'm
[29:59] going to lay the double whammy on you
[30:02] you're greedy dogs which can never have
[30:05] enough and they are Shepherds now notice
[30:09] who he's talking to he's talking to the
[30:11] leaders of the flocks of Israel
[30:14] Shepherds that cannot understand they
[30:17] all look to their own way everyone for
[30:20] his own gain from his quarter I imagine
[30:24] the Holy Ghost would probably call a lot
[30:26] of preachers today d dogs when you and
[30:28] greedy dogs now watch in the New
[30:30] Testament the book of Philippians
[30:32] chapter 3:2 that Paul picks up the same
[30:35] mindset now remember he was a Jew so as
[30:39] we would have um terms that we would use
[30:42] and call it a local cism then it would
[30:45] be words that we would say here in
[30:47] Tennessee and you might go to up in Ohio
[30:50] and they'd say where are you from we all
[30:53] say you know as dumb as this and crazy
[30:55] as that where are you from Brother D and
[30:59] brother Den they used to go up to Ohio
[31:02] and Indiana to hunt years ago whenever
[31:04] they' go to some of them stores up there
[31:06] and they'd stop you know buy them a cup
[31:08] of coffee or whatever and then people
[31:10] would just get them to talk say talk
[31:13] talk again say something else we want to
[31:15] hear what y'all got to say because what
[31:17] they were saying was so strange to them
[31:20] now remember Paul was a Jew so in Paul's
[31:24] words and his terminology to bring it
[31:26] over word they would be able to relate
[31:28] to it Paul said Beware of dogs so when
[31:33] you see a beware of dog sign that's
[31:35] actually
[31:37] scriptural but Paul wasn't talking now
[31:39] again about a four-legged dog but he's
[31:42] talking about people beware of dogs
[31:48] beware of evil workers Beware of the
[31:51] concision second Peter 2:21 for it had
[31:55] been better for them not to have known
[31:56] the way of righteousness and after they
[31:58] have known it to turn from the holy
[32:00] commandment delivered unto them but it
[32:02] has happened unto them according to the
[32:04] true proverb the dog is turned to his
[32:07] own vomit again now here Peter of course
[32:11] picking up the symbolism of a dog a dog
[32:13] doing what a dog vomiting and then
[32:17] turning right back around and eating
[32:19] that vomit and what's he liken it to
[32:22] people that knew the truth and then they
[32:25] turn away from that truth and that go
[32:27] back to the world and Peter used this
[32:29] symbolism again one of the lowest
[32:32] animals that there was to a Jew and he
[32:36] says and a s that was washed to her
[32:39] returned to her washed after she had
[32:41] been washed of course in the mar so he
[32:43] was showing how that people are like
[32:45] dogs and Hogs oh my goodness I sure
[32:48] don't want be called that de you in the
[32:50] Book of Revelation now watch John
[32:52] blessed are they that do his
[32:54] Commandments that they may have right to
[32:55] the tree of life may enter in through
[32:57] the gates into the city for without are
[33:01] dogs now once again the Lord is not
[33:04] talking about chabas and Great Danes and
[33:06] German Shepherds and German police and
[33:09] you know all that sort of thing for
[33:11] without are dogs look at the New
[33:13] Testament now the Greek word here it is
[33:16] Kuan which is a dog or a man of an
[33:21] impure mind an impudent man so what
[33:26] Moses is referring to here is not people
[33:29] selling dogs and making money off of
[33:32] them but it is actually was actually a
[33:35] male prostitute called by God a dog and
[33:41] let me read to you from the Moffet
[33:44] translation of the Bible no one of woman
[33:47] of Israel shall be a temple prostitute
[33:50] and no man of Israel shall be a temple
[33:53] prostitute you must never pay a vow unto
[33:57] The House of the Eternal your God with
[34:01] the money that is the hire of a
[34:03] prostitute or the wages of a
[34:07] catamite anybody ever heard that word
[34:09] before
[34:10] catamite that word is a word which means
[34:14] a young boy which is taken and turned
[34:17] into a prostitute for the use of older
[34:22] men it's an Abomination The Eyes Of God
[34:25] both are abom om itable to the Eternal
[34:29] your God now once the King James version
[34:33] of course was written which most of you
[34:34] know it was the 1611 version then after
[34:38] that there's been many different
[34:39] versions of that they go back they get
[34:41] the Latin Vulgate uh they get different
[34:44] Greek translations the Greek interlineal
[34:47] and they get different ones I know I'm
[34:48] probably speaking all the top of your AG
[34:49] you don't want them even talking about
[34:51] but it's basically that they go into the
[34:53] words and they look at it to try to get
[34:55] a little clear understanding than what
[34:57] was written several hundred years ago
[34:59] and this is where we get some of the uh
[35:01] newer versions of the Bible so I'm going
[35:03] to read you a few of them from the exact
[35:06] same verse this one's a new
[35:07] international version you must not bring
[35:10] the earnings of a female prostitute or a
[35:13] male prostitute in the house of the Lord
[35:16] your God to pay any vow because the Lord
[35:19] your God
[35:21] detest them both the Berean Study Bible
[35:26] you must not bring the wages of a
[35:28] prostitute whether male or female into
[35:32] the house of the Lord your God to
[35:34] fulfill any any vow because both are
[35:37] detestable to the Lord your God the New
[35:40] Living Translation States when you're
[35:43] bringing an offering to fulfill a vow
[35:45] you must not bring to the house of the
[35:47] Lord your God any offering from the
[35:49] earnings of a prostitute whether a man
[35:53] or a woman so notice now these newer
[35:56] version s that they don't say a woman
[36:00] and a dog but a woman and a man does
[36:04] that make sense everybody a woman or a
[36:06] man for both are detestable to the Lord
[36:08] your God the Christian Standard Bible do
[36:12] not bring a female prostitutes wages or
[36:14] a male prostitutes earnings into the
[36:18] house of the Lord your God to fulfill
[36:20] any vow because they both are detestable
[36:23] to the Lord your God the Amplified Bible
[36:26] says you shall not bring the hire of a
[36:28] harlot or the price I really like this
[36:32] one of a
[36:33] dog a
[36:39] sodomite into the house of the Lord your
[36:42] God in payment for a
[36:45] vow now I just like to remind everybody
[36:48] not just necessarily you all tonight but
[36:50] those that might stream this it wasn't
[36:53] God who needed saving it in the Old
[36:55] Testament so God has not changed his
[36:58] views about such things so dogs are part
[37:02] of God's animal creation and according
[37:06] to Genesis
[37:07] 126 God put the animal Creation in
[37:10] subjection to man to to to to sell a dog
[37:14] a cat a rabbit a horse a cow a pig
[37:18] whatever more there's no difference in
[37:19] selling a dog than there would be a
[37:22] horse or a cow or something else but God
[37:25] actually was not mean mean a four-legged
[37:27] dog but he was referring to a sodomite
[37:31] and may I just say that didn't stop in
[37:34] the Old Testament well we can take the
[37:35] book of Romans we can also take many
[37:37] other places in the New Testament and
[37:39] prove that God's view of that is still
[37:43] exactly the same and the church
[37:46] said praise the Lord question number
[37:50] two how is it
[37:53] fair that a message Christian goes in
[37:57] the
[37:57] Rapture but any other
[38:01] denomination
[38:02] doesn't how is it fair that a message
[38:07] Christian goes in the Rapture but any
[38:10] other
[38:11] denomination doesn't well let me say
[38:14] first of all that we don't really
[38:17] measure God by the way that we would
[38:20] think Fair first of all God
[38:24] owns all Grace
[38:27] all Mercy all compassion he's the source
[38:31] he's the fountain he's the resource he's
[38:34] the Creator so God can give grace mercy
[38:39] Peace Love forgiveness pardon uh
[38:42] Redemption reconciliation on and on and
[38:44] on and on I could go to whomever he
[38:47] wants because it's his to be able to
[38:51] give now it's not so much that message
[38:54] people are any better than anybody else
[38:58] because there's some message people if
[39:00] we would call them that that are
[39:03] probably lower than some of the Baptist
[39:05] people you work with because just
[39:08] because they go to the name of message
[39:10] don't mean they believe the message a
[39:11] bit more than anything so the term
[39:14] message can just be another
[39:16] denominational tag if people don't live
[39:19] the right kind of a life but what we
[39:22] believe by saying the message is that
[39:24] God has sent a prophet with the message
[39:27] in the last days that would be a
[39:29] restoration back to the original word
[39:32] that the apostolic church had in the
[39:34] beginning so let's read together and
[39:37] we'll read a few things about how God
[39:39] can be able to elect by for knowledge
[39:43] and God be can be able to give certain
[39:46] things that he wishes to give to certain
[39:48] people because he is Sovereign within
[39:52] himself for we know Paul said that all
[39:54] things work together for good to them
[39:56] them that love God to them who are the
[39:59] called according to his purpose so God
[40:04] is not asking us okay how many wants to
[40:07] be saved how many wants to go to heaven
[40:09] how many wants to be bride how many
[40:11] wants to be Church how many wants to be
[40:12] reprobate how many wants to be a clean
[40:14] vessel how many wants to be an unclean
[40:16] vessel but God himself fornew every
[40:20] person that would ever want to serve him
[40:24] and he also know th those that if he
[40:26] would go on for a million years they
[40:29] would never serve him the Millennium is
[40:31] a proof that if God gives people a
[40:34] thousand years of Peace some of them at
[40:37] the end of the Millennium now remember
[40:40] they've not been taught sin they were
[40:43] actually created a new in a human body
[40:47] at the beginning of the Millennia so
[40:50] their parents never handed down to them
[40:53] sinful traits the way mine and yours did
[40:56] they're going to be brought up because
[40:58] it'll people that never have the
[41:00] opportunity to be able to have the
[41:03] gospel preached to them God down Through
[41:05] the Ages has kept different ones hope
[41:06] you understand this that there's people
[41:08] right now that we will never reach with
[41:11] this message around the world they will
[41:13] never be reached a just God will never
[41:17] let them people be judged before the
[41:19] white Throne judgment without being able
[41:22] to hear about it so why would God do
[41:24] that because he wants to reserve some to
[41:27] be able to raise them up in the
[41:28] Millennium and they will hear it for
[41:31] their first time in the Millennium and
[41:34] at the end of that Thousand Years the
[41:37] devil would would be loosed out of his P
[41:39] prison and these people which saw you
[41:42] and I in glorified bodies they saw no
[41:45] deaths no suffering no sin no lying no
[41:49] adultery everything was peace the
[41:52] temperature was perfect the climate was
[41:55] perfect absolute perfection was upon the
[41:59] Earth and yet these people after 1,000
[42:02] years of seeing all of that will say I
[42:05] hate Jesus Christ I hate his kingdom I
[42:10] despise this stuff now unlike you and I
[42:14] we were born with that they were not
[42:16] born with it they were actually called
[42:19] by the voice of God Out of the Dust of
[42:22] the earth they were not born by their
[42:24] parents by mother and father father but
[42:27] God called them from the dust of the
[42:28] earth and God is going to give them a
[42:30] chance so no doubt they got a soul no
[42:33] doubt a human Spirit to be able to make
[42:35] that choice with reasoning and at the
[42:37] end of that thousand years they will
[42:40] make their choice to go with the devil
[42:41] now just go on and say this if the
[42:43] Millennium would have been a million
[42:45] years then people would have done the
[42:47] same thing so some people no matter how
[42:51] long God would give them at the end of
[42:53] it he looks at that span of time and he
[42:56] he sees they would still hate him they
[42:59] would hate his word they would hate his
[43:02] economy they would hate his kingdom they
[43:05] would hate instruction they would hate
[43:07] him telling them what to do he knows
[43:10] that but he also knows there's people on
[43:13] the Earth that love him they'll serve
[43:15] him it makes no difference what they've
[43:18] got to go through now you and I don't
[43:20] know that we can look at them and say
[43:23] but they're such good people well let me
[43:26] say it to you like this you will know
[43:29] people on one level if I could talk to
[43:32] them same people for about 30 minutes
[43:35] and just take the Bible and show them
[43:38] some of the things from the pages of
[43:40] their own Bible I want to use mine I'll
[43:43] use theirs and just let me show them go
[43:46] from fly from one page to another to
[43:48] another and show them things in their
[43:51] own Bible you'd be amazed in 10 to 15
[43:54] minutes the anger the upset look that
[43:58] they would start giving the tone of
[44:01] their voice how it would change but see
[44:04] if you don't cross them that way you'll
[44:06] never see that but really what gets them
[44:09] up and gets them all red is whenever
[44:12] they go to seeing things in the word so
[44:15] remember whenever you are looking at
[44:17] people many times you're only judging
[44:19] them about what little bit that you know
[44:22] about them I can tell you that not only
[44:24] just a denominational people but also of
[44:27] message people you'd be surprised at the
[44:30] way that people have done there's been a
[44:31] few times me sitting in my office and me
[44:34] actually counseling people from our
[44:36] church that I thought I was going to get
[44:39] hit there was a man a few years ago that
[44:42] was sitting across the desk from me and
[44:44] he come in and he come in and he sat
[44:46] down and he said you was preaching at me
[44:49] I said I was not I wasn't preaching at
[44:51] you I didn't even know you were here he
[44:54] got up out of his chair and took his
[44:56] fist and went right like this to
[45:03] me ah somebody you all shook hands with
[45:07] and said hello
[45:10] brother
[45:12] wow I thought Jesus my nose is big
[45:15] enough it don't need to be no
[45:17] bigger I said now brother calm down just
[45:21] calm down and sat down I said I was not
[45:24] preaching at you the Holy Ghost might
[45:26] have been and if he did then I ain't
[45:29] apologizing for that jumped up again and
[45:31] come at me
[45:34] again so you see whenever a preacher
[45:37] which is Anointed by the Holy Ghost will
[45:39] take the word and go to saying things
[45:41] now most of you I'm not going to tell
[45:43] that person's name because you don't
[45:44] need to know but most of you would never
[45:47] believe
[45:49] that and if you didn't believe me and
[45:51] take my word for it the way you know
[45:53] that person you'd think no no no
[45:58] way well I come back close to having a
[46:00] bigger nose I
[46:02] know so you see God knows things about
[46:06] people that you and I look at them and
[46:08] we say oh but they're such good people
[46:10] they're just such good people well
[46:14] according to Jesus there is none good no
[46:22] not so do we believe our opinion about
[46:25] people
[46:26] or what Jesus said that includes us if
[46:30] it was not for the grace of God we
[46:32] wouldn't be good for nothing we wouldn't
[46:34] be clean enough for a good clean bullet
[46:36] is that right but God has changed us by
[46:39] his grace now watch Paul in verse 29 for
[46:43] whom he did for no I love this word for
[46:49] ordained no before to have
[46:54] knowledge beforehand
[46:56] Those whom God
[46:59] fornew so they
[47:03] would love
[47:05] him praise be to God Those whom God
[47:09] forew so they would love him now
[47:13] remember the question how is it fair
[47:15] that a message Christian goes in the
[47:16] Rapture but other denomination does not
[47:20] notice again as Paul goes on to say he
[47:22] also did predestinate so God forne them
[47:27] and then he predestinated which means to
[47:30] determine before to predetermine decide
[47:34] before him in the New Testament of God
[47:38] decreeing from
[47:40] eternity to for orain an appoint
[47:46] beforehand
[47:47] so how many of your brothers now are
[47:51] going to tell me here tonight that you
[47:54] are perfectly f fine you unmarried
[47:57] Brothers with your mother and father
[48:01] picking out your
[48:05] wife
[48:08] what you brothers are you're not brother
[48:13] Paul well I mean what's the what's the
[48:17] issue you wouldn't want someone picking
[48:20] out your wife but we want to pick out
[48:24] God's
[48:28] we want to tell
[48:30] God who he is to allow in his
[48:35] bride how dare
[48:39] we all right now let's switch it to the
[48:42] other side sisters that's unmarried
[48:44] would you want your daddy picking out
[48:46] your
[48:47] husband would you want your little mean
[48:49] brother or your little mean
[48:53] sister was that fair
[48:56] Ellie would you want your sisters
[48:58] picking out your
[49:00] hubby what about it what about it
[49:03] sisters what about it Brothers what what
[49:05] Brother Don that's not even fair well
[49:08] it's not fair for us to pick out God's
[49:10] wife is it so what did God do God picked
[49:14] out his own now was it fair for me to
[49:19] pick
[49:21] Carol y'all think that was fair was it
[49:24] fair for her to answer my choice and say
[49:27] yes I'll marry you was it fair for your
[49:31] dad to pick your mom or what if somebody
[49:34] else wanted
[49:36] him well shouldn't shouldn't he marry
[49:38] them just simply because they want
[49:44] him so you see in
[49:47] reality we honestly don't believe from
[49:51] practical
[49:52] realm that we have the right or say to
[49:56] force anyone to marry someone
[49:58] else we don't even believe that
[50:00] naturally I'm sure not going to do it to
[50:03] God so God himself will choose who goes
[50:08] in the Rapture now remember the Rapture
[50:12] is the crowning when God made the woman
[50:15] in the
[50:16] beginning the woman was such a special
[50:19] creation to God that he brought and give
[50:22] her to the man and the man was the
[50:24] crowning of all of botney life and
[50:27] animal life and the mountains and the
[50:28] rivers and the streams and then God gave
[50:31] the woman and Paul picks it up of course
[50:34] when he's dealing with headship in the
[50:36] New Testament and he lays it out that
[50:38] the woman is such a great thing and
[50:41] given as a great price to the man so is
[50:45] the bride to Christ Jesus so when
[50:47] whenever we talk about who's going in
[50:50] the Rapture it is the elect of the AG is
[50:55] that God himself chose it's like his
[50:59] wife so it must be a woman that is such
[51:03] a reflection of him so if God allows one
[51:08] liar in the Rapture it shows what kind
[51:12] of man that he is so if God allows one
[51:17] hypocrite one adulterer one hormonger
[51:20] one
[51:22] sodomite just one that's all it'll take
[51:25] and say there's millions of others
[51:28] that's genuine consecrated Christians
[51:31] and yet God compromises and allows one
[51:34] liar to come
[51:36] in that shows us what kind of a God that
[51:40] he is but he won't will he he will not
[51:43] allow any of that to come so then
[51:47] whoever's going to go in the Rapture it
[51:49] will be God's choice and they will
[51:51] reflect his choice in a woman now you
[51:55] your brothers that are still looking for
[51:56] a
[51:58] wife if you come and bring uh a woman in
[52:02] the office to me and now brother Donnie
[52:04] as I met with a young brother and sister
[52:06] sitting here tonight
[52:08] Sunday and they're talking about their
[52:10] relationship and just questions about
[52:13] this and that and the other now if you
[52:16] brothers would bring a woman in with you
[52:19] into my office and sat
[52:21] down and she's got on a mini skirt about
[52:24] like this
[52:27] she's got earrings hanging down like
[52:29] this look like stirrups on a
[52:32] saddle and she's dressed ungodly and
[52:36] indecent and I've got to sit there like
[52:38] this the whole time she's in the
[52:41] office because she's dressed so
[52:45] awful and you come to tell me brothers
[52:47] that you've come to
[52:49] pray about marrying this
[52:54] woman then there's something wrong with
[52:56] your
[52:58] taste and what a Godly woman is brother
[53:02] bam even goes on to say that if a man
[53:03] marries such a woman that he knows is
[53:06] not fit to be his
[53:08] wife pretty much he's getting what he
[53:12] deserves so if God would feel that way
[53:15] then about us
[53:17] men would any of your brothers want to
[53:19] go on the street I'm not really familiar
[53:22] with with Johnson City where any of this
[53:23] would be but I've Been Told that there's
[53:26] certain places in Johnson City where you
[53:27] can go and it's known for
[53:30] prostitution would any of you young
[53:32] Brothers go there and pick up a lady and
[53:35] and bring her to church on Sunday
[53:36] morning and decides you want her to be
[53:38] your
[53:40] wife would any of y'all do
[53:42] that you would well you see then if we
[53:46] wouldn't want to marry a
[53:47] prostitute then we should not try to
[53:50] force God to marry a prostitute now
[53:52] we're not against individuals in
[53:54] organizing religion many of them love
[53:57] the Lord and they will have to come out
[54:00] of that before it goes into Satan or
[54:04] once they're found in there when the
[54:06] when the mercy seat is
[54:08] closed they receive the mark of the
[54:11] beast why because
[54:14] denominationalism is the mark of the
[54:16] beast why you say that Brother Don
[54:19] because a church like this you think an
[54:21] organization wouldn't love to have a
[54:23] church like this and you know one the
[54:25] first things they would do is get rid of
[54:29] me because no organization is going to
[54:31] tell me what to preach no board no
[54:35] system a bunch of people getting
[54:37] together now brother Donnie you ain't
[54:39] going to preach on this and this and
[54:40] this you're barking up the wrong tree
[54:43] ain't nobody telling me what to preach
[54:45] but Jesus and telling me what I can't
[54:47] preach but a denomination will send you
[54:50] what you can and cannot preach and if I
[54:53] did not comply and and they gave me to
[54:56] Wednesday night then you know what
[54:57] they're going to do they're going to get
[54:59] rid of me and they're going to give this
[55:01] church to someone that they
[55:05] choose and then they're going to tell
[55:07] you all what you can do and what you
[55:09] can't do and they're going to tell you
[55:11] sisters oh you don't have to have that
[55:12] long hair that was that knucklehead that
[55:14] you had up there for a pastor you don't
[55:16] have to wear dresses no more then you're
[55:18] going to have a bunch of men that tells
[55:21] you what to do well now wait a minute
[55:23] wait a minute he he showed us this in
[55:24] the Bible
[55:25] Deuteronomy 22:5 says it's an
[55:27] Abomination for a man to put on that
[55:29] which pertains to a woman and a woman
[55:30] put on that which pertains to a man he
[55:32] even read it from the New Testament the
[55:34] book of Peter and read the New Testament
[55:36] from the books that Paul wrote how that
[55:38] women are to dress modest oh yeah but we
[55:40] we we got greater understanding we got
[55:43] greater understanding than that well we
[55:45] we don't believe that applies no more
[55:47] that's why
[55:49] God cannot work with an
[55:53] organization if it ever gets to a spot
[55:55] that I or the deacons or the trustees or
[55:58] any other human being wants to be the
[56:01] head over this church instead of the
[56:04] word the Holy Ghost won't stay here
[56:07] we'll grieve him right away ain't that
[56:09] right
[56:11] amen so an organization then when people
[56:14] stay in that and have
[56:17] that if they're there when The Mercy
[56:20] Seat is taken from the
[56:23] earth the prophet said said come out of
[56:25] her Revelation 18:1 when that angel
[56:28] Mighty Angel come down from heaven and
[56:29] said come out of her my
[56:32] people so they cannot stay in
[56:36] organization and be bride or called to
[56:40] be an old brother don't there will be
[56:41] people that'll go out of the Catholic
[56:43] church that is a lie you show me that in
[56:46] the
[56:47] Bible oh but there'll be people that'll
[56:49] come out you show me that in the Bible
[56:51] and I'll sit down and let you finish
[56:53] these question answers but the Bible
[56:56] says come out of her my people that ye
[56:59] be not partakers of her sins you see to
[57:03] be found in an organization once the
[57:07] Rapture takes place means that you are
[57:10] sealed with the mark of the
[57:14] beast what is that it's an image that's
[57:18] made un the
[57:20] original maybe somebody can ask me a
[57:22] question on that Revelation 138
[57:24] revelation
[57:25] 178 because it's that's what organized
[57:28] religion is it's not a 666 up here on
[57:31] your hand and you know years ago
[57:33] whenever they started I remembered as a
[57:35] as a kid whenever they started putting
[57:37] the um barcodes and all that on
[57:39] groceries any all some of y'all old
[57:41] enough to even remember that but I
[57:42] remember even back in Kentucky people
[57:44] was afraid to buy their groceries if
[57:46] they had a barcode cuz they knew it was
[57:48] the market of the Beast well when
[57:50] computers come they were scared to death
[57:52] it was going to be that well you know
[57:54] now Bill Gates wants to put a a chip in
[57:56] everybody and people scared to death all
[57:58] know in Denmark I've already seen the
[58:00] videos of it in Denmark they've already
[58:02] got it your name your social security
[58:05] number your bank account everything slid
[58:08] right under right up here this part of
[58:09] your hand you go through you scam nobody
[58:12] can replicate you if you're anywhere in
[58:14] the world they can track you by
[58:16] satellites they know exactly where you
[58:18] are people scared to death it's the mark
[58:21] of the beast you know why Satan does
[58:23] that he puts up this false Mirage so it
[58:27] will scare people and he knows himself
[58:30] the mark of the beast is organized
[58:32] religion and he gets them all to join
[58:35] that but he puts this scarecrow up here
[58:39] this is the mark of the beast this is
[58:40] the mark of the be oh watch the computer
[58:43] oh don't never scan your hand oh no no
[58:46] no I scanned mine in Carol's passport
[58:50] yesterday from an app on my
[58:53] phone for New Zealand
[58:57] Transit and what that did was we been a
[59:00] US citizen we don't have to have a Visa
[59:03] but they do want an identification to
[59:05] just a pre-qualification to get you
[59:07] there so I took my passport held it up
[59:10] in my hand and I took my phone and lined
[59:13] it right up with the code down on the
[59:15] bottom and whenever it did
[59:18] it captured it pull my name up my
[59:22] address social security number
[59:25] then I held my phone up and it told me
[59:27] where to put it and took a picture of me
[59:30] I did Carol exactly the same way now if
[59:33] I would have had to went through
[59:35] Washington DC which I've done that
[59:36] before it can take
[59:38] weeks I got the notification today
[59:41] everything was fully
[59:43] processed now will Satan use that in the
[59:46] last days he will but your iPhone is not
[59:50] the mark of the beast and even if you're
[59:52] a Droid user poor old
[59:55] saying it ain't to Mark the Beast either
[59:58] what is it
[1:00:00] organized
[1:00:02] religion now watch Paul says that whom
[1:00:05] he did for know he did predestinate to
[1:00:06] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:00:08] that he might be the
[1:00:10] firstborn among many Brethren who's the
[1:00:13] Rapture for the
[1:00:16] family of
[1:00:18] God Brothers and Sisters of the economy
[1:00:22] of God verse 30 moreover whom he did
[1:00:25] predestinate them them he also called
[1:00:27] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:00:30] whom he justified them he also glorified
[1:00:33] now this is what God has done to those
[1:00:36] who are in the for knowledge of God and
[1:00:38] predestinated them to eternal life oh
[1:00:41] brother Donnie won't want that many to
[1:00:42] be saved there will be
[1:00:45] millions of them saved CU do they love
[1:00:49] the Lord yes many of them love the Lord
[1:00:53] they love the Lord
[1:00:55] but loving the Lord and being
[1:00:57] bride is not the same
[1:01:00] thing now watch in Ephesians 1:3 blessed
[1:01:04] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:01:05] Christ who has blessed us with all
[1:01:08] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:01:10] in Christ now watch this according as
[1:01:13] Heath chosen Us in him before the
[1:01:16] foundation of the world that we should
[1:01:18] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:01:23] love now this is the sad part about many
[1:01:26] church members they actually think
[1:01:30] they're under the
[1:01:32] blood but they're
[1:01:35] not because they reject the way to get
[1:01:39] to the blood you see Satan has achieved
[1:01:42] a great thing and that he has separated
[1:01:46] the blood from the
[1:01:49] word so people get the blood the
[1:01:51] chemistry on their mind Jesus hanging on
[1:01:54] across cross why there's so many songs
[1:01:56] about the cross and the blood and we
[1:01:58] must have the blood yes we must have the
[1:02:00] blood but remember what bled was the
[1:02:04] word it was the word made flesh that was
[1:02:08] bleeding blood to wash the bride in but
[1:02:13] Satan has got most of the denominational
[1:02:16] people convinced that the blood and the
[1:02:18] word oh yeah I'm saved I'm a Christian I
[1:02:21] love God but what difference does it
[1:02:22] make how I dress and what difference
[1:02:24] does it make to God if a woman cuts her
[1:02:26] hair that that don't make no difference
[1:02:28] so you say what they do they separate
[1:02:31] the word from the blood oh I'm saved
[1:02:33] I've got everything I need I I just
[1:02:34] don't have to comply to all of that and
[1:02:37] who was it that told you
[1:02:41] that who was it that told you that that
[1:02:43] was not necessary it was not God now who
[1:02:46] was it so it was some man or some woman
[1:02:49] or some system that told you that it's
[1:02:52] not in the scripture so they think
[1:02:55] they're under the blood because oh Lord
[1:02:57] Jesus I I want to be saved oh Father
[1:03:00] save me oh praise God I feel better
[1:03:02] brother Donnie do they feel better yes
[1:03:06] my goodness how many people get saved
[1:03:09] they get
[1:03:11] saved but they don't have the Holy
[1:03:17] Ghost they're not born
[1:03:19] again you imagine when Jesus told Peter
[1:03:22] that day I'm going to tell you what's
[1:03:24] going to happen to you
[1:03:25] buddy before the car crows you're going
[1:03:28] to deny you even know me
[1:03:31] what what I can't what
[1:03:37] Jesus what John sure Josiah oh yeah I
[1:03:41] can see him do it any
[1:03:43] day Rob
[1:03:46] yeah Paul yeah these sisters of course
[1:03:50] me Jesus don't you know who I am I'm
[1:03:53] Simon Peter
[1:03:54] you're don't you remember you told me I
[1:03:57] had the keys to the kingdom I don't care
[1:03:59] what anybody else I'll never do it the
[1:04:03] Lord Jesus himself is standing there
[1:04:05] telling him he's so full of arrogance
[1:04:09] and he's so proud of who he thinks he
[1:04:13] is Jesus Christ is telling him and he
[1:04:16] will not even believe
[1:04:19] it before the crows Peter you're
[1:04:23] going to deny that you know
[1:04:24] me I will not do it I'll Stand By You
[1:04:29] Jesus just goes right on and ignores him
[1:04:32] he said Simon Simon Satan hath desired
[1:04:35] that he may have you that he may sift
[1:04:37] you as
[1:04:39] sweat but I have prayed for you that
[1:04:43] your
[1:04:44] face will not
[1:04:46] fail and you know what I find amazing is
[1:04:50] Peter
[1:04:51] failed but Peter's faith
[1:04:55] didn't Jesus didn't pray that Peter
[1:04:57] wouldn't fail but he prayed that his
[1:04:59] faith wouldn't and his faith never
[1:05:02] failed it and Jesus turns right around
[1:05:05] and says when you are
[1:05:09] converted now remember this man had
[1:05:11] preached for
[1:05:13] Years cast out Devils heal the sick his
[1:05:16] one the original 12 that Jesus sent out
[1:05:18] in Matthew 10 and when they come in they
[1:05:21] said Lord we saw Satan oh we we saw saw
[1:05:24] demons cast out we saw the sick heel and
[1:05:27] they come back rejoice and all praise
[1:05:29] God and notice what Jesus said about
[1:05:32] that Evangelistic tour he said I saw
[1:05:35] Satan cast out of Heaven as
[1:05:38] Lightning that's what them disciples had
[1:05:40] done pre Holy
[1:05:44] Ghost but they wasn't converted they
[1:05:47] accepted Jesus as their Savior Jesus
[1:05:50] actually baptized them in water Jesus
[1:05:55] baptized his own disciples so jesus
[1:05:57] takes them down and baptizes them in
[1:06:00] water ain't none of us got that
[1:06:02] testimony
[1:06:04] heavily so Jesus is talking to a saved
[1:06:08] Sanctified baptized Preacher
[1:06:11] Man and he tells him when you get
[1:06:15] converted Preacher
[1:06:17] Man strengthen your
[1:06:21] brothers wow so Peter was saved
[1:06:25] Sanctified Justified
[1:06:28] Sanctified had anointing preached cast
[1:06:32] out Devils but didn't have the Holy
[1:06:35] Ghost and preter Peter turned out to be
[1:06:39] a cussing
[1:06:42] preacher wow you remember that in the
[1:06:45] Bible he cursed he
[1:06:49] cursed what happened to his
[1:06:51] justification what happened to his water
[1:06:53] baptism ISM what happened to his
[1:06:55] sanctification flew out the window
[1:06:57] didn't it what happened to his great
[1:06:59] experience of casting out Devils he
[1:07:02] couldn't hold him he didn't have the
[1:07:04] Holy Ghost so let me say it so you'll be
[1:07:07] sure to understand no one no
[1:07:13] one no one without the Holy
[1:07:17] Ghost will go in the
[1:07:19] Rapture whether you go by the claim
[1:07:21] Baptist Methodist message tape only
[1:07:26] perusia seven Thunder
[1:07:29] perusia whatever you call
[1:07:32] yourself that's not what will get you in
[1:07:35] the
[1:07:36] Rapture it's whenever he sees the
[1:07:40] token displayed in our
[1:07:44] lives brother Donnie can people come out
[1:07:47] of the Baptist Church absolutely they
[1:07:50] can but they won't remain Baptist they
[1:07:54] won't remain Catholics they won't remain
[1:07:58] Pentecostals that's the problem with
[1:08:00] some they come out of the Baptist Church
[1:08:02] for years and years and set in a message
[1:08:05] church and then they decide they don't
[1:08:07] want the message in its pure form and
[1:08:09] then they leave and go right back or go
[1:08:12] to some hybrid type of a deal and then
[1:08:15] they find out they really didn't want it
[1:08:17] and its pure form they wanted in a
[1:08:20] hybrid form as a man like to run over me
[1:08:23] today when I was at Lowe's in the
[1:08:24] parking lot he backed out and I noticed
[1:08:27] on the rear of his car it was getting
[1:08:29] quite close to me and I was reading and
[1:08:31] it was a Tesla and I was reading on the
[1:08:33] rear of his car and it said dual motor I
[1:08:36] thought I know a lot of Christians like
[1:08:38] that you know that they're dual
[1:08:41] motors so I mean I I finally had to move
[1:08:44] because the man was going to run me over
[1:08:46] but every person who goes in the Rapture
[1:08:50] must have the Holy Ghost just to be a
[1:08:55] Christian is not
[1:08:57] enough to come to our church is not
[1:09:01] enough to say you believe God sent a
[1:09:04] prophet is not
[1:09:06] enough or you say brother Donnie I I
[1:09:08] believe every word brother brandham said
[1:09:11] and I'll quote back to you what brother
[1:09:12] Bram said oh brother brandham you say I
[1:09:15] you say I believe every word you said he
[1:09:18] said that's just being able to
[1:09:22] read
[1:09:24] so you see a person can believe it from
[1:09:27] here and not believe it
[1:09:29] here how many of you have listen to ever
[1:09:32] tape brother Brennon
[1:09:34] preached
[1:09:35] anybody
[1:09:37] 1149 I think might be 1153 now cuz they
[1:09:41] found a few more anybody listen to every
[1:09:43] one of
[1:09:45] them anybody read every book of the
[1:09:48] Bible I know some of you have you some
[1:09:51] of you reread your Bible several times
[1:09:54] that's good that's
[1:09:56] wonderful that don't mean you got the
[1:09:58] Holy
[1:09:58] Ghost and there may be things that
[1:10:01] you'll listen to a tape tomorrow pick up
[1:10:02] a book and it oh you'll have the offest
[1:10:05] time with it ever was oh goodness you
[1:10:07] just that oh man and you say I believe
[1:10:09] every word he said what you mean is you
[1:10:12] believe every word so far that you've
[1:10:15] heard him
[1:10:16] say but the Holy Ghost knows that after
[1:10:18] tomorrow you'll be listening to another
[1:10:20] tape and you'll hear something it's
[1:10:21] going to Scorch you like and hit you
[1:10:24] it's going to boy it's going to burn you
[1:10:26] up but the Holy Ghost in you will say
[1:10:30] Amen help me Lord help
[1:10:33] me right but if you ain't got the Holy
[1:10:36] Ghost you'll say no oh now wait a minute
[1:10:38] uh well that that might just been the
[1:10:39] man part well you know I I don't know
[1:10:42] that I need that part after all we're
[1:10:44] Sovereign in our church so what we claim
[1:10:46] you know that's such well a lot of folks
[1:10:47] are doing the day that we're living they
[1:10:49] want to claim sovereignty when they want
[1:10:51] exemption from certain doctrines in the
[1:10:52] message it's going around the
[1:10:56] world what if that one thing you're
[1:10:59] claiming sovereignty from is the
[1:11:01] Capstone of your
[1:11:03] life and you claim sovereignty and you
[1:11:06] say I really don't need that and Jesus
[1:11:08] sent that word to you to see will you
[1:11:11] accept that word
[1:11:12] too oh my
[1:11:15] goodness preach it brother Donnie I
[1:11:18] will now let's go on was it fair so what
[1:11:22] I'm going to do now is in asking this
[1:11:25] question I'm going to ask you all some
[1:11:28] questions but I'm actually going to ask
[1:11:30] you the questions I am going to give you
[1:11:31] the answer so don't worry about having
[1:11:33] to answer was it
[1:11:35] fair that God chose
[1:11:39] Abraham over all the rest of the people
[1:11:43] of the
[1:11:45] Earth was it fair now in the way that we
[1:11:48] would say
[1:11:50] fair but keep in mind now he's the one
[1:11:54] that's giving out grace and mercy so
[1:11:58] it's his right any of your brothers like
[1:12:01] a shirt I've got on tonight this anybody
[1:12:03] like this caller you like it you like it
[1:12:05] you like it okay okay so now this is my
[1:12:09] shirt somebody bought it and gave it to
[1:12:13] me so it would be
[1:12:16] fair for me to give my shirt to either
[1:12:19] one of these
[1:12:22] brothers now the brothers that wanted it
[1:12:25] are nodding their heads yes the rest of
[1:12:27] you just sitting there looking would
[1:12:29] that be fair would that be okay would
[1:12:32] that be fair this is my shirt so can I
[1:12:34] give it to one one of these
[1:12:37] brothers would you all think that's fair
[1:12:40] or would you say brother Donnie that
[1:12:42] ain't fair you can't
[1:12:43] give what who give you any say over what
[1:12:48] I do with my
[1:12:51] shirt praise the Lord
[1:12:55] Genesis
[1:12:56] 17:3 and Abram fell on his face now this
[1:12:59] is before his name is changed to Abram
[1:13:01] Abraham and God talked with him
[1:13:04] saying as for me this is God talking
[1:13:10] behold my Covenant is with
[1:13:15] thee and thou shal be a
[1:13:19] father of many
[1:13:22] nations and you know what's amazing
[1:13:24] about this God never even ask
[1:13:28] him God never even said now I tell you
[1:13:31] what I I've got this I've got this deal
[1:13:33] I'd like to make you know what do you
[1:13:35] think I I'd like to do this and this and
[1:13:37] this but I'm waiting on you to tell me
[1:13:39] God never even asked him he said as for
[1:13:43] me my Covenant is with you God never
[1:13:47] even waited for a
[1:13:49] response God never even waited for an
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:54] God just said like it or lump it I'm
[1:13:57] your God like it or lump it you're my
[1:14:01] choice well you're going to be a nut if
[1:14:04] you lump
[1:14:05] it so what did Abraham do I like it I
[1:14:08] like it I like it God thank you thank
[1:14:11] you but how many more millions of people
[1:14:14] were on the face of the Earth and God
[1:14:17] only said this to one
[1:14:18] man now you see if we can ever find
[1:14:21] traits and characteristics of the
[1:14:25] Eternal then we know he does not
[1:14:29] change so again I ask you another
[1:14:32] question was it fair that God chose
[1:14:36] Isaac and not
[1:14:39] Ishmael Genesis
[1:14:42] 1719 and God said Sarah thy wife shall
[1:14:46] bear thee a son and
[1:14:47] deed and thou shalt call his name
[1:14:51] laughter which is what I Isaac means
[1:14:56] laughter and I will establish my
[1:14:58] Covenant with him now
[1:15:01] remember Sarah has not even conceived
[1:15:04] him
[1:15:05] yet so where is free moral
[1:15:12] agency you mean to tell me God is making
[1:15:15] this Covenant this boy is not even
[1:15:18] conceived in his mother's womb and God
[1:15:20] is saying oh yeah just let me tell you
[1:15:22] your wife going to have a boy and let me
[1:15:25] tell you what his name is going to be
[1:15:27] his name is going to be Isaac and let me
[1:15:29] also tell you what his Destiny is he's
[1:15:32] my
[1:15:33] choice I choose him before he's even
[1:15:36] born when I went minut what about free
[1:15:39] more agency no wait a minute God wait a
[1:15:40] minute well what if he don't want to
[1:15:42] serve you he will want to serve me I saw
[1:15:46] to it before the foundation of the world
[1:15:50] I predestinated him
[1:15:53] to love me that ought to make a
[1:15:56] presbyterian want to shout praise God I
[1:16:00] ordained him to serve me brother Donnie
[1:16:03] can God do that he can because Grace is
[1:16:08] his Mercy is his you imagine God telling
[1:16:14] Jeremiah before you were formed in your
[1:16:18] mother's
[1:16:20] womb I ordained you to be a prophet to
[1:16:27] the
[1:16:28] Nations oh my goodness one of the
[1:16:31] hardest jobs of the Old Testament and
[1:16:34] God never even asked him now how fair is
[1:16:39] that does that seem fair to
[1:16:42] you Jeremiah always felt so sorry for it
[1:16:46] he was one of the most hated prophets
[1:16:48] you haven't read the book of Jeremiah
[1:16:50] you should he was one of the most hated
[1:16:52] Prophets and God demanded so much of
[1:16:55] this man God required so much of him I
[1:17:00] can't wait to see him he went through so
[1:17:03] much stuff and God never even asked him
[1:17:07] hey I was thinking about making you a
[1:17:09] prophet what do you think God never even
[1:17:11] asked him God just told him you are
[1:17:14] going to be a prophet it ain't multiple
[1:17:17] choice is it can I have your permission
[1:17:19] God just said I don't want your
[1:17:21] permission I don't need your permission
[1:17:24] I ordained you to do this and you're
[1:17:26] going to do it
[1:17:29] right and Jeremiah's going to say
[1:17:32] right
[1:17:34] right but you know what he also
[1:17:36] said when he got burdened down and he
[1:17:39] got under such distress he said I made
[1:17:41] up my mind I wouldn't speaking no more
[1:17:45] in the name of the
[1:17:48] Lord but he said his word was shut up
[1:17:52] like fire in my bones I couldn't keep
[1:17:56] from speaking I had to
[1:17:59] prophesy so what was that that
[1:18:01] overpowered his human
[1:18:03] will prophetic utterance from God I
[1:18:07] ordained you to be a
[1:18:09] prophet I ordained you hope you
[1:18:12] understand what I'm going to say I've
[1:18:14] had it happen to me many of times when I
[1:18:16] made up my mind God I ain't never I
[1:18:18] ain't never told God God I I'm going to
[1:18:20] quit serving you you know I know people
[1:18:22] go through that I never have my problem
[1:18:24] has not been me going to quit serving
[1:18:26] God my problem has been the the ministry
[1:18:29] part that's what I said oh God why' you
[1:18:31] call me to be a preacher what you say
[1:18:32] brother Donnie how could you do that
[1:18:34] Harry sent me a quote the other day
[1:18:35] where brother Brandon was talking about
[1:18:37] mey and he said he told mey he said mey
[1:18:40] I'm just so discouraged I'm just so down
[1:18:42] I don't even know if God even called me
[1:18:44] to
[1:18:46] preach you imagine a prophet she said
[1:18:48] Bill shut up shut up God called you to
[1:18:51] preach Oh Praise God you imagine tell
[1:18:54] Elijah to shut up but I guess even
[1:18:56] sometimes Elijah needs to shut up but
[1:18:58] what is it don't you understand you may
[1:19:00] not be a preacher but don't you
[1:19:01] understand when you come to that spot
[1:19:03] that you think you can't make it and you
[1:19:05] made up your mind I'm quitting I'm
[1:19:07] turning my back on God and something
[1:19:09] down on the inside gets a hold of you
[1:19:11] and say you ain't doing it you ain't
[1:19:13] doing it you ought to thank God for that
[1:19:15] you know what it is it's your election
[1:19:17] it's your predestination our Humanity
[1:19:20] would have given up no doubt many times
[1:19:22] but the same God that called Jeremiah
[1:19:25] called
[1:19:26] you praise the Lord now notice God said
[1:19:29] I would establish my Covenant with him
[1:19:33] for an Everlasting Covenant and with his
[1:19:36] seed after him so God designates the man
[1:19:40] Isaac and God designates his seed and as
[1:19:44] for
[1:19:47] Ishmael anybody know what his name
[1:19:50] means look at his name i s h m a e l the
[1:19:58] two last letters of his name are the
[1:20:01] name of God
[1:20:04] L God
[1:20:08] eel God heard his mother so his name is
[1:20:12] a derivative of God
[1:20:16] hears so this boy has part of the name
[1:20:20] of God in his name
[1:20:23] Isaac
[1:20:25] doesn't Isaac name is laughter why cuz
[1:20:29] Abraham laughed and Sarah laughed so God
[1:20:33] said all right I'll name your boy after
[1:20:35] what you all done yall laughed I call
[1:20:37] him laughter but look at
[1:20:40] Isel his name is more spiritual more
[1:20:43] scriptural than Isaac's is but God does
[1:20:47] not make his Covenant with
[1:20:50] Ishmael now notice what he's going to do
[1:20:53] for Ishmael I have heard thee because
[1:20:55] Abraham said Lord what about Ishmael
[1:20:58] what about isma God said all right I've
[1:21:00] heard you I have blessed him and will
[1:21:04] make him
[1:21:05] fruitful and will multiply him
[1:21:09] exceedingly 12 princes shall he beget
[1:21:14] and I will make him a great nation and
[1:21:16] what's absolutely amazing is when you
[1:21:18] study the genealogy of these 12 princes
[1:21:21] you will find the 12 princes of Ishmael
[1:21:25] actually get their inheritance
[1:21:28] years before the 12 sons that come out
[1:21:32] of Jacob did so ishmail was a type of
[1:21:36] organized religion so here they get
[1:21:39] their position in the worldly goods and
[1:21:42] remember when the children of Israel was
[1:21:44] down in the land of Egypt they were
[1:21:46] already enjoying their inheritance and
[1:21:48] when they come out and they go to cross
[1:21:51] near the property God said said hey
[1:21:53] y'all leave that alone don't you take
[1:21:55] that that belongs to them organizations
[1:21:58] you leave them
[1:21:59] alone now are we here to damn them and
[1:22:02] to say oh yeah no no no no no they've
[1:22:05] got their part they've got their part
[1:22:09] but can they ever take the bride's part
[1:22:11] no and can the bride take their part no
[1:22:15] who puts them in this difference of
[1:22:17] designation God does it was not Ishmael
[1:22:21] and Isaac and they were throwing dice
[1:22:24] one day and God said all right whoever
[1:22:25] gets a three and a two that's the one
[1:22:27] that I'll choose for mine all right
[1:22:29] whoever gets a six and a six I'll give
[1:22:31] them blessings no that wasn't the way
[1:22:33] that it happened God said I
[1:22:36] choose
[1:22:39] Isaac and Abraham says but what about my
[1:22:42] other boy what about my other boy God
[1:22:44] says all right all right I've heard you
[1:22:46] I'll make him a mighty
[1:22:49] nation I'll give him 12 princes I'll
[1:22:52] give him this and that and the
[1:22:54] other but if you if you study on the
[1:22:58] ishmaelites and you study on the sons of
[1:23:01] coutura which was Abraham's second wife
[1:23:04] after the death of Sarah you'll find out
[1:23:06] anybody know who the those people are
[1:23:09] they're the people from Saudi Arabia
[1:23:13] Iran Iraq Libya turkey they are the
[1:23:18] people down Through the Ages that have
[1:23:21] persecuted the Jews Israel today is
[1:23:24] surrounded by some of the
[1:23:28] ishmaelites the Saudi Arabians all of
[1:23:31] those who mainly are Muslim people and
[1:23:35] yet they have the same Father
[1:23:39] Abraham anybody ever read the Quran ever
[1:23:42] seen one anybody got one well I've got
[1:23:45] one I've read it now the Quran of course
[1:23:48] is the muslim's replacement to the
[1:23:50] Bible in the Bible
[1:23:53] bble God chose Isaac over Ishmael so the
[1:23:58] Muslims needed another
[1:24:03] Bible they needed another
[1:24:06] Bible so their Prophet says that the
[1:24:10] angel Gabriel came to him and other
[1:24:12] angels and different times of visitation
[1:24:15] and he wrote down the Holy Quran as they
[1:24:18] call
[1:24:19] it and in the Quran it is
[1:24:23] ishma that is God's choice not
[1:24:28] Isaac so they couldn't stick with the
[1:24:31] Bible so what they do they wrote thems a
[1:24:35] new Bible to
[1:24:38] misplace Isaac and his seat after him so
[1:24:42] Archaeology is still digging and finding
[1:24:45] they just found recently some things
[1:24:47] that dates back to David I saw the seal
[1:24:50] the other day of the seal and the the
[1:24:52] time of Jeremiah one of the scribes that
[1:24:55] was alive in the time of Jeremiah they
[1:24:58] found it in the original steps that had
[1:25:01] been dug out by Solomon fell down
[1:25:03] through the crack and it was laying
[1:25:05] right there and it was the Seal of Baro
[1:25:09] b a r u c h find that name in the book
[1:25:12] of Jeremiah the book of Lamentations and
[1:25:15] they they proved it over and over again
[1:25:18] that the Jews were there before Islam
[1:25:22] ever even was
[1:25:25] birthed but what do they want look at
[1:25:28] Ramadan going to begin what 2 three days
[1:25:30] something like that the Jews are
[1:25:32] thinking it's going to be it goes on for
[1:25:34] a month supposed to be a holy month a
[1:25:37] month of rest a month of Peace but
[1:25:40] they're afraid that the Palestinians and
[1:25:43] the Hamas and all this sort of thing is
[1:25:45] going to use it as a time of rebellion
[1:25:47] watch them watch the Jews look at the
[1:25:51] world look at the bride you'll see a
[1:25:53] great parallel the demons even have some
[1:25:58] sort of
[1:26:00] insight to who the elect are watch who
[1:26:04] they
[1:26:05] persecute watch who they fight watch who
[1:26:09] they stand against now remember in the
[1:26:13] fourth dimension where prophets saw
[1:26:15] their Visions they would not just see
[1:26:18] sickness and things like that but
[1:26:20] brother random would actually see
[1:26:22] streaks of Darkness that would come from
[1:26:25] people and he would see streaks of light
[1:26:29] and he would say you're a Christian
[1:26:32] because it's light around you now a
[1:26:35] person may have cancer standing on the
[1:26:37] platform someone sitting back here would
[1:26:39] have cancer this demon inside this
[1:26:41] person's body would communicate to that
[1:26:44] demon inside that person's body and them
[1:26:47] demons were talking back and forth and
[1:26:50] it would leave a tra as it were of
[1:26:54] Blackness and darkness and he would see
[1:26:56] it so this devil here would tell on that
[1:26:59] devil there but they were afraid because
[1:27:02] of that gift in his life he said can't
[1:27:05] you hear them they're
[1:27:07] screaming they're afraid they're scared
[1:27:10] they're trying to get unbelief gathered
[1:27:13] the battle is Raging unbelief is
[1:27:16] gathering faith is here which way will
[1:27:18] it go brother brandham he said according
[1:27:21] to the way you believe that happens
[1:27:24] every time we come to
[1:27:26] church so this war is going on the
[1:27:29] church natural they don't have a clue
[1:27:32] what the spiritual bride grows there
[1:27:35] they couldn't endure A month's worth of
[1:27:37] the bride's trials that don't mean that
[1:27:39] there won't be some of them that will be
[1:27:41] saved this is the group that will come
[1:27:44] out of Great
[1:27:46] Tribulation and they will stand there
[1:27:49] and be judged before the Judgment seat
[1:27:52] and I saw the Books open and another
[1:27:54] book was open which was the book of life
[1:27:58] and I saw the dead both small and great
[1:28:00] stand before God and when these books
[1:28:03] were open then they were judged out of
[1:28:07] the things that was written in the books
[1:28:09] concerning their deeds I'll tell you one
[1:28:12] thing I would never want to stand before
[1:28:15] him in that way would you would any of
[1:28:17] you here tonight want to stand before
[1:28:19] God and what you have to try to justify
[1:28:23] you is well you prayed so many times and
[1:28:27] and you paid your TI and you give an
[1:28:30] offering and and you you sent a text the
[1:28:32] other day to somebody to try to
[1:28:34] encourage them and and and you went to
[1:28:37] church sometimes you w't always faithful
[1:28:39] there um and and you you read your Bible
[1:28:43] occasionally and that's what you've got
[1:28:45] to say on your
[1:28:47] behalf oh
[1:28:49] Lord but when the bride stands before
[1:28:52] him the bride don't stand before the
[1:28:54] white Throne why she has already been
[1:28:58] accepted in the Beloved now the sad part
[1:29:01] about it is many church people think
[1:29:04] they're accepted too but if they
[1:29:08] are why will they be left behind in the
[1:29:11] Rapture and if they bride why don't they
[1:29:15] dress like
[1:29:16] bride why don't they act like bride
[1:29:20] we'll get to it this week and I want to
[1:29:21] close on on Sunday Lord willing part of
[1:29:24] the wedding
[1:29:26] vow that was said when a groom would
[1:29:30] take the bride a Jewish groom and he
[1:29:32] would marry a Jewish bride he would say
[1:29:36] these
[1:29:37] words be thou
[1:29:40] Sanctified unto me according to the law
[1:29:44] of
[1:29:45] Moses and of Israel now this is what the
[1:29:49] groom would say be thou s Sanctified
[1:29:53] speaking to the bride be thou
[1:29:56] Sanctified unto me according to the law
[1:29:59] of Moses and of
[1:30:03] Israel now the word Sanctified was
[1:30:07] cleaned set apart in other words he's
[1:30:11] saying to her don't you know any other
[1:30:15] man don't you have any other man to be
[1:30:18] your
[1:30:19] head don't you have any any other
[1:30:23] man that's going to dictate to you and
[1:30:27] lead you and guide you you are
[1:30:31] cadesh you are set apart to me you are
[1:30:36] Sanctified to me but the majority of the
[1:30:40] leodan churches aren't even Sanctified
[1:30:44] in the way they dress they're not even
[1:30:48] Sanctified in the movies they watch or
[1:30:51] the music that they listen to they're
[1:30:54] not set apart they're not Sanctified and
[1:30:58] remember if we are part of the Bride
[1:31:00] then we are
[1:31:02] priests so priests could not just walk
[1:31:05] into the presence of God with the attire
[1:31:08] that they chose they could not walk into
[1:31:11] the presence of God with just you know
[1:31:14] any kind of behavior anything they
[1:31:17] wanted God told them beforehand you wear
[1:31:20] this and this this and this and this and
[1:31:24] if you don't if you dare walk in my
[1:31:28] presence without this I'm telling you
[1:31:31] ahead of time I will kill
[1:31:37] you I will kill you so if God says to
[1:31:43] the church I don't want you dressing
[1:31:45] like the world I don't want you acting
[1:31:47] like the world I want you to be
[1:31:50] sanctified unto me but the church say
[1:31:54] I'm not doing that I don't care what
[1:31:56] they say ain't nobody telling me how to
[1:32:00] dress will you see what you're doing
[1:32:03] you're telling Jesus don't you tell me
[1:32:06] how to live don't you tell me how to
[1:32:11] dress so that proves you're not
[1:32:15] Sanctified you're not set apart to walk
[1:32:19] with God we have to be s
[1:32:23] sanctify don't you love him let's bow
[1:32:26] our
[1:32:29] heads oh Heavenly
[1:32:32] Father we count it such an honor Lord
[1:32:36] Jesus that we have been called by you
[1:32:41] father we are thankful for every
[1:32:46] name that the spirit of God has
[1:32:49] called since the shedding of the blood
[1:32:52] 2,000 years
[1:32:54] ago we are so
[1:32:57] grateful that the mercy of God was so
[1:33:02] abundant that you wouldn't just call
[1:33:04] from the Lamb's Book of
[1:33:07] Life but you would also call from The
[1:33:09] Book of
[1:33:11] Life we know that the Lamb's Book of
[1:33:14] Life is that Personal Diary as it was
[1:33:19] the elect names are in that portion of
[1:33:22] the
[1:33:24] book and no names can ever be blotted
[1:33:28] out of the Lamb's Book but we know that
[1:33:31] na names according to the scripture can
[1:33:35] be blotted out or
[1:33:37] removed from the book of
[1:33:41] life and there will be people who were
[1:33:43] saved and people who went to church and
[1:33:46] done this and that and the other and yet
[1:33:49] you give us the example in Matthew 25
[1:33:52] when they will be judged and also in the
[1:33:54] Book of
[1:33:55] Revelation and they will be judged
[1:33:58] Matthew 24 again they cast out Devils
[1:34:01] heal the sick done many signs and
[1:34:03] wonders and their name will be taken out
[1:34:07] of the book of
[1:34:09] life so that's people who said they knew
[1:34:12] you and they did know a portion of your
[1:34:16] grace oh Jesus if there's one young
[1:34:20] person here tonight father
[1:34:22] father that does not have the token the
[1:34:25] Holy
[1:34:26] Ghost Lord God I pray that you'd visit
[1:34:29] us here
[1:34:31] Lord we thank you for the shedding of
[1:34:33] the blood at the cross we thank you for
[1:34:36] your
[1:34:37] Resurrection on that Sunday morning
[1:34:40] we're so grateful for it but we know
[1:34:43] Lord God the Holy Spirit himself must
[1:34:46] come back that is the
[1:34:49] abstract to the titled deed that gives
[1:34:53] the clearance on our soul that
[1:34:57] everything that was against us is
[1:35:00] blotted out so it's not enough to be a
[1:35:03] good Baptist or a good Methodist or a
[1:35:06] good message
[1:35:07] believer we must be filled with the Holy
[1:35:11] Ghost Paul comes in the book of
[1:35:13] Ephesians and says grieve not the holy
[1:35:16] spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[1:35:20] until the day
[1:35:21] of your
[1:35:23] Redemption when Paul comes into the
[1:35:25] upper coast of Ephesus and he finds
[1:35:27] certain disciples there and he
[1:35:29] says have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:35:33] since you
[1:35:35] believed and they said we've not heard
[1:35:37] so much that there was any Holy
[1:35:40] Ghost this is so sad because they were
[1:35:44] following John the Baptist
[1:35:47] teachings John's mother had the Holy
[1:35:49] Ghost John's father had the Holy Ghost
[1:35:53] and John had the Holy Ghost before he
[1:35:55] was
[1:35:56] born and they hadn't even heard of
[1:35:59] it so here they were following the
[1:36:02] prophet John or so they thought and they
[1:36:06] hadn't even heard about what he got when
[1:36:09] he was in his mother's
[1:36:11] womb how much longer will it be before
[1:36:14] some of our message people won't even
[1:36:17] know what the Holy Ghost
[1:36:19] is they won't even know
[1:36:21] if they've got it or if they
[1:36:24] don't help us Lord not to console
[1:36:27] ourselves and try to hide and say well I
[1:36:30] I believe God sent a prophet that ain't
[1:36:33] enough the token must be displayed
[1:36:38] himself oh Jesus if there's a young
[1:36:41] person here
[1:36:42] tonight and they love you they felt the
[1:36:45] call upon their heart but they've got
[1:36:48] things in their life that they know is
[1:36:50] not right they've got besetting
[1:36:53] sins and something struck them when I
[1:36:55] said that about being Sanctified and set
[1:36:59] apart Lord God may they realize you're
[1:37:01] here tonight to help them with
[1:37:04] that I wouldn't want my wife Carol
[1:37:07] calling up some other brother on the
[1:37:10] phone and flirting with
[1:37:13] him I wouldn't want her meeting some of
[1:37:16] these brothers after church or some of
[1:37:19] these young brothers and inviting them

[1:37:25] to meet me tomorrow at Red Lobster and
[1:37:27] we'll sit and fellowship about the
[1:37:30] Lord of course Carol wouldn't do that

[1:37:38] with the
[1:37:39] world you don't want your wife telling
[1:37:41] you I don't believe what you say about

[1:41:51] these terms so you can relate to it oh
[1:41:57] Hallelujah young people these are the
[1:42:00] type of people that are going in the
[1:42:05] Rapture not the type of people that
[1:42:07] invite Jesus into the front door of
[1:42:09] their life and say I want you to save me
[1:42:12] from hell I want you to forgive me from
[1:42:15] my sins but you are not allowed to move
[1:42:21] out of the living
[1:42:23] room you can come and you can sit in the
[1:42:26] couch you can sit in the
[1:42:28] recliner you are not allowed in the

[1:42:54] peace but don't you go to nosing around
[1:42:58] in the rest of my
[1:43:03] house if you have that attitude tonight
[1:43:05] toward him you're not in Bride
[1:43:10] mentality cuz the bride invites him in
[1:43:12] the front door into the front
[1:43:16] room and once Jesus saves her the bride
[1:43:20] invites him to the dining room so they
[1:43:24] can sit there and eat
[1:43:26] together brother BR said you live in a
[1:43:29] three- room
[1:43:31] house then she invites him to the Parlor
[1:43:36] where you can sit there and
[1:43:38] fellowship what about it young people
[1:43:40] invite Jesus into those three rooms in
[1:43:44] your house kitchen where you eat living
[1:43:48] room where you Fellowship
[1:43:51] and then what does the bride do she
[1:43:53] invites him to the bedroom because she's
[1:43:56] married to him what for
[1:44:00] procreation the extension of his own
[1:44:03] image to be reflected in
[1:44:07] her but the church keeps Jesus in the
[1:44:10] living room while she takes other lovers
[1:44:14] into the kitchen and other lovers into
[1:44:18] every other room of her house
[1:44:21] worldly
[1:44:22] music ungodly things in her life
[1:44:26] dominates her bedroom dominates her
[1:44:30] dining room and Jesus is sitting in the
[1:44:34] living room chained to a
[1:44:37] chair
