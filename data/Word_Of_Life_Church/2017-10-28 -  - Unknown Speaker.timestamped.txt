[33:03] you I pray that you just help us anoint
[33:05] this service father God we ask it in the
[33:07] name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[33:11] hmm now the Lord had said unto Abram get
[33:15] thee out of thy country and from thy
[33:17] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[33:19] a land that I will show thee and I will
[33:22] make of thee a great nation and will
[33:25] bless thee and make thy name great and
[33:28] thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[33:30] bless them that bless thee and curse
[33:33] them that curse thee and in thee shall
[33:35] all families of the earth be blessed
[33:38] may the Lord had his blessings whose
[33:40] word you may be seated we're gonna Lord
[33:46] when we're going to try and look at
[33:48] something and I've got to watch the time
[33:52] I preached once on Sunday
[33:54] so I tend to go a little bit long but
[33:57] don't worry and don't worry about it
[34:00] we're gonna we're just gonna let the
[34:02] Holy Ghost lead us and he'll cut out
[34:04] what he needs to cut out and we'll get
[34:06] what we need to get and we'll get home
[34:08] on time so I've been wrestling with a
[34:15] thought here and I didn't know where to
[34:17] start and Lord just kind of laid this on
[34:19] my heart I preached us some of this I
[34:23] guess two weeks ago but we're looking at
[34:27] Abram and I wanted to open with this
[34:31] scripture to kind of put him in his
[34:33] where he is right now now we know that
[34:37] he was in her and and God called him to
[34:40] separate himself and he brought his his
[34:42] his daddy and his his nephew along with
[34:46] him and so he had received the promise
[34:49] okay he hadn't received the name change
[34:52] but he had received the promise okay and
[34:56] so he was on the way to something he was
[34:59] going somewhere now he hadn't
[35:03] accomplished much at this point
[35:06] he just started out okay so so here here
[35:14] he is he's he's he stepped out any
[35:16] auntie's he's accepted the promise but
[35:20] he's not really accepted the promise
[35:21] because you can't accept the whole
[35:23] promise without accepting the whole word
[35:26] now let me say that again because that's
[35:28] important you can't accept the whole
[35:30] promise without accepting the whole word
[35:34] you got to take it all it's not a
[35:36] spiritual buffet you got to take it all
[35:39] okay so Abram he's starting out in he's
[35:43] walking in this direction now he's got
[35:45] an end point he's got a goal God calls
[35:49] him the father of Nations he said among
[35:51] you all the nations will be blessed
[35:53] you're gonna be the father of Nations
[35:54] I'm gonna start something in you I'm
[35:57] gonna begin a good work in you
[36:02] so Abrams just got saved okay he's just
[36:07] got saved now I'm not gonna for the sake
[36:18] of time I'm not gonna go through all the
[36:20] things that he he went through buddy
[36:21] he's been saving it at some point he he
[36:24] gets his name changed right in and it
[36:26] takes it takes him going down to Egypt
[36:29] twice and lion and getting into trouble
[36:31] and it takes him all these all these
[36:33] different things and we're all familiar
[36:35] with the story but but as he's walking
[36:37] as he's going and trying to get to the
[36:40] place that God has sent him to and it
[36:42] started him out for he's made a lot of
[36:45] mistakes in he and he's grown up he's
[36:50] grown up he's saying God I you know at
[36:53] first I believed that you wanted to make
[36:55] me a father of Nations but I didn't
[36:59] believe you were serious about all that
[37:00] other stuff and he started walking and
[37:05] he learned that God was serious about
[37:08] everything that he said separate
[37:10] yourself listen to me obey me do what I
[37:14] asked you to do he's he's starting to
[37:16] understand exactly what God had wanted
[37:19] him to do so he's moving from salvation
[37:24] to sanctification justification he's
[37:27] done he's starting to add these things
[37:29] to him now we're gonna skip ahead to
[37:32] Genesis 27 keep your Bibles where I read
[37:38] a lot out of the Bible so I'm sorry it's
[37:44] not Genesis 27 Genesis 22
[37:53] so all these years Abram and he's
[37:57] changed his name to Abraham all these
[37:59] years he's been testifying right he's
[38:02] testifying saying I'm the father of
[38:04] Nations
[38:05] Ivan changed my name to be the father of
[38:08] Nations I've got a testimony that I'm a
[38:11] father of Nations we've got a testimony
[38:15] that were the bride right any any ladies
[38:20] walking that way any any and he's
[38:21] testifying of this okay
[38:27] everybody knows that he's not just Abram
[38:29] anymore he's the Abraham and it comes to
[38:33] fruition he has a son the promised son
[38:39] starting to happen and I believe that
[38:45] the word coming forth right now and
[38:47] things are starting to happen in our
[38:48] lives
[38:50] revelation upon revelation brother Don
[38:52] he's been preaching on the riemann it's
[38:54] starting to drop down we're starting to
[38:56] understand a little bit of who we are
[38:57] what we what we're supposed to be doing
[38:59] and and how we fit in this great big
[39:02] puzzle of God and so it's starting to
[39:09] happen for us we're starting to testify
[39:11] we're starting to be able to say hey I'm
[39:14] the bride I'm the one that was in the
[39:16] back part of his mind I'm the one who he
[39:19] thought of that's me
[39:22] ah
[39:35] and it came to pass after these things
[39:37] that God did tempt Abraham Abraham and
[39:40] said unto Him Abraham and he sold and he
[39:43] said behold here am I so he's attentive
[39:46] to it wasn't like a hesitation
[39:49] it wasn't he didn't have to do great
[39:52] things but he said Abraham and Abraham
[39:55] responded so he's in the mind of the
[39:58] Lord and he said take now thy son that
[40:04] only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get
[40:06] thee to the land of Moriah and offer him
[40:07] up him there for a burnt offering upon
[40:10] one of the mountains which I will tell
[40:14] the of wait a minute here's the
[40:19] manifestation of his testimony Isaac is
[40:26] the manifestation of his testimony
[40:28] that's what he testified of for so many
[40:31] years he said I am the father of Nations
[40:34] and for years he had to wait 25 years
[40:37] before this even happened and now it's
[40:40] manifested and he's lived in that glory
[40:44] for a little while he's got 13 years or
[40:46] so right he knows exactly he says my
[40:54] testimony is manifested before you here
[40:58] it is and we're starting to see the
[41:02] things the attribute of attributes of
[41:04] God starting to be added to us we're
[41:07] starting to see this stuff happen in our
[41:09] lives we're seeing testimonies we're
[41:12] seeing things that that the things that
[41:14] we kind of wavered on before we're
[41:16] starting to establish ourselves a little
[41:17] more and now God says you know that
[41:25] testimony you've been so proud of you
[41:28] know that thing you've been so proud of
[41:31] let's go take it on the mountain we're
[41:34] going to sacrifice whoa wait a minute
[41:38] now god I've trusted you a long time
[41:44] right I've been through thick and thin
[41:47] with you God but this is what your
[41:51] trials do for you this is what your hard
[41:55] times do for you let's read on a little
[41:57] bit so he's God is giving him
[42:01] instruction about how to - he's testing
[42:05] his testimony he is testing his
[42:10] testimony because he's not the father of
[42:15] Nations quite yet but he's got a real
[42:20] good start on it but he's not he's right
[42:25] there in Abraham rose up early in the
[42:33] morning whoa
[42:34] I don't about you but when I'd read
[42:37] something then I know I've got to do in
[42:38] the day I kind of pull the covers up
[42:44] right you know you got to face something
[42:47] that day knew it
[42:48] Oh coming Abraham break it down boom he
[42:57] pops out of bed trials trials he said he
[43:03] said I've been through this with you God

[43:09] out
[43:12] it didn't turn out so good for me I got
[43:16] in bad situations and you got me out of
[43:19] them so if you're telling me that I've
[43:22] got to test my testimony good morning

[43:55] gonna be able to pop out of our beds as
[43:57] it were say devil what do you got for me
[44:02] how are you gonna test this testimony
[44:17] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[44:20] and saddled his ass and took two of his
[44:23] young men with him and Isaac his son and
[44:25] clave the wood for the burnt offering
[44:26] and rose up and went unto the place of
[44:29] which God had told him hit his straight
[44:32] out let's go he's still being led from
[44:36] God he didn't get frustrated with God
[44:37] and said I can't believe we're going

[45:15] to home let's just skip this stuff God
[45:20] mm-hmm he said let's go let's go I want
[45:26] to see your glory and Abraham took the
[45:37] wood of the burnt offering and laid it
[45:39] upon Isaac his son and took the fire
[45:41] that was in his hand and a knife and
[45:44] they both of them together and they went
[45:48] both of them together and I was
[45:49] expecting to Abraham his father and said
[45:52] My Father and he said here am I my son
[45:54] and he said Behold the fire in the wood
[45:56] but where is the lamb for the burnt
[45:58] offering oh my Abraham just doing what
[46:05] God told him to do
[46:07] press song press song this is not an age
[46:13] brothers and sisters to dread serving
[46:15] god this is not a time to say oh god I
[46:20] just don't know how I can do it oh god
[46:24] how am I gonna how am I gonna face this
[46:26] thing Oh God it seems so heavy seems so
[46:32] hard he went to the mountain for a
[46:40] sacrifice he didn't know how was gonna
[46:45] work out
[46:47] he didn't know how God was gonna put all
[46:49] the pieces in place he had a lot of
[46:53] wandering in his mind he was human but
[46:58] he'd been through enough to know he'd
[47:05] been through enough to know that God was
[47:08] gonna fill in the blanks he was gonna
[47:13] take God at His Word he was gonna say
[47:17] all right God you said I was gonna be
[47:19] the father of nation right here I'm
[47:23] standing in front of my the
[47:25] manifestation of my testimony is right
[47:28] in front of me and you're telling me to
[47:31] go up to the mountain and kill it
[47:34] how's that gonna work I don't know but I
[47:39] trust you
[47:41] [Music]
[47:42] but I trust you I know it's gonna work
[47:45] out
[47:48] God does not get angry if you if you
[47:51] wonder in your mind he knows we're human
[47:56] he knows we've got this flesh on a steel
[48:01] [Applause]
[48:04] when he gets upset with us is when we
[48:07] delay and we worry we've got a negative
[48:14] attitude we have this wimey thing going
[48:19] on hey I know I'm not the only one
[48:23] guilty that we all go through things we
[48:31] all have to face things and it's it's
[48:34] okay to wonder okay God what are you
[48:37] doing but he don't like to have that
[48:42] negativity
[48:46] it's okay to wander but don't don't
[48:50] don't see here I don't see teri going
[49:02] through nothing like this you better
[49:08] watch it all that is is an invitation to
[49:14] get the heat turned up that's all it is
[49:21] you might have sway see gone mmm nothing
[49:29] for this fat boy he ain't doing that no
[49:31] more and Abraham said my son God will
[49:43] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[49:45] offering
[49:46] so they went both of them together and
[49:49] they came to the place which God had
[49:51] told her him of and Abraham built an
[49:53] altar there and laid the wood in order
[49:55] and bound Isaac his son and laid him on
[49:58] the altar upon the wood I skipped a
[49:59] verse here verse 5 neighbor ahem said
[50:07] unto his young men abide ye here with
[50:09] the ass and I in the lad will go yonder
[50:14] and worship and come again to you he had
[50:18] all the ingredients for a sacrifice who
[50:21] is him I didn't he was like we're still
[50:24] missing something but he had all the
[50:30] ingredients
[50:32] he went up the mountain with all the
[50:35] ingredients and he knew he knew to
[50:40] fulfill the promise to fulfill the
[50:43] promise let me say it again real slow he
[50:47] knew to fulfill the promise him and lad
[50:52] would come back his testimony was I will
[51:04] be the father of Nations God changed my
[51:07] name from Abram to miss Jesus Christ he
[51:15] went through all that trouble to change
[51:19] my name
[51:24] God has gone through all that trouble to
[51:28] change you to move you to take you from
[51:34] a rotten wrench change your attitude
[51:39] change your name to miss Jesus Christ so
[51:44] it don't matter how many times your
[51:46] testimony is tested or what you're going
[51:49] to go through you're going up the
[51:51] mountain and you're coming back down the
[51:52] mountain
[51:54] holiday glory dogs it means something to
[52:02] me because life isn't always easy
[52:09] there's times where this old flesh wants
[52:13] to string somebody up and my testimonies
[52:21] tested this is just brother John I'm
[52:29] gonna be honest with you I've got issues
[52:37] and you all do too because if you didn't
[52:43] we'd be raptured by now
[52:47] so our testimonies are tested they're
[52:54] tested I'm the bride of Jesus Christ but
[52:58] I wanna get you boy we go up the
[53:08] mountain we're gonna come back down the
[53:10] mountain man let's let's turn we're
[53:18] gonna look at one more one more little
[53:21] bit and then we're gonna go into
[53:22] something else let's go to Acts chapter
[53:26] 23 yo brother branham and I've got
[53:36] quotes here but brother branham he talks
[53:40] about that this is thus saith the Lord
[53:45] 100% let's say they don't fail it's not
[53:51] sure sometimes I think we forget that
[53:55] that's the say at the Lord becomes a
[53:58] book sometimes it just you you read it
[54:02] and you see the promises in there but
[54:07] it's hard to grasp it's hard to embrace
[54:10] sometimes because it's become so common
[54:14] to us but that's the fatal it's good for
[54:21] whatever ails you
[54:23] [Music]
[54:28] x-23 verse 11 and the night following
[54:37] the Lord stood by him and said be of
[54:39] good cheer Paul for as thou has
[54:42] testified of me in Jerusalem so must
[54:45] thou bear witness also at Rome my
[54:52] baubles red-letter that's the 5th Ward
[54:59] right
[55:02] he said you testified me of me and
[55:05] Jerusalem
[55:06] now you're going to Rome now let's turn
[55:20] to acts 27 41
[55:34] and falling into a place where two seas
[55:37] bent they ran the ship aground and the
[55:40] four-foot part stuck fast and remain
[55:42] unmovable
[55:43] but the hinder part was broken with the
[55:45] violence of the waves and the soldiers
[55:48] council was to kill the prisoners lest
[55:50] any of them should swim out and escape I
[55:54] should probably tell you that this was
[55:56] two years after that prophecy two years
[56:00] he went through a lot in those two years
[56:06] bondage your time you talk about the
[56:08] bondage of time two years and he was in
[56:13] prison the whole time he was in
[56:15] captivity they bound him up and they
[56:20] every now and then they dragged him out
[56:23] and he had to testify
[56:26] [Applause]
[56:27] he'd have to testify and then they
[56:32] dragged him back have you ever been
[56:37] through one of those trials just doesn't
[56:41] seem like it ends god you promised me
[56:47] that this was going to happen
[56:49] that was going to happen I feel it in my
[56:52] heart you said I will be healed your
[56:57] word says that I could be healed your
[57:03] word said that I don't have to live with
[57:05] this this oppression this depression
[57:07] this or that your that's what your word
[57:10] says and you told me to take you at your
[57:13] word that's what you told me to do and
[57:20] Here I am with this thing on me steel
[57:28] steel the doctors say it's no good I
[57:32] don't feel any good and it's not only an
[57:38] illness but but we go through a lot of
[57:40] things that seem like they just press on
[57:42] and on
[57:44] and on two years then he finally gets
[57:54] released to go to Rome like god you're
[57:59] so good thank you Lord I'm so glad I'm
[58:02] serving you hmm
[58:05] then he gets stuck in the sand and the
[58:08] boat breaks apart and he hears the
[58:11] soldiers whispering get off get away
[58:15] let's just kill them let's take care of
[58:19] this hmm Paul testified I'm going to
[58:28] Rome I'm going to Rome I'm going to room
[58:37] don't look like Rome to me you still on
[58:46] a boat buddy you're still in the midst
[58:50] of this trial
[58:56] you're still right in the middle of this
[58:58] thing don't look like Rome to me but the
[59:11] Centurion willing to save Paul kept them
[59:14] from their purpose and commanded that
[59:17] they which could swim could cast
[59:19] themselves first into the sea and get
[59:21] the land so God has made away God has
[59:27] made away Paul already told them we're
[59:30] not going to lose anybody he said we're
[59:34] not going to lose anybody and he
[59:37] softened the Centurions heart these guys
[59:42] are killers man they didn't care kill
[59:47] them they're prisoners the worthless
[59:51] right the devil says about you that's
[59:57] exactly what he says about you
[59:58] why do you even fool with this guy he's
[1:00:02] worthless let's get rid of him yeah
[1:00:06] that's what he wants to do he wishes to
[1:00:10] sift us like wheat
[1:00:14] yeah let's go down at chapter 28 and
[1:00:23] when they were escaped then they knew
[1:00:26] that the island was called I want to say
[1:00:30] Malta but it's not it was an island in
[1:00:34] the barbed Barrios people showed us no
[1:00:37] little kindness for they kindled a fire
[1:00:39] and received every one of us because the
[1:00:42] the present reign and because of the
[1:00:45] cold so God gives Paul some relief he's
[1:00:49] got some friendly friendly people there
[1:00:51] he said they showed us no little
[1:00:52] kindness they well couldn't see him
[1:00:54] built us a fire and when Paul had
[1:00:59] gathered a bundle of sticks and laid
[1:01:01] them on the fire there came a viper out
[1:01:05] of the heat and fastened on his hand and
[1:01:11] anybody been in snake bit I'm not
[1:01:14] talking literally been snake bit been
[1:01:21] snake bit you have trouble do you have
[1:01:27] trials have your flesh get over then
[1:01:32] snake bit Paul was doing a service he's
[1:01:40] putting more wood on the fire he was
[1:01:43] doing a service to his brother and
[1:01:45] sisters got snake bit he wasn't looking
[1:01:51] for trouble don't come crying to me if
[1:01:54] you're looking for trouble and you get
[1:01:56] snake bit
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:04] you can ask my children don't come
[1:02:06] crying to be you go out and you find
[1:02:09] your big brother and punch him in the
[1:02:11] head
[1:02:12] no come crying to me if he punches you
[1:02:15] back you give a little sometimes you get
[1:02:19] a lot you better be careful
[1:02:21] I know that's a little unconventional
[1:02:27] these days but that's what I am but here
[1:02:31] they are Paul was doing a service and it
[1:02:36] gets snake bit his good was evil spoken
[1:02:41] of he's trying to do the right thing and
[1:02:50] he gets snake bit and he shook the Beast
[1:03:02] into the fire and felt no harm
[1:03:08] he did not reach up for the onion tini
[1:03:13] he didn't defend himself he just said no
[1:03:22] I'm not putting up with it
[1:03:24] I'm not going to acknowledge I am NOT
[1:03:35] going to take my time to acknowledge the
[1:03:38] devil we spend as Christians too much
[1:03:49] time praising the devil ouch
[1:03:59] we spend too much time giving the devil
[1:04:03] glory for what he's done to us too much
[1:04:11] time
[1:04:14] that's just like brother branham talk
[1:04:16] about reaching for the onion team you're
[1:04:20] gonna feel the effects of the burn the
[1:04:23] minute you acknowledge that burn
[1:04:28] and so when the devil gets you like I
[1:04:33] said you're not looking for him but we
[1:04:36] all have that punch we've all got that
[1:04:39] thing yours is different than mine maybe
[1:04:44] but we've all got it
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:50] there's nothing what why did the devil
[1:04:53] be send away from God why what is God
[1:05:01] object worship right so when you worship
[1:05:07] something you're acknowledging it right
[1:05:10] so the whole purpose of the devil is to
[1:05:18] get you to acknowledge him and worship
[1:05:21] Him that is his whole goal I know this
[1:05:31] sounds funny but if you think about it's
[1:05:34] 100% true that's what he wants to do he
[1:05:40] wants worshipers he wants followers
[1:05:44] so if he can get you to acknowledge him
[1:05:52] go around and like brother Jewell says
[1:05:55] say wowsie wowsie whoo look where I'm at
[1:05:59] oh and he can get that plane over and
[1:06:04] over in your mind he's accomplished his
[1:06:10] task he's done what he came to do I'm
[1:06:20] getting to the point by God's grace I'm
[1:06:23] not acknowledging him anymore I
[1:06:26] understand the grace of God that is the
[1:06:31] the thing that's lacking the most in the
[1:06:34] church I believe MA within my heart
[1:06:37] that's what I think they don't
[1:06:38] understand the grace of God the grace of
[1:06:46] God is not loose living but the grace of
[1:06:55] God is not law the grace of God is an
[1:07:01] understanding that God is trying to
[1:07:03] protect us from ourselves
[1:07:07] that's all it is it's not do's and
[1:07:12] don'ts don't you do this
[1:07:14] don't you do that I'm not a mean dad cuz
[1:07:19] I tell my kids not to touch the hot
[1:07:20] stove I'm trying to prevent them from
[1:07:25] harm so holiness is to prevent us from
[1:07:31] harm don't overthink it don't
[1:07:35] overcomplicate it don't go around
[1:07:39] feeling defeated cuz you you you want so
[1:07:43] bad to trim your hair or wear long
[1:07:45] dresses or wear short dresses I guess
[1:07:48] that that's what a man
[1:07:53] watch your language or turn your head
[1:07:59] that's the Great's of Dawg what do we
[1:08:02] talk about the beginning of service
[1:08:05] Amazing Grace
[1:08:07] that's what's gonna see us through
[1:08:11] it's not hard to live this way if you
[1:08:18] know that it's just God's grace that's
[1:08:20] keeping you when it's God's grace
[1:08:27] keeping you you can start to understand
[1:08:29] that he's just sheltering you he's
[1:08:33] keeping you he's preventing you from
[1:08:37] your own ruin from snakebites Paul was
[1:08:47] going to Rome he got snake bit shook it
[1:08:55] off in the fire
[1:08:57] Amazing Grace I'm going wrong I'm hoping
[1:09:07] that you can make that connection he was
[1:09:14] going Rome he got snake bit they even
[1:09:18] said hey watch him drop dead he's gonna
[1:09:26] drop dead because he got snake bit his
[1:09:33] testimony was being tested he said I'm
[1:09:38] going to Rome and he got snake bit
[1:09:43] there's a happy land of promise over in
[1:09:49] the great beyond I'm going somewhere I'm
[1:09:53] going somewhere real John's you get
[1:09:56] snake but I guess I do I just shake them
[1:09:59] off in the fire
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:03] that what he called us to do shake him
[1:10:07] up in the fire we don't need to sit
[1:10:09] there beat ourselves up over our
[1:10:11] mistakes and our faults and our failures
[1:10:13] because it's not getting us anywhere
[1:10:17] well all we're doing is worshipping the
[1:10:19] devil that's all we're doing and the
[1:10:25] devil wants nothing more than for you to
[1:10:28] give him praise that's a whole reason he
[1:10:31] came all the way down and separated
[1:10:34] himself from God we make mistakes
[1:10:40] brother sister I'm not saying well there
[1:10:42] he is
[1:10:43] that loose living no no I'm saying
[1:10:49] understand that you're going to get bit
[1:10:53] but don't acknowledge you get up and you
[1:10:58] move on you get up and you move on it
[1:11:05] does nobody any good to sit and sulk
[1:11:07] over your past over your sins of your
[1:11:11] faults over your mistakes
[1:11:15] I'm kind of a simple-minded guy I can I
[1:11:21] can think on one thing at a time my wife
[1:11:24] she can multitask with that thing it
[1:11:26] there but I once I get something in my
[1:11:29] mind I got a sink on it all the way
[1:11:32] through I'm going to a place I ain't got
[1:11:39] time for distractions my mind does not
[1:11:41] function that way so the more the devil
[1:11:45] can throw at you the more he could give
[1:11:47] you the more he could say oh look at you
[1:11:50] and shame shame you got snake bit how
[1:11:57] you gonna make it how are you gonna make
[1:11:59] it you ain't even got the Holy Ghost how
[1:12:02] are you gonna do it I've seen you do
[1:12:07] this or that how are you gonna make it
[1:12:10] how you call yourself the bride you get
[1:12:21] your mind going in that direction and
[1:12:25] you'll wrestle with something for months
[1:12:27] and months and months and all you're
[1:12:32] doing is delaying Rome you're going to
[1:12:40] Rome
[1:12:41] he's been prophesied you're going to
[1:12:43] Rome
[1:12:45] I was going to Rome in spite of the
[1:12:51] snakebite don't roam but our testimony
[1:12:58] is going to be tested it's going to
[1:13:02] happen but if we spend so much time
[1:13:07] being of time we spend so much time
[1:13:12] soaking in and taking everything that
[1:13:17] the devil throws at us acknowledging it
[1:13:19] beating ourselves up over it it's not
[1:13:23] doing us any good no good young people
[1:13:30] I've seen it over and over and over
[1:13:32] again you're young you don't have
[1:13:36] Abraham's experience yet your experience
[1:13:38] you just started out in salvation you're
[1:13:40] getting that yeah that change young
[1:13:43] Christians you're starting to go through
[1:13:45] some trials some things and you get

[1:13:57] in you you were going to Rome
[1:14:02] don't sit there with that snake shake it
[1:14:07] off in the fire and move on he wants us
[1:14:10] to move on we're trying to put this
[1:14:14] thing on we're trying to get this body
[1:14:16] change before we can get the body change
[1:14:21] we've got to get our minds right my man
[1:14:35] let's turn to this is my probably my
[1:14:38] favorite scripture let's turn to Isaiah
[1:14:41] 43

[1:15:07] is where I go

[1:33:02] let's stand I gotta quit
[1:33:09] [Applause]
[1:33:21] Isaac was a manifestation of Abraham's
[1:33:28] testimony they got tested that boat Rome
[1:33:37] was a manifestation of Paul's testimony
[1:33:40] and they got tested we have a goal we
[1:33:46] have a purpose we have a predestinated
[1:33:51] destination that we are headed to and it
[1:34:03] don't matter how many shipwrecks we get
[1:34:04] into it don't matter how many times the
[1:34:08] snake bites us it don't matter how we
[1:34:12] look at that mountain and say God how
[1:34:14] are you going to do this I can't connect
[1:34:18] the pieces because I've got this flesh
[1:34:20] in my way I've got this thing in my way
[1:34:26] that it's Abba setting sin and it seems
[1:34:28] like it hitting me over and over and
[1:34:32] over again I make mistake after mistake
[1:34:35] after mistake how am I going to go up
[1:34:40] the mountain and back down again my
[1:34:45] testimony is being tested right now
[1:34:51] every day you walk wake up it's being
[1:34:58] tested
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:03] we're starting to see the manifestation
[1:35:06] of our testimony we were not just
[1:35:14] camping around the message anymore
[1:35:17] understand what I'm saying I love this
[1:35:19] message I love what brother Branham got
[1:35:22] us where he's brought us and it's been
[1:35:27] God I love it
[1:35:29] [Music]
[1:35:32] but when I was a kid it wasn't this it
[1:35:41] was it was distorted and warped I grew
[1:35:48] up thinking brother Branham was
[1:35:49] infallible I did not that anymore
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:35:57] the focus has changed
[1:36:04] for a while there we were talking so
[1:36:08] much about how that it's the word this
[1:36:12] Bible and it is it is absolutely I'm not
[1:36:19] downplaying that but we've turned
[1:36:23] another corner
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:28] we need this we need the message what's
[1:36:31] the last piece us it's us if this word
[1:36:43] could be born in Mary and surely surely
