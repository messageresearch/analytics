I pray not that thou should take them out of the world the more I see of the world the more I want to come out that I want less and less to do with it Jesus on prayer I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou shall just keep them from the evil that's my prayer keep us from evil keep us together let perfect Oneness abound okay God bless you all have a wonderful time in God today [Applause] [Music] God bless you all we're just going to start with singing The Heart of Worship so I believe that's where we're at right now in the Heart of Worship and if you just have an expectation to be in that place and stay in worship just watch what God will do for the service and for you in the music fades [Music] away [Music] and I simply come [Music] longing just you to bring something that's a word that won't bless your heart I'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have required you search much deeper within to the way things appear you're looking into my heart [Music] I'm coming back to the heart worship and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus king of in this world and no one could express how much you deserve [Music] until I'm weakened poor God all I have is yours every single breath this should be us right now I'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have required [Music] you search much deeper within to the way things appear you're looking into my heart [Music] I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the peace and it's all about you it's all about you and I'm sorry the Lord for the thing as made it and it's all about you

how many appreciates uh your youth leaders and um you know there's people that make a lot of sacrifices and and they spend their money and they you know give of their time and they do these things and

with me but uh no we appreciate I thought that was a good illustration he used there last night and and uh it just goes to show you the power of suggestion you know and just uh you know that's exactly the tactics of the enemy and so we just want to remember that tonight amen how many would have a knee tonight you just want to make it known by uplifted hand we just want to go to the Lord tonight and as we pray let's just lift those things up before the Lord Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord for another opportunity that you've given us to come and just gather together tonight and and Lord we look out and we see this group of young people and and Lord as we've said already we're so proud lord to see God that Lord you know as your Prophet said every generation gets a chance at the word and Lord when I look out and I see this generation of young people and and Lord I see what they're doing with their chance Lord I'm certainly proud to be identified with that and Lord we're so thankful God that you've given given us this time and Lord to come together and Lord and have fellowship with one another and and Lord they've enjoyed theirselves and their there's other activities and things that they'll continue to do but but God these this this is a special moment now Lord where we come Lord into the sanctuary and Lord we're looking into your word and and Lord we just asked God that you would just come and and Lord that you would be Lord not an onlooker tonight or just an unseen guest Lord or a recording Angel but but God we're inviting you to take preeminence in this service and we want you to have an active part Lord and Lord we want you to speak to us Lord and Lord I pray that you would anoint lips of clay and anoint our hearts Lord to Lord to receive in our ears to hear and Lord because we know oh God that Lord you alone it would take you to actually change your life Lord we could we can only yield ourselves to you but Lord we're so limited and what we could do as men but Lord we know Lord what your power can do and Lord therefore we're asking you to come we're inviting you to come and Lord we're not only inviting you to come but Lord we're giving you the preeminence and so God Just Have Your Way in this service speak to us God as we commit ourselves into your hands now we give this service to You For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you take your Bibles we'll turn to the Book of Matthew and I'd like to read one verse there and then I'd also read uh it's Matthew chapter 4. and verse number 17. just one verse of scripture there and then also from The Book of John John chapter 6. and I'll read verse 66. Matthew chapter 4. and the 17th verse and the Bible says from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is a hand in the Book of John in the sixth chapter in the 66th verse and from that time many of his disciples went back and walk with him or I'm sorry walk no more with him amen this of course is just after Jesus had begun to say unto them except a man um you know Eat My Flesh and drink my bloody have no life and and then you know the multitudes begin to walk away and I think that is striking there it says from that time see many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him amen may God add His blessings as you're seated tonight I'd like to just take a few minutes and I'm going to speak to you um uh just got some things that's on her heart and I want to speak to you if I had a title would be from that time and of course we know brother Branham spoke many times he would take the the title uh and take the text there and and preach he you know sometimes he would title and from that time or from that time and and so um you know I believe that some of these simple things that that the prophet would say you know brother brother Daryl uh some of the sermons that brother Brown would preach over and over and over you know to to some it may seem like it's simple but I believe that if a prophet of God that was sent to an age thought enough about it to to preach it not just to preach it but to preach it over again I believe that there's got to be something in it that God's trying to to uh to speak to us and and so I'd like to just look at some of these things tonight and and so I'm going to read a few quotes out of the sermon and from that time and some several different places but brother Brown would say um there in 1959 in Jeffersonville he said you know as as human beings we all think of things from a certain time such and such a thing is taking place and from that time see and now many times you meet an old man or an old woman and they like to refer back to a time that's something had taken place and they can can distinctively Market out and say it was at that time see and now I suppose that there's practically all of us here tonight could call to a memory or to a remembrance of certain things that's taken place at certain times and from from that time something changed see such a such a thing and it happened at that time and from that time on it was different and it's a good thing that we can can and some of those memories of things that we think of as worthy things that changed and then there's some things that's not so worthy of thinking of but see he's trying to show us that there was a time that it that it changed there was a time there was something even uh you know maybe there was a a certain situation or a certain thing that happened and it's something that you can always go back to and remember and you know it's like a um you know a place that uh uh you know you can always Market that that was the time that that things begin that's where it started I'll just put it like that that's where it started at and so brother Brown would say he said there's a time where you start see yes there was a time when all this stuff started there was a time when death started that's uh when Eve was strolling one day down through the Garden of Eden and met Satan and what did Brother Brown say he said so he's showing you that that you know it started there in the Garden of Eden but Brethren said when did it start it started when Eve stopped amen he let me just read it the way he said he said many are like Eve Eve just stopped long enough to be deceived if she hadn't have stopped there had never been no deceiving see but Eve stopped and when she stopped that's where she got her just deceiving instead of pressing on Amen they're in the greatest battle ever fought he said if Satan can get through there he's talking about through the the channels of of your five senses in the five senses of your spirit even which we know is a reason and conscience and memory imaginations and so forth amen and brother and brother Adam said if Satan can get through there by these and and and and and through the conscience and all these other things and he gets right down there in the mind now and if he can just get you uh uh then then and then you have to let him in brother Brown said you have to let him in you see amen he's coming with a thought amen but you have to let him in amen and then he says and then when he gets in now he's got control and then what does he do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this he begins to use the outlet see what is it of taste feel smell hear imaginations conscience memory reasons affections he begins to use all those different little channels and as long as he could get uh get in above this one here then he's coming to your mind and first you have to accept it amen amen when it when Satan walked up to Eve and said you know the fruit is Pleasant she stopped for a moment see and that's where she made her mistake amen when she stopped for a moment don't you stop for nothing you got a message Jesus Lives God Is A Healer that's the mess don't you stop for nothing don't stop for no reason or nothing else amen but see she stopped for a moment and that's when Satan walked right into that mind and said well it sounds reasonable even now oh don't do that amen you just take what God Said Amen if I could encourage you with anything tonight amen you just take what God Said Amen don't you stop for nothing don't you amen even listen amen don't you even uh entertain amen the devil's thoughts can you say amen amen don't amen make this mistake to stop because amen watch what brother Brown's saying amen it started when she stopped amen that's where it started amen you know I was thinking about this and amen I'm just going to mention I'll come back around to it but brother Branham went in to pray amen you know they were having a meeting and there was a there was a lot of bad cases there and some of them was uh you know uh uh uh you know insane and so forth he said someone was even in straight jackets they couldn't even bring them in the public so they had a place set aside and brother Ben and went in there to pray and when he ran in there there was a a young lady in there and she began to talk to brother about he didn't even recognize that she had a problem but she began to talk to brother Branham and she began to tell him a little bit about her situation and and when she did she said you know I was raised in a good home and I I was raised by good parents and you know and I was taught right from wrong she said but one day I went out with a boy you know and and against her parents wishes she she began to go out with this boy and and she begins to tell him how it all started and she said you know she took a drink and and it just started right there just amen look friends amen it all started with one bad decision amen just one little drink and amen and it didn't end there but amen it just continued right on until that girl was in such a shape and she was in an insane institution amen listen even I'll tell you there ain't no end to the depths of Satan amen and the devil will take you amen father than you you ever want to go amen but it all starts somewhere it just starts with with one drink or or one look or amen just one touch or one bad decision amen you see one time that you ignore amen your parents and and you ignore amen good instructions and that's where it starts right there and then from that time see something began to change that brother man talked about a man that lied all the time and he said he said I thought he was joking he said he told such crazy stories that he meant it was just unbelievable he said I thought the guy was joking he said but he I sat down and began to talk to him I said why do you do that he said well he said it all start started with he said I remember exactly where it started the first lie I ever told he said I I was out there smoking some cigarettes and he said I ate a bunch of coffee trying to cover up my breath so my mama wouldn't find out he said but I got home my mama you know she she said Son what have you been doing amen there's something about mamas they just know don't they amen you young people know what I'm talking about you think you got it all figured out and hid and amen you covered it up real good but that Mom will find you out buddy amen and she she knew he'd been doing something and she said come here let me smell your breath and smelled that coffee on his breath and and she said what have you been doing what you're trying to cover up you've been out there smoking cigarettes he said oh no mama amen but he told Brother Benham he said amen some me and me was telling me that I ought to tell her the truth he said there there's something down inside of me was telling me I ought to be honest with her about it amen but he ignored that voice and he told her a lie he said Mama I promise I ain't been smoking cigarettes he said and from that day to this I can't stop lying and brother Brown said he told so many lies till he believed him himself amen think about it friends that's exactly you just think one little innocent thing like that if we could say it that way amen that's where it started but that ain't where it ends see amen just one little lie amen just one little look amen think about this brother I'm talking about the the maniac there of godira amen he said no doubt it was a sociable God-fearing citizen once lived and he got with the wrong crowd and maybe just he just got married had two or three little kids even but he got mixed up with the wrong group and that's where many a young man and a young woman loses out I'm getting mixed up with the wrong group with wrong Associates see amen and so one night they're taking him out and gave him a drink said oh let's just play a little game or do this or gamble a little bit it won't hurt nothing and then the first devil entered him right there amen and he went home and he had to tell his wife a lie and the second devil entered him right there until he was possessed with a legion of devils could you imagine amen you see what the prophet is saying amen amen when he went down there to that place he knew he had no business being that's where the first devil come in and then when he went home instead of Amen being honest and repenting amen amen he told a lie about where he had been and that's where the second devil come amen listen friends I'm telling you it's a reality this ain't just a story amen this ain't just something amen that the prophet dreamed up this is a reality that's how amen you get in the shape you're in amen listen free as you taught me any drug addict any alcoholic amen any sinner out there in the world you want to talk to amen they'll tell you amen amen amen they don't even know how they got in the shape they got in even if they didn't wake up one day amen just a full-blown drunk they didn't wake up one day amen just completely overtaken and Addicted by drugs and all them kind of things amen it all started somewhere amen maybe just with a little lie amen maybe just it started amen by going to a certain website that you know you ain't got no business being on that amen but amen you take one look and the next thing you know amen instead of you coming and repenting and raking that thing right amen you gotta lie about that amen and then another Devil comes in amen then after a while amen you went so far and you're so bound amen by demons amen that you could be in the very condition amen that Legion found himself in and oh one night they take listen amen the prophet of God said amen that the devil amen kept on uh uh uh driving this man amen he drove him right on out into the tombs amen did you ever notice the devil likes the dwell in the tombs the devil stays around all dead places amen and I don't include that don't exclude rather churches either amen when they get cold it becomes a devil's hangout I say oh God Amen don't ever let our churches get cold amen listen Riz don't you never let your experience get cold amen don't you never Amen Let You amen your experience with God get cold amen because that's where the devil likes to hang around amen but watch what the prophet of God said and we see this poor old fella Legion out there maybe once in a while like what brother Brown said once in a while he would come to himself and he would just look and say what am I doing here amen look amen look there's chains all around him and thank things like that his body all cut up and the devil would throw him back into his spell and here he'd go and then maybe he'd come back around again and think I got a wife and children somewhere and the first thing you know the devil would pull him right back down into another spell and here he'd go amen but think about it all started amen with one little lie amen it all started amen just with one bad decision amen think about that's just how it starts amen and the devil will come to you amen like the prophet of God said amen Eve made her mistake when she stopped and listened to the devil's life amen listen Friends James the fourth chapter says resist the devil amen listen amen the Bible tells us what did James say he says submit yourself therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you amen and brother Brandon would pick it up in perfect faith and he said we're taught to resist the devil and he'll flee from us now to resist him is simply to turn him down amen just resist him that's right just walk away from it amen let me tell you I think there's too many of us it's given the devil too much attention amen and we're listening to him for too long amen you're giving him too much of your time friend amen you ought to resist that devil amen you ought to amen stand up against that devil amen just turn him down flat even just walk away hallelujah amen I tell you what friends anything that's trying to lead you away from God or his word amen you ought to walk away from that thing you ought to resist it even cast it down don't listen to it the greatest spout I ever fought brother Brown says see his tactic see what he's trying to do the first human being he's trying to anoint that precious woman there God's daughter with unbelief in God's word that's exactly what he's trying to get her to do that's what he's trying to do to you honey brother Brown's speaking to somebody in the audience there a little girl that was sick his sister that was sick he said that's what he's trying to get you to do honey what was he trying to do get her to doubt God's word listen I'm gonna tell you there's a battle going on it's going on right now in this building right here right now tonight there's a battle going on amen and Satan is trying even to anoint you to to unbelief to disbelieve God's word listen even right every time you come to the house of God and the word is being preached amen the devil is right there amen and he's sitting on your shoulder and he's telling you amen this ain't for you and amen and you're never going to make it and this ain't gonna happen amen but it's like brother brother Michael Bailey was telling you amen it's up to you are you going to believe that amen amen the prophet of God said you either God you've got an opportunity to accept it or reject it hallelujah amen I encourage you to reject the LIE of the devil now listen brother bam is going to teach you how to deal with it he said the only thing you have to do now see you're a Freemore agent you can accept it if you want to but kick it out see Satan's Army brings diseases and God's armies is commissioned to cast them out there you are every time Satan throws any on anything on to you God's Army is is to cast it out amen cast out that's the very technique that God used Satan used an army of Destruction to disbelieve God's word and set him up a better Kingdom than Michael had and God cast him out amen God's method is to cast out evil cast down reason and cast down superstitions cast down worry cast down diseases cast down sin amen you're above it resurrected in Christ Jesus setting in Heavenly places every devil under your feet and if he starts to stick his head up in there amen amen what happened to one of them amen one of them doubters when he got into heaven God kicked him out and what did he say to the soldiers that's raised in Christ when the Devil comes along kick him out cast him out amen Jesus trained his army and commissioned them to the ends of the world going into all the world preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth amen not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe Hallelujah my soldiers in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take a surface or if they drink any deadly they won't harm them and if they lay hands on the sick the sick shall recover hallelujah amen that's your commission let me just tell you amen you young people here tonight amen oh amen you have to be to qualify for Mark 16 is a believer [Applause] thank you you ain't gotta be a prophet you ain't got to be a preacher you ain't got to be a deacon

of your bedroom throw him out of your car throw him out of your home throw him out of the church I know what I'm talking about amen sometimes you come to church and think man this man is tight in here sometimes you come to church and you're thinking I wish a song leader would do something or I wish somebody do I wish somebody to you know get this thing moving and all it is is Amanda is an old Spirit sitting on the on the service and even somebody got their feelings hurt or somebody was arguing I don't know what in the world happened but amen but somebody brought something with them amen

make me nervous preaching to young people because amen I love preaching to young people amen because I remember you know and I was just telling brother Daryl back here in the back I said man that's crazy how time just goes because when I first took the church there in North Carolina and a little group there there's a group of young people and them young people's done grown up now they're married and having kids and and I thought man what in the world happened I said if the last if the next uh 10 or 11 years goes like the last I'm going to turn around be an old man one day amen but you know amen but I tell you this I tell you what amen was a Revival in our church amen them young people they began to be a move of God Among the young people and they moved to the front row of that church amen and I tell you what I knew as a pastor amen there was one group I could depend on every service because they wasn't caught up in all the disagreements and arguments and amen and they didn't know about the church splits and the problems and amen and all the different doctrines around the message and all the arguments between every everybody amen they didn't know about none of that stuff even all they knew is they loved God Amen they loved his word hallelujah and I'm telling you tonight don't you never lose that don't you never you lose that as a youth of this message amen don't you never get caught up in all the politics and the ins and outs and who's in and who's out and who's right who's wrong what difference does that make tonight amen if you love God and you love his word hallelujah just come with an attitude I come to worship my king I come to worship my God I'm not here amen rallying around a personality I'm here even rallying around the gift of God Amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah what God do kicked him out a little brother bear said at greatest battles of my favorite sermons but he said he talked about Grant you know General Grant he said how do you take Richmond he said just as he come to it amen and that's how he took see listen that's how he took Richmond and that's how God's soldiers take sin sickness just as they come to it amen that's a way to overcome doubts and fears and things when one Rises chop him down and say move out of the way oh my that's it God cast them out like he did in Hell our great Chief Captain showed us how it was done what did Paul say Amen there in second Corinthians 10 and 5 he said casting down imaginations and every High thing that exhausted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought Amen to The Obedience of Christ hallelujah amen what's Paul telling you to do amen when that amen when that reason begins to come listen for his amen that's the channel that the devil Works through amen he'll come right in through imaginations and reason and amen memory I know what I'm talking about he'll use both the five senses amen with your cities smell and hear and all that amen he'll use those sizes amen United together with the Five Sisters of the spirit and you'll see something and that'll trigger a memory or yours smell something and that'll trigger a memory or you hear something amen amen I tell you some of the older people will know what I'm talking about amen you go to pumping gas at a gas station you hear that old song man amen and it's uh amen you know and you remember amen not that you hear it and you remember it amen that's where the devil began to work on you right there he comes right through the channels of that you know what you got to do you got to recognize Satan and you've got to recognize his tactics and you've got to cast him down you got to throw him out you got to realize amen that didn't come from God hallelujah that thought didn't come from God let me tell you some church even if there's anything I'm just I don't know why I'm here but I feel to say it right now if there's any thought coming in your mind telling you that this message ain't thus saith the Lord that didn't come from God Hallelujah that's a land devil a lion spirit I know the devil hates this message amen but I want to tell you amen this message is Jesus Christ this message is not amen just a bunch of Doctrine this message is not the mind of a Kentucky boy this message come from the Throne of God it's the very mind of Christ revealed to you and I and it's got a power in it that can deliver amen that can make free hallelujah it's got a power in it that's going to change our bodies no wonder the devil hates it [Applause] I tell you right now anything comes along begins to try to put doubt in your mind about this message it didn't come from God and I'll tell you what you need to do cast it out say well I think probably what we ought to do is research I know you better not stay out of that junk listen friends I mean we don't need no research I how does it feel like preaching amen I'm way off my nose but y'all making it sir I done told you you had the power to do it so you're doing it amen but I'm telling you this and hi friends listen amen we ain't trying to figure out whether this message is right or not we ain't trying to figure out amen tonight we're brother we are not here Amen to vindicate the message of the hour it's done been Vindicated Hallelujah and God has already put a seal of approval upon it I tell you this amen when God come behind that little prophet and backed up the words that he said he was putting his step of approval on this message and I say this anything that God approves I prove it to you and anything that God will say Amen to I also will put my voice in my amen with the amen of God this message is truth [Applause] let me try to get into a few things here and we're just gonna move on but try to let God have his way I love this because Brother Band will begin to say you know from that time even is a he starts out by showing how people got in the shape that they were in and you know as I've already said I told a little lie here took that drink over here but then brother generally begins to turn it around and he begins to show he begins to take all kinds of examples through the scripture I love this one here because brother Brown talks about a leper that was laying out the gate one day and he said all the remedies of medicine could not heal him his sores gotten so great until his hands was beyond raising up anymore and his feet could hardly he could hardly drag him his case was hopeless but he met God one day coming out of the gate and he fell down and said If thy will thou can make me clean Hallelujah amen and listen amen and he said speaking of Jesus I will be thou clean and from that time Hallelujah he didn't have no more leprosy amen listen friends amen that man remember leprosy represents sin is that right and that man amen was in such a case as such a situation that brother Brown said his hands couldn't lift up no more you know what he said amen he was so overtaken with the leprosy amen of sin in his life amen that there was such a condemnation if I could just use it this way and he couldn't lift his hands in church his feet was so tore up amen with that disease amen that he could not he had to drag himself amen he was beyond all hope amen but one day he met Jesus and he said I believe if you will you can make me whole if you will you can heal me if you will you can clean me up and Jesus just looked at him and said I will Hallelujah be that whole listen rizz he didn't need a six weeks Revival he didn't need even nobody pouring no buckets all on him he didn't need nothing but the word of the Lord he just said I believe if you will you can and Jesus said I will amen may it be done is there anybody in here tonight that believes that Jesus could change your life I don't care what kind of situation you're in I don't care how bad it is how many beliefs are here if he will he can Hallelujah well let me tell you he will he's here and he's saying I will believe it and receive it [Applause] and brother Bill he said he he starts talking about blind Bartimaeus he said and there he was sitting there he blind you know what brother brother Tim blind butter messy he was he heard the Bible said he heard listen I love this because he couldn't see Jesus but somebody told him that Jesus is near and brother he didn't have to see him he believed because he heard a message somebody was telling him the man that can help you is right he's in reach he's close by listen Ramsey you ain't got to see amen I believe people can see lights and I believe people can see Visions I believe people can see amen a visible manifestation I believe people seen the pillar of fire in the angel Lord I ain't trying to preach against none of that but you ain't got to see him to believe [Applause] amen believe this he's in the building tonight hallelujah amen you say brother what do you mean I believe he's here because he promised to be here oh friends if I if he would show himself in a visible way we had all Rejoice amen and thank God for that remember I'm not preaching against that how many loves to feel God I mean he's ever felt God amen amen you have you felt God how many loves to feel God Amen and we believe amen that God will come sometimes and we thank God for them blessings and he comes down and that's a great blessing to be able to feel the presence of the Lord amen but I'm telling you this whether I see him or whether I feel him it don't make no difference to me tonight amen my Bible says we're two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in the midst amen so if I don't see nothing and I don't feel nothing I can still declare unto you tonight that he is here hallelujah the one that can help you is in the building tonight and as soon as they told blind bar tomorrow Mayors Jesus is near he cried out that son of David have mercy on me listen friends the prophet shows it very clearly it was all kinds of things going on there was all kind of noise amen Jesus didn't hear him with his natural ears amen but blind Bartimaeus was not crying out amen just with a loud voice although I believe he was amen but I believe that he was crying out in the spirit and the Bible says that Jesus Stood Still The Cry of that blind man stop Jesus in his tracks and Jesus Stood Still and Jesus told him what did he do he bit him come and the Bible said he left to his feet cast off His Garment oh friends amen he made his way to Jesus and let me just say this to you tonight amen because blind Bartimaeus is known in the scripture as blind Bartimaeus amen but that was only a name that was attached to him because of a condition that is not who he was amen I can show you examples all through the scripture amen Rahab the Harlot amen Tom doubting Thomas amen Legion was known as Legion amen that was not his name amen that was a name attached to him because of a condition amen but when they met Jesus hallelujah amen when blind Bartimaeus met Jesus the Blind part had to fall off because brother amen once he come in contact with Jesus he was no longer blind Bartimaeus he was simply part of mass Hallelujah and they may have passed all kind of names on you and rightfully so but that ain't who you are tonight that's only representing a condition that you may be in but I want to tell you something not if you can ever meet Jesus amen that part that attached part even that identification of your condition will have to fall off Hallelujah even doubting Thomas once he reached out and touched them nail scarred ass he was no longer doubting Thomas he was now a believing son of the most high god brother he reached out and touched his hand and he said Jesus my Lord and my God when rehab come in contact with the god of Israel she wasn't no Harley no more oh no she was elevated to the very lineage of Jesus Christ come on Church don't you let the devil identify Who You Are don't you let this world attach no name on you come on Friends that ain't Who You Are I know the devil come along trying to tell you I know he's trying to attach all every every kind of uh uh name Amen to your life because of a condition perhaps or or or some kind of situation or circumstance amen but I tell you what amen if you ever meet Jesus one time amen there are some other things that will be attached to your name hallelujah amen you won't be a blind Bartimaeus amen but amen that you're being Overcomer hallelujah amen there'll be some other things attached to your name like an overcomer like a Believer like invincible Hallelujah you believe that tonight brother Brown talking about this this Maniac of gadira he says this young man no doubt a good citizen of the of the of the country he said but he was so bad until the prison house couldn't hold him they bound him with chains he had a legion of devils in him like he could break the chains and free himself drove him out to the graveyard where he stayed took amen he's so mean he'd cut his own self terrible fella spells would leave him no doubt he'd think what am I doing here any of you ever get so wrapped up in things and and you know you're going the wrong way but you know it's just like it seems like it's out of your control but then every now and then you just you begin to think how did I get in this situation how did I get here someone begins to speak to you and you know this ain't what I'm supposed to be this is not who I am there's a young man back home and I'm not gonna I'll be careful how I say things but you know he's been battling a long time and nobody just the other day you know I believe you have one of them moments he out there all caught up you know and been raised right and set in church and I'm going to tell you we'd unclaimed him I might want to go ahead and take this opportunity and tell y'all you done being cleaned you can run if you want to but you won't outrun it I mean you got but you got pastors that's claim to you you've got family that's claiming you got mamas and daddies that's put you under a token you can run but I guarantee you ain't gonna outrun it but this young man he just come to himself for a moment and he began realizing and and the Lord spoke to him said begin to tell him deal with his heart he began to do with him he said you need to witness to this boy this certain boy that he'd been hanging out with just a center boy and I'm not going to get in a lot of detail here about because I want to be careful and respect his this young man but you know what his daddy was telling me he said when he started telling telling this he he finally gave into it brother Joe and he's he's riding back with this boy this boy they didn't know you know been hanging out with this boy just uh old Center boy and and uh he he's riding down the road he said I need to talk to you he said I need to tell you who I really am even in the shape he was in he knew this ain't Who I Really Am en listen amen you you have the moments you come to yourself that's what brother man was saying what's happening with him he would come to himself he'd say how did I get here brother man begin to talk about that Soul was crying out and I I just think this is amazing because listen I don't even believe for the most part that that this man was even consciously crying out to God like I don't believe that he was you know with his mouth or or you know he may have not even been even kneeling down and praying amen that's but but yet down in him somewhere deep down in there that Saul was crying out Hallelujah even though his mind was completely overtaken by the devil amen the devil couldn't have that soul hallelujah amen I'll give you an example of that quickly Amen brother Brown was over in Africa amen one time and amen there when he was there an African a great meeting and you'll remember Amen brother Branham they brought this boy up on the on the platform and remember brother Daryl he's being led like a dog with a chain around his neck and he was walking like an animal and brother Benham amen said that boy was in that condition had been in that condition all his life amen and completely out of his mind this young boy amen but when they brought that boy up on the platform you know what brother bam said he said that he amen that boy in that condition amen was was was thinking about his brother who had been crippled by falling off of a goat or something amen and he was a crippled boy and that boy listen for his he couldn't even stand up he could not even talk he could not even walk he went completely out of his mind amen but that just goes to show you amen the devil may have your mind but he'll never have your heart hey if you belong to God even there's certain things that the devil may be able to take control of but he cannot have that predestinated seed [Applause] fat boy in that condition had his brother on his heart brother Brown saw a vision called the boy out the boy was healed the crippled boy his brother and brother Brown saw that boy the boy that was on the platform standing up he turned and he said I love that I love that testimony amen because he turned back that boy among that authority of the word of God he had seen a vision he said thus saith the Lord amen the boy will be healed amen delivered amen and I remember this brother brother Daryl amen the boy didn't have the strength to stand amen so brother Branham reached down and he took hold of that chain that they had around that boy's neck and he said I reached down and took hold of that and lifted him up hallelujah amen and he said when he began to stand on his feet I seen tears running down his face I seen that and there he stood for the first time clothing is Right mine I'll tell you what friends amen this is an insane age hallelujah it's overcome with Insanity it's an age of neurotics amen and the devil would love to destroy your mind but I want to tell you there is an answer for the insanity of this age and it's Jesus Christ Hallelujah and I believe he's in the building tonight and he'll reach down his hand he better take hold of the chain of bondage that might be on your life and lift you up I believe you can be delivered tonight you believe it's true Brother Brad I'm talking about this boy this young man or this this man in this condition I love this because he said that Soul crying out to God think about this Jesus left great revivals crossed Land and Sea to hear one boy took to deliver one one listen the whole Revival in that country the only thing that come out of it was one man delivered you know what he was delivered and when they found him the Bible says he was clothed because remember he the Bible speaks of how he had in this condition he had stripped itself naked brother Brown uses that to show the insanity of this age their neck and they don't know it even and and here he is in this condition but as soon as he meets Jesus I mean I love this brother Daryl because you know what amen Jesus amen that even them demons recognized him and one place in the scripture says they said why do you come to torment us before the time they recognized him and then they even pleaded with him amen give us somebody somebody to enter into I mean they they looked over and he saw a herd of swine over there on the hill and he and and they and they they asked Jesus can we go and enter into them and and I love them one account of the in the gospel there he just simply says one word go Hallelujah amen that's all it takes friends let me just tell you this tonight amen that man had a legion of devils in him completely insane look at the condition that he was in and one word from Jesus he was completely delivered hallelujah amen Jesus didn't have to preach a two-hour sermon amen he didn't have to stand there and pray and pray and pray amen he just stood there with the authority amen as a Son of God Amen and he stood there and said go and the Devils went Hallelujah and they went over and got in them swine and the swines run off a cliff and drowned themselves in the sea and and when they found this man he was clothed in his right mind and everything all the testimony that they had heard and what had happened proved to be true so you know what they done they all got together and they said we want now now Jesus just clear your schedule because we want you over at our church next week and and we want you to come hold a Revival for us and and we want you to come down here and we got all kind of people and and we need to go over here and I I can think about 15 people right now this really got all kind of problems and and you know we're going to bring them to Jesus read your Bibles they asked him to leave Jesus had just performed A great miracle and a man had been delivered amen of all these devils and the condition that he was in and you know what the response that he got from the people they asked him to leave they invited him to leave you know what brother Brown said he said they they didn't want them no Revival in their country amen because it was going to cost them too much he they didn't want no Revival amen he said it was going to cost them some Hogs it was going to cross them some pigs amen listen for his there's a lot of people in the same condition today they don't want a move of God in their Church they don't want a Revival to come down amen it's going to cost them too much and it will cost you something it'll cost you Pride it'll cost you all yes sir amen it's going to cost you something but I'll tell you this I'd rather have a Revival I'd rather even have a move of God whatever it costs Hallelujah is there anybody with me tonight I say whatever the cost may be I'm willing to pay the price Let There Be Revival in the house of God let Souls be delivered let the sick be healed let somebody get the Holy Ghost [Applause] listen I'm going to try to I'm going to try to close but I'm just going to tell you this tonight you can't meet God and remain the same you know brother brother Brown teaches us something very powerful he says every time you come together even like this you're changed you cannot leave the same way you came you got you're either going to leave better or you're going to leave worse how many days that's true amen how many would like to just make a make up your mind tonight and go ahead and make a decision right now I'm going to leave here better I'm going to leave here better I'm going to leave amen with more of God I'm going to leave with a closer walk I'm going to leave here amen with a renewing and a refreshing and a re and a more consecrated dedicated life in in the Holy Ghost because you can't leave the same you cannot meet God and stay the same you know what brother Brown said he said one day you're on your own Calvary when God Met Death he said God and death met face to face and when life and death come together that's when life Christ pulled the stinger out of death and since that time death hadn't had no stinger in it he said I'm so glad of that death and God met together and death hasn't been the same since amen it ain't got no Stinger to it no more a Christian believer can walk right into the face of it and say oh death where is your sting old grave where is your Victory they both met God and they ain't been the same since Hallelujah and no man can be the same nothing can be the same once it meets God hallelujah let me tell you his friends if God's got the power that he could even change death amen I believe it can change you tonight amen and once you meet God you'll never be the same I if y'all give me a little bit of Liberty I got to say this tonight amen there's a lot of things that might happen when you meet God Amen you might speak in tongues you might not you might dance you might not you might shout you might not I believe in all them things amen but you might do that you might not you might cry you might not but if you ever meet God one time out amen your life will be different your desire will be different Hallelujah you'll be changed Hallelujah that is not optional that is a fact [Applause] listen in closing Moses said I mean I'm sorry brother bear I'm talking about Moses brother amen he said he's talking about Moses and how Moses met uh the pillar of Fire he said when a man meets God something takes place he said there was a time when a man had been trained in all the wisdom all the Theology of the word of God he noted by letter he'd been to school he had all the degrees he was so smart until he could teach the Egyptian soldiers and their teachers he knowed it all by letter but he was a coward with it run out there and went on the backside of the desert hurting sheep but there come a time when God met him there in a burning bush and from that time on Moses was changed because he met God in a burning bush and face to face with God he couldn't be the same anymore oh my when a man or a woman I don't care how many vows you make or how many new pages you turn until you meet God and you will not be changed but once you ever meet God Amen then you're changed forever and it didn't only change Moses it changed Israel it changed Egypt it changed the world at that time because one man met God and took him out his word oh friends amen do you hear what the prophet is saying amen the whole world was changed in the time of Moses because one man met God and took him out his word listen friends I'm going to tell you something amen you don't even realize what could happen in a meeting like this if you one of you young people could really meet God face to face and have an experience with the God of this Bible amen it won't only change you it'll change your home it'll change your family it'll change your church it'll change you oh listen it'll change your friends amen you don't even realize even the power of it amen because one man met God and took him out his word Moses the coward the one that was running Hallelujah have been changed and from that time he become a servant of the Lord listen it always works that way when God meets man things are changed because I was listening brother Wayne Lawson preaching on it preaching about Moses and he was preaching away he's and I just thought it was so powerful the way he put it he said listen he said when Moses when Moses walked away from that burning bush brother Joe he was carrying the same stick listen God didn't give him that sticky at the burning bush he already had it in his hand it was the same old stick brother Bram called a crooked stick it was the same stick Israel was still captive Pharaoh was still pharaoh the Egyptian Army was still the same Army listen every condition everything every circumstance that was before the Burning Bush was the same circumstance after the burning bush the only thing that changed was a heart that was in that prophet [Music] Hallelujah let me just say this tonight amen amen if God would change you tonight by the power of his word and by the power of the Holy Ghost amen when you walk out of them doors yeah the same problems you had yesterday will still be there amen the same circumstances that you had will still be right there but there will be something different amen because if God can change you it'll change the whole thing hallelujah amen you'll have the same battles but now you'll have the victory amen because he overcome will be in the inside and my Bible says greater it's he that is in you that he that is in the world listen for his the pull of the world will still be there but there'll be something different because there'll be another ball and the other bull will be greater than the pull of the world Hallelujah if God can change you it'll change everything you believe it tonight let me just say this brother Brown said five minutes as a musicians come tonight five minutes in the presence of God did more for Moses than 40 years of training five minutes you know what brother Brown said he said what Moses lacked was in the burning bush the burning bush had what Moses lacked say something else is very powerful the fire that was in that bush didn't stay in the bush but the fire that was in that bush got in Moses and brother bam in one place he would tie together and he said because every one of us listen friends because I'm just going to tell you this tonight brother Brown said no man said stand behind this sacred desk and preach the gospel until he's met God on the backside of the desert and had his own burning bush experienced amen no man has a right that's what brother he didn't listen you ain't got a right to stand but there's another place brother Brown said you shouldn't even call yourself a Christian until you also have had an experience face to face with God in one place brother Brown would tied together he said the burning bush experience to us is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost listen friends amen I'm going to tell you this tonight it's available to you you can meet God tonight amen you can meet him in this church amen you can meet him in a in a bedroom you can meet him amen God will meet you he met Moses even you know what brother Brown said brother Daryl I love how brother Brown would put it amen he was walking down an old familiar path just an ordinary day walking down an old familiar path but he saw a sight he saw something caught his attention is that right something caught his attention he said I believe I'll turn aside and see brother Brown said has he begin to approach he said he come with the right attitude he said if you approach god listen friends it ain't got to be a special meeting it might just be a Wednesday night service and you're walking down an old familiar path maybe you didn't even want to come to church that night and mama said get up boy we're going to church and just walking in an old familiar path and then all of a sudden but something catches your attention something begins to attract you some begins to speak to your heart you turn inside to see you know what brother Branham he's talking about that that young girl he said probably 20 25 years old he walked in that room and where all them he said people people in the conditions they were in insane and straight jackets everything else I love how brother Brown tells this testimony he says he says something very powerful and he says she walks up to him and begins to talk to him and he said he looked around he said you know all the people in the shape there and he said I don't know Harley where to start and that little girl looked at her that young lady looked at him and said sir once you start with me maybe somebody in here tonight maybe that'd be your attitude the Lord passing through the room just now and is anybody in here just want to say Lord just start with me he said can I talk to you a little while and tell you a little bit about my story she begins to talk to him and he listens to her and she begins to share all the things that she had went through and she tried to get help and then she just ended up right back in the same condition she is in she tried it this way and went this direction and religion had failed her are you hearing me tonight religion had failed her medicine and Felder doctors at Felder she didn't seem like there's no hope brotherbraham looked at her he said you're a beautiful girl of what he desire to be a mother and be a wife and he said oh yeah yes brother Brandon I'd love to do those things but who would have me who would want to who would who would take me he began to talk to her about the blood of Jesus Christ he said the blood of Jesus Christ has got the power in it to take you back

me when he brought the word but there was those that when the word came forth from that time on they followed him there's many here tonight there's some of y'all can remember when you got the Holy Ghost some can't some options God's just stealed in your soul that by Revelation that you have it there are some that can remember that time when God put his life in you and sealed that life in you to the day your Redemption you could remember where you was what you were doing how it felt and from that time but from that time till today Satan has talked to you every day he's made you doubt that every day he told you you didn't get healed I don't know how many times I've had youth come up to me and said brother Joe I don't I don't I don't think I got the Holy Ghost I got prayed for it I didn't think I got the Holy Ghost [Music] it's just don't listen to a lie of the devil don't listen to one thing that Satan's got to say to you you could tell him you take him back to that time and you say Satan you remember from that time from that time it might have been last year might have been the last campaign you went to might have been the prayer line you went through but you can point him and if you can't Point him there you point him to Calvary that's where it happened yeah because Jesus said those that walked away from him Jesus Jesus told them I'm gonna go away in a little bit they turned around and walked away from him and he told him he said I'm I'm going away soon he said but I'll come again I'll be with you and I'll be in you to the end of the world that was a promise he didn't give you any instructions to do that so you got to do this you've got to you've got to live this way you've got to say this he said it's a free gift it's a free gift so if you leave tonight without it that's not his fault he's offering it to you he wants to give it to you more than you want it me and brother Josh was talking last night about young people wanting the Holy Ghost they think it's so hard they think it's some special remedy that you've got to get to get the Holy Ghost like I said brother God wants to give it to you more than you want it you just have to desire it more than anything else in your life anything you have in your life that you enjoy that you like that you want when you get to the point where you desire the Holy Ghost more than the greatest thing you desire you'll have it that's a promise that's a promise God's never failed one time he's never slipped up one time he's never made one mistake and he's got the easiest remedy to Salvation and eternal life that has ever been so I urge you tonight make that your main goal whether it's tonight whether it's tomorrow the next day whatever your purpose you wake up with that my main goal is life in this life is to receive his life in here nothing else matters because anything else that you would possess that you hold so dear you're not taking it with you that's the only thing that you'll take with you when you leave I didn't mean to preach for the job so but thank you all for coming give brother Josh a hand that was wonderful [Music] I can't wait till the old people get to hear Brother Josh
