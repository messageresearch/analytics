[32:07] certainly greet you tonight in the name
[32:09] of the Lord Jesus what a privilege it is
[32:11] for us to be gathered together tonight
[32:15] everybody feeling the pressure for our
[32:16] meeting coming up this week
[32:19] that's why I thought I'd bring just a
[32:21] little
[32:21] simple joyful sermon tonight to help
[32:24] everybody
[32:27] well y'all doing laughing like that
[32:30] come on people my goodness
[32:33] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11.
[32:36] we're coming with great anticipation see
[32:38] what the Lord's going to do for us and
[32:40] speak to us and change lives and
[32:44] heal the sick not only in their bodies
[32:46] but in their spirits and their souls
[32:48] wherever they need healing
[32:50] we serve a mighty God don't we
[32:54] let's consult tonight again with the
[32:56] master builder
[32:59] for other Foundation can no man lay then
[33:02] that is laid which is Jesus Christ
[33:06] now if any man build upon this
[33:07] Foundation
[33:09] what Foundation Jesus Christ
[33:13] gold silver
[33:15] precious stones wood
[33:18] hey
[33:20] stubble
[33:22] how shameful
[33:25] that anybody would want to lay stubble
[33:28] on Jesus
[33:30] hey
[33:32] on Jesus
[33:35] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[33:39] for the day shall declare it
[33:43] because it shall be revealed by fire
[33:47] and the fire shall try
[33:49] Every Man's work of what sort it is
[33:54] if any man's work abide which he hath
[33:57] built thereupon
[33:59] he shall receive
[34:01] a reward
[34:03] if any man's work shall be burned
[34:07] he shall suffer loss
[34:09] that he himself shall be saved
[34:13] yet so
[34:15] as by far
[34:18] saved
[34:19] but without a reward
[34:23] saved
[34:25] but without a reward
[34:28] I don't want to stand that way do you
[34:30] know no I I don't want to do things for
[34:34] the sake of reward
[34:35] but I want to do what I can do to be
[34:38] able to bring it and lay it at his feet
[34:41] it's not that you and I are worthy of
[34:43] any reward anyway because when it's all
[34:46] said and done says the parable that
[34:47] Jesus said we would say that we were
[34:49] unworthy servants but we do it because
[34:52] he is worthy
[34:55] I made like to be remembered tonight as
[34:56] we pray as we look into the word God
[34:58] bless you me too let's just pray
[35:00] together
[35:03] Heavenly Father we realize as we stand
[35:07] here
[35:09] in your presence before these people
[35:13] each of us one day are going to be
[35:15] called before that great high place
[35:20] as Christians we will not go through the
[35:23] white throne
[35:25] but as bride we will come up and give an
[35:28] account and we will answer according
[35:31] to the book
[35:33] the book of remembrance
[35:35] so father I pray that you would help
[35:37] each of us
[35:39] that whenever we stand there
[35:41] will be so many things that you have
[35:45] helped us to accomplish for your kingdom
[35:48] not for us not for a name we don't do it
[35:52] for reward we don't do it for back
[35:55] payment Lord we do it because we love
[35:58] you
[35:59] help us father that we can open our
[36:02] hearts tonight to your word
[36:04] and Lord you see we're under great
[36:05] anticipation of
[36:07] the meetings coming up this week and
[36:09] we're just praying for brother Tim on
[36:11] Friday brother Ron on Saturday by the
[36:13] David on Sunday or those that will be
[36:16] traveling in from all over just pray
[36:18] that you'll watch over them and give us
[36:20] a great time together Lord as we come to
[36:23] Fellowship around your word we ask it
[36:26] tonight father in the name of Jesus
[36:29] amen God bless you you may be seated
[36:39] what a great thing Godly works are
[36:44] what a great thing to be attributed
[36:46] to a changed life
[36:49] we know that works are so important both
[36:54] in the direction of light
[36:56] and the direction of Darkness
[36:59] Jesus gives us the astounding parable
[37:02] and tells us that the Kingdom of Heaven
[37:04] shall be likened to a man when he's
[37:07] going to divide the sheep from the goats
[37:09] and they will stand there as she not
[37:12] actually sheep but as sheep
[37:15] and he puts forth this profound parallel
[37:19] when he'll say you didn't take care of
[37:23] me when I was hungry
[37:25] I was in the hospitals we'd say I was
[37:27] sick I was home I was weary
[37:31] you never even come and saw me
[37:33] I was hungry you never fed me
[37:36] I was naked and you never give me any
[37:38] clothes and they'll say Lord
[37:41] when did we ever see you like that well
[37:44] I never lived in your day
[37:46] I lived in 2020 I lived in 1900 I lived
[37:51] in 1800 I I never saw you
[37:54] he said when you didn't do this to the
[37:57] least of these my brothers
[38:00] you didn't do it to me
[38:02] and then those that are as sheep or not
[38:06] sheep because sheep don't stand there he
[38:08] will turn right around and say
[38:10] enter into the joys of the Lord
[38:13] because I was hungry and you fed me they
[38:16] said what well we never saw you
[38:19] I was naked and you closed me I was this
[38:23] and you did that I was this and you did
[38:25] that Lord when did we see you like that
[38:27] I never lived in your day
[38:30] when you did it to the least of these my
[38:33] brothers now what you notice that Jesus
[38:36] separates these people from Brothers
[38:40] these people who had done this were not
[38:43] actually brothers
[38:45] but he said they treated his brothers
[38:47] that way
[38:49] now look at what a great thing it is in
[38:52] the eyes of God in the way that we treat
[38:56] his brothers so there will be people
[38:59] that will actually be turned into hell
[39:05] if you notice Jesus doesn't say you
[39:07] laughed at my name
[39:09] you laughed whenever you heard that I
[39:11] healed the sick
[39:12] you ridicule whenever you heard somebody
[39:15] speaking in tongues
[39:17] but Jesus said because of the way you
[39:19] treated my brothers
[39:21] you are lost
[39:25] and then to the other group
[39:27] he'll say well you believe John 3 16 and
[39:31] you you believed in shouting and you
[39:33] believed in jumping and you believed in
[39:35] signs and wonders no
[39:37] simply because of the way they treated
[39:41] his brothers
[39:43] so myself as I look at that I realize
[39:46] that it's not just important how them
[39:49] people treat his brothers but also how
[39:53] important it is for his brothers to
[39:56] treat his brothers
[39:59] amen his sisters to treat his sisters so
[40:04] God always has been identified
[40:08] in the reality of lives being changed
[40:12] and we can see that even in the Old
[40:14] Testament before the New Birth Jacob
[40:17] Moses so many and their lives were
[40:21] touched by the power of God and were
[40:23] changed and the New Testament certainly
[40:25] does not end that effect of good works
[40:29] but it ties from the old to the new so
[40:33] every one of us now not just the older
[40:35] people like me and your moms and your
[40:38] dads but you young people when you stand
[40:41] before the Lord you will walk before him
[40:44] and there will be the book open and
[40:47] there will be another book open which is
[40:49] The Book of Life now every one of us
[40:52] have books that are going to be
[40:55] identified with who we are now if our
[40:58] name is in that that special section of
[41:01] the Lamb's Book of Life our name can
[41:04] never be removed under any circumstances
[41:06] at all but then there there's another
[41:09] book which is the record of our Deeds
[41:13] now in that is what we're talking about
[41:16] tonight turn with me if you would to
[41:18] Matthew or Malachi rather chapter 3
[41:21] verse 16. Malachi 3 16. then they that
[41:26] feared the Lord spake often one to
[41:29] another and the Lord hearkened and heard
[41:33] it
[41:34] and a book of remembrance was written
[41:39] before him
[41:41] for them now listen why this book is
[41:45] written and a book of remembrance was
[41:49] written before him for them
[41:55] now it's written before him but it's
[41:58] written on your behalf
[42:02] that feared the Lord
[42:05] and that thought upon his name so now
[42:08] this is how important that it is to God
[42:11] that we just remember his name
[42:15] so when we're going through things of
[42:17] Life hardships difficulties trials
[42:19] whatever it is and we just remember that
[42:22] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[42:24] and we just think about him in the time
[42:29] of distress that is actually written in
[42:33] the book of remembrance under your name
[42:36] now that's just when you think about it
[42:39] and whenever you remember him and
[42:41] remember how good he is and how
[42:43] wonderful he is much less whenever you
[42:46] act upon it and say he is mindful he
[42:49] will help me in the midst of trouble he
[42:52] will do this and that and the other you
[42:54] imagine all of that is written how many
[42:57] things was written about us today this
[43:00] very day in the book of remembrance when
[43:04] Satan tempted you when Satan come at you
[43:07] and Satan tried to make you doubt God
[43:09] won't move for you but the first thing
[43:11] you've done in your mind you remember
[43:14] but wait a minute the Lord has always
[43:16] been mindful of me he's been merciful so
[43:20] merciful to me all the days of my life
[43:24] now not only to do something inside of
[43:27] your soul but there was writing taking
[43:29] place in heaven because you sought upon
[43:32] the goodness of God and you remembered
[43:36] his name and remembered his power is it
[43:39] any wonder that Satan does not want us
[43:42] to think that way then that he wants to
[43:45] get us so called up in the things of
[43:48] life and trouble and heartaches and
[43:50] sadness and the Darkness of the world
[43:53] why sure I don't blame him but if I was
[43:55] the devil I'd be doing you all the exact
[43:57] same way so I say we need to do it more
[44:00] than we've ever done
[44:02] you believe that now notice then so a
[44:05] book of remembrance was written before
[44:07] him for them that feared the Lord and
[44:12] that thought upon his name now notice
[44:14] what they do they remember the Lord and
[44:17] they think about him and they feared the
[44:19] Lord and they fought upon his name now
[44:22] look at verse 17 the promise that God
[44:25] makes to those people and they shall be
[44:29] mine
[44:31] saith the Lord of hosts
[44:33] in that day when I make up my jewels
[44:39] now listen while God identifies this
[44:43] class of people that are living on the
[44:46] earth they are God's special treasures
[44:50] and God identifies them as precious
[44:55] objects of his love and his mercy and
[44:59] his great devotion towards Humanity that
[45:03] God looks at these people now think how
[45:05] outstanding it is to God whenever we
[45:08] think about him this is what God Said
[45:10] now not just the length of your hair
[45:12] sisters the length of your dress and
[45:14] your brothers don't wear dresses and you
[45:16] don't paint up your face and you're not
[45:18] that weird classic out here but whenever
[45:21] you do simple things like thinking on
[45:24] the Lord that puts you in a treasure
[45:27] class of people
[45:30] notice what God said they shall be mine
[45:33] saith the Lord of hosts notice the way
[45:37] Malachi writes this and he puts the word
[45:39] host in the plurality form so it's host
[45:44] as in plural remember Jacob had an
[45:48] experience with the Lord of hosts
[45:50] himself one time and he called it by a
[45:54] special name mayonnaise him
[45:57] mayonnaise him the camp the two camps
[46:01] and Jacob had a revelation from God that
[46:05] God had come down with an Angelic host
[46:07] and he had come with another host and it
[46:11] was the meeting place of the two camps
[46:14] and he calls it may a nahim the
[46:17] Gathering of the two camps so hear God
[46:21] being identified as the Lord of hosts
[46:25] he's not just the lord of the Angelic
[46:28] host but he's the lord of the Earthly
[46:31] host who sank upon his name who bless
[46:34] his name who worship Him who live for
[46:38] him
[46:39] now notice what God Said in that day
[46:42] when I make up my jewels and I will
[46:46] spare them as a man spareth his own son
[46:51] that service him what a blessing it is
[46:56] it to us as the people of God that God
[46:59] would look at us now these are works
[47:02] that we're not doing for brothers and
[47:05] sisters but we're doing this directly to
[47:09] God so when you're in trouble and you
[47:11] think about him and that very thought so
[47:15] simple to us well who would think that
[47:18] God in his great infinite wisdom and all
[47:21] the things that God has got going on but
[47:24] when you're under an onslaught of hell
[47:26] and whenever you simply allow your mind
[47:30] to think about the goodness of God Lord
[47:33] God you've been so good to me you have
[47:36] been so wonderful to me and Lord I
[47:38] cannot think of one one time of the
[47:40] Decades of my life that I have served
[47:43] you that you've not always been there
[47:45] every time and you're just thinking
[47:47] about it and encourages you and helps
[47:49] you little did you know the Lord God had
[47:53] them Angelic scribes to write it down in
[47:56] a book now you didn't do it to your
[47:58] brother you did not buy the Widow some
[48:00] cold for the winter winter time you did
[48:03] not buy somebody some groceries or
[48:05] somebody's supper but you were simply
[48:07] thinking about the Lord God and his name
[48:10] and his mercy and it meant so much to
[48:14] him that he said write that down I'm
[48:17] going to add that to Donny's book I'm
[48:20] going to add that to Carol's book and
[48:23] when she stands before me that day there
[48:26] will be page atrophage not of just where
[48:30] she's prayed for people not of just
[48:32] where this man has helped maybe pay
[48:34] somebody's car payment but there will be
[48:36] page at your page of adoration and
[48:40] praise and adornment and thoughts and
[48:44] love and all that that he done for me
[48:47] that she done for me that she thought
[48:49] nobody even knew do you believe friends
[48:52] that every thought that you have toward
[48:55] the goodness of God it means so much to
[48:58] him he will reward you that day when he
[49:01] gathers his jewels I'll tell you one
[49:03] thing it ought to make us want to love
[49:04] him more than we've ever loved him in
[49:06] our life it ought to make us want to
[49:09] give him more than we have ever given
[49:12] him how many agrees with that now think
[49:15] that that means so much to almighty God
[49:18] that he would have a book of remembrance
[49:20] so here in this section is what we do
[49:23] for one another now we know because
[49:25] we're baptized into the mystical Body of
[49:28] Christ that we are members one of the
[49:30] other and even though there will be
[49:33] people among us that will never prophesy
[49:35] some that will never preach some that
[49:37] will never speak in tongues maybe never
[49:39] have dreams or visions or any of that
[49:41] but that does not mean to the Lord Jesus
[49:44] they don't have as much value and he
[49:47] loves them just as much if they never do
[49:49] any of that as he does the greatest
[49:52] Prophet that ever lived on the earth God
[49:54] has the ability to look at his children
[49:57] and they stand before the foot of the
[49:59] cross every one of them on equal basis
[50:02] aren't you glad I'm so glad that he
[50:04] don't love me less because I'm not the
[50:07] great preacher that you're going to hear
[50:09] this weekend now you're fixing to hear
[50:11] some great preachers and we're going to
[50:12] hear some great men of God and we've
[50:14] heard some great men of God and you know
[50:16] I realize I'll never be that kind of man
[50:19] I'm not that type of a caliber of a man
[50:22] but the Lord help me realize years and
[50:25] years ago that he will never hold me
[50:28] accountable for another man's Ministry
[50:31] and he'll never require of me what he
[50:34] gives to this man to that man to another
[50:36] man all he will require of me is what is
[50:39] given to me and I've accepted that a
[50:42] long time ago so I want to be the very
[50:44] best that I can be for what God's given
[50:47] me and he will require no more of me
[50:50] than that I don't want to be anybody
[50:52] else now come on shall I say Amen well
[50:54] you say well I can't hardly do this and
[50:56] I can't do that be the best that God's
[50:59] given you and that's all that God will
[51:01] ever require of you
[51:04] but keep in mind now that when we look
[51:06] at doing something for the Lord and what
[51:09] we're doing in the way of works that God
[51:12] equips each of us and gives us a certain
[51:15] ability to do certain things and God
[51:18] also sets a boundary now the problem is
[51:20] with adoption as it was in the Old
[51:23] Testament so is it in the new that if
[51:26] Ephraim planted corn everybody wanted to
[51:29] plant corn if Judah planted barley
[51:32] everybody wanted to plant barley because
[51:34] there's something about it that it's so
[51:37] much easier for us to look at somebody
[51:39] else's work and think oh they're doing a
[51:41] good way I wish I could do that I wish I
[51:44] could be like that I hear some preachers
[51:46] preaching I think Lord have mercy and
[51:48] what in the world did God pick up his
[51:50] redneck hillbilly out of Kentucky and
[51:53] call him to preach well I couldn't even
[51:55] carry them guys briefcase and here are
[51:58] some of them the way they put this and
[51:59] that and the other together you think
[52:01] Lord what in the world do you even want
[52:03] me for Lord but apparently he wanted me
[52:06] for something because he called me and
[52:08] he gave me the ability to do something
[52:10] so I've learned that Paul said they that
[52:13] compare themselves among themselves are
[52:16] not wise so God calls every one of us
[52:20] and we Minister according to the ability
[52:22] that God gives us and the church says
[52:25] notice now in Acts chapter 9 verse 3 a
[52:29] Saul of Tarsus now is meeting the Lord
[52:32] Jesus and as he journeyed he came near
[52:34] Damascus and suddenly they'll shine
[52:36] right about him alike from heaven and he
[52:39] fell to the Earth and Heard a Voice sing
[52:40] unto him Saul Saul white persecute us
[52:43] thou me and he said who art thou Lord
[52:47] and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou
[52:52] persecutes now I've been listening to a
[52:54] tape called in his presence in 1962.
[52:57] Kevin heard him all y'all to listen to
[52:59] it's a really good sermon but I've been
[53:01] hearing brother Branham say that Paul
[53:04] did did not believe that God was a man
[53:08] so he could not understand this about
[53:11] Jesus and he couldn't understand about
[53:14] the body because he did not believe that
[53:17] God was a man so he's asking him now
[53:21] this question because he believed God
[53:25] was a light or a pillar of fire and he
[53:29] was right to a degree but he had missed
[53:33] the dispensational change to where that
[53:35] God had condescended from being a light
[53:38] to becoming a man so your Paul simply
[53:42] asked the question of the Lord who are
[53:44] you now watch he must have been
[53:46] overwhelmed when he hears this response
[53:48] I am not the Lord God
[53:52] now notice he does not say I am I don't
[53:57] know he does not say I am that I am now
[54:01] if he would have said that he took him
[54:03] straight back to Moses he'd been looking
[54:05] for a bush to be on fire and he would
[54:07] have thought the fire in the bush was
[54:09] the Lord God but notice how he answers
[54:12] him I am
[54:15] Jesus
[54:17] I am a glorified man
[54:21] now you see what he's fixing to do is
[54:24] open Saul's understanding to a new
[54:27] dispensation now it's going to also
[54:30] merge that into the pause two
[54:32] dispensations behind actually and now
[54:35] he's going to help him to see that God
[54:37] had become a man and now that man have
[54:40] become a church
[54:42] Glory well you see he was way back under
[54:46] thinking that God was still alive and
[54:49] God was a fire but he introduces himself
[54:52] as I am Jesus well now for Paul being a
[54:57] Jew this Jesus of course the way they
[54:59] looked at him naturally was a Jew but he
[55:01] was a blasphemer he was a man so for him
[55:05] to ask the question who are you Lord who
[55:09] are you I don't know I am Jesus now
[55:13] notice I am Jesus whom thou persecutes
[55:19] but yet Paul had never even seen the man
[55:22] Jesus will have no record that he ever
[55:24] saw him so how was Paul persecuting
[55:28] Jesus in the form of his church
[55:32] now think about it the Lord Jesus
[55:35] identified his body as himself so I
[55:39] wonder if the Lord Jesus doesn't do the
[55:42] same thing today that he identifies his
[55:45] body as himself so how does it make him
[55:48] feel if we as members of the body treat
[55:52] other members of the body in a way that
[55:55] does not please the Lord or how does it
[55:58] make the Lord Jesus feel whenever the
[56:00] land of sins will life at the members of
[56:04] his body and whoever it is government
[56:06] officials or whoever more and they will
[56:09] treat the members of his body in a bad
[56:13] way now if they would ask the Lord Jesus
[56:15] currently who are you Lord he'd say I'm
[56:19] in my bride and when you persecute her
[56:22] you persecute me so what an eye-opener
[56:26] that this was so Paul catches it in a
[56:30] twofold way that I am Jesus I I am a man
[56:34] which has now become glorified and I am
[56:37] feeling the hurt of my wife as you are
[56:42] persecuting her I don't mind telling you
[56:44] friend if the people of the world know
[56:47] who they were rubbing shoulders with I
[56:49] think they'd treat us all a lot better I
[56:52] think that if we realize who we're going
[56:55] to church with we would treat one
[56:57] another a lot better too
[56:59] well praise the Lord now notice he said
[57:02] it is hard for thee to kick against the
[57:06] Pricks now Paul must have received oh
[57:09] Lord I cannot imagine how this man must
[57:12] have felt when the realization finally
[57:14] hit his soul that whenever he was
[57:17] persecuting this body this must have
[57:19] been overwhelming nothing in the Old
[57:21] Testament had ever even been similar to
[57:23] that at all I'm when he was persecuting
[57:25] the church he was persecuting the Lord
[57:28] Jesus so not as few has totally changed
[57:31] about the mystical Body of Christ so
[57:34] Paul from this point on begins to look
[57:37] at the body of Christ in a total
[57:39] different way than anything he'd ever
[57:41] seen before so it's no wonder that God
[57:43] allowed this man and gave him such
[57:46] inspiration to write about the body as a
[57:49] matter of fact he preaches more about
[57:50] the body of Christ than into the rest of
[57:52] the writers in the New Testament watch
[57:55] him in First Corinthians chapter 16
[57:57] verse 15. I beseech you bro Brethren you
[58:01] know the house of stephanus that it is
[58:04] the first fruits of akaya and that they
[58:08] have listened this word they hired
[58:11] addicted
[58:13] themselves
[58:15] to the ministry
[58:17] of the Saints
[58:19] now I do really believe
[58:22] in addiction
[58:24] it's not the marijuana it ain't to
[58:26] nicotine it ain't to your cell phone but
[58:29] I do believe there is a scriptural
[58:32] addiction
[58:34] now these people notice how Paul frames
[58:37] this that it is the first fruits of
[58:40] ikaya and this was of the House of her
[58:43] brother by the name of stephanus now we
[58:44] don't know too much about this man what
[58:46] they've done but Paul just summed it all
[58:49] together and these beautiful words and
[58:52] said they have addicted themselves to
[58:56] them to the ministry of the Saints I
[58:59] want you to notice how Paul coins these
[59:02] terms now your Paul was a lot like the
[59:05] church AIDS messenger and our day when
[59:08] you go to Rudy studying the Greek words
[59:10] that Paul used there was no secular use
[59:13] of some of these words as a matter of
[59:15] fact Scholars still rub their head and
[59:18] say where to even get some of these
[59:20] words out and they say that Paul
[59:22] actually coined is the term they used
[59:25] that Paul actually coined some of these
[59:29] words because it had been never been
[59:31] used before well I can see that and
[59:33] understand it clearly that never have
[59:35] been a group of people on the Earth like
[59:36] them so God had to give him words like
[59:38] they'd never done before you know
[59:40] brother randomly used the words before
[59:42] that Mr Webster probably strike his head
[59:44] and just scratched his head and say
[59:45] where in the world to get that from well
[59:47] you know Paul then he used this word
[59:50] which is not used anywhere else in the
[59:52] Bible and he identified this particular
[59:55] group this house which was a family and
[59:58] that they had addicted themselves now we
[1:00:02] all know enough about addiction we're
[1:00:04] living in a great age of addiction when
[1:00:07] people get addicted to a substance when
[1:00:10] they get addicted to whatever it is they
[1:00:12] absolutely have to have it now they've
[1:00:15] got to have it uh you know it may start
[1:00:18] out in the morning and they don't drink
[1:00:19] it they have to have they have to have
[1:00:22] their coffee or they get a headache at
[1:00:24] 11 o'clock if they don't get it
[1:00:27] well glory to God oh but we know that it
[1:00:31] can go into the form of drugs and go
[1:00:34] into the form of this and that but this
[1:00:36] is the first time that the word was
[1:00:39] actually used in the Bible and the only
[1:00:41] time so these Saints had become so
[1:00:44] addictive but I want you to notice how
[1:00:47] Paul says when what they were addicted
[1:00:49] to he said that they have addicted
[1:00:52] themselves so it wasn't like that they
[1:00:55] got around the Saints or they got around
[1:00:58] the ministry because the ministry was
[1:01:00] actually what they addicted themselves
[1:01:02] to it was the ministry to the Saints the
[1:01:06] ministry to the Saints so these folks
[1:01:09] had got such an understanding that the
[1:01:13] ministry was so absolutely essential
[1:01:16] that without the ministry the Saints
[1:01:19] could not flourish without the ministry
[1:01:22] the Saints could not grow without the
[1:01:25] ministry the Saints would never grow
[1:01:27] spiritually the churches would never
[1:01:30] become more and more and more well
[1:01:32] Hallelujah you see they wouldn't like a
[1:01:35] lot of message folks who didn't think
[1:01:36] when it didn't need preachers no more
[1:01:39] but these folks felt like it was so
[1:01:42] necessary that the ministry but I want
[1:01:44] you to notice how that Paul terms says
[1:01:46] that he identifies it the ministry to
[1:01:49] the Saints so it was not the other way
[1:01:52] around that the saints were actually the
[1:01:55] servants to the ministry but the
[1:01:57] ministry was the servants to the Saints
[1:01:59] so these people called an understanding
[1:02:03] of how essential that the ministry was
[1:02:05] and they addicted themselves to helping
[1:02:09] the ministry in every way they could so
[1:02:12] can you imagine what a great thing it
[1:02:15] must have been so instead of going
[1:02:17] around and trying to add burdens and
[1:02:19] load and difficulty and so on to the
[1:02:22] ministry that they've done everything
[1:02:24] they could to try to lighten the Lord
[1:02:27] they would pray for them they would call
[1:02:29] their name before the Lord they would do
[1:02:31] everything they could in so much that
[1:02:34] they become addicted and they said I've
[1:02:36] got to do something for a preacher I
[1:02:37] just got to do it I I've got to do it
[1:02:39] but I've just got to have that fix Lord
[1:02:41] help me I've got to have it oh my
[1:02:43] goodness I wonder what kind of message
[1:02:44] will it really have if we had about a
[1:02:46] half a dozen that was addicted to this
[1:02:48] if some of y'all was addicted to this as
[1:02:51] you are to Facebook my goodness what a
[1:02:53] church would have if you're as addicted
[1:02:55] to this I watch some of y'all sometime I
[1:02:58] watch them dings and buzzes and this and
[1:03:00] that and the other on your phone and as
[1:03:02] soon as it goes off yo I don't care
[1:03:04] you're standing there talking to whoever
[1:03:05] and you'll grab that phone you're so
[1:03:07] addicted to that thing you can't let it
[1:03:10] Buzz one time without it getting your
[1:03:11] attention I reckon you figure you're
[1:03:13] that important huh are you that
[1:03:15] important that Biden contacts you every
[1:03:17] day asks you for counsel and advice come
[1:03:19] on get real get next to yourself you
[1:03:21] ain't nothing but a six foot pile of
[1:03:23] dirt like all the rest of us you ain't
[1:03:25] that valuable you ain't got that much
[1:03:27] worse the only worse than any of us is
[1:03:30] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] oh my so these Saints had addicted
[1:03:37] themselves notice he said addicted
[1:03:40] themselves to the ministry of the Saints
[1:03:44] so they had such a burden such a desire
[1:03:48] in their hearts and they had devoted
[1:03:50] themselves to the ministry notice he
[1:03:53] does not put it in a singular form well
[1:03:56] it's just my pastor my pastor my pastor
[1:03:58] my pastor my pastor all my pastor you're
[1:04:00] a worshiper of a man if that's all you
[1:04:02] think about but they didn't look at it
[1:04:04] as just in one particular man but they
[1:04:07] looked at the ministry so it would have
[1:04:09] been pastored it would have been
[1:04:11] evangelist it would have been teachers
[1:04:13] and they wanted to do everything they
[1:04:15] could do they wanted to pray they wanted
[1:04:17] to be able to help them maybe if they
[1:04:19] could financially who knows what they
[1:04:21] could do but they addicted themselves to
[1:04:24] serving the ministry because they really
[1:04:26] had an understanding that if the
[1:04:29] ministry is where they need to be and
[1:04:31] their help the Saints will grow that
[1:04:33] saints were abound in the goodness of
[1:04:36] God it ain't no wonder the devil hates
[1:04:38] the ministry and that they were living
[1:04:39] in and attacks it like never before
[1:04:43] well praise the Lord so they showed them
[1:04:46] Hospitality or provided for their needs
[1:04:49] or they pray we really don't know what
[1:04:51] all that they don't but they attended to
[1:04:54] everything they could do and so much
[1:04:57] that they were addicts well praise God
[1:05:00] one some of the very few addicts that'll
[1:05:03] ever walked down streets of gold and
[1:05:05] they continue in their addiction no
[1:05:07] doubt until they passed on this life
[1:05:09] into the other and that addiction drove
[1:05:12] them to page after page after page of
[1:05:15] good works and one day them idex are
[1:05:18] going to stand before God and the Lord
[1:05:20] Jesus will open them books and said all
[1:05:23] my brothers
[1:05:24] all my brothers and my sisters look at
[1:05:28] what you've done you helped Paul you
[1:05:31] helped the epaphras you helped to mosius
[1:05:34] you helped this one you've done that and
[1:05:37] by what you did you strengthened their
[1:05:39] hands remember Moses that mighty man of
[1:05:42] God when he he stood up there and as
[1:05:45] long as his hands were raised up holding
[1:05:47] the rod of God the children of Israel
[1:05:49] defeated their enemy the actual law
[1:05:52] Moses hands got so tired you can imagine
[1:05:55] gravitation pulling you down the blood
[1:05:57] trying to pump up in your arms it would
[1:06:00] be the natural feeling for any of us
[1:06:02] after so long for your hands and your
[1:06:04] arms to get tired and they would go numb
[1:06:07] basically so what did Moses have to have
[1:06:09] he had to have some guys to come over
[1:06:12] and they stood under his hands under his
[1:06:14] arms maybe one under this arm and one
[1:06:17] under that arm and they said right there
[1:06:18] they're a man of God keep your hands up
[1:06:21] high keep praying keep reading keep
[1:06:23] studying let me do what I can do to
[1:06:26] lighten your love let me do what I can
[1:06:29] do to keep your hands up Moses because a
[1:06:32] man Moses hands come down they begin to
[1:06:35] lose the battle let me tell you it's the
[1:06:37] same way in the last day if the ministry
[1:06:40] gets sidetracked on this and sidetracked
[1:06:42] on that our churches will lose the
[1:06:45] battle that's why we need people of God
[1:06:47] that will pray for the god-called
[1:06:50] ministry and do everything they care to
[1:06:53] hold up their hands and pray and say God
[1:06:55] help my brothers God's strengthen my
[1:06:58] brother as you're holding up their hands
[1:07:00] you are helping yourself because as you
[1:07:04] minister to the ministry the ministry
[1:07:07] turns right back and ministers to the
[1:07:09] saints of God
[1:07:13] thank you
[1:07:17] let me show you a kaleidoscope
[1:07:20] of an assortment of things
[1:07:23] that people did in the Bible
[1:07:25] let's look at another man by the name of
[1:07:27] epaphras
[1:07:28] this brethren in Colossians chapter 4
[1:07:31] verse 12 apatris
[1:07:34] Apophis was a minister and the church at
[1:07:39] colossae now notice what Paul identifies
[1:07:43] about this man Apophis which is one of
[1:07:46] you a servant of Christ salute us you
[1:07:51] always laboring
[1:07:54] fervently
[1:07:56] for you
[1:08:01] in what
[1:08:08] laboring look at the meaning of this
[1:08:10] word
[1:08:11] strive
[1:08:13] fight
[1:08:14] to enter into a contest
[1:08:17] contend in the gymnastic games
[1:08:22] to contend
[1:08:25] with adversaries
[1:08:29] every time I read this verse
[1:08:31] I think about brother Daryl Ward
[1:08:36] he's one of the prayers man I know
[1:08:40] and it ain't a show
[1:08:42] it's from his heart
[1:08:44] I spent a lot of time with him and hear
[1:08:45] him pray he don't pray that way just in
[1:08:48] front of a microphone
[1:08:49] but he prays that way when you're out
[1:08:51] hunting whenever you stop to get food
[1:08:53] whatever because that's the kind of man
[1:08:56] he is
[1:08:57] I wonder how many Saints know how to
[1:09:00] labor
[1:09:01] in prayer
[1:09:03] isn't it amazing that this guy was a
[1:09:05] preacher
[1:09:06] but Paul does not tell us what a great
[1:09:10] Theologian he was
[1:09:12] he doesn't even tell us if the man must
[1:09:14] straighten his Doctrine no doubt he must
[1:09:16] have been but we don't know anything
[1:09:18] about his great depths of the word
[1:09:21] we don't know anything about how many
[1:09:23] people he wondered the Lord Jesus we
[1:09:26] don't know anything about how many Souls
[1:09:28] that he won but one of the things that
[1:09:30] was so outstanding to Paul about this
[1:09:33] brother was that he labored fervently
[1:09:38] for you
[1:09:40] in prayers
[1:09:43] now this is what he prayed for
[1:09:46] that ye may stand perfect
[1:09:50] and complete
[1:09:52] in all the will of God
[1:09:55] you mean the brother was not praying for
[1:09:57] new Cadillacs and new Ford pickup trucks
[1:10:00] and new Jaguars and you know bigger
[1:10:03] houses and my I knew this and I knew
[1:10:05] that no but the brother had such an
[1:10:08] understanding that the afterlife was
[1:10:11] what burdened him
[1:10:13] for the saints of God and he would get
[1:10:15] down to pray and it was like he would
[1:10:18] enter into a gymnastic game
[1:10:21] you can imagine like your brothers get
[1:10:23] over and run up and down that ball court
[1:10:25] back and forth and back and forth and
[1:10:28] your sweating like a bunch of hogs when
[1:10:30] you get up
[1:10:33] and what's accomplished some of you old
[1:10:36] men hurt your knee some of you fall and
[1:10:39] hurt your foot I just hope it got enough
[1:10:41] insurance to cover all this stuff
[1:10:44] but I wonder I'm not against that now
[1:10:47] but I wonder if we wouldn't be a better
[1:10:49] Church
[1:10:51] if some of us didn't pray till they
[1:10:53] broke through on a sweat
[1:10:55] and we entered into another game
[1:11:00] a game against Satan and all of his
[1:11:04] demons
[1:11:05] Satan you're not going to stop my
[1:11:07] brothers you're not going to stop my
[1:11:10] sisters they are going to come to a
[1:11:12] place of perfection in Christ Jesus
[1:11:20] notice this is not the norm of praying
[1:11:25] this is not the now I'll lay me down to
[1:11:28] sleep
[1:11:29] some of y'all make it past the word
[1:11:31] sleep
[1:11:35] this was laboring
[1:11:38] bravery
[1:11:41] praise God
[1:11:43] and some of you all have been wondering
[1:11:45] what you could do I know somebody said
[1:11:47] brother Donnie when are you going to
[1:11:48] tell us here you go
[1:11:50] I'm telling you
[1:11:54] always laboring fervently with a fevered
[1:11:58] pitch
[1:11:59] with a fevered pitch
[1:12:02] for you and prayers that ye may stand
[1:12:05] perfect now look at this you know the
[1:12:08] the words and the way that they go from
[1:12:09] the English of course to the Greek and
[1:12:11] the Aramaic can be very confusing
[1:12:13] sometimes but I want you to notice as
[1:12:15] Paul uses this word laboring and then he
[1:12:18] goes from that into perfect and this
[1:12:20] word that Paul chose to use for laboring
[1:12:23] is the very same word
[1:12:27] that Matthew used about the Lord Jesus
[1:12:30] and the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:12:34] when he prayed until he swept
[1:12:37] came as great drops of blood
[1:12:42] you see this is why we still have
[1:12:44] grudges in our heart against one another
[1:12:47] if you listen to it in 1958 in
[1:12:49] Chattanooga you'll hear the prophet of
[1:12:52] God say I don't think anyone
[1:12:55] if you'll go Before the Throne of God
[1:12:57] and pray through
[1:12:58] I don't think you can ever stand Before
[1:13:01] the Throne of God and come back with a
[1:13:03] hard feeling in your heart against
[1:13:05] anybody
[1:13:06] because you know what you do you get
[1:13:08] Before the Throne of God and you realize
[1:13:10] how much help you need yourself but the
[1:13:12] problem of it is we don't go deep enough
[1:13:14] and we go to God with faults and hard
[1:13:17] feelings and all that sort of thing and
[1:13:19] we come right back down with the same
[1:13:21] hard feelings you need to pray more and
[1:13:23] you need to pray longer get this old
[1:13:25] thing of this hold in your house Thou
[1:13:27] shalt Thou shalt labor
[1:13:30] labor fervently till you get past you
[1:13:33] feel it so you get past well he done
[1:13:35] this she done that so you get to a place
[1:13:38] where you say Lord God have mercy on me
[1:13:41] and help me that I can forgive my
[1:13:43] brother help me that I can forgive my
[1:13:46] sister come on church until we can get
[1:13:49] to a place that we can walk over and hug
[1:13:52] a man's neck who would kill us
[1:13:57] until we can do that we're not ready for
[1:14:00] the Rapture I don't know how much we can
[1:14:01] talk about the Seven Seals or the seven
[1:14:03] Thunders until we can forgive all men of
[1:14:06] their trespasses we're not ready to fly
[1:14:10] [Applause]
[1:14:14] who Jesus
[1:14:18] my mom
[1:14:21] that ye may stand
[1:14:24] perfect look at this word
[1:14:26] teleos
[1:14:28] this is not sinlessness
[1:14:31] but a full age
[1:14:34] so epaphras
[1:14:36] was praying for every saint
[1:14:39] that God would help him
[1:14:41] to grow up
[1:14:46] and you imagine every time I see you
[1:14:47] brother Keith I'm praying for you
[1:14:48] brother you'll grow up
[1:14:51] I'm praying for you Sister Janet you'll
[1:14:53] grow up
[1:14:54] I'm praying for you brother Donnie your
[1:14:55] girl up now you imagine after a while
[1:14:57] you say look here big boy who do you
[1:14:58] think you're talking to anyway I'm the
[1:15:00] preacher who said I'm still praying for
[1:15:01] you you need to grow up So This Man
[1:15:04] Called an understanding in order to make
[1:15:07] the rap shot it's not going to be how
[1:15:09] much we have up here it's what we take
[1:15:12] from down here and put down here and put
[1:15:14] into action here and here and we live
[1:15:17] this word we don't just talk it we don't
[1:15:20] debate it we don't argue it but we
[1:15:22] become the message of the hour living
[1:15:25] the Lord Jesus to the world and Latin
[1:15:29] the world see those a real living
[1:15:31] resurrected savior
[1:15:37] ah
[1:15:41] wow
[1:15:45] so brother apaphos prayed that all the
[1:15:47] saints would be of full age
[1:15:49] brought to his end finished wanting
[1:15:52] nothing necessary to completeness
[1:15:54] consummate human integrity
[1:15:57] and virtue
[1:16:01] you know Paul never said a papers prayed
[1:16:03] when he felt like it
[1:16:06] well many of us do
[1:16:08] nor did he Pray when he was told to pray
[1:16:12] it was a Ministry
[1:16:14] now he's a preacher
[1:16:16] he's a preacher you imagine now this is
[1:16:18] this is the way this brother's known
[1:16:19] he's only mentioned one more time in the
[1:16:21] whole new testament and again it's not
[1:16:22] about his great ability to speak it's
[1:16:24] not about more he would hold people's
[1:16:26] fail about but there was something about
[1:16:28] this man's Ministry that was so
[1:16:30] overwhelming that Paul felt to pin it
[1:16:33] and write about this man
[1:16:36] thank God for a man like a perfect
[1:16:41] you see he was not praying whatever
[1:16:43] Believers prayed and when they stopped
[1:16:45] he stopped he prayed when they didn't
[1:16:48] he prayed when nobody told him to he
[1:16:51] prayed when he felt like it
[1:16:55] he prayed for what he did
[1:16:58] you see that is a Ministry
[1:17:03] oh people say well I've got a minister
[1:17:04] for this and a minister for that well if
[1:17:06] you do then you'll do it when you're up
[1:17:08] you'll do it when you're down you'll do
[1:17:09] it when you're in you're dope and you're
[1:17:11] out you ain't gonna have to be begged to
[1:17:12] do it pumped to do it primed to do it
[1:17:14] paid to do it you're going to do it if
[1:17:17] it's a god-called Ministry
[1:17:19] well
[1:17:23] notice on verse 13.
[1:17:26] for I bear him record
[1:17:29] that he hath a great zeal for you
[1:17:33] and them that are in laodicea
[1:17:37] and them
[1:17:39] in hieropolis
[1:17:42] so here this man was so effects on and
[1:17:45] he's praying
[1:17:47] I love this that God would burden
[1:17:50] somebody
[1:17:51] to pray and some of you may say well all
[1:17:54] I ever do brother Donnie is pray for you
[1:17:56] all right people ask me all the time

[1:20:10] notice again in Colossians chapter 1
[1:20:12] verse 9. for this cause we also since
[1:20:15] the day we heard it do not cease
[1:20:17] pray for you
[1:20:19] and to desire that you might be filled
[1:20:22] with the knowledge of his will
[1:20:25] and all wisdom and spiritual
[1:20:27] understanding notice the direction that
[1:20:30] these brothers pray now this is tall
[1:20:32] this is not a password now this is Paul
[1:20:33] and this he's telling them what he
[1:20:36] prayed for them
[1:20:39] that you might walk worthy of the Lord
[1:20:44] unto all pleasing
[1:20:46] being fruitful
[1:20:48] and every good work
[1:20:53] and increasing
[1:20:54] in the knowledge of God so strengthened
[1:20:57] with Almighty according
[1:20:59] to his glorious power unto all patients
[1:21:03] and long-suffering with joyfulness
[1:21:07] now look they didn't spend all their
[1:21:08] time bringing their list to God God I
[1:21:11] need this I want that I don't want that
[1:21:13] look at the things they prayed about
[1:21:15] understand him joyfulness patience in
[1:21:19] the middle of Trials
[1:21:21] anybody hearing me tonight
[1:21:24] one of the sisters from our church takes
[1:21:26] care one day this week
[1:21:28] said her little son
[1:21:30] he heard me mention here on Sunday about
[1:21:32] brother Daryl having a prayer list and I
[1:21:34] said probably a good thing for the rest
[1:21:36] of us to have one
[1:21:37] so this little tiny lad sitting right
[1:21:39] here looking at me now
[1:21:41] told his mama to text Carol and ask her
[1:21:44] for a list of people he could pray for
[1:21:49] and I saw how awesome
[1:21:51] how awesome is that look I don't care if
[1:21:54] it's a little boy that gets into some of
[1:21:55] you little stubborn heads won't get it
[1:21:57] praise God that's some of these youngins
[1:21:58] get it Lord
[1:22:05] II Thessalonians 2 16 now Lord Jesus
[1:22:08] Christ himself and God even Our Father
[1:22:10] which hath loved us and have given us
[1:22:12] everlasting consolation and Good Hope
[1:22:15] through Grace Comfort your hearts and
[1:22:18] establish you and every good word and
[1:22:22] work
[1:22:24] now while Hollywood take word and work
[1:22:27] and put them hand in hand
[1:22:30] so establish you and every good work so
[1:22:32] in other words it's not something you do
[1:22:34] on occasion we're supposed to be as
[1:22:37] established in good works as we are in
[1:22:41] good Doctrine
[1:22:43] praise the Lord
[1:22:45] oh thank you Lord
[1:22:47] Hebrews 6 10. for God is Not unrighteous
[1:22:52] to forget your work
[1:22:54] and your labor of love which you have
[1:22:57] showed toward his name
[1:23:00] and that you have ministered to the
[1:23:03] Saints
[1:23:05] you mean to tell me when I help you
[1:23:09] and you help me and we help one another
[1:23:11] we are doing this to the name of God
[1:23:19] how many by Jesus of parachutes if he
[1:23:21] needed them
[1:23:23] suit shirt whatever he needed right
[1:23:26] you have the opportunity
[1:23:31] that man would help Jesus if he needed a
[1:23:33] month's rent
[1:23:36] he didn't have no house
[1:23:37] so he didn't have to pay them taxes like
[1:23:39] that anyway property tax
[1:23:43] he didn't own anything
[1:23:45] he became poor that through his poverty
[1:23:49] we might be made rich
[1:23:51] not so much in houses and lands but rich
[1:23:53] in the good things of God
[1:23:56] notice this he says for God is Not
[1:23:58] unrighteous to forget your work
[1:24:02] and labor of love which you have showed
[1:24:04] toward his name in that ye have
[1:24:06] ministered to the Saints
[1:24:10] and do minister so God is Not unfaithful
[1:24:13] to his promise
[1:24:14] so the fruit of Salvation is seen here
[1:24:17] in ministering to the Believers and
[1:24:20] identified as good works
[1:24:24] now watch then when we go to doing
[1:24:25] things for God doing things for his
[1:24:28] people
[1:24:29] there always comes a warning I know this
[1:24:32] seems strange but it's because we're
[1:24:34] still dealing with this human part of
[1:24:36] ours
[1:24:36] so we go to doing things for people and
[1:24:39] we help the church do this and that and
[1:24:40] the other and then we have to always
[1:24:43] counter balance all of that
[1:24:45] watch how Paul did this in Galatians 6 3
[1:24:48] warning against self-estimation
[1:24:52] for if a man think himself to be
[1:24:55] something
[1:24:56] when he is nothing
[1:24:58] he deceive us himself so you see pride
[1:25:02] always
[1:25:03] overestimates oneself
[1:25:07] Pride calls his people
[1:25:10] to evaluate their own worse
[1:25:14] and I will always over evaluate
[1:25:17] themselves
[1:25:18] so I am worth so much I mean I am so
[1:25:21] needed and I am so important and now
[1:25:24] um I don't have a glass of water but
[1:25:26] I'll use this
[1:25:28] brother Adam said you want to know how
[1:25:30] important you are let me get it down
[1:25:31] where everybody can see it
[1:25:40] show me the hole
[1:25:47] show me the hole I made in the drink
[1:25:52] I heard him say it yesterday he was at a
[1:25:55] museum and they had the value of a human
[1:25:57] body
[1:26:01] so they took the evaluation of it so
[1:26:03] much copper so much you know this and
[1:26:05] that and the other
[1:26:08] and he said the value on that day which
[1:26:09] was 1962. was 84 cents
[1:26:13] so with inflation and everything under
[1:26:15] our current Administration you might be
[1:26:16] worth 249 by now
[1:26:19] since everything's went out
[1:26:22] and said this true boy Senator one of
[1:26:25] his name's Jim one other named John he
[1:26:26] said boy John was sure ain't worth much
[1:26:28] I already said boy we sure ain't he said
[1:26:30] I turn around told them boys but boys
[1:26:31] your soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[1:26:34] so as far as our Humanity it ain't worth
[1:26:37] very much at all
[1:26:38] but yet Satan tries whenever we go to
[1:26:42] doing things for for God and for his
[1:26:44] people then Satan will try to twist it
[1:26:46] around on you now this is one of them
[1:26:48] words that I mentioned to you a while
[1:26:50] ago that Paul himself coined and it's a
[1:26:52] very peculiar word deceiving himself
[1:26:55] it's a very peculiar in the sense that
[1:26:57] you can't find anywhere else in
[1:26:58] classical Greek writing and he himself
[1:27:00] he said Paul puts himself under an
[1:27:03] hallucination
[1:27:05] so the man looks at himself and he
[1:27:08] hallucinates
[1:27:10] so the man walks up on the scales of
[1:27:13] value and he weighs 500 million tons
[1:27:16] that's what he thinks he weighs
[1:27:19] but in reality but six ounces
[1:27:22] but he looks at himself and said Lord
[1:27:25] have mercy I knew I was important but I
[1:27:27] didn't realize that it wasn't the Lord
[1:27:28] but the Lord must have made the whole
[1:27:30] earth for me why I'll tell you one thing
[1:27:31] he must have made every flower to me and
[1:27:33] mine he made every tree with me and
[1:27:35] might I'll tell you one thing he just
[1:27:36] couldn't function without me I don't
[1:27:38] know how in the world the church even
[1:27:39] has service without me we did fine
[1:27:41] before you came we'll do fine if you go
[1:27:43] somewhere else you all did okay before I
[1:27:46] came and if I go somewhere else you'll
[1:27:47] do all right without me I'll tell you
[1:27:49] how important we are as an individual
[1:27:51] not very but as a group we are
[1:27:53] irreplaceable we are irreplaceable oh I
[1:27:57] don't care how much you think you're
[1:27:58] worse tonight friends every one of us
[1:28:00] need the Lord Jesus greater than we've
[1:28:03] ever needed him and not only that we
[1:28:06] need one another no man is an island God
[1:28:09] don't save you to set you off by
[1:28:11] yourself
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:18] it's what I mean I just wanted to bring
[1:28:20] something that kind of ease the pressure
[1:28:21] lead us into the weekend right yeah yeah
[1:28:25] y'all with me it's okay Galatians 6 4
[1:28:28] but let every man
[1:28:31] wow
[1:28:32] prove
[1:28:34] his own work
[1:28:38] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[1:28:41] alone
[1:28:45] my goodness
[1:28:46] and not in another
[1:28:49] let every man prove
[1:28:52] his own work
[1:28:54] young people God don't want you going
[1:28:56] through your teens in your 20s and your
[1:28:58] 30s trying to look for what does God
[1:29:01] want me to do
[1:29:03] well surely let me revealed to you
[1:29:05] father long as you go but don't waste
[1:29:07] these teen years of your life don't
[1:29:10] waste these twenties of your life learn
[1:29:12] to learn to pray learn to Bear one of
[1:29:14] those burdens don't wait till you're
[1:29:16] done wore out and they say Okay God is
[1:29:19] there anything I can do here y'all go
[1:29:20] sit down the recliner while you got your
[1:29:23] strengths why you got your stamina why
[1:29:25] you got your desire to do something well
[1:29:28] I'm brother down why don't you just want
[1:29:30] to stop doing something no
[1:29:34] pray
[1:29:36] pray I love the series on adoption
[1:29:38] listen to this in 1960. brother I'm
[1:29:41] talking about the mothers
[1:29:43] uh the Patriarchs when they were born
[1:29:44] possessed and Born Into the kingdom of
[1:29:46] God then the Holy Ghost set them in now
[1:29:48] once it runs the parallel between the
[1:29:49] Israel the Old Testament and the New
[1:29:51] Testament Saints the Holy Ghost has said
[1:29:53] in the church Apostles prophets to some
[1:29:56] teachers some pastors some evangelists
[1:29:58] then he's given into them with speaking
[1:30:01] in tongues interpretation of tongues
[1:30:03] knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all
[1:30:06] kinds of Miracles
[1:30:09] praise the Lord
[1:30:11] so does it mean because
[1:30:14] every preacher is not called
[1:30:16] to preach conventions
[1:30:20] he's somehow less man
[1:30:24] I feel sorry for some of these brothers
[1:30:26] in the message
[1:30:28] because a lot of them will never preach
[1:30:30] a convention
[1:30:32] a lot of them will never be drawn to
[1:30:34] this place or that place or another
[1:30:35] place and they attend those meetings and
[1:30:38] they sit there knowing that they'll
[1:30:40] never stand behind a Pulpit and preach
[1:30:42] to hundreds of thousands
[1:30:44] they know that they'll never do it
[1:30:46] I wonder sometimes how some of them walk
[1:30:49] away and we rally around the big people
[1:30:52] and make them feel like they are totally
[1:30:54] useless
[1:30:57] but I wonder where our message would be
[1:30:59] if it wasn't for such men
[1:31:02] I wonder where we would be if it wasn't
[1:31:04] for such men but if we're not careful we
[1:31:06] will pick out who we sing are the great
[1:31:08] Heroes and we leave the unsung heroes
[1:31:10] back in a corner somewhere
[1:31:15] so I was reading about this this week
[1:31:16] and I came across an article where there
[1:31:19] was this certain great great man in the
[1:31:21] Evangelical move not in our move but in
[1:31:23] the Evangelical move and he'd written
[1:31:25] this famous book about how to make
[1:31:27] Sunday schools grow and he went through
[1:31:29] all these principles of doing this and
[1:31:32] that and the other on how to make it
[1:31:34] grow and this this certain preacher
[1:31:35] would want to hear this guy and he got
[1:31:37] up there and gave the oration it wasn't
[1:31:39] really a preacher you know then he got
[1:31:40] up there and gave his speech about what
[1:31:42] to do and people coming up to him after
[1:31:44] he had given his speech and him signing
[1:31:46] the book and autographing the book and
[1:31:49] this preacher went over there and talk
[1:31:50] to a friend of his and he said in
[1:31:52] reality you ought to been the man up
[1:31:54] there doing that because you and I both
[1:31:56] know that man right there don't even
[1:31:58] have a church and he has never even had
[1:32:01] a Sunday school class all he has done is
[1:32:05] got together the principles of the
[1:32:07] success of other men you're the one
[1:32:09] who's caused that to happen and he's
[1:32:12] making a name off of the success of a
[1:32:15] the man well that's the way it is a lot
[1:32:16] of times isn't it so they will become
[1:32:18] the rich and the famous and the
[1:32:20] important but to strip out those little
[1:32:22] men the prophet one time in a meeting
[1:32:24] and also can find this on tape well he
[1:32:26] talked about people that was fasting
[1:32:28] could come to the end of the service and
[1:32:29] he said that lame was healed and the
[1:32:31] blinded eyes were open and brother Brown
[1:32:33] said I'll tell you what caused the
[1:32:35] effect of this meeting it was some of
[1:32:37] this certain Brothers here and there and
[1:32:38] there and called their name and he said
[1:32:40] they have been fasting since the meeting
[1:32:42] started and God honored their fasting
[1:32:45] and their prayers you see that is a
[1:32:48] great man because a great man does not
[1:32:51] build his work on the labor of others
[1:32:54] and act like he himself was the one who
[1:32:57] did it well praise the Lord but he is
[1:33:00] able to recognize I think it ought to be
[1:33:03] a and the same Among Us that some that
[1:33:06] may fill out their unsung heroes will
[1:33:07] all I ever do is pray for brother Donnie
[1:33:09] don't you ever say that as if that was a
[1:33:12] small thing that is a great thing to me
[1:33:14] well I've never will be able to buy
[1:33:15] brother Donnie no vacation I couldn't
[1:33:17] even send him to Asheville and back
[1:33:19] that's all right you don't need to I've
[1:33:21] got a credit card but I'll tell you what
[1:33:22] you can do you can pray for me and you
[1:33:25] can love me and you can stand for me
[1:33:27] when things are going against me and
[1:33:29] when the things is difficult look I need
[1:33:31] people to stand with me like you need
[1:33:33] people to stand with you and what's so
[1:33:35] hurtful is when a pastor comes in one of
[1:33:38] the hardest time of his life and when
[1:33:40] you need people and then they turn and
[1:33:43] walk away from you you ought to
[1:33:44] experience that feeling when you give
[1:33:46] years of your life you give sleepless
[1:33:49] nights after another and they turn and
[1:33:51] walk away from you in the time of
[1:33:53] trouble what a disgrace what a disgrace
[1:33:56] what a disgrace if your brothers and
[1:33:58] sisters need you and needs your prayers
[1:34:01] and need your friendship and the time of
[1:34:04] trouble oh friend let's not do them like
[1:34:06] the disciples did the Lord Jesus when
[1:34:09] the Lord Jesus went out to pray and he
[1:34:11] come back and his disciples was all
[1:34:13] asleep and you imagine the hurt
[1:34:14] wonderful question that he asked could
[1:34:17] not you watch with me for one hour could
[1:34:20] not it must have broke his heart by the
[1:34:22] Larry that he comes back and nobody is
[1:34:25] praying nobody is sitting there oh Jesus
[1:34:28] Jesus we're so sorry if he ever needed
[1:34:32] them and not one of them even showed
[1:34:34] concern all sheltered oh yes I'd have
[1:34:36] never done that well let's judge the way
[1:34:38] you're treating God's people now and
[1:34:40] we'll see how you'd have treated him
[1:34:41] then so you find somebody down and out
[1:34:44] in the church we're not here to push
[1:34:46] them down farther I don't understand
[1:34:48] we're supposed to be the army of God and
[1:34:50] when our people get down we go back and
[1:34:53] kill our own wounded we push them on
[1:34:55] down we stomp their head in the ground
[1:34:57] well you may do that but I ain't going
[1:34:59] to do it I'm going to reach down even if
[1:35:01] I've got to get my hands dirty I'm going
[1:35:04] to reach down if they're in the filth
[1:35:06] and the mire if that's what I gotta do
[1:35:08] that's what I'm gonna do why because
[1:35:10] that's what God's Prophet said the
[1:35:13] people do look at Abraham I'm reaching
[1:35:15] down there to get lost he risked his own
[1:35:17] life and risks the life of 318 of his
[1:35:20] own servant to go get her a penny a
[1:35:24] penny you rest the life of a silver
[1:35:27] dollar to get a penny if you've got the
[1:35:29] love of God in you you will all let them
[1:35:32] go they're worthless and who made you
[1:35:34] God
[1:35:35] [Applause]
[1:35:40] whew
[1:35:42] dear Jesus
[1:35:44] let's stand
[1:35:49] who
[1:35:51] praise the Lord
[1:35:55] I didn't say I was down I just told you
[1:35:56] to stand let me read another paragraph
[1:35:58] here to you
[1:35:59] where the church is now he said this is
[1:36:01] my purpose in doing this
[1:36:03] the church is always
[1:36:06] trying to take somebody else's corner
[1:36:10] but don't do that
[1:36:12] you can never raise corn in ephraim's
[1:36:14] corner your Manasseh
[1:36:17] you got to take your place in Christ
[1:36:19] positionally
[1:36:21] take it
[1:36:22] so don't just be something so yourself
[1:36:24] I'm doing something no
[1:36:28] go before God
[1:36:30] help me
[1:36:31] what can I do
[1:36:33] What Can I Do Lord to help the body
[1:36:36] what can I do to help the ministry what
[1:36:39] can I do to help the preachers of the
[1:36:40] church What Can I Do Lord to help the
[1:36:42] ministry around the world
[1:36:45] well some of you can't support them you
[1:36:47] don't have the means to do that
[1:36:49] but you can bombard heaven for him
[1:36:52] God brings one on your heart at three
[1:36:54] o'clock in the morning you may not know
[1:36:56] it may be your prayer that God will send
[1:36:58] the angel of the Lord by his win bring
[1:36:59] him out the deepest thing has ever been
[1:37:01] in his life
[1:37:04] and when you stand there that day and
[1:37:05] the Lord says oh
[1:37:07] I see you was woke up at 305
[1:37:10] on Tuesday morning you couldn't go back
[1:37:13] to sleep you lay there and prayed and
[1:37:15] prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:37:18] just so you'll know it was your prayer
[1:37:21] that was answered in the servant of God
[1:37:23] got a Deliverance that he needed
[1:37:26] and you saw oh my goodness
[1:37:28] my prayer
[1:37:30] you mean I've done that
[1:37:37] man wants to do more
[1:37:39] for God
[1:37:41] and his people
[1:37:45] Hallelujah
[1:38:00] Lord Jesus
[1:38:02] as we bow our heads tonight father
[1:38:07] dear God we don't desire to be great
[1:38:09] people
[1:38:12] we don't desire to be important
[1:38:15] we don't want to be begging our own eyes
[1:38:18] but if there's something
[1:38:20] you can do with us Lord
[1:38:24] in a week or so
[1:38:27] Carol and I will be 67 years old
[1:38:30] I would have never thought
[1:38:33] time would have ever went on this long
[1:38:37] I would have never thought I would have
[1:38:38] outlived my mother and father and live
[1:38:40] longer than them
[1:38:43] Lord I've lived already
[1:38:46] longer than the allotted time you gave
[1:38:48] to your prophet
[1:38:50] how much more time do I have left Lord
[1:38:53] you're the only one who knows
[1:38:56] dear God I pray whatever time I do have
[1:38:59] left
[1:39:00] help me that I can serve you
[1:39:03] with all of my heart
[1:39:06] Jesus
[1:39:08] I think if you were when you were here
[1:39:11] walking on the Earth
[1:39:13] and I read how you were treated
[1:39:16] and I was saying oh
[1:39:18] if I could have only been there
[1:39:21] I would have done this or that or the
[1:39:23] other
[1:39:25] the Lord
[1:39:26] I have my opportunity now
[1:39:31] so Lord
[1:39:33] May each of us look at ourselves and
[1:39:35] think
[1:39:36] am I living just a selfish life to where
[1:39:40] it's it's my my job my home my family my
[1:39:45] my my
[1:39:47] help us Lord to search
[1:39:50] and realize
[1:39:52] we are a body
[1:39:54] and we're just a local assembly here but
[1:39:56] we are a body that's in touch with
[1:39:59] people around the world

[1:40:44] of what you've committed to our care
[1:40:48] forgive us Lord God
[1:40:51] help me Lord that I'll not turn my back
[1:40:54] on my brothers my sisters
[1:40:59] oh I hope I hope
[1:41:02] that if I would have been one of them in
[1:41:03] the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:41:05] that when you come back
[1:41:08] I would have been praying or at least
[1:41:10] setting up
[1:41:12] what I've been like Peter
[1:41:15] would I
[1:41:17] I know self-deceit is one of the hardest
[1:41:19] things to see
[1:41:23] how would we all have been
[1:41:25] it would go back in time and instead of
[1:41:27] it being James and John and Peter and
[1:41:29] their other brothers it was us
[1:41:32] it's me and Joe and Daryl and Joel
[1:41:38] Kings these other brothers and sisters
[1:41:41] it was us in the garden
[1:41:44] what would you have found if you'd
[1:41:45] walked in on us
[1:41:49] what we've been sleeping to
[1:41:51] would you have woke us up and said hey

[1:42:19] father may this be such a
[1:42:22] an alarm as it were
[1:42:25] we think different
[1:42:27] we behave differently toward one another
[1:42:31] forgive us for having respect of persons
[1:42:36] thinking this person is better than the
[1:42:38] other one and they're in a better class
[1:42:42] your Prophet has already told us about
[1:42:45] class
[1:42:46] he said that kind of class
[1:42:49] was of the devil
[1:42:52] so I don't want none of it I don't want
[1:42:55] nothing to do with it Lord
[1:42:57] as a matter of fact he went on to Define
[1:42:59] class for us he said there is no better
[1:43:03] class
[1:43:04] than the people of God
[1:43:09] in that Lord I've seen
[1:43:12] around the world walk into their homes
[1:43:16] a dirt floor in their house
[1:43:19] some of them Lord with not even proper
[1:43:21] clothes on
[1:43:24] and yet Lord they went out
[1:43:26] and bought me a little drink and bought
[1:43:29] me a little treat
[1:43:31] no tell them what it cost them they
[1:43:34] wanted to bring it to me
[1:43:35] and the sisters bowed before you and
[1:43:39] walk backwards out of your presence
[1:43:43] and the brothers come in and bow down on
[1:43:45] the knee and say brother would you
[1:43:47] please pray for me

[1:44:54] that he prayed

[1:45:00] he didn't pray that they'd all be healed
[1:45:02] by Divine Healing
[1:45:05] but he prayed they would find a cure for
[1:45:07] it
[1:45:09] he loved humans
[1:45:11] he didn't just love the message people
[1:45:14] but he loved human beings

[1:47:11] be centered on what I can do for you
[1:47:18] granted I pray Lord God
[1:47:22] we know that brother random said raising
[1:47:25] our hands is a sign of universal sign of
[1:47:29] surrender
[1:47:31] may we raise our hands tonight
[1:47:34] as a sign of surrender
[1:47:36] to the will of God
[1:47:39] I Surrender my opinion My Views this
[1:47:41] other if they're wrong
[1:47:43] I surrender to you Lord Jesus
[1:47:46] take me Lord use me help me
[1:47:49] but keep in mind what you want to do for
[1:47:52] God and what you're called to do for God
[1:47:54] is not always the same thing
[1:47:57] you may think you're so talented and so
[1:47:59] gifted to do this or that or the other
[1:48:01] and you think well this is my strong
[1:48:03] point well I hate to be the one to
[1:48:05] inform you he generally don't use our
[1:48:08] strengths he uses our weaknesses
[1:48:12] it takes those weaknesses and does the
[1:48:14] job with our weaknesses
[1:48:16] proven that it was him that did it
[1:48:20] praise the Lord
[1:48:22] with their hands uplifted not only those
[1:48:24] in the visible audience those of you
[1:48:26] that are streaming tonight Wherever You
[1:48:27] Are
[1:48:29] we surrender all Lord
[1:48:31] Hallelujah
[1:48:34] we give you our strengths which
[1:48:36] sometimes is our greatest enemy
[1:48:38] we give you our weaknesses
[1:48:40] the things we're ashamed of
[1:48:43] our frailties our infirmities
[1:48:46] and yet your prophet and preaching that
[1:48:48] resounding message of perfect strength
[1:48:50] to perfect weakness says that's what you
[1:48:52] take and you tackle the job with that
[1:48:55] and Moses said he was not eloquent he
[1:48:58] couldn't speak he didn't have a message
[1:49:00] all the things he didn't have and God
[1:49:01] said I'll take every one of them and
[1:49:04] I'll take over Egypt with them
[1:49:06] which is exactly what you did
[1:49:09] thank you Father
[1:49:10] you took an illiterate Kentuckian that
[1:49:13] didn't even graduate from high school
[1:49:16] the preachers no doubt set behind him
[1:49:18] and laughed as he spoke his words and he
[1:49:21] didn't speak the proper language
[1:49:24] but yet as they come to deal Moody and
[1:49:26] they wrote an article about it
[1:49:28] and the newspaper person said I don't
[1:49:31] know why in the world anybody would go
[1:49:33] here D.L Moody said he whines got long
[1:49:37] whiskers
[1:49:39] ugliest man I ever seen in my life
[1:49:41] went through a whole list of things and
[1:49:43] the manager ready to deal mood and he
[1:49:46] Shrugged his shoulders and said of
[1:49:48] course not they're coming to see Christ
[1:49:51] Hallelujah
[1:49:53] Lord God I pray that a way to be with
[1:49:56] our lives not a common to see our nice
[1:49:59] building they ain't coming to see our

[1:50:05] coming to get healed they're coming to

[1:50:54] do we can pray we can say encouraging
[1:50:57] words we can uplift there's so much we

[1:51:50] Moody

[1:52:45] what about some of you young sisters
[1:52:47] what about going visiting some of these
[1:52:49] sisters that can't come to church no

[1:52:52] how about some of your brothers get a
[1:52:53] guitar and go visit some of those that
[1:52:55] can't come to church no more
[1:52:57] shut-ins we call them let's not forget
[1:52:59] about them
[1:53:00] well well they don't get to come to
[1:53:02] church no more well let's take Church to
[1:53:04] them
[1:53:05] let's just reach out and see is there
[1:53:07] something we can do is there somebody
[1:53:09] that we could reach out to them and you
[1:53:11] stand before the Lord Jesus that day and
[1:53:13] he opens your bones say oh I see you
[1:53:16] took your guitar over there
[1:53:18] you'll never know what that meant to
[1:53:19] them they laid down that bed that that
[1:53:22] night in their bed and they wept like a
[1:53:24] baby and they thanked me over and over
[1:53:26] again for you coming and singing them
[1:53:28] them pretty songs
[1:53:30] and the Lord Jesus added it to your
[1:53:32] account
[1:53:33] why because as you sung to her you sung
[1:53:37] to him as you sung to that brother it
[1:53:41] was like you were singing to Jesus
[1:53:43] you remember the story that the prophet
[1:53:45] tells us it was in the days of the
[1:53:47] depression
[1:53:48] and a man had a sick wife
[1:53:51] they didn't have Medicare Medicaid like
[1:53:53] we do today but they would have vouchers
[1:53:57] that would be administered to you from
[1:53:59] the local official so you couldn't pay
[1:54:01] for your medication you'd have to go
[1:54:03] stand in line to get a voucher
[1:54:06] so this man had a sick wife he went to
[1:54:09] the drugstore to get it
[1:54:11] and he said sir
[1:54:12] he said I promise you I'll go stand in
[1:54:15] that line I don't care how long it takes
[1:54:16] I don't care what it is I'll do it he
[1:54:20] said sir I'm sorry we just can't do that
[1:54:21] here we just can't do it if we do it for
[1:54:24] you we'll have to do it for everybody
[1:54:25] else he said but my wife is so sick I
[1:54:28] promise you I give you my word if you'll
[1:54:31] give it to her right now well I'll go
[1:54:32] stand and I said we just can't do it we
[1:54:35] just we just can't do that
[1:54:38] the man telling brother Brandon was the
[1:54:40] owner of the drugstore he said brother
[1:54:41] Branham
[1:54:42] I heard that story and I said wait a
[1:54:44] minute I was sitting back in the office
[1:54:47] laughs
[1:54:49] he said I get up and went out
[1:54:52] and I looked at that woman he said she
[1:54:55] was so sick
[1:54:57] and he said let me have that
[1:55:00] so this man went and filled a
[1:55:02] prescription
[1:55:08] and laid it in that woman's hand
[1:55:12] and he said brother Branham
[1:55:14] when I did it
[1:55:17] it was Jesus
[1:55:22] how late that
[1:55:25] medicine
[1:55:26] in the hands of Jesus
[1:55:29] I said do you believe that he said yes I
[1:55:32] believe it
[1:55:33] because he said when you do it to the
[1:55:35] least of these
[1:55:37] you do it to me
[1:55:44] sometimes the least things that all of
[1:55:47] us can do
[1:55:48] are things that we think have no value
[1:55:51] but you imagine that day when he stands
[1:55:53] before the Lord Jesus
[1:56:00] and that man will walk up there
[1:56:03] and he'll say
[1:56:05] thank you for that medicine you give me
