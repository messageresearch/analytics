[1:01:23] that you just help us now
[1:01:25] in your name amen amen
[1:01:30] Matthew 14 24 but the ship was now in
[1:01:34] the midst of the sea tossed with waves
[1:01:37] for the wind was contrary
[1:01:39] and in the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:01:41] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[1:01:45] and when he
[1:01:46] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:01:49] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:01:51] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[1:01:54] but straight away
[1:01:55] straightway Jesus spoke unto them saying
[1:01:58] be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid
[1:02:00] and Peter answered him and said Lord
[1:02:04] if it be thou bid me come unto thee on
[1:02:07] the water and he said come and when
[1:02:09] Peter was come down out of the ship he
[1:02:11] walked on the water to go to Jesus but
[1:02:14] he when he saw the wind boisterous he
[1:02:17] was afraid and began to sink
[1:02:19] he cried saying Lord save me and
[1:02:21] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[1:02:23] hand
[1:02:24] they'd call him and said unto him o thou
[1:02:28] of little faith
[1:02:29] wherefore this thou doubt
[1:02:32] and when they were come into the ship
[1:02:35] this wind ceased
[1:02:37] then
[1:02:38] they that were in the ship came and
[1:02:40] worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art
[1:02:43] the Son of God God bless you may be
[1:02:45] seated
[1:02:50] so I I kind of had a clue that I might
[1:02:52] be preaching
[1:02:54] Monday or Tuesday
[1:02:57] and I was praying like you're supposed
[1:02:58] to do and uh
[1:03:02] Wednesday and I went to bed and I had a
[1:03:03] dream
[1:03:05] and it's not super spiritual don't don't
[1:03:07] get excited I'm not
[1:03:08] but
[1:03:10] I dreamed brother Nani looked down and
[1:03:12] he said
[1:03:13] you are the wow
[1:03:16] the wow
[1:03:22] and so that's what I'm I'm looking at
[1:03:26] the service and titling that you are the
[1:03:28] wow
[1:03:30] and uh you know when when sister Brown
[1:03:32] died that they said she was looking up
[1:03:35] saying oh wow
[1:03:37] oh wow and I tied that together I
[1:03:39] thought Lord what are you
[1:03:41] well you are that wow when she said I
[1:03:45] man I wonder what she was saying I
[1:03:47] believe she was seeing us
[1:03:50] she was looking Beyond her circumstance
[1:03:53] she was looking Beyond where she was at
[1:03:56] In the Flesh and she was looking
[1:03:58] past the curtain of time seeing
[1:04:01] something that made her say wow
[1:04:06] amen now
[1:04:09] he says wow you know I'll just give you
[1:04:11] the definition it says astonished
[1:04:15] or admiration
[1:04:19] or a sensational success
[1:04:22] a sensational success
[1:04:25] you are the wow
[1:04:28] brother John
[1:04:30] oh buddy
[1:04:32] we can start with you and find out that
[1:04:34] you are not a successful success
[1:04:37] we could all look at ourselves and say
[1:04:40] wow you think you're the wow
[1:04:43] it's astonishing that you would even
[1:04:45] think that about you and I I you know
[1:04:47] and I'll pick on me because I know that
[1:04:50] in my flesh I am not an astonishing
[1:04:52] success got a lot of faults I got a lot
[1:04:55] of failures if I didn't guess what I'd
[1:04:58] be gone
[1:04:59] you'd be gone
[1:05:01] so let's just put it all out there we
[1:05:03] all know that we're not gone right we're
[1:05:06] all here
[1:05:07] right
[1:05:08] so we know we're not a sensational
[1:05:11] success here
[1:05:13] we all know where we're at right
[1:05:16] all right so
[1:05:18] here's here's Peter
[1:05:20] and Jesus and he he's walking on the
[1:05:23] water now
[1:05:26] it says uh
[1:05:29] before this Jesus sent them away to go
[1:05:31] pray on the other side now I can imagine
[1:05:34] when he sent he said go ahead and go
[1:05:36] across
[1:05:37] can you imagine his disciples going
[1:05:41] how is he going to catch up with us what
[1:05:43] is he doing
[1:05:45] good wait here
[1:05:47] and he can go on the mountain and pray
[1:05:48] what what's the but he sent him across
[1:05:51] so it tells me that Jesus had something
[1:05:55] in mind
[1:05:58] he had something there in his mind to
[1:06:00] say hey
[1:06:02] go do what I say
[1:06:05] um
[1:06:08] how are we going to become that wow
[1:06:10] that's Mr Brown saw how are we going to
[1:06:12] do that
[1:06:16] how is that going to happen
[1:06:18] in our flesh
[1:06:21] we're questioning Lord why
[1:06:26] now what's going on
[1:06:29] how are you going to leave me and me be
[1:06:31] successful
[1:06:33] how are you going to go on the mountain
[1:06:35] pray
[1:06:37] and leave me here
[1:06:44] now this is the part where the nerves go
[1:06:46] away and the preacher comes out so you
[1:06:47] pull on the gift
[1:06:49] foreign
[1:06:54] and he said
[1:06:56] and and so the fourth night of the watch
[1:06:58] and Jesus comes down he's walking on the
[1:07:00] sea and when the disciples saw him
[1:07:02] walking on the sea they were trouble
[1:07:03] saying you know it is a spirit and they
[1:07:06] cried out for fear
[1:07:08] how many times have we confused
[1:07:11] something good that God is about to do
[1:07:14] for something scary
[1:07:17] the Lord is not easy serve the Lord
[1:07:19] since can sometimes be real scary it can
[1:07:22] be real scary saying okay
[1:07:27] right
[1:07:31] all right brother Keith I want you to
[1:07:33] stand up and I want you to trust fall
[1:07:35] into brother Noah as he's standing now
[1:07:37] right
[1:07:41] what's wrong with that
[1:07:46] Joseph you catch my father-in-law he's
[1:07:49] going to trust for you
[1:07:52] right it's a scary thing
[1:07:55] but that's what we have to do every day
[1:07:57] when we wake up we have to learn to just
[1:07:59] let ourselves go and fall into his arms
[1:08:02] we have to learn to just step back and
[1:08:05] say Lord
[1:08:07] here I am
[1:08:08] it's all you I'm not going to do it I
[1:08:11] don't trust that
[1:08:15] do you understand what I'm saying so so
[1:08:19] to get out there

[1:08:37] but that's what we're having to do to
[1:08:39] become that wild people

[1:08:55] I don't usually get that dry that fast
[1:09:01] now
[1:09:02] we're gonna
[1:09:04] so we're we're finding out that that
[1:09:06] that trust is the first part of of what
[1:09:09] God wants us to do
[1:09:10] he's saying just trust me
[1:09:13] trust me if you're going to be the wild
[1:09:15] people you've got to learn to trust me
[1:09:20] sometimes we can't even trust our wife
[1:09:22] or a husband
[1:09:25] or our kids Lord help us we can't trust
[1:09:28] our kids
[1:09:30] we got people very close to us
[1:09:34] that we've seen over and over again come
[1:09:36] through for us
[1:09:43] and we have a hard time trusting
[1:09:47] um
[1:09:48] but now we've got Jesus in his word and
[1:09:52] we say we believe
[1:09:54] right we say we believe we we we don't
[1:09:58] understand it all but we believe it
[1:10:00] right
[1:10:03] but do we believe it
[1:10:06] um
[1:10:07] wow
[1:10:08] wow
[1:10:10] yeah we're getting there brother sister
[1:10:13] this is not a service a beat down this
[1:10:15] is an encouragement service
[1:10:20] we're getting there
[1:10:22] I'm learning to trust him more and more
[1:10:25] and more sometimes it's like
[1:10:28] oh I gotta pray some more
[1:10:30] oh this is a circumstance I have got to
[1:10:35] pray some more
[1:10:37] right
[1:10:40] right
[1:10:41] Hebrews 12 1-11 wherefore seeing we are
[1:10:45] also
[1:10:46] we also are compassed about with such a
[1:10:49] great cloud of witnesses laying aside
[1:10:51] every weight and a sin which does so
[1:10:53] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:10:56] patience the rates that is set before us
[1:10:59] so he's saying we're running a race
[1:11:02] we got this stuff
[1:11:04] we all got stuff
[1:11:07] all those sins that so easily beset us
[1:11:10] but in order to win this race
[1:11:13] in order to become the wild people
[1:11:15] I'm gonna have to start putting some of
[1:11:17] that stuff down
[1:11:20] we're going to have to set that stuff
[1:11:22] aside all those things that are holding
[1:11:25] us back those things that are that are
[1:11:27] keeping us from
[1:11:29] A Closer Walk
[1:11:30] it's hard to get down and pray
[1:11:35] when you've got something in your back
[1:11:37] pocket that's just not right
[1:11:40] [Applause]
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:42] it's hard to get over that hurdle
[1:11:45] yeah and if it's a if it's a mistake and
[1:11:49] you do it once that's one thing but
[1:11:50] these besetting sins
[1:11:56] I've overcome a besetting sin about a
[1:11:58] 100 times you know what I'm saying
[1:12:01] this is the last time
[1:12:03] this is the last time I'm gonna have a
[1:12:05] problem with this
[1:12:07] right
[1:12:08] come on but I will tell you there's an
[1:12:10] overcoming power that's living in you to
[1:12:14] make you the wild people yeah
[1:12:19] those besetting sins are going to be by
[1:12:22] the wayside
[1:12:24] today might be your day
[1:12:27] right now might be your time
[1:12:31] but you have to trust that the Lord is
[1:12:33] going to take those things away from you
[1:12:39] I don't care what it is
[1:12:43] people
[1:12:44] don't understand what a demon is
[1:12:48] or how that it can possess you
[1:12:53] um
[1:12:54] we'll settle down on that just a minute
[1:12:57] people don't understand what a demon is
[1:13:00] until you get delivered from one
[1:13:04] you don't even realize that you've got
[1:13:07] this thing hooked on to you and it's
[1:13:09] following you around and it's pulling on
[1:13:11] you and it's tempting you
[1:13:14] and it's bothering you it's always in
[1:13:16] the back of your mind
[1:13:20] but once you get delivered
[1:13:23] you start walking towards that wow
[1:13:26] it's amazing it's a life-changing
[1:13:29] experience and sometimes it's not some
[1:13:31] preacher casting it out it's just the
[1:13:33] word coming forth
[1:13:36] sometimes it's just you hear in the word
[1:13:39] and accepting it and Trust falling into
[1:13:40] his arms
[1:13:45] we are a wild people
[1:13:48] and now
[1:13:50] right now
[1:13:53] it's manifesting it's coming to pass
[1:13:55] Brother John

[1:14:02] I've never seen it like this
[1:14:06] I've never seen the spirit of God moving
[1:14:08] on the people more than right now
[1:14:12] don't get left
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:15] learn to trust
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:19] learn to trust
[1:14:26] I didn't I guess since I didn't look at
[1:14:29] the clock I don't start my time until
[1:14:30] now
[1:14:33] I'm just kidding
[1:14:39] lay aside every weight
[1:14:41] in the sin that which so easily beset us
[1:14:44] and let us run with patience the race
[1:14:46] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[1:14:50] the author and finisher of of our faith
[1:14:54] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:14:58] endured the cross
[1:15:00] so the scripture before he was talking
[1:15:02] about your
[1:15:04] been setting sins
[1:15:07] and he told us look unto Jesus you know
[1:15:09] this is the
[1:15:11] Charles Spurgeon he went to a I think it
[1:15:15] was a Methodist Church and the minister
[1:15:17] preached on
[1:15:18] look to Jesus and that's what changed
[1:15:21] his life
[1:15:23] wow
[1:15:25] so simple
[1:15:28] but he was a young man of 14 I think it
[1:15:30] was in and here we go
[1:15:33] he was 14 years old and he had he had
[1:15:36] some questions his his brothers were
[1:15:39] ministers he was his father was a
[1:15:41] minister he grew up in church but he he
[1:15:43] knew something wasn't right it wasn't
[1:15:45] settled
[1:15:47] and he went into a church and he sat
[1:15:49] down and this man preached look at look
[1:15:51] to Jesus
[1:15:53] how simple is that
[1:15:56] that man
[1:15:57] tore England apart
[1:16:00] because he looked to Jesus
[1:16:06] what a simple thought
[1:16:09] we get in trouble and we look to our
[1:16:11] phone we look to Google
[1:16:17] what do they say about things about it
[1:16:20] on Facebook let me put it out there
[1:16:26] it amazes me my kids say Dad you could
[1:16:28] text faster if you could use two fingers
[1:16:32] I don't like the text in the first place
[1:16:37] why should I change I had a big keyboard
[1:16:40] and I was doing this before
[1:16:49] yeah I'm
[1:16:50] I qualify as that generation
[1:16:58] and and everything else he he was
[1:17:01] worried about where he was at
[1:17:04] anybody here right where am I at
[1:17:08] he was worried about what he was going
[1:17:10] to become
[1:17:13] all the answers are simple
[1:17:16] look to Jesus
[1:17:19] it's a simple concept
[1:17:21] it's a hard thing to do
[1:17:24] amen but it's a simple concept
[1:17:28] look to Jesus
[1:17:30] hmm
[1:17:34] yeah I'm not going to get about that's
[1:17:36] five minutes and I ain't even that's two
[1:17:38] scriptures
[1:17:39] for consider him that endures
[1:17:42] let me go back up the author and finish
[1:17:45] of our faith who for the joy that was
[1:17:48] set before him so let's put Jesus in or
[1:17:51] or God in a race right he knows what the
[1:17:54] joy is at the end
[1:17:56] right
[1:18:00] think about it in that context
[1:18:02] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[1:18:04] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:18:06] that was set before him endured the
[1:18:07] cross look into Jesus
[1:18:10] he knew what was coming
[1:18:12] it's like I get tore up
[1:18:14] the minute he brother Donnie asked me to
[1:18:16] preach it tore up
[1:18:19] I get nerves and it's nerves nerves
[1:18:21] nerves until I get up here and I start
[1:18:23] saying
[1:18:25] now I'm having a good time
[1:18:28] because once that anointing comes
[1:18:31] it's a whole different story
[1:18:35] yeah right yeah
[1:18:38] but we're looking unto Jesus
[1:18:43] and Jesus saw what the end result was
[1:18:46] going to be
[1:18:48] we got to quit concentrating on this
[1:18:49] stuff down here
[1:18:52] it is a mess
[1:18:54] you can get depressed in 2.5 seconds if
[1:18:58] you look at the news
[1:19:01] and what's even scary
[1:19:03] is you can get depressed faster if you
[1:19:06] look at your circumstances because all
[1:19:08] the hell is against the wow
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:15] but that's not what we're looking to
[1:19:21] hmm
[1:19:24] if we're consider him that endures such
[1:19:25] contradiction of Sinner against himself
[1:19:27] lest he be weary and faint in your minds
[1:19:31] ye have not
[1:19:34] sorry that's enough of this
[1:19:37] ye have not resisted unto the blood
[1:19:39] striving against sin
[1:19:40] and you have not
[1:19:43] and ye have forgotten extortation which
[1:19:46] speaketh unto you as children my son
[1:19:48] despise not thou the chastening of the
[1:19:51] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:19:54] him
[1:19:55] so when we get corrected
[1:19:58] we ain't supposed I know you've heard
[1:19:59] this
[1:20:00] but have we heard it
[1:20:04] when we get rebuked
[1:20:09] we're supposed to look under Jesus yeah
[1:20:13] I've seen some rotten parents in my time
[1:20:17] you know how they're rotten parent I
[1:20:18] know they're rotten parents
[1:20:20] I've seen their rotten kids
[1:20:26] there's none in here
[1:20:31] you all are angels
[1:20:38] but that's the truth of it
[1:20:41] you think man
[1:20:44] that kid needs a licking yeah
[1:20:50] boy
[1:20:52] heck that kid ain't gonna spank himself
[1:20:59] hmm yeah right
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:05] so the lord loves us enough to whoop us
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:11] I've got four kids I'm not going to do
[1:21:13] anything just relax boy
[1:21:17] some of them
[1:21:19] needed a little firmer hand
[1:21:21] if I could put it that way than the
[1:21:24] others
[1:21:26] it's just their nature that's just the
[1:21:28] way they are
[1:21:31] but they still got a firm hand when they
[1:21:32] needed a firm hand
[1:21:35] hmm
[1:21:36] some of us yeah
[1:21:41] some of us
[1:21:43] Brad Gilbert needed a firm I'm just
[1:21:45] kidding buddy
[1:21:50] he'll get me later don't worry
[1:21:53] he's my buddy
[1:21:55] some of us need a little firmer hand
[1:21:58] yeah
[1:22:02] and some of us need different discipline
[1:22:06] some of them I had to spank other ones I
[1:22:09] had to take stuff away
[1:22:13] and my daughter was perfect
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] that's what happens when you only have
[1:22:22] one
[1:22:26] but but all of us
[1:22:28] we need different things in our lives to
[1:22:30] to pull that out because we're all born
[1:22:33] with different natures
[1:22:34] what we're trying to do is become the
[1:22:36] wow
[1:22:38] we're trying to be the wow of Heaven
[1:22:40] man sometimes it's painful
[1:22:45] but we still are going to be the wow of
[1:22:48] Heaven
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:23:00] so
[1:23:01] brother Brown says
[1:23:03] everything is looking the Ford company
[1:23:05] is looking to make a better Ford the
[1:23:07] Chevrolet is looking to make a better
[1:23:10] Chevrolet Phoenix is looking to make a
[1:23:13] larger and better town the nation is
[1:23:15] looking for more territory so it can
[1:23:17] spread itself the church just the church
[1:23:20] is looking for members
[1:23:23] but the bride
[1:23:25] is looking for the coming
[1:23:27] of the Lord
[1:23:31] oh my God
[1:23:33] the bride is looking for the coming of
[1:23:35] the Lord
[1:23:38] no matter what the cost no matter how
[1:23:41] hard it is
[1:23:43] no matter what we go through
[1:23:45] yes
[1:23:47] we got our eyes on the prize
[1:23:51] believe it or not I used to run a lot
[1:23:54] maybe that's why I don't do it so much
[1:23:55] now I got all mine out of the way
[1:24:01] but the thing that we I I used to
[1:24:04] wrestle so
[1:24:07] we would we would run
[1:24:10] four miles
[1:24:14] wrestle
[1:24:15] hard for two hours
[1:24:18] and then run eight more miles
[1:24:23] that's why I got the physique I got
[1:24:24] today
[1:24:33] but the thing I learned about running
[1:24:36] is if you run like this you're going to
[1:24:38] wear yourself out and probably run into
[1:24:40] a wall
[1:24:42] but you gotta look up look towards the
[1:24:45] goal look at the promise look where
[1:24:48] you're going
[1:24:51] and then to get into better shape you
[1:24:54] think yeah we're going to take the
[1:24:55] advice from this guy
[1:24:57] but to get into better shape
[1:25:00] we used to run my high school if you ran
[1:25:03] four times it was a mile
[1:25:05] around the halls
[1:25:08] but that last lap
[1:25:10] that you had to do when you were the
[1:25:12] tiredest and the most wore out
[1:25:15] and absolutely didn't think you could
[1:25:17] take one more step
[1:25:19] that's when you put in your mind
[1:25:22] and you said I'm going to run harder and
[1:25:24] faster than I did the whole time and you
[1:25:27] sprint your guts out
[1:25:29] you push yourself until you cannot go
[1:25:32] anymore
[1:25:33] you absolutely got to find it down in
[1:25:36] the inside of the inside of the inside
[1:25:39] because your legs are falling off
[1:25:43] your wind is nowhere to be found
[1:25:46] but if you can dig down just ask any
[1:25:49] real good athlete
[1:25:54] but if you could dig down and really
[1:25:56] just say I'm going to do it
[1:25:59] and push yourself
[1:26:02] it run hard
[1:26:05] and make your legs move
[1:26:08] the next time you run it's a whole lot
[1:26:10] easier
[1:26:13] you got to push yourself
[1:26:15] we're towards the end of the race
[1:26:19] we're at the end of the race and if you
[1:26:22] push yourself
[1:26:24] this last lap not come dragging I watch
[1:26:27] my my nephew run across country
[1:26:31] and them dudes
[1:26:36] I saw one give so much that he could not
[1:26:39] he fell across the finish line
[1:26:42] done They Carried him out of the way so
[1:26:45] he wouldn't get trampled
[1:26:47] because he wanted to win so bad
[1:26:51] that guy gave everything
[1:26:59] now for us we're running this race
[1:27:04] we're pushing as hard as we can
[1:27:08] our legs feel like they're going to give
[1:27:10] out
[1:27:13] but we're not looking for inner well our
[1:27:15] Inner Strength
[1:27:18] we're looking to Jesus for that inner
[1:27:20] strength
[1:27:22] we're going to become the wow people
[1:27:27] just a little further
[1:27:33] last week I had a dead stop and it's not
[1:27:35] fun
[1:27:42] let me
[1:27:43] let's go to Galatians
[1:27:47] five
[1:27:57] five and seven
[1:27:59] says ye did
[1:28:00] run well
[1:28:02] who did hinder you that you should know
[1:28:03] not obey the truth
[1:28:06] this persuasion cometh not of him that
[1:28:09] calleth you
[1:28:10] this ain't God
[1:28:12] I used to struggle
[1:28:14] years ago coming up and praying for
[1:28:16] people
[1:28:18] I used to think
[1:28:21] I'm a minister I'm called to do it
[1:28:25] I'm supposed to do it
[1:28:27] yeah but I used to struggle thinking oh
[1:28:28] they're going to think I'm trying to
[1:28:29] make something out of myself
[1:28:31] that persuasion was not of heaven right
[1:28:34] right amen
[1:28:36] that wasn't of heaven and how many times
[1:28:39] do we find ourselves holding back
[1:28:42] oh I would I would Shout
[1:28:44] but I don't want people to think
[1:28:45] something of me
[1:28:49] think about it
[1:28:51] is that persuasion of you letting go and
[1:28:54] letting God
[1:28:55] of God
[1:28:58] that sounds so counterproductive
[1:29:01] why would he fight against what he wants
[1:29:04] [Applause]
[1:29:09] think about that
[1:29:11] you're running real well in the service
[1:29:15] you're pulling on a gift
[1:29:17] you worshiped
[1:29:20] you've put everything you have
[1:29:22] and the Lord says let go and let God
[1:29:26] and then you want to pull bags
[1:29:29] and the dawn
[1:29:32] I'm just shy I'm not saying you have to
[1:29:36] worship
[1:29:37] like I worship or somebody else does but
[1:29:40] if God leads you to do something amen
[1:29:43] what does that persuasion holding you
[1:29:45] back
[1:29:47] you did run well
[1:29:49] come on yeah
[1:29:53] you did you you ran really well
[1:29:58] what's hindering you
[1:30:00] what's hindering you in your worship
[1:30:08] uh oh
[1:30:10] what is holding you back from letting go
[1:30:14] is it your fear of Pentecost
[1:30:19] is it your fear of your neighbor
[1:30:23] if your neighbor doesn't want you
[1:30:27] to worship like that
[1:30:29] they're not part of the wow
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:36] is that right
[1:30:39] God said worship me
[1:30:43] don't hold back
[1:30:49] why you did run well finish the service
[1:30:52] out well let's worship him let's praise
[1:30:55] him let's give him watering and and
[1:30:58] worship water the the the the word with
[1:31:01] our praise
[1:31:02] what's hindering you
[1:31:05] every service should be a camp meeting
[1:31:07] service
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:14] why because I'm preaching brother Donnie
[1:31:16] no because he's here
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:22] it's not the man behind the desk it's
[1:31:25] The Man Behind The Man
[1:31:26] [Applause]
[1:31:27] that's good
[1:31:30] and it's not the man sitting in the Pew
[1:31:32] it's the man
[1:31:34] sitting in the Pew behind a man sitting
[1:31:36] in the pew
[1:31:41] you did run well
[1:31:48] look
[1:31:49] unto Jesus
[1:31:59] this persuasion
[1:32:01] cometh not of him that calleth you
[1:32:04] a little 11 11th the whole lump you
[1:32:08] can't just put a little yeast in there
[1:32:09] and not expect it to rise
[1:32:13] so the devil's job is to come in and
[1:32:17] plant any kind of
[1:32:19] something
[1:32:21] that's going to hold you back
[1:32:25] so what's the devil's goal
[1:32:27] he wants to be worshiped right
[1:32:29] so if you're worshiping the true and
[1:32:31] living God
[1:32:33] do you think he wants that to happen
[1:32:38] so he's going to put whatever he can in
[1:32:40] front of you to hold you back
[1:32:43] a little 11 11th to hold up
[1:32:50] I don't care if you think your hair is
[1:32:51] messed up and it keeps you in your seat
[1:32:54] or you're afraid that you're going to
[1:32:56] shout too loud
[1:33:00] one way or the other if God can or the
[1:33:03] devil can keep you from worshiping he's
[1:33:05] going to do it yeah
[1:33:07] he just needs a little Evan
[1:33:09] that's right you just needs a little
[1:33:10] hesitation just needs a little something
[1:33:12] holding you back
[1:33:15] good
[1:33:18] we're the Wild Heaven there's nothing
[1:33:20] going to hold us back
[1:33:23] the wall of Heaven there's nothing
[1:33:25] holding us
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:33] oh
[1:33:34] I have confidence and confidence in you
[1:33:37] through the Lord that you be that ye
[1:33:40] will none otherwise
[1:33:42] minded but he that troubles you shall
[1:33:45] bear his judgment whosoever
[1:33:48] he be hmm so if your neighbor comes to
[1:33:52] you and says
[1:33:54] I'm telling you this out of love
[1:34:00] I think you got a little excited
[1:34:08] and if it was god pushing you and God
[1:34:11] asking you to worship like that and God
[1:34:13] doing that
[1:34:17] and the next time you come in church and
[1:34:19] you hold back worried about that
[1:34:23] uh oh
[1:34:25] then there's two people in trouble
[1:34:28] you because you let the leaven
[1:34:31] and him because he put the leaven
[1:34:34] or her or whomever it might be
[1:34:39] right
[1:34:40] brother John you might scare the
[1:34:42] visitors
[1:34:48] come on
[1:34:51] if they're the wow
[1:34:54] it ain't gonna scare them
[1:34:58] if that's the wow
[1:35:00] it ain't gonna scare him
[1:35:06] you go on the street and start doing it
[1:35:08] and it scares them
[1:35:11] but here
[1:35:13] this is where we're supposed to do it
[1:35:16] this is what he called us to do
[1:35:22] I said it before
[1:35:23] this could be camp meeting every time we
[1:35:26] come
[1:35:27] every time
[1:35:36] I'm trying to pick through some of these
[1:35:37] here
[1:35:39] so Pentecostal people do you see that
[1:35:43] that's you
[1:35:45] these others can't believe in that they
[1:35:47] have nothing in them to believe with
[1:35:49] but the trouble of it is you've got
[1:35:52] you've got it and don't know it if the
[1:35:55] devil if the devil can get it
[1:35:58] and he can hide it from you and
[1:36:02] not let you know you've got it
[1:36:05] then he's got you licked
[1:36:13] if the devil can hide from you that you
[1:36:16] have got it the wow factor we heard a
[1:36:20] wow factor
[1:36:23] if he can hide that from you
[1:36:25] then you start doubting your experience
[1:36:30] and you start doubting your praise and
[1:36:32] you start doubting all this stuff and
[1:36:33] it's like you're still the wow but
[1:36:36] you're more like a well
[1:36:40] you're not a wow anymore you're just a
[1:36:42] well
[1:36:45] oh well
[1:36:48] now if you're a wow You'll become a wow
[1:36:51] but that chastening part
[1:36:54] good luck
[1:36:57] because he's going to get it out of you
[1:37:00] you're going to be a wow
[1:37:02] and if you're a wow and you're acting
[1:37:04] like a well then you're going to be in
[1:37:05] trouble
[1:37:12] I am not even getting close
[1:37:16] but the trouble is you've got it and
[1:37:18] don't know it if the devil came
[1:37:21] if
[1:37:22] you can get it and he can hide it from
[1:37:25] you and let
[1:37:29] not let you know you've got it he's got
[1:37:31] you licked see you can't fail there's no
[1:37:34] way of failing you're Abraham's seed God
[1:37:37] has sworn with an oath that he take you
[1:37:40] in amen there you are
[1:37:43] he made his Covenant
[1:37:46] Hallelujah
[1:37:50] he's the one that made that promise he's
[1:37:53] the one that made the Covenant he said
[1:37:54] you are my wild people and you will be
[1:37:57] my wild people and guess what you're
[1:37:59] going to be that
[1:38:01] [Applause]
[1:38:02] if I promised you that I I could you
[1:38:06] know give you a million dollars you
[1:38:07] better start doubting real quick
[1:38:11] if I promise you that I could get you
[1:38:13] into heaven you better be
[1:38:15] questioning my uh
[1:38:18] intention
[1:38:22] I'm not a TV evangelist
[1:38:26] bye
[1:38:28] I'm not promising you anything on my
[1:38:31] Merit
[1:38:35] I'm not that stupid
[1:38:37] yeah
[1:38:39] but God made the Covenant
[1:38:42] he made the promise he said I will have
[1:38:45] a wild people yes
[1:38:49] now if the devil can hide that from you
[1:38:52] then you're you're lacking in your
[1:38:54] experience
[1:38:55] you're not getting the full benefit
[1:38:58] just like me coming out being nervous
[1:39:01] nervous nervous coming out and now under
[1:39:03] the anointing the nerves are gone
[1:39:06] and so I'm gonna liken that to to where
[1:39:08] you're at
[1:39:10] you've got to get past your nerves
[1:39:12] you've got to get past your questions
[1:39:13] you gotta you gotta every time never
[1:39:16] fails I get back there and I start
[1:39:17] looking at my notes and I think oh no
[1:39:20] too simple
[1:39:23] Lord
[1:39:24] are you sure this is what
[1:39:27] you start questioning start doubting
[1:39:30] start getting in your own head yeah
[1:39:34] yeah some of you ain't gonna like this
[1:39:35] but I'm gonna tell you anyway
[1:39:39] I coach baseball
[1:39:41] my little boy's Little League
[1:39:43] I'm not a good coach I'm just a coach
[1:39:46] I've got other coaches that are coaches
[1:39:53] I'm not real
[1:39:55] fundamental or know all the tricks and
[1:39:57] know all this stuff I got I got Ryan
[1:39:59] Kennedy who played baseball for years I
[1:40:01] got another guy who who pitched and got
[1:40:04] drafted and blew out his arm so it ain't
[1:40:06] no baseball
[1:40:08] I'm just the guy that deals with the
[1:40:10] parents
[1:40:11] [Laughter]
[1:40:16] they yell and scream at me and I go yeah
[1:40:26] get up there to pitch
[1:40:28] it's happened a couple games ago
[1:40:31] kids never played
[1:40:34] but
[1:40:35] it's got a good arm it's pretty pretty
[1:40:38] throws pretty hard
[1:40:41] well
[1:40:43] it's a whole lot different throwing
[1:40:47] in the bullpen
[1:40:48] practicing
[1:40:50] than it is when you're in the game
[1:40:55] now follow me
[1:40:58] so this kid gets up there
[1:41:00] ball
[1:41:02] ball
[1:41:07] take your base
[1:41:11] and he's looking over at me
[1:41:15] that's a lie I I'm never like that
[1:41:18] anymore
[1:41:23] it's pitch
[1:41:27] ball
[1:41:31] so this guy loads the bases
[1:41:34] and by this time he's going take me out
[1:41:37] coach
[1:41:42] take me out please
[1:41:48] so I have to go out to the mound and
[1:41:50] I've had this speech with more than one
[1:41:51] picture
[1:41:56] I look him in the face
[1:41:58] and I said I'm not taking you out
[1:42:00] coach I'm through I'm walking everybody
[1:42:06] you're a pitcher
[1:42:08] I'm walking you're a pitcher
[1:42:12] but I'm not throwing very many strikes
[1:42:15] you're a pitcher
[1:42:17] do you think I'd put somebody who wasn't
[1:42:20] a pitcher on this mound
[1:42:23] do you think I'd put somebody there
[1:42:26] that I thought couldn't do it
[1:42:31] do you think that I'm going to put you
[1:42:34] just to embarrass you
[1:42:38] but coach I can't I said
[1:42:42] do you think I know know what I'm doing
[1:42:49] then I point to the Oakland do you think
[1:42:51] they don't know what they're doing
[1:42:55] are you questioning our decision making
[1:42:58] you are a pitch
[1:43:03] a pit Go Let It Go
[1:43:07] once they get out of their own head
[1:43:10] once they can settle back down
[1:43:14] they start throwing strikes
[1:43:17] once they start recognizing who they are
[1:43:19] once they start recognizing they just go
[1:43:22] and they throw the ball
[1:43:31] so sometimes
[1:43:36] coach comes up to the mound
[1:43:40] and you feel like you're just
[1:43:43] walking everybody
[1:43:47] you cannot seem to hit the target
[1:43:51] what a sin
[1:43:54] missing the target
[1:43:56] missing the mark
[1:44:01] and you can't seem to settle in
[1:44:06] and you've got all this doubt and all
[1:44:09] this fear
[1:44:11] and all these questions
[1:44:17] so God has to come down
[1:44:21] Brothers if you come
[1:44:23] time's up
[1:44:26] so God comes down
[1:44:31] and he whispers in your ear
[1:44:35] you are the wow
[1:44:40] you are my bride
[1:44:45] you are
[1:44:50] the one
[1:44:53] that I've placed
[1:44:55] lady I see
[1:45:03] you've got a special place
[1:45:07] in this last day
[1:45:09] and I trust you
[1:45:11] wait a minute but John I thought you
[1:45:13] said it was about trusting God
[1:45:15] it is
[1:45:17] but he's got to trust you too
[1:45:19] otherwise he wouldn't have put you here
[1:45:21] right
[1:45:24] are you questioning what God has done
[1:45:28] are you questioning what God has called
[1:45:30] you to
[1:45:36] I got the scripture here but you know
[1:45:38] the the the the the madman of Galleria
[1:45:40] right
[1:45:42] after God cast all those Devils out or
[1:45:45] Jesus cast all those Devils out put in
[1:45:47] his wife you know he wanted to follow
[1:45:49] Jesus
[1:45:54] but that wasn't the position God put him
[1:45:56] in
[1:45:57] he said I need you here witnessing here
[1:46:00] right now
[1:46:02] maybe you're not here behind the desk
[1:46:14] maybe you're at school
[1:46:19] even homeschool

[1:46:33] maybe you're like Paul and giving out
[1:46:34] money like crazy these loans
[1:46:37] it doesn't matter
[1:46:49] you are the wow
[1:46:53] but a little Evan
[1:46:55] a little doubt a little fear
[1:46:58] a few balls and you're starting to doubt
[1:47:01] Where You Are
[1:47:03] you're starting to doubt Who You Are

[1:47:37] right where God put us

[1:47:47] you are capable
[1:47:53] trust him
[1:47:54] because he's trusting you

[1:48:01] over and over and over again
[1:48:05] look unto Jesus
[1:48:10] you can question a lot of things
