[25:29] and that's the truth
[25:32] i tell you friends it's just incredible
[25:34] and
[25:35] almost unbelievable from week to week
[25:38] the things that are happening
[25:39] in our nation and our world
[25:43] i'm so glad that our hope is not in
[25:46] anything less
[25:47] than the lord jesus and his mercy amen
[25:51] where would we be brother darrell and i
[25:52] was talking about it before the services
[25:54] but the dawning word would be be if one
[25:56] trust the lord i said like everybody
[25:58] else out here
[25:59] nuts just nuts that's all you can say
[26:03] thank god for his mercy you can imagine
[26:07] since monday
[26:10] over 1250 rockets
[26:14] have landed in israel by now it's even
[26:17] more than that that was of today the
[26:20] last
[26:21] report that i've heard of it so by now
[26:23] it's
[26:24] probably hundreds of more
[26:27] and yet some of the people in our nation
[26:30] are condemning them for defending
[26:33] themselves
[26:34] we've got congressmen we've got senators
[26:37] we've got
[26:38] so be like somebody you go home and
[26:40] somebody's robbed your house and they're
[26:42] eating your taters and eating your
[26:43] maters and sleeping in your bed and you
[26:45] go in and grab out a bald bed or a mixer
[26:48] or
[26:48] whatever you've got and say hey get out
[26:50] of here and people in your neighborhood
[26:52] say well rosa matthew you're some mean
[26:53] you're so rotten jim babe you'd run that
[26:55] thief out of your house
[26:58] you look at it in the natural sense of
[26:59] israel trying to defend their place
[27:02] and you look at the bride we're under a
[27:04] barrage as well
[27:07] a barrage of missiles and rockets from
[27:10] satan of sickness
[27:11] and worry and frustration and all kinds
[27:14] of things
[27:16] but we know god has his eye on his
[27:19] promised people
[27:21] as he does the nation of israel so does
[27:23] he his wife
[27:25] does he stop all the rockets no israel
[27:27] has what they call the
[27:29] iron dome and they're able to stop many
[27:31] many of them but
[27:32] they don't stomp them all we've got more
[27:34] than an iron dome
[27:36] we've got the blood and the mercy of god
[27:38] and the love of god
[27:39] but even with that he doesn't stop all
[27:42] the
[27:42] onslaught of hell but we know when he
[27:45] allows them to come through
[27:47] it's for our good amen aren't you glad
[27:50] praise the lord gracious and that in the
[27:52] name of the lord certainly privileged
[27:54] for us to be
[27:55] gathered together again tonight turn
[27:57] with him if you would in saint john
[27:59] chapter 3
[28:00] verse 19.
[28:03] we'll read verses 19 through 21
[28:07] we've been speaking about getting into
[28:09] the spirit i think this is about
[28:11] part 33 maybe something like that
[28:14] and really it boils down to two things
[28:18] the influences of two kings
[28:21] it's actually a tale of two kings
[28:25] one is the king of darkness king of lies
[28:28] king of deceit the other is the king of
[28:31] light
[28:32] king of peace king of deliverance he is
[28:35] our
[28:35] goel or our shalom
[28:39] and it comes to this simple simple thing
[28:42] light
[28:43] and darkness fighting they fight in our
[28:45] bodies
[28:46] they fight in their homes they fight in
[28:49] our church
[28:50] and our world but we have the promise
[28:53] light will prevail so mention to you i
[28:57] think last weekend when we read this
[28:58] earliest wednesday the scripture that
[29:00] john 3 16 is probably one of the most
[29:02] famous scriptures in the bible
[29:04] but i wonder sometimes how many people
[29:06] know john
[29:08] 3 19. you see people rejoice
[29:11] because of john 3 16 but they don't
[29:14] realize
[29:15] the consequence of when you turn down
[29:18] verse 16
[29:20] then you have to deal with verse 19.
[29:23] and this is the same lord jesus that
[29:25] said god so loved the world that he gave
[29:27] his only begotten son
[29:29] the same lord jesus said this
[29:32] and this is the condemnation
[29:35] that light is coming to the world
[29:39] and men loved darkness rather
[29:43] than light because their deeds
[29:46] were evil now bring it down to america
[29:49] this is the condemnation that light
[29:53] has struck the nation of america but the
[29:56] majority of americans
[29:58] love darkness rather than light because
[30:01] their deeds were evil
[30:03] and now our nation is turned into
[30:06] hell the democrats will never bring it
[30:10] out
[30:11] the republicans will never bring it out
[30:13] she's finished
[30:14] [Music]
[30:16] that's right for everyone that
[30:20] doeth evil hateth light
[30:24] now here's the master himself and he
[30:27] certainly of anyone would know how to
[30:30] word this
[30:31] in such a way that would be just and
[30:34] true and i want you to notice in the way
[30:37] that he
[30:38] deals with these next two verses for
[30:40] everyone in verse 20
[30:42] that doeth evil hateth light now he does
[30:45] not make excuse for them and say
[30:48] well really it's because they don't
[30:49] understand they really just don't see it
[30:53] if they saw it then they would do better
[30:55] he doesn't even
[30:56] approach it that way but he approaches
[30:59] it
[30:59] from the destiny of the soul
[31:02] or the darkness the everlasting chains
[31:05] of darkness that permeate
[31:07] from the souls of some that will never
[31:11] be quickened and notice how he places
[31:13] them categorically
[31:15] as if though they've already been judged
[31:16] for every one
[31:18] that does evil ongoing it's present
[31:21] tense and as a matter of fact
[31:23] many of them will never stop it everyone
[31:25] that does evil
[31:27] hate us so if they do us evil they hate
[31:30] us
[31:31] light they cannot just do evil and say
[31:33] well
[31:34] you know i really don't want to be a
[31:35] christian i really don't believe that
[31:37] word but
[31:37] you know i'm just going to kind of leave
[31:38] them people don't know if they do
[31:40] evil they hate lying always i know some
[31:42] good people and they don't never say
[31:44] nuts and
[31:44] only reason they don't because you ain't
[31:46] never crossed them right
[31:48] some of your friends you don't ever
[31:49] really lay the truths out there so you
[31:51] don't know what attitude they're going
[31:52] to have
[31:54] that's right but if they're ever exposed
[31:56] to light and they're of darkness
[31:58] they will have this darkness attitude
[32:01] for everyone that does evil
[32:03] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[32:06] light notice
[32:08] it's not possible that they will they
[32:10] will
[32:11] not they will not no
[32:15] never impossible no
[32:18] no hope
[32:22] friends we're dealing with many many
[32:24] people in this age
[32:25] that our souls in prison
[32:29] their souls are held in chains of
[32:32] darkness
[32:33] for everyone that does evil hateth the
[32:35] light neither
[32:36] come us to the light
[32:40] lest his deeds should be reproved
[32:44] now notice and then on the other side he
[32:46] says
[32:48] but he that does truth cometh
[32:52] to the light how in the world can
[32:56] a person do truth without seeing light
[32:59] and it shows the graduation of light and
[33:03] the way that god deals
[33:04] even with the elect but it still comes
[33:07] back
[33:08] to do us what you do what you don't do
[33:11] notice jesus identifies both groups by
[33:15] do us so they that do us evil in verse
[33:18] 21
[33:19] he that does truths cometh to light now
[33:23] you don't come to light
[33:24] first read your bible he don't come to
[33:27] light first
[33:28] something begins to move on him he's
[33:30] from
[33:31] another land
[33:35] but he that does truth cometh to light
[33:38] that his deeds
[33:39] may be made manifest that they are
[33:41] wrought
[33:42] in god now let me read you this
[33:44] involvement gilead 1959
[33:47] cleveland tennessee our spirits
[33:50] has been born from above
[33:54] and in that land glory to god
[33:59] where we come from
[34:03] oh my god in that land
[34:07] where we come from
[34:11] the nature and the habits of that land
[34:15] is holiness cleanliness
[34:19] godliness if the spirit
[34:22] of that land moves into
[34:26] us then this land
[34:29] is strange to us
[34:34] might as well say amen and go home it's
[34:35] been good to be in the house of the lord
[34:38] this is it friends in simple terms it's
[34:41] the spirit
[34:42] of two lands light and darkness the
[34:45] spirit
[34:46] of two kings so if in that land where we
[34:49] come from the nature
[34:51] and the habits of that land is holiness
[34:54] cleanliness
[34:55] godliness if the spirit of that land
[34:59] moves into us then this
[35:02] land is strange to us
[35:05] because your soul and your spirit
[35:08] motivates
[35:09] you it makes you what you
[35:12] are and you'll never be able to join
[35:16] churches and get that out of you you'll
[35:19] still be a
[35:20] church member and make fun of people
[35:23] who preach against such immorals
[35:28] you know why you feel different tonight
[35:31] because the spirit
[35:32] of that land is living in you
[35:36] you know while the world hates you the
[35:38] spirit of this land
[35:40] lives in them i may like to be
[35:43] remembered tonight as we pray
[35:46] let's bow our heads together if you
[35:48] would
[35:50] lord it could not be said in more
[35:52] powerful profound terms i think
[35:56] so great yet so simple
[36:00] that it's the spirit of that land where
[36:03] we come from
[36:05] the very reason judas lived the way he
[36:09] did
[36:11] in the realm of deception
[36:14] and he must have been quite a deceiver
[36:18] because according to what we're able to
[36:21] read in the gospels
[36:23] there was not one of those elected
[36:27] apostles ever picked up
[36:30] anything about him that was negative
[36:34] in so much that when you said one of you
[36:38] is going to betray me
[36:40] they questioned themselves before they
[36:43] even
[36:44] questioned him is it i is it i
[36:48] is it i they went around the table
[36:52] because he was so close
[36:55] to the original of what they could see
[36:58] without the holy ghost
[36:59] they picked up not one thing but
[37:02] you knew all along who the betrayer was
[37:08] but once they received the holy ghost
[37:10] then they looked back
[37:12] and they began to see what their carnal
[37:14] eyes
[37:15] could not see he was of
[37:18] another land lord god i pray that you'd
[37:22] help each of us tonight
[37:24] may we lord as your people come under
[37:28] the
[37:28] influence not so much of this land
[37:32] but that land we are from
[37:35] that land is a land of holiness
[37:38] purity righteousness godliness
[37:42] forgiveness divine nature
[37:46] foreknowledge predestination
[37:49] a land of election a land
[37:53] of eternal life father may our
[37:56] spirits our souls be under the
[38:00] influence of that land for it is a land
[38:04] of light speak to us tonight father we
[38:08] pray
[38:08] we ask for illumination in the name of
[38:12] the lord jesus
[38:13] and we all say amen
[38:16] god bless you you may be seated
[38:24] you see no matter how much the lord
[38:26] jesus
[38:27] would have ever tried to preach
[38:31] and convert judas
[38:34] he could have never been converted
[38:37] he was baptized in water
[38:40] by the lord jesus like the rest of the
[38:43] apostles
[38:44] as a matter of fact the prophet tells us
[38:46] that
[38:47] when judas got baptized
[38:50] the devil got baptized
[38:54] so the devil must have wanted to know
[38:58] how it feels to be baptized
[39:02] in water so he
[39:06] allowed himself to be inside
[39:09] judah's body in such a way that
[39:13] when the lord jesus would have taken
[39:16] them down
[39:17] now there was much water in salim
[39:21] there was water and genocide there was
[39:24] water of course in the jordan so there
[39:27] was various
[39:28] places that they could have baptized
[39:32] and satan wanted to know himself
[39:35] you know what i think i'd like to get
[39:38] baptized today
[39:41] i hear jesus is going to baptize his
[39:45] disciples
[39:46] i think i'll let him baptize me
[39:51] you see it's not enough when we take
[39:54] people down in this pool up here
[39:57] it's not enough for them to come up and
[39:59] cry and say
[40:01] i'm sorry i want to be a better person
[40:04] they've got to be a new person
[40:07] so satan allowed himself to go
[40:11] in to this first step
[40:14] second step but he could not go into the
[40:18] changing
[40:19] of the soul to receive the baptism
[40:23] of the holy ghost and the soul he
[40:25] accident went farther
[40:27] in this day than he went in the day
[40:31] of judas iscariot in so much that
[40:35] satan in the form
[40:38] into the form of arthur godfrey
[40:42] elvis presley pentecostal preachers
[40:47] message preachers and other false
[40:50] anointed ones instruments that satan
[40:54] in their soul would be able to
[40:56] experience the baptism
[40:59] of the holy ghost in their spirit
[41:03] it was even closer in this day
[41:06] than it was when judas was here himself
[41:10] one of the mysteries
[41:11] of the end time that people can have the
[41:14] baptism
[41:15] of the holy ghost every hour of their
[41:18] life
[41:19] and still die lost and go to hell
[41:23] well praise the lord what a good way to
[41:26] start out the meeting tonight
[41:27] you see a person can have it in their
[41:30] spirit
[41:31] talk in genuine tongues have genuine
[41:34] gifts even stand up and preach
[41:37] and still be lost because they're lost
[41:40] from the soul
[41:41] out not the spirit so
[41:44] judas went went into the
[41:47] depths of god understood mysteries
[41:50] a partaker of the original ministry
[41:54] divinely imparted to him by the lord
[41:57] jesus himself
[41:58] his gifts were not inferior his
[42:01] understanding
[42:03] was not inferior so if you'd have been
[42:05] around peter james john
[42:07] the men of those day hearing them talk
[42:09] about the revelations of god the light
[42:11] that illuminated them
[42:12] judas would have been right there no
[42:13] doubt he could have talked about
[42:15] what the great things was that they
[42:17] understood whenever they come back
[42:19] rejoicing judas come right back and said
[42:21] i cast out devils in your name i heal
[42:24] the sick in your name you say how in the
[42:26] world
[42:26] could he have done that being a devil it
[42:29] was by
[42:30] the two greek words that was used in the
[42:32] new testament
[42:34] for our english word power one of them
[42:37] is excusia and the other is
[42:40] dunamis excusa is a delegated
[42:44] authority by one who has power
[42:48] to give you you you you you me whoever
[42:51] it is
[42:51] authority to do certain things but it
[42:54] has nothing to do
[42:56] with your own innate nature excusa
[43:00] would be similar would say to a police
[43:02] officer
[43:03] or a sheriff or a deputy or a state
[43:06] trooper
[43:07] that would be given power and authority
[43:10] to pull you and i
[43:11] over to write us a ticket to impound our
[43:14] car
[43:14] to put handcuffs on us whatever more
[43:17] because they've been given that type
[43:19] of power but it really has nothing to do
[43:22] with how much they weigh
[43:24] they might be as oh my they might be a
[43:26] little guy there might be a heavyset guy
[43:28] they might be brown yellow has nothing
[43:31] to do with the race
[43:32] the gender it is a delegated authority
[43:36] the lord jesus sent out the apostles not
[43:39] by
[43:39] dunamis by inherit nature but rather by
[43:43] excusa which was a delegated power
[43:46] you see he knew that satan would fall
[43:49] from the beginning
[43:50] so he separated his logos
[43:53] from the dunamis being on the logos
[43:56] itself
[43:57] if not then satan once the logos was
[44:00] written in word form
[44:01] anybody that could have full access to
[44:04] the power of god
[44:06] all that had to do is memorize the word
[44:09] then with the word would come the
[44:11] dunamis
[44:12] so it separates the invigorating power
[44:16] of the livelihood of the power of god
[44:19] away from the written word so it has the
[44:22] word written
[44:22] people memorize it they quote it and
[44:25] they even break into a certain element
[44:27] of it to make it live
[44:28] but it does not make it rhema word
[44:31] until the anointing of the hour falls on
[44:34] that lugos
[44:35] and then it quickens it and satan never
[44:37] has access to that
[44:40] so judas was able by excusa
[44:43] to cast out devils heal the sick so he
[44:46] sent them out to the two we don't know
[44:47] who went with judas
[44:48] the bible doesn't really say but judas
[44:51] had power to heal the sick
[44:52] perform miracles cast out devils
[44:55] whatever more like a trooper
[44:56] or say police or whatever more by that
[44:59] authority
[45:00] but he had nothing by innate nature now
[45:03] dunamis is
[45:04] something that comes into the individual
[45:07] as we said it before
[45:08] that we get our word dynamite from this
[45:11] word dunamis
[45:12] so it's something that's from within
[45:14] it's not just a delegated
[45:17] authority that you can do with or
[45:19] without
[45:20] a godly life but dunamis imparts not
[45:24] only
[45:24] power to lay hands on the sick but it
[45:27] imparts
[45:28] power in you to be able to annihilate
[45:31] the very
[45:32] nature of sin that we were born with and
[45:35] look for it it's not enough for us
[45:37] around the message to have excuses we
[45:41] must have
[45:42] dunamis it's not enough for us just to
[45:44] play tapes
[45:45] listen to me don't get mad you can play
[45:48] tapes every day of your life you can
[45:50] keep the tape going
[45:51] on your phone in your house 24 hours a
[45:54] day
[45:54] and be as lost as you can be because the
[45:57] tapes
[45:58] are not the token come on now i know
[46:01] that's contrary to what's being
[46:02] projected in this day
[46:04] you find me where the prophet of god
[46:06] ever said the token or the tapes
[46:08] the prophet said the token is the holy
[46:10] ghost
[46:11] it is that literal life of the lord
[46:13] jesus coming back
[46:15] inside of you and i now in this land
[46:19] that we are from
[46:20] we become baptized or immersed into that
[46:24] land
[46:24] which is christ jesus as i said opening
[46:27] up that
[46:28] is israel is under the barrage even this
[46:30] very hours i'm talking to you
[46:32] of all types of attacks from hamas and
[46:35] from all these other counter-terrorists
[46:37] and things that are going on
[46:38] and what do they want they want them to
[46:40] leave they want
[46:42] their land well look at it spiritually
[46:44] and see the bride of christ
[46:46] around the world has been under a
[46:48] barrage of attacks by satan
[46:50] in the last year so more than ever
[46:53] before
[46:54] why he wants you to forsake your land
[46:57] and say well i can't do it no more it
[46:59] ain't worth the fight no more
[47:01] i can't deal with this sickness this out
[47:03] the other but if you're a real seed of
[47:05] abraham
[47:06] you're going to stay on your land and
[47:08] say you devil i'm warning you
[47:10] right now you're trespassing and lord
[47:12] friend when god brings a deliverance for
[47:15] you
[47:16] whether it's a healing or a deliverance
[47:18] of a besetting sin whatever it is
[47:20] don't become confused or discouraged
[47:23] whenever the
[47:24] devil will come right back and try to
[47:26] take that land away from you
[47:28] or bring that same sickness or that same
[47:31] besetting sin
[47:32] and you find yourself being tempted by
[47:35] the very same thing
[47:36] that god delivered you from and you
[47:38] think what in the world's going on
[47:40] nothing going on
[47:41] it's the devil that's trying to give you
[47:43] back that sickness
[47:45] but you need to stand there look if
[47:47] netanyahu could stand there
[47:49] and warn the palestinians and say look
[47:51] you all keep coming
[47:53] i'm warning you now we're going to take
[47:55] this land and when we do
[47:57] we're going to push you farther back
[47:59] than you are now
[48:01] and we are not going to give you this
[48:03] land i think we need to serve the devil
[48:05] that notice tonight for those of you
[48:08] that are battling sickness or oppression
[48:10] or financial straits whatever it is in
[48:12] your home you need to give that devil a
[48:15] warning
[48:15] and say look you better get back because
[48:18] i'm giving you a warning right now
[48:20] as the son of god as a daughter of god
[48:23] i'm going to push against you and i'm
[48:25] going to push and i'm going to push
[48:26] and what i take i am not giving back
[48:30] so you better get gone while the
[48:32] getting's good because i'm not the
[48:34] majority
[48:35] but jesus in me are the majority
[48:39] and he's promised me healing he's
[48:41] promised me deliverance he's promised me
[48:43] peace
[48:44] he's promised me power whatever i need
[48:47] from my journey
[48:48] i've got a whole checkbook praise god
[48:51] made out in my name
[48:52] all i've got to do is sign it and claim
[48:54] the promise
[48:57] but will you have to fight you will
[48:59] you'll have to fight to get it and
[49:01] you'll have to fight to keep it but as
[49:03] children of abraham
[49:05] that's what we do that's who we are
[49:08] it's never been the way of the children
[49:10] of god to have
[49:12] everything handed to him on a silver
[49:14] platter daniel
[49:15] was not handed to him shout right me
[49:17] shack in a bid to go
[49:19] their victory was not handed to them you
[49:21] imagine they had to buy it so do we
[49:24] have to battle it was not handed to the
[49:26] prophet of god
[49:27] he had to fight and the prophet said
[49:29] when you get saved it's a fight from the
[49:31] time you get saved
[49:32] until the day you die but we are willing
[49:35] to accept every challenge that satan
[49:38] brings
[49:38] against us why because we are not
[49:41] fighting for ourselves
[49:43] we are not fighting for our agenda our
[49:45] agenda is
[49:46] of the kingdom of god our nature is of
[49:49] the kingdom of god
[49:51] our plan is of the kingdom of god we are
[49:54] not our own we belong to him therefore
[49:58] what he wants us to do is what we will
[50:01] do
[50:02] we will take our land we will fight for
[50:04] our land
[50:05] and we will keep our land
[50:17] hallelujah praise the lord
[50:21] and of course the devil will try to do
[50:23] you like some of the left-leaning and
[50:25] politicians
[50:26] in america want to do israel shame on
[50:28] you all for defending your land
[50:30] shame on you all for doing this shame on
[50:33] you all for preaching this and preaching
[50:35] that you ain't shaming
[50:36] us this is our land this is our
[50:39] territory
[50:40] this is our rights as the people of god
[50:43] those who have left this message have
[50:45] given up their land
[50:46] they want to dress the way they want to
[50:48] just act the way they want to
[50:50] let them do so but i'm not doing it
[50:53] that's not my land my land is a land of
[50:56] holiness
[50:57] a land of righteousness amen a land of
[51:00] purity a land of godliness
[51:02] look friend our land is a land of
[51:04] healing it is a land of miracles
[51:07] it is a land of supernatural power of
[51:10] god
[51:11] it is a land of angelic oh praise god
[51:15] it is a land of angelic visitation
[51:18] as a son or daughter of god you have a
[51:21] right to angels visiting your home
[51:23] [Applause]
[51:33] so it's up to us we can go down in our
[51:37] bomb shelters and
[51:38] hide under the bunker oh devil ease up
[51:42] ease up ease up
[51:44] oh my i remember years ago when i
[51:47] preached on demonology and my
[51:51] it's been several several years ago but
[51:54] all hell all hell
[51:58] seemed like it broke loose against our
[52:00] church
[52:01] so many people started fighting all
[52:04] types of sicknesses
[52:05] all time it was absolutely unbelievable
[52:09] and one day when i was in prayer and i
[52:11] was waiting on the lord and just
[52:13] i pray and then i wait brother baby said
[52:15] the problem is when we pray we do all
[52:16] the talking and he said we ought to pray
[52:19] and then listen for a while and be quiet
[52:21] so i waited and i waited on the lord and
[52:24] the lord wouldn't tell me nothing
[52:26] the lord was really silent and i've
[52:28] learned that whenever god's silent
[52:30] satan sure loves them opportunities
[52:33] then he'll come to you and he'll go to
[52:35] try to talking to you
[52:37] so i prayed and i talked to the lord and
[52:39] i waited on the lord and then i
[52:40] i just got signed a little bit and said
[52:42] well lord i'm gonna let you talk
[52:44] and the lord didn't say nothing well i
[52:46] just laid there on my face and laid
[52:47] there for a bit
[52:48] and the lord said nothing well old
[52:51] blabber mouse come up
[52:54] and he said i'll tell you what i'll do
[52:57] i'll make a deal with you
[52:59] you let up on me
[53:02] and i'll let up on the church
[53:07] i'm going to tell you something friends
[53:09] you think
[53:10] that preaching singing worshiping
[53:14] obeying the word of god does not
[53:17] absolutely destroy satan's kingdom
[53:22] that satan who who am i some little
[53:25] video spindly
[53:26] to before a preacher that does nothing
[53:28] done nothing amounted to nothing in life
[53:32] but demons out of hell would want to
[53:35] make a deal with you
[53:39] wonder why i didn't go to biden or trump
[53:41] or go to putin
[53:43] or some great person you know why we
[53:45] call them great because we don't know
[53:47] what greatness
[53:48] is i'll tell you who's great
[53:51] it's a sign of god down on their knees
[53:54] not just a preacher now
[53:55] but somebody that knows how to bombard
[53:58] heaven with prayers
[54:00] anointed by the spirit of god
[54:03] oh my when i heard that voice oh it's
[54:06] you know as a human being and say oh my
[54:09] i mean i
[54:10] just laid there brother weston as i
[54:12] heard that
[54:13] and something rose within me some of
[54:15] y'all probably remember me telling this
[54:17] years ago
[54:18] and something rose was in me and i said
[54:21] satan i will not let up on you
[54:24] as a matter of fact i'll preach more god
[54:27] gives me the more i'll preach it
[54:29] and the longer i'll preach it i'll make
[54:31] this series last as long as the holy
[54:34] ghost gives me
[54:35] unction now listen friend you realize
[54:38] what we are coming against that it's not
[54:41] against these
[54:42] people i hear so much it's not against
[54:44] this man or that woman or this church or
[54:47] that church
[54:47] but it is powers of darkness that we
[54:50] are warring against and they want to be
[54:54] able to take
[54:55] everything they can away from us that
[54:57] the lord jesus has given to us
[54:59] i'm sure you feel the same way as i do i
[55:02] don't want anything that does not belong
[55:04] to me
[55:04] i don't want something that belongs to
[55:06] someone else whether it comes to
[55:08] preaching whatever more i want only what
[55:11] god wants for me that's all
[55:13] but i do want what has my name on it
[55:16] i do want what has my name on it now if
[55:19] it's got my name on it
[55:20] i'm not going to fight you over my
[55:22] prison but i am going to take it away
[55:24] from you if you've got it
[55:25] why because it belongs to me and if he
[55:28] then belongs to me
[55:29] i want it deliverance belongs to me it's
[55:31] got my name it's got the package right
[55:33] there and it said to donny from jesus
[55:35] well guess what
[55:36] i'm gonna get that package i might be
[55:39] the last one to get it but it's got my
[55:41] name on it and that's the way you need
[55:43] to do the promises of god
[55:44] when they've got your name on them you
[55:46] stand right there i don't care what hell
[55:48] says
[55:49] and if hell came back and said i'm going
[55:51] to do this other you stand there toe to
[55:53] toe
[55:54] and said there's one thing you ought to
[55:56] know i know by now
[55:58] you are a liar
[56:01] you're a liar satan and i do not believe
[56:04] you
[56:04] so get back to hell and take your box of
[56:08] rattlesnakes back with you
[56:16] hallelujah you see it's the spirit of
[56:19] the land
[56:20] that refrain don't you understand what
[56:22] the lord is trying to bring to his
[56:24] people in this hour
[56:25] but brother dawn it's such struggles i
[56:27] know that i realize it's such struggles
[56:30] but our god is victorious oh my right in
[56:33] the midst of such
[56:34] difficult times it's during such times
[56:37] that his profound mercy
[56:39] and grace is able to anoint his people
[56:42] and their faith rise to a level
[56:44] that surprises them when it doesn't why
[56:46] because it's not just them
[56:48] it's him doing it
[56:50] [Music]
[56:51] let's pick up again what was looking at
[56:53] wednesday night ii corinthians 3 17.
[56:56] now the lord is that spirit boy i'll
[56:59] tell you one thing this used to be one
[57:01] of my favorite scriptures in pentecost
[57:03] oh i love this scripture and i was
[57:05] ignorant about it but i loved it
[57:08] i sure love it now now the lord is that
[57:10] spirit and what the spirit of the lord
[57:12] is their liberty now that was one of our
[57:13] favorite shouting quotes in pentecost
[57:16] those of you that was in pentecost you
[57:17] know what i'm saying that boy we get up
[57:19] here hallelujah
[57:21] oh by the spirit of the lord is our
[57:22] liberty oh but get the music going and
[57:25] everybody hallelujah
[57:26] there's liberty well now i look back and
[57:28] realize a lot of that was just emotional
[57:29] work up by the music
[57:31] because a lot of them people that was
[57:33] shouting really didn't have no liberty
[57:34] in their life because it's bound by sin
[57:37] so now we look at it in a total
[57:39] different light
[57:40] that where the spirit of the lord is
[57:44] there is liberty liberty to do what do
[57:47] whatever you want to do
[57:48] no you still ain't saved yet now notice
[57:51] what this
[57:52] liberty leads to now this where the
[57:55] spirit of the lord is there
[57:56] is liberty but we all with
[57:59] open face beholding as in a glass the
[58:03] glory of the lord now it
[58:04] absolutely marvels me even i think about
[58:06] myself has been the pentecostal preacher
[58:08] and how many times i quoted this other
[58:10] verse
[58:11] about whether it was liberty but i don't
[58:13] remember quoting verse 18 very often at
[58:15] all
[58:16] because i didn't have an open fail i
[58:18] didn't have an open face
[58:20] i did not have a mirror to look into so
[58:23] i just shouted over the above verse
[58:25] and shouted over the top of verse 18
[58:27] because i didn't understand it
[58:28] the first 17 made me shout out to be
[58:30] having a spell tonight at verse 18
[58:32] shouldn't you
[58:33] now think of it but we all with open
[58:36] face to unveil or uncover
[58:40] by drawing back a veil we
[58:43] always open face beholding us
[58:46] in a glass which is already last
[58:49] wednesday night
[58:50] is not a clear glass but rather a mirror
[58:53] to show in a mirror to look at oneself
[58:56] in a mirror to behold oneself
[59:00] in a mirror but how strange that paul
[59:02] conveys this
[59:03] with open face beholding us in a mirror
[59:08] the glory of the lord so here we've got
[59:12] the mirror of god
[59:13] in our hands and we're looking and we're
[59:16] supposed to see ourself but instead
[59:20] we see the glory of the lord now
[59:23] remember the mirrors of this ancient
[59:25] times
[59:25] were a burnished type of metal so they
[59:28] would polish it really bright
[59:30] unlike our mirrors today and whenever
[59:32] the looker
[59:33] if it was outside or even inside the
[59:35] house and the light would catch it real
[59:38] bright
[59:38] it would actually hit the burnished
[59:40] metal and it would bend it
[59:42] and refract it and it would come right
[59:44] back and shine upon the face of it it
[59:47] would actually blind you
[59:48] it would actually blind you you could
[59:51] take and bend it to where it would come
[59:52] back
[59:53] and if you looked at it long enough it
[59:55] would put your eyes out
[59:57] because it was so direct so here
[1:00:00] paul says that we with the veil taken
[1:00:02] off of our face
[1:00:04] and we're looking into the mirror of
[1:00:06] god's word
[1:00:07] and we begin to see he said the glory of
[1:00:11] the lord changed into the same
[1:00:15] image from glory to glory even as by the
[1:00:19] spirit
[1:00:20] of the lord so the gradual
[1:00:23] motion of the change into this
[1:00:26] image is expressed by the terms that he
[1:00:28] used
[1:00:29] when he said changed into the same
[1:00:32] image so the present tense implies a
[1:00:35] gradual
[1:00:36] transfiguration which is what the word
[1:00:38] change is
[1:00:39] a gradual transfiguration both mystical
[1:00:43] and spiritual and it is produced while
[1:00:46] we
[1:00:46] are contemplating christ now satan broke
[1:00:50] into the same thing
[1:00:51] and it is the power of spiritual
[1:00:54] assimilation
[1:00:55] so the world looks at all of these
[1:00:58] things that satan gives them
[1:01:00] and they look at pornography on their
[1:01:01] phones and they look at
[1:01:03] all these types of movies and they look
[1:01:05] at all the stuff that's going on
[1:01:07] in the woke their deal out here all the
[1:01:09] stuff that's happening all around us and
[1:01:11] what do they do
[1:01:12] they assimilate into what they are
[1:01:15] feeding
[1:01:16] upon they actually become that and the
[1:01:19] word assimilate is to process
[1:01:22] of the process of becoming a part
[1:01:25] or making someone become a part
[1:01:29] of a group country or society
[1:01:32] so the sphere of darkness is actually
[1:01:35] projecting all of these images that
[1:01:38] people don't know if they're man or
[1:01:40] their woman
[1:01:40] so you know the common practice among
[1:01:42] some of the people especially the
[1:01:44] left-leaning and the progressives and
[1:01:45] the liberals
[1:01:46] is that whenever they have children that
[1:01:48] anymore they don't check
[1:01:50] on the birth certificate whether it's
[1:01:52] male or female
[1:01:54] they leave that open so the child
[1:01:57] can pick which one it wants to be
[1:02:02] praise the lord in australia they're
[1:02:05] fixing to pass laws to where if someone
[1:02:07] is homosexual and they give their heart
[1:02:10] to the lord
[1:02:11] and they want help and they would seek
[1:02:14] counsel of the preacher not that the
[1:02:15] preacher
[1:02:16] tries to push it on them but they
[1:02:19] themselves
[1:02:20] ask for help that they need to be
[1:02:24] ministered to to break away from these
[1:02:26] tendencies
[1:02:27] the man can be arrested and canada our
[1:02:31] neighbor to the north
[1:02:33] they're trying to pass the legislation
[1:02:35] that either mothers and fathers
[1:02:37] cannot talk to their children if their
[1:02:40] children if it's a girl she wants to be
[1:02:42] a boy or vice versa
[1:02:43] that they will imprison the parents of
[1:02:46] those kids if they try to
[1:02:49] convert them now what's happening then
[1:02:52] the laws of sodomy
[1:02:54] are being put before the people come on
[1:02:57] children say amen
[1:02:58] and what is it doing assimilating into
[1:03:02] sodomites and the last days the prophecy
[1:03:05] as it was in the days of sodom thus
[1:03:08] shall it be
[1:03:09] in the day when the son of man is being
[1:03:12] revealed
[1:03:13] so there is a great power both positive
[1:03:15] and negative
[1:03:16] in assimilation notice this in joshua
[1:03:20] chapter 1 verse 8
[1:03:21] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:03:24] out of thy mouth
[1:03:25] but thou shalt meditate meditate
[1:03:29] therein day and night now okay just in
[1:03:32] case you're wondering
[1:03:33] i do believe in the power of meditation
[1:03:37] but not transcendental meditation
[1:03:41] but the meditation of a son or daughter
[1:03:43] of god
[1:03:44] on the promises of the word
[1:03:47] i dare say let me adventure here tonight
[1:03:50] and say
[1:03:50] we probably most of us even holy ghost
[1:03:53] filled saints
[1:03:54] do not meditate enough on the good
[1:03:57] things
[1:03:58] of god there is great power
[1:04:01] in meditating notice you notice a person
[1:04:04] that leans toward
[1:04:06] sickness so much and they just talk
[1:04:07] sickness and they oh you know they they
[1:04:10] claim they're sin well my sugar
[1:04:12] and my blood pressure and my this and my
[1:04:15] that what
[1:04:15] were you doing claiming that thing or it
[1:04:18] may be in your body but that don't mean
[1:04:19] that it's yours
[1:04:21] you need to send that thing right back
[1:04:22] where it comes from well my low blood
[1:04:25] my high blood my no blood and my my this
[1:04:28] and my that don't you claim that thing
[1:04:30] the devil will talk you into it and the
[1:04:32] next thing you know it's part of your
[1:04:33] family
[1:04:34] well come on now saints you need to
[1:04:36] meditate and the way you say well
[1:04:38] the doctor says i've got him that the
[1:04:40] symptoms are there
[1:04:41] but by his stripes i am healed i'm going
[1:04:44] to do whatever i've got to do to be able
[1:04:46] to take care of it
[1:04:47] but this ain't my diabetes this ain't my
[1:04:51] cancer this is not my high blood
[1:04:53] pressure
[1:04:54] come on saints why because the power of
[1:04:57] meditation look at people
[1:04:59] that all the time talk about sickness
[1:05:01] and live in the realm of sickness
[1:05:03] and they catch everything coming and
[1:05:05] going and some things that don't come
[1:05:07] and go they catch you too
[1:05:08] and they spend years of their life in
[1:05:11] the realm of sickness
[1:05:12] every time you get around them they've
[1:05:15] got something wrong with them
[1:05:17] and they're all the time dealing with
[1:05:18] this and that and the other it's a
[1:05:20] miracle they live to be past 30
[1:05:23] because they're constantly talking about
[1:05:25] well hallelujah
[1:05:28] my you ought to spend more time
[1:05:29] meditating upon healing
[1:05:31] and upon miracles and upon the goodness
[1:05:34] of god
[1:05:35] instead of thinking of everything all oh
[1:05:37] my they got covered i've got
[1:05:39] i've got a temperature oh lord i've got
[1:05:41] covered oh no no no
[1:05:42] but yet what should we do why sure covet
[1:05:45] is real we know that it is
[1:05:46] but i don't think we should live under
[1:05:48] the fear of it 24 hours a day
[1:05:50] oh god oh god i've got it once oh god
[1:05:52] i'll get it again
[1:05:53] no if it comes again we'll factor it the
[1:05:56] same way we did the other time
[1:05:58] as we do other things but we don't need
[1:06:00] to meditate
[1:06:01] but we've let our smartphones fill our
[1:06:04] minds with so much
[1:06:05] news reports about this and that and the
[1:06:07] other how many of you
[1:06:09] get good reports of healing and miracles
[1:06:12] on your smartphone
[1:06:13] but it's negative this and negative and
[1:06:16] negative something else and you come to
[1:06:18] church and sit there like a bullfrog
[1:06:20] eating buckshot
[1:06:21] and you're as negative and down and low
[1:06:23] as you can be
[1:06:25] and then you wonder why it's your diet
[1:06:28] it's what you're feeding all
[1:06:34] that's why you're feeding on you're not
[1:06:37] meditating on the good
[1:06:38] things of god
[1:06:50] this book of the law
[1:06:53] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[1:06:56] thou
[1:06:56] shalt meditate
[1:07:00] you understand what he's talking about
[1:07:02] here psalms was not included in this
[1:07:05] wasn't yet written proverbs ecclesiastes
[1:07:09] jeremiah nehem zachariah
[1:07:13] zephaniah malachi obadiah
[1:07:16] only five books and what it contained
[1:07:19] thou
[1:07:20] shalt and thou shalt not thou shalt and
[1:07:22] thou shalt not
[1:07:23] thou shalt and thou shalt not
[1:07:28] but there was power in meditating
[1:07:32] on the torah this is why when you see
[1:07:36] the jews
[1:07:37] especially the orthodox and the elder
[1:07:39] orthodox those with their lawn the men
[1:07:41] that's got the little curly deals and
[1:07:43] the hats and all this thing
[1:07:44] and you've seen pictures of them and
[1:07:46] i've seen it also naturally they're
[1:07:48] going to the wailing wall the western
[1:07:50] wall so they have them separate the men
[1:07:51] over on this side
[1:07:52] and they have a wall there and the women
[1:07:54] on the other side and whenever they're
[1:07:56] standing up there
[1:07:57] they're doing this and they're little
[1:07:59] curly deals they're jumping around as
[1:08:01] they do it
[1:08:01] and man i'll tell you what i'm thinking
[1:08:03] oh lord i'm glad i don't have to do that
[1:08:04] i'll be sick on a horse
[1:08:06] they're sinning just like i don't see
[1:08:08] how they even read the book because
[1:08:10] they're jumping back and forth but
[1:08:11] according to the way they
[1:08:12] understand it the psalms in the book
[1:08:15] should bring such excitement to them
[1:08:17] that they can't stand in the same place
[1:08:19] that it ought to bring such joy lord
[1:08:21] have mercy if the law
[1:08:23] does that to a bunch of jews what about
[1:08:25] the covenant of grace to the bride of
[1:08:28] jesus christ
[1:08:33] the book this book of the law shall not
[1:08:35] depart out of thy mouth
[1:08:36] but thou shalt meditate meditate
[1:08:40] therein day and night that thou mayest
[1:08:43] observe to do according to all that is
[1:08:45] written therein
[1:08:46] for then shalt thou make thy way
[1:08:48] prosperous
[1:08:49] and then thou shalt have good
[1:08:53] success i mean he wants to be a
[1:08:57] successful christian
[1:09:00] i talk about how much money is in your
[1:09:01] bank account now i'm talking about being
[1:09:03] successful in god
[1:09:05] notice psalms 1 i love this first psalm
[1:09:08] blessed is the man that walketh not on
[1:09:10] the council of the ungodly
[1:09:12] nor stand us in the way of sinners nor
[1:09:14] sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[1:09:16] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:09:19] lord
[1:09:20] and in his law does he
[1:09:23] meditate day and night
[1:09:28] now don't raise your hands but i wonder
[1:09:30] how many of us
[1:09:32] meditate how much time do we give to
[1:09:35] meditation
[1:09:37] on the good things of god you ever
[1:09:39] watched people i've watched people
[1:09:40] you've heard me say that before and i
[1:09:41] watch people when i go to doctor's
[1:09:43] office in different places
[1:09:44] and you watch the people of this age
[1:09:46] they cannot hardly
[1:09:48] even hit the chair before they've got
[1:09:50] their phone out
[1:09:54] husbands and wives sitting at the dinner
[1:09:56] table in restaurants i just saw it this
[1:09:58] week
[1:09:58] they don't even talk both of them's on
[1:10:01] the smartphone
[1:10:02] two dummies on smartphones
[1:10:06] now what do you think is going to happen
[1:10:07] to their marriage
[1:10:09] that's right do you understand that even
[1:10:11] psychologists and doctors are saying
[1:10:13] that the american people are losing the
[1:10:16] ability to talk
[1:10:20] all they know is snapchat and instagram
[1:10:23] and facebook
[1:10:24] and text they can't even carry on our
[1:10:26] president
[1:10:27] can't even talk
[1:10:30] they know what they're doing keeping
[1:10:32] them cameras away from that dude
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:10:36] or you say poor old father do you want
[1:10:38] your youngans to grow up the same way
[1:10:42] that all they know how to do is use
[1:10:44] their thumbs
[1:10:45] god gave us a mouth to talk
[1:10:49] to praise to worship
[1:10:59] but his law his delight his delight
[1:11:03] his delight is in the law of the lord
[1:11:08] and in his law dost he meditate day and
[1:11:11] night
[1:11:12] all this psalm here psalm 19 14 to me
[1:11:15] oh it's one of one of my favorite let
[1:11:18] the words
[1:11:19] of my mouse and
[1:11:22] the meditation of my heart
[1:11:27] be acceptable in thy
[1:11:30] sight oh lord my strength
[1:11:34] my goal you
[1:11:37] talking about a word how in the world
[1:11:40] could the psalmist david ever say such a
[1:11:42] thing by the west
[1:11:43] that knowing that he only had a law a
[1:11:45] torah
[1:11:46] an animal sacrifice and yet this man is
[1:11:49] praying with the new testament
[1:11:51] understanding this couldn't even
[1:11:53] happen in the old testament because the
[1:11:55] soul is not even converted
[1:11:57] listen let the words of my mouth now
[1:12:00] what david has done if you read this
[1:12:01] verses preceding this david is praying
[1:12:04] about different sins and
[1:12:06] lord keep me for this and keep me from
[1:12:08] that and forgive me for this and then
[1:12:10] david
[1:12:11] comes oh my he comes inward and said now
[1:12:14] lord
[1:12:14] i want you to perform a miracle
[1:12:18] in me
[1:12:22] it was a miracle when he made the
[1:12:24] universe it's a miracle
[1:12:26] when he made life but when he converted
[1:12:30] you
[1:12:31] it was one of his greatest all-time
[1:12:34] miracles cosmic light cosmic dust
[1:12:39] couldn't tell him no
[1:12:40] the planets couldn't say no they
[1:12:43] couldn't wrestle against his will
[1:12:46] but you were born to fight him your
[1:12:49] flesh
[1:12:50] born lost you were born to rebel against
[1:12:53] him
[1:12:54] but he performed a miracle in you praise
[1:12:58] god he performed a miracle in you and
[1:13:01] now you don't fight him no more
[1:13:03] you don't hate him no more you love him
[1:13:06] so much
[1:13:07] you live every day of your life for him
[1:13:09] it is
[1:13:10] a miracle you are
[1:13:14] a miracle
[1:13:19] let the words i hope you don't
[1:13:21] misunderstand me
[1:13:22] man's heart is one of the greatest
[1:13:27] creations of the universe
[1:13:33] it is actually called the crown jewel
[1:13:37] man's heart the crown jewel
[1:13:41] of the universe
[1:13:46] i know some of you think your head is
[1:13:47] where it's all at uh-uh
[1:13:50] the devil chose your head
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:54] god chose your heart
[1:14:00] he used eve's head in the garden of eden
[1:14:03] but god chose man's heart it is one of
[1:14:06] the greatest creations
[1:14:08] of almighty god the crown jewel
[1:14:12] of the universe from the heart oh and
[1:14:15] the heart can be so wicked
[1:14:17] it can be so vile and jeremiah said who
[1:14:19] can knows the heart
[1:14:21] but when god comes in i'm talking about
[1:14:24] these muscles and you're bumping
[1:14:25] i'm talking about that something in you
[1:14:27] that animation
[1:14:28] that animation amen not the muscle the
[1:14:32] door that beats and beats and beats
[1:14:34] but that's something inside of you the
[1:14:35] new fish your soul
[1:14:39] what's this let the words of my mouth
[1:14:44] in the meditation of my heart
[1:14:49] let the words of my mouth and the
[1:14:52] meditation
[1:14:54] of my crown jewel now watch how he does
[1:14:57] this
[1:14:58] let it be acceptable he's taking
[1:15:02] a man and joining the thoughts
[1:15:05] that come from the heart and spoken out
[1:15:09] of his lips
[1:15:11] and making them as a sacrifice
[1:15:14] to adonai
[1:15:20] oh may my words
[1:15:24] and my thoughts be a treasure
[1:15:29] of sacrifice acceptable oh lord
[1:15:36] now let me ask him you think god
[1:15:40] accepts gossip
[1:15:44] he's saying god accepts it whenever
[1:15:46] someone will tell us
[1:15:48] maybe a lie against a brother or sister
[1:15:50] we go to church with
[1:15:52] and we don't follow through like the
[1:15:54] scripture said to try to
[1:15:55] check that thing out we just like the
[1:15:59] person and we believe them
[1:16:00] and then we tell somebody else and they
[1:16:02] tell somebody else and now we're in the
[1:16:04] chain
[1:16:05] of spreading a lie against a brother or
[1:16:08] sister
[1:16:10] now you think god accepts that no
[1:16:13] i'm wondering how much of our speech
[1:16:17] how much of the meditation of our heart
[1:16:22] is acceptable
[1:16:27] and then we wonder why we're no closer
[1:16:28] to god it's quite simple friends
[1:16:31] the reason none of us are any closer to
[1:16:33] god it's as simple as it can be
[1:16:36] you can take your finger and point it
[1:16:37] this way not toward me now
[1:16:41] some of you would like to do that your
[1:16:42] other point toward me or your wife or
[1:16:44] your young ones or
[1:16:45] but just point it where it belongs right
[1:16:47] here towards you
[1:16:49] now some of your sisters don't cut your
[1:16:51] hair some of your brothers haven't
[1:16:52] smoked in years
[1:16:54] you haven't drank in years and years but
[1:16:56] right here's what you're missing
[1:16:58] your mind is so caught up with current
[1:17:01] events
[1:17:02] and you're trying to figure out who's
[1:17:04] the truth look friend you don't even
[1:17:06] know who to believe anymore
[1:17:09] you don't know which news caster is
[1:17:11] telling the truth
[1:17:12] you don't know if it's the bbc the cnn
[1:17:15] nbc
[1:17:17] fox news this one let me tell you i've
[1:17:19] found the great news source
[1:17:21] and you can totally trust it it's god
[1:17:24] everybody else you better take with a
[1:17:26] grain of salt
[1:17:28] all but they're conservative yeah right
[1:17:30] they're conservative according to them
[1:17:32] but the lord god is our source of truth
[1:17:35] and may i go on and say that god has a
[1:17:38] body
[1:17:39] on the earth and ministers on the earth
[1:17:41] that are
[1:17:42] interested not in political parties and
[1:17:44] political agendas but they are
[1:17:46] interested in preaching messages that
[1:17:49] will bring
[1:17:49] faith to the hearts of god's people in
[1:17:52] order to get us
[1:17:53] out of this hail that we're living in
[1:18:02] so he prayed against the sins of the
[1:18:05] body
[1:18:07] the sins of the flesh now he's praying
[1:18:10] against the sins
[1:18:12] of the mouth
[1:18:17] and the sins of the thoughts of the
[1:18:20] heart
[1:18:21] for as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:18:25] so is he
[1:18:28] oh you see i want my
[1:18:32] thoughts he says i want my words
[1:18:36] to be acceptable like a sacrifice
[1:18:40] was outspot
[1:18:47] brother donny what would i have to talk
[1:18:49] about if i didn't talk about gossip

[1:25:18] was not for the grace of god a
[1:25:20] modern-day pastor in this day
[1:25:22] would go out of his mind under the
[1:25:25] pressure and stuff you deal with
[1:25:27] i have to do this myself
[1:25:31] if not you'll be coming to see me in the
[1:25:33] insane world

[1:26:08] we are assimilating his glory
[1:26:11] why don't we have more of it we're not
[1:26:13] thinking enough about him
[1:26:16] [Applause]

[1:26:37] tapes and put them in your home
[1:26:39] and play them

[1:26:47] my mind listen to this speaking of the
[1:26:49] prophet you know the way to find god
[1:26:52] y'all ready for this what's so deep oh
[1:26:55] i hope you can get it you know the way
[1:26:59] to find god
[1:27:01] is to meditate upon god
[1:27:07] think of god
[1:27:12] don't you see why satan holds our minds
[1:27:16] captive and with many of us it's not on
[1:27:20] sinful things
[1:27:22] it's just so many problems
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:28] your nephew's sick your niece is sick
[1:27:31] her poodle has got the flu
[1:27:34] your aunt has got this your uncle has
[1:27:36] got that your grandpa's got this
[1:27:39] how many prayer requests do we turn in i
[1:27:41] i fear it like you do
[1:27:43] i feel it like you do every prayer
[1:27:45] because my thing lord have mercy on
[1:27:47] these poor people
[1:27:48] and we're we're cold heartless people if
[1:27:51] we just hear them and hear and forget
[1:27:53] about it
[1:27:53] but we're a people of god that love how
[1:27:56] can we hear
[1:27:57] such things and it not affect our hearts
[1:27:59] how can we hear of india
[1:28:00] having 400 000 new closest of cases of
[1:28:04] covet every day
[1:28:05] 4 000 people a day dying many of them
[1:28:08] are brothers and sisters in the message
[1:28:10] and not feel for them we have to feel
[1:28:12] for them
[1:28:13] but we've got to find a place somewhere
[1:28:17] to be able to cast our cares on him
[1:28:20] or it will drive us crazy
[1:28:23] we won't be able to take it
[1:28:30] david spoke of it how he would bind the
[1:28:32] laws on his bedpost
[1:28:34] i would meditate therein day and night
[1:28:38] if you notice it as the disciples on the
[1:28:40] road to emmaus
[1:28:41] that while they were speaking to each
[1:28:43] other concerning the lord jesus
[1:28:47] there he stepped right out of the bush
[1:28:50] and walked with them and if our
[1:28:53] minds would be more taken up
[1:28:57] on god and the things pertaining to
[1:29:01] god lord children it would be
[1:29:05] so much easier
[1:29:08] to live a victorious life
[1:29:12] in christ my you ought to put that on
[1:29:16] your refrigerator
[1:29:18] on your microwave on your toothbrush
[1:29:21] on your toothpaste on your mirror have
[1:29:23] it right there say
[1:29:24] devil get out of my way i'm claiming my
[1:29:28] mind back
[1:29:29] i'm claiming my time back
[1:29:38] can't you see it don't even have to be
[1:29:41] sinful wrong
[1:29:42] things that some christians cannot live
[1:29:45] a victorious life
[1:29:46] well i ain't got no sin in my life i
[1:29:48] don't drink i don't smoke i don't do
[1:29:50] that i don't know why the world's wrong
[1:29:52] right here you're just not thinking
[1:29:55] about him enough
[1:29:57] it's your aunts and your uncles and your
[1:29:59] cousins and and the price of oil and the
[1:30:01] price of this and the price of that
[1:30:03] and then satan knows for many people who
[1:30:04] have the holy ghost he ain't going to
[1:30:06] get them caught up and drinking
[1:30:08] he ain't going to get them caught up in
[1:30:09] pornography and all kinds of stuff for
[1:30:11] the world
[1:30:11] so what you do just get them caught up
[1:30:13] in the business
[1:30:14] of life
[1:30:22] but i'm taking it back oh
[1:30:25] what the devil done stole from me i'm
[1:30:28] taking it back
[1:30:32] oh my and if our minds would be more
[1:30:35] taken up on god and on the things
[1:30:38] pertaining to god
[1:30:40] no it would be so
[1:30:43] much easier
[1:30:47] how many could use for your christian
[1:30:49] walk to be
[1:30:50] a little bit easier every day
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:57] okay all right i gave you the script
[1:31:02] this is your prescription from dr
[1:31:04] donnelly reagan
[1:31:05] jr so now you can take him to the drive
[1:31:09] through and say all right god i need
[1:31:10] your help
[1:31:11] your servant read this from the message
[1:31:13] of the hour it's just as important to me
[1:31:15] as the seals or the thunders or anything
[1:31:17] else that prophet taught
[1:31:18] i need this field in my life lord god i
[1:31:21] need this field in my life
[1:31:23] and it's not that i've been thinking
[1:31:24] about evil and wrong and terrible
[1:31:26] terrible sinful things out there
[1:31:28] but just the things of life
[1:31:31] just the things of life do you all
[1:31:34] ever stop shut off your radio
[1:31:38] shut off your computer shut off your
[1:31:40] phone
[1:31:41] and just sit and meditate
[1:31:49] but see this way we meditate we want to
[1:31:51] hope because we're so busy and we're so
[1:31:53] important
[1:31:54] turn your dings off your bells off your
[1:31:58] whistles off so that devil won't
[1:32:00] aggravate you
[1:32:03] some of you love your smart form when
[1:32:04] you love jesus
[1:32:06] some of you might as well be honest you
[1:32:08] need delivered because you've got
[1:32:09] addicted to that thing
[1:32:11] [Applause]
[1:32:13] well i didn't get many amens on that i
[1:32:15] don't even know my
[1:32:19] well it sends you this to the how much
[1:32:21] screen time you spend every week don't
[1:32:23] it
[1:32:24] if it don't set it up so at the end of
[1:32:27] the week
[1:32:27] you can see how much time you spend on
[1:32:29] it
[1:32:32] you spent two hours and 57 minutes this
[1:32:34] week 16
[1:32:35] up from last week and just write
[1:32:39] yourself an app or have somebody do it
[1:32:40] for you
[1:32:41] and see how much time you spend talking
[1:32:42] to jesus
[1:32:44] this week you spent 13 minutes and 28
[1:32:46] seconds you're down 22
[1:32:48] from last week
[1:32:53] and then we wonder why we struggle and
[1:32:55] we struggle
[1:33:00] let's stand
[1:33:09] oh my can i reach you one more here
[1:33:14] i'm blind bartimaeus also but in a
[1:33:16] different city there in phoenix
[1:33:19] as and as we said as he did in the days
[1:33:23] gone by
[1:33:24] it's time that bartimaeus now if our
[1:33:27] meditations is taken off of our church
[1:33:30] affiliations if our meditations taken
[1:33:33] off of our work
[1:33:35] or off the superstitions that we have in
[1:33:37] our mind
[1:33:39] superstitions that we have in our mind
[1:33:44] and place them upon him and his presence
[1:33:48] he will come and do the same thing
[1:33:49] tonight he did for blind bartimaeus
[1:33:53] on that day can you imagine
[1:33:56] it changes from the natural battles and
[1:33:59] struggles and things of life
[1:34:02] in a very simple equation by taking so
[1:34:05] much of our thoughts away from
[1:34:07] things that are around us and putting it
[1:34:10] on him
[1:34:11] and that releases his power to do what
[1:34:15] he did for bartimaeus
[1:34:17] which was what open up the eyes
[1:34:21] of a blind man not by fasting
[1:34:25] not by praying you know 14 hours
[1:34:27] straight
[1:34:28] but by changing the pattern of our
[1:34:30] thinking amen
[1:34:32] god i need help god i need deliverance
[1:34:35] god
[1:34:35] i i need this lord i thank you for all
[1:34:37] that you've already done i thank you so
[1:34:39] much lord jesus
[1:34:41] and all of a sudden there's a miracle
[1:34:44] right in front of you a miracle has
[1:34:47] happened
[1:34:48] and you say well how did that happen
[1:34:50] brother donnie wasn't here brother daryl
[1:34:52] never prayed for me
[1:34:53] no it happened because your mindset
[1:34:55] changed
[1:34:57] oh my he will come and do the same thing
[1:35:01] tonight that he did for blind bartimaeus
[1:35:03] on that day
[1:35:04] if we'll just do it if we'll just keep
[1:35:08] our mind
[1:35:09] stayed on him and notice
[1:35:12] it's when we're thinking on those things
[1:35:15] the bible said if there be any praise if
[1:35:17] there'd been a virtue think on these
[1:35:18] things
[1:35:19] now i want to ask you a question what
[1:35:21] good does it do is to come to church
[1:35:23] and sit in the meeting and ponder
[1:35:27] and maybe discouraged because we didn't
[1:35:29] get a prayer card
[1:35:30] or may be discouraged because of some
[1:35:32] ill saying a neighbor did or discouraged
[1:35:34] about one little matter or another
[1:35:39] that keeps christ
[1:35:43] lord have mercy children you mean he
[1:35:46] he ain't talking about us thinking of
[1:35:49] evil things
[1:35:49] or wicked things just us becoming so
[1:35:52] discouraged in church
[1:35:54] because we didn't get prayed for or
[1:35:56] somebody said something against us
[1:35:57] and that keeps christ away from us
[1:36:03] why we assimilate into the negative
[1:36:06] thoughts and that negative stuff
[1:36:08] so and so don't like you so-and-so said
[1:36:10] you noticed they wouldn't speak to you
[1:36:12] before church
[1:36:12] they wouldn't shake your hand before
[1:36:14] church and there you set the whole
[1:36:15] service is mulling
[1:36:17] over that and you're the lords wanting
[1:36:18] to deal with you speak to you
[1:36:21] and them thoughts just keeps him away
[1:36:23] from you
[1:36:25] oh god help us
[1:36:29] that keeps christ away from you it's
[1:36:32] when you're sinking on it that's when
[1:36:33] the disciples after the resurrection
[1:36:35] was going down to the road at emmaus and
[1:36:38] they were speaking about him that's when
[1:36:40] he appeared to them
[1:36:41] we got our minds on too many things of
[1:36:43] the world if we would throw those things
[1:36:46] off our mind and think about him his
[1:36:48] soon coming
[1:36:49] there'd be more revelations
[1:36:52] and power in the church
[1:36:56] but we keep thinking about the things
[1:36:59] notice
[1:37:00] he's not mentioned sins
[1:37:04] he's not mentioned wicked horrible awful
[1:37:06] things just
[1:37:07] things
[1:37:13] what am i going to do tomorrow oh my
[1:37:17] lord
[1:37:18] everybody that's not guilty of that
[1:37:22] even i can't say amen to them
[1:37:27] why we're humans i didn't know
[1:37:30] that he don't have to get you to
[1:37:32] thinking about somebody else's wife
[1:37:34] he knows he don't have to worry about
[1:37:36] bothering you with robbing a bank
[1:37:38] but just to divert your thoughts for a
[1:37:40] few minutes
[1:37:43] what am i going to do tomorrow oh man i
[1:37:46] don't think i unplugged my curling iron
[1:37:47] i hope it's just sisters that think that
[1:37:53] i don't think i turned off the crock pot
[1:37:55] oh no
[1:37:58] you know as well as i do that devil has
[1:38:00] hit you with thoughts that's to be so
[1:38:02] simple why he knows you'll sit there and
[1:38:05] assimilate the whole service
[1:38:08] the beans spilled over and it caught the
[1:38:10] counter on fire the cat the the cabinets
[1:38:12] is on fire but now
[1:38:14] you sit in your mind your whole house is
[1:38:16] up in smoke as soon as i said stand
[1:38:17] you hit the door you're gone you get
[1:38:19] home and say
[1:38:22] and what would you do you forfeited the
[1:38:24] whole service
[1:38:26] because you allowed satan to put it in
[1:38:28] your mind and you so assimilated
[1:38:30] you started sweating listen to me
[1:38:32] friends is it true
[1:38:34] with thoughts we can assimilate so much
[1:38:37] into those thoughts we can become
[1:38:38] paranoid
[1:38:41] what could it be by the if we could so
[1:38:44] assimilate into the presence of god
[1:38:46] every time we come in here
[1:38:48] and we would leave this building in
[1:38:50] rapture
[1:38:54] oh praise god let me close
[1:38:59] there'd be more revelations and power in
[1:39:01] the church but we keep thinking about
[1:39:03] things what am i going to do tomorrow
[1:39:05] what am i going to do next week will i
[1:39:08] hold my job
[1:39:11] will this be and those things are in the
[1:39:14] hands
[1:39:15] of god think on
[1:39:19] christ i've got to read one more ken
[1:39:24] it takes meditation
[1:39:28] on the lord to bring him
[1:39:32] in your presence
[1:39:37] i went monday after brother jim and i
[1:39:40] had
[1:39:41] lunch together to see brother eugene
[1:39:44] sister janet
[1:39:46] i sat on his little chair there and we
[1:39:48] talked for a little bit
[1:39:51] he said brother donnie i don't think it
[1:39:54] just happened that you come by today
[1:39:56] i believe the lord sent you by my way
[1:40:00] you know we've been talking about things
[1:40:01] of the lord you know things at the end
[1:40:03] time
[1:40:04] and just by him saying that thing i felt
[1:40:07] it in another
[1:40:08] realm so i could pull over into that
[1:40:11] right atmosphere
[1:40:13] and you could just feel it sister janet
[1:40:15] was there you could just feel
[1:40:17] the spirit change in the room
[1:40:20] what was it talking about the government
[1:40:23] talking about the end time talking about
[1:40:25] the signs of the time
[1:40:26] it didn't do it but whenever he broke
[1:40:29] into his need
[1:40:31] his need i believe the lord sent you
[1:40:34] today he said
[1:40:35] and that quick the spirit of god moved
[1:40:38] over into that channel and said
[1:40:40] we're going to pray right now
[1:40:43] children it's not me contacting god for
[1:40:46] you
[1:40:47] it's you contacting god and pulling me
[1:40:50] in your direction pulling brother daryl
[1:40:52] brother wes and these other brothers
[1:40:54] that are preaching
[1:40:55] you getting a hold of god do you believe

[1:41:38] worshiping in our hearts and giving

[1:50:22] thought on
[1:50:23] a witness of his majesty and was just
[1:50:26] sharing some of the things that i've
[1:50:27] seen our lord do
[1:50:29] there's a sister sitting there who had a
[1:50:31] weeping tumor
[1:50:32] on her chest she never came up for
[1:50:35] prayer
[1:50:36] just sitting there in the service just
[1:50:37] rejoicing over the things assimilating
[1:50:40] the things that was being said

[1:50:45] ointment
