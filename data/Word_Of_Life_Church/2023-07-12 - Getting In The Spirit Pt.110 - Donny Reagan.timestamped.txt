[45:49] before long there'll be more of them
[45:52] there than there'll be left of us on the
[45:54] Earth
[45:55] I don't know about you I want to be
[45:58] ready every day yeah
[46:00] now that's not just an old person's
[46:01] thing I know I'm getting older I know
[46:03] all that but I think it's a Young
[46:06] Person's ideology or it should be too
[46:08] because none of us have a promise of
[46:11] even being able to walk out these doors
[46:13] tonight so we want to be ready whether
[46:16] you're 60 or 50 or 20 or 15. don't we
[46:20] because we never know when our time will
[46:23] come but we have this promise
[46:26] Satan cannot take us under God is done
[46:29] I'm so glad we believe that tonight
[46:32] everybody doing well yeah are you happy
[46:35] to be a Christian I'm as mad at the
[46:38] Devil
[46:40] what
[46:47] God bless you let's let's turn together
[46:49] tonight if you would in First
[46:50] Corinthians chapter three hope you're
[46:52] not getting tired of me reading these
[46:54] these verses here
[46:56] I absolutely love them because it's such
[46:58] a display of God's God's grace and the
[47:01] magnification of Grace coming from the
[47:03] Old Testament to the new uh special
[47:06] contrasting
[47:07] good works and bad works of course and
[47:11] then looking at the Old Testament how
[47:13] the works there pretty much defines your
[47:15] soul and defines your destiny well in
[47:18] the New Testament a person could have
[47:20] absolutely wind up being wrong as far as
[47:23] it works and yet still be a Christian I
[47:26] know that stumbles a lot of folks but
[47:28] I'm certainly glad that God has such
[47:30] Mercy
[47:31] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11.
[47:34] for other Foundation can no man lay then
[47:37] that is laid which is Jesus Christ now
[47:40] if any man build upon this Foundation
[47:42] gold silver precious stones wood hay
[47:47] stubble Every Man's work shall be made
[47:51] manifest for the day shall declare it
[47:54] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[47:57] the fire shall try every man's work and
[48:01] notice what it is every man's work
[48:04] of what sort that it is if any man's
[48:09] work abide which he hath built thereupon
[48:13] he shall receive a reward if any man's
[48:17] work shall be burned
[48:21] he shall suffer loss yet he himself
[48:24] shall be saved yet so as by far
[48:29] now you see Grace has been so magnified
[48:32] from the Old Testament you look at the
[48:34] characters in the Old Testament they
[48:36] lost their Works they were lost
[48:40] I find it so amazing that God under
[48:43] Grace has provided such a place that
[48:46] there can be good people that love the
[48:48] Lord that are saved people not bride but
[48:52] saved people they can wind up in
[48:54] absolutely the wrong Doctrine the wrong
[48:57] works but yet because they have trusted
[49:00] the Lord an element of blindness that
[49:03] has forbidden them from seeing the full
[49:05] truth God will have mercy on them
[49:09] Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[49:12] how many lots of people remember tonight
[49:13] as we pray
[49:15] God bless you let's just hold our
[49:16] requests in our hearts Heavenly Father
[49:19] we counted such an honor and a privilege
[49:22] that we could be gathered together I've
[49:24] been so excited Lord today to be able to
[49:27] come back to church and Lord to be able
[49:29] to sing and worship and pray and hear
[49:32] the word and Lord would just come with
[49:34] anticipation tonight to see what you're
[49:36] going to do see what you're going to say
[49:38] how you're going to move we're just
[49:41] sharing of such wonderful things that's
[49:43] happening among us and we know it's
[49:45] because you're among us so we pray
[49:48] tonight Lord that you would meet with us
[49:50] and this Wednesday night service that
[49:52] you would take the service move me aside
[49:55] Lord help me that I can just become as
[49:57] this microphone that Lord God I will
[50:00] follow the unction of the Holy Ghost
[50:02] shut my mouth to anything that would
[50:05] displease you may the presence of God
[50:07] anoint me but anoint the people as well
[50:10] that we can be able to be submissive to
[50:13] the spirit of God it's in the name of
[50:15] the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints
[50:18] said amen God bless you may be seated
[50:21] I'm going to speak to you for just a
[50:24] little bit tonight land this foundation
[50:25] on a very odd side of Supernatural gifts
[50:32] we believe in Supernatural gifts do we
[50:34] not we thank God for every gift that God
[50:36] has and every gift that God has Among Us
[50:39] and the way I feel about it I want every
[50:42] gift that God has for our church I want
[50:45] every one of them myself I want for us
[50:49] as individuals to be submissive to the
[50:51] spirit of God and let God be able to use
[50:54] us but there's also another side to
[50:57] Supernatural gifts now this is a
[50:59] frightening side that a person can
[51:02] actually have a gift that comes from God
[51:06] now it's not a fake it's not an
[51:09] impersonation but it's a real gift that
[51:12] comes from God and they can take that
[51:16] gift and use that gift in such a way
[51:21] that it will cause them to go to hell
[51:29] hello to you too yes they can actually
[51:33] use a gift in such a way
[51:37] that will cause them to go to hell now
[51:41] listen carefully the Harvest Time in
[51:44] 1964. now what she's talking about the
[51:46] devil when he come to the Lord Jesus and
[51:48] he made three attacks against the Lord
[51:50] Jesus and he parallels those attacks
[51:53] with a child of God every believer that
[51:57] they will be faced with the same three
[51:59] three things and he he takes it and
[52:02] shows how that when Satan offered these
[52:05] things to the Lord Jesus and then the
[52:06] Lord Jesus responded and then Satan used
[52:09] another approach and then the Lord Jesus
[52:12] responded and Satan used again another
[52:15] approach and then he responded again now
[52:19] once he said he makes you a supernatural
[52:23] offer I was talking about the devil how
[52:26] that the devil if he cannot stop you
[52:29] from serving God now he's able to do
[52:32] that to a lot of people the oh it's too
[52:34] hard it's too difficult I can't live
[52:36] right I I can't go through all that I
[52:38] don't want it well you don't have to try
[52:40] very hard on people like that but
[52:42] there's other people and they say oh no
[52:44] no I'm going to stay with that word I
[52:46] love God I'll tell you one thing I'm
[52:48] going to go on with God but you see he
[52:50] doesn't stop there but he will realign
[52:53] and then he will try to offer you
[52:56] something totally different now he will
[52:59] try to offer you something that seems
[53:02] almost impossible because you think that
[53:07] only God would be able to offer what the
[53:10] prophet is fixing to tell us but notice
[53:13] what brother REM says then he makes you
[53:16] a supernatural author okay so if he
[53:21] cannot stop you from going on with God
[53:24] and well I'm going back to the world I'm
[53:25] going back to my music I'm going back to
[53:28] the way I've done this and that and the
[53:29] other then you say no no no I'm not
[53:31] going to do it I'm sold out I'm going
[53:33] home as God well he just realigns
[53:36] himself and then he realigns to your
[53:39] confession and then it'll say okay all
[53:42] right fine so you I see then you are
[53:44] more determined than I thought you were
[53:47] so what I'm going to have to do is
[53:49] realign on where you are and I'm going
[53:52] to offer you not the world I'm going to
[53:55] offer you drinking I'm not going to
[53:56] offer you things like that but I will
[53:59] offer you tongues
[54:02] I'll offer you a gift
[54:06] I'll offer you something Supernatural
[54:10] but it'll be just a little bit off the
[54:13] word
[54:15] now that is much more deceiving than
[54:18] smoking right that's much more deceiving
[54:21] than vodka whiskey beer robbing a bank
[54:25] right so this is something in Satan's
[54:29] Arsenal that many people would never
[54:31] sing that he has access to
[54:35] but Satan actually has access to
[54:39] Supernatural gifts
[54:44] watch this now it says I'm going to come
[54:47] back to this so just before closing see
[54:49] if he can't tempt you away from the word
[54:54] now it says no no I'm going to stay with
[54:57] a word then he'll give you a
[55:00] supernatural offer he said I'll tell you
[55:04] what you get up here and dive off the
[55:08] temple now this is what he told Jesus
[55:10] now I want you to notice what he's
[55:12] offering to Jesus it's for Jesus to be a
[55:17] show-off
[55:19] now you see this is where many people
[55:21] mess up whenever they made up their mind
[55:25] I'm not going back to the world no sir
[55:27] I'll tell you one thing I burn all them
[55:29] Bridges behind me but then Satan will
[55:32] make them an offer to be a supernatural
[55:36] show-off
[55:38] so they you know they take what God's
[55:41] done and they begin to brag and if you
[55:44] notice it starts out so mildly and such
[55:46] a small mild mannered form and then
[55:49] it'll transition to where that becomes
[55:51] more and more and more about them and
[55:56] less and less and less about Jesus
[55:59] anybody here tonight that can perform a
[56:01] miracle you're free to do so right now
[56:05] anybody here who can heal anyone
[56:10] you're free to do it
[56:14] hello testing one two
[56:18] anybody that can pray the prayer of face
[56:21] without needing God's help
[56:24] you're welcome to do it my feet still
[56:27] bothering me I'll be the first one come
[56:29] lay your hands on them
[56:33] now see most of us we find that
[56:36] repulsive don't we
[56:37] because Satan don't come that way
[56:40] he comes in more of a slyway but it was
[56:43] your prayer
[56:45] you was the one that was the most
[56:47] sincere they was 583
[56:51] 932 praying for the same person but God
[56:55] heard your prayer
[56:57] and how do you know that for sure
[57:00] so you see Satan then will begin to make
[57:03] people a supernatural offer to where
[57:06] they feel like their prayer their
[57:09] anointing whatever more is more special
[57:12] more Supernatural how can you make
[57:14] Supernatural more Supernatural
[57:18] if it's supernatural It's Supernatural
[57:21] is it not
[57:23] now watch this is so strange and odd
[57:25] brother Rand doesn't say this anywhere
[57:27] else and the entirety of the message
[57:30] worded quite like this except in this
[57:33] message here he will give you a
[57:35] supernatural offer I'll tell you what
[57:37] you get up down you dive off the temple
[57:40] and bring back up see show the people
[57:44] that you can do something Supernatural
[57:49] now remember when the prophet preaches
[57:51] this he actually says that the Lord
[57:53] Jesus was tempted to do it
[57:57] so he was tempted to act like
[58:02] this Supernatural something was that his
[58:06] disposal whenever he wanted it
[58:09] so all right the devil wants me to do it
[58:11] I'll prove I'm a man of God well I saw
[58:14] that in Pentecost
[58:16] yeah I saw a lot of them guys running
[58:18] around with other men's wives all kinds
[58:21] of sin in their life and yet get in the
[58:24] pulpit and make the challenge now the
[58:26] time has come for God to testify of his
[58:29] man uh-huh
[58:32] I've seen all kinds of Supernatural
[58:34] events take place and come to find out
[58:36] that man was an absolute liar adulter
[58:40] money launcher and all kinds of things
[58:43] well praise the Lord that's why when I
[58:46] come to the message they are insert here
[58:48] in the morning once the end time I felt
[58:50] like a bird let out of a prison because
[58:52] I'd had them questions for years and
[58:54] years in my life
[58:57] now watch this show the people that you
[59:01] can do something Supernatural boy he got
[59:04] him there now watch this is it now watch
[59:07] when you get to the end where this
[59:09] temptation come now brother Brown is
[59:11] identifying this as a Temptation maybe
[59:14] he might let some of you speak in
[59:16] tongues and think you got it
[59:21] the devil
[59:24] the devil
[59:27] but you see if he can make you sing
[59:30] you've got the Holy Ghost and all he
[59:33] needs to do is cause a confusion of
[59:35] tongues that would be an easy trade-off
[59:38] I hope you understand what I'm fixing to
[59:40] say demon Spirits can talk in tongues
[59:46] that shouldn't stumble you what are tons
[59:49] there are tons of men and tongues of
[59:52] angels
[59:53] so whenever the apostles on them receive
[59:55] the Holy Ghost and they begin to speak
[59:57] in tongues remember the prophet said
[59:59] part of the miracle was that it was in
[1:00:01] the hearing of the people that was there
[1:00:04] each one of them from Cappadocia from
[1:00:06] all the different nationalities that
[1:00:08] were there part of the miracle was they
[1:00:10] heard them speak in their own language
[1:00:13] what was the tongues they were speaking
[1:00:15] at it was known tongues or known
[1:00:18] languages of the world you think the
[1:00:20] devil can't talk in Greek
[1:00:22] you think the devil came to talk in
[1:00:24] French you can't you think he can't talk
[1:00:27] in Spanish do you think he can't talk in
[1:00:30] the other language of the world why of
[1:00:31] course he can so you know as well as I
[1:00:34] knew that there are people that go into
[1:00:36] a coma I read a one not long ago the
[1:00:39] individual was there for six months
[1:00:41] spoke English only language they knew
[1:00:44] come out of that coma and spoke perfect
[1:00:47] French
[1:00:49] they didn't even know French they knew
[1:00:51] french fry french toast you know that
[1:00:53] sort of thing but they could no longer
[1:00:55] speak English but spoke French
[1:00:59] how is that even possible something
[1:01:02] happened in their body and it changed
[1:01:05] them well you imagine for a lot of
[1:01:07] Pentecostals of course this was exactly
[1:01:09] what they was looking for brother Jack
[1:01:11] oh my how many did I see when you're
[1:01:13] making all the call and they'd go up and
[1:01:15] Jesus
[1:01:17] you got it you got it you got locked
[1:01:21] you got what
[1:01:24] oh my
[1:01:26] God now what's this he says or he might
[1:01:30] even let you prophesy
[1:01:34] though it not be with the word
[1:01:37] I've seen people stand up and prophesy I
[1:01:40] was as contrary
[1:01:42] to the word is the East says from the
[1:01:44] West that's pretty contrary isn't it see
[1:01:47] it's the word that you live by them
[1:01:51] Supernatural gifts Satan listen
[1:01:54] Satan can hand them out
[1:01:58] by the handfuls
[1:02:01] not God
[1:02:06] Satan
[1:02:09] Satan can hand them out by the handfuls
[1:02:13] now listen to this certainly that don't
[1:02:16] mean one thing
[1:02:22] oh my goodness
[1:02:24] I figured y'all be quiet but I thought
[1:02:26] at least somebody would be breathing
[1:02:27] y'all go ahead and breathe I don't want
[1:02:29] y'all to die on me now
[1:02:31] brother Donnie the devil yes
[1:02:34] but you see he would only hand them out
[1:02:37] to people who would believe in them
[1:02:40] what for to trick them
[1:02:43] to make them think they got the Holy
[1:02:46] Ghost when they don't
[1:02:48] or they put such emphasis on a gift and
[1:02:51] be a little bit off the word Prophet
[1:02:54] tells us about that the church age book
[1:02:55] that people would operate a gift with a
[1:02:59] margin of error in it hit Miss hit Miss
[1:03:03] hit miss my God don't miss
[1:03:08] praise the Lord I said my God don't miss
[1:03:10] my God don't lie if God says something
[1:03:14] it is that way is that right but yet
[1:03:18] people if that's their inclination then
[1:03:21] Satan will want to give them a
[1:03:23] substitute but friends there's so much
[1:03:25] real why in the world would any of us
[1:03:28] want a substitute or a fake for a real
[1:03:32] genuine baptism Brother Don don't you
[1:03:34] believe in the gifts with all of my
[1:03:36] heart and I've said it for years of my
[1:03:40] life I have prayed and prayed and hoped
[1:03:44] that I would be able to see it before I
[1:03:47] left this Earth all nine gifts in true
[1:03:52] operation I've seen enough of the other
[1:03:55] kind you say well just trash them all
[1:03:57] it's one of God's words in the Bible if
[1:04:01] I'm going to trash that what about the
[1:04:03] cross what about the resurrection if
[1:04:05] it's in the Bible there's going to be
[1:04:07] somebody it I believe that's going to
[1:04:10] have a real manifestation of what God
[1:04:12] wants I'm talking about impersonators I
[1:04:15] ain't talking about somebody that wants
[1:04:16] to be a big shot I'm talking about
[1:04:18] somebody that wants to be nothing and
[1:04:20] let the Lord use them
[1:04:22] [Applause]
[1:04:23] oh my now with that in mind I want you
[1:04:26] to listen to this now so go on into this
[1:04:28] that a person then could have a real
[1:04:31] genuine gift from God and depending on
[1:04:34] how they use that gift that gift could
[1:04:37] actually be the means by which it leads
[1:04:40] them to the regions of the lost now in
[1:04:43] reality they've been better off if
[1:04:45] they've never had the gift they've been
[1:04:47] better off if they would have never had
[1:04:49] it now watch this again the prophet says
[1:04:51] a man can take a Divine gift and send
[1:04:55] his soul to hell with it
[1:04:59] now you think my goodness I could see
[1:05:02] that with a pack of cigarettes a fifth
[1:05:04] of whiskey you know taking somebody
[1:05:06] else's wife and then doing all that sort
[1:05:08] of thing but with a gift well of course
[1:05:10] which you think is the most deceiving a
[1:05:13] pack of cigarettes or a Divine gift
[1:05:15] a supernatural gift you know that a gift
[1:05:18] from God now I don't mean just something
[1:05:21] that you imagine I mean if God is giving
[1:05:24] you something and this is the key and
[1:05:26] give it to your charge
[1:05:31] aha
[1:05:33] you've got to use that
[1:05:36] with the wisdom
[1:05:38] of God
[1:05:39] now you see every gift of God
[1:05:42] is an element of God's glory
[1:05:46] and God is very precautious
[1:05:49] and the way he delves these out
[1:05:51] so every individual that has a real gift
[1:05:54] from God
[1:05:55] will get an element of Glory
[1:05:59] mm-hmm
[1:06:01] recognition honor so on and so on
[1:06:05] then it's going to be up to that
[1:06:07] individual how they will use that God
[1:06:11] has dispensed that to them and it will
[1:06:14] take the wisdom of God not the desired
[1:06:18] of human flesh but the wisdom of God for
[1:06:21] every individual to use that gift with
[1:06:24] wisdom because if you don't then you
[1:06:28] cross over the line from God getting the
[1:06:30] glory to be for long the line becomes
[1:06:34] blurred and then the man is sharing
[1:06:37] Glory with God
[1:06:41] and people will do that to you
[1:06:44] yeah they will people will I said people
[1:06:48] will
[1:06:49] notice again it says in Phoenix God
[1:06:52] can't trust his gifts with everybody do
[1:06:55] you believe that when God gives you a
[1:06:58] gift you have to watch what you are
[1:07:01] doing with it so you see the gift comes
[1:07:03] from God but yet God is not the one that
[1:07:07] is always operating manipulating the
[1:07:10] administrative side the administrative
[1:07:12] side and the operation of it is left of
[1:07:15] to who you God calls you to be a
[1:07:18] preacher the Holy Ghost is not the one
[1:07:20] that will make you study four hours a
[1:07:22] day three hours a day two hours a day he
[1:07:25] will give you the ability to study he
[1:07:29] will give you the ability for God to
[1:07:32] open up the word and then you will study
[1:07:34] according to the gift that God gives you
[1:07:36] but the Holy Ghost won't study for you
[1:07:38] and then facts you your sermon the Holy
[1:07:41] Ghost has never faxed me one sermon I've
[1:07:44] ever preached he's never emailed me one
[1:07:46] or text me what but I have to do a lot
[1:07:49] of that myself
[1:07:51] I have to pray I have to look sometimes
[1:07:55] at hundreds times hundreds of quotes
[1:07:57] because I don't want to get one quote
[1:07:59] and run with it I want to make sure that
[1:08:01] what I'm preaching is a balanced diet
[1:08:04] for the saints of God so I want to study
[1:08:07] it through and through and through to
[1:08:10] make sure that what I'm bringing is
[1:08:12] exactly right so the Holy Ghost is not
[1:08:15] the one who does all of that he inspires
[1:08:18] you while you do your part well somebody
[1:08:22] say praise the Lord now you know you
[1:08:24] realize we've got a lot of good talented
[1:08:26] folks here that play music and sing and
[1:08:28] all that but I'm so grateful that they
[1:08:31] also realize that you could be a
[1:08:34] tremendous singer but you don't give no
[1:08:36] time to practice you don't know what
[1:08:38] song what key you sing it in you don't
[1:08:40] know nothing well you can get up here
[1:08:42] and start out in G and then they have to
[1:08:44] go to F and then they have to go to a
[1:08:46] flat and then they finally find you on
[1:08:48] the upper end to be and you've took
[1:08:50] about five minutes of the people sitting
[1:08:52] here looking at you think why in the
[1:08:53] world didn't you do that back there in
[1:08:55] the music room you could have done it
[1:08:57] back there and been ready or you can
[1:09:00] stand up here and do it which one would
[1:09:02] you rather have do you want a preacher
[1:09:04] that'll stand up here oh let's see I
[1:09:07] believe brother Branham said that in uh
[1:09:09] in uh in
[1:09:11] was it the deity of Jesus Christ or or
[1:09:15] was that in Erie Pennsylvania in 1951 at
[1:09:17] Thy word no I don't believe it I think
[1:09:19] it might have been believing God maybe
[1:09:21] in 19 52 well I don't know it don't
[1:09:23] really matter no way you know what
[1:09:24] that's a man right there that should
[1:09:26] have done a whole lot more praying and a
[1:09:28] whole lot more studying but he's not
[1:09:30] accepting what God's given and applying
[1:09:33] himself in the right way well good night
[1:09:36] you think I was speaking to a preacher's
[1:09:37] convention wouldn't you
[1:09:39] but you see what happens that that man
[1:09:42] gets gets the gift from God and then god
[1:09:46] holds him responsible for what he does
[1:09:48] with and I said do you know that a man
[1:09:49] can take a gift of God and send his soul
[1:09:54] to hell
[1:09:56] with it
[1:09:58] do you understand that's what Judas did
[1:10:04] if you and I would have been in the days
[1:10:05] of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:07] when he chose his disciples
[1:10:10] I dare say every one of us would have
[1:10:13] been deceived by Judas Iscariot
[1:10:18] John was
[1:10:19] Peter was
[1:10:21] Matthew was
[1:10:23] all the rest of them were you know why
[1:10:25] because Judas did not have an inferior
[1:10:30] gift his was equivalent to the rest of
[1:10:34] the brothers
[1:10:35] Judas could preach listen to me this
[1:10:38] don't let it stumble you Judas even
[1:10:41] could cast out devils
[1:10:43] not by dunamis of an indwelling power
[1:10:46] but by excusia which is a jurisdiction
[1:10:50] or an authority given to you by someone
[1:10:54] who is above you so Judas did not have
[1:10:57] power within himself to cast out Devils
[1:11:00] himself being a devil it's an amazing
[1:11:02] thing because Judas could cast out
[1:11:04] Devils but he couldn't keep the devil
[1:11:06] from getting in him
[1:11:08] oh my goodness he could cast out Devils
[1:11:12] because Jesus said cast out Devils heal
[1:11:15] the sick that's the way he did it not
[1:11:17] because he was righteous not because he
[1:11:21] was holy not because he was a god-called
[1:11:24] man in the sense of Peter being one but
[1:11:27] he was given a gift you imagine he could
[1:11:30] stand there and preach he could preach
[1:11:32] and whatever come right down to it and
[1:11:34] Jesus said one of you is going to betray
[1:11:36] me Judas had lived such a holy life he
[1:11:40] had preached the message of that day in
[1:11:43] such a comparative way to the rest of
[1:11:45] them that they questioned themself
[1:11:48] before they questioned him now you know
[1:11:52] if they'd seen him flirting around with
[1:11:54] all the young girls and flirting around
[1:11:55] with the women and seeing him doing this
[1:11:57] and doing this oh I know who that is
[1:11:59] that's Judas man you can't trust that
[1:12:01] guy but he was so up to part with the
[1:12:05] rest of them they questioned their own
[1:12:07] credibility
[1:12:08] before they question him when you know
[1:12:10] how that they sat at the Last Supper
[1:12:13] they did not use a table the way we do
[1:12:15] but they lay down and reclined Jesus
[1:12:18] would have been said in the middle some
[1:12:19] of the disciples would have been laying
[1:12:21] on his left others have been laying on
[1:12:22] his right Judas Iscariot was the right
[1:12:25] hand man I know the Last Supper that
[1:12:28] shows you with him setting up that's not
[1:12:30] the way it was they actually laid down
[1:12:32] that's why the Bible said John leaned
[1:12:35] over on Jesus Muslim why because they
[1:12:38] were laying down so that that's the way
[1:12:40] that they ate and Judas they all looked
[1:12:43] around him when they want to look and
[1:12:45] they thought oh my goodness Judas is the
[1:12:48] right hand man
[1:12:49] Judas is laying right there John's on
[1:12:52] one side and Judas is on the other and
[1:12:55] the brothers there annoyed the
[1:12:56] traditions and they would have looked at
[1:12:58] it and said Judas he's the he's the one
[1:13:00] he he's the next one he's going to get
[1:13:03] Jesus ministry because Jesus is telling
[1:13:06] them I'm fixing to go boys I'm fixing to
[1:13:08] leave and when they looked at the way
[1:13:10] they had them said in order they said
[1:13:11] Judas is going to get it
[1:13:13] if you're not have been sitting there
[1:13:15] you know what with assault Judas is
[1:13:17] going to get it
[1:13:18] he was going to get it all right but he
[1:13:20] wasn't going to get to Holy Ghost
[1:13:22] but looking at it in the natural mind
[1:13:25] there was nothing inferior he stood with
[1:13:27] some messages we'd say but when it come
[1:13:30] right down to it Judas couldn't get the
[1:13:33] Holy Ghost
[1:13:34] he could heal Oh my he could cast out
[1:13:37] Devils he could preach he could do
[1:13:40] anything Peter could do and might have
[1:13:43] done it better than some of the things
[1:13:45] Peter done but Peter could get the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost and Judas couldn't get it
[1:13:51] oh my but yet as far as gifts you said
[1:13:54] where did he come where'd the gifts come
[1:13:56] from the Lord Jesus
[1:14:00] oh my notice this again the prophet says
[1:14:03] how many knows that you could send your
[1:14:06] soul to hell
[1:14:07] with a Divine gift sure you can he says
[1:14:10] you have to watch what you're doing how
[1:14:12] many believes Moses was God's Prophet
[1:14:13] Say Amen
[1:14:15] he was God's Prophet but do you know
[1:14:17] what he done God told him to go down
[1:14:19] there to speak to the Rock and The Rock
[1:14:21] was already smitten he said is that
[1:14:23] right instead of Moses doing what God
[1:14:25] told him to do he went down and smote
[1:14:28] The Rock again well that absolutely
[1:14:31] broke the entire scripture right into
[1:14:36] right there Christ wasn't smitten twice
[1:14:39] he was smitten once we just speak to him
[1:14:42] from now on look what Moses died so
[1:14:45] Moses strikes The Rock twice and he
[1:14:48] broke every type and Shadow in the Bible
[1:14:50] when he done it yet he was God's prophet
[1:14:53] and he had been given power and he could
[1:14:57] use that power at his will even when it
[1:15:01] was wrong
[1:15:05] God gave him that power and he stands
[1:15:08] out and said you bunch of rebels Rebels
[1:15:10] even in his anger boy Moses gets all
[1:15:13] bent out of shape they've been built to
[1:15:15] left him at the house wasn't on that
[1:15:16] service he gets up there and strikes out
[1:15:19] at the people and then he strikes that
[1:15:20] rock and God said all right boy all
[1:15:23] right because you've done this you're
[1:15:26] not going in
[1:15:31] oh my goodness
[1:15:33] Moses smote the rock that broke God's
[1:15:36] complete program
[1:15:39] and it was done exactly what God told
[1:15:41] him not to do well you and I think in
[1:15:44] our mind well if he'd done what God told
[1:15:46] him not to do then the power wouldn't be
[1:15:48] there nope that's not true
[1:15:52] the power was there
[1:15:55] and when he smote that rock the water
[1:15:58] come gushing out totally out of the will
[1:16:01] of God
[1:16:04] and people say Oh Glory to God I know
[1:16:05] I'm in the will of God God blessed me
[1:16:07] and God done this and God done that yeah
[1:16:10] I agree totally
[1:16:12] and God will try us sometimes
[1:16:15] you know how he tries his people by his
[1:16:17] word
[1:16:18] he'll even let you feel led to do
[1:16:20] something not that he leads you to do it
[1:16:22] but he will allow you to feel led to do
[1:16:25] something contrary to his word as I said
[1:16:28] he don't lead you because the Holy Ghost
[1:16:30] will never lead you and I contrary to
[1:16:32] the word but he'll let the devil inspire
[1:16:35] you and you'll feel led to do a certain
[1:16:38] thing and yet look in the word the word
[1:16:40] says this the word says that the word
[1:16:42] says the message says the message well I
[1:16:43] know I know but I feel led I feel with
[1:16:45] it
[1:16:47] and God will try you to see is your soul
[1:16:51] birthed by the word
[1:16:53] or do you go by your feelings
[1:16:58] praise the Lord
[1:17:00] maybe I'll ask you again I'm just happy
[1:17:02] to be or not
[1:17:03] oh man nothing hers made me happy now
[1:17:10] don't tell me some of y'all ain't near
[1:17:11] as happy since we've left Happy Valley
[1:17:15] I got an email from one of the brothers
[1:17:17] over in India years ago or after we left
[1:17:19] the church over at Happy Valley and been
[1:17:21] a few months back and and he said
[1:17:22] Brother Don he said why did you rename
[1:17:24] the church he said I I was so used to
[1:17:26] Happy Valley he said I thought Happy
[1:17:27] Valley was a spiritual name I said no
[1:17:29] there wasn't a spiritual names the name
[1:17:31] of the community
[1:17:32] so he thought we was happy in the valley
[1:17:34] I didn't tell him that y'all wasn't
[1:17:36] always happy in the valley I didn't tell
[1:17:38] him that I wasn't always happy in that
[1:17:39] but he thought it's a spiritual name and
[1:17:41] he thought they ought to have the same
[1:17:43] thing I said well that's the name of the
[1:17:44] community those Happy Valley Baptist
[1:17:46] Church those Happy Valley this but I
[1:17:48] believe we can still be a spiritual
[1:17:50] happy in the valley don't you
[1:17:53] oh my god notice so he breaks the type
[1:17:56] when Moses smote the rock that broke
[1:17:59] God's complete program
[1:18:01] had he done exactly what God told him to
[1:18:04] do but he could do it anyhow
[1:18:07] whether it was God's will or not
[1:18:13] you see preachers can take their gifts
[1:18:16] and do things sometimes with them gifts
[1:18:19] totally out of the will of God
[1:18:21] and God will honor it
[1:18:27] people will be healed this and that and
[1:18:30] the other will happen and say see that
[1:18:31] glory to God that proves I'm right the
[1:18:34] word proves we're right
[1:18:37] not just signs not just wonders
[1:18:41] well praise the Lord
[1:18:44] now watch brother Graham knows it sounds
[1:18:46] strange and he says that that seems
[1:18:48] strange doesn't it but it wasn't God's
[1:18:51] will
[1:18:52] but he was a prophet he could do
[1:18:55] whatever he wished and what his power
[1:18:59] would permit him to do
[1:19:02] oh my
[1:19:04] I never study along these lines that
[1:19:07] I don't always think
[1:19:10] of one of the
[1:19:12] renowned men
[1:19:14] in the Old Testament that is a parallel
[1:19:17] of this
[1:19:18] by the name of Balaam
[1:19:21] Balaam is a very
[1:19:23] odd character to me just me looking at
[1:19:26] him
[1:19:27] I can't say I understand but the Jackie
[1:19:30] Howe all that worked with Balaam
[1:19:34] but he was a man that was a man of
[1:19:38] double identity
[1:19:40] he was a man that lived two lives as it
[1:19:44] were
[1:19:46] he's called a soothsayer
[1:19:48] yet also called a prophet
[1:19:52] he saw things by vision and by trance
[1:19:56] and yet he also used enchantments
[1:20:00] which was witchcraft
[1:20:03] he was a messed up dude I'm telling you
[1:20:07] what's this in Numbers Chapter 23 verse
[1:20:10] 16.
[1:20:12] I'm the Lord capital L capital
[1:20:15] r capital D
[1:20:19] Matt balam
[1:20:21] and put
[1:20:22] a word
[1:20:25] in his mouth
[1:20:30] wow
[1:20:34] and hence said go again unto balak
[1:20:38] and say thus now remember this man by
[1:20:41] this time had seen an angel of God
[1:20:46] an angel of God stood in the way and his
[1:20:49] donkey had more sense than he did
[1:20:51] and that the donkey's going down through
[1:20:53] there and then the donkey sees the angel
[1:20:55] of the Lord
[1:20:56] and he's beaten a time out of that
[1:20:58] donkey and finally he opened his eyes
[1:21:00] and their balance saw it
[1:21:02] so this man has seen an angel
[1:21:05] he stepped over what God wanted and
[1:21:08] moved into the permissive will of God
[1:21:11] and now God takes this man
[1:21:15] which has used enchantments
[1:21:19] and puts a word
[1:21:22] in his mouth
[1:21:25] and the Saints said
[1:21:28] chapter 23 verse 26.
[1:21:31] but Balaam answered and said unto
[1:21:33] bailout now you remember what happened
[1:21:35] you're that Balaam he was hired by balak
[1:21:38] and he wanted to become curse Israel
[1:21:41] well he got out there and he got praying
[1:21:43] got them you know in the presence of the
[1:21:45] Lord
[1:21:46] they opened his mouth and he said I see
[1:21:49] thy cancer Jacob they are goodly they
[1:21:52] are this and that in heaven and they'll
[1:21:54] obey them got to prophesy
[1:21:56] things that was absolutely phenomenal
[1:22:00] he prophesied one of the greatest
[1:22:02] Messianic prophecies of the Old
[1:22:05] Testament a soothsayer
[1:22:10] wow
[1:22:15] so balam started prophesying good things
[1:22:17] and balak I mean he hard him into this
[1:22:20] denomination to curse that bunch of
[1:22:21] message people and he got under the
[1:22:23] anoint he said man I hope my end is life
[1:22:25] thirst you talking about a Godly bunch
[1:22:27] of people that said what are you doing I
[1:22:30] hired you to bless them
[1:22:33] now notice this is his response but
[1:22:35] Balaam answered and said unto balak told
[1:22:38] not of these saying all that the Lord
[1:22:41] speaketh how must I do I can't help it I
[1:22:44] was going to blast them and I was going
[1:22:46] to tell them as an occult and all that
[1:22:48] sort of thing and the next thing I
[1:22:49] started saying was glory to God I went
[1:22:51] to that church it wasn't at all the way
[1:22:53] I thought it was Hallelujah I come a
[1:22:55] little bit of skeptical of it my well I
[1:22:58] come through the prayer line God heal me
[1:23:00] or my blood pressure God done this and
[1:23:02] God done that God knows how to make
[1:23:04] people testify
[1:23:05] now notice chapter 24 verse 1 and when
[1:23:08] Balaam saw that it pleased the lord to
[1:23:11] bless Israel he went not as at other
[1:23:16] times to seek for enchantments
[1:23:22] you mean to tell me this man is mixing
[1:23:25] spiritual gifts
[1:23:27] with witchcraft
[1:23:38] I don't think we understand
[1:23:40] how important
[1:23:42] one simple thing is to God
[1:23:45] obedience
[1:23:49] we tend to think gifts emotion this that
[1:23:53] the other is the greatest thing I hate
[1:23:56] to disrupt your fan parade
[1:23:58] but obedience is one of the greatest
[1:24:01] things you will ever accomplish for the
[1:24:05] kingdom of God
[1:24:08] by not cutting your hair sisters it's
[1:24:10] one of the greatest things you can ever
[1:24:11] do why you're obeying God's word the
[1:24:14] prophet said what gets God's attention
[1:24:16] keeping his word but we tend to think oh
[1:24:20] this great thing and this great thing
[1:24:22] and that great thing those you're going
[1:24:23] to find out in Matthew 24 that there
[1:24:26] will be people who have done absolutely
[1:24:29] phenomenal Miracles and will go to hell
[1:24:34] why they didn't obey
[1:24:37] and some of you will walk down streets
[1:24:39] of gold that have never performed one
[1:24:41] Miracle at all
[1:24:43] and it will be said to you well done my
[1:24:45] good and faithful servant why because
[1:24:47] you obeyed you repented you got baptized
[1:24:52] you've done this you've done that the
[1:24:54] preacher preaching yourself well Lord
[1:24:56] I'm sorry I've been guilty I didn't know
[1:24:58] that was wrong Lord I'll quit you don't
[1:25:00] understand what that does to the heart
[1:25:01] of God you don't understand just by you
[1:25:04] getting up every day in praying reading
[1:25:06] your Bible you understand what it does
[1:25:07] to the heart of God when you and I
[1:25:09] praise him in the midst of Trials it's
[1:25:12] not just so the praise will come out of
[1:25:14] your mouth it's because you're obeying
[1:25:16] that's what he wants you to do and when
[1:25:19] you do that you're obeying what he says
[1:25:21] I don't understand it he didn't say
[1:25:23] understand it he just said do it
[1:25:25] obedience is such a tremendous thing to
[1:25:29] God
[1:25:31] kind of go on
[1:25:33] and balam saw that he pleased the lord
[1:25:35] to bless Israel and he went not as at
[1:25:37] other times to seek for enchantments but
[1:25:42] he set his face toward
[1:25:45] the Wilderness now the Wilderness now of
[1:25:46] course is where Israel is so he's going
[1:25:48] to go and get on their back parts and
[1:25:50] see what kind of thoughts that he can
[1:25:52] find what kind of issues that Sarah
[1:25:55] because man don't tell what this salary
[1:25:57] is pretty good and if he don't you know
[1:25:59] give out some stuff that's going to
[1:26:00] please all daylight he's going to drop
[1:26:02] his Social Security and Obey him think
[1:26:04] of man alive I got to retire this
[1:26:06] preaching stuff so I got to have
[1:26:07] something to kind of fall back on so I
[1:26:09] said if I get among them long enough I
[1:26:11] guarantee I'll find some fault somewhere
[1:26:14] look in verse 3. and he took up his
[1:26:17] parable
[1:26:18] and said Balaam the son of bior
[1:26:23] said
[1:26:24] and the man whose eyes are open have
[1:26:28] said
[1:26:29] he hath said which heard the words of
[1:26:34] God
[1:26:35] which saw the vision of the almighty
[1:26:39] where did he hear this name
[1:26:43] Almighty
[1:26:47] this was one of the Sacred names of God
[1:26:51] kept close
[1:26:53] for Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:26:57] where did he hear this name
[1:27:02] now notice what happens to this guy
[1:27:05] soothsayer enchantment Seeker
[1:27:09] he fell into a trance
[1:27:11] having his eyes wide open
[1:27:16] so he's standing there kneeling whatever
[1:27:18] he is
[1:27:19] and all of a sudden he just goes into
[1:27:21] this Dimension so a portal if you will
[1:27:23] was opened up so Balaam is there and
[1:27:27] he's thinking that out you know balak
[1:27:29] he's going to get really upset at me and
[1:27:30] if this is going to happen all of a
[1:27:32] sudden he just

[1:27:41] rapt or a p t raptured state
[1:27:46] and he starts hearing the words of God
[1:27:49] the Almighty

[1:28:18] worthless in the eyes of God and what
[1:28:20] good does a vision or a trance do you if
[1:28:23] you don't obey God
[1:28:25] balam will use that gift and wound up
[1:28:28] taking him to hell
[1:28:35] fell into a trance having his eyes open
[1:28:38] verse 5. how goodly
[1:28:42] are thy tents oh Jacob

[1:31:36] there shall come a star out of Jacob
[1:31:40] and a scepter shall rise out of Israel
[1:31:44] and shall Smite the corners of Moab now
[1:31:47] remember where he's at
[1:31:50] balac
[1:31:52] is the king of Moab
[1:31:59] that when his salary
[1:32:02] Social Security welfare check you know
[1:32:04] everything just went out the window you
[1:32:06] imagine be like a sinner or listen this
[1:32:08] now what's he going to say now what's he
[1:32:09] going to say
[1:32:10] [Music]
[1:32:13] I said look at good Lord ain't never
[1:32:16] seen like that my life look at his eyes
[1:32:18] there shall arise a star
[1:32:21] out of Jacob
[1:32:23] a scepter shall come
[1:32:25] o Israel how goodly are thy dance
[1:32:29] I don't see him now I can't know him now
[1:32:32] but there will come one he saw the Lord
[1:32:34] Jesus
[1:32:39] oh my goodness
[1:32:44] and he shall Smite the corners of Moab
[1:32:48] and destroy all the children of chefs
[1:32:52] numbers 31 16.
[1:32:57] you remember when the children of Israel
[1:32:59] now sometime after this
[1:33:02] they begin to look upon the daughters of
[1:33:05] Moab
[1:33:07] and invited them to come over to a big
[1:33:09] convention they was having
[1:33:12] the Bible says that they begin to commit
[1:33:15] adultery
[1:33:16] with these Daughters of Moab
[1:33:19] you remember the story of course
[1:33:22] whenever the man puts an end to the
[1:33:24] plague and
[1:33:25] the justice of God Judgment of God
[1:33:27] breaks out on them
[1:33:30] but notice what caused this
[1:33:33] behold these cause the children of
[1:33:35] Israel through the council
[1:33:39] of Balaam
[1:33:42] you see his prophecy was a hundred
[1:33:45] percent accurate
[1:33:48] but it was his teaching
[1:33:54] so when Balaam got out from under the
[1:33:56] anointing
[1:33:57] he gathered the heads together and said
[1:34:00] I found their problem
[1:34:02] I found their weakness
[1:34:05] all their women have long hair
[1:34:08] and no women aren't allowed to wear many
[1:34:10] skirts to church
[1:34:12] and their women can't do this and can't
[1:34:14] do that so if you'll set up your
[1:34:16] denominational daughters out there in
[1:34:18] front of them put on makeup let them you
[1:34:20] know cut their hair let them do this and
[1:34:22] that another the more boys will fall for
[1:34:24] them the same man that saw Jesus
[1:34:28] the same man that knew the secret names
[1:34:31] of God
[1:34:32] Yeah by prophecy but it was his teaching
[1:34:37] his counsel so he calls all these heads
[1:34:40] together said now this is what you do
[1:34:42] you do this and you do that and you do
[1:34:44] that
[1:34:45] and you'll get them
[1:34:49] notice the Bible says behold these cause
[1:34:51] the children of Israel through the
[1:34:54] Council of Balaam
[1:34:56] to commit trespass against the Lord in
[1:34:59] the matter of pior and there was a
[1:35:02] plague among the congregation of the
[1:35:05] Lord
[1:35:06] in this amazing the Devil Himself could
[1:35:09] not Smite him but if he could cause them
[1:35:11] to become what disobedient to the word
[1:35:14] then the hand of God of Mercy would move
[1:35:17] back and he will allow the angel of
[1:35:19] death to Smite him so there's people
[1:35:20] dying everywhere
[1:35:22] and how did that come to pass under this
[1:35:25] preacher Prophet if you wish to call him
[1:35:28] that soothsayer under his counsel his
[1:35:33] teaching
[1:35:36] um
[1:35:38] praise the Lord everybody
[1:35:40] Joshua chapter 13 verse 22.
[1:35:44] now your battle breaks out sometime
[1:35:47] later
[1:35:49] listen who they kill
[1:35:52] Balaam also the son of Dior
[1:35:56] read it with me
[1:36:00] so a soothsayer
[1:36:02] prophesied Messianic prophecy
[1:36:08] astounding is it not
[1:36:15] Balaam the son of the or the soothsayer
[1:36:17] did the children of Israel slay
[1:36:20] with the sword among them
[1:36:23] that were slain so here Balaam actually
[1:36:26] lived after the Council of those that
[1:36:29] had committed adulter with the daughters
[1:36:30] of Moab had died Balaam went right on to
[1:36:33] live under this denominational auspice
[1:36:36] but the sword of God finally caught up
[1:36:39] with him
[1:36:42] second Peter chapter 2 verse 15.
[1:36:46] which have forsaken the right way and
[1:36:48] are gone astray
[1:36:50] following the way of Balaam the son of
[1:36:54] bosar who loved the wages
[1:36:57] of
[1:36:59] unrighteousness so here we see from
[1:37:01] Peter part of balaam's fall
[1:37:04] it was the Love of Money
[1:37:07] and it was the wages of unrighteousness
[1:37:10] and yet this man had a gift
[1:37:13] and that gift will eventually be part of
[1:37:16] his Destiny which will lead him to hell
[1:37:19] can you imagine this man standing Before
[1:37:22] the Throne of God what will he try to
[1:37:24] say I prophesied about your coming I'll
[1:37:27] prophesy this I blessed Israel but you
[1:37:30] also by your teaching
[1:37:33] pull them out of the Assembly of Israel
[1:37:38] to the assembly of moabites
[1:37:42] he pulled them out of the congregation
[1:37:44] of Israel
[1:37:46] oh my goodness
[1:37:50] you know friends whenever we think of
[1:37:52] the anointing of God now we're talking
[1:37:54] about rewards and works and the things
[1:37:56] that God wants us to do
[1:37:59] but you see how it works can actually
[1:38:02] work against us
[1:38:04] if it's not coupled with Divine
[1:38:06] obedience to God's Divine program
[1:38:10] you see God will try you
[1:38:13] after you become a Christian God tries
[1:38:16] leaders he tries preachers
[1:38:19] he tried Balaam it's easy to see he
[1:38:22] tried Moses he said his sin he failed
[1:38:26] every man that's ever been on the earth
[1:38:28] that was gifted of God has been tried
[1:38:31] and for many of them it's not when they
[1:38:33] first start out that's when they've been
[1:38:35] around for a while and they begin to
[1:38:37] feel confident the prophet tells us it's
[1:38:39] an influence of course they feel like
[1:38:40] they've got a little Kingdom built up so
[1:38:42] they they don't pray like they used to
[1:38:44] they don't think they have to be as
[1:38:45] spiritual as they used to so they can
[1:38:47] start you know doing this and doing that
[1:38:49] and not praying not being sincere and
[1:38:52] it'll catch up with them I don't care
[1:38:53] who they are
[1:38:54] our sincerity must be maintained the
[1:38:57] entirety of our life we can never let go
[1:38:59] of it our dedication to the Lord Jesus
[1:39:01] is that right
[1:39:03] can I have a few more minutes of your
[1:39:05] time
[1:39:06] let's read in first Samuel if you would
[1:39:08] chapter 15 verse 17 the character here
[1:39:12] is Samuel
[1:39:15] and Samuel
[1:39:17] is speaking to King Saul
[1:39:21] and Saul
[1:39:23] had by now become arrogant and proud and
[1:39:27] thinking of what he had done and what he
[1:39:30] had accomplished
[1:39:31] and Samuel said when thou was little
[1:39:35] in thine own sight
[1:39:37] you see the downfall of Great Men is not
[1:39:41] just when the people around them will
[1:39:44] try to make an idol out of them
[1:39:47] but it's when they begin to believe it
[1:39:51] that will always be I don't care who you
[1:39:53] are look friends if a man is going to be
[1:39:56] made to fall because people make an idol
[1:39:58] out of him then brother Branham would
[1:39:59] have been gone and destroyed years and
[1:40:01] years ago because people literally made
[1:40:03] him the Lord Jesus but God is not going
[1:40:06] to hold brother Branham responsible for
[1:40:07] what a bunch of Knuckleheads do around
[1:40:09] this message
[1:40:10] but that's not the danger for a real
[1:40:12] servant of God alone but the danger is
[1:40:15] when he begins to believe it about
[1:40:17] himself that he's so exclusive he's so
[1:40:20] anointed he can sing above everybody
[1:40:22] else and play the guitar play the organ
[1:40:24] or whatever it is he plays he's a little
[1:40:26] bit better than this and a little bit
[1:40:28] better than that a little bit better
[1:40:29] than somewhere else we are a body
[1:40:32] my little toe is ugly and some of most
[1:40:35] of you ain't never seen in your entire
[1:40:37] life but I hope I never lose a little
[1:40:39] Feller he's kind of hanged at being
[1:40:41] stuck on the side of the mother he ain't
[1:40:42] there as big as the big one he ain't
[1:40:44] they're as big as the second one and
[1:40:45] they're as big as the middle one but I'm
[1:40:47] glad I've got him my little fingers kind
[1:40:49] of t9y and small but I hope I never lose
[1:40:51] that little feather on a saw I hope I
[1:40:53] get to keep him the rest of my life
[1:40:55] praise the lord it's the same with folks
[1:40:58] that we may look out in the body well he
[1:40:59] ain't got much of a Ministry he ain't
[1:41:01] much of a singer well I'll tell you one
[1:41:03] thing if he's in the body we need him we
[1:41:06] need big preachers we need little
[1:41:08] preachers we need medium-sized preachers
[1:41:10] we need helps in the church we need
[1:41:13] governments in the church we did I was
[1:41:15] somebody would preach with me then hide
[1:41:16] we need prayer warriors we need young
[1:41:19] people we need all people we need
[1:41:21] middle-aged people we want everybody
[1:41:24] here that God wants here
[1:41:33] notice
[1:41:34] Samuel said when thou was little
[1:41:38] in thine own sight
[1:41:40] humble lonely
[1:41:43] and a low opinion of himself
[1:41:48] a low opinion of himself
[1:41:52] of his tribe
[1:41:54] and of his family
[1:41:57] notice what he says about himself in
[1:41:59] first Samuel 9 21 and Saul answered and
[1:42:01] said am I not a benjamite
[1:42:04] of the smallest of the tribes of Israel
[1:42:06] now this is when the prophet tells him
[1:42:08] God wants you to be the king notice the
[1:42:10] heartfelt opinion of this man about
[1:42:13] himself his family and his tribe had he
[1:42:16] kept this attitude we would not be
[1:42:19] reading this story we're fixing to read
[1:42:21] but you see the attitude changed within
[1:42:24] himself
[1:42:28] oh my goodness am I not a pinchamite of
[1:42:31] the smallest of the tribes of Israel and
[1:42:35] my family the least of all the families
[1:42:38] of The Tribe of Benjamin wherefore then
[1:42:41] speaketh thou so to me now this is his
[1:42:45] honest heartfelt view of himself brother
[1:42:48] Darryl this is the waste look at himself
[1:42:50] the Benjamins the smallest tribe as far
[1:42:53] as number it was at that time and he
[1:42:55] said my family is one of the smallest
[1:42:57] families in the whole tribe why would
[1:42:59] you come to me if he would have
[1:43:01] maintained this attitude about himself
[1:43:03] Oh my he would have had a dynasty that
[1:43:06] would have lasted a thousand years
[1:43:12] but he got to looking at himself and say
[1:43:14] boy look what I've done my goodness I've
[1:43:17] brought the tribes together we have been
[1:43:19] fighting battles we have done this and
[1:43:21] that and the other and we have done this
[1:43:23] and we have done that oh you probably
[1:43:25] started out that way we meaning him and
[1:43:28] the people and God and then somewhere
[1:43:30] along the way it changed from we to I
[1:43:32] look what I've done look what I've done
[1:43:35] now he's fixing to build and a wrecked a
[1:43:37] memorial right now for this battle that
[1:43:39] you can read oh to specify you the time
[1:43:41] but he's wanting to raise a memorial and
[1:43:44] he's wanting to build a great big
[1:43:46] Memorial of this battle that he has now
[1:43:48] won and he's looking at himself now look
[1:43:51] what I've done look what I've been boy
[1:43:53] I'll tell you one thing I have turned
[1:43:55] this thing around and my goodness it was
[1:43:57] in the office mess ever was I have done
[1:43:59] this and I have done that it always
[1:44:02] breaks my heart
[1:44:05] when I hear somebody go that way
[1:44:09] whether it's a preacher a deacon a
[1:44:12] trustee a singer a Sunday school teacher
[1:44:15] a housewife
[1:44:18] when they go to talking about them and I
[1:44:21] me and mine and you think oh no
[1:44:25] oh no not you
[1:44:28] not you
[1:44:30] why you've changed your view
[1:44:34] about yourself
[1:44:40] oh my goodness let me have a few more
[1:44:42] minutes and we'll pick it up again
[1:44:44] Lord God
[1:44:49] and the Lord sent thee chapter 15 verse
[1:44:52] 18.
[1:44:54] on a journey
[1:44:56] and he said go and utterly destroy the
[1:44:58] sinners
[1:44:59] the amalekites
[1:45:01] and fight against them until they be
[1:45:04] consumed
[1:45:06] wherefore
[1:45:08] then get us thou not obey the voice of
[1:45:11] the Lord
[1:45:13] but did us fly upon the spoil
[1:45:17] and that is evil in the sight of the
[1:45:19] Lord
[1:45:20] evil
[1:45:22] what what evil
[1:45:25] I mean they didn't molest women there
[1:45:26] wasn't molesting children they wasn't
[1:45:28] robbing banks
[1:45:31] evil what evil was it
[1:45:33] disobedience
[1:45:35] to the words of God's prophet
[1:45:42] now of course they didn't have a written
[1:45:44] bible and maybe saw a thought well you
[1:45:46] know what
[1:45:47] now according to the word in the book of
[1:45:48] Deuteronomy isn't everything supposed to
[1:45:51] be proven in the mouth of two or three
[1:45:52] Witnesses
[1:45:54] and I don't have two or three witnesses
[1:45:56] that verifies here what uh what Samuel
[1:45:58] has said
[1:46:00] you know Samuel's getting pretty old and
[1:46:02] maybe he's kind of getting grouchy and
[1:46:03] mean
[1:46:04] I mean what man in his right mind but
[1:46:06] tell a man to go out and kill youngins
[1:46:10] what man is right man what prophet what
[1:46:12] what prophet reflecting the love of God
[1:46:15] well tell me to go over and kill all the
[1:46:17] people
[1:46:18] and kill the babies and everything
[1:46:20] and kill all them fat cattle and them
[1:46:22] fat sheep
[1:46:25] oh I don't think
[1:46:27] I I personally don't think that quote
[1:46:31] is really necessary
[1:46:37] what if that one quote separates your
[1:46:41] soul
[1:46:43] from death
[1:46:46] and life
[1:46:47] heaven
[1:46:49] hell
[1:46:54] now he's not refuting that Samuel was
[1:46:56] God's Prophet watch how he takes us now
[1:46:58] and twists it
[1:47:00] and Saul said unto Samuel
[1:47:03] I have all bathed
[1:47:06] the voice of the Lord
[1:47:10] what
[1:47:15] and have gone the way which the Lord
[1:47:19] sent me
[1:47:23] my goodness
[1:47:25] now this man is so far gone
[1:47:28] he cannot even see how wrong he is
[1:47:36] God's Prophet told him to kill
[1:47:38] everything
[1:47:39] and do not flying on the spawn don't
[1:47:42] bring back one animal don't bring back
[1:47:44] one man kill everything dead
[1:47:49] but Saul says
[1:47:51] I brought back AJ
[1:47:57] why we brought the all these animals
[1:47:59] here
[1:48:00] we're going to sacrifice them to the
[1:48:02] Lord
[1:48:03] praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:48:05] thank you Jesus
[1:48:07] we're going to sacrifice them to the
[1:48:09] Lord but that's what we're going to do I
[1:48:11] just got that fresh from God
[1:48:13] praise the Lord that's what I feel led
[1:48:15] to do
[1:48:18] but God's Prophet said kill everything
[1:48:26] but Saul felt led will say
[1:48:29] or he had a dream
[1:48:33] or maybe got a word I don't doubt that
[1:48:37] I just wonder where the word come from
[1:48:42] and Saul said unto Samuel yay I have
[1:48:45] obey the force of the Lord I have done
[1:48:48] nothing wrong
[1:48:51] I talked to a Saul like this not long
[1:48:53] ago
[1:48:56] um
[1:48:58] yeah
[1:49:00] it's amazing to me when you show folks
[1:49:02] scriptures and quotes
[1:49:04] and they step right over the top of them
[1:49:06] and do what they're going to do anyway
[1:49:10] anything you can do me and Carol have a
[1:49:13] common saying around the house people's
[1:49:15] going to do what they want to do
[1:49:18] I don't care what you say you can
[1:49:20] prophesy in the name of the Lord you can
[1:49:22] speak in tongues over and you could do
[1:49:24] whatever they're going to do what
[1:49:25] they're going to do
[1:49:28] but the good side about that is so am I
[1:49:31] and I'm going to serve the Lord
[1:49:33] you do whatever you want to do okay
[1:49:38] I have gone the way which the Lord sent
[1:49:41] me and it brought Agate the king of
[1:49:43] amalek and have utterly destroyed their
[1:49:46] malachites
[1:49:49] but remember it didn't take but a couple
[1:49:51] of days for King agag to get with his
[1:49:54] wife
[1:49:55] and between this time
[1:49:57] and she became pregnant
[1:50:01] and this Offspring bore another and for
[1:50:03] another and then it winds up down in
[1:50:07] Persia
[1:50:09] in the time of Queen Esther
[1:50:12] remember his name
[1:50:15] remember his name Haman Brother David
[1:50:17] just preached about it
[1:50:19] so because he disobeyed God's prophet's
[1:50:23] word
[1:50:24] the children of Israel still dealing
[1:50:28] with this man if he would have carried
[1:50:31] it out to the latter that part of the
[1:50:33] story wouldn't have to be written come
[1:50:34] on children looking at me like you know
[1:50:36] what I'm talking about every one of us
[1:50:38] have let a gags live
[1:50:41] and then it causes us or our children or
[1:50:44] our grandchildren to still reap because
[1:50:46] of things that it would have cut the
[1:50:47] head off of that a gag would have been a
[1:50:50] whole lot better off and so were to some
[1:50:51] of our kids
[1:50:57] my goodness gracious
[1:51:03] I have utterly destroyed the amalekites
[1:51:07] his justification just overwhelms me
[1:51:12] he's standing right there in the face of
[1:51:15] the man that told him what to do and
[1:51:17] said I done what you said
[1:51:21] mom
[1:51:27] I haven't done anything wrong I am not
[1:51:30] to blame
[1:51:32] oh man you're getting all bent out of
[1:51:34] shape and stuffed torp off after all
[1:51:36] this stuff you ain't got no love in your
[1:51:37] heart Samuel
[1:51:38] let me go down and kill them kids
[1:51:41] how in the world could God tell the
[1:51:43] people of Israel kill them baby
[1:51:45] Canaanites kill them every one of them
[1:51:48] why because God knew a baby grows up to
[1:51:51] be an adult
[1:51:53] that's why God said don't spare the
[1:51:55] suckling or any of them tell them all
[1:52:01] you see he could not resist
[1:52:05] it was his pride
[1:52:08] this was a custom
[1:52:10] in their time
[1:52:12] that you would bring the king back
[1:52:15] and show your people
[1:52:18] what you did
[1:52:22] so instead of following the prophet of
[1:52:24] God's teaching
[1:52:26] he wanted to follow the tradition of the
[1:52:28] day
[1:52:31] I'm bringing hey gay back boy look at me
[1:52:34] look at this lead him on a leash or a
[1:52:36] chain look what I've done rah rah raw
[1:52:39] yay King Saul yay King Saul
[1:52:46] now watch him in verse 21.
[1:52:50] the people
[1:52:52] Talk of the spoil sheep and oxen
[1:52:55] the chief things which should have been
[1:52:58] utterly destroyed okay okay okay I amen
[1:53:01] the word they should have been destroyed
[1:53:04] but it wasn't my fault
[1:53:06] it was the people
[1:53:09] the people wanted me to do this
[1:53:14] what a leader
[1:53:16] a leader that follows what the people
[1:53:19] wants
[1:53:20] instead of what the word says Ah
[1:53:28] look at him he still can't take the
[1:53:30] blame can he
[1:53:31] so what's he doing blaming it on the
[1:53:34] people what my fault don't look at me
[1:53:38] and who are you the water boy
[1:53:42] you are the king
[1:53:45] all you have to do is say hey God's
[1:53:48] Prophet said we do it this way and that
[1:53:49] way and that way don't you bring them
[1:53:52] sheep don't you bring them cattle
[1:53:56] but instead
[1:53:57] the people
[1:53:59] the people
[1:54:01] the people don't want me to preach
[1:54:03] against sin anymore
[1:54:07] the people don't want me to preach
[1:54:09] against transgenders so
[1:54:11] I guess it came
[1:54:18] well if these people don't want me to
[1:54:20] I'm going to anyhow and if you vote me
[1:54:24] out I'll preach it on the side of the
[1:54:26] road
[1:54:29] I'm gonna follow what the people want I
[1:54:33] want to follow what the Holy Ghost wants
[1:54:35] oh my other people the people
[1:54:40] the people talk me into it well it was
[1:54:42] the people that pressured me it was the
[1:54:44] people and there's more of them than
[1:54:47] there was me
[1:54:48] I'm just after all King soul
[1:54:56] what an excuse
[1:54:58] for a leader
[1:55:02] but the people took of the small sheep
[1:55:04] and oxen the chief of the things which
[1:55:06] should have been utterly just told okay
[1:55:09] okay okay I agree I agree with you are
[1:55:11] you happy now
[1:55:17] but watch him throws this little
[1:55:19] religious tone in it
[1:55:21] to sacrifice unto the Lord
[1:55:24] thy God notice how he says that not my
[1:55:28] God
[1:55:30] thy God does this please you
[1:55:33] okay get off my case would you
[1:55:37] you're the prophet of the age all right
[1:55:39] all right all right
[1:55:42] so we're doing this so that the Lord
[1:55:44] your God will be happy okay you're good
[1:55:45] now
[1:55:48] look at his attitude friends
[1:55:51] what happens to his respect
[1:55:53] of the same man that took the crews of
[1:55:56] oil
[1:55:57] and anointed him
[1:55:59] went down his head run down his eyes and
[1:56:01] him sitting there quivering and shaking
[1:56:04] and the prophet said now you'll find
[1:56:06] your donkeys in such and such a place
[1:56:08] and you're going to meet some menstruals
[1:56:10] and they're going to do this and the
[1:56:11] Bible says the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:56:14] Saul and Saul swept off his clothes
[1:56:17] I prophesied naked
[1:56:20] all day long
[1:56:23] this guy was messed up on me
[1:56:27] and the people
[1:56:28] saw among the prophets
[1:56:33] I always felt sorry for this guy
[1:56:37] because he didn't know how
[1:56:40] to repent
[1:56:42] it's like he could not ever admit it
[1:56:46] I messed up big time
[1:56:50] it's my fault I'm so wrong please
[1:56:55] even when he tries to grab a hole to
[1:56:57] Samuel's garment out what's his attitude
[1:57:00] and he reaches and grabs a hold of it
[1:57:01] and what he does he tears it he said
[1:57:03] just as you tore my garment
[1:57:05] so God has torn the kingdom
[1:57:09] from you
[1:57:13] Lord God
[1:57:21] laughs
[1:57:23] now go and smite amalek
[1:57:25] this is what God told him first Samuel
[1:57:28] 15 3 and utterly destroy all they have
[1:57:31] and spare them not
[1:57:34] enslave both man woman infant
[1:57:38] and suckling
[1:57:40] this would have seemed terrible would it
[1:57:42] not I mean you're standing there as a
[1:57:43] soldier you're told by God
[1:57:46] to kill a baby
[1:57:50] you are told by a prophet of God to kill
[1:57:53] a three-year-old child
[1:58:00] it would have been brought to a very
[1:58:01] difficult question would it not Brothers
[1:58:03] everybody
[1:58:05] the keys both great
[1:58:07] brother Byron
[1:58:09] God's prophets had killed them all so
[1:58:11] you go into a house there's a man with
[1:58:13] eight kids
[1:58:14] first she killed him then you kill his
[1:58:16] wife
[1:58:17] he's got a 14 year old a 12 year old 11
[1:58:20] year old eight-year-old nine-year-old
[1:58:23] got one lady in the Cradle you mean to
[1:58:25] tell me you're gonna walk in there and
[1:58:27] kill those children
[1:58:30] if you believe his message
[1:58:35] you may cry later
[1:58:37] you may feel awful
[1:58:39] I don't believe these people were
[1:58:40] murderers you'll imagine the faces of
[1:58:43] some of these kids they saw brother Rob
[1:58:45] later
[1:58:48] sometimes it ain't easy
[1:58:51] carrying out God's will
[1:58:56] but looking at the other side of it
[1:58:59] to be lost
[1:59:00] I'd much rather carry it out and weep
[1:59:03] and cry later
[1:59:06] than to stand before God do you realize
[1:59:09] the compromising preacher is going to
[1:59:10] stand before God and it won't be saying
[1:59:12] no the next time it'll be God
[1:59:14] one preacher so sad and I said well
[1:59:16] other people didn't want me to preach
[1:59:18] this the people was the one that pressed
[1:59:19] me to do it the people wanted this and
[1:59:22] the people wanted that and the people
[1:59:23] wanted something else they wanted to go
[1:59:25] into an organization and they didn't
[1:59:26] want me to preach someone I was going to
[1:59:28] lose my job
[1:59:30] several years ago I started a church
[1:59:33] and that said search
[1:59:36] the pastor was in such a shape they
[1:59:39] didn't even have a right to be in the
[1:59:40] pulpit
[1:59:43] he'll actually got me run over three
[1:59:45] times picking me up at the airport and
[1:59:46] taking me to the hotel
[1:59:48] he wasn't even in shape physical shape
[1:59:51] to arrived Drive
[1:59:54] the Lord put it on my heart while I was
[1:59:56] there and I talked to him I said brother
[1:59:58] you don't need to pastor this church
[1:59:59] you're not you're not fit you're not
[2:00:01] capable
[2:00:02] you're just not capable
[2:00:05] his words were this brother Donny what
[2:00:08] will I do
[2:00:10] how will I make a living
[2:00:14] I said I'd rather be on the side of the
[2:00:16] road begging bread
[2:00:18] I said to me God will honor you
[2:00:21] God will honor you if you admit I could
[2:00:23] not do this I'm not serving the people
[2:00:25] his own family come and talk to me after
[2:00:28] I preach and sit outside in the dark for
[2:00:30] two hours after the service was over
[2:00:31] some of the Donnie we didn't help he
[2:00:33] cannot Pastor the church
[2:00:40] he called me about two months later and
[2:00:42] said I took your advice
[2:00:44] I signed up on Social Security
[2:00:50] that's the first picture I've ever
[2:00:52] talked out of preaching
[2:00:56] I don't mind telling you I fought hell
[2:00:58] after that
[2:00:59] you cannot imagine how that made me feel
[2:01:02] I thought God did I do the right thing
[2:01:05] yes I did the right thing because that
[2:01:07] man was not being the right kind of
[2:01:09] leader
[2:01:10] well we have to say things that are hurt
[2:01:12] yes
[2:01:19] the staff
[2:01:23] let's read
[2:01:25] verse 22 here first Samuel
[2:01:28] 15 Kenneth
[2:01:32] and Samuel said Health the Lord
[2:01:35] as great Delight
[2:01:38] in burnt offerings
[2:01:40] and sacrifices
[2:01:43] as in obeying the voice of the Lord
[2:01:46] and remember Samuel was a levite
[2:01:51] and a prophet
[2:01:53] so he was not doing away with the
[2:01:55] importance of sacrifice
[2:01:58] but he was showing
[2:02:00] if you don't obey God's word
[2:02:04] no matter how much you sacrifice
[2:02:07] you'll lose it
[2:02:09] can you imagine every woman preacher
[2:02:13] that prays and studies and labors and
[2:02:16] preachers
[2:02:18] when she walks before God
[2:02:20] expecting a reward
[2:02:23] she will lose every bit of it
[2:02:26] why she stepped over the top of the word
[2:02:29] and accepted a Feeling
[2:02:33] or as Harry and I knew a woman in
[2:02:35] Pentecost
[2:02:37] they kept feeling this pull to be a
[2:02:40] preacher
[2:02:43] and one night an angel
[2:02:45] walked into her room
[2:02:48] and took her Bible
[2:02:50] she set up in the bed
[2:02:52] and this Angel's presence
[2:02:55] and this Angel went over on her desk and
[2:02:58] got her Bible and handed her her Bible
[2:03:00] and said God had called her to preach
[2:03:09] now we all know it wasn't an angel of
[2:03:12] God
[2:03:14] I got a letter back on my desk and I
[2:03:16] noticed it was kind of strange because
[2:03:19] of return address was handwritten
[2:03:22] and the return name was Jesus Christ
[2:03:26] and the address was 777-1357
[2:03:32] so I thought oh boy another dear Donny
[2:03:36] letter
[2:03:37] letter
[2:03:40] except they was accusing me of saying
[2:03:42] something that I never did say and I
[2:03:44] thought now you know what if Jesus would
[2:03:46] have sent me this letter he wouldn't
[2:03:48] have told a big lie
[2:03:50] he'll tell the truth
[2:03:54] you can imagine what that woman did
[2:03:57] she started preaching
[2:04:02] why
[2:04:03] she took that experience
[2:04:06] over the word of God
[2:04:14] notice Samuel
[2:04:16] has the Lord as great Delight look at
[2:04:19] this word
[2:04:21] pleasure desire longing
[2:04:25] the good pleasure
[2:04:27] as the Lord is great and delight and
[2:04:29] burnt offerings as in obeying friends
[2:04:31] can you imagine the Delight we bring to
[2:04:34] the Lord Jesus
[2:04:36] when we just simply obey his word
[2:04:39] and Satan tries to make us think it's
[2:04:41] nothing you're nobody you're just a you
[2:04:43] obey his words you love him well brother
[2:04:45] Tony I make so many mistakes and what do
[2:04:48] you do after you make the mistakes you
[2:04:50] obey his word and repent
[2:04:52] and make it right so you're still
[2:04:54] obeying his word
[2:04:56] and Satan wants to make us sing we're
[2:04:58] nothing great we're not doing this and
[2:04:59] that it brings God such pleasure
[2:05:05] as in obeying the voice of the Lord be
[2:05:08] whole to obey
[2:05:10] is better than sacrifice
[2:05:14] and to hearken
[2:05:15] beautiful another beautiful word to hear
[2:05:18] be attentive heed pay attention
[2:05:22] listen
[2:05:24] to obey is better than sacrifice and to
[2:05:28] hearken than the fat of rams wow but
[2:05:32] look at the opposite of obedience
[2:05:35] for Rebellion
[2:05:37] is as the sin
[2:05:41] of witchcraft
[2:05:46] Rebellion is a sin of Witchcraft and
[2:05:49] stubbornness
[2:05:50] is as iniquity
[2:05:54] and idolatry
[2:06:00] my goodness so when we rebelled against
[2:06:03] God's word God's Prophet God's teaching
[2:06:06] I don't think we need that I don't think
[2:06:08] we have to do I don't think that's
[2:06:10] required you're rebelling you know
[2:06:13] offered's God hates that so bad
[2:06:15] because Satan is the originator of that
[2:06:19] I know you don't want to hear this but
[2:06:21] the reason we all find a problem with
[2:06:23] Rebellion is because we are a hybrid
[2:06:26] between Eve and Satan
[2:06:31] say Amen or don't say Amen don't really
[2:06:33] matter to me I know it's the truth
[2:06:34] anyhow
[2:06:36] that's why you fight rebellion and
[2:06:38] that's why God hates our Rebellion
[2:06:41] and stubbornness
[2:06:43] is as oh Lord as iniquity and idolatry
[2:06:49] because thou has rejected the word of
[2:06:53] the Lord
[2:06:54] he hath also rejected thee
[2:06:57] from being King
[2:07:00] something just as simple
[2:07:03] it's not killing everybody
[2:07:06] and leaving the Sheep
[2:07:08] that's simple he rejected the word of
[2:07:11] the Lord yeah
[2:07:13] he rejected the word of the Lord
[2:07:15] may God help us
[2:07:19] powerheads
[2:07:22] oh Lord God
[2:07:33] I mean if you'd like to be remembered
[2:07:34] tonight before the Lord
[2:07:38] o children
[2:07:41] remember me
[2:07:45] remember me
[2:07:48] that God will help me
[2:07:50] that I'll always be little
[2:07:53] in my own eyes
[2:07:56] help me that I'll always be submissive
[2:07:58] to him and
[2:07:59] desire to obey his word
[2:08:02] desire to be little
[2:08:05] Hallelujah
[2:08:07] where he can always use us
[2:08:11] and when he wants to be that way before
[2:08:12] God
[2:08:14] never thinking big of yourself and how
[2:08:16] important you are and
[2:08:18] there's only one big one Among Us that's
[2:08:20] the Lord Jesus
[2:08:24] Heavenly Father
[2:08:27] Lord God
[2:08:30] I pray and have mercy on us Jesus
[2:08:34] help us Lord that
[2:08:36] we don't never
[2:08:39] get that kind of attitude father that we
[2:08:42] think we are something and we're so
[2:08:44] important
[2:08:46] Lord God may we always belittle in our
[2:08:49] own eyes
[2:08:52] oh most of us
[2:08:54] no no we think would never be like
[2:08:56] Balaam and most of us wouldn't
[2:08:59] I wonder how many of us would be closer
[2:09:00] to being like Saul
[2:09:04] it would get lifted up because of this
[2:09:06] or that or the other
[2:09:08] how many singers around the message have
[2:09:10] we seen do it
[2:09:12] how many preachers
[2:09:15] get lifted up and they start out sincere
[2:09:18] and love the people who love God
[2:09:21] and it's sad I can't say I understand it
[2:09:23] but
[2:09:24] when many men get older when they get up
[2:09:26] in years
[2:09:28] that's when they get so goofed up
[2:09:30] it's just like they go nuts
[2:09:33] please Jesus Keep Us Lord
[2:09:36] keep us father
[2:09:40] may we never handle the Bible
[2:09:43] and handle your prophet's message
[2:09:46] the way Saul did
[2:09:49] Lord if we are wrong show us
[2:09:52] may we always have a teachable spirit
[2:09:56] or we can see when the word is preached
[2:09:58] that we can see where we're wrong and
[2:10:00] repent
[2:10:03] God help us that we won't be like Saul
[2:10:06] that we'll stand right there and say I
[2:10:07] have done no wrong
[2:10:10] it's not me that's wrong it's everybody
[2:10:12] else
[2:10:13] help us Jesus
[2:10:16] help us Lord God I pray
[2:10:20] oh Father we worship you tonight Lord
[2:10:24] come by this way tonight Lord Jesus
[2:10:26] would you I know this is not the type of
[2:10:28] service makes us want to jump and shout
[2:10:31] and rejoice in that way
[2:10:33] but Lord if he can do a work in our
[2:10:35] hearts we'll have something to jump and
[2:10:37] Shout about
[2:10:39] then we can jump higher because we're
[2:10:41] living High
[2:10:42] father we don't want to just jump and
[2:10:44] not live what we're jumping about
[2:10:46] but we want to be a people that are
[2:10:49] submissive humble Lord that we don't
[2:10:52] filter Through the Bible and filter us
[2:10:54] through the message well I don't like
[2:10:55] this part and I don't believe that's
[2:10:56] necessary and I don't think we need to
[2:10:58] teach that I don't think who are we
[2:11:00] anyway
[2:11:01] just think that we
[2:11:04] poor blind people would be able to teach
[2:11:07] God anything
[2:11:09] speak your word to us Lord
[2:11:12] David made many mistakes along the way
[2:11:16] but there's one great difference between
[2:11:18] David and Saul
[2:11:19] David knew how to repent
[2:11:22] he knew how to admit he was wrong he
[2:11:25] knew how to come to the spot or it took
[2:11:27] him a while the sin of Bathsheba boy
[2:11:30] once it struck his heart
[2:11:32] he's constant repentance Psalm after
[2:11:34] Psalm later and years on down the road
[2:11:37] is still recognizing what a wrong that
[2:11:39] he done
[2:11:41] Lord may we be like that may we be able
[2:11:43] to be shown the word and say I'm sorry
[2:11:46] brother you're right I did this wrong
[2:11:49] and I'm going to go back and I'll go
[2:11:51] right back to square one I'll do it
[2:11:54] right or I won't do it but somehow we
[2:11:56] get it in our mind that when we start
[2:11:58] something wrong even will work for you
[2:12:00] well it wasn't right exactly no this one
[2:12:02] right now but that's okay that's okay
[2:12:04] God understands we don't realize we're
[2:12:07] building this on a false Foundation
[2:12:10] Lord we don't want to build our new
[2:12:12] births on a foundation of just emotion
[2:12:15] we don't want to build it on a
[2:12:17] foundation well I I went down to the
[2:12:19] Altar and I I couldn't speak English
[2:12:21] very good anymore I believe I've got it
[2:12:23] we don't want that
[2:12:25] or do we want it to be a change in our
[2:12:27] soul
[2:12:28] if you want us to speak in tongues so be
[2:12:30] it Lord if we do you want us to prophesy
[2:12:32] so be it
[2:12:33] but we want to be changed Lord
[2:12:36] we don't want to just have Victory when
[2:12:38] we go to youth camps we don't want to
[2:12:39] have victory in special meetings we want
[2:12:41] to have Victory right in the middle of
[2:12:43] hell
[2:12:44] and experience a youth camp or an
[2:12:47] experience of a dedication service if it
[2:12:49] don't keep us through the middle of hell
[2:12:51] it wasn't a very good one if we can only
[2:12:53] shout in special meetings and can't
[2:12:55] shout whenever we're having a regular
[2:12:57] Church there's something wrong with what
[2:12:58] we got in special meetings
[2:13:00] Lord God we want to be able to praise
[2:13:02] your name when we don't feel nothing we
[2:13:04] want to be able to come to church and we
[2:13:06] don't feel one thing we want to be able
[2:13:08] to worship and sing and pray and read
[2:13:11] our Bibles and listen to tapes when it
[2:13:13] fills out you're a Million Miles Away
