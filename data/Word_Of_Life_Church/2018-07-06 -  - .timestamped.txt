[21:50] one day I came to him I was so thirsty I
[21:59] asked for water
[22:01] oh my throat was so dry
[22:07] he gave me water that I had never
[22:12] dreamed of but for this water my dear
[22:20] lord has to die
[22:25] he said I'd lose
[22:28] first yet he made balloons
[22:34] he said I thirst yet he made the scene I
[22:42] first said the king of the ages from his
[22:51] great thirst he brought water to me now
[23:01] there's a river it flows as clear as
[23:06] crystal and it comes from God's throne
[23:16] and LA River
[23:20] it was up inside me
[23:25] bringing mercy and life-giving love he
[23:34] said either
[23:37] first yet he made the river
[23:44] he said I thirst yet he made the sea
[23:53] I first said the king of the ages

[24:10] great first he brought water to me
[24:20] [Applause]
[24:21] [Music]
[24:24] [Applause]
[24:37] aren't you grateful he was so willing to
[24:40] do such a thing what a privilege we have
[24:45] we've got so much to be thankful for
[24:49] I've just been wondering this week this
[24:52] timeframe called
[24:53] thanks giving how many people have
[24:56] access spinach in thanks giving or if
[25:01] they spend it in aiding and shopping and
[25:03] drinking and all sorts of things as
[25:07] really nothing to do with giving thanks
[25:10] to the Lord I'm glad that God has a
[25:14] people that still know how to give
[25:17] thanks
[25:19] we don't wait one time a year I believe
[25:21] a real Christian has that something
[25:23] about them to give thanks to the Lord
[25:25] Jesus every day that they live don't
[25:29] have to be in church to do it you don't
[25:31] have to be sitting around the pastor
[25:33] it's just something in your heart that
[25:35] you realize he's done so many things for
[25:39] you and if it wasn't for his grace what
[25:41] would be tonight let me give you a
[25:44] little update on I had my procedure done
[25:48] on Monday probably most of you know
[25:49] about it and was able to come home
[25:52] Monday afternoon started passing a bunch
[25:55] of little tiny pieces of what used to be
[25:57] a big rock there's some rather
[26:08] intimidating about a kidney stone when
[26:10] you look in that little strainer and you
[26:11] said about 30 or 40 pieces of grains of
[26:14] sand and you think you are kidding me
[26:17] this thing has done this to me and all
[26:20] these people for six weeks little things
[26:25] can make a big difference

[26:30] Lord been feeling better

[27:13] that's just as important as having a
[27:16] need in your life let's open our hearts

[27:22] of every one of us every need that we
[27:25] have the conscience that we have and the
[27:29] unconscious needs that we have he's
[27:32] mindful of our sins of commission he's
[27:37] mindful of our sins of omission he's
[27:41] mindful of our needs that we are aware
[27:43] of he's just as mindful of the needs
[27:47] that we know nothing about tomorrow
[27:50] morning you may be facing the greatest
[27:52] trial of your life next week whenever it
[27:56] could be who knows what will happened to

[33:14] can be seated I'm going to read one
[33:18] quote for you here I'm going to preach
[33:23] tonight on the search for a true bride
[33:27] by Bramson the evening messenger in 63
[33:31] God has always counted character not
[33:33] members today we do vice-versa we count
[33:37] members good dress well payers instead
[33:39] of character Eliezer sweated out until
[33:42] he found sweated it out until he found
[33:43] character that's right who would he get
[33:46] and he trusted God character for what
[33:48] character for Isaac the bride which the
[33:51] church is the type of that was the
[33:53] natural seed
[33:54] Abraham this is the royal seat of
[33:55] Abraham if Elly's are the messenger
[33:58] hunting the bride and trying to find
[33:59] character if that man has come a
[34:01] messenger of the last day trying to find
[34:04] the Bride of Christ he will not look for
[34:06] a denominational membership he will look
[34:08] for a character that's willing watch a
[34:11] good character first then get her ready
[34:13] to meet Isaac this is this hope hope
[34:16] this is my favorite part after he found
[34:19] the character then he get her stand
[34:21] still long enough to listen to his
[34:24] message of Isaac I hope y'all don't mind
[34:29] me preaching a sermon I've already
[34:30] preached I preached this this past
[34:33] summer at her brother's church and I was
[34:37] telling brother Donnie back there I got
[34:38] to studying recently on this past month
[34:41] I didn't have any plans preaching
[34:43] anywhere but I try to study when I get a
[34:45] chance and I was studying on the life of
[34:48] the seed and held that the life of the
[34:52] seeds manifests itself through the word
[34:54] and in the power that is in that seed
[34:56] and if you look I got the reading seed
[35:00] is not heir to the shut and brother
[35:03] branham's brother branham's talking
[35:05] about when paul refers to Isaac and
[35:07] Ishmael in the Bible is a abraham's two
[35:09] children and he makes the comment that
[35:12] you know Paul saying that there was two
[35:17] sons that Abraham had he still been
[35:20] Abraham had three sons it took me a
[35:24] minute to digest that then I kept
[35:26] reading and he said that third son was
[35:29] Jesus Christ you know and I got to
[35:32] thinking the power that was in the gist
[35:35] in that natural seed the natural seed
[35:38] that that God looked at the Covenant
[35:40] seed of Abraham but God looked down at
[35:42] that see there's so much power someone's
[35:44] life in that seed he skipped all them
[35:46] generations between Isaac and Christ and
[35:48] said this is your third son but the part
[35:51] I looked at is that was the natural
[35:54] strain then Along Came Calvary
[36:00] God took that natural strain and turned
[36:04] it to a spiritual strength and he poured
[36:07] out the blood of the lamb on that seed
[36:10] the power and the life of that see don't
[36:13] even compare to what this spiritual seed
[36:16] has and I say that to say this I'm not
[36:20] preaching on that tonight but that's
[36:22] what I was going to preach on and I had
[36:25] this sermon and I prayed you know it
[36:31] just bared on my heart I had already
[36:33] preached it
[36:34] yes brother Darrell one time I go to eat
[36:36] with brother Darrell sometime I said
[36:37] brother girl is it okay to preach the
[36:40] same sermon somewhere else he said buddy
[36:45] I preached the same sermon to the same
[36:47] church twice before well that ain't too
[36:52] bad it's up at least it's not the same
[36:55] church so but I was praying about it in
[36:59] Monday night I was praying that this was
[37:01] just this sermon was just waiting on my
[37:03] heart just I don't I didn't know why it
[37:06] was weighing so heavy and I said Lord
[37:08] well next time I preach I'll preach it
[37:10] preach it again and brother Donnie takes
[37:11] me the next day so it was meant to be so
[37:17] there's only one problem I can never
[37:19] give it out like I get it so you'll get
[37:21] it and bits and pieces so we're looking
[37:25] at a leisure Abraham sends Ellie's were
[37:28] out on a on a mission to find a bride
[37:29] for Isaac first time I've read the
[37:32] scripture for you for years when he
[37:34] tells you go go get a bride for my son
[37:36] Isaac but do not go out here to the
[37:37] Canaanites go to my own people I want
[37:39] and I thought whoa this is not type of
[37:42] bride the brides of Gentile bride why is
[37:44] he sending it back to his own people and
[37:47] then I found a quote where brother
[37:49] Branham said the reason that was was
[37:53] that Jesus Christ will only accept the
[37:54] bride there's blood-related
[37:56] so she was typing him taking a bride
[38:01] back taking a bride from his own people
[38:04] because she was bred blood-related
[38:06] you've got to receive a blood
[38:08] transfusion before you become a bride
[38:10] and we look at you look at the message
[38:14] today you got people falling apart you
[38:16] got people falling in so many different
[38:17] places and we live in a world - where -
[38:22] the people of this world even people of
[38:23] this message I had somebody just tell me
[38:25] yesterday that the message preacher that
[38:28] leans more towards John 3:16 than
[38:31] anything you know it jump it you every
[38:36] promise that you accept and the Bible
[38:39] has to come through John 3:16 but you
[38:42] can't live on John 3:16 by itself and we
[38:45] got people I was talking to a lady at
[38:48] work one day we was talking about going
[38:49] to church and and she said well jesus
[38:53] loves me that's that's all I need and I
[38:56] knew she was she was she was referring
[38:57] to she was referring to John 3:16 and I
[39:00] don't need to go to church jesus loves
[39:02] me that's all I need I said what about
[39:05] when the Bible says forsake not together
[39:07] assemble yourselves together I mean she
[39:12] didn't even say out she'd say nothing
[39:13] she just shut me off and turned away
[39:15] like I wasn't even there but that's what
[39:19] people their message the bride of people
[39:20] today is John 3:16 for God so loved the
[39:22] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[39:24] that is the people the world and the
[39:28] people nowadays their support
[39:30] they're free they're taking that as
[39:32] their message to the bride they're
[39:34] taking that is as this is this is all I
[39:38] need for God so loved the world it gives
[39:40] you got sent on I'm saved um I can go do
[39:42] what I want now well you're right
[39:44] because that's what you want to do and
[39:47] as you as a laser goes to Rebecca's
[39:52] family of course you know the story how
[39:55] he prays their Lord if the right one
[39:58] comes Lord would she is a ask if I need
[40:01] water because she water my camels as
[40:04] well he didn't go there with the John
[40:09] 3:16 message he didn't go there for
[40:13] whoever wants to be Isaac's bride come
[40:15] out but that's what that's what people
[40:18] are leaning on they're leaning on that
[40:20] like they believe that that's what it is
[40:21] and so he goes there with a message
[40:28] basically let God Shore show me who it
[40:33] is I'm not gonna go there preaching to
[40:35] the family so he goes there and you know
[40:40] the story as it comes it's a similar
[40:45] thing today the 20th century when we had
[40:49] a L easier coming this day that was but
[40:54] the Branham was preaching the contest in
[40:57] 1962 and he referred to John 3:16 he
[41:05] said John 3:16 you start training for a
[41:07] fight it will get you on the floor
[41:11] you're on the floor
[41:13] John 3:16 got you in the fight so now
[41:16] what are you gonna fight with you're the
[41:18] Bride of Christ what are you going to
[41:20] fight with but BAM said then you have to
[41:23] train for the knockout punches
[41:30] we look at the people in the wilderness
[41:33] brother branham topped the rock when
[41:35] Moses smoked the rock and the water come
[41:37] out brother branham type that is John
[41:39] 3:16 how the Moses smoked the waters and
[41:43] the waters poured out everybody was fed
[41:46] everybody drank but they everyone
[41:49] perished there's going to take more than
[41:53] that word so as he comes as he comes to
[41:59] Rebecca's family and he comes to minute
[42:01] she does she accepts the eleazar's is
[42:06] the messenger and in the net she accepts
[42:07] I the way I like to look at it she
[42:10] watered the camels as she accepted the
[42:12] camels because brother branham typed him
[42:15] as the word but the Brenham said the
[42:18] beast the camel was a beast and the
[42:19] Beast represented power and the power
[42:21] towards the work so not only did she
[42:24] accept a messenger she accepted the word
[42:26] that the messenger brought and so he
[42:29] comes to her and after she accepts and
[42:33] he gives her the two of the earrings in
[42:35] the in the bracelets way in 10 shekels
[42:37] as he comes to her family her family
[42:44] notices the gifts that she's God and the
[42:47] messenger goes to her family to and
[42:49] preaches the same message to her family
[42:51] they'd appreciate her but what did they
[42:54] want they wanted the gifts that's all
[42:58] they could look at in the Bible and the
[43:00] Bible talks about Laban seeing or coming
[43:01] up to Rebecca what stands out most about
[43:04] that Scripture was he saw the gifts that
[43:07] Eliezer gave them that's what happened
[43:11] in our day but what people lost their
[43:14] focus of Isaac of Christ from the very
[43:19] start when they saw the gifts
[43:21] when they saw the miracles the healing
[43:24] the calling out that's where they place
[43:28] their emphases at was on the gifts and
[43:31] here's where the bride she's seen the
[43:36] owner of the gifts she's seen where the
[43:38] gifts came from where they get gifts
[43:39] belong and we and we look at the people
[43:43] back in that day you see when brother
[43:47] Branham was message started turned to
[43:49] the bride when brother Brandon booth
[43:50] brother Brandon said when he called it a
[43:52] third pool it's a calling out
[43:55] it's a pulling away then you had these
[43:59] ministers trying to take brother Branham
[44:01] to go get healing campaigns they even in
[44:05] the services you look back and listen to
[44:07] the seals brother Brian was telling in
[44:08] the seals when we get done here after
[44:10] after we preached his service hopefully
[44:12] we will have a have a healing line
[44:14] because that's what the people wanted
[44:16] and when it when it got less and less
[44:19] when the gifts didn't come like they did
[44:22] before they start following away and
[44:25] that's what that wasn't what Rebecca saw
[44:28] if you take the gifts that Rebecca had
[44:31] look at the gifts that Rebecca was given
[44:34] he gave her the bracelets he gave her
[44:36] the earrings and then they went into the
[44:38] tent sat with the family they gave her
[44:41] more precious jewels
[44:42] he gave jewels and precious gifts to the
[44:46] family so what did they say to him when
[44:49] he said I need to go I'm taking the
[44:53] bride go stay with us ten more days stay
[44:57] with us here with ten more days this
[44:59] wait a while as long as he was there the
[45:02] gifts were there as long as the gifts
[45:04] were coming they were satisfied as long
[45:07] as the gifts was coming they was never
[45:08] seeing the message of Isaac and here
[45:11] when you look at the people that in the
[45:14] last thing you look at the people now
[45:16] the people in the message why are they
[45:20] leaving
[45:20] they've been here 30 40 years you're not
[45:23] seeing the healing like you used to
[45:24] you're not seeing the souls saved like
[45:26] you used to
[45:27] you're seeing a message of correction
[45:30] you're seeing a message of preparation
[45:32] you see in a clothing of the bride
[45:34] it's not about you know speaking of
[45:39] tongues calling out and people rising up
[45:40] and you know everything is happy and
[45:42] getting a message of love every service
[45:45] everybody's coming in expecting to get a
[45:47] jewel sometimes you're gonna get a Brier
[45:51] sometimes you're gonna get a stick
[45:53] sometimes that's more than gold if you
[45:57] apply it in the right way so what does
[46:04] what does that leisure tell Rebecca we
[46:08] know he didn't go with the John 3:16
[46:10] message but John 3:16 says for God so
[46:16] loved the world that He gave His only
[46:18] begotten Son for the world the cosmos
[46:21] everybody for God would have no man
[46:24] perish so he gives so what is John 15
[46:29] the same the same man that wrote John
[46:30] 3:16 in John 15 9 19 says if you were of
[46:34] the world the world would love his own
[46:36] but because you are not of the world
[46:40] this is the message that el easier takes
[46:43] to Rebecca you're not of the world but I
[46:45] have chosen you out of the world
[46:47] therefore the world hated you hey if you
[46:51] ride you're not gonna fit in
[46:55] you're not gonna lie I've told my boys
[46:56] going to school don't try to fit in no
[46:59] matter how you try to if your seed I
[47:01] don't care how you try to fit in
[47:03] you ain't gonna fit in hey that Holy
[47:07] Ghost is going to make sure you don't
[47:08] fit in I don't care how hard you try
[47:12] many tells room you are a chosen
[47:14] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[47:15] nation a peculiar people that's why they
[47:18] hate you because you're peculiar that
[47:20] you show fourth praises of him who have
[47:21] called you out of darkness into his
[47:23] marvelous light those verses those
[47:26] chapters without John 3:16 they're
[47:29] nothing you can't have those without
[47:31] John 3:16 but you can't have John 3:16
[47:36] without having those if you're bright
[47:38] it's part of it just a few more verses
[47:44] here this is Eleazar preaching there
[47:47] Rebecca you could take it for your day
[47:48] you can take it for Rebecca's day
[47:51] whatever you want to do according to he
[47:54] have chosen us in him before the
[47:56] foundation of the world that we should
[47:57] be holy and without blame before him and
[47:59] love having predestinated us unto the
[48:01] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[48:03] himself according to the good pleasure
[48:05] of his will
[48:06] visions 5 and 27 that he might present
[48:08] to himself a glorious church not having
[48:11] spot or wrinkle or any such thing that
[48:14] they should be holy and without blemish
[48:17] you say Billy Joe I'm bright I don't
[48:20] have no spots sometimes people can't see
[48:24] their spots because they got so many
[48:25] wrinkles wrinkles hide spots
[48:32] I've said this before I probably haven't
[48:34] said it here you have people that think
[48:36] that tenure puts him in the bride I've
[48:39] been here 20 30 40 years I've been
[48:41] following this message that's the big
[48:42] cliche I've been following the message
[48:44] for 20 30 40 years that's that's your
[48:47] problem you've been following it
[48:49] everyone that followed the pillar fire
[48:51] out of out of Egypt perished because
[48:54] they followed it you have to become what
[48:56] you're following you have to get into
[48:58] what you're following you can't follow
[49:01] the message you can't follow the
[49:03] messages expect to be saved you're just
[49:05] following around what you all you're
[49:06] doing is eating dust because the message
[49:10] is kicking up the dust variety dust
[49:16] whether Bram said at Thomas decision
[49:18] wonder why Rebecca came before any other
[49:19] other girls this is what I said before
[49:21] while she was blood relation did you
[49:23] know that Rebecca and Isaac were cousins
[49:25] the bride of Jesus Christ is blood
[49:28] relation to him a blot of the blood
[49:30] brought by bride no wonder she was led
[49:33] by the spirit there was a connection
[49:34] coming together there was a union coming
[49:37] together blood relation with Jesus
[49:42] Christ now let's look at the journey
[49:46] after she receives the gifts they tried
[49:50] to get him to stay and he says I'm
[49:52] leaving today
[49:54] the bride's leaving I'm calling out the
[49:56] bride that was the message in this last
[49:58] day I'm calling out the bride just so
[50:03] you're not confused
[50:04] I'm brother Branham left the scene
[50:06] Eliezer didn't the same calling in the
[50:11] fivefold ministry is the call of El
[50:13] easier topic to Rebecca it's the same
[50:16] call then as it was when brother Branham
[50:18] came on the scene you know when you when
[50:23] you look at it now you you wonder why
[50:25] you don't see as many people at the
[50:27] altar you don't see so many people given
[50:29] their lives you see people are not
[50:30] coming to church but on Sundays anymore
[50:32] you know you know people get heartbroken
[50:35] that I don't cuz I know it's almost over
[50:40] there's fewer coming in
[50:43] the fewer they're coming in demeans the
[50:46] next one could be the last warm it's
[50:49] almost over
[50:50] the bride the marriage is already done
[50:53] okay some of you thinking hey we're
[50:56] gonna get married that part's already
[50:57] over in 50 1953 in Owensboro Kentucky
[51:01] brother Branham it was in 53 when
[51:02] brother banner first used the term mist
[51:04] Jesus Christ so it's over the merits has
[51:07] already happened she's producing she's
[51:10] bringing forth a son called Jesus Christ
[51:17] so if she leaves the camel train heads
[51:20] out we look at Rebecca she takes her
[51:23] gift she's got these gifts what does she
[51:25] do with hers I'm sure the family
[51:26] stockpiled theirs they used it to get
[51:31] hey I got a gift from the Prophet I got
[51:35] a belt buckle he prayed for me and I got
[51:37] healed
[51:39] how how many of remember brother banner
[51:41] talking about that young lady over an
[51:43] act in Kentucky that was dying and he's
[51:45] talking about you couldn't even lay a
[51:46] bedsheet on her and talked about her
[51:49] sister running down the hill screaming
[51:51] after she got healed I met that woman
[51:53] that the one that was coming down her
[51:57] sister she had blue jean shorts on
[51:59] smoking cigarettes she accepted a gift
[52:06] that's all that mattered
[52:08] she accepted a gift she missed the
[52:12] picture the Eleazar was painting every
[52:17] gift that was given look at every gift
[52:19] was given where'd it come to come from
[52:20] the father it came from Isaac if you
[52:23] read that chapter on Abraham and Isaac
[52:26] it refers to Abraham and it refers to
[52:29] Isaac as his master so all these gifts
[52:34] that they were getting came from Isaac
[52:36] and they did not realize where it came
[52:38] from if they didn't care they were
[52:40] richer that's been what people want what
[52:43] does Rebekah do with her gifts she takes
[52:46] him back to the word the camels she
[52:50] takes her gifts and climbs on the word
[52:52] it takes him right back to where they
[52:55] came from
[52:58] so they go on the journey they're going
[53:01] on this journey back to be dyes it
[53:04] I'd love to been a fly on a camel
[53:07] listening to Eliezer tell her about
[53:10] Isaac
[53:14] I've always wondered I guess because I
[53:18] don't I don't question my position in
[53:21] the bride for me God was real that to me
[53:24] is I'm standing here I no longer
[53:27] question that and being in that position
[53:31] and those of you that are I hope we all
[53:33] are consider yourself a member of the
[53:36] bride how could you hear the message the
[53:42] picture that el easier of this day
[53:45] painted of Jesus Christ and wants
[53:49] something else wants something different
[53:52] and no no doubt is they went on the
[53:56] journey the hell easier begin to talk to
[53:59] her and tell her about his master always
[54:04] they is they kept going you begin to
[54:08] explain what do you look like his
[54:11] mannerisms how much land he had how tall
[54:16] he was how he liked address what do you
[54:21] like to eat he would explain it to her
[54:24] and they would stop as she would say oh
[54:26] hi ELISA kill me simple
[54:31] it would stop to feed the camels el
[54:35] easier tell me some more they would stop
[54:39] to camp for the night el easier tell me
[54:46] more about Isaac they would be ready to
[54:50] lay down and she said hey leader don't
[54:51] don't stop talking
[54:54] don't stop describing it to me she fell
[55:00] in love with him before she ever saw him
[55:01] you can't say you've never seen him
[55:08] because this message has painted a
[55:11] picture so clear when you see him you'll
[55:14] know exactly who he is
[55:16] there'll be no doubt there'll be no
[55:19] doubt here he is but a laser is painting
[55:23] this picture to her and she's she don't
[55:26] see the gifts she still has them she
[55:30] don't think about him they're there but
[55:34] all she can think about is Isaac but the
[55:43] random talks about the story of Rebekah
[55:49] and Isaac how the random says in
[55:51] Redemption by judgment a beautiful story
[55:54] of Rebekah and how she got on the camel
[55:55] and went to meet Isaac with Eliezer and
[55:58] Isaac being the type of Christ the Son
[56:00] of God which was the son of Abraham who
[56:02] fell heir to all Abraham's Goods and all
[56:05] he had he was out in the field the
[56:07] evening time wandering around the field
[56:10] when he saw the beautiful Rebecca coming
[56:12] on candle on a camel but BAM said oh my
[56:15] that makes heels go through me the
[56:18] beautiful Rebecca he'd never seen her he
[56:20] never knew who she was but Eleazer was
[56:22] hunting her up and he found her by the
[56:24] witness the holy spirit said when
[56:28] Rebecca come to water the camels which
[56:30] was a sign that she was willing to go
[56:31] and got on the camel and went to me when
[56:34] he was out in the field halfway from the
[56:35] father's house when Rebecca saw Isaac
[56:39] she veiled her face she jumped off the
[56:42] camel and run to meet him it was love at
[56:43] first sight
[56:44] I don't know what he's gonna look like
[56:46] he may be a big man he made me a little
[56:48] man
[56:48] he may be brown he may be wide he may be
[56:51] black I don't know what color will be
[56:52] what kind of hair light what color eyes
[56:54] he'll be but I love him I don't care
[56:56] what he looks like I love him yes sir
[56:59] the church will love him and reading
[57:04] then I got the brother branham goes on
[57:08] to say he says he's on the road now he
[57:10] says I believe he's left the ivory
[57:12] palaces coming to town to receive his
[57:14] bride that was in 54 my brother Brandon
[57:19] believed that then where are we at now
[57:22] where what position are we on the bride
[57:25] are we dressed are we fully dressed you
[57:28] got a button undone somewhere is your
[57:31] veil not properly arranged there's your
[57:34] wedding dress not him the right way
[57:42] looking at how people back in that day
[57:45] brother Branham was here you know how
[57:48] much he loved God you know how much he
[57:50] loved the word I mean brother Branham he
[57:53] made no bones about Christ being the
[57:56] love of his life
[57:57] in the way he could paint a picture of
[57:59] him how he could explain him and people
[58:03] not want it and you got people now in
[58:06] this message that are falling away from
[58:08] this message trying to point it to
[58:10] humanity of ele easier looking at a
[58:13] man's humanity and putting the focus on
[58:16] that because a bridge vision that he had
[58:21] they can't find proof of it last time I
[58:26] read God said that Elijah was gonna know
[58:29] it J Hugh but I don't think that's what
[58:30] happened
[58:32] does that make God not God you say well
[58:37] brother Joe do you believe the bridge
[58:38] absolutely just like he said it
[58:43] but that's not part of the word that was
[58:48] there for somebody for some reason but
[58:52] that's not to me I'm not eating that I
[58:54] believe it with everything that's in me
[58:56] that's not on my plate that's not what
[58:59] I'm eating I'm eating the word I'm
[59:00] eating Jesus Christ that's just a
[59:03] picture in the dining room in my book
[59:04] it's part of the setting for some reason
[59:07] it's there but what I'm looking at is
[59:11] the picture that he painted the meal
[59:16] that he prepared me in Jesus Christ I'm
[59:20] not gonna look at his humanity I was
[59:23] talking to a friend of mine I came to
[59:25] visit here a few months ago and he was
[59:27] telling me but several years ago him and
[59:29] his father went to I believe it was
[59:31] brother banks wood that lived beside
[59:32] brother Branham if I'm not mistaken they
[59:36] went to visit brother banks son David
[59:40] and he said they were sitting there
[59:42] talking to him for a while and so David
[59:44] told him said that one afternoon he said
[59:49] brother Branham came walking down the
[59:50] sidewalk was just weeping just sobbing
[59:53] and brother banks like brother Brandon
[59:56] what's wrong he said I believe God's
[59:58] gonna take me he said brother Brandon
[1:00:02] what are you talking about he said I
[1:00:03] believe God's going to take me he said
[1:00:05] why wait something he said they believe
[1:00:07] I'm God and it killed brother Branham
[1:00:12] they just killed him to think that I
[1:00:14] preached I preached this picture of
[1:00:17] Isaac I've pitched this picture picture
[1:00:20] of Jesus Christ for so long and they
[1:00:22] think I'm preaching me they think I'm
[1:00:25] painting a picture of myself
[1:00:28] and he said brother branham said but it
[1:00:32] ain't the amount of hair he said it's my
[1:00:33] closest friends it's the ones that were
[1:00:36] around him every day
[1:00:37] it's the ones he ate with the ones he
[1:00:39] hunted with they thought he was God and
[1:00:43] it just killed brother branham to think
[1:00:45] that look at look at Rebecca where does
[1:00:51] she meet him at she met him in the field
[1:00:54] but we you know the scripture will meet
[1:00:56] him in the air we won't meet him in
[1:00:58] heaven we won't meet him in there and I
[1:01:00] like that time the biggest message I
[1:01:05] want to get to you in talking to you
[1:01:07] about Rebecca was she didn't go looking
[1:01:10] for a Bryan
[1:01:11] Bob ride girl she wasn't looking once
[1:01:14] she was going through her daily chores
[1:01:15] she was going to get water to cook with
[1:01:20] to drink to do the dishes her daily
[1:01:23] routine that's what she was doing and
[1:01:25] she run into the messenger you can't say
[1:01:31] I came searching for a bride like a
[1:01:33] bragger if you didn't search nothing you
[1:01:35] didn't search for anything but we sing
[1:01:37] that song up here the more I seek Him
[1:01:39] that song was true but you can only seek
[1:01:43] him after you're found and I'm going to
[1:01:47] change this picture here a little bit
[1:01:48] I'm gonna go to Ruth this is my favorite
[1:01:52] story in the book if you want to call it
[1:01:53] story blessed hi brother Tim Burnett was
[1:01:56] here but Tim said something he was
[1:01:58] preaching on I don't remember what it
[1:01:59] was was a certain strain of his that he
[1:02:02] preached on that more than anything and
[1:02:05] the bride is my strain I guess because
[1:02:08] it's it talks about me and I don't I
[1:02:13] don't know why but there ain't nothing
[1:02:14] that pulls the strings of my souls like
[1:02:17] seeing myself in a book but look at Ruth
[1:02:24] Ruth according to historians
[1:02:28] her and Oprah Oprah was the daughter of
[1:02:31] King Eglon of Moab
[1:02:38] you know the story her husband dies May
[1:02:42] long dies Chilean dies
[1:02:45] Oprah's corpus husband Naomi's husband
[1:02:50] is dead so she's going back to the
[1:02:51] homeland
[1:02:55] Ruth is not about to leave her no matter
[1:02:59] what I used to think it when I heard
[1:03:03] that when I was younger I didn't read
[1:03:06] much I was ticked for what people said
[1:03:08] that Naomi typed the church as far as
[1:03:12] the world church and I got the reading
[1:03:16] when I got stay brother Brandon said
[1:03:18] that she typed though Jewish gospel she
[1:03:20] was the gospel that brought the Gentile
[1:03:23] bride in and I just had done something
[1:03:26] for me I just it's just it was a picture
[1:03:29] of a Gentile bride clinging to that word
[1:03:32] just saying I'm not going anywhere
[1:03:35] I'm gonna go where you go I'm gonna I'm
[1:03:37] gonna do what you do that's hanging on
[1:03:39] to that word that's all she wanted but
[1:03:43] she didn't go looking for a bridegroom
[1:03:46] we always wonder as she come out I'm
[1:03:53] gonna read this real quick sorry I'm
[1:03:54] chopping things up I apologize Naomi now
[1:03:58] the type of the Jewish Church Ruth the
[1:04:00] type of the Gentile church notice now
[1:04:03] here she comes back see Ruth being a
[1:04:05] Gentile heathen worshiper she looked
[1:04:07] back and said I'll go with you where you
[1:04:09] live I'll live where you die I'll die
[1:04:11] where you're buried I'll be buried let
[1:04:13] your God be my god that's the Gentile
[1:04:16] church accepting salvation through Jesus
[1:04:18] Christ our Lord what a beautiful picture
[1:04:20] Bodrum says I wish we had more time on
[1:04:25] the inside brother Branham says she said
[1:04:28] let your people will be my people
[1:04:29] let me live where you live let me die
[1:04:31] were you dying let me be buried where
[1:04:33] you're buried let your God be my god
[1:04:34] beautiful picture of the young Gentile
[1:04:36] church coming in by the old Jewish
[1:04:38] Church the Jews had packed the gospel
[1:04:41] first
[1:04:44] the thing that always stood out to me
[1:04:46] was when she said let's your God be my
[1:04:48] god you and I got to study in this and
[1:04:51] I've had these notes most of these notes
[1:04:53] for about a year
[1:04:54] I got there's something that stood out
[1:04:57] to me and here's a Gentile woman a MOBOT
[1:05:01] woman tell Naomi let your God be my god
[1:05:06] but I got to think of that what Ruth
[1:05:09] didn't realize she was gonna bring forth
[1:05:13] the very God in flesh
[1:05:15] Naomi's God in flesh she didn't know
[1:05:19] what she was saying
[1:05:20] Naomi's God was going to become her God
[1:05:23] in more ways than she ever thought I
[1:05:26] thought Lord let that be in us let us
[1:05:32] produce the God the God of our life you
[1:05:37] know we we hear that song we sing that
[1:05:39] song he became me that that I could
[1:05:42] become him you know anything it becomes
[1:05:45] words it becomes words you say hey Bill
[1:05:50] how could it become words look at your
[1:05:53] actions are you doing what your God
[1:05:56] would do are you going where your God
[1:05:58] would go she comes to a strange land
[1:06:03] there's just something about a Naomi
[1:06:06] that she can't leave coming to - Naomi
[1:06:10] she's coming to a strange land she's
[1:06:11] coming to a strange people but they
[1:06:14] don't shun her as a Gentile they were
[1:06:16] they were considered dogs which was
[1:06:21] pretty much a good sign that these were
[1:06:24] godly people she goes to a field - to
[1:06:30] glean she's poor she lived to everything
[1:06:34] she had her dad was a king but she gave
[1:06:38] it all up for the God of Naomi what
[1:06:42] brings her to the field when I got
[1:06:45] stainless I wonder what brought Ruth to
[1:06:47] the field did glean but ask yourself
[1:06:52] that question those that were saved were
[1:06:55] we're not
[1:06:57] morning the message what brought you to
[1:07:01] the field of the word you can't say I
[1:07:04] was searching for something
[1:07:06] because you weren't it was a hunger Ruth
[1:07:11] was hungry that's what brought you this
[1:07:15] word there was there's that seed that's
[1:07:17] inside of you but when you take your
[1:07:18] first breath of life that's seed that
[1:07:20] gets dropped down in there a live seed
[1:07:23] hungers it's got to have nourishment or
[1:07:27] it'll die
[1:07:28] there's nourishment and there's
[1:07:32] qualities in water that you can't that
[1:07:36] the seed has to take to grow and so Ruth
[1:07:40] was hungry she wasn't looking to get
[1:07:43] married she was going to get food that's
[1:07:47] that's what brought you here you you
[1:07:49] were looking for something to eat you're
[1:07:51] eating the rotten corn of denominations
[1:07:54] you're eating molded food in
[1:07:56] denominations and that seed wasn't
[1:08:00] wasn't gathering nourishment but here
[1:08:03] she comes to a field she steps in this
[1:08:05] field and she don't know it when God's
[1:08:06] eyes she owns it all you didn't know
[1:08:09] what when you came here you didn't know
[1:08:11] what when you came into the word that
[1:08:12] everything that you're standing on
[1:08:14] everything you're eating belongs to you
[1:08:16] anyway she couldn't see that all she
[1:08:20] knew she had a hunger that's why you see
[1:08:24] people come and leave they come into
[1:08:26] this world with ulterior motives
[1:08:28] they come in with with an agenda they're
[1:08:32] not hungry some of them come in because
[1:08:35] they they think hey there's some wealthy
[1:08:37] people there I can rub shoulders with
[1:08:39] him we'd be buddies and this that the
[1:08:41] other it don't work that way you should
[1:08:44] have one thing on your mind is to eat
[1:08:48] I'm gonna eat that's what hungry people
[1:08:51] do they so that's what Ruth was doing
[1:08:54] she was hungry and I got I got to look
[1:08:57] in it at the gleaning the people that
[1:08:59] glean I did a search on on historical
[1:09:03] search on the people that glean back in
[1:09:05] there
[1:09:06] it's real vague during a whole lot of
[1:09:08] stuff because the poor people back in
[1:09:12] that day the poor people would allow
[1:09:13] them to glean after the the Gleaners
[1:09:17] would go forward the reapers would go
[1:09:18] forth they would they would cut the the
[1:09:20] stalks off down low they would bundle
[1:09:22] them up in sheaves and as they bundle
[1:09:26] them they're stomping moving around
[1:09:27] walking around stuff is falling off the
[1:09:30] sheaves some stuff don't get caught but
[1:09:32] it leaves a little stubble about that
[1:09:34] high little sharp stubbles and you got
[1:09:38] to crawl around in that the sheaves fall
[1:09:42] down to the pieces of barley and part of
[1:09:45] the stock and part of the tassel will
[1:09:46] fall down the ground it gets stomped by
[1:09:47] the Reapers so these Gleaners have to
[1:09:50] come in and pick that out why do you
[1:09:53] think Boaz told him to drop some
[1:09:55] handfuls for her she wasn't getting
[1:09:57] enough she wasn't getting much but if I
[1:10:02] came for a minute I want I want to paint
[1:10:04] a little picture here of Ruth gleaning
[1:10:09] she comes to the field of he knows she
[1:10:12] asked the servant can I clean in the
[1:10:15] field he tells her to go ahead
[1:10:19] she's journeyed a long time she has
[1:10:21] nothing she's poor she's hungry she
[1:10:27] needs something to eat the season but
[1:10:31] there is a dry season they reaping it
[1:10:34] when the season gets dry the barter gets
[1:10:36] dry the ground is dry and dusty she gets
[1:10:39] on her hands and her knees she's
[1:10:41] crawling through sharp stubble she's
[1:10:44] digging in the dust for little pieces of
[1:10:46] barley it's the heat of the day because
[1:10:51] their servant toboe as she's repear
[1:10:53] almost all day and only just now took a
[1:10:55] break so she's sweating she wipes her
[1:10:59] brow with her dirty hands
[1:11:03] what do you think bull ass saw when he
[1:11:05] walked up in that field no doubt she's
[1:11:13] getting scratched she's not only getting
[1:11:16] a handful cuz everything she's getting
[1:11:18] she's digging out of the dirt but Boaz
[1:11:23] walks by and he sees this little lady
[1:11:26] down on her knees dirty scratched her
[1:11:30] face dirty well she's wipe the sweat off
[1:11:32] with her dirty hands and she stops him
[1:11:35] in a track in his tracks that's exactly
[1:11:41] what God saw when he saw you you were
[1:11:44] dirty you were nothing you were digging
[1:11:48] it for everything you could get your
[1:11:51] life had reached bottom there was
[1:11:54] nowhere else for you to go you were
[1:11:55] starving to death and you crawl down on
[1:11:58] your knees to pick a piece of barley
[1:12:00] piece of barley called the word out of
[1:12:04] the dirt I was born in this message but
[1:12:10] I know a lot of people that came in and
[1:12:12] you people that came from different
[1:12:15] denominations you can't tell me the
[1:12:16] first time you heard that word satisfied
[1:12:19] something in you that you never never
[1:12:22] had Ruth's expected to go glean corn she
[1:12:25] said I'm gonna go get some corn that's
[1:12:27] all she never ate she didn't know what
[1:12:30] barley was all she ever ate was
[1:12:32] denominational corn she gets into a
[1:12:36] field she's crawling around and then the
[1:12:40] lord of the harvest walks into the field
[1:12:41] to look at her he walks by just say he's
[1:12:51] walking by and he looks over he stops
[1:12:54] well who's that Oh Lord that's Jean taro
[1:13:03] he's been here all day he's gleamed
[1:13:06] since morning
[1:13:08] he hasn't went to another field but he
[1:13:12] looked at brother Jean and fell in love
[1:13:13] with him and his dirty sinful fleshly
[1:13:19] humanity condition if you can't see
[1:13:24] yourself in truth you need to go back
[1:13:26] you need to pray you're through and go
[1:13:28] back and read it again but Ruth is she
[1:13:33] don't see him coming she want to satisfy
[1:13:36] that hunger but what was he was
[1:13:40] searching that day I was telling brother
[1:13:44] Donnie back there earlier I read some
[1:13:46] what they call a Midrash it's the
[1:13:51] rabbi's back in the second century took
[1:13:55] the old Jewish scroll was and start
[1:13:57] explaining them he's talking about
[1:14:03] Boaz and and Ruth and they they claimed
[1:14:07] that the day that Ruth and Naomi got to
[1:14:10] Bethlehem the people that met her met
[1:14:14] them the people of the city that met
[1:14:16] them were coming from the funeral of his
[1:14:19] wife
[1:14:21] so Boaz he was searching he needed
[1:14:27] somebody to carry on his name that was
[1:14:31] the same back then you had to have heirs
[1:14:35] but here there's something about her
[1:14:39] through the sweat through the dust
[1:14:41] through the dirt he looks at her and he
[1:14:43] falls in love with her and the Bible
[1:14:45] says the result there's kind of all
[1:14:46] kinds of maidens in the field not one of
[1:14:48] them moved him not one of him could turn
[1:14:53] the eye of Boaz but he fell in love with
[1:14:58] her so what does he tell his servants
[1:15:00] brother branham citizenry Demers
[1:15:01] redemption he said to the servants you
[1:15:03] see that young lady right there behind
[1:15:05] you yes sir let the gleaning be heavy
[1:15:08] every once in a while I'll drop a
[1:15:10] handful on purpose I love those handfuls
[1:15:13] don't you
[1:15:15] gleaning behind the Reapers drop a
[1:15:17] handful on purpose that she could get it
[1:15:18] how Ruth felt when she grabbed a handful
[1:15:21] said the Reaper turn around said that's
[1:15:23] alright that's alright you can have it
[1:15:27] you're not still picking up pieces you
[1:15:32] own the field you can get all you want
[1:15:34] you can get all you want when the day
[1:15:38] was over she beat out all her wheat and
[1:15:40] put it in her apron and took it to her
[1:15:41] mother-in-law her mother-in-law advised
[1:15:42] her if you want to find out how to do
[1:15:46] Paul said after giving in Hebrews 10 the
[1:15:48] chapter of faith now seeing that were
[1:15:49] compassed about with a great cloud of
[1:15:51] witnesses let us lay aside every sin and
[1:15:54] run the race this patient is set before
[1:15:55] us lay aside every weight and the sin
[1:15:57] rather so easily beset us and run with
[1:15:59] patience so she goes to nail me and in
[1:16:04] my notes here I got her parentheses the
[1:16:06] gospel because every time she goes back
[1:16:10] to Naomi
[1:16:11] Naomi's advising or something this is a
[1:16:14] gospel telling her what to do she says
[1:16:17] don't you leave that field don't you
[1:16:20] leave this word you stay right here in
[1:16:22] this world since when the maidens go out
[1:16:25] you go with them don't be tossed about
[1:16:28] with every wind of doctrine you stay in
[1:16:30] Boaz's field and she stayed in Boaz this
[1:16:32] field to the harvest was over I'd say
[1:16:37] after Ruth was noticed by Boaz I'd say
[1:16:44] he came to the field every day and
[1:16:47] stayed as long as he could he wasn't
[1:16:51] going to miss it
[1:16:52] he was going to make sure that he saw
[1:16:56] Ruth in the field that's no different
[1:16:59] than your God tonight every service he
[1:17:03] comes here and he waits for you to walk
[1:17:05] in
[1:17:07] he stands up here his heart beating out
[1:17:11] of his chest for you to walk through
[1:17:13] that door and if you don't come his
[1:17:18] feelings don't change from the next
[1:17:19] service you'll wait and wait for you for
[1:17:25] the brain of sitting in silent well my
[1:17:29] mom won't wait on that
[1:17:32] Boaz finds out Ruth finds out I'm sorry
[1:17:37] that Boaz is next to key in the Naomi
[1:17:39] tells her what to do go to the threshing
[1:17:41] room floor lay at his feet find him
[1:17:42] go in there and find him reading some of
[1:17:48] the biblical figure lotions of today
[1:17:54] they claimed that she was going in there
[1:17:59] so he would lay with her I thought you
[1:18:02] know that's just the devil's perversion
[1:18:04] right there but the random said she laid
[1:18:08] at his feet to show that he trusts she
[1:18:09] trusted him and a type of throwing his
[1:18:13] skirt over was the type of the Holy
[1:18:14] Spirit I thought Lord people just do
[1:18:19] anything they can to pervert the word so
[1:18:23] Boaz tells Ruth I'll do whatever is
[1:18:25] required of me whatever it cost I'm
[1:18:28] gonna do of course you know the story
[1:18:31] how he goes outside the gate he goes
[1:18:37] outside the gate and with the next of
[1:18:41] kin and the little parlay they have out
[1:18:45] there and he says yeah I'll redeem
[1:18:47] Naomi's as well that day you redeemed
[1:18:48] Naomi you'll have to buy Ruth he said
[1:18:51] well I can't do that I'll Mar my own
[1:18:52] testimony then one scripture brother
[1:18:54] branham said he threw his shoe at him
[1:18:55] so my wives wanted her pretty bad but
[1:19:03] why did why did he want Ruth he saw a
[1:19:06] quality he saw a real lady through the
[1:19:09] dirt this was something he was willing
[1:19:11] to pay the price for the bride is a real
[1:19:14] lady
[1:19:16] don't matter if you're poor if you're
[1:19:18] rich it don't matter
[1:19:21] she's a real lady you don't find that
[1:19:24] anymore you know you know most of us
[1:19:27] work out here in the in the secular
[1:19:30] world and you see it every day I'm
[1:19:33] working with a girl one day she's now a
[1:19:40] nominal Christian but back then she
[1:19:42] wasn't
[1:19:42] she said just something every day she
[1:19:45] would say something filthy and just turn
[1:19:47] around and look at me and laugh so one
[1:19:50] day she come off with something just it
[1:19:53] was nasty
[1:19:54] she looked at me and says does it shock
[1:19:56] you and me say that it's no ma'am I said
[1:19:59] what would a shock means if a lady had
[1:20:00] said it and she she never you never said
[1:20:05] nothing else so that worked
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:19] so boaz is bound and determined to pay
[1:20:22] the price and i wonder if we ever if we
[1:20:27] ever stop and think about the price the
[1:20:29] bow has paid because there there's no
[1:20:32] better picture in the bible of the price
[1:20:34] of redemption that types calvary as much
[1:20:38] as Boaz outside the gate so Boaz tells
[1:20:43] her I'll pay anything she's got to be
[1:20:47] mine she's got to be mine you look at
[1:20:51] your life you look at the thing in your
[1:20:53] life everybody hides things you look at
[1:20:57] the thing in your life that you're the
[1:20:58] most ashamed of that nobody knows but
[1:21:01] you he said I'll take that I'll take
[1:21:06] that into myself you don't have to bear
[1:21:08] that shame if you bear that shame that
[1:21:10] your own humanity because I'm taking it
[1:21:12] from you the worst thing you've ever
[1:21:16] done in your life and he steps outside
[1:21:19] the gate and they begin to beating they
[1:21:24] begin to pull his beard out spit on him
[1:21:26] and you were the only thing on his mind
[1:21:29] the entire time everything they'd done
[1:21:33] every stripe he got he knew he was in it
[1:21:36] because he was buying you it was a
[1:21:40] purchase every strut the more they beat
[1:21:43] him the closer he got to you you think
[1:21:46] he felt that pain sure he did
[1:21:48] you think he was humiliated they
[1:21:50] stripped him naked we go through life
[1:21:53] every day of our life hey I'm in the
[1:21:58] message how many can say that every day
[1:22:01] of your life you'd think of the price
[1:22:03] that was paid for you only time you ever
[1:22:06] think of is when you fall and you start
[1:22:09] to repent do you ever think about
[1:22:12] Calvary on your good days when you're on
[1:22:15] top of the mountain this Calvary every
[1:22:17] of your mind
[1:22:21] so he's beaten he's bloody do you think
[1:22:27] he was just paying the price for you we
[1:22:30] weren't the only ones it goes from the
[1:22:33] beginning all the way to now there was a
[1:22:35] little bride down inhale that needed out
[1:22:37] the third seal brother branham said Eve
[1:22:40] was God's bride she fell in the garden
[1:22:43] can you imagine when that price was paid
[1:22:48] and Christ goes to hell and kicks open
[1:22:52] the doors I can imagine the first thing
[1:22:55] he said when he screamed that was Adam
[1:22:57] where art thou you think Adam just mosey
[1:23:02] don't out now I'm right here imagine
[1:23:06] he'd grab D by the hand nothing's gonna
[1:23:10] stop him
[1:23:12] she said Eve that's him right there
[1:23:15] that's him the second Adam was sitting
[1:23:19] free the first Adam and I don't believe
[1:23:25] he just jog out of hell with Eve and
[1:23:30] here we are the price that he paid all
[1:23:35] that cleaned the blood but God loved us
[1:23:37] all so much he said he gave John 3:16
[1:23:40] what if we even what a Ruth had walked
[1:23:43] into the field and gleaned John 3:16 and
[1:23:46] walked out she was starved to death she
[1:23:51] would have starved to death but you got
[1:23:55] to have it all you've got a everything
[1:23:59] that's in the field you can't just eat
[1:24:02] part of the field you have to have it
[1:24:03] all you own it now so we mean you can
[1:24:06] eat it whenever you want so he goes
[1:24:09] outside he pays the price
[1:24:16] and what happens after he pays the price
[1:24:17] he sends Eliezer back to both Ruth says
[1:24:20] the price is paid make preparations I
[1:24:23] know in real life he didn't send a laser
[1:24:26] back
[1:24:26] I'm just dramatized in a little bit he
[1:24:31] goes back they send her back to Ruth the
[1:24:33] price has been paid Boaz has paid the
[1:24:35] price what a fruit said oh great
[1:24:43] could you tell Boaz one thing for me

[1:28:09] that's nobody in here
[1:28:10] I'm preached to myself too but we look
[1:28:18] at the price I want to wrap up here kiss
[1:28:27] means Redeemer brother Branham said now
[1:28:28] Boaz he had to make a public he said can
[1:28:32] you redeem her he said no he had to make
[1:28:34] a public testimony he picked off his
[1:28:36] shoe and threw it at him I said there
[1:28:38] you are but all Israel know that I've
[1:28:40] redeemed Naomi and also take Ruth
[1:28:42] I take Ruth for my bride who was it the
[1:28:45] Lord of the harvest a man there she is I
[1:28:48] redeem Naomi and get Ruth Ruth will be
[1:28:50] my bride what they say may her be that
[1:28:55] may she be like Leah and Rachel I raise
[1:28:58] up thousands and she has that's right
[1:29:00] unto Israel may she be that way and look
[1:29:03] he made a public testimony because that
[1:29:06] was studying this I had to make sure I
[1:29:11] didn't leave
[1:29:12] Naomi out she's got a major part to play
[1:29:17] in this but Brandon says she typed the
[1:29:19] Jewish church she typed Israel but you
[1:29:24] look at Naomi coming back and then we
[1:29:27] come back to nothing
[1:29:29] she lost all she had
[1:29:32] she needed a kinsman redeemer different
[1:29:36] script quotes brother Branham says naomi
[1:29:41] was redeemed and Ruth were purchased but
[1:29:45] before he could even repurchase Ruth he
[1:29:47] had to redeem Naomi you don't you think
[1:29:50] that Boaz held nan Naomi to high esteem
[1:29:54] why did he say he had Ruth is in the
[1:29:57] field she asked him she says why have I
[1:29:59] found favor in your sight because the
[1:30:01] way you've treated your mother-in-law
[1:30:02] it's been told to me and then once she
[1:30:06] comes to the threshing room floor what
[1:30:07] does she tell her he hands her the apron
[1:30:11] full of barley dough not empty to your
[1:30:14] mother-in-law but Naomi needed
[1:30:18] Redemption she needed to be redeemed
[1:30:21] back to what she had before she needed
[1:30:24] the name she needed her name reading
[1:30:28] back of her her husband so we look at
[1:30:34] the union of Boaz and Ruth produces a
[1:30:38] child and the people tell her but after
[1:30:44] the son is produced by the union of Ruth
[1:30:47] and they tell Boaz may your house be the
[1:30:50] house of Ferraz who was born on the
[1:30:53] table honor for rez was the breech Naomi
[1:30:57] needed a breach who took the child into
[1:31:00] themselves after it was born it was
[1:31:01] Naomi who produced the child
[1:31:06] the bridegroom and the bride looked up
[1:31:10] the name of course Oh bad means servant
[1:31:13] and strong supporter and it's got it as
[1:31:15] worshipper or worship so now he takes
[1:31:19] his child to nurse her bitterness
[1:31:23] returns back to worship her name has
[1:31:27] been restored through Obama through a
[1:31:30] bed without him she's got nothing she
[1:31:33] needed she needed this redemption
[1:31:36] because without the just the marriage
[1:31:38] alone just the marriage of Ruth and Boaz
[1:31:41] alone was nothing for her
[1:31:44] she had to have what they presumed
[1:31:46] produced to carry on her name and says
[1:31:50] she'd be miss to nerf the child and I
[1:31:51] looked this word up in the Hebrew is to
[1:31:55] support to confirm to be faithful uphold
[1:31:57] a nurse to stand firm to trust to be
[1:32:00] certain and to believe in
[1:32:03] she believed this child is where he
[1:32:07] stored her name back as I was studying
[1:32:12] this list and I'm done is that was
[1:32:20] steadiness house telling mother Terry
[1:32:22] Horne about it
[1:32:23] let's tell brother Terry I said but with
[1:32:28] Terry I really believe you know the
[1:32:32] union of a man and a woman when a man
[1:32:35] finds a bride and they become married in
[1:32:37] the sight of God you know I look back at
[1:32:39] Adam and Eve in the garden when God went
[1:32:42] through running through the garden
[1:32:45] calling Adam he wasn't just calling the
[1:32:47] man he was calling them both she wasn't
[1:32:51] named Eve until after the fall and God
[1:32:54] viewed them it is one and he said
[1:32:56] brother Joe he said I believe that so
[1:32:59] much he said that I believe when a man
[1:33:02] if a man and a woman are married and
[1:33:05] that woman is his eternal mate when God
[1:33:09] calls him from the grave she'll come
[1:33:11] with him and I found the quote y'all can
[1:33:15] look at it have you won this is not a
[1:33:16] doctrine so ain't ain't into that but
[1:33:21] brother Branham said this in
[1:33:23] kinsman-redeemer
[1:33:24] yesterday morning we were laying in bed
[1:33:26] a little a little late and the children
[1:33:28] didn't have to go to school we got to
[1:33:30] speaking about different things and how
[1:33:32] said what was hatred
[1:33:33] I said hatred had a beginning so it has
[1:33:35] to have an end love had no beginning so
[1:33:38] it has no end
[1:33:39] hatred is forever love is eternal hatred
[1:33:42] begins and hatred will end love will
[1:33:44] never did begin and will never end
[1:33:46] it's eternal when a man loves a woman
[1:33:48] and marries her just because she's
[1:33:50] pretty still being into that but when a
[1:33:54] man finds a woman he loves
[1:33:56] he don't know why it loves her but he
[1:33:59] loves her she finds the man she loves no
[1:34:03] matter what he looks like
[1:34:04] he loves her she loves him that's an
[1:34:08] eternal mate in glory death or nothing
[1:34:12] else can ever separate them they stepped
[1:34:15] out into space of time and returned back
[1:34:18] to eternity eternity has dropped down in
[1:34:22] about body called time then it goes
[1:34:25] right back up into eternity again it
[1:34:27] cannot perish and I read that they
[1:34:31] stepped out into space of time if me and
[1:34:35] my wife go way of the grave and my name
[1:34:40] is Karl I'm gonna reach over and take
[1:34:43] her with me Christ is not complete
[1:34:49] without you you're 1 there's something
[1:34:53] about the bride that he loves you look
[1:34:56] at yourself and you say yeah I can't
[1:34:58] figure it out he didn't ask you to he
[1:35:02] didn't ask you to figure out you got to
[1:35:06] believe in his love you say why because
[1:35:11] he said so if he hasn't proved it enough
[1:35:15] but what he gave what else has he got to
[1:35:18] do you say oh brother Joe I love him too
[1:35:20] I do too but sometimes I wonder I'm
[1:35:26] speaking about myself does my life show
[1:35:30] it can people look at my life and say
[1:35:33] that man loves God
[1:35:38] i-i think about the song here he sings
[1:35:40] all the time bell bleeds and lament the
[1:35:43] second verse
[1:35:44] when she stands before him in linen
[1:35:48] white with righteousness that's not her
[1:35:51] own every time I think of that song I
[1:35:55] hear that song I think that's God
[1:36:01] looking at me but he don't see me he
[1:36:08] sees himself because it's his own
[1:36:10] righteousness that he sees you down
[1:36:14] yourself all the time you put yourself
[1:36:15] down all the time and you think why why
[1:36:20] am i this why am i that God don't look
[1:36:25] at that
[1:36:26] God don't look at your sturdy your
[1:36:28] stinking rotten humanity he didn't marry
[1:36:31] that he didn't marry that the bride to
[1:36:35] God in God's eyes is not humanity it's a
[1:36:40] bride with that spot or wrinkle and I
[1:36:44] believe with all my heart that she's
[1:36:50] just about dressed she may be fully
[1:36:53] dressed just waiting on the call
[1:36:59] let's bow our heads please seeing when
[1:37:05] it will want to be remembered
[1:37:07] say brother Joe um I believe I'm bright
[1:37:12] but I never think about it
[1:37:14] I never think about the price that was
[1:37:20] paid to purchase me maybe you're on the
[1:37:24] mountain a lot and you forget about
[1:37:25] Calvary that's the problem with this so
[1:37:28] many times we get up we never up days so
[1:37:30] long
[1:37:31] good times are going so long price of
[1:37:35] redemption just is a faded memory the
[1:37:38] only time we ever think about it is when
[1:37:40] we're down in the valley I'm to blame
[1:37:43] for that I do the same thing whenever
[1:37:47] I'm things are going well for me you
[1:37:51] know I hate to say it I forget about the
[1:37:53] cross but let's just pray in your prayer
[1:38:00] pray to yourself Laura let me recognize
[1:38:04] myself as a bride
[1:38:05] well Bram said until a bride recognizes
[1:38:08] who she is
[1:38:08] she's not getting out of here and you
[1:38:12] can't get married unless you recognize
[1:38:14] your bride
[1:38:17] Heavenly Father lord I thank you lord
[1:38:21] for her price you paid for me Lord Lord
[1:38:26] if I was to look at my own humanity look
[1:38:30] at my deeds my sins my faults my
[1:38:33] failures but what I would never
[1:38:36] understand why you would pay that much
[1:38:39] of a price for me Father but Lord just
[1:38:43] to think Lord as you knelt in the garden
[1:38:45] father every sin that was in my life
[1:38:49] every sin that I would ever commit
[1:38:52] we're just laid on your back that was
[1:38:56] your price for me Lord cause you wanted
[1:38:58] to marry me and you were willing to take
