they read about what it used to be and they have a future idea of what they think it will be and I'm so glad we have an idea of what he will be but I'm so glad we know what he is now and what he's doing we're a witness aren't we you may like to be remember tonight as we go before the Lord in prayer and need a request on your heart all right Heavenly Father we so thank you tonight dear God that we have been able to experience and know that you are an awesome mighty God we thank you Lord Jesus it it's not just something that we read out of the old Testament or read out of the new or even read in the time when your Prophet was here on the earth Lord God we can look around and see and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have moved Among Us I wonder sometimes if these young people Lord here at the church realize how blessed they are they have seen things with their eyes that people many people down Through the Ages have never seen right here in our church we've seen the dead raised we've seen cancer healed we've seen one thing after another after another lives changed by the power of God we are so blessed father and we don't want to just receive it from you and not let you know how much we appreciate it we are so grateful and so thankful as we've come tonight Lord that we could be enlightened a little bit more of the day that we're living we pray that You' just help us tonight help me father to be led by your spirit shut my mouth to anything that would displease you thank you Lord for the opportunity that we've gathered here tonight in the name of Jesus Amen praise the Lord so glad to see each one of you tonight thank you for coming out on this Thursday night U eventually I'm going to get done with this one question but until I feel like I've covered it all I we just keep going on is that okay okay can you explain why brother brandham is a Vindicated prophet and why the message is correct I have a difficult time speaking to why I believe what I believe you can you can be seated I want to say I was out in Arkansas this past week and and a brother come up to me after the service there he's one of the deacons of the church and he wanted to S and Sharon brother Rob he wanted to express how much he had been enjoying the question and answers so maybe some of you would have a question on your heart and you wouldn't understand something and you might think man I I hate to ask that I don't want people to think west of me or something if I do it but it's amazing by your questions and things that you have asked how many people have been blessed by it and I'm grateful for that I'm grateful that we're we we have enough in our hearts to be able to understand that God is Supernatural but there's also an element of our humanity and I want you to know I'm not going to shame you because you need to understand more or you want to know more that's one of the things that we learn about as I've been studying on these questions I've just been amazed at how much more that I have found myself now the last time that we dealt with this I closed in Deuteronomy 131 and this is where I'd like to open up again tonight and it's quite astounding really whenever you look at it because people of this modern day don't have this concept about God and the way that God works and because mindset is that God basically has to Baby his people and God cannot treat them like mature Sons and Daughters of God so God has to keep all the bad away from them all the wrong away from them God's never going to allow them to be tested God is certainly not going to test them himself but we happen to know that that's totally different Deuteronomy 13:1 if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the Wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods now what's amazing is that a man could actually give a sign or wonder or even have a spiritual dream or see a vision and it could be genuine and true so you wouldn't just know a prophet because the dream was true or because the vision was true but what you would do is see after that man gives the dream or the vision then what is he trying to get you and I to follow because those things are given as signs so brother Bram likened it to bait on a hook and when you're going fishing that you don't show the fish the hook but you show it the bait notice Moses goes on to say in verse 13 Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that Prophet now notice here here actually calls these people prophets or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proveth you you mean God would actually do that God would let people raise up down Through the Ages and he would let them do that yes it's apparent that he's done it over and over again to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with with all your soul so we're not only going to be tempted by worldly things out here on the world and we tend to categorize worldliness as drinking smoking and all the wrong kind of dress your sisters cutting your hair uh your brothers doing things or saying things that you shouldn't do and people think that is worldliness but actually worldliness contains much more than that worldliness is actually unbelief there's only two aspects that's faith and unbelief so Satan will actually come against us in many ways other than just hair and dress and drinking and makeup and alcohol and drugs and so on and so on so this is actually what he used in the Garden of Eden to try to pull Eve away from the promise of God so he said you should walk after the Lord your God and fear Him and keep his Commandments and obey his voice and you shall serve him and clear unto him and that Prophet or that dreamer of Dreams shall be put to death now God was very very serious about this because Heath spoken now notice the prophets why they would do this because he has spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage it's a Thrust thee out of the way so this is way we'll be able to judge and know a false prophet from a true one it's not always by signs it's not always by Miracles you've heard me share difference of things that I saw in Pentecost and the Miracles were genuine many of them were but yet you always wait and see but what he got to say what's the message that follows The Voice now watch in Genesis 15:1 this is why that we believe that a prophet is in a different category than even a pastor an evangelist a teacher an apostle which is one that goes forth and starts works for god notice how that the Bible says this about Abram and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision so a prophet then wasn't somebody that just said uh you've got a sickness and you've got a trial and and you've got a burden and you're going through this and that and the other they they would say those things but God's main channel for his word was prophets so to us that's not unusual and strange then to believe that God would use a prophet in our day anybody have an idea tonight of how the what the number is current number as of 2024 of denominations in Christianity around the world anybody have an idea over 45,000 as of today 45,000 denominations and when brother random is here 900 so in this day of confusion now those denominations they don't agree right they don't agree if they all agreed there'd be no different and in just having a different name why be Baptist Methodist Church of God Church of Christ First Baptist Second Baptist 48th Baptist 153rd Baptist you know you follow me so if they all believe the same thing there would be no need for a differentiation just by name so why do we have all them different ones because they all disagree so they would split away from that one a lot of it of course we know in our day has been because of the gay move and the homosexual and all that sort of thing the Methodist are dividing the Baptists are dividing many of them are dividing and separating and even the churches are going more woke and that's what they want so that's that's exactly the reason that they're dividing and separating so you can imagine now in the early church age there was no denominations there weren't any in the first years when the apostolic church was founded in the book of Acts there were no denominations then as it began to go on in 325 ad at the council and sometime I'd like to take that for you and be able to break that down to help you see it but for 300 years there there was a truth that had come about still baptizing right and then in 3:25 ad whenever they meet together because the division started and it came from a man named aryion and it was about the godhead so there was a great doctrinal dispute about who Jesus really was was he God in essence or was he of the lower creation of God which is what many of them believed and then they had this great dissension so they wanted to meet so they came from Constantinople they came from the Mediterranean they came from the known world for now for about 300 years Christianity had spread and they meet together and it was actually a great leader of Rome that had them together and said you all need to discuss this you need to resolve this so here come prophets and sages out of the Wilderness and said don't do this don't do this it's wrong it's wrong 325 D at the Nan Council was whenever they decided to do away with the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and water baptism and replace it with the titles of father son Holy Ghost but now God had already foran that and gave a prophet in the first church age which was Paul now think if God wanted to do that before there was ever any denominations at all wonder what God would send then in the last day knowing that there would be 45,000 by next week or maybe a few more so why would God send a prophet so that the word of the Lord could come to him well brother Donnie can't the word come to you no I'm not made that way can I have Impressions yes can I be inspired yes I can I can be inspired and God will give me things but I have to take my inspiration back to an absolute and check my inspiration to make sure that it's right why because Satan is a deceiver and he can easily trick people but now a prophet is made to where he can so get himself out of the way I can't do that or can any other preacher other than just a prophet now Abram it's not that he was a a special man but he was a man that God chose so notice after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision now this was not Abraham feeling impressed and saying I feel led I feel led to do this I I feel led that um I I'm going to be God's chosen one no it's not impression it's not even feeling Leed and it's the same for us today today we will feel led to do a lot of things that are absolutely contrary to the word of God and that's why God gives us his word to where we can trace that back and say okay is there anything in the word that says I shouldn't do that and then if you look and you search and you can't find anything then God gives you a Shepherd a pastor then you go look you know brother Donnie you know please help me pray about this I'm thinking about doing this or that do you know anything in the scripture or do you know anything in the message why I should not do that now why does God do that for your double protection so that it'll keep you from making a mistake but even in that if you come to me it doesn't mean that I will always have the answer many times people come to me and they say you know you know this NOP I'm sorry I sure don't but I'll be praying with you I'll be praying with you but now if I was a prophet then a prophet would be able to get a word from the Lord it is so perfect and so so absolute that God will judge Nations by what them people them prophets got from God that's how perfect you understand so it's a different than an impression anybody here tonight be honest enough to say in your walk with God that you felt led to do certain things or feel you know just a a pull or something and it wound up being not the Lord yeah yeah yeah well all the rest of you just hang on you will now but a profit is made to where the word of the Lord can come to him in a vision now you know it's amazing because Joel 2 one of the Prophecies of the end time was that God would appear to people and he would actually cause young men to see visions and old men to dream dreams now I've never had too many spiritual dreams myself I've had Visions before I had one about a month and a half ago two months ago I saw two message preachers sitting at a table and they were actually talking about me and they were discussing me because they felt like I was wrong and some things I was preaching and I heard one of them preachers in this Vision I saw it and I heard him and I saw him say some certain things to this other man about me but was that the word of the Lord no can we base a Doctrine on that no so the word of the Lord that come to the prophets in this form of vision was somewhat different than that I know of different people in our church that has actually had visions and they might happen and they might not now you know brother random told us about seeing a vision that whenever a prophet would see a Vision that he might see a lamb in the vision and it might mean sheep or it might mean wool so in a vision a prophet unless God gives it to him clearly and the word of the Lord format that Prophet would have to wait for God to turn it around and reveal to him what it meant by symbols so now notice in this one it was not symbols that God was dealing with Abram but it was clearly the word of the Lord in a vision the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying so notice it wasn't a star and a bridge and a sheep and a book and and pews and this and that it was the word of the Lord infallibility now remember he tells us in the church age book that the power of infallibility would return in the last days but in what format pastors no evangelists no teachers no in the form of a god-sent prophet to whom the word of the Lord does that make sense to everybody that the word of the Lord would come now notice so the word of the Lord comes to Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward so this was not just not the spirit of God speaking to his Spirit or it was not him hearing a voice you know just like you and I would hear it was something even greater God is going to base his Covenant God is going to base millions of people's Destiny on this word God is going to base this is the foundation of the Jews the real Jews today still go back to this very word because to them it's the word of the Lord you understand now people can feel impressed and this is where brother brandom warned the Pentecostals and I saw it many many times myself when I I was in Pentecost and people would feel impressed brother I I I feel that that you're going through a hard time I could say that to probably everybody here tonight right you know and you say uh brother you're you're you you've got a I feel a back pain I feel a back pain yeah if You' anything today you probably got a few pains here or there but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about something that is absolutely perfectly infallible it does not miss so it's not guessing it's not mind over matter now watch in numbers 12: 6 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream so now here again God is giving in the book of numbers of course Moses again writing that it would be by this identification that we'd be able to know if a man was a prophet 2 Chronicles 3232 now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the vision of Isaiah the prophet so the book of Isaiah I love the way the the author of Chronicles writes this and he actually calls it the vision of Isaiah yet in Isaiah is also chronology of the tribes and all different types of things but the author here of this chose to write this in this way in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel now watch why this has such value to the people of the Old Testament and to us as well if we believe it Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision the people perish now I find this amazing because you hear this scripture quot Ed so much in modernday Christendom but what they do is they take the scripture and Miss Supply it like that a church has to have a vision well we've got to have a vision of Word of Life Church and and I I want everybody to invite somebody to church on Sunday because we want our church to grow and then we're going to hand out tracks and we're going to have a a church ball team and then we're going to do this and that and the other and we're going to try to make our church grow cuz we have to have a vision without a vision the people perish that scripture is so misapplied it's pitiful because actually most of them don't even believe in the way this scripture is written but I'm going to read it to and I'm going to read you the meaning of the word where there is no vision the people perish look at the word Vision Vision in a static State Oracle prophecy Divine communication young people I want to ask you a question tonight where would we be had God not sent us a prophet if we had not received Divine communication from God in a vision the very say we're laughed about that people ridicule us and make fun of us until of course they come and hear us some so here a few weeks ago when we had sister tr's funeral there was a prominent businessman that came to the funeral service and he had heard things about us he knew our former church and where we were and all that had said some really bad bad things about us but he had had some dealing with us through the flood thing and he had told one of the brothers of our church that the Lord had rebuked him and told him that he should not think those things or say those things that he had said about our church so the man and his family came to Sister tr's funeral on his way out that door there he spoke to someone that he knew in our church and he said I've been in church all my life I have never in my entire life heard anything like that funeral so now what makes us different then every preacher is known for something you know one of the things I'm known for the way I preach funerals and you think dear God have mercy really wow that's really an identification is it not brother Daryl tells me all the time he said brother Donnie I wish I was up there in that box when you get done I wish I was dead going on to Heaven Ain't that really something to be known for but why what is it then that makes us different what makes our funerals what makes what what because we say it and the way we approach it and our preaching now that man may have never come to a service but he come to a funeral and he was somehow impacted CU he had never heard a funeral quite preach like that well is it because I'm such a great speaker you know better than that you know I'm not a great speaker I never finished high school much let preacher training preacher education huh I wouldn't even know where to start on such a thing but what is it oh he said brother Donnie so gifted it's not just about my gift it's where I feed from it's where I feed from what where do I feed from I'm feeding from an open vision that came through a prophet that gave to us Divine communication from the presence of God and I preach funerals in different states and different parts of the United States I preach them in military funerals I preached one several years ago of someone that was associated with our church that was a police officer I've never seen so many police cars state troopers constables sheriff's police it was absolutely unbelievable the amount of people that they came to the funeral the amount of police officers that was there they came to the gravide I've never seen such a gathering before I had the chief of police of Elizabeth also the sheriff of Washington County different ones come up and Sh hands me I've heard about you I'm going to come and hear you preach again I've never heard anything like that in my life now why cuz I'm a great preacher I'm not but it's where we feed from it's the Divine communication and as I stood there praying God please give me something and this police officer that had died every state trooper had a radio every Sheriff had a radio every cop had a radio and his last communication when he checked in he said so and so so and so and they told me when they was going to do it and they told me to pause every police officer it went off on his radio every Sheriff it went off on his radio and it was that man's voice voice which was now silenced in death and when that happened the Lord dropped something down inside my heart to speak to those men now where I wouldn't know that me Carol was talk about not Longo she said Donnie where would we be right now if it wasn't for the message I said probably still in Pentecost probably running here and running there and you know thinking was doing some great something from the Lord but why why do I preach different why why does brother Daryl preach different why does our message preachers different an open vision from God aren't you grateful aren't you grateful notice so where there is no vision the people perish this is why we were where we were this is why there's over 45,000 denominations they're searching searching searching searching looking looking looking why they have no open Vision so they have somebody that differs with that church and then they split and they make another church and then they get three or four more churches and they say let's make an organization so they make an organization and then they go for a while and then somebody splits out that no we're breaking away from them they have no open Vision thank God for the truth but he that keepeth the law happy is he now look in Ezekiel 8:4 for behold the glory of the Lord Lord of Israel was there according to the vision that I saw in the plane now remember these prophets are going to say things that none of the rest of them had said before because God works in dispensation so you remember we still have a few out there but whenever Co and all that was going on and and I bought a bunch of the hand sanitizers and put them here and there and there so they were out alcohol dispensers and soap dispensers why so you could put your hands and I could under them and it would automatically dispense so much alcohol they come preset with so many milliters or whatever it is and you would put your hands there it's all you had to do you put your hands there battery's charged everything's working good it would dispense something in your hands you would be able to do this and you'd go in from that point on you bumped elbows or bumped fist you didn't touch nobody's hands because you had been washed by the dispenser right so what good would it do if all the dispensers were empty what good would it do if they was there but there was no soap or no alcohol in them to dispense so God dispensed his word the same way so in the days of Moses he gave a large dispensation first five books of the Bible the law the Torah then God would go for many years before another Prophet might come and say a few things and then on and on and on but they would prophesy and they would say similar things but yet sometimes one would say something that not another one would say for the rest of the entire scripture how can God trust that are there any perfect human beings that are so in contact with God that God could do that there aren't any so God makes these men so special that that power of infallibility can be projected through their lips now can you imagine a man saying one day a virgin shall conceive that was a very peculiar setting in the way that Isaiah prophesied about this so he's looking at the Su dial of ahaz and he said the Lord will give you a sign and all of a sudden he jumps ahead 714 years and he says the Lord himself shall give you a sign a virgin shall conceive now you imagine what doctors would have said nurses Nurse Practitioners if they had them in that day you imagine what common just people with common sense would have said that man is out of his mind who heard of a virgin conceiving and this is the thing of it Ezekiel Never Said Amen to that that's right praise the Lord the Lord showed me the same thing Jeremiah never verified it Micah never verified it zachari Malachi Hagi naam Joel not another prophet of the Old Testament said a virgin shall conceive one man but Israel the real saints of God that believed that one man they held on to his word now you understand that same prophet Isaiah prophesied not only from chapter one on down to that chapter he didn't stop there he went on in chapter 65 and he prophesied of the Millennium now how can we have conf idence now in this day his prophecy was given almost 2800 years ago about the Millennium so now are we going to wait until the Millennium happens before we say all right Isaiah now I'll believe you when the Millennium happens we have confidence because we see other things that he said come to pass then we can say chapter 65 it'll come to pass too and chapter 66 which talks about the eighth day after the Millennium I'll just go ahead and tell you I'm resting on it aren't you I have confidence now you see for people who want to pick and sort and pick and sort well they said well it didn't come to Passion I ain't believing it you see God wrote it that way actually Ezekiel 44 through chapter 48 speaks again about the Millennium the Millennium Temple how the prince will enter into the Eastern side all those things none of those verses have yet come to pass the former sea the hinder sea Zechariah 14 the the mountain will be cleaved in half and the water will come out of that and it'll go to the Dead Sea it'll stream right down to the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea will come alive well are we going to wait and judge him he said no wait a minute wait a minute people want to pick on brother brandham and so this ain't come to pass and that ain't come to pass sure that's the way prophets do but it gives us confidence praise the Lord I saw a Pentecostal guy on YouTube some time back and he was sharing a lot of testimonies I think I sent it to you brother Rob and the man was sharing uh a lot of different testimonies he was not a message believer of things that he saw in brother ROM's Ministry and one of the ones I just thought was so outstanding was that his family his mother and father knew this certain woman and they had went to a meeting where brother brandham was and brother brandham called the woman out told her she was going through this that and the other and told her her address and his mother and father were there in the meeting and they knew where this sister lived and they knew that was not her address or so they thought so they went to her after church and said how you doing you know how you doing you know talk a little bit and said we we we just have to question you on this brother bam told you was that right about the sickness yes it was right praise the Lord it was right well we know that's not your address oh she said I hadn't told you all I just recently moved so what does that do for us Young people it gives us confidence you know and it's easy for lot of these people that want to criticize him now after he's done gone thank God for all those that have given us testimonies believe me I've been around many many people that were there as eyewitnesses people that were told all types of things these things are not made up and you remember when you're listening to brother brandom and he's calling them people out listen to their response yes yes amen praise the Lord praise the Lord you'll also hear sometimes I heard one the other day well that there was a preacher on the platform behind him brother random was calling somebody out telling them their sickness their disease and the man behind him on the platform said I brought her to church with me tonight that's the truth so there are witnesses by the hundreds of thousands that gives us confidence then that the things that he had to say there will be sharks swimming in California she will go under I don't care what they say it gives us confidence you understand now watch in Ezekiel again 11: 24 afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God into Chala What A peculiar thing now remember prophet PHS they move in the realm of the fourth dimension so when God created the dimensions there was seven of them light matter time science where the unbeliever goes where the believer goes and where God is so all diseases began in the fourth dimension you can find this in the demonology part two if you like to look for it so in the beginning there were no diseases once Angels fell then they were still maintain their capability of being able to appear in time and appear in molecules and atoms even appear as angels of light God never created cancer God never created pneumonia God never created any of that where does cancer come from bruised cell brother called it a cell that backslides so A demon Spirit then will come and hijack the life in that cell and that cell then one of the difference that they found several several years ago is the trigger in most cells in our body they will duplicate replicate duplicate replicate and then they shut off but a cancer cell they've not so far been able to find that trigger inside that cell and they just keep growing growing growing growing until they explode and then overpower the rest of the cells in our body so a prophet in the fourth dimension it must have been a peculiar world you know to to live in in that world so here Ezekiel says he brought me in a vision by the spirit of God into Chala to them of the Captivity so by Vision a prophet could move back Wards he could move forwards and then he could also be in the present tense at the same time so something like this a a woman stands before brother brandham I see you with a yellow check of dress on I see you running coming home from school a dog gets behind you chases you up on the front porch and you you go through the screen door and it put a spirit of fear on you and it's haunted you all your life now what what happened so he went back in time and brought it right up to present tense in the fourth dimension because in the fourth dimension it's unlike what you and I can do we can't travel like that can you imagine being able to go to New Zealand in the fourth dimension I just think about it and be there praise the Lord one of these days that's the way we'll travel that's the way prophets was so Ezekiel by the spirit of God it was like he was transported into Chala and then another place he said that he was transported to the river of chibar they say wow how how did they do that so there wasn't hitchhiking in the fourth dimension and trying to find a fast horse in that Dimension they could travel that's why brother R would be able to be carried beyond the curtain of time Paul said I knew a man about 14 years ago whether in the body out of the body I cannot tell but he said I knew such a man and he was carried Beyond you know of course what we know beyond the curtain of time into the third heavens and saw things and heard things that was unlawful for a man to utter my so prophets were able to move into that realm and see these things now watch Daniel Daniel chapter 2: 19 then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the god of Heaven now remember the king had had a dream and he couldn't remember all of it yet it was weighing on him it was troubling him to death as we would say so he call for the susers you know and all those men that did all of that and they said look y'all I I've had this dream they said oh great King live forever tell us the dream he said well that's the problem you Knuckleheads I can't remember the dream but it's troubling me it's bothering me I want you all to tell me they said are you kidding us there's never been a king that's ever asked such a thing there's never been a king so all the Su said now what's what God's doing God's doing this to pull his Prophet away from being a susay identification now them susers they had to admit it well we can't do this we can't do it but Daniel Shadrach me check and a minuto they knew a living God and they said oh King live forever there is a God who can reveal it now watch So Daniel in a vision you know what Daniel sees he sees the King's dream so but the difference was he wasn't like this he was in a trance in a state of euphoria a static place oh what what a thing it must have been for these men when they were there in a wrapped condition r a p t which is a short word for what you're fixing to experience rap sure now watch So Daniel then sees there he is he said oh my Lord oh it's this it's this colossal image and and he sees the head of gold and he sees all of the image of the of the king there the man in in the in the vision was described by metallurgical elements so gold silver bronze brass and then the feet iron and clim mixed together so they go the next day and he said all right tell me of course the old s said well can we we don't know I mean we're we're we we belong to the Baptist Church but we don't know what to tell you we belong to the Methodist Church but we don't know what to tell you we belong to the Luc and the Church of God we don't know what to tell you but Daniel walked up and said oh great king there is a God hallelujah there is a God who can reveal the secrets of the hearts can you imagine what them susers and all the rest of them people must have thought when Daniel stand there and he says great king you saw this great colossal image the head was of gold and then he goes on down and as he's seeing it Nebuchadnezzar's face is lighting up like a Christmas tree he said that was it that's what I saw how did you know that he said the god of Heaven re the god of Heaven revealed to me the secret do you understand we are still living in that dream we're living right down at the feet and the toes to where the iron and the clay protestantism and all the rest of Catholicism and all that they tried to mold it together but it will not hold together it will break apart we're still living in that great thing notice again Daniel 8:16 let me go ahead and read verse 15 and it came to pass when I even I Daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man now I don't mind telling you most of us are not made to deal in this Supernatural realm we're just not and it don't mean that we're not good Christians that don't mean that we don't love the Lord but we're just not called to deal with this there's special people that God has placed on the earth these prophets to walk in that realm to be honest with you I don't I I don't want to I don't want to be there anyway I'm not made up to deal with what what Supernatural things that I've seen has scared me to death and I don't believe God would press us beyond what that we're called to do but now listen what he what he experienced there stood before me as the appearance of a man and I heard a man's voice between the banks of Uli which called and said Gabriel make this man to understand the Vision so here was the angel Gabriel huh you wouldn't have to worry about me telling a visitation about Gabriel cuz I'd probably pass out I'm not made to deal with that neither are you all come on just accept it most of the preachers that we know in this message are not called they're not this caliber of men though many would love to be when God chooses men to deal with in this way they are set apart from everyone else and we cannot make ourself this only God can do this notice chapter 10:14 now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days you understand that the children of Israel are now walking in part of the vision of the Book of Daniel and part of it is yet to come part of it they lived out under Antiochus epiphanes Daniel saw a goat raise up and he had one horn then he saw a ram rais up with so many horns each one of them was a power and a King Antiochus epes was the one with the one horn nearly wiped them out but God would not let it happen what was it it wasn't a priest it wasn't a singer it wasn't a good person it had to be a man that was made in a certain way God couldn't risk it to a person who had a gift that had a margin of error now you see there are people that are gifted but their gift has a margin of error that's how it can hit and miss hit and miss hit and miss that ain't the way God is going to reveal his word it's got to be infallable praise God now notice Obadiah very very small book of the Old Testament the vision of Obadiah thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom now when these prophets would say this this is not actually a man just feeling impressed thus sayeth the Lord thus sayith the Lord it actually was the Lord I hope this don't stagger you but when Jesus was here they they they you know they constantly was picking him and he quoted them the word how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God when your own law says ye are Gods that's in your new testament for he said did not he call them Gods to whom the word of God came to now that was not all of Israel that was those chosen ones so is it in the message we've got great preachers in the message we've got some great event great pastors great teachers but we only needed one prophet of God of the caliber of Malachi 4 that's all you need is that right you only need one of that caliber cuz God can say everything with that prophetic gift then what are the pastor supposed to do study what that Prophet brought and stay with it evangelist teachers and so on now watch thus sayith the Lord God concerning Edom we have heard a rumor I've always thought this is so unusual we have heard a rumor from the Lord and an ambassador is sent among the Heathen arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle naom again one of the Minor Prophets as is called in the Old Testament the burden of of Nineveh the book of the vision of naom the aishite but now remember these prophets would sometimes only preach to the time frame in which they were in but then every now and then they would break Force the way naam did and God allowed naam to look into the city of Chicago and see the Outer Drive anybody ever been in the outo drive of Chicago and he looked and he saw it and he didn't know what to make of it and he said the Chariots was jostling against one another whe they didn't have Chryslers and Chevrolets and Fords and Dodges so I mean he he saw this in the vision and brother renam said that whenever the prophet looked there and saw it he saw the Outer Drive of Chicago and he didn't know what to call them so he called them chariots can you imagine that man looking at the Outer Drive of Chicago I mean it's it's quite it's quite an expressway and loops and ramps going just every different direction and him carried up this man was used to dirt roads this man was used to paths and people walking and all of a sudden he's mov mov D up into who knows what time it was 20th century centuries and centuries way on in the future and he looked there by vision and saw people blowing their horns and there was tractors and trailers and there was dump trucks and there was cars and there was volkswagons and Fords and Chevrolet and pickups and all this that and other and thinking Lord God what in the world what is all that what what was that so he just come back down out of the vision all he knew to do was just write it down you imagine people for hundreds of years picked up and read that chariots josing against one another they thought Jing against one another well they ain't but three people in our community that's even got it got a chariot and they they certainly ain't josing against one another that was a false prophet I'm going to go on YouTube and I'm going to make me a video and I'm going to say that that man said something that wasn't even right well they called him Cher charot said we call him a false prophet because he didn't call it Chevrolet as a joke it's okay you can smile a little bit thank you Maria now think how unusual that it was for these men habac 2:2 and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it praise God for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not Terry and the use of the Word of Life Church said amen now let's move from there to the New Testament did New Testament people also have visions Luke 1:22 now this is the father Zacharias of John the Baptist the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and told him him and his wife was going to have a child but she was past child birth she was uh several years old and according to the time of life it had already ceased with them so he doubted and questioned and the angel said because you have done this you will not be able to talk so for nine months you're going to lose your ability to speak because you have doubted what I had to say when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless so the New Testament Prophet John the Baptist was foretold by an angel of God coming in a format now remember this was not a Prophet who saw the vision it was a priest so the word of the Lord could not come to him in the same way that it did to a prophet so you can imagine that many wasn't a priest so he he sees this and there's the angel of God you don't know what to make of it Luke 2423 and when they found not his body they had that had also seen a vision of angels which said he was alive now here the Lord Jesus has raised from the dead and a vision of angels has appeared you mean people in the New Testament were seeing visions no wait a minute I thought after the cross we would do Visions no more well you know we've got the Bible and we don't need them well you see that's actually tradition it's not the scripture acts 9: 10 and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananas and to him said the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of tarus for he pray us and hath seen in a vision now I want you to notice now God dealing on both ends so ananas is seeing a vision and in the vision the Lord tells him I want you to go to this certain city I want you to go to this certain Street and then when you get there I want you to ask for a certain man you see how different this is than from a lot of the charismatics and stuff today well somebody here's got a burden and somebody's got a vision God can tell you the street the city the name the time the address praise the Lord a lot of discernments and things that are said today they're said in a very I hate to say it but they're said in a very deceitful way they're said that in a way that if it don't happen you won't be able to point your finger at the one who said it and if it does happen of course they're going to take credit and glory for it but a real one and they was already dealing with this when brother Brandon was here there was already people that was mimicking what he was doing and he rebuked it of course he said in face of the trumpets he said that sign of discernment he said not a dozen men but one man one man but you see after God sent that one impat well the devil sure didn't like me to did him with this part did he uhhuh now watch whenever brother Brandon was here all these impersonators started raising up I feel this and they would have oil and blood my my younger brother Jamie I love him with all of my heart but Jamie my younger brother I've seen oil drip from his hands he did not cause that to happen whenever we were praying for my mother dying with cancer and I seen it from both of Jim's hands and the oil it was as wet as if he would have dipped his hands down in uh some type of container and hold his hands and the oil would drip for him from his hands now remember that was one of the things going on when brother Brandon was here CU he said they got signs they got wonders they got all dripping I'm not saying that in a dragory way against Jamie because Jamie could not help it it just happened to him and I saw it with my own eyes praise the Lord now seeing that God was going to bring this to the New Testament Church and even though that have Bibles that have the church in order God was still using Visions so God then told ananas now this is what I want you to do and when you get there you're going to meet this man and I've already give him a vision too well wait a minute I thought Visions wouldn't even supposed to be in the new test oh but you see they are and have seen in a vision a man named ananas coming in that's my God and putting his hand on him that he might re receive his sight I imagine ananas needed this reality of God because this man was killing Christians now you imagine he needed this Vindication I would too wouldn't you chapter 11 of the book of Acts verse 5 and then we'll close I was in the city of japa praying and in a trance I saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheep now remember this is Simon Peter let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me acts 16:9 and a vision appeared to Paul in the night and there stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying come over into Macedonia and help us so do we believe in Visions are they new testament teaching I want your response back are Visions in the New Testament was it God that said there won't be no more Visions in the New Testament we see God doing the exact opposite let me read one more and actually had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the Lord has called us for to preach the gospel unto them let's Stand Together praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus how many here tonight believes that God still deals with his people in this way do you see young people why we needed a prophet of God that would come in this day and would not be able to just rally the people around him and have great healing campaigns well we'll get to it maybe maybe next time but one of the the signs for sure that Jesus gave us and the scripture by which we would be able to know the difference between a true prophet and a false one is a false prophet will always try to broaden the narrow paths a false prophet will come by deceptive means means that will try to draw all the people after him he will soften the gospel make the gospel easier Jesus warned us that there would be false prophets that would come and they would be dressed in sheep's clothing but he said that inside they would be ravening wolves ravening tearing ripping dividing pulling aunder but a true prophet of God will tell the truth if his friends forsake Him He will not preach for money fame or Fortune truly that's the kind of prophet that God has sent us in this last day can you imagine them bringing brother brandom a check over a million dollars escorting it and bringing it to him and he turned it down how many preachers in this message would do that today a man that the denomination said brother brandom if you will back off of serpent seed water baptism there's not another gift on the field that can touch yours if you will back off from some of these things our brothers will get behind you it'll go around the world you imagine as a man brother Rob that he looked at it and thought Lord is this what I need to do should I do this but aren't you glad he didn't he would have had to compromise on serpent seed then that had another list now you got to compromise on women preachers and you got to compromise on this and you got to compromise on that and do you honestly believe that sign that presence of God would have ever worked the same it would not have worked the same oh he still had it sure God gives gessi and an indan giver but I'm so grateful that we had a man that was willing to take the way of the Lord's despised few I'm grateful God still got men tonight that's doing exactly the same thing let's bow our heads together if you would Heavenly Father we consider ourselves such a blessed people to be able to set under the opes of the reveal word of this hour oh my father how we would have set in the days of Paul and if we'd been privileged to be at Corinth or Ephesus or any of the other places that he made his missionary Journeys and heard him taught we would have been the first century Christians and we would have heard Peter give his his experiences with the Lord Jesus or John oh Father how blessed we would have been in that day but Lord we consider ourselves to be so blessed in our day and in one sense of the word we are more blessed because when Thomas was able to touch the nail prints and the scars in your side and he said my Lord and my God yet you said to him Thomas you have believed because you have seen but how much more blessed are they that have never seen and yet they believe there's young people standing here tonight that was never in one of brother Ram Services they never talked maybe some of them to eyewitnesses to verify what they're hearing on tape but they believe it with all of their hearts if there would be another generation before long all those eyewitnesses brother Harvey sister Shirley Lunsford said here in our church brother Byron Palmer also an eyewitness brother Brenham came to their home they was there at the tabernac was through many services eyewitnesses even still alive in our church brother Tim puit an eyewitness there at the meetings in sort in 1965 if time goes on these eyewitnesses will all be gone but the word will still stand true Lord Jes Jesus thank you for opening our eyes and letting us be part of the open vision of the end time bless these young people father I pray keep them by your grace in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you I love you all so much what I would have given if Carol and I and our teens or our 20s could have been able to heard these things I thank my goodness how much more I could have done for God you see you won't have to go through the years of unlearning a bunch of stuff stuff that you heard that you picked up and and still you'll hear things in the message and and those things will try to raise yourself up you don't know what that's not many of you never you've never had to do with it many of you were raised in in this church not in this church building but you know what I'm saying you were raised in the message don't take it for granted think how blessed you are that you don't have to struggle and wrestle with trying you in baptism and you don't have to wrestle with this and that and the other that a lot of the older people that come to our church you're bless young people may God bless [Applause] you thank you Lord

oh he's the name above all names in worthy of all praise my heart will seeing how great is our God [Music] 30 is coming into the message and one thing that brother Donnie mentioned uh brother Donnie mentioned at the end is that they wanted him to compromise on serpent seed and they wanted him to compromise on on water baptism well those are the things that got my attention that's what got my attention do not be afraid that it's what we believe is different okay it's very different than than when Christendom was and very different what I was hearing from the ministry as well as the message and basically I'd read the scripture first and I would go back and I'd read a sermon and I'd go back to find out where is that in scripture I was not wanting to sign up for anything and when I recognized the message dovetailing with the Scripture it was shocking to me how it did not it went against what I had been taught but it was exactly according to the word so I challenge you and God challenges Us Try Me look into the word and see if that's what Dove tales with the word and not with the world and that's what got my attention because it was different what they wanted him to compromise about is exactly what God hold of me and then I founded the word and then it gave me confidence it doesn't matter what man has to say about these things God has honored to his word will honor his word and honor his word in me that that was a progression and we ask you to do that even if you're young you don't want to just be in this church you want to go ahead and find God for yourself and let the Revelation grow in you according to the scripture Let's uh let's pray dear Lord thank you for your grace to us I thank you so much for the opportunity I thank you for the atmosphere in this building tonight Lord as you've come and and fellowship with us I thank you for Learning and and being a teacher to us teaching us more of your way and your your nature we thank you so much as we fall deeper and deeper in love we look forward to Heaven at continual unfolding of who you are and feel so blessed to be a part we are we're thankful for the differences that you are are in the world and that what the world has to offer did not satisfy the soul and didn't satisfy me but you have and I so thank you for it Lord than you are worth everything Lord we could ever hope and dream for and I pray and we'd Commit This service into your heart and into our hands in Jesus name amen God bless you all love you all thank you Brothers [Applause] [Music] oh every praise is to our
