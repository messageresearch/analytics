[0:00] the way of the slothful man is a heads
[0:03] of thorns but the way of the righteous
[0:07] is made plain and the word plain is
[0:10] paved this a divine ordained way but it
[0:17] isn't just him sitting around and
[0:19] waiting on God but this man actually so
[0:22] part of this man's character and trait
[0:24] that God identifies it as the man's way
[0:27] and not his way Laurie - God why the man
[0:31] is so in touch with God God gave him
[0:34] that seal in his heart the way of God is
[0:37] imprinted on his soul in so much that
[0:39] God would call it the man's way because
[0:42] the man was converted by the Spirit of
[0:45] God he used to run around is is to Drake
[0:47] he used to lie but he don't go no more
[0:50] and God so burst him by heavenly
[0:52] genetics that God put his own seed
[0:55] inside of that man or woman and breathes
[0:57] on them the Holy Ghost and God said I've
[1:00] got so much confidence in you I know
[1:02] you're not gonna fall I've sealed you to
[1:05] Eternity you are mine forever I am yours
[1:08] forever I'm gonna go ahead and call this
[1:11] your way the continued repetition of
[1:17] this kind of a life becomes habits of
[1:23] good behavior
[1:29] well I don't want to get in a ritual I
[1:32] see you don't want to get in a ritual
[1:34] doing right but you want to get an ax
[1:36] bitch'll forming of doing wrong are you
[1:38] an imbecile what's out of the idiotic
[1:41] found a family side you come from if I
[1:46] might have a form and a manner I'm gonna
[1:49] choose righteousness am I gonna do part
[1:52] of it without feeling I am because it's
[1:54] bred in me difficult in this man's way
[2:06] oh he's got him they just don't pay
[2:08] attention to her life thus awful man
[2:10] let's also say oh I said gravel road huh
[2:16] that'll hurt my feets huh I'll get dust
[2:20] on my new shoes oh but if I was to go
[2:25] for the church now I know I need more
[2:27] than what I got but what if I go to acts
[2:29] on that brother Donny oh god what if I
[2:34] was to get so emotional now I get up on
[2:36] Severson started running down the
[2:37] building they don't think I'm crazy
[2:39] oh my goodness what what about it no I
[2:43] think I'll just go on occasion and just
[2:46] kind of you know be a part of what's
[2:48] really going on but not really get in
[2:50] too deep I'll worry about brother Donny
[2:52] or some of those other people are having
[2:53] Valley probably they're fanatics well
[2:56] let me just go and settle it for you we
[2:58] are
[3:00] that's right football fans have fanatics
[3:04] wrestling people have fanatics
[3:06] basketball fans have fanatics I'm a
[3:09] fanatic for Jesus Christ I am addicted
[3:12] to him in his word you see the soulful
[3:18] person looks at of assets difficult
[3:19] since the diligent man looks has said
[3:30] where do we start
[3:37] sophomore man says what if I drop one of
[3:41] the big rocks the diligent man looks at
[3:48] it said God put it on my heart to come
[3:49] and have a meeting so it goes in down
[3:52] there and starts clicking on the low
[3:54] stable of a thing the bully of the town
[3:57] comes in so what's that guy done there
[3:59] sees a pressure so low means that hey no
[4:03] no making I run this town so nobody goes
[4:06] down there's a saying you know singing a
[4:08] song washing windows and doing this
[4:09] another get ready
[4:10] is that why your eyes at me I mean here
[4:12] the church they said although you're not
[4:14] around their son oh do you praise God
[4:17] okay all right you hear me you even have
[4:20] known me here you got to whip me first
[4:22] it all right first things first go ahead
[4:23] Rowley Center knocked him down God on
[4:25] top i'ma that's per barrel cross alone
[4:27] Jesus in the strength just beat the tar
[4:29] out of it me sir I'm the man got say
[4:31] first nut
[4:33] now slothful man would have packed up
[4:35] his briefcase his Windex and paper
[4:38] towels and left Dodge but you know what
[4:42] the diligent man's that I leave it here
[4:44] because God laid it on my heart to come
[4:48] oh my goodness friends may I say Donna
[4:51] may it not be just preachers that will
[4:53] say that but may housewives say my young
[4:55] men say it may young ladies say our God
[4:58] has told me to be a Christian I'm
[5:00] packing up I leaving I'm staying right
[5:03] here I'm not gonna be slothful but the
[5:16] source for person can be a calculator
[5:27] square I don't say there's no way that
[5:32] can work at you it won't work out that's
[5:34] what I was thinking too it's too big if
[5:43] everybody at Happy Valley was a saint
[5:45] I'd go
[5:49] I know some people that go up Erebor
[5:52] they got problems we don't deny that but
[5:56] the main thing we push around here is a
[5:58] problem fixer it's not how many problems
[6:03] with God is how many our God can take
[6:05] care of little slothful man I look at
[6:09] well I tell you so what a little bit of
[6:17] courage he has he talks himself out of
[6:19] it
[6:21] what's all said done sets down grabs his
[6:27] remote or his game things and merges
[6:35] himself in a world that does not in
[6:43] terms of the air conditioner and drinks
[6:45] an RC you see what a thoughtful person
[6:56] looks at as a hedge possible the
[7:02] diligent man looks at the hedge as being
[7:05] road level glory be to God so let's at
[7:16] Goliath it could count over brother Saul
[7:20] the rest of mrs. Lord David looked at
[7:24] the Prophet said his head was the size
[7:26] of a washtub he mention it I balls about
[7:30] that big around his dream and dancing in
[7:32] the Sun David looking at his finger
[7:35] stretching I stood there about a month
[7:38] or so ago in that valley
[7:39] come on tell me I felt like David well
[7:44] we stood there and pulled off a side of
[7:45] the road that kind of shot up Ike this
[7:47] brother Tim's putting the video and
[7:48] stuff for us together free to be able to
[7:50] see it the little hill come up like this
[7:52] the Philistines on this side here so on
[7:54] this side and a little drive broke down
[7:55] on the bottom I went down there and
[7:57] picked up a bunch of them little stones
[7:58] I thought mom what a privilege it is to
[8:01] stand right here or
[8:03] David stood so many many years ago
[8:05] hallelujah
[8:06] and he walked down and grabbed a whole -
[8:08] that you imagine look at that's the
[8:10] glory to God with a target that big how
[8:12] could you miss it but it depends on if
[8:17] you're a diligent man us awful man a
[8:19] slothful man's at all gone
