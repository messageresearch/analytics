[0:00] we ought to be going forward as Moses
[0:03] said God said Moses tell him to go
[0:05] forward you're not to be idle for the
[0:08] kingdom of God because idleness produces
[0:12] a powerless life I don't listen the
[0:17] kingdom of God idleness in the family of
[0:19] God produces a powerless life you've got
[0:24] to be a person with a vision a runner
[0:26] has to have a vision he has to always
[0:28] keep it before him he has to constantly
[0:31] remind himself of the purpose and the
[0:34] reason but before he runs that race he's
[0:36] disciplined in himself how he sleeps
[0:39] Holly eats how he lives he's training
[0:41] constantly even the Apostle Paul says
[0:44] that and says those that strive for the
[0:46] mastery they do it for a carnal crown
[0:49] but we for a spiritual reward it says
[0:52] they do they do moderate they do bring
[0:55] their body into subjection that they
[0:57] have discipline in all areas of their
[0:59] life you've got to eat the right things
[1:04] and it takes discipline to eat the right
[1:09] things and it takes more discipline than
[1:13] that to not eat the wrong
[1:19] yeah it's a lot easier for me to look at
[1:23] that bowl of greens and broccoli and
[1:25] cabbage and spinach and force myself to
[1:28] eat it that's a lot easier than looking
[1:29] at those doughnuts and that sugar and
[1:32] that coconut cream pie and saying now
[1:36] but you've got to be disciplined because
[1:42] you've got a vision why does the why
[1:44] does a person how can they do that
[1:45] because they've seen an image in their
[1:48] mind of themself as a healthier more
[1:51] vibrant more in shape person and so they
[1:54] hold that image in their mind let me say
[1:57] this to you my brother I put the image
[1:59] in your mind of an overcoming Christian
[2:01] on fire with the baptism of the Holy
[2:04] Ghost busy about the kingdom of God and
[2:07] then gets upon yourself to become what
[2:10] you see
[2:12] [Applause]
