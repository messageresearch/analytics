screen aren't you glad he's alive how do you know he's alive I know he's alive I've seen him do Miracles that's that's one way I know he's alive I've seen him bring me from a sinner to what I am I know he's alive I've seen him bring bring me through many hard times in my life and bring me up on top so I know he's alive the gates and doors bar all the windows fastened down I spent the night in sleeplessness Rose at every sound half in Hopeless sorrow half in fear the day we find the soldiers breaking through to Dr us all away but just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall the gate began to Rattle and a voice began to call I hurried to the window I took down into the street expecting swords and torches and the the sound of solders feet there was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in John stood there beside me as she told us where she'd been she said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where the stones been rolled away and now his body he isn't there we both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead we found the stone in the empty tomb just the way that Mary said but the whining sheet that wrapped him in was just an empty shell however where they taken him was more than I could tell was something strange that happened there just what I did not know John believed a miracle but I just turned to go circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high cuz I'd seen them crucify him then I saw him [Music] die back inside the house again the guilt and anguish [Music] came everything I'd promised him just added to my shame when it last it came to choices I denied I knew his name even if he was a [Music] life it wouldn't be the [Music] same suddenly the air was filled with strange and sweet perfume light that came from everywhere draw Shadows from the room Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide I fell down on my knees and just clung to him and [Music] cried like this then he raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes Love Came shining out from him like sunlight from the sky guilt to my confusion disappeared in sweet relief [Music] and every fear I'd ever had just melted into [Music] peace oh he's alive he's alive he's alive and we're forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he is alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive [Music] hallelujah praise the Lord go ahead give him a hand clap he deserves it thank you Jesus praise the Lord praise the lord well if he is alive and we believe he is I guess the next question might be what are we going to do with him what are we going to do about him and what are we going to do with what he's done for us how he affected our lives today is a day day that Christendom acknowledges as the resurrection or like that wasn't this particular day but it's a day that we've set aside to be able to acknowledge what our Lord has done and we are so grateful today aren't we but what's sad about it to me is that tomorrow the majority of a lot of the church people will go right back to drink and smoking lying cheating running around doing whatever which means to me Easter didn't really have much effect on them at all but I'm so glad that Easter is not one day a year amen I don't know about you I enjoy Easter every day of the year let's turn to Luke chapter 7 if you would Luke 7: 44 now it's not going to be about the tomb today it's not going to be about the Roman guards and all of that but we'd like to focus on if he is alive and he has needs desires from his people are we going to be able to meet them or are we going to repeat the situ situation of Luke 7 we'll resume our scripture from the woman who's not been invited to the dinner that Jesus is at and the Simon the Pharisee has treated him bad cold and different reminds me of this world today we'll pick up in verse 44 and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon which is strange isn't it so he turns to her but he don't actually speak to her he turns to her and looks at her but he says unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hasth not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hasth anointed my feet with ointment Jesus is contrasting of course between her and Simon every that Simon neglected to do she did and did it better than he would have now look in verse 47 wherefore I say unto thee still talking to sment her sins which are many are forgiven now remember during this whole scenario he's not said one word to her yet so like he's not even acknowledged her by words I want you to listen to this carefully for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same love us little you know I found that principle to be exactly the same today this just one reason why a lot of the people that have been raised in message churches and they sat there and they've been raised with all the right morals and boy they can claim the moral High Ground I never drunk I never took dope I never done this this and this what I found with a lot of them is there're some of the hardest people you'll ever reach in your life because it's like they was raised up in church cut their teeth on a message Pew they started hearing the prophet said this and the prophet said that from the time they was that high so when they go to run it into people that really need forgiveness they ain't got much and if a person falls over and over and over again flat of their face they'll cut them off you know why they was forgiven of little themselves initially and they love little these are the words of Jesus now but to whom little is Forgiven the same love us little I don't know about you I don't want want to be that person I never did drink I never did smoke never took dope in my life never done any of that but as a kid I read this scripture and I purposed in my heart people's asked me Brother D why don't you give your testimony of how this I said I ain't really got that much to say would take me about 10 minutes so I ain't really got you know a lot of people got this big long gigantic testimony they was out into this and that and the other it takes days and days and talk about it well doesn't really but when I read this I remembered as a kid I thought God don't let this paralyze my love for you because I never did do a whole lot that somehow I can't love you greatly now listen but to whom little is Forgiven the same love us little I love this verse 48 and he said un to her so the first words she hears directly from him to her are these words thy sins Lord are forgiven praise the Lord aren't you glad yours have been to let's go before the Lord now in prayer Lord Jesus as we have gathered here today we're thankful Lord hearing the songs that we've heard sung about how great you are in your resurrection and what you've done for us we are so happy dear God but we're thankful that tomorrow morning when we get up this happiness won't have to wait till another year but we plan on being happy tomorrow and the next day day and the next day because of the Resurrection we don't have to fear what life holds dear God we're asking today that you would help us anoint me Father speak through me shut my mouth to anything that would displease you Lord you see this prayer cost I have in my hand for sister Ruth Ward you see these needs in her body we're asking you that You' be mindful of her I pray Lord Jesus you'd also remember sister Jetta Stockton in the hospital father would you just touch her today other needs among your people around the world touch them Lord come among us today heal the sick set the captive free deliver those that are bound filled with the Holy Ghost get us all ready to leave this place in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated today is not only the day of worship and celebration as the word is used for Easter but it is also a day of celebration for the transgender Community yeah transgender day of visibility and our president stood and from the White House came the great news and they're so happy that it landed on Easter and if our president don't repent the man will be annihilated in hell oh my if our nation does not repent the majority of Americans will be destroyed in the Lake of Fire amen and if you're here today and you're lost if you don't make peace with God you will wind up in the same place amen but you don't have to you see it's all by choice well what if I'm not bride that doesn't even matter if you're not bride and you don't want to be lost you don't have to you choose to be lost you fight your way to hell every day amen you fight over a mama's prayers a daddy's prayers a grandmother or a preacher a church whatever it is our setting opens again with this man which has a very hypocritical heart a man that is chosen this particular time to be able to humiliate and embarrass the Lord Jesus he feels like he'll be really applauded by maybe the scribes and the upper echelon the Pharisee move no doubt they'll meet him down at the marketplace tomorrow and they'll shake his hand and say wow that was absolutely phenomenal how did you ever orchestrate that in your mind to work this out where you could get this actor this impostor Jesus soall the son of God God the Messiah you tricked him into coming and then once you got him there you didn't wash his feet you gave him no oil no kiss I've got to congratulate you it was well planned but it just so happened to be there was a seat of God there that was going to interrupt Simon's plans I'm glad God still got them scattered everywhere don't you her conduct showed that this woman was truly pentant desired to be cleansed from what she was now we know her occupation was she was a woman of ill Fame probably wasn't a time that that happened that she didn't feel terrible about it wishing to God she could get delivered the law condemned her people condemned her no doubt the women of the city would have nothing to do with her they looked down on her they shamed her they ridiculed her but this had such a hold of her life she didn't feel like she could ever be free but you see when Jesus has a name on his personal diary there's not enough powers in hell to keep them from Redemption her penitent attitude and her reaction to that attitude and because her love was what Jesus called great now wonder where she got this great love cuz she hadn't even got the Holy Ghost yet actually this woman never repents by words show me her repentant prayer dear Lord Jesus I pray today heavenly father that you would just come on the scene and pardon me of my sins we don't even find the word sorry we don't find the word repent but what we see is her repentant attitude reflected by works and bearing his shame now notice the contrast between the Pharisee and the woman how different they were Simon was so indifferent toward the lord Jesus so his indifference was contrasted by her penitent attitude and the Lord Jesus contrasts the both of them and these verses that we just read so she was so earnest Earnest and so desirous to do something for him he withheld water from him and she gave water from her eyes she gave precious tears now I want you to think about yourself today on this Easter day and as many have gathered around the world and already in New Zealand the service is there brother Daryl and and Brother David they're about 18 hours ahead of us across the International Date Line in the Pacific so they're about 18 hours ahead of us so it's already uh well past their Easter services no doubt in Louisiana it's it's already getting winding down they're fixing to eat breakfast get on the bus head back home different parts of the world Europe they've done had their Easter services I've done got greetings from Europe and and Africa this morning on the Easter but as we're gather here today I wonder how many people here and how many people around the world that have celebrated Easter but in reality they will do the exact same thing some of our churches in America today have set aside this day and they're going to have drag shows titling it Drag Me to Church it's no wonder that our nation will be annihilated I know this is not the Easter Sermon you expected to hear is it it breaks my heart as an American to think the bombs already have our names written on them is it any Wonder we take this blessed thing of the resurrection of our Lord and we do want to the very sins of Sodom which is an abomination in the eyes of God oh brother Donnie don't say that don't say that you'll get us in trouble the way I look at it I'll get in trouble if I don't see it I'd rather be in trouble with the world than in trouble with God so what did they do I wonder how many churches today have sang and they worshiped and they've raised their hands and they've had their drag queens to celebrate Easter what an Abomination Jesus don't want no drag queen in Memorial oh he will he will Ex he will let you come to him like that but you won't remain one I said you won't remain one you go from a drag queen to being the Queen of Heaven if you get get saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost I wonder how many churches today held water from him I wonder how many was held oil wow Simon did not give one drop of oil this woman broke open a whole box and she didn't go to Big Lots to get it but she went to the most expensive perfume place in the whole vicinity imagine her as she walks out of there with this in her hands and probably she's never even held such an expensive exotic oil in her life little bit of calamus mixed with just a tinch of camper a little scent wood a little bit of myrrh and the aroma was so powerful as it was released out of this Teakwood box and she just just savored it walking it down and she could have kept it she could have took it back home but she bought it for a reason and the name of the reason was Jesus I if you didn't come today to show off your new dress sisters if your brother's got a new tire or a new suit or a new sport coat I hope you didn't come today to show it off I hope the reason you came to church today was the same name why she came to Simon's house the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah not one drop of oil was given by Simon but she break open the whole box he treated him with humiliation and shame and despite and looked down his nose at him as an underling but when she come in she treated him like a prince imagine in the same room one gives no water the other gives water from the tears as one of the father's Church fathers wrote blood from her heart weeped its way out her eyes and she kisses his feet Simon gives his no kiss upon his neck but she kisses over and over and over his feet in the same building two totally different things going on oh I if there's going to be any water today let it come from me if there's going to be any oil today let it come from me if there's going to be any kissing the sun let it come from me may I never be guilty of going to church no matter where it's at around the world and fulfilling the part of Simon how many feels that way today the water for the feet the kiss for the neck the oil for the head now all of these were ordinary Oriental courtesies so this wasn't like it was a great extravagant thing that Jesus should have got everybody else in that building already got that so he was left out intentionally our nation our world is so consumed with everybody's rights but they've left out Jesus rights Jesus has a right to a church he has a right to a people filled with the Holy Ghost he has a right to a church that he himself purchased but do they want to hear that do away with it but we're of a different genos a different seed line when Jesus would justify this woman in the eyes of Simon he would used her works because that's the only thing Simon would be able to relate to he wasn't a man of the heart he was a man of the head so he couldn't relate to Faith but when Jesus went to acknowledge this woman to herself he never mentioned her works it mentioned her faith never mentioned the oil never mentioned the water never mention what one of her Works want you notice and God gifts always found their places you are identified by your gift now keep this in your mind when we're talking about Simon and this woman that you are identified by your gift now the prophet is preaching his Christmas message here in 1963 God's gifts always find their places so he's talking about the Magis and he's talking about the father who had a child that died and the little girl all she wanted was a little doll and the man went out of his mind and the man looking for his little daughter thinking she was still alive and he found a little dolly it was torn it was ragged but he wanted to take his little girl a doll so of all stories a prophet used this in this sermon and he said that was appropriate gift for a little girl now I want you to see think today what you give the Lord Jesus not just on Easter but every day tomorrow Tuesday Wednesday the rest of your life that actually tells how and what you think of him now listen carefully you are identified by your gift that you give your entire being to it to identified deity so if all you give Jesus is we see you here today on Easter Sunday and we won't see you again to Christmas or to next Easter or Mother's Day or something like that that actually tells what you think about Jesus because your gift identifies what importance you think he should have you understand Simon's deprival of the water and the kiss and the oil and just the common courtesy it showed what he thought about Jesus little did that man know God walked into his house and God set in one of his chairs I hope everybody here today recognizes allmighty God is in this building this morning the angels of the Lord are here with us in this service today and our gifts back to him whether it's praise raising our hands adoration Lord I love you I worship you Jesus by your gifts back to him today and every other day tells how you value him in your life so if you speak to him every now and then that's your gift you worship him every now and then that's your gift that tells how you value Jesus Christ by the gift you give him now listen this is a powerful statement you're identified by your gift that you give your entire being to it to identify deity then you identify yourself with deity by giving all you are now you see this one thing that separates the bride from the church the church will never be able to do this they will never be able to give everything they are to him and by doing that that identifies their position of where they are but the bride has a god-given ability it may take her years in spite of all of her mistakes and failures but she will finally reach that place one day that she will be able to give everything she is and when she does she steps into that sphere of deity herself it ain't no wonder Satan wants you to keep an Avenue of your heart a secret besetting sin that only you and God know about because Satan knows if you're ever able to arrive at that spot that you can say Lord I give you everything I am my pride my arrogance my temper my habits if they're wrong whatever it is that don't mean you won't be bothered now but you finally reached a spot where you could give it all to him amen notice how he says then you identify yourself with deity by giving all you you are what you are to deity himself now the anot type of this was over in the Book of Genesis whenever the first two worshippers outside the garden of garden gate brought an offering to the Lord Hebrews 11:4 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice a more excellent now Cain offered a sacrifice but it was a sacrifice of botney life no blood No sacrifice a pumpkin don't cry when you cut it a tomato Don't Cry tears whenever you cut it right but an animal an animal would have to feel the pain of death it's amazing how we trade dead things for live things look at a lot of the sports and things that people get so caught up in what is it a dead thing whether that's a football a baseball a basketball a soccer ball pickle ball whatever it is look at the things that people worship their cars their homes their jobs every one of those things and many more that I can name every one of them are dead they have no life no life and yet they will put those dead things before the resurrection and the life the Lord Jesus see think of how that Satan has got us into such a trap that we will put dead things before the only thing that can give us life now watch and as Paul goes on in this that Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain so Cain did but his excelled in Glory by which he obtained witness now notice this is very unusual witness and yet the Bible doesn't tell us of anybody else being there except Cain and Abel but yet it goes on to say by which he obtained witness that he was righteous and how was this witness obtained that God testifying of his gifts Oh you mean so God himself testified now when you compare this back with the Book of Genesis and theodosian one of the early writers in the 2 Century took this word he was actually the first one to take the Hebrew Bible and be able to translate it over into the Greek so the New Testament Greeks would be able to read and understand the Old Testament so he was quite a a a scholar of Greek of taking the the Hebrew word and bringing them over so he picked up this word and he says that whenever God looked upon Abel's sacrifice that the word means to ignite with a fire so God look so intensely at Abel's sacrifice that God set it on fire with his eyes I hope if he's not done that to you he will before this service is over today believe it or not I just described to you receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you can jump shout holl and scream and run all that's wonderful and good but if you ever get the Holy Ghost The Eyes Of God look so intently upon your soul as it were that he sets you on fire and you'll be on fire the rest of your life notice Paul says that abble offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained witness so there is worshiping praying praising God offers the lamb takes the knife The Rock cuts it and he he goes through all the sacrifice and while there oh Adonai yahe Elohim and He blesses God and he's standing in there and all of a sudden and he opens his eyes and he sees his lamb on fire but he wasn't the only one his a brother had decorated his altar with flowers and beautiful roses and lies had all of his produce laid out and he worked hard no fire no witness no God nowhere you see that altar represented every church that does not want the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and there's millions of them today they gather and they'll have the the Easter lies on the Altar and the beautiful flowers and the arrangement and my their music would outdo ours 10 to one their ability to sing and their preacher would preach a whole lot nicer and have his words Al together much nicer than I could ever preach and their congregation will dress so nice Rolex watches everywhere and jaguars and this and that and the other on the parking lot but I wonder if there'll be one of them that'll bear witness of the presence of God being in the service do we want his witness or not not or do we want to just gather like everybody else and go home and then go eat lunch and say it was a good day if he doesn't bear witness that we are preaching the truths we are just as lost as anyone else notice this in the unwelcome Christ Jesus with dirty feet it does something to me to say that God Jesus the invited guest the prince of Glory the Fountain of Life and unwelcome with dirty feet sitting there with dung on his feet from the road so here is Jesus sitting in Simon's house sweating he's perspired Jesus would have had body order Believe It or Not Just Like You and I the donkeys the cattle the sheep used the same roads that the pedestrians would have used Jesus would have had some of that manure mixed with the dust on his feet so he's sitting there smelling sweat has marked his clothes and he himself himself can smell the dung on his feet and you imagine everybody else oh boy he's some Holy Roller ain't he how can they even serve him he stink so bad Son of God Messiah Christos anointed one I wonder how much he was laughed at today on Easter Sunday amongst all the rest of them all polished and smelling good there he said with droop weary face sweat stains on his beard eyes drooped down unkissed Jesus embarrassed Jesus humiliated Jesus unwelcome Hallelujah but he had a woman that was willing to bear his reproach before his resurrection he's got thousands times thousands of men and women today who are willing to bear his reproach after his resurrection because see we are the same type of people that she was we are willing to bear his reproach laugh at me if you please make fun of him if you wish to I really don't care I'm willing to Bear the reproach of the word today oh my I want you to listen to this Jesus wants to be kissed can you imagine Jesus wants to be kissed there's a scripture in the Bible that said kiss the son lest he be angry that's right Jesus wants to be k kissed did you ever kiss him sure you can he's sitting there unwelcome Dirty Feet Jesus a dirty feet oh don't that make you feel funny Jesus Dirty Feet unwelcome look what you do with him today instead of bringing him into your big fine Church you push him off in some little Mission Down on the Corner Corner the Lord's given us a nice place I'm grateful for don't you but I'll tell you one thing I hope we never get to a place that we tell Jesus you ain't welcome in there church we don't want no running we don't want no people screaming at the altar we don't want no jabbering in that tongue stuff we don't want none of that stuff around here but as long as I'm the pastor we anybody with me the prophet told us that people tend to when they get a new church they tend to get cold and starchy well I say we break that Norm I say we refuse to fit in that quote T to you now you can fit in that quote if you wish to but I ain't going to notice this if someone came at your house and you didn't entertain them they wouldn't come many times maybe that's what's a matter tonight maybe that's what's a matter around our homes and around our churches we're afraid or ashamed to entertain Jesus you're afraid somebody will hear you say Amen you mean just by saying amen you are actually entertaining Jesus if you believe a servant of God is Anointed by the Holy Ghost and brother Pete stood up here on Wednesday night and ministered the word didn't he do an awesome job and ministered to us the word of God and you realize you're not Amen in brother Pete you're not Amen in brother Donnie so much you're Amen in the word it's Jesus anointing that man and when you say Amen men women children boys girls when you say amen you are entertaining Jesus Christ well just from that I'd say a lot more of you need to entertain Jesus with more of your amens instead of sitting there looking at me come on you're afraid to raise up your hands and give him praise you're ashamed cause your neighbor sitting there or somebody else what do I I care about your neighbor Worship the Lord you asked him you invited him then worship him when he comes Hallelujah when we invite him to come in your then when he comes let's worship him let's praise him let's adore [Applause] him oh my I love the way he words this there's just something about this Moody Institute vernacular that brother Brenham gained from going to Bible Seminary and all the years that he spent in Latin and Greek and all of that what we need tonight is an oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place hallelujah what we need tonight is an old fasting Jesus Christ entertaining place is that what you all want Word of Life to be an oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place but I'll tell you friend that don't fit with a lot of modern theology that don't fit with a lot of modern churches are not interested in entertaining Jesus they want to entertain the mayor or they want to entertain the governor or they want to entertain the rich and the famous I say we forget all of that and we make up in our minds by the grace of God we are dedicating this building to be an oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place where the sick can be healed and the lost can be found and those without the Holy Ghost can be filled and those those that are backslid can be renewed and those Hallelujah that are bound with homosexuality can be delivered and the oppressed can be raised up hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah what we need to is an oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place where men and women can forget themselves and entertain Jesus but he comes anyhow even if you just give him five minutes a day over in the closet down in the basement he will take it he will take whatever you offer him a't that awful you and I would never look at it quite like this I'm sure and then the prophet said that shows to me he's God to me so out of your busy day if you wind up giving him 10 minutes just him and you alone not you on texting and you you know checking this and looking at that and all that just just you and him alone and you just give him five 10 minutes he'll take it and turn around and say thank you thank you for spending a little bit of time with me and me to world to you know the truth of it is all of us want to feel like we're loved don't we don't we want to feel like we're loved don't we want to feel like that we're accepted don't we want to feel like we're a part of something don't you understand so does he I read a quote the other day where the Prophet said whenever I founding fathers and whenever they wrote that Declaration of Independence and they set an empty chair at the table he said I believe with all of my heart Jesus Christ set in that chair but do you think they want him anymore you think they want him in Congress they want him in Senate you think our White House wants him no oh some of you got your hopes Donald Trump's going to win it all back and bring America back to Revival that man is going to go to hell too if he don't get saved well come on you bunch of Republicans Or democrats whatever I ain't preaching politics I'm preaching salvation you don't go to heaven because you're a former president or a current president you go to heaven because you meet God's [Applause] requirements here he's sitting in the Pharisees house God walked in the door and nobody paid any attention to him they were too busy that's what we are today we're too busy making prelates we're too busy to see if this person's baptized correct or not we're too busy to see what position he has what can he do with him in the church we're too busy with people and the things of the church to let Christ come by without entertaining we're too busy to see everything's carried on just so un so we fail to entertain Jesus after we've invited him to our place many times you're too busy at home in your home life you got so many things you have to do you can't take time to pray just too busy how many can say amen amen now let's look at the Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse1 this is after Solomon and the shulamite or married she has done something that more than likely every Christian has done at one time or another she actually went into the bedroom and went to bed without him she didn't wait on him and he he comes to the door to where she is oh brother you talking about reminding you of this Ley and age I am coming to my garden Song of Solomon 5 ver1 I coming into my garden my sister my spouse I've gathered my myrr with my spice now remember the Song of Solomon was considered so intimate and and such a book of mystery by the Jews it was called the holy of holies of the Old Testament Jewish parents would not let their kids read it until they were several years old no doubt they still don't understand it to this day now in this the time of the Lord is answering to the antitype of Solomon and the shulamite is the antitype of the bride and our Lord's satisfaction is in his church and and Christ is delighted with the offerings of his people which he says this by I have gathered my myrr and my spice and then the next thing we see is the Lord satisfaction is found in his people's love as I said last Sunday it just about overwhelms me to think that he would condescend to such a level of dependency upon Humanity you know that is that day and age we're living in you can't depend on nobody right the way I look at it there's going to be at least a few contractors a few painters a few few electricians few carpet layers a few this that and that and that and that that'll be saved so the Lord can prove to the devil that he can save them right and if they give you their word they will keep it or at least let you know why they can't I I figur there'll even be a few Christians that'll be there because Christians are just about as bad you know they give you a word about this and other it don't mean nothing shame on us our word should be our bond amen come on now children don't get that old Leo to seeing thing on you it is lying you know if you tell somebody that you won't be there and something comes up at least let them know if you owe them tell them brother I'm sorry I'm going to pay you but I just can't do it don't just take for granted that it's okay it's not okay well who in the world was that for you or you or well we don't know but our Lord's satisfaction again is the love for his people because he so desired to love and to be loved notice he says I'm coming to my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered my myrr with my spice I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I've drunk my wine and my milk eat oh friends drink yay drink abundantly oh beloved I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey he takes such intense SA isfaction in the things that you and I give to him we are the ones bringing these offerings of the myrr and the frankincense which is the aromatics that FS the room of his presence where we are and then the honeyone and and the drink and the eats and all that he's going to have that's where he gets something ministered to him that angels can never touch oh and yet he receives it with our flaws he receives it tainted with humanity and acknowledges it as if though it was from the Holy Angels thems to hear him describe it it was perfect he accepts our love and says I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I've drunk my wine and my milk so his satisfaction with our love and praise and worship and adoration as if he's eating and drinking this is what it does to our Lord when you worship When you pray when you praise you are watering remember the prophet talking about Rebecca when she took the baales of water and she watered the camel the very Holy Spirit he said which was going to carry her back when you Worship the Lord and praise him and bless his name you are ministering to the very power that's going to change your body drink room and she is she is not she's not don't you understand that's why we need AET Messenger to come in this day and be the friend of the brid and stand there with a Godly jealousy and say don't let me down don't let me down say a Chase virgin why because he's going to have to answer to God remember when he stood the R Bo and he heard the music F music come and then he saw that Al she come through and then he saw the church

commission sin she had committed you know what Simon sins were sins of omission he omitted one he omitted oil he omitted the kiss you understand Church understand that's where many of us fit and sins

them the de of heaven we have all the time doesn't mean that much to us but remember that some places get an inch and a half rain in a year's time 2 in Rain 6 in in a whole year so for them to do was a great thing and God would allow the the way the saltwater would be able to rise from the Mediterranean and come in and it would be able to release it right now in Africa they've been able to develop a way to be able to get water even to the desert and Africa to where they catch ex scams and they will comeing in because as it comes over in the mountains and the sea water will come up it rises up and it's amazing how the Lord has a desination plan in the air and he will allow that salt water to come up be able to perform vapor and rise up and they have these nets that are hundreds and hundreds of meters long and they will catch it and the deceleration of this and the salt will absolutely leave outside the water and they run it down into little strains and it will drip drip drip just thousands and thousands of little strains and then they R it down into the reservoirs and there what the trial people will get the water and he had stood out there to wor that it was so long that his locks for dripping with the D my head sh is deep and my rocks of the Dos of night he pleases he pleas and and begs to be admitted even under the character of a PO W fa you know see I'm master I'm the Al I'm Omega but he relates himself as a stranger I found this very interesting in studying this it has been said he has not merely given us the ideal standard after which we are to seek but he has also preserved for us the humble patterns of those who have striven to reach the utmost Heights who have climed a good way towards it but who nevertheless have proved that though they were the best of men they were men at best I don't care who you want how you sh or how you think you want you [Applause] were I'm as you are I'm so glad I have a spotless sacrifice C at my best I'm still a man come on

preached about that's where you have been or maybe some of you are today but let me tell you something you don't have to stay we've invited Jesus to come in today as I said earlier in the morning it'll all be Post Easter Easter stuff so people will go back to their life before Easter Sunday they'll do whatever they're going to do and we don't want to be that kind of people we want to be the kind of people that we worship Jesus on Monday just like we do on Sunday yes we make him a part of our home part of our daily activities a part of our life every day yes we entertain him we love him we talk to him we worship Him Hallelujah I wondering how many with me here today want to make a commitment to the Lord Lord Jesus I want to praise you more than ever before I want to love you I want to make room in my home my life for you Lord anybody with all your heart Lord Jesus as we raise our hands in your presence first of all we pray you'd forgive us our life gets so busy and L to see him and really the majority of it has nothing to do with Heaven has nothing to do with the Rapture has nothing to do with us being ready for the Rapture it's just life and we reach an age and we say well it'll it'll change after I get out of college then then it'll we have all these different dreams before us I've got to do this and I've got to do that and I've got to do something else and then it'll
