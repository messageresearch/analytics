glad he's so mindful of us I'll tell you sometimes it's hard to keep your eyes or out on him somebody sent me a picture today by the wrong Spencer it was it was the Lord Jesus and he was in the midst of the sea and he was standing there in the midst of the sea and lightning and clouds and waves and the billows and the artists had did it in a very very good way and said don't keep your eyes on the storm but keep your eyes on me but it was amazing to look at it and how your eyes would tend to go toward the water and your eyes would tend to go toward the clouds your eyes would tend to go toward the storm but there he was right in the middle of it they answer and you can see in life it can certainly be that way the things that would go through the age that we're living their time that we're dealing with all the things that around us every day of her life humanly will gravitate right toward them clouds and those billows of the sea and my the abyss and the darkness and the depth and the uncertainty and the unknown that's what gets us as human sometimes it's just the uncertainty of things and the unknown but I'm grateful I don't know what the future holds but I know who holds a the same one who holds that as hold in our hand god bless you let's turn to Hebrews chapter 4 - now I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus certain nice to see y'all again trust you you're doing well during this difficult times and hard times hopefully it won't be too much longer we can all gather together again and we won't be segregated I thought that was illegal Cova changed a lot of things that knit I'm just grateful we can meet together though I'm just so grateful we're not having to meet I appreciate all these musicians but I'm glad to see y'all smile and faces well sometimes you frown but for the most part I'm glad to see your faces out there it really makes us it makes a difference also I want to share something with you that I've got a phone call from brother Randy get some dinner on Monday and he was just really happy and elated and crying and rejoicing because he had just come from a doctor and as you know brother Randy's been dealing with some serious things in his body and they've been treating him with chemo a couple places in his body and the doctor had done scan on him and one one one of the places was a significant difference reduction in the size and the other one was good as well and they were just so happy and so pleased and so actually going to extend it and give him a couple more treatments and we rejoice no I am more grateful so we just want to remember amen hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest this term was never used in the entirety of the Old Testament no Levite can be called this no son of Aaron could be called this we have a great high priest that is passed in to the heavens now Paul wants to make sure that the Saints then the Saints down through the ages and us as well that we understand what passed into the heavens it was not a theophany only it was not deity only but it was to some what he said Jesus the Son of God which is the resurrected created human body of God that has now been elevated into the office of the great high priest seeing then we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession oh I see so we needed that kind of a foundation to help us hold on to our profession I noticed the way links this seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession so apparently we can't lose it praise the Lord I remember your profession is not your salvation but it's what you confess and what you believe notice this in verse 15 for they have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points everybody believes that all points all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need that is therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy in talking to people that are lost a sinner can't come boldly to the throne of God now we're talking about saints but sometimes Saints need a bold assurance let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy not salvation not forgiveness of our sins when I tell my becoming renewed now but compassion the word means compassion an open heart from the Almighty that we can obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need there's anybody there tonight time of need let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus I imagine it would be hard for us to even know how many times this scripture has been read for over 2,000 years since Paul was inspired to write it down how many Saints going through such hard times read it they were inspired labor uplifted they were helped they were encouraged here we are at the end of time and we are reading it again tonight and we are blessed we are encouraged and we are helped because we are living in a time of great need but Lord Jesus we believe what you anointed your prophet to say that we can have boldness so that we could come to you to the throne of grace and find Mercy that would help us in the time of need father we bring our needs our petitions our requests before not the judgment throne but the throne of grace and mercy we are so grateful tonight first of all that we can call you Papa that we can say you're our father then to know that you love us so much Lord that you're mindful of us so we bring our needs and petitions before you ask you to be mindful help me that I can get out of the way too now father that you can speak through me I need your help Lord granted I pray father in Jesus name and the Saints said god bless you may be seated I marvel when I look at what our Lord Jesus has done for us in the act of canosa sub emptying himself out and stripping himself down making himself of no reputation stripping himself of omnipotence omniscience omnipresence all the things that he laid aside that we might be helped in the time of need to do all that within itself to me as phenomenal but once he makes this great surrender and sacrifice then he wants to partnership man in all of his falls and all of his weaknesses and all of his shortcomings and make it so that the blessings of God the power of God even the fullness of the redemption of God will be God and man partner shipping together now synced enou matter how much God wants to save the world tonight he cannot and will not if they don't want to be saved now according to the scripture it's not his will that any should perish right so does that mean everybody will be saved no because he will allow man's will to actually so coincide with the will of God that God would say if I would my own will I would save everyone whether they wanted to be saved or not I'm gonna save him because I don't want anyone to be lost but to be just he says I will leave man on the grounds that are placed Adam I'm instead of me forcing my sovereign will on man I will let man choose so a man does not wish to be saved I will not save him against his will now to me that's wonderful that's phenomenal and it shows the justice of God coinciding with the sovereignty of God but now let's bring it on down to the category of the elect that God still leaves us a choice of course our biggest mistakes in life are based on error free moral agency oh we love it so much and we're so proud of it when you're gonna realize it's your enemy you're free moral agency is what got you in the mists you're in tonight but yet God leaves it there but God not only works that in partnerships that into his sovereign will but God also partnerships the administration of grace that will be ministered to the Saints of God through the Melchizedek Priesthood from the throne of grace through the mediatorial work of the son of God down through his people into the church ages and it will not be that God will just sovereignly throw out all kinds of blessings and all kinds of good things and you and I are saying I don't want I don't yeah I'm gonna throw them on you anyhow Harris joined your speech I don't want to piss I'd rather be depressed I'd rather be sad I know you're not gonna be sad you're one of our young ones but that's sad technology of your face I want to make you smile I don't want to go to church I don't care I'm gonna make you go to church it doesn't even do that to us praise the Lord which is sad really because it means that we could be a lot further up in the presence of God if it wasn't for our laziness a lot of times our irresponsibility and so on but notice now how Paul ties the millet oriole work of the Lord Jesus still being as the Son of God and remember son of God is not another God not another being but it is the same God and a condon sended form that would be able to relate to man now let me bring it to you this way early one morning this week as the Lord woke me up and begin to deal with my heart and I was thinking about where we are you know let's ask Ovid and all of that and people lying mask to work and to church and to Walmart and this and that and the other and Carol and I had went to a store yesterday a couple of them actually and they had a sign on the door that no admittance without a mask and if you didn't have one they actually had somebody standing there that would give you one and when I read that I know it may seem peculiar to you but when I read that on the door the Spirit of God spoke to my heart and said that's the way I was without a mask I could not have had admittance into the realm of humanity so he masks himself now think of it he wore a mask so you and I would not be killed if he had not veiled or Mass himself it would have killed us so he put on a mask in order to protect us and also in order to protect himself because had he come to the earth I said eternal and that eternal realm my goodness if he would come in this building tonight and that room of the eternal there's not one of us that would be left alive after 10 seconds because our mortality our mistakes our humanity our shortcomings Allen said that God still deals with us and all of our human nonsense the mask the mass values him Oh hallelujah it values him but it's two-sided it protects you and it protects him praise be to God remember when Moses went up on the mountain and received the law of God and when Moses was in the presence of God it was a great display of splendor but when Moses come down from the presence of God and began to speak to the people the Bible says that he put a veil which John Gill says that word in the Hebrew is actually a mask so Moses put a mask over his face when he talked to the people and then when he talked to God he took the mask off so masking altogether altogether totally bad huh so when Moses would go back in the presence of God it move it won't even come by to relate more word he would put the mask on because the word glory there I mean the shown the words shown actually it's the same a group the hebrew word by the root word that come from the word horned hor any D this is why Michael engine or if you look at the great sculptor that Michelangelo has two tiny projections upon the head here of Moses and it looks like horns because the Hebrew word there was horned so they thought somehow that it was that horn which meant protection but when Moses was there the mass was standing between him or the veil between him and the people now saying the Lord God and all that he has done for us and yet all that he wants to give us and he's so limited but what he can reveal because he partnership himself was us and such simple steps that allows him to unveil all of his glory is a B and C now this is not algebra but it will lead to algebra you see to believe the Lord you've got to have here a B C's and it's something that you'll never lose as long as you have pertinent faith and he's word what's this again in Hebrews 4:14 sing man that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold let us hold look at the meaning of this word to have power be powerful to be chief the master of to rule get possession of to keep carefully and faithfully continue to hold to retain to hold and check wow what a powerful little small word to hold in check or restrain now this is what when you're supposed to do remember the Lord God will not do this for us so we have this great High Priest which is entered into heaven Jesus the Son of God a high priests which can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities conquered deaths hail the grave sickness disease ever demon and all that he wants to do for us is going to be correlated together and what we as his people will allow him to work in our lives and it's going to be based on a B C what's this Jesus the Son of God let us hold I keep this word in mine how power be powerful be cheap be master of so this is what he wants you to be the master of our profession which means confession subjectively only profess to be ours what one professes or confesses so you mean the greatness of God the miracles the healing the deliverance the many things that God wants to do for us it's not gonna be based on well our praising God didn't do it I cried on how long I begged and I begged and I begged God that don't misunderstand me he is not the high priest of you begging I don't mind telling your friends we are not beggars we are children and Satan tries his best especially in the time of dilemma and emergency to lower our standing before the presence of God and convince us somehow we will get more from God if we act like a bunch of beggars well I'm not worthy I'm no good on no account and where does the Bible say that about you somebody stand and tell me if there was ever a time that we need to hold our profession it's the hour we're living right now and the church said notice again Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of the miracles of God the power of God the wonder of God the resurrection of God the healing of God the Apostle and the high priest of our profession you mean the Lord Jesus is the Apostle and the high priest of what I say about Who I am ma consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus notice Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise I'm sure glad he didn't say we are because that would leave me out and I'll go ahead and say it for the rest of you y'all been left out too so Paul didn't say we were faithful but he said he was but notice this man above all the others in the New Testament would use this word and frame it's similar I said in the chapter four let us hold fast the profession of our faith wonder why wonder why it would be so important for us to hold it fast to be the master to control it to be steady apparently there's going to be a lot of things that's going to try to alter or subdue or change our profession praise the Lord now we know that he can only work according to the allocation of his word given to us and the dispensation that were in now as I said it's going to be based upon a B and C and God will be released when we follow a we follow B and we follow see y'all want me to say an Archie notices the Prophet said Jesus died to heal us every one of you is healed every one of you is healed right now Jesus has already healed you you have to confess it and believe it that's right by stripes you were passed since healed then when he did it at Calvary that's when he overcome all sickness and sin and all a calorie for you just like a table it's set there oh my only thing you have to do is go eat now here is a B C you've got to a accept it B believe it Loreena God in your heart and C confess it and he's the high priest of your confession so then when we say things that are not the word while I'm not sure if God wants to heal me I'm not very good I don't have very much faith to prophet seven you say that you're talking this devil's language he said even if I didn't have very much faith I wouldn't say it I wouldn't let the devil know it let your testimony said always be positive now you imagine them when we say those things the Lord Jesus cannot be the high priest to administer to us the things we need when our confession does not match his word so he says we're blessed and we say oh if it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all God loves everybody but me God don't bless me God don't care for me then the Lord Jesus has to remain silent on your petition because you're not saying what he's already said about you praise the Lord so you have to a accept it be believe it and your heart and confess it and here's the high priest of your confession now you mean that God would so coincide his very hearts desire to minister to his children all the great things that he purchased based upon them yes why would he do that because he wants us to share the kingdom not only in the Millennium he not only wants us to share the throne or whenever we get way under someone when they've all got new bodies and were changed but he wants to us to share now with him in the allocation of the power of God for the age that we live in you see the word itself it's more than now the logo says the written word demons have access to that written word they can quote it all the time but there is another aspect of the word and we know it is called Rhema two words that are used in the Greek New Testament for the English word word but yet we know they have two totally different meanings and Rhema actually means the word spoken with a living voice the Lobos word is that which we quote and we quote and we quote and we quote and we quote and we quote it many times and it does not happen because we're quoting the logos but if God if you're ever believe have been savor along you that it's happened to you that God will drop something in your heart and you knew it was gonna happen it didn't mean whatever's what nobody said that's a Rhema word and when that happens remember if God had not separated the word and took all the power and the anointing and separated from the letter of the word then Satan would have had total access to the complete power of God by quoting the logos so Satan can say it's written it's written it's written it's written he can quote that Bible bit and any preacher you ever heard in your life but he's never had access to the power the lays in the word because God connected power with word under the category of Rhema word and many times this is where our faith will be tried it's generally not tried so it's on the Rhema aspect as it is the logo says fit because the logos when we're going through trials and tests what is it my God dropped that Rhema there well you've never even got your I'd ever trial you ever faced you'd go right through it but God allows us to be tested on the logos aspect of the word because that's the part that many times we're tried by with no anointing no emotion OMA or don't feel like jumping over a wall you know leaping through great battles and all that sort of thing when the rainbow drops down on your heart if it's happy ever happen to you you know what I'm talking about whenever it drops Aaron your heart my you go looking for the devil you ain't waiting for the devil come looking for you you go looking for him because it release an element of the supernatural power of God in lasat divine promise for you a mantis all right now watch since so God wants us to be able to take an ounce about wonder the donít want he do it all that way by Rhema power because that's not his design in his plan his plan was to allow us children to break into both realms of that word but really the trying aspect it's not so much in the Rhema world in the Rhema world it is so live so powerful so real it's a revelation from God oh my let people leave left and right from the message of the hour if this word has been revealed to you I don't care what they say I don't care what they do I don't care whatever they bring up it won't make a bit of difference to you because you are a believer and this is more than doctrine this is more than just well I need a newspaper article all I need this to prove I don't need none of them come on sage say man why because it has been revealed to me this message to me is not a bunch of doctrines it is not a bunch of statements that we argue about this message has done something to me that Pentecost could never do for me and that is it help me to fall in love with the Lord Jesus more than I loved him in my life but yet in order for me to be able to tap into the presence of God and you to tap into the presence of God there's three aspects about which it will be released and that is the ABCs of the believer notice again I suppose of the Moses remember I want you to listen friends how powerful this is he can never do nothing nothing for you until first you say now think of it the Lord Jesus and all that he purchased and all the great things that have been bought for us and he cannot do anything anything for us until we first say it we need to spend more time saying the route things don't most of us run off our big fat blabbermouth of all kinds of foolish nonsense and no stupid stuff when we ought to be quoting the word well hallelujah you talk more about Jesus and say to your favorite football team or your favorite soccer team or basketball team or this and that and the other and talk about that word I guarantee we'd be a whole lot further up the road well priests mother Dottie notice remember he can never do nothing for you until first you say he's done it believe him and accept it and testify do you know that he's the high priest of what confession Hebrews 3:1 now a setting at the right hand of the Father to make intercession upon our confession that remember he's not interceding on the blood he's not interceding on his righteousness he's not interceding even on his own desire on his own will on his own program he's interceding on our confession and in a wonder that we get so many of our prayers that are not answered because we're not saying them right we're not praying them the right way we're not confessing I'm doing all brother Donny that's all this modern stuff know it ain't modern this this whole world out here at all this was said 1950 you imagine 1950 don't you to sell all these denominational people they broke into the expects this prophet of God brought decades ago many of them have brought it oh my you go on YouTube and you see all kinds of people making videos well they left the message and I find it so amazing there's all kinds of secular people I hear in preachers and so on that are doing many many more YouTube videos and putting it about the power that William Branham had knowing we are thinking well God let them test if I let him condemn these other people because they realize there was something man that man's life that no one else could touch legal this an allegation of God it was not brother around brother Ben was a sinner say but the grace of God like the rest of it but it's something that God gave him right notice this oh my under first you say that he said he believed him accepted in testify he's the high priest of our confession Hebrews 3:1 setting at the right hand of the Father to make intercession upon our confession we've got to believe it accept it and confess it and he's before the Father to make good anything not that he bought not that he wants you to have that any saying you confess in the redemptive blessings of course notice this in my commission every sinner is saved tonight and the side of Jehovah God but it will never do you any good until ABC accepted and believe it and confess it then he's the high priest of your confession to make it right before God now do you believe he wants you to be healed well I want them had bowed out to pray for almost all I need to do no that's not all you need to do the Bible tells us a vans right on us yes but you need to speak the word you need to say the word and hope this don't go over your head you may actually be anointed by God to speak to that disease in your body and tell it to leave you and it may come by it hearing you say what the prophet said what your pastor saying what evangelists are saying but it may not be the power of my words that'll drive that from your body but it may be the power of your own words now I'm not just talking out of sickness I'm tell Matt if you're bound by by setting sin or whatever it is it all basically comes the same exact same way notice this so accepted believe it in confession then he's the high priest of your confession to make it right before God so here the Lord Jesus is waiting on us to talk and us to say the right things and then he will make it right in heaven when you line up your mouth was what he wants you to have [Applause] right to anything that he died for he put it in the deposit box at Calvary and gave me a checkbook now boy I'm telling you what if some rich person I hear in the world come to all of us and gave us his checkbook and said my name here it is Bill Gates on the bottom of this cheque some of these other guys that are billionaires the guy that owns Amazon and all they're here you go take it buy whatever you want my goodness it would be one more side what you folks said by oh I just wonder where you'd even start oh you wouldn't stop at the candlelight place you'd go down to Knoxville and you'd buy you one of high-dollar Hawk of Luton cars my goodness Sears robot suits and that sort of thing no way why because the main man from Amazon give you a checkbook he don't signed his and I am down at the bottom of and said don't even worry about price well some of you all would want to live here in Johnson City no more because it wouldn't be a house big enough and refined enough and nice enough you'd want to move up to Washington DC or Baltimore somewhere or you could run with the big dogs why because somebody had done give you a check well let me tell you something you've been handed a check when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have been given a checkbook and the Lord Jesus name is on the bottom of it Oh hallelujah he's got more money than Amazon and Walmart and Target and Kroger and Big K and all the rest of put together he's got more wealth and more riches and more mercy and more grace and more power and more delivers and he turns that checkbook over to you and said child whatever you need and my name fill it out if you need healing write your check Oh Lord I don't want to bother I don't want to bother you I really need a complete work over well go ahead and feel like that no no no I don't want to trouble you so I'm just gonna ask for a symbol full and maybe next week I'm not going to a tea cup One World do that just go ahead and fill it out for the full amount all the what if it don't happen but what if it does oh you can talk yourself out of every blessing that God wants you to have with them little words well what if it don't happen well what if I may read the right time look I've looked through every one of these quotes of the Prophet uses these words checkbook and I never found a one of them whether he put the right time thing up to us you know what when God gives me the cheque I'm gonna ask for it if it ain't the right time except to the teller to delay it but he won't delay because oh my goodness were running short I've been in several stores in the last few weeks and you probably have as well as I have and you said they've got science up you're short on corn so if you have exact say I thought in the United States of America we're running short on coins so they don't have enough coin I guarantee one thing you will never let me make sure I emphasize that to you you will never have a check that will never be bounced on the name of Jesus Christ you will never have a check that will come back from the bank of heaven and say insufficient funds and we're going to charge you 50 bucks because you're overdrawn you don't have to worry about that because Jesus children don't never ever draw on their account for the most of us we are millionaires we are billionaires in the goodness of God but we live like paupers my piddle in the deposit box at Calvary and give me a checkbook and said write whatever you want and I'll take care of it just send it up to me Oh Maude that's wonderful there he is how do you get say what a second in a channel art form wherever believer no matter what church you belong to in your pastor if he's the right man he'll tell you that you can be saved only saved through faith but not through words through faith now you believe that you're safe now the first thing that comes from the heart you believe it then you walk up and confess and say I've said Jesus that's my personal Savior I believe disabled there's not a physical thing and the world that you can prove that you're saved so a person comes up gives our heart to God there is not a physical proof that they can give to me to you to their life to somebody else that they just got saved your eyes are the same color you got the same shout on this your head go outside the old gang says ain't nothing to that but you believe there's something to it don't you what if you said well I'm going to see how it works I will never work out until you keep your testimony going you believe you're saying all of this you act like you're saved you say you're saved and you associate with those that are saved now watch what is happening now your salvation is working its way out the work that God did inside of your heart it's working its way out it may take weeks it may take months who knows how long it'll be but eventually every one of these aspects will work out of your life because you believe you got say you token that you got say you're hanging around folks say God say well praise the Lord if you get sight I'll tell you one thing that'll crowd you used to run with not only will they feel uncomfortable with you you will feel uncomfortable with them and if they don't you ain't got saved yet well praise the Lord oh man notices and the same thing will take place by divine healing you believe you're healed you act like you're healed poor to God you Akashi healed you you say your heal and he's a high priest of your confession to make good anything that you confess that he's done before the Father so oh oh oh god I've got this and my body god this is going on Lord I claim your healing mother down pray for me listen I've felt so good and then on Thursday I got a worse I was so sick I don't know if I got it or not oh gosh your confession watch your confession keep that promise of the word right before you all but I got worse on Thursday that probably is a good sign that you got healed on Wednesday night but called well it didn't feel it on Thursday morning says he is not the high priests of your feeling he's not the high priest of your ops your downs your ins or outs he's the high priest of your profession by His stripes I'm healed I'm sicker than a dog but I'm healed anyway I don't feel like even getting up out of the bed but by stripes I'm healed why ABC notice this again God is under an obligation is worth to the believer that will accept this word any word is to see if you a accept it and your heart by face B believe it C confess it God will bring it to pass can you imagine a prophet of God saying God will bring your words to pass why don't we see more of it fear we're afraid well priests rather darling now this he can't do nothing for you till you confess it and he's the high priest of your confession in that case not even to your face oh I believe I believe I believe he's not the high priest of your faith he's the high priest according to the Bible of your confession not even your face even couldn't be face until you confess it all you've got to accept faith be believe it and see confess it that is already has done for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now when you believed you were saved sitting in your seat whatever you are accepted it begin to confess it and tell people you were saying well you kept on Sam I must say the people said there ain't no difference singing but you believed there was is that right and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked it worked righteousness it worked for the conference case you say it'll work deliverance of habits it'll work deliverance of healing of whatever you got going on it will work it out if you keep your heart and your face and your mouth together on the same page and relearn your ABCs except believe confess hallelujah and you kept with your confession actually worked righteous all your neighbors and everybody knows you're safe now but they didn't know it then as a matter of fact they probably thought oh yeah that's a jailhouse conversion and we've seen that before hemolysis three weeks he won't lie still we my goodness he'll boy they look I said praise God you talking about a good solid Christian yeah you're the someone that said ten years ago wouldn't last no time but what happened you kept saying what God done in your heart you can't believing what God did in your heart and you confess it and find it that confession becomes so manifest now you got other people that didn't believe in you said what you're saying about yourself years ago oh I love them and God makes the devil testify this greatness don't you if it will work that way in salvation cannot it work that way I'm high blood pressure cannot it went away in a grocery a tumor or tempura whatever the setting sin cannot have work the same way this is why Satan wants to alter our confession in God's Word because you believe do you confess it why what happened what changed you is the high priest of your confession setting at the right hand of the Father making good what you're confessing not making good what he's saying not making good what the pastor wants you to be not making good what the prophet said about you though you not did it that way you'll only get it when you and the word and the message becomes so one it's what you eat it's what you think it's what you talk about not just in the bad times notice they're sitting at the right hand of the father making good what you're confessing now it's the same thing is my healing you accept him as your healer listen fish you're talking about a a difficult thing renounce your feelings how in the world do I do that Here I am immortal I'm emotional aren't you what if you're human you are and I feel up and down and are crying Eliza and I am supposed to renounce any of my feelings that are contrary to my confession I don't believe that Abraham was a complete imbecile I do not believe that Abraham run around saying I've got a hundred years old this is mind over matter I'm 20 I'm 20 I'm going to say it I'm 20 Sarah said say it say it said I don't believe Abraham said I'm not all her male veins ain't caught up oh my god no I believe that he said you know what that's the way it is right now but that's not my confession my confession is God is going to bring a baby out of our bodies I don't know how he's gonna do it but that's entirely his business my business it's not to do the supernatural my business is to ABC open the Red Sea that ain't nothing to you don't worry about it you just do your part he'll take care of the rest of it notice this renounce your feelings it's not my feelings it's my faith sign your he'll believe your heel oh my goodness act like your heel so brother branham walking down the street in the city praise God always prayed for a child it's crippled and can't walk and the parents of that child is looking for shoes now people with intellectual reasoning thinking through their mind that said what if I can't return these shoes if the baby don't walk I think I'll wait till he walks barefoot and then in case you know I'm only here visiting and they don't have on these Woolworth store where I'm at that's what they had them days they don't have one of them where I'm at I'd lose all that money faith is reckless that's a quote oh is it I want my baby a pair of shoes I'm bringing about returning them cuz I won't be bringing them back I won't be bringing them back why because my baby it's gonna walk notices so you say you're healed you believe your heels and then what do you do brother Tony you don't mean to tell me you're wanting me to act you all act like you don't know what acting like means humans are the worst hypocrites that there is don't tell me you all don't know how to act if you run into somebody you don't want them to see you you look like you didn't see you I thought I'll send your spider oil butter on that don't tell me you don't know how to act come on Saints oh my what if we can act like that what's wrong please God well say let's make plans on next year going to here and there and that what do you say they just told you you ain't got three months to live that's what they're saying but I'm acting like I'm healed I'm acting like I'm ill god that's what the doctor said but this is what the prophet of God told me to do let's make plans on on having a picnic let's baby but but you you can't even get out of the bed that's what my feeling says that's what the doctor said but come here you gonna have got something one I like the right thing praise be to God associate was those who believe in healing well your associates has got a lot to do with this right here don't associate with those who believe in healing and God lord have mercy God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of Health will not fail but notice what all you've got to do in this you've got to act like you're healed you got associated around people that believe in healing you got acceptance you got to believe it you got to confess it look how much you've got to do this this is really what gets us because we don't want doing much we want God to do it all well praise the Lord notice again he said now he cannot heal you or I cannot save you or do one thing for you until first ABC you accept it and believe it and confess it that's right you got to confess it now you've got to feel it you've got to confess it he's not the high priest of your feelings so when you don't feel healed is the best time to give the Apostle and high priest of your confession something to welcome I don't feel nothing don't feel no chills I don't feel the pulsation of faith I don't feel that's always said I really don't need that what I need talk to me talk to me tell me who you are tell me what you need tell me why do you want to be healed tell me what you want what do you I want to hear yourself I want to hear you talk to me give me something to work home see Jesus is a high priest of our cabal you sure reading a bunch of quotes I am and I got a bunch more to read I'm gonna fry that devil's hot he's gonna get so sick of yearning tonight he's gonna go back down inhale and leave us alone Jesus is a high priest of our confession he can't do nothing friends are we hearing this he's saying it over and over again year after year you find this being said over and over and over again he can do nothing nothing why it's the way he had it planned you and him are buddies you need healeth I do God mean you steam you do your part I'll do mine but God held her work and I'll work with you or don't worry I'll never ask you to do my part but I will expect you to do your own but if we tend to be lazy we want him to do both and we sit back and drink a big old glass of southern sweet tea our hands all kick back behind our head wake me up Jesus when you get down wait without me you ready to heal me I want to say it's girls of this ball game you get that excited over a stupid football game and come to church a lot on a pickle there's something wrong with your religion I believe football is your religion or been small is your religion if Jesus don't get all to fall in love [Applause] sweet Jesus notice this he can't do nothing for you - first you accept it and confess it that it's already done and he will make your body your nature come in subject to his word do you understand now you must act just like it's already done so when the doctors told brother branham he was going to die he said if you eat another bite of solid food your dad so he claimed god's promise and acted like he was healed it didn't feel like he was here when he was farming Tinnell but actually a healthier person does fallen at your body's way of expelling things so what did he do when he get it all cleaned up and the mess cleaned up force feed himself again and kept saying nice chops I'm healed why he was acting like he was he'll you imagine he enjoyed that we do it one time and we're ready to try it I tried it you give it a trial one time and you're gonna give it up you ain't even worthy of heaven you're not worried that it's set in this church you are not fit to walk down streets of gold if you will not give Jesus Christ a million times more effort than you give Satan you're worthy to burn up and hail go on you're deserving if you won't give Jesus Christ all that he's done for us and we wouldn't give him a million times more effort than we give sin and debauchery and evil we're not worthy to take of the water of life all brother if you're my if you're in love with him you count the worst day you've ever had as a child of God and so billion times higher than the best that you ever had as a sinner oh thank you Jesus notice this he came do nothing for us do we already say that he's done it we have to confess it or profess it that he's done it then he can go to work on it and make the intercessions on what he goes to work on what you say not in what he wants not on what he purchased even on his own merit of purity I have a few more minutes notice this I now challenge the devil to a debate Satan you are aware that you are whipped that's a son of God that no worries standing you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my lord stripped you of every authority you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff you know what when our Lord come to the tree curse the tree the next day it was withering and our Lord said to his disciples have faith in God for if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart believe what you've said in the saying come to pass you can have what you said Satan you know the scripture on that and I just taught these people that God is in them and if God is in them glory to God they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease customer for Christ said so it's not them that speaks it's the father that dwells in them that speaking they're in need so come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ I say it's God's servant by message from an angel who anointed it has proved to the people that Jesus is here and the message is right so come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ I adjure you to leave ever sick person and get into outer darkness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now listen what happens in this building in Waterloo Iowa 18:58 brother branham pulses for five seconds listening to speaking banger if you go listen to this tape you'll hear it it's like a great mmm roar that comes in this building if you're looking listen to his meetings and Waterloo oh that's a hard time it was terrible he just kept pulling and pulling and pulling every night but what's this he said do you hear that I'm sure you heard that how many heard that great roar goes through the buildings just if that was it surely you won't doubt any longer that was God speaking back can't you see then he pauses again Roz do you believe you're healed you believe that God is your prayer raise up your hands thank you for it it's over you're healed Oh glory be to God notice latter part of this quote he says when you're out from Babylon you're out from under unbelief you're out from under superstition you're out from under all these things and you're filled with God's own life your voice is his voice or it's a god glory to God notice this this is super since this woman when she left the platform it was thus saith the Lord go home and eat Jesus Christ makes you well she went home that night a friend of hers living in the neighborhoods third of force behind her each time at the discernment line now she had a great big knot on her neck here she come all thrilled about her neighbor was going to be healed of that ulcer that it bothered her so much this is one of the hundreds of cases or thousands of them this big not sticking out on her neck she came up and half said no one would have to discern that but you're happy about something you've been thrilled because that woman sitting right over there is a neighbor of yours I know some of you Devils I want to challenge this message why don't you stand up here and do the same thing you oh my she thought how in the world could that man know that it has to be something to reveal it to him someone that was said it said notice not about himself it was said that something about your neck yes do you believe it leave I believe it she said with all my heart I said thus saith the Lord go home and you'll receive your heater the natural man looked around and couldn't see no sign the woman but they also went home and tried to eat like two died all the natural man the natural sense the feeling still declared the ulcer there so after about a week or two had passed she went through the neighborhood to all of her people in the church testifying the Lord has healed me as she did a she accepted she did be she believed now them two right there and a lot of times aren't near as embarrassing and humiliating see you see see sometimes can be so embarrassing because we're putting a plus B together and it produces C so when you learn your ABCs when you're learning how to spell as a child those of you that know enough about the advanced algebra you know that they also use a B and C and that so let's learn how to walk crawl then the wall then my Ron the natural wild will fly Luna so she accepted she believed she goes to the neighborhood confessing I'm he'll notices are you no not exactly ever saying I want now what's this a lot of you miss it right here because you think to say that statement you're talking negative you don't understand confession do you well praise God so they ask aren't you eating everything well well no not exactly that's not her confession she's speaking symptoms yes she's speaking worse she's act but that's not her confession either her confession is I have already been healed [Music] Gorda God no not exactly ever saying that one but she said I'm already healed for about his job some healed no matter what it was she was healed anyhow I'll order that God one morning the children had gone to school and she got real hungry she was standing washing the dishes by the window she came to the meeting another meeting about a year later she was washing the dishes and when she did first thing she felt a real funny feeling go over now we know according to another message after this the Prophet said the angel of the Lord was just moving through that neighborhood that day a good time to not be a t.j.maxx the names of Lord looking for you at the house anything praise be to God oh she thought what was that felt like not wanted to scream she said oh lord we've been there anyway house mother told her said honey quit oh he didn't tell her to quit except it he didn't tell her to quit believing but he told her to quit talking why the Tolkien produces embarrassment not only for the wife the father husband hope somebody share any of that how do you quit talking about that healing said because although he was a Christian you know bringing in a reproach upon the calls how can you bring a reproach when your testifying to his word brother Ben said you'll bring a reproach if you don't testify to it so if you were here you were here she said that man stood and looked me in the eye and told me my conditions and the things I'd done who I was where I come from she said I hadn't been in that building 15 minutes when he come to the platform I'm on the work of this man no I never saw him in my life and he told me until thanks I believed it until I'm dead she said I'll believe it anyhow so her and her sister below her friend had a covenant to God that they'd hold that faith that morning she felt real fun in a few minutes she got hungry the children had left some oats in a plate little dish and remember said this bleeding ulcer that would explode blood and she'd vomit blood and blood that just spew out of her mouth had to give her you know interested in her arms and stuff a few minutes she got hungry but generally left some oats in a plate in a little dish and said oats always just burner up you imagine God's gonna use the very thing that burner up to prove she's healed my goodness some of you all used to couldn't pass a honky-tonk your vehicle was on autopilot every time you'd go through a juke joint your steering wheel just something you couldn't pass up a cigarette you couldn't pass up a drink I don't care who it was it offered it to you you look for an excuse to have one brother you get tanked up now full of the Holy Ghost you can pass for every bar every juke joint if Satan's got a list for liquor all the way from here to in Annapolis and back you can drive all the way and be as thirsty as a hound dog in the middle of the desert and you wouldn't stop and take a drink of that at all why because the thirst for the thing is gone and left you its do something for you and the outs they used to kill your stomach and gobble said that's what I want you to prove your heel by hey damos what's this she reached down and took a couple of bites of those oats no mash she said I'll have to pay for it see there again some of you would have never said that what you don't understand confession you do not understand confession you saying being a human and feeling big salts of fear and doubt you feel like oh god that's no how does song well why did he become that thing so you imagine this comes out of her mouth but not her heart person said this was not her confession this was her fear talking all glory their God I'll pay for it I suppose but one of these days I'll be all right little did you know today was that day you see a person can be right on right on time right in face and still the miracle is only minutes away and we still don't know what brother Wayne and we can be saying things like this but this was not altering her profession her husband couldn't change it the church couldn't change it fear couldn't change it Phelan couldn't change it I'm gonna be healed but she noticed she was still hungry so she just Lord it got finished up the dish she waited a few minutes see what happened see what happened see what happened praise God nothing happened felt good still hungry she fried a couple eggs my sister I'd sure disagree with you on that fried a couple things poured on cup of coffee got some toast had her a real Jubilee God she eat all she could eat she went ahead washing the dishes about high fire later she was hungry again no ill-effects she put on her little bonnet down the street into this neighbor's house when she got there she thought that better - maybe in the family though under dance is infirmary who's the dance nobody the gardener has done they were screaming and shouting and walking around they show what message people who must have been Pentecostal they were screaming and shouting walking around the woman had slept late that morning got up looking for the gross episode her day it had disappeared in the night what was it God at work gonna read one more appeared Kate old Tabernacle we had the meeting a crippled boy came in there and was prayed for many he was there to see him they brought him back in that emergency room and Billy led me to him they had him on the platform three or four knots in the bill and it didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the emergency room i man in there and prayed for him and looked at me said mr. Brennan can you tell me some consolation huh said yes sir son polio got you in this way said that's right I said your name is such-and-such you come from a certain place that's right he said he said what about my heel and I said by stops you were healed he went home testifying giving God praise he brought such our approach they claimed in the neighborhood until one of Sunday a group of ministers come in and sat down by him and said you must stop doing that notice where Satan wants to stop you the most say they didn't tell him to stop accepting they didn't tell him to stop believing they told him quit talking about it the devil wants us to quit talking about this message I quit talking I'm talking more he wants us to quit streaming on the internet get him out there and get him off of youtube at all to ban we're going to keep on preaching this message till we're James stop talking about that property drives me crazy well good I'm gonna keep on talking to you don't nuts so it's going to get us out of here you're bringing a reproach on the calls and the young men sitting there said mister if you were sitting where I am and you were in the chair that I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to rob me of the last hope that I've gotten Christ said by His stripes he no more then said that setting their paralyzed feet hands body back no more than said that out of the chair he went who the you know what if they would have talked about it I'm sorry yeah yeah I'm so I apologize forgive me for bringing reproach no doubt brother Jim here too missed his healing his natural senses all he said that the doctor said he'll be there forever as long as he lives but the six Sam said by his stripes it's casting away everything contrary to what God said that's what the six centers this for what do you need from him to that oh you said only I believe all that but the problem is you ain't brother branham you just never figured that out you're right I'm not brother BAM but let me give you a simple something that the Lord Jesus dropped in my heart today I'm not brother Brennan and neither is brother branham Hebrews 13:8 the bible does not say william branham the same yesterday today and forever but jesus christ right i'm not william branham i'm not this man or that man or that man but he is still jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever Oh John Ryan not rya n but our hy in blind beggar in Fort Wayne was there that day was prayed for in the meeting that was the night the piano played the Great Physician now was near without anybody in it by rather he was blind Catholic by faith he stopped in the line I looked at message your name is so-and-so John Ryan yes you're a beggar on the corner you've been blind for years yes that right you're Catholic by faith that's right I said thus saith the Lord you receive your healing thank you sir I said thank the Lord he said but I can't see and I said that has nothing to do is it can't you imagine friends how strange and odd that brother brems he teaching on healing was to the majority the people you tell him man he's healed they said by the king states that that is nothing to it well I thought that's what he's being prayed for but that is nothing to do with it it shows how little we understood about divine him sometimes I wonder how much people still understand to be honest I can't say that is nothing to do with it your heal anyone along they helped him off the platform the natural man could see nothing they couldn't see no results from that at all why he was obliged to see everyone so two of his friends brought him back put him in the prayer line again running through again Howard let him pass sir brother Rams brother when he come back again he said mister you told me I will see you I said you tell me you believe me he said I do believe you I have no reason not to believe you but he said you told me all these things in my life and said I don't know what to do but said there was a woman back there testifying that she had a Gorder few minutes ago and it's gone away I said then if you believe me why are you questioning me I'm telling you the Word of God and he said what must I do sir knowing he was a Catholic I had to have something physical that he could hold on to i said just keep testified by straps I'm healed they'll man for the next two weeks a3 stood on the corner nice old papers he would holler extra extra praise the Lord I'm healed extra extra praise the Lord I'm healed extra extra praise the Lord I'm healed when he come back to the meeting the next night I couldn't hardly preach for him he had raised up in holler everybody keep quiet praise the Lord for healing me praise the Lord for he limit as a cow psyche to know how to take hold of faith but he knew if he kept on saying yeah the sixth sense would go to work he was standing on the corner holler praise the Lord for healing me extra praise the Lord for healing me it walked down the street so might come might say how are you John praise the Lord for healing me they laughed at him made fun of him another little news boy let him over to the barbershop for a shave about 2 or 3 weeks later from the meeting the barber put him in the chair lathered his face said John I understand some little smart aleck said I understand you was down there to see the divine healer then yes I went down that I understand that you got healed just to make fun of them the old man said yes praise the Lord and he's a scum as I said those of you that want to condemn him and call a false prophet our church is open anytime for you to come and do the same his eyes come open out of that barber chair he went with the tile around this Nick the barber trying to catch him with a razor in his head down the street they went why God's Word had work to work not just based on a not just based on me not just based based on a plus B but based on a plus B plus C you believe he's your healer your deliverer I believe with you hallelujah I got a much more Goodman so I want to read all can it be that simple brother Donnie my friends it is just that simple I go to text today from one of my dearest friends for the template sharing with me about his wife sister Karen had the brain bleed a few weeks ago as you know the doctors had told me my honours will get prepared for death and if she does live she'll be nothing but a vegetable but it sent me a little text today and said praise God Karen is sitting down in a little place sure they moved her into rehab don't let her go home Tuesday Lord woman Karen is sitting in little places down here from where I'm sitting with her sister and they're setting they're putting a 300 piece jigsaw puzzle together not bad for a woman who's supposed to be a vegetable that just a few days ago couldn't even turn on a cell phone that's my father that's our God hallelujah you believe it oh my whatever you need is tonight friend I'm sure many of you know our daughter Erica the doctors found a a grouse on her liver and they're going to do more tests and they think that this is not the origin of words come from that it's from somewhere else I appreciate all that doctors can do to help us but my faith my anchor is not in medical science oh sure if God wants to minister to her through medical science absolutely but I've seen medical science fails so many times I ain't ever seen God fail wants once her whole life she's been a miracle I said she could never live said she never lived normal never have children three of those never have or standing tonight the seven she got pregnant with her babies should probably have to go on dialysis because your kidney function would go down so low God said watch me work so instead of it going down God sent it up they told Rachel she burst in babies don't never get pregnant again she got pregnant again another set of twins I said your kidney function I'll go down this time God said but don't you remember what I'd done last time God sent her function up I remember today like it was yesterday what they stuck that big needle in her body and they couldn't sedate her she was screaming and hollering and I took off runnin down the hospital I reminded him of that today I've seen him do so much and I believe this is no greater I'm sure that you and your needs and your requests tonight it may be just as traumatic it would be a sin for us to disbelieve after what we've seen him - hallelujah we're gonna pray I want you to hold your request your need we know there are several people in our church that have real real desperate needs if the Lord puts one of them people on your heart be sure and hold it now maybe you're doing pretty good right now but we've got several people that really need a move of God we're gonna greet together the Lord's gonna move for them we've got one miracle after another the standing here tonight that's been healed delivered set free you see people who are miracles have no problem believing in miracles that's why I'm convinced that people this day don't believe in miracles because they've never become one themselves but if you ever become a miracle by the new birth miracles is just something that's what you are just pray together ken my Heavenly Father thank you for your word tonight lord I know it's been simple a-b-c the Lord God it'll back up the powers of Hale for some plumb

difficult issues or were just agreeing together as a body that she'll move for our brothers and sisters Lord when one of our brothers and sisters hurt we hurt with some God when they have a bad diagnosis we would cry with some but then when we get done crying we wipe our tears and we believe with them because that's who we are we are believers we bring them to you to net Lord dear Jesus I

to shut him up Jesus just wanted to try one last time to see one we stand under pressure clergy that must have really pleased you Lord because even when pressure clergy didn't make him change that was the final test you healed him and shot him out of that chair like a bullet praise God must have been that barber must have really struck old John Ryan that was the last test that was needed praise God I imagine it was a funny looking side him running down the street with lather on his face praise God screaming to the top of his voice with his eyes wide open and the barber running behind him because Jesus had made manifest is worth Lord I hope the people can see it at night what happened for John Ryan for that crippled boy for them sisters you made good on their confession and ever Oh glory to God you made good on their confession in heaven and you chose the appropriate time and the appropriate place you can let John Ryan over his eyes be open at the house and oh you can let him know some nice fly place but you chose a barbershop what a place to be here praise God Thank You Lord we believe it emerges hallelujah may you anoint the faith of your people around the world Lord God not only

hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus oh brother Donnie I believe it but don't feel that nothing happen always keep this in mind you speak to this mountain that it must be removed but this is the way God will have to have it to happen sometimes there might be a couple of grains of sand that fall on the opposite side of where your eyes can see that mountain be maybe billions of tons you never heard it you never saw it you never felt it but on the other side of the mountain some little tiny grains of sand fell off your faith made it move a man let your faith remain and the mountain will be moved out of your way unless you let the devil talk you out of it what if God desires to move the backside of the mountain first and he wants you to be faithful by the fronts out of the mountain seems solid and stable but keep believing I can't explain it I don't understand it but I believe God's Word but John Ryan by stop some heal not the crippled boy by strap some heal but the woman with a stomach trouble
