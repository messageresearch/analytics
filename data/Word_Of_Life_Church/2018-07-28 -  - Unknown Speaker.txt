TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you imagine how discouraging that would have been for Jesus these preachers is gonna take the message and go along with it and they're fussing and fighting over who gets to set him a ride in and who gets a set at my left hand he allowed himself as a human to feel that to succumb to that this is the sonship this is the sonship a mares to feel discouraged and they why should I even do it I guarantee you there in the musician on this platform a singer in this church a song later a preacher than they have ever been so despondent deacons Sunday school leaders librarian whoever they are they just saw are you doing it no more I go in or not clean the church and I pick up the church and people do this and another I'm quitting the guys on the sound booth how many times did you tell them you appreciate them when the service goes well but how many times they you crank that head of yours around that one something goes wrong they don't reach sign language I can tell you that right now you'll come in here and set ten or fifteen services whatever it is and everything will go smooth and you never walk by to say thank you I appreciate you sacrificing to set back here make it comfortable for us what do you say friends it's our tendency to complain and not be grateful and Satan uses them complaints on everybody and their brother to bring them even farther down and their discouragement so what do y'all figure so we just talk lit well I say when I when reacting you for me but I just thought I'd throw myself on the same pot if every one of you said you was I have to say I'm sorry I love you but I'm going on and they feels that way I'm going on did get discourage fella done I did you get despondent I do but I'm going on anyway I'm going on and a matter of fact I'm happy going that way I said I'm happy going that way hey hey man I want as much happiness as I can be able to stand that's exactly right I want to be a happy child of God not just when I get to heaven but on my journey [Music]
