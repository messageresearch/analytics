[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] All right. [Music] [Music] How are you? [Music] Oh, hey. [Music] Do [Music] you ei [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Papa. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] God bless you. Appreciate each of you taking the time this evening to come out and uh pay our respects to brother Steve Newsome and to his family. And we trust that uh your presence of being here will bring comfort to their hearts. Let's just bow our heads. Father, we are gathered here this evening to honor a great man of faith, our brother Steve Nuome, to offer words of encouragement and condolences to his family. We ask God that you comfort the family as only you can do now and in the days ahead. We ask your blessings upon this service and may all that's done be for your glory. May your presence be felt among us. And may the peace of knowing you have everything in your control bring strength to the family in the days that are to come be my prayer. Fill the void that's left in our hearts from the pastor, brother Steve, with your love, mercy, and your grace. And may we cherish the mereness we have until we meet him again in Jesus name. Steven Allan Newsome, 51, Hampton, Tennessee, went home to be with the Lord Monday, August the 18th, 2025 in the Sycamore Shows Hospital with his family by his side. He was a native of Gallup, Ohio, and was a son of Wanita Adams and Dennis Newsome. Steve was a faithful member of the Word of Life Church in Johnson City. Brother Steve was a dedicated Christian husband and father who loved God in his family above all else. He was a kind man who had a heart for others and a special ministry that touched lives of many that he came across in his life's journey. He had a great appreciation for nature and love playing his many guitars and truck driving. Brother Steve was preceded in death by a brother Randy Nuome, his adopted parents Bennett and Judy Fout Newsome. In addition to his parents, survivors include his loving wife Jennifer Elkins Newsome, four children Derek Alan Mills and his wife Adessa, Caleb Joshua Nuome, Rachel Elizabeth Nuome, and Brianda Michelle Nuome. his siblings, Chuck, Deborah, Carla, Rick, Stacy, Brooke, Brian, Chrissy, Samantha, Brandy, Rhonda, Sarah, and Judy, and also several nieces and nephews, a loving church family, and many special friends. It's written in God's word, I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. 2 Timothy 4:7 and 8. In the book of the Song of Solomon, it talks about the tower that David built for an army where on there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. No doubt this was built to honor men who had done great things in David's army where others could go to this tower and see these shields and it would inspire them to do great things like a museum to honor great men. And I believe if brother Steve had lived in David's day, no doubt his buckler and his shield would have been hanging in his tower. For brother Steve was a great warrior of faith, never wavering, never backing down, never giving room for defeat. When I last saw brother Steve in the hospital, he was telling me that God has it all in control and he had placed his life in his hands. His faith was resting on that. His life was a testament of the power of a believer who trusted in their God. Even when faced with uncurable odds, his faith grew stronger and his commitment to God never wavered. He was and is an inspiration to us all. And I say tonight, Brother Steve, go rest I till we meet again. May God's blessings rest upon each of you. Be my prayer. God bless you family. I've been asked to sing this. this place that I'm going to sing about. I can only imagine right now, Brother Steve, and what he's doing and how he is and how the other saints that are there are. And funerals we think are supposed to be sad, but when they're homegoing celebrations, there should be a little pep in our step, a little excitement in our voice somewhere. That's what I want to sing about. May it be a blessing. Won't it be a time? Oh, won't it be a time? [Music] Oh, won't it be a time talking with the angels? Won't it be a time? Oh, won't it be a time? Oh, won't it be a time? Oh, won't it be a time talking with the angels? Won't it be a time? See, when he gets there, begin to walk across those streets of gold. He won't look frail like he does now. He won't look sick. He won't look like he he he he needs another day. He's got eternity to praise and worship the Lord. He will look at his hands and his hands, they are new. When he looked at his feet, you know they did too. He looked all around him and all around him shine. He said, "I'm going to have a time and time." Oh, would it be a time? Oh, would it be a time talking with the angels? Would it be a time? Oh, I looked at my hands and you know they look new. I looked at my feet and they did too. I looked all around my new home and my new home did shine. I said, "I'm going to have a time. Might as well while we're there." Oh, won't it be a time? Oh, won't it be a time talking with the angels? Would it be a time? Y'all saints, help me sing. Oh, would it be a time? Yeah. Amen. Time. Oh, won't it be a time? Oh, won't it be a time talking with the angels? Won't it be a time, brother Steve? I'll be there soon. And then we're going to have a time. Oh, I'll help you have a good time. Oh, we're going to have a time talking with the angels. Won't it be a time? One more time. Oh, won't it be a mighty mighty mighty mighty mighty good time? Would it be a time? Oh, would it be a time talking with the angels? Would it be a time? [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. [Music] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My name is Paul Phillips. I'm a truck driver. &gt;&gt; Close friend Steve Newsome. We spent many hours on the phone together talking. You know, I'd give him a call and I could still hear his voice saying, "Hello." And I'd say, "Hey, brother Steve, how you doing?" Then he'd say, "Gotcha. Leave a message after the tone." I can tell some of you have got that message before. He had a sense of humor. Sister Jennifer, Derek, Cadessa, Caleb, Rachel, Briana. Your dad's life as a truck driver. He wasn't just a truck driver. Truck driving isn't an easy one. You have many miles that you drive, many times away from the family, time you want to spend, having to stay up trying to stay awake. Thankfully, he helped me do that many times. We talked for hours. You know, you fight fatigue and other drivers, difficulty with shippers and receivers and different things and all carrying all that in the public eye. Everybody's seeing what you're doing out there while you're working. Steve wasn't just any old truck driver. He was extremely compassionate. He was the kind of man that would always look after others. He saw another driver in need, he wouldn't hesitate to stop and help them. Or another person, didn't have to be a driver, a car on the side of the road. I remember when several times I'd call him up and yeah I'd get gotcha and then a little bit later I'd get a call and he said sorry I didn't get your call I was on the side of the road helping somebody that needed a hand and end up leading them to Christ praying with them talking to them that was Steve he never hesitated to take an opportunity It wasn't his opportunity. It was God's opportunity that he took to help somebody not only on this side, but to make it over there. Every one of you that known him knows that's the truth. He wasn't a preachy kind of individual, but he knew just what you needed at every time, the scripture and different things. He lived his life out boldly every day. His face wasn't something that he kept quiet. He let everybody hear it that would hear. You know, if you were in distress and had a difficult day and were struggling and maybe somebody had rubbed you the wrong way, he'd always have a scripture, a prayer, something there for you that would lift you up. I remember one day that I was having some difficulty and he gave me this scripture, Isaiah 54:17. He says, "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and the righteousness is of me, saith the Lord." That was Steve. Always ready to remind you of God's promises, always pointing back to the faith, no matter what you were going through. And when Steve would call, your conversations always turned to something that he was studying on that God was working with. And he didn't just read the Bible, he dug deep into it. Not just the rema but he listened to the logos the God himself talking one of the most powerful things he ever shared with me in studies we spent months and hours and hours Bible on our passenger seat while we're driving down the road flipping through it going through message of the hour brother Brandham's messages and different ones different things but was on the Gethsemane experience He said, "Everyone has to come to your Gethsemane experience." And I know, sister, I'm sure he's talked this to you many of times. And if he was standing here, he'd encourage every one of you to study these things that he brought out. And I'm going to just highlight a couple little things here. I'm not going to go anywhere on it, but he brought out about in Gethsemane. It was at the foot of Mount Olives. And on the other side was the Kiddran Valley. And then just beyond that was Goltha. And how that when Jesus came in on Palm Sunday, he came in through Mount Olives. He had to go to Gethsemane on his way to Goltham, but he had to cross that Kiddran Valley. And if you'll study each of those things, you'll find out Kiddran Valley stands for cleansing and judgment and many of other things in the Bible on Gatha and then he went back to Mount Olives and that's where he ascended. He said every single person has to come to your own Gethsemane sometime in your life. Steve encouraged everyone he knew to see their hardships and everything through the lens of the Bible and and lift you up and lift other people up. Steve Love talked about God. If you called him, you'd find out real quickly he wasn't one to talk about sports, talk about other things, but buddy, if you started talking about the Bible, you had two or three hours there and you'd talk. He lived and breathed his faith, loved sharing it with everyone he listened to. Steve leg Steve's legacy is not only the miles he drove, but in the countless lives he touched along the way. He showed us what it looks like to serve others, to live with compassion, and keep God at the center of everything. And the though the road feels much emptier out there without him, his example and prayers will continue to guide each and every one of us. I'm going to miss those phone calls. Caleb, I need you to be my buddy then. Need you to call me. I need somebody. If you could do that and fill that spot, I'd appreciate it. I'm going to miss miss Steve and miss those calls. Appreciate y'all. God bless you. [Music] I know your life on earth was trouble. Only you could know the pain. You weren't afraid [Music] to face the devil. You were no stranger to the rain. to go rest high on that mountain. Son, your work on earth is done. Go to heaven is shouting love for the father [Music] and the son. Oh how we cried the day you left us. We gathered around your grave decree. Wish I could see the angels faces [Music] when they hear your sweet voice. [Music] Go rest high on that mountain. [Music] Son, your work on earth is done. Go to heaven shouting. Love for the father and the son. Go to heaven is shouting love for the father and the son. [Music] [Music] What will it be like when my Pain is gone and all the wories of this world just fade away. What will it be like when you call my name? And there that moment when I see you face to face. I'm waiting my whole life to hear you say, [Music] "Well done. Well done, my good and faithful one. Welcome to the place where you belong. Well done. Well done, my beloved child. You have run the race and now you're home. Welcome to the place where you belong. [Music] What will it be like when tears are washed away and every broken thing will finally be made whole? What will it be like when I come into your glory? Standing in the presence of a love so beautiful. I'm waiting my whole life for that day. I will live my life to hear you say, "Well done. Well done, my good and faithful one. Welcome to the place where you belong." [Music] Well done. Well done, [Music] my beloved child. You have run the race and now you're home. Welcome to the place where you belong. [Music] What will it be like when I hear that sound? [Music] All of heaven's angels crying out, singing, "Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. [Music] singing holy you're holy [Applause] holy are you Lord singing holy holy holy you Lord, waiting my whole life for that day. Until then, I'll live to hear you say, "Well done. Well done, my good and faithful one. Welcome to the place where you belong. Well done. Well done, my beloved child. You have run the race and now you're home. &gt;&gt; Welcome to the place where you belong. Well done. [Music] certainly wish to extend our deepest condolences to family and friends of our departed brother. with a man like this. Um, we could be here till midnight talking about what a great guy he was, a life that he lived, people that he affected and influenced. I really, as far as a preacher, you don't dread services like this. As far as for the man himself, of course, for the hurt, for the family, you do. Um he's the type of individual that gives uh preachers and the friends who knew him very adequate information to be able to talk about him. Believe me, I've preached lots of funerals and some people only give you a little bit. And that's so sad to live decades of your life. And then the people that's standing here, whether they're a preacher or whoever they are, they're stuttering and stammering and trying to find something to say. I hope that my life, if I go by the way of the grave, whoever takes my service, I hope they have encyclopedias and encyclopedias and encyclopedias. Don't you? Would you rather it be that way or a post-it note about like that? You said this is the type of man that we're talking about this evening. I want to read to you from Hebrews chap 11 verse 32 just to speak to you for a little bit. And no, I'm not going to midnight. I'll give you my word on that. But I just want to speak to you for just just a little bit on another hero of faith goes home. Another hero of faith goes home. Hebrews 11:32. What shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of Jeepa, of David also, and Samuel and of the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quench the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword. Out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight. The armies of the aliens, women received their dead raised to life again, and others were tortured. So now here we change, but we're still talking about Hebrews. You see, most Christians would much rather fulfill these first four verses that I read to where they would come right up to death's door or possibly even die and God would raise them from the dead. Or you say, "God, don't do that." Oh, but he does. Actually, we saw it right here in our church right back there some months ago. God does that. What a great testimony it is. It's an awesome thing whenever he does it. But you see, these verses are just as essential and necessary. Now, some of the women, of course, referred to in the New Testament, they received their dead raised back to life again. Some of them stopped the mouths of lions. But was that all of them? No. As a matter of fact, some of them were eaten by lions. Now you see for the mind that tries to understand God just from the concept of the psyche the mind the mental attitude they look at and think it's unfair God should never do this God should never do that and why would people pray and believe and God will not answer it that way but you see God is the only one who knows how to take certain lives and make them fit in these portions of scripture. Now notice how Paul changes when he said women receive their dead raised to life again and others you see brother Steve happened to be one of the others. It's not everybody that God can allow to be tested the way this man was that never serve him. If God let them go through tremendous trials, they'd turn their back on him and go the other way. If a great story can be written about their life and they had cancer and God healed them, oh yes, yes, let that be my life. Let that be my story. But God also has to have heroes like this. Notice Paul says that otherwise others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others. Isn't it amazing that for some of these people, he mentions them by name, but categorically he puts these that were so tested and so tried under a subheading and simply calls them others. And I can assure you there are more others than there are Gideonss. There are more others than there were Jeepa. Are they not heroes? Are they not people of great faith? Even when God would say no. I know for brother Steve and sister Jennifer, I was there with him whenever he was first put in the hospital and they were doing scans and diagnosis and this and that and the other. And I went to the hospital there with them. And both of them so strong in faith, trusting and believing God. And I was with them at the same hospital, just in a different room the very day that brother Steve passed. Now all this time, all this suffering, all the difficulty that they had faced, and you know what? instead of being weaker and instead of being subdued and I don't understand I don't understand why would God do this why would God do that instead of being that way they were stronger in faith than they were when they made the initial visit to the hospital &gt;&gt; and still waiting for answers. That's why I can stand here tonight and tell you another hero &gt;&gt; has made it home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you see, everybody couldn't walk where brother Steve walked. I I trust that if God would allow me to have to go that way, that my faith would be as strong and as persistent, not only mine, but also my wife and my children. For the caregivers that watch their loved one and they see their emaciated body, they see them losing their strength losing so much. And and Brother Steve was a man's man. &gt;&gt; He was a man's man. And I know it it broke his heart. It killed him to have to receive help. People in our church help them. And different people help them. And I know him well enough to know he didn't want to receive that at all. It was humiliating. It was embarrassing for people to have to take care of him. But the way he looked at it, if God somehow would get some glory out of it, if God needed somebody a witness, I was thinking about it today that we all Bible readers who love to share great stories about King David and talk about David killing the lion and the bear and the Philistine. But do you know how many lions David killed? Yes, sir. You know how many bears he killed? Know how many giants he killed? &gt;&gt; But that made his legacy. I've killed one line and two bears, but I didn't do it with a slingshot. So, does that make me a hero? It doesn't. It doesn't. No. Because I did not have a piece of leather with a couple of strings on the side of it and the rock in the middle and fling that thing around so fast and let it knock him out. No. And the bear's eyes up in a tree stand about 25 ft high, way out of reach. That's the way a lot of Christians want to be. They want to go to heaven. They don't want to be lost. They don't want to go to hell. But God, treat me like a pansy. Treat me like a baby. I'm I'm I'm God. I can't be handled rough now and remember me. I'm I'm a wee little tiny bitty baby. So don't try me. That's not the kind of man this one here was. He was a real hero. Listen. Paul said others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings. Yay. Moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were sown aunderder. Almighty God would let some of his children go through that. Yeah, we know one of them by name. Isaiah the prophet put him in a hollow log and the heathen sought him in two while he's screaming for mercy. But you see, the carnal mind tries to process all that and say, "I don't understand. I don't understand. A mighty God somehow that would bring him glory." Oh, yes it does. Because he can take the life of that individual and point right to Satan and say, "Look here. I've got a son that'll trust me with his whole life." Anybody can serve God when God says yes to every prayer you pray. I want this. There you go. I want that. There you go. There you go. How's that? Is that soon enough? How you like this? You want it wrapped up in a purple package with pink polka dots. How do you want a child? How do you want it? But God wants some children that they pray and he says, "No, it's not my will. I've got another program for your life. And when God even says no, they say, "You know what, Lord? I trust you so much. And I know your ways are perfect. I don't understand them." And he doesn't ask us to. He asked us to trust him. But can you imagine what it's going to be like one day? our brother. Our brother as I sat in the hospital about two weeks ago and he or I were talking about this scripture here in Hebrews, the spirit of God come down where we was and where we were sitting there talking together and the Lord give me this thought for our brother's funeral. So I knew it wouldn't be long and I went home and told Carol I said the Lord give me his funeral message. She said, "Oh, no." I said, "Yep, he sure did." But as I sat there and looked at him, I realized he was the same caliber of man as these here. They were stoned. They were sown aunderder, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute, afflicted, tormented. Well, that don't sound like a modern Christian, does it? If they ain't got new cars and new clothes and the best house in the neighborhood and the highest end of the culde-sac, they ain't serving God. But listen to what God's heroes are. Remember David as great a man as he was. But if you're very familiar with the Psalms of David, you'll find out every day in the life of a believer is not a giant killing day. As a matter of fact, there's many more non miraculous days than there are miraculous ones. You may get one line killing day out of four or five years, 10 maybe. one bear killing day, one Goliath killing day out of 85 or 90 years of your life. And the rest of it is spent sometimes in loneliness and sadness seeking God while you're persecuted, hated, run down. That was also the psalmist David. But notice how Paul goes on to describe them. of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. God's heroes. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise. Wow. So they believed and trusted and believed and yet God didn't give them what they was expecting for it to happen. You see that's a category of heroes that the modernday church knows very little about. But I pray that God will help some of you tonight under the sound of my voice to have such a desire to serve the Lord Jesus if he needs another man, a woman, a boy, a girl. And God was stoop, can I trust you? Can I trust you when you ask me and I say no? Will you still love me? God having provided some better thing for us that they with us without us are not made perfect. The word hero means this. A hero is a person or character who performs great deeds or selfless acts in the face of danger or adversity. We know that our military and there's people in our church that have received different military awards, the bronze star, the silver star, different things that they can get them and it's a great honor. Many of them give the ultimate sacrifice and they're not there to receive that honor. So, it's a crying mother leaning on a father and someone will receive that honor for them. But let me just give you a briefing before I stop. As our brother laid there in the hospital and his time came, his respiration getting low, his blood pressure already in his body. It hadn't eaten for many days, drank. His body no longer needed food and water. When I was there with him, I kept watching him and watching his eyes because I've been with many Christians when they died. And I watch their eyes to see what they're looking for. And they go to looking around the room because they're looking for people. You see, the Bible says about Abraham that Abraham was gathered with his people. That's what happened to brother Steve. &gt;&gt; He was gathered with his people. Now, the question is, who is his people? Now, those of you that are kin to him by flesh, you'll not be gathered in heaven just because they were you were kin to him by blood, but you have to be kin to him by the same new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. that he had. &gt;&gt; So I watched his eyes and I would as I stood at the foot of his bed and rubbed his feet and then I would go sit on the by the chair in the chair and and rub his arm and talk to him and I'd watch his eyes as he'd roll around and look cuz he was looking for things. You see, when a believer gets ready to cross, they're getting in line to receive their award. &gt;&gt; It's not a bronze star. It's not a silver one. But the scripture that was posted there with our brother's picture was I've fought a good fight. I've kept the faith. Which of course comes from Paul's writings in Timothy. Paul is describing it and he said the time of my departure is at hand. He was describing a ship which he had boarded many times to be able to go on a missionary trip. the time of my departure. So he would walk up and he would be able to see as the ship was tied by ropes along the moorings, big tall posts that were anchored down in the muck of the sea there. And they would have it tied and they'd have a plank across through there. So they're boarding all the lading and all the different things that they would have. And Paul would get up many times and show them his ticket. And he said, "That's all death is. That's all it is. I'm getting ready to step up on the ship of Zion, and before I can even realize what's happened, it will transport me to the other side." That's all death is. So he could say, "Grave, where are you going to make me fear? Death, where is your victory? Oh grave, where can you be able to make me tremble and shake? But he looked at it and said, "You are not my master, but I'm yours. All you are is a vehicle to transport me." You imagine a man being a Roman citizen. He knows there's one death penalty for a Roman citizen. They're going to lay his head down in a piece of wood which has been shaped out like this. And a strong man with a double-edged axe is going to remove his head in a matter of seconds. Imagine him laying it down and looking up at that old boy, and say, "Go ahead. I'm ready." Maybe couldn't hear Sister Jennifer no more, his children, but he was getting ready as he walked up into the ship of Zion. breath left his body. But the man that we've heard described today and the man that touched your life, was it just this man here? Was it just this body that you see is withered and emaciated finding this cancer? Was that the end? That wasn't the real man anyway. &gt;&gt; All that was was an old coat. So what happened to the real man? He changed coats. He changed coats. So the real Steve whenever he went out of this coat. So it'd be like this. Me slipping it off. The coat is laying in the bed. Sister Jennifer, the children, the close friends gather around him, no breath. In a few minutes, his fingernails start turning. The blue starts working up his arms and they think, "Oh no. Oh no." But if they could have seen him, he'd have been looking back down and say, "Don't cry for me. I have put on a new coat. Why? He made reservations years and years ago to change coats. You imagine that quick the ship of Zion took him across and he stepped out into the blue grass and started raking his hands through the grass as the gentle breeze is blowing across. Here come maybe brother Daniel Nunley. Here come brother Calvin Ward. Here come this brother, grandfather, an aunt, an uncle, whoever was. And they were screaming, "Our precious brother. Our precious brother." &gt;&gt; And he looked down at himself and his hands look new. &gt;&gt; He looked down at his feet &gt;&gt; and they were new, too. And he could reach up to his face and his face was not all sunk in. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He could look at his hands. They were brand new. And here they come running and screaming. What was it? It was the military parade. Don't you see? He was receiving part of his military honors. &gt;&gt; What was it? A star? No, it wasn't a star or a badge. It was a new body. Didn't Jesus said, "Let not your heart be troubled." &gt;&gt; You believe in God, believe also in me. For in my father's house are many mansions or tabernacles. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go away to prepare a place for you. And if I go away, I'll come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. I guess my question to you is, have you made reservations to change coats? Well, he's been there just a few days in the way that we count time, but it's not even been seconds if they could count time. And he's waiting, waiting. They're not going anywhere. Nobody there has a watch. Nobody there has a doctor's appointment, dentist appointment, car appointment. No more appointments. And they're waiting for the resurrection. rest, my brother. &gt;&gt; Thank God for a life like this that's lived among us. And even though God chose not to bring healing and manifested in my brother's body, God had another plan. Let me close. But God also is mindful tonight of your broken hearts. I know that feeling too. But I also can testify that Jesus can come and comfort the hearts. Can we bow our heads together? Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth, we're grateful, Lord Jesus, for the life of our precious brother. Oh God, I thank you for giving me the honor to be able to pastor him. Known him and his family now for decades, Lord. And I used to travel around and go up in Ohio and different places and they'd come and visit the services before they moved here. And then you put it on his heart to come down this way. And we're so grateful. Our church has been blessed. Father, &gt;&gt; thank you for a life that's lived among us. You don't just want preachers that'll be faithful, but you want men, women, boys, and girls. Another one of your heroes has come home. Dear God, we pray for his wife, his children. Lord God, his mother, his sisters, and in-laws, and Lord, for the church family. As a church family, we are one weaker now. But we're looking for the day, Father, when we'll all be gathered together. Comfort them, Lord Jesus, as only you can do. We know as the days go by, they'll go through different cycles of of loss. And there may be days they'll cry. And other days they may even surprisingly feel a little bit of anger, maybe a little bit of questions. And that's all part of the healing process. But we know a life like this in reality, they'll never get over him. But we pray that you'll give them strength to be able to deal with that loss. Would you Lord Jesus? We give you praise, Father. Amen. You know, Steve and I were real good friends. First time I met him, we just he been listening to my music and he was a very special guy. One thing we had in common was the guitar. He would tell me how he loved to hear me play and I had no idea who I was talking to because I first time I heard him man I wanted to hide somewhere but there contact with people and you they cross your path and first time you meet him there's something special about him and that was Steve. He traveled with me some and learned to love him and love his spirit. How he how he knew God. So Jennifer asked me to sing this song. I was on the front porch of my house and it was late September and uh the wind was cool and I looked up in the oak tree and had turned the leaves had turned red and gold is starting to turn. I just across the street and a flower had bowed its head to the wind and I said, "You know, in a few days those leaves all fall, the ground will be covered with them. They'll be turned brown. That flower across the street and my neighbor's yard will die." That's when inspiration spoke to me. He said, "Yes, but there will be another spring." [Music] In the spring of my life, everything was blooming pure and quiet. I run play through fields of green listening to the robin sing. Then came the summer of my life. Lazy days, starry nights. I thought those days would never end. I felt that cold September wind. Now I've reached autumn. Nights are getting cold. Trees are turning red gold. It's hard for me to realize [Music] that I'm getting old. Seemed like only yesterday my hair wasn't great. I'm not going to worry about these things. [Music] There's going to be another spring. [Music] Oh, there'll be another spring. [Music] I'll be young again cuz I believe the truth. I'll have eternal you. [Music] Oh, there'll be another spring. I'll run again. I'll laugh and sing. In a place where time won't mean a thing, [Music] there will be another spring. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] This concludes the service for our brother. Thank you so much for coming and respects brother Steve and his family. You can be dismissed. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. N. [Music]
