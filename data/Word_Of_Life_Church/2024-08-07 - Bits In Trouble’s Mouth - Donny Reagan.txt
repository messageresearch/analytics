brother Micah Brown way up top way up top brother uh Seth King and sister Caroline hit please come forward let's give them a round of applause and where's brother Jonathan if you would come over here and pray for them as well please please if you come up so just to say one thing I've seen all of you grow up it's really special for our hearts I speak for brother Joe and myself uh it's a major Milestone and it's a major milestone in life I remember and probably most of you remember when you graduated hit that next step and it's something we encourage you and forgive us as church leaders it's almost like parents for the mistakes that we made along the way but you will never find as the world maybe touches you and pushes you around a little bit that you have an anchor point in today and that the body of of God loves you through us and we will always no matter where life takes you and what happens know that you have a foundation that you can come back to and that we love you unconditionally it doesn't matter what happens to you out there whatever it might be one of the biggest things that I've seen is their kids that they get they get sideways but when they come back what Joy there is in my heart knowing that child and I believe that's how God loves us through the body so we thank God for you guys and know there's an anchor point today as we're going to pray for you together as a body and we love you unconditionally all of you let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus just want to ask a blessing Lord over my brothers and sisters to come up here Lord not to just receive a Bible Lord you can buy one anywhere but Lord just to just to show and to display Lord that they're receiving you father and Lord there's many things that we learn and you know we got our work our careers that we're looking forward to that we're praying about but Lord Jesus there's nothing more important than what's in your word Lord and points to that message that you've given us in this hour and Lord may they always be faithful to it father and in all that they do Lord Jesus may they be a light Lord as our brother Donnie has been talking about Lord that they have a Ministry father and Lord they may never share a Bible with someone but whenever they walk down the street or through a classroom or on the job Lord that someone could see them and say they there's a Christian father there's there's a True Believer Lord not not a make believe Lord not a fake religion Lord but just they can see that Holy Spirit burning in them Lord Lord let that be all of our desires father we just pray Lord that your blessing would be upon them and for those who weren't here Lord and for your children Lord around the world Lord as we take this step bless the service we pray and just teach us Lord to draw closer to you in all that we do in Jesus name amen [Applause] if you don't mind staying with us sing this oh brother M is okay thank you let's sing this before brother H comes how many he loves his presence [Music] here we are in your presence lifting holy hands to [Music] you here here we [Music] are Praise In [Applause] Jesus for the things he's brought us through here we are in your presence lifting holy hands to you here me [Music] are praising [Applause] Jesus for the things he's brought us [Music] through in your presence [Music] lifting holy hands to [Music] you everybody now here we are thank you Lord praise praise in [Music] Jesus for the s things he's brought us through once again here we [Music] are Lord here we are what a great privilege father in your [Music] presence we lift him holy hands to you church here we are we are Praise In Jesus for all the [Music] things he's brought us through [Music] praise the Lord how many knows it's been a bunch of things that he's brought us through by his grace praise the Lord let's turn tonight if you would to the Book of Daniel chapter 7 verse 25 I'd like to make mention to you about the youth camp that our youth and um some of the others will be going up to Ohio for the meetings there this weekend leaving tomorrow early so we just ask that youd pray for them Lord be with them give them a a safe journey and also visit them in a special way we just believe in the Lord to heal the sick fill with the Holy Ghost Save The Lost just whatever that they have need of tonight I me knows that it's we it's a needy time in the day and age that we're living in Daniel is one of the most prophetic books of the Old Testament and symbols and also prophetic utterances Daniel spoke a great deal about the End Time chapter 7 verse 25 he's speaking about the Antichrist that'll come in the last day Anointed with the power of the Beast and he shall speak great words words against the most high I want you notice how that Daniel points out the things that will transpire under this administration of Satan and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the most high so he will not be able to wear out the most high but what he will do is speak great words against him but he shall wear out the Saints of the most high look at this word wear Aramaic word which means to wear away wear out to harass constant ly can anybody say amen amen and shall wear out the Saints of the most high and think to change times and laws to change times and laws so it'll be laws of nature all kinds of laws that he will seek to change and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time now the prerequisite of this is coming up to the part of blaspheming of course God and his great character and wearing out the Saints and then you go into the latter part of that and it will be given into his hand for a time and times and a half of time in other words three and a half years 1 Peter 4:12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you I want you notice Peter's words here that they are to try them not consume them or destroy them try them and to try their Graces the virtues that they've received by the grace of God it will try that but it will destroy the weaknesses around the their lives and give them opportunity to be able to prove the truth that it's actually in their soul in sincerity and constancy but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings you mean to be a child of God and what we go through for his sake we are actually suffering with the Lord Jesus what an honor that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy now let me read to you from a little Easter sermon and U this was a sunrise service in 417 1960 why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble now listen what he does puts bits in its mouth puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us closer into a closer fellowship with God can anybody say Amen to that amen so I want to speak to you tonight on bits in troubles mouth bits in troubles mouth not trouble plural but trouble as in possessive so God puts bits now for those of you that's rode horses been around horses you know that there's different types types of bits the Snapple bit the Hackamore there's broken bit straight bit there's all different types of bits what's it all for to control you got a horse that has very very sensitive mouths they might use a hackamore or a hybrid a hackamore is that which goes across his nose doesn't actually go just in his mouth alone and whenever you need to stop him it will actually push pressure down on his nose and it affects his breathing doesn't take him very long to yield to it if it's a snaffle bit it'll be a little bit different I've had several different types of horses and each one of them was a little bit more comfortable with a particular bit that they were used to so God puts a bit into trouble's mouth then you know what he does he sets you on top of Tru trouble oh my so you put your foot in trouble's sterup and then you throw your leg across troubles back and then you hang on for everything you've got let's pray together Lord Jesus I pray that you would speak to our hearts tonight father we've gathered here once again Lord that we might be benefited and we already have been to sing and to worship and your prayer request and Lord we're made known of different needs and we're believing you father that you'll be mindful of every one of them Lord tonight now Jesus we come to the preaching part and I'm asking you that you just help me Lord apparently there's there's needs among the people because I thought I was ready for tonight but yesterday you started dealing with me in a different direction and today I had to take several hours to try to get ready for this tonight so I'm looking forward to what you've got to say so I pray that you would speak to our hearts anoint me Lord anoint the people that we can be benefited by our gathering together we ask in the name of Jesus and the saint said amen amen God bless you you may be seated so God puts a bit in trouble's mouth trouble as possess now not plural and then God puts trouble allows trouble to get in our life and what do we do with a horse we ride it we hook it to a buggy we hook it to a cart we hook it to a wagon But whichever that we do it's a means of transportation and it gives us control now as I said I've owned in the past different types of horses Quarter Horses uh tisy Walking Horse Arabians um just different types of horses and their breed and their nature you know you might take one Bridal and use it on one particular one and then put that same one on another one and oh here he'll spit and he'll take his tongue and push against that thing because it's an object that does not belong in his mouth so you can imagine you're you're running around with this piece of Cold Steel in between your teeth and and your tongue is right on the top of it and you're hitting it and it depends on whoever it is on your back and how they know whether or not how to ride you and what to do with that and they can really make it tough on your mouth and depending on what you have been bred to do and what you have done I owned a barrel racing horse one time and for barrel racing you want one that is very very sensitive and he wants needs to be trained to where you won't have to jerk him and basically you just take that rain and it's it's so sensitive you lay it right against their neck so if you want to go left you simply lay the rain on the right part of his neck you don't have to pull him you don't have to jerk him just lay it just like that that's it's amazing because you're laying it on the right side of his neck but he knows that means you want to go left so the other way it's exact opposite and I had one Andale was his name and you could spin him in circles you could just go around and around in circles and just by touching as long as you had that rain on his neck he would go around and around and around didn't take the two or three times for me cuz I'm kind of wooy headed anyway but he could go and go and go he was so broke with that so he would be able to just move back and forth and back and forth but one of the first ones that I had his name was Charlie and Charlie wasn't very big he was about like that I used to teach teach brother Charlie terz actually and tell him that I had a horse that sort of reminded me of brother Charlie and there was something about Charlie whenever W brothers would go up in the mountains and would go to riding and uh it was strip mine roads that was in the mountains are in Kentucky where I lived and we would ride for hours and hours tremendous place to ride and whenever you'd get Charlie to going there was something about him he just a weird horse whenever you'd get to running he'd go to kicking his back legs so instead of running and Galloping he'd run with his front feet and kick with his back feet I've had a few church people like that it just seemed like they can never get in stride it's like part of them wants to run and part of them wants to kick and poor old Charlie he never did know EX exactly what to do I never got that horse broke from that I'm hoping I won't have to say the same thing about some of our church people but you know when we look at this setting we look at a very strange thing because always whenever I would saddle whichever horse it was that I had and I had a Tennessee Walking Horse and I lived out at gray I brought him here from Kentucky and I I didn't have to used his bit very much at all he'd been trained to voice command so whenever he was jet black had a little bit of white on two feet and whenever I would get on his back and I would settle saddle him up and I would start going down frog level Road there where we lived in graay and I would speak to him and I would say rack Smokey and he would start racking like a Tennessee Walking Horse I would say cancer he would break that I mean I voice command now every now and then I would still have to kind of pull on him a little bit and remind him who the boss was but one of the last ones that I had was a Polish Arabian the most gentle one I ever had like a dog follow you around on the field just pest aggravates you to death if you wouldn't speaking to him loving on him he couldn't understand it just absolutely you know what the more I'm preaching about these horses the more I realize we got people here in the church like that but all the horses that I own for the most part I enjoyed them and that was for an element of pleasure so why would God get this power and put a a big it in its mouth and set you and you and you and me on this power called trouble and it's not for our pleasure at all it's not for fun as a matter of fact I get scared sometimes when I'm on trouble trouble can bring fear out of the best of us and trouble is so hardheaded trouble is so stubborn and trouble is dangerous and trouble has this about it that it's like we never fully understand it no matter how many years that you are put upon trouble it's like each time is a little bit different than the other and about the time you think you understand it the next time you're on it it will display something that you never knew before I realize that as Christians and as believing children of God we don't don't ask God for the easy way we don't ask God to make us free from trouble we don't ask God to make us on a flowery bed of ease while those before us have suffered tremendously I would be ashamed to ask God for that would you but yet I'm not saying either that I want God to saddle trouble for me every day I don't know about you I enjoy trouble free days it seems like the older I get and the more that I'm on this Earth it seems like the less trouble-free days that I have anybody know what I'm talking about and it's it's not just me of course but it seems like so many people that you talk to are dealing with so many things let's read Galatians 6:7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that Seth to the flesh flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting let us not be weary in welld doing weary and well-doing again look at the meaning of weary faint to be utterly spiritless to be utterly spirit less to be wearied out or exhausted exhausted by what riding trouble and the problem is we're trying to get off and we're trying our best to use the bits but what we found out is we don't always have control control of trouble every now and then the Lord will let us have the Reigns ourself but a lot of times we don't have no control of trouble he's actually the one that's controlling it and we're on this thing and we're leaning to the left and leaning to the right and we're whoa whoa whoa slow down no no I don't want that don't go that way stop I said stop and it's like trouble pays no attention to us at all as a matter of fact it seems like the more we holler the louder he gets and the more he bucks and if you could see your live tonight some of you it would be like you're having your own spiritual rodeo and they open the gate and they let you out and you've got oh my whatever the wildest bucking Bron on the circuit rodeo and you're right on that thing and you're not even really a professional rodeo star and you're flinging and you're going back and forth and you don't think lord I can't hang on here another second it seem like every way I'm turning my husband is sick and I'm sick and our kids are sick Lord we're struggling with this and we're struggling with that God Don't You Love Me yeah actually he saddled trouble for you which is a proof of his love you see if you were a baby he would have actually saddled one of those many horses and you just walked right over the top of him so you know if it gets a little bit rough on one of them mini guys you just stand up and he just goes right out from under you and really a lot of of us that's what we would prefer that our battles would be Min style oh we grab up and grab a hold of its little ears I'll tell you some of the meanest ones I ever had was chatlin ponies they'd bite you they'd stomp you they'd kick you that's right just something about the nature of them and we all oh I didn't mind them so bad because if they was sure enough I've stood up a few times and let them just keep on going but you feel safer but it seemed like the more you grow in God and the more you go the bigger trouble gets now you know used to trouble was about 14 Hands High that's not such a bad fault at all really 14 Hands and then trouble got to where he was 15 and then he got to be thorough breed size 17 to and now he's on steroids so he's about 20 one hands high and you're trying trying trying and you're up on top of him and you got to get a a ladder to get up there much less to get off and the higher you get you know I've rode many of them and they they want to rare up with you and I had won one time and man and Harry's younger brother Jamie he he was a pretty he was a pretty fired up horse and animals can tell if you're afraid of them or not so Jamie wanted to ride this one and Jamie was young of course and and as soon as Jamie come out to the barn where hairy head and I mean he said I I want to run him all right all right you know he's kind of kind of kind of fiery oh it's that's okay as soon as Jamie got on that horse that horse took off I mean like a buck and Bron he had never done that with me but he sensed Jamie Shan's fear animals do that you know it's the same with trouble and when God will put this bits in its mouth and we get up on its back and our fear goes to pulsating out of our being and trouble senses it Rob is scared to death how many's ever had that happen to you maybe not with a horse but with a dog believe me listen Scotty is got a dog in near in their neighborhood there that dog was was abused by a man that dog has bit UPS FedEx USPS I don't know how many people it's bit but whenever I come into their driveway that dog will that dog will bark but I'll stand right there and look at it and say rain laid down you know what rain does rain goes behind the cloud rain backs off you know why rain knows I'm not afraid the prophet told us when we are afraid they can smell it do you understand your body puts out this and they can smell it I want to be the type of Christian that when God Saddles up trouble for me and hands me the rins and leads me to believe I'm in charge and I climb up on top of this 22 Hand high trouble that I want to stand up here like a real man anybody in here with me tonight I don't want to stand and Shake in my boots literally as we would say but if God has chosen out this particular one for me now I got to tell you that I I've seen a few rodeos and I'm not no Cowboy by no means I ain't got no desire to be and I've never understood why anybody would want to climb up on the back of a Herford Bull and ride that bull around a pen I mean I have no desire whatsoever to do such or a buck and BR but when you look at what we are called to do God Almighty knows he has a people that he can allow to be tested and tried like no other and the church said now you see he himself experiened things in the way that we do Carol and I heard this this sermon today in perfect faith if you haven't heard it be good for you to listen to it the prophet is speaking about Jesus he said when he raised up that boy that Widow son from na I believe in the prince of House of David he sat on a rock and groaned with a headache he bore our infir infirmity bear means to pack them he bore it he had all things like we had he had sickness he had Temptations He had trouble he had frustration how many ever gets flustered with people with life with family members with church people Jesus got flustered I guarantee you all all of it was not with the Pharisees either no doubt he got flustered with Peter and John and the disciples those that said they loved him no doubt he did and what did Spirit God do Spirit God saddled trouble and put the Lord Jesus on trouble and he had to ride trouble to the Cross but it didn't stop there he rode him down to Hell amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus why because God put bits in trouble's mouth and trouble simply transported Our Savior now let me remind you all of us love Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastors on and on and on David wrote but I will remind you before there could be a Psalm 23 numerically there must be a Psalm 22 my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they Pooch their lip out at me you know the Bulls of Bashan are against me a Psalm 22 is what led in to Psalm 23 and you understand what God did he put the bits in trouble's mouth and let the Lord Jesus conquer deaths hell and the grave and if we as the people of God are going to be Overcomers and set with him and his throne then I guarantee you there's going to be many a ride that we're going to have on the back of trouble oh yes friend we're going to be afraid oh yes we will be weary anybody in here weary tonight just weary of fighting sometimes and just just get weary of life look I I don't want to go to heaven simply because I'm weary I want to go to heaven because I love the Lord Jesus some just get sick of living and that's one of the reasons they want to go to heaven I don't want to go to heaven because I'm sick of life I want to go to heaven because I love him more than I love anything in this present world but yes I do get weary at times you ever get tired at the end of the week on Friday and it seemed like from 12 to 4:00 ain't never going to come to an end and you go and you go and you look at your watch and you look at your watch only a few more hours and you get a few days off and it seem like it will never come does that mean you ain't going back to your job again on Monday no it just simply means you're pretty excited about the weekend well I'll tell you it's not that I'm ready to stop serving the Lord it ain't that I'm sick and tired well I'll tell you what I'm just quitting preaching I'm sick of preaching I'm sick of people I'm quitting preaching no I ain't what it is I'm just getting close to quitting time and I'm getting a little bit anxious I said I'm getting a little bit anxious but just in case I am alive on Sunday well we'll be here again won't we and if I'm alive on next Wednesday we'll be here again but with great anticipation I wait for the time to which I will have completed my ride on trouble's back and I will be able to get a transfer of power and I will come with him out of Heaven riding on another horse and his name will not be Charlie or trouble praise be to God if we want to come Hallelujah riding with our lord Jesus in Revelation 19 as he came out of heaven and we're going to come back at the battle at the end of the Millennium at the battle of Armageddon we must ride trouble right now so I don't know about you I'm ready to grab a ho to the strap I'm ready to climb up in the saddle I ain't going to go out there and saddle him myself I'm not going to put the Bridle in him but if God has him saddled and he's standing there and I'm thinking oh oh Lord you mean Paul oh oh Paul I prefer my brother I prefer oh yes let brother Kei have him this round Lord let brother Dave have him my my let brother Larry have him but if God's pointing to men say come on Dy Lord you know I'm scared of heights Lord you know I don't care for white horses you know Lord that I I really like a a pain horse I've always wanted a pain horse you know that's the kind I like Donnie this one's got put your name on it your name's on the bridal your name's on the saddle your name's on the chaps your name's on the boots come on Donnie but Lord you know I don't want to go this way but Donnie I've got confidence in you I've got confidence in you oh you do well okay well if if you got confidence in me then that gives confidence in me too because you would never put me on trouble's back if you knew trouble was going to destroy me I was somebody would preach with me tonight if God has saddle trouble up and put you on his back he did not do it to destroy you he did not do it to wipe you out he never let trouble come your way he never let saturnist strike you and difficult to strike you because he knew it would wipe you out he did it because he had confidence in you you might climb upon on there we would say and you're trembling in your boots and you're scared to death but all of a sudden before they ever let that gate open a piece that passes understanding moves down in your soul and you'll say by the grace of God I will ride this Trail again I will ride through this anxiety I will ride through this sickness and this sorrow I will ride through my failures and my mistakes and if I get bucked off of trouble I'll climb right back up on him again because you can't stop me devil I am made out of stuff that you can't BL I'm made out of stuff that you can't stop the Lord God had favor with me I have favor with him notice in James 1:2 my brethren count it all joy yeah when you fall into diverse Temptations anybody beside me need help with this scripture tonight counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work us notice the trying of your faith does not make patience but it works patience it works it worketh patience look at what the word patience means patient patient continuance patient waiting steadfastness constancy endurance in the New Testament the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings and the church said amen knowing this that the trying of your faith work as patient but let patience have notice the gender that James picked for describing it let patience have her perfect work perfect tellos lacking nothing not immature complete that's not the word faultless now but it is for grown and mature let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing and how are you going to get that on the back of trouble let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire oh my goodness wow wouldn't it be so much easier if it would have been blessings let blessings have her perfect work let shouting let jumping and oh how we love to do all that but yet God did not put bits in the mouth of shouting wow which one of us would not want to climb up this great Steed of shouting oh wow this beautiful magnificent thing of joy and blessing blessings and wealth and so happy that if you get any happier you're going to explode and so much joy you can't even hardly sit down I mean you said down you just you just got to get back up again cuz you're just happy you're on dope you're acting like a you're on something oh that's the horse we would all choose amen that's right true but God says hey you and when you get close to the pen there he is in the pen you say Lord have mercy that sounds like an African line oh Lord no Jesus no I I dra the wrong number there ain't no way Lord there ain't no way there's no way that I could you know I'm scared of loud noises you know I get nervous up all that bucking stuff no no no you you've got the wrong person you're Lord there's no no way that I could do this he said you can do more than you think come out of your sh you coward but Lord what if I get hurt what if I get hurt what if it didn't scare us too bad it could say that's what I'm hoping for I'm hoping you will I'm hoping your pride your arrogance your selfishness your self-centeredness oh my notice James goes on to say in verse 12 blessed is the man that endureth Temptation now this is a this can be a tricky word most people would take this word and think that it means you know you've been tempted to sin tempted to lie tempted of this but actually the word there that James used means this blessed is is the man that endures and the meaning is trial proving the trial of man's Fidelity Integrity virtue and constancy blessed is the man that endureth the trial in other words for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love of him oh my 1 Peter chap 1:6 wherein you greatly Rejoice don't now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness heaviness through manifold Temptations which is variegated which means many different aspects so it comes from this way and that way and that way and that way and that way so it comes in a manifold way that the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ and yet God would harness such a thing as trouble and test and trials and and put his children on the back of Danger on the back of something that could take their life and say I love you I love you I had a horse one time and my little young and Erica thought she wanted to ride that horse I knew she didn't know what she was talking about so I sat her on the back of that horse but I walked beside her and held her arm and she was a hard-headed stubborn little run so sometimes she had to be proven things and I kind of figured what this horse is going to do sure enough daddy let me have the rains let me have the rains she had to be in control you know so I'll let her have the rains but I had something more important I had her arm sure enough she got a hold of the Rings and that horse took off bucking raring whatever more but you know what happened her savior came in and grabbed a hold of her and pulled her off the back of trouble why it wasn't that Daddy would not have put her on that horse you see it's the same for you and I that we get into things sometimes ourself and God will warn us don't do this don't do that don't go there don't live this way don't do that way and we're standing right there and that horse is come on come on I dare you and you're saying oh I'm tougher than it Hallelujah I God throw that stair uper I can handle it I can handle it and the Lord says all right all right but aren't you glad that he don't let go even when we do some stupid stuff how many of you Christians have done some stupid stuff in your life of course you have but the grace of God is there just like I was with my little girl oh boy I was so glad but you know what that wasn't half the story she was more glad than I was because I saved her life they don't tell what that horse would have done there ain't no telling what I would have got myself into in my life as a child of God if the Lord and his grace hadn't to grabbed a hold of me come on somebody can you imagine we would not have this message in this day had God not had a hold to his Prophet when he took his gloves off and laid his hands on them electrical wires and going to take his life and oh yeah he saddled up trouble he got on trouble's back and he was going to take his life cuz he thought he couldn't take it no more but thank God when we get to a spot that we think we can't take it no more we'll end it all the grace of God is still there with his hand on us said Oh no you're not going out of here that way oh my oh how many needs Grace in your life lots of God's grace listen this in Victory Dad don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God wow you found favor with God you mean to tell me that when God Saddles up trouble it's not that he dislikes me actually I found favor I get in trouble instead of him having to Baby me you know and keep me away from any hardship P little little Donnie he's just he's a spoil of brat can't go through nothing any type of sickness or trial that hits him he just bellyaches and cries and Carries On the office every was I ain't going to put him charge of my Army I ain't going to put him in charge of leading a bunch of people now you don't want no leader like that do you want a coward you want a coward that leads you out on the Battlefront and then whenever the enemy comes in you look around for the leader and say where did he go say last time I seen him is heading that way about 95 mes an hour that any kind of leaders we need in this last day friends we need men that's willing to stand and be courageous that's the type of fathers that we need in a home come on somebody that's the type of preachers that we need and deacons that we need and Sunday school teachers and youth leaders is that right amen now watch he says you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test when it looks like everything has gone wrong God has giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hot bed plant or a hybrid you're a real Christian God has giving you a test to see what you'll do about it no wonder Peter said the fiery trials why counter The Joy more precious to you than gold and many times will H H oh well I just well that well that's something God give to you he knows you'll do it he's put trust in you my but how many of us would rather that he would trust us with a lot of money what about a little bit of Fame what about a little bit of Fortune what about Lord trust me with that now to us that makes more sense and we think well surely Trust me Jesus see what I can do give me a bunch of gifts give me a big church you know if it's a preacher make me make me this and and trust me with that and God said oh I I really trust you Fred I trust you so much and all hell breaks Lo around Fred the he said Lord why the world's gone Jesus said I trust you Fred men use buddies we've had Fellowship I've talked with you and you've talked with me and I can tell you you really love me and I'm going to use you as an example to Demons who can't love me and they have said about you that if I allow you to go through this and I'll sadle up trouble and put bits and troubles my you know what they've done for it they've accused you before my throne and they've told me that if I let you go through this you'll turn your back on me but you won't will you Freddy glory to God when Erica was going through her sickness so much that these are some of my favorite quotes and some of hers also by the way I would send them to her over and over again from time to time maybe I'd see her send her at morning or something like that and see her up in the day later and she'd say thank you for the quotes Daddy I appreciate it really encouragement to me she said I don't mean it wrong but sometimes I wish I hadn't found so much favor in his sight anybody ever felt like that Lord you can back off with so much favor if you want to but he can trust Oh by so many people yeah goodness blessings miracles signs W yes yes yes Lord yes amen me me me Lord me me me let me be a miracle worker Lord let me have this gift let me have that but how many can he Trust when he will break their heart into and he looks at them and says I can trust them they're going to cry to me they're going to pray I will remain silent for weeks I will not let them feel anything they'll pray they'll cry they they'll read their Bible they'll even go to church and it'll seem like they didn't get nothing out of church but I can trust them they're so faithful they're wearing trouble out I head toward trouble and they say Greg Robbins ain't going to ride me again is he boy ain't that the kind of Christian you want to be that when God goes to work troubles pin with the brid in his mouth and said you ain't going to let Becky have you are you oh no not Becky again oh no not Paul oh no not Ellie oh no no not not Jim no please all Christian brothers and sisters that's a type of church I want right here I don't care I do not care whether we are the fanciest Church in the message the richest church and the message the most well-dressed the most stylish give me a bunch of people that God can have confidence in and I will have a church I will be proud of and not only me but a church that almighty God will be proud of that God can say about us I can trust Word of Life I have let them go through one trauma after another oh they were scared they were frightened but they rallied together they stood on the promise of my word the demons said they would never make it but I said they would and I knew they would be able to stand for me I could trust them amen thank you Lord help us Lord Jesus notice this he's talking about Shadrach Meshach and abido they had their their faith was put to a test and when their faith is put to a test they don't fail stay right with what you believe and when their FA Faith was put to a test and when through the crucial hour not only did they my my go to an ice Heap they went into a fiery furnace but Satan could not destroy them for God's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled Satan could not take them he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished he could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished oh I hear a song coming on he would not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of God had been finished neither could the lies eat Daniel until God's purpose had been finished oh praise the Lord neither could death and old age take Abraham until the purpose of God had been finished now let's bring her up to 2024 neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of of our life is finished so it makes no difference how many time God puts me on trouble's back and I may think boy this will be my last ride and God said oh no it won't boy you've got years of Bron riding left in you you've got years of trouble don't you fear trouble I will make trouble bow to your face that's what we want I don't want trouble to bow to my feeling I don't want it to bow to my emo I want trouble to bow to my face in God's promised word oh my listen at the sequence of how this works there had been no rainbow until the flood came but actually Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to flood 40 days and nights in a storm the little Ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time notice the sequence and the Order of God's events the rainbow didn't come first for encouragement it was the promise of the word he had to build it by faith according to God's promise to him is that right he didn't know he was going to see a rainbow God never even promised a rainbow but he saw the rainbow After the flood praise the Lord after he' went through the tri tribulation he saw the promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation we ask for comfort and peace and God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations and we're thinking this is the wrong address this is the wrong package I do not remember I mean let me check my orders and see no I never asked for troubles and trials Lord I ask for peace and joy and happiness and a little bit of reprieve and a little bit of healing and a little bit of this I never asked for trouble lord well he knows you never would but you see there's some of our things that are on auto field right they're on auto field and they just show up at your door they show up at your door cuz there ain't none of us sitting here tonight but say Lord I'll take trials if you want me to stand for you Jesus I'll tell you one thing glory to God I'll stand up in the midst of trial come on don't act like that you're putting on like all the rest of it all of us would take blessings over trouble all of us will take the easier route over the hard thing so God has Auto ships sent to your address brother skip he has to sent to each one of our address every now and he don't say you want it and it's got this label on the side of the Box No Return to Sender you have to expend it you got to wear trouble out oh my don't you want to be the type of believer tonight that when you go in the middle of hell and you get sick and you say well praise God we're about to get over it and before you get over your husband gets sick and then your baby gets sick and then you ain't got no money to pay your bills and you think what in the world is going on you're getting favor after favor blessing after blessing oh my but we don't look at it that way do we oh I know what older one I just saw it you see the southern plantation owners years and years ago they had hundreds and hundreds of Acres on their plantations and the types of horses that they had just wasn't comfortable so they started working on the breed of horse to be able to breed a horse that would be comfortable for their need and they did oh yeah they did they made one boy where that thing could prance and he was beautiful and oh so pleasant and so easy to ride yeah that's sort of what we've done around the message we've bred us a horse that is comfortable and it's easier going and then you know that's the kind of preachers we want we want to breed out preachers that'll just you know just Pat us on the head and rub us around in hone years good and so sweet and everything God told me not to lie right so we want to breed out the type of trials that we want well I I pick this and I pick that and God said no send him more wild eyed trouble down there send him more trouble when you go to getting near the thing oh old troubl Stander just a shaking and quer and said come on boy come on I remember the last time you was on my back I don't know who's shaking the most me or trouble trouble's wanting me to come and I'm saying I don't want to go I don't want to go and God said go Donnie go go I got confidence in I'm say no Lord no Lord can I set this one out father please I'd like to wait this one out anybody ever been there beside me I figured you had been I didn't figure the Lord had me to preach this he could have just told me all this at home by myself but I figured there somebody here tonight it might be somebody streaming you know how it is have a lot of sorry people to stream the services so no doubt God had to put you all little children I'm I'm sure that you folks are so disappointed because you come here tonight soaring with the angels and you were ready to Feast on Heavenly things that were so I am the pastor it wasn't until the Hebrew children forced into the fiery furnace one of their most outstanding trials they seen one like the Son of God the Son of God didn't come first the trial come first what if God is allowing you to go through where you are right now so that a great manifestation of his healing power his Deliverance power and God will take your testimony and be a blessing to so many people but the testimony won't come first the blessing may not come first it may be the trial so go ahead clench your teeth my grab a hold of that Bridal climb up on trouble and say come on trouble I'm telling you head time I done know who's going to win this ride by the grace of God I am I am because my father would never let me go through these things oh my if he did not have confidence in me Hallelujah notice this one like the Son of God send among this statement is astounding their troubles produced the son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave their troubles was actually what produced the son of God don't you see why Satan wants us to get discouraged when we're going through such hard times he knows it will produce a manifestation of God in our lives that would be so Supernatural and so phenomenal and we I wonder how many times have we cut off the manifestation of the Son of God because we stepped out of the fiery furnace or we got off of troubles back and said I can't take it no more I can't take it no more I ain't going back to church no more I'm qu I just can't deal with it no more too much stru and just right down the road tomorrow the Son of God was there waiting to deliver you oh my how many times have we cut short the blessing of God the power of God the peace of God all people say brother Donnie Lord have mercy I never had so much trouble in my life since I started coming to your church well that's a good sign that's a really good sign that's a good sign that Satan don't want you to be here then you ought to be more determined than you've ever been in your life I don't know about you I've got a greater desire than I've ever had to serve the Lord I but dnie but you're getting older I know I'm getting older but I've got more of a determination at 68 and I had at 18 I'm going to serve God I'm going to torment the devil I'm going to preach the word I'm going to cast out Devils I'm going to lay hands on the sick Hallelujah I'm going to Proclaim that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever their troubles produce the son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the Heatwave but not until they went into the fire did that comforter appear so it wasn't prefire that the comforter appeared it's when they got right in the middle of it you imagine they might have come back closer say you know what well I I just can't take this no no no you know what I I'll compromise I I'll act like I'm doing this but I want my heart you know I I I won't worship this God but I just about oh Jehovah I Love You Lord God I love you I Praise You Lord God but they instead of done that said no we'll not do it he can do it he can deliver us we just not sure he will they had no promise that he would they had no scripture they had no quotes telling them he would do that but they said we will not compromise notice what he said about Daniel it was after the heat was put on and it was soed into the lion's den after that he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the midst of him keeping away the great Pillar of Fire standing between him and the Lions notice how the prophet puts this in order after they come to their great trials not before it was Abraham after he had seen the ground get Barren and the drought come and lot separate himself and go down to live deliciously into the world it was after he heard the whines and the cries of his herdsmen with no grass for his cattle but he maintained in the land that God gave him as on that day after he had been tried his patience was at the end it was on that day that when after the trial was over he spoke face to face was Elohim under the Yol of that day praise be to God so God grabs a hold to trouble and puts bits in its mouths and says come on child trust me you can trust me Father you know I'm afraid I know you are and I remember how afraid I was you see the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews that the Lord Jesus it was heard in that he feared the Lord Jesus was afraid he was afraid he experienced fear for me and for you he did not want to climb on the back of trouble you think he wanted to be hung on that cross his clothes stripped off on him and hung their naked them ridicule him make fun of him pull beard out of his face you think he wanted to be an open shame painful hurting humiliation reproach a curse in the eyes of God and M but God had the bits and troubles mouth and the Lord Jesus in the garden said father if it be thy will let trouble pass from me is there an easier way or is there is there some other way is there anyone else he knew there wasn't he knew there wasn't these way I've said it to you before he didn't just ask why he experienced why and many has God why why this why that why it's not just a word it can be a heartbreaking experience oh if the church could only wait to itself today to find out after the troubles and the trials and the laughs and the made fun of the things the church has been through the Pentecost the church and yet we see God in our midst doing great signs praise God and wonders now we want the signs and we want the Wonders and we want the supernatural they're not going to happen until we ride on trouble and when God allows this bride to come to a spot right before she leaves he said there will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost do you understand we will ride our last ride on trouble right before rapturing grace rapturing Time rapturing strengths rapturing Faith rapturing power consummates into the body and the Dynamics will strike our mechanics if they're in order and there will be such power that will hit the head up here at the top who we are do you think that this is just my happen stance that man in this age is coming up with what they call artificial intelligence do you think that it's just a a spot brother lelot did it some time ago on an artificial intelligence and he sent me a song that he taed in for artificial intelligence to write a song about brother brandham and his message he did another one just last week or week before last about what was the essence of Christ The Mystery of God reveal from William bradam artificial intelligence in a matter of seconds spit out a summary of Christ The Mystery of God revealed it was so good I thought about using myself it was unbelievable it was unbelievable how this artificial intelligence remember the prophet said the last thing to come would be the intelligence to step into the body which is Christ himself so here we've got it out here now you understand that Israel for the first time the first Wars and battles that have been fought have been fought using artificial intelligence in the last 10 months artificial intelligence I don't want no artificial intelligence I want the mind that was in Christ Jesus so if the world out here can you imagine spitting out a song brother William Smith done the same thing and told artificial intelligence to write a song a Christian song about brother Joe and sister Jennifer Hara and not only did it spit the words out but a person sang the song it was beautiful it was a beautiful song artificial intelligence what if they can do that via computer what about God stepping into his body the bride oh my can't you see what it will be the prophetic state was right here the eyes and the prophet said there's nothing left but the intelligence and we have none of our own so Christ the head will step into the body and he will call for the resurrection and it will be faster than artificial intelligence can ever spit it out Hallelujah to God and the power of God God will come upon the Earth and cause the resurrection of the dead and our bodies will be changed in a moment and the twinkling of an eye you say brother Donnie when will these trials ever cease when you don't need them no more Hallelujah when you don't need them no more and God will put up trouble oh my then the tribulation period will break out for other let me tell you something you think you're having troubles you ain't seeing nothing compared to what it's going to be when them seals open up in reality oh my don't you love him so much let's Stand Together praise the Lord notice the prophet said they have to have a crucifixion before you can have a resurrection and before the church will ever be able to see a resurrected power before I can ever see a new ministry take place myself before you can ever enter into a new fellowship with God here's your answer there's got to be a self crucifixion so there can come a resurrection a self crucifixion before Abraham could see Elohim there had to be 25 years of testing hallelujah hallelujah well come on trouble let's get it on come on don't worry I ain't going out to the barn to settle up trouble I wasn't born I was born in the morning but it wasn't yesterday morning but if I wake up in the morning and the Lord God settled up trouble for me then the Lord God knew I could write him and he would never saddle him and send him my way if he knew it would destroy my facei and destroy my walk but it's to encourage me and maybe encourage others don't you love him tonight oh you say brother Donnie I messed up so bad I understand so what do we do read this to you and be certain of God I'm sure I'm speaking to peoples this morning who's come to that place I have been there many times myself when I've went back and traced my life and turned every stone and I'd find that I did something wrong I'd go and confess it and say Lord God I'll make it right go do so then come back again and say now Lord Thou Art God you'll answer me surely I've met every request that you required me to do and every requirement I've met it and still he won't move seems to sit silent that's when you've got to be sure that he is God don't be discouraged only thing is that in your heart to be certain of God maybe there's some here tonight that that BL place you've searched your heart you've turned every stone you don't know anything else to do here's the last thing to do be certain of God not of yourself don't be certain of me don't be certain of the church don't be certain of your mama be certain of God be certain of God and ride trouble until you break that thing amen until your face will overcome that test thank you Lord thank when you've met everything that he said and you're sure that he's God that's when faith is going to work right there Faith stands steady for it knows that he is and youve met every requirement and if you've met God's requirement and in your heart you believe that he is God's only testing your face for he loves to do that he loves to do that to be honest with you I want to love what he loves and there's some things I can pretty easy you know but then there's other things that he loves I just got to be honest with you I don't even like them much less love him that's right that means with me you understand what I'm saying so so what do I do does he love it because it brings anxiety he loves it because of the end result and what he knows it will do for me yeah and this is why I've been saying God help me help me that I'll look at it that way then I I may not love it per se but I will love the end result yes Carol and I was coming up through 26 yesterday day out of South Carolina it seemed like to me they've been working over on 26 forever in a day I mean they are still working on it down through Columbia South Carolina you know down through Greenville on down through there I mean it was you know go around this way go around that way slow traffic bow up and stop in front of you flash and lights this that and other and then finally a few miles before we got into Asheville here it turns into this brand new Interstate 26 three lanes going east three lanes going west I mean brand new concrete brand new signs I looked over at her and I said you know what I said that's sort of like us I said if we live long enough no doubt we'll get to drive on that new road I mean I'm not sure I'll live long enough but I'm just saying I'm just saying and I said that's the way we are we got these detours and these ups and downs and you run off a black top into concrete and then you run over to the temporary yellow strip in the road you say Lord have mercy you know it just makes you so tense cuz people boing up and stopping in front of you and then you come out where they finished it boy you can just sit there wow my family for years has been trying to get me to go on a cruise with them but I tell them this is the kind of cruise I like that button in my car will you push like this I don't want on no water I get sick on a horse so I got up on that thing wow it was so nice brand new smooth I just thought Jesus let me be that yeah my life no doubt is been up and down and ins and outs and arounds and detours and whatever more but please Lord let my finished lap be with that sign over here on the right hand side end of construction amen is that what we want brother FR is that what we want is that what we want brother Paul Hallelujah Lord Jesus help us tonight Lord Lord I know that there's several folks in our church that are sick and several different ones having to go through surges of late and facing hard times in their life as their Pastor I must admit I would do them a great disadvantage I know I would because I love them with a Divine love but I must say my human love so presses on me that I would take a a lot of them trials away from them I would just go to them and I I I would just rebuke that devil and and make it leave them and that trial will be over in a day or two but I would mess up so many things and it ain't that I love them more than you do I love them differently and you look at it in long term I'm looking at Short Term Lord Jesus those that are sick those that are suffering those that are having family issues troubles in their life on their jobs in their homes help us Lord so if you put bits and troubles mouths and have a special delivery to our door may we not be fearful may we with Grace climb up on trouble's back and look for you to bring us to the ultimate Victory oh Jesus we know life has so many disappointments and things about it that it just just confuses us at times but Lord we believe that these examples that we've heard preached tonight it was after the Hebrew children experience Their Fear and their trauma we know from just a little burn on her finger or a little burn on her hand or something how how painful that is and their entire bodies were thrown into a fire that was so hot it killed the men who threw them in and you never saw stood on the outside of the door Fanning before they went in they didn't see you in the fire they just were thrown in blindly as we would say but once they broke into the fire barrier they felt this powerful wave of cool air coming straight off the shores of the Sea of life and it blowed every bit of the smoke and the fire right off of their bodies so their trial was crowned by a visitation of the Son of God after 25 years Abraham's trial was crowned with a visitation with Elohim himself Lord maybe our Trials of you taking a loved one from us and us having to go through this life without them and missing them and crying and reminiscing and going going through the heartache Lord that that trial will be crowned one morning with that resurrection of our loved one in a glorified body Lord Jesus may you bring comfort and peace tonight to every heart forgive us Lord forgive me for every time trouble has showed up at my door my door with bits in its mouth help me Lord Jesus how much every time I have left on this Earth to face the things that you and your wisdom allow to come to pass help me to face it with strength and courage as a Son of God with every head bowed tonight how many would like to be remembered before the Lord how many would say was me tonight tonight Lord I want strength I want courage forgive me for complaining anybody in here beside me complain about your test and your trials and the things you go through remember FR friends there will be things said about you things said about your family things said about our church that could not be said about those in the book of Acts we will overcome things and God will use us to prove his power is Victorious I know we're in worry sometimes I know the stock market Falls and this and that in the world is going on look children there ain't no need in us sitting around and worrying about Cala becoming president Plumbing November ain't no needing worrying about it you're worrying ain't going to do one thing don't let the devil rob you of your joy I've told you before if she is the woman that God's Prophet saw in that Vision I don't care what the poll numbers say or nothing else there ain't nothing we're going to do to stop and if she is God hasten the day because we'll be one prophecy closer to the coming of the Lord oh brother Donnie that scares me to death why it's fulfilling prophecy if that's what it was I don't know if she is or she ain't I want to be ready I may not live to November I want to be ready every day of my life how many want strengths courage tonight would you lay your hand over on one another if you don't mind there you go hand to Believers to Believers thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord God Eagle to Eagle believer to believer Lord as these children of God have their hands laid one upon the other we pray for them tonight father Lord you know every person here and what they're going through or there may be a few of them here tonight and they said well that sermon wasn't ready for me because I'm doing pretty good think none of us knows what we'll be facing by Friday so I may not be in a low spot tonight or going through a very difficult trial but I'm still going to take this word and store it up and chew on it cuz I may be by Monday or I may be by Saturday so I want to have this word stored up in my heart so if it comes my way I'll know how to face it better Lord we don't want to fail you I guess that would be our greatest fear that we would fail you and somehow become a stumbling block to others I pray if I've ever been a stumbling block to anyone family member friend someone I've preached to in any way please forgive me Lord please forgive me if I've failed you or failed your people if there's one thing Lord even as I mentioned Sunday that many times it's not the things that we do but it's so those sins of omission that we omit prayer we omit faith and accept fear we omit confidence and accept failure forgive us Lord help us that we lord God from this night forward will look at trials in a way like we've never looked at them before that you Lord God are the one who's placed Us in this life and you know how to choose our battles you know how to choose them and match us to them perfectly you would never choose one that is going to destroy us father we pray for one another Lord I pray for my sheep tonight several sick Lord some had surgery some facing surgery some facing very serious things I pray for each one of them tonight father in the name of Jesus Lord God we believe your word Lord and if it's for a season to let them be tried then dear God I don't want to rebuke it away from them tonight before the time would be up but Lord in the name of Jesus would you strengthen us that our faith can be strong in your promise we too like Abraham at the end of our trials will see Elohim at the end of our trial is Shadrach mesach and Abednego we'll feel the waves
