[38:18] the word and we're just in Sydney we'll
[38:20] bring a little Sun Jew today will
[38:23] dedicate him to the Lord
[38:27] [Music]
[38:44] bring down
[38:47] [Music]
[38:53] bring the little ones
[39:03] I guess this is the last one too
[39:05] bear the Reagan name finally a boy
[39:15] Heavenly fathers we stand you in your
[39:17] presence today
[39:19] we're so grateful for the gift of life
[39:23] if we had all the wealths of the world
[39:25] and yet died we had every fine
[39:28] automobile lived in the finest homes
[39:32] what would all be worse if we didn't
[39:34] have life
[39:36] so life is a great thing
[39:38] we're thankful Lord Jesus that you've
[39:41] given to us the privilege of life
[39:44] father is Justin and Sydney bring the
[39:47] little son Jude Harrison Reagan into
[39:52] your presence today I know this thing
[39:54] here was gratitude in their hearts and
[39:56] so happy
[39:57] I pray Lord that you would just help
[39:59] them we know that these children don't
[40:02] come with a manual
[40:03] they don't come with a how-to
[40:06] book to tell us how to raise them
[40:09] so you gave us one yourself your
[40:12] scripture and we're thankful Lord
[40:15] that you've given a set I pray that
[40:16] should help both of them to be able to
[40:19] instill in him that which will be
[40:21] lasting Justin might be able to teach
[40:24] him different things that he knows no
[40:26] doubt Sydney could teach him things that
[40:28] she knows but yet if it would only be in
[40:31] this life and things pertaining to this
[40:33] life then what would happen when this
[40:36] life is over
[40:37] so what I believe they want to instill
[40:39] in him is those things that will get him
[40:43] on the other side
[40:44] to the real continuation of life
[40:47] so we're bringing before you today
[40:48] Father
[40:49] I pray that you keep him from the evils
[40:51] of this day Tom will Terry get old
[40:54] enough to be able to acknowledge and
[40:56] receive you may do it while he's tender
[40:58] Lord
[40:59] keep him from the sickness the diseases
[41:01] the plagues of humanity we're dedicate
[41:04] his little life to you today the life of
[41:06] service in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:09] amen
[41:14] [Applause]
[41:22] you saw a rare thing that's the only few
[41:24] times I've ever seen these eyes
[41:28] God bless you to stand together
[41:38] I'm under
[41:41] such expectations today
[41:46] what our Lord is
[41:48] gone to speak to us
[41:51] Mark chapter 16 verse 17.
[41:56] while you're turning there
[41:59] I want to
[42:03] want to speak to you today on
[42:05] the brides bill
[42:08] of Rights
[42:11] the bride's bill
[42:13] of Rights
[42:17] and these signs shall follow them
[42:20] that believe
[42:22] in my name they shall cast out devils
[42:28] they shall speak with new tongues
[42:31] they shall take up serpents they drink
[42:33] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[42:37] they shall lay their hands
[42:40] on the sick
[42:42] and they shall recover
[42:44] behold notices
[42:47] Luke chapter 10
[42:49] verse 19 as well
[42:52] Mark catches it quite unlike on any of
[42:56] the rest of the gospel writers
[42:58] but Luke pins this in this way
[43:02] with the commission given to the
[43:04] apostles
[43:05] behold I give unto you
[43:07] power
[43:09] To Tread on serpents and scorpions
[43:13] and Over All
[43:15] the power of the enemy
[43:19] I guess the question is do we believe
[43:21] that
[43:23] now in the New Testament whenever we see
[43:26] the word power there's a couple
[43:28] different Greek words that was actually
[43:29] used for it in the original
[43:32] one of them is excusia
[43:35] which is an authority given to you to do
[43:40] something
[43:41] but it doesn't mean you have that power
[43:43] dwelling in you that's excusia
[43:47] so this is what Jesus gave to the
[43:50] apostles initially an authority sort of
[43:53] like a State Trooper or a policeman or a
[43:56] deacon
[43:57] somebody that's given Authority but it's
[44:00] not that they have that Authority
[44:01] dwelling in them but it's given to them
[44:05] then the other word that's used the way
[44:07] we translate it power in the New
[44:09] Testament is dunamis
[44:12] and that is where we get our word
[44:14] Dynamite from and it's the power of an
[44:18] inherent life
[44:20] so it's something actually within you
[44:23] that's coming out expressing itself
[44:27] notice Jesus says behold I give unto you
[44:30] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[44:32] and over all the power of the enemy and
[44:36] nothing
[44:37] shall by any means hurt you let me bless
[44:40] him nothing shall by enemies oh but you
[44:43] say brother Donnie what about sickness
[44:45] what about that can't hurt you
[44:48] I know it seems strange people think my
[44:50] that is the craziest thing I ever heard
[44:52] in my life no it just can't hurt the
[44:55] real you
[44:56] or it might bother your body it might
[44:58] bother your spirit but your spirit is
[45:00] not you your body is not you
[45:04] I made like to remember today as we pray
[45:07] I'd like you to remember me as well the
[45:09] Lord just helped me hear him speak to us
[45:11] today
[45:12] father we're so grateful today to be in
[45:15] your house and thankful for each one
[45:17] that's your present Lord for those that
[45:19] are streaming the service around the
[45:21] world those that will go back and
[45:23] archive it we pray for them as well
[45:25] today Father those that are sick that
[45:27] would love to be here and cannot now
[45:30] we're bringing our requests and our
[45:32] needs before you we're so needy as we
[45:34] stand here Lord no doubt in my mind I'm
[45:38] the most native person here today
[45:41] because I have to stand before these
[45:43] people and try to bring something of
[45:47] Eternal value and eternal quality
[45:50] how can I do such How can any man do
[45:53] such there's only one way possible that
[45:57] is if you take this vessel of humanity
[46:00] and anoint that gift that you've placed
[46:02] within me and help me to get out of the
[46:04] way and speak your heart your mind and
[46:09] your thoughts so father we're expecting
[46:12] for you to do that great thing today
[46:15] in the name of Jesus and the Saints said
[46:18] amen God bless you you may be seated
[46:23] being American citizens I'm sure that
[46:26] most of us know that we have a
[46:29] constitution
[46:30] we have of course our branches of
[46:33] government that were set up by our
[46:34] founding fathers
[46:36] they
[46:37] establish this nation on the principles
[46:41] that it would be unlike where they came
[46:44] from which was England
[46:46] for the power of the King was the final
[46:49] word
[46:50] he didn't have to have witnesses against
[46:52] you to be able to take her life if he
[46:55] wanted to kill you he could
[46:57] if they wanted to do whatever they
[46:59] wanted to do take your property
[47:00] confiscate your goods they could do that
[47:03] but when our founding fathers came here
[47:06] so many many years ago they wanted to
[47:09] establish a government they called it
[47:12] for the people and by the people it's
[47:15] too bad that our leaders today still
[47:17] don't believe the same thing
[47:20] then there was something that they
[47:22] decided to do a few years later after
[47:26] 1776 whenever they started sending it in
[47:30] motion and their great fathers gathered
[47:32] together and I put together the great
[47:35] Constitution and what they believed that
[47:38] it should be
[47:39] but as they went on with this newly
[47:42] founded government they realized that
[47:45] there were some things that needed to be
[47:47] further clarified
[47:50] so the people that are the citizens of
[47:53] this newfound democracy as they call it
[47:56] they would need certain rights they
[48:00] would need certain things that would
[48:02] protect them just in case the government
[48:06] ever got out of control again
[48:10] Smart Guys wouldn't they now they felt
[48:12] like that probably even in this thing
[48:15] called the Democracy that it was not
[48:17] perfect and of course we know that it's
[48:19] not but they wanted again to give the
[48:23] constituents of this democracy something
[48:27] that they felt like would bring the
[48:29] government down from the White House and
[48:32] Congress and Senate and all of that down
[48:35] to the individual the poor common farmer
[48:39] the poor common housewife and the you
[48:43] know the little person that was
[48:45] illiterate and that was not famous or
[48:48] important so they decide they designed
[48:52] this rather something that they would
[48:55] give to the common people as well as the
[48:58] elected officials and they called it a
[49:02] Bill of Rights a Bill of Rights I
[49:05] haven't heard of it
[49:07] how many of you know what's each one of
[49:09] your rights are
[49:12] sure
[49:13] ah we're true Americans
[49:17] now look at what that does to us
[49:19] now we're American citizens most of us
[49:22] I'm sure
[49:23] and yet we have this Bill of Rights and
[49:26] most of us probably don't even know
[49:29] what's in it
[49:31] that gives you the right to this and the
[49:33] right to that
[49:35] testing one two about my microphone
[49:39] so isn't it amazing what democracy will
[49:42] do though
[49:43] it will make you to where you're so
[49:46] trusting that you just accept whatever
[49:49] they say
[49:50] and you say it well surely they wouldn't
[49:53] do anything to me that's contrary to the
[49:56] law well let me tell you surely they
[49:59] will
[50:01] they will
[50:03] so they designed this now let me read
[50:06] this to you what the Bill of Rights
[50:07] means the Bill of Rights guarantees the
[50:10] liberty of the individual and limits the
[50:14] power of the government in judicial and
[50:17] in other proceedings the U.S Bill of
[50:21] Rights was ratified in
[50:24] 1791 and no doubt there's millions of
[50:29] Americans that have lived born died and
[50:33] all this and this nation never even knew
[50:35] what their rights were
[50:38] and some of them no doubt were
[50:41] prosecuted by the government or by other
[50:44] people
[50:45] and if they would have known their
[50:47] rights they could have stopped it in its
[50:51] tracks
[50:53] but the lawyers knew their ignorance
[50:56] and the lawyers by being able to talk to
[50:59] them knew they did not know their rights
[51:02] given to them by their own government
[51:06] so they took advantage of them
[51:08] so this bill this Bill of Rights then
[51:10] was set aside so that it would protect
[51:13] us you can see there what it is it
[51:16] guarantees among many other things the
[51:20] rights of free speech
[51:23] oh okay
[51:25] now do you honestly believe that is
[51:28] being honored in our nation
[51:31] come on now
[51:32] well it depends on what you're saying
[51:35] if you're saying what the woke
[51:37] generation wants you to say they believe
[51:39] you ought to have free speech
[51:41] until you say something contrary to them
[51:45] then they want to take your free speech
[51:47] from you but you're looking at one
[51:49] little Kentucky hillbilly that knows my
[51:52] Bill of Rights
[51:56] and not shut me up
[52:02] so by the Bill of Rights I have the
[52:05] right to the freedom of speech now a lot
[52:09] of people know this so they will not try
[52:11] to shut you down by the law but they
[52:14] will try to shut you down by pressure
[52:17] so they'll try to call your name or put
[52:20] your name in of your face in the paper
[52:21] or you know put you on TV or whatever
[52:24] and then it will cause all kinds of
[52:27] pressure on you don't you see why that
[52:29] our nation is heading straight for the
[52:32] pits of hell
[52:34] because they don't have laws to be able
[52:37] to do a lot of the things they're doing
[52:38] but they will put pressure on these
[52:41] corporations and these corporations
[52:43] don't want to be identified as you know
[52:46] somebody that don't it's not all
[52:48] inclusive on everything so they want to
[52:51] include everybody which means include
[52:53] the wrong and hate the right that's what
[52:56] inclusive means so they want to let
[52:59] everybody know where they stand and they
[53:01] will do their advertisements who in the
[53:04] world ever thought years ago that
[53:06] television would ever allow two men to
[53:08] be on their kissing whoever assault had
[53:11] ever allowed two women to be on there
[53:12] well don't get quiet on me already
[53:15] now you see brother Donnie you shouldn't
[53:17] say that oh but my Bill of Rights gives
[53:21] me the right to say that
[53:27] so I have the right of the freedom of
[53:30] speech I have the right of freedom of
[53:33] religion and you better enjoy that while
[53:36] you can because it ain't going to be
[53:38] much longer that's going to be taken
[53:40] away from us
[53:44] oh you said church will always be here
[53:46] well the church may always be but the
[53:48] bride won't be so if you want to go to
[53:51] church you better go by Going's good
[53:53] that's right
[53:54] so we have the Fright of the freedom of
[53:57] speech we have the right of religion to
[54:00] choose whatever religion that we want
[54:01] and we also just to mention the three of
[54:04] them we have a right given to us of
[54:07] trial by jury now why is that important
[54:09] see to us we don't even think that much
[54:11] about it well because them coming from
[54:13] England and coming from the European
[54:16] nations that was ruled by Kings and
[54:18] monarchs if they didn't like you they
[54:20] would be able to fabricate some some
[54:22] sources and fabricate some witnesses
[54:25] that lied against you and the King could
[54:27] pick at your property he could send you
[54:29] to jail for the rest of your life or
[54:31] basically take your life from you so the
[54:34] founding fathers wanted this to be
[54:36] inclusive in our rights as American
[54:39] citizens that we would have a right to
[54:42] trial by jury now even as good as that
[54:46] is but they have found ways around that
[54:48] to be able to bribe the people bribe
[54:52] Witnesses bribe jurors and so on but let
[54:56] me tell you something friends I'm glad
[54:57] we're serving a God today who also has
[55:01] another book of Rights
[55:04] now this one here a big portion of them
[55:07] no doubt as we go on in time little by
[55:09] little they're being taken away from us
[55:11] now any government any body of
[55:14] legislation the judicial branch the
[55:17] presidential branch that would try to
[55:19] come all outright and take all of these
[55:22] from from us they know better there's
[55:25] too many of us Americans are still on
[55:27] guns
[55:28] they know better than that so they won't
[55:31] do it outright but they'll do it little
[55:34] by little by little by little and we sit
[55:38] right here and watched them do it and we
[55:41] don't say anything and we just go ahead
[55:43] and let them do it and before long we're
[55:46] going to wake up and realize that we are
[55:49] in another Nation that's different from
[55:52] ours what is it it's become a Banana
[55:55] Republic
[55:56] well praise the Lord third world country
[56:00] that's what we're heading for well while
[56:02] our nation's heading for a third world
[56:04] country I'm heading to a third pool
[56:07] country
[56:08] amen they can have this place they can
[56:11] do whatever they want to with it
[56:13] but the Lord spoke this to me this week
[56:16] and I don't mind telling you I was just
[56:18] kind of shocked when I heard the voice
[56:20] of God say these words the bride's Bill
[56:24] of Rights it just kind of set me back a
[56:27] little bit Harry and I had to say it I
[56:29] was praying thinking meditating on the
[56:31] word and as I began to think about it
[56:33] and I started repeating what I heard the
[56:35] spirit of God say and then all this
[56:38] started coming together and I thought
[56:40] wow that's absolutely wonderful but
[56:43] unlike our government our heavenly
[56:45] father does not give us a list of our
[56:48] rights and then in time turns around and
[56:52] takes them all back away from us and
[56:55] somehow convince us that he's doing it
[56:58] for our good you see our founding
[57:00] fathers recognize that with a democracy
[57:03] it was not perfect so there was faults
[57:06] and flaws in the system and we can see
[57:08] it surely our nation being around for
[57:10] all these years now and we can see that
[57:13] there's death and flaws in democracy the
[57:15] prophet tells us it's all it's all sales
[57:17] and know when to be able to drive it but
[57:20] yet we also know there's great Liberties
[57:22] but we are so trusting now believe me
[57:25] being in China and preaching in China
[57:27] being there when brother biscoll was
[57:29] arrested and them them also looking for
[57:31] me but they thought I was a Canadian so
[57:34] brother biscoll had my itinerary in his
[57:37] briefcase and we was going in separate
[57:39] cities different directions and when
[57:41] they arrested him he took my itinerary
[57:44] Torrid into pieces and ate it a piece at
[57:48] a time to keep them from Finding Me So
[57:51] he was a Canadian they assumed I was a
[57:54] Canadian so they started searching all
[57:56] the passport entries for Donald Lee
[57:58] Reagan Jr a Canadian but they found out
[58:01] I wasn't a Canadian so they come back
[58:04] and ask him again is this man a Canadian
[58:06] so he had to tell them the truth no he's
[58:08] not a Canadian he's an American citizen
[58:10] well then they started looking for me as
[58:12] an America now be being there in China
[58:15] and watching the Chinese people how they
[58:18] would assemble and they were so leery of
[58:20] everyone they were so leery of everybody
[58:23] and as I watched it I realized that
[58:27] democracy tends to rock us to sleep and
[58:30] we're so trusting We Trust our
[58:32] government we trust lawyers We Trust
[58:35] preachers that's one of the worst butts
[58:38] you can trust I'm telling you right now
[58:41] we just trust people we're just so
[58:43] trusting and we are so gullible and so
[58:47] foolish at times because we trust
[58:49] everybody but watching the Chinese and
[58:52] how they would do for instance in one
[58:54] city whenever I was there whenever you
[58:56] would step off of the elevator a big
[58:58] hotel where we were at and hadn't rented
[59:00] a room a sweet thing there they had two
[59:02] three different rooms so we could have
[59:03] services so whenever you step off of the
[59:06] elevator there's a chair and a man
[59:08] sitting this close to you so when you
[59:11] step off the elevator it's an armed
[59:13] guard and he's stepping right there to
[59:15] look at you and he's seeing which
[59:16] direction you go you go left or to the
[59:19] right and he makes a note of which room
[59:21] you go into he notices everybody that
[59:24] comes into your room he has a time of
[59:27] everybody coming in everybody going now
[59:30] now I guarantee you one thing if we
[59:32] started noticing that by our government
[59:34] it would make us a little bit more
[59:35] suspicious would it not so the Believers
[59:38] would have to start coming about an hour
[59:40] before service and that Meander around
[59:42] and go down here and turn around and
[59:44] come back and go down there but you know
[59:46] what it didn't hinder the move of the
[59:48] Holy Ghost at all because this one lady
[59:51] come in and they had to push her in at a
[59:53] wheelchair and as I began to speak the
[59:56] word and begin to preach under the
[59:57] anointing of the Holy Ghost and pray for
[1:00:00] that woman I saw an absolute miracle
[1:00:02] from God because I saw that woman stand
[1:00:05] up which was crippled and could not walk
[1:00:08] in and whenever that woman left she
[1:00:11] pushed her wheelchair out
[1:00:13] that's the kind of God I'm talking about
[1:00:17] now you say brother Donnie you mean you
[1:00:20] believe that power is still here I know
[1:00:23] it's still here now why do I believe
[1:00:25] that because I read it to you today from
[1:00:28] your book of Rights these signs shall
[1:00:32] follow them that believe in my name they
[1:00:35] shall cast out Devils have we seen it
[1:00:37] done so that is our Bill of Rights but
[1:00:41] it's always Satan is always trying to
[1:00:44] take away from us what belongs to us now
[1:00:47] of course we know that he he controls
[1:00:49] the power of the government of every
[1:00:51] nation and that's why that our nation
[1:00:53] itself it was a good idea good principle
[1:00:56] and it lasted for a long time but it
[1:00:58] will not endure We Know by prophecy in
[1:01:02] Revelation 13 this is the chapter that
[1:01:05] the United States is found in and it was
[1:01:08] a beast that raised up that John saw not
[1:01:11] come up out of the water like the Beast
[1:01:13] of Revelation 17. or the other Beast
[1:01:16] that he saw but this Beast raised it up
[1:01:18] from among people which was and it had
[1:01:21] two tiny horns it was civil and
[1:01:24] ecclesiastical power so this Beast
[1:01:27] raised up out from among people a nation
[1:01:30] in other words and then this Beast it
[1:01:33] was given the authority to speak as the
[1:01:36] Beast before it which of course is going
[1:01:38] to become the Antichrist and the mark of
[1:01:40] the beast so the civil and
[1:01:42] ecclesiastical power representing the
[1:01:44] horns and what was that animal that John
[1:01:48] saw now remember John lived in the
[1:01:50] country near the Mediterranean so John
[1:01:52] had never seen an American Buffalo or a
[1:01:54] bison but the prophet tells us that what
[1:01:57] that Beast was was actually a buffalo so
[1:02:01] it was a bison but John didn't know what
[1:02:03] to call it so he just looks and says
[1:02:06] there was a peculiar looking beast and
[1:02:08] you can imagine him seeing a buffalo it
[1:02:10] never seen one in his life and it had
[1:02:12] short horns and represented civil and
[1:02:15] ecclesiastical power so that would come
[1:02:18] to a great power it for years would be
[1:02:20] the greatest nation on the earth and she
[1:02:23] has been is she not but little by little
[1:02:25] she's losing her power over the nation
[1:02:28] little by little the U.S dollar China
[1:02:31] right now is uniting with Russia and
[1:02:34] uniting with Iran and they're trying to
[1:02:37] make another Power one of the first
[1:02:39] things they want to do is to be able to
[1:02:41] bring the US dollar to its knees and
[1:02:44] they're trying their best right now with
[1:02:47] the Chinese currency with Aruba From
[1:02:49] Russia with the Iranian currency to
[1:02:52] bring together it's going on every day
[1:02:55] open your eyes children Where We Are and
[1:02:58] what will it do it will bring our nation
[1:03:00] to its knees you say why would God do
[1:03:03] that because God gave this nation its
[1:03:06] Liberty God gave this nation this place
[1:03:08] to worship and they started out praying
[1:03:11] and seeking God and now many of them
[1:03:13] will let you know they don't even want
[1:03:15] God in their Courthouse no more they
[1:03:18] don't want God in their schools and the
[1:03:20] truth of it is a lot of the churches
[1:03:22] don't want God in their churches no more
[1:03:24] I hope and pray we never get to that
[1:03:27] place
[1:03:30] oh my if you folks get to the place you
[1:03:33] don't want God here I ain't welcome
[1:03:34] neither and your word Jesus ain't
[1:03:37] welcome don't look for me because I
[1:03:39] won't hang around long
[1:03:41] I want you to notice of what God wanted
[1:03:44] to designate to his people and gives
[1:03:48] them a bill I can call it that a Bill of
[1:03:51] Rights now in that bill it would give
[1:03:54] them the authority to certain things
[1:03:57] what does the right do now we know we're
[1:03:59] living of course in an age when people's
[1:04:01] rights is such a big thing and they've
[1:04:04] got a right to do this and a right to do
[1:04:07] that and a right to do something else
[1:04:09] and they don't just want you and I to
[1:04:12] acknowledge their rights we want they
[1:04:14] want us to bow to their rights you think
[1:04:18] the transgender saying and all that it's
[1:04:21] just so that they can be able to get
[1:04:22] equal rights oh no they don't want no
[1:04:25] equal rights they want rights above your
[1:04:28] own they want you to bow to them and
[1:04:31] acknowledge them as being normal I'm
[1:04:35] sorry take my eyes out cut my ears off
[1:04:37] cut my tongue out that is not normal no
[1:04:42] no I don't care what you say
[1:04:46] well Glory
[1:04:48] I want you to notice now that God in
[1:04:52] order to give this Bill of Rights he
[1:04:55] himself must come now he knew that it
[1:04:58] would take many thousands of years for
[1:05:00] it to come to the spot that it would be
[1:05:03] that his people would be able to
[1:05:04] acknowledge it and have the power within
[1:05:07] them to live out the rights once they
[1:05:10] find out about it now you know how it is
[1:05:12] in our judicial system if you're a rich
[1:05:15] person and you're a rich kid then your
[1:05:17] daddy can pretty much get you out of
[1:05:19] anything you get involved in and now
[1:05:21] don't sit there and look at me funny
[1:05:23] it's the truth if you've got money money
[1:05:25] talks and you can be able to get a rich
[1:05:28] lawyer know how to pull this string and
[1:05:30] do this and that and the other and you
[1:05:31] take a lot of the poor kids if they get
[1:05:33] out and do whatever they do that's wrong
[1:05:35] they ain't got a Fighting Chance well
[1:05:38] come on now they are a minority that's
[1:05:40] right and because of that then they
[1:05:43] don't always know their rights well let
[1:05:45] me write a parallel to you in the same
[1:05:47] way that if say who can keep us from
[1:05:50] knowing our rights he will rob from us
[1:05:54] the various things the Lord Jesus paid
[1:05:57] for and gave to us
[1:05:59] is that right now because it comes by
[1:06:04] the power of God now God gives it in a
[1:06:06] divided form by that I mean God gives it
[1:06:09] to us in the written word so the written
[1:06:11] word would be the written Bill of Rights
[1:06:14] but the written Bill of Rights does not
[1:06:17] give you the power within yourself to be
[1:06:20] able to stand and claim what is yours
[1:06:23] now you can read it and memorize it in
[1:06:25] your mind and in your spirit but it
[1:06:27] takes more than just your mind and your
[1:06:30] spirit to be able to inherit your entire
[1:06:33] book so just imagine when you get saved
[1:06:36] that God gives you your own personal
[1:06:38] book of Rights and God makes a deposit
[1:06:43] by calling on you and of course drawing
[1:06:46] that seed of life which is inside of you
[1:06:49] into a spot to where it can be sparked
[1:06:52] to life back when that himself starts
[1:06:54] your journey and God then starts letting
[1:06:57] you set under Ministry Ministry that
[1:07:00] will tell you who you are what you were
[1:07:02] what you come from where you're going
[1:07:04] and what will they do they want to bring
[1:07:06] you to an understanding really in one
[1:07:09] sense of the word god called preachers
[1:07:11] are like lawyers they are men that want
[1:07:14] to Define to you you're right so you've
[1:07:16] got a right to go here you've got a
[1:07:18] right to do this and you don't have a
[1:07:20] right to do that and you don't have a
[1:07:22] right to do that you understand so God
[1:07:24] knew that it would take this on the
[1:07:26] earth to be able to help the people of
[1:07:28] God to find out who they were so God
[1:07:30] started giving man then a little bit of
[1:07:33] his rights in the Garden of Eden and he
[1:07:36] gave to Adam and Eve the opening we see
[1:07:39] the first glimpse into the book of
[1:07:42] Rights or the the Bill of Rights
[1:07:44] whenever a man was placed in the Garden
[1:07:47] of Eden and though that man was placed
[1:07:50] on a probationary period to see what
[1:07:53] would he do what would he do was what
[1:07:56] God gave him how would he treat this
[1:07:58] book how would he be able to evalue it
[1:08:01] in his own eyes in comparison to other
[1:08:04] things and as we know Adam didn't do
[1:08:06] very well with him so Adam chose his
[1:08:09] wife over the book of Rights and the
[1:08:12] Bill of Rights so then what he did he
[1:08:15] forfeited eternal life so God then in
[1:08:18] turn has to come back and God makes the
[1:08:21] man and the woman leave the garden of
[1:08:22] Edom but God gives them a promise I will
[1:08:25] restore you I I will bring you back back
[1:08:29] to what just a beautiful place just a
[1:08:32] place for this nice big beautiful trees
[1:08:34] and all the animals are tamed there is
[1:08:36] that all God wants us to have no there's
[1:08:39] more than that God wants to bring us
[1:08:41] back to a spot to where the Earth will
[1:08:45] never again ever hear the Rumble of
[1:08:48] Thunder that the Earth will never be
[1:08:51] able to bury one child there'll never be
[1:08:54] one person there that will ever die oh
[1:08:57] what a lamb there'll never be one there
[1:08:59] that will ever cry or sadness or sorrow
[1:09:02] will ever strike their heart but it all
[1:09:05] must be brought back under the law of
[1:09:08] reconciliation so God must reconcile
[1:09:11] this human race back to himself so how
[1:09:14] does he do it well of course God has a
[1:09:16] Judicial Court and God has an appellate
[1:09:19] court and God has lawyers and God has
[1:09:23] representatives and then God also has an
[1:09:26] end which is of course the attorney for
[1:09:30] the other side and that attorney from
[1:09:33] the other side knows his rights as a
[1:09:35] matter of fact he knows not only his but
[1:09:37] he knows yours I'd say probably knows
[1:09:40] ours a lot better than a lot of us know
[1:09:42] ours
[1:09:43] so he knows exactly how far he can go
[1:09:46] but he also knows that it's not just the
[1:09:49] law itself that will keep him from
[1:09:51] taking things from you but it will be
[1:09:54] your inability to withstand him and if
[1:09:58] you thinking well I ain't worthy and I
[1:10:01] ain't good enough I can never be good up
[1:10:03] well see right there you yourself are
[1:10:06] denying your Bill of Rights this Bill of
[1:10:10] Rights is not given to us based on our
[1:10:12] worthiness it's given to us because he
[1:10:16] wanted us to have it
[1:10:19] well if he wants me to have it I reckon
[1:10:21] I should have it anybody else feel the
[1:10:23] same way my goodness I could wait the
[1:10:25] rest of my life and never be worthy I
[1:10:28] could rate the rest of my life and so
[1:10:29] could you I never be of a character that
[1:10:33] well okay now I'm ready now I'm good
[1:10:35] enough now you know what knowing me if I
[1:10:37] did all that I'd get it in the next day
[1:10:38] I'd Die
[1:10:39] Subway said all my life wait you get
[1:10:42] good enough then I get good enough and I
[1:10:43] get the book and I'm sold I can't even
[1:10:45] read it no more what good does that do
[1:10:47] why not get it now and let the Holy
[1:10:50] Ghost inside of you help you to live
[1:10:53] better and do better and walk closer to
[1:10:56] God as you're growing while you're
[1:10:58] feeding on your Bill of Rights
[1:11:02] now since item forfeited life father
[1:11:05] must bring life back into the picture so
[1:11:09] no matter how many good things that we
[1:11:11] would have we could be the richest
[1:11:13] person on the earth we could own houses
[1:11:16] and lands and great possessions and be
[1:11:19] the CEO of all types of different things
[1:11:21] but really when it comes down to it what
[1:11:23] good is any of that if you don't have
[1:11:25] life you ever seen a CEO with all of his
[1:11:27] stocks and bonds and he's in his casket
[1:11:29] there well if you did they wouldn't wait
[1:11:31] there long everybody coming in will grab
[1:11:33] a hold of one and say God bless his
[1:11:34] heart hallelujah thank you Jesus well
[1:11:37] glory to God the Lord blessed me I went
[1:11:39] to that funeral Hallelujah I found me a
[1:11:41] couple of stocks you Thief
[1:11:44] so what good does all that do if you
[1:11:47] don't have life so God wanted to restore
[1:11:50] man to lie of course God sent the
[1:11:53] prophets they could never be able to
[1:11:55] bring life God sent the judicial system
[1:11:58] of the Old Testament which was the
[1:12:00] levitical law that could never bring
[1:12:02] life God gave the Ten Commandments could
[1:12:04] never bring life so God himself then the
[1:12:07] person of Life must come to the Earth in
[1:12:11] a form that could be a shareable form
[1:12:14] now listen to me that God must get his
[1:12:18] life back into the lives of individuals
[1:12:21] so how could he ever do that since God
[1:12:23] is eternal life and God can never die so
[1:12:26] God must come to the Earth in a form
[1:12:29] which can be assimilated now in other
[1:12:32] words God would change himself from the
[1:12:35] great Eternal that he was and come to
[1:12:38] the Earth in a human form called sonship
[1:12:41] and God would get inside that human
[1:12:44] sonship body and make that body where it
[1:12:47] would be able to be broken open for
[1:12:50] others and they would come to him and
[1:12:53] receive that life now notice it like
[1:12:55] this so here God comes to the Earth and
[1:12:58] second Corinthians 5 17 says God was in
[1:13:02] Christ
[1:13:04] reconciling the world to himself so here
[1:13:08] is Christ the body The Vessel the bottle
[1:13:12] if you will but I'm not interested in
[1:13:15] drinking the bottle I don't need the
[1:13:18] bottle I need what's in this bottle to
[1:13:22] be able to help me because I'm already
[1:13:23] sweating sweating running down my back
[1:13:25] running down my face running down my
[1:13:28] legs so I need something that will help
[1:13:31] replenish me as I start sweating you
[1:13:34] agree with me so is it okay with you all
[1:13:37] if I take a little bit of refreshment is
[1:13:41] it okay with you if I get a little bit
[1:13:45] of what I need and I take that into me
[1:13:48] now this is separate from me it's not me
[1:13:51] as you know this is purple and I'm not
[1:13:53] purple this is potassium and this and
[1:13:56] that and the other and I have some of
[1:13:58] those things in me but they are getting
[1:14:00] depleted they're coming out of me as I'm
[1:14:03] standing here under the anointing so
[1:14:06] what I need is a little bit of help
[1:14:10] so God was in Christ
[1:14:15] reconciling the world now what I'm
[1:14:17] fixing to do is turn up the power of God
[1:14:31] and I just swallowed God
[1:14:37] now God was in the bottle
[1:14:41] but God cannot die so God had to open
[1:14:45] the bottle when the lid was broke or the
[1:14:49] seal was broke and then on the cross
[1:14:52] when he gave his wife to be a
[1:14:55] perpetuation for us how many he says
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] he made a way then that we could drink
[1:15:01] him in
[1:15:03] praise the Lord
[1:15:05] and then he would start rushing through
[1:15:08] us as all of this is doing to me right
[1:15:11] now and it won't be long to where this
[1:15:14] will no longer be Gatorade but it will
[1:15:17] actually go into me and become me and I
[1:15:22] will become it
[1:15:24] so then I started the power of
[1:15:29] assimilation when I started to drink
[1:15:31] this so by drinking this I took it into
[1:15:33] my body now if that would have been dirt
[1:15:36] inside of there if there would have been
[1:15:38] Nails oh that would have been all kinds
[1:15:41] of other things you say I could not get
[1:15:43] any benefit out of that this is why
[1:15:46] friends that we must not come to just
[1:15:48] doctrines we must not just come to a
[1:15:51] knowledge of the word we must come to a
[1:15:53] spot of something that's compatible with
[1:15:56] us which is what life so God so loved
[1:16:00] the world that he gave us on the
[1:16:01] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:16:03] him should not perish but have
[1:16:06] everlasting life for God said not his
[1:16:08] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:16:10] but that the world through him might be
[1:16:15] saved
[1:16:17] then we start to assimilate by his great
[1:16:21] power the nature that was in the bottle
[1:16:24] so what was in the bottle Jesus Christ
[1:16:27] it was Mercy it was forgiveness it was
[1:16:30] love it was all of those great things
[1:16:33] that was in because God made himself in
[1:16:36] a transmissible form a form which could
[1:16:40] be received by a human being and it
[1:16:43] would start immediately changing their
[1:16:46] lives
[1:16:47] now when you receive him do you become
[1:16:50] perfect then absolutely not you keep on
[1:16:53] assimilating as you feed upon his word
[1:16:56] so God then must bring life back to man
[1:17:00] read with me if you were in Revelation
[1:17:02] chapter 22 verse 14. I want you to
[1:17:06] notice how John here writing down the
[1:17:09] words that was given to him on the Isle
[1:17:11] of Patmos blessed are they that do his
[1:17:15] Commandments that they may have
[1:17:18] ah
[1:17:21] so this is in your Bill of Rights then
[1:17:24] blessed are they that do his
[1:17:27] Commandments that they may have
[1:17:31] right exclusion look at the word
[1:17:34] Authority right
[1:17:37] jurisdiction the ability or strength
[1:17:41] with which one is endued one who
[1:17:46] possesses
[1:17:48] Authority the sign of Regal Authority
[1:17:54] so there is a right to the tree of life
[1:17:57] now wait a minute isn't that what was in
[1:18:00] the Garden of Eden and God said lest the
[1:18:03] man should put forth his hand and take
[1:18:05] of the tree of life and God set faming
[1:18:07] cherubims at the entrance to the gate of
[1:18:10] the Garden of Eden and said man cannot
[1:18:12] come back in here until I have made
[1:18:16] myself into a form by which man can
[1:18:21] assimilate me into him
[1:18:24] and I will come into the man and as he
[1:18:29] drinks me and partakes of me I will
[1:18:33] change him from the inside out
[1:18:36] oh praise the Lord
[1:18:39] so notice John is the only one in the
[1:18:42] New Testament as far as the writers that
[1:18:44] actually mentions this this way that a
[1:18:47] person may have a right to the tree of
[1:18:50] life now this is my right if I obey
[1:18:53] God's word I'm called by him I have a
[1:18:57] right to the Tree of Life there is no
[1:18:59] Devils there is no church there is
[1:19:02] nobody that's going to keep me from my
[1:19:05] right to the Tree of Life
[1:19:12] now notice in Paradise When we arrive
[1:19:16] there the Bible tells us that those
[1:19:19] leaves on the trees will change every so
[1:19:23] often so every month every 30-day cycle
[1:19:27] period they will change and what was
[1:19:29] that it was supposed to do partaking
[1:19:32] from the trees in the Garden of Eden
[1:19:34] this is one thing that warded off old
[1:19:37] age he would never age so as we are
[1:19:41] eating off the tree of life our use is
[1:19:45] constantly renewed
[1:19:47] amen it's the same way with the word of
[1:19:50] God that's why whether you're 15 or 75
[1:19:53] you can have Revival when everybody
[1:19:55] else's drying up blowing away why you're
[1:19:58] renewing your use in Christ Jesus amen
[1:20:02] the glory Never Dies now watch this
[1:20:05] again in Saint John 1 1 again the same
[1:20:07] writer just phrases things a little
[1:20:09] different he came into his own on his
[1:20:12] own received him not but as many as
[1:20:17] received him
[1:20:19] to them gave he power look at this word
[1:20:24] again excuse you so he came to his own
[1:20:27] his own received him not but to as many
[1:20:30] eyes drunk him in
[1:20:33] as many as received him to them gave he
[1:20:38] power not only to shout not only to be
[1:20:42] healed but to become the sons of God
[1:20:48] so he gives us a jurisdiction once we
[1:20:53] receive his life to become sons of God
[1:20:56] well let me just tell you right now if
[1:20:58] you ever become one you'll never become
[1:21:00] anything else
[1:21:02] whoa
[1:21:05] oh that
[1:21:10] I believe if you ever get into Jesus
[1:21:12] Christ and seal there by the Holy Ghost
[1:21:15] you'll never get out for him
[1:21:23] now notice John he said but as many eyes
[1:21:25] received him to them gave he excuse you
[1:21:29] again Authority right jurisdiction to
[1:21:32] become oh what a word what a word
[1:21:37] to become look at the meaning of it
[1:21:40] come to pass
[1:21:43] do you understand every son and daughter
[1:21:46] of God
[1:21:47] is a word from God laying in the annals
[1:21:52] of history and it takes the spirit of
[1:21:56] God to Quicken them and bring them to
[1:21:59] pass
[1:22:00] don't you understand why we are students
[1:22:03] of Prophecy and we believe prophecy do
[1:22:05] we not so a word may lay in the Bible
[1:22:08] for thousands of years that don't change
[1:22:10] nothing to us that does not mean it's
[1:22:13] not real it does not mean it's not
[1:22:15] genuine but what we know is that word
[1:22:17] has just not yet come to pass so every
[1:22:21] son and daughter that comes to God and
[1:22:25] enters into that great channel of his
[1:22:27] thinking and of his love God gives them
[1:22:30] the power to come to pass
[1:22:34] what are they a prophecy if you will and
[1:22:38] the prophecy was their name was written
[1:22:41] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:22:44] foundation of the world before there is
[1:22:47] ever a devil he spoke your name but for
[1:22:50] that's ever in his sickness he spoke
[1:22:52] your name and he spoke your name as a
[1:22:56] prophecy and there's only one way for
[1:22:59] you to come to pass the same God who
[1:23:02] spoke it has to Quicken the word
[1:23:04] first hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:23:06] Isaiah 7 14 late in the school a virgin
[1:23:10] shall conceive and bring forth a son
[1:23:13] Thou shalt called his name Emmanuel you
[1:23:15] know the scripture very well it lay
[1:23:17] there for years and years 712 years but
[1:23:21] one day the spirit of God fell on that
[1:23:23] word and that virgin was walking down
[1:23:25] the street to a well and an angel of God
[1:23:28] met her what was God fixing to do help
[1:23:30] Mary come to pass
[1:23:33] don't you understand this is our time
[1:23:35] friends this is our day be encouraged
[1:23:39] today there's not enough powers of
[1:23:41] Darkness to stop this Pride from coming
[1:23:44] to pass
[1:23:47] Oh Glory to God
[1:23:49] notice so John says but as many as
[1:23:52] received him notice he doesn't say his
[1:23:55] ideology
[1:23:57] his his opinion
[1:23:59] don't receive doctrines but you receive
[1:24:02] him who is him the person of the word so
[1:24:06] as many I'm not talking about a Christ
[1:24:08] of a denominational view I'm talking
[1:24:11] about him
[1:24:12] not a third person the person
[1:24:15] amen as many as received him to them
[1:24:20] gave he
[1:24:22] gave he power exclusive Authority right
[1:24:28] jurisdiction
[1:24:30] to come to pass
[1:24:34] let me just tell you this morning you're
[1:24:35] looking at a Son of God that's coming to
[1:24:38] pass
[1:24:43] I believe I'm looking at Sons and
[1:24:45] Daughters of God that's coming to pass
[1:24:47] I've been coming to pass for a long time
[1:24:50] as a matter of fact I don't mind tell
[1:24:52] you I'm pretty glad today that I've been
[1:24:54] serving the lord Jesus since I was a 12
[1:24:57] year old boy Lord willing in a couple of
[1:24:59] months Carol and I've been married 50
[1:25:00] years and we'll turn 67. I don't mind
[1:25:03] telling you I am so happy I've been
[1:25:06] coming to pass since a 12 year old boy
[1:25:08] and I still ain't stopped coming to pass
[1:25:11] I'm still coming to pass well everybody
[1:25:14] here with me today you don't want to
[1:25:16] stop you don't want to get to a spot
[1:25:18] well I'm in I guess that's all they need
[1:25:20] oh no we want to keep on coming to pass
[1:25:23] word by word by word by word until we
[1:25:27] fulfill our position of what God wants
[1:25:31] us to be
[1:25:35] oh
[1:25:36] thank God
[1:25:38] notice the meaning of this word again it
[1:25:41] goes on to express it
[1:25:43] come to pass be done be fulfilled
[1:25:49] notice verse 13 this is really hard on
[1:25:52] some folks
[1:25:54] which were born
[1:25:56] not of blood
[1:25:58] nor of the will of the flesh
[1:26:03] now if you're a free real Baptist here
[1:26:04] today God bless you whoever you are but
[1:26:07] John John wasn't Free Will Baptist
[1:26:09] John believed God's will overrode free
[1:26:11] will
[1:26:12] according to your Bible here you did not
[1:26:15] become a child of God based on your will
[1:26:17] now this is your Bible
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:20] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:26:24] will again fella Mia the Greek word here
[1:26:27] the will of the flesh desire what one
[1:26:31] wishes or has determined shall be done
[1:26:34] which is the way the majority of
[1:26:36] Christendom preaches the new verse
[1:26:39] absolutely contrary to the scripture
[1:26:43] well Hallelujah
[1:26:46] hallelujah oh glory to God I'll tell you
[1:26:50] one thing I wanted to discard God I got
[1:26:53] out of town I wanted to live for him I
[1:26:55] went up and I grabbed a hold of the
[1:26:57] horns of the altar oh no he grabbed the
[1:26:59] hold of your horns and throat your
[1:27:02] cigarettes out and your alcohol out of
[1:27:04] that whole filthy life that you was
[1:27:06] living and he'd rub you up to the altar
[1:27:10] come on somebody amen it wasn't you you
[1:27:14] love sucking on cigarette you love
[1:27:16] living the way you live but the Lord
[1:27:18] Jesus got a hold to you and said come on
[1:27:21] son it's your time to come to pass it's
[1:27:26] your time to be fulfilled
[1:27:33] which were born not of blood
[1:27:36] nor of the will of the flesh
[1:27:39] nor of the will of man
[1:27:43] and where's that great big thing you've
[1:27:45] done
[1:27:48] but of
[1:27:50] God
[1:27:54] I'm so glad my salvation ain't based on
[1:27:57] my will
[1:27:59] I'm so glad your salvation ain't based
[1:28:02] on yours because there ain't no doubt in
[1:28:04] my mind a lot of you've done made up
[1:28:05] your mind I ain't serving him no more
[1:28:06] I'm quitting on this that another but
[1:28:08] whenever you made up your mind to leave
[1:28:10] he wouldn't let you go whenever you made
[1:28:13] up your mind I ain't going back to
[1:28:14] church no more I said oh yes you already
[1:28:15] get ready you're going to the house to
[1:28:17] start it's all I'm a little I said oh
[1:28:19] yes you are oh Jeremiah said I made up
[1:28:22] my mind I wasn't going to speak no more
[1:28:24] in the name of the Lord but Jeremiah
[1:28:26] said it was like a fire burning inside
[1:28:28] of my phone
[1:28:32] salvation is bigger than you salvation
[1:28:35] is bigger than me it's not my will it's
[1:28:38] not your will it's his
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:49] so my Bill of Rights
[1:28:52] says I have the right
[1:28:55] to be born of God
[1:29:02] now once I'm in
[1:29:04] now it opens up the whole new door
[1:29:08] of what's mine once I get in
[1:29:11] foreign
[1:29:12] Hebrews 13 9. be not carried away about
[1:29:17] with divers and strange doctrines
[1:29:22] for it is good a good thing that the
[1:29:25] heart be established with Grace
[1:29:27] not with Meats which have not profited
[1:29:30] to them that have occupied there and I
[1:29:33] remember he's writing to the Jews and
[1:29:34] they're still struggling about meats and
[1:29:36] what's clean and unclean
[1:29:38] now watch Paul as he says we have an
[1:29:42] altar
[1:29:44] whereof they
[1:29:47] have no right
[1:29:49] to eat
[1:29:51] which serve
[1:29:52] the Tabernacle
[1:29:55] now he's running the contrast between
[1:29:57] the levitical order
[1:30:00] and the title of this book is Hebrews so
[1:30:03] that's who it's written to Jews
[1:30:06] and they're trying to merge the Mosaic
[1:30:09] law in to Christianity remember Paul
[1:30:13] didn't without the book of Galatians and
[1:30:15] he said them guys come through and they
[1:30:17] was projecting this false Doctrine in
[1:30:19] the churches that Paul established these
[1:30:21] false teachers got it and I'm telling
[1:30:23] them you've got to be circumcised and
[1:30:25] you can't do this and you can't do that
[1:30:26] you you go you got to have the law of
[1:30:28] Moses or you're not even saved Paul said
[1:30:30] what in the world's happened to you and
[1:30:33] they even turned them people against
[1:30:35] Paul
[1:30:37] can you imagine the people sitting there
[1:30:40] in the galatian church and some of these
[1:30:42] false teachers turned the very man that
[1:30:46] verse them under the word of God and
[1:30:50] they let a false teacher turn them
[1:30:52] against him
[1:30:54] oh my goodness
[1:30:56] now your Paul is showing them look you
[1:30:59] all are trying to emphasize the
[1:31:01] levitical order and the Mosaic law I'm a
[1:31:05] Torah and all of that and he said
[1:31:07] whenever we are baptized into the body
[1:31:11] we have an altar that you have no right
[1:31:15] to eat at
[1:31:17] anybody know what that means
[1:31:23] you see one the the Levites
[1:31:26] and the priest would receive the wave
[1:31:30] offering the heave offering God would
[1:31:33] say take this certain thing take the
[1:31:36] shoulder we'll say the shoulder of a
[1:31:38] sheep and the shoulder the ham of a real
[1:31:41] now I want you to only offer so much of
[1:31:44] that to me
[1:31:46] but then I want you to give the rest of
[1:31:48] that shoulder to the priest the Levites
[1:31:53] so they were considered that their their
[1:31:57] sustenance their natural sustenance that
[1:32:00] they were eating and fellowshipping was
[1:32:04] God
[1:32:05] from the same sacrifice
[1:32:12] why they would get a portion of God's
[1:32:16] offering
[1:32:18] wow
[1:32:19] that's your opponent saying you all want
[1:32:21] to push the law you want to push the
[1:32:24] levitical order he said well let me just
[1:32:26] tell you right now that once we are
[1:32:29] baptized into the body of Christ
[1:32:32] we are eating from another altar I
[1:32:35] didn't say there wasn't eating he just
[1:32:37] said we're eating from another Altar and
[1:32:40] the sacrifice on that altar is not
[1:32:42] around a turtle dove or a pigeon it was
[1:32:45] God himself made flesh and a human body
[1:32:49] oh Lord Jesus notice again Paul uses the
[1:32:53] same word excuse you we have an altar
[1:32:56] word of they have no right
[1:33:00] to eat which serve the talent
[1:33:05] so if you're still trying to serve God
[1:33:07] by do's and don'ts and this and that and
[1:33:09] the other oh yes there's do's and don'ts
[1:33:11] in the economy of God but we don't come
[1:33:13] to God by fulfilling do's and don'ts
[1:33:15] first we get saved then we do the deuce
[1:33:17] and we stop doing the don'ts
[1:33:23] a part of the sacrifice
[1:33:26] was given for them to eat and they
[1:33:31] partook of the sacrifice and it was
[1:33:34] their daily sustenance
[1:33:39] what in the world are you talking about
[1:33:45] I'm saying we have a right
[1:33:49] every day
[1:33:51] to eat the unfailing body word
[1:33:56] of the son of man
[1:33:59] you see many folks stop what's a Paschal
[1:34:02] sacrifice at the cross they never go any
[1:34:05] farther oh well yeah Jesus died for me
[1:34:08] Jesus thou all praise the Lord he died
[1:34:09] for me all those always died for me he
[1:34:11] died for me that's right
[1:34:13] but we are in order not after levitical
[1:34:17] order but the order from El Quezada
[1:34:20] and what did the priesthood do they did
[1:34:22] not stop and say okay well we brought
[1:34:24] that one off and we'll just stop they
[1:34:26] brought it day by day by day by day what
[1:34:30] does God want it to be with me and you
[1:34:31] well he saved me well that's good but
[1:34:34] are you eating of what he is and who he
[1:34:37] is and the character of his word well no
[1:34:42] come on eating of what he is good so you
[1:34:45] need all the cross meant to you
[1:34:48] is it just initially liberated you from
[1:34:50] your sin
[1:34:52] but you see to a real believer the cross
[1:34:55] becomes an altar
[1:34:59] and that we are baptized into the body
[1:35:02] by the Holy Ghost and as we are setting
[1:35:04] though we're feeding into our souls the
[1:35:07] revealing of the son of man which is the
[1:35:09] message of the hour Christ Jesus
[1:35:14] this is why we will eat ourselves to a
[1:35:16] body change
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:25] you see those who just acknowledge Him
[1:35:27] being on on the cross
[1:35:29] that's as far as they ever go
[1:35:31] but God in every age updated
[1:35:34] updated the church so they'd be able to
[1:35:37] catch the word for the day they lived
[1:35:40] that's why Luther caused some Revival
[1:35:41] Luther sat down at the table the Christ
[1:35:44] opened the book of Romans and he come
[1:35:46] out and said that Josh shall live by
[1:35:47] faith what Luther had he bit into a
[1:35:50] great big Lamb Chop
[1:35:55] Luther sunk his teeth down to that
[1:35:57] reveal word of the Earth come out there
[1:35:59] like a wild man say glory to God I'm
[1:36:01] free glory to God I'm free I don't have
[1:36:04] to do Penance no more I don't have to
[1:36:06] pray to Mary no more I don't like to
[1:36:08] pray to Joseph no more and that Lamb
[1:36:11] Chop was still sticking out between his
[1:36:12] teeth and the devil said good Lord what
[1:36:14] in the world is that so
[1:36:19] loser found his place
[1:36:22] at the altar
[1:36:24] if you're sitting here today and your
[1:36:26] son or daughter of God or you're
[1:36:27] streaming this service and your name is
[1:36:28] on the Book of Life not only is your
[1:36:30] name in The Book of Life but your name
[1:36:32] is on the table
[1:36:35] now I perform weddings in different
[1:36:37] parts in the United States
[1:36:39] and assisted in some different countries
[1:36:42] and it's being the minister or a singer
[1:36:46] or someone that will pray over them
[1:36:48] they want to give you a place of honor
[1:36:51] so that's enough you said over here and
[1:36:54] you said over here
[1:36:55] well how am I going to know where I'm
[1:36:56] going to say it brother Donnie your name
[1:37:00] will be near your seat right
[1:37:02] so you and sister Carol will set on so
[1:37:04] and so we had your name place that so I
[1:37:09] know when I woke up and I look at that
[1:37:12] brother Donnie Reagan now there might be
[1:37:14] other brother Donnie Reagan's in the
[1:37:16] world but that other brother Donnie
[1:37:19] Reagan didn't officiate in that wedding
[1:37:21] so I was known by my works and my
[1:37:26] identity with this family so I figure my
[1:37:30] name is Donnie Reagan that paper says
[1:37:32] Donnie Reagan so don't you try to get my
[1:37:34] seat because that ain't your name so if
[1:37:37] you can identify yourself with the
[1:37:40] family of God that you are a new
[1:37:42] creation Changed by the power of God and
[1:37:46] you can find your name you've got a
[1:37:49] right to sit down brother sit down
[1:37:52] sisters and feed on the unfainted word
[1:37:56] of the son of man
[1:38:03] United ones at the end time
[1:38:06] the son of man
[1:38:08] is Christ
[1:38:11] he's the one you're feeding on right
[1:38:14] you're not feeding on a man that don't
[1:38:16] speak about everybody because that's
[1:38:17] what a lot of folks are feeding on
[1:38:19] that's why they can only receive from
[1:38:21] one preacher and the fat one preacher
[1:38:23] ain't preaching well I didn't get
[1:38:24] nothing out of service I say shame on
[1:38:26] you you go to church in the right
[1:38:28] attitude I believe you'll get something
[1:38:30] no matter who's preaching
[1:38:35] notice the son of man is Christ he's the
[1:38:38] one you're feeding on you're not feeding
[1:38:40] on a man a man his words will fail but
[1:38:44] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:38:46] word of the son of man
[1:38:50] so it's your rights so you say well I
[1:38:52] try to read the Bible and I don't get
[1:38:53] nothing out of it ah
[1:38:55] don't you see what that Devil's doing
[1:38:58] you realize one of the best sleeping
[1:39:00] pills you'll ever get in your life

[1:41:00] let them hinder me I'm going to pull my
[1:41:03] feet under his table I'm gonna see on
[1:41:07] that unfailing body word it's my ride
[1:41:23] we ain't gonna have time to get into
[1:41:25] this but I'm going to get into it a
[1:41:27] little bit
[1:41:29] another one of my rights and yours
[1:41:34] wake up devil here we come
[1:41:37] is to be like
[1:41:40] the original Church
[1:41:51] those from the church age book an
[1:41:54] unchanging God with unchanging ways what
[1:41:56] he did at the first he will have to keep
[1:41:59] on doing until it is done for the last
[1:42:04] time there will never be a change and
[1:42:10] the church said
[1:42:11] [Applause]
[1:42:13] apply that to the church ages the kind
[1:42:15] of man that God chose for the first
[1:42:17] church age and how God manifested in
[1:42:20] that man's Ministry would be the example
[1:42:22] for all other agents what God did in the
[1:42:25] first church age is what he wants to do
[1:42:28] in
[1:42:30] what
[1:42:33] so this is our
[1:42:39] old people say well poor brother Donnie
[1:42:42] he's Pentecostal thank you for that
[1:42:45] compliment
[1:42:45] [Applause]
[1:42:48] I am absolutely
[1:42:51] oh not 1906 but original Acts 2.
[1:42:56] I'll tell what I want around here I want
[1:42:58] to have the kind of church around here
[1:42:59] that if Peter wants to walk in them
[1:43:01] middle doors right there he'd come down
[1:43:02] the middle of screaming holler and
[1:43:04] shouting glory to God that's the same
[1:43:06] way the kind of church we had on the day
[1:43:07] of Pentecost Paul would come right down
[1:43:09] through that door Thomas would come
[1:43:11] right down through that door and James
[1:43:13] and all the rest of the Apostles say
[1:43:15] glory to God Brothers looked at this we
[1:43:16] didn't have this nice of carpet and we
[1:43:18] sure didn't have these lights and all
[1:43:20] these fancy things on the wall but boy
[1:43:22] we had the same Holy Ghost we have the
[1:43:24] same power except the captain free
[1:43:26] Healing The Sick race of the Dead
[1:43:28] casting out devil why do we want it
[1:43:31] brother Jonathan it's all right
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:38] thank you
[1:43:42] what God did in the first church age is
[1:43:44] what he wants to do in all other eggs
[1:43:46] the thing of it is
[1:43:47] do we want what he wants
[1:43:53] now we know exactly from the word which
[1:43:55] was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the
[1:43:57] first or the original church is founded
[1:44:00] and how God manifested himself and heard
[1:44:02] the word can't change
[1:44:04] or be changed because the word of God oh
[1:44:08] notices then that church is at Pentecost
[1:44:11] is the standard
[1:44:14] thank you
[1:44:21] what the church was at Pentecost is the
[1:44:24] standard that is the pattern
[1:44:32] now my wife
[1:44:34] is an expert seamstress
[1:44:36] she sowed since she was a little girl
[1:44:40] how was it when your grandma would touch
[1:44:41] you
[1:44:43] four three
[1:44:45] years old
[1:44:46] setting her Grandma's lap and her
[1:44:49] grandma would use that old sewing
[1:44:50] machine hell has ever seen one of them
[1:44:52] I've done some young people don't want
[1:44:53] me to talk about it well that's the old
[1:44:55] travel top where you sit there and pump
[1:44:57] it with your feet and her grandma would
[1:44:59] hold her in her lap while she sewed and
[1:45:01] taught her how to sew she's made
[1:45:03] absolutely beautiful things
[1:45:05] of course cannot so
[1:45:08] but what I have done is helped her place
[1:45:12] the pattern
[1:45:14] on top of the material
[1:45:18] so depending on what she's making
[1:45:21] so when she started doing this curtain
[1:45:23] sharing done many things that are really
[1:45:26] really big and large as she did over
[1:45:28] here in the fellowship hall
[1:45:30] that was too big for her to hold
[1:45:33] so I was a good little helper
[1:45:37] but she wouldn't want to see anything I
[1:45:38] ever sowed that's for sure
[1:45:40] but I know enough about patterns to know
[1:45:43] that the pattern comes in a little piece
[1:45:46] of paper a box or whatever it is and
[1:45:48] then they make that pattern of several
[1:45:51] Sciences depending on if it's a dress or
[1:45:53] whatever more so it may range from 4 to
[1:45:56] 12 or 6 to 12. so you have to pick out
[1:45:58] your size or the age you're living in
[1:46:02] Glory what's ours is size seven of
[1:46:06] course
[1:46:06] amen and then you lay that pattern upon
[1:46:11] the fabric now Carol's been doing it
[1:46:13] long enough for a lot of times she can
[1:46:15] just hold her hand or she'll tell me to
[1:46:17] put my hand on top of it she don't even
[1:46:19] pin it and she'll take the scissors and
[1:46:21] just cut right around now she might use
[1:46:23] the same pattern over and over again
[1:46:27] because she don't need to make a new
[1:46:30] pattern to make the same dress
[1:46:33] so the Lord God didn't need to make a
[1:46:36] new pattern to make the same church that
[1:46:39] he had in Acts 2.
[1:46:43] oh Wally all he had to do was drag out
[1:46:48] the Bill of Rights and bursts of people
[1:46:51] by the Holy Ghost opened their eyes and
[1:46:55] they would say my lord it's the same
[1:46:57] size it will do the same thing that acts
[1:47:01] the same way why Hebrews 13 8.
[1:47:10] so the Lord God laid out a pattern right
[1:47:19] and he gave the goods to the apostles
[1:47:21] and preacher said now
[1:47:23] sow it together for me
[1:47:28] of course Satan looked at that pattern
[1:47:30] it scared him to death
[1:47:32] he thought he had got rid of that one
[1:47:33] and only Jesus
[1:47:35] now it looks like it's a multiplied form
[1:47:44] they live like him they talk like him
[1:47:45] they died like him and they're raised
[1:47:48] from the dead like him
[1:47:49] [Applause]
[1:47:51] Satan thought I've got to do something I
[1:47:53] got it or something
[1:47:55] changes this is awful this is awful
[1:47:59] so what'd he do he started sending
[1:48:02] people in among them
[1:48:03] he tried to defeat him from was out and
[1:48:05] found out that didn't work so he started
[1:48:07] setting people in among them and set
[1:48:09] them down the prophet said that
[1:48:11] Nickelodeon Spirit started crying out we
[1:48:14] don't need any more of that shouting now
[1:48:16] tell you one thing we don't need none of
[1:48:18] that hand clapping stuff
[1:48:20] some rich folks got saved maybe some of
[1:48:24] the Nobles and the ups and ups and the
[1:48:26] outs and outs and whatever more they got
[1:48:27] saved and you imagine them coming in and
[1:48:29] said no no no no no
[1:48:32] I like that preacher protect music Lord
[1:48:35] have mercy I like that preacher if
[1:48:37] you've ever been to church in your life
[1:48:39] or you've seen so many people jumping
[1:48:40] and running and screaming in your life
[1:48:42] well maybe you need to change patterns
[1:48:44] and get in the original Acts 2 pattern
[1:48:45] you'll find that's the way they done it
[1:48:54] so in every age he's done exactly the
[1:48:56] same thing
[1:48:58] try to pull the people away from the
[1:49:00] promised word of that age
[1:49:03] then they will alter
[1:49:05] what the product looks like
[1:49:09] this little handkerchief right here
[1:49:11] Carol and I used to work at a sewing
[1:49:13] Factory years and years and years and
[1:49:15] years ago
[1:49:17] Carol worked in the sewing Department I
[1:49:18] worked in the shipping Department as far
[1:49:20] as I started preaching full-time
[1:49:22] I would watch them guys because the
[1:49:24] shipping Department was right next door
[1:49:26] to the guys the receiving department
[1:49:29] so they would receive these rolls of
[1:49:31] fabric they would come from all over the
[1:49:33] country
[1:49:34] and they would take them rolls and run
[1:49:36] them back and forth and back and forth
[1:49:38] and add tables as long as from here to
[1:49:40] the back of the church and that have a
[1:49:42] man on either side of them Rose and
[1:49:44] they'd take this machine probably got
[1:49:45] more automated now but they'd run back
[1:49:47] and forth and layer that fabric and
[1:49:50] sometimes them layers they had a knife
[1:49:52] that had a knife blade that long I'm not
[1:49:54] exaggerating and then they would take
[1:49:56] after that to run the right to run
[1:49:58] that's right according to the Mount of
[1:49:59] desert that they wanted to make and then
[1:50:02] they would take this gigantic pattern
[1:50:04] and they would put it together and lay
[1:50:06] it over then there would be guys in
[1:50:07] there with these knives and they would
[1:50:09] go through cutting through this this
[1:50:11] high and that goes through cutting all
[1:50:12] that out and they had they had done it
[1:50:15] for years and years and they would send
[1:50:17] these Goods to alden's and to spiegels
[1:50:19] and to uh you know Sears and all them
[1:50:21] sort of thing so what's amazing was you
[1:50:24] was the beginning of where it started
[1:50:25] then it went through a process and they
[1:50:27] take it down through the sowing people
[1:50:29] and then they'd take it to the
[1:50:30] inspecting people and then they take it
[1:50:32] to the other people then it would come
[1:50:33] back to me and I was right next door as
[1:50:37] a matter of fact I used the same
[1:50:39] shipping door as they received the goods
[1:50:41] in so the goods would come in off of a
[1:50:44] truck buy and there might be hundreds
[1:50:46] and hundreds of rolls of this Fabric and
[1:50:48] it would come in this great big shipping
[1:50:50] door and they would start the process
[1:50:52] run it all through gear all the way down
[1:50:54] to there all the way back over to here
[1:50:56] and come right out to my department and
[1:50:59] whenever I was finished with it it went
[1:51:01] out the same door it'd come in
[1:51:04] but it looked a lot different this time
[1:51:07] because now each piece had took on the
[1:51:11] identity of the pattern you see God
[1:51:14] don't want us just all rolled up in one
[1:51:16] big bundle of this church but God wants
[1:51:18] to roll us out all glory he wants to cut
[1:51:21] us he wants to shape us he wants to mold
[1:51:24] us and we'll come right back out that
[1:51:26] same door we come into but we will have
[1:51:30] our identity as a finished product
[1:51:35] question
[1:51:48] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:51:52] the brides bill
[1:51:58] you have a right today if you're sick
[1:52:01] to be healed
[1:52:03] you have a right if you don't have the
[1:52:04] Holy Ghost to be filled before you leave
[1:52:07] this place today
[1:52:09] if you're lost without God
[1:52:12] and he's dealing with your heart
[1:52:16] you have the right
[1:52:18] to come to pass
[1:52:21] but before you can come to pass you got
[1:52:24] to come to him
[1:52:26] come to him and he will help you come to
[1:52:29] pass
[1:52:31] praise be to God
[1:52:33] to as many as received him to them gave
[1:52:37] he The Authority right right the
[1:52:40] jurisdiction the position
[1:52:43] to become sons of God in other words to
[1:52:46] come to pass
[1:52:47] because what you do you come into the
[1:52:49] door of humanity all roll Goods there
[1:52:53] they are all of humanity lays out before
[1:52:55] the before the great almighty God but
[1:52:58] who places the pattern God does
[1:53:01] now depending on how them layers of
[1:53:03] fabric because there's no way in the
[1:53:05] world you're going to be able to get a
[1:53:06] roll of fabric big enough to make all
[1:53:07] that one run
[1:53:09] so they would overlap them layers of
[1:53:11] fabric and sometimes they'd overlap them
[1:53:13] six inches 12 inches until they would
[1:53:15] build it when the guys would lay the
[1:53:17] pattern out they just go down through
[1:53:18] and lay it out then whenever they would
[1:53:20] cut that out that piece of the pattern
[1:53:22] might overlapped on a scene
[1:53:27] so someone would have to go through and
[1:53:30] bundle them all up
[1:53:32] and then they would start the first line
[1:53:34] of sowing the sergers
[1:53:36] and they would start searching it but
[1:53:38] once they pulled in there and of course
[1:53:40] the more they sold the more money they
[1:53:41] make so they go very fast
[1:53:44] and they might reach in there and pick
[1:53:46] out one but it just so happened it was
[1:53:48] like this
[1:53:49] if it's not a continuation
[1:53:52] but it was a lap over
[1:53:54] so what would they do put it aside
[1:53:56] discard it the pattern fell on them
[1:54:00] they experienced the touch of the salt
[1:54:04] but they was not a continuation of the
[1:54:07] book of Acts as a matter of fact they
[1:54:10] despised all that emotion
[1:54:12] they didn't like all that worship and
[1:54:14] I'll tell you one thing you sure don't
[1:54:15] want to go to heaven then
[1:54:20] because they're going to be shouting and
[1:54:21] praising God and worshiping God and
[1:54:23] blessing God for eternity
[1:54:26] oh children who places the pattern God
[1:54:29] by his election Grace
[1:54:33] so he lays it now what they would do the
[1:54:34] designers of the pattern would lay that
[1:54:37] piece of paper so they could get the
[1:54:38] most out of the goods but at the very
[1:54:40] best they could do there would always be
[1:54:43] remnants
[1:54:45] I would see tons of remnants of fabric
[1:54:50] picked up
[1:54:51] by the garbage people
[1:54:53] because there was nothing you could make
[1:54:55] out of them
[1:54:56] they were so small
[1:54:58] you could never make nothing out of them
[1:55:00] isn't it awful that a human being comes
[1:55:03] to this world and they live their life
[1:55:05] and when it's all said and done what
[1:55:07] have they done
[1:55:09] a wasted life
[1:55:13] through in a scrap Heap
[1:55:16] Alma
[1:55:18] are we willing today
[1:55:20] to let the great designer
[1:55:22] lay his pattern on our life
[1:55:26] Lord movement shape me cut me
[1:55:30] well they're telling you man I gotta get
[1:55:31] cut you can never make a piece of good
[1:55:34] you can never make a dress or a jacket
[1:55:35] or a shirt or whatever until it's cut
[1:55:38] once it's cut it starts taking on an
[1:55:41] image a shape of the pattern
[1:55:44] let's bow our heads together
[1:55:53] is there anyone here today
[1:55:55] that maybe you've not
[1:55:58] you've not met the Lord in that way
[1:56:00] you've gone to church for a lot for
[1:56:02] years of your life maybe even a member
[1:56:07] but as far as saying that you know him
[1:56:09] and he lives in you and thinks out of
[1:56:12] you and all of that
[1:56:15] but you'd like to know in that way
[1:56:18] but you just raise your hand to him
[1:56:19] today
[1:56:21] God bless you
[1:56:23] God bless you
[1:56:25] amen thank you Father
[1:56:29] maybe there's others heavy that you've
[1:56:31] accepted him you believe him you're
[1:56:33] walking in his way in his word
[1:56:36] but you don't have that dunamis that
[1:56:39] power to help you to overcome and you
[1:56:40] struggle with so many things
[1:56:43] and you're not only struggle but they
[1:56:45] went over you sometimes we can't do this
[1:56:47] on our own friends
[1:56:49] it takes the power of him
[1:56:52] any of you here today you'd like to be
[1:56:54] remembered you need the holy ghost in
[1:56:56] your life the token
[1:56:57] God bless you yes Lord Jesus
[1:57:02] Hallelujah
[1:57:23] he's also wanting a refilling of the
[1:57:25] Holy Ghost
[1:57:27] while we're praying for him those of you
[1:57:29] that have raised your hand would you lay
[1:57:31] your hand on somebody standing there by
[1:57:32] you
[1:57:33] let us all for prayer one for the other
[1:57:39] heavenly father in the name of Jesus
[1:57:41] Christ
[1:57:43] we believe what we've heard today
[1:57:46] we believe this is the answer
[1:57:50] of the pattern
[1:57:52] you're the one who made the church the
[1:57:54] way you wanted it
[1:57:55] man has messed it up man has changed it
[1:57:58] man has made systems an organization out
[1:58:01] of it it's pitiful what it's become
[1:58:04] but Lord God there's still an original
[1:58:06] Church in the Earth
[1:58:08] father you see the needs in our
[1:58:10] brother's body today physically Lord
[1:58:12] this pain that he's been dealing with
[1:58:15] Lord also he needs a refilling of the
[1:58:17] Holy Ghost
[1:58:19] I joined my faith with my brother and
[1:58:21] with his Saints Lord in the name of
[1:58:23] Jesus touch him now father
[1:58:26] you suffered stripes in your body so he
[1:58:30] could be healed
[1:58:31] now in obedience to my Bill of Rights I
[1:58:35] lay my hands on my brother
[1:58:37] in the name of Jesus May the spirit of
[1:58:40] God touch him right now
[1:58:42] may this pain leave him in the very
[1:58:44] cause of it father I pray for a
[1:58:47] refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord every
[1:58:50] fiber of his being filled with the
[1:58:52] presence of God
[1:58:54] granted I pray father
[1:58:57] in the name of Jesus
[1:58:59] Hallelujah
[1:59:02] Hallelujah
[1:59:05] thank you Father

[1:59:10] can we just raise our hands
[1:59:12] in the presence of the great king now
[1:59:16] make our petitions our desires known to
[1:59:18] him but don't just spend all this time
[1:59:20] now ask and ask and asking go ahead tell
[1:59:23] him what you need sure he wants you to
[1:59:25] but when you made your list known
[1:59:27] let's turn it around let's worship him
[1:59:30] and give him something back
[1:59:33] he woke up this morning
[1:59:35] he give you the breath that you breathed
[1:59:38] you all have breathed thousands of times
[1:59:40] since you've been here in this building
[1:59:41] today your hearts beat thousands of
[1:59:44] times
[1:59:45] every one of them heartbeats is a gift
[1:59:47] from God
[1:59:49] Hallelujah
[1:59:51] you've got hands most of you where you
[1:59:53] can raise them up in the presence of God
[1:59:55] why don't you do it right now just raise
[1:59:58] them hands up before the Lord Jesus
[2:00:01] that's one of your rights to worship it
[2:00:05] now you realize in many countries around
[2:00:07] the world they don't have the right to
[2:00:09] worship God but they still worship Him
[2:00:12] Anyway
[2:00:13] they still praise him anyway it's
[2:00:14] against the law but they do it why they
[2:00:17] honor the rights above the law of the
[2:00:20] land
[2:00:21] oh let's just worship him a little bit
[2:00:23] Let's Just Praise Him now let's water
[2:00:25] the seed that we've heard we know that
[2:00:28] Praises water
[2:00:30] so let's water the seed that we've
[2:00:33] received and heard today
