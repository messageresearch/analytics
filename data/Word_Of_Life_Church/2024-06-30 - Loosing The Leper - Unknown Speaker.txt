in the house of God to be here in these series of services this weekend uh ain't Our God good he's done some great things I believe that the Lord is been Among Us spoke to us moved so appreciate our brothers and the ministry that we've heard uh just absolutely outstanding we want to also thank brother Donnie for this opportunity to be here amen how many's looking forward to the word oh I'm looking forward I can't wait to hear what's going to come out of my mouth today Hallelujah Leviticus chapter 13 verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising anybody ever had a rising in your flesh a scab or a bright spot and it be the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy then he shall be brought into Aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the priest and the priest shall look on the plague and the skin of the flesh and when the hair in the plague is turned white and the plague in the sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh so if he looks at the skin and it's superficial it's one thing but then to look at the skin and see that it goes deeper than just the flesh but it actually affects the bloodline and he says it's deeper than the skin of the flesh it's a plague of leprosy and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him unclean if the bright spot be wi in the skin of his flesh and the sight be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof not turn white then the priest shall shut him up that have the plague for seven days and the priest shall look on him on the seventh day and behold if the plague in his sight be at stay and the pr spread not in the skin then the priest shall shut him up seven more days and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and if the plague be somewhat dark and the spread not in the skin the priest shall pronounce him clean it's just a scab he shall wash his clothes and be clean but at the scab spread a much abroad in the skin after he has seen of the priest for his cleansing he shall be seen priest seen of the priest again and if the priest see that behold the scab spreadeth in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a leprosy may the Lord add His blessings to the word today you can be seated I want to speak to you today on this law of the leper here is Israel in the middle of this journey Israel's on their way to the promise they're headed to The Inheritance that God has spoken to them and that God has G them and in the middle of this journey they're going to fight all kinds of battles they're going to go through all kinds of troubles and they come to this place in the journey to where now they are actually Contracting things that has affected these other nations that's around them and now they come to this place to where God has looked down upon them and the Bible said the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron and he spake to them concerning this plague of leprosy so this is something that God is concerned about God's concerned about leprosy God's concerned about diseases God's concerned about our battles he's concerned about our troubles you believe that he is and because of this disease that would come among them he's going to instruct Moses as the Lord is going to tell them how to deal with this leprosy once it comes into the camp now leprosy in the scripture is one of the most feared diseases of the Bible for an individual to contract leprosy it's considered to be a des sentence people that would actually contract this they actually considered this to be actually inflicted by God himself which we know is not true but they would call it divine retribution from God because of evil deeds and evil works and evil thoughts so here they are in this place of the journey and God is wanting to actually instruct them that if someone would come with this Mark upon their skin that it would look like leprosy he wants them to know how they are to deal with a leper once he comes into the camp now and truly once someone comes in the last stages of leprosy there was no way for that person to be able to be help there was no way for them to be able to get past it because there was no for it there was no remedy for it that person as we would say would be destined to die because of what they've contracted because there's no cure and that person that would contract leprosy they would live a life of Torment because leprosy is a bacterial disease it's a disease of the flesh amen I said it's a disease of the flesh it's a disease that will take and it starts in in the flesh but then as it begins to get worse and worse it actually takes and it gets into the bloodline where it flows to every part of the body it affects every part of the body once it begins to flow it affects their hands it affects their fingers it affects their toes symptoms that they develop is actually it's it's granulous inside of the nerves it affects the respiratory tract it affects their speech Hallelujah it actually affects their skin it affects their Vision it affects their sight and because of this this disease that comes upon their hands their hands become numb and it becomes desensitized where they can't feel the way they anybody hear me today they can't feel the way they used to feel they cannot sense the way that they use the sense and they actually take because of the dentation of their fing fingers they would actually take and they would have these wounds and they would injure their fingers until they become so infected and because of this disease they become weak they become poor and they live this way in torment because leprosy makes you weak leprosy brings paralysis leprosy affects your eyes it affects your voice it causes you to lose the ability to feel the way that you used to feel and see things the way that you used to see and the longer that they would have it the worse that they would get so the priest then after seven days if a spot should come upon them he would take and he wants to examine the sore that is upon their body he wants to examine the priest wants to examine the flesh he would examine to see how infected that they really are if there's any chance for them
