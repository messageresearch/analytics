[30:40] and I'll take all I can get
[30:42] I've never been back there one single
[30:44] time by the Terry that I haven't wanted
[30:46] to run out that back door you have know
[30:49] you've never felt nothing like that in
[30:50] your life until you've been truly called
[30:54] to me is a true call it's it's not
[30:59] wanting to do it because God knows in my
[31:02] heart i I would rather be sitting there
[31:03] and I might have told y'all this side I
[31:08] remember the first time I touched the
[31:11] brother Don he about preaching I sent
[31:14] him an email and I called him on the
[31:19] phone and he was talking on the phone he
[31:20] said well you want to take Wednesday
[31:22] night service I said no I said I'll get
[31:24] back to you and I remember the email I
[31:28] sent him I found it the other day it was
[31:30] in 2006 and my first sermon was in 2009
[31:35] so I got back with him in about three
[31:37] years so I didn't rush into this
[31:42] took a lot of sleepless nights and a lot
[31:45] of praying and a lot of tests and trials
[31:47] and you know we don't understand the
[31:49] path that God has for us but you know if
[31:52] you feel the leading of God in your life
[31:54] for anything not just preaching but
[31:57] anything you know when you get to
[32:00] question the Lord is is this is this you
[32:04] listen to the word when I finally did it
[32:08] brother brother Eddie biscuit was up
[32:12] here preaching I was sitting
[32:15] we had a chair sitting up from the sound
[32:17] booth and I don't even everybody
[32:20] preached on the only words that I
[32:22] remember that entire service was he
[32:23] pointed at me and said if God's calling
[32:26] you to preach you better preach
[32:29] [Music]
[32:40] so I'm gonna chop it up again the night
[32:42] brother JimBob says you can't eat it
[32:44] unless it's chopped up so we're gonna
[32:48] chop it up if you got your Bibles we'll
[32:51] get right to it
[32:52] Romans Murray two scriptures and then
[32:54] we'll be seated
[32:55] Romans 8:14 and then we're gonna read in
[32:58] John 1:12 thank you I'm gonna actually
[33:05] pick my sermon up tonight we're brother
[33:06] Donnie left off Wednesday night you know
[33:11] by the Terry sometimes you're wanting
[33:12] confirmation on a sermon that you got
[33:14] prepared and and you're praying about it
[33:16] you know Lord is this what you want me
[33:18] to bring and very into his sermon he he
[33:20] got into mind and and I didn't do these
[33:22] notes I've had these notes for over a
[33:24] year so we're gonna he taught brother
[33:28] Donnie was talking about the bride's
[33:29] position whereas your position as a
[33:32] bride and we're going to look at that
[33:35] and we're going to that and what is your
[33:36] possessions the possessions as an heir
[33:39] as joint heirs of the Christ
[33:40] if you come to be the bride you're
[33:41] claiming to be a joint heir with Christ
[33:43] so there's so many things that belong to
[33:46] you so many things that belong to you
[33:49] and tonight and I hope we can we can get
[33:52] a grasp for that tonight what what God
[33:54] has for us
[33:54] I really believe with all my heart we
[33:57] leave so much stuff laying around that
[33:58] God has for us that we didn't were not
[34:00] picking up so if we can Romans 8:14 or
[34:05] we down through chapters time verse 17
[34:07] for as many were led by the Spirit of
[34:10] God they are the sons of God for you
[34:12] have not received the spirit of bondage
[34:13] again to fear but you have received the
[34:16] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[34:18] Father the spirit itself beareth witness
[34:21] with our spirit that we are the children
[34:24] of God and if children then heirs heirs
[34:27] of God and joint-heirs with Christ if it
[34:31] so be that we suffer with him that we
[34:32] may be also glorified together and John
[34:38] one will reject by verse 12 and 13 but
[34:44] as many as received him to them he gave
[34:46] power to become the sons of God even to
[34:48] them that believe on his name which are
[34:51] which are born not of blood
[34:54] nor of the will of the flesh nor the
[34:56] will of a man but of God
[34:57] and in that verses 12 there when it says
[35:01] them that believe on his name that's not
[35:03] like the Baptist method and will you
[35:05] believe on his name and then you're set
[35:07] for life there's everything that comes
[35:10] after that which are born not of blood
[35:13] nor of the will of the flesh nor the
[35:16] will of man but of God
[35:18] let's pray over the word Heavenly Father
[35:22] we thank you Father for this opportunity
[35:25] Lord I pray father that you would help
[35:28] me tonight to get out of the way Lord
[35:30] there's so many things Lord that we no
[35:32] doubt battle through the week through
[35:34] the day Lord we can't redo that we can't
[35:37] undo that Lord it's already done
[35:40] but Lord there's what lies ahead of us
[35:42] Lord as human beings as sons and
[35:44] daughters Lord we can trust in you for
[35:46] everything from this point on Lord that
[35:49] you will take care of us to help us
[35:51] tonight Lord as you brought together
[35:52] here tonight to receive food for the
[35:55] journey Lord Lord I could give it to
[35:57] them as far as these words that I've got
[35:59] here these scriptures these quotes but
[36:01] Lord that's all it would be it would be
[36:03] words of knowledge of my my knowledge of
[36:07] what I wrote down what I perceive the
[36:09] scripture to be what I perceive this
[36:10] coach to be Lord but Lord if you would
[36:12] come and anoint it if you would sit me
[36:14] down Lord and you would take over and
[36:16] reveal to them Lord we could preach this
[36:19] whole sermon and every single person in
[36:21] here would get something different for
[36:23] it to meet their need Lord I pray that
[36:25] you would anoint the people Lord we
[36:27] welcome you here tonight Lord this is
[36:28] your time the days over we've had our
[36:31] time through the day Lord but I pray
[36:32] father that we give light on your time
[36:34] right now we thank you for Jesus name
[36:36] Amen
[36:37] you may be seated in Romans 8:14 and it
[36:44] talks about being a joint heir with
[36:46] Christ now look up the definition of
[36:49] what is a heir a person legally entitled
[36:52] to the property or rank of another on
[36:56] that person's death
[36:59] somebody had to die for you to be who
[37:03] you are to get what you get to possess
[37:06] what you get somebody had to die
[37:09] but somebody had to live to be good join
[37:12] there somebody had to live you can't be
[37:16] a joint heir with somebody unless
[37:18] they're alive so everything that Christ
[37:23] had everything that was given to him of
[37:26] God everything he possessed all the
[37:28] power that he had he died when he died
[37:31] that blood was shed so that you could
[37:35] have that too and the part where Satan
[37:39] missed out was when he rose again and he
[37:41] did he didn't take it back from me he
[37:43] didn't say well psyche I'm not I'm not
[37:45] really dead I'm alive now you give it
[37:46] back
[37:47] he said I'll share that with you then
[37:49] join heirs with Christ so brother
[37:53] Branham says in the God who is rich in
[37:55] mercy now we are a part of God you
[37:58] always was you don't remember it because
[38:00] you were only an attribute in God you
[38:03] were only in his thinking your very name
[38:05] if it was ever was in the book of life
[38:07] it was put there before the foundation
[38:09] of the world he knew what you were
[38:11] but Branham says I'm not he says I'm
[38:13] only saying that's not to mix up
[38:15] doctrine but to straighten it out that
[38:17] we might get away from that from this
[38:19] fear and this scare that you don't know
[38:21] who you are you're not going to be but
[38:24] you now you now are sons of God
[38:27] see you always were sons of God so we
[38:30] identify ourselves sin of who we are is
[38:33] is natural people you know your natural
[38:37] name who you are your some of you are
[38:39] our husbands your brother's your uncle's
[38:41] your wives your sisters your aunt's your
[38:43] mom's your dad's that's your natural
[38:45] identity here on earth you you can say
[38:48] yeah I Know Who I am
[38:49] I'm Gary here son that's that's who I am
[38:52] Benny what God wants you to recognize
[38:55] God wants you to recognize who you are
[38:57] in him if you can't recognize who you
[39:02] are in him then the cross was in vain to
[39:04] you it was in vain you don't recognize
[39:09] that you're a joint heir
[39:10] you don't recognize what Christ done for
[39:12] you you don't recognize what belongs to
[39:13] you so how does what God wants us to see
[39:17] how we are in him you know we can go on
[39:20] say we're bride you know you can you can
[39:23] say I'm bride i'm identified in this
[39:24] message i'm a part of this message and
[39:25] after a while that's for years years
[39:27] that's always say I'm in the message I'm
[39:29] in the message on the message there's a
[39:31] lot of people there's a lot of people in
[39:33] this message that'll never go through
[39:35] them pearly gates that's sitting in
[39:37] these churches and that's the only thing
[39:39] when they go the grave that will be the
[39:41] only thing they take with him related to
[39:43] this message was they said in a message
[39:45] church that's all they'll take because
[39:48] they never had a full revelation of who
[39:50] they were you can say I'm bright brother
[39:54] branham you said but you people used to
[39:56] say that brother Branham would said when
[39:59] the bride recognized who she is she'll
[40:00] go you know I don't think he preached
[40:02] that in 63 in mystery of God revealed it
[40:07] becomes a cliche anymore you know we say
[40:10] that we say that when the bride
[40:12] recognizes who she is she'll leave we're
[40:15] still here
[40:18] I don't dampen my faith in Ian who I am
[40:21] if this goes on for another ten years 20
[40:25] years if I'm still alive not absolutely
[40:27] believe I'm going interruption I don't
[40:30] believe I'll go the way of the grave i I
[40:32] don't I believe that I'm gonna be in the
[40:34] rapture I believe I am the rapture so
[40:39] you if you believe that you're not going
[40:42] without me and it ain't because I went
[40:45] to this church it's not because I
[40:48] believe this message it's because of Who
[40:51] I am
[40:52] it's because what what God made me to be
[40:57] [Music]
[40:58] in the future home if you are the bride
[41:04] the bride is part of the husband the
[41:08] only place you'll recognize is
[41:10] recognized what part of that husband
[41:13] that word you are and you can't
[41:15] recognize being the bride how he says
[41:18] how many sees that you get a bride come
[41:20] up here a bride comes up here and
[41:22] doesn't wedding if all she gets out of
[41:25] that there's a nice fancy dress she
[41:27] thinks she looks good and all the pomp
[41:30] and circumstance that goes with it and
[41:31] she never realizes who she is at that
[41:34] point she takes on that name she takes
[41:39] on everything that comes with that name
[41:40] if he's a millionaire
[41:41] oh yeah I don't know if you all
[41:43] understand the state of Tennessee what
[41:44] mutual law is mutual law is when you're
[41:48] married what's yours is hers whether her
[41:52] names on it or not that's mutual law
[41:55] that is that gets recognized in the
[41:57] state of Tennessee we've had people come
[41:59] filed reports men come filed a report
[42:01] that his wife stole his car
[42:03] are you married yeah we're not living
[42:04] together it don't matter it don't matter
[42:09] what's hers is yours what's yours is
[42:11] hers and that's the part of a bride this

[42:30] put on that garment the weekend a week
[42:33] out and that's all you do is put on the
[42:34] garment just listen then you get up and
[42:36] walk out you know I see people all the
[42:38] time
[42:39] as soon as the preaching let's stand
[42:40] they trying to walk out where's the
[42:44] worship where's the praise of being the
[42:48] bride he's dressing you and that's all
[42:54] you you get out of it was okay I got I
[42:57] got the sleeves put on today and out the
[42:59] door you go where's the worship you know
[43:03] and we'll get into it later in
[43:04] possessing every every time Israel moved
[43:07] further into the land of Canaan each
[43:08] city they possessed how did they finish
[43:11] their victory with praise and worship
[43:17] and this that's part of being the bride
[43:22] listen whoo you know I'm not at whoa I'm
[43:26] not a woman but if I was a woman and I
[43:28] was marrying the man of my dreams and
[43:30] Wayne laughing at me if I was a woman
[43:35] and I was marrying the man of my dreams
[43:36] and I felt it was kosher I'd be shouting
[43:40] and jumping and you know I mean if
[43:42] that's the way it is this is your dream
[43:44] this is what you dreamed of your whole
[43:46] life it's recognizing who you are but
[43:55] not only recognizing who you are as a
[43:57] bride recognizing your position in the
[43:59] bride
[44:00] everybody's got a position his brother
[44:04] Donny was saying tonight you know
[44:05] everybody's different if everybody's
[44:07] position everybody can't have the same
[44:09] position I trade positions with any one
[44:12] of you right now but everybody has a
[44:17] position and when you try to fulfill
[44:19] somebody else's position
[44:20] everything goes sideways you ever heard
[44:25] that saying nobody wants to be nobody
[44:27] everybody wants to be somebody but be
[44:32] yourself because everybody's taken
[44:36] be yourself don't be nobody else
[44:39] don't try to fulfill my position in the
[44:42] bride if you want to help somebody along
[44:46] the way
[44:48] be who you are in your position you'll
[44:51] be a greater blessing being who you are
[44:53] than trying to be somebody else we all
[45:03] can agree that we're members of the
[45:04] bride we can all say yeah members of the
[45:06] bride but I can't I can't tell you what
[45:10] your position is it's not enough to know
[45:14] God does God know you does God recognize
[45:21] you is it right in your position Satan's
[45:25] job he's not going to tell you this word
[45:28] and I might've spoken this before I
[45:30] think I've preached the message here and
[45:32] a half two years ago on who are you man
[45:36] I've gotten messages off of that this is
[45:37] one of them say he's not gonna tell you
[45:41] this message is wrong he would never
[45:43] convince you that for nothing
[45:45] he would never convince you that this is
[45:48] wrong
[45:49] but his job is keep you from seeing
[45:51] yourself in this his job is to keep you
[45:54] from seeing who you are what is yours
[45:58] what belongs to you he'll do his best to
[46:04] keep from getting you are getting a true
[46:06] revelation of what lies within you what
[46:09] kind of power that you have in you do we
[46:11] really realize but Terry what we have as
[46:14] sons and daughters of God now this is
[46:19] not you can't say well I'm in the
[46:22] message you know I had a a guy come to
[46:25] to me many years ago I was talking about
[46:27] it somebody yesterday that some guy in
[46:29] the message and went and told somebody
[46:31] that you had to be in the message to go
[46:33] to heaven to bit to believe what we
[46:35] believe to go to heaven he said I told
[46:37] him right then I said absolutely not
[46:39] absolutely not you have as many times
[46:44] brother Donny hit that the last year
[46:47] it's not your for no more you know as
[46:54] your position in the bride you're to be
[46:56] a light to others but is your life being
[47:02] too light to others that don't mean
[47:03] nobody else that don't see your lights
[47:04] not gonna go that's your power that's
[47:08] your position in the bride do you
[47:11] recognize what you have but Bram says in
[47:15] thy house this is one of my most
[47:17] favorite quotes that he says we're here
[47:19] you're talking about Jupiter and Mars
[47:22] and these stars that you see now well
[47:25] think about a 186,000 miles per second
[47:30] 186,000 miles per second take 120
[47:33] million years by one second 186,000
[47:38] break it down to 120 million years then
[47:41] what you got that's miles he says that
[47:46] and now then beyond that there's just as
[47:48] many moons and stars and he holds them
[47:51] with the power of his own word and that
[47:54] very same thing that holds them is in
[47:58] you as a Christian if you ever get a
[48:02] revelation of that part of the power
[48:05] that's in you there shouldn't be
[48:07] anything out there that you that God
[48:10] says is your possession take your
[48:11] possessions but you shouldn't be getting
[48:14] how could you not that this quote right
[48:18] here is a revelation it has to be a
[48:20] revelation and I believe that we don't
[48:23] have regulations that we live so far
[48:24] beneath what God has for us because we
[48:26] don't have a real revelation of the
[48:29] power of God in our lives now I don't
[48:32] mean you're gonna walk around go through
[48:34] a hospital and raise if everybody out of
[48:35] bed it's not that it's the power like
[48:42] was the brother Homer preaching about
[48:43] power of creating her brother Dara one
[48:45] of them creating that atmosphere
[48:48] the people know who you are people know
[48:52] when they get around you what kind of
[48:55] person you are we have to see the power
[49:01] that we have in us we're going to read
[49:04] in Leviticus I'm going to start getting
[49:07] into now in the possessions the children
[49:12] is in Leviticus 20 24 but I have said
[49:16] unto you you shall inherit that their
[49:19] land and I will give it unto you to
[49:21] possess their land that floweth with
[49:23] milk and honey I am the Lord your God
[49:25] which has separated you from other
[49:26] people they were different they were a
[49:29] different people and as time went on
[49:32] they they fail to recognize that the
[49:35] children of Israel lost a glimpse of who
[49:37] they really were of the God that was
[49:40] with him when they come out of Egypt and
[49:43] they the ones that went into the land
[49:46] they seemed there they seemed their
[49:48] family members died off they see God
[49:50] slay them in the wilderness and yet when
[49:56] they went into the land and God told him
[49:57] this is the land that you're going to
[49:58] inherit and the deeper they went in it
[50:00] the more lakhs they got and they were
[50:06] different they failed to get a
[50:07] revelation of who they were verse 25 and
[50:10] you you shall therefore put difference
[50:13] between clean beasts and unclean and
[50:14] between unclean fouls and clean and you
[50:16] shall not make your souls of not
[50:19] abominable by beasts by foul or any
[50:22] manner of living thing that creepeth
[50:23] keepeth on the ground which I have
[50:25] separated from you is unclean you shall
[50:27] be holy unto me for I am the Lord Lord
[50:30] am holy and have Cert severed you from
[50:33] other people that you should be mine
[50:34] severed means I've divided you I pulled
[50:37] you out I pulled you aside you're a
[50:39] different people you have a different
[50:42] power of within you you have a different
[50:44] attitude you have a different atmosphere
[50:47] have different possessions everything in
[50:51] your life should be different it's a
[50:55] shame in that it took a Gentile a
[50:58] Gentile woman recognized who they were
[51:01] Rea have recognized who they were she
[51:04] knew who they were
[51:05] she said we know that the Lord she knew
[51:08] who the Lord was that she never she had
[51:10] they served graven images and everything
[51:12] else but she said the Lord have given
[51:14] you our land she knew who they were she
[51:17] knew that God had given them a
[51:19] possession God has taken our possession
[51:21] and giving it to you and only a few ever
[51:27] ever got the glimpse of who they were as
[51:33] I see said people see who you are
[51:36] people see what you possess you know I'm
[51:38] not talking about earthly possessions
[51:39] I'm not you know just because somebody's
[51:41] got a lot of money got a lot of things
[51:43] that people say well God's really
[51:44] blessed them no maybe maybe they're a
[51:46] hard worker
[51:49] maybe maybe they had a rich uncle you
[51:53] know it's not it's not that they're
[51:55] serving God better than you you know son
[51:59] some people's lives you know through
[52:02] their whole life if you get older I mean
[52:05] you're getting older brother Terry I
[52:06] seen the 2017 Happy Valley Church Youth
[52:10] picture back there on brother Donny and
[52:13] me and brother Terry wasn't in it but
[52:18] you see people that through life their
[52:20] whole life their generation next
[52:21] generation you see that they struggle
[52:23] they struggle financially is a struggle
[52:25] physically they struggle with sickness
[52:27] in it you think well you know wow maybe
[52:29] maybe you know they're done something
[52:31] wrong with their life that's just there
[52:33] a lot in life everyone is different
[52:38] exodus 20:3 a little bit a little I will
[52:42] drive them out this is God saying I'm
[52:43] giving you this land all the way back in
[52:46] Abraham I was I was reading in Genesis
[52:49] this week where God said area as the
[52:51] dust of the of the ground so your seed
[52:54] shall be in this land this is your land
[52:55] he taken there into hedron and he said
[52:57] this is all yours as far as you can see
[52:59] it's all yours and that this is what
[53:03] he's telling the children of Israel 400
[53:06] years later when he brings them out
[53:08] little by little I'll Drive them out
[53:10] before thee and unto thee until thou be
[53:13] increased and inherit the land I will
[53:16] set thy bounds we're gonna get into this
[53:18] later I will set that boundaries from
[53:21] the Red Sea even unto the sea of the
[53:23] Philistines from the desert to the river
[53:25] for I will deliver then happiness of the
[53:28] land into your hand and you shall drive
[53:29] them out before thee thou shall make no
[53:33] covenant with them northern gods they
[53:37] shall not dwell in thy land we're going
[53:40] to talk about that again in a minute
[53:41] they shall not dwell in thy land the
[53:44] hating taking it yet but God's calling
[53:46] it there's the head knee and taking a
[53:48] knee step a foot on it and God says this
[53:50] is your land so in other words everybody
[53:54] else's trespassers so everything else
[53:57] that you claim is yours that's God's
[53:59] giving you if you claimed your healing
[54:01] you got cancer on that cancer is
[54:03] trespassing on what's yours if you got
[54:07] depression joy and peace is yours
[54:11] depressions trespassing on that
[54:14] so God said move these boundaries move
[54:17] these boundaries on the other side of
[54:19] that take this piece take this joy set a
[54:23] boundary on the other side of that
[54:24] that's yours push it as far as you want
[54:26] all the way to the Red Sea thou shalt
[54:31] not dwell in Isle a unless they'll make
[54:33] less they make these sin against me for
[54:36] if thou serve their gods it shall burn
[54:38] this shall surely be a snare unto them
[54:41] so God tells him to push him out I know
[54:47] I've got a few quotes of scriptures here
[54:48] early but I'll lessen it up here in a
[54:52] minute
[54:53] Jehovah Jireh in the 64 you don't know
[54:57] what you you own till you go looking
[55:00] through the Bible to find out the
[55:01] promises he's talking about your
[55:04] possessions they'll keep you from them
[55:08] if they can but they're yours
[55:10] every promise is to Abraham and to his
[55:12] seed after him every divine promise in
[55:15] the word belongs to Abraham and his seed
[55:16] and you are an heir to it there's that
[55:18] word again you're an heir to it says an
[55:22] heir
[55:22] oh my I like to look through to see what
[55:24] I got if somebody give me something I
[55:28] like to look it over I like to look
[55:30] through the Bible and see what belongs
[55:31] to me every seed of Abraham ought to do
[55:34] that when you become born-again feel
[55:37] with the Spirit of God and the Holy
[55:38] Spirit upon you you're an heir to every
[55:40] one of those promises promises become
[55:46] your possessions once you recognize who
[55:47] you are do you don't know you own
[55:51] something you can't possess it yet you
[55:54] can't you know that you're rich honking
[55:56] can will a million dollars to you and if
[56:00] you don't realize that he's your rich
[56:02] uncle you'll never possess it it'll
[56:05] never be yours it'll lay there and
[56:08] probate or whatever it does for and
[56:10] until you realize who you are
[56:16] so every promise in God's Word belongs
[56:18] to you and Satan's job is keep you from
[56:20] seeing that like I said he's not gonna
[56:24] make you believe you're not a senator of
[56:25] daughter of God but he'll keep you from
[56:28] taking what's yours
[56:31] he'll keep your healing from you your
[56:35] deliverance from you everything
[56:38] everything that your financial needs
[56:41] your lost son your lost daughter you
[56:43] lost husband he's going to just
[56:47] discourage you to even think that
[56:49] there's anything to be done I heard a
[56:52] story the other day this guy says he's
[56:55] going down the road and he looks over
[56:57] and sees Satan has a yard sale going on
[57:01] he said so he decides he just stopped in
[57:04] there and see what he's got he says say
[57:07] well what do you got for sale over here
[57:09] he said well I got a lot of things he
[57:12] said but discouragement is my best
[57:13] seller and so he says why why do you
[57:17] sell so much of that he said once I sell
[57:19] discouragement all my other tools work
[57:20] so his job it is to sell you
[57:24] discouragement as a son and daughter of
[57:27] God you're not allowed to possess that
[57:30] that's a genocide God said push him out
[57:34] he told Israel to push the Jebusites out
[57:38] but let we let it linger there
[57:44] and so many times Satan tries to get us
[57:47] to believe that we can live with it
[57:50] that's what got Israel in trouble and
[57:53] that's what got news roll in trouble to
[57:54] this day he told them you push them to
[57:58] these boundaries and you fit your
[58:00] boundaries over at the Red Sea you set
[58:01] them over to see if the desert the sea
[58:03] of the Philistines you set them on the
[58:05] other side of the desert these are your
[58:06] boundaries you push him all the way past
[58:09] there well they got the Jebusites to one
[58:12] spot and they decided to let him stay
[58:16] and they got to thinking amongst
[58:18] themselves you know what they say
[58:20] they're bad this is not that bad at all
[58:22] we can live with this that's still
[58:28] Satan's tactic to this day he's got a
[58:32] jebby sack called a pill there's times
[58:36] you see people never people that have
[58:38] been suffered and complained with things
[58:39] for years and years you never see him up
[58:41] here one time to get prayed for
[58:45] complaining about how sick they are
[58:47] complaining about how depressed they are
[58:49] how much they hurt and they're popping
[58:51] pills like a junkie what about your
[58:56] possession of healing that God said when
[58:58] you're in the land this is yours and
[59:01] there you are pop and Jeff decides I'm
[59:05] not nothing that gets medication but
[59:08] when that becomes your only source of
[59:10] healing you've built a house for the
[59:13] Jebusites
[59:14] [Applause]
[59:20] that's not doctrine that just Joe's
[59:23] opinion and Joshua 23-8 but Cleveland to
[59:33] the Lord your God as you have done this
[59:35] day for the LORD hath driven them out
[59:37] before you before you great nations and
[59:39] strong but as for you he's telling this
[59:42] is this is what you're going to be able
[59:44] to do as sons and daughters of God but
[59:47] as for you no man hath been able to
[59:49] stand before you and to this day nobody
[59:51] has stood before you they would have had
[59:54] no trouble driving the Jebusites out
[59:57] zero trouble all they had to do is trust
[1:00:01] God God already said this is your land
[1:00:05] they're trespassing one man of you shall
[1:00:10] chase a thousand for the Lord your God
[1:00:12] it is he that findeth for you as he hath
[1:00:15] promised you take good heed therefore
[1:00:18] unto you and to yourselves that you love
[1:00:20] the Lord your God so instead of
[1:00:24] possessing healing deliverance salvation
[1:00:30] for your loved ones Satan's handing over
[1:00:34] sadness bitterness depression doubt
[1:00:43] worry stress you can't have all the
[1:00:48] other stuff if you if you own that
[1:00:52] what happened was the Jebusites planted
[1:00:54] corn on their property so they they
[1:00:56] weren't able to so she don't nothing so
[1:00:59] they had to live with what with all the
[1:01:01] being short of what God taught them they
[1:01:03] could have in Exodus 23 says else if you
[1:01:14] do in anywise go back and cleave into
[1:01:16] the remnant of those nations even those
[1:01:18] that remain among you and she'll make
[1:01:20] marriages with them and go into them and
[1:01:22] they - you know for a certainty that the
[1:01:24] Lord your God will no more drive out any
[1:01:26] of these nations from before you they
[1:01:28] shall be snares and traps unto you and
[1:01:34] they are to this day naturally speaking
[1:01:37] in Israel and scourges in your side and
[1:01:41] thorns in your eyes until you perish
[1:01:42] from off this good land which the LORD
[1:01:44] hath given you the Joshua 15 as for the
[1:01:50] Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:01:52] the children of Judah could not drive
[1:01:53] them out but the Jebusites 12 were the
[1:01:56] children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this
[1:01:59] day
[1:01:59] Joshua was 17 yet the children Manasseh
[1:02:02] could not drive out the inhabitants of
[1:02:04] those cities but the Canaanites would
[1:02:07] dwell in that land yet it came to pass
[1:02:10] when the children of Israel wax and
[1:02:12] strong that they put the Canaanites to
[1:02:15] tribute they put him to tribute and what
[1:02:17] God said do
[1:02:18] God said drive them out you're settling
[1:02:23] you're settling for something Satan's
[1:02:26] giving you and you're decided to live
[1:02:27] with it if I don't think about it I just
[1:02:31] leave it alone go about my business I
[1:02:33] won't worry about it
[1:02:36] God said drive it out and the children
[1:02:40] of Benjamin Joshua was the judges 121
[1:02:42] and the tuner of bisman did not drive
[1:02:45] out to Jimmy sites that inhabited
[1:02:46] Jerusalem but the Jim jb sites dwell
[1:02:49] with the children of Benjamin in
[1:02:50] Jerusalem unto this day in possessing
[1:02:55] all things oh my how I like that
[1:02:59] believers promise you say what's that
[1:03:02] got to do with us to every believer the
[1:03:04] believers
[1:03:05] promises eternal life the believers
[1:03:07] promises life it's joy its peace
[1:03:08] long-suffering gentleness patience
[1:03:10] fruits of the spirit divine human a
[1:03:12] dozen things I've wrote down here nearly
[1:03:14] that is your possession it belongs to
[1:03:16] you but you cannot have it until you
[1:03:18] fight for it it's yours Israel gave up
[1:03:22] the fight they gave up fighting they
[1:03:27] decide to didn't want to fight no more
[1:03:28] it really wasn't much of a fight God
[1:03:32] said you I'll be with you I'll Drive
[1:03:35] them out for you so why do they get
[1:03:39] tired why do they settle we do that life
[1:03:43] there's so much things that God has for
[1:03:46] us and we decided to settle without it I
[1:03:49] believe with all my heart that this
[1:03:52] bride will obtain every single position
[1:03:54] God has for Bob time she gets out of
[1:03:56] here it's yours God's not saving some of
[1:04:01] these possessions for another day he
[1:04:04] said everything that God was he poured
[1:04:06] into Christ everything Christ that was
[1:04:07] he poured back into his bride he didn't
[1:04:11] leave a little something out but we
[1:04:14] settled so far beneath what God has for
[1:04:16] so many times and we wonder why we
[1:04:18] struggle in our daily walk
[1:04:20] you know it's human nature it's this

[1:05:51] one of the first thing God gives give
[1:05:53] this brother he's the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:55] it's a free gift you got people seeing
[1:05:58] that people are struggling for years for
[1:06:00] the Holy Ghost I've been struggling

[1:06:05] for the Holy Ghost it's a free gift my
[1:06:09] son asked me to not if I'm going to use
[1:06:10] the Oreo we had a young people's meeting

[1:06:16] he's here tonight or not but the John
[1:06:19] Horhn you act some of us but there's a
[1:06:20] lot of question and answers but Terry I
[1:06:22] think you remember a lot of the young
[1:06:24] people did question the answers and
[1:06:25] brother Donnie wanted some of the help
[1:06:27] ministers here to have meetings with
[1:06:30] both brother Weber and hanging brother
[1:06:33] Bradley about the horny act and answer
[1:06:35] some of these and I took the Holy Ghost
[1:06:36] subject and there's one boy he really
[1:06:39] liked Oreos so I told him I said it's
[1:06:43] this simple
[1:06:44] if you want to Oreo and you know there's
[1:06:47] Oreos in the pantry what do you do you
[1:06:51] go get them and eat them
[1:06:52] it's that simple the Holy Ghost is a
[1:06:56] free gift

[1:07:01] have to get get beat on the back speak
[1:07:03] in tongues it's a free gift God did not
[1:07:07] say work for it when Christmas comes
[1:07:08] around all them gifts under the tree the
[1:07:13] days your wife asks you to do four
[1:07:15] hundred push-ups for you open yours it's
[1:07:19] not it's not that he's got your name on
[1:07:22] it
[1:07:22] so you go get it in question answers in
[1:07:28] 59 before there was a world you were in
[1:07:31] God stop it in God's thoughts to give
[1:07:34] you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd
[1:07:37] be wanting it you imagine before
[1:07:42] foundation of the world but Jerry God
[1:07:47] looked down through time and see brother
[1:07:48] he's gonna want the Holy Ghost I'm gonna
[1:07:50] have it all ready for him it's gonna be
[1:07:53] there waiting for him when he gets there
[1:07:57] it's a free gift God knew what your
[1:08:01] desire would be God knew that you would
[1:08:02] want to live for him God knew that she
[1:08:04] wanted to live a clean holy life and for
[1:08:08] you to walk in the footsteps of deity he
[1:08:12] said you've got to have this you've got
[1:08:15] to have the Holy Ghost so I want to have
[1:08:17] it there waiting for you so why did he
[1:08:21] do that well brand him also e-type to
[1:08:24] Egypt Israel coming out of Egypt in the
[1:08:26] Canaan Egypt is the world Canaan as the
[1:08:29] Holy Ghost you know that was his his
[1:08:33] type of that it was God he'd give it to
[1:08:36] them give it to him that's how easy it
[1:08:40] was when they first crossed Jordan and
[1:08:43] went into Canaan and they were slaying
[1:08:45] people left and right it was easy
[1:08:47] because God gave it to him why why did
[1:08:51] he give it to him it was a promise he
[1:08:54] made Abraham
[1:08:56] it wasn't because they were ever ham see
[1:08:58] why why does he give you what he gives
[1:09:00] you it's because of who you are it ain't
[1:09:03] it's not because of anything you done if
[1:09:05] my kids want something if I'm able if
[1:09:09] I'm able within reason if I'm able I'm
[1:09:11] gonna get it for him why because they're
[1:09:12] mine they're my kids the things that you
[1:09:17] want in life the things that God the
[1:09:19] blessings that God gives you in life you
[1:09:21] did not one single thing to deserve that
[1:09:23] you didn't do anything I've give my kids
[1:09:27] stuff but they didn't deserve there's
[1:09:31] times I I could have stomped a mud hole
[1:09:32] in them but they're mine and I love them
[1:09:36] anyway so I'm going to give them stuff
[1:09:39] what if God judges you by every mistake
[1:09:41] that you made what if God judged you I'm
[1:09:45] going to give you your possessions based
[1:09:48] on your mistakes you would have anything
[1:09:51] you would have nothing you don't deserve
[1:09:55] anything to begin with we don't deserve
[1:09:57] anything but it's because of who you are
[1:10:00] joint heirs with Christ
[1:10:02] whatever Christ was was it belongs to
[1:10:05] you it's because of who we are that's
[1:10:10] why he gives us the Holy Ghost I was
[1:10:17] studying this I was wondering you know
[1:10:18] God looking at who we are us looking at
[1:10:21] who we are the people looking at who we
[1:10:22] are what a Satan see when he sees you
[1:10:25] what is the devil see does he know who
[1:10:28] you are
[1:10:30] remember the sons of secrets even x19
[1:10:34] they were trying to cast out Devils in
[1:10:37] Jesus name in Paul's name they said
[1:10:39] Jesus we know Paul we know but who are
[1:10:40] you so when you when you get down to
[1:10:44] pray when you go through your walk of
[1:10:47] life and you're trying to Satan I'm
[1:10:49] claiming this I'm claiming this does he
[1:10:51] know who you are
[1:10:53] does he know what you're claiming or
[1:10:59] does he just tell you I don't know who
[1:11:01] you are and you ain't taking it it's
[1:11:06] going to be impossible for you to for
[1:11:08] Satan to recognize who we are if we
[1:11:09] can't recognize who we ourselves you
[1:11:14] don't if you don't know you're the bride
[1:11:16] you're never gonna walk down that aisle
[1:11:18] if you claim to be the bride the bride
[1:11:21] don't recognize who she is
[1:11:23] music starts playing if she don't know
[1:11:24] she's the bride she's never coming
[1:11:25] through them doors no matter what she's
[1:11:28] got on no matter who stand up here
[1:11:30] waiting it's recognizing who you are you
[1:11:37] said brother Joe I don't have I don't
[1:11:39] have faith for a lot of things and I
[1:11:44] love this quote and I had this and but
[1:11:48] the Saunders name will recognize this
[1:11:49] I used this quote up in Arizona a few
[1:11:52] months ago I got the studying the other
[1:11:56] script the other message I got out of
[1:11:59] who you are or who are you was one the
[1:12:02] power of words and I found this quote he
[1:12:05] said brother but the brain was talking
[1:12:06] about people who said something to him
[1:12:08] they didn't have enough faith didn't
[1:12:11] have enough faith he says if you don't
[1:12:13] have enough faith he said go the adopted
[1:12:15] baby route how many ever heard that
[1:12:18] before go the adopted baby route he
[1:12:23] preached that an eagle stirreth up her
[1:12:25] nest and he goes on to explain what the
[1:12:27] adopted baby route is he said you know
[1:12:29] what you take a mother that can't have a
[1:12:31] baby she tries and tries to tries to
[1:12:32] have a baby and she can't have a baby so
[1:12:36] she will adopt Allah and then not all
[1:12:40] the times but a lot most of the times
[1:12:41] when she quit stressing out and worrying
[1:12:44] about having a baby she ends up having a
[1:12:48] baby
[1:12:50] he said so you take that need that you
[1:12:52] have and you approach that need with
[1:12:54] adopted baby around brother branham what
[1:12:57] brother branham was telling to do you
[1:12:59] take that need and you put it up here in
[1:13:01] your mind you put it up here in your
[1:13:04] mind you start thinking positive
[1:13:06] thoughts about that need and you come in
[1:13:11] here on Wednesdays and Saturdays and
[1:13:12] Sundays you get it a well checkup you
[1:13:16] rock it you sing lullabies to it
[1:13:19] whatever that need is every thought that
[1:13:21] you give it you change it you feed it
[1:13:25] that adopted baby is gonna begin to grow
[1:13:30] and when that enough the baby grows
[1:13:32] about brother Donnie always says about
[1:13:33] 14 inches it'll end up down here
[1:13:37] I believe I preached the sermon here two
[1:13:40] three years ago but the brain said you
[1:13:41] know if you can't have faith you know he
[1:13:43] said do the next best thing you know
[1:13:46] he's talking about thinking positive you
[1:13:47] get what he said pray for doctors pray
[1:13:49] for nurses everything you know it's not
[1:13:52] all about working up faith but Donnie
[1:13:56] didn't preach the series here not too
[1:13:58] long ago about positive thinking so you
[1:14:01] got a you got a possession in your life
[1:14:04] you struggle with things in your life
[1:14:07] whether it's healing you feel like I
[1:14:10] can't I can't get enough enough faith to
[1:14:12] believe for my healing
[1:14:13] sometimes when you're the one hurting
[1:14:16] when you're the one hurting sometimes
[1:14:18] you need somebody else to believe with
[1:14:20] you you have to but Terry's sister Alice
[1:14:25] needs you will go into her liver disease
[1:14:28] problem she needed brother Terry's faith
[1:14:31] she needed our faith buts it is I could
[1:14:36] see maybe sister Alice is mine it's hard
[1:14:38] to have faith if you but you can think
[1:14:39] positive you can think positive I
[1:14:42] believe God's help me just think I'm I'm
[1:14:45] healing
[1:14:45] you get that whale body you see that
[1:14:47] whale body out there and you walk
[1:14:48] towards that whale body come brother
[1:14:52] Bram say every time they come off path
[1:14:54] platform go your way thinking God
[1:14:58] there's people that's come across this
[1:15:00] platform and got hands laid on them for
[1:15:03] sickness and walked away with it
[1:15:05] thanking God thanking God so they
[1:15:12] adopted baby around
[1:15:13] you got a lost son lost daughter lost
[1:15:15] husband you kid on drugs lost wife or
[1:15:19] whatever whatever is you get it if you
[1:15:21] can't have faith for it it's hard when
[1:15:23] you're stressed out sometimes when
[1:15:25] you're worrying so much about your kids
[1:15:28] it's hard sometimes to have the right
[1:15:30] kind of faith because that worry that
[1:15:33] stress piles up to start thinking God
[1:15:36] get a positive thoughts in your mind and
[1:15:39] start thinking that way let's talk about
[1:15:48] boundaries God told Israel where to set
[1:15:53] their boundaries we have boundaries I'm
[1:15:59] gonna use these things y'all take a
[1:16:05] break I was about 15 years old how many
[1:16:15] members brother Danny Williams I love
[1:16:21] that man I was about 15 years old and
[1:16:24] ruther Danny Williams come to Kentucky
[1:16:26] he took two mic stands really he took
[1:16:35] two mic stands and he used them as
[1:16:39] boundary markers he preached the message
[1:16:42] on boundaries he was touched it took
[1:16:44] these boundary markers and he talked
[1:16:46] about God telling Israel we move into
[1:16:50] the land a brother Danny started moving
[1:16:52] using the boundary markers he said God
[1:16:55] you know would take them and they go
[1:16:57] past Jericho and they moved the boundary
[1:16:59] this way and they would stretch out that
[1:17:00] boundary
[1:17:01] the next city over and they move that
[1:17:03] boundary they move it finally if I had
[1:17:05] all this land and then he took them same
[1:17:09] boundary markers he said let's use these
[1:17:14] boundary markers in your life right
[1:17:20] here's where Satan wants you boundary
[1:17:21] markers right here cuz you ain't got
[1:17:27] nothing you can't move you can't build a
[1:17:31] house right here there's no land and you
[1:17:35] can't make footsteps footsteps our
[1:17:41] possessions so you got sickness in your
[1:17:47] life you got cancer right over there is
[1:17:49] healing you've got to move this boundary
[1:17:53] over there to have this healing you have
[1:17:57] depression right over there is joy and
[1:18:00] this boundary marker has to go from here
[1:18:02] to there here's the key to that God said
[1:18:09] that was yours it should be as simple as
[1:18:13] walking over and putting your boundary
[1:18:15] marker across joy putting your boundary
[1:18:19] marker on healing you've created
[1:18:23] footsteps you've got if you can build a
[1:18:26] foundation in here now but so often
[1:18:30] Satan tries to move that boundary marker
[1:18:32] yeah you wasn't really healed anyway you
[1:18:37] know what you're probably right that joy
[1:18:41] you had it was that pill that you took
[1:18:42] remember that the one real joy there's
[1:18:46] just that pill you took and so often he
[1:18:49] gets us right back in here
[1:18:54] these boundaries should be so far you
[1:18:56] should even seem everything that God has
[1:19:01] to push your boundaries so far that you
[1:19:05] can't even seem because I'm thinking if
[1:19:10] I can see my boundaries I don't have
[1:19:11] enough land I don't have enough
[1:19:14] possessions hey I'm going to be greedy
[1:19:17] when what God gave me I'm going to be
[1:19:20] greedy I'm gonna get all I can get
[1:19:26] whatever as I was saying sometimes to
[1:19:29] move these boundaries it takes faith of
[1:19:30] others you don't want when your wife or
[1:19:33] your husband's in the hospital dying you
[1:19:36] know somebody needs to grab this with
[1:19:38] you so my hands to grab us with you
[1:19:43] somebody has to help you move it because
[1:19:46] sometimes whenever you got cancer you
[1:19:49] got liver disease and you need these
[1:19:51] boundaries move past that healing to
[1:19:52] pull that healing in their savings going
[1:19:55] to push them in it's a body move y'all
[1:19:59] the body heals itself ask any nurse any
[1:20:03] doctor everything that you need for
[1:20:05] healing is in the human body the body
[1:20:08] can heal itself but it's all ours
[1:20:14] studying this you know you I was looking
[1:20:18] at the Sara Phoenicians woman it wasn't
[1:20:23] for her it wasn't for you know in
[1:20:28] studying this I'm will jump ahead my
[1:20:29] notes I think cuz I don't know where I'm
[1:20:31] at now but it was it for her what did
[1:20:36] Jesus tell her healing is the children's
[1:20:39] bread
[1:20:41] and sometimes I think we're starving to
[1:20:44] death
[1:20:44] I think we're starving to death it
[1:20:49] that's freely given its the children bed
[1:20:53] but it's not he said it's not for her if
[1:20:58] somebody but God could give it to
[1:21:01] somebody that wasn't for what about
[1:21:03] those that it is for every that's that's
[1:21:08] why that's the way he was and in
[1:21:10] studying this in the last sermon I had a
[1:21:12] power of words I got to read about the
[1:21:16] Gentiles the same situation that
[1:21:18] happened with Israel the same thing that
[1:21:23] happened with Israel taken they're not
[1:21:25] taking their land not taking what God
[1:21:28] had sent what God had given them happen
[1:21:30] or unfolded again right back in in acts
[1:21:33] acts 1346 what Paul tell them but seeing
[1:21:40] you put it from you and judge yourselves
[1:21:41] unworthy of an everlasting life they
[1:21:46] wouldn't go get it they wouldn't take it
[1:21:50] you know I just listened to a sermon
[1:21:54] today is it I don't the state of
[1:21:58] scriptures fulfilled in 65 February 65
[1:22:01] brother Graham said you know in the in
[1:22:04] the scripture talks about my son has
[1:22:05] come out of Egypt but Graham said it was
[1:22:07] a twofold that was a twofold fulfillment
[1:22:10] in that scripture was Jacob coming out
[1:22:12] of Egypt children of Israel they come
[1:22:14] out of Egypt God brought him out he said
[1:22:20] the other fulfillment was that was the
[1:22:23] greater son he said Jacob was the son
[1:22:25] that came out of Egypt my son has come
[1:22:26] out of Egypt I've called my son out of
[1:22:28] Egypt he's the second one he said was
[1:22:31] the greater son was Jesus Christ come
[1:22:34] out of Egypt and they turned him down
[1:22:38] here again and act and Paul tells him X
[1:22:41] 13 and 46 but seeing you put it from you
[1:22:44] and judge yourselves unworthy of
[1:22:45] everlasting life
[1:22:49] and then What did he say from this day I
[1:22:54] turned to the Gentiles I turn to the
[1:23:00] Gentiles I turn to you and the Gentiles
[1:23:07] rejoiced it wasn't for them reading the
[1:23:11] New Testament Jesus tells his disciples
[1:23:12] do not take this to the Gentiles it
[1:23:15] wasn't for them there was Gentiles
[1:23:19] living in that day that were ordained to
[1:23:21] eternal life when jesus said don't take
[1:23:22] us to him because paul says when he
[1:23:26] turns to the gentiles those that word
[1:23:27] ordained to eternal life accepted it
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:31] so when bought when never Paul does it
[1:23:34] turns around what does he see this is
[1:23:38] what he sees right here in Gentiles
[1:23:40] we're gonna take it we're gonna set up
[1:23:43] boundaries everything that the Jews
[1:23:46] wouldn't take we want it
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:58] I don't remember who it was brother
[1:24:02] Darrell brother Donnie preaching that
[1:24:03] around the first of the year talked
[1:24:05] about Paul doing a full body move and
[1:24:08] turning to the Gentiles and that Gentile
[1:24:10] dispensation started on that body move
[1:24:12] and I got the wonder brother Terry after
[1:24:15] hearing that I'm sitting there listening
[1:24:16] one more and brother Don is preaching
[1:24:18] that I thought how long would the
[1:24:19] Gentiles follow them around how long and
[1:24:23] they followed him around listening and
[1:24:25] hearing this these men speak this word
[1:24:29] and these men refused to speak to him
[1:24:31] before this happened the Gentiles
[1:24:34] actually came up to Paul and said preach
[1:24:35] it to us we want it we want to hear it
[1:24:39] pop and preach it to him he couldn't
[1:24:42] preach it too
[1:24:43] how would you like how would you like to
[1:24:45] be in your life how would you like this
[1:24:49] in town word coming this day and they
[1:24:51] say no it's for people of Kentucky
[1:24:53] Tennesseans you can't have fewer vane to
[1:24:57] turn eternal life you'd follow it around
[1:24:59] you would follow it where everywhere it
[1:25:01] went until they turned and spoke to you
[1:25:04] that's what these Gentiles did they said
[1:25:07] we'll take them possessions any
[1:25:08] possession that they don't want we'll
[1:25:10] take it so they've been that started the
[1:25:16] boundary move the church ages is moving
[1:25:19] boundaries all the way from from Paul up
[1:25:22] to now what did Paul move the boundary
[1:25:27] to what was Paul's boundary on the other
[1:25:32] side you have to be saved through Jesus
[1:25:35] Christ dying on the cross and move that
[1:25:38] boundary past that what was Luther
[1:25:42] Luther found that you had to be
[1:25:44] justified he moved that boundary past
[1:25:46] that Wesley see that you have to be
[1:25:50] sanctified Luther couldn't move his
[1:25:55] boundary past sanctification it wasn't
[1:25:57] his that wasn't given to him and was he
[1:26:00] given him yet Paul couldn't move it
[1:26:02] through sanctification justification it
[1:26:03] wasn't given to him it pentacle
[1:26:10] Hoover past the holy ghost pouring over
[1:26:13] the Holy Spirit Malik had four and five
[1:26:19] would it push it back who you really are
[1:26:24] he said boundaries past who you are and
[1:26:28] what that encompassed everything that
[1:26:30] God had for you then boundaries can't go
[1:26:32] any further the problem is that we
[1:26:37] refuse to see where the boundaries are
[1:26:39] at we've set up our own little
[1:26:41] boundaries in our life and we get them
[1:26:43] up around our feet and we can't walk we
[1:26:45] can't move but God says I've set these
[1:26:48] boundaries here if you get your human
[1:26:51] nature out of the way
[1:26:52] if you get your human eyes out of the
[1:26:54] way and you see everything that I've got
[1:26:56] for you you won't need your boundaries
[1:26:58] you can use mine
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:11] I'm getting away I'm not gonna get to
[1:27:13] everything I apologize
[1:27:17] prodigal son I'm gonna skip some stuff
[1:27:19] prodigal son I love the story about the
[1:27:23] prodigal son and possession so much
[1:27:26] because look what he took with him look
[1:27:30] what he took with him and look what he
[1:27:31] left he took his own possessions with
[1:27:34] him they didn't last you know you can
[1:27:41] you can pile up all the worldly
[1:27:42] possessions there's some people that
[1:27:45] just have to have stuff there's nothing
[1:27:48] wrong with that everybody's different
[1:27:51] people have to have stuff this guy had
[1:27:54] to have stuff told his daddy give me
[1:27:57] what's mine let me have it that he's
[1:28:00] rich and he took it with him and it took
[1:28:06] it took tests and trials for him to see
[1:28:08] that everything that he truly owned he
[1:28:11] had left it back at home everything that
[1:28:14] was really his he left it at home
[1:28:18] everything the daddy had was his daddy
[1:28:22] proved it when he came back put his robe
[1:28:24] on him killed the best calf he had put
[1:28:27] his ring on him everything that God the
[1:28:33] best that God has let me put it that way
[1:28:35] the best that God has belongs to you
[1:28:39] when you realize who you are
[1:28:41] I put a note down here when you realize
[1:28:44] who you are and you've staked a claim to
[1:28:45] all that God has for you Satan don't
[1:28:48] want to be on that land when you realize
[1:28:52] when you get a revelation of this is
[1:28:55] mine he don't want to be on that because
[1:28:57] he knows he's got to fight
[1:29:00] let's stand together
[1:29:04] [Applause]
[1:29:17] mother Branham says in Abraham c59
[1:29:21] you're an heir to it air of salvation
[1:29:23] air of divine healing air of every
[1:29:25] tempted blessing Jesus died for you are
[1:29:27] the heir to it for you are Abraham see
[1:29:30] your air of the whole thing the whole
[1:29:33] thing not in part the whole thing he
[1:29:36] says I feel religious now that I'm an
[1:29:38] air you may think I'm just a little
[1:29:40] crazy but if I am just leave me alone
[1:29:42] I'm more happy that way then I was the
[1:29:44] other way I said I like this way the
[1:29:46] best but I know that I'm an heir heir of
[1:29:49] salvation heir of every promise this is
[1:29:51] why you Pentecostal people you sing
[1:29:53] every promise in the book is mine every
[1:29:55] chapter every verse every line then act
[1:29:57] like it rock around and see what see
[1:30:00] what you got in here it's all of yours
[1:30:01] your heir to it so walk around take
[1:30:04] possession it belongs to you God gave it
[1:30:06] to you what a beautiful promise that you
[1:30:10] might say you Billy Joe I don't I don't
[1:30:12] think it I have I have enough faith to
[1:30:17] claim that I try so hard but it's so
[1:30:19] hard it's I struggle against the devil
[1:30:25] I've probably I know I've read this
[1:30:28] scripture probably with half of sermons
[1:30:31] I preached here but I'm going to read it
[1:30:32] again
[1:30:33] James 4:7 submit yourselves to God
[1:30:38] resist the devil and he will flee the
[1:30:42] other day I decided to look up the word
[1:30:44] resist it does not say submit yourselves
[1:30:49] to God calling an army an airstrike call
[1:30:52] nine-one-one and he will flee that word
[1:30:56] resist means just don't move be
[1:31:00] unmovable you've claimed your land so
[1:31:04] stay on it and don't move you don't have
[1:31:08] to call a prayer meeting because the
[1:31:09] devil's coming up against you don't move
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:15] you see but Joe I don't know if I have I
[1:31:18] don't have enough in me for that and
[1:31:24] studying this sermon I preached in
[1:31:26] Arizona about power of words I got the
[1:31:32] looking deeper into Legion yeah everyone
[1:31:38] have to forgive me a minute and when I
[1:31:41] was reading region Legion that I recall
[1:31:45] brother Donnie preaching that sermon but
[1:31:48] how many angels it took to put Satan
[1:31:49] into the pit one angel didn't even give
[1:31:56] him a name a nameless angel so he wasn't
[1:32:00] very highly ranked one angel put him in
[1:32:05] the pit now I was reading in the maniac
[1:32:13] of Ghaderi so the Legion had two
[1:32:17] thousand demons on him mm but he had
[1:32:23] enough we sit here we complained about
[1:32:28] the little test in the trials that we go
[1:32:30] through
[1:32:31] you claim there's no more greater in
[1:32:33] your life to Jesus Christ and you
[1:32:36] complain about the tests and the trials
[1:32:38] that we have to go through the pain that
[1:32:40] you have to go through and this is a man
[1:32:43] with 2,000 demons and he had enough
[1:32:45] inside of him that Jesus heard him from
[1:32:50] other the other side of the sea because
[1:32:56] God placed something in him before the
[1:32:58] foundation of the world without that he
[1:33:01] didn't ever been able to get free Jesus
[1:33:03] wouldn't hurt anything else but the
[1:33:05] Father calling from him when that seed
[1:33:08] spoke
[1:33:12] and you struggle from day to day and
[1:33:16] feel like you can't make it we I say we
[1:33:21] not you us everybody we're human but the
[1:33:26] part of that but I have a problem with
[1:33:27] this Legion never had the Holy Ghost
[1:33:30] Holy Ghost wasn't sent yet he found
[1:33:38] somebody that would hear him
[1:33:41] there was something down in there
[1:33:43] greater than 2,000 demons can you think
[1:33:51] anybody greater than that but Jesus
[1:33:55] would come to live inside of you that
[1:33:59] God would would we'll play something
[1:34:02] down and you loved you so much before we
[1:34:04] even before you were even born for this
[1:34:06] world was ever born God had you in his
[1:34:08] mind that he loved you so much
[1:34:09] they'd placed a part of him down inside
[1:34:11] of you he loved Legion so much that he
[1:34:14] placed a part of him down there I can't
[1:34:16] wait to find out his real name brother
[1:34:17] Terry I want to find him because if you
[1:34:23] claim that you can't you got the Holy
[1:34:24] Ghost and then you kill him but you
[1:34:26] can't make it through Laodicea he's
[1:34:27] gonna stand against you on Judgment Day
[1:34:32] let's say I had two thousand two
[1:34:35] thousand demons on me I do have a
[1:34:37] backache that's life but that's the
[1:34:44] truth I don't I don't mean to be hard
[1:34:45] but that's the truth we're soft they
[1:34:49] were in a battle but he's gay he's
[1:34:51] giving you everything that you need for
[1:34:52] this battle he's giving you everything
[1:34:55] we want to have no excuses when we leave
[1:34:59] here brother Greg will have no excuses
[1:35:01] you have nothing no reason not to make
[1:35:04] it through everything that comes your
[1:35:05] way
[1:35:06] no reason because there's no one greater
[1:35:08] than Jesus and you claim that he lives
[1:35:11] inside of you
[1:35:12] let him do the fighting God told you in
[1:35:16] a visitor I'll drive him out for you
[1:35:17] I'll Drive him out I told you the same
[1:35:21] thing
[1:35:22] but the hair can we sing that song
[1:35:24] there's no one greater than Jesus let's
[1:35:28] worship him a little bit I didn't mean I
[1:35:30] really didn't mean to hold you this long
[1:35:35] [Applause]
