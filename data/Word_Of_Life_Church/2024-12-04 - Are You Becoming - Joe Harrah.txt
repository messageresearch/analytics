[31:47] hope.
[31:50] Then came the morning
[31:53] that sealed the promise.
[31:57] Your buried body
[32:01] began to breathe.
[32:04] And out of silence,
[32:08] the roaring lion
[32:12] declared, "The grave has no blame on
[32:17] me."
[32:19] Then came the morning
[32:23] that sealed the promise.
[32:27] ordinary body
[32:30] began to breathe.
[32:34] Out of the silence,
[32:37] the roaring lion
[32:41] declare the grave has no claim on me.
[32:49] Jesus, yours is the victory.
[32:56] Hallelujah.
[32:59] Praise the one who set me free.
[33:03] Hallelujah.
[33:07] Death has lost its grip on me. You have
[33:11] broken every chain. There's salvation in
[33:16] your name. Jesus Christ, my livinging
[33:22] hope.
[33:25] Hallelujah.
[33:28] Praise the one who set me free.
[33:32] Hallelujah.
[33:35] Death has lost its grip on me. You have
[33:40] broken every chain. There's salvation in
[33:44] your name. Jesus Christ my livinging
[33:50] hope.
[33:53] Jesus Christ my livinging
[33:58] hope.
[34:00] Oh God
[34:03] you are my livinging
[34:07] hope.
[34:10] [Music]
[34:16] [Applause]
[34:42] [Music]
[34:59] I
[35:00] was rich.
[35:02] I remember who I was.
[35:07] I was lost.
[35:09] I was blind.
[35:11] I was running out of time.
[35:16] Sin
[35:18] separated.
[35:20] The breach was far too wide.
[35:23] But from the far side of the castle,
[35:28] you held me in your sight.
[35:32] So you
[35:34] made a way
[35:36] across the great divide.
[35:40] Left behind
[35:42] heaven's throne
[35:44] to build it here inside.
[35:49] And there at the cross
[35:53] you pay the debt I owe. Broke my chains,
[35:58] freed my soul. For the first time I had
[36:03] hope.
[36:05] Thank you Jesus for the blood
[36:11] applied.
[36:13] Thank you Jesus. You have washed me
[36:19] white.
[36:21] Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life.
[36:30] brought me from the darkness into
[36:34] glorious
[36:36] light.
[36:38] [Music]
[36:44] You took my place, laid inside the tomb
[36:49] of sin.
[36:51] You were buried for three days, but then
[36:56] you walked right out again.
[36:59] And now death has no sting and life has
[37:05] no end.
[37:07] For I have been transformed
[37:11] through the blood of the lamb.
[37:16] Thank you Jesus for the blood
[37:21] of life.
[37:24] Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white.
[37:31] Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life.
[37:41] Brought me from the darkness into
[37:45] glorious
[37:47] light.
[37:51] For there is nothing stronger than the
[37:55] wonderworking
[37:57] power of the blood.
[38:02] The blood
[38:06] calls the sons and daughterers.
[38:10] We are ransom by your father through the
[38:14] blood.
[38:17] Love the blood.
[38:22] There is nothing stronger
[38:25] than the wonder working power of the
[38:30] blood.
[38:33] The blood.
[38:37] Thank you Jesus for the blood
[38:42] of life.
[38:44] Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white.
[38:52] Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life.
[39:03] [Music]
[39:04] Oh, you brought me from the darkness
[39:09] into glorious
[39:12] life.
[39:16] Gloryy
[39:19] to his name.
[39:25] Oh, gloryy
[39:28] to
[39:29] his name.
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] For there to my heart was the blood
[39:42] applied.
[39:44] All gloryy
[39:47] to
[39:48] his
[39:50] name.
[39:52] [Music]
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:14] [Music]
[40:25] One day I heard a voice. He said, "Make
[40:29] me your choice. I'll drive away your
[40:33] every care and set you free."
[40:38] So I came to him that day and he washed
[40:44] my sins away. Now I don't want nothing
[40:49] here to hinder me.
[40:54] Oh, I don't want
[40:58] nothing here to hinder me.
[41:02] [Music]
[41:04] for someday his precious face I long to
[41:10] see.
[41:13] It makes no difference what the cost
[41:18] or how heavy
[41:20] be the cross for. I don't want
[41:25] nothing here to hinder me.
[41:29] [Music]
[41:32] Sometimes I'm tossed about.
[41:36] Oh, many times
[41:38] I do without.
[41:40] Oh, many times my heart is filled with
[41:45] grief and pain.
[41:49] But I know if I will stand true. I know
[41:54] that he will see me through if I don't
[41:59] let
[42:01] nothing here
[42:03] hinder me.
[42:06] Oh, I don't want
[42:10] nothing here, Lord, to hinder me.
[42:16] for someday
[42:18] his precious face I long to see.
[42:25] Oh, it makes no difference what the cost
[42:30] or how heavy may be my cross.
[42:35] I don't want nothing here to hinder me.
[42:41] [Music]
[42:44] Now someday when I get home
[42:48] where I never more shall roam with my
[42:54] savior
[42:55] and my loved ones
[42:58] I shall sing. Hallelujah.
[43:01] Lord I'll lay this old cross down and
[43:07] receive
[43:09] a shining crown. I'll be so glad
[43:14] nothing here did hinder me.
[43:19] Oh, I'm so glad
[43:22] nothing here did hinder me.
[43:27] [Music]
[43:29] For someday
[43:31] his precious face, Lord, I long to see.
[43:38] Oh, it makes no difference
[43:41] what the cost
[43:43] or how heavy
[43:45] maybe the cross.
[43:48] Oh, I don't want

[43:59] nothing here to hinder me.
[44:05] Oh, for someday his precious his
[44:09] precious face I long to see.
[44:15] It makes no difference
[44:18] what the cost or how heavy
[44:22] is my cross.
[44:25] I don't want
[44:27] nothing here to hinder me.
[44:33] Oh, it makes no difference
[44:36] what the cost,
[44:39] Lord, how heavy.
[44:41] Maybe my cross.
[44:43] I'll be so glad
[44:46] nothing here
[44:48] did hinder me.
[44:52] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[44:58] Amen. Enjoy. enjoy our specials tonight.
[45:02] Amen. Very good. All three of them.
[45:04] Thank the Lord. Brother Joe's going to
[45:05] come bring us the word of the Lord
[45:07] tonight. We're going to pray for our
[45:08] brother.
[45:09] We're going to say amen to the word,
[45:11] right? Amen. Let's just sing. We haven't
[45:14] sang it in a long time. Only believe.
[45:16] All things are possible. Only believe.
[45:19] Let's sing that tonight.
[45:23] Only
[45:25] believe.
[45:28] [Music]
[45:29] Only
[45:31] believe
[45:34] that all things
[45:37] are possible.
[45:41] Only
[45:43] believe.
[45:46] Yes. Only
[45:49] believe.
[45:53] Only
[45:55] believe.
[45:58] that all things are possible.
[46:05] Only
[46:07] believe now. Lord, I believe. Lord,
[46:12] I believe.
[46:15] Oh Lord,
[46:18] I believe
[46:22] that all things
[46:25] are possible.
[46:28] Lord, I
[46:30] believe.
[46:33] Yes, Lord,
[46:36] I believe.
[46:39] Lord,
[46:42] I believe
[46:45] that all things are possible.
[46:51] Lord, I
[46:54] believe.
[46:57] Amen. We appreciate Brother Joe, don't
[46:59] we? Give me a good hand tonight if you
[47:12] as simple as that.
[47:13] Believe.
[47:15] God didn't ask us to do anything that
[47:17] was too far out above our reach. Didn't
[47:21] ask us to go through any rituals,
[47:24] make any sacrifices. He said, "Only
[47:26] believe." It's as simple as that.
[47:30] trusting tonight that you're believing
[47:31] that he'll come tonight
[47:33] because if he don't, we're all in a
[47:34] world of hurt because I'll be just up
[47:37] here giving you my own ideas and
[47:40] opinion. So, um it's an honor, always an
[47:43] honor to speak to the bride of Christ,
[47:46] especially at home. I'm thankful for
[47:49] that. This is the greatest bunch of
[47:52] people to preach to if that's what you
[47:53] call what I do. But uh I I I really
[47:58] enjoy enjoy being before y'all and I
[48:01] pray the Lord will bless you. If you
[48:03] have your Bibles going to read turn to
[48:08] St. John 1. This is a sermon that I
[48:11] preached about three weeks ago in
[48:12] Virginia.
[48:14] And I was telling brother Jimmy I just
[48:16] couldn't get away from it. Um I've been
[48:18] making notes, more notes. I think my
[48:21] notes have doubled.
[48:24] But um if you heard it before or you
[48:26] were there, I apologize
[48:29] um if I bore you with repetition. So um
[48:32] but hopefully the Lord has a purpose.
[48:36] So in John 1 and 1, we're going to read
[48:38] the first verse. Then we're going to
[48:40] jump down and read John 10 uh chapter 1
[48:43] verse 10 through 14. So very familiar
[48:46] scripture. In the beginning was the word
[48:48] and the word was with God and the word
[48:50] was God. And he was in the world, and
[48:53] the world was made by him, and the world
[48:56] knew him not. He came unto his own, and
[48:59] his own received him not. But as many as
[49:01] received him, this is me and you. To
[49:05] them gave he power to become sons of
[49:07] God, even to them that believe on his
[49:10] name, which were born not of blood, nor
[49:13] of the will of the flesh, nor of the
[49:14] will of man, but of God. And the word
[49:16] was made flesh. That's what we're going
[49:18] to dwell on here tonight was the word
[49:21] was made flesh
[49:23] and dwelt among us. And we beheld his
[49:26] grace and the glory as of the only
[49:28] begotten of the father full of grace and
[49:30] truth. Let us pray.
[49:33] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful,
[49:35] Lord, that you allowed us another day to
[49:37] sit around your word, Lord.
[49:39] Lord, the people come here tonight,
[49:41] Lord, your your bride has come with
[49:43] needs. There's not a person in here that
[49:45] don't have a need, including myself.
[49:47] Father, where you're a needy people, but
[49:50] Lord, you you were you said you would be
[49:53] the supplier of all our needs. Lord, you
[49:54] will be our Jehovah Gyra, our provider,
[49:56] Father. Lord, in part of providing for
[49:59] us, Lord, you've given us your word.
[50:01] You've given us, Lord, strength for the
[50:04] journey to to go on, Lord. And we we've
[50:06] come here tonight for that, Lord. Is
[50:09] Lord, I know I could I make a mess of
[50:11] it. I do every time I'm up here, Father.
[50:13] But I pray somehow some way, Lord, that
[50:15] you can take the words from my mouth and
[50:17] put them together. Father, that they
[50:19] could land on a heart somewhere,
[50:22] Lord, and provide something for that
[50:24] person, Lord. You see the needs, Lord.
[50:26] You see the the prayer cloth we have,
[50:28] Lord. You see the need behind it where
[50:29] it's going. We're believing you, Father,
[50:31] that you'll work a work. We welcome you
[50:34] tonight, Lord. We ask you to be here. We
[50:36] pray that you bless your word in Jesus
[50:37] name. Amen. You can be seated.
[50:42] what I want to speak on tonight and
[50:45] as we look at this the word was made
[50:47] flesh and the word made there means to
[50:50] become.
[50:52] So God we we we learn in chapter in in
[50:55] verse one that the word was God
[50:58] and then the word was made flesh. So
[51:01] that word is to become to come into
[51:03] being to happen to be made to be done.
[51:06] Vincent translates it this word means to
[51:09] come into being manifestation implying
[51:11] emotion movement or growth. Thus it is
[51:15] used for God's actions as ismer emerging
[51:17] from eternity and becoming in time.
[51:22] So this is a process that God puts
[51:25] himself through.
[51:27] God puts himself into a process if you
[51:30] we want to look at that way. You know,
[51:33] we look at him as the create creator.
[51:35] How he just spoke words and then planets
[51:37] came came to be, light came to be,
[51:40] animals, everything came to be. And this
[51:41] is the great creator. And all he has to
[51:44] do is speak and things happen. And we we
[51:48] know as is we've heard the message in in
[51:50] this in our last day where brother
[51:52] Brandham says that he wasn't even God
[51:54] yet. When he was alone, he dwelt in in
[51:58] in this big mass of eternity with
[52:00] nothing there but himself. Yeah.
[52:03] And he was he was alone. So he began to
[52:06] speak.
[52:08] He had to create create something just
[52:10] to worship him.
[52:12] Yeah.
[52:13] So we we we look at this and we we we
[52:16] see that this is God put himself
[52:20] through a process.
[52:22] And you you you we we look at it and and
[52:24] we see all that he created and what was
[52:27] God had to have a reason for all of
[52:29] this.
[52:30] Amen. You know, like I've always I' I've
[52:32] said it here before and I've said it so
[52:34] many times that that God's reason when
[52:37] he said, "Let there be light." When when
[52:39] we open up and read Genesis chapter 1
[52:41] and and God is saying, "Let there be and
[52:44] let there be." His his very purpose
[52:48] was you.
[52:50] Your main purpose was when when he said
[52:53] let there be was that was this God's
[52:55] process of starting getting himself to
[52:58] you. Amen.
[53:00] So God puts himself through this
[53:01] process. And brother Brandham says in
[53:02] the fifth seal now quietly, reverently
[53:05] before God as we seen the seal opened to
[53:09] us, God has taken his own beloved
[53:11] children and blind their eyes and and
[53:14] sin them because his own justice
[53:16] requires judgment of sin. Think of it.
[53:18] His justice and his holiness requires
[53:21] justice. A penalty, a law without a
[53:24] penalty is not law. and his own laws
[53:28] himself. He was the law. He cannot defy
[53:33] and still remain God.
[53:36] That's the reason God had to become man.
[53:40] So God puts himself through a becoming,
[53:46] you know, and I was studying this and I
[53:49] wondered when when God be this creation,
[53:52] we know as brother Brandham said, all
[53:54] this stuff was already in his mind
[53:55] before he ever spoke it. Everything God
[53:57] has ever done was already in his mind
[54:00] before he ever spoke it. And this
[54:03] process begins to happen as he he says
[54:06] these words and he watches it. that he
[54:08] speaks he this this one of the his final
[54:10] creation that he he that he speaks is
[54:13] man. Let us make man is in our own
[54:15] image. After that God begin to do things
[54:20] using what he created
[54:22] because here is Adam in his own image.
[54:26] And God begins to use what he's created
[54:30] the land, the dust, the elements.
[54:34] He doesn't speak that body form of Adam.
[54:37] He pulls what he already made
[54:41] and wraps it around his image.
[54:45] I hope you understand that tonight.
[54:48] He took what he made.
[54:53] This is you and me.
[54:56] When you thought you was nothing, you
[54:58] thought you were just dirt.
[55:02] Why would God ever save anything like
[55:04] you? He took what you call dirt and
[55:07] wrapped that around his image.
[55:10] This was God becoming.
[55:14] But as I was studying this, I got to
[55:16] wondering what was going through God's
[55:18] mind when it begin to fall apart.
[55:23] What did God think
[55:25] when he come walking through the garden?
[55:27] Remember all the times brother Brandon
[55:29] said he would come to that garden, lay
[55:30] under that big tree. That was his
[55:31] cathedral.
[55:33] and he would lay him down and
[55:36] put him to sleep.
[55:40] He would come walk through the garden in
[55:42] the morning and wake him up.
[55:46] And then he come walking through the
[55:47] garden one day and it it was different.
[55:52] Something had went wrong in God's
[55:54] creation.
[55:58] We know this wasn't taking God's
[56:01] surprise. This was just God becoming
[56:05] This was God's eternal plan
[56:08] to become something.
[56:11] God could not be his savior or a
[56:14] redeemer
[56:16] until his plan fell apart.
[56:20] So we look at this and we we we know
[56:22] that we see the fall of man and you know
[56:25] we we wonder you know God had this plan.
[56:28] Brother brother Brandham said it in
[56:29] investments. God coming down to become
[56:32] man to die.
[56:35] God could not die as a spirit.
[56:39] He is eternal. He could not die. God
[56:41] could make himself in such a way that he
[56:43] could feel pain
[56:45] and he could feel and he could suffer.
[56:49] God could not suffer as the eternal
[56:51] spirit. But when he becomes man, he
[56:53] could suffer and feel the pain, the
[56:54] temptations that man went through like
[56:56] Adam and Eve in the garden.
[56:58] In everyone sense
[57:01] he had to become that in or in order to
[57:04] fulfill his own law to take upon himself
[57:08] his own law. He could not have been the
[57:10] second person. He could not have been
[57:12] the third person. He could not have been
[57:14] any nothing else.
[57:17] He had to be
[57:20] this is God becoming.
[57:25] You know we look at ourselves. God is
[57:27] wanting us to become something.
[57:29] Yeah.
[57:30] That's what I want to get to tonight
[57:32] when I ask the question, are you
[57:34] becoming?
[57:36] So God is is would not allow himself
[57:41] allow you to go through something that
[57:43] he hasn't been through himself.
[57:46] And you have to understand something.
[57:48] God just didn't feel loss
[57:52] when he became flesh.
[57:55] Read Genesis 6
[57:58] said he repented that he made man and it
[58:01] grieved his hearts. Grieved his heart.
[58:04] It vexed his heart. This definition says
[58:06] it was to carve. It carved God's heart
[58:10] to watch what he did.
[58:14] EVEN THOUGH GOD PUTS you through things,
[58:16] when God puts you through things in your
[58:18] life, do you think that he he looks at
[58:20] the eternal purpose of why you're going
[58:22] through it and thinks it's okay?
[58:25] That God's happy with it that you're
[58:27] going through it. God feels for you.
[58:30] God goes through it with you,
[58:32] right?
[58:33] His eternal purpose, his vision of
[58:35] yourself is the same thing he wants you
[58:37] to have of yourself. Look beyond YOUR
[58:39] TRIALS. LOOK BEYOND your test. LOOK AT
[58:42] THE END OF YOUR BECOMING.
[58:44] AMEN.
[58:45] What you're coming to be.
[58:46] Amen.
[58:48] You know, and when I was studying this,
[58:50] I thought, how wonderful it been if if
[58:52] God could have just created Jesus
[58:54] Christ,
[58:57] right there at the beginning.
[59:00] Why couldn't he?
[59:02] He could have created Jesus right then.
[59:06] You and I WOULD HAVE ADAM AND Eve would
[59:08] been spoken. Everybody after them would
[59:10] have been spoken. Life would have been
[59:12] great.
[59:16] You and I would have been spoken
[59:19] into eternity. It would have never died.
[59:24] BUT GOD HAD SO MANY ATTRIBUTES,
[59:26] RIGHT?
[59:28] He didn't want TO BE KNOWN JUST AS God
[59:30] the creator.
[59:31] That's all we would have known him as.
[59:34] God the creator.
[59:36] But God says, "I have to become because
[59:38] there's so much more of me that I want
[59:41] to show you.
[59:43] There's so much more of myself that I
[59:45] want to give my bride."
[59:48] And so God started this fall right off.
[59:52] Right off the very first two people that
[59:54] he created, God allowed them fall. He
[59:56] didn't allow creation, man, male and
[59:58] female, to to uh procreate and keep on
[1:00:02] going. And and then he after a while,
[1:00:04] you know, I guess it's my time. God was
[1:00:06] in a hurry to get to you.
[1:00:09] God wanted to get to you more than you
[1:00:11] ever wanted to get to him.
[1:00:12] That's right.
[1:00:13] So God let the very two first two human
[1:00:16] beings that he created, he let him fall.
[1:00:20] And then we read in in in Genesis 6, it
[1:00:24] repented the Lord that he had made man
[1:00:25] and grieved him in his heart. God saw
[1:00:28] the wickedness of na man man and the
[1:00:30] envy and that every imagination of the
[1:00:33] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:00:36] continually.
[1:00:39] But we we read far f far f far f far f
[1:00:40] far f far f far f far f far f far f far
[1:00:40] farther you know genesis 6 says that all
[1:00:43] flesh all flesh was corrupted.
[1:00:46] Everything he created every bit of flesh
[1:00:48] was corrupted. It was gone.
[1:00:51] And we see Noah, the Bible says Noah w
[1:00:55] was just before the Lord, but it never
[1:00:59] said he was perfect
[1:01:01] like he did Job.
[1:01:05] What if what if if God if God had
[1:01:07] destroyed Noah, he'd had to start all
[1:01:08] over.
[1:01:10] He'd had to start all over. So God had
[1:01:12] to become through Noah.
[1:01:15] So he gave Noah grace.
[1:01:17] Yes. This is where we see God handing
[1:01:19] out his grace to an individual. Noah
[1:01:21] found grace in the eyes of God.
[1:01:24] You know, we we we wonder, you know,
[1:01:27] it's like when you read you read Job,
[1:01:29] you know, we're taught that Job is one
[1:01:30] of the oldest books in the Bible. And we
[1:01:32] we look at Job and you know, after I
[1:01:34] read Genesis 6, I got to thinking about
[1:01:37] Job.
[1:01:39] God's heart is grieved. And then we we
[1:01:41] look at Job and all that Job is going
[1:01:43] through. You you think that God is
[1:01:45] sitting up there and he's the one that
[1:01:47] offered Job to to Satan and and he's
[1:01:50] sitting up there proud and happy about
[1:01:51] what's going on. He knew what Job was
[1:01:53] going through because God had already
[1:01:55] lost everything that he made anyway.
[1:01:58] He'd been through loss. He'd been
[1:02:00] through grief.
[1:02:02] It wasn't that God was just sitting up
[1:02:03] there and he's just comeomaos and and
[1:02:06] not caring what's happening to Job,
[1:02:08] but he knew what Job would become after,
[1:02:10] right?
[1:02:13] And God shows the process through Job.
[1:02:16] What God lost, he redeemed back. What
[1:02:19] Job lost, it was redeemed back to him.
[1:02:23] This is the process of God becoming.
[1:02:29] So we look at God, he become he become
[1:02:32] time so you could become eternity. He
[1:02:34] became mortal so you could put on
[1:02:36] immortality. He became sin, your sin,
[1:02:40] so you could become his righteousness.
[1:02:44] And we're told in souls that are in
[1:02:45] prison that you became his perfection.
[1:02:47] He became sick so you could be healed.
[1:02:50] He became depressed so you could have
[1:02:53] joy.
[1:02:54] He became anxiety so you could have
[1:02:57] peace.
[1:02:58] Right?
[1:02:59] Yeah.
[1:03:00] So all this that he has for you is God
[1:03:03] becoming. In John 1:12, it says, "Be as
[1:03:06] many received him, to them he gave power
[1:03:08] to become the sons of God." Even to them
[1:03:11] that believe on his name, the scripture
[1:03:13] tells us that he he gave them power.
[1:03:18] He gave them power
[1:03:19] to be sons of God. He didn't make them
[1:03:22] sons of God. It says he gave them power
[1:03:24] to be sons.
[1:03:27] He gave it to them.
[1:03:30] You can't do nothing without him.
[1:03:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:34] He didn't make you sovereign all by
[1:03:35] yourself. You and your little world that
[1:03:38] you want to go live on and be by
[1:03:39] yourself and it's just me and God and
[1:03:41] nobody else.
[1:03:43] If you have the same attributes
[1:03:46] that he had, you'll love the body.
[1:03:47] Amen.
[1:03:50] Amen.
[1:03:50] You can't force yourself to be a son and
[1:03:52] daughter of God.
[1:03:56] So, let's look at oursel. If God had to
[1:03:59] become,
[1:04:01] what about us? Yes.
[1:04:03] And what are we becoming?
[1:04:07] Are are we are we are we growing in the
[1:04:09] word?
[1:04:13] Are we growing in the in the in the this
[1:04:15] is this is how we dress ourselves.
[1:04:18] This is how we grow. This is how we eat.
[1:04:20] You don't walk in them doors and leave
[1:04:22] the same.
[1:04:23] Right.
[1:04:24] You come in and you become one thing or
[1:04:26] another.
[1:04:27] Yes. When you come in these doors,
[1:04:29] Brother Bram said, you you will leave
[1:04:31] either better or worse.
[1:04:33] You'll not leave the same.
[1:04:36] And a lot of that is your attitude
[1:04:37] towards this word.
[1:04:39] Not not your attitude to the person up
[1:04:41] here.
[1:04:41] Hallelujah.
[1:04:42] It's it's the attitude to to the word.
[1:04:44] Are you taking applying even if it
[1:04:46] hurts? I know sometimes, you know, I
[1:04:48] have beat myself up all week.
[1:04:50] I have beat myself up all week
[1:04:53] because I was just thinking I say
[1:04:56] hurtful things up here sometimes.
[1:05:00] I don't I don't tailor a message for any
[1:05:04] one person.
[1:05:07] A minister that does that has no place
[1:05:08] right here.
[1:05:10] Has no place.
[1:05:12] But you say things and you know it
[1:05:14] hurts.
[1:05:17] And to me, it's if you you're not where
[1:05:21] you're supposed to be, God will hurt you
[1:05:24] with love to get you
[1:05:26] where he wants you.
[1:05:28] Sometimes God has to force the becoming
[1:05:31] in your life.
[1:05:34] Whether it be through desperation,
[1:05:36] whether it be sickness in the family,
[1:05:38] sickness on you and or depression,
[1:05:40] whatever it might be that God puts in
[1:05:42] your life.
[1:05:43] Yes, sir.
[1:05:43] God wants you to become. And this is one
[1:05:46] of his ways that he's he's he's done it.
[1:05:49] He's he's allowed us to come in here and
[1:05:52] sit under this word and become the word.
[1:05:54] What was the word? The word is God.
[1:05:57] Right?
[1:05:58] So, we're supposed to become BUT GOD
[1:06:00] SAYS, "I WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
[1:06:04] I made myself flesh. I went through
[1:06:07] everything that you went through
[1:06:10] to become you.
[1:06:13] I want you to come in here and become
[1:06:16] me.
[1:06:18] I am the word. A person that stands back
[1:06:22] here and and and speaks the word to you
[1:06:24] is nothing but a vessel. And many times
[1:06:27] they're getting beat up themselves.
[1:06:29] Yeah.
[1:06:32] And God says, "I want you to become the
[1:06:34] word." So when you come in and you sit
[1:06:37] down
[1:06:39] and you put on the word or you don't
[1:06:43] if you do, you will leave better.
[1:06:46] Your becoming process has went further.
[1:06:50] If you do not, you will leave worse.
[1:06:53] Right?
[1:06:53] You will not leave the same as you
[1:06:54] walked in.
[1:06:56] Becoming is a process. The definition is
[1:06:58] movement.
[1:07:00] It is a movement.
[1:07:02] You're moving from one place to another.
[1:07:04] from one form to another, from a one
[1:07:07] person to another person. You should be
[1:07:10] moving from your flesh
[1:07:12] to God.
[1:07:13] Amen.
[1:07:14] That was God's grace on us.
[1:07:18] He became you so you could become him by
[1:07:21] grace.
[1:07:26] So let's ask,
[1:07:28] have you become? So if if time would end
[1:07:32] right now, within one minute from this
[1:07:35] minute, if time would end, could you
[1:07:37] look at your life and say, "I'm I'm
[1:07:39] right where I need to be.
[1:07:42] I have be Lord, I've become you. You can
[1:07:45] take me now. I'll stand and wait for one
[1:07:48] more minute.
[1:07:51] Is your life where it needs to be?
[1:07:54] Have you fully become?"
[1:07:56] Come on now.
[1:07:58] This is God asking you,
[1:08:00] have you fully become,
[1:08:04] would you need a few extra seconds or a
[1:08:07] few breaths of life to make a few things
[1:08:10] right?
[1:08:12] Would you have to go to somebody?
[1:08:15] Yeah.
[1:08:16] Somebody that you turned away, somebody
[1:08:18] that you you you've always been meaning
[1:08:20] to go fellowship with them because
[1:08:21] nobody ever does. Huh?
[1:08:24] You haven't done it.
[1:08:28] And God's holding this last minute for
[1:08:30] you because they might be the last seed.
[1:08:37] Maybe there's someone that had reached
[1:08:38] out to you to try to help you, to pull
[1:08:40] you up, reach out a helping hand, and
[1:08:42] you turned them away. You turned your
[1:08:44] back on them. Maybe it was a person that
[1:08:46] you last person you thought would ever
[1:08:49] come and say hello to you.
[1:08:52] Yeah.
[1:08:53] try to strike up a conversation with you
[1:08:55] and you turn away.
[1:09:02] This is becoming I know this is kind of
[1:09:04] sober, but this is God's looking for a
[1:09:07] body that's like his.
[1:09:09] Yeah.
[1:09:10] That's just like his.
[1:09:12] Brother Brandham said your form, your
[1:09:14] shape, what you're in now is just a
[1:09:17] negative.
[1:09:19] when you come up to around 20 22 year
[1:09:22] years old you're a negative death
[1:09:24] develops the p picture to the positive
[1:09:27] that when this earthly tabernacle be
[1:09:29] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:09:34] just the display now it shows what's
[1:09:36] being done like God becoming God when he
[1:09:39] created angels he becomes son when he
[1:09:42] created Christ Jesus he became savior
[1:09:46] when Jesus died he became healer when he
[1:09:48] was wounded ed for our transgressions
[1:09:50] and with his stripes we were healed. All
[1:09:53] these things are attributes of God just
[1:09:56] so that in the end the Bible said Jesus
[1:09:59] Jesus said you will know that I am in
[1:10:00] the father the father in me and I in you
[1:10:04] and you in me. It's God becoming
[1:10:07] tangible.
[1:10:08] Amen.
[1:10:08] Amen.
[1:10:09] How many knows what tangible is? It's
[1:10:12] perceptible by touch.
[1:10:13] Amen.
[1:10:14] Something you can touch, you can feel.
[1:10:17] How does God do that?
[1:10:19] through me and you.
[1:10:20] Yes,
[1:10:21] that's the process of you becoming God.
[1:10:24] When you touch somebody else's life,
[1:10:30] somebody's looking at you. Somebody's
[1:10:34] there's people that watch you, that look
[1:10:35] you that you sit beside and and mingle
[1:10:38] around with all the time and never say a
[1:10:39] word to. And in their heart, they're
[1:10:41] they're dying hoping that you will.
[1:10:43] Yeah.
[1:10:44] Because everybody else likes you. You
[1:10:47] might be popular. You might be in the
[1:10:49] little click that they want to be in.
[1:10:55] Sometimes people leave not not because
[1:10:58] of what's being preached.
[1:11:00] Sometimes people leave church because
[1:11:02] other people
[1:11:03] That's true.
[1:11:06] This is our chance to become God.
[1:11:09] This is our chance to be God.
[1:11:12] Amen.
[1:11:13] It's not being God to your four best
[1:11:15] friends. No,
[1:11:17] it's not being being God to your mom and
[1:11:19] dad and your brothers and sisters.
[1:11:21] It's being God to those that need him
[1:11:23] the most.
[1:11:24] Yes.
[1:11:25] And sometimes though that that need him
[1:11:27] the most, you don't even know.
[1:11:30] We're all guilty. I'm not point I'm
[1:11:32] guilty.
[1:11:35] I won't say we're all guilty. Some of
[1:11:36] you probably ain't. There's some really
[1:11:38] nice people in here.
[1:11:40] But I I've been guilty. I have been so
[1:11:42] guilty.
[1:11:43] Yeah. And I don't want to be that way.
[1:11:47] I don't I don't want to be that way of
[1:11:48] of shunning somebody because they're not
[1:11:50] at a certain level or or they're too
[1:11:52] high or or whatever. I don't want to be
[1:11:54] that way. I want to I want TO BE BE GOD
[1:11:57] TO SOMEBODY. I WANT TO BE CHRIST TO
[1:11:59] SOMEBODY.
[1:12:00] This will might BE THE ONLY PLACE THEY
[1:12:02] SEE IT.
[1:12:07] He's become intangible in you and I. So
[1:12:10] this is a process.
[1:12:14] Brother Brandham said he become kin
[1:12:15] folks
[1:12:18] that he might raise you up. Before he
[1:12:20] could raise you up, he has to give you
[1:12:21] eternal life. And God had to become kin
[1:12:23] folks who take death to raise you up.
[1:12:27] Then you have to become kin folks with
[1:12:29] him in order to go to the resurrection.
[1:12:31] Yeah.
[1:12:32] You see that? It's just a swap. God
[1:12:35] became you that you might become God.
[1:12:38] GOD BECOME A PART OF YOU FLESH. That's
[1:12:41] the part of you that he became flesh
[1:12:43] that you might be his grace by his grace
[1:12:46] become a part of him. That's to have
[1:12:48] eternal life.
[1:12:50] You know looking at this you wonder
[1:12:54] God just wants to be a father.
[1:12:56] If I can simplify this God just wants to
[1:12:59] be a father.
[1:13:01] You fathers you look at yourself
[1:13:03] especially the ones that have sons.
[1:13:04] Nothing against daughters.
[1:13:07] No nothing against daughters.
[1:13:10] I've never had one. I've got a bunch of
[1:13:13] adopted ones, but I don't I don't have
[1:13:14] one. But a father and a son when he has
[1:13:17] a son, and if if this father is a is a
[1:13:20] man that that he's he's strong, he's a
[1:13:22] hard worker, he has integrity, he has
[1:13:24] respect, he has courage, he likes to
[1:13:27] hunt, he's athletic, whatever. And a
[1:13:29] father has a son, he wants to he wants
[1:13:32] those attributes to be in his son.
[1:13:36] He doesn't want his son to grow up
[1:13:38] liking fashion. Barbie dolls,
[1:13:43] right?
[1:13:44] Video games,
[1:13:47] if he hunts, HE WANTS HIS SON TO HUNT.
[1:13:49] If he fishes, he wants him to fish. If
[1:13:52] he's a hard worker, HE WANTS HIS son to
[1:13:54] be a hard worker. If he respects others,
[1:13:56] HE WANTS HIS SON TO RESPECT OTHERS.
[1:13:58] THAT'S HOW A natural father works.
[1:14:01] If if your heavenly father, one of his
[1:14:03] attributes is forgiveness. He wants you
[1:14:05] to have forgiveness. HIS ATTRIBUTES IS
[1:14:07] GRACE. HE WANTS YOU TO HAVE GRACE. HIS
[1:14:10] ATTRIBUTES IS LOVE. GOD WANTS HIS
[1:14:12] attributes to be in you.
[1:14:15] Amen.
[1:14:16] That's the way he wants his attributes.
[1:14:17] The same as a natural father. I I
[1:14:19] remember my father growing up. And I
[1:14:21] hope you you know, I don't know if
[1:14:23] everybody looks at them the way I do my
[1:14:25] dad, but you know, my dad to me, nobody
[1:14:28] was it better. You know why? Because he
[1:14:31] was my dad. Yeah,
[1:14:33] he was mine.
[1:14:38] I remember
[1:14:40] he he always
[1:14:43] I was always mesmerized and amazed at my
[1:14:46] dad. Still am at his age, 82.
[1:14:50] Philip Martin's dad used to have his
[1:14:52] 13acre lake.
[1:14:55] And I I don't know how many times I
[1:14:57] watch my dad swim the entire perimeter
[1:14:59] of that lake without stopping.
[1:15:04] And I just sit on the dock and watch
[1:15:05] him. Every once in a while I'd jump in
[1:15:07] the water swimmer and I'd get up and
[1:15:08] look, where's my dad? And there he was
[1:15:10] going. He could run forever.
[1:15:15] I remember
[1:15:17] living in when we was living in
[1:15:18] Illinois. He was probably in his 50s
[1:15:19] then. I don't know.
[1:15:21] I was going to go for a run and him and
[1:15:24] David said, "Yeah, we'll go too." And he
[1:15:26] left us.
[1:15:29] I hadn't run in years.
[1:15:32] You know, he had this
[1:15:36] in the Marine Corps. When he get out of
[1:15:37] the Marine Corps, he had this yearbook.
[1:15:47] Everybody that
[1:15:49] graduated boot camp
[1:15:52] are on in this yearbook.
[1:15:55] Us boys look at that thing so much the
[1:15:57] cover fell off.
[1:16:01] The pages fell out.
[1:16:06] When I looked at that book, I was
[1:16:08] looking for one thing.
[1:16:11] One thing
[1:16:15] was looking for my dad.
[1:16:17] care about knowing them other Marines in
[1:16:19] there. Thank you for your service. I
[1:16:22] want to see my dad. I remember pointing
[1:16:25] at pictures at people I thought might be
[1:16:27] him. I say, "Dad, who is this you?" "No,
[1:16:29] that's not me, son."
[1:16:33] I look at that book all the time.
[1:16:41] You got a dad in here.
[1:16:45] You have a dad in here,
[1:16:47] sir.
[1:16:49] How often you look for him?
[1:16:50] Come on.
[1:16:54] There's so much things he's done in
[1:16:56] here.
[1:17:00] Your pages should be falling out.
[1:17:03] His cover should be falling out
[1:17:06] cuz you got a dad in here
[1:17:09] and you want to be just like him.
[1:17:13] You want to become
[1:17:16] just like him.
[1:17:21] Don't show me nothing else.
[1:17:24] Every once in a while I want to hear,
[1:17:26] "Son, you're doing good."
[1:17:29] Yeah.
[1:17:29] And he tells me, I come in here
[1:17:31] Wednesday night sometimes and he says,
[1:17:33] "Son, you're doing good."
[1:17:36] But sometimes I come in Sunday morning,
[1:17:40] you you need to strengthen up right
[1:17:43] there a little bit.
[1:17:46] Why? He wants He wants me to become
[1:17:52] He wants me to become like him.
[1:17:55] He put himself through the whole process
[1:17:57] first.
[1:17:59] He didn't put you into anything that you
[1:18:01] couldn't do.
[1:18:02] Too great. He said, "I'll go first.
[1:18:06] I'll go first.
[1:18:08] I'll become flesh first. I'll get in
[1:18:10] this world first. I'll face sin first.
[1:18:15] I'll face temptation first. I'll face
[1:18:17] lust first. I'll face depression first.
[1:18:20] I'll face it all first.
[1:18:25] That way I'll show you
[1:18:28] you can do all things.
[1:18:31] Amen.
[1:18:32] That's God becoming
[1:18:35] And that's God be becoming a new you.
[1:18:41] I know this is not a jumping service. I
[1:18:43] didn't expect it to be because I don't
[1:18:45] feel like jumping.
[1:18:54] I was down there, Brother Ron, and I
[1:18:57] gave this example. Sorry, Malachi and
[1:18:59] Chloe. I'm gonna use y'all again
[1:19:00] tonight.
[1:19:02] The process of you becoming
[1:19:07] started with God,
[1:19:10] started with the man. When it comes to a
[1:19:14] wedding,
[1:19:17] a woman cannot
[1:19:21] become that man unless he first
[1:19:24] proposes.
[1:19:27] So it's like a process.
[1:19:30] it when the the courtship is all
[1:19:32] happening. She's not becoming him. Khloe
[1:19:34] did not become Khloe Spencer when her
[1:19:36] and Malachi started dating.
[1:19:40] She didn't nowhere close.
[1:19:44] If he'd have run off and tried to make
[1:19:46] her Chloe Spencer without her daddy's
[1:19:48] approval, things would have got bad.
[1:19:55] But we see that process and we we we
[1:19:57] look at at at the at the type that the
[1:19:59] Bible uses and the prophet uses as a
[1:20:01] bridegroom
[1:20:03] going to get his bride.
[1:20:06] Until there's a proposal, until there's
[1:20:08] something that says, "Will you be my
[1:20:10] wife?"
[1:20:12] There is no process yet of her becoming
[1:20:16] him.
[1:20:18] But once he gives the proposal, he gets
[1:20:21] down on his knee and he and he offers
[1:20:23] the ring. Will you marry me? When she
[1:20:27] says yes, it has the process has to
[1:20:32] include a yes.
[1:20:35] Because there's some of you that Christ
[1:20:37] has asked, would you be my wife? And you
[1:20:40] still haven't said yes yet.
[1:20:41] Come on.
[1:20:43] Come on. He started the process.
[1:20:46] But you'll never become him until you
[1:20:48] say yes.
[1:20:50] That's good.
[1:20:52] The process happens with an agreement
[1:20:54] between the two.
[1:20:57] The process happens as they come down
[1:20:59] here and they they walk down the aisle
[1:21:01] and they stand before an audience. They
[1:21:03] stand before God and the and the the
[1:21:05] master, the the the pastor and they
[1:21:07] exchange their vows.
[1:21:10] They exchanged their vows and the kiss
[1:21:12] and all that and they turn around and
[1:21:13] the process she has now become him.
[1:21:18] Everything Malachi owns now belongs to
[1:21:21] Chloe.
[1:21:23] I would hide some guns if she ever needs
[1:21:25] money.
[1:21:28] That's the way it works. Everything that
[1:21:30] he has is hers. Everything that Christ
[1:21:33] has is yours. Right.
[1:21:37] That's part of you becoming that that's
[1:21:39] part of this process that that it's not
[1:21:42] just a God don't want to stay an object
[1:21:45] of worship in your life.
[1:21:46] Come on now.
[1:21:47] God don't rem want want to remain just
[1:21:49] that in your life. An object of worship.
[1:21:54] If if that was the case, if God just
[1:21:56] said, I want it to be an object of
[1:21:58] worship,
[1:22:01] we wouldn't need never needed the fall,
[1:22:02] brother Jimmy. We would have never
[1:22:04] needed all the the creation and all
[1:22:06] this. God just created angels. I just
[1:22:08] want to be worshiped. That's all I want
[1:22:09] to be. That was the least thing God
[1:22:12] wanted. The least what he wanted most
[1:22:17] was to be you.
[1:22:22] What you think is the least.
[1:22:24] We're so amazed AT CREATION. WE'RE SO
[1:22:27] AMAZED AT ALL THE PLANETS, the stars,
[1:22:29] and and everything that the galaxies
[1:22:31] beyond. We're so amazed at that. AND WE
[1:22:34] LOOK SO SMALL AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS
[1:22:36] WHOLE PROCESS, WE LOOK SO SMALL.
[1:22:39] AMEN.
[1:22:39] AND YOU ARE THE GREATEST thing in God's
[1:22:41] eyes,
[1:22:42] RIGHT?
[1:22:42] THE GREATEST THING he ever made is you.
[1:22:48] That's what that's the greatest. We look
[1:22:50] at all the stuff
[1:22:52] that's not even eternal.
[1:22:55] We look at things that's not even
[1:22:56] eternal. How great. Oh, look at the
[1:22:58] beauty. And it is beautiful that God did
[1:23:00] this and all this the changing of the
[1:23:03] leaves and and all the flowers. That's
[1:23:06] what your life is doing.
[1:23:09] Your life is going through these
[1:23:11] seasons.
[1:23:11] Yes, it is.
[1:23:12] And God looks at it and says, "Oh,
[1:23:14] that's beautiful.
[1:23:16] That's wonderful.
[1:23:18] It's a process. You know, trees have the
[1:23:20] process and plants of becoming what they
[1:23:23] really are when they put off their
[1:23:25] blooms and their leaves and their
[1:23:26] fruits."
[1:23:27] Amen.
[1:23:32] I'm going to skip. I just got way too
[1:23:34] much notes. So,
[1:23:38] we come in here.
[1:23:42] God wants our life to fit this word. We
[1:23:46] need to become to such a place that our
[1:23:48] life fits this word like a puzzle piece.
[1:23:51] We can put it right in here in this
[1:23:54] Bible and it fits like a puzzle piece.
[1:23:59] So, how do we become? God gave us a
[1:24:01] five-fold ministry.
[1:24:02] Yes.
[1:24:04] That's what their job was. You help my
[1:24:07] bride become me.
[1:24:11] That's the job of the five-fold
[1:24:12] ministry.
[1:24:14] You know, it doesn't matter.
[1:24:17] I'm one.
[1:24:19] Everybody has got their favorite. I
[1:24:21] understand that.
[1:24:23] Brother Donniey's mine, too.
[1:24:27] But you got to understand, we we tend to
[1:24:30] start looking at vessels
[1:24:33] instead of what's in them.
[1:24:35] Yeah.
[1:24:36] Instead of what's pouring out
[1:24:39] this five-fold ministry, we ought Well,
[1:24:40] I I can't I can't really I can't really
[1:24:44] receive from that, brother.
[1:24:48] What are you listening at?
[1:24:51] What What are you What are you listening
[1:24:52] at? Are you listening to him talk by the
[1:24:54] sound of his voice? Are you hearing what
[1:24:56] he's saying?
[1:24:57] That's right.
[1:24:57] That's good.
[1:24:58] Are you listening to the word?
[1:25:02] It doesn't matter
[1:25:03] who's saying it. Let me ask you a
[1:25:05] question. If you found out tomorrow that
[1:25:07] you inherited a million dollars, does it
[1:25:10] matter who tells you about it?
[1:25:13] Does it matter if it's the truth? Does
[1:25:16] it matter who came and told you?
[1:25:20] You get my point?
[1:25:24] Some people STAY HOME WHEN THEIR
[1:25:25] favorite ain't here.
[1:25:27] Yes, sir.
[1:25:29] And you miss an opportunity to become
[1:25:32] amen.
[1:25:34] That's what it is.
[1:25:37] This This is where you come in and you
[1:25:39] grow. This is where you you put on the
[1:25:41] word.
[1:25:42] It doesn't matter who your favorite is.
[1:25:44] We've all been guilty.
[1:25:45] Yes.
[1:25:47] Me, too. Listen, I ain't got no halo up
[1:25:48] here. I don't have a halo. But I do know
[1:25:51] I have a vision of what I want to be and
[1:25:54] I'll do everything to get there.
[1:25:56] I'll do everything to get there.
[1:25:58] Since I've gotten behind here, the Lord
[1:26:01] called me in 2009. Well, he called me in
[1:26:03] 2006. I finally told brother Donnie in
[1:26:05] 2009
[1:26:06] that I would preach.
[1:26:10] I understand now. Brother John, brother
[1:26:12] Pete, brother Jordan, they understand
[1:26:14] what I mean. It's totally It's totally
[1:26:16] different.
[1:26:17] I've done my share of criticizing about
[1:26:19] who was behind here bringing the word.
[1:26:21] It's totally different when you're here.
[1:26:25] It's totally different.
[1:26:28] I wish everybody could try it one time.
[1:26:31] I tried to get brother Jimmy to swap
[1:26:33] with me a while ago. He wouldn't do it.
[1:26:37] But we understand coming to church, it's
[1:26:39] not a tradition. It's a process of
[1:26:42] becoming.
[1:26:43] It's a process on Wednesday night. We
[1:26:45] understand that this this church, the
[1:26:46] new, we've let the new wear off the
[1:26:48] church. The church, the new of the
[1:26:50] church has wore off. Now it was just
[1:26:52] church again. You used to be in the
[1:26:55] front. Now you're in the middle and then
[1:26:56] you move to the back
[1:26:57] because the new is wore off.
[1:27:01] Listen,
[1:27:02] it doesn't matter what the function is.
[1:27:05] If you have a chance to come around the
[1:27:07] bride, you are becoming young people
[1:27:10] missing the the youth services and the
[1:27:14] new is wore off. The new is wore off the
[1:27:16] question and answers. The new is wore
[1:27:17] off the upper room because your buddy
[1:27:20] won't come. You won't come.
[1:27:24] I don't care if it's just getting
[1:27:25] together and playing volleyball. If you
[1:27:26] are around
[1:27:28] people that are members of the bride,
[1:27:30] you have a chance to become higher.
[1:27:32] That's right.
[1:27:32] It's fellowship. Brother Brandon said,
[1:27:34] "God loves fellowship. It ain't all
[1:27:36] about coming and preaching and hearing
[1:27:38] me hear brother Rob or Jonathan King or
[1:27:39] Michael or somebody like that or hearing
[1:27:41] Brother Donnie do question answers." It
[1:27:42] ain't about that. It's about the body
[1:27:45] coming together.
[1:27:49] It's a process. It's becoming. God gives
[1:27:53] us opportunity every time we wake up in
[1:27:54] the morning.
[1:27:56] Every time you take a breath, God says,
[1:27:59] "I gave you a new day to become me.
[1:28:02] I've give you another breath. Use it to
[1:28:04] become me.
[1:28:07] So, in studying this, you know, I got to
[1:28:09] to reading this. I I tell you how I got
[1:28:12] this message. There's a song I hope
[1:28:14] sometime brother Harry gets to sing it.
[1:28:16] It's called I am Becoming. If you
[1:28:18] haven't heard it, I can't wait till he
[1:28:21] sings it. This is about four or five
[1:28:23] months ago. That's how long I've had
[1:28:25] this sermon.
[1:28:28] And then I got to listen to that song.
[1:28:30] And I asked myself the question,
[1:28:33] am I becoming
[1:28:37] if if does God look at my life and
[1:28:40] smile? Is he happy with where I'm at in
[1:28:43] my walk? Everyone in here could ask
[1:28:46] himself that question. Where are you at
[1:28:47] in your walk?
[1:28:50] Where are you at in the word? Where are
[1:28:52] you at in your life? How are you
[1:28:53] treating others? So, let's look at this.
[1:28:57] You know, it had never occurred to me
[1:29:01] whenever I I was studying this
[1:29:05] and John 15 came to my came to mind and
[1:29:08] then it it finally just fell right in
[1:29:10] place.
[1:29:12] Jesus says, "I am the true vine. My
[1:29:15] father is the husbandman."
[1:29:17] A husbandman is a a vine dresser.
[1:29:20] They are the ones that not only do they
[1:29:23] take care of the fruit and all this,
[1:29:24] they nurture the vine,
[1:29:27] the ground around the vine. They make
[1:29:29] sure everything is clean to to promote
[1:29:31] health and growth in in the vine and in
[1:29:34] the branches and in the fruit.
[1:29:37] That's why Jesus didn't say, "I am a
[1:29:39] tree and you are the branches." A
[1:29:41] vineyard needs a husbandman. A tree
[1:29:43] don't.
[1:29:46] Every branch in me that beareth not
[1:29:48] fruit, he taketh away. Every branch that
[1:29:51] beareth fruit, he purchaseth, that he
[1:29:53] may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are
[1:29:56] clean through the world which I have
[1:29:57] spoken unto you abide in me and I in you
[1:29:59] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:30:01] itself except it abide abide in the
[1:30:03] vine. No more can ye except you abide in
[1:30:06] me. You will not bear fruit if he's not
[1:30:08] in you. You will not bear fruit that has
[1:30:10] the life of the vine if you're not in
[1:30:11] him.
[1:30:12] Right?
[1:30:12] Amen.
[1:30:14] I am the vine, ye are the branches. He
[1:30:17] that abideth in me, and I in him, the
[1:30:19] same bringeth forth much fruit. For
[1:30:21] without me, you can do nothing.
[1:30:28] So you wonder, well, how do how does
[1:30:30] this tie into becoming?
[1:30:35] You got to understand this is all about
[1:30:37] the fruit.
[1:30:40] Jesus says, "I am the vine." So what's
[1:30:42] in the vine? The life. God's life
[1:30:44] is in the vine. The vine does not bear
[1:30:47] fruit.
[1:30:50] But this life has to become into
[1:30:52] something.
[1:30:54] It has to be coming in something.
[1:30:57] So it goes into the branches. Who's the
[1:30:59] branches?
[1:31:01] The vine's life should be in the
[1:31:03] branches.
[1:31:05] It's the vine. IT'S THE BRANCHES THAT
[1:31:06] PRODUCE the fruit, not the vine.
[1:31:10] So it all depends on what fruit you're
[1:31:12] producing. We know through through
[1:31:14] science and all that. They're able to
[1:31:15] graft branches in. Brother Brandon have
[1:31:16] used that so many times in in in
[1:31:19] examples how grafting they take a lemon
[1:31:22] tree and they'll graft in a an orange.
[1:31:24] And he says, "What do you think it'll
[1:31:25] bring forth?" It'll still bring forth an
[1:31:27] orange because it don't have the
[1:31:29] original life that's in that lemon tree
[1:31:31] in that branch.
[1:31:33] And there's so many times that we graft
[1:31:35] in things in our life that don't have
[1:31:38] his life. Right.
[1:31:40] So the the the fruit that comes out with
[1:31:43] the it has every fruit has a seed and in
[1:31:46] that seed is the life of the original
[1:31:50] vine.
[1:31:52] That's what it has become
[1:31:55] the fruit. What are your what's the
[1:31:58] fruits that you're given?
[1:32:00] What fruits are you bearing in your
[1:32:01] life? You know, there there's so many
[1:32:03] things that in the process of this this
[1:32:06] vine becoming branches, then becoming
[1:32:08] leaves. And and I did some research on
[1:32:10] this because I'm not very smart. I I'm
[1:32:12] not into plants and stuff. But it says
[1:32:16] when referring to a vine branch,
[1:32:18] becoming signifies the process of
[1:32:20] growing, developing from a small sprout
[1:32:23] into a mature fruitbearing branch
[1:32:26] entirely dependent on its connection to
[1:32:28] the vine for life. and nourishment and
[1:32:32] the ability to produce grapes.
[1:32:34] It embodies the idea of transformation
[1:32:37] and maturation through the dependence on
[1:32:40] the vine itself. It's totally 100%
[1:32:45] dependent on the vine.
[1:32:48] That's the original life source.
[1:32:52] So
[1:32:54] connection to the vine, the branch, the
[1:32:55] branch's entire existence relies on its
[1:32:59] attachment to the vine, drawing life and
[1:33:01] and nutrients. Growth and development.
[1:33:03] As the branch grows, it extends
[1:33:05] outwards, producing leaves and
[1:33:07] eventually developing buds that mature
[1:33:09] into grapes. Fruitfulness, the ability,
[1:33:12] the ultimate becoming of a branch is its
[1:33:15] ability to bear fruit, representing the
[1:33:18] full potential of its connection to the
[1:33:21] vine.
[1:33:22] So, are you bearing fruit?
[1:33:25] How many in here knows
[1:33:28] what the fruits of the spirit are?
[1:33:34] Love, joy, faith, peace, longsuffering.
[1:33:39] That's what we should be bearing.
[1:33:42] That's human nature gets involved so
[1:33:45] many times.
[1:33:46] Human nature takes over our life
[1:33:48] sometimes and and and there's things in
[1:33:50] our life that we we graft in
[1:33:54] that we graft in that we think, well,
[1:33:57] I'm supposed to bear this.
[1:34:00] The only deal is anything you graft in
[1:34:03] to the branch will never have the life
[1:34:06] of the vine. It might produce fruit.
[1:34:11] It might produce bitterness,
[1:34:13] unforgiveness,
[1:34:14] grudges,
[1:34:16] hatred,
[1:34:17] contentment, malice, anything you graft
[1:34:21] in that does not have the life of the
[1:34:22] original vine.
[1:34:25] It's not becoming the vine.
[1:34:29] So, as I was telling the the the people
[1:34:31] there in Virginia, they always wondered
[1:34:33] where a seedless grape came from.
[1:34:36] Yeah,
[1:34:38] I I remember my mom buying them as a kid
[1:34:40] and it mesmerized me. So, it took me 40
[1:34:43] years to figure it out.
[1:34:48] How many does know
[1:34:53] we're going after tonight? You won't be
[1:34:54] able to say that. So, a seedless grape
[1:34:58] once once the the branch that bears the
[1:35:02] the cluster of grapes starts to protrude
[1:35:04] out and starts to bear fruit when it's
[1:35:06] little, doesn't have a seed in it yet,
[1:35:08] they cut it off
[1:35:11] and they stick it in the ground away
[1:35:13] from the vine
[1:35:16] in a in a in a place of soil away and it
[1:35:19] continues to grow
[1:35:21] with no seed.
[1:35:24] There's no life.
[1:35:27] So many we we got a lot of seedless
[1:35:29] grapes hanging on us sometimes.
[1:35:31] It's got no life.
[1:35:33] You know what did God say? What did God
[1:35:35] say? That anything got that does not
[1:35:37] bear fruit of the vine, I will cut it
[1:35:39] off.
[1:35:40] Yeah,
[1:35:40] I will cut it off. Sometimes God has to
[1:35:42] cut things out of our lives.
[1:35:44] You know, and I I don't know.
[1:35:48] Hopefully, it's nobody here. But, you
[1:35:50] know, it's like I I was telling them
[1:35:52] that three weeks ago, it just seems
[1:35:54] like, you know, somehow in my sermon, in
[1:35:56] Brother Donniey's sermon, sermons, I
[1:35:58] went to Kentucky and listened to a
[1:36:00] brother preach there. Everybody's
[1:36:02] preaching about forgiveness.
[1:36:04] Maybe it's God pulling us to this last
[1:36:06] place
[1:36:07] to where we love everybody,
[1:36:10] where we live, where we can forgive.
[1:36:13] And I understand I I'm not in your
[1:36:14] shoes. You might have things in your
[1:36:16] life that is really hard to forgive,
[1:36:21] right?
[1:36:21] You know, it might be hard to forgive.
[1:36:23] You know, we're not God. We can't
[1:36:25] forget. I understand that human nature,
[1:36:27] you can't forget.
[1:36:29] There's people that say they forgive,
[1:36:33] but their mouth says otherwise when that
[1:36:35] certain person's brought up.
[1:36:39] So I encourage you
[1:36:42] if if you have unforgiveness or you have
[1:36:46] forgiven but you can't forget, if that
[1:36:48] person comes up in your your memory or
[1:36:50] or your conversation,
[1:36:53] let your mouth be influenced by
[1:36:55] forgiveness instead of memory.
[1:36:56] Amen.
[1:36:57] It's that simple.
[1:37:00] What comes out of you? Listen to me.
[1:37:03] People that can't that hold grudges and
[1:37:04] they got to be miserable.
[1:37:06] They have to be miserable.
[1:37:09] You can't you can't forgive somebody.
[1:37:11] Like I've said it before, you you'll
[1:37:12] never go in rapture.
[1:37:14] You'll you'll never take it with you.
[1:37:15] And then we we look at the prayer that
[1:37:17] Jesus that Jesus tells the disciples. He
[1:37:19] said, "When you stand praying, forgive
[1:37:21] those because if you don't, your father
[1:37:25] in heaven does not forgive you." That's
[1:37:27] right.
[1:37:28] So the moment unforgiveness
[1:37:32] took root in your heart,
[1:37:35] everything you've done since, God hasn't
[1:37:36] forgave.
[1:37:39] You still hold that.
[1:37:41] You haven't. You might have repented,
[1:37:44] forgiven.
[1:37:45] I just don't understand how somebody can
[1:37:47] repent and ask God forgiveness for
[1:37:48] something they done and they they can't
[1:37:50] forgive somebody. But Jesus says when
[1:37:52] you standing forgive, if you don't
[1:37:55] forgive, God don't forgive you.
[1:37:57] So if you have a root of unforgiveness
[1:38:00] in your heart, the moment it was
[1:38:03] planted, everything you've done since,
[1:38:05] you still own.
[1:38:07] That might sound harsh. You might
[1:38:08] disagree with me.
[1:38:11] I You can prove me wrong if you want.
[1:38:13] I'm not a Bible scholar. All I know what
[1:38:15] it said. If you don't forgive, he don't
[1:38:17] forgive.
[1:38:18] Simple as that.
[1:38:21] Moving on, we we got to move off of
[1:38:23] that.
[1:38:24] Brother Brandham says in the seven
[1:38:26] church ages
[1:38:28] in John 15, Jesus says, "I am the vine.
[1:38:31] You are the branches." He is the main
[1:38:32] vine which comes out of the original
[1:38:34] root from the original seed that has the
[1:38:35] life in it. Now, the vine does not bear
[1:38:37] fruit. It is the branches that does.
[1:38:39] Now, now watch this. You can take a
[1:38:40] citrus tree such as an orange tree and
[1:38:42] graft it into a grapefruit limb, a a
[1:38:45] lemon limb, a tangelo limb, other kinds
[1:38:48] of that varieties. Those limbs will
[1:38:49] grow, but those grafted limbs will not
[1:38:51] bear oranges, which is the original
[1:38:52] fruit. The lemon limb will bear lemons.
[1:38:55] The grapefruit limb will bear grapefruit
[1:38:57] and so on. Yet those limbs will be
[1:38:59] thriving off the life of the tree. But
[1:39:02] if that tree ever puts off another
[1:39:03] branch of itself, it'll be an orange
[1:39:05] branch and bear oranges because the life
[1:39:08] in the limb and the life in the trunk
[1:39:11] are identical. Whereas it it wasn't so
[1:39:13] with the grafted limbs. Those grafted
[1:39:16] branches had their sources in other
[1:39:18] kinds of trees, from other roots, from
[1:39:20] other seeds. Now, they bear fruit, all
[1:39:22] right? But they don't bear oranges. They
[1:39:23] cannot because they are not the
[1:39:25] original.
[1:39:27] As I was saying, people take things in
[1:39:29] their life and they they graft them in.
[1:39:32] You've got people that that that live in
[1:39:34] in in shame and things they've done in
[1:39:37] their life, they hold on to it.
[1:39:41] they to me, you know, look looking at it
[1:39:43] and and I know it's hard sometimes to
[1:39:46] when when you got something in your life
[1:39:47] that you're ashamed of and God's
[1:39:49] forgiven you.
[1:39:52] Sometimes it's hard to see that because
[1:39:55] God just don't come down, sit beside you
[1:39:57] and say, "Buddy,
[1:39:59] daughter, I forgive you."
[1:40:03] Right? It don't happen. God says,
[1:40:04] "Ascept my forgiveness.
[1:40:06] I for I forgave you before the
[1:40:08] foundation of the world." Yeah. And a
[1:40:09] lot of people take this in that this is
[1:40:10] my cross to bear and they graft that in.
[1:40:12] There's no life in it.
[1:40:14] There there's people that that because
[1:40:16] of shame and and embarrassment and
[1:40:18] things they have in their life, they
[1:40:20] they got gifts in their life. They no
[1:40:21] longer give to the bride.
[1:40:25] Things that God's give you and you've
[1:40:26] you've GRAFTED IN A LIMB OF SOMETHING
[1:40:28] that that you feel you still have to
[1:40:30] bear this cross and God's already took
[1:40:31] it from you.
[1:40:33] Come on.
[1:40:33] And you're letting it hold you down from
[1:40:35] growth. You're letting it hold you down
[1:40:36] from becoming what God called you to
[1:40:38] become.
[1:40:40] And God said, "You don't have to live
[1:40:42] that live that way. I took that shame
[1:40:43] from you. I took that transgression from
[1:40:46] you."
[1:40:47] Amen.
[1:40:47] And Satan's going to keep telling you,
[1:40:49] "Well, people are talking. People are
[1:40:51] talking about this so- and so. They
[1:40:52] looked at me. They didn't shake my hand.
[1:40:53] They don't like me because of something
[1:40:55] I've done or whatever." People hold it
[1:40:57] in their lives for years,
[1:40:59] refusing to give it up, and they've had
[1:41:01] it grafted in so long it looks like it's
[1:41:03] part of the tree.
[1:41:07] God said, "I'll cut it off. If it's not
[1:41:10] producing my life, I will cut it off."
[1:41:14] Yes, sir.
[1:41:16] Some of these things God's cutting off,
[1:41:17] we should be rejoicing about.
[1:41:19] Amen.
[1:41:21] When God's cutting guilt and shame out
[1:41:23] of your life should produce joy. Yes.
[1:41:29] And God's cutting depression and anxiety
[1:41:31] out of our lives.
[1:41:34] People get to where they settle for a
[1:41:35] pill.
[1:41:37] This pill makes me feel better. You're
[1:41:39] just like the children of Israel when
[1:41:41] God said, "Push them all out of your
[1:41:42] land. Push them out.
[1:41:44] Every single one of man, woman, and
[1:41:46] child."
[1:41:47] Yeah.
[1:41:47] So that what they do? They pushed them
[1:41:48] in a corner.
[1:41:51] They never Israel, the children of
[1:41:53] Israel never became what God wanted them
[1:41:56] to become. That's true.
[1:41:58] Never. To this day, they've never become
[1:42:01] what God wanted them to become.
[1:42:04] Because they settled.
[1:42:06] The Ammonites, the Malachites, they
[1:42:08] pushed them in a corner and they grafted
[1:42:10] them into the branches.
[1:42:12] They settled. Well, they'll they will
[1:42:15] they will be our farmers. They will tend
[1:42:17] our cattle. They will do this. They will
[1:42:18] build houses for us and all that. You
[1:42:21] settled for a trick of the devil. When
[1:42:22] you just say, "All I got to do is take a
[1:42:24] pill."
[1:42:25] Makes me feel better. Takes this anxiety
[1:42:28] away. Takes There's nothing wrong with
[1:42:29] that. I'm not saying anything wrong with
[1:42:31] the medication.
[1:42:32] I just don't think you should put that
[1:42:34] above God because God made you a
[1:42:35] promise.
[1:42:36] You're sons and daughters of God. And
[1:42:38] God made you a promise and said, "When
[1:42:39] you reaching the point where I want you
[1:42:41] to become, it don't include a pill."
[1:42:43] Amen.
[1:42:44] I gave you total healing. I gave you
[1:42:46] total deliverance. Yes.
[1:42:48] I'm not settling for anything man has.
[1:42:50] If God leads me to take one, fine.
[1:42:54] I don't I don't I don't I'm I can't
[1:42:57] There's a difference between sympathy
[1:42:59] and empath empathy. I get them mixed up.
[1:43:03] But I've never been there. I'm I've
[1:43:05] never thankful to God in heaven by God's
[1:43:07] grace. I've never been a depressed
[1:43:09] person. Never had an anxiety. Never had
[1:43:12] depression. I mean, we all go through
[1:43:14] ups and downs. We all do.
[1:43:16] Yeah. But I've never I've never battled
[1:43:18] that. And and um I pray for people. I
[1:43:21] really do. I pray for people that battle
[1:43:23] because it's real.
[1:43:24] It's real. At this age right now, that
[1:43:26] is one of the most prominent diseases on
[1:43:28] the face of the earth is mental health.
[1:43:30] Yes, sir.
[1:43:31] I've seen it in working it. I've just
[1:43:33] been fortunate to to work in it and and
[1:43:36] not bring it home. It's just God's
[1:43:39] grace.
[1:43:40] Yes, sir.
[1:43:40] But God says you can have deliverance
[1:43:41] for that. Let God prune that off. God's
[1:43:44] putting you through a process of of
[1:43:46] becoming something. He wants to prune
[1:43:47] that off. If it's not bearing his fruit,
[1:43:50] cut it off.
[1:43:53] You say, "Brother Joe, mine not that
[1:43:54] that easy." Maybe it's not. I promise I
[1:43:56] I'll pray for you. I will. And you pray
[1:43:59] for me. I'm sure there's things a lot of
[1:44:01] things in my life that God needs to
[1:44:02] prune off. I'm going to have to hurry up
[1:44:04] here.
[1:44:08] But as we read, we reading and it says
[1:44:10] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:44:12] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:44:14] That's where the vine was rooted in the
[1:44:17] word. So when you got a vine that puts
[1:44:20] out a branch and that branch puts out a
[1:44:22] fruit,
[1:44:25] it puts out a fruit and inside that
[1:44:27] fruit is the evidence.
[1:44:30] It's not the fruit itself.
[1:44:33] inside the fruit is the evidence of the
[1:44:35] life that's in that that vine.
[1:44:38] Yes, sir.
[1:44:39] And so if you
[1:44:41] produce a fruit
[1:44:44] and the seed inside that you it's it's
[1:44:47] all about seeds that you sew, right?
[1:44:50] Where's that seed? It's inside the fruit
[1:44:52] that you bear. If you sew seeds of of
[1:44:55] friendship,
[1:44:57] seeds of love,
[1:45:00] forgiveness,
[1:45:02] peace, joy, longsuffering, that's what
[1:45:04] you'll reap.
[1:45:05] Yes.
[1:45:06] Because when that when that fruit falls
[1:45:08] off in in in the Bible in when he tells
[1:45:11] it in there in in 15 in John 15 when it
[1:45:14] says it comes off, another one comes on.
[1:45:18] When God purges it, that fruit that's
[1:45:21] got the life of the God, God purges
[1:45:23] that. Why? So it will produce more.
[1:45:26] Yes, sir.
[1:45:27] So what happens to that that one that
[1:45:29] gets purged? It falls to the ground.
[1:45:31] Right back into the ground where the
[1:45:33] vine is rooted.
[1:45:35] Yes, sir.
[1:45:36] Right back into the word. And it matches
[1:45:40] and blends right back into the word. And
[1:45:42] that seed will produce the same life
[1:45:45] that is in the original vine.
[1:45:49] That's how you That's how you know if
[1:45:51] that life is in you.
[1:45:52] Yes, sir.
[1:45:53] You know, we talk about signs and
[1:45:54] wonders. We talk about gifts. We want
[1:45:56] these things these gifts to come to come
[1:45:59] amongst us in the church. You know,
[1:46:00] you're wondering where where's the gifts
[1:46:02] at? Maybe you're the one that God's
[1:46:05] waiting to use.
[1:46:09] You you got anything in your life
[1:46:12] that's hindering these gifts from
[1:46:13] moving?
[1:46:14] Come on now.
[1:46:16] You know, I've never spoke in tongues.
[1:46:19] Never have. Maybe I will someday. I
[1:46:21] don't know. Maybe that's not my gift.
[1:46:24] But but if if God allows that for me,
[1:46:29] God will wait if it's truly of God till
[1:46:33] he has a clear channel to work through.
[1:46:34] Right. Yeah.
[1:46:36] You want God to to to work the gifts,
[1:46:38] the speaking in tongues, interpretation,
[1:46:40] the prophecy in this church.
[1:46:44] Look at your life.
[1:46:46] Is it a vessel that he could use?
[1:46:48] Come on.
[1:46:50] We're not talking about running around
[1:46:51] shouting and speaking in tongues and and
[1:46:54] total chaos. We're talking about
[1:46:57] controlled
[1:46:58] order,
[1:47:00] ordained by God,
[1:47:02] gifts given by God, that will produce a
[1:47:05] seed that God says, "Yes, that's mine.
[1:47:09] Yes, I did that."
[1:47:13] When you look at the way that brother
[1:47:14] Brandham used to say they would do it,
[1:47:16] they come to church hour or two early.
[1:47:19] The ones with the gifts would go in the
[1:47:20] back, they would speak speak in tongues
[1:47:22] and there' be interpretation. and they
[1:47:23] would write it interpretation down and
[1:47:24] they put it on the platform. Brother
[1:47:26] Neville would read it.
[1:47:29] I believe those days are coming back.
[1:47:31] But God wants somebody that has to
[1:47:33] become that has become.
[1:47:36] He wants a willing vessel
[1:47:39] that says, "Lord, let that be in me." IF
[1:47:42] THERE'S ANYTHING IN my life that's
[1:47:44] hindering, if you've got somebody you
[1:47:45] got a GRUDGE AGAINST, CALL THEM UP.
[1:47:49] Call them up and say, "Forgive me." And
[1:47:52] you I'm going to be honest with you and
[1:47:54] don't get upset. I don't mean this I
[1:47:55] mean this with all due respect. I don't
[1:47:58] care what they've done to you.
[1:48:01] True.
[1:48:01] Call them up.
[1:48:04] Say, "I've had a against you."
[1:48:07] Until you do,
[1:48:09] until you can look at that person and
[1:48:10] see and and love them from your heart
[1:48:14] when you look at them. When you used to
[1:48:16] look at them, you used to turn and go
[1:48:17] the other way. But you get true love.
[1:48:19] That is the actual the fruits of the
[1:48:21] spirit that come off the true vine. That
[1:48:25] love will look at that person with
[1:48:28] nothing but love.
[1:48:30] Nothing but love.
[1:48:32] The bride will have to get there before
[1:48:33] we leave.
[1:48:35] Brother Brandham said that perfect love
[1:48:36] is the only thing that's going.
[1:48:38] That's right.
[1:48:39] You'll be wanting to take that person
[1:48:40] with you.
[1:48:44] So I urge you tonight,
[1:48:47] maybe you've got the gift of speaking in
[1:48:49] tongues, interpretation, prophecy,
[1:48:51] whatever it might be, and it's for this
[1:48:54] bride.
[1:48:56] Please become so we can have it.
[1:48:58] Yes,
[1:49:00] you need to become
[1:49:02] because that gift is not for you.
[1:49:05] It's not for you.
[1:49:06] That's the brides.
[1:49:09] God's given us gifts.
[1:49:13] Whatever is in our life that's hindering
[1:49:15] the use of that because he wants to do
[1:49:18] it. I promise you, God wants to do it.
[1:49:20] God wants to use you to do it.
[1:49:23] We're going to get there. That's his
[1:49:25] promise. We're going to get there.
[1:49:27] I just want it to be sooner than later.
[1:49:29] I'm so sick of this world.
[1:49:31] Oh yeah.
[1:49:31] I'm so sick. I can't stand it. There
[1:49:34] ain't a thing in this world that I could
[1:49:36] say I would rather do
[1:49:38] than leave right now.
[1:49:40] Amen.
[1:49:41] This very second.
[1:49:44] That's what I want to do. I want my full
[1:49:46] becoming, brother Jimmy. I want my full
[1:49:48] becoming. So when I get this out of this
[1:49:51] flesh, I can get out of these anxious
[1:49:53] pains. I can get all these this things,
[1:49:55] these worries, these whatever things
[1:49:57] that happens in our life that we can get
[1:49:59] out of when you've totally become when
[1:50:01] that life has totally become in you. You
[1:50:03] have produced the fruit that God said
[1:50:05] you will produce.
[1:50:07] You will live different. You'll talk
[1:50:09] different. You'll look at people
[1:50:10] different. You'll walk different.
[1:50:12] Yes, sir.
[1:50:13] People will see you different.
[1:50:16] It's just a life that's become.
[1:50:19] There's only one thing in your life that
[1:50:21] you need to become one thing and that's
[1:50:22] God.
[1:50:23] That's it.
[1:50:25] Don't try to be the most popular. Don't
[1:50:26] try to be the this or that or I want to
[1:50:29] be this. Well, I want to be that.
[1:50:31] Get God first. And if everything else is
[1:50:33] his will, he'll get you there.
[1:50:36] If it ain't his will, you don't want it
[1:50:37] anyway.
[1:50:40] Let's stand together.
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:55] Y'all, I was watching a
[1:50:58] when I was studying this, I was watching
[1:50:59] a a preacher. He's passed on. Brother
[1:51:03] Miles Monroe from Bahamas.
[1:51:08] Wonderful man. He's a black gentleman.
[1:51:09] Just a wonderful
[1:51:11] um the way he he the way he taught from
[1:51:14] the Bible.
[1:51:17] He's just
[1:51:19] I don't know. I I I believe I'll see him
[1:51:21] there one day. He's back in the 70s and
[1:51:26] but he started talking about prayer.
[1:51:30] You know, when you become
[1:51:32] what God wants you to be to be, you'll
[1:51:34] pray different.
[1:51:35] Yeah.
[1:51:37] And and looking in Matthew 6,
[1:51:41] I really believe that that's was the
[1:51:44] heart's desire of the disciples.
[1:51:47] Teach us to pray.
[1:51:51] Why?
[1:51:53] They wanted a closer relationship with
[1:51:55] him.
[1:51:56] Teach us how to talk to him.
[1:51:58] Yeah. We want to know how to talk to
[1:52:00] him.
[1:52:03] And when Jesus didn't give him this long
[1:52:05] prayer,
[1:52:08] four verses
[1:52:12] and it starts out giving praise to God
[1:52:16] and it finishes giving praise to God.
[1:52:19] Amen.
[1:52:21] It includes forgiving others.
[1:52:25] And Lord, give us our daily bread. Amen.
[1:52:28] That wasn't talking about real food.
[1:52:31] This was the daily bread because he
[1:52:32] tells him later, "You ain't got to ask
[1:52:34] what you need to eat.
[1:52:37] Give us our daily bread."
[1:52:41] So, we begin to to look at that. M.
[1:52:44] Brother Monroe was saying
[1:52:47] when they was saying this prayer and and
[1:52:50] Jesus further on Jesus starts to talk to
[1:52:52] him and and when he begins to talk to
[1:52:55] him, he starts telling them how the the
[1:52:58] Gentiles pray these long prayers and
[1:53:00] wanting people to see him and asking for
[1:53:02] this and asking for that.
[1:53:05] He said, "Therefore, take no thought,
[1:53:09] saying, what shall we eat? What shall we
[1:53:10] drink? Wherewith all shall we be
[1:53:12] clothed? For after all these things do
[1:53:15] the Gentiles seek, for your heavenly
[1:53:16] father knoweth you have need of all
[1:53:18] these things. Amen.
[1:53:20] But seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[1:53:22] This is how you become.
[1:53:25] Seeking the kingdom of God. That is your
[1:53:27] process of becoming
[1:53:31] and his righteousness.
[1:53:35] We we've been told in the word that you
[1:53:37] have become God's righteousness. So you
[1:53:39] seek the kingdom of God and his
[1:53:41] righteousness and all these things will
[1:53:44] be added unto you.
[1:53:46] You know, we spend so much time praying
[1:53:49] for for this, for that,
[1:53:52] praying. You might be in financial ruin
[1:53:54] and you're praying, "God,
[1:53:57] I need money."
[1:53:59] You might be sick. God, I need healing.
[1:54:02] You You might be battling anxiety,
[1:54:04] depression, and you need peace. You need
[1:54:06] joy.
[1:54:08] But you don't have to ask.
[1:54:12] Did you hear me?
[1:54:14] You don't have to ask.
[1:54:16] All this has been added unto you.
[1:54:20] It's already yours.
[1:54:22] Everything that you have need of
[1:54:24] has been added unto you.
[1:54:28] What does Jesus tell him to do? Pray for
[1:54:30] others.
[1:54:31] Yes.
[1:54:31] Yes.
[1:54:32] When you pray, most part give worship to
[1:54:34] God.
[1:54:35] Yes.
[1:54:35] Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
[1:54:38] Everything that is yours, Lord, we
[1:54:39] praise. Everything that is your yours,
[1:54:41] we worship. We give you glory.
[1:54:44] And Lord, if there's somebody that needs
[1:54:46] you, Lord, I want to offer this prayer
[1:54:47] for brother so and so, sister so and so.
[1:54:50] They need it.
[1:54:52] Sometimes people are in shape, in such
[1:54:54] shape, they can't pray for themselves.
[1:54:57] God says, "Don't worry.
[1:54:59] I've got those that will. Those who have
[1:55:02] sought my kingdom and those who have
[1:55:03] sought my righteousness,
[1:55:06] I've added it to them.
[1:55:10] Brother Steve Newsome's healing, God's
[1:55:12] added it to you.
[1:55:13] Yeah.
[1:55:16] He's given it to you.
[1:55:18] Why?
[1:55:20] You are his righteousness.
[1:55:22] You are his healing. When you become
[1:55:24] God, you didn't become just part of God.
[1:55:28] You become all of God.
[1:55:30] You are God's healing.
[1:55:32] You are You are the the provider.
[1:55:35] You are everything that he is.
[1:55:38] God don't halfway do anything.
[1:55:42] God don't say, "I'm just going to give
[1:55:43] you a little piece of me." Now, we we we
[1:55:45] know you know that that it's it's by a
[1:55:48] law. We can't just go create a world and
[1:55:49] live on it. But brother Brandham said
[1:55:50] the power that God had when he spoke the
[1:55:52] words into existence and all the light
[1:55:54] years beyond the galaxies above, he said
[1:55:56] that power lays in you. exact same
[1:55:59] power.
[1:56:03] We should be the most healthy people
[1:56:05] around.
[1:56:06] Come on.
[1:56:07] If we become
[1:56:09] when when we have reached the point of
[1:56:12] becoming,
[1:56:16] we'll see less sickness. We'll see more
[1:56:18] deliverance.
[1:56:19] We'll see less unforgiveness. We'll see
[1:56:21] more grace. We'll see more love. We'll
[1:56:24] see all the attributes of God
[1:56:27] you want. You want to be well. You want
[1:56:29] to be healed. Remember when brother
[1:56:31] Brandham talked about that that person
[1:56:34] that came up prayed for?
[1:56:36] Let me see.
[1:56:40] I got it here. Here it is. Now, in front
[1:56:43] of you stands a person just like you was
[1:56:46] a few minutes ago. You were sick down
[1:56:48] here,
[1:56:50] but there is a well person standing
[1:56:52] there.
[1:56:54] Jesus is calling to that well person
[1:56:56] right beyond it. Now you by faith as you
[1:57:00] close your eyes walk right into that
[1:57:02] well well body
[1:57:05] walk into it.
[1:57:07] Everything that you want to be
[1:57:10] that God said you could have
[1:57:13] close your eyes and walk right into it.
[1:57:16] Amen.
[1:57:16] Amen.
[1:57:18] You want delivered from lust. You want
[1:57:20] delivered from spirits that are ungodly.
[1:57:23] Close your eyes and walk into that
[1:57:25] righteous body.
[1:57:27] Close your eyes and walk into that well
[1:57:29] body. If you're sick, it doesn't matter.
[1:57:31] It there's not one single thing that
[1:57:33] Satan has put on you that you can't walk
[1:57:36] into a new one.
[1:57:38] Nothing.
[1:57:39] Yes, sir.
[1:57:40] I hope this has encouraged you tonight.
[1:57:43] Let's bow our heads.
[1:57:47] I hope somehow someway
[1:57:51] y'all could put pieces of this together.
[1:57:55] If you have a need in your heart, in
[1:57:56] your life tonight, with your heads
[1:57:57] bowed,
[1:58:02] to me, my need is Lord, let me become
[1:58:06] exactly the picture you have of me.
[1:58:10] Cuz out in front of me is a picture that
[1:58:12] God has made for me. And God's telling
[1:58:14] me to close my eyes and walk into it.
[1:58:16] He's telling you the same thing.
[1:58:19] And that picture that he has of you,
[1:58:23] he's had it since the foundation of the
[1:58:26] world. And he's placing it in front of
[1:58:28] you tonight.
[1:58:29] He's telling you to walk into it.
[1:58:32] It's free of anything that Satan could
[1:58:34] put on you.
[1:58:37] Are you going to be subject to test and
[1:58:38] trials? Absolutely. But I promise you
[1:58:41] this, when you've walked into that body
[1:58:43] of righteousness, you'll be able to
[1:58:44] withstand anything that hell brings
[1:58:46] against you. Amen.
[1:58:48] Heavenly Father,
[1:58:51] Lord, I'm so so thankful, Father, that
[1:58:53] you let me bring this again, Lord. It's
[1:58:56] just way weighing on my heart,
[1:58:59] Lord. I I'm not here to hurt feelings,
[1:59:01] Lord. For all I know, everybody here is
[1:59:04] where they need to be. Only you know.
[1:59:08] But Lord, if there's a heart out there
[1:59:10] that's crying out to you, Lord, that may
[1:59:14] be lonely.
[1:59:16] They might not have friends.
[1:59:18] They may feel like they're hated. They
[1:59:20] may feel like they're rejected.
[1:59:24] But Lord, you called them for a purpose.
[1:59:28] Lord, you called them to come up higher.
[1:59:32] You called him to become you.
[1:59:35] Lord, if there's anything in between
[1:59:38] that and them, Lord, may you give them
[1:59:42] strength to walk through it, to walk
[1:59:45] towards that body, Lord, that you
[1:59:48] envision them in before the foundation
[1:59:50] of the world. Lord, you see the needs
[1:59:53] physical, mental, spiritual, whatever it
[1:59:56] may be. Father, Lord, I pray that you
[1:59:58] would touch each one. Lord, help us from
[2:00:01] this day forward, Lord, to purpose in
[2:00:03] our heart.
[2:00:05] Lord, I don't want to walk out of here
[2:00:06] worse,
[2:00:08] Lord. I want to walk out of here more
[2:00:11] better than I have ever walked out of a
[2:00:13] service, Lord.
[2:00:15] But Lord, when we do that, help us to to
[2:00:17] put a stake down and say, I'm never
[2:00:19] going back behind this stake again. I'm
[2:00:22] going further.
[2:00:24] May you meet that needs, Lord Jesus. How
[2:00:26] we love you. We thank you for it in
[2:00:28] Jesus name. Amen.
