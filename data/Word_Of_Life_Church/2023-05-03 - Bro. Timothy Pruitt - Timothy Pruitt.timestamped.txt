[35:28] if everything that has breasts is

[35:35] you imagine the birds
[35:37] the whales
[35:38] the Dolphins everything that has breaths
[35:42] then big old things get up there and
[35:44] spin around and around and jump out of
[35:46] the water and people listen at him and
[35:48] say wonder what they're saying I have a
[35:50] pretty good idea
[35:51] of worshiping God
[35:53] if we could just do it if a dumb old
[35:55] whale can do it what about us some dumb
[35:58] old people we ought to be able to do it
[36:00] with all of our hearts should we amen
[36:02] it's wonderful for us to be together
[36:04] again tonight in the presence of the
[36:06] Lord but the Timothy person will come
[36:08] and speak for us tonight I want you to
[36:10] just pull on the gift of God and just
[36:12] believe that God's going to speak to us
[36:14] and he has a need a desire request in
[36:16] your heart we know that he's mindful of
[36:19] us it's enough hundreds of us gathered
[36:21] here tonight more than that streaming so
[36:24] God's the only one that can be able to
[36:26] custom fit a message that would be able
[36:29] to help all of us and be able to
[36:31] minister to us we believe he's that kind
[36:33] of a god though don't we to make it so
[36:36] personal that you just know that sermon
[36:39] was directly for you and you only and
[36:41] hundreds of others are sitting there
[36:42] thinking the exact same thing
[36:44] let's just pray together and we'll sing
[36:46] and then ask for the Timothy to come out
[36:48] father we love you so much tonight we're
[36:50] so grateful for the opportunity been
[36:52] given to us Lord Jesus that we could
[36:54] gather together in this place once again
[36:56] Lord we have not come to adore some man
[36:59] we've not come to lift up man but we've
[37:02] come to worship and exalt your precious
[37:05] wonderful name
[37:06] we are so grateful that we're partakers
[37:09] of your divine nature therefore by
[37:11] having your divine nature we've been
[37:13] given your name to share so we're asking
[37:16] tonight that you would help us we've
[37:18] come to bless your name to worship you
[37:21] to exalt you Lord our needs are many the
[37:24] thing goes through many again our God is
[37:28] so much greater
[37:32] just asking once again would you come
[37:34] tonight lord it's our brother comes to
[37:37] speak to us may you anoint him give him
[37:39] the words that we need tonight may we
[37:41] pull father and know that you're mindful
[37:43] of us in the name of the Lord Jesus we

[37:46] and the Saints said
[37:48] praise the Lord let's just sing touching
[37:51] Jesus while brother Timothy comes now
[37:53] remember no matter how deep we are how
[37:55] many great things that we think we know
[37:57] I trust we never get to a spot that we
[38:02] think we know so much that we can't have
[38:04] simple Faith to stop the Lord Jesus and
[38:08] if you're here tonight and you've got a
[38:09] need you may have a need to lay outside
[38:12] the confines of what brother Timothy has
[38:14] said you to preach on
[38:15] but you have the ability to be able to
[38:18] touch God
[38:19] and pull him right the direction that
[38:21] you have made
[38:23] you believe that
[38:25] oh woman
[38:27] tried so many Physicians
[38:32] [Music]
[38:36] yet
[38:38] worse so did Jesus
[38:43] she came
[38:49] and when
[38:52] my crown
[38:54] try to restrain the world
[38:58] foreign
[38:59] [Music]
[39:09] [Music]
[39:31] [Music]
[39:35] thank you Lord
[39:37] there's all
[39:43] you want you can touch

[39:56] his name everybody sing with horse with
[39:59] me now oh
[40:02] touching Jesus
[40:05] is all
[40:09] things
[40:10] foreign
[40:12] [Music]
[40:39] just believe
[40:42] when you call on
[40:46] his name
[40:50] [Music]
[40:51] Hallelujah there's nothing like the
[40:54] touch of the master
[40:55] hey man you know when you look at I was
[40:58] looking at a painting there back in the
[41:00] office just admiring it
[41:02] oh my I'd love to have that gift but
[41:04] when a master takes a
[41:06] pen or it takes a paintbrush he can
[41:10] paint something that nobody else can
[41:12] and when the master gets a hold of your
[41:14] life he can do something with it that
[41:16] nobody else can there's nothing like
[41:18] it's touching man and I'm glad to be
[41:21] here with you we're honored to be here
[41:23] with you in the house of the Lord and I
[41:25] want to bring greetings from our home

[48:26] Services we had in the old church you

[48:31] greater and even better and even more
[48:34] amen amen God bless you brother Jackie
[48:37] good to see you amen real hero of mine
[48:40] amen Luke chapter 9 and verse 12 it said
[48:43] when the Day begin to wear away then
[48:46] came the 12 and said unto him send the
[48:48] multitude away that they may go into the
[48:51] towns and the country road around about
[48:53] and and lodge and get victims for we are
[48:56] here in a desert place
[48:59] and he said unto them give ye them to
[49:01] eat and they said we have no more but
[49:03] Five Loaves and two fish except we
[49:05] should go and buy meat for all these
[49:07] people
[49:08] for they were about five thousand men
[49:10] and he said to his disciples make them
[49:13] sit down by 50s in a company and they
[49:16] did so and he made them and they made
[49:18] them sit all sit down and he took the
[49:21] Five Loaves and two fish and looking up
[49:23] to heaven he blessed them and break and
[49:26] gave the disciples to set before the
[49:28] multitude and they did eat and we're all
[49:32] filled and there were was taken up of
[49:34] fragments that remained to them 12
[49:37] baskets amen God bless you and be seated
[49:41] I just want to take for a thought this
[49:44] evening just a moment on the Healer
[49:47] hasn't lost his touch
[49:49] amen I in the scripture reading we read
[49:52] of quite a miracle that took place we uh
[49:55] look at the setting where they were in a
[49:57] desert and away from place that they
[50:00] could easily you know after service or
[50:02] somewhere go to a McDonald's or whatever
[50:04] and get something to eat and they were
[50:06] they were hungry and the disciples were
[50:08] looking around at what they could give
[50:09] and they found Five Loaves and two fish
[50:12] and we know as he took those Five Loaves
[50:15] into fish he began to take them and
[50:17] break them apart and he began to
[50:20] multiply them feed him 5 000 amen plus
[50:23] but you know what a miracle what a
[50:26] miracle that God could bypass uh the the
[50:29] growing and the baking and all you know
[50:32] the fish coming to birth and growing up
[50:35] to a certain size and catching it and
[50:38] then cooking it but he bypassed all of
[50:40] that and he began to break off and as he
[50:43] would break it off another one would
[50:44] appear you know and he you know what a
[50:47] miracle that was and I just want to put
[50:49] to my and put to the thought today that
[50:51] he's still in the miracle working
[50:53] business
[50:54] amen it doesn't matter who says he can't
[50:57] or it doesn't matter how many he says he
[50:59] doesn't do it anymore or it's all gone
[51:01] or it's all in the past that doesn't
[51:03] make it so he's still in the miracle
[51:06] working business amen you know brother
[51:08] Brandon would talk about that because he
[51:10] faced that giant in his day of the days
[51:13] of Miracles are passed and he said the
[51:15] days of Miracles has not passed as says
[51:18] the theologians if the days of Miracles
[51:20] has passed the day of God has passed
[51:23] because God is a miracle amen he said
[51:26] when the day when they say the days of
[51:28] Miracles has passed when the days of
[51:30] Miracles has passed the day of God has
[51:32] passed for God is Miracle certainly the
[51:35] days of Miracles will never be passed
[51:38] never was and never will so doubters say
[51:41] well you don't see many miracles anymore
[51:43] there's you know many have been waiting
[51:45] for a long time for their answer to come
[51:47] and you know in those moments of waiting
[51:49] those are some of the hardest times that
[51:51] you can go in amen but don't get weary
[51:53] because if you if you'll hold on in due
[51:56] season you're going to reap the benefits
[51:59] of what his word said but he says you
[52:01] know I read this scripture today and I I
[52:03] put it here this evening because in
[52:05] Havoc 2 and verse 2 it said the Lord
[52:07] answered and said write the vision and
[52:09] make it plain upon the tables that he
[52:12] may run that readeth it for the vision
[52:15] is yet for an appointed time but at the
[52:18] end it shall speak and not lie though it
[52:21] tarry wait for it because it will surely
[52:24] come and it will not tarry amen so there
[52:28] is a vision that's been put forth before
[52:30] us that we can read in this word amen if
[52:32] you need healing tonight there's a
[52:34] vision for that by his stripes you're
[52:36] healed amen amen all all of your
[52:39] sickness he's taken care of he's already
[52:41] paid the price for all of it amen and so
[52:44] we have a vision so in the threat if you
[52:46] can take that vision and realize it's
[52:48] not just a vision for yesterday but it's
[52:51] right now in the day that we're living
[52:52] him it'll give you strength to run on
[52:55] the journey that the race that you're
[52:56] running amen and so I was looking at
[52:59] this word wait and and weight means to
[53:01] remain in a place of Readiness it's not
[53:05] just sit there and twiddle your thumbs
[53:07] and act like nothing's going on but to
[53:09] remain in a place of Readiness or an
[53:11] expectation that something is about to
[53:14] happen amen and I believe that's where
[53:16] we should be amen as we wait for the
[53:18] Lord to return we're waiting not just in
[53:21] the in the care and the tearing of us
[53:23] going along life's journey and looking
[53:25] over here looking over there nowhere
[53:27] waiting expecting that any moment any
[53:30] time he's going to return again and so
[53:33] if you need healing tonight you need to
[53:35] be in a waiting place and an expectation
[53:38] that it just takes a touch it just takes
[53:40] a moment it just takes just a moment of
[53:43] his touch that and it can all be over
[53:45] with I've witnessed it too many times in
[53:48] my life and I've seen it happen so many
[53:50] times you can go through years of
[53:52] sickness but all of a sudden you'll
[53:54] reach a place face when that vision of
[53:56] that time of fulfillment is to come amen
[53:59] it will not tarry but it'll take place
[54:01] therefore you must be in a time of
[54:04] expectation that any moment any time any
[54:08] service any moment God's going to move
[54:11] God's going to change it God's going to
[54:13] attend or take God's going to answer
[54:15] God's going to heal God's going to
[54:18] deliver any moment I'm waiting for that
[54:21] time amen maybe your sons and daughters
[54:23] are out there away from God but you need
[54:25] to be in a moment of of waiting not not
[54:28] just you know time of giving
[54:31] in due season I'm going to read
[54:34] in due season it's going to come to pass
[54:37] because God's word will not fail we can
[54:40] read in Isaiah 40 about this weight he
[54:42] said Isaiah 40 and verse 28 he said hast
[54:45] thou not known hath thou not heard that
[54:48] the Everlasting God the Lord the creator
[54:51] of the ends of the Earth I love how he
[54:53] puts that the Everlasting God so in
[54:56] other words this God and His word will
[54:59] last longer than your sickness
[55:01] yeah
[55:03] amen he's the Everlasting God I know
[55:06] sometimes sickness act it feels like it
[55:08] lasts forever but it'll not Outlast Our
[55:10] God Amen it'll not Outlast Our God and
[55:14] His word that is spoken he's an
[55:16] everlasting God he'll last amen his word
[55:19] will remain it'll stand there until
[55:22] every Cancer is defeated every disease
[55:25] is defeated every sin is defeated this
[55:28] God will last
[55:32] Hallelujah not only with us God lasts
[55:34] but you're made to last
[55:37] Hallelujah I can read you of a time of a
[55:39] woman that come before brother Branham
[55:41] under a nervous condition and he's
[55:43] speaking to her and he says look he said
[55:45] that thing's got you down he said but
[55:47] I'm here to tell you you're going to
[55:48] last
[55:51] I ran around my house on that one amen
[55:53] look that Devil's eye has been in some
[55:55] of your ears saying I'm going to
[55:56] overcome you I'm going to take you down
[55:59] I'm going to defeat you but what you
[56:00] need to do is take the word of God and
[56:02] his word says those that are alive and
[56:05] remain I am going to last I'm going to
[56:08] last past sickness I'm going to last
[56:11] past trials
[56:13] come on somebody we are a people that's
[56:16] built to last amen I think about in the
[56:19] last days perilous times shall come last
[56:21] days for who
[56:24] come on it ain't my last days it ain't
[56:27] your last days
[56:29] but I can tell you whose last days is
[56:31] for it's the last days for sickness it's
[56:34] the last days for disease it's the last
[56:37] days for sin it's the last days for
[56:39] every demon of hell and while you're
[56:42] shouting on the Hills of Glory you're
[56:44] going to outlast them
[56:49] Hallelujah he is the Everlasting God
[56:55] Hallelujah he is the creator of the ends
[56:58] of the Earth and he fainteth not
[57:02] praise the name of the Lord this God
[57:04] doesn't give up
[57:07] he's not got the 2022 or 23 and given up
[57:11] on his promises giving up on a bride
[57:14] without spot without wrinkle giving up
[57:16] on his promise of a Healer no sir it
[57:18] doesn't matter how many more diseases
[57:20] come up on this Earth he's still a
[57:22] Healer it doesn't matter how many how
[57:24] many things we go through he's still a
[57:26] deliverer he's still the same yesterday
[57:28] today and forever he fainteth not and
[57:32] neither is he weary and there's no
[57:34] searching of his understanding and he
[57:36] giveth power to the Fates
[57:41] so maybe you're coming to the service
[57:43] tonight and you feel weary and you feel
[57:45] faint well let me tell you there's some
[57:47] power for you to get up and take another
[57:49] step to get up and fight another battle
[57:53] to get up and stand against that devil
[57:55] of hell it says I'm going to take you
[57:57] down I'm going to defeat you I'm going
[58:00] to pull you down no you're not devil I'm
[58:02] going to last past all of your threats
[58:05] past all of your things that you put up
[58:07] on this Earth I'm going to last
[58:11] some of you just need to wave your hand
[58:13] and say devil I'm still here
[58:17] Hallelujah but the years shall feign and
[58:21] be weary and the young men shall utterly
[58:23] fail amen but they that wait upon the
[58:26] Lord
[58:28] not wait upon a good doctor's report not
[58:32] wait upon some something to fear their
[58:34] symptoms of Filth no wait upon the Lord
[58:36] they shall renew their strength they
[58:39] shall Mount up with wings as eagles they
[58:42] shall run and not be weary they shall
[58:44] walk and not faint
[58:48] but we go through seasons of waiting
[58:51] many times we find ourselves in a season
[58:53] of waiting you know we're waiting to
[58:55] come out of a hard situation or or help
[58:58] in a certain situation or maybe some
[59:00] Financial strain or something but no
[59:02] matter what season there's all kinds of
[59:04] seasons of life just like their Seasons
[59:06] that we go through amen you know in
[59:08] Louisiana you can go through all four
[59:10] seasons in one day
[59:12] and sometimes that's the way it is in
[59:14] the Christian Life you can be on a
[59:15] mountain poon down in the valley just
[59:17] like that
[59:18] amen you go through a lot of Seasons but
[59:20] it doesn't matter what season you find
[59:22] yourself in he's still God
[59:25] don't get your eye off for that no
[59:27] matter where you find yourself maybe you
[59:29] find yourself battling the sickness or
[59:31] battling a spirit or or battling
[59:34] depression he's still God
[59:36] [Applause]
[59:38] amen you may be waiting and you may be
[59:40] but listen to the times of waiting are
[59:43] never wasted
[59:46] God is working things out in your life
[59:48] he's moving listen as that song says
[59:50] when you don't see him working he's
[59:53] still working
[59:54] you may not have felt him in a long time
[59:56] but he's still God and he's still moving
[59:59] he's still answering he's still touching
[1:00:02] he's still orchestrating he is still God
[1:00:10] before too often we get frustrated with
[1:00:13] God because things are not happening on
[1:00:15] our timeline
[1:00:18] you know therefore we know we think we
[1:00:20] know better than we than he does we get
[1:00:22] impatient and in that it leaves the
[1:00:24] depression and anxieties and fears but
[1:00:27] God is in control of everything that is
[1:00:30] happening
[1:00:31] it doesn't matter what's going on in
[1:00:33] this world he's in control he raises up
[1:00:36] Kings he taketh down Kings
[1:00:39] he's in control of it
[1:00:41] amen he's in control of every season of
[1:00:45] your life every moment of your life
[1:00:47] Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes 3 and 11 says
[1:00:49] he has made everything beautiful in his
[1:00:53] time
[1:00:56] I know we want our time and we want it
[1:00:59] to me you know we're living a very fast
[1:01:01] age right now and everything you know
[1:01:03] needs to be very quickly and we want it
[1:01:05] very quickly you know got to have a
[1:01:07] microwave gotta have this it's very
[1:01:08] quickly if it ain't quick enough then we
[1:01:10] get frustrated
[1:01:13] but God wants us in his time
[1:01:16] but in his time when the vision is to be
[1:01:19] fulfilled you can line every devil up
[1:01:22] and it will not keep it from coming to
[1:01:24] pass
[1:01:26] Hallelujah when it's time or a vision to
[1:01:28] be fulfilled for someone's healing you
[1:01:31] can lie in every devil and hell up and
[1:01:33] they'll not keep it from coming to pass
[1:01:35] but it will be fulfilled
[1:01:38] it will happen just like he said
[1:01:46] Psalms 31 and verse 15 and 16 says my
[1:01:49] times are in your hands
[1:01:52] deliver me from the hand of my enemy
[1:01:54] from those that pursue me but whatever
[1:01:56] my time is in your hand we read it just
[1:01:59] a while ago in habakkuk 2 the vision is
[1:02:02] for the appointed time
[1:02:05] Ecclesiastes 8 says there is a proper
[1:02:07] time and procedure for every Delight
[1:02:11] Ecclesiastes three and one says there
[1:02:13] are time for everything in the season
[1:02:15] for everything Galatians 6 those in
[1:02:18] verse 9 says let us not become weary and
[1:02:21] well doing for in the proper time we
[1:02:24] will reap a harvest if we don't give up
[1:02:27] foreign
[1:02:29] am I talking to some people tonight
[1:02:31] that's not going to give up
[1:02:33] amen God's not going to give up
[1:02:35] he's not going to give up on his
[1:02:37] promises he will fulfill him every time
[1:02:40] in his time but he's looking for
[1:02:42] somebody that'll stand there no matter
[1:02:45] how dark he gets no matter how gloomy it
[1:02:48] gets and say it's God's word and I'm
[1:02:50] holding on to it
[1:02:51] [Applause]
[1:02:54] yeah
[1:02:56] it's in his time
[1:02:58] no but no matter
[1:03:01] how long has been
[1:03:03] or how much time has passed God is still
[1:03:07] God
[1:03:09] he is still on the throne and he hasn't
[1:03:12] lost his touch what he did yesterday he
[1:03:16] still does today
[1:03:17] he's still the almighty he's still the
[1:03:20] same yesterday today and forever his
[1:03:22] power is still showing up it's still
[1:03:25] healing it's still delivering
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:30] see this right here this is a testimony
[1:03:32] right here he's still healing he's still
[1:03:34] delivering just Saturday night in the
[1:03:36] prayer line that we I've been suffering
[1:03:38] with his shoulder for years and years I
[1:03:40] couldn't hardly lift it up and I and I
[1:03:42] would you know go to raise my hands and
[1:03:44] I'd have to move it around just to get
[1:03:45] it up and like that and so in the prayer
[1:03:47] line I was kind of behind in the back a
[1:03:49] little bit and brother Ron looked at me
[1:03:51] said go to the front I go to the front
[1:03:52] not knowing what's going on brother
[1:03:54] Ronnie long is standing at the very
[1:03:55] front he lays his hand on my shoulder
[1:03:57] and the voice spoke to him he said have
[1:03:59] him pray for you
[1:04:01] said brother Ronnie the Lord just says
[1:04:03] have you pray for me my shoulder is bad
[1:04:06] and I need healing he began to pray and
[1:04:08] he said Lord you know just last year I
[1:04:11] had the same problem in the same
[1:04:12] shoulder and you healed me
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:19] and then he still does today
[1:04:23] he hasn't lost his touch he's still the

[1:04:30] same Authority

[1:04:48] worship you I'm going to glorify you I'm

[1:04:59] can touch me and it'll be over with
[1:05:04] thank you
[1:05:07] he hasn't lost his touch
[1:05:13] just a few weeks ago I just drop us in
[1:05:18] a few weeks ago I was well let me back
[1:05:21] up
[1:05:22] a couple years ago I actually was
[1:05:23] looking into going to business
[1:05:25] had it all planned out had it all
[1:05:27] figured out and things seemed to be
[1:05:28] falling in place
[1:05:30] I was on my way up to brother Ron's to
[1:05:33] preach for him and
[1:05:34] went by his house for Saturday is when
[1:05:36] he's having Saturday evening and Sunday
[1:05:38] evening service and so I was preaching
[1:05:39] both Services went Saturday to his house
[1:05:42] for a meal Saturday night he come and he
[1:05:45] said well it's going to be a good
[1:05:46] weekend you know how he does he says
[1:05:48] broadcast I said yeah I'm looking
[1:05:49] forward to it he said for you
[1:05:52] say oh my you know in my mind I've got
[1:05:55] these plans right and I thought wow you
[1:05:58] know I know he had spoke to different
[1:05:59] ones about businesses and this is what
[1:06:00] I'm looking at and expecting we got up
[1:06:02] on the mountain on Sunday afternoon
[1:06:04] there before I went up there for lunch
[1:06:06] before the service Sunday evening and we
[1:06:08] can look at looking over these beautiful
[1:06:10] landscaping
[1:06:11] and he pulls me aside he said this is
[1:06:13] the place and he begins to talk to him
[1:06:15] and he said you know I talked to this
[1:06:17] one brother Aiden up there in Ohio and I
[1:06:19] talked to this one over and God has
[1:06:21] blessed them
[1:06:22] he said but that's not you and I hadn't
[1:06:24] told him anything about what's going on
[1:06:28] but apparently somebody else did
[1:06:32] and he said I went yesterday after you
[1:06:35] left my house I went to take a nap and
[1:06:36] said I couldn't sleep went to my office
[1:06:38] and the Lord just spoke to my heart said
[1:06:40] tell him don't go into business that's
[1:06:42] not what's that's not his lot but he's a
[1:06:44] servant of mine and I will take care of
[1:06:46] him
[1:06:53] and you know what that that I've seen
[1:06:55] things change very rapidly was I as I
[1:06:58] watched it and God just began to provide
[1:07:00] and things begin to move in the you know
[1:07:02] the good direction went on for several
[1:07:04] years but just a couple months ago I saw
[1:07:06] things begin to turn the other way see
[1:07:08] you go through seasons of your life but
[1:07:11] God's wanting to test you to see if you
[1:07:13] really believe what he said
[1:07:16] if you really believe that was God that
[1:07:19] was speaking to you he's going to test
[1:07:21] you on it
[1:07:22] it can come from a man or it can come
[1:07:24] from this book God will test you if you
[1:07:27] really believe what he said
[1:07:30] amen so I begin to watch things very
[1:07:33] rapidly to deteriorate you know
[1:07:35] financially and things and I was just
[1:07:37] and then my wife has been going through
[1:07:39] some issues health-wise and all kinds of
[1:07:40] stuff going on and so just a couple
[1:07:43] weekends ago it'd be just accumulated to
[1:07:45] a point that I just come to a breaking
[1:07:47] spot and I just got I got through
[1:07:48] leading to singing at church and I went
[1:07:50] to the back and I just said Lord
[1:07:52] I don't know what's happening but help
[1:07:54] me right now to not move from what you
[1:07:57] have said
[1:07:58] help me not to get bitter about it you
[1:08:00] know how the devil is why can't you do
[1:08:02] this how come you can't do this you got
[1:08:04] talent you can do this what about the
[1:08:06] job you're left to go Minister look what
[1:08:08] they're paying now
[1:08:09] all kinds of things going through my
[1:08:11] mind

[1:08:16] moment well Monday morning I get up
[1:08:19] and the day goes and sister Ruth are
[1:08:21] taking a walk with some of the girls to
[1:08:22] come back by the mailbox grab the mail
[1:08:25] come in the house and and handed me an
[1:08:27] envelope
[1:08:29] and I said wow there was it and I looked
[1:08:31] at it opened it up it was a card nice
[1:08:34] card and it said just just a note of
[1:08:37] Thanksgiving to someone who touched our
[1:08:39] lives and I don't remember exactly right
[1:08:41] here don't have it before me
[1:08:43] and said and open it up and said just
[1:08:45] take this as a gift of appreciation
[1:08:48] and I'll flip that over check over it

[1:08:53] enough
[1:08:59] you know brother Donnie I got to realize
[1:09:01] that I hadn't been home on Friday hadn't
[1:09:04] been home on Saturday and we got to
[1:09:05] realizing the mail hadn't even run yet
[1:09:07] on that Monday morning that check had
[1:09:10] been probably in there already in the
[1:09:11] mailbox while I was crying out to God
[1:09:14] while I was in my nervous cross while I
[1:09:17] was having a questions why the devil was
[1:09:19] talking to me the answer was already in
[1:09:22] the mailbox
[1:09:25] and the whole time no doubt what God was
[1:09:28] saying just go to the mailbox just go
[1:09:31] out there and I was bypassing you know
[1:09:33] hey y'all I don't like going to a
[1:09:34] mailbox because there's always bills in
[1:09:36] there
[1:09:37] but now it's kind of changed my mind
[1:09:39] about a mailbox
[1:09:40] amen but I I I I I it was already laying
[1:09:44] there and I thought God how many times
[1:09:46] are we crying out and wonder and
[1:09:49] frustrated and it's already in the
[1:09:52] mailbox
[1:09:53] there's a love letter that's been wrote
[1:09:55] to you and it's got promise after
[1:09:57] promise after promise just go to the
[1:10:00] mail

[1:10:06] now I take it as my heart this is my
[1:10:10] inheritance
[1:10:15] his power is still showing up
[1:10:25] let me read you a couple testimonies
[1:10:26] really quick nerves are still being
[1:10:28] healed
[1:10:30] pain is still even bodies
[1:10:33] God hasn't lost this touch broken bones
[1:10:36] are being put in place no surgery needed
[1:10:40] just recent things that have taken place
[1:10:42] amen pain leaving people's bodies
[1:10:46] see God hasn't lost his touch I know
[1:10:49] what he can do I felt that I've
[1:10:51] witnessed it and I found him faithful
[1:10:53] I've seen him move he hasn't lost his
[1:10:56] touch he's still the unchanging God he
[1:10:59] still restores he still heals he still
[1:11:02] redeems and no matter how many dollars
[1:11:04] Say It Ain't So I still believe
[1:11:09] I still believe
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:15] there's something about the touch of a
[1:11:17] Healer of the Healer
[1:11:20] let's read about it really quick in
[1:11:21] several scriptures here you don't have
[1:11:24] to keep up with me there but if you want
[1:11:25] to you can Luke Chapter 2 7 and verse
[1:11:27] 12.
[1:11:29] so when it came now to the gate of the
[1:11:31] city
[1:11:32] behold there was a dead man carried out
[1:11:35] the only son of his mother
[1:11:38] and she was a widow can you imagine the
[1:11:40] pain
[1:11:42] and much people of the city was with her
[1:11:45] and when the Lord saw her he had
[1:11:47] compassion on her and said unto her
[1:11:49] weave not
[1:11:51] and it came and touched the bar
[1:11:55] the casket
[1:11:56] and they that bear him Stood Still and
[1:11:59] he said young man I say unto thee arise
[1:12:02] and he that was dead sat up and began to
[1:12:05] speak and he delivered him to his mother
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:10] yeah
[1:12:11] listen if I had a son or a daughter that
[1:12:13] was out and dead and sin and trespasses
[1:12:15] and iniquities I would not give up
[1:12:19] because he knows exactly where they're
[1:12:21] at and all he's got to do is come and
[1:12:23] just touch them
[1:12:26] we just had a man come just a few days
[1:12:28] ago amen he said listen he said I had no
[1:12:30] desire to come back to God I had walked
[1:12:32] away from the house of God I had no
[1:12:34] desire to come back he said when I went
[1:12:36] to my office and I laid down for just a
[1:12:38] moment to take a nap and I heard a voice
[1:12:40] saying this is your time to come home
[1:12:43] and he said I jumped up and I came home
[1:12:48] he's still that kind of God I would not
[1:12:52] give up on him
[1:12:55] all it takes for him to see it's your
[1:12:58] turn right
[1:13:00] right it's your turn maybe it's somebody
[1:13:03] in this service right here tonight it's
[1:13:04] your turn
[1:13:06] you've been backsliding away from God
[1:13:08] and Dad it's your turn
[1:13:13] Matthew 8 and verse 3 said Jesus put
[1:13:16] forth his hand and touched him saying I
[1:13:20] will be thou clean and immediately the
[1:13:22] leprosy was clean
[1:13:25] touch Just a Touch
[1:13:28] Matthew 8 and verse 14 said Jesus came
[1:13:31] to Peter's house and he saw his wife's
[1:13:33] mother laid sick of a fever and he
[1:13:35] touched her hand and the fever left her
[1:13:37] and she arose and ministered unto them
[1:13:39] Matthew 9 28 said when he came to the
[1:13:42] house a blind man came to him and Jesus
[1:13:44] said believe you that I'm able to do
[1:13:45] this and they said unto him yea Lord and
[1:13:48] then touched he their eyes and the court
[1:13:50] said according to your faith be it unto
[1:13:52] you and their eyes were open
[1:13:54] Just a Touch
[1:13:58] Genesis 32 and verse 25 said when he saw
[1:14:02] talking about Jacob when he saw that he
[1:14:04] prevailed not against the angel he
[1:14:06] touched the hollow of his eye
[1:14:09] and we know what happened and from that
[1:14:11] moment he walked different
[1:14:14] he had a name change
[1:14:18] and it'll take years of repentance it
[1:14:20] just takes a moment
[1:14:21] [Applause]
[1:14:23] and you'll walk different you'll talk
[1:14:25] different you're act different just from
[1:14:28] being in his presence and him touching
[1:14:30] you
[1:14:31] oh God May Touch Somebody tonight
[1:14:36] Daniel 8 in verse 18 says now as he was
[1:14:38] speaking with me I was in deep Sleep on
[1:14:40] my face toward the ground but he touched
[1:14:43] me and he set me upright and said behold
[1:14:45] I will make thee know what shall be in
[1:14:48] the last end of the indignation when for
[1:14:51] at the time appointed the end shall be
[1:14:54] amen
[1:14:57] but we all go through as I've been
[1:14:59] saying seasons of life
[1:15:01] times where God seems so far away
[1:15:06] you know winter seasons
[1:15:08] honestly is not my favorite season of
[1:15:10] the year some people love it but but
[1:15:12] listen
[1:15:14] you don't change seasons

[1:15:18] you can't change the season if you
[1:15:20] wanted to
[1:15:22] so you put a coat on
[1:15:24] but you put that coat on not expecting
[1:15:27] to wear it forever
[1:15:29] amen you don't expect it to stay that
[1:15:32] way forever amen because Seasons don't
[1:15:35] last they change
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:38] amen Seasons don't last they change the
[1:15:41] good news is about winter spring is on
[1:15:44] the way
[1:15:46] Suddenly It's spring and the season has
[1:15:48] changed and you don't even know how you
[1:15:50] made it through winter
[1:15:52] but all of a sudden flowers are blooming
[1:15:55] trees are blooming birds are singing and
[1:15:58] it's freeing again
[1:16:00] you might be in a time of winter right
[1:16:03] now but don't worry you're not going to
[1:16:05] stay there it's going to change
[1:16:11] amen listen God don't leave you there
[1:16:14] always but suddenly things can change
[1:16:17] suddenly sorrow can turn to Joy
[1:16:21] suddenly amen chains can fall off and
[1:16:24] freedom be released suddenly you're
[1:16:26] buried and the next day you're full of
[1:16:28] life
[1:16:33] understand healing is a process but
[1:16:36] there's a time healing becomes suddenly
[1:16:38] becomes the day
[1:16:40] I mean you can go months and it'd be
[1:16:42] healing and all of a sudden there's a
[1:16:43] day and it's over with
[1:16:45] I mean no we know a miracle it could
[1:16:47] just be just boom it's done same both
[1:16:49] but God works in both I don't not trying
[1:16:52] to diminish any of them they're all God
[1:16:56] how God wants to orchestrate that's up
[1:16:58] to him but suddenly things can change
[1:17:00] very quickly in your life
[1:17:04] amen it just takes a touch amen where's
[1:17:06] this word at well let's read about Acts
[1:17:08] chapter 2 and verse 1. it said when the
[1:17:10] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:17:12] were all with one Accord in one place
[1:17:14] and suddenly
[1:17:16] there were days leading up to this but
[1:17:19] suddenly
[1:17:21] there came a sound from Heaven as a
[1:17:24] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all
[1:17:26] the house that we're setting suddenly
[1:17:28] one went from being a denier to a
[1:17:31] preacher of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:17:34] follow the Holy Ghost in power
[1:17:40] when you read in Acts chapter 9 and
[1:17:42] verse 2 with Saul who became Paul
[1:17:45] but he's on his way to Damascus and the
[1:17:48] scripture says suddenly
[1:17:50] they're shined around him about a light
[1:17:52] from heaven
[1:17:54] so in one moment he's on his high horse
[1:17:56] the next moment he's on the dirt
[1:18:02] I want to tell our critics suddenly
[1:18:04] things going to change
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:08] you might be on a high horse right now
[1:18:09] and you're carrying out threats and
[1:18:11] persecution but let me tell you it can
[1:18:13] change very quickly
[1:18:14] [Applause]
[1:18:16] amen and he fell to the Earth and he
[1:18:18] heard a voice saying Saul Saul why
[1:18:21] persecutes me thou me and he said who
[1:18:23] art thou Lord he said I'm Jesus whom I
[1:18:25] persecuted and he said arise and go in
[1:18:28] the city shall be told what to do it
[1:18:30] changed very quickly
[1:18:31] very suddenly Just a Touch
[1:18:35] Acts chapter 16 and verse 25 it says at
[1:18:39] midnight Paul and Silas pray and sang
[1:18:41] Praises unto God and the prisoners heard
[1:18:44] them and suddenly
[1:18:48] now this wasn't exactly the time they
[1:18:51] really felt no doubt like praising God
[1:18:55] it wasn't that they just came to this
[1:18:57] spot and they thought man things have
[1:18:59] been going so good today I feel like
[1:19:01] lifting up my hands and I know they had
[1:19:03] chains on they had been beat they had
[1:19:06] went through a lot of problems and
[1:19:07] persecution but Paul was sitting over
[1:19:09] there by Silas and he looked at Silas
[1:19:11] blood running down his cheek and he said
[1:19:13] Silas
[1:19:14] I feel like praising praising him
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:25] that'll turn a devil on his ear
[1:19:28] like someone who's been through the mud
[1:19:30] on a Wednesday and been through trial
[1:19:33] after trial and been through problem
[1:19:35] after problem but all of a sudden they
[1:19:38] say you know what I'm going to look past
[1:19:39] all of that
[1:19:42] and I'm going to sing praises to my God
[1:19:45] and I'm going to give him glory and I'm
[1:19:47] going to give him honor and I'm going to
[1:19:49] give him what he deserves
[1:19:53] you want your chains broken go ahead and
[1:19:56] start praising him
[1:19:57] you won't deliver it's from yourself go
[1:20:00] ahead lift your hands and say I praise
[1:20:02] the mighty name of Jesus
[1:20:07] and suddenly there was a great
[1:20:09] earthquake and the prison was shaken and
[1:20:12] immediately same word all the doors were
[1:20:14] open and everyone's bands were loosed
[1:20:18] you know why because two on a Wednesday
[1:20:20] night said you know what I feel like
[1:20:22] praising God
[1:20:28] it doesn't matter what I've been through
[1:20:30] God God's been with me it doesn't matter
[1:20:33] how low I've been God was still there it
[1:20:36] doesn't matter the sickness I've been
[1:20:38] dealing with God's been with me
[1:20:41] why shouldn't I praise him why shouldn't
[1:20:43] I glorify him
[1:20:48] it'll not only set you loose it'll set
[1:20:50] everyone loose
[1:20:53] that scripture for it immediately
[1:20:56] your season can change
[1:20:58] a touch can change come
[1:21:01] in just a moment
[1:21:04] Matthew 8 and verse 2 said behold there
[1:21:07] came a leper
[1:21:08] and worshiped him
[1:21:12] he didn't just worship him after being
[1:21:14] cleansed he was a leper hurting
[1:21:18] Skin Rotten
[1:21:20] and he worshiped him saying Lord if thou
[1:21:23] wilt thou can't make me clean and Jesus
[1:21:26] put forth his hand and touched him
[1:21:28] saying I will be thy clean and
[1:21:31] immediately his leper what leprosy was
[1:21:33] cleansed Mark chapter 1 and verse 29
[1:21:36] says it like this and four with when
[1:21:38] they come out of the synagogue they
[1:21:39] entered the house of Simon and Andrew
[1:21:41] and James and John but Simon's wife
[1:21:44] mother lay sick with a fever a nun they
[1:21:46] tell her of him and he came and took her
[1:21:48] by the hand and lifted her up and
[1:21:50] immediately
[1:21:52] the fever left her
[1:21:57] takes a touch
[1:21:59] lombardimaeus
[1:22:02] he had his moment
[1:22:04] Jesus come walking through
[1:22:06] there was critics it was around him
[1:22:08] there was all kind of people saying all
[1:22:10] kinds of things and blind martyr man
[1:22:12] said who is that coming they said that's
[1:22:13] Jesus of Nazareth oh sorry scumbag ain't
[1:22:17] nothing but an illegitimate child Jesus
[1:22:20] foreign
[1:22:21] have mercy on me
[1:22:24] come on man you you need to just keep
[1:22:26] quiet you know he can't do nothing and
[1:22:28] listen I done heard what he's done
[1:22:32] more to me and said look if you was
[1:22:34] blind as I am you would want to be with
[1:22:37] him as well
[1:22:38] you know it's a paradox and a blind man
[1:22:41] had more Revelation than people that
[1:22:43] could see with these eyeballs
[1:22:45] amen but he knew he had to get in his
[1:22:48] presence and they begin to try to tell
[1:22:50] him sit down shut up we don't you're
[1:22:53] making too much noise and he said the
[1:22:54] scripture says he hollered even that
[1:22:57] much the more
[1:22:59] because he knew this is my opportunity
[1:23:02] and I forget another one
[1:23:04] this is my moment and I may not ever get
[1:23:07] another one
[1:23:08] God if we could have that same desire
[1:23:10] that same passion this is my moment and
[1:23:14] I may not get another one
[1:23:18] have mercy on me
[1:23:21] and I love if he said Jesus
[1:23:23] Stood Still
[1:23:25] brother Brandon talked about he said he
[1:23:27] said that Christ stopped heaven
[1:23:32] your Christ stops heaven
[1:23:34] listening to your cry amen
[1:23:39] amen you know I know it seems like it
[1:23:41] takes you know it's been a long time
[1:23:42] things have been a lot longer than we
[1:23:44] expected a lot I haven't heard it on the
[1:23:47] first day
[1:23:49] the answer's on the way
[1:23:53] the answer is on the way don't you know
[1:23:55] don't get out of line for your miracle
[1:24:00] hey man the answer is on the way and he
[1:24:02] went he went and said Jesus has called
[1:24:05] for you you know what he did he Cast
[1:24:07] Away His Garment
[1:24:09] I like that
[1:24:11] you know why Cast Away that garment
[1:24:12] because he knew he was going to go and
[1:24:14] he wouldn't have to come back and be a
[1:24:15] beggar no more
[1:24:16] [Applause]
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:18] he knew he was going to go to Jesus and
[1:24:20] it was all going to be over with that
[1:24:22] was the faith that was in this blind man
[1:24:24] he said well I don't need this garment
[1:24:25] no more I don't need it no more and he
[1:24:28] throwed it away listen he wasn't there
[1:24:30] to worship his feelings worship his
[1:24:32] problems worship His situation he was
[1:24:35] there to worship one thing
[1:24:38] and that was Jesus Christ
[1:24:43] we know he was healed the woman having
[1:24:45] the issue of blood
[1:24:47] spent all of her living on the
[1:24:48] Physicians couldn't be healed of any
[1:24:51] came behind him and touched
[1:24:56] so you have a touch too
[1:24:59] it's a touch of faith
[1:25:02] she pressed through all those critics
[1:25:05] all of those others
[1:25:07] and she was there bleeding out about to
[1:25:10] die
[1:25:11] and she pressed through all of it
[1:25:13] because if I can just touch
[1:25:22] and she touched him
[1:25:24] and immediately her issue of blood
[1:25:27] stopped
[1:25:32] my God to God that we serve is a
[1:25:35] powerful God
[1:25:36] [Applause]
[1:25:39] we can read about Paul or Peter as he
[1:25:41] went to the gate called Beautiful
[1:25:43] and there was a man there begging arms
[1:25:45] and he said silver and gold eye by none
[1:25:47] but such that I have give out to thee
[1:25:49] and they took him by the right hand and
[1:25:51] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[1:25:54] and ankle bones received strength
[1:25:58] this God is still in the healing
[1:26:00] business
[1:26:03] and just a moment things can change
[1:26:08] just preaching on this and just
[1:26:10] interject a little bit of it but Israel
[1:26:12] got taken into captivity
[1:26:14] and we know the scripture in Psalms
[1:26:16] where it says we couldn't sing the songs
[1:26:18] of Zion no more
[1:26:20] I said because you know it's taken out
[1:26:22] of our land of promise and it just
[1:26:24] wasn't we had to put our harps on the
[1:26:25] willow tree and all of that but you know
[1:26:27] there was a time that they were there
[1:26:29] but there was also a time they left
[1:26:33] see God raises up Kings and he'll take
[1:26:36] it down Kings he allows things to rise
[1:26:39] up in the epig terrorism right back down
[1:26:41] amen if a while thou walls to come
[1:26:43] around but then when he's ready for
[1:26:45] somebody to be set free he'll tear walls
[1:26:47] down
[1:26:48] amen and we can read about it when they
[1:26:50] got released it said in Psalms 126 and 1
[1:26:53] said when the Lord turned again the
[1:26:55] Captivity of Zion we were like them that
[1:26:58] dream
[1:26:59] it was like we was in a dream this is so
[1:27:01] good it feels like I'm dreaming
[1:27:04] and he said then was our mouth filled
[1:27:06] with laughter and her tongues were
[1:27:09] singing then said they among the Heathen
[1:27:11] the Lord hath done great things for them
[1:27:16] God had done so much that it had to make
[1:27:19] the Heathen testify
[1:27:21] amen the Lord hath done great things for
[1:27:24] them the Lord hath done great things for
[1:27:26] us wherever we are glad he's turned
[1:27:28] again our captivity O Lord as the
[1:27:30] streams of the South and they that sow
[1:27:33] in tears shall reap in joy
[1:27:39] Hallelujah you've been sowing in tears
[1:27:41] don't worry there's a touch coming and
[1:27:43] you're going to reap in joy
[1:27:46] you've been going to bed crying but in
[1:27:48] the morning Joy comes it comes it's a
[1:27:52] refreshing from the presence of almighty
[1:27:54] God
[1:27:56] they that sow in tears shall reap in Joy
[1:27:59] he that goeth forth and weepth bearing
[1:28:02] precious seed shall doubtless come again
[1:28:04] with rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
[1:28:08] listen God is not interested and you're
[1:28:11] just having one little seed he's
[1:28:13] interested in you having a harvest of
[1:28:15] seeds
[1:28:17] so you've been bearing this seed of
[1:28:19] promise and you've been bearing it with
[1:28:21] tears of weeping but all of a sudden
[1:28:23] it's changed
[1:28:26] and the change comes by the touch of the
[1:28:28] master and it goes from weeping to Joy
[1:28:31] and it goes from one sea to a harvest
[1:28:35] Hallelujah I'm looking at a people that
[1:28:38] have that's reaping the Harvest of God's
[1:28:40] blessings
[1:28:43] and let me tell you it's only just
[1:28:45] beginning
[1:28:46] it's only just forgetting I would say
[1:28:49] God pour it out pour out your healing
[1:28:51] pour out your deliverance pour out the
[1:28:54] Holy Ghost pour out your spirit pour out
[1:28:57] the Unspeakable Joy of almighty God and
[1:29:00] let his soul fill our hearts that it's
[1:29:02] not just a trickle but it's a gusher of
[1:29:05] the Holy Ghost pouring down into our
[1:29:07] lives
[1:29:08] until it changes ever father it changes
[1:29:12] every mother it changes every child it
[1:29:15] changes every one of us till we take
[1:29:17] that moment of that body change
[1:29:19] [Applause]
[1:29:23] Psalms 30 and verse 1 says
[1:29:25] I will extol thee O Lord
[1:29:28] for thou Has Lifted Me Up
[1:29:31] and has not made my foes to Rejoice over
[1:29:35] me
[1:29:36] O Lord my God I Cried unto thee and thou
[1:29:39] has healed me oh Lord thou has brought
[1:29:42] up my soul from the grave thou has kept
[1:29:45] me alive that I should not go down to

[1:29:51] give thanks to the remembrance of his
[1:29:54] Holiness for his anger endureth for a
[1:29:57] moment but in his favor his life weeping
[1:30:01] may endure for the night but joy cometh
[1:30:04] in the morning
[1:30:06] joy cometh in the morning and in my
[1:30:09] Prosperity I said I shall never be moved
[1:30:12] Lord by the favor that has made my
[1:30:14] Mountain to stand strong thou let us
[1:30:16] hide thy face and I was troubled I Cried
[1:30:18] unto thee O Lord unto the Lord I made
[1:30:20] supplication what prophet is there is my
[1:30:23] blood when it goes down in the pit shall
[1:30:25] the dust praise thee shall it declare
[1:30:27] thy truth hear O Lord have mercy on me
[1:30:30] Lord be thou my helper
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:36] but thou has turned my morning into
[1:30:39] dancing
[1:30:41] and thou has put off my sightcloth and
[1:30:44] girded me with gladness to the end of my
[1:30:47] glory may seem praise to thee and not be
[1:30:50] silent O Lord my God I will give thanks
[1:30:53] unto thee forever

[1:34:30] he would feed those five thousand and he
[1:34:32] would tear off a piece of bread
[1:34:35] and another one would take in place he'd
[1:34:37] tear it off and just keep multiplying
[1:34:39] and multiply and feed where they had
[1:34:42] baskets left over
[1:34:44] showing his Jehovah Jireh he's not just
[1:34:48] enough he's more than enough
[1:34:51] he knew exactly how many people was
[1:34:53] there and he knew exactly how much food

[1:34:58] he wasn't bad planning he was showing
[1:35:01] I'm more than enough

[1:35:25] later his two's walking on the road to
[1:35:28] Emmaus
[1:35:29] they're trying to make sense of all of
[1:35:30] this
[1:35:32] well what I I thought he was the Christ
[1:35:34] I thought he was going to deliver us I
[1:35:37] thought this is going to the Romans are
[1:35:39] still here
[1:35:41] and they're talking about him brother
[1:35:43] Brian said you know when you talk about
[1:35:44] him that's when he usually draws nigh
[1:35:47] all of a sudden now the bushes one just
[1:35:49] steps in into the path with him begins
[1:35:52] to walk
[1:35:53] and they don't even recognize him
[1:35:57] because he's not in that same old wore
[1:35:59] out tore up body
[1:36:02] he'd have been changed
[1:36:05] and he's walking there and they don't
[1:36:07] recognize him and he begins to expound
[1:36:09] to them the scriptures and they said you
[1:36:11] know yo you have little have you not
[1:36:13] heard and it begins to go down through
[1:36:15] the scriptures showing showing showing
[1:36:17] and they come to their house
[1:36:21] and he made as if he's going to go on by
[1:36:26] how many times he done that in the
[1:36:27] service he makes as if he's going to go
[1:36:30] on by but somebody reaches out says no I

[1:36:47] they began to talk to them and the
[1:36:49] scripture says he took the bread
[1:36:53] and as he break it
[1:36:55] it opened up their eyes
[1:36:57] now pardon me
[1:37:00] I don't feel like it was a certain way
[1:37:01] he held it
[1:37:03] and it was a certain way he tore it I
