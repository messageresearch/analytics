truly that is our desire that we could see you and know you and understand you in a greater Way We Believe father that you've given us your principles your truths in this day and we're so grateful father that you've sent a message to be able to turn our hearts back to the original Apostolic fathers Lord God we pray that you would move forever need that you're present dear Jesus if there's anyone here tonight that don't know you may they be able to find you before the service is over there's anyone sick anyone that's weary Lord God you see the direction that I've studied to try to answer these questions questions but if there would be a person here tonight whose need would lay outside of the confines of what I've studied make me sensitive to the Holy Ghost Lord God if it was no more than five or six words for that individual that they would be able to be ministered to or we realize that's why we're here on the earth is to serve you we're here for more than just to make it living and have a vocation and go to school and get this de degree or that degree or make a living for our family cuz one day all of that will be over we're going to come up to your house so really all that we've done for you then is all that will really matter so would you speak to us tonight father from your word we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus amen praise the lord it's privileged for us to be able to be gathered together here again tonight before we uh go into the um questions themselves I'd like to read you a little something from uh proving his word you know as a pastor any any aspect of the ministry you're going to get questions but a pastor is going to get more than likely more than an evangelist would or maybe a teacher would and um whenever a question arises actually that troubles people in your church it's actually my responsibility it's my duty as a pastor to do it so I'd like to share with you um this tonight just to kind of let you see a little bit of the responsibility that falls on your shoulders proving his word the prophet said you know there's a scripture in the Bible in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 where it's written prove all things whole fast of that which is good when anything it is proven it will either be proven right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right just makes sense right now then as you find out what is right it is said hold fast in other words grip it don't turn it loose hold it fast in other words hold it tight so that it will not slip hold fast to that which is good after it's been proven right and anything that's proven not right then turn it loose as quick as you can get away from it don't ever never hold on to the wrong thing now listen this is what's tricky for all of us it is possible that staunch Christians fine people hold sometimes to the wrong thing thinking it's right but when these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong and it's the duty of all of us and we're expecting to go to heaven when Jesus comes and it's The Minister's Duty when any question is brought up that he solves this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong holding to the wrong thing so we have a scripture and Jesus said all scripture must be fulfilled that we should prove all things and then hold fast or hold tight get a death grip on it and don't turn it loose hold fast to that which is good praise the Lord a't that wonderful so that's what we want to do then as a minister of course especially a pastor uh there's going to be all kinds of questions you can be seated thank you um that I'm going to get and and some of them um you know to be honest with you some of them might be a little bit too plain to be able to deal was in public and uh some of them would pertain um to to our church only and let me just say this tonight that answering these questions that they are questions from our church Word of Life Church and so I'm going to deal with them for our church um if you're hearing this tonight streaming it or you're archiving it and your pastor would tell you something different than what I would say tonight well I'll tell you what the prophet said whenever he was here you followed the teachings of your pastor if he's a man of God he's ordained of God to lead you want so God never sent me to straighten everybody else out around the message but God did call me to be a pastor for the time being it's just where I'm at so I want to answer these to the best of my ability but if anybody else hears them and I know they are going to be because they were last Thursday night I never got so many texts from so many preachers and M our life Thursday Friday and Saturday so I know there's going to be a bunch more listening to them tonight but Brothers these questions and answers ain't for you all in the first place they're for my people so if you want to accept them and that's up to you if you don't want to accept them well you know you just do whatever you think is right and if you feel like that we're wrong then you pray for us that we will get right cuz we certainly want to be right don't we use of Word of Life Church so I want to pick up on the question that uh the second one that we dealt with last Thursday night because I didn't totally get done with it when someone speaks in tongues an interpretation is given how are we to know if the person is truly speaking with tongues and how are we to know if a true interpretation is given I don't know who asked this question because some of these questions were given to me by brother Joe and by Brother Rob and they were texting me so I don't know who ask them it's not really relevant anyway but I've had them for this one here was one of the one of the first ones that I got so I've had him for about five or 6 weeks something like that but I think it's pertinent for the hour that we're living in and since I dealt with it on Thursday night I've had a bunch more needless to say and I've I've got some even this very day talked to several not only youth in our church but some older people on the phone today with a brother that's been here with us for many many years former Pentecostal guy and uh so there's an answer there's lots of questions that are being raised up but let's read if you would in 1 Corinthians chap 14:3 now Paul says he that prophesied now remember we know that there was gifts in the Ephesian church and the other churches but the Corinthian Church was the one that seemed to have so many problems with the gifts but in reality if they had not had problems would we had these scriptures Paul never mentions this in the book of Ephesians he never mentions this in Philippians 1 and 2 Thessalonians 1 and second Timothy he never mentions this and any other the Epistles other than First Corinthians so actually problems in a church or problems in a move of God will give the ministry a chance to be able to deal with them and help people beyond their own scope does that make sense to you so if the Corinthian Church had not had problems with these gifts then more than likely we we wouldn't even know what the correct answers would be so whenever you look at First Corinthians and then about 5 years later you read Second Corinthians and and you see there was such a Paramount growth in that church a lot of these problems right here were totally resolved but the way they were resolved because a prophet of God was there to give them an understanding well I'm glad he was there because we're still benefiting from his understanding of what gave him then so watch now Paul is dealing with tongues and interpretation and prophecy now they also of course had to deal with women preachers because a lot of the converts in the Corinthian Church they were G Greeks and they were Gentiles and many of them women which were there they were actually part of the idol worship Corinth was a a great Port City and it was a city of tremendous idolatry and most of those Idol worshippers they had actually may strange as it may seem to us but they had women that were Priestess and they actually had sex acts that were brought in to their worship so some of the main leaders in the city of the religious temples of Corinth it was actually women so when them women then become saved filled with the Holy Ghost well they wanted to come right into that New Testament Church and they felt like my goodness they could preach they could just take over the church because that's what they done out there so Paul felt that it was imper pertinent to the church and necessary of course for the church ages to be able to write and give them correction same with tongues interpretation because whenever the spirit of God fell some of them spoke in Tong some of them prophesied but they really didn't know so how do we do it what do we do with tongues and what do we do with interpretation so Paul as he began to write about it no doubt to many of them it was a great mystery listen in verse three but he that prophesied now first in verse one and two he's speaking about people speaking in tongues speaking in tongues of course can be tongues of men and tongues of angels now right here in the service last night there were several people the anointing was moving Among Us and the presence of God was falling among the people and there were several people that I'm told that was under the influence of the spirit of God and they were speaking in tongues and they were worshiping yet the speaking in tongues that they were doing was not to be interpreted it was not for edification to the body so what is a person doing when they're speaking in tongues and they're worshiping and they're just praising the Lord Brother Donnie do you believe in that with all of my heart I believe in it but if they are not speaking in a way that is to be interpreted then they are to speak to themsel and to the Lord and they are being blessed and they're being edified but now if someone speaks real real loud in the service and everybody is quiet and there is no interpreter then Paul said they're not supposed to do that unless there is an interpreter or they can interpret thems now actually speaking in tongues is the least of all the nine spiritual gifts I find that so amazing because it causes most of the problems so it's the least and yet it's one of the most misunderstood but he that prophesies speaketh unto men to edification now a person speaks in tongues and Paul himself said I thank God we really last week I speak in tongues more than you all but we don't have a recorded sermon in the entire Bible where Paul ever interrupted his sermon and spoke in tongues in that sermon so where did he speak in tongues apparently in prayer maybe along with God maybe an intercession we don't know but there's not one recorded sermon in the New Testament where Paul actually interrupted that sermon and Luke or whoever was wrote it down and Paul said whatever it was in a foreign language everybody understand that because Paul talked against that he said that he'd rather speak five words with understanding than 10,000 in another language so Paul said he that prophesies so now let's look at the meaning of the word we hear so much about it these days what does prophesy actually mean now let's forget what we think it means but this is the original Greek language that this was written in so you know the Bible wasn't written in English so we can't always take our English words and say well that's what it means the Bible wasn't written in English the New Testament was written in Greek and Aramaic so notice what the word prophesieth means speak forth by divine inspiration to predict the idea of foretelling future events now this is what Paul said when a man will prophesy which is NOT saying ah the Lord I'm here I'm here to bless I'm here or repeating scriptures that is not prophecy praise the Lord that is not predicting anything oh brother D what if they say the the Lord is coming the prophet said they're not supposed to say that in Prophecy well praise the Lord why because they're not under the true Spirit of Prophecy they're not predicting anything they're quoting scripture now notice Paul said he that prophesies speaketh unto men to edification again I look at the word so it's to predict the idea of of foretelling future events declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation actually what prophecy is is something that's not even written in the Bible praise the lord well I'll give you the quote for that in a few minutes it's actually something something that God wants to say but it's not written in the Bible why well God knows himself now look at the word what it where it comes from prophecy comes from the same root word of course which is Prophet so who do you figure in the five-fold ministry would understand the most about prophecy a pastor or a prophet look at his title his very title tells you what he's called to do understand prophecy so who would understand more about prophecy a teacher or a prophet an evangelist or a prophet a prophet is one who is sent his Visions is a declaration of things you can't find in the word so this is one of the reasons why that God tells us not to stand up and use vain repetitions and the prophet of God told us that prophecy is not standing up and just quoting scriptures over and over and over again now a preacher can do that that's what a preacher supposed to do but real prophecy is to say something that's not actually written in the Bible Well it really makes you wonder how much so-called prophesying is really coming from the Lord because it ain't matching up as what God's Prophet T now I know I'm weird okay y'all can say Amen to that don't bother me because I've been told that most of my life I'm weird I'm strange I'm really you know kind of a nerd I guess or whatever you want to call me but I'm I'm the kind of message preacher that I just simply believe that brother brandom was sent to restore us back to the original faith I simply believe that if he did not not have the understanding of the nine spiritual gifts we have been following the wrong man we have Wasted Years of our life and we need to repent and recant for saying we've been following the message of the hour because if he didn't understand the gifts he could not point us back to the original Apostolic teaching well I don't know what you believe about that statement I made but I believe that he did restore us back but the problem is tradition and preconceived ideas and it's one of the hardest things you'll ever do is to get some of these message preachers to admit they are wrong believe me I know I deal with them all the time but any man I don't care whether he's a preacher whether he's a teacher whether he's an evangelist whatever he is any man with the Holy Ghost will admit the word is right and he is wrong yes sir you can say a minute don't scare me now watch this so he that prophesies speaking unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church I would that you all speak with tongues praise the Lord anybody here not agree with that I would that you all speak with tongues but rather that you prophesy for greater is he that prophesy than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret now can a man or a woman have double gifts yes they could have diversities of tongues or they could have one tongue and they could speak in tongues and they could turn right around and interpret that tongue tongues an interpretation is prophecy now listen to this carefully one person could stand and speak in tongues and another one might stand thereafter and not interpret but actually prophesy now some would sit there and say now wait a minute wait a minute that's per that person seemed like they spoke about 15 words and then that other person seemed like they went went about 25 or or 30 words how can that be well the prophet explains it to us perfectly and God me misunderstood that one is speaking in tongues and the other one is prophesied but if a person is interpreting what another person is saying watch now the word this is the word that Paul used when said that if he speaks in tongues except he interpret look at what the word interpret means to unfold the meaning of what is said explain expound to translate into one's native language so then a person will interpret by explaining and will give this interpretation in their native language now look at verse 23 if therefore the whole church be come together in one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or unlearned he is convinced of all and is judged of all how so so if he would hear someone speaking in tongues and would all have to say if it was the spirit of God all them it was holy it was righteous it was something Supernatural that God was doing wouldn't it wouldn't it be genuine speaking in tongues have it have to be Supernatural and yet it would not turn a sinner like it would if everybody was prophesying now notice Paul doesn't say that a sinner or the unlearned would actually be convinced or judged by speaking in tongues but he would be convinced and judged by prophecy so would that turn a person to the Lord by a person standing up and quoting scriptures and say behold I'm coming I'm coming my coming is at the door the Rapture is near or I'm coming that's what's going to turn them to God you know why they're going to turn to God the answer is right here on these words listen Paul said one that is believe is not a one that is unlearned he is convinced now notice what prophecy is going to do to these individuals convince means reprove rebuke to convict refute confute generally with a suggestion of Shame of the person convicted by conviction to bring to the light so they're going to hear something in Prophecy that is is actually going to convict them and refute where they are what if a lot of what we're hearing is true prophecy why are not we seeing this now God's Bible does not lie right now notice what Paul then says he's convinced of all he's judged look at this word judge examine discern specifically in a forensic sense of a judge to hold an investigation so you mean prophecy is going to do that to an unbeliever or a sinner it's like a forensic investigation going on of what of this individual's life well how in the world is prophecy doing that if those that are prophesying say I'm coming I'm here I'm here here to bless they're not being judged they're not being examined so how in the world then is prophecy going to judge or examine a person's life and bring them under conviction praise the Lord you see this is the New Testament prophecy not the isua street version Oh My specifically in a forensic sense of a judge to hold an investigation interrogate examine the accused or the witness Now watch how verse 25 just explains that to you thus are the secrets of what so apparently prophecy then is going to say something to people that is going to reveal the secrets of of their hearts so does telling them the Lord's coming do that well if it should they should already be under conviction before the end of the service as much as I say it as much as all the rest of the preachers say it if that that alone will bring them under conviction and it will put them under a forensic investigation then we shouldn't even need tongues and interpretation because the preacher should do it but what is prophecy it's the spirit of God taking gift or gifts in people's lives and telling them you have sinned and it's making it so plain it scares the liver out of you and me while we're sitting there in the service and it puts us under the spotlight of God the prophet will give us some examples of it I don't mind telling you I can see exact EXA L why the devil don't want these real gifts in the church you talking about causing a Revival thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth so just by hearing us quote scriptures just by saying I'm the Lord I'm here I'm here tonight well we know that that a what prophecy does prophecy tells us something that is not written in the word praise the Lord notice this God being misunderstood brother neille when you all want to know now these people that's got these spiritual gifts if you all trust my understanding of the scripture and I hate to say it but the bottom line is there's a lot of folks problem even around this message they do not trust brother brenham's understanding of the scripture they trust their own better I will come down to the meeting and just with you alone that has gifts so we can set together and watch brother Neville and the church that is God God moving among them and that's what we want but we want to put that in order now listen it's amazing to me when you go to reading these quotes that some of the ones that push the gift so much they'll tighten up on you like a TT like a tick on a fat dog they'll just pull their shoes in oh my oh no oh no we're going to put it in order we're going to kill it say what he said if the word of God kills any gift it needs to be killed we want to put it in order so it can be a blessing to the church and do something now God I know I know the scriptures what to do and that's what we want to do you can imagine any preacher with the boldness to stand and go in the opposite direction re that when God's Prophet said he knew the scriptures and knew what to do and preachers in the M oh well we don't need that that ain't the way we do it at our church well that's the way we're going to do it at ours I want them myself anybody else here want them oh I want everything God's got for us but I do not want a Pentecostal impersonation I want a genuine notice he said so we're grateful now notice how brother brandham looked Gabriel's instruction of Daniel at Tong's interpretation and prophecy how it was going to help him in his prophetic office what a relief it is for me at home when I come home then that discernment on the prophetic side just tears me down and therefore God has sent me some relief relief for that through prophecy and speaking in tongues and interpretation which is prophecy and one time saying it apparently wasn't enough you want to say it again which is prophecy so you mean brother brandham looked to real tongues real interpretation as being equivalent to a prophetic gift of discernment as I've been looking at this I thought Lord thank you so much God knew that in every Church age there wouldn't actually even be a prophet God knew in every Church there wouldn't be be a prophet that would be able to have discernment but God said I'll tell you what I'll do I'll put some gifts in there then even when they're ain't a prophet them gifts will do the same thing them gifts will do the same thing oh you mean brother Donnie similar in the way it was like brother brandham this is the prophet himself saying this God has sent me some relief from that through prophecy and speaking in tongues and interpretation which is prophy Y which is prophecy now I find it amazing you know the lot Brothers they want to say well actually you know brother brandom did not preach that stuff out on the field brother bandam only taught that at his church so really it's not for message churches it's just for brandom Tabernacle only I just wish those brothers would have studied a little bit more and paid attention to the towns where brother brandham was when he was correcting you see he was not only here to preach a bride Revival he was a leoty and church AIDS messenger so he come to correct their errors now you know what I find amazing is I'm going to read you a quote here in a few minutes it goes back for 66 years and he was correcting things 66 years ago in the Pentecostal churches that we're having to correct and message churches I hope and pray to God that we've not gone backwards 66 years shouldn't we be further up the road friends than that you mean we're just now we we are just now back to what Leo DEA Pentecost was oh my look at this in s Caton which is saskatch in Canada 1957 speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues not a bunch of wild fire but genuine Holy Spirit Revelations coming tells things that happens right then not something that says Jesus is coming we believe that it's wrote In the book God don't use vain repetitions and he asked us not to do the same thing but it's something definite for somebody in the church for a purpose again he says when you go into a meeting the first thing you do you get up there and have a bunch of tongues and interpretation and somebody raise up and keep quoting the scripture what' he say it was carnal you me brother brandham said that when people speak in tongues and interpret and quoting scripture the prophet of God identified that as carnal but yet a lot of us are calling it so spiritual oh it was so spiritual really well it's for me in my house we following this Pentecost never produced a Rapture and it never will it takes the message of Malachi 4 now watch somebody raise up and keep qu in the scripture and that's carnal absolutely he says God said for us not to use vain repetitions what about him you see this is why he told us that don't use vain repetition because what you've got God doing is the thing he told us not to do himself so what if all the prophets after Moses Moses stood up and prophesied and God was the first prophesier in the the Book of Genesis chapter 3 and then Moses began to prophesy of course in the first five books of the Bible and then every other Prophet thereafter for thousands of years would stand up and say the same prophecies that Moses did I the Lord God I the Lord God will raise up a prophet like an unto me I will raise him from among your brethren and this is the way you'll know him so we'll say that was Joshua then here come another prophet Micah Zachariah Malachi oedi Jonah Nehemiah all these different ones of the Old Testament and they all stood up and said Hallelujah the whole hour the Lord God will raise up a prophet Laing unto me we didn't need a prophecy saying that that was written in the Torah in the law but what did God do if Isaiah would have said that we would have never had a prophecy about Behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son that was not written in Moses writings Zachariah could have never said behold the man whose name is the branch he shall come Isaiah could have never prophesied Hallelujah I feel like shouting a little bit now he could have never prophesied and said the lame man shall leap Us in heart why not just say what Moses said and just quote the scripture then naam would have never said that one day it would come to pass that the Chariots would jostle on the streets and the prophet said he looked at Chicago and saw Chicago and the Outer Drive around Chicago he didn't know what to call them he didn't didn't know that there was SUVs and cars and Cadillacs and trucks all he knew to call a moving vehicle in that day was a chariot so you imagine my vision he looks there and he says I see it I see it ha got 2:7 whenever he said the desire of All Nation shall come that was not written in the word that's true prophecy oh my notice brother R goes on to say tongues and interpretation it's right but it's to be a direct message to the church and to somebody not just carnal and things like that now that was at the Tabernacle Southern Pines North Carolina a BN a I mean a whole bunch of Pentecostal people 1958 66 years ago and then those discerners with the spirit of discernment thus sayeth the Lord now here the prophet is relating to these group of people how it was in his church at home so they would have people that spoke in tongues people that interpreted or people that prophesy and they would meet before church and they would pray and wait and pray and wait and if tongues came an interpreter they had at least three people sitting there with the spirit of discernment on them and they would hear the people speak in tongues and interpret or prophesy then the discerners would pray Lord was this you was this you and it had to be at least two out of the three that would say that's the Lord that's the Lord then they would write that down they'd lay it down up here on the pulpit and that prophecy was read that night now watch notice how brother Bram gives us examples of what went on in his church look friends I'm not talking about prophecies that were made out amongst the Pentecostals brother random was in New York in 1963 it was service after service Pentecostal jumped up interrupted his service prophesying speaking in tongues brother Brandon was courteous brother brandom would stop he would pause it would seem as if though he went along with every of it until you go home 1226 63 about a month later and whenever he's speaking to his home bride people and then he tells them if there's ever been a thorn in my side and then he goes to talking about that meeting he just come from in New York y'all had never heard that before yeah that's what he done so he calls that a thorn in his side what was it speaking in tongues interpretation soal prophecy soall he was courteous he was nice he would make way for it and let it happen but boy when he went back home I mean Katie bar the door here we come why he's out there trying to reach the Pentecostals but most of them would not be corrected may God have mercy on us that we don't take on that same Spirit now notice the example that he's giving whenever he's relating to how it went on in his church thus sayith the Lord tonight there'll be a woman come in from a certain place she'll have a green scarf over her head she'll be brought in she's from Ohio now remember this is not discernment from Brother brandom these were the gifted people that met in the room before church to have brother random to lay hands on her but first before doing that tell him to tell her now here these discerners and interpreters and all that they're writing this out and they're giving this and said tell brother brandom to tell this woman that when she was a treasur in a certain Church she stole money that's the reason she's paralyzed make that right and God will heal her a discerner raised up and said it was of God the other one said it was of God they put that message down when it come to the platform a little buzzer ranging from my study I walked out here are these prophecies was I give it to the people right the way it was wrote there with a man with the discernment right no slip UPS there they was here's brother Bram amongst and Pentecostals 66 years ago trying to straighten out tongues interpretation and prophecy Lord have mercy on us now what how he gives this scenario then that night there come a woman in she's in a wheelchair or a CAU whatever it was she's brought up got on a green scarf all the congregation's looking for now can you imagine if this happen at our church on Sunday and it's written down laying up here brother Lou whoever the song litter is either they do it or I do it and I walk out there we have a thus sayeth the Lord this morning T and interpretation came and the discerner said it was of the Lord there's supposed to be a man in this assembly this morning he got one leg shorter than the other one according to the prophecy that was given that man did something wrong he'll have on a certain tith he'll did a certain thing that man is here today if he'll repent God will heal him and make him well that man walks out of the back up there and said dear God have mercy that's me that's me but does that happen when we speak in tongues and interpret and simply quote scriptures but if we prophesy and reveal the secrets of the heart oh my goodness help us Lord Jesus sir there she was and I would say lady you stole that money out of the treasury when you was that's right that's right brother brandom that's right God forgive me I'll make it right stand up on your feet Jesus Christ makes you well there it was brother Jones move away tomorrow at 2:00 it's going to happen all right he moves away it happens fine we thank the Lord if it don't happen there's an evil spirit among them they don't get no more till they pray that thing away you don't want that Spirit on you you don't want no Folly you don't want no hoax you want the real holy ghost or don't pass any at all that's the way I feel put your church in that kind of an order listen to this and watch what Pentecost Rises to and we're absolutely scared to death that if we put it in prophetic order it'll kill it then we don't believe what he said he never said it would kill it it was not his desire to kill it why would a godsent prophet want to kill godsent gifts put your church in that kind of order and watch what Pentecost Rises to I differ with brother brandom well let's see if you differ with this that's the way Paul had it done that's the way it's done in the scripture you never find one example in history or in the church you know it bring it to me where they stood up thus say the Lord I'm here I'm coming I'm doing this and that and the other look at agabus in the New Testament took up a piece of Paul's garment and he come and bound his hands any know who Paul was thus sayith the Lord the man whose garment is is he's going to Jerusalem and he will be bound there same one prophesied about a dir which was a famine that was coming they did not do that in the Apostolic Church where does this come from isusa street isusa street and it tries to hide under the name of original Pentecost but devil let me make it known to you tonight old boy we've got got your number and this word is going to expose Your Hide you can't hide from the allseeing eye of Jesus devil praise the Lord now notice he said that's the way it was done in the scripture it's not just while somebody's speaking one raised up speak in tongues go make an alter call another speaks in tongues no interpretation no wonder it's Babylon my you've got something real I want you listen this friends out the outside world is hungering for it but not the way you're giving it to them they're hungering for it but not the way you're giving it to them that's right they long to find God neither do we want to go to the other side oh we don't believe in them old tongues that ain't nothing but a Pentecost brother Donnie he's always been that way he believes that I'll tell you why I believe it because it's in the Bible and it's in the message of the hour and it's each one of you young people's rights as Sons and Daughters of God to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul well all of you speak in tongues more than likely you won't but if God wants you to then you should give him your mouth so he can do that through you if God wants to prophesy through you so be it did not the Bible tell us again by prophecy when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost and said these are not drunk as youo as you suppose they are but this is that which was spoken what's he quoting prophecy but he wasn't standing quoting ah the Lord's coming I'm fixing to do this and I'm fixing to do that he was quoting a scripture that pertained to their day and Peter could say this day this scripture is fulfilled prophecy oh my I I hope and pray to God the bride of Christ Christ around the world and every nation gets so sincere with God and gets such a desire to have the spirit of God move Among Us that the phenomenal and the supernatural will be in every day of our life every service we have oh praise God what a time it would be to see God moving hallelujah praise the Lord talking to a brother today on the phone when I had the Saints last night lay their hands on one another brother thought he was going to have to leave cuz he had a such a terrible headache and the Saints around and begin to pray for him and he said brother Donnie God is my witness as them saints of God laid their hands on me that headache totally left me brother darl tell me about someone that was vomiting in blood last night and they was going to have to do something with him he prayed for the person right at the end of the service right at the end of the service they took the individual down and going to scope it it was totally gone couldn't find one SP spe of blood that's our lord Jesus don't tell me I don't believe in miracles I believe in miracles I am a miracle each one of you are a miracle I want the genuine I want the genuine Bible Holy Ghost hallelujah oh my thank you Jesus I'm sorry no I ain't watch this again in Tucson Tucson not Jeffersonville Tucson Gifts of tongues interpretation in tongues now that is just in repeating or something make a vain repetition it's saying something directly to be interpreted for a certain person in the congregation or something to make way tongues by interpretation is prophecy and it's prophetic utterance given to the people to tell them what to do or something to correct them oh if the great Church of the Living God could only be set in order praise God Grass Valley California see the Bible says as speakable tongues is edifying yourself unless there be an interpretation if the interpretation that's prophecy to the church Jeffersonville when anyone speak with tongues it must must be something to the church and it must happen too we if not have been evil spirit it must come to pass because interpretation of tongues is prophecy we know that's right so we try to live the Bible just the way it's taught Church order which a lot of preachers don't like I love it now we all know that the Lord is coming we're aware of that and if Neville brother Neville got up each night and said behold the Lord is coming behold the Lord is coming that would be all right but he's saying that the pastor at the platform he's got the word for that now watch him on down as he comes down in this quote a little farther tongues interpretation of tongues which is prophecy or a prophet speaking that's something that's not written in the word don't you understand why some folks feel safe and they're prophesying by just quoting scripture it don't put them under pressure the Sunday morning a man will come in or a woman will come in dressed in a certain thing there ain't no pressure by just standing up quoting scripture do we want the real or do we want a dime store copy praise the Lord is that what y'all want y'all want a diamonda you want a diamonda copy no brother Paul is that what you want what about the rest you Sisters You Brothers you want a real you want a dime store copy that just just acts like don't you understand why Satan does that to us he scared to death of the real and if he can bring something up that just don't quite line up and people will see a failure and you mark her down you will see failures and there will be more and more if people don't line up by the prophecy why i't trying to scare you no no no no you do whatever you want to do I'm only telling you what the message tells us mama notice this behold the Lord is coming the Lord is coming but he said he's saying that the pastor at the platform he's got that the word for tongues interpretation of tongues which is prophecy or a prophet speaking that's something that's not written in the word what's written in the word he's to bring it that's what his preachers are supposed to bring of course but what's not written in the word you're to tell him so if it's genuine prophecy then it can tell me brother Donnie when you get up Sunday You Preach for so long and you'll watch this certain person come in and you watch them they're going to be saved you can tell me if it's true prophecy praise the Lord like for instance tell brother wheeler thus sayith the Lord tomorrow in his sand pit not to go down to it because there'll be a truck turnover or something like that it's got to be done now you spoke it he's interpreted then lay it on the platform after your ministry is finished not after to the church the hymn start singing and so forth your ministry is finished then let them come forth with what prophecy has been given wow man that's kind of plain ain't it tell brother Jared to be careful tomorrow because he's going to borrow his daddy's truck and whenever he does there's going to be a certain something or another in the road and whenever he does somebody lock lost an axle out of their car and is going to go up the whole side of his truck and his daddy's literally going to kill him so tell him do not borrow that truck tomorrow but instead most of ours are so vague praise the Lord praise the Lord question answer 64 now I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in interpretation but it must say it with me must be something directly to to the church not the Lord is coming soon or something which is all right but don't use vain repetitions Jesus said as a heathens do it must be something go tell brother so and so a certain thing that he done why go tell brother and sister so and so when they did a certain thing the other day she transgressed the law of her husband's AOW to her husband unless she makes this thing right the holy spirit will cut her off wow don't you understand what tongues and interpretation really is it brings the peretic gift and puts it in every local body I wonder how many of us would pray a little more if that started happening Among Us I wonder how many of us would come in here with a different attitude to church well I'll tell you one thing I I didn't like it because Brother Louie didn't leave the singer last night I've just got a real attitude I'll tell you I just don't I don't understand why it went that way it was three deg too cool for me in church tonight I couldn't get in for nothing in this world wouldn't you hate for God to prophesy to somebody and say brother Jonathan you had an attitude there Wednesday night boy don't do that again God's going to cut you off son you come to the house of God to worship you come to praise him you come oh brother Ram said people ain't worshippers that's the problem well it's too hot it's too cold there's trouble in the church this ain't going on he said you ain't no worshipper a worshipper comes to worship God if everything is going wrong if it's cold if it's hot oh my if there's trouble in the church a worshipper comes to worship God if they're the only one doing it if there's 500 sitting there and there's dead as a mouse they're going they ain't moving that worshipper that worshipper is there to praise God oh my God we that's what we want to do notice then you've got th thus say the Lord then bring sin in that's when you got a church like it was with Anan and Safara then we got a church that stands solid and everybody said am okay now y'all can breathe a deep breast all of you on the internet you preachers that have passed out wake them wake them wake them up now because I'm going to go to another question now y'all can think I'm anointed of the Holy Ghost now this is from an individual that I mentioned to you about that had some questions and I asked them if it was all right if I use their questions it doesn't make any sense to me that the Bible says they ate of a fruit and somehow out of that we got that Eve had sex with a snake my answer to this individual when I was there with them and their home was we do not believe that Eve had sex with a snake the Bible does not call the serpent a snake but it says it's the most subtle beast of the field now let's read if you would in Genesis CH 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made so he was a beast of the field and he said unto the woman so this is not a snake have many ever seen a talking snake I mean maybe some two-legged ones but you know nothing on their belly so this whatever this creature was could talk it could reason it could think now notice and he said unto the woman yeah as God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent so he's not you know standing up on his tail and and she's interpreting and then out of that she gets this interpretation of well the Lord God said this no he's actually talking cuz he had a voice and it was not on his belly but he was standing up right and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden look up here on the screen now at the meaning of the word fruit wow produce of the ground also the same word in the Hebrew sense is used for the word offspring Children progyny of the womb wow so we ain't talking about an apple or a Pon or a peach or a pear it was a pear all right the pear on the ground not the p e a r but the woman and the serpent so look at what she said now we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden now does God always come right out and speak plain and simple or does God sometimes Veil his terms we know he does what's this in Genesis 30:2 Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel and he said am I God said a you remember the Bible Rachel is really upset because she's not had any children and she comes to to Jacob and said give me children there I die give me children there I die and he said am I God am I God dead who hath withheld from Thee the fruit of the womb so this was common then in the Hebrew language that children or The Offspring were considered to be fruit of the womb Deuteronomy 7:13 he will love thee and bless thee Moses prophesying now to the children of Israel he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land and thy corn and thy wine so God uses the term fruit not only to describe what was on the tree but also on the woman tree Psalms 1273 Lo children are an Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward so then does the bible also take trees are trees always mentioned in the Bible in the literal sense or can trees be used in a sign as a symbol or metaphorically in other words God would use a tree but it wouldn't actually mean something s there with bark and branches and leaves so look in Psalms 1:2 blessed is the man who walketh not the counts of the ungodly this is why D David starts it out and in verse two he said his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and shall bring forth his fruit in his season his Leaf so God is taking a tree and likening a righteous man or woman to a tree and everybody said amen okay now watch so God says they can be like that Psalms 37:35 I've seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a Green Bay Tree Psalms 528 I am like a green olive tree in the house of God I trust in thy mercy oh God forever and ever notice how David likened himself to a green olive tree now a green olive tree was an olive tree in its use it was very flexible so when the wind would come it was very flexible and David said when I'm in the house of God I I'm like a green olive tree I just worship and I raise my branches to God and the wind comes through and it just VI just B in the presence of God so David likened himself as a worshipper to being like a green olive tree Psalms 9212 the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon Proverbs 11:30 the fruit of the righteous oh my goodness the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life a tree of life he that WTH Sal is wise Song of Solomon 2:3 as the apple tree among the Trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons this is the bride likening the Lord Jesus to an apple tree among the rest of the woods now an apple tree was a very special thing to them because it produces constant fruit which they love so she looked at Jesus and said that he sticks out from arrest of he's just totally different from everybody else there's something special about him and my heart yearns for him so she said he's like an apple tree amongst all the rest of the Trees of the wood so she's comparing him to all the rest of the sons of men I sat down under his shadow with great Delight Ezekiel 318 the cedars in the garden of God could not hide him the fur trees were not like his bows and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of God never remember we're talking back past tense but also prophetically of the great cherub that was in the garden of God and he was like a tree a tree in the garden now not an oak not a walnut not a hickory not a pine but a being that was likened to a tree look at Daniel's interpretation of the King's dream Daniel 4:20 the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto Heaven and the sight thereof to all the Earth whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation it is thou oh King now you wonder why the God why that God would give this man this complicated dream why didn't God just tell him hey look buddy you know what you're the beginning of the Gentile Kingdom and and you're the main man right now okay you got it okay it's that simple but God don't do it that way God wants to reveal himself through prophecy he loves to reveal himself through correct prophecy so he gives this man this complicated dream and then the way dreams were interpreted was by a prophet so the Prophet Daniel and the prophet of God in our day tells us the way that a dream is is interpreted when a dream was told to a prophet that the prophet sees that dream in a vision brother R said people would come to him and say brother ROM I had a dream about this and this and he said he would start seeing their dream and a vision and he'd say why did you leave that part out of that dream you never told me this and you never told me that in the dream that's the way a dream was interpreted so he would receive the dream so the king the king had the dream and then Daniel Rees the dream in a vision because the god that can show you the dream and a vision can certainly interpret it to you that's the way brother R said you'll know it's a true interpretation so here he sees it and whenever he gets done with the vision he looks at and he says well all these branches and and and all this oh oh it it's you so all these people are gaining sustenance on under Europe they're getting shade and they're getting strength well that's all the kingdoms of the known world they're all reaping because they're under your bowels and under your your leaves and they're benefiting by you so oh King the tree is you praise God John the Baptist Matthew 3:8 bring the fruit therefore fruits meet for repentance think not to say within ourselves yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham now the axe is laid unto the root of the trees so was John fixing to make some furniture with John chopping firewood cuz he's cold out there and he's fixing to make cut down some trees is that what John was talking about he was talking about them people that was standing there and tell him the ax is laid to the root of the tree you're fixing to get chopped down if you don't get life in you that's the way prophets spoke in symbols oh praise God notice again Jesus Matthew 7:18 a great good tree can not bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is sh Down cast into the fire again is Jesus talking about going through an orchard and cutting them down Matthew 7:20 wherefore by their fruits you shall know them Luke 23:30 then shall they begin to say unto the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us for they have they do these things in a green tree and Jesus is identifying him himself as a tree what will they do in a drive which in case you don't know is us now go back to Genesis 3 and we'll stop here in a few minutes but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die proverbs 30 and 20 such is the way of an adulterous woman now listen what Eve said but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness so to edus was not her reaching up on a tree and pting off an apple and eating it was her partaking of a forbidden fruit and the adulterous woman eateth and wipeth her mouth and says I have done no wickedness now notice again in the same term as far as Eed us what it means John 653 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you now how many believe you all have the life Christ in you tonight have you ever ate his flesh anybody here ever drunk of the literal blood of the Lord Jesus ain't none of us even believes he literally meant that do we no for what's he talking about in a symbol so partaking in the Bible is many times identified as eating oh my notice this verse 54 who's so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is me and deed you imagine now some of them scribes and Pharisees they probably thought this man is a canable this man is a vampire he's an absolute nut I just wonder what these priests now and these leaders told their people when they got back to church the next Sunday said now tell you what I S you down there at that meeting and I couldn't believe that you was there I'm I'm just telling you I'm I was so disappointed in you now surely you did not believe I've been telling you that man is a Madman I've been telling you that man he was born an illegitimate child and and they're they're all they're all they're all weird they're all strange and this guy is the worst case that we have ever seen this man was standing there and telling people they had to literally eat his body and drink his blood now you see I've been warning you this guy is a false false prophet but if you would have been a seed of God in that day You' have said Rabbi I love you with all my heart but I'm going to hear Jesus next Saturday I'm going to hear Jesus next Sunday they wouldn't be able to kept you away from it I don't care what they said because there's something in his voice that was drawing on that seed in your soul praise God notice let's jump down you to verse 58 this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat man and are dead that he that eateth of this bread shall live forever back to Genesis 3:4 and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God does know in the day that you eat thereof your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil verse six so you mean eating an apple will open your eyes to Good and Evil wow reckon it was a Macintosh honey crisp I know what it was a granny smith you mean eating a fruit will open your eyes it's partaking of something can I have a few more minutes I can't stop right now if you got to go go on but I can't stop right now we got to get a little bit of this next verse and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food look at the word good Pleasant agreeable to the senses prosperous of man's sensuous nature now have any of y all ever looked at an apple tree and felt that way I'm going to tell you you are really weird you're really strange anybody you you you look at a natural tree and a tree a natural tree would make you feel this way of course it wouldn't but she saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant now remember the Old Testament was written in Hebrew not English this is the Hebrew word t desire longing of one's heart lust what lust appetite covetousness object of a desire so the woman sees whatever this tree was she sees it and she goes to feeling something she's never felt before and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired wow covet take pleasure in to Delight greatly desire greatly to make one wise she took of the fruit took Mary take a wife snatch away take two or four a person what are we talking about we're talking about a union a sexual Union not reaching up and picking a palm ground I oh I so smart after eating that peach well some of y'all's going to be doing that for your next test right forget studying just eat all the peaches you want get all the pears all the pumpkins whatever more we know better than that you know what I I feel so sorry for the people of the world that read this Bible they read this Genesis forwards and backwards and they read right over the top of this this is one of the Mysteries to be restored in the last day and we understand it thank God thank God so she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her she gave unto her husband with her his partaking was not by himself but with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked I repeat what brother random said if eating apples makes people realize are naked we need to pass the apples again and somebody said and the eyes of them BS were opened and they knew that they were naked and they seed fig leaves together and made themselves a face mask wa now wait a minute if the mouse is the guilty part why are they sewing fig leaves together to make themselves a loin cloth right now the English says apron but look at the Hebrew word loin covering belt or loin cloths so they ate with ser mouth and they cover the middle part of their body yes sir why they're covering where they were guilty oh my goodness and made themselves loin cloths verse n and the Lord God called unto Adam and said Where Art Thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I hid I was naked and I hid myself and he said who not what tree not what fruit who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman who thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said un the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said said the serpent beguiled deceived to be beguiled the serpent beguiles me and I did eat wow Paul in 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent Opus this is the Greek word with the Ancients the serpent was an emblem of cunning and wisdom the serpent who deceived Eve was regarded by the Jews as the devil and yet here Paul is talking about the New Testament Church and them getting married why in the world would he go back to the Garden of Eden because once again you have a another Eve and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life so he was not on his belly until then I will put imity between thee and the woman and between thy seed I thought most snakes laid eggs there only about seven pieces of them that actually live Bear all the rest of them lay eggs God wasn't speaking to a snake so you mean the serpent had a seed people say oh that serpent seeds of the devil I agree with that but the doctrine is the truth from God serpent seeds of the devil but God God said the serpent had a seed we going to believe God or some doctor of theology I'll believe God Amen let's stand together look at this word seed I will put imity between thee and the woman between thy seed look at the meaning of the word thy seed sewing Offspring Sean descendants posterity ch children it's just as plain as plain can be sir when God opens your understanding unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy chewing and thy Bing because thou bidest an apple off of the tree from now on when you eat your supper you will have great pain in your mouse what that wasn't it well well my goodness how strange God said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy what conception what's that got to do even an apple God's punishing the area where the guilt is yes sir oh my and thy desire longing craving of a man for a woman or a woman for a man why is God dealing with this why do you think there had to be a virgin birth If the fall was by eating of fruit then Redemption should have been yes sir the Lord Jesus coming from heaven with some type of fruit off the tree of life or some of the fruit we're going to eat eat and live forever because our youth will be renewed forever the prophet tells us and the Lord Jesus comes down and he brings all these B just back baskets and baskets and baskets of fruit that's Redemption because that was the cause of the Fall according to most people then we go over and we take of that fruit and we eat of it and we got eternal life and we go back to and young men and young women and we never get sick so why was it there had to be a virgin to conceive because God prophesied and said your seed serpent will be against the seed of the woman and the woman don't even have a seed she has an a field an egg the seed comes from the man God prophesying saying I will create a seed God did aren't you glad he did praise the Lord let's bow our heads together praise the Lord oh Jesus we thank you for this privilege tonight father that we would be able to come together Lord and try my best to answer the questions of these young people they're not asking them to be argumentative lord they're not asking them to debate they want to know Lord I pray that you would help me I've got many more that they've asked about various subjects and I'm seeking your leadership Lord on how to answer them even what order to put them in Lord I pray you'd help me I'm grateful that they're willing to come Lord many of you here last night and they turn right back around and come again tonight to be able to be in this service I pray you'd bless for that effort father may you open our understanding thank you for letting us see this great truth Lord we're so glad that we really understand what Redemption is all about we thank you that we can see father why you had to come to the Earth you could not come as an angel you had to come as a man Adam as a man forfeited our rights in the Garden of Eden Jesus as a man you forfeited your rights in the Garden of Gethsemane that we could stand here tonight and be saved it was lost through a woman a woman falling in Paradise it would be regained by another woman Mary a woman turned it down another woman accepted it and gave the word her body by which the word could be created and grow inside of her not one Speck of her blood was in your body but it was holy created blood so if there's a cner here tonight or a backslider they're not made clean by The Blood of Mary and Joseph but they're made clean by the blood of God we love you tonight Jesus I pray for those maybe that's been around the message for years and years if they live listen to this tonight I pray you'd open it up to them and make it even clearer than it's ever been before I never study it Lord that I don't see more about it I thank you for that it lets us know that the message we have is not a dead word it's a living word because every time we go to reading it every time we go to studying and applying ourselves we find the same tape we listened to before the same book we read before we'll get more out of it more out of it more out of it it's a living message it's not dead it's alive oh Jesus we worship you tonight father thank you Lord God thank you Lord God hallelujah hallelujah there might be somebody here tonight with a special need in your life and we certainly be glad to pray for if you want to come up here we will but if you just like to stand there where you are with no one looking around at you you just raise your hand you say Lord you know what my need is maybe you need healing maybe you need Deliverance of something maybe you're just in a low spot in your life we know we all get there sometimes and we need encouragement we need another touch from the presence of the Lord whatever in need tonight would you just raise your hand there to the Lord may I not just limit it to the visible audience but maybe some of you not sitting at home you've streamed the service and

night that I I realized how little I know when you hear when let me rephrase that how little of simple things that I know because the devil will try to make you over complicated I remember when I was a teenager you know I was I was in church but that was it I was raised in church I did my thing I was backslid I did whatever backslid Church kid does and I always thought that I wasn't a Christian because I couldn't understand things I always thought you read the Bible you go to church you hear it preached you're supposed to if you're a Christian if you got the Holy Ghost and you're going to understand it all you know when he was he was talking a while ago about when Jesus told the disciples Jesus looked at everybody that was there and he's in his in his heart Jesus says this is too many there's too many of y'all except you eat my flesh you drink my blood you'll have no part and they all turned it left and walked away except the 12 you got to understand them 12 still didn't know what he meant they didn't know what he meant but they knew who he was thank you thank Lord questions and answers didn't happen in 1960s and 50s that happened in the four gopel Els Jesus would talk to the the Pharisees he would talk to the go the synagogue and he would say the sewer went forth and he sowed seed some fell on the good ground some fell in amongst the thorns and the thistles and some fell on the [Music] stones talk about the the man the rich man owned the vineyard and he gave it to his son and he gave an overseer and he would talk to these Parables they wouldn't the disciples had predestinated eternal life and they didn't understand it so what would they do they would go have question and answers with him what did you mean by this what did you mean by that and the Bible says he said it so they could understand so if you don't like question and answers I love it I love it cuz I I have to have things simple if brother brandom hadn't preached God in Simplicity before he preached the breach in the seals I still will not have understanding cuz he explains so much in God in Simplicity to not overthink them seals so just sometimes say you got a question you don't understand don't let Satan beat you up with that that's we we got a pastor here that's as we he read that quote I'm going to I'm going to have him send me that quote because brother brandom said that's what the pastor is for for doing question and answers that's what I got out of it and probably wasn't in that verbiage itself pastor's duty is to answer the question and answers so I appreciate it I appreciate it I'm looking for the next one I guess we're going to for a little while go every other Thursday or whatever he says so me and me and brother Rob think we got the rains for a little bit and then we find out we're just we got the bits but we love it I I I appreciate y'all every one of you I I count it an honor to be one of your brothers and it's it's an honor to serve with brother Rob brother Joel and brother brother Daryl and and the pastor it's just a it's an honor you know we're we're going to we're getting through Satan's Eden the minute of the Rapture you still probably won't understand everything so brother BR said pray for understanding pray for understanding and turn in your question so I love you with all my heart um look forward to I look forward to seeing all you young people on Sundays and Wednesdays it's just a joy to to to see you just to see you people that have a desire to be in church it just does my heart good brother Maurice would you come up here
