[35:06] night amen I love to go to church
[35:11] absolutely love to go to church I like
[35:14] going to church even when I ain't
[35:16] preaching I like hearing the word when I
[35:19] ain't preaching which is very rare I get
[35:21] to do that but I really enjoy it I just
[35:23] love going to church you know you've
[35:25] seen a lot of preachers they're Wilding
[35:27] a buck they're preaching and when they
[35:29] ain't preaching they're As Dead As a
[35:30] hammer so I realized a long time ago a
[35:33] lot of preachers don't get turned around
[35:34] with the word but they get turned on by
[35:36] when they're preaching the word which
[35:38] seems really strange to me I think we
[35:40] ought to the word ought to just bless us
[35:42] whether we're in our church or in a
[35:44] visiting church or at a youth camp or
[35:47] when you're at home listening to a tape
[35:50] praise the Lord I think the word of God
[35:52] ought to excite us and get us ready to
[35:54] leave this world we're living in an
[35:57] awful time a dark time a dreadful time a
[36:01] pitiful time a sad time a wretched time
[36:03] a dark time but we're living in the
[36:05] greatest hour a person could ever live
[36:08] to be a child of God because the events
[36:11] that have been longed for and waited for
[36:14] for thousands of years are within our
[36:20] reach we are that close Amen to the
[36:23] resurrection
[36:25] amen that close to the WRA rure that
[36:29] close to so many great things
[36:32] happening amen God bless you well how
[36:35] y'all
[36:36] doing that was my little warm-up sermon
[36:38] y'all didn't like it very well but I
[36:40] guess I'll try another one
[36:46] then praise the lord lord weling

[36:58] remember that service will begin at 7
[37:01] let's turn tonight if you would to 1
[37:02] Corinthians chap 15 verse
[37:07] 47 the first man is of the earth
[37:12] earthy the first man is of the Earth
[37:15] Earth it now Paul is not speaking about
[37:17] the order of the
[37:20] creation of the soul of Adam but he's
[37:24] speaking about Adam
[37:28] Adam is the Hebrew word that God gave to
[37:32] man which means
[37:35] red he's out of the
[37:37] earth so Paul says the first man is of
[37:41] the
[37:42] earth earthy isn't it amazing that he
[37:45] doesn't say
[37:48] Earthly but
[37:50] earthy
[37:52] earthy the second man is the Lord From
[37:56] Heaven course he knows the Lord
[37:59] Jesus as is the
[38:02] earthy such are they also that are
[38:07] earthy everybody I see here tonight is
[38:13] earthy right the man you're looking at
[38:16] in the Pulpit is earthy but I hope
[38:20] there's another part about all of us
[38:22] that is
[38:24] Heavenly as is the earthy such are they
[38:28] also that are earthy which is what
[38:31] causes us all of our problems and as is
[38:35] the
[38:38] Heavenly such are they also that
[38:42] are
[38:44] Heavenly as we have borne the image of
[38:50] the earth everybody look this
[38:52] way this jacket right here and this suit
[38:58] they're made out of a pattern of
[39:01] course they pile layer on top of layer
[39:04] on top of layer Caroline I used to work
[39:06] at a garment Factory in Kentucky before
[39:08] I went
[39:09] fulltime so I worked in the shipping
[39:11] Department which was right next door to
[39:14] the cutting department so they had these
[39:17] gigantic long tables and them guys would
[39:20] take them rolls of fabric and go back
[39:22] and forth and back and forth and back
[39:24] and forth uh Karen Harry's wife brother
[39:27] used to work in that department where
[39:29] they lay it all out then they would take
[39:32] these gigantic long
[39:34] patterns and sometimes the layers of
[39:37] fabric it's unbelievable how high they
[39:40] would make them so then they had the
[39:42] Cutters so they'd lay out these big long
[39:46] patterns and all the Cutters would do is
[39:48] go in there if they can follow the line
[39:50] they'd take them sharp knives big old
[39:52] blades about that long and they would go
[39:54] through and cut all of that out then
[39:57] they would have people that would bundle
[39:59] it up so this is j3 this is J2 this is
[40:03] J10 this is J1 then they would take it
[40:07] in buggies big old buggies and take it
[40:09] over to the ladies department for them
[40:12] to start sewing so they would start
[40:15] putting it all together now they would
[40:18] have random of course sizes they made
[40:21] ladies pajamas Women's and Children's
[40:25] they would have pajamas they would have
[40:27] gowns they would have house coats but
[40:30] you know they didn't have one that would
[40:32] say for people they didn't measure them
[40:34] this way so we'll make one for women
[40:36] that are 5T tall and then we'll make
[40:39] another one for women that are 6 foot
[40:41] tall and then we'll make one for women
[40:43] that are in between that 5 and 1/2 ft
[40:45] tall so they would have small medium and
[40:49] large now in that whenever them women
[40:52] would buy that from Alden from Spiegel
[40:56] from all these different places that
[40:58] garment would take on the image of the
[41:02] person who put it on no doubt this
[41:06] suit made in
[41:09] China no telling how many men wound up
[41:12] with the exact same suit that I got but
[41:17] yet that suit will take the shape of the
[41:22] person who's wearing it now let's say it
[41:24] this way if I was some what of a larger
[41:30] composition was that a nice way of
[41:33] saying that or
[41:35] what so then this coat would not do like
[41:40] this well you could wrap it way around
[41:42] this
[41:43] way but it might take more of this
[41:47] shape okay so instead of my little
[41:50] skinny arms and it was a guy that was
[41:52] big Brony Guy what's that jacket going
[41:55] to do it's going to to take on his image
[42:00] so if it was a guy like brother Paul
[42:02] quite a bit taller than I am and he
[42:04] would have on my
[42:06] pants he would go around looking like
[42:09] this why same suit taken on the image of
[42:15] the person it goes
[42:17] on so our lord Jesus had to come to the
[42:21] Earth and take on an
[42:24] earthy
[42:25] image now as we have born I read this to
[42:29] you last time we looked at this where to
[42:32] Bear constantly of clothing or garments
[42:36] so as we have borne the image of the
[42:39] earthy we shall also bear the image of
[42:44] the Heavenly now this I say Brethren
[42:47] that flesh and blood cannot
[42:50] inherit the kingdom of God I remind you
[42:54] again he didn't say flesh and
[42:58] Bones Jesus after his resurrection
[43:02] said a spirit hasth not Flesh and
[43:07] Bones as you see me have but Jesus in
[43:11] his new body did not have
[43:15] blood we will not live off of blood in
[43:20] the glorified body now this I say
[43:23] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[43:25] inherit the kingdom of God neither does
[43:28] corruption inherit
[43:32] incorruption how many in your Earthly
[43:34] house tonight has
[43:36] needs desires petitions before the Lord
[43:41] let's take them to
[43:43] him Lord Jesus how grateful we are that
[43:46] we could gather here tonight father it's
[43:48] such a privilege and also an honor for
[43:52] us to be gathered together we know also
[43:55] our responsibility
[43:57] for we are going to give an account for
[44:00] our
[44:01] opportunity Lord God we believe that
[44:05] church is not a
[44:06] routine it's not a
[44:08] ritual it's an awesome thing by which we
[44:11] have been made partakers of and because
[44:15] it is so awesome anything that you give
[44:18] us it is so awesome also has a great
[44:22] responsibility with it then we will
[44:25] answer for how we treat that awesome
[44:29] gift that you've given to us so we want
[44:33] to look at it that way that every time
[44:35] we come to church every time we come to
[44:37] the house of God that we know that it's
[44:41] not only a blessing not only a privilege
[44:44] not only an honor but also a
[44:48] responsibility so every service that we
[44:50] participate in we will give an account
[44:54] for that service for those services that
[44:56] we could have have attended and we just
[44:59] decided not to little do people know
[45:03] they will also give account of
[45:05] those I pray that you would help each of
[45:08] us to realize what an awesome thing it
[45:11] is to be the children of God speak to us
[45:15] tonight from your word father in the
[45:17] name of Jesus we ask it and the church
[45:20] said
[45:23] amen the church said amen yeah okay I
[45:28] think I'll go ahead and preach to you
[45:29] then that other one sound like a Church
[45:31] of
[45:31] Christ you can be seated God bless
[45:37] you praise the
[45:40] Lord
[45:41] let's
[45:44] revisit the
[45:47] crucifixion of our Lord Jesus now before
[45:50] we go into this tonight in
[45:54] Corinthians I know we've talked about a
[45:56] little lot and many of you have read
[45:58] about it a lot and you've heard it
[46:00] preached a
[46:01] lot read with me in Matthew 27
[46:07] 45 now from the
[46:10] sixth
[46:12] hour there was
[46:14] Darkness over all the
[46:17] land until the ninth
[46:21] hour now with both
[46:24] Luke and Matthew the the Greek word that
[46:27] they use here for
[46:30] land is not a regional
[46:35] word that would have been applicable to
[46:38] Israel
[46:40] only but it's very unique the word that
[46:43] they use was like the whole earth the
[46:49] entirety of the mass of the earth now
[46:54] listen to that carefully again from the
[46:57] sixth hour there was Darkness over all
[47:02] the
[47:04] land until the night
[47:08] hour so they kept time a lot different
[47:12] from
[47:13] us so around 6:00 in the morning would
[47:17] have been the first hour so the sixth
[47:20] hour then would have been noon the 9th
[47:23] hour would have been
[47:25] 3:00 in the
[47:27] afternoon so about the 9th hour Jesus
[47:32] cried with a loud
[47:36] voice a loud voice
[47:40] Eli
[47:42] Eli L
[47:46] saai that is to say my God my God why
[47:51] hast Thou forsaken me so from 12:00
[47:57] as we would say it today till
[48:00] 3:00 there was this darkness that was
[48:05] over the entire
[48:09] Earth seemed quite
[48:11] unusual now it was indicating that there
[48:14] was a far greater
[48:18] extent of the darkness than just in a
[48:22] local
[48:24] scenario it was a Darkness
[48:27] that the entire Earth had
[48:31] experienced it was not a local
[48:35] phenomenon it was not even a an
[48:40] eclipse now they had eclipses of course
[48:43] before this but as most of you know
[48:47] those eclipses only last for a few
[48:52] minutes and the Passover this is the
[48:57] Passover time and Passover was always
[49:02] held in the time of the full moon which
[49:08] an
[49:09] eclipse at the lunar calendar could not
[49:13] happen in a full moon
[49:16] cycle so God is doing something that is
[49:21] very very rare and he's making the
[49:25] heavens test testify of a
[49:29] supernatural phenomena so the longest
[49:33] Eclipse would be no more than two to
[49:37] three
[49:38] minutes so whatever is going
[49:42] on happened for 3
[49:46] hours so the reason that the darkness
[49:51] prevailed upon the
[49:53] Earth is because the Sun
[49:57] is
[49:58] failing to
[50:00] shine now think of what the sun is so
[50:04] the sun I found this very interesting
[50:07] the reason for this Darkness was the
[50:10] Sun's light was failing the sun itself
[50:15] is but a vast nuclear
[50:19] fire a
[50:20] sustained and
[50:23] continued
[50:24] reaction in which the Sun's mass is
[50:29] being
[50:30] reduced at a rate of four million
[50:36] tons per
[50:39] second now listen this nuclear fire that
[50:43] is happening on the surface of the Sun
[50:46] so the Sun's mass is being reduced at a
[50:51] rate of 4 million
[50:54] tons per second
[50:57] so that is over 14 billion
[51:01] tons an
[51:03] hour this is how much the mass of the
[51:07] Sun is being consumed in order to give
[51:11] us the light and the warmth and the Rays
[51:15] that comes from the Sun so in an hour 14
[51:20] billion tons of the Sun's mass is being
[51:25] consumed so God
[51:28] halted the reaction for three hours of
[51:33] the son's Mass being
[51:37] consumed so while the son of
[51:42] righteousness is hanging on the
[51:46] cross God would not let the
[51:49] son project its light to the
[51:53] Earth for three hours
[51:58] it hung in shame and
[52:03] humiliation
[52:04] tulan said
[52:07] this in the same hour too the light of
[52:11] day was
[52:13] withdrawn when the son at the very time
[52:18] was in his Meridian
[52:22] Blaze those who were not aware that this
[52:26] had been
[52:27] predicted about Christ no doubt
[52:31] thought it was an
[52:34] eclipse you yourselves have the
[52:38] account of the world portant still in
[52:42] your
[52:44] archives now tertian what he had done he
[52:48] had appealed and written to
[52:52] proculus which was a
[52:55] Roman
[52:57] senator now listen I've got a reasoning
[53:00] going this
[53:01] way the Lord God is going to have this
[53:06] written and
[53:08] validated in the historical
[53:12] records so this was not known just by
[53:17] Christians but it was known by the
[53:21] Roman government amen now listen so
[53:25] tertullian
[53:27] appealed to proculus a Roman Senator and
[53:32] it is certain tertian would not have
[53:34] made such an appeal to the Roman records
[53:39] had it not been
[53:41] true I found this next one just as
[53:45] overwhelming Pontius
[53:48] Pilate sent the following
[53:51] report to
[53:53] Tiberius
[53:55] emperor of
[53:57] Rome and when he had been
[54:02] crucified there was Darkness over the
[54:04] whole
[54:06] Earth the Sun oh my having been
[54:10] completely hidden and the heaven
[54:13] appearing dark so that the Stars
[54:18] appeared but had at the same time their
[54:22] brightness darkened as i s suppose your
[54:29] reverence is not ignorant
[54:32] of because in all the world they lighted
[54:38] lamps from the sixth hour until the
[54:43] evening and the Moon being like
[54:47] blood did not Shine the whole
[54:52] night yet she happened to be
[54:57] at the
[55:00] full now I find it amazing how that God
[55:05] will correlate certain
[55:08] things when he wants them
[55:12] known and Records to be kept about
[55:17] them and yet he can also allow something
[55:23] that we would think would be very
[55:26] similar to it and he would allow it to
[55:31] be a
[55:33] secret so it all depends on the
[55:37] orchestrator
[55:39] himself and how that he will lay out the
[55:43] program of his word now what man does
[55:46] man will
[55:49] look at something that God has
[55:52] done and then he will take his own mind
[55:57] and look at prophetic things and think
[55:59] well if God did this this certain
[56:02] certain way right here then if God is
[56:05] going to do something else then God has
[56:07] to do it exactly the same way cuz we
[56:10] just we just know that's the way he'll
[56:12] do it no we're guessing that's the way
[56:16] he will do it but sometimes he will take
[56:21] something though it looks very similar
[56:24] and he will do it in a complete complet
[56:27] different way now notice Jesus hanging
[56:31] now on the cross and again Matthew 27:15
[56:36] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[56:41] loud
[56:43] voice yielded up the
[56:47] ghost he cried with a loud voice and
[56:51] yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil
[56:55] of the Temple was rent in Twain From the
[56:59] top to the bottom and the Earth did
[57:04] quake and the Rocks
[57:08] rent and the
[57:10] graves were
[57:13] opened I want you to look at this word
[57:17] Graves
[57:19] Seer grave or
[57:23] tomb any visible object
[57:26] for preserving or recalling the memory
[57:31] of any person or
[57:36] sing now most of them did not have
[57:39] graves in the way that we do
[57:43] today but they were buried in
[57:47] sepers which would be a hollowed out
[57:51] place
[57:53] in Solid Rock
[57:56] or it could be above the ground or in
[57:59] the ground but still they chose Rock I
[58:02] want you notice how this order of events
[58:06] happens so Jesus
[58:10] cries with a loud voice and what he does
[58:14] he gives up The
[58:16] Ghost and whenever he did that the earth
[58:21] started shaking now remember the
[58:24] darkness is still upon the Earth friends
[58:27] it must have been a terrifying
[58:30] time now remember 3 hours of Darkness
[58:35] had been upon the Earth the stars come
[58:39] out now remember this is not only in the
[58:42] gospels but it's also in the Roman
[58:45] records and in the historic record of
[58:49] tulian which is only one of the ones
[58:51] that I could have read to you tonight
[58:54] now God wanted it to be
[58:56] recorded in history Now watch how that
[59:00] Matthew says it and it's it's a little
[59:03] bit tricky you got to be careful in the
[59:05] way that you read it and the graves were
[59:09] open and many bodies of the Saints which
[59:13] slept
[59:15] arose and came out of the graves
[59:20] after his
[59:23] resurrection but I want you to notice
[59:26] what took place in in verse
[59:29] 53 when he shouted with a loud voice and
[59:35] then the sepers open now to you and I
[59:40] we're thinking well you know that' go
[59:42] out turn they'd have to dig them up no
[59:45] no that that wasn't the way they buried
[59:47] them so say they were buried in a stone
[59:53] separer and they would roll a rock
[59:57] round ones I've been there and seen them
[59:59] they still have them thousands of years
[1:00:02] old and whenever the Lord Jesus cried
[1:00:06] with a loud
[1:00:08] voice and the Darkness as at the last
[1:00:11] phase of the darkness and he cries with
[1:00:14] a loud voice yields up the ghost then
[1:00:17] what's the order of events then an
[1:00:20] earthquake takes place and when it does
[1:00:25] the gantic rocks that are blocking the
[1:00:30] doorways of the
[1:00:32] sepers they start rolling
[1:00:36] open but those
[1:00:39] Saints whose bodies were there did not
[1:00:44] get up right
[1:00:49] then now we know that Abraham Isaac
[1:00:53] Jacob many of the Old Testament Saints
[1:00:56] were part of that number but I want you
[1:00:59] to think with me tonight no doubt there
[1:01:02] had been some who had accepted the
[1:01:06] Messianic promise under the ministry of
[1:01:10] the Lord Jesus right
[1:01:13] then and there were probably people that
[1:01:17] had just been dead for a day or two or a
[1:01:21] week or a month or a year so how would
[1:01:27] these people have known
[1:01:31] historically that there was truly a
[1:01:34] resurrection and they saw their loved
[1:01:37] ones appear so they did not have a
[1:01:40] picture of Abraham or Isaac or Jacob or
[1:01:42] Joseph are none of the Patriarchs so
[1:01:46] they could have stood right by him you
[1:01:48] know in a market or whereever they would
[1:01:50] have never even known that it was
[1:01:53] Abraham how were they going to know that
[1:01:57] their loved ones had actually raised up
[1:02:00] because there was some elect that would
[1:02:03] have passed just
[1:02:06] recently so they had took their mama out
[1:02:09] there put her in the seple they took
[1:02:12] their daddy their brother their child or
[1:02:15] whatever more and whenever the
[1:02:18] resurrection took place they looked and
[1:02:22] there was
[1:02:23] mama now remember this all
[1:02:27] coincides their
[1:02:29] Resurrection answered to the need of the
[1:02:34] day listen their Resurrection answered
[1:02:39] for the need of the day now the Lord
[1:02:42] Jesus shout Was Heard by many many
[1:02:48] people the great cry from the cross Was
[1:02:52] Heard by many people these de head that
[1:02:56] got up was seen by many
[1:03:00] people but yet there's no historical
[1:03:04] record that anybody other than the elect
[1:03:08] ever saw the Lord Jesus after his
[1:03:12] resurrection that's right an't that
[1:03:14] amazing so in the
[1:03:17] resurrection he did not appear in the
[1:03:20] city and let other people see him but
[1:03:24] who did he allow to witness that
[1:03:29] resurrection and speak on his behalf his
[1:03:33] believing
[1:03:35] children now watch in Matthew
[1:03:38] 27:53 and they came out of the graves
[1:03:44] after his resurrection you see the order
[1:03:48] of God would have been broken had they
[1:03:53] got up before he got up
[1:03:57] so what God did was God through the
[1:03:59] shout now remember he had a loud voice
[1:04:03] what was it a
[1:04:06] shout so he let force a loud voice a
[1:04:11] shout amen and whenever he shouted then
[1:04:17] the the tomb started opening up but no
[1:04:21] bodies come
[1:04:23] out so the doors started opening but
[1:04:28] they could not come out amen
[1:04:32] until he come out
[1:04:35] first now watch and came out of the
[1:04:39] graves after his
[1:04:42] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:04:47] and appeared un to many now remember
[1:04:52] this
[1:04:53] Resurrection fit for the need of the day
[1:04:58] now hang on with me you know I'm laying
[1:05:00] a foundation for something that is not
[1:05:03] the need in our day
[1:05:07] ours is a total
[1:05:12] secret you see this is where people get
[1:05:15] it wrong they're looking at this one and
[1:05:19] they're thinking well the Rapture for
[1:05:21] the bride the resurrection all that for
[1:05:23] the bride it'll be exactly the way it
[1:05:25] was there
[1:05:26] no no it won't
[1:05:28] actually because our need for the day is
[1:05:34] not so it'll be written down by the
[1:05:36] Roman government or our government or
[1:05:39] any other government it's
[1:05:42] Romeo and
[1:05:44] Juliet it's a love story it's not going
[1:05:48] to be written down for people to read it
[1:05:51] for 2,000 years there ain't going to be
[1:05:53] nobody here that's going to need to read
[1:05:55] it amen now watch with me in John
[1:05:59] 12:4 what the Lord Jesus said about
[1:06:03] himself verily verily I say unto
[1:06:07] you except a
[1:06:11] corn of
[1:06:13] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[1:06:18] abideth alone now watch how he speaks of
[1:06:22] his own
[1:06:24] identity and he does not call
[1:06:28] himself the
[1:06:31] sheath he does not call
[1:06:34] himself the
[1:06:36] sheath he does not talk about himself in
[1:06:41] the multiplied form but the single
[1:06:46] form and he calls himself the corn not
[1:06:50] the
[1:06:51] corns but the corn of wheat praise the
[1:06:56] Lord I know you're quiet you're
[1:06:57] listening that's all right verily verily
[1:07:00] I say unto you except a singular corn
[1:07:05] singular of wheat fall into the ground
[1:07:09] and die it abideth singular
[1:07:13] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[1:07:19] much fruit now watch here is the process
[1:07:23] by which he's going to multiply by
[1:07:26] himself and that is through death so he
[1:07:29] went down in the single
[1:07:32] form but when he raises it will be in
[1:07:35] the multiplied form praise be to God
[1:07:39] Read With Me Now Leviticus
[1:07:43] 2310 speak unto the children of Israel
[1:07:46] and say unto them when ye be com into
[1:07:48] the land which I given to you listen
[1:07:51] closely and shall reap the Harvest
[1:07:54] thereof then ye shall bring a
[1:07:59] sheath which was a tenth of an
[1:08:03] OM but in a modern day terms it would be
[1:08:07] about the size of two liter so think 2
[1:08:12] lit Coke there you go so 2 lit now I
[1:08:17] want you to think of how many stalks
[1:08:21] that it would take now so here you're
[1:08:24] going to have a bun so say about this
[1:08:27] bigger
[1:08:28] ramp there's not going to be one grain
[1:08:32] that's going to be able to do that so
[1:08:34] what are they doing they're Gathering
[1:08:36] the mature ones and they're going to
[1:08:38] bring this and when they bring it to the
[1:08:40] priest it's going to be about this size
[1:08:43] right here 2 L bottle and they're going
[1:08:46] to bring that to the priest now then you
[1:08:50] shall bring a sheath so in this sheath
[1:08:54] is not one One Singular grain so he
[1:08:56] didn't say whenever you bring it bring a
[1:08:59] corn of wheat just pick up one little
[1:09:01] tiny grain and bring that one little
[1:09:04] tiny grain and give it to the priest but
[1:09:06] he will say whenever you bring it I want
[1:09:09] you to bring a whole
[1:09:11] handful and then I want the priest to
[1:09:15] wave that whole handful before the
[1:09:18] congregation because this is the deposit
[1:09:22] this is the deposit that the rest of the
[1:09:25] the field is coming into the maturity
[1:09:28] then ye shall bring a sheath of the
[1:09:31] first fruits of your Harvest unto the
[1:09:33] priest and he shall wave the sheath not
[1:09:37] the single grain but the sheath before
[1:09:40] the Lord to be accepted for you on the
[1:09:45] tomorrow after the Sabbath shall the
[1:09:49] priest wave it so on the marrow after
[1:09:54] the Sabbath so they're going to have
[1:09:57] seven sabbaths and then the tomorrow
[1:10:00] which will be the day after the Sabbath
[1:10:02] which is of course going to be on day 50
[1:10:06] 7 time 7 49 so they'll have seven
[1:10:11] sabbaths and the Jubilee feasts and all
[1:10:13] that coming down through there now it
[1:10:15] says after that you're going to have
[1:10:17] what is going to be called
[1:10:19] Pentecost and on the tomorrow after the
[1:10:22] Sabbath 7 * 749 so one more day added to
[1:10:25] that which is 50 now you know the word
[1:10:28] Pentecost means 50 right so when the day
[1:10:33] of Pentecost was fully come so on the
[1:10:37] tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest
[1:10:40] shall take this whole bundle and he's
[1:10:43] going to wave it before the Lord and He
[1:10:47] Shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to
[1:10:50] be accepted for you on the marrow after
[1:10:53] the Sabbath notice after to the Sabbath
[1:10:56] shall the priest wave it and you shall
[1:10:58] offer that day when you wave the sheath
[1:11:01] and he lamb without blemish of the first
[1:11:05] year for a burnt offering unto the Lord
[1:11:08] so a sheath what does it do it implies
[1:11:13] plurality not Singularity not one but
[1:11:18] the sheath signifies more than one so
[1:11:23] the sheath implies par ity so it was a
[1:11:27] corn of wheat that's going to go down
[1:11:29] they're going to take him off the cross
[1:11:31] they're going to put his body in the
[1:11:32] ground but the rolled stones are already
[1:11:36] signifying the voice of the Resurrection
[1:11:39] has
[1:11:40] spoken so when the corn of wheat goes
[1:11:44] into the earth now watch then when he
[1:11:49] raises up what actually happens when he
[1:11:54] gets up he goes down of course into
[1:11:58] paradise and by this spiritual
[1:12:01] translation his Spirit goes into the
[1:12:04] hands of God he goes down into
[1:12:09] paradise and down into hell he takes the
[1:12:12] keys away from the devil then he goes
[1:12:15] over in next door to Paradise where
[1:12:18] Abraham and Isaac and all the saints of
[1:12:21] God were and he empties out paradise and
[1:12:25] then he begins to CL say come on
[1:12:28] children let's go back up on the earth
[1:12:31] and the prophet said Abraham said Lord
[1:12:34] would you mind if we would stop up there
[1:12:36] for a little bit I'd like to just kind
[1:12:38] of walk around the city and see what it
[1:12:40] looks like you mind if we make what the
[1:12:43] prophet called a Whistle Stop he said
[1:12:46] yeah that's fine cuz I'm going to stop
[1:12:48] and spend a few days with my disciples
[1:12:52] so when the Lord Jesus appears on the
[1:12:55] earth and he also joined in that can you
[1:12:59] imagine all that Mary and Martha and you
[1:13:02] know Peter and John went up there and
[1:13:04] you remember the story on the
[1:13:06] resurrection morning but all they
[1:13:08] noticed and we have no record there the
[1:13:11] rest of them even saw it but yet here
[1:13:13] Matthew which I find totally amazing
[1:13:16] that Mark never mentioned this Luke
[1:13:18] never mentioned this John never
[1:13:20] mentioned this and yet according to your
[1:13:22] Bible you're not even supposed to
[1:13:24] believe in without two or three
[1:13:26] Witnesses and Matthew is the only
[1:13:31] witness show me where Mark said this
[1:13:34] show me where John said it well come on
[1:13:36] don't get Qui said there looking at me
[1:13:38] apparently the apostles must have deemed
[1:13:41] Matthew such a believable witness now
[1:13:45] was Matthew the only one that saw them
[1:13:47] was Matthew the only one that gathered
[1:13:49] all this information together I don't
[1:13:52] know and if I needed to know the answer
[1:13:55] would be there perform it the way I look
[1:13:57] at it Matthew's word is enough for me
[1:14:01] well if I'm going to believe that when
[1:14:04] Paul never Vindicated it nor Mark never
[1:14:06] Vindicated it nor John never Vindicated
[1:14:09] I have no problem that God could raise
[1:14:12] up a prophet in the last day and say
[1:14:16] things that denominations don't go along
[1:14:18] with and preachers don't go along with
[1:14:21] because if Matthew could write something
[1:14:24] that no nobody else ever said none of
[1:14:27] the other writers even mentioned it in
[1:14:29] their scripture and we hold on to it do
[1:14:32] we not and Matthew was not a prophet
[1:14:36] Matthew was not a great man like Paul
[1:14:39] was but Matthew was a scribe but I'm so
[1:14:42] glad Matthew wrote it
[1:14:45] down I'll tell you one thing when God
[1:14:48] gets ready to do something the devil is
[1:14:50] not going to stop him and the church
[1:14:53] said amen and the Lord Jesus when he
[1:14:57] raises from the dead then out of those
[1:15:00] Graves come the dead Saints and they
[1:15:04] enter into their glorified bodies now
[1:15:07] unlike what the rest of the dead now
[1:15:10] remember Jesus raised several Dead when
[1:15:12] he were here but he raised them and gave
[1:15:16] them a temporary Resurrection every one
[1:15:19] of them people that he raised from the
[1:15:21] dead they all died twice they die again
[1:15:25] twice so they had to go right back to
[1:15:27] the grave but these are being raised
[1:15:30] from the dead to never have to die again
[1:15:34] and what did they do they entered in
[1:15:37] with him don't you understand it's part
[1:15:39] of the mystery of you and I in the last
[1:15:43] day that we enter in with him our head
[1:15:47] done raised from the dead but not only
[1:15:50] our head but human beings like us that
[1:15:53] believe the word of God we already have
[1:15:56] an account according to Matthew that
[1:15:59] they raised and entered in with him what
[1:16:02] was it God not only raised the head but
[1:16:05] God raised the Old Testament elect body
[1:16:09] and they entered in with him at the
[1:16:11] sheath waving testifying and prophesying
[1:16:15] Donnie your day is coming Fred your day
[1:16:18] is coming Paul your day is coming
[1:16:20] because God wrote it in their lives and
[1:16:23] God wanted it written down God wanted
[1:16:29] eyewitnesses but our
[1:16:35] Resurrection he slips down as a
[1:16:38] thief in the
[1:16:41] night and as
[1:16:43] Romeo leaned his ladder up against
[1:16:46] Juliet's
[1:16:48] window and climbed up the
[1:16:53] ladder Julia
[1:16:56] juliad wake
[1:16:58] up
[1:17:00] Julia it's
[1:17:02] Romeo are you ready to go
[1:17:05] sweetheart wait a minute let me tell my
[1:17:07] mama shh no no no no it's a seven
[1:17:11] seal sh it's silence to them they don't
[1:17:16] understand it they look right at it but
[1:17:20] they just can't see it
[1:17:23] sh so what do you want me to do you want
[1:17:25] me to go down and and and ask my daddy's
[1:17:27] permission what do you want me to do you
[1:17:28] want me to wake the whole house no
[1:17:30] sweetheart just come out the window with
[1:17:35] me just come out the window with me now
[1:17:39] want you to notice the Lord Jesus when
[1:17:42] he raises from the dead and he allows
[1:17:46] his children of the Old Testament to
[1:17:50] take on a visible
[1:17:53] form and there's sister so and so she
[1:17:56] died just a week ago that was a young
[1:17:59] boy that died just a month ago that was
[1:18:01] another person that Sav died uh you know
[1:18:04] a year and a half ago and that they had
[1:18:06] heard Jesus preach and they believed
[1:18:07] with all their heart they was included
[1:18:09] in the resurrection so year they raised
[1:18:11] up from the dead and they were seen by
[1:18:14] many can you imagine having that
[1:18:16] testimony and you're the mom and dad and
[1:18:18] you say you know what me and me and
[1:18:19] husband was sitting there eating
[1:18:20] breakfast and in walked our boy in
[1:18:23] walked our boy raised from the dead what
[1:18:24] are you talking about woman I'm telling
[1:18:26] you it was the truth it was here we
[1:18:28] actually had him to sit down there and
[1:18:30] he actually took some of that we had
[1:18:32] some honeycomb and we had some cheese
[1:18:34] and we had some bread don't you know he
[1:18:37] picked that up and ate it well where's
[1:18:39] he at where's he at I don't know he was
[1:18:42] here for a few days and we just seen him
[1:18:44] walk in the wall he walked straight
[1:18:46] through the wall and we was just our
[1:18:48] fellowship and all of a sudden he just
[1:18:52] disappeared you imagine what the people
[1:18:55] thought about them poor old things
[1:18:58] they've lost their mind the loss of that
[1:19:01] son has drove them insane they did poor
[1:19:04] things you know we need to but then they
[1:19:06] heard somebody else in the city saw
[1:19:09] their old grandma but grandma wasn't old
[1:19:11] no longer and somebody else saw their
[1:19:13] daddy and somebody else saw their uncle
[1:19:15] and then all of a sudden they appeared
[1:19:17] and then you know that they they they
[1:19:19] disappear and how in the world is it
[1:19:21] that Matthew of an event like this
[1:19:25] Matthew was the only one that wrote
[1:19:27] about
[1:19:29] it now don't tell me you Scholars here
[1:19:32] tonight are going to believe it just
[1:19:34] because one person said
[1:19:40] it you sorry
[1:19:43] Hypocrites i't talking about you all
[1:19:45] now bless God I won't take what the
[1:19:48] prophet said without two or three
[1:19:49] Witnesses well if you don't do Matthew
[1:19:51] the same way you're a liar and you're a
[1:19:54] hypocrite
[1:19:56] wo well
[1:20:00] Glory do we believe it on what basis an
[1:20:06] anointed man of God that was that where
[1:20:09] did he get his information from Brother
[1:20:11] Phillip I don't know I looked I couldn't
[1:20:14] find one spec of History I couldn't find
[1:20:17] what Pontius pilot said it I couldn't
[1:20:19] find where this one said it or that one
[1:20:21] said it all I know is Matthew said they
[1:20:25] got up and they appeared unto many I
[1:20:28] don't mind telling you they didn't
[1:20:30] appear to everybody but they appeared
[1:20:34] unto many in our resurrection and
[1:20:37] Rapture that we are looking for when our
[1:20:40] loved ones raised up they will not
[1:20:43] appear to everybody but I believe I'm
[1:20:46] one of them that they will appear too
[1:20:50] Hallelujah why they are coming to bring
[1:20:54] a message message to us and what are we
[1:20:56] going to do we're going to enter in with
[1:20:59] them because we are making up the last
[1:21:02] day sheath our head will descend from
[1:21:05] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:21:08] the Archangel and the Trump of God shall
[1:21:11] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:21:13] first and we which are alive and remain
[1:21:17] shall be changed and we're going to be
[1:21:19] CAU up to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:21:22] so shall we ever be
[1:21:25] with the
[1:21:27] [Applause]
[1:21:37] Lord so you imagine they're all just
[1:21:40] sitting there and they're really
[1:21:42] perplexed and they're trying to
[1:21:43] understand what in the world is going on
[1:21:46] where we're living in Peculiar
[1:21:48] times and Thomas Miss service what says
[1:21:52] on Wednesday night
[1:21:54] Thomas wasn't to church on Wednesday
[1:21:56] night and wouldn't you know it Jesus
[1:21:58] showed up that's what he does you know
[1:22:01] if you have church on Sunday morning
[1:22:02] Sunday evening you know what every time
[1:22:04] it is Jesus is always going to be there
[1:22:05] cuz he said he would so Thomas wasn't at
[1:22:08] church he wasn't at the assembly but yet
[1:22:11] the Lord Jesus loved him so much and you
[1:22:13] know they said now Thomas we've seen him
[1:22:15] I'm telling you what we've seen him said
[1:22:16] I will not believe I'm telling you one
[1:22:19] thing until I can touch them holes in
[1:22:21] his hand and in his side I will not
[1:22:24] believe and the Lord Jesus just appears
[1:22:26] all hell Thomas come and handle me feel
[1:22:32] me oh what did Thomas say oh my my my
[1:22:36] second god of the trinitarian godhead my
[1:22:40] second person what did Thomas say my
[1:22:43] Lord and my God hallelujah my Lord and
[1:22:49] my God blessed are th Thomas because you
[1:22:53] have seen and ly but more blessed are
[1:22:57] those who have never seen and yet they
[1:22:59] believe you are blessed tonight Word of
[1:23:03] Life we never saw his hand we never saw
[1:23:07] his body yet we believe with all of our
[1:23:10] souls do we
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:21] not I wonder how it must feel
[1:23:25] the kind as we sat in our modern
[1:23:28] terminology to hang out with
[1:23:30] somebody and a glorified
[1:23:45] body you sit there and eat they eat with
[1:23:48] you but you sat down you're getting
[1:23:50] sleep in and you fellowshipped you know
[1:23:51] for hours and you're just you're nodding
[1:23:53] off and they're just sitting our all bug
[1:23:54] ey looking at you said ain't you sleepy
[1:23:57] I don't need to
[1:23:59] sleep they ain't drunk no Red Bull
[1:24:02] neither they got a hold of a red blood
[1:24:04] out of the Lamb of God hallelujah
[1:24:08] hallelujah oh can you imagine hanging
[1:24:10] out with glorified bodies and somehow
[1:24:13] they get the message from The
[1:24:19] resurrector
[1:24:21] Today is going up day
[1:24:26] wonder where they
[1:24:28] were when Jesus went up while the rest
[1:24:31] of the Apostles didn't see
[1:24:34] them where were they you see God can
[1:24:38] make people visible when he wants and
[1:24:42] makes him
[1:24:44] disappear when he
[1:24:47] wants you call me crazy if you want to
[1:24:49] it won't be the first time I've been
[1:24:51] called that I believe the Lord in the
[1:24:53] resurrection
[1:24:56] could let your loved ones appear to you
[1:24:58] in
[1:25:00] Walmart you're walking down through
[1:25:02] there you go through your grocery list I
[1:25:03] told her the other day I said tell you
[1:25:05] one thing inflation keeps rising up she
[1:25:07] had a grocery list laying on the counter
[1:25:09] at home and you know pretty good size

[1:25:12] price of groceries and everything keeps

[1:25:15] our grocery list on one of them posted
[1:25:17] things you know about that bigger Square
[1:25:19] about all you can afford to buy but you
[1:25:21] imagine going down through there and

[1:25:26] looking for this and that and the other

[1:25:43] them and say Lord have mercy it's on the
[1:25:46] move is on it's around or somewhere
[1:25:49] everybody else stand there looking at
[1:25:50] you saying what in the world's wrong
[1:25:52] with them and you saying King you see
[1:25:54] them can't you hear them oh yeah I want
[1:25:57] to be so in touch with that Heavenly
[1:25:59] realm when they appear my eyes will pick
[1:26:03] them up my ears will pick them up
[1:26:06] because I am part of that last day
[1:26:09] sheath Hallelujah you cannot leave here
[1:26:13] without
[1:26:14] [Applause]
[1:26:22] me so watch Paul now to Ephesians 4:8 he
[1:26:26] quotes this from
[1:26:29] Psalms wherefore he
[1:26:31] sayth when he ascended up on
[1:26:36] high he led
[1:26:39] captivity
[1:26:42] captive praise
[1:26:44] God he led
[1:26:47] captivity
[1:26:49] captive so he went and captured Abraham
[1:26:52] Isaac Jacob Joseph all those you know
[1:26:55] that were elected for that
[1:26:57] resurrection and he captured them I'm so
[1:27:01] glad he's captured me already has he
[1:27:03] captured your heart you see that's where
[1:27:05] a lot of folks are missing it they just
[1:27:07] say well I'm a Christian I'm a Christian
[1:27:08] I don't understand how y'all feel you're
[1:27:10] just a bunch of Fanatics no it's not
[1:27:12] just that we're Fanatics he captured us
[1:27:15] he captured our heart he captured our
[1:27:17] desires he captured our our motives our
[1:27:20] objective we think about him we pray
[1:27:22] about him we pray about what we live we
[1:27:24] pray about where we go to church we pray
[1:27:26] about all kinds of things in life is
[1:27:28] that right why because we are prisoners
[1:27:31] of love people feel sorry for us oh them
[1:27:33] people can't do this and they can't do
[1:27:35] that it's not that we can't do it it's
[1:27:38] that we don't want to do it it's because
[1:27:41] our hearts we're not held by chains
[1:27:44] we're not held by holding you over a
[1:27:46] spell come on somebody we have been
[1:27:49] captured by the love of God I could
[1:27:52] drink if I wanted to I could smoke if I
[1:27:55] wanted to but why in the world what I
[1:27:57] want to do that the Lord Jesus captured
[1:28:01] my heart and my
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:05] soul
[1:28:07] Hallelujah so he led you're talking
[1:28:09] about
[1:28:10] amazing the way Paul places this and
[1:28:14] quoting David wherefore he says when he
[1:28:16] ascended up on high he led captivity
[1:28:19] captive and gave gifts unto men
[1:28:24] now that he ascended which is but that
[1:28:28] he
[1:28:29] also descended
[1:28:31] first into the lower parts of the earth
[1:28:35] he that descended is the same also that
[1:28:40] ascended up far above all the heavens
[1:28:44] that he might fill all things now listen
[1:28:47] at the
[1:28:49] gifts and he gave some apostles
[1:28:55] some
[1:28:56] prophets some
[1:28:59] evangelists some
[1:29:01] pastors and teachers won't you notice
[1:29:05] who gave them and the original Greek and
[1:29:08] the language of that it was written in
[1:29:11] the he is very
[1:29:14] emphatic as a matter of fact it says he
[1:29:17] and he alone as the ascended head of
[1:29:23] humanity
[1:29:25] he
[1:29:26] gave Oh Glory instead of set or
[1:29:31] appointed he gave who what Ministry
[1:29:37] gifts you see it's not just that God
[1:29:42] called a preacher and God put just a
[1:29:45] gift in the preacher notice the writing
[1:29:48] of the word but actually the gifts are
[1:29:53] the men
[1:29:55] Glory they themselves are the
[1:30:00] gift from God to the
[1:30:03] church you see the people who despise
[1:30:07] the prophet and his message and they
[1:30:10] make it as if though it's an option well
[1:30:12] you all are going to heaven but they
[1:30:13] think some of us may I guess you know
[1:30:15] it's amazing how these people that leave
[1:30:16] the message they Embrace every
[1:30:17] denomination that there is and exclude
[1:30:20] us and they're supposed to be so
[1:30:22] inclusive sound like a bunch of
[1:30:23] Democrats to me I
[1:30:26] mean they're supposed to have so much
[1:30:29] love and so much accepting of everybody
[1:30:31] and they'll call this man brother and
[1:30:33] that man brother and that man brother
[1:30:35] except for the message preachers and
[1:30:37] they don't even call them brother they
[1:30:39] say they're a bunch of devils and going
[1:30:41] to hell and they have so much love for
[1:30:43] everybody except us they include the
[1:30:46] gays they include everything in the
[1:30:48] world except for us and they put us out
[1:30:50] well in one way that's a good sign
[1:30:52] because that means the shock is pulling
[1:30:55] away from the seed and I know we don't
[1:30:58] want to hear it but we've had shock
[1:31:00] around our message from any year but the
[1:31:03] Lord is letting the shock pull away so
[1:31:06] the bride can lay in the presence of the
[1:31:09] son and get ripe oh come on children
[1:31:12] let's have church tonight God wants to
[1:31:14] bring us into his presence so we can
[1:31:18] ripen and get ready to leave this world
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:30] you know this this is so sad in one way
[1:31:36] that the people that refuse the
[1:31:40] gifts that the Lord Jesus gave to them
[1:31:44] yes sir I said I don't need no Pastor I
[1:31:47] don't need no Evangel I don't need no
[1:31:48] teacher bless God I got all I need I got
[1:31:51] the tapes we see it's not that you're
[1:31:53] reject rejecting me it's not that you're
[1:31:55] rejecting brother Daryl the Lord Jesus
[1:31:59] placed these gifts in the body so you're
[1:32:01] saying to Jesus I don't want
[1:32:06] it keep your old fivefold Ministry Jesus
[1:32:10] I got tapes you don't even believe them
[1:32:14] tapes well come on don't get quiet on me
[1:32:16] now I thought you folks believe in going
[1:32:18] to church at least some of
[1:32:21] you you see it's not while they heard
[1:32:24] down his Fe it ain't hurting my feelings
[1:32:26] the Lord Jesus gave the body these what
[1:32:30] gifts but those gifts might minister to
[1:32:33] them sure friends he could have give us
[1:32:35] anything that he wanted to he don't you
[1:32:38] think he would give us the very best
[1:32:40] that he had to get us from here to there
[1:32:43] what if all preachers is bad and all
[1:32:45] preachers is wrong and all preachers are
[1:32:48] false why in the world would the Lord
[1:32:50] Jesus give such a thing to his body I
[1:32:54] guarantee you there some bad ones
[1:32:55] there's some ugly ones there's some on
[1:32:58] that left the word but that don't change
[1:33:00] God's word if God said he would give it
[1:33:04] God will give it and it's up to God to
[1:33:07] bring it to
[1:33:12] pass oh
[1:33:15] Hallelujah notice verse 12 so this is
[1:33:19] why I gave these
[1:33:21] gifts for the perfecting of the
[1:33:24] Saints for the work of the ministry
[1:33:27] singular only
[1:33:29] one now I'm the only
[1:33:32] preacher in Donnie Reagan's
[1:33:36] Ministry but I'm not the only minister
[1:33:39] in the ministry of this
[1:33:42] church I'm not the only minister in the
[1:33:45] ministry of the Bride I'm the only
[1:33:47] preacher in Donnie Reagan's Ministry but
[1:33:50] God's given us other ministers and our
[1:33:53] assist family and God's given us other
[1:33:56] old you say Oh Glory to God I go to
[1:33:58] church and I believe in going to church
[1:33:59] yeah but a lot of you just want to hear
[1:34:01] your pastor preach all the time and then
[1:34:04] you stick out your finger at them other
[1:34:06] people oh they won't hear a pastor they
[1:34:08] won't hear well some of you don't want
[1:34:09] hear an evangelist the same word that
[1:34:12] said pastor also said an Evangel well
[1:34:14] I'll tell you one thing them evangelists
[1:34:16] preach so simple and they preach this
[1:34:18] I'll tell you one thing when the prophet
[1:34:20] of God was going to preach them seal and
[1:34:22] he preached that sermon about God hiding
[1:34:25] himself he didn't say God hid himself in
[1:34:28] depth and revealed himself in mystery
[1:34:30] but God hid himself in Simplicity and
[1:34:34] revealed himself in the same when we get
[1:34:37] so big for our britches that we think we
[1:34:40] can't hear a simple sermon we need to
[1:34:42] hit the altar well come on somebody I
[1:34:46] don't care how much we think we know we
[1:34:49] want our hearts to be open to the very
[1:34:52] simplest thing that God would
[1:34:58] say Oh Glory for the perfecting of the
[1:35:02] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:35:05] the edifying of the body of
[1:35:09] Christ
[1:35:11] till notice not till the tapes start to
[1:35:15] become
[1:35:16] duplicated but the books are printed
[1:35:19] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:35:21] face and the knowledge of the son of
[1:35:24] God unto a perfect man notice it's not
[1:35:30] plural you see we're not trying to
[1:35:32] become reganit pites Spencer ites
[1:35:36] whatever ites you want to be called by
[1:35:40] there's only one perfect man that's
[1:35:43] Christ Jesus so if you settle to be a
[1:35:45] reaganite you're settling way short of
[1:35:48] Ephesians
[1:35:50] 4:13 unto a perfect man
[1:35:54] unto the measure of the stature so God
[1:35:58] pulled out his measureing
[1:36:01] tape and God measured Christ
[1:36:04] Jesus and he said this is the perfect
[1:36:07] man yes s he wasn't measuring his biceps
[1:36:11] he wasn't measuring the size of his legs
[1:36:13] he wasn't measuring how much Jesus could
[1:36:14] bench press he wasn't measuring you know
[1:36:16] how much pressure he had on his jaws and
[1:36:18] how much he could do all that but he
[1:36:20] measured him by character by full
[1:36:23] fillment of the word you see a man is
[1:36:26] not measured by how wealth he is a man
[1:36:29] is not measured by what he's accomplish
[1:36:31] I'll tell you one thing I started out a
[1:36:33] poor fell and I picked myself up by my
[1:36:35] own bootstraps and now I'm a millionaire
[1:36:37] and I turned into this and that and the
[1:36:39] other every bit of that is as lost as
[1:36:41] lost can be if you don't know
[1:36:44] Jesus the prophet said A man was
[1:36:47] measured by the
[1:36:49] bag in his knees
[1:36:54] how much time he spent before
[1:36:57] God In
[1:37:01] Prayer why is it we don't like those
[1:37:04] quotes we like to impress people by what
[1:37:07] we
[1:37:08] know oh we quote this and quote that and
[1:37:10] quote something else as if we're trying
[1:37:12] to win some type of something another
[1:37:13] you want a ribbon you want a star or
[1:37:19] what I don't know about you when God
[1:37:21] puts the measuring tape on me
[1:37:24] I want it to match the Lord
[1:37:28] Jesus that's the measure of the
[1:37:32] stature now in Corinthians whenever Paul
[1:37:36] wrote about the gifts of the Spirit in
[1:37:39] Corinthians the gifts are
[1:37:42] spiritual
[1:37:44] enablement that gifts the people not
[1:37:48] just Ministry but the people to be able
[1:37:51] to do certain things
[1:37:54] but the gifts in Ephesians are not a
[1:37:59] gift of the
[1:38:01] spirit but it's actually
[1:38:07] men so the Lord God gave to the first
[1:38:10] age Paul Peter James John on and on and
[1:38:17] on we could go that gift embedded in
[1:38:21] them now watch again in Matthew 27:53
[1:38:25] and came out of the graves after his
[1:38:28] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:38:31] and appeared unto many that there might
[1:38:34] be
[1:38:37] undeniable
[1:38:38] undeniable
[1:38:40] witnesses that
[1:38:42] corruption had bowed at the feet of the
[1:38:49] Resurrection can you imagine
[1:38:52] Abraham had gone beyond
[1:38:55] dust yeah Abraham had gone beyond dust
[1:39:00] you couldn't have found a bone of that
[1:39:02] man you couldn't have found a tooth you
[1:39:05] couldn't have found a hair you couldn't
[1:39:06] have found
[1:39:08] nothing he had gone beyond
[1:39:11] that and yet Abraham and Sarah stood
[1:39:13] there on the earth as a young man and a
[1:39:15] young
[1:39:16] woman glory to
[1:39:19] God
[1:39:21] hallelujah but the Lord Jesus
[1:39:26] himself did not witness of this
[1:39:29] Resurrection to the other people now you
[1:39:33] realize it won't be Jesus that'll come
[1:39:36] into your
[1:39:37] house the morning of the Rapture his
[1:39:40] feet will never touch the Earth again
[1:39:44] unto Revelation
[1:39:46] 19 how are we going to know the
[1:39:50] resurrection is on the f diminish part
[1:39:55] of the wave
[1:39:57] sheath the
[1:40:00] bride the
[1:40:02] bride the bride will appear in our
[1:40:06] homes and when we see her we know she's
[1:40:11] up because the head sent
[1:40:14] her glory be to God
[1:40:17] hallelujah now remember they will not be
[1:40:21] seen
[1:40:23] by everybody
[1:40:26] else they will not appear to everyone
[1:40:30] else it will not appear in the
[1:40:34] Washington newspaper in the New York
[1:40:37] Times there will not be YouTube videos
[1:40:40] and Instagram and Tik Tok and you know
[1:40:43] people go by the cemetery and oh my went
[1:40:45] by this cemetery and there was holes in
[1:40:47] the ground everywhere what the
[1:40:49] resurrection is
[1:40:51] on no
[1:40:54] wrong
[1:40:59] time y'all are just as puzzle this time
[1:41:02] as you was last time when I said
[1:41:05] this
[1:41:07] amen you see to prove his power over
[1:41:11] death knowing that this is the
[1:41:13] foundation or the beginning of the
[1:41:15] Gospel he wanted
[1:41:20] eyewitnesses but to prove he's at the
[1:41:22] end of the Myster history in the last
[1:41:26] days he says don't tell
[1:41:32] nobody their Resurrection matchs the
[1:41:36] need of the
[1:41:38] day to prove his power over deaths our
[1:41:44] Resurrection will match the need of the
[1:41:48] day to prove the
[1:41:51] Rapture is a secret
[1:41:56] listen to this and sudden secret going
[1:41:58] away we're looking for that
[1:42:01] secret
[1:42:03] sudden
[1:42:05] appearing of the
[1:42:08] Lord the Lord knows how people
[1:42:11] are and if he G gave every prophecy in
[1:42:15] such a meticulous way and people could
[1:42:18] read it like a newspaper some people
[1:42:19] would wait until the day before the
[1:42:22] Rapture and then they get ready Oh Glory
[1:42:24] to God hallelujah here I
[1:42:26] come so even sometimes prophecy is left
[1:42:29] you ever wonder why whenever brother
[1:42:31] brandham saw the woman and he wasn't
[1:42:33] sure if it was a woman ruling America or
[1:42:36] if it was the
[1:42:38] church wonder why some of the prophecies
[1:42:40] are left vague
[1:42:43] ersy ersy people look for something oh
[1:42:47] my where they can be able to pinpoint
[1:42:49] pinpoint but you know what pray you
[1:42:51] therefore always that you may be
[1:42:53] accounted worthy to escape all these
[1:42:55] things that shall come to pass and stand
[1:42:57] before the son of man if the Lord don't
[1:42:59] come for another hundred years I ain't
[1:43:01] got a promise that I'll live to walk
[1:43:03] through that door when I get done
[1:43:05] preaching I want to live every day as if
[1:43:07] though it is my last day I'm not waiting
[1:43:10] for this prophecy to come to pass I'm
[1:43:13] not waiting for a woman president I
[1:43:15] ain't waiting for nothing myself I want
[1:43:17] to live Hallelujah I want to torment the
[1:43:20] devil I want to do everything I can for
[1:43:23] the kingdom of God I'll never have this
[1:43:26] day right here I'll never have this day
[1:43:29] again you will never have this day again
[1:43:32] don't live it with regrets but do
[1:43:35] everything you can this day for the Lord
[1:43:41] Jesus Oh My for there's something in the
[1:43:45] air a
[1:43:47] message of the holy spirit that tells us
[1:43:51] the coming is at end
[1:43:53] the sermon call look there that
[1:43:57] bride is looking to the coming of the
[1:44:01] Lord
[1:44:02] Jesus which that
[1:44:05] secret
[1:44:07] secret coming of Christ shall
[1:44:10] come and catch away his bride in the
[1:44:14] night like a book I read of
[1:44:19] Romeo and Julet at one time how it come
[1:44:23] with a
[1:44:24] latter and got his bride out among them
[1:44:28] that's what Jesus will come someday
[1:44:30] looking for that one oh my that is not
[1:44:33] looking to his Creeds but looking to
[1:44:36] Christ waiting for him to come with his
[1:44:40] heart
[1:44:42] centered they come blood relation like
[1:44:45] Isaac and Rebecca on blood relation
[1:44:48] that's what we have to come blood
[1:44:52] relation to
[1:44:53] Christ through the
[1:44:57] sacrifice let me close with this
[1:45:00] one and
[1:45:02] remember the coming of the
[1:45:06] Lord will be a
[1:45:09] sudden
[1:45:11] secret going
[1:45:14] away so a
[1:45:16] coming is actually a
[1:45:20] going they'll never know it when it
[1:45:23] happens our
[1:45:25] Resurrection must match the

[1:51:17] dream it was like the Rapture took
[1:51:20] place and there was thousand thousands
[1:51:23] times thousands of people and we was all
[1:51:26] gathered around the Lord Jesus and he
[1:51:28] was kind of in the middle of us all and
[1:51:31] we started praising him and praising him
[1:51:36] and the more we praised him the higher
[1:51:38] he
[1:51:40] got so it's like our Praises was just
[1:51:43] lifting him Higher and Higher and the
[1:51:45] higher he got the more we praised him
[1:51:48] until he just got up above us and there
[1:51:51] he was and we was all this worshiping
[1:51:54] and praising and he was looking down on
[1:51:56] us all oh
[1:51:59] Hallelujah I believe it'll be something
[1:52:01] like that one of these days we'll be
[1:52:04] come up missing on this Earth gathered

[2:00:13] hand maybe over on the shoulder of the
[2:00:14] person standing by you if you don't feel
[2:00:16] comfortable by the person standing near
[2:00:18] you if you want to move out of your
[2:00:20] seat maybe a brother to a brother
[2:00:22] instead of a brother to a
[2:00:24] sister can we just offer a word of
[2:00:28] prayer think of it friends is there
[2:00:32] anybody that you wouldn't want to see
[2:00:34] going the Rapture if there is there
[2:00:37] something wrong with your heart
[2:00:39] tonight well I'll tell you one thing if
[2:00:41] I know so and so was gone I wouldn't
[2:00:43] even want to go you need to come to this
[2:00:45] altar you need to ask God to take that
[2:00:48] out of your
[2:00:49] heart is there anybody in this building
[2:00:52] tonight that is sinless is there anybody
[2:00:53] in this building tonight that is not
[2:00:56] needed forgiveness and mercy from the
[2:00:58] love of God who are we to say that God
[2:01:01] cannot give Mercy to this person that
[2:01:03] person or another
[2:01:05] person God forbid that I would be the
[2:01:09] individual that would try to stand
[2:01:11] between somebody and
[2:01:14] mercy somebody and the
[2:01:17] cross somebody and someone wanting to go
[2:01:20] to church
[2:01:22] and I would stand between them and say
[2:01:25] no you don't deserve
[2:01:30] mercy God have mercy on
[2:01:33] us oh
[2:01:35] Jesus help
[2:01:38] us help us
[2:01:41] Lord Lord we're living in a
[2:01:44] time when our nation has fallen so
[2:01:48] far Lord that a a man would try Tri to
[2:01:53] assassinate our former president which
[2:01:56] is really
[2:01:59] sad but the sadness don't stop there
[2:02:02] because we have many so-called
[2:02:05] Americans talking about how sad they are
[2:02:09] that the attempted
[2:02:10] assassination did not go
[2:02:13] through I've seen one after another
[2:02:16] after another after another today on
[2:02:19] YouTube rock stars famous people people
[2:02:23] saying they wish he would have killed
[2:02:25] him and I saw pre-tribulation
[2:02:29] anointing is moving on the people that
[2:02:32] selectively they don't care if these
[2:02:34] people are killed or those people are
[2:02:36] killed and they don't
[2:02:38] realize it's the pre-tribulation
[2:02:40] anointing that's moving on
[2:02:42] them so just because a person would
[2:02:45] differ with them and their politics it
[2:02:48] would be okay to kill them
[2:02:53] Lord It's the tribulation anointing
[2:02:55] that's already
[2:02:56] here that it won't be hard for the
[2:02:59] people to want to chase down the foolish
[2:03:01] virgin or the 144,000 because they're
[2:03:06] Jews that anointing is already
[2:03:10] here Lord as I saw some of those things
[2:03:13] today I just felt there was such a sad
[2:03:16] heart thinking that these are
[2:03:20] Americans the these are people that say
[2:03:22] they love our nation our country and yet
[2:03:27] sad because another
[2:03:29] mortal lived and the bullet grazed his
[2:03:33] ear and didn't go into his head and kill
[2:03:36] him I I I wouldn't want that to my worst
[2:03:39] enemy I don't know of a mortal that I
[2:03:43] would want such a thing to happen to
[2:03:46] that's what makes me so happy tonight
[2:03:48] Lord that no doubt without you and my
[2:03:52] heart I would feel like a lot of the
[2:03:54] rest of these leot of sins do murder
[2:03:59] resides in their soul a lot of these
[2:04:02] people that have left the
[2:04:04] message they would be so tickled if I
[2:04:06] got killed and a car wreck going home
[2:04:09] tonight they would be so tickled if
[2:04:12] brother Tim PR died or some other these
[2:04:15] message preachers would die they would
[2:04:17] send one another great salutations they
[2:04:20] would be so happy
[2:04:23] and they say they're
[2:04:25] free free from what free from a
[2:04:28] conscience I'm
[2:04:30] afraid Lord Jesus help us
[2:04:34] Lord the Judgment of God is on the
[2:04:38] earth people can hate and justify their
[2:04:43] hatred they could rejoice in death and
[2:04:46] murder Lord God thank you tonight thank
[2:04:50] you thank you
[2:04:52] that you have saved us we would be just
[2:04:56] like that if you didn't live in our
[2:04:59] hearts thank you tonight Lord
[2:05:02] Jesus oh Father Purge us oh we believe
[2:05:07] that we are answering in this last day
[2:05:11] of that wave sheath spiritually it's
[2:05:13] already happened the token life is being
[2:05:15] waved from Nation to Nation to Nation to

[2:30:14] hallelujah our brother had been dealing
[2:30:17] with some issues in his back and in his
[2:30:19] body and they've done some different
[2:30:21] scans and things and found some spurs on
[2:30:24] the vertebrae and just telling all kinds
[2:30:27] of bad news but we believe there's
[2:30:30] another report don't we the Lord has a
[2:30:33] report that by his stripes we are
[2:30:36] healed so our brother shared it with his
[2:30:39] family with people that he works with
[2:30:42] but he wanted to share it he said with
[2:30:44] his church
[2:30:46] family ain't that wonderful that's what
[2:30:49] we are we're we're not just a church but
[2:30:52] we're a family let's just agree together
[2:30:55] now remember our lord Jesus suffered
[2:30:58] that cat of nine
[2:31:00] tals on his back so they tie pieces of
[2:31:03] metal glass and they pick out one of the
[2:31:07] most
[2:31:07] browny strong Roman soldiers in the
[2:31:11] legion and he stands there and whips
[2:31:14] Jesus and when he does he tears shreds
[2:31:17] of Flesh from his back back as it goes
[2:31:21] all the way down his body why for
[2:31:25] decoration for our brother's healing for
[2:31:29] yours Lord Jesus we bring our brother
[2:31:32] before you
[2:31:34] tonight and we bring our token with our
[2:31:38] prayers father you see what the doctors
[2:31:41] have told our brother and yet more him
[2:31:43] our eyes and things to be done and
[2:31:45] they're going to try to look and see
[2:31:46] what they can do and we thank you for
[2:31:48] everything they can do
[2:31:50] but we know many times they just have to
[2:31:52] say we really don't know what to do and
[2:31:56] the prophet told us we go to a doctor
[2:31:58] and we do what the doctor tells us he
