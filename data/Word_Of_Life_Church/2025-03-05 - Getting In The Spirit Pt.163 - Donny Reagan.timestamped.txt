[39:05] invitations in the month of January for
[39:07] the year of 2025 and up into 26 and I've
[39:10] had in years and years and I don't want
[39:12] to go nowhere I want to just stay here
[39:14] at home but our lives are not our own
[39:17] are they sometimes we have to go and do
[39:20] things that that the we may not
[39:23] necessarily want to do herself but had
[39:25] some good meetings out in Arkansas
[39:27] brother Josh Bennett brother Willam awon
[39:29] just did an outstanding job that other
[39:31] guy you know I don't care for him very
[39:33] much so can't just judge too much about
[39:34] him but the Lord already moved among his
[39:37] people it was just awesome to hear the
[39:39] things that that God did that's a kind
[39:42] of God we're serving a it let's read
[39:45] together tonight Genesis chapter 1 we'll
[39:48] begin reading verse
[39:51] 11 and God said let the Earth bring
[39:54] forth grass the Earth herb yielding seed
[39:58] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[40:02] his kind whose seed is in itself upon
[40:07] the
[40:08] Earth and it was so and the Earth
[40:12] brought forth grass in herb yielding
[40:16] seed after his kind so we got the fruit
[40:20] trees then we've got the herbs the grass
[40:24] whose
[40:25] seed was in its
[40:28] self was in
[40:30] itself after his kind and God saw that
[40:35] it was good and now we know that what
[40:38] should have happened was then that God
[40:40] would have been able to continue on
[40:43] after he made the man in Genesis 2 and
[40:46] then God would have said and the man
[40:48] brought forth after his kind and it was
[40:52] good but something
[40:55] happened in verse 13 in the evening and
[40:59] the morning were the third day how may
[41:03] like to be remembered tonight as we
[41:05] pray I've gotten so many prayer requests
[41:07] from different people from different
[41:09] places around the world that's going
[41:11] through so many things so too many for
[41:13] them for me to be able to mention to you
[41:15] tonight but let's just remember the body
[41:17] of Christ around the world I hope you
[41:19] pray for the body of Christ when you do
[41:21] pray because there's so many needs Lord
[41:24] Jesus we count it such a great honor
[41:26] father that we would be able to sing
[41:28] that song that we just sung that we are
[41:33] free when we think of what we were the
[41:36] darkness that we were in the shackles
[41:40] father not just when we were lost but
[41:43] many of us come from a world that was
[41:45] lost and then we started out in a system
[41:49] somewhere or a church that just had part
[41:53] truth and we didn't realize that when we
[41:56] got sick saved that we were free from
[41:58] sin but we going back right back into
[42:01] tradition which is going to bind us up
[42:04] again and you're continually setting us
[42:08] as your children free I pray Lord that
[42:11] it would never become commonplace to us
[42:13] may it always be sacred and precious you
[42:17] see the word that we've read tonight
[42:18] Lord and you see what lays before us I
[42:21] pray that you'd help me to be able to
[42:24] get out of the way speak through me Lord
[42:26] God those things which be beneficial to
[42:28] your body we believe that we're in the
[42:30] last days and we know that there is a
[42:33] harvest cycle and we can see from the
[42:38] political world that's around us we can
[42:40] see from our nation the things that's
[42:43] going on in our country and around the
[42:45] world it is in a harvest cycle so we
[42:49] know that there is also a church cycle
[42:53] and if there is a church cycle then of
[42:54] course there is a bride cycle too
[42:57] so we pray that you'd help us as the
[42:59] people of God that we can receive the
[43:02] right seed and then also seow the rat SE
[43:06] speak to us from your word father I pray
[43:09] in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God
[43:12] bless you Saints you may be
[43:14] seated let's read again if you wouldn't
[43:17] mind in Genesis chap 2 verse 8 now what
[43:21] will come from the
[43:24] original establishment of God's
[43:28] God's promised word of his pattern of
[43:31] what he wanted to do and how that
[43:33] everything thereafter would follow the
[43:36] pattern that he just gave to us in
[43:39] Genesis
[43:40] 1:1 so then once God gives us something
[43:44] God is immutable God is unchangeable in
[43:46] his ways and if we can ever find the
[43:48] ways of God about something then we can
[43:51] Bank on it he'll never he'll never be
[43:54] able to to lose that so man once he
[43:57] became out of fellowship with God God
[43:59] was going to bring restitution to the
[44:01] man back to where he'd be able to
[44:02] worship and fellowship by the shed blood
[44:05] of an innocent one that was a law of God
[44:08] it's never changed to this day but now
[44:10] let's watch as we move from Genesis
[44:12] chapter 1 to Genesis chapter 2 now we
[44:15] know according to Genesis 1: 26 that
[44:19] there was a man that was made that man
[44:23] was not a man of dust but he was a man
[44:26] that bore the Heavenly image or the
[44:28] image of the Son of God now it was the
[44:33] son of God's image that he was made in
[44:36] not animal he was a spirit being in the
[44:39] image of God made he them male and
[44:41] female created him and he called their
[44:43] name Adam now we come from Genesis 1 126
[44:46] and 27 over to Genesis 28 now watch and
[44:50] the Lord God planted a garden so wonder
[44:54] what the difference was now from Genesis
[44:57] chapter 1 when God said let this seed
[45:00] come and let it bring forth of its kind
[45:02] and then God planted a garden I want you
[45:06] to notice that the garden was separate
[45:10] from the rest of the earth now when
[45:12] Moses is writing about Genesis 1:11 what
[45:15] we just said there God said let the
[45:17] Earth bring forth of its kind let the
[45:20] tree having the seed within itself the
[45:23] grass with the seed within itself and
[45:25] the herb was in the seed Within itself
[45:27] but now we come to a spot that is called
[45:31] a little bit different thing it is
[45:34] called a garden now what does a garden
[45:37] signify a garden signifies a place of
[45:42] ground or dirt that is
[45:46] Sanctified it is set apart from the rest
[45:50] of the earth is it Earth it is but it's
[45:54] also called a garden now in that God is
[45:58] going to signify a great type of what
[46:01] he's going to do many many times and
[46:03] repeat it over again and the Lord God
[46:06] planted a garden so now Genesis 1:1
[46:10] spoken word but here the Lord God
[46:14] planted a garden I want you to notice a
[46:16] difference now whenever we looked in
[46:19] Genesis 1:1 and God said not Lord God
[46:24] not compound Name Lord God God is
[46:28] compound Jehovah Elohim but in Genesis 1
[46:33] it's God said so now in Genesis 2 we're
[46:37] moving into the time that God is dealing
[46:40] with his family and when God deals with
[46:43] his family he deals with them in
[46:46] compound Redemptive name so it was Lord
[46:50] God when the devil come to Eve in this
[46:53] Garden of Eden he did not use the
[46:56] compound Redemptive name of God but he
[46:58] used just the title or the name God now
[47:02] he wants to make him aart from Eve wants
[47:05] to make her feel that he's not really
[47:08] concerned about her everyday life and
[47:10] things that she's going through that
[47:13] somehow God is disconnected from them
[47:16] and it actually worked notice in in
[47:18] Genesis 2:8 and the Lord God planted a
[47:21] garden Eastward okay so the first thing
[47:24] we see then is that God calls this
[47:28] particular place a garden and then God
[47:31] picks a certain direction on the earth
[47:35] that he places the garden now we happen
[47:38] to know where this Garden was at least
[47:43] the country it was in
[47:47] Egypt it was in Egypt now God could have
[47:51] picked the north he could have picked
[47:53] the South he could have picked the west
[47:56] but the the Lord God chose the East and
[47:59] the Lord God planted a garden Eastward
[48:03] in Eden so now the prophet tells us that
[48:06] Eden would would have been like a state
[48:10] but the Garden of Eden was its
[48:14] headquarters now remember there was four
[48:16] rivers that went out of here there was a
[48:19] land and there was Pyon and there was
[48:21] havala and then the Bible tells us there
[48:24] that the gold was there and the bedel
[48:27] and all those different things and then
[48:29] God
[48:30] Sanctified and separated a portion of
[48:34] dirt on the planet Earth and he set that
[48:38] aside for special planting special
[48:42] planting now the rest of the Earth had
[48:45] already received the seed words of God
[48:49] and they had the ability to reproduce
[48:51] himself but a garden signifies a
[48:54] Sanctified place a special place and it
[48:58] would lead us to believe that in this
[49:01] Garden there would be particular types
[49:05] of plants now for those of you that will
[49:08] before long that have a garden around
[49:10] your house whether it would be a flower
[49:13] garden or a vegetable garden depending
[49:16] on the surroundings of your home since
[49:19] we have a lot of whet tail deer in
[49:21] Tennessee you may have to put up a
[49:23] little fence or you may have to put
[49:25] something to keep the the rabbits out or
[49:27] you may have to do this or that or the
[49:29] other so what does the garden signify it
[49:33] signifies a particular spot of the earth
[49:37] that you want to plant other plants that
[49:40] are separate from everything else and
[49:43] then in that because it is a place set
[49:47] aside and hallowed and different from
[49:50] everything else you may have to surround
[49:53] it with an enclosure so you may have to
[49:57] put a fence or you may have to put
[49:59] something there that will keep the
[50:01] things outside of it from coming in and
[50:04] destroying the garden so the Lord God
[50:07] planted a garden Eastward in Edom and
[50:10] there he put the man whom he informed I
[50:13] want you to notice now about this place
[50:16] that Adam's Body actually did not come
[50:20] from the Dust In the Garden of Eden but
[50:24] it came from the state of Eden So Adam
[50:28] was not brought from the Dust In the
[50:31] Garden of Eden now remember these points
[50:34] so God creates all the Earth and then he
[50:37] makes this state called Eden and then
[50:40] God goes into this very special place
[50:43] and then he goes to planting certain
[50:46] types of trees and bushes and things
[50:50] that are going to be set aside and
[50:53] Sanctified and hallowed for him and and
[50:56] for his children now us read it again
[50:58] with that in mind and the Lord God
[51:00] planted a garden Eastward in Eden and
[51:03] there he put the man whom he had formed
[51:08] not created now remember the formed
[51:11] state of man is the state of Genesis 2
[51:16] but the created state is the man of
[51:19] Genesis 1
[51:21] 126 but this man was the man formed out
[51:25] of the
[51:27] of the earth so he put him into a
[51:30] Sanctified state that he originally did
[51:34] not come from so he was called from this
[51:37] state of Eden and placed inside or his
[51:42] adoption his position in in the kingdom
[51:45] of God is going to be in this garden now
[51:49] watch in verse n and out of the garden
[51:52] out of the ground rather uh made the
[51:55] Lord God to grow
[51:57] every tree that is Pleasant to the side
[52:00] but I want you to take notice that he
[52:02] does not say this about the Earth in
[52:06] Genesis 1: 11 and 12 and
[52:09] 13 he doesn't mention the same
[52:12] adjectives and describing these
[52:14] particular ones but out of the ground
[52:17] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[52:21] that is Pleasant to the sight so the
[52:24] trees in the garden of Eden must have
[52:28] been somewhat a a different species one
[52:32] that was more outstanding to the others
[52:35] now I know you're wondering where I'm
[52:36] going but when we get there it'll hit
[52:39] you like a bolt of lightning so there
[52:41] was certain trees and bushes and and
[52:44] fruit bearing plants and trees and and
[52:47] all types of herbaceous things that was
[52:49] on the outside but then when God
[52:52] Sanctified this certain spot and he made
[52:55] trees
[52:57] that actually even looked different so
[53:01] they were more pleasant to the sight so
[53:04] the Lord God had caused them to grow
[53:07] every tree that is Pleasant to the sight
[53:10] and good for food so notice the
[53:14] adjectives that's being used now to
[53:15] describe them so they were pleasant and
[53:18] they were good and they were good for
[53:21] food and the tree of life also is in the
[53:25] midst of the garden want again to pay
[53:27] particular attention that the tree of
[53:29] life was not out in the place of Eden
[53:35] the tree of life was in the Garden of
[53:39] Eden so if you and I are going to have
[53:43] eternal life we're going to have to get
[53:45] back in the garden amen because the tree
[53:49] of life is not just out here it's in
[53:53] Eden again now if we're going to have
[53:56] have eternal life we've got to get back
[53:59] to that tree so Moses now remember he
[54:03] was carried away into the presence of
[54:06] God to be able to write things that no
[54:08] other man in in the Bible ever wrote
[54:11] about and he says also the tree of life
[54:13] was in the midst of the garden and the
[54:16] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil then
[54:19] look at verse 10 and a river went out of
[54:24] Eden to water the Garden so a river went
[54:29] out of Eden and once it goes out of Eden
[54:32] the state then it enters into the Garden
[54:36] of Eden and when it flows out of the
[54:40] Garden of Eden it's divided into four
[54:44] different branches so it comes from Eden
[54:47] originates in Eden flows through this
[54:51] Sanctified set aart garden and once it
[54:54] goes through the garden then it comes
[54:57] out in four administrations and divides
[55:01] as it goes from the land of Egypt down
[55:03] through shaar Babylon so on and so on
[55:07] and a river went out of Eden to water
[55:09] the garden and from thence it was parted
[55:14] and became into four heads now watch in
[55:19] verse 15 Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God
[55:23] took the man and put him into the Garden
[55:28] of Eden now watch positionally placed to
[55:32] do what so the Lord God took the man and
[55:37] put him in the garden of in notice again
[55:39] he's not formed Out of the Dust of the
[55:41] garden of in but positionally placed in
[55:44] the Garden of Eden and God's now going
[55:46] to describe what he's put there for he
[55:49] put him in the Garden of Eden to dress
[55:51] it and to keep it now his his position
[55:57] was not to to Grub his position was not
[56:02] to get out there and dig and and dig up
[56:05] weeds and you know have BRS and nettles
[56:08] and thorns and sweat and labor and just
[56:12] work and work and work no he was called
[56:15] to a very mild and GLE position in the
[56:21] Garden of Eden simply to just dress it
[56:25] dress it so there'd be certain things
[56:27] that he would just trim up or things
[56:29] that he would just move about a little
[56:32] bit but here's the catch word and he was
[56:35] also to keep it now this word is a word
[56:40] which means observe watch keep an eye on
[56:45] to behold to look at now remember this
[56:50] is his adoption so he's supposed to
[56:54] dress the Garden of Eden and he's
[56:56] supposed to keep it so that lets us know
[56:59] even though God did not say up to this
[57:03] time that there was any Fallen Angels
[57:07] Moses never wrote about that part but
[57:10] yet we know the Earth was brought into
[57:13] existence after the Angels had already
[57:17] fallen and Moses no doubt knew this but
[57:20] he just did not feel inspired to tell it
[57:23] at this time did God tell Adam we don't
[57:26] know but whether he went into detail or
[57:29] not to describe every particular aspect
[57:32] of it God gave him the key word keep so
[57:38] if you're going to keep something that
[57:41] means there's going to be something or
[57:45] some things or someone that's going to
[57:49] try to take away from you what you are
[57:53] supposed to keep right I mean it just
[57:56] Comm sense so whenever you and I get our
[57:59] inheritance in Christ Jesus we become
[58:02] saved Sanctified we move on in God we
[58:05] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost get a
[58:07] walk of God in our lives and then God
[58:09] will anoint the ministry to tell us to
[58:12] watch and to pray and to be careful and
[58:15] to pray and to read your Bible and watch
[58:17] The Devil he's like a roaring Li you
[58:20] know what they're doing to you they're
[58:22] doing to you the same thing that God did
[58:25] to Adam in the Garden of Eden so they're
[58:28] telling you to dress your inheritance
[58:32] dress your family dress your walk with
[58:36] God and keep it keep your eye open Pray
[58:39] read your Bible do those things that you
[58:42] were called to do and the church said
[58:45] amen so then God places the man here in
[58:49] this Garden of Eden and we know of
[58:51] course going on with the rest of the
[58:53] story that God brought the woman into
[58:56] existence so we can see that God's great
[59:00] plan for the man actually did not start
[59:04] in a church it did not start in a great
[59:08] cathedral made of cut beautiful stone
[59:11] and mosaics on the walls and all types
[59:14] of stained glass windows and things like
[59:16] that but it actually started in a garden
[59:20] and there was a cathedral okay but it
[59:23] was a Cathedral of trees so here was man
[59:27] positionally placed in the Garden of
[59:30] Eden but the man was not completely
[59:33] satisfied because of a missing part
[59:37] which needed to be taken out of himself
[59:40] and released in order to satisfy that
[59:43] part now of course a after that God knew
[59:47] that this would take place and then when
[59:49] man fell now remember he actually fell
[59:54] in the place of of his adoption he fell
[59:59] in the place that God had put him in so
[1:00:03] it wasn't like brother Steve that he he
[1:00:06] walked out of paradise and went back to
[1:00:10] the state of Eden and then fell and then
[1:00:14] come back to the Garden of Eden on his
[1:00:16] own he fell in his adopted position so
[1:00:22] he fell in the Garden of Eden which had
[1:00:26] now entered or started the first years
[1:00:29] or however long it was of a millennium
[1:00:33] now remember the seventh day God rested
[1:00:37] doesn't mean that God was tired but God
[1:00:39] stopped from all of his initial creative
[1:00:42] works of Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 so then
[1:00:46] God entered into the seventh day which
[1:00:50] was God's Millennium and this is why
[1:00:53] that we cannot go from the seventh
[1:00:55] Church CH age straight into eternity
[1:00:58] into the number eight because eight is
[1:01:00] eternal because the Millennium was put
[1:01:04] on hold but it must be
[1:01:07] restarted again wonder where it will be
[1:01:11] lived
[1:01:12] out in a
[1:01:14] garden what Garden will it be Mars
[1:01:17] Jupiter Pluto it'll be right back on
[1:01:21] this Earth again she'll be restored to
[1:01:25] her Eden Beauty at the dawn of that
[1:01:30] seventh
[1:01:31] morning praise be to God friends that's
[1:01:34] what we're waiting for now look if you
[1:01:38] would with me in Genesis chapter uh 3
[1:01:41] verse verse 23 so after the fall
[1:01:46] therefore the Lord God sent him force
[1:01:50] from the Garden of Eden so now Adam and
[1:01:56] Eve as she is now called because she is
[1:02:00] the mother of all living and remember
[1:02:03] she did not get her own name until after
[1:02:06] she had
[1:02:08] fallen that's right he called her Eve
[1:02:12] after she had disobeyed God's word and
[1:02:16] before that time she was called Adam but
[1:02:20] she got her own name when she fell is
[1:02:24] that right which follows true with every
[1:02:26] church that's right but watch now the
[1:02:29] mercy of God being written even in the
[1:02:33] fall in the Garden of Eden therefore the
[1:02:36] Lord God sent him forth from the Garden
[1:02:40] of Eden now the Hebrew word for Eden
[1:02:44] actually means
[1:02:47] pleasure pleasure so apparently there
[1:02:51] was a difference of the joy was it the
[1:02:56] brightness of the sunshine the greenness
[1:02:58] of the trees was it was it a temperature
[1:03:01] change what was it that was different
[1:03:04] from Eden versus the Garden of Eden
[1:03:07] because if all of it was exactly the
[1:03:10] same that would be no need to call the
[1:03:14] Garden of Eden the Garden of Eden if
[1:03:16] everything looked exactly the same you
[1:03:19] remember whenever uh Sarah when God told
[1:03:22] them that they were going to have a son
[1:03:26] and Sarah laughed at what God Said and
[1:03:30] she said shall I have
[1:03:33] pleasure with my Lord actually in the
[1:03:37] Hebrew Sarah says well I have
[1:03:42] eaten will I have eeden with my Lord
[1:03:49] again so you can imagine how father must
[1:03:53] have felt that day when this scripture
[1:03:56] was fulfilled therefore the Lord God but
[1:04:00] again pay attention to the word that
[1:04:03] Moses uses to describe him and he uses
[1:04:07] that compound name again not
[1:04:12] God Lord
[1:04:15] God therefore the Lord God sent him
[1:04:19] forth from the Garden of Eden to till
[1:04:24] the ground
[1:04:26] from whence he was taken so he goes back
[1:04:32] to the very spot that he woke up that
[1:04:36] first morning notice where he sent back
[1:04:40] to after he falls so God sends him back
[1:04:45] to the very spot now it must have been
[1:04:48] quite alarming when the Lord God makes
[1:04:52] this man and the prophet catches a
[1:04:56] glimpse of and he said he stood there
[1:04:58] like a tree and his toes was like the
[1:05:02] roots of a tree down in the ground and
[1:05:05] his arms like the branches and there was
[1:05:08] no life in the man so he would have
[1:05:11] stood there maybe in resemblance of size
[1:05:13] to what we are today but he was just a
[1:05:17] bulk or a mass of tissue and senu and
[1:05:22] atoms and molecules and organs and hair
[1:05:26] and bones and fingernails and all of
[1:05:28] that but he was not yet a living being
[1:05:32] and the Lord God breathed into his
[1:05:34] nostrils the breath of life and Adam
[1:05:37] became a living Soul so when God
[1:05:40] breathed into him and he caught the
[1:05:44] breath of life and his eyes come open
[1:05:47] and then his being started by animation
[1:05:51] animation of the Breath of God he
[1:05:53] started feeling and his heart heart
[1:05:55] beating and his lungs going in and out
[1:05:58] and blood pressure and so on and so on
[1:06:01] and so on remember Adam was not a little
[1:06:03] baby boy but Adam was created a full
[1:06:06] grown man and now the Lord God after his
[1:06:11] Disobedience sends him right back to the
[1:06:14] spot notice where he goes back to
[1:06:17] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[1:06:19] from the Garden of Eden to tell his
[1:06:23] position is now changed he is not now
[1:06:26] going to keep and protect or
[1:06:30] guard but he's not going to just trim
[1:06:34] around a little bit but now God uses a
[1:06:36] different word now he's going to
[1:06:40] till till the ground from whence he was
[1:06:44] taken so he drove out the man listen how
[1:06:48] sad he
[1:06:50] drove he drove get out leave
[1:06:57] go oh how that must have broke his
[1:07:00] heart how that must have broke Father's
[1:07:05] Heart he let him in but drove him
[1:07:10] out how it hurts the hearts of parents
[1:07:15] when their children go
[1:07:17] astray and they're trying to find a way
[1:07:20] to deal with them you don't want to run
[1:07:23] them deeper into sin of course
[1:07:26] you don't want to compromise and you're
[1:07:28] trying to find that delicate spot but
[1:07:32] what I love about God was that God did
[1:07:36] not ride him off and say you know what
[1:07:40] you go Ahad and do whatever you want to
[1:07:41] do I ain't hanging around you no more
[1:07:44] but God took the action of his own son
[1:07:49] so instead of the Lord God staying in
[1:07:52] the garden and putting man on the
[1:07:54] outside side and changing the climate
[1:07:58] the temperature and changing everything
[1:08:01] on the outside of the garden and leaving
[1:08:04] the garden the same because all the
[1:08:05] animals of course were changed too some
[1:08:09] of them become carnivorous that never
[1:08:11] been before meat eaters so the lion
[1:08:15] looked at the lamb totally different
[1:08:18] after Adam fell everything had now
[1:08:21] changed those earth going to tilt on its
[1:08:24] axis soon after this and the seasons
[1:08:27] will start coming on the Earth but God
[1:08:30] did not leave the Garden of Eden and
[1:08:33] that original pleasure state but God so
[1:08:38] changed the Garden of Eden that it has
[1:08:43] disappeared believe me I've been to the
[1:08:45] land of Egypt you move out from the Nile
[1:08:49] you move out from Little oases that are
[1:08:52] here and there and there all you're
[1:08:55] going to see is Miles and Miles of
[1:09:00] sand where is that Garden of Eden that
[1:09:04] was in Egypt and God took his son and
[1:09:09] daughters shame and walked out with them
[1:09:13] if you can't be here I don't want to be
[1:09:17] here without you the Lord God did not
[1:09:20] want to be in Paradise alone oh my any
[1:09:24] parents said in this place tonight that
[1:09:26] knows if you've got a wayward child even
[1:09:29] though you're not doing what they're
[1:09:31] doing there is an element about you that
[1:09:35] will never be satisfied quite the same
[1:09:38] again until that son or daughter comes
[1:09:40] back to Paradise is that right oh may
[1:09:44] God help us as we deal with them but
[1:09:48] notice now the Lord God has to change
[1:09:51] his demeanor and it must have been quite
[1:09:54] frightening for the man he had never
[1:09:57] heard God raise his voice he had never
[1:10:02] heard God in a sharp demanding tone he
[1:10:07] had never heard his father with that
[1:10:10] something hairy that he would hear in
[1:10:13] his voice and when he heard him just
[1:10:15] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:10:18] day the man and his wife hid themselves
[1:10:22] from that presence oh my so so the Lord
[1:10:26] God now drives him drives him out of the
[1:10:32] Garden of Eden so he drove out the man
[1:10:35] and he placed at the east of the Garden
[1:10:39] of Eden
[1:10:41] chams and a flaming sword which turned
[1:10:46] every way to keep the way of the tree of
[1:10:51] life so now God puts angels and they're
[1:10:55] standing there turning turning don't you
[1:10:58] come near Adam stay away Abel don't you
[1:11:02] come near sth stay
[1:11:05] away don't come near I'll kill
[1:11:08] you Lord God children how grateful we
[1:11:12] are to be tonight to know one day that
[1:11:14] same Lord God that tree of life was born
[1:11:18] of a virgin and become a human being so
[1:11:21] tonight instead of trying to drive us
[1:11:24] away from the Tree of life he's standing
[1:11:26] here with the arms of the Tree of Life
[1:11:28] wide open saying come back children come
[1:11:31] on back with me to the Garden of Eden oh
[1:11:35] Hallelujah now but God after the
[1:11:40] picture now changes so from a a a garden
[1:11:46] of a perfect paradise and where that it
[1:11:49] was and as I said totally lost to men
[1:11:52] don't know where it's at all different
[1:11:55] ones hisop Babylons and different ones
[1:11:57] they have written about their idea where
[1:12:00] it was and you could go and spend the
[1:12:02] rest of your life in the land of Egypt
[1:12:05] looking searching looking searching I
[1:12:08] don't believe it'll ever be found but I
[1:12:10] do believe that God will restore it
[1:12:13] again I'm plan on living in
[1:12:16] it but God still wanted to use a garden
[1:12:21] in symbols in the Old Testament and also
[1:12:25] in the new now we've been talking about
[1:12:28] us sowing our seed and God sowing his
[1:12:30] seed and we'll we'll bring this back
[1:12:32] into view now that the Lord God SED his
[1:12:36] first seed son on the earth and he
[1:12:41] brought this seed's son into a garden of
[1:12:46] paradise so God sowed his seed in the
[1:12:50] womb of the earth and that son was Adam
[1:12:56] now every son should have come forth by
[1:12:59] that spoken word birth but God knew now
[1:13:02] that this would happen so God still
[1:13:04] wanted to use the symbol of a garden
[1:13:08] down through the scripture now let us
[1:13:10] turn if you with the Song of Solomon 4
[1:13:14] verse2 now here is Solomon and the
[1:13:17] shulamite now remember I've told you
[1:13:18] before years ago whenever I took the the
[1:13:21] Song of Solomon and preached on it that
[1:13:24] that the Hebrew Brews the even the
[1:13:26] modern day Jews today will not let their
[1:13:29] children read The Song of Solomon
[1:13:32] because it is so plain until they become
[1:13:35] of Age The Song of Solomon was called by
[1:13:39] the Hebrew Scholars to be the inner
[1:13:42] sanctum or the holy of holies of the Old
[1:13:46] Testament books of the Bible so it is
[1:13:49] called canticles c a n t i c l e s
[1:13:52] canticles or the song of Solomon we
[1:13:56] don't know what the woman's name was but
[1:13:58] we know that a title one of the titles
[1:14:01] given to her was shulamite or schulas
[1:14:06] Smith either way Babylonian schula Smith
[1:14:10] shulamite Hebrew but shulamite is the is
[1:14:14] the feminist form of
[1:14:17] Solomon and wean know the story of the
[1:14:20] shulamite and how that Solomon came to
[1:14:23] her and found her and transformed her
[1:14:27] from a little girl that had lived a
[1:14:30] simple Country Life and was a
[1:14:32] shepherdess and she wasn't really
[1:14:34] thought very highly of by her parents
[1:14:36] apparently and by her brothers and she
[1:14:39] said about herself I am black but I'm
[1:14:41] comely so she was looked down on because
[1:14:44] fair skin during this time frame was
[1:14:47] very very lifted up and exalted so she'd
[1:14:49] been out in the herds and Out Among the
[1:14:51] sheep and so on so it took quite some
[1:14:55] some transition to where that this bride
[1:14:58] would move from a life of a country girl
[1:15:02] into palace life so Solomon had to
[1:15:07] constantly be able to try to transform
[1:15:11] her Thinking by giving her descriptive
[1:15:15] terms of his love now listen so he would
[1:15:20] constantly say things to her in order to
[1:15:25] Elevate her beyond what she thought
[1:15:28] about herself which is one to be one of
[1:15:31] our greatest challenges in this hour now
[1:15:33] by the time we move here to chapter 4:
[1:15:37] 12 he's entered into a pretty deep state
[1:15:41] with what he wants to the the bride to
[1:15:43] see what she is now listen what he says
[1:15:46] a garden
[1:15:48] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[1:15:54] shutter
[1:15:55] a fountain seal now again keep in mind
[1:15:58] when we run this parallel of what a
[1:16:01] fountain a a garden a spring all of
[1:16:04] these plants what they represent so now
[1:16:07] he's identifying his wife as a garden
[1:16:13] well now you remember that Eve was a
[1:16:17] garden in the
[1:16:20] garden so Eden was a garden in the
[1:16:25] garden of the Earth the planting of the
[1:16:28] earth and this was a sacred hallowed
[1:16:31] Place set apart from the rest of Eden
[1:16:34] called a Garden of Eden a pleasure of
[1:16:38] Eden so now he is calling her also a
[1:16:43] garden but it's not just a garden but
[1:16:46] it's got special frames of words that he
[1:16:49] uses now he said a garden enclosed is my
[1:16:54] sister so she's not just a garden but
[1:16:58] she's in an enclosed Garden so the
[1:17:02] loveliness of the Bride is now set forth
[1:17:06] under the image of a garden that has
[1:17:10] been barred and separated from Intruders
[1:17:15] now remember the prophet tells us that
[1:17:17] the devil slid or crawled or something
[1:17:20] like that underneath the garden gate in
[1:17:23] the Garden of Eden so the Garden of Eden
[1:17:26] was also enclosed as you and I are
[1:17:30] tonight by the grace of God so inside
[1:17:33] the Garden of Eden was these rare exotic
[1:17:36] plants and beautiful trees and so on so
[1:17:40] Solomon takes the same descriptive terms
[1:17:44] to describe his wife now he sees in her
[1:17:48] a parallel now this is a common thing
[1:17:51] among the kings of the East that they
[1:17:54] would have a little special place
[1:17:57] sometimes it would be in the city walls
[1:18:00] sometimes according to the fertility of
[1:18:01] the land it might be outside the city
[1:18:04] wall but they would have a certain spot
[1:18:07] and it would be called The King's Garden
[1:18:10] a lot of times it would be near a source
[1:18:13] of water and the king would have a
[1:18:16] certain spot that he would drink and
[1:18:19] they would actually lock up that spot
[1:18:23] and no one could drink out of it but the
[1:18:25] king himself so he looks at the
[1:18:28] shulamite and he says that she is a
[1:18:32] garden en closed so she's watered by
[1:18:37] Abundant streams she has plants that are
[1:18:41] so rare and so
[1:18:44] exotic but then he also says that she's
[1:18:48] in closed so now we are not only like a
[1:18:51] garden that hopefully we are very
[1:18:53] fruitful and bringing forth what the
[1:18:55] Lord God wants us to bring forth but we
[1:18:57] are also a garden that is enclosed now
[1:19:01] keep in mind that if these Gardens were
[1:19:03] not enclosed they had wild pigs in the
[1:19:06] land remember the Bible says take us the
[1:19:09] little foxes for it is the little foxes
[1:19:13] that spoil the Vines Now the little
[1:19:16] foxes before they become mature what
[1:19:18] they would do is they would come in and
[1:19:20] start nibbling on the grape Vines it's
[1:19:22] peculiar the way they would do it
[1:19:24] because they would start right down at
[1:19:26] the very bottom and they would eat the
[1:19:28] BART because it was real young and
[1:19:30] tender and they would eat all that bark
[1:19:33] all the way around that vine and when
[1:19:36] they would do that the vine then would
[1:19:38] become open to all types of insects and
[1:19:41] many times the vine would actually die
[1:19:44] so the little foxes would then spoil the
[1:19:47] whole Vine so there were wild boar there
[1:19:50] were foxes there were Jackal there were
[1:19:52] different types of things so they would
[1:19:55] enclose the Garden in order to only let
[1:20:00] entrance be by certain ones and to keep
[1:20:04] everything else outside of it now I
[1:20:07] realize that people look at us today and
[1:20:10] they look at our sisters the way they
[1:20:12] dress they look at us brothers and the
[1:20:14] way we do the way we preach what we talk
[1:20:17] and so on they think them people are
[1:20:18] really weird and they think you know my
[1:20:21] I feel so sorry for them cuz they can't
[1:20:23] go here they can't go there that can't
[1:20:25] do this and the other you know there
[1:20:26] there's lots of things that we can do we
[1:20:29] just don't want to do them we just ought
[1:20:31] not to do it and they look at it as
[1:20:34] Prison Walls they're not Prison Walls to
[1:20:37] us it's our garden walls amen and it
[1:20:41] keeps uh all this out here of the world
[1:20:44] but skip it keeps it away from our
[1:20:46] delicate plants I don't know about you
[1:20:48] but I'm still growing you know a garden
[1:20:50] is a sign where things are growing is
[1:20:53] that right and you've got delicate
[1:20:55] stages of maybe Temperance and and
[1:20:58] delicate stages of godliness and
[1:21:00] delicate stages of a brotherly kindness
[1:21:03] and you've got to protect them and
[1:21:05] nurture them while they're in this
[1:21:07] growing stage so a very striking thing
[1:21:10] then of the garden here in the Song of
[1:21:13] Solomon is a similarity to what we
[1:21:16] looked at to the Garden of Eden so she
[1:21:19] was a plot of
[1:21:22] ground which had been been set apart
[1:21:26] from her mother her father her brothers
[1:21:29] from the country the North country from
[1:21:31] when she come from she had been pulled
[1:21:35] apart by the king she found favor in his
[1:21:39] eyes and he set her apart and Sanctified
[1:21:44] her to
[1:21:47] himself then he puts a a a fence around
[1:21:52] her and encloses her in his love and
[1:21:57] favor and mercy so she is a plot of
[1:22:01] ground that is Sanctified to receive the
[1:22:05] king sea so she's not common ground
[1:22:10] anymore amen she's not common ground
[1:22:14] anymore but she's now set apart now
[1:22:18] watch how he looks at her so he says now
[1:22:22] she is a garden an encl closed Garden so
[1:22:26] she's separate she's distinct from all
[1:22:30] the rest of the dirt the only thing that
[1:22:33] makes your dirt any different than
[1:22:35] anybody else's dirt is the grace of God
[1:22:38] and the grace of God pulled on you and I
[1:22:40] aren't you grateful that he did so now
[1:22:44] he wants to forbid entrance to not just
[1:22:48] everybody that would pass by as as I
[1:22:51] said those of you that will plant a
[1:22:52] garden before long and you want to keep
[1:22:54] an eye on what's there and you have to
[1:22:56] keep things out and and you don't want
[1:22:58] certain pests and certain bugs and this
[1:23:00] and that and the other so the king wants
[1:23:03] to have this garden enclosed to where
[1:23:07] the fruit will only be accessible to him
[1:23:12] no
[1:23:14] preachers no
[1:23:15] Bishops no
[1:23:17] popes only the king so it is a spring
[1:23:23] shut up a fountain sealed now watch this
[1:23:29] read again a garden
[1:23:30] enclosed is my
[1:23:35] sister my
[1:23:38] spouse my
[1:23:41] sister let me just blow you away from
[1:23:44] the
[1:23:45] get-go a Christian man should only
[1:23:50] marry one of his sisters
[1:23:55] a Christian
[1:23:57] woman should only marry one of her
[1:24:08] brothers he said brother da Lord have
[1:24:11] mercy what are you talking about you're
[1:24:12] answering to the bride of Christ i't
[1:24:15] talking about your flesh brother sh to
[1:24:17] the goodness you know that but notice
[1:24:20] the
[1:24:21] time that here he is called call in her
[1:24:26] first my
[1:24:29] sister my sister you see he himself it
[1:24:35] is Christ anointing Solomon in the
[1:24:39] parallel and the answering to the anot
[1:24:41] type of the New Testament that Christ
[1:24:45] sister will be born of the same father
[1:24:50] and have the same divine
[1:24:52] nature can't you see what why he cannot
[1:24:55] marry just church
[1:24:58] members the only ones that will be in
[1:25:01] the bride of Christ must be his
[1:25:06] sister praise be to God I was hoping
[1:25:09] y'all would get that oh my she is not
[1:25:13] only his bride but she is his
[1:25:19] sister sister by divine nature
[1:25:25] my sister my spouse so my sister is one
[1:25:30] by birth a partaker of the same nature
[1:25:35] now my spouse that is one that is by
[1:25:40] love or joined by a sacred tie of divine
[1:25:46] affection amen which cannot be broken
[1:25:51] sister by birth SP spous by choice
[1:25:56] sister by birth I'm the oldest of seven
[1:25:59] kids and I'm here to tell you I didn't
[1:26:01] get to pick a one of my brothers or one
[1:26:03] of my sisters and they didn't get to
[1:26:05] pick me and it's probably a good chance
[1:26:06] a good thing because they might not have
[1:26:08] picked me but you know what the Lord God
[1:26:11] knew all of his people that were eating
[1:26:16] dirt and he's the one who set them aside
[1:26:20] now God could have chose the state of
[1:26:22] Tennessee God could have knows Florida
[1:26:25] oh some of you all would have put the
[1:26:26] Garden of Eden in Florida you love
[1:26:28] Florida so much you'd move to Florida if
[1:26:31] I'd only moved down there and start a
[1:26:32] church forget it I don't like Florida
[1:26:35] none the seol can have it back that is a
[1:26:38] quote from what the prophet said some of
[1:26:40] you would want the Garden of Eden in
[1:26:41] Arizona but God put it in the land of
[1:26:44] Egypt it was the Lord God that chose it
[1:26:47] it was the Lord God that chose the
[1:26:49] rarest most exotic most Pleasant plants
[1:26:53] that he could have set everywhere in
[1:26:55] Eden but he didn't set them everywhere
[1:26:58] but he saved special ones to go in the

[1:28:30] thing it'll be worth the wait if you
[1:28:31] wind up getting a son of Eden instead of
[1:28:33] getting one of these Eden boys because
[1:28:35] you get one of them Eden boys and you're
[1:28:37] a daughter of Eden you're going to have
[1:28:38] two different desires you want to go to
[1:28:40] churches two different places you'll
[1:28:42] want to feed on different stuff you'll
[1:28:44] be feeding on bride food he won't want

[1:28:52] Delicacies you're used to exotic stuff
[1:28:55] come on somebody don't you understand
[1:28:57] why the Lord Jesus cannot marry

[1:29:01] heaven everybody that says they're a
[1:29:03] Christian he's looking for his eeden
[1:29:06] bride by
[1:29:10] choice Glory
[1:29:14] Hallelujah the first term sister oh my
[1:29:19] implies
[1:29:20] kinship of nature can you imagine the
[1:29:25] Lord Jesus Christ Paul writing about him
[1:29:29] in the book of Hebrews and saying for
[1:29:31] which
[1:29:32] cause he is not ashamed to call them
[1:29:39] Brethren singing in the midst of the
[1:29:42] congregation he would sing among his
[1:29:49] brothers I ain't a low down wretched
[1:29:52] good for nothing sinner I have been
[1:29:56] changed I'm a rare exotic
[1:30:00] plant Hallelujah to God I am of my
[1:30:04] heavenly father's planting not of yours
[1:30:08] amen amen aren't you glad of that
[1:30:11] tonight so the spouse indicates another
[1:30:16] relationship all together by his choice
[1:30:21] you imagine Jesus when he told the
[1:30:23] disciples
[1:30:24] you have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:30:27] you and ordained you that you should go
[1:30:31] forth and bring forth fruit oh when he
[1:30:34] raised from the dead he never called
[1:30:37] them brothers until he raised from the
[1:30:40] dead and he said go tell my
[1:30:46] brothers Hallelujah why the blood of the
[1:30:51] Lord God had been shed and the way back
[1:30:55] to the Garden of Eden had now been made
[1:30:58] he could officially call them who they
[1:31:01] are no longer will I call you slaves he
[1:31:04] called him in friends St John 17 and he
[1:31:07] was able to move up into a higher sphere
[1:31:10] there in the communion room but then
[1:31:12] after his resurrection not just friends
[1:31:15] not just servants not just Bond servants
[1:31:18] but
[1:31:19] Brothers
[1:31:22] Brothers Hallelujah
[1:31:26] you see this communion in the spouse
[1:31:29] stage is so
[1:31:31] powerful that the woman will
[1:31:34] forfeit her
[1:31:39] name she will forfeit her maiden
[1:31:44] name glory to
[1:31:47] God and be
[1:31:50] merged into the name of her husband
[1:31:54] Mr and M Donnie
[1:31:57] Reagan that's bad if you don't like
[1:31:59] Donnie or Reagan because when you get me
[1:32:02] you get my name can't you say why all
[1:32:05] these churches that don't want his name
[1:32:06] even in baptism they don't want it
[1:32:09] casting out Devils but we want it I said
[1:32:13] we want
[1:32:14] it you see what happens to the woman
[1:32:18] because of the forfeiture of what she is
[1:32:21] and her name and so on she merges
[1:32:24] into the person of her
[1:32:29] husband and brings a
[1:32:33] magnification to his
[1:32:36] personality glory be to God
[1:32:40] hallelujah thank you Lord God you see he
[1:32:43] loves us so
[1:32:46] much that he says come into me
[1:32:49] children by the absorption of my love
[1:32:54] come into me forfeit your titles of this
[1:32:57] and that and the other do away with your
[1:33:00] baptisms of this and that and the other
[1:33:02] oh my one of the brothers today think
[1:33:04] brother Joel Brown had posted on the on
[1:33:06] the minister chat we have here at the
[1:33:08] church and he somebody had ask Instagram
[1:33:11] about the water baptism and Instagram
[1:33:13] was able to go to the maybe banic
[1:33:16] encyclopedia and ask when it was changed
[1:33:19] from father son holy ghost from the name
[1:33:22] the Lord Jesus rather the father son
[1:33:24] Holy Ghost and even that encyclopedia
[1:33:27] had it right too bad a bunch of the
[1:33:29] churches don't have it right in the day
[1:33:30] we're living
[1:33:32] in oh my but he loves us so much that he
[1:33:37] says children come into me and be
[1:33:43] absorbed into my
[1:33:45] love take my nature my
[1:33:50] attributes come to Paradise my
[1:33:54] children don't just stay in the saved
[1:33:57] State called Eden don't just stay in the
[1:34:01] safe State you know with modern
[1:34:04] Christianity but come into
[1:34:08] Paradise
[1:34:10] oh I wish I was out by myself about
[1:34:13] right now I'd run and scream like a wild
[1:34:15] Indian and speaking a language that I
[1:34:16] don't know what I'm talking about
[1:34:19] hallelujah amen he has participated in
[1:34:24] our nature that we might
[1:34:27] participate in
[1:34:34] his now
[1:34:36] watch so he calls her a garden
[1:34:42] enclosed is my
[1:34:44] sister my
[1:34:47] spouse and then he says she is a
[1:34:52] spring shut up
[1:34:55] a
[1:34:56] spring shut up so a fountain which is
[1:35:02] reserved only for the
[1:35:05] king's
[1:35:07] pleasure it is said that there was a
[1:35:10] place from the guihan
[1:35:13] spring out of
[1:35:16] Jerusalem and they found that when
[1:35:19] Solomon was King and he would go there
[1:35:23] there
[1:35:24] frequently and
[1:35:27] drink and he designed a
[1:35:30] lock to be put and they had a gate
[1:35:33] around
[1:35:34] it amen it must have been one day he
[1:35:38] when he went down
[1:35:39] there and he took his key and whatever
[1:35:42] more he was the only one now that had
[1:35:45] the key other people might come to there
[1:35:48] and say let me in let me
[1:35:52] in but the King was the only one that
[1:35:56] had the key to the
[1:35:59] door it must have been maybe in a
[1:36:02] similar
[1:36:03] circumstance that he

[1:36:56] shut up look at all these adjectives
