[39:13] in thy heart that is the word of faith
[39:17] which we preach that if Thou shalt
[39:19] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus

[40:17] Bridle the whole body behold we put bits
[40:20] in the horse's mouths that they may obey
[40:22] us and we turn about their whole body

[40:27] here
[40:27] now also behold the ships which though
[40:30] they be so great and they are driven of
[40:32] fierce winds yet are they turned about
[40:34] with a very small Helm amen withs soever
[40:37] the governor listeth even so the tongue
[40:40] is a little member and boasteth great
[40:42] things behold how great a matter a
[40:45] little fire kindleth and the tongue is a
[40:48] fire a world of iniquity so is the
[40:51] tongue among our members that it
[40:53] defileth the whole body and sth on fire
[40:56] the course of nature and it is set on
[40:59] fire of Hell James is real he's one of
[41:02] those kind of
[41:04] pastors for every kind of beasts and
[41:06] birds and serpents and things in the sea
[41:08] is tamed and hath been tamed of
[41:10] mankind amen but the tongue can no man
[41:14] tame it is an unruly evil it's full of
[41:17] deadly poison therewith bless we God
[41:19] even the father and therewith curse We
[41:21] Men which are made after the similitude
[41:23] of God out of the same mouth proceedeth
[41:26] blessing and cursing and my brethren
[41:29] these things ought not to be amen these
[41:33] things ought not to be you believe in
[41:35] the Law of Confession amen let's have a

[42:31] maybe you're sitting beside somebody
[42:32] that you don't know or uh not now thanks
[42:36] but uh and so you know maybe you got a
[42:38] little bit little that tightness or you
[42:40] know uh we got to break through some
[42:42] things to just get into the swing of the
[42:44] ministry this weekend why don't you do
[42:45] this turn to somebody next to you give
[42:47] them a big smile shake them by the hand
[42:50] amen we're here to have a we're have
[42:51] we're here to have a youth weekend amen
[42:53] and and uh I think we should just uh we
[42:56] should just enjoy it amen I I'm looking
[42:58] out at so many familiar faces I just
[43:00] feel that I'm among friends is that
[43:02] right I feel that I'm among friends and
[43:04] I know that you love me and I I
[43:06] certainly love you and I I hope that you
[43:08] know that and so and so uh I just want
[43:11] to be myself and let's just settle into
[43:13] this thought and and ask the Lord to
[43:14] come on the scene will you help me
[43:16] preach tonight amen will you will you
[43:18] will you pull amen amen if you'll pull
[43:20] I'll preach amen we'll just believe the
[43:22] Lord will come on the scene so I'd like
[43:24] to preach a sermon tonight I'd like to
[43:26] title it changing the narrative changing
[43:30] the narrative amen and of course it's
[43:32] just a sermon on the Law of Confession
[43:35] amen which is a law of God's word amen
[43:38] it's a law that's in effect for every
[43:40] Christian amen is that you you find that
[43:42] everything that we receive from God is
[43:45] going to come to us in our Christian
[43:47] Journey Through The Law of Confession
[43:49] and the way that that works it works in
[43:51] several steps the first thing that
[43:53] happens is uh is faith comes by hearing
[43:55] amen and so uh the way that the way that
[43:58] we receive things from God is uh we
[44:00] can't receive anything unless a preacher
[44:02] comes amen or a messenger and and brings
[44:04] a revelation and then God's word is
[44:06] spoken to you and you hear it now when
[44:08] you hear it uh it's not just good enough
[44:10] just to sit in a church and and hear the
[44:12] word preach but then that faith when it
[44:14] comes into you amen has got to be mixed
[44:17] with fa that word has got to be mixed
[44:19] with faith amen amen that's the next
[44:21] step is when you hear the word amen and
[44:23] then it's mixed it with faith in your
[44:25] heart and and you believe in your heart
[44:27] now if you believe it in your heart
[44:29] you're going to confess it with your
[44:30] mouth because whatever the mouth is
[44:32] speaking amen it's revealing what's
[44:34] going on in the heart amen and so the
[44:36] process isn't complete until you've
[44:38] heard the word and it's been Mi mixed
[44:40] with faith amen and then when you speak
[44:42] it brother brandom said God comes on the
[44:44] scene and he'll be the high priest of
[44:47] your confession amen the high priest of
[44:50] your confession you say well uh why is
[44:53] it that I seem that I I'm am not
[44:55] receiving the blessings of the Lord amen
[44:57] it's cuz you're missing your part amen
[44:59] you have got to make a confession amen
[45:01] then your high priest will come on the
[45:03] scene and he'll intercede and and he'll
[45:05] Quicken the faith that's in you to bring
[45:07] something to pass amen but that's God's
[45:09] law that's that's the way that God made
[45:11] it and uh you know in a in a certain way
[45:13] of looking at it uh uh as brother Braham
[45:15] is teaching on this Law of Confession we
[45:17] find that we have an all powerful God
[45:19] but he even limits himself to your
[45:21] confession he limits his power to what
[45:23] you will confess what you will believe
[45:25] what you will profess with your mouth
[45:26] are you with me tonight amen you see
[45:28] where I'm going here so we read in the
[45:29] Book of James amen how important this
[45:32] little guy this little guy called the
[45:33] tongue how important that tongue is Amen
[45:37] to you and to your future and to your
[45:39] journey and to your success as a
[45:41] Christian it's all important amen uh
[45:44] what is coming out of your mouth amen is
[45:46] all important to you as Christian
[45:47] there's power especially as a Christian
[45:50] there's power in the words that you say
[45:52] amen and more than just the words that
[45:54] you say but your your confession amen
[45:57] your expression of Faith your expression
[45:58] of what you believe in your heart amen
[46:00] amen and so James will tell us that the
[46:03] tongue he'll use two analogies for the
[46:05] tongue and both of them are a seat of
[46:07] control amen one of them it's just a
[46:09] little bit just a little piece of metal
[46:11] or leather amen that they put into the
[46:12] horse of a mouth uh into the mouth of a
[46:14] horse amen and so and the horse is he
[46:17] might be a great big strong animal amen
[46:20] with great power and great force amen
[46:22] but but with a little bit you can
[46:25] control that horse you can control his
[46:27] Direction amen you you you see it's a
[46:30] seat of control you take a great big
[46:32] ship and that ship it it's carrying a
[46:34] great cargo amen it's heavy it's massive
[46:37] amen it's tossed by the winds and it's
[46:39] tossed by the waves and amen and so
[46:41] there's a lot of great forces involved
[46:43] in the sailing of a ship amen but all of
[46:46] those amen have to come subject Amen to
[46:48] a little thing called a Helm amen which
[46:51] turns the rudder of that ship and it
[46:52] determines the direction of the voyage
[46:55] amen amen see your tongue is the seat of
[46:57] control in your life whatever is coming
[47:00] out of this tongue whatever it's
[47:01] speaking whatever the confession is your
[47:03] life is going to follow it no matter how
[47:05] much power is involved how much strength
[47:07] or how much ability or or or how much
[47:10] religious efforts that you put in amen
[47:12] it's your confession is the law that God
[47:14] works by amen and so it's got a power to
[47:17] it and that power can either be
[47:20] harnessed by God or it can be harnessed
[47:22] by the
[47:23] devil amen the power of the tongue is
[47:25] either going to be harnessed by the Lord
[47:27] or it's going to be harnessed by the
[47:29] devil because it's a seat of control so
[47:31] your Christian life is going to be
[47:32] controlled by whatever power rules your
[47:35] tongue Amen brother brandom said that he
[47:37] cannot do one thing for you until you
[47:40] first believe in your heart that he's
[47:42] done it and then say that he's done it
[47:45] and the minute that you believe it and
[47:47] say it he's there to make intercession
[47:50] upon your confession now watch this now
[47:52] he said now you could come to the altar
[47:54] here and you could scream and cry and
[47:56] walk up and down the floor and scream
[47:58] God saved me a sinner it wouldn't do one
[48:00] Speck of good amen you could do it
[48:02] tonight all night all day tomorrow and
[48:05] the next night and beat on the floor
[48:07] anything that you want to do you're just
[48:09] giving vent to your feeling amen now you
[48:12] you know you've been to Our Youth Camp
[48:13] you know how we feel about altars and
[48:15] emotions and all those things not that
[48:16] guy amen but it's true amen that you can
[48:19] do all those things but you'll never be
[48:21] saved brother brandom said until you
[48:23] first believe it and then confess it
[48:26] amen it's a very simple thing it's very
[48:28] simple it's not complicated but it's a
[48:30] law of God a law of God Amen not just a
[48:34] most of the time it's a law of God Amen
[48:37] that and so you you you got to forgive
[48:38] me I I'm an engineer by trade and so
[48:40] I've got I've got that kind of a brain
[48:42] and I love laws amen I I I love I I love
[48:46] I love uh uh uh things that operate by a
[48:48] law because once you understand the law
[48:51] then you can put it to work amen or or
[48:54] if it fails amen when you
[48:57] understand the law then you understand
[48:59] why it failed isn't that right amen and
[49:01] so amen and this is the law this is the
[49:04] system that God created it's God's way
[49:07] for you to receive the blessings amen
[49:10] now now how many know the devil is not a
[49:12] Creator the devil has never innovated
[49:13] anything in his life all that the devil
[49:15] can do is take what God already created
[49:18] and he and he can twist it and he can
[49:20] pervert it and he can put it to work for
[49:22] Satan's kingdom amen he can't create a
[49:24] new system he can't go outside God God's
[49:27] law all that the devil can do is use the
[49:29] same Law of Confession to get the power
[49:32] that's in your tongue amen and that's
[49:34] where you go wrong that's where the
[49:36] failure comes that's where the Battle Is
[49:38] Lost right there Amen brother B talked
[49:40] about the reason people don't believe in
[49:42] Divine Healing he said because the devil
[49:44] found a weak spot in you and he
[49:46] perverted it but God is the Healer amen
[49:50] God is the Healer and that's why we
[49:51] battle amen that's why we're fighting
[49:53] the prophet would say the greatest
[49:55] battle ever fought and it's not it's not
[49:57] on a battlefield amen it's not out on a
[50:00] plane it's right here in the mind amen
[50:03] because all the time the devil is
[50:04] bombarding you with his lies we're
[50:06] living in a world where there's so many
[50:08] voices so many influences amen there's
[50:11] so much uh amen there's so much
[50:13] preaching in hardly any of his Bible
[50:15] amen but it's but the devil is preaching
[50:17] you a sermon every day amen and he comes
[50:19] to you amen and he's and he's trying to
[50:21] pitch you something he's trying to sell
[50:23] you something he's trying to convince
[50:25] you of something and and cause you in
[50:27] your heart to believe it and if it can
[50:29] just get you to doubt amen the word of
[50:32] God and take what he's got to say Amen
[50:35] then all he needs to do is get you to
[50:37] confess amen the devil's message and
[50:40] that's how he gets the control over the
[50:42] church amen that's how he gets young
[50:44] people into trouble that's how he keeps
[50:46] them from the good things of God Amen is
[50:48] that he harnesses the law of the tongue
[50:51] amen see that's why Satan has the power
[50:53] to bring oppressive Spirits into your
[50:55] life why cuz he's operating by the law
[50:58] that God put into place amen you look at
[51:01] Eve Eve fell how did she fall she fell
[51:04] amen when she doubted one word when she
[51:07] doubted one word amen when when she
[51:09] would take well 99% of the word of God
[51:12] Amen but then Satan comes with a
[51:14] proposition amen and she begins to give
[51:16] ground say well maybe surely not may
[51:19] there's got to be a little wiggle room
[51:21] we got to have a balance oh may you know
[51:24] uh uh maybe maybe he didn't really mean
[51:26] that or maybe you know maybe maybe
[51:27] that's not really what the scripture is
[51:29] saying amen one word amen amen and it
[51:31] gives the devil a foothold Amen to seize
[51:34] power amen the power to control your
[51:37] life was never meant for the devil amen
[51:39] but that power is reserved for your
[51:42] heavenly father amen he put a law in
[51:44] effect amen so that you could receive
[51:46] blessings from him amen but if you
[51:48] surrender that to the
[51:50] devil amen that's where you go wrong
[51:53] that's where it fails amen and see
[51:55] there's nothing wrong with amen and you
[51:56] make you make the decision Amen to to
[52:00] believe Satan's lie and you begin to
[52:01] profess doubt and you make that decision
[52:04] freely freely really you do but you're a
[52:07] free moral agent brother Brown said the
[52:09] inside of your spirit is a soul and that
[52:11] is controlled by one thing your free
[52:13] will now he said you can accept what the
[52:16] devil says
[52:18] or or come on now you can accept what
[52:23] the devil says or you can't accept What
[52:28] God Says and that will determine what
[52:31] spirit is in you if it's the spirit of
[52:32] God it'll feed on the things of God it
[52:34] won't feed on anything of the world now
[52:36] now see so there's nothing wrong with
[52:37] God's system it's the way that we're
[52:39] using it or misusing it is that right
[52:42] amen when you understand the system you
[52:44] understand why it failed amen it failed
[52:47] when you chose to leave the word of God
[52:49] and believe Satan's lifee amen and give
[52:51] and give enough credit give enough Faith
[52:53] give enough agreement to what the
[52:55] devil's whispering in your ear that you
[52:57] begin to confess
[52:58] it amen and right there he gains the
[53:01] power now now how many have ever
[53:03] failed yeah it's all of us don't worry
[53:06] amen we fail we we make mistakes we fail
[53:10] as Christians we go through through
[53:12] seasons of failure amen and so so all of
[53:15] us are no we've all had experience of
[53:16] failure we're no stranger to failure but
[53:18] let me tell you something you did not
[53:20] fail for a lack of power it was not a
[53:24] lack of power that caused you to fail
[53:26] and amen there's enough power in you as
[53:28] a child of God brother Bram said you
[53:30] could create another world right now and
[53:31] go live on it amen that's the kind of
[53:34] power that's in you amen but it's
[53:36] controlled by law so it's not a lack of
[53:38] power it's not a lack of teaching amen
[53:41] your message believing children amen
[53:43] you're young people you've been raised
[53:45] in it you've been taught in it you heard
[53:46] preachers like the world has never seen
[53:48] preach this message and teach this
[53:50] message you're you're taught you have
[53:52] the understanding and I want to I want
[53:54] to tell you something just a just to
[53:56] shock you a little bit you didn't fail
[53:58] because of a lack of faith how could you
[54:00] say that brother Nathan it wasn't even a
[54:02] lack of faith it's where in your mind
[54:04] you decide to place your faith watch how
[54:07] the devil works now because he can't
[54:09] create his own system so he has to use
[54:11] what God did amen so what the devil does
[54:15] Amen is he'll come Waring on your mind
[54:17] he's bombarding you all the time with
[54:18] his thoughts and what he's trying to do
[54:20] amen is is he's trying to convince you
[54:23] that your faith is too small you don't
[54:25] have enough power you don't have enough
[54:27] understanding you're not old enough
[54:28] you're not big enough you're not strong
[54:30] enough you're not spiritual enough
[54:32] you're not enough amen and then as soon
[54:34] as you begin to believe that it g it
[54:36] gives him power to control the destiny
[54:39] of your life amen now listen it's not
[54:41] that you don't have faith amen because
[54:44] when the devil preaches his sermon you
[54:46] believe him amen take the same faith
[54:49] that you put in the devil's lies that's
[54:52] all the faith that you need when you put
[54:54] it in the word of God
[54:56] The Law of Confession will make it work
[54:58] in your life he what the devil's trying
[55:00] to do is hijack the faith that you got
[55:03] he's trying to tell you that you're not
[55:05] enough amen and then when you believe
[55:07] him he's jumping right on that power of
[55:09] faith and he's hijacking it and he's
[55:11] using it to mess up your
[55:13] life amen now it's a strange thing
[55:15] brother brandom said that's so much
[55:18] thought of people they say well I'm
[55:21] weak my faith is not very
[55:24] much I'm not a very good Christian
[55:28] anybody ever felt that
[55:29] way brother BR said that's just what the
[55:32] devil wants you to

[1:00:04] time with the devil as soon as you

[1:00:22] we get in a we get in an arguing match
[1:00:24] with de with the with the Devil we're
[1:00:26] always trying to reason everything out
[1:00:27] and prove you're trying to prove to the
[1:00:29] devil that you're a Christian amen
[1:00:31] you're trying to prove to that voice in
[1:00:32] your ear amen that you finally beond
[1:00:35] condemnation but that's the voice of the
[1:00:37] accuser and it is his job to accuse you
[1:00:40] it is his job to condemn you amen that's
[1:00:43] what he does Amen but you don't have to
[1:00:45] listen to him and you've got nothing to
[1:00:47] prove Christ proved it on Calvary amen
[1:00:50] he proved it on Resurrection morning
[1:00:52] amen all you got to do is make the
[1:00:54] profession of faith amen with the heart
[1:00:56] man believes with the mouth he's saved
[1:01:00] amen it's quite simple you know amen
[1:01:03] just stop trying to convince the devil
[1:01:05] amen that you're a
[1:01:07] Christian he already
[1:01:09] knows but he'll never admit it here's
[1:01:12] what it is brother Bram said you're a
[1:01:14] Christian because you believe that
[1:01:16] you're a
[1:01:17] Christian that's deeper than you think
[1:01:20] you're a Christian because you believe
[1:01:22] that you're a Christian and it's all
[1:01:24] settled cuz he's a high priest Prest
[1:01:26] what kind of high priest the high priest
[1:01:28] of your confession amen now notice he
[1:01:31] said he's the high priest of your
[1:01:32] confession what you confess you are
[1:01:35] that's what you are and any man will
[1:01:38] never live any farther or any higher
[1:01:42] than what he believes he's
[1:01:45] living Amen in other words the only way
[1:01:48] you'll reach that next step the only way
[1:01:50] to get to your Victory the only way who
[1:01:53] wants to come higher in Christ amen how
[1:01:55] many would like his sword a little
[1:01:56] higher amen the only way up there is by
[1:01:59] the law of Faith amen any man will never
[1:02:03] live any higher he'll never live any
[1:02:04] further than what he believes he's
[1:02:06] living and brother Ram said a man if
[1:02:08] he's a drunk all that he talks about is
[1:02:10] alcohol that's that you can't get him to
[1:02:12] shut up you can't get him to talk about
[1:02:13] anything else amen if he likes smoking
[1:02:15] if he likes drugs or whatever the man
[1:02:18] whatever he is amen that's what he talks
[1:02:20] about that's what's coming out of his
[1:02:22] mouth all the time that's his confession
[1:02:24] that's his identity amen amen but the
[1:02:27] same law for a Christian you're a
[1:02:29] Christian amen not CU you live a sinless
[1:02:31] Perfection amen not cuz you never made a
[1:02:34] mistake you're a Christian cuz you
[1:02:36] believe you're a Christian and you make
[1:02:38] a confession of faith and God gives the
[1:02:40] Holy Ghost to vindicate your profession
[1:02:42] he's your high priest amen it's Grace
[1:02:46] it's Amen it's it's Faith it's the Law
[1:02:48] of Confession you'll never get any
[1:02:50] higher in Christ than you are right now
[1:02:52] without a change to your
[1:02:54] confession hey amen and that's why I
[1:02:57] want to preach on change in the
[1:02:59] narrative amen because you find it you
[1:03:01] find that the narrative is all important
[1:03:04] in your life because everyone's sitting
[1:03:07] here if the Lord carries and we go on
[1:03:09] through time you're going to have good
[1:03:11] days and you're going to have bad gu bad
[1:03:13] days if you're a sinner or you're a
[1:03:15] saint you're going to have good days
[1:03:17] you're going to have bad days you're
[1:03:19] going to have victories you're going to
[1:03:20] have defeats you're going to have trials
[1:03:22] you're going to have tribulations there
[1:03:24] will be sicknesses there'll be struggles
[1:03:27] amen there will be all those kind of
[1:03:28] things amen and so what's really
[1:03:30] important amen is not all the things
[1:03:32] that happen to you but how you choose to
[1:03:35] interpret them and what filter you draw
[1:03:38] it through amen see it's the narrative
[1:03:40] that you put to the things of your life
[1:03:42] amen I try to figure out how to explain
[1:03:45] this now I talk about marriage I realize
[1:03:47] it's a youth meaning amen but we're all
[1:03:49] married to Christ and amen and and and
[1:03:52] I'm a married man and there's one thing
[1:03:54] that helps me in my marriage and that's
[1:03:56] a revelation by this message that my
[1:03:58] wife is an eternal mate to me in glory
[1:04:02] is it not some temporary setup amen this
[1:04:04] is something Eternal manifested in time
[1:04:07] amen and so so we came from somewhere
[1:04:10] and we're going to somewhere and there's
[1:04:12] a lot of stuff going to happen in the
[1:04:13] middle but it can't change the
[1:04:15] overarching truth amen because the
[1:04:17] narrative is we belong to one another
[1:04:20] the narrative is amen we're going to
[1:04:22] Glory together the narrative is amen
[1:04:24] we're spending etern together you see
[1:04:26] what I mean amen now in a marriage the
[1:04:28] worst thing that could happen to you is
[1:04:30] you stop believing that and you start
[1:04:32] getting in your mind well I married the
[1:04:33] wrong one and you know or or maybe she's
[1:04:36] not for me or maybe maybe we'll never
[1:04:38] work this out and when that begins to
[1:04:39] get into you amen because see you're
[1:04:41] supposed to be married happily ever
[1:04:43] after amen but see then the problem is
[1:04:45] you get a never in your
[1:04:47] ever amen well we're never GNA sort this
[1:04:50] out we're never GNA come to agree we're
[1:04:52] never gonna we're never going to learn
[1:04:54] how to get over we're never gonna we're
[1:04:55] never going to we're never going to
[1:04:57] we're never going to amen and when that
[1:04:59] becomes the narrative over a marriage
[1:05:01] over a life whatever it is now listen
[1:05:03] every fight that you have and you're
[1:05:05] going to have them amen then then then
[1:05:08] it becomes part of a of a
[1:05:10] narrative amen that you see the ship
[1:05:13] sinking it's falling apart we're headed
[1:05:15] for divorce right and then you could
[1:05:17] have a real good day and have a real
[1:05:18] romantic outing you know in a nice day
[1:05:20] and take a walk in the park or down on
[1:05:22] the beach amen and it's a it's a great
[1:05:25] day but the narrative is well that was
[1:05:28] just a good day but now we're back amen
[1:05:31] you see you see the narrative how you
[1:05:35] understand what I'm saying and it's the
[1:05:36] same in your marriage to Christ amen
[1:05:38] because you start going along and then
[1:05:40] the devil whatever he's doing everything
[1:05:42] he can to convince you you're not a
[1:05:43] child of God it's not meant to be you
[1:05:45] were never in his mind amen you don't
[1:05:47] deserve Grace you send away your day
[1:05:49] your grace and he's trying to get you to
[1:05:51] believe that amen cuz if he can get you
[1:05:53] to swallow that amen then he can put a
[1:05:55] Nar ative over your life and the truth
[1:05:57] becomes hey on the days that you do good
[1:06:00] that's just a good day amen but but see
[1:06:03] every mistake is saying aha you see you
[1:06:05] made another mistake amen you stumbled
[1:06:07] again you fell again amen and so it
[1:06:10] plays into the narrative that he's
[1:06:11] trying to put on you and say you're
[1:06:13] never going to make it amen but if you
[1:06:16] would accept the word of God as your
[1:06:19] narrative as your truth Oh Glory then
[1:06:22] you can have a bad day it's just a bad
[1:06:25] day
[1:06:27] but the story of your life is you're an
[1:06:29] overcomer you're an eternal seed amen
[1:06:32] you're a predestinated child of God
[1:06:35] you're going through you're going over
[1:06:36] you're going to make
[1:06:38] it it's the narrative amen but all the
[1:06:41] time you know all the time the devil can
[1:06:43] put one over on God's children on the
[1:06:45] road to EMAs there was a couple
[1:06:46] Believers walking they weren't they
[1:06:47] weren't Sinners they weren't unbelievers
[1:06:49] they were message Believers and they're
[1:06:51] walking and they're just miserable sad
[1:06:54] just down cast amen and so so caught up
[1:06:58] in in all the bad things going on they
[1:07:00] didn't even realize they were in the
[1:07:01] presence of Jesus Amen and Jesus begins
[1:07:04] to speak to them amen and he begins to
[1:07:06] explain them through the scriptures
[1:07:07] brother Bram said even the preaching of
[1:07:08] the word wasn't enough Amen to make them
[1:07:11] wake up because they had already
[1:07:12] accepted the devil's narrative that it
[1:07:14] was the worst day ever but it was the
[1:07:17] best day ever because Jesus wasn't
[1:07:21] dead and he wasn't in a tomb but there
[1:07:24] was an empty grave just down down the
[1:07:25] road and Jesus himself was walking in
[1:07:28] their presence oh oh friends if you
[1:07:30] could just if it when it's when we
[1:07:32] commune with him it's when he comes
[1:07:34] inside and he breaks the bread to you
[1:07:36] and reveals to you who you are amen it's
[1:07:39] not a bad day it's the greatest day
[1:07:41] that's ever
[1:07:43] been to be a b message believer these
[1:07:46] are Happy Days these are Glory Days it's
[1:07:49] Victory Day I know it's dark out there
[1:07:53] but we're Children of the light amen we
[1:07:55] got a different we got a different story
[1:07:57] we have a different narrative are you
[1:07:59] following me tonight amen see but s but
[1:08:03] Christians amen we we'll just accept
[1:08:05] Satan's truth and they get that's what
[1:08:07] keeps you in Cycles cycles of
[1:08:10] condemnation you know one of the
[1:08:12] greatest things that young people are
[1:08:14] battling today is
[1:08:16] condemnation condemnation see how how
[1:08:20] how the condemnation you know uh uh uh
[1:08:22] the the problem the the cruel thing
[1:08:23] about condemnation is you we struggle
[1:08:25] with a lot as young people amen but
[1:08:27] you'll struggle with something and it'll
[1:08:29] trip you up for a time but it's
[1:08:31] condemnation that keeps you down see
[1:08:33] it's condemnation plus the problem
[1:08:35] that's what's so cruel about it amen is
[1:08:38] that it's condemnation plus now a
[1:08:40] brother or a sister will have a struggle
[1:08:42] with lust or you struggle with Temper
[1:08:44] Temper or you struggle with h with with
[1:08:46] with some of these things amen then
[1:08:48] that'll trip you up but then it's
[1:08:49] condemnation that comes along and puts
[1:08:51] his foot on your neck he says now why
[1:08:53] don't you stay there a while and why
[1:08:55] don't you just grubble in the dirt for a
[1:08:56] week or a month or a year till you're
[1:08:59] ready to give up amen and he begins to
[1:09:01] try to tell you hey hey this ain't going
[1:09:03] to work out you're never going to have
[1:09:05] Victory you're just going to be in this
[1:09:06] cycle forever oh friends amen it but but
[1:09:10] see it's Satan's narrative and he wants
[1:09:13] you to accept
[1:09:14] that but you don't have to accept it
[1:09:17] amen you see and confess and and
[1:09:19] condemnation is such a religious devil
[1:09:22] those are the worst kind actually
[1:09:24] condemnation knows all all the
[1:09:26] scriptures condemnation knows the quotes
[1:09:28] he knows that one quote which just gets
[1:09:30] you right between the eyes amen and
[1:09:32] shreds your and and and and and it just
[1:09:34] tears your life apart and it's sending
[1:09:36] you to hell and he'll use that he'll
[1:09:38] just Hammer you with that day in and day
[1:09:40] out because it's a religious devil amen
[1:09:43] it's a religious devil it's a preaching
[1:09:44] Devil he's preaching you a sermon he's
[1:09:47] saying because of this amen because of
[1:09:49] this law amen because of this
[1:09:51] commandment because of this mistake
[1:09:53] because of this failure amen you have
[1:09:55] haven't got the goods you're never going
[1:09:56] to make it you're not going through amen
[1:09:59] but friends it's not the truth it's just
[1:10:01] religious but it's not the
[1:10:04] truth amen now see the thing about a
[1:10:06] narrative is you can base different
[1:10:07] narratives on the same facts that's the
[1:10:10] kind of world that we're living in is
[1:10:11] that you know uh something will happen
[1:10:13] and you go you go ask 10 different
[1:10:14] people around you get 10 different
[1:10:16] stories and 10 different takeaways or 11
[1:10:18] or 12 amen because because you could
[1:10:21] take the it's not just the the facts of
[1:10:23] the matter of what happened but it's the
[1:10:25] a spin amen and everybody's got a spin
[1:10:28] everybody's got an angle everybody's got
[1:10:30] something they're trying to twist it and
[1:10:31] put over on you and get you to believe
[1:10:33] it amen and the devil is the is the he's
[1:10:36] the Spin Master of all time that's why I
[1:10:39] say you don't argue with the devil you
[1:10:40] realize he you you're trying to reason
[1:10:42] with him and the Devil comes and he
[1:10:44] begins to explain to you how lost that
[1:10:46] you are he explains to you what a mess
[1:10:49] that you are he explains to you amen uh
[1:10:51] uhh uh just just how how condemned and
[1:10:54] how unworthy and how filthy that you are
[1:10:57] and he could do it in great detail amen
[1:10:59] and he's got evidence for it amen he can
[1:11:01] point at what you did this morning he
[1:11:03] can point at what you did yesterday he
[1:11:05] points at what you did last week amen
[1:11:07] and he can explain it and it's
[1:11:10] reasonable that's why it's called reason
[1:11:14] if you listen to a little message called
[1:11:15] wisdom versus Faith Amen brother Brandon
[1:11:17] will tell you that the devil is the
[1:11:19] father of
[1:11:20] reason he's a he he's he's a master of
[1:11:23] the debate amen he's he better at
[1:11:26] arguing than you are but you're not put
[1:11:29] here on Earth to argue with him you're
[1:11:30] put here to resist him you're put here
[1:11:33] to reject his lie you're predestinated
[1:11:35] to accept what he' turned
[1:11:38] down Hallelujah see the devil he doesn't
[1:11:41] come to you with fiction does he he
[1:11:42] comes to you with scripture he comes
[1:11:44] with you with quotes amen and he'll
[1:11:47] attack you with those things and he
[1:11:48] comes with a big long list of your sins
[1:11:50] he's trying to sell you a a narrative a
[1:11:53] story this is the story of your life and
[1:11:55] it's a story of failure it's a story of
[1:11:58] sin it's a story of unworthiness Amen
[1:12:02] but friends that's not your
[1:12:04] story that's not your story it's not the
[1:12:07] story of your life amen see see
[1:12:10] condemnation loves the scripture brother
[1:12:12] brandom Amen brother brandom got in
[1:12:14] trouble more than anything else for
[1:12:15] preaching Grace did you know that he was
[1:12:17] always in trouble for preaching
[1:12:19] predestination I know why he had to do
[1:12:20] it amen cuz I had to receive it the
[1:12:23] revelation of it amen but he was always
[1:12:25] getting in trouble and one time even his
[1:12:27] own church got on to him cuz brother
[1:12:28] Brandman made a statement while
[1:12:29] preaching that a man could live on this
[1:12:32] Earth Beyond
[1:12:33] sin wow and that really shook the
[1:12:36] legalists and if you go listen to
[1:12:38] questions and answers at that time
[1:12:40] there's like three different questions
[1:12:42] amen where they ask where where people
[1:12:43] come to brother brand with the same
[1:12:45] question they said brother brandom you
[1:12:47] said we got you now cuz you said that a
[1:12:51] man could live on earth and and a man
[1:12:53] could live so far into God as to without
[1:12:55] sin on Earth that was the exact quote
[1:12:58] amen and and they said but look at the
[1:13:02] Bible see how the devil works but what
[1:13:04] about the Bible cuz the Bible
[1:13:07] says amen if we say we have no sin we
[1:13:10] deceive ourselves that's from the book
[1:13:11] of First John amen if we say we have no
[1:13:14] sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
[1:13:16] is not in us so what are you going to do
[1:13:18] now brother brandom and they really got
[1:13:20] on to his case brother Bram said well
[1:13:22] let's turn there and he says now look
[1:13:25] across the
[1:13:27] page look across the page he said in my
[1:13:30] Bible it's the same page amen and he
[1:13:32] said look over here he said in 1 John
[1:13:36] chapter 3 whosoever is born of God doth
[1:13:39] not commit sin for his seed remaineth in
[1:13:44] him and he cannot sin for he is born of
[1:13:49] God friends if you let the devil run
[1:13:51] with this scripture he'll give you a
[1:13:53] thousand reasons why you can't be saved
[1:13:55] a thousand reasons why you'll never get
[1:13:56] the Holy Ghost amen but change the
[1:13:58] narrative oh if you just look across the
[1:14:01] page that's how you resist the devil the
[1:14:04] same way Jesus did cuz the devil will
[1:14:06] come with the scripture and he's trying
[1:14:07] to use the scripture to send you to Hell
[1:14:10] amen but Jesus said yes but it's also
[1:14:13] written it's also written yeah amen the
[1:14:16] Bible says I was born in sin I was
[1:14:19] shaped in in iniquity I came into the
[1:14:21] world speaking lies amen but it's also
[1:14:24] written
[1:14:26] you must be born again amen and
[1:14:29] whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[1:14:31] Lord shall be saved amen it's also
[1:14:34] written it's also written and when you
[1:14:37] read the word of God through through
[1:14:38] God's narrative amen then you begin to
[1:14:40] see grace everywhere that you look amen
[1:14:43] and the scriptures they used to condemn
[1:14:44] you amen now they are your Victory amen
[1:14:47] now they're your Liberty amen they don't
[1:14:49] scare you anymore oh friends why amen
[1:14:52] because you got to let God be be The
[1:14:55] Interpreter of his word and not your
[1:14:59] adversary
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:02] amen oh friends you look back brother BR
[1:15:05] said you look back and say I'm doing
[1:15:07] this and I'm doing that you're
[1:15:09] defeated you're defeated but there's no
[1:15:13] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:15:15] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:15:19] after the spirit and then you realize
[1:15:22] that you've overcome amen why cuz you're
[1:15:24] not not walking by this by by by this
[1:15:28] flesh and its weaknesses and its
[1:15:30] failures but the spirit of God is in you
[1:15:32] amen amen and it's projecting grace to
[1:15:35] you it's get there's leadership for you

[1:15:42] Mercy for you there's love there's care
[1:15:44] for you amen all these things not by the
[1:15:46] flesh but by the spirit amen but but how
[1:15:50] should we believe it except one preach
[1:15:52] amen don't let the devil be your pre
[1:15:55] preacher amen you said and as I said
[1:15:58] it's all reasonable cuz it's reason amen
[1:16:01] but brother BR said don't reason
[1:16:04] believe so there's a
[1:16:07] choice so there is a choice he said no
[1:16:10] matter what the circumstances don't pay
[1:16:12] no attention to
[1:16:14] circumstances believe whose report will
[1:16:17] you believe amen see there's so many
[1:16:20] young people and old people and people
[1:16:22] then you realize there's people amen
[1:16:24] that that have been in the message been

[1:16:55] make a mistake if I have a failure if I
[1:16:58] if I get caught in a trap amen how long

[1:17:02] how long do I have to carry the burden
[1:17:04] how long do I have to atone how long do

[1:17:12] discouraged until I'm paid for it not
[1:17:15] one moment not one moment past
[1:17:18] repentance amen do you have to carry
[1:17:20] sorrow amen Christ carried it to Calvary
[1:17:23] and he paid the ultimate price
[1:17:25] that you and I could walk this journey
[1:17:27] upright without the weight on your
[1:17:29] shoulder oh friends amen don't carry it
[1:17:32] one moment further don't carry that
[1:17:34] condemnation out of this meeting change
[1:17:37] the narrative look across the page amen
[1:17:40] accept the grace of God Amen believe the
[1:17:42] report believe it I can preach it but
[1:17:45] you got to believe it and say Lord I
[1:17:47] accept Grace I accept Mercy I accept
[1:17:50] Freedom Lord I'll lay it down no wonder
[1:17:53] you can't you can't Carry On The Journey
[1:17:56] no wonder you're always down in a ditch
[1:17:57] throwing a pity party you can't stay on
[1:18:00] the path of Duty because of all that
[1:18:02] weight
[1:18:04] amen amen now we believe in conviction
[1:18:06] for Christians but not
[1:18:09] condemnation amen conviction amen Paul
[1:18:12] said I don't have time to teach on it
[1:18:13] tonight but it's there's sorrow after a
[1:18:15] Godly sort amen and godly sorrow will
[1:18:18] make you repent and then repentance amen
[1:18:21] takes you into a forgiveness not to be
[1:18:23] repented in other words stop
[1:18:25] apologizing stop dragging your face in
[1:18:27] the dirt amen lift up your head and walk
[1:18:30] forward amen
[1:18:32] Justified forgiven what a merciful god
[1:18:37] amen oh my that fatigue of carrying a
[1:18:41] burden amen see we overcome not just by
[1:18:44] the blood of the Lamb how many believe
[1:18:46] the blood of Christ paid the price for
[1:18:49] everything that we have need of amen
[1:18:52] amen now you believe that you go to a
[1:18:54] church that preaches that but many times
[1:18:57] we fail to overcome why because we
[1:18:59] overcome not just by the blood of the
[1:19:00] lamb but by the word amen of brother
[1:19:04] Donnie's testimony no that's not what it
[1:19:07] said amen and we thank God for your
[1:19:09] testimony brother Donnie amen but it's
[1:19:11] the word of your testimony amen when it
[1:19:13] comes into contact with the blood of God
[1:19:16] Amen when those two omnipotence meet
[1:19:18] amen when an omnipotent God meets
[1:19:20] omnipotent faith that he planted in the
[1:19:22] heart of his children amen then great
[1:19:24] explosive things are going to happen
[1:19:26] amen and the devil can't resist it
[1:19:28] anymore cuz all the power the devil has
[1:19:31] over you is based on a lie and when you
[1:19:33] reject his lie and give the Reigns back
[1:19:36] to God Amen then you can't fail to
[1:19:42] overcome Hallelujah resist the devil
[1:19:44] it's not what's going into your mouth
[1:19:46] that's defiling you it's Jesus said it's
[1:19:48] what's coming out amen it's that rotten
[1:19:51] confession it's that old tradition it's
[1:19:53] the narrative
[1:19:55] amen that you accept don't just say Amen
[1:19:58] it's not what you're taking in that's
[1:19:59] killing your Victory it's what you're
[1:20:01] putting out amen but don't just take
[1:20:04] what the devil tells you oh amen you've
[1:20:06] got a right to choose the word you say
[1:20:09] brother Nathan but my mistakes brother
[1:20:11] bam said this is one of my favorite
[1:20:13] quotes amen and truly amen what I'm
[1:20:16] preaching you tonight the reason that
[1:20:17] I'm preaching you is because I
[1:20:19] personally have sat in your shoes as a
[1:20:20] young person amen and these were the
[1:20:22] keys to overcoming in my life was to
[1:20:25] recognize the Law of Confession and
[1:20:27] every time amen I came into trouble amen
[1:20:30] I didn't throw in the towel and start
[1:20:31] over at Square One amen but I would go
[1:20:33] forth in the grace of God Amen The Law
[1:20:36] of Confession amen is what will give you
[1:20:38] power to continue on the journey I'm a
[1:20:41] witness tonight and here's the key to it
[1:20:43] brother Bram said in the message Oneness
[1:20:45] we know we make mistakes that's right
[1:20:48] but you mustn't look at
[1:20:51] that you mustn't look at that it's not
[1:20:54] your mistakes cuz you're always going to
[1:20:57] have
[1:20:58] them news flash ring the bell you're
[1:21:01] always going to have mistakes as long as
[1:21:04] you're in this sinful body amen but
[1:21:07] stumbling and falling doesn't have one
[1:21:10] thing to do with it a real true servant
[1:21:12] if he'll stumble he'll get up again amen
[1:21:16] oh if he's off the path of Duty God's
[1:21:18] not obligated to him but as long as he's
[1:21:21] in the path of Duty God's obligated to
[1:21:24] him and then he says these beautiful
[1:21:26] words knowing he's just a man or a woman
[1:21:29] you say brother Nathan I'm just a boy
[1:21:31] I'm just a girl amen I I'm only so much
[1:21:34] I have so little he knows that he knows
[1:21:38] that amen so don't look at that don't
[1:21:41] look at mistakes don't look at stumbling
[1:21:43] if you ever fall down amen just don't
[1:21:45] quit get back up amen lay aside every
[1:21:48] weight of condemnation and stay in the
[1:21:51] path of Duty and keep pressing on and
[1:21:53] the power of God is obligated to take
[1:21:55] you where you're
[1:21:57] going amen when you begin to take you
[1:22:00] begin to operate that confession say
[1:22:03] Amen that was a that was a that was a
[1:22:05] big
[1:22:06] hill that was a deep
[1:22:08] valley that was a hard climb amen that
[1:22:12] was a difficult struggle that was a
[1:22:14] battle I fell in a pit amen I I I I was
[1:22:17] in snared in a trap but I'm not going to
[1:22:19] quit I'm not going to stop amen the
[1:22:22] devil will never convince me that I
[1:22:24] can't make it amen because God said I
[1:22:26] would make it God gave me the Road mapap
[1:22:29] God gave me the key he gave me the
[1:22:32] power he predestinated me to make
[1:22:35] it and as long as you can carry that
[1:22:38] positive confession you can
[1:22:40] overcome you can overcome oh friends God
[1:22:45] understands your Humanity but thank God
[1:22:46] he made you a path so get out of your
[1:22:49] ditch tonight get out of your ditch oh
[1:22:53] brother brand would talk about brother
[1:22:54] Wayne's been preaching at home at water
[1:22:56] from the at that water from the Rock and
[1:22:58] brother brand speaks about it how God he
[1:23:00] says oh how God wants to bless his
[1:23:02] church amen he he said uh but we're so
[1:23:05] carnal-minded how quick they forgot the
[1:23:09] Miracles amen when a when a new thing
[1:23:12] arose can you relate to that oh he said
[1:23:15] we have a meeting and the power of God
[1:23:16] will fail will fall and great signs and
[1:23:19] wonders will take place sounds like a
[1:23:20] youth camp amen and then Satan comes
[1:23:22] along and he can smack something over on
[1:23:24] you and you forget that that's the god
[1:23:26] of Heaven that was making you shout amen
[1:23:29] the god of Heaven making you praise the
[1:23:31] Lord you forget the god of Heaven that
[1:23:33] snatched you out like a fire brand you
[1:23:34] forget the god of Heaven who dug you
[1:23:36] from the pits from the rock where you
[1:23:38] were dug from he said it's easy to
[1:23:40] forget him but let me tell you brother
[1:23:43] what we need tonight is a man with an
[1:23:45] iron conscience that'll stand there in
[1:23:48] the power of the Holy Ghost no matter
[1:23:50] what comes or goes he'll be waving the
[1:23:52] flag of Victory going on to the the
[1:23:54] promised land that's what we need in the
[1:23:56] in the in the church amen is men and
[1:23:59] women and boys and girls with an iron
[1:24:01] conscience that no matter how it looks
[1:24:04] no matter how strong the adversary amen
[1:24:07] you don't give you don't budge you don't
[1:24:09] bend amen you say no I'm going through
[1:24:12] that's what we need we need another
[1:24:14] Caleb amen Caleb I kind of think that
[1:24:16] Caleb the way he was he was kind of a
[1:24:17] man a few words more of a man of action
[1:24:20] didn't do a lot of talking when he did
[1:24:22] do the talking basically what he was
[1:24:24] saying was Moses is Right Joshua's right
[1:24:27] we can do it that was his message amen
[1:24:31] that that's what that's where that's
[1:24:33] where his life was anchored that's what
[1:24:35] that's the the role that he played
[1:24:37] Joshua was the great leader Caleb which
[1:24:39] is your type amen all that he had to do
[1:24:42] was I agree with Joshua now it was 10 to
[1:24:46] one amen Joshua's message was very much
[1:24:49] in the minority but there was one with
[1:24:51] an iron conscience somebody say no
[1:24:54] matter how it looks no matter how big
[1:24:56] the Giants are no matter how hard the
[1:24:58] fight is going to be amen the prophet
[1:25:00] said amen we could take the land so I'm
[1:25:03] with Joshua amen and I'm going in and
[1:25:06] I'm going to defeat every devil I'm
[1:25:08] going to possess Every Mountain I'm
[1:25:10] going to make it through every Valley
[1:25:12] and I'm going to drink amen the the milk
[1:25:15] and eat the honey of the
[1:25:17] land and iron conscience see now see now
[1:25:20] all these other spies are talking amen I
[1:25:23] wish I had time to preach on desiners
[1:25:25] tonight but all these other spies are
[1:25:27] talking and you know what they were
[1:25:28] making a lot of sense oh yeah because
[1:25:30] there was Giants in the land and there
[1:25:33] were and there were great strong
[1:25:34] strongholds and fortresses and it was
[1:25:36] going to be a difficult task and they
[1:25:39] were making a lot of sense but see God
[1:25:41] had already sent a prophet Amen to set
[1:25:44] the narrative for the children of Israel
[1:25:46] from that time forward amen that no
[1:25:48] matter who's in your way no matter what
[1:25:50] you go through amen no no matter now no
[1:25:52] matter if an achen comes along and a
[1:25:54] besetting sin and amen and you get into
[1:25:57] a season of defeat no matter what comes
[1:25:59] no matter what goes it belongs to
[1:26:02] you it is your destiny it is your
[1:26:05] inheritance it belongs to you oh friends
[1:26:09] amen see Joshua they were making a lot
[1:26:11] of sense because they're talking about
[1:26:13] circumstances but Caleb and Joshua
[1:26:15] weren't looking at circumstances they
[1:26:18] were looking at a promise and if I could
[1:26:20] convince you tonight amen to stop
[1:26:22] looking at your circumstances to stop
[1:26:24] looking at the evidences to stop letting
[1:26:26] the devil preach to you amen but look at
[1:26:30] the promises of God for your life amen
[1:26:33] and then it would change you like it
[1:26:34] changed me amen and victory come for you
[1:26:38] like it did for me but the church is
[1:26:40] always looking back brother Braham said
[1:26:42] but let's look up he said because their
[1:26:44] powers are limited and we have unlimited
[1:26:48] power amen a few I need a few more
[1:26:50] minutes stay with me now amen uh for All
[1:26:53] Things Are possible to them that believe
[1:26:55] in God brother bam said real genuine
[1:26:57] faith will punctuate every word of God
[1:26:59] with an amen amen that's what real
[1:27:02] genuine Faith does it's just waiting for
[1:27:04] you to quote the word of God and when
[1:27:06] you do there's going to be an
[1:27:08] amen there's going to be an amen I need
[1:27:10] your amens tonight for a few more
[1:27:12] minutes amen because amen now now not
[1:27:15] take the word and say well that was for
[1:27:16] another generation no he's the same
[1:27:18] yesterday today and forever amen you see
[1:27:23] the more that you can employ the power
[1:27:25] of the tongue amen and invest it in the
[1:27:27] word of God the more it yields benefits
[1:27:29] for you that's why I believe in Amen in
[1:27:30] the word you preach a lot of places and
[1:27:32] everybody say oh just if you just quiet
[1:27:35] down stop shouting so much and stop it
[1:27:38] reminds me of uh brother Daryl and I
[1:27:40] were were fellowshipping the other day
[1:27:42] about brother brother Brandon would use
[1:27:44] the word pen knifing the word pen
[1:27:46] knifing you know what a pen knife is
[1:27:48] it's a little pocket knife like a
[1:27:49] whittling knife and and remember when
[1:27:51] brother brandom healed the blind girl
[1:27:54] remember it was a great crowded meeting
[1:27:56] and he runs into this girl amen and she
[1:27:58] ends up being healed of her blindness
[1:28:00] just before he met that girl amen he met
[1:28:02] a man and a man it was a big strong bird
[1:28:06] looking guy with his arms crossed and he
[1:28:08] was sitting there with a with a pen
[1:28:09] knife whittling on a stick brother
[1:28:12] brandom's trying to get somewhere amen
[1:28:14] and the messenger the prophet runs into
[1:28:16] him amen he bounces off and he looks at
[1:28:18] the guy and the guy says stop
[1:28:20] pushing and he sits there pen knifing
[1:28:23] pen knifing pen knife and that's how a
[1:28:25] lot of people treat the preaching of the
[1:28:27] word it's how a lot of people treat the
[1:28:29] message they treat the word when it
[1:28:31] comes amen it comes and say well quit
[1:28:33] quit quit pushing we're having pizza in
[1:28:35] 15 minutes amen quit pushing yeah yeah
[1:28:37] that's that's we don't believe in all
[1:28:39] that emotional stuff quit pre just quit
[1:28:42] pushing amen and you're always talking

[1:46:46] God that message spoke of a
[1:46:50] bride Lord who would be here and she
[1:46:53] would be alive and she would remain to
[1:46:55] the coming of the Lord and Lord we've
[1:46:58] seen Generations rise Generations
[1:47:02] fall Lord we've seen many an old
[1:47:06] fighter end up in the ditch

[1:47:11] complaining there's been a lot of water
[1:47:13] under the bridge there's been a lot of
[1:47:16] old history but I'm standing here
[1:47:18] tonight before a new generation
[1:47:21] Lord and with all the passion of my
[1:47:23] heart I'm asking

[1:47:31] now and Quicken a revelation in every
[1:47:34] heart
[1:47:35] Lord Lord
[1:47:37] those Lord that are full of the Holy
[1:47:40] Ghost under the sound of my voice Lord
[1:47:43] let them realize the potential that's in
[1:47:45] them Father that they would strive Lord
[1:47:48] to rise up higher than the place that
[1:47:50] they're in Lord those that are not yet
[1:47:51] quickened Lord
[1:47:53] I pray Lord that you would awaken a
[1:47:54] thirst in those hearts Lord that they

[1:53:18] prais amen did you enjoy that tonight
[1:53:22] that was wonderful I was thinking while
[1:53:24] brother Nathan was was preaching there
[1:53:25] about the law of God's power you know
[1:53:28] and I remember a quote where brother
[1:53:29] Bram is talking about God creating the
[1:53:32] universe and he's talking about how how
[1:53:34] many hundreds of millions of light years
[1:53:36] to the end of the solar system and then
[1:53:38] he said so many million light years on
[1:53:40] the other side of that further on how
[1:53:43] God created that with one breath one
[1:53:46] word and he said that same power yes
[1:53:50] when God said let there be
[1:53:53] is in
[1:53:55] you so when you come in here with that
[1:53:58] power and you sit down beside somebody
[1:54:00] with that same power and somebody walks
[1:54:03] in with the same power and sits beside
[1:54:05] you and so on and you feel this place
[1:54:08] with that power it does the exact same
[1:54:10] thing that it did when God said let
[1:54:13] there be it
[1:54:16] creates and so often we we can't push
[1:54:18] through you know brother brandham I
[1:54:20] always love to hear brother brandham
[1:54:21] said that I died with him I was buried
[1:54:24] with him and I rose with him the same
[1:54:26] power that brought Christ out of the
[1:54:28] Grave lives in you and I always like to
[1:54:31] think that whenever he kicked the doors
[1:54:32] of Halen I was with him so you don't no
[1:54:35] longer have to go try to kick the doors
[1:54:37] of Halen that's already done you just
[1:54:40] have to remind him the power you know if
[1:54:43] you realize when he was talking about
[1:54:45] the law of the power and it's a
[1:54:46] revelation when you get a revelation of
[1:54:48] that things in your life will change the
[1:54:51] power that you have over the enemy will
[1:54:54] change you don't have to go home and and
[1:54:55] sit down on your bed and write in your
[1:54:57] diary how depressed you were that day
[1:55:00] you don't you you don't have to no
[1:55:01] longer that day you can not never again
[1:55:04] pick up that besetting sin that has
[1:55:06] bothered you for years when you get a
[1:55:08] revelation of the power that's in
[1:55:10] you it's God living in us it's God I I
[1:55:13] love that so much that's you know hey
