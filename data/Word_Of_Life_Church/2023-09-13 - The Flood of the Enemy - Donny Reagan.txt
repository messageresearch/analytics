[Music] [Applause] [Music] this is when everybody knows so you help me out me and Karen's been moving I think we're going to survive it she ain't killed me yet but in moving I was going through some stuff and I found the message brother Donnie preached and 83 it's the first message when he introduced a message at our Pentecostal Church in Kentucky and I listened to it yesterday driving to Kentucky but I just brought back so many memories of where the Lord's brought us from how the Lord brought us along the road just so glad he that he's that he loves me spirit in the bride will sing Come elected inside their heart are you not in time soon we'll be with our Lord forevermore has come the pride is making preparation we're hearing the shout of our King the tokens been applied he's cleaning from inside and the dove leads a lamb once again a Finland and clean why is gratitude she's been washed in the blood of God's own son when the righteousness that's not our own we'll stand just before his throne where we'll reign with our Lord forever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Kings the tokens been applied he's cleaning from inside and the dove leads to lamb once again upon she's been washed in the blood of God's own son with the righteousness that's not my own I'll be just before his throne where we reign with our Lord forevermore [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Laughter] foreign [Applause] I may believe the dove is leading the lamb once again I'm so glad I can be led you know one thing I've found sometimes with preachers is that sometimes when a man thinks that he's called to preach and many times genuinely they are but a lot of times preachers tend to get to a place to where they feel like now that they're a preacher special pastors that they are no longer a sheep which means they can't really take advice from anybody else so if they're a Shepherd that can't be a sheep but what I find amazing about that is that the Bible calls Jesus our great Chief Shepherd but it also causing the Lamb of God so he was both Shepherd and she why he could be led you see a real leader can be led a real leader can be influenced by contemporaries it's only a man that really don't know who he is that feels intimidated a preacher to take any advice from anyone else I hope and pray to God I never get like that I hope you don't either or brother Donnie when do you start stop taking advice I figure when I'm in a box or when I'm changed anybody else I've been Pastor now for over 40 years how he found the tape of where I'd introduced the message down at the church in Kentucky March the 27th 1983. so I've been pastoring for over 40 years been preaching longer than that but you know what I find I learned something new every day some of y'all all my land I know I'm not like some of you all I'm not brilliant and marvelous and wonderful and I hope I never get that way I hope I can always be taught always be instructed amen always find room to grow in God Amen don't you Mitchell don't you look man amen God bless you let's turn to the book of Isaiah tonight I forgot to ask you all everybody doing well yeah yeah well you was before I started talking anyway oh my goodness Isaiah 59 15. let me come to not the needs in your life need to hear from Heaven me too all I believe we're going to Isaiah 59 15. I want to speak to you tonight on the flood of the enemy the flood of the enemy Isaiah 59 15. yay truce faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey it's a very strange time that God is speaking this to the people of Israel and the Lord saw it so truce was failing truth was collapsing and then a man that would depart from Evil he was making himself a prey so in other words whenever a man would depart from Evil it's like things turned against him and he was worse seemingly that what he was before he ever turned to God that can be a very confusing time and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate an an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for closing and was clad with zeal as a cloak now remember of course this is a Messianic prophecy but it was also a prophecy for this time in Isaiah's visit on the Earth according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he shall repay recompense now listen to verse 19. so shall thy fear the name of the Lord from the list from the West and His glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the ruach of the Lord ruach of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him I may believe that to be the truth tonight and he has a need in your life your home I stopped to pick up the Parker girls for church tonight and Lance wanted me to mention to you that Erica for the last few days has had an intensifying of pain in her body and I know that you all pray for her I get texts and emails and phone calls and things like that from from you saying that you pray for every day sometimes multiple times during the day and how we appreciate you doing that but sometimes you need a little update of where things are so they wanted me to mention to you tonight that she's on a pain patch and she's having actually having breakthroughs of that pain patch and having to take more pain meds by pill and we don't consider this a loss of ground we don't consider this not a sign of victory as a matter of fact we're looking at it that it's a sign of a scared devil amen and he hates to be exposed don't he but for the last few days she's really had a lot of pain Caroline had to go down last night about 9 30 or so and was there for quite a while praying and praying and the presence of God certainly came in a mighty way in a mighty way and the Holy Ghost well let me just say the Holy Ghost made a great visit with his presence I wish all of you could have been there to sense the presence of God but they wanted me to ask you tonight if you would remember him and I know you will we have lots of other folks that are sick and we want to remember them as well so just just raise your hand your needs whatever it is there to signify and I know you're saying oh my goodness brother Donnie my need is so little compared to hers and it's so little but look friends he didn't just come to pay for Erica's healing he didn't just come for the great big things maybe you've got a headache tonight that's just as important to Jesus maybe you've got a toothache maybe your feet are bothering you or something if I I don't even want to ask him after all of that why he's got plenty of healing left to cover the big things the little things so let's just bring all of our needs to it Heavenly Father we count it such a great honor that we could be in your presence once again Lord Jesus I believe that you're mindful of every need of every person in this building so whether their need would be great or whether it not be considered small Lord God we want to bring them all before you we're grateful that you suffered for desperate things and cancer is certainly a serious thing but Lord Jesus not only did you pay the price for that but you paid it for somebody's feet hurting and sore like mine are tonight mine's so small compared to Erica's and maybe others but I need to touch Lord I'm sure there's others here tonight and they say Lord I I don't even want to mention mine but we need to because your power is so great and you're concerned about the small needs the medium size the large the extra large so father we're praying tonight in the name of Jesus that should come by our way visit us tonight Lord father you see this need in Erica's body and I know when I speak it tonight it will be around the world by in the morning and that's good because the kingdom of hell is going to be bombarded against and the Throne of God is going to be Hallelujah I told her the other day honey I said you're so loved I said there's not a president a prime minister a potentate there's not a King around the world who has their name mentioned Before the Throne of God as much as you do and we're grateful for every one of them Lord we thank you Father we're just asking you that should move for her Lord we believe that dear God In The Name of Jesus may this be the night that the angel of God will pass by her way Lord and bring complete deliverance speak to us from your word father in the name of Jesus we pray and the Saints said amen amen God bless you Saints you may be seated I don't know if you know it or not but the year 2023 has been a year of great floods naturally now let me just speak to you along the natural line for a few moments Europe has had catastrophic floods parts of Africa has had catastrophic floods Nevada last week had a flood thousands of people were held there at a festival flooded they could not get in or out roads were blocked and people were paranoid of course Libya the country of Libya which most of you know where it's at Northern Africa Libya was hit by a flood this weekend and I saw it just this afternoon that their estimating from what they've seen so far the devastation the lives that have been lost the lives that cannot be accounted for probably 20 000 people dead Italy just had a catastrophic flood all these floods taking place all over the world I believe and I'm sure that you believe with me that many times the natural things that we see are signs that have a spiritual anatype that connects together with it the signs and the heavens declare his majesty they can also declare judgment on the Earth and as we can see great floods that are bringing Devastation and judgment to the Earth the enemy also has an answer to this in the spiritual sense a flood can come from a a a a deluge which will fall within a short period of time actually right now the hurricane in the Atlantic they're keeping an eye on it it's sped up slowed down sped up again slow down now taking a northern course the tropical system of course moving up to the Atlantic and the high pressure system holding over the Eastern Seaboard has not allowed it to go South toward South Carolina Georgia and so on so it seems that it will take a more northernly route maybe up to Virginia Maine Eastern part of Canada still looking at it the radar the computer generating the images as they called it the spaghetti images because the images will intertwine and it will come across so they're giving preliminary warnings that parts of the Northeast might get five to seven inches of rain and a period of 12 to 24 hours well our drainage systems are not made to take such rain the uh depending on the Earth itself how much rains that they've received so floods we understand can come like that that it can be a catastrophic amount of rain that can fall in a short period of time parts of China in the last month have been inundated with one flood after another eye to another buildings washed away great things in Saudi Arabia also in Israel and Saudi Arabia in Dubai some of their great great major cities the heavens opened up and Deluge of rain coming down but we also know that floods can come from moderate rain that will come one day and another and another and another not catastrophic not Deluge proportion but just a steady rain can happen on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and people will look at it and they don't get all upset because the weather people have not warned them that we're going to have a deluge everybody watch out for flooding but it just seems it's normal rain in Carter County or it's normal rain in Washington or Sullivan County and then on the fourth day we get this alert of the flood and we think well where did that come from it come from Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and by Thursday the round is saturated the rivers are at their Peak and all of a sudden we get this warning of a flood I mean notice what I'm talking about and yet we've also had them to where that it would be a deluge of rain and it would come a heavy downpour and all of a sudden we get this on our phones or our computers or whatever more and it will warn us so it can come in a variety of ways and I find myself that life can be that way that the flood or the onslaught of the enemy it can be something so spiritually catastrophic that it hits you and nearly takes you off your feet it was something that just happened you were not prepared for it you were not forewarned and it's just something that hits you all of a sudden it's there and you're saying oh my goodness how did this happen but then other times it will be one thing I've turned another after another after another and your ground around you becomes so saturated with one family issue after another family issue after another family issue with a financial issue and that a church family issue and before you know it your banks are flooded and your ground is saturated with water and you're trying to figure out where in the world am I how many has ever been there you see those are the type that can be really more dangerous now for those of you that have traveled out west in the desert Southwest and you've been in Arizona maybe Nevada Utah some of those places and you go across a wash now for those that's been there and lived there and those of you that envisage you know what I'm talking about and there will be a sign there and if the sign will say do not enter when 4 flooded and you're looking at that sign and you're thinking you got to be kidding me I'm an idiot ring you're in 45 years and it's as dry as it can be what are they talking about flooding but that sign is there as a warning because in that desert Southwest in many of those places there's not trees like we have back here in the East so the water will run off the mountains and the rocks and the sand and it will accumulate and it can be a little bitty tiny spring or to look like and whenever you go across it and that Deluge of water can come across whenever you get in the middle of it and that next thing you know you find yourself about halfway down Dead Man's wash and you wonder why they call it dead man's wash your fatality number 3837 because you did not pay attention to that little bitty sign do not enter when flooded so you sought your Cadillac or your big large SUV would be powerful enough to take you across that and that's the way life can be sometimes that we will find ourselves in that spot and God anoint the pasture or the Fist and minister to preach about such things and we say well I'm not really there so apparently that don't apply to me but God was warning you tonight because your wash is going to be full tomorrow so you see the Lord is always merciful how many knows that he is and he gives us a heads up many times if we will listen and sometimes it's during that to when we become so overwhelmed with the floods of life now whether it comes by an instant Deluge or it's just one moderate Reign after another eye to another and day five finally gets here and that is the final time when that moderate rainfall is going to push your little creek out of its banks and and you find yourself totally overwhelmed and you're wondering what in the world is going on you see Satan has so many things to be able to flood our lives with now whenever we look at us as individuals and we also parallel of course the Church of the Living God and Satan loves to sin so many different types of floods and he does them in the same pattern sometimes it's in moderate days of rain and in sometimes it'll be an instant Deluge he loves to sin that the moderate Reigns of error he will send just a little bit of a moderate thing of error and it'll be one error eye to another and Satan will talk you into doing something wrong say or receiving just a little something that's a little bit off the beaten path and you don't think it's that bad and then another thing that's you know just a little bit of a compromise and you know that it's not quite right well well you know it sounds so so bad but you take one day after another day after another day and before long you've got several accumulations of several days of moderate era five moderate days of error can equal one Deluge of a false doctrine that you would never walk into one at a time but five small ones you swallow them down because they're so moderate and they don't seem to really take that much away from what you believe anybody hear me tonight and you see Satan wants to do this to us as individuals and he also wants to do that to the church he also wants to do that to a move of God and he will come in and most of the time it will be so mild and so moderate not to raise any attention not to raise any red flags but something that will not scare most people something that will not make them leery you see that's one thing that makes a pastor different than sheep because a passion to do you good sometimes to do a study on it how brother Brown talks about the Shepherds how leery that they are and how watchful that they are and if she is so easily deceived it never ceases to amaze me how she are so gullible and they will swallow down things that are so vulnerable that is just contrary to the word as it can be and yet a Shepherd if it's a real God called Shepherd hear one little thing and a red flag goes up and a sheep will swallow right down and might don't even make them burp it don't even make them Belch and they say wow that was some good eating right there and they don't realize they just accepted a little bit of error in moderation so you see now it would be very easy for us since we're in a nice new place here and we're getting visitors all the time coming in it would be very easy for us if we're not careful for the preachers the pastor and you folks as laity just think you know what maybe we need to kind of back off a little bit of preaching what we normally preach at the other place and just kind of round off the corner somewhat and let's not preach on wholeness because we're getting folks in here that are dressed and not in the way that we dress you know I mean I see them just like you do and we're getting people in here that are not familiar with the message so maybe brother Donny you should stop reading quotes forget it you think I'm gonna do that no way ain't no way no not this preacher well maybe we should just kind of to back off and let's not preach election for a while and let's not preach hold on listen let's not preach about women cutting her hair and wine slacks and things like that and the next thing you know what else would we do in moderation well we're not going to do it because we've got a bunch of visitors well apparently they're searching for something or they wouldn't be here so it could be the very thing that we're not preaching that they're looking for and we don't preach it and then we're to blame well come on somebody so all it takes is a little bit of moderation on one weekend and then a little bit of moderation on the next weekend and we cut a corner here and we cut a Corners there and then before long you look out on your congregation and you've got people sitting there that don't look nothing like they did a year ago because a preacher no longer preaches against him because we got folks coming to church with our eyes painted and this and that and the other and then some of our young sister said well apparently brother Donnie don't think that's wrong anymore because he's not preaching that it's wrong oh but I still believe it's wrong and that's why I'm still going to preach against it you see but mother God he wanted to make some of a man well if it makes him mad I'll tell you one thing if they're a seed to God they may get mad but they'll come right back that's the way some of you all done that's the way I done when I first started hearing this message I didn't just swallow it down Hook Line and Sinker I tried it some other scruffle my feathers some of it made me angry some of it bothered me but you see where I'm at tonight don't you I've been preaching it for over 40 years and I believe it now more than I did when I introduced it over 40 years ago anybody with me so you see Satan loves to bring in well that's by moderation or by Deluge he wants to bring a flip he will try to turn the Simplicity of the Gospel in the heart Church of the people away from the fundamental foundational faith of what we believe in this last day you see having been in Pentecost and saw signs wonders Miracles and just let me let you know this tonight I have not just started having miracles in my Ministry in the last six months I have had Miracles my entire Ministry I have miracles in Pentecost I had Miracles when I come out of Pentecost I have never stopped having Miracles healing Supernatural phenomenal I just don't go around telling everybody about them but I have always had them in my Ministry and that's why I know just because you have Miracles don't mean you're going to have wind up having rapturing faiths get out a little bit and you'll find out that there's Miracles taking place in charismatic churches there are Miracles taking place in Baptist Churches I just told you of an instance the other I have a bad this woman sitting there and Erica's room and once Lance mentioned about praying about something that woman spoke of and said oh honey we believe God can do it we believe in miracles because we have seen many of them adopt this that it tends her local Baptist Church right here in Johnson City Oh you mean they're seeing Miracles yeah you see God will perform miracles for anybody that will believe he'll do it well come on now Church well brother Donnie that must mean God's approves no it means God loves Humanity people think because somebody got saved in a certain church that means that God approves of that church no no actually it don't mean that at all I've heard of people getting saved in a bar room so that don't mean God approves of the borrower but what it means is they were under conviction and God wanted them so bad God said move the liquor I'm coming in well that's how much he loves Humanity God will save him in a bar room he'll save them in a barn he'll save him in a honky tonk Billy Andrews was sitting at a bar room he told me this himself sitting right there at a bar stool with a drink in his hand of the spirit of God spoke to him and said this is your life's chance you imagine so now with alcohol in your hand and God got a hold of him and God was able to deal with him did that mean God Vindicated my room that meant God had a predestinated sea and he had to scare the liver out of it to get his attention well come on somebody God will heal the sick and the Baptist Church if they'll believe it God will heal the sick of the Church of Christ boy that would be a miracle wouldn't it God would heal the sick I'll tell you what God would heal it in a Methodist Church God would heal it a Catholic Church while my goodness friends the Catholics are having Miracles come on that don't mean that they're having a bride Revival all right now you see what Satan will want to do if he can't do this by error then he will try to come in and bring in a flood of persecution and again it may come in moderation or it may come into Deluge but he tries all these different things in order to try to do what to get our attention diverted away from what our Lord is doing you see he will come to try to corrupt our hearts our minds our souls from what we're called to do and if it can't go from one way he will do it another way he will try to come he studies our worship he studies the worship of the message people you don't have to study too much for some because they don't worship not evil studies of those who do worship and he will try to get inside that worship and he will either try to calm them down or he will try to push them on the other side of the ditch and get them to thinking that if you don't run jump shout holler speak in tongues knock over accused every night you ain't had church now you're going back to 1906 or later see you well come on somebody don't get quiet on me oh brother Donnie now brother branham's that danced on the floor and how many knows how many times brother Branham did that anybody know you know Carol anybody else would you like to know here you go one time wow so does that mean after that one time he was back sit because it didn't dance again but you see when we go to making it all this is what you've got to do this is the bride move well I've got a problem with that since brother Branham didn't do it ever serviced himself that we're gonna make that the evidence if we're not careful we're going to lay brother Brown I'm totally out of the Bride message and that's all I thought he was the one that God used to bring it well come on now somebody but you see what we do we want to say well this is the bride's move right here this ain't me a bride's revivals have we had in hell and you know what Satan does he wants to watch us and he studies each of our natures and knows what we're most vulnerable to now are the message people they don't want no emotion they want a preacher that's dead and God they don't want nobody that burns her hide a lot of them what they want is a condo priest type they want you know by the way I'm talked about a guy and he said you know but Bill he said there was a guy told himself you know brother boy said our pastor he is so wonderful me and my wife are sitting at the kitchen table the other night he says about 10 o'clock and said we're sitting in our pajamas and said our pastor come in knocked on the door and come in and sat down and had a cup of coffee with us and just had a time boy we just sat there and talked you know about this and that and the other and he said he got up and went from there to somebody else's house and somebody else's house and somebody else's house and brother random said he said God I wish I could be like that ain't that something that brother Branham would wanted to be like that man but he said the spirit of God spoke to him and said I didn't make you that way now you see a lot of folks would rather have a pastor like that one that doesn't really preach hard just the condo priest type he's all lovey-dovey and all molasses and maple syrup and just oozes out the seams with all that sweet stuff you better watch that hypocrite a man that won't tell you the truth a man that won't try to pull you out of the Flames of hell don't love you come on somebody that's right and you see we're getting it more and more I know a lot of you don't get out you don't hang around perchers the way I do but as it goes on every year some of the ministry and the message are getting softer and softer and softer preaching against sin preaching against sin preaching against that before long if the Lord tears in a few years I'm not sure what the message is even going to look like I'm not sure what it will be even identified to say we're in the message I can tell you where it's already gone for some don't identify it being in the message so they say and they believe God sent a prophet and oh yeah they believe he had the seals and all that but they're just not going to say nothing about it from behind the book They're not going to read anything that he said they're not really going to read quotes they're going to kind of keep that knowledge I knew some preachers like Captain Pentecost oh yeah when I come to the message I found out that's more than Pentecostal preachers know about brother Branham than I ever knew in my life me and Harry was born and raised about 25 miles from where brother Brandon was born Burke's for Kentucky born and raised about 35 miles from where the little fish was resurrected from the dead born and raised about 60 miles a little over from where he went over at the campgrounds in Acton Kentucky all those things happened right there out of our backyard basically and never even knew nothing about it but I found out a bunch of them preachers around there knew it oh I'd hear them preach about kinsman redeemer I'd hear him preach them Mighty sermons and I said Lord have mercy where did they get them at well I found out one day and when I found out where they got them they didn't want to hang around me no more because they knew I was a blabbermouth and they knew I was going to tell you see the difference between me and them is I preached what he said too that I give him the credit but they're Hypocrites they act what they come up with it on their own oh my you see if he cannot stop you from one way or another then he will try to bring in the ceremonial side to where we just come to church and we sat down we get in the routine and we clap our hands and we're as cold as icicles and you got a six foot icicle standing up there and the church becomes like a deep freeze everybody say Amen amen amen careful now brother you're getting dwelled there you're getting wild don't get calmed down calm down oh sorry brother praise the Lord Hallelujah that's scary and a little bit of move of the Holy Ghost hall now I can understand why it bothers them you get the wind to blowing it melts icicles can you imagine what it do before long he totally disappears behind the pulpit why fire comes in there and it sets that place on fire so if he can't get us to one side or get us to the other oh God help us to get in the middle of the road oh brother Donnie you get in the middle of the road you get run over no I won't this is a one-way Street Hallelujah I said this is a one-way Street I will get run over you ain't going to get run over let's get in the middle and stay there [Applause] you see sometimes he tries to flood of neutrality just to be neutral that's what we are friends what do you think about this oh [Music] um really would you mind interpret that for me oh bad supper indigestion neutrality oh I'm I'm not going to say anything what do you think about this cat got your tongue you know where neutral people go to hell because they got a backbone like a jellyfish and they won't stand against sin and error and wrong [Applause] sometimes the flood is in the form of great sorrow misunderstanding sadness God allows something to happen in your life and you just can't put it together can't make no sense out of it and you have more questions and you have answers you see God allows sorrow to come our way God allows heaviness difficult and the longer it goes for many people the worst shape they get well how come this and how come that and why don't God do this and why don't God do that if God loves you if God loves you brother Tam had posted a quote one day this week brother Ron and myself a couple other brothers and then the court brother REM said God loves to heal his children and when I read that quote I thought wow that is awesome but old blabbermouth said to me if God loves to heal his children wonder why he hasn't already healed your daughter brother Donna you mean the devil talks to you he tries now they let him get a few words out the Bible tells me to resist him and he'll flee I don't believe in having seven hour conversations with the devil I don't believe in having an hour conversation with the devil but oh yes he come to the Lord Jesus he's going to come to you he come to the Lord Jesus and the Bible says he left him for a season if he only left the Lord Jesus for a season brother Randy I guarantee you he's going to come back to us over and over again and what are we going to do we're going to knock his block off if he wants to come back we're going to hit him again and if he comes back we're going to hit him again how many times you're going to hit him that depends on how many times he comes back because it's not right for me to listen to a liar when I can listen to the father of Truth you see God allows sorrow and hope you understand me certain sorrow is appointed to us but God allowing a certain sorrow to come to us is never intended to destroy us sometimes it can be one sore left or another little ones can be a deluge of a loved one that when they passed it tore your heart out and left you feeling absolutely pointless worthless totally devastated and what do floods do wreak havoc on homes businesses property you ought to see some of the pictures that I saw earlier this evening in Libya for their and thinking possibly at least twenty thousand if not more killed by the flood turning this place totally upside down changing people's lives forever changing the face of the Earth roads gone great big Caverns deeper than this church totally changed the landscape I've had a few trials like that haven't you tour whenever that flood leaves you and you look back and you say what in the world what in the world happened we've had so many heavy floods just in the last delusions of heavy rains the Little Creek near where I live there which is the one that comes back to here our pond down here has been filled several times in the last few months pump up to the top and running over which is why we had to put this thing out here anyway because the state made us do it to catch all the water because we moved all the grass and we had to put a gigantic pump in the bottom of it so the water supposedly that comes out on the other side is the quality of bottled water so what do you think maybe we should bottle it and sell it Word of Life Church water wow that's what some people would do that's what religion is to a lot of them it ain't nothing but another buck [Applause] and why do they do that to be able to control the flood waters so they will go into our detention Pond and there it will stay and seep down and seep down oh if life was only like that that I could have a detention Pond and there's two different types of bonds retention pawn and detention Pawn so if I could have that before it come to me personally and there would be a detention upon or retention I wouldn't carry it away there was this one there that caught it and it would let it filter down through the sand and all the things that's been embedded in the ground and little by little I would get hit with trawls and I would just change my sunglasses and wipe off the perspiration and that was a flood whoa wouldn't that be something would be worse than we are now we'll be more lazy wouldn't we would be sorry laodiceans so God don't give us no retention nor detention part but God lets it come sometime brother Jim and it will be overwhelming to us and you say Lord God what in the world is going on he has favor Oh Glory that he wants to bestow upon you because he has confidence in you that you will be able to withstand the flood why because you have a standard raised what did God say when the enemy will come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him Lord children if we ain't got a standard in this day we're going to be wiped out we're going to wind up like the rest of the churches like the rest of laodicea is somewhere in the debris field of humanity Lord God but floods always destroy something precious something valuable Something Beautiful something Irreplaceable notice this again I was there 59 19. so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like the flood the spirit of the Lord and the word Spirit there is what I quoted to you the Hebrew word that when we read it ruach look at the meaning of it as that which breathes quickly in animation so ruach breathes in animation you see this is where cartoons started so they started drawing one little thing and then they changed it just a bit and a bit and a bit then put movement and it become animated and so they start making these frames and moving these frames fast enough and it's like Mickey Mouse come alive but he wasn't but they animated it and when they animated it it was as though they gave it a personality and life and you see that's the way we are we are dead and we're no more than a picture on a piece of paper but the spirit of God comes into us and takes those dead Stills and Alma animates our life and quickens us and what does God want to do he wants to continue the same animation in our trials in our test in the rust spots by the gem that we go through when we say Lord where are you he's the animation of your soul he's the ruach that breathes Breath of Life into you and helps you when it seem like all hell is around you oh my listen to this the meaning of this word as that which breathes quickly in animation vigor courage listen Carol the meaning of this word Parker girls listen to the meaning of this word an inspiring a static state of Prophecy and inspiring a static state of Prophecy this is what Isaiah got under Jeremiah brother Branham Malachi Zachariah haggar an animation of a static power into the state of Prophecy so God says when the enemy comes in if you let me I'll lift you up into an ecstatic place of Prophecy why do we need Prophecy in the midst of a flood what are we the most concerned about children when a flood comes our way a flood of the financial crisis a flood of a family crisis what are we concerned about the outcome what's the end result of this going to be what is My outcome oh the doctor says this and this and this but what is the outcome God says if you will let me I am Rock Elohim you see in Genesis whenever the Bible says and the Lord God moved upon the face of the Earth very same word ruach Elohim ruach Elohim so it was God inspiring the chemistry of the Earth from the bowels of the earth that he has spoken into existence and it brought the earth into an a static state of Prophecy oh hallelujah oh sometimes it may be by dream coming to you sometimes it may be by a preacher that don't even know why he's saying it and he will looks right straight at you when he says it and you say glory to God that was from me Lord that was for me Lord what is it ruach was brooding over you in the middle of your flood and saying daughter I'll bring you through this son I'll bring you through this what is it on the static state of Prophecy moving over what the surface of the Earth when the Earth was flooded and what did God do ruak begin to brood one of the meanings of this word is like a a great bird an eagle that will take her wings and pull around her young and flutter her wings so ruach began to flutter over the earth oh I don't know about you that's what I need for him to do to me sometimes when I get in these flood waters and by the Jack I'm looking Lord what's my hand what's it going to be God how's this thing going to turn out I don't know but I need to know Lord I need to know I believe you're with me but house is going to turn out and the ecstatic state of Prophecy sometimes it can be a quote that a brother from Africa will send you sometimes it might be somebody that just sends you an email brother Donnie you've been on my heart well here lately I've been on a lot of folks Hearts I'm telling you what it's just been about weekly in the last I don't know how long Brother Don you've been thinking about you preacher pastor friend of mine text me one day this week said you better you've been on my heart so bad I've been so burdened for you I've been praying for us to thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah why he knows exactly where we are and what's he do he moves on the hearts of the people of God I'll tell you what I that couldn't be a greater honor to me than if I got a letter from every senator in the United States if I got a personal letter from Joe Biden himself which he probably couldn't write in pool Fowler uh though from ever congressperson in the Congress to get an email from some of you saints of God full of the Holy Ghost and you write me say brother Donnie you've been on my heart I say look you there devil look at our devil what inside it's an ecstatic state of Prophecy that God let me know I'm mindful of your son I'm not taking the water so yeah well yet but I will as snow will come to the flood so will you come through the flood as my children have come through hard times you'll come to Hard Times [Applause] ah but you see what is the standard Bearer now God says by his attribute of ruach ruach every every name of God has a trait and a characteristic by which he chooses to reveal himself Abraham needed to know him in the attribute of El Shaddai he didn't reveal himself to Abraham in the attribute of ruach but El Shaddai and then Abraham needed a a ram a sacrifice and he revealed himself to him in the form of what Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide but when the enemy comes in like a flood he chooses this one attribute which covers everything from Zion back that no matter what you have need of ruach moves on the face of the deep when the murders Knee Deep and the flood waters is everywhere and you can't find nothing to eat don't seem right and you can't find nobody you know how it is in flood time what happens the water becomes terminated and the food becomes contaminated and the electricity is all and everything is going on in the flood and you see my things are not normal of course they're not normal but ruach says listen listen don't you hear it oh you thought that was another storm coming didn't you it wasn't his ruach he's flattering his wings notice this and Isaiah again chapter 11 verse 10. now God said that he'd lift up a standard raw could so he wants to have something lifted up in the time of flood to where we know her to Rally around what do we do where do we go on the flood waters of that what do we do we need a standard I mean that's what a standard is or brother Donnie I know it's what it says how long are sisters why they're dressing and and her brothers you know can't have their hair no that that's not what the word standard means at all notice Isaiah 11 10 and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an inside so a standard in the Old Testament was every tribe of Israel had their own name and had their own standard so a standard was their flag so if you were in the tribe of Judah you would pitch your tent under that standard so they would come up to drive it down in the sand and then you knew where to park your tent and your donkeys and your cows and your youngins why what did you look for your standard and when you found your standard now remember there's 12 out through there and you've got to find which one's yours you see that's a lot of the problem with a lot of people today they don't know what the standard is for this hour some of them still trying to to Camp under a Baptist standard or a church of godsend and some of them in the messenger under a two Soul standard or a seventh understanding of this Center or that Center I'm not interested in any of that stuff myself I want to find where Christ is I want to find not a cold dead religion I don't want some cold form or something other than this message I need a resurrected savior I've got needs my children have needs my people have need I don't want to put you under a standard that's compromised on the word and so well God used to do that but it don't do it no more notice what our standard will be he will set an end sign which is the standard so God himself went this is the standard what was it Christ the root of Jesse verse 12 He Shall Set up an end sign for the Nations and shall assemble the outcast of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the Earth so Christ Jesus being God in the form of a man what's the standard that we're to Rally around and yet every so-called Christian Church would say Amen to that well sure we we believe that but just in one major difference between us and Them is they believe he was we believe he still is and we also believe he is come in the flesh oh Hallelujah we we don't just believe the word is printed on paper we believe the word is being made flesh and his bride come on somebody you see so we can't rally around that statement Web Doctor so and so on so and so says Mark 16 the last half of that chapter there wasn't even in the original yeah I'm kind of reminded of that what that old lady that got real sick and she wrote to her son you know they're in college and the boy was in Theology and he was taking a lot of Seminary stuff and his mother wrote to him and said honey you know the doctor said I ain't got very long to live so they wrote him a letter you better come home and then in a day or two they've got another that's about well you know what everything's okay everything's fine so the boy come home sometime later and he said Mom you know how you doing they sit down to talk a little bit and have a little bit of fellowship and he said mom you never did really tell me what happened well son son listen glory to God he said mother mother well son that got real bad sick and that's one of them women you know that little that little church upon the corner yes mother I know that church it's the illiterate type it's the illiterate type uh-huh well they don't know too much and they ain't got no degrees now you're talking about my language I never graduated from high school didn't go to Bob Jones University as a matter of fact I never even heard of so just you know some time ago I never heard about Harvard or Hartford or any of the rest of them forwards I never went to no Bible school I did graduate with the ba they although Born Again experience also got a hgf degree Holy Ghost Phil fire baptized I've got I got one I've got a real good degree in theology I've got another degree in CDs casting out Devils I've got one of LH laying hands on the set well glory to God oh I know some of you get ashamed of me sometimes I wish brother Donnie was a little bit more refined I wish he'd act that way you know he kind of looks that way when he first comes out and Carol said Donnie I want you to look good I said yeah your iron my shirt your arm my time to look you know decent presentable when I come out time the church is over I look like I've been in a horse race and I was the horse so it looks like you know I got very many mannered by the dawn of where did you learn your Pulpit manners that's from my brother he was a Baptist John was his first name oh I know somebody like to change me a little bit but rather would you rather me follow the spirit of God or follow some degrees and we wouldn't have the power of God in our church which can we want the Holy Ghost I can change lives so the standard is a signal of War well the most famous pictures of our nation and our identity is Iwo Jima you've seen it all of you familiar with it was not a couple of gods of degrees there's not a couple of kernels and guys that set back in the Pentagon but it was a man out there in the midst of the battle holding a plot Dunkin Donuts holding up some type of handbook how to survive World War II but they risked their life to raise that standard of religion hallelujah hallelujah oh God give us men give us men that will stand and preach the gospel bare-handed that will not compromise for a crowd that will not compromise so we can be able to get more people in our church I don't want more people in our church if all they want is just to be able to live the way they want to live I want people that want to be changed I want people that want to live like the bride of Christ not a bunch of homes out there on the whole blocks I want people hallelujah that say I have a need man of God pray for me and it will be as you have said I want people that can call Jesus on the scene just a cloud don't give me a crowd give me the clouds [Applause] so if the flag bearer got shot what did they do leave the flag laying on the ground somebody didn't know where they stood but somebody would run take that standard and stand it up oh Hallelujah can't you see why we needed seven Church AIDS Messengers the standard was so on the ground and the smut of the world and God sent a prophet with a message to raise it up God knew that Prophet wouldn't live the entire age so he would call him in after him and say now you men got the same spirit that he had you see that's the real God called men of this message it ain't them that wants to be rich it ain't them that wants to have a church and think I want to find Dandy thing to be to have their own church I'll tell you one thing if a man starts a church on his own he's opening up the office mess he ever seen in his life a man that wants to be an evangelist because he thinks it'd be an easy way of life here are cuckoo birds all I know but brother give us God called men that'll stand right there knowing they rest their life they risk their life holding the standard but there they plan it and they stand right there and hold it till they die till they die cause them Sharp Shooters seemed right at you cause they hate that standard Hallelujah Satan can drop the standard men of God will compromise the people don't know where to Rally where do we go which where's the where's the battle's front Where's the Line we don't know where to go do we Retreat do we charge what do we do we don't know what to do let me give the kingdom of hell an update you will never God's men Hallelujah you've attacked some of them with cancer you've attacked some of this and that and the other but you will never stop them and if God takes one he'll raise up another one and if God takes out then he'll raise up another one and if God takes out and he'll raise up another one God must have standard values so the people can know what do we do what do we do where's the line where do we stop where do we fall back don't you see why Satan loves to bring confusion in and among the preachers and I preached what I did Sunday a couple of Sundays ago brother Ron's about bringing the bride home safely and about those 60 Valiant men that were Solomon's personal bodyguards they were sent to bring the bride home the Bible says they were expert in war I walked off the platform went back into the office at brother Ron's brother Ron came back brother Tim came back brother Tim come over close to him he said brother Donnie I thought that was so awesome he said but one thing that just so stuck out to me was it those men could use their swords on each other are you talking about when experts in war fight they know what they're doing and they know how to use that word and how many times has Satan got among us and had men that knew how to fight and knew how to use the scriptures and knew how to use the quotes and they would turn their swords on their own so he goes to the lower parts of the Earth and he knocks on the hell's door foreign yes who's there the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end the prophet said Satan opened the door and said oh you finally arrived did you I thought I had you when I killed Abel I thought I got you when I took Moses I thought I got you and it goes to a whole line they said yep I'm here my blood is hard on Calvary and let me just remind you what the prophet of God said about the blood of Jesus he said it's just as fresh and Powerful as if Jesus would have died just a few minutes ago the blood ain't lost its power it's the same after 2 000 years it can save a sinner it can cleanse a lost person the power and the blood to heal the sack oh but it's amazing because the standard can be a symbol of War but it can also be a symbol of peace so there it flies in peaceful times but you still know where to go a standard is an inside victory so as a living resurrected savior the Angels had to raise the Crimson Flags of Triumph and set death or death swallowed up and Victory oh Lord God children this is what we want flying over us tonight not no cold confession I want that power of the living resurrected savior flying over my soul what will it bring it brought an end to my War because I was born to fight against God in the natural body but the end sign changed me and it changed from a symbol of war between me and God to assemble a peace and no longer at odds with God I'm no longer at us with my brothers and sisters I'm at peace Hallelujah [Applause] when the standard is set up the army together so it's a sign of recruitment and they say here's a push you want to enlist yeah believe it though what do you think I believe I hope therefore they're more Japs you know I believe I can do that man alive time you go through boot camp you'll realize you couldn't do nothing and if you're a marine you get that much longer some of us I'll call it God let me ask the devil Jesus said I've got to get the devil out of you first son I got to get you you voomies your face all washed up so you don't look like a bunch of out of hell I've got to get you full of the Holy Ghost and I've got to send you to boot camp you may be kicked around a little bit you may be smack down by that Sergeant what did you say son yes sir yes sir yes sir ah Numbers chapter 1 verse 52 and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp every man by his own standard throughout their host chapter 2 verse 2 every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard with the inside of their father's house far off about the Tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch Isaiah 49 22 thus say of the Lord God behold I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles and set up my standard Hallelujah to the people and they shall bring thy sons and their arms and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders let me close Saint John 12 32. and I if I be lifted up from the Earth will draw all men this is the standard France Christ Jesus now I talk about a Baptist Jesus I tell him how to Church of God Jesus because most of the nominations make him a second person the godhead that's not the inside he said I am the Lord God and beside me there is no other he said if there is any other God I don't know anything about it there's no one here well if he says there ain't nobody there I figure there ain't nobody there since he was there before I was there and there before you was there and then none of us that was there he was the only numbers there and he said there ain't nobody else there I figure there ain't nobody else there I mean I know I'm down with a cold book and maybe there's some me all but my goodness one plus one you only ought to figure what if but God is the only one that can take fatherhood sonship baptism of the Holy Ghost I had one plus one plus one and he still winds up in one God he don't wind up as three persons any three individuals he winds up with attributes and the same godhead [Applause] and not only that but if you're a bride tonight you also or part of the godhead listen [Applause] you see the manifestation of Christ in the flesh the revelation of him and the gospel is a signal to law Sinners to shake off their shackles it's a signal to the sick person to shake off their disease it's a signal to those that are boundless whatever that they don't have to be bound no more this is why of course it's the preacher's responsibility to hold a standard up before the people that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so what do we do then whenever a preacher does that and people see that in his ministry then whenever they have a need they just believe they can go for prayer and God hears them and God's going to do it God may not do it tomorrow God may not do it next week but God's going to do it in his time but God is going to do it but what if a preacher then hoists to stand her back up on I'll tell you what now we got a bunch of Pentecostals in this message and I'll tell you what they're praying for people and they're having prayer lines and stuff like that now we just don't need that stuff no more Lord have mercy we've got more sick people now we've ever had we still need to pray for the sick we still need encouragement how many knows it's the truth so what does Satan one do he wants him preachers to take down that standard of Hebrews 13 8 and blow up another standards say the days of Miracles is passed well I agree with them for everybody who hangs that flag and everybody who gathers under it they are past but that don't apply to us because that ain't our flag not in what we're rallying around our flag is Hebrews 13 8. it's not Paul is the same it's not brother Branham is the same it's not you as the same or I am the same but brother Joel he is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] oh praise God shoot my time's gone I didn't get halfway done let me just read one question here in the seat of description now Jesus said just before this great discrepancy is gathered and burned the son of man will reveal himself in the same manner as he did then what is it a lifting up or fresh before you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh not this great preacher young this and are we all glory to God brother Donnie Reagan brother so and so brother Daryl Ward no no that that's not the lifting up the lifting up is Jesus Christ is the same it'll only be a few more settings under the Lord tears I'll die I'll go with the way of the Grave if this church is tied to me y'all might as well just burn it now if I'm the strength of this church if I'm the stability of this church we have wasted our time well come on children and brother Ron Spencer is the only stability in his church I feel sorry for him if the Lord takes mother to him and his church falls apart that's a very sad ending to a Greek Minister but I am not the foundation of this church mother Tim Pruitt by the wrong Spencer all the rest of these Great Men of God around the world our foundation don't need to be the pastor our foundation needs to be the Abduction of the Apostles and Jesus Christ himself the Chief Cornerstone not aware brother Donny passes you can get a stonemason to go up there and take that stone out that says Pastor Donnie Reagan I'll eat them I have no problem with you taking them down once I'm dead so what are we going to do we're going to turn this into a hog light once the pastor's changed the Bible don't say don't you Reagan the same Jesus Christ is the same the work must go on eating the sick must go on it did not stop in 1965. we still need it among us do we not praise the Lord God bless you Satan don't you love him with all your hearts go ahead and give me money praise the Lord once the standard moves the Army knows one to March yeah you imagine if you're way back in the Battalion or the platoon and you can't really see the guys in the first row and you're saying well I'm watching them guys you better not because if they marched it down over a hill and you can't see them you're going to be in a mess you don't know where they stopped they started they turned left they turn right but it just so happens that the standard is higher than any man in the army well glory to God I set the standard is Harsh so you may not be able to see your favorite preacher because he's going through a valley or whatever more but if they've got the standards high enough you can say glory to God we're moving on praise the lord I can't see brother I can't see brother so and so but I can see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever that's why Paul said looking unto Jesus The Altar and finisher of our faith that's the standard so that's what we want praise God it was a disgrace for the colors to fall to the ground it was a disgrace for the colors to be captured and the enemy prized them they wanted him don't you say why Satan wants to attack Hebrews 13 8 that Jesus is the same what's he done for him to me the message churches he's taken their colors do you understand some Churches some Churches in the message believe that Jesus come invisibly somehow 1977. and since then nobody else has been saved they don't take communion they don't have revivals they don't reach to the Lost and they go as far as teaching castration to the men in their churches why would you want a father serpent seed they say so they didn't have children and now they don't have grandchildren and this is their posterity why they took down the standard of Jesus Christ and put up the standard of some idiot preacher brother Donnie that's not nice the prophet said it so I reckon I can't come on I'm interested in some of your cultured ideas of what you think is proper get your head out of Facebook and go to studying the message more and you might find out some of these things so we took down the standard of prayer meetings and took down the standard and then we wonder why folks can't live right get that standard of the baptism of the Holy Ghost up there oh brother it'll anoint you to live right in the middle of the flood you're swimming out on the other side and the devil said I thought I had you you can't seek me devil I'm part of the whole mind greater than the Titanic was I'm Unsinkable Hallelujah I may believe it let's rally friends that's Riley there'll be a call won't last long it'll be a short quick work you better get on board if you're going Hallelujah the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost which she has worked in part while the headstone is descending he'll shut the mouths of the critics I heard him say it again last night he would shut the mouths of the critics and it would be marvelous and our eyes Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so our church can be great so our church can be nothing so he can be great he's not going to do this to prove I've got one great super son over and another great super son over here he wants to prove he's the Mighty God we're not looking at the guy on the front line we're not looking to God the second line we're watching the inside we're watching the inside oh I know friend a lot of folks fell in love with the prophet and that's what they think whose image is on the inside I don't see brother random on the inside I see Christ Jesus amen I see Christ Jesus a pillar of fire a pillar of Life the same yesterday today and forever that's who I'm following [Applause] oh a disgrace to lose standard it's a disgrace to lose our callers let's fight for it to the end are you willing to stand true so what if God lets an element of persecution rise how many of us will still be standing there's enough compromising message churches around and there'll be more that she'll be able to go there and not really even be identified as a message believer because it'll be such a mixture of worldliness and everything else hang on quote to profit and ain't gonna really preach the message they're just preaching the Shadows on the outskirts I'm not an outskirt guy never have been I like to be in the middle of things if there's a good brawl where is it where is it I like having buddies preacher buddies that when you get in a good brawl brother Jim Babb used to say brother Donnie you're the type of guy that if you ever get into a street fight you're the type of guy that you want to look around and see or their bias and some of these other message brothers are real eloquent and the real Statesman and they're this and that and the other but they may or may not be there in the middle of a battle believe me I've had some of them locked out in the battles I've been through and they was behind me all right about 42.5 miles uh-huh oh but I'm so glad God let me have some buddies and some friends and some men right here in this church and you can look around and say how you doing brother now yo you're good man I'm good brother Donnie keep on stabbing keep on stabbing brother Joel men that can stand back to back say come on buddy I got you back oh yeah some preachers have had my back all right just long enough to stab me in the back they won't do you no good though is there anybody here that wants to hold the standard with me if God takes me what about some of you young men what about some of you sister in your life in the Gospel of Jesus Christ are we willing to hold the standard up don't be ashamed name of your long hair don't be ashamed of your dresses you're wearing the standard of Jesus Christ every day when you go to Walmart when you get out on the street you are this famous standard of holiness it's nothing to be ashamed of [Applause] let's pray together Lord Jesus a prayer to help us father I was never in our armed forces of our nation amidst the wars and times that was on the Earth they'll ask me sometimes and I'll check out at Lowe's Home Depot got a military discount I say I'm a captain of the host of the Lord does that count and in one way I feel ashamed because I was never able to stand for our country but I would have but I've been able to be called and there's folks standing here in this service tonight that risk their very lives that we would have this Freedom tonight to be able to worship you in spirit and Truth and I thank every one of them for that we're so grateful Lord but Lord God even though I was not able to serve in the Army the Marines the Air Force you call me to serve and the greatest army that's ever been on the face of the Earth Lord God not only me but every child of God sending her to not the young the old the Middle Ages the sisters every one of us we've been called to serve in the army of the Living God Lord be living in a time of great confusion flooding does that Lord as I've seen some of these floods on YouTube and watch the people as they're screaming and hollering some of the people's cars get caught in the water and they're trying to get out the car filling up with water and they don't know what to do anyone that understands it knows it's such an impossibility almost to be able to even get your door open whenever you're submerged in the water that way many people will drown because they cannot get out in the time of flood now someone just the other day Lord in China that was going down through there holding on to post and holding on to signpost in the rushing water coming down through the streets got over their head totally disappeared lost Lord we can see the floods the floods of intellectualism the flood on the other side of pure emotionalism the flood of world and it's the flood of this the flood of that some are going down in the waters of worldliness some are going down in the waters of compromise Lord the world both naturally and spiritually is inundated with flood waters and what's so sad is many of them are letting go of the standard we can't drown as long as we're hiding in the right place because you'll always have a place of safety for us help us Lord Jesus at Word of Life Church may we not only be called by that but may we be that the word of life from that scripture Lord that I love that Paul wrote holding Force the word of life that's what I want to hold to these people they're inundated with troubles Lord God they're flooded all around them their homes their families their jobs their work we've got to have something to hold on to something to Rally around and there's so many voices one preacher said hey over here's it over here others say no no no don't go that way come over here and people go there and they go here they go there they go somewhere else in them where they belong they don't know who the pastor is so they Skip Hop and jump around how sad in the middle of a flood people are jumping around from one place to another God have mercy if it was ever a time to be stable and anchored help me Jesus Lord sometimes it seems like the rain will never stop it seems like I get under one thunder cloud after another after another but Lord God I can hear my destiny ringing down through eternity Hallelujah I am the Lord God that created the heavens and the Earth did not I speak the universe into existence did not I call you I hear you say my name Lord this is what we need in this hour of stability to know that you have called us not just the preachers ever man woman boy and girl we couldn't hear an echo from the Throne of God you are mine that's the standard of the Soul feelings ain't our standard because a lot of times in battles we feel everything but you we feel everything but saved we feel everything but healed but the standard Remains the Same whether we feel it or not hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we worship you tonight Lord Jesus oh Hallelujah anybody like to raise your left standard and your right standard and wave your little Flags around in the presence of God Hallelujah give him a wave offering right here tonight Lord we surrender but we're not only surrender we worship you Lord Jesus we bless your name here tonight father Lord though thy may fall to the right and though they may fall to the left and some look this and that and the other Lord God may we be found stable may we be found standing on the Rock of Ages Lord Hallelujah it must have been such a scary time for the apostles when they realized you had died how could that be possible their minds was inundated with no doubt these thoughts of confusion and they were sore so Torn to Pieces they didn't know what to do and the flag it seemed was removed from them it was the transition from the natural pole of the Flesh and the flag is going to be changed from the human body now to the pillar of fire the spirit Spirit being and it had took a few days for that to transpire and the standard was gone from Before Their Eyes they didn't know what to do Peter got the torp he said I'm going back to what I've done before I'm going back fishing they said we're going with you they didn't know what to do the standard was gone they were so tore up they didn't know what to make of it Hallelujah but then the standard appeared in a resurrected body and they looked at him and they still didn't know who he was until the standards started doing the same things that he'd done before and then they recognized it was Jesus oh Jesus we see you doing the same things that you did when you were here we see you doing the same things that you did in the book of Acts we see you doing the same things that you've done down to the age because you're the same yesterday today and forever and we know it's you Lord so we can rally around that standard there we can be stable though the water is getting higher and higher the confusion getting greater and greater and Lord will certainly yes absolutely we're losing property yeah no question about it beautiful things in our life are being destroyed precious things are being taken away from us by the endonation of the waters is coming but we are still stable because we are wading through we know which way to go and that's up on the promise of your word thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight father hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we bless your name Lord Jesus oh thank you Father Hallelujah to God can we just worship him just just a few minutes before we go I know you got to work tomorrow you got school and college and all of that sort of thing oh but man this is such an important time praise the Lord let's make a new commitment tonight what do you say that we're identified oh my let us run as they did to evil on Iwo Jima whenever that flag my Bronze Statues have been made of it pictures have circled the globe it's a proud thing for us as American sure and we can identify with it and you know many of you know the history and all of it the what it meant but it's a symbol of our freedom we can still point tonight to that cross and we can point to men what good did the flag Do by itself but there were men there who were willing to risk their lives and hold that frightful don't you understand God call minutes that's why Satan absolutely hates the ministry in this message the ministry has never been so charged and so stood against and so humiliated and still laughed at as it is this message not another message down to the seven Church ages has the ministry been publicly and privately ridiculed jokes made about it you not believe the things I've heard jokes made about preachers from the people in this message not realizing they're going to stand before God one day and answer for ridiculing what God's Prophet said was God's commanding officers that's the way God looks at him and if you don't you need the Holy Ghost that's your supplying facts that's what it is God called men or God's commanding officers that's what he said in 1962 in North Carolina they are God's commanding officers of God's inside dress work oh my soul you need to pray for every one of them pray for every one of them that God will help to hold that flag and not slip another standard up there and take this one down and put that one behold the original one brother it'll change people's lives it'll fill them with the Holy Ghost said it'll change their lives
