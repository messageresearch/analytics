[36:38] I looked high and low
[36:41] still couldn't find nobody
[36:46] there's nobody greater
[36:50] Nobody Greater
[36:52] nobody greater than you
[36:59] [Music]
[37:02] [Applause]
[37:24] this morning
[37:27] oh there he is
[37:31] sneak up on me like that
[37:34] this man right here I told him
[37:38] I said read this is read ball
[37:42] the Lord run you down
[37:45] to tell you he loves you
[37:53] ain't God good
[37:55] he's going to share a testimony with you
[37:57] this morning I want you to listen to
[37:58] this
[38:05] that's truly is a testimony
[38:07] brother
[38:09] Caleb's singing that song I mean
[38:11] searched all over and it's the truth you
[38:14] know at least in my life anyway that
[38:16] I've searched high and low
[38:18] couldn't find nobody that was greater
[38:20] than him all the voids and everything
[38:22] that
[38:23] he is filled I thought I had to fill
[38:25] with lots of other things lots of you
[38:27] know nonsense and everything
[38:30] but truly is nobody greater than him
[38:33] he'll take all that away from you and
[38:35] all it is is him just one thing
[38:37] you know but uh
[38:40] you know if you have a testimony you
[38:42] know I believe that you should share it
[38:43] I ran a long time from not doing that
[38:45] you know because God's pulled on my
[38:48] heart many times uh bringing me back in
[38:51] church sitting here and honestly seeing
[38:53] all you wonderful people a brother said
[38:55] I think last Sunday or a couple Sundays
[38:57] ago said you come to church and you see
[38:59] all y'all smiling faces just like
[39:01] Brother Louie coming in and this these
[39:03] these uh Brothers playing the drums and
[39:06] and the instruments here that they they
[39:09] come and devote their time in and out
[39:11] all the time and it's just you know it's
[39:13] something about the people of God and
[39:15] how it's just a joy that you know you
[39:18] come in you sit with them and it's they
[39:20] bring you love you know but uh
[39:23] you know I shared my testimony with uh
[39:25] brother brother Ron's church and I told
[39:27] about you know how he met me at the
[39:29] waffle house and everything
[39:31] I'm sure some of y'all have heard it but
[39:33] I was talking to brother Joel Brown a
[39:35] while back and he said you know don't be
[39:37] scared to share some of the things that
[39:40] you know that maybe would would some say
[39:42] would it be explicit or what but you
[39:45] know I was hardened drugs and
[39:47] alcohol women you know just anything
[39:51] that is sinful off would bring you and
[39:53] uh
[39:54] you know like searched all over but
[39:58] a lot I gotta figure out where I gotta
[40:00] start here because there's so much I
[40:01] could say but
[40:03] you know I tried quitting those things
[40:06] my little brother had actually he was
[40:08] living with me for a while and
[40:11] he uh got a call from my dad saying that
[40:14] you know if he straightened up he can
[40:15] move back and work for him
[40:17] so he quit doing some things you know
[40:20] because he had
[40:21] be able to work for my dad you know he
[40:23] wanted to make sure that he was on the
[40:24] right path so drug testing him and all
[40:27] that stuff well I I believe God done
[40:30] this for me because if I couldn't have
[40:32] seen it this way I don't think there was
[40:33] another way I could see it but you know
[40:34] I tried quitting doing all those things
[40:36] maybe a month before I got saved and uh
[40:40] I tried doing all that stuff on my own
[40:42] and you know it was hard but I was like
[40:45] you know you got this man ain't no
[40:47] problem ain't nothing else that you
[40:48] can't do you know
[40:49] and uh found out myself found myself
[40:52] even deeper in it two three weeks later
[40:54] you know and realized like man you know
[40:58] you really can't it's not at the time I
[41:00] didn't see that they had such a hold on
[41:02] me you know but I just really I look
[41:04] back now and I realized you know of
[41:06] God's grace and how he did pull me
[41:08] through all that stuff but you know just
[41:10] that kind of those kind of things that
[41:12] you're going through like you know
[41:14] you're being held by something you don't
[41:16] know what it is but it's just because
[41:17] the devil knows that something else was
[41:19] fixing to happen you know and uh
[41:23] anyway I'll share with you a little bit
[41:25] about the Waffle House experience too
[41:27] that I was
[41:28] uh I had a day in the gym on Friday and
[41:32] I just I couldn't sleep pretty much the
[41:34] whole week and I thought it was because
[41:36] because we were fixing to do this
[41:37] competition and I thought it was because
[41:40] of something I was going to do in the
[41:42] gym you know some
[41:43] some big lift but uh
[41:46] I went going going to the gym and then
[41:48] after I got done at the gym I was like
[41:49] man something you know something still
[41:51] like there's just something in my heart
[41:52] that's just burning and you know like I
[41:55] told brother Donnie you know that God
[41:56] had never stopped dealing with me
[41:58] because he had
[41:59] one of my buddies told me not too long
[42:01] ago that he's he's a gentleman he just
[42:02] he knocks on the door while the devil
[42:04] slips through the back door and he just
[42:06] stayed there just knocking just over and
[42:08] over in my life just months and months
[42:10] and months that I've seen and I just
[42:12] kind of pushed him away pushed him away
[42:14] and uh finally that Friday after I got
[42:17] done lifting I was gonna go go eat with
[42:19] one of my friends and I was like you
[42:21] know I'm going to go to Waffle House
[42:22] instead because he didn't answer and I
[42:25] walked in sat down a brother walks in
[42:28] behind me
[42:29] sits down a couple a couple places away
[42:32] from me and he tries to knock on my
[42:35] knock on the door of my heart you know
[42:37] just talking to me you know real nothing
[42:40] nothing like as far as
[42:42] like he just he wanted he wanted to talk
[42:44] to me you know you could tell that he
[42:46] wanted to talk to me and I could tell
[42:47] that he did too so I would just pushed
[42:49] him away as I pushed so many people away
[42:52] and because I know the love that he had
[42:56] for me and how he could he had
[42:58] compassion in his eyes and the love that
[42:59] he's seen and
[43:02] I was just you know what this wasn't
[43:04] happening again today but for some
[43:07] reason you know he'd never he didn't
[43:09] stop which I believe was was God just
[43:12] helping him telling him my friend you
[43:15] know this is somebody that I need I need
[43:17] back so
[43:19] he just kept pursuing me just even sit
[43:21] in that Waffle House through that man
[43:23] and he said
[43:25] pretty much said brother this is your
[43:27] pretty much the last chance that you're
[43:29] going to have today if you don't do
[43:30] something about this you know you're
[43:32] you're going to be in a world of hurt he
[43:35] said you're going to have a change today
[43:37] and it's going to happen today
[43:39] and I just tears just rolling out of my
[43:42] eyes and I look at him and he don't say
[43:46] much more but he says you know
[43:49] the good Lord sent me here today just
[43:51] for your last chance and I look at him
[43:54] just tears rolling my eyes and he says
[43:56] he says a couple more things but he's
[43:58] about to leave and I asked him in his
[44:00] name and he says you'll remember me by
[44:02] Rich in Christ
[44:03] and I turned around as he's walking I'm
[44:06] like I said tears just pouring on my
[44:08] eyes and he's walking away and he says
[44:11] I'll see you up there I'll never forget
[44:13] that man it's just
[44:14] something that he he just had never
[44:17] stopped pursuing me and that's the same
[44:19] thing with any Young Folks any old
[44:20] people that's sitting here you know he
[44:22] you know that he's there and he is still
[44:24] pursuing you you got to let you got to
[44:26] let go of that you've gotta you've got
[44:28] to take hold of what he has given you
[44:30] because I tell you it's one million
[44:32] times better than what you what you
[44:34] would ever experience you know once he
[44:36] gets a hold of you and I just want to
[44:38] praise God for that because I mean it's
[44:40] he's seen me through it has nothing to
[44:42] do with me but he's the one that has
[44:44] shown his mercy and his grace and it's
[44:45] abundant and he's there for you all you
[44:48] got to do is let go for him but anyway I
[44:51] appreciate everybody here in this church
[44:52] I'm not very good at talking but you

[47:04] [Music]
[47:07] amen
[47:10] it's good to see y'all this morning
[47:12] thankful for the opportunity I'm honored
[47:15] that brother Donnie would have
[47:16] confidence for
[47:18] me to come here before you and speak
[47:19] before you if I don't know brother Kenny
[47:22] was here with a I'd have handed a baton
[47:24] off
[47:25] but I I appreciate it and brother Reid
[47:28] is
[47:29] his testimony just proves
[47:32] you can't go too far
[47:34] no matter where you're at
[47:38] you have value
[47:41] you have value
[47:43] right that value is that seed of life
[47:46] it doesn't matter where you go
[47:49] what you've done if that seed of life
[47:51] isn't there you have hope I said whether
[47:53] we're singing My Hope Is in him the only
[47:56] hope that you have brother I love the
[47:57] way brother Brandon said hopeless
[47:58] Faith's little sister
[48:00] that means they're related
[48:03] they're related
[48:06] faith and hope are related and if you
[48:09] have hope hope can bring you to Faith
[48:13] amen
[48:15] so if you'll turn your Bibles I can get
[48:17] into it I was telling brother Jimmy
[48:19] Woodson back there
[48:22] I've been taking notes and studying on
[48:25] this for months
[48:27] I studied seven hours yesterday when I
[48:29] closed the computer the devil started
[48:30] talking to me
[48:33] now if you're a minister of Kenny you
[48:35] know what happens every time
[48:36] the devil is going to talk to you it's
[48:38] not going to be received well you're
[48:40] going to say the wrong things and you're
[48:42] not you know
[48:44] you realize when devil starts talking to
[48:46] you it's like a pep talk to a fighter
[48:48] before he gets in the ring
[48:50] he's just giving you ammunition he's
[48:53] just getting you ready to fight so
[48:56] he's a dumb Devil by the field dumb
[48:58] devil so hopefully we can get out of the
[49:01] way
[49:02] it's not us that fights anyway so
[49:05] if you have your Bible turn to John 11
[49:08] and 21
[49:10] . I'm going to skip around I'll read a
[49:11] large portion of that that scripture but
[49:13] I will skip around so you're not
[49:14] standing too long
[49:17] a very familiar scripture then Martha
[49:19] said to Jesus Lord if thou has been here
[49:22] my brother had not died
[49:25] but I know that even now whatsoever thou
[49:27] will ask of God God will give it to thee
[49:29] Jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[49:31] rise again
[49:33] Martha said unto him I know that he
[49:35] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[49:36] the last day and Jesus said unto her
[49:38] I am the resurrection and the life he
[49:41] that believeth in me though he was dead
[49:43] yet shall he live whosoever liveth and
[49:46] believeth in me shall never die
[49:49] believeth thou this
[49:51] we'll skip down to verse 37 and some of
[49:54] them said could not this man which
[49:56] opened the eyes of the blind which
[49:58] caused that even this man should not
[50:00] have died and the thing about that
[50:02] scripture that stands out the most to me
[50:03] we look at at people around in our own
[50:06] Sanctuary our own our own church here
[50:09] that are going through some stuff and
[50:10] they're they're at the some of them at
[50:11] the point of death it looks like
[50:14] and Satan tells us could God not have
[50:16] healed them
[50:18] he was amongst you testified that he was
[50:20] amongst you could he not have healed you
[50:21] when you was alive right
[50:24] but our God
[50:26] it's never too late
[50:28] he's always right on time you think
[50:29] Jesus didn't know that Lazarus was going
[50:31] to die
[50:32] he knew he was going to die
[50:36] could not
[50:37] could not this man have opened the eyes
[50:40] of the blind have caused that even this
[50:41] men man should not have died Jesus
[50:44] therefore groaning in himself cometh to
[50:47] the Grave
[50:48] it was a cave and a stone laid upon it
[50:51] and Jesus said it
[50:52] take ye away the stone Mary Martha the
[50:55] sister of him that was dead said Lord by
[50:58] this time he stinketh for you have been
[50:59] dead four days
[51:00] I want you to the one thing we're going
[51:02] to talk about today Jesus told them to
[51:03] throw the stone away
[51:05] told them Jesus did not roll the stone
[51:07] away
[51:09] Lord by this time he's tinketh for he
[51:11] has been dead four days Jesus said to
[51:13] her said I not unto thee that if thou
[51:15] wouldest believe thou should see the
[51:16] glory of God when they took the stone
[51:18] away from the place where the dead was
[51:20] laid Jesus lift up his eyes
[51:22] and said father I thank you that thou
[51:24] Hast heard me and I know thou heareth me
[51:26] always
[51:27] but because the people which stand by I
[51:30] said it that they may believe that thou
[51:31] has sent me
[51:32] and when he had thus
[51:34] spoke and he cried with a loud voice
[51:36] Lazarus come forth and he that was dead
[51:39] came forth bound hand and foot with
[51:42] grave clothes
[51:43] his face was bound about about with a
[51:46] napkin Jesus said unto them unto them
[51:48] you lose him
[51:50] right you take the grave clothes off of
[51:52] him you you give him praise for all that
[51:56] God has done you remove the filth
[51:58] everything that that he was with inside
[52:00] the grave you take it off we have a job
[52:03] to do
[52:07] then Jesus we're going to go down to
[52:10] John 12 1-2 and then we'll pray
[52:14] then Jesus six days before the Passover
[52:16] came to Bethany where Lazarus which had
[52:19] been dead whom he raised
[52:21] from the dead and there made him a
[52:23] supper and Martha served but Lazarus was
[52:26] one of them that sat at the table with
[52:28] him let's pray
[52:31] Heavenly Father
[52:33] Lord we're so grateful Lord to come
[52:36] to your house this morning Lord
[52:38] to sit around your word father Lord It's
[52:41] food for our journey
[52:42] Lord to tell us of the things of Heaven
[52:45] things Lord that you would desire us to
[52:47] know father there's things that no man
[52:49] can just hail father it takes it takes a
[52:52] revelation from the father Lord we're so
[52:55] thankful for the wonderful spirit we
[52:56] feel here this morning Lord we're so
[52:58] thankful for brother Reid's testimony
[52:59] Lord we believe that you're still in the
[53:02] the saving business we're still believe
[53:04] that you're in the redeeming business
[53:05] you're in the healing business Lord
[53:07] you're in the Deliverance business Lord
[53:09] and and I hope of this sermon this
[53:11] morning Father that we catch a glimpse
[53:12] of that Lord even though we have a part
[53:15] to do it's all you and you receive all
[53:18] the glory we welcome you here this
[53:20] morning Lord I pray that anything that
[53:21] would hinder our thoughts our minds
[53:23] anything that would would hinders from
[53:25] receiving what you have for us Lord I
[53:27] pray that you would remove it Lord help
[53:29] us out to think about what we're going
[53:30] to do after service what we're going to
[53:31] do tomorrow let's think about you right
[53:34] now Lord lay everything aside Lord help
[53:37] us to lay ourselves aside
[53:39] that you could have preeminence in our
[53:40] lives this morning we thank you for in
[53:42] Jesus name amen you can be seated
[53:46] this morning if I'd like to to speak on
[53:49] this I've titled this from the tomb to
[53:52] the table
[53:56] Lazarus went from the tomb to the table
[54:00] Abraham said Serge we would see Jesus
[54:02] now just after many people had come to
[54:04] the feast because Lazarus had been
[54:06] raised from the dead that's why they
[54:08] came to the feast because Lazarus had
[54:10] been raised from the dead
[54:13] and the people come up to see Lazarus
[54:17] they came up to see Lazarus
[54:20] when you got a testimony people won't
[54:21] see you
[54:23] when God's done something in your life
[54:25] people want to hear you
[54:27] they want they want your testimony like
[54:29] brother Reid gave this morning when when
[54:31] God does something for you people want
[54:33] to hear about it in the the script and
[54:35] brother Brandon said people come to see
[54:36] Lazarus said they came to see Jesus too
[54:40] right
[54:42] so there's been a resurrection and
[54:44] followed by the feast and you know we we
[54:46] hear the same thing in the in the uh as
[54:49] we read The Prodigal Son the story of
[54:51] The Prodigal Son when the prodigal son
[54:53] comes home finds himself in a pig pen
[54:55] and he comes home and and the father
[54:56] says my son that was dead
[55:00] is now alive the fathers testifying
[55:02] there has been a resurrection so now
[55:04] let's prepare the feast
[55:06] there has to be a feast
[55:08] following a resurrection
[55:12] there will be a feast following a
[55:15] resurrection
[55:15] [Applause]
[55:17] in Mark 5 38 and he cometh to the house
[55:20] of the ruler of the synagogue and see
[55:22] seeth tumult and there that wept and
[55:25] welled greatly and when he come in he
[55:27] said unto them why maketh you this a do
[55:29] and Weep the damsel is not dead but
[55:31] she's sleepeth and they left him to
[55:33] scorn and when he put them all out he
[55:34] taken the father and the mother of the
[55:36] damsel and them that with him entered
[55:37] and where the damsel was laying
[55:40] and he took the damsel by the hand and
[55:42] said unto her to lithakumi which is
[55:45] interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise
[55:47] and straight away the damzilla rose and
[55:50] walked for she was of age of 12 years
[55:52] old and they were astonished with a
[55:54] great astonishment
[55:56] and he charged them straightly that no
[55:58] man should know it and commanded that
[55:59] something be given her to eat
[56:03] for some reason
[56:04] eating follows Resurrection
[56:09] eating follows Resurrection
[56:11] [Applause]
[56:13] and what we want to look at this morning
[56:14] is is not necessarily the resurrection
[56:17] of on the Rapture as much but when we
[56:20] look at the things in our lives you know
[56:22] we we you know I can imagine the the
[56:24] conversation down in Hell whenever
[56:25] Lazarus finally died you know before
[56:28] before he when he was sick and I'm sure
[56:31] Satan heard hey they've sent for Jesus
[56:33] to come if Jesus comes he'll heal him
[56:37] Jesus hadn't raised from any any from
[56:40] the dead yet
[56:41] death was Satan's strongest tool at this
[56:44] time
[56:46] he hadn't used it yet on one of Jesus's
[56:48] friends and Jesus
[56:49] and think and he thought he beat Jesus
[56:53] so I imagine that conversation in hell
[56:54] when something like Satan listen
[56:57] you know I I I've I've brought Lazarus
[57:00] all the way to the end he ain't got much
[57:02] breath left in him
[57:04] but they've sent for Jesus
[57:07] and he's not too far away
[57:10] what am I going to do
[57:13] tell death tell death come here I want
[57:15] to talk to him
[57:17] Satan tells death come here I want to
[57:19] talk to you
[57:20] I I need I need I need you now
[57:24] the healer's coming
[57:27] the Healer they didn't know him they
[57:29] didn't know him as a resurrection in
[57:31] life yet
[57:33] the healer's coming
[57:36] and when the Healer gets here it'll be
[57:39] too late
[57:41] when the Healer comes it'll be too late
[57:43] for him
[57:44] yeah Satan tells you that in your life
[57:46] every day
[57:48] it's too late
[57:52] there's no way out of this
[57:56] so when Jesus got there Mary and Martha
[57:59] said
[58:00] if you'd have been here he wouldn't have
[58:01] died
[58:02] there's many of you who's probably asked
[58:04] that about your loved ones that God took
[58:05] on God if you'd have been here
[58:10] he says I am still
[58:12] when your loved ones pass them
[58:15] comforting words it gives to you I am
[58:16] the resurrection in life
[58:19] doesn't matter what this natural body
[58:21] does
[58:25] but Jesus comes to the to the grave of
[58:27] Lazarus
[58:29] Lazarus was predestinated to be sick
[58:34] and to die
[58:36] he was predestinated to die
[58:39] before his time
[58:42] but he was predestinated to have two
[58:44] resurrections
[58:51] God placed something in
[58:54] in you before the foundation the world
[58:56] it doesn't matter what sickness comes
[58:58] into your life
[58:59] what what anything Satan puts in your
[59:01] life
[59:03] it doesn't matter
[59:05] it does it didn't matter what Satan did
[59:07] to Lazarus
[59:09] you know and what we want to look at
[59:11] this morning and we'll get into
[59:13] different Avenues of it but
[59:16] you know when you got to that point in
[59:19] your life you know Satan when you was in
[59:20] the world Satan didn't seem to bother
[59:22] you as much
[59:24] he didn't bother you as much you
[59:26] probably lived some of your healthiest
[59:27] days out in the world
[59:30] when you come into this message all hell
[59:33] turned against you you've been sick ever
[59:34] since you've been depressed you've had
[59:36] anxiety
[59:38] your kids left your husband left your
[59:41] wife left
[59:42] your family left you it just seems like
[59:44] the worst days of your life
[59:46] and God looks at you and says it's the
[59:47] Glorious Days of your life
[59:49] and Satan he's allowing Satan to put all
[59:52] this thing you know when you you give
[59:54] your heart to the Lord and you you
[59:55] received you come up in the watery grave
[59:58] as a as a a token of of the death burial
[1:00:01] and the resurrection you come up a new
[1:00:03] man
[1:00:05] when you come up a new man Satan's got
[1:00:07] one job is to put you in the grave
[1:00:09] and he knows he can't touch that see
[1:00:11] brother Brandon said he can't touch that
[1:00:13] seed
[1:00:15] until God's done with you just like job
[1:00:17] he can't take your life
[1:00:19] so there's other tombs and other graves
[1:00:22] in your life that Satan's going to try
[1:00:23] to put you in
[1:00:24] he's going to put you in a tomb of
[1:00:26] depression
[1:00:27] he's going to put you in a tomb of
[1:00:29] cancer
[1:00:31] a tomb of anxiety
[1:00:37] a tomb of all kinds of sickness in in
[1:00:39] things wrong in our lives
[1:00:42] a tomb of guilt a tomb of Shame a tomb
[1:00:45] of embarrassment
[1:00:47] there's so many tombs that Satan is
[1:00:49] going to do his best to lock you inside
[1:00:53] and he's going to roll the stone across
[1:00:58] that's his job
[1:01:01] would you expect him to do anything else
[1:01:05] well the brand of sin and condemnation
[1:01:07] by representation God just think many of
[1:01:09] these here I trust that every one of
[1:01:11] them are your children born of a spirit
[1:01:12] washed in the blood filled with the Holy
[1:01:15] Ghost ready for the coming
[1:01:16] and Satan can't get them that way to
[1:01:20] make them sin
[1:01:22] he can't get to them to make them doubt
[1:01:24] your word is wrong
[1:01:26] they go ahead and follow just to the
[1:01:28] letter
[1:01:32] but he tries to come on and flick their
[1:01:34] body because he knows their body is
[1:01:36] still sin
[1:01:37] but their soul is saved their body has
[1:01:40] got to go back to dust but their soul
[1:01:42] goes to God
[1:01:44] Satan can't touch it
[1:01:46] he knows he can't touch it
[1:01:49] but he's going to try to afflict that
[1:01:51] part when he can
[1:01:54] he's going to make you have bad days
[1:01:57] he's going to make your days you're
[1:01:59] going to actually question God God why
[1:02:01] me why is this stuff come upon me why is
[1:02:04] this on my family
[1:02:06] why did I have to lose my mother my
[1:02:09] father my son
[1:02:12] Jesus could have stopped the death of
[1:02:14] Lazarus
[1:02:17] he could have stopped it
[1:02:21] but Jesus know who Lazarus had the feast
[1:02:23] to go to
[1:02:24] and the only way he can make it to that
[1:02:26] Feast was through a resurrection
[1:02:31] all hell might think they have you
[1:02:35] foreign
[1:02:39] said this and brother Donnie read this
[1:02:40] quote I know my redeemer liveth
[1:02:44] I wrote it down when brother I was
[1:02:46] studying this at the time and it said
[1:02:47] and that's it it's in that hour friend
[1:02:50] it's at that time it's in that crucial
[1:02:52] crucifying hours that we see the
[1:02:55] resurrection
[1:02:57] it's at that time when God loves to
[1:02:59] display his grace it's that time when
[1:03:02] God likes to comfort his children
[1:03:06] sometimes we don't give God the time of
[1:03:08] day
[1:03:09] when everything's going good
[1:03:11] everything's going well in life life
[1:03:13] around us is is their jobs is good we're
[1:03:15] making good money our kids are in church
[1:03:17] everything looks good
[1:03:20] why is it at those times
[1:03:24] that we kind of push God off to the side
[1:03:26] when everything's going well why is it
[1:03:28] that God has to push us allow Satan in
[1:03:31] their life to push us to a certain point
[1:03:33] before we give him Fellowship
[1:03:35] why is it God has it has to get to the
[1:03:38] point get us to the point where we cry
[1:03:39] out to him
[1:03:43] God sometimes has to let some type of
[1:03:46] death come in your life and will allow
[1:03:48] Satan to bury you
[1:03:52] Lord why am I going through this
[1:03:54] depression
[1:03:55] why am I going through anxiety because
[1:03:57] you wouldn't talk to me when you weren't
[1:04:00] [Applause]
[1:04:02] why am I going through these things in
[1:04:03] my life
[1:04:05] why why are my my kids not saved because
[1:04:08] when they were you weren't talking to me
[1:04:11] you took it for granted
[1:04:15] there's so many things in our lives that
[1:04:18] God gives us blessings and when these
[1:04:20] blessings seem to come
[1:04:22] Lazarus was his friend
[1:04:26] Lazarus was a friend of God
[1:04:29] he was the friend of God
[1:04:33] but he allowed death to come into his
[1:04:35] life he let him he let him lay there and
[1:04:38] stink and rot
[1:04:43] whose fault
[1:04:45] just just like the blind man that was
[1:04:47] born blind Jesus said it's so the glory
[1:04:50] of God could be revealed
[1:04:52] it wasn't nobody's fault Lazarus didn't
[1:04:54] ask for this
[1:04:55] that's just family didn't ask for this
[1:04:57] but God wanted to show that he was the
[1:04:59] resurrection in life and he wants to
[1:05:01] show that in our life in so many ways in
[1:05:03] so many ways we won't let him come on
[1:05:06] why when these things come into our life
[1:05:08] we you know and I I don't mean to get
[1:05:11] ahead of myself but so many times we
[1:05:13] live we live from Camp to camp we live
[1:05:15] from from prayer line to prayer line we
[1:05:17] can't wait in four years for the next
[1:05:19] prayer line
[1:05:20] just something that you said you got
[1:05:22] delivered from in the last prayer line
[1:05:27] that's the only time we cry out to God
[1:05:29] that's when we're going through the
[1:05:30] prayer line and we Rejoice for a week or
[1:05:32] two
[1:05:35] and then we're right back in the in the
[1:05:37] mully grubs as they were as they say
[1:05:39] in two weeks
[1:05:46] he has a reason God has a reason for
[1:05:50] everything in your life
[1:05:52] God has a reason why you're going
[1:05:54] through the things that you're going
[1:05:55] through we look at sister Erica
[1:05:58] God's glory is being revealed whether
[1:06:00] you see it or not
[1:06:02] God's glory is being made known whether
[1:06:05] you see it or not don't look at symptoms
[1:06:08] don't look at circumstances
[1:06:12] Jesus told Martha I am the resident he
[1:06:14] will rise again
[1:06:16] she didn't get what he was saying
[1:06:19] she said she thought God Jesus was
[1:06:22] telling her he'll he'll come forth in
[1:06:23] the Rapture that ain't what Jesus was
[1:06:25] saying he'll come forth right now
[1:06:28] right now because I'm here and if that's
[1:06:31] Saint Jesus you claim lives in here
[1:06:35] we we say that quote we sing that song
[1:06:38] so much he became me that I became him
[1:06:40] and said he could become me
[1:06:44] it's the same life
[1:06:46] in you
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:49] if he's the resurrection in the Life are
[1:06:51] not you the resurrection in life
[1:06:54] can you not speak to that thing that's
[1:06:57] inside you holding you down
[1:06:59] can you not say come forth
[1:07:05] his Direction Resurrection in life and
[1:07:07] you say when you receive the holy ghost
[1:07:09] that his life came in and lives in you
[1:07:12] his life lives in you you say
[1:07:16] you testify
[1:07:18] Jesus lives in here
[1:07:21] are you portraying what he portrays
[1:07:27] people look at you in your life and the
[1:07:29] way you live your life
[1:07:32] you say Jesus lives in here
[1:07:35] and then you have a bad day and you fall
[1:07:37] all to pieces
[1:07:40] you don't know which way to go which way
[1:07:42] to turn I've got too many pill bottles
[1:07:44] to choose from I don't know which one's
[1:07:47] going to help me
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:52] we try to fix it all first ourselves
[1:07:55] we try to fix it he's Last Resort
[1:07:59] in your mind you're on your deathbed and
[1:08:01] you've pulled a toenail
[1:08:07] we tried to magnify
[1:08:09] issues in our life they're so big and to
[1:08:12] God says there's nothing so if Christ
[1:08:14] isn't here look at your problem through
[1:08:17] his eyes
[1:08:18] look at the issues in your life through
[1:08:21] God's eyes it's nothing
[1:08:24] it's nothing
[1:08:27] looking at sister Erica through God's
[1:08:28] eyes is nothing
[1:08:31] absolutely nothing
[1:08:35] and if there's God that same God Lives
[1:08:37] in You
[1:08:38] in his fully manifesting his life in you
[1:08:41] every problem that can you come across
[1:08:44] whether it be cancer or whether it be a
[1:08:46] headache
[1:08:48] it's nothing
[1:08:54] it's hard to understand so many times
[1:08:56] it's hard to understand
[1:08:58] God's will in us will for in our lives
[1:09:00] it's hard to understand Lord why am I in
[1:09:02] this tomb
[1:09:04] why am I in here why is the stone rolled
[1:09:07] across the entrance of this tomb
[1:09:12] you don't have to wait for Jesus to come
[1:09:14] from four days away
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:17] he's right here
[1:09:19] he's right here
[1:09:24] you know we want to we want to put a put
[1:09:26] an Epitaph on everybody's tomb now
[1:09:29] if Satan could put one on your life what
[1:09:31] would it say
[1:09:33] he believed the doctor's report
[1:09:36] he's going to roll the stone in front of
[1:09:38] your tomb
[1:09:39] put a seal on it and across the top
[1:09:42] she believed what the doctor said
[1:09:46] he believed
[1:09:48] ever what everybody was saying about him
[1:09:52] he failed
[1:09:54] to see God
[1:09:56] moving in his life
[1:10:00] but when we let God work
[1:10:02] what's the Epitaph say across the top
[1:10:07] he once was here but now he ain't
[1:10:11] he came out
[1:10:13] she once was here but now she's risen
[1:10:19] God's got epitaphs on empty tombs
[1:10:23] there's an empty tomb in your life that
[1:10:25] once was depression
[1:10:28] I don't know why I'm hitting depression
[1:10:29] I don't have no idea
[1:10:33] there's a empty tomb that was guilt
[1:10:38] there's an empty tomb that was shame
[1:10:40] an embarrassment
[1:10:42] and across the top it says she was here
[1:10:46] but now she ain't
[1:10:54] you know there's in studying this I got
[1:10:57] to study
[1:10:59] you know the the things we look at all
[1:11:02] this things in our life we want to we
[1:11:05] want to get down and pray or we want to
[1:11:06] call so and so and we want to get laid
[1:11:08] hands on we come up here 14 times in two
[1:11:10] months at brother Donnie lay hands on us
[1:11:13] have the brothers lay hands on us and
[1:11:14] pray and you know and you know I'm stuck
[1:11:17] in this tune I can't get out I can't get
[1:11:18] out I can't get out
[1:11:21] and what did Jesus say to do when you're
[1:11:24] on driest came to him
[1:11:26] what did he tell him
[1:11:29] only
[1:11:30] believe
[1:11:34] only believe
[1:11:37] there's a lot of I don't mean to be rude
[1:11:41] but when you come up here
[1:11:44] 14 times in two months for the same
[1:11:46] problem there's a lot of unbelief going
[1:11:47] on
[1:11:49] there's a lot of doubt
[1:11:51] there's a lot of worry
[1:11:53] in your life going on God can't work
[1:11:56] through it
[1:11:58] only believe it's that simple
[1:12:01] how do you think Jairus felt when they
[1:12:03] come to him said don't trouble him no
[1:12:05] more
[1:12:06] don't trouble him no more she's already
[1:12:08] dead
[1:12:10] don't trouble him
[1:12:14] Jesus said only believe
[1:12:18] only believe in what he did when he got
[1:12:19] there he cast all the doubt out get out
[1:12:23] he's still casting doubt and worry out
[1:12:26] he's still casting unbelief
[1:12:28] they laughed him to scorn when she's
[1:12:30] she's only asleep
[1:12:32] why he saw the problem through God's
[1:12:35] eyes they saw the problem through their
[1:12:37] eyes
[1:12:40] brother Branham said and Look Away to
[1:12:42] Jesus but his only daughter
[1:12:44] lay at the point of death and he had to
[1:12:46] go but when he found him he found out
[1:12:48] that he was the resurrection in life
[1:12:51] when he said for him a runner come and
[1:12:52] said don't trouble the master for the
[1:12:54] girls already dead
[1:12:56] in his little heart almost failed
[1:13:00] Satan tells you there's no way out of
[1:13:02] this grave don't trouble him no more
[1:13:03] you're here for good
[1:13:06] only thing that'll fix you maybe some
[1:13:08] pills go to the doctor
[1:13:11] because you're in a situation here that
[1:13:13] you can't get out of
[1:13:17] that's the same spirit
[1:13:19] that Satan was using back then he still
[1:13:21] uses it today unbelief doubt and worry
[1:13:27] but Jesus said to him said did I not say
[1:13:30] did you not hear me the first time
[1:13:34] if you'll only believe
[1:13:36] you'll see the glory of God Jesus found
[1:13:39] out he could raise up the driest found
[1:13:41] out he could raise up the Dead when he
[1:13:43] looked at Jesus
[1:13:45] wow
[1:13:46] Don't Take Your Eyes Off Jesus
[1:13:50] Don't Take Your Eyes Off him
[1:13:53] no matter what your problem is no matter
[1:13:56] what situation how sick you are you may
[1:13:58] be living you might be on your deathbed
[1:14:00] right now doctors might give you up it
[1:14:03] doesn't matter he said only believe
[1:14:06] keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:14:09] if thou canists believe if you go search
[1:14:11] how many times brother Branham says that
[1:14:13] I only believe and if thou canst believe
[1:14:18] we need to put that on repeat
[1:14:20] over and over and over
[1:14:22] it's that simple
[1:14:24] we complicated it's like buying
[1:14:27] something from Ikea and trying to read
[1:14:28] the the French instructions on it
[1:14:32] why would you do that when you can come
[1:14:34] to the front page it's got English
[1:14:37] we try to complicate things
[1:14:41] the hungry looked to him and found
[1:14:44] sustaining food for all life
[1:14:46] that was natural the hungry spiritual
[1:14:49] can look to him and find out he's the
[1:14:51] bread of life the dying Thief look to
[1:14:53] see
[1:14:54] what he could see and found in Jesus his
[1:14:56] pardon Remember Me Lord will now cometh
[1:14:58] to thy kingdom Jesus said today Thou
[1:15:00] shalt be with me in Paradise
[1:15:02] that's what he saw in the hour of his
[1:15:04] death the sick looked at him and saw the
[1:15:07] Healer the blind looked and could see
[1:15:10] depends on what you're looking at now
[1:15:16] your situation might
[1:15:18] be all the way up to the the final point
[1:15:21] and you think it's over
[1:15:25] Lazarus family probably thought it was
[1:15:27] over
[1:15:29] you know brother Jimmy Whitson came back
[1:15:31] there was talking to me a while ago and
[1:15:34] he told me he said we was talking about
[1:15:36] that and he said well Joey so I can
[1:15:38] imagine there to the fiery furnace when
[1:15:40] they walked in he said I bet when they
[1:15:42] were walking in that furnace Shadrach
[1:15:44] probably looked at Mesa and said meshech
[1:15:46] it ain't over
[1:15:48] it ain't over
[1:15:51] what do you think when Jesus
[1:15:53] when they killed him on the cross and
[1:15:55] they laid him in the Tomb I imagine God
[1:15:57] looked at them angels and said it ain't
[1:15:59] over
[1:16:01] it ain't over when you're at your your
[1:16:03] worst point in your life
[1:16:05] it ain't over
[1:16:07] doctors report can say what they want to
[1:16:09] say we're giving you three months it
[1:16:11] ain't over right there's still a
[1:16:14] resurrection
[1:16:16] and I don't mean a natural Resurrection
[1:16:20] I'm in a resurrection from that that
[1:16:23] tomb you're in right now
[1:16:25] whatever it is
[1:16:27] it ain't over
[1:16:29] it ain't over till God says it's over
[1:16:31] and to a son and daughter of God it's
[1:16:33] never over
[1:16:38] you know we
[1:16:40] we have a part to do
[1:16:43] as I was saying earlier when Jesus told
[1:16:45] Mary and Martha
[1:16:47] you have a part to do
[1:16:49] he told him to roll the stone away
[1:16:52] you roll the stone away you want your
[1:16:54] brother resurrected you have a part to
[1:16:55] do
[1:16:57] are we doing our part
[1:17:00] are we pushing stones
[1:17:04] are we pushing stones for those in our
[1:17:07] lives
[1:17:11] Lazarus wasn't coming out
[1:17:13] until they've done what Jesus told them
[1:17:17] Jesus told him you pushed the stone away
[1:17:20] Humanity has to get involved
[1:17:23] you want to sit back and you let God do
[1:17:25] it all you wanted they wanted they could
[1:17:28] have probably thought maybe Jesus was
[1:17:29] going to speak and that stone was going
[1:17:31] to move or maybe Jesus was going to
[1:17:33] speak and Lazarus was going to walk
[1:17:34] through the stone Jesus said you do your
[1:17:36] part
[1:17:37] you remove the doubt
[1:17:40] you remove the worry
[1:17:42] you quit looking at their symptoms
[1:17:46] you know there's so many times when
[1:17:48] brother Donnie gets up here and he'll
[1:17:49] he'll say we'll give you an update on
[1:17:51] sister Erica
[1:17:53] you know when he'll say things
[1:17:56] and I've done determined in my mind
[1:17:59] I'm not praying for sister Erica again
[1:18:02] come on
[1:18:04] come on I'm praising for sister Erica
[1:18:12] I praise
[1:18:13] I'm praising for brother Bob Blevins I'm
[1:18:16] praising for Jerry Phillips I'm praising
[1:18:18] for those that have needs in their life
[1:18:20] will you ask God you only have to ask
[1:18:22] him one time
[1:18:23] then you start pushing the stone
[1:18:25] they asked him said Lord
[1:18:28] I know whatever you say you'll do it he
[1:18:30] says push the stone away
[1:18:33] whatever you say and if you say that in
[1:18:35] your life you said Jesus whatever is in
[1:18:37] my life whatever's in that my family has
[1:18:40] need of
[1:18:42] whatever you ask and Jesus might tell
[1:18:44] you will push the stone away
[1:18:48] in other words push the worry away
[1:18:52] push the doubt away
[1:18:53] push circumstances away push symptoms
[1:18:56] away
[1:18:58] you don't you don't look at that person
[1:19:00] and think man they look so bad
[1:19:02] don't look at that person that hasn't
[1:19:03] been to church in six years and you
[1:19:05] think they've gone too far
[1:19:08] push the stone away
[1:19:11] use faith
[1:19:14] use faith and push that stone away
[1:19:19] well Brian said believe it's not this I
[1:19:20] can see him walking down through that
[1:19:22] place there to the Grave he said take ye
[1:19:25] the stone away
[1:19:26] looked like he'd have been a gentleman
[1:19:31] he'd have took it away himself but he
[1:19:33] asked them women to why you got your
[1:19:37] part to do
[1:19:39] and they took this Stone the stink was
[1:19:41] so bad they was about to have suffocate
[1:19:44] there on account of that a dead human
[1:19:46] body
[1:19:48] then I can see him straighten his little
[1:19:50] self up said father I think thee that
[1:19:52] thou Hearst me always
[1:19:57] I've read that scripture
[1:19:59] in my life probably a hundred and three
[1:20:01] four hundred times
[1:20:03] and it just struck me when I was reading
[1:20:05] it
[1:20:07] that he didn't say Lord I Thank you that
[1:20:09] you hears me for his own benefit
[1:20:12] he said he wanted them to hear him say
[1:20:15] it
[1:20:16] he wanted them unbelievers
[1:20:29] we'll give him security officer duties
[1:20:35] we said Lord he said
[1:20:37] I thank thee that thou Harris me but
[1:20:40] Jesus said that wasn't
[1:20:42] I wasn't saying that
[1:20:44] because I know that you know that I'm
[1:20:46] thankful
[1:20:48] that's what he said God I know you know
[1:20:49] that I'm thankful
[1:20:52] but I wasn't saying it for me
[1:20:55] I was saying it for them
[1:21:00] sometimes people need you
[1:21:03] they need to hear you say
[1:21:05] how grateful you are to him
[1:21:08] sometimes they need to hear you praise
[1:21:10] him
[1:21:11] because it might lift them up
[1:21:14] it might give them faith
[1:21:20] that's why I love here brother Daryl
[1:21:22] Ward pray
[1:21:24] I love to hear Brother Daryl pray
[1:21:25] because it picks me up
[1:21:28] it lifts me up
[1:21:29] I know how he feels about to God but
[1:21:32] when I hear him telling God
[1:21:34] how he feels
[1:21:35] it does something for me
[1:21:38] it gives me Faith it removes all doubt
[1:21:41] it removes all worry
[1:21:44] it's something
[1:21:46] I want no side you're on
[1:21:50] I want to know what team you're on
[1:21:53] so sometimes I need to hear you cheering
[1:21:56] for that team
[1:21:58] here are so many people sometimes
[1:22:00] there's people I can tell you right now
[1:22:02] in church
[1:22:04] that I've never saw him or heard and say
[1:22:06] Amen one time
[1:22:08] and that is sad
[1:22:10] that's sad
[1:22:13] look I mean you should do that every
[1:22:15] morning you get up yeah
[1:22:17] let alone the church
[1:22:26] he said father I think thou Hearst me
[1:22:28] but for those that stand by is why I
[1:22:30] said that he'd already seen the vision
[1:22:32] he knew what was going to happen
[1:22:34] and then he cried with a loud voice and
[1:22:36] screamed and said Lazarus come forth
[1:22:38] he said I believe brother if he hadn't
[1:22:40] called him specifically by name I
[1:22:42] believe the general Resurrection would
[1:22:44] have took place
[1:22:45] that's what I think about him that's
[1:22:47] right I believe the resurrection of
[1:22:50] every dead thing
[1:22:51] that ever died would have come out of
[1:22:54] the Grave if he just said come forth
[1:22:57] every living thing that had died not
[1:23:00] people
[1:23:02] he didn't say every person he said every
[1:23:04] living thing why he was the creator
[1:23:08] brother Branham said when Jesus came
[1:23:10] down to the grave and he wept
[1:23:13] the man Jesus wept
[1:23:16] and God took over
[1:23:19] the Creator was now speaking
[1:23:22] the Creator said Lazarus come forth the
[1:23:26] Creator in your life can say come forth
[1:23:29] come out of that grave the Creator and
[1:23:31] you can say roll back to Stone
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:43] I took this note down here when I was
[1:23:45] studying that brother Brandon is talking
[1:23:48] about
[1:23:48] this woman praying for this woman with
[1:23:50] cancer
[1:23:52] in that and when he preached go tail
[1:23:55] he said death lays at the door Faith at
[1:23:57] the next
[1:23:59] death lays at one door
[1:24:01] Faithfully he's at the next
[1:24:04] God roll away the stone
[1:24:07] and let Faith take over
[1:24:11] roll away the Stone May the cancer leave
[1:24:15] her in Jesus name amen
[1:24:17] as simple as that death is at this door
[1:24:22] faith is at this door
[1:24:25] faith is what Rose the stone away
[1:24:29] faith is what rode the stone away he
[1:24:31] didn't say death is at this door life is
[1:24:33] at this door he said Faith why you have
[1:24:36] to have faith you have to have Humanity
[1:24:38] get involved in what God is wanting God
[1:24:42] has a purpose and it involves you
[1:24:44] amen it involves every one of us
[1:24:50] we have a part to do we have to push
[1:24:53] back to Stone you know
[1:24:55] I was reading this and I don't know how
[1:24:57] it came up in my studies but it did I
[1:25:00] got to think in the Seraph Phoenician
[1:25:01] woman
[1:25:04] I was wondering where that persisted
[1:25:08] if God himself
[1:25:10] told you it ain't for you
[1:25:15] Lord I I need this nope
[1:25:18] getting for you
[1:25:20] that's what he told her
[1:25:23] Lord my my daughters got a devil
[1:25:27] can you come deliver
[1:25:30] I'm not sent to you
[1:25:32] I'm sent to the house of Israel and
[1:25:34] you're not a part of that
[1:25:37] but what'd she do
[1:25:39] she pushed harder on the stone
[1:25:41] she began to push the stone
[1:25:46] so what did he tell her again
[1:25:49] she asked him again
[1:25:52] it's not meat for me to give the dogs
[1:25:57] of the children's bread because we know
[1:25:59] the Bible says healing is the children's
[1:26:01] bread
[1:26:02] it's not meat for me to give
[1:26:05] the children's rates of the dogs
[1:26:07] what she do she pushed some more
[1:26:10] she never quit pushing God himself said
[1:26:13] you can't have it
[1:26:15] and she can't pushing
[1:26:19] even so
[1:26:21] the dogs that eat the crumbs give me a
[1:26:23] crumb Lord
[1:26:25] a crumb's law all you need for healing
[1:26:27] is one crumb
[1:26:28] if you need healing in your life from
[1:26:30] the bread of life you need one crumb
[1:26:34] you just push that stone you keep
[1:26:36] pushing that stone if God says no push
[1:26:38] the stone
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:42] if God says you can't have it push the
[1:26:45] stone
[1:26:48] I promise you when you push that stone
[1:26:50] there's going to be somebody standing on
[1:26:52] the other side that says come forth
[1:26:55] when that stone gets removed
[1:26:58] somebody's going to be saying come forth
[1:27:02] faith has removed all doubt
[1:27:06] that's all that stone is in your life is
[1:27:08] doubt worry disappointment circumstances
[1:27:12] symptoms doctors reports
[1:27:14] bank accounts so they're in the red
[1:27:18] push the stone
[1:27:31] right you know sometimes we get to the
[1:27:32] point where we feel like
[1:27:34] so much on me
[1:27:37] there's so much on me I can't I try to
[1:27:39] pray
[1:27:41] I can't
[1:27:44] I can't get through
[1:27:48] Legion had two thousand demons
[1:27:53] 2 000 demons
[1:27:59] that seed well brother Bradham said
[1:28:03] Satan can never
[1:28:05] get that seed
[1:28:08] he'll never get the seed of God ever
[1:28:13] there might have been two thousand
[1:28:14] demons on his body in his mind
[1:28:17] there wasn't a single one touching that
[1:28:19] seed
[1:28:21] Jesus heard that seed cry out from
[1:28:23] across the sea
[1:28:26] he heard the seed call out for help
[1:28:30] that seed had enough to push a stone
[1:28:34] how many members the testimony that Josh
[1:28:36] Bennett gave here or the quote he was
[1:28:39] talking about brother random of South
[1:28:41] Africa about a week before brother Josh
[1:28:42] Bennett was here
[1:28:44] I had I was doing some study and that
[1:28:46] quote came up and I read that quote
[1:28:47] where brother Brandon was talking about
[1:28:49] that little boy in Africa
[1:28:51] that walked around all fours he was born
[1:28:53] that way they had a chain around his
[1:28:55] neck
[1:28:55] he thought he was an animal walk like an
[1:28:58] animal
[1:28:59] had a chain around his neck
[1:29:08] he comes up
[1:29:12] but Ben said sometime before this little
[1:29:14] Fella's brother had fell fell off a
[1:29:17] a goat or a cow or something and
[1:29:20] hurt his knees and crippled him
[1:29:26] that little fella
[1:29:31] mentally challenged
[1:29:34] didn't have a sane cell in his brain was
[1:29:36] born that way
[1:29:38] when he comes up for prayer brother bam
[1:29:41] said you're not here for you
[1:29:45] you're thinking of your brother
[1:29:51] you're thinking of your brother
[1:29:58] we can have compassion for one another
[1:30:02] and you get somebody
[1:30:04] that's totally out of the right mind
[1:30:08] I have such a love
[1:30:10] they come before the prophet and they're
[1:30:12] crying their heart he couldn't even talk
[1:30:15] brother Brandon read his heart
[1:30:17] God discerned his heart
[1:30:20] he wanted his brother healed
[1:30:24] he come up there to push a stone
[1:30:28] he come up to remove all doubt in all
[1:30:30] word he wouldn't hear God healed him
[1:30:32] brother Branham said after your brother
[1:30:35] is healed
[1:30:38] that little fellow stood straight up
[1:30:40] mother Brown said I helped him up
[1:30:44] foreign
[1:30:47] for one another
[1:30:50] sometimes something that might seem
[1:30:52] simple to you somebody's problem might
[1:30:54] be simple to you it might be serious to
[1:30:56] them
[1:31:00] I think so often
[1:31:03] we tend to hold Stones closed
[1:31:10] we hold Stones closed to people that
[1:31:13] need Deliverance
[1:31:16] you might say brother Joe how do you do
[1:31:18] that
[1:31:21] you lean on that stone you hold it tight
[1:31:24] you ain't gonna believe it sister
[1:31:25] so-and-so did
[1:31:27] you ain't gonna believe what brother
[1:31:30] so-and-so did
[1:31:35] they met a lot laid on their bed at
[1:31:38] night
[1:31:39] weeping and crying and forgiveness
[1:31:41] repent repenting to God for everything
[1:31:43] they've done for the situation
[1:31:46] and you're out there dragging it out of
[1:31:48] hell
[1:31:50] you're pulling it right out of hell
[1:31:51] where God put it for them
[1:32:00] when God forgives something
[1:32:02] he puts it in hell
[1:32:04] when you talk about it you took it out
[1:32:06] now you own it
[1:32:08] you own it
[1:32:12] people are needing Deliverance
[1:32:14] people are trying to to claw out of out
[1:32:17] of graves of guilt and shame and
[1:32:19] embarrassment and we're sitting there
[1:32:20] stomping them back in get back in there
[1:32:22] you're not going hey let me tell you
[1:32:23] what brother so-and-so did let me tell
[1:32:25] you what sister so-and-so did and
[1:32:26] they're sitting there trying to get life
[1:32:30] and you're pushing them back in
[1:32:34] where have we got if we want to take a
[1:32:37] rapture
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:39] if we want to take a Rapture in our life
[1:32:41] and here we are trying to keep brothers
[1:32:42] and sisters from taking one
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:46] you might not look at it that way but
[1:32:48] that's exactly what we're doing
[1:32:51] they want a Rapture they want
[1:32:53] Deliverance in their life and we're
[1:32:55] keeping them from it
[1:32:59] you know as I was talking to
[1:33:02] somewhere before
[1:33:04] sometimes we can be so unforgiving
[1:33:08] so unforgiving
[1:33:11] we're going to get back to if Christ's
[1:33:12] life is in you you're going to be like
[1:33:14] Christ
[1:33:16] will people Elevate themselves so high
[1:33:19] above God
[1:33:22] they're up here
[1:33:24] they're above God
[1:33:26] because when they person asks for
[1:33:28] forgiveness
[1:33:30] and God says I'm faithful and just to
[1:33:32] forgive
[1:33:33] but you can't because you're so higher
[1:33:35] than God
[1:33:36] you can't forgive
[1:33:39] you said what will Joe I have forgiven
[1:33:42] are forgiven
[1:33:45] I hope so
[1:33:47] how come when they show up at the
[1:33:49] restaurant you're at you can't believe
[1:33:50] they had the audacity didn't show up
[1:33:56] it's not forgiveness
[1:33:58] well Graham said you'd be able to put
[1:33:59] your arm around and love them
[1:34:01] I don't care what they did to you
[1:34:03] right it doesn't matter what they did to
[1:34:05] you
[1:34:07] if you can't forgive you ain't going
[1:34:10] you'll never take a Rapture with
[1:34:12] unforgiveness
[1:34:13] what brother brother Don he said here
[1:34:15] about two or three months ago he said if
[1:34:16] you got unforgiveness in your heart and
[1:34:18] the Rapture goes place he said if Jesus
[1:34:20] was to put you at the Judgment bar you'd
[1:34:22] send that person to hell
[1:34:25] because they wronged you here in life
[1:34:29] unforgiveness is a cancer
[1:34:34] it destroys relationships
[1:34:36] it destroys friends
[1:34:39] and it's not not be that way if Christ's
[1:34:41] life is in you you will forgive as
[1:34:43] Christ for your brother Brian said if if
[1:34:46] you can't forgive God won't forgive you
[1:34:50] if you can't forgive
[1:34:52] God will forgive you
[1:34:57] you know when people they like to
[1:35:01] they like to tell people's
[1:35:03] problems
[1:35:06] under the name of Prayer
[1:35:10] under the name of Prayer
[1:35:13] they want to go tell everybody's details
[1:35:16] on all the juicy things
[1:35:18] that so and so did brother so and so did
[1:35:20] sister so-and-so whatever they want to
[1:35:22] go tell that
[1:35:25] I was just I was just telling them so
[1:35:28] so they would know how to pray
[1:35:31] not only your gossip you're deceitful
[1:35:34] you're a gossip and you're deceitful
[1:35:37] what did Jesus say only believe God
[1:35:40] don't need you to know details for your
[1:35:42] prayer to work
[1:35:44] amen he don't need you to know details
[1:35:56] that's free
[1:36:00] I'm gonna move on before we get in
[1:36:03] trouble
[1:36:05] but Jesus said I don't if you don't
[1:36:07] forgive every man his trespasses from
[1:36:08] your heart neither does your heavenly
[1:36:10] father forgive you
[1:36:11] brother Brown said that in the church in
[1:36:13] its condition
[1:36:17] do we realize the power
[1:36:21] that lays in US
[1:36:23] the power that you have
[1:36:26] when Jesus told me that when they
[1:36:28] marveled at the works that he done
[1:36:30] they marveled him when he when he cursed
[1:36:32] the Fig Tree and then he did the
[1:36:34] different things they marveled he said
[1:36:35] Marvel not
[1:36:36] for Greater Works than this shall you do
[1:36:39] for I'll be with you even in you
[1:36:42] I'll go away but I'll come again when I
[1:36:44] come again I'll be in you
[1:36:46] and this power it was dropped on 120 in
[1:36:48] the upper room
[1:36:51] the power that's in you today is the
[1:36:53] same power that came on them in the
[1:36:56] upper room
[1:36:57] it's got the same strength that hasn't
[1:36:59] lessened
[1:37:00] it hasn't diluted over time
[1:37:04] it's the same power
[1:37:07] the same power that when Peter walked by
[1:37:09] the crippled man
[1:37:11] in a shadow went across him
[1:37:15] Peter never entered a word
[1:37:19] and I believe this bride will get to the
[1:37:21] point before the Rapture takes place
[1:37:24] when she will speak with his words
[1:37:28] she will speak the word with his words
[1:37:30] English language that comes off the
[1:37:32] tongue of son and daughter of God in
[1:37:34] this bride
[1:37:36] when it's anointed
[1:37:38] it has the same power as God had when he
[1:37:40] said let there be light
[1:37:42] it's the same power you will speak you
[1:37:44] will say come forth you will say push
[1:37:46] away the stone
[1:37:49] there's no nothing that hell will bring
[1:37:51] against you no power that hell has that
[1:37:54] they will bring against you that you
[1:37:56] can't say be gone
[1:37:59] Glory we will get to that point
[1:38:03] you can believe it or not
[1:38:05] but if that power is in you it will have
[1:38:08] to manifest itself
[1:38:15] I found that so striking the night when
[1:38:17] brother Donnie was preaching about the
[1:38:19] The Mercy Seat
[1:38:20] how brother Brandon was was talking
[1:38:22] about how God put the mercy seat on our
[1:38:25] in the human heart
[1:38:27] that's where he sits on that Mercy Seat
[1:38:30] and you say that God dwells in there
[1:38:34] how how awesome it was for them after
[1:38:36] the veil was written too in the temple
[1:38:39] before then you couldn't go into the
[1:38:41] holiest of holies only that the priest
[1:38:43] could go in there and they had to be
[1:38:44] dressed a certain way they had to be
[1:38:45] washed a certain way they had to carry a
[1:38:47] certain kind of incense before they went
[1:38:49] in there and when when Jesus died and
[1:38:51] when he said I go away and I come back
[1:38:53] again and I'll be with you even in you
[1:38:55] I'll be sitting on the mercy seat of
[1:38:57] your heart
[1:38:58] before when you couldn't go into the
[1:39:00] holiest of holies
[1:39:01] now the holiest of holies came into man
[1:39:05] it's now in you
[1:39:08] you have all access
[1:39:12] anything you need you don't have to
[1:39:15] say a certain prayer do your thing a
[1:39:17] certain way like my Irish do
[1:39:20] I had to throw it in there for something
[1:39:23] Michael Bailey
[1:39:25] you don't have to do those things
[1:39:27] it's free access
[1:39:29] because it's in here
[1:39:31] you have everything you need for a
[1:39:35] resurrection
[1:39:36] you have everything you need for health
[1:39:40] I would let you prosper and be in good
[1:39:43] health everything you need for that is
[1:39:45] right here I don't care what your
[1:39:46] symptoms are I don't care what your
[1:39:48] circumstances are I don't care how
[1:39:49] depressed you are kind of anxiety I
[1:39:51] don't care if your children are lost I
[1:39:53] don't care if your parents are lost God
[1:39:55] said the prophet said you claim them
[1:39:57] you claim them and then you believe in
[1:40:00] the promise
[1:40:02] it doesn't matter how far away they are
[1:40:04] from God
[1:40:05] it doesn't matter what they say about
[1:40:07] this message it's what God Said start
[1:40:10] pushing the stone away and believe that
[1:40:12] the power that is in here will be the
[1:40:15] one that speaks come forth
[1:40:18] thank you
[1:40:24] brother Branham said in the deity of
[1:40:26] deity of Jesus Christ
[1:40:28] let the fundament fundamentalists let
[1:40:31] them people who deny the power of God
[1:40:32] say it's wrong but that same power that
[1:40:35] spoke the world into existence is in
[1:40:37] those people that got the Holy Ghost
[1:40:39] the voice that said let there be life
[1:40:42] let there be light
[1:40:45] right
[1:40:46] Let There Be Waters
[1:40:49] Let There Be man Let There Be animals
[1:40:51] the same God that created all that
[1:40:55] there's not a Lesser God in here
[1:40:57] it's the same one
[1:41:02] it's the same one
[1:41:04] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:41:06] all the Christ was he poured into the
[1:41:08] bride
[1:41:09] right
[1:41:10] so you have it whenever God pours
[1:41:13] himself into Christ and when it got
[1:41:15] poured from Christ and the bride you
[1:41:17] didn't get a weaker portion you got a
[1:41:19] portion but that portion that you got is
[1:41:20] strong as it was in God before he poured
[1:41:23] it into Christ
[1:41:29] go listen if nobody's ever listened to
[1:41:31] the the the sermon I think in 49 it was
[1:41:34] well the brand preached a sermon in 49
[1:41:37] called faith
[1:41:38] simple simple and that's why I I I like
[1:41:41] things I bet I've listened to that
[1:41:43] sermon probably more than any other
[1:41:44] sermon of other brand has got that in
[1:41:46] the message is faith
[1:41:48] if that don't if it don't pick you up
[1:41:50] and give you faith and start pushing
[1:41:52] stones and having resurrections there
[1:41:54] ain't nothing in this message that will
[1:41:55] do it for you then
[1:41:57] if that won't do it for you
[1:42:00] every message he preached
[1:42:03] was the power of God
[1:42:05] every message he preached will give you
[1:42:07] faith
[1:42:09] or to remove all doubt
[1:42:15] says that's right men and women it's
[1:42:17] time that we found that we found out who
[1:42:19] you are the devil is trying to hide you
[1:42:21] back
[1:42:22] tell you that you're a little cowed
[1:42:24] around something you're not your sons
[1:42:26] and daughters of God the deity is not in
[1:42:28] heaven it's in you
[1:42:31] I know you think I'm crazy but let me
[1:42:33] tell you something brother when you
[1:42:35] realize almighty God lives in you
[1:42:37] immortal life my life I give Zoe the
[1:42:40] life of God is in the human being
[1:42:45] we've got no reason we've got no reason
[1:42:47] to not believe
[1:42:49] we've got no reason to not have faith
[1:42:52] the life of God is in you
[1:42:55] are we using that
[1:42:57] are we are we submitting ourselves to
[1:42:59] that
[1:43:00] it's not you controlling it
[1:43:03] you know you hear people say I I can't
[1:43:05] I've had friends of mine I can't live it
[1:43:08] say I can't I can't live this what's not
[1:43:10] up to you to live
[1:43:12] it's not up to you to live
[1:43:14] it's let him live through you
[1:43:17] you couldn't live this message as you if
[1:43:18] you tried like brother Reid was saying
[1:43:20] earlier he said I tried and tried the
[1:43:21] more I tried to worship God
[1:43:24] you can't try you have to let God do the
[1:43:27] living you do the submitting that's why
[1:43:30] in James when it says resist the devil
[1:43:32] and flee from you he tells you to submit
[1:43:34] yourself first to God
[1:43:36] first
[1:43:38] if you haven't submitted he's going to
[1:43:40] flee from you
[1:43:43] he's not those stones are gonna if you
[1:43:45] haven't submitted to God you start
[1:43:46] commanding stones to be to roll to be
[1:43:48] pushed back
[1:43:50] it ain't going to happen
[1:43:51] if you haven't submitted yourself to God
[1:43:53] because you're trying to do it you're
[1:43:55] trying to work it up
[1:43:58] you don't have to work God up he's
[1:43:59] already there
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:02] you don't have to go lay hands on your
[1:44:04] battery outside in your car every time
[1:44:07] you start your car Lord
[1:44:09] I pray that this this car will start
[1:44:12] we don't even think about it anymore do
[1:44:14] we
[1:44:15] you don't have to think about breathing
[1:44:16] when you wake up in the morning
[1:44:20] that's the Simplicity of God that's how
[1:44:22] simple God wants to make it don't think
[1:44:24] about breathing when you get up Just
[1:44:26] Breathe
[1:44:28] don't think about healing when you're
[1:44:31] sick just be healed
[1:44:34] don't think about being delivered be
[1:44:36] delivered
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:45] you think Satan hasn't heard that voice
[1:44:46] before
[1:44:48] when the power of God comes in your life
[1:44:50] and you speak to that problem in your
[1:44:52] life he's heard that voice before he
[1:44:54] heard it at the grave of Lazarus he
[1:44:56] heard it when Jesus went into hell and
[1:44:58] took the keys from him he heard it when
[1:45:00] God when when all the Through the Ages
[1:45:03] when God spoke to the prophet
[1:45:06] when the prophets were speaking it was
[1:45:08] God speaking through them he heard it
[1:45:10] then he knows that voice
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:12] he knows when it's him and he knows when
[1:45:14] it's you
[1:45:17] he's no dummy
[1:45:20] the Bible says he's a worthy adversary
[1:45:23] of this flesh
[1:45:26] but to God he's no more than like
[1:45:28] brother Melvin knock that thing off my
[1:45:29] shoulder
[1:45:32] that's all right that's all he is to God
[1:45:34] you're bugging me
[1:45:42] well we got to get to the point where we
[1:45:44] speak
[1:45:49] if you don't
[1:45:50] we got to have confidence in what's been
[1:45:52] given to us
[1:45:54] that's faith
[1:45:56] Lord I don't know how you're going to do
[1:45:58] it
[1:45:58] I don't know when you're going to do it
[1:46:01] but I believe you're going to do it
[1:46:03] Lord help me take my hands off of it
[1:46:09] so many times we put our hands on things
[1:46:10] we shouldn't be putting our hands on
[1:46:13] When God says I'll fix your problem I
[1:46:16] and I've said it before
[1:46:17] I have tried to fix my problems so many
[1:46:19] times
[1:46:20] the biggest message that I've ever been
[1:46:22] in is problems I've tried to fix but
[1:46:24] Jimmy
[1:46:25] problems that I've tried to fix
[1:46:27] is the biggest message that I've been in
[1:46:29] you'll find out I promise you 100 if you
[1:46:33] take your hands off of it and say God I
[1:46:34] give it to you
[1:46:36] it'll be fixed
[1:46:39] maybe not the way you expected it to
[1:46:42] but when God says it's fixed it's fixed
[1:46:56] who this Melchizedek
[1:46:59] I'm gonna change it real quick here for
[1:47:01] about five minutes and then we'll
[1:47:03] we'll close
[1:47:07] then after you've recognize the very
[1:47:08] word of God was Eagle food
[1:47:11] then you left the other thing
[1:47:14] you have been formed into the living
[1:47:16] image
[1:47:18] of the Living God
[1:47:21] you have been formed
[1:47:24] into the living
[1:47:26] image of God
[1:47:28] Jesus was God in flesh
[1:47:32] right
[1:47:34] you are God in flesh
[1:47:38] swallow that
[1:47:40] you are the living image of God
[1:47:46] when you and brother Branham says in you
[1:47:48] when you heard that you recognize this
[1:47:50] word of God was Eagle food you heard
[1:47:52] from your theophany
[1:47:54] and what is a theophany
[1:47:56] brother Brandon said though this Earth
[1:47:58] with Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:48:00] another body waiting for us over there
[1:48:02] he said that was your theophany
[1:48:07] who you think is going to call you from
[1:48:08] the grave if you go by the way of the
[1:48:09] grave
[1:48:11] who's going to roll your stone away
[1:48:13] brother Joel
[1:48:14] if you go by a way of the grave
[1:48:17] you're still Rolling Stones
[1:48:21] you're still pushing Stones back
[1:48:25] sister Linda brother Jimmy gets to push
[1:48:26] a stone back
[1:48:28] when mother Jimmy stew often he comes
[1:48:30] down
[1:48:36] he's all he's going to do is speak why
[1:48:37] it's his life
[1:48:39] it's the life of God in that theophany
[1:48:41] you are a continued thought of God your
[1:48:44] theophany is a continued thought of God
[1:48:47] you're content the continued thought of
[1:48:49] God says you will raise your own body if
[1:48:52] you go by the way of grave
[1:48:53] that was in God's thought before the
[1:48:55] foundation of the world
[1:48:57] so brother Jimmy you'll come down there
[1:48:59] and say Jim Bob come forth
[1:49:03] he probably won't be Adams by then every
[1:49:06] single Adam every single cell will come
[1:49:08] back together and it'll raise him out of
[1:49:10] the grave
[1:49:14] it's the power and you have that power
[1:49:16] in you now
[1:49:19] right now
[1:49:21] Lord don't let me wait for my theophany
[1:49:23] to call my body if I have to go by the
[1:49:25] way of the Grave let me throw some
[1:49:26] Stones today
[1:49:28] let's Stand Together
[1:49:30] you ain't got to wait till then to roll
[1:49:31] Stones there's people sitting beside you
[1:49:34] that need a Stone Road out of their life
[1:49:38] don't don't wait till the rapture
[1:49:41] just decide to start Rolling Stones
[1:49:44] there's people that right beside you
[1:49:46] today that need help
[1:49:48] there's people beside you right now that
[1:49:51] need to hear the words come forth
[1:49:56] Humanity has to be involved
[1:50:01] Humanity has to be involved
[1:50:05] you might be the one to take those dirty
[1:50:07] stinking grave clothes off of them
[1:50:11] by coming up here and praying through
[1:50:12] with them
[1:50:14] praising God for deliverance in their
[1:50:16] life
[1:50:18] we all have a part to play No Doubt Mary
[1:50:21] and Martha got so discouraged
[1:50:24] they know they'd sent for Jesus Jesus
[1:50:26] had always come
[1:50:27] he had always come
[1:50:31] this was his closest friends
[1:50:36] and this couldn't those things happen in
[1:50:38] our life
[1:50:40] the darkest moments it's at that darkest
[1:50:43] moments brother Brandon said that
[1:50:45] crucial crucifying hour
[1:50:48] when the doctor said there's no more
[1:50:50] hope
[1:50:51] when the doctor says it's over send her
[1:50:54] home
[1:50:56] there's no hope for him there's nothing
[1:50:57] more we can do send him home call
[1:50:59] Hospice
[1:51:01] we've seen God deliver out of that
[1:51:04] why because somebody was pushing some
[1:51:07] stones
[1:51:08] a lot of times Lazarus couldn't move
[1:51:10] that stone Lazarus couldn't speak
[1:51:12] himself out of there
[1:51:16] he needed family
[1:51:19] he need brothers and sisters
[1:51:22] to push that stone away
[1:51:25] I hope and pray to God that after today
[1:51:27] that we get the mindset let me I've
[1:51:30] preached all over myself in this
[1:51:32] Lord help me be more compassionate to
[1:51:34] other people's needs Lord help me to
[1:51:37] help somebody that needs Deliverance
[1:51:39] I I don't I don't want to I don't want
[1:51:41] to just go on and worry about myself I
[1:51:43] want to I don't want to be just Lord I
[1:51:44] got to take care of myself first I need
[1:51:46] healing I need Deliverance I need
[1:51:47] financial help I need this
[1:51:50] I promise you if you
[1:51:52] set your heart on somebody else God will
[1:51:54] take care of yours
[1:51:57] God will take care of your needs
[1:52:00] because it ain't about you anyways it's
[1:52:01] about the glory of God
[1:52:04] it's about God getting glory in other
[1:52:06] people's lives
[1:52:13] brother Brandon said in faith now each
[1:52:16] one of you have power the same way
[1:52:18] because you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:52:20] God
[1:52:21] that very Spirit that's in you this
[1:52:23] morning the Holy Spirit that's in you
[1:52:24] this morning the same holy spirit will
[1:52:26] raise you up
[1:52:28] so you have power to raise yourself back
[1:52:30] up when you die your soul will go under
[1:52:33] the altar of God not right in the
[1:52:35] presence of God now your spirit will go
[1:52:36] to God but you cannot come back remember
[1:52:39] in the Bible that said the spirit soul
[1:52:40] is under the altar crying Lord how long
[1:52:42] how long
[1:52:45] 144 000 and they would not return until
[1:52:48] the scripture is fulfilled and like
[1:52:50] Christ could not return into the
[1:52:51] scriptures fulfilled then after all
[1:52:54] that's been done all the suffering is
[1:52:55] over the brothers Brethren have suffered
[1:52:57] the same things and we've suffered like
[1:52:59] they suffered and so forth you'll know
[1:53:01] exactly where you're buried
[1:53:04] you'll know where you're at
[1:53:07] why because they're one they're coming
[1:53:09] together
[1:53:10] for a glorified body
[1:53:13] you'll know exactly where you're buried
[1:53:15] why because you know all things then
[1:53:17] yeah
[1:53:19] your spirit will be turned loose from
[1:53:21] God and will come to the soul
[1:53:25] I'm long for that day
[1:53:28] every present water from the rock
[1:53:30] brothers sisters I want to ask you
[1:53:31] something if you are born again of the
[1:53:33] spirit of God
[1:53:35] don't have no little weak Parts at big
[1:53:37] strong parts
[1:53:39] and I've said here before don't ever say
[1:53:41] I'm the weakest Christian I'm the least
[1:53:43] in the kingdom of God
[1:53:45] if you've got God living in you
[1:53:48] we're all the greatest
[1:53:51] you are the greatest in the kingdom of
[1:53:53] God
[1:53:54] why because you are him
[1:53:57] God don't have no weak Parts God don't
[1:53:59] have no lesser parts
[1:54:01] God there's no parts of God that's a
[1:54:02] little stronger you know when they you
[1:54:04] see when they bring these football
[1:54:06] players that you know they show their
[1:54:07] weaknesses and their strengths God don't
[1:54:09] have no weaknesses
[1:54:11] if God don't have no weaknesses you
[1:54:13] don't have any weaknesses
[1:54:16] whatever you need
[1:54:18] you have the power it's like a cheat
[1:54:20] code in a video game
[1:54:22] cheat code
[1:54:24] where you can max out your power
[1:54:26] God Max it out for you when he moved
[1:54:28] into you
[1:54:30] you don't have to go buy any
[1:54:33] you don't have to go borrow any
[1:54:35] God says I am in you therefore my power
[1:54:38] is in you
[1:54:42] he is all together God and if you had
[1:54:44] enough God in you till it was just
[1:54:46] barely a shadow
[1:54:48] that's enough power to make a new Earth
[1:54:52] remember Peter his shadow crossed that
[1:54:54] man and he was healed
