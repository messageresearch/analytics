minutes before service to make a couple announcements about the upcoming services this coming weekend we would like to ask any and everyone to carpool if possible I know that there's families that bring two or three vehicles to a service if we could alleviate that to some extent it would be a great help in our parking I know it's not always possible to do that but maybe if you could just evaluate your own situation and see if you could possibly could you know the carpool for these weekend Services it would really help us out a lot and also we've obtained some additional parking for the services it's adjacent to to our property it's in the back of the church here it's The Old Barn restaurant area I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Old Barn restaurant that's no longer in business if you come past our entrance past our property it's the second driveway on the left we'll have signs down there to direct you into the parking we'll have several of our security guys down there doing the parking I promise you we won't block you in we will park you to where you can get out easy at any time you need to get out it's easy access back to the church we have established a gate that connects the two properties and you can actually walk back once you park in that area you can walk back through the gate to the parking lot here we'll have a golf cart that will bring you back let you off at the handicap entrance here at the side of the building we have two Vans to shuttle you back to show you right to the front door show you from the front door back to your vehicle and if anyone would like to help us out with parking in that area you could bring your passengers to the front here set them out move back around and go down to the old barn parking area it's strictly volunteer we're just asking as many people as we possibly can to park in that area because we'd love to save a lot of our parking lot around the building here for our handicapped and our elderly and and also our visitors um also for the meetings we're going to open the doors one hour and 45 minutes early brother Dan Robbins will open the doors at 5 15 on Friday and Saturday and 9 15 on Sunday um we seating will be first come first serve we would like to fill up this lower sections here first before we open up the mezzanine seating is going to be at a premium I think for these meetings so I'm not sure we'll have the luxury of having a seat or two seats in between us um so help us out help the deacons out when you see a vacant seat or two vacant seats beside you just raise your hand point to it help us out because it's sometimes it's very difficult to to find you know some seeds when there's certain amount of people gets in this area so I know you've helped us out in the past when when we're at Happy Valley and we had a crowd you'd always help us out and we really appreciate that we need it once the sanctuary is filled up we have some seating that's been we've set up in the fellowship hall as an overflow um we will not open that overflow up until we have all the seating that's taken place in here in the sanctuary we don't know what kind of crowd we're going to have so that's the reason we're setting up an overflow over there in case it gets completely full in this area in the sanctuary also um the sisters wanted me to announce that after the services uh Friday night and Saturday night there'll be a snack bag available for everyone over into the fellowship hall so once we dismiss on Friday night once we dismiss on Saturday night if you would just exit the sanctuary go over to the fellowship hall for a snack bag it's for everyone it's not just for visitors but it's for for our home people and and visitors I know that um the parking and and the seating may be a little bit inconvenient but for myself and everyone I've talked to that our expectations are so high for these meetings that I know the expectations will far exceed any type of inconvenience that we might experience so we're really excited for the meetings and and and I know God will bless us immensely thank you brother Louie well there's one thing he needs to know don't never say never that we love our deacons don't we amen [Music] isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord on Sunday morning June the 25th 2023 who would who would ever thought that we'd still be in this world at

to be here thank you all so much I guess the piano isn't the only thing I'm struggling with anymore I cannot get it [Music] there we go well thank you if the rest of this Falls flat it'll just be the standard then thank you all so much it's great to be here um we were asked to sing the song and I wrote this after a friend of mine sent me a little YouTube clip of a sermon by a preacher named Aleister Begg and he was talking about the thief on the cross I think we all know the story how he turned to Jesus and said please remember me and Jesus said today you'll be with me in Paradise and the sermon was imagining what it would be like if that man were to be stopped by an Angel and asked why are you here and he'd probably say something like I don't know and as as the angel asked more questions it was very clear quickly that this man had nothing to offer and maybe maybe the angel said something like in frustration well on what basis are you here and the man would have to stay to say all I can tell you is the man on the middle cross said I could come and sometimes we take credit for what God has done in our lives and we say things like I believed and I live a good life but the scripture says that even our righteousness is as is filthy to a holy and just God and the truth is that we have nothing more to offer the Lord than that Thief did and if we answer that question when we stand before our creator and it starts with I we've gone wrong but we only have salvation because he died for our sin he rose from the dead and he said I could come please [Music] he was one of three to be crucified but unlike the king he deserved to die an evil life had brought him to this fate and the price for all he done was more than he could pay but then he turned to Jesus and that day he found himself at Paradise his gate and when they asked the reason he belonged on golden streets he said all I know is when Jesus looked at me he said I could come not because of anything I've done there's no doubt I don't deserve this love so if there is a reason there there's just one and I met God's son he said I could come and with an empty hand no good deed to bring one day I will stand before the King of Kings the only goodness I will have play is the goodness of the Lord Who Loved away my shame so if I'm asked the reason I am saved just like that thief and Paradise his gate I'll Stand secure because I'm standing on his sacrifice and all I'll have to say is when Jesus changed my life he said I come come not because of anything I've done there's no doubt I don't deserve this love so if there is a reason there's just one and I'm that God's son he said I could come when I see my life there is no hope for me but my hope Comes Alive When I Look to Calvary cause he said I could come not because of anything I've done there's no doubt I don't deserve this love so if there is a reason there's just one when I met God said I could care he said I could try mom said that's why [Applause] [Applause] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] I did not fully trust Ed how he longed for me to understand that I could [Music] so through the valley he led me afraid as I could be till I felt his loving [Music] worms embracing me [Music] how could I ever doubt a god whose hands hold the you never [Music] why would I ever question his ability [Music] there's no place that I can go where he doesn't know the things always aware of where I am and what I need and I've been through enough to know him for me and he's come through too many times that puts my mind [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] seen him work before and I know what God can cause I've been readers [Music] [Music] he's gonna take care of me cause I've been through enough to know him he'll be enough for me [Music] and I've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me [Music] and he's come through too many times [Music] he's gonna take care of me [Music] cause I've been through enough [Music] for me yes I've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me [Music] [Applause] Jesus thank you Father let me knows that's the truth sometimes you look at it you think I'm not sure not sure if it's going to work I'm not sure what's going to happen not sure what the results is going to be but you know God's faithful that's where you realize that a person that first gets saved they don't trust God that way that's actually not a gift something that God gives you comes by experience you learn that you can trust him no matter what's going on what's around you how bad and Bleak and indifferent it may be but you know I've been through enough to know he's all that I need and they're privilege for us to be together again today so so happy and so looking forward to the meetings coming up this week Lord willing and I know you've been praying let's just continue to pray that the Lord will just meet with us in a in a great way um probably going to be a big crowd for us to deal with and we'll do our best to deal with that but I want to say also that we're looking for the Lord to do great things not just in healings and things like that but salvation restoration of backsliders people getting the Holy Ghost so somebody on your heart invite them your children that's away from the Lord and by them to come somebody asked me about local churches calling us absolutely let them come come we'll Fellowship we'll do what we can together to help one another you've got somebody on your heart brother Donnie but just all the self-righteous people no about all the saints I'm afraid that stand down our crowd big all the sinless ones well you won't knock me out too remember the Joel couldn't even come if you do that I'll tell you who we invite thieves Liars we'll bolt down the stuff till the thieves get saved what do we think Church is for the perfect for those who need no help no friends no we want this to be a first church of Mercy First Church of Mercy to where that those that seem so ill repute and remember we ever get to a place to where that we cannot reach out to a person like that we're not anywhere close to Jesus I read this week where the Prophet said that the people that was around him were stinking fishermen low down people that a lot of us wouldn't even look at imagine the woman that had been married all them husbands we would have took the legalism of the scripture and whatever more and proved they went a bit more Hope from that woman than there was the Devil Himself but Jesus wrote a message of Mercy on the sand amen I want to be like him that way too don't you so let's pray and we'll just ask the Lord to move for us and we just expecting God for a wonderful time and let's turn today if you would to Psalm again Psalm 37 3. Lord Willem will be having a prayer line on Saturday night brother Tim pro to be opening the service speaking for us on Friday and then brother Ron Spencer on Saturday and plan on a prayer line I told him if you didn't feel up to it of course be no obligation on that we would do it if we needed to if he wants to stay as long as he can he can do that whatever's comfortable for him and then David Siler will be finishing up for us on Sunday morning so we're just coming expecting a great time well Daryl told me a couple of years ago up in Virginia brother Sean Martins it was about 900 to a thousand people something like there there at that meeting and the prayer line went on to 1 30 in the morning so needless to say if he had that many people in the prayer line you won't have to stay that long if you don't feel that you can do it you can be able to slip out and have some food over there in the fellowship hall for you you can get that and you go but just we come expecting the Lord to do great things with all of our hearts but I have to be honest I'm not just waiting till Friday I'm expecting him today I need him today anybody else need him I need him right now I need him like I've never needed him trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily shalt thou be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord listen this promise now and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart Romans 8 16. the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God John heiress with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together I spoken to you last Sunday but let me just remind you today you are heirs of God that's what you receive second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10 Paul speaking of the contrast between life how it can be sometimes as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things as having nothing and yet possessing all things and he has a request on your heart today you'd like to be remembered before the Lord Erica got to come home on Thursday thank the Lord the last couple of days she's been really really weak so if y'all would just join with us in prayer for that today Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your mercy to us thank you dear God as the two songs we heard today Lord the first one it will not be anything that we could ever do that would privilege us to walk down those streets of gold but because you said we could come That's How we'll get there Lord we're so grateful then father we've been through enough to know you'll be enough to help us the Lord Jesus we're looking to you today now that you take your word and speak to us once again you know our needs there's so many father the hundreds of people that are here and the thousands that will go back and hear this service help us we need you today Lord we need your strength we need your healing we need your your great encouragement we need all the things that our souls thirst for today can only be satisfied by you take your word speak to us with your father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask you and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated how innumerable are the blessings of God to his people we've been speaking about the bride's Bill of Rights a few more that we'd like to look at today by the help of the Lord one of them is the right to reign the right to reign r-e-i-g-n reign reigning is something that most people in this life can never do correctly some start out maybe in a kingdom and a position a magistrate a prime minister a president a person of authority a person of renown as we would say no doubt many of them have started out great had good intentions of serving the people in their Kingdom or their constituency wherever they are and then they go to seeing opportunities that are only available for the upper echelon by ways that they can cheat and get by with it and do wrong and feel like that they're free from penalty or prosecution like the rest of us are and like so many even police officers we hear about it and state troopers and judges and many people like that and before long the vision of what they initially set out to be changes and they find themselves a total different person I've always thought it must have been must be really unusual for a judge whether he's a Circuit Judge or whatever type of Judge that he is and he has people come before him all the time and he will give to them the law and yet you hear of different ones of those judges that are worse than the people that they sentence and you think did they get to a place to where they just lose the sense of right and wrong they don't even care about it anymore and yet they would send you to jail to prison they would say a certain fine of x amount of dollars and they themselves live worse than you do and it must be something that transitions in a lot of people that they change with authority and power and they get to a spot to where is that morality Justice and character and truth it no longer has any value but what is the highest value to them is what they can do what they can get by with the amount of money they can make and want they're able to pull over and be able to get by with but we know people like that aren't really fit to Reign if we would be able to look at the end of a president's term and see what he was going to do to our nation he would never become president because most people would look at that and say man I don't want that guy doing this to our country I don't want that guy doing this and tank turns it into that turning this upside down there's no way we would want that but we really don't know do we but God has the ability by foreknowledge to be able to look ahead in time before there was any time and be able to look ahead and see what people would do he knew what David would do and what Solomon would do he knew what Ahab would do he knew what a lot of people down through time that would be in position of leadership what they would do but ultimately he does not always stop and forbid people of the evil and darkness from being in a position of authority But ultimately when it comes to reigning with him in the future Kingdom he will control all who sets was him in his throne but before we will ever reign with him in eternal life now if you understand already that we are reigning right now in the Kingdom of Grace we are in the Kingdom of Grace and we have already a Dominion a position a place in Christ Jesus but God will judge and God will parallel the ability of those who will reign in the future Kingdom but they must also prove themselves a character which will be noteworthy now I know we're familiar with the church age book that power apart from character is satanic and we truly can testify of that all of us in one way or another so God will have a people that will have a power that had never be forgiven to any human being from myself I find that God makes it hard to be a king God makes it hard to be a leader God makes it very difficult to be a ruler of people I'm talking about God's people because he wants to search and find out the best that he can put before his people now every leader is not chosen necessarily by God but chosen by the people and we see Ahab whenever he was in his position he was a very reflection of the age of Israel we see the very first king King Saul and when you look at Saul's makeup and you wonder in your mind why would God ever choose a man like Saul but when you look at Saul where he was who he was and then you look at the end result of Saul you can see that Saul was a mirror of the age that he lived in he matched the people so to put David as the first king would have never matched the mindset of the people because the people were rebellious the people wanted a man to be their leader and what did God give them a stubborn hard-headed rebellious King he matched the people now I don't want to hurt your feelings first thing this morning but our president our Congress our Senate most of our leaders in this nation is a mirror image of the majority of Americans rebellious Liars thieves robbers Hellbound [Applause] good morning Hellbound now that don't match us that's not who we would choose to be our leaders is that right because we have a different taste a different desire so God and what I like to do for a few minutes this morning is parallel this and going into this about the right to reign with Christ Jesus and we know that this life truly is the shortest span of time that we'll ever live and we're making preparation now for the world that is to come and God will try us he will chasten us he will put us through all kinds of difficult things to send us down and thin down his crowd and show who his people really are now read with me if you would in Romans chapter 9 verse 12 and keep this in mind now that we're talking about reigning that we have a right to reign so election will truly identified with a predestinated seed but there will be something in life that will show that we are fit to Reign now notice Paul he picks this up let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body now what you notice the first saying that Paul separates you from your body and he does not call you immortal but he calls your body mortal so he's speaking now to a category of people who have already entered in to immortality by the new birth these people have been changed by the power of God so he separates them from their self now notice how he speaks to us let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body so who's he speaking to he's not speaking to the body Romans 6 is not addressed to the body but it's addressed to you the Conqueror the born-again the redeemed The Immortal one now he's telling the immortal one how to treat the Mortal one listen let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body look at the word rain basilio it means to be king to exercise kingly power to Reign to exercise the highest influence to control so here Paul is telling the saints of God they have the ability to refuse to let sin be the king of their mortality now he cannot say this to an unregenerate person because their soul their spirit and their body is the Dominion of the devil but this is speaking to a person who lives in a divided Kingdom and the church said in the divided Kingdom you will be addressed separately so your soul will be spoken to and your body will be spoken to the king of who you are will be the dominant force of the Kingdom now sin will try to dominate even the saints of God notice everybody lay Assad or Angelic crowns and all of our wings and all of those holy ha and Shelly attitudes that we think we have and let's come right down to where the pavement meets the road meets the meets together the rubber tire hits it and wears and wears and wears and let's just look at ourselves in reality today that every one of us if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost for 40 years or 50 or 60 or for five minutes you realize that there is a battle going on with you and that battle is between two kings a lot to preach that to you sometime A Tale of Two Kings because there is a great Warfare now the world of course will reject the king of preeminence they will reject the king of immortality and light so really this does not affect them but it affects those that have already been born again now notice he says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof so you mean there is a way then that sin will try to get you and I to obey it but we're not we're not subject to that Kingdom no more no but your body still is it's a creature of time and your mouth will say Amen it's the greatest enemy you'll ever have in your life is yourself let not send therefore Reign be king in your mortal body that ye should obey again look at this word be obedient to to listen to hearken to a command to obey to submit to now notice again The Divided Kingdom so Paul is speaking then to those who are regenerate and testifying that they have a king in their soul but that their mortality is still under the basilio of Satan and he will try his best whether by sickness or sadness or depression or temper or anger or jealousy and so on and so on to bring you under the control of the flesh how many still fights that battle well I can say all the rest of it needs delivered of lying all right if you're born again you still fight that battle now notice that sin not therefore reigning your mortal body that ye should obey it so notice the difference between again the body and the Soul so the body even though the body is not born again the body will still try to pull you your emotions your infatuations the lusts of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life it will still try to pull you because there's another kingdom that Satan wants to establish within your mortality and it will pull on you until the day you die or the day you are changed question answer 64 the prophet likened it to a kookaburra that the heart was cut out of the cocoa bird and a wheat heart was put inside it and he said you'll have that carnal sticky nature that will bother you as long as you live and the church said but the good part about it is it bothers you but I want you to notice that Paul goes on to say that you should not obey this King inside of your mortality and what he tried to do in the lust thereof notice what the word lust is we're all talking about lust for this lust for that but notice what it means it's very very simple a desire a craving a longing for what is forbidden now a lot of times first thing we think about when we hear the word lust we think about sexual if that's all you think about oh my goodness you are missing so much of the enemy's tactics it's a lust or a desire for anything that God forbids us to have so God does not want his children to have temper tantrums so Satan will try to move on you to cause you to lust at your temper tantrum so you can give somebody a piece of your mind you're lusting for that which is forbidden well praise the Lord the Lord don't want any of his children to hold an unforgiving Spirit Well lust we'll try to get on you to lust after and say well I've got to write they've done this to me no you do not have a right you are to forgive even your enemies so remember keep this in mind now that lust is a craving or a desire for anything that is forbidden that's somebody else's wife that's somebody else's husband somebody else's property or if it's a preacher it may be somebody else's gift or somebody else's influence well I wish I could be like that man I wish I could be like that man I desire to be like that man if God never gave you that then you are lusting for something that is forbidden for you praise the Lord so sin then is represented as a king or a tyrant who wants to bring the power of the mind and the control of the Soul into his submission now for those who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan knows the token once applied to the soul he'll never be able to get that Soul again but if he can cause you to grieve the holy spirit that is in your soul he is so silent satisfied with just doing that so if he can use his kingdom that he tries to set up right here see tapes feel smelled hero imagination conscience memory all of that and he will try to bring them Gates and make you fall subject to that and then you do or say something you shouldn't do or say then you feel so grieved and the Holy Spirit is grieved away from you he is so happy Satan is whenever we will do something that will grieve him away from our life and then of course when we repent and say we're wrong and then we deal with the days or the weeks or the months of the aftermath of a terrible mistake how many knows how that feels a lot it feels absolutely awful to a child of God and if Satan cannot get into the soulna more than he simply changes the tactic but the Warfare is still ongoing so the king wants to dominate the mortality of our body and the mortality of our spirit now remember when you die the prophet tells us that your spirit breaks up when you die in eternity you will no longer have a human Spirit you will not have imagination you'll not have conscience you'll not have a human Spirit you said what will I have you will have a body you will have a theophany and you will have a gene seed which in your soul that was the original word image created after the Divine godhead you see God created you in the image of himself so what was he he was King God King Jesus king theophany so God become a man is that right and God also created himself osteophany so he wanted us to have a sea Gene a theophany and a body but now we roll around through time and we forfeited the ability to have a theophany living at us in this life so what did God give us as a substitute Earth until we leave this world a human spirit so in our human Spirit we go to imagining this brother don't like me that sister don't like me I've been noticing now what is that your imagination and your spirit and then your conscience where is it your spirit your memory the things you've done that was wrong where is it in your spirit you see once your spirit is taken from you and you get us theophany you'll never ever again remember one thing you ever done wrong but it's stored inside your human spirit so God takes care of that and just annihilates that spirit and gives you a theophany but God wants the kingdom to be so established in our hearts now that every day now if you can imagine it's like a great Castle now Carolina students Jerusalem four or five years ago and the City of course is not the original City but it was rebuilt during the times of the Ottoman powers and whenever you go say that they got the Damascus gate they got the lion gate they got the Zion gate they got the dungape they got all these different Gates and you'll go from one side to the other to the other and all of it comes right to the center of Jerusalem so the Damascus gate which is one of my favorites and when you come up through there and the gates are so narrow that you still cannot get a full-size car into those places so they'd build it like this and then turn it like this so it'd make it very hard for the enemy to get through the gate and they would also have slits up here on the top and they would have a place cut in the Rock and whenever you would come through if you made it through the first turn of the gate that have people above you with a welcoming sign that well welcoming sign was boiling hot water or boiling hot oil so by the time you realize it you're fried faster than a Kentucky Fried Chicken that's exactly right why because the gate is the weakness so when you come into the gate they want to try to stop you there what if you can imagine that you yourself have several Gates too and the basilio of your mortality is constantly hitting at that one gate which is the Gate of the Soul so he'll try to take your eyes and make them wander and roam to a place they should not be or your imagination of your spirit and what will happen is he will couple those Gates together so your eyes begin to wander in roam then he will make a connection between the eyes to the imagination and the spirit and then you begin to think oh how this would be and how that would be then he'll try to take another maybe it will be it will be touched so it'll take touch and then it will come back to memory and then all all these gates are connecting from the Flesh and the Soul remember you've got 10 against one you've got 10 Gates against that one this is why I say friend those who live in this life and overcome by the grace of God they will be a people that are fit to Reign so how will God give the land of the sins and the majority of them of course are going to heaven they think I know but all of them are going to walk down the streets of gold and live with angels and all that sort of thing and they can't even live a Godly enough life to overcome a habit they can't even live a Godly enough light to be able to live above sin in this world and they're going to rule and reign with Christ Jesus in the Millennium and be with him in the eighth day I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you can't overcome the king here you won't reign with the King there notice Paul goes on to say in Romans 6 13 neither yield ye your members again notice how he's separating the people here neither yield ye so the ye and verse 13 is the same person that he was talking to in the other verse prior to this so the ye is not part of you which has reached immortality neither yield ye your members now they are your members but notice he does not call your members you but he calls in in a possessive term that they are yours they are yours and you have the ability by the grace of God to bring them under control and the Saints said but notice it will be totally up to you and I neither yield ye you notice he's not saying that the Holy Ghost will do this for you all you got to do is come to church once every now and then whether you feel like you need to or not read your Bible on the occasion you need to pray whatever you think you need to and of the Holy Ghost so take care of everything else I'm not sure what version you're reading that from but I burn it I said I burn it it ain't the Bible neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness is there any honest people here today that can say you've yielded your mouth your eyes your ears your fingers and your tongue come on now as members of unrighteousness now when you did that did that mean you were not born again does that mean you didn't have the Holy Ghost if you had the Holy Ghost before you still had it after you've done that dumb thing and we all still do those dumb things don't we but how was it then that it came about because ye yielded your mouse instead of sinking waiting praying this ain't right I shouldn't do that I'm I'm acting in haste I need to wait I need to pray and make sure this is the Lord and what do we do sometimes we do and sometimes we don't then we will allow from the control tower of the soul and we will allow the king and the basilio of our mortality and then we'll give somebody a piece of our mind I'll tell you the older I get the realize the more senile I'm getting anyway I figure I better keep every piece of my mind I've got because I'm going to need let me tell you young people you're going to find out you're going to need yours too but what does Satan do he will get us upset all been out of shape over this and that and the other and then we will yield our instruments notice he don't say your soul but you yields your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God oh listen this as those that are alive from the dead praise be to God so we once were dead according to what he tells us in the book of Ephesians that we were dead but those of us who were dead he has now quickened us in Christ Jesus so we were dead but the soul has been quickened by the spirit of God and that puts a basilio inside the Throne of our heart our soul and that will allow him to control every one of these instruments right here so instead of getting on a website that you shouldn't get on there the king sends a control tower and the sensor comes up into your bank and say hey don't do that www don't you do that.com www god'swatching you.com come on Saints if we will stay in harmony with that then our instruments will constantly be yielded instead of picking up your phone to bless somebody else you pick up your phone and send them a text hey brother it was on my heart today I wanted you to know I love you I'm praying for it then you take the same phone you take the same thumbs you take the same fingers and you send a message of Faith and Hope and encouragement and uplifting and send a message of Discord and a message of confusion however somebody would preaching me you send a message and what do you do the king from your soul channels your instruments to be of service to the kingdom of God oh praise the Lord notice that as those that are alive from the dead and your members notice again it separates your members from the new birth he doesn't say your members are alive from the dead but you are and then he said you oh my that are alive from the dead and your members which have suffered from their life from the dead part as instruments of righteousness unto God verse 14 first sin shall not have dominion over you how many once that more than anything in this world for sin shall not have dominion over you look at this word dominion exercise lordship over to rule same word as the other if you'll notice exact same word that he uses in the other verse so sin will not be king over you he will be subject to the spirit of God notice now then there's definitely a kingdom that we must overcome to be a part of the Everlasting never failing never ending immutable kingdom of God read with me in Romans chapter 8 verse 17 now let's go in the other direction and look at the Kingdom that we're longing for and if children that heirs Heirs of God John the air says Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together why in the world would God link suffering what's glorification why would God want to identify suffering as a part of moving out of this realm into a higher realm why do we need to suffer why why is it so imperative that the people of God go through so many things whether it is sickness or depression or sadness or whatever it is or past but yet dealing with so many things I found this in studying this and I thought it was quite astounding statement that Martin Luther said Christ himself was not glorified till first crucified Christ himself was not glorified until first crucified is that right so we do not see the glorification of his Humanity first but what he allows us to see is the weakness of his humanity and then the glorification follows it notice in verse 18 Paul goes on to say in Romans 8 18. I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to come to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us I don't mind telling you sometimes that becomes a little bit harder to be able to get in your focus because the sufferings of this present time can be so difficult so harsh so drove so heavy to bear and you say Lord will it ever end God when is this trial going to pass God help us everywhere you look I know many of you live in your own little private world and you've got you and your father and mother and mother-in-law and father-in-law and you got a few cousins and a few aunts and uncles and you live in that little tiny World let me tell you something there's a world out there of our brothers and sisters I'm talking about around the nations of the earth it is believable the things that the body of Christ is going through around the world there's great advantages to our phones I thank God for them in that sense that yet the one downside is I hear from all over the world all over the world nearly every day just after the break of dawn the other morning I heard from Japan from Africa from India from the islands in the Pacific all over the world and to hear this need that need this trouble that trouble this going on that going on can it be a blessing yes it can be a blessing but with it comes more of a load this brother is facing this at the point of death this child just fell this young girl just fell out of a FedEx truck which happened a couple weeks ago riding with her father and died oh my goodness and this happened and that happened what does it do it brings more burdens to us those of you that are in contact with that you know what I'm saying and it can become so difficult and so heavy at times but yet do we not remember what he said in his word that Paul said bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ so what is the law of Christ well it's not the Mosaic law it's not the law of the talmud or of the the rabbis but it was the law of Christ which was what not Thou shalt and thou shalt not but the law of love notice in the Sumerian Church age the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does she stem the tribulation no he does not he simply notice it says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer I dare say there's probably been the majority of us sitting here in this building today at some time or another wonder why don't God move all he'd have to do is just look your way and this would be gone and that would be gone he wouldn't even have to raise a finger he wouldn't even have to say a word all he'd have to do is look that way remember that's what the devil used against the prophet he said he wouldn't have to say one word all he'd have to do is look this way there's your wife's death that is your baby dead your diet daddy died two weeks ago your brother died your sister-in-law and he said he doesn't come too late to tell me there wasn't a God but what he was telling me was that he didn't love me well you know sometimes we can find ourselves in the same way why does God allow this to go on and let me tell you right now I don't know why God allows this to go on I'm not to go on but I know one thing my god is perfect I know one thing another thing my God makes no mistakes and when we pray if the Lord delays he has a reason in his delay and he don't always give us the reason but he just says trust me even when you don't understand believe me even when you cry and you pray and you're doing everything you know to do what should I do brother don't he stand therefore and gerd about yourself the armor of a child of God because he will move in his time and it'll be right on time oh my you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering I'd say they ain't the only ones they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love is elective love and the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and the belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job listen now oh my goodness this is his prerogative how many all want to suffer how many of you wants to die in your 40s 30s 20s teens wow nobody but what if he chooses to commit one of us to death before our three score in 10. what if he in his own great counsel says I'm going to let this man this woman this boy this girl goes through horrendous sings but I know that I know them before the test ever comes when the test has passed they'll still be serving me they'll still be loving as a matter of fact their faith will be stronger than it ever was before now sometimes when he does such we look at him we're trying to ponder and understand God what especially if you're a parent if you're a parent and you see a child going through something you're saying you'd do anything and everything to keep them from going through this terrible terrible thing and then if we're not careful we'll try to judge God by that son of my God I would never let my boy go say that you're God how come you'll do it I call that the no-fly zone you better stay out of there you don't belong there you don't belong there the devil will go to creating doubt and questions and all kinds of things in your mind about the sovereignty of God so what do you do brother Donnie well you just tell him Lord I love you I trust you I'll do what job said if you slay me I'm still going to trust you if you take everything I've got I'm going to trust you I don't understand but I'm not saved by understanding I'm not going to take the Rapture by understanding I believe his word and he's right even when I think he ain't [Applause] now how many Ultra honest Christians do we have here today that would be honest and say there's been times I've already wondered about the Lord's way and I've oh my God this is his prerogative he is sovereign it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose and he would be the author of frustration and not a peace his purpose is after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job says he put strength in US you see here he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect this is mind-boggling made perfect by the things that he suffered and he quotes the scripture here in Romans Hebrew Hebrews rather though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation into all them that obey him in very plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering now how many still wants to reign ah you'd rather just mop the floors I see now I figured we could minimize the amount of Thrones we'd need Throne Room won't be near as big will it huh oh my notice this Lord God in very plain language the very character of Jesus Jesus was perfected by suffering now notice he does not say the character of God but the character of Jesus which is who the humanity of God this is another one of those things that he laid aside his Splendor not just a robe of dignity in a great crown but he stepped out Beyond his own character and stepped into a character of mortality that was not perfect I know that's mind-boggling if he would have brought a perfect character to the Earth and he was the firstborn among many Brethren that you would have had to been born with your character when you got the new birth but he had to step Beyond his perfect character and allow himself to think thoughts human thoughts feel human Temptation have human weakness set outside of a city after he had raised a boy from the dead and sat out there and grown with a headache amen Lord God and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection oh you said brother Donny I thought the blood of Jesus perfects us it does this is a different type of perfection this is completion teleos maturity completion the blood of Jesus makes your soul pure just as far as the prophet said yesterday he said when the Lord God looks at us through the blood he don't even see us he sees Jesus and here's his voice when you pray we can say what's all this stuff going on for your character look you don't take your cars with you when you go you don't take your homes you don't take your title we don't take our building what do we take with us the only thing we take is our character and our characters flowed our character is imperfect and even the word does not speak to my character and create it in the state of perfection but God chose one thing to perfect human character sovereign makes me wish I wasn't so flawed maybe it wouldn't take so long enough for those of you that don't have very many plot flaws you pray for all the rest of us old dirtbags will you and we'll pray for you that God removed them scales from your eyes and help you to see you're just as bad if not worse than we are this we can see we're in a shape you don't even think you are or God why did he want this then he quotes the scripture James one two to four we'll just script skip down through there my brother encountered all joy when you fall into diverse temptation and I've got to be honest there's times with you that I can do that and there's times I struggle with it how many struggles with it you counted all Joe well glory to God hallelujah why are you shouting about now got a new car got a new house no I've been tempted like everything I'll tell you what glory to God I think I'm about to have a spell whether I'm talking about Charles she sent him when he met the Lord and he was a preacher it was a lawyer real dignified and he said oh he said to some sisters someone said brother Charles you need the Holy Ghost he said I've got the Holy Ghost he said he went out one day to pray and he got out in the woods by himself and he hurt us a little limb of the same snap and he said he was right out from his office he jumped up wiped his clothes off he said Lord have mercy here I thought my boss had caught me praying and he said I I ain't got the Holy Ghost he stayed right Daniel he got the Holy Ghost and prayed through and the spirit of God come to hell and he said one day when he come back into preaching he took off run and wouldn't come to the back wall of the church and said Lord I'm going to bring reproach on you I got to stay back here until your blessing wears off that's the difference between a man that's drunk and a man that's just reading about drinking that's what a lot of our message folks are they read about the quotes but once you ever get so drunk on the Holy Ghost it will help you when you're down it'll help you when you're weary it'll help them when you don't understand it'll help you when you're questioned page 117 paragraph one why does he stand by the reason is Romans 8 17-18 then he reads the scripture that we've been reading unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is character is simply never made without suffering oh wow character is say it with me a Victory not a gift oh man I've been a whole lot better in tongues with it I've been a whole lot better in discernment and Visions my the Lord just said here you go here you go stand the line here everybody all right everybody come on stand in line here here's your character here's your character here's your seat the word of God praise the Lord well look at me now Hallelujah I'm Heavenly bread I am well read Holy Ghost feel fed I'm ready for their action man I'm ready for a song look out devil here I come boy praise God but instead we get the Holy Ghost and don't you anoint somebody until we go to church with we don't even like and they just crawl under our skin they crawl under our skin and bite us and they just boy they push all of our buttons some folks since they'll push it buttons they jerk your buttons out of focus they jerk your buttons out and rewire them and then when you push them the next time and you're trying to fail what in the world said what happened well I know who that was that was oh so and so he rewired my buttons y'all you know why and people say well I'm leaving that church they don't I don't get my way that's probably where you need to go oh come on somebody why God may use opposition to mold and shape our character mm-hmm a man without character can't listen can't impossible no way will not happen no not maybe perhaps well some will work it out a man or a woman without character cannot reign well what about jumping what about running what about healings and miracles he don't say healings character do you understand one day Divine Healing will stop you understand there'll be no faith in heaven there'll be no faith in heaven faith is only for mortality faith will not be needed in heaven faith will end in sight what you've believed and what you hoped and what you trusted you will see you will actually see it you will no longer need Faith there won't be no need of preachers they say well glory to God they'll all be there the Holy Ghost feelings anyway they just won't be preaching no more so oh I thought I was going to get away from preachers never never you're always going to have us oh I'll tell you one thing some of you a little dared I'll let you might as well get used to me because we're going to spend eternity together we are going to shout together we're going to praise God together we're going to worship together you ain't never getting rid of me I'll vote you out you might vote me out here but you can't vote me out up yonder they don't hold elections up there oh notice a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is wow but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne sick of it not just eternal life that you're living around a city and you're drinking the water and walking on streets of gold he wants us to share his food who is this person who is this Mighty Elohim that would want Mortals to share his oh Lord on the same basis the same basis that he overcome and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome the setlist him and the little temporary suffering we go through now it's not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation friends can't just say why the majority of laodiceans will never even come close to this to them one of the greatest battles on Sunday morning it just gets so stressed out the ladies which mini skirt do I wear to church which high heels should I paint my eyes pink or blue I'm so stressed can you imagine taking a letter to send church member and put them under the strain of a bright life for one week take a denominational young person and put them under the stress that our young people deal with in a month's time they'd be more suicides there wouldn't be enough funeral homes in the Tri-Cities to bury them all don't think just that God allows his older people to suffer I use also suffer they suffer depression they suffer rejection they suffer all types of things but let me tell you something the Lord Jesus knew he would have some young daughters in this last day he would have some young men they would also stand there and overcome they would look hell in the face and say I Will Not Bow I will not bow to you Satan I'll not bow to luxury I'll not bow to Fashion I choose the word with the Lord's despised you are you in wow thinking not strange concerning concerning the fiery trials that ought to try you that is what Peter said it strains that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no shall we all have Troublesome we're all tried and chasing the sons not but one goes through that listen Church the church that is not suffering is oma it's not being tried hasn't got it isn't of God oh I I hear this message says and they're always on the map they never have no battles I'd run from that place as fast as I could something ain't right come on don't sit down look at me funny I'm reading to you from the message of the hour and for church isn't being tried it's not of God wow can I have a few more minutes you know what I read these things I realize especially the last couple weeks I've been looking at this I can see why the world thinks we're a bunch of nuts second Corinthians 4 17. for our light affliction which is but for our light affliction is before a moment worketh for us are far more exceeding an eternal weight of Glory you say how could he say such a thing he's looking at the difference between the present and the future the present and the future the disparity of the issues that he went through had he focused on them alone this man would have been so down and so discouraged he probably wouldn't have known what to do but he said our light Affliction which is but for a moment he calls what he's been through all this time a light affliction and he says it only lasted but a moment I'm Gonna Last an hour come on somebody understand what I'm saying so you look back through the hardest thing you've ever been in your life and say well that wasn't but a moment said dear God I'm glad it wasn't today for a minute today I'd been there a long time ago but we cannot compare it in the way we measure time notice what he said in verse 18. while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal now let me share with you a little bit of his light afflictions which but before a moment second Corinthians 1 5 for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundth my Christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that is we are partakers of the suffering so shall we be also of the consolation for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which we came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life wow now what's amazing is Paul doesn't even tell us what this particular thing is brother Timothy that he was going through we don't even know he don't even call it the name well she went to meet us down this is whenever I sold in jail he don't even say but what he's emphasizing is what went on now not Otis he says which come to us in Asia that we were pressed look at the word be heavy be burdened to burdened way down depressed how many has ever been there you mean a church-aged messenger felt so weighted down and so loaded and under such depression oh my goodness my God out of measure this can't take it no more lord it's bigger than what I can do it's more than I can stand I'm pressed out of my measure this is totally unfair this burden belongs to brother Rob not me this burden should never be mine look at Paul above strength so he's pressed beyond what he should been bearing and he's about strength to burn this so heavy the load is so difficult I cannot bear this another day that we despaired even of life look at the word despaired to be at utterly at loss utterly destitute of measures or resources to renounce all hope there ain't even a hope left there's not even a resource but when it comes after that trial he tells us it wasn't before a moment imagine people get the Corinthian letter and everything I said would you please make up your mind would you please make up your mind I'm like you stretch this thing out and you emphasize all these Greek words and you use the heaviest Greek words in the Greek language the Bible emphasize are five different words used for all that and Paul shows all five of them which was the heaviest burden that could be borne by human being and then when it comes out of that body said glory to God it wasn't but for a moment well he said praise be to God I've got such Victory out of that can you imagine when it comes out of this that he looks back and said I learned something in that trial that I'd never learned before I got something out of that trauma that I've never seen before that God vanquished all of my strengths and God vanquished all of my ability I've always found I could boil and the devil come I quote that word I do this how the other Paul said I got to a place I couldn't even do that I vanquished all of my strength all of my stamina all of my ability and I thought there is no hope left and here he come Oh Glory my brother sister it's the darkest hour that Jesus comes along long God May and sometimes does exercise his servants with such stress and pressing them to their limit and they're maxed to their own natural strength is unable and they just realize I'm whipped okay that's it Oh you mean they're going to the world goodness no I just realized it's the end of themself which is the very thing he's wanting anyway because every one of us have too much of us we can always fall back on this and boy when we get down we can always fall back on that but whenever we face this we can always fall back on that well I hate to be the bearer of bad news but he's going to blow every one of your fallbacks out of the way he's going to blow every one of your strengths totally out of the way until you come to a spot to where you say Lord I can't even walk without you hold in my hand Lord I can't even hold my head up Lord I'm solo I don't know what to do I don't know what word to use I don't know what quote to use no more I don't know what scripture to use no more but I know my God is still in control he's up when I'm down he's well and I'm sick he is my father he is my healer he is my redeemer he will not let me go thank you notice this and I'll close look inverse and I but we had the sentence of death I just knew this is it I I'm not going to make it I'm gonna die we had the sentence of death and ourselves but listen here's the key that we should not trust in ourselves Glory I want you to notice how he says it's so peculiar but he's the son of Abraham that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raised us the Dead so Paul looked at himself by the meverness I'm dead this is it now we don't know whether it was a magistrate we don't know what it was if there's going to feed him to the lines we don't have no clue what it was but Paul had come to the reality this is it I'm dead there's no way out of this situation and then he realized oh so that's why you did that so my strength will be totally gone and I would be like Abraham when Abraham's body was dead and Sarah's womb was dead but he believed God could raise the Dead and here Paul says about himself he said the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raisth the dead what did Paul experience out of this great trial out of this great trauma and he was down in the ashes oh I'm done I fought with a beast of Ephesus I've been through this I've been through that I'm not listen to this one I'm not making this is it so here he goes the ashes of humility but then the god of Abraham said rise up oh Phoenix Hallelujah Hallelujah rise up Phoenix and out of the ashes come a servant of God like Satan had never dealt with before he thought the other Paul was bad news hey this is a total different book right here this is a complete different Paul this is a complete different Joy this is a complete different dominant would not it be worth it if God has to bring us down to the absence and then God says Arise My Phoenix arise Hallelujah all right out of the ashes and you can rise and say I was dead but I'm alive there was no hope but he came there was no way out Oh Glory to God glory to God oh when the bride can arrive to this verse this is not quote Mark 16. and this is not quote say John 14 12. let's quote this one too then we are ready oh yeah but we had the sentence of death in ourselves you'll never live you're too far gone the cancer is advanced there's no way we can ever work on your heart we can't do this we can't do that I mean it's sitting right here in this building today had the sentence of death pronounced On You by a professional and he was telling you everything his chart said but God don't always follow their charts we've got another chart we've got another report it's Dr God what's that let me read this once more but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but God in God which raises the debt tribulation was so violent it was so violent so overwhelming that he had no hope it was just like he thought this is it this is it but I love it even when Saints will get there and they look at it and think wow I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna put her this time or not but they still go back to what Martha said her man said even now Lord whatever you say whatever you say I don't reckon none of us share today's the bad dislasm to us are we in the all four days dead four days gone the spirit out there somewhere but she said even now whatever you ask God God will do it stand up and say the same thing I was he that was dead but I'm alive he may not allow you to physically die but just to where you'd feel like you're getting so low but really we are dying it's the dying of our confidence it's the dying of our strength and our self I used to know a preacher and Pentecost brother Paul Hebrews one of the greatest Bible quoting preachers I ever met in my life and I I really admired him but I happened to spend a little time with him one day over in Virginia and he told me the reason that he did that was if he'd gotten a hard spot in the service he just started quoting the Bible and he could quote it like a Gatling gun I mean chapter verse the whole thing it was just and I began to think of that and I thought so really that's his crutch his knowledge of being able to quote the word I wonder what our crutches are called today and wonder if he don't let us come down to the ash sheep remember that's where he brought job remember brother Brown preached on that ass sheep for about a year and a sister comes home and said brother Brandon when are you ever going to get job off that ass sheep well I guess that sister didn't know category according to the amount of time job was in that book about a year well the prophet was about right on his time what oh how many knows it sometimes you can get there and you look around there ain't no hope Here Comes Bill Dad Here Comes This friend you go to church with that friend your mom even calls you said if you picked out your casket yet if you got your shoes signed for your funeral boy there ain't no hope for you but if God is not done with you yet I don't care if the funeral partner is calling for you and say is he gone yet we don't got the casket ready because they got the embalming fluid ready if it ain't God's time you ain't going I said you ain't going because the devil didn't bring us here and the devil ain't going to take us away by the grace of God friends you know where they are don't you we're on the journey to the throne The Book of Psalms tells us about Joseph until his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him God had a word with Joseph's name on it and the word of the Lord Tried Him until his word came well maybe today is your delivery date maybe the word's been trying you maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe in the meeting oh I can't wait till the meeting why would you want to put it off for a four more days if today's your day I'd grab it I'd grab it right here it's the same Lord Jesus whether it's me preaching or whoever else is preaching it's not the preacher no way it's Jesus himself that we want to grab the whole top so one day Joseph's word came into the dungeon where he was what was he on that whole period of time what was he on a journey to the throne to have a character that he would be made right up next to pharaoh we realize when we leave this world whether by deaths or by Body Change we will not go to a character supplemental School we will go through a spiritual Purgatory that there will be supplied to us what we lacked when the bride leaves this world she will lack nothing you don't believe in miracles brother that is a miracle when we leave this work can you imagine there won't be one thing lacking in our life not one thing we will go straight from this hell into the paradise of God by 1965 and the prophet finished the church age book the streets had already been laid you give us a little update on the construction the streets had already been laid the gates had already been hung praise God and the Angels were standing there breathlessly awaiting for its inhabitants now if that was in 1965 and here we are in 2023 can you imagine which that's been a long time not according to God's time of day it's just been a few minutes so they've been sitting there just holding their breath a few minutes what are they waiting for us and we will fight all this hell and go through all this stuff and one day we'll get up and it'll feel like any other normal day probably the wraps shall be on Monday I mean one of the worst days of the year if I had somebody else thinking on Sunday so you'd be sharing church I will be in Christ that way you'll be ready Monday through Saturday one of the worst days there ever was ever thing on the world's going wrong and all of a sudden a sweep goes over you I've told it to you before but it's a dream I had years ago we was at the old church brother was living sin was sent another tearing us I turned the front talking to some different Brothers and this is Brother Buzz that I noticed and I watched it begin with his fingertips and he'd reached his hand out to shake hands with somebody and I washed his hand it just went and his hand disappeared and he just swept over him I noticed other people some of y'all was there some of y'all was there in the dream and I noticed you was disappearing and I looked done at myself like this and it started with my feet I don't care where it starts it can solder my nose my ears I don't care as long as it starts and I watched myself with my eyes and I just wow and I was enveloped into another body Oh Glory to God so no matter what we have to go through because of his glory his grace his Mercy it is a light affliction but for a moment misspearance the Lord and maybe I'd like to be remembered today before the Lord Prince he knows where you are you know it's what you're going through maybe some of you are so low you're even lower than ashes you know when ashes can actually go back to acids and gases maybe you're saying dear God I've never been so low in my life never been through so much in my life listen for the voice of God to call your Phoenix Hallelujah praise the Lord oh thank you Lord Jesus how many just by the raising of your hand to the Lord Jesus now say Lord pass by my way today maybe some of you so physically weak maybe some of you are spiritually awake that's just all you can do to get your hand up Hallelujah but the Donnie win I don't know when how I don't even know how but I know he will David said I've been young and now I'm old I've never seen the righteous forsaken no his seed bacon bread David said yea though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me wherever you are today friends he sees you young people he knows what you're going through moms dads he knows where you are Heavenly Father what a right given to us the right to reign how different the ride is from the price we don't go through any of these things to pay a price to be good enough price I'm talking about is getting rid of our flawed character our imperfections really in reality Lord your people wouldn't want it any other way why in the world would we want our way easy enough stand up there beside Paul Peter James John many of our fathers and grandfathers and grandmothers and the price they paid Lord the breaking of the century when the gifts come back and they were laughed at ridiculed made fun of for dancing in the spirit and all that and we want to go through this life and go through nothing no sir I don't I'm not the first in line When Trials come I'm not I'm not the first in line I'm in trouble scrub but neither will I stand over on the sideline and say if you don't mind pass me on by Lord God I I want to be a part of you and suffering is a part of Who You Are so I must suffer our suffering will be determined by you for some it'll be physical for others it may be psychological it may be reproach for the way the dress on their job it can be all sorts of things Lord for the god call man much of what they go through it's not for themself Decades of my life I've went through one thing after another after another and the majority of it has had nothing to do with me that has to do with your people I bear their fusses their arguments they're fighting I bear their indifferences I Bear all of that I didn't cause none of it not one thing and yet if I don't handle it the way they want me to they get mad as a hornet at me and I'm bearing that for who for you because if it's left up to me when you call me as an 18 year old boy I told you then and I tell you tonight there's a 66 almost 67 year old man I can't preach I don't want to I don't know how please choose somebody else Lord the same with these people no doubt many of those burdens and their loads they would have never chose what they had to go for they would have never chose so hard and so difficult but it's your prerogative not ours so help us Lord Jesus oh Father May there be some births today I ain't talking about a new birth I'm talking about a conversion out of the ashes to where the will finally crumbles to a state of ultimate victory Hallelujah

God bless you thanks for Member Service Wednesday night that means it's been good to be in the house of the Lord remember the needs of our brothers and sisters I just have a little second going through various things of course that you're familiar with remember all that I'm sure many of you have heard brother Daryl whenever he will come up and pray and he won't mention every person on his prayer list but brother Daryl has quite a prayer list contacted from people around the world anyone not mention all of them by name whenever he's up here of course praying for us but he'll say Lord remember all those on our prayer list I was thinking about it yesterday and I thought you know I don't think that brother Daryl should be the only one that has one of those it probably good if all of us had one different Brothers different sisters and where you what I don't know what to pray for I can give you enough names to last you for about 40 days and 40 nights you need some help I think it'd be good for all of us well I can't remember that's why they make paper and pencil y'all still have paper and pencil all right you still have a phone where you can be able to put it on there just remember we've got so many that are sick and Afflicted and this is fulfilling the law of Christ by bearing one another's burdens go on the fear of God and remember the meetings come up this week remember pray for brother Ron Brother on still fighting this battle of course his own personal battle I tell him if he didn't feel he had enough strength to take the prayer line would go on with it ourself if need be but just pray for him that the Lord will be with him I know he'll want to be here and and endure and pray for absolutely every person that he can we're coming with great anticipation and expectation I feel sorry for the devil amen I feel sorry for the devils praise the Lord but then God bless you since love you in the Lord go on the fear of God what victory is mine
