[0:00] and my brother and my sister so many
[0:01] people have settled for false peace
[0:04] because if they'd be honest they've said
[0:06] they're tired of the struggle they're
[0:08] tired of the stress I know it's not of
[0:10] God and I know it's you know I got a
[0:12] repent for it but you know I just need
[0:14] oh I just need a break for the mat you
[0:16] don't understand I just need a I need a
[0:18] reprieve from all my troubles I I know
[0:22] I'm not consulted god no I'm not asked
[0:24] God no I'm not inquired of God
[0:28] but I just need a break can I can you
[0:31] can I get some slack here can you cut me
[0:33] some slack God just give me a break I'm
[0:36] I'm tired of the pressure I'm just gonna
[0:38] settle in six legs six legs fine it's a
[0:41] good City I could have my children there
[0:43] I can plant vineyards we could build a
[0:45] home and everything will be fine and
[0:47] Ziklag old but David don't you realize
[0:50] you're cutting yourself short God wants
[0:53] to give you the kingdom and you're
[0:55] settling for Ziklag
[0:58] God wants to give you the crown but
[1:01] you're settling for Ziklag oh why are
[1:04] you settling but the crown means
[1:06] struggle means stress it means trouble
[1:08] oh but the great will be the glory of
[1:10] fuel endure for a season always the
[1:13] Bible says the temporary light
[1:15] affliction of this present time shall
[1:17] not begin to compare with the glories
[1:20] that God has waiting for those who
[1:22] endure to the end oh my brother it is
[1:25] not revealed who's the son and daughter
[1:27] of God and he who starts the race
[1:29] because many start but the ultimate
[1:32] revealing isn't he who finishes the race
[1:37] and David has dwelled as many others
[1:40] have settled his thick leg and they've
[1:42] built a house in sick leg they still
[1:44] love godless and I'm not saying David
[1:46] didn't love the Lord he didn't go and
[1:48] serve a bed he didn't go and serve a god
[1:50] of bail he didn't start worshipping and
[1:52] letting his children worship you know he
[1:54] did David do not backslide into the
[1:55] world David just decided I'm still gonna
[1:58] serve God I still believe in Jehovah but
[2:00] I'm gonna dwell in Syd clay
[2:03] and many people have checked out because
[2:06] of stress and they've checked out from
[2:08] reality to fantasy you say all but I'm
[2:10] here this morning brother Matt and I'm
[2:12] here but are you really here I want to
[2:15] challenge you this morning you say well
[2:17] I'm here Anna are you really here are
[2:19] you really here is your heart and your
[2:21] purpose is right or are you just
[2:23] fulfilling a religious duty and pressure
[2:25] of their conscience telling you you
[2:27] should come to church on Sunday morning
[2:30] are you really here this morning always
[2:34] you take a company you have employees
[2:35] who are there for one reason check in
[2:37] and check out now there to collect a
[2:40] paycheck they don't want to deal with
[2:42] any of the problems then you have people
[2:43] who believe the company they believe in
[2:46] the inspiration behind it and God is not
[2:49] looking for soldiers who want to check
[2:51] in and check out on Sunday and Wednesday
[2:53] God is looking for an army who says I
[2:56] get behind my King David and I want to
[2:59] fight in their front lines for my team
[3:01] oh
[3:03] can you say Amen this morning I
[3:07] want to be a soldier brave and true keep
[3:10] on the firing line
