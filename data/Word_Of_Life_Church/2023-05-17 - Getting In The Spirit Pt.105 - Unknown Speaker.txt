spend an ending hours on my knees praising him for everything he's ever done for me I could never praise him enough for the cross of Calvary I could never thank him enough for salvation full and free I could never do anything to deserve such perfect much oh for everything he's done I could never Place him enough a thousand tongues could never tell just what the Lord has done as if he hadn't done enough he sent his only son to hang Upon A Rugged Cross and bear the load of sin that explains why I can't express the love I have for him enough for the cross [Music] [Music] who deserve such perfect

only one that could [Music] be there [Music] [Music] and the night clothes [Music] of the midnight call back [Music] when it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so how will it end Look to Him [Applause] [Music] folks are looking in lots of different directions and that they were living in of course it's been man's nature too look in all kinds of directions most generally man always looks in the wrong direction doesn't he most of us should be able to say men to the X that's what we did most of my life before the Lord got a hold of us and the sad part about it is we're still looking wrong direction sometimes after we get saved don't we let's turn tonight if it would the First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. we'll go back again tonight and uh consult the master builder on this scripture that we've looked at for a couple of services it's basically dealing with the works of ministers but we don't want to just focus on preachers alone how many believes it works are important for all of us every child of God First Corinthians 3 11 for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it so that's not just me now or every preacher that's in here but every one of you individuals the day will declare your works whether they've been good or where they've been selfish or whatever they are the day now that's all of us young middle-aged teenagers 20 whatever you are now what's going to try the fire because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work as what sort that it is if any man's work abides which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned you shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so is by fire now this separates works from your salvation I'm sure glad God does it that way too so you can imagine now there'll be all kinds of people that will come up live down through time like lot foolish virgin type there's been in every age and they themself the work will not stand a lot of these good people that we know the work will be destroyed absolutely annihilated and destroyed they'll have nothing nothing to be rewarded for but saved that's by far but what a wasted life what a wasted life to have lived 30 40 50 60 70 80 years and think you've done this and this and this and this for God but because it was off the wrong Foundation and then when you stand before him and when you stand there there's nothing with you or you're praying all your preaching if you're as a preacher all that you've done and you stand there with absolutely nothing they're standing there by yourself so you look around and say what in the world so each of us want to be careful doing that how many has a need to that let's just told that in our hearts as we go before the Lord Heavenly Father we counted such an awesome opportunity to be gathered together tonight we thank you so much for your presence we thank you for your word thank you for everything that you mean to us Lord Jesus as we Endeavor to look into your word tonight I pray that you'd help all of us begin with me father help me Lord God because I know that the sword Cuts two ways most coming and going so I pray that you'd begin with me and work on me and work on these people not only the visible but the invisible audience may we look at things somewhat different after tonight Lord help us to realize that if we live to ourself we live a selfish life then father we're not reflecting your life because eternal life is living for others and it's not living for those who love us it's actually living for those who hate us that's what you did so help us father as we look into your word that we can see we need to move higher we need to pray more we need to seek you more we need to get ourselves and our feelings and what we think about us so much our selfishness out of the way so the spirit of God can live through us granted to not father we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated now most of you have been saved long enough to know that we are not saved by works and the church said we are not saved by works we're not saved by anything that we do but works are important our works required for every individual that has eternal life well yes and no because eternal life will live itself out of us and express itself in the right types of Works once we understand that we become the channel by which eternal life can live out of in that works can be helping the poor it can be helping people at church it can be helping your neighbor as we would say that was a reference used quite a bit in the Bible about your neighbor and Jesus used that in the parable several times of course and yet it can go beyond those that live in your neighborhood it can go beyond those that live and you're cul-de-sac it can go for us say helping our brothers and sisters in Uganda Tanzania Zimbabwe India Philippines which we have by God's grace over the years but yet it's not even just those who agree with us because Jesus said the Publican and The Sinner can do that they love those that love them but eternal life goes beyond human life so eternal life enables us to love those that would absolutely kill us if they had a chance now how many have eternal life wow so eternal life is living for the man that would pull his 9mm out of his pocket pull back the hammer put it right up to the side of your head and blow your brains all over the pew but yet you would do something for him before he did that to you well I guess I'm also making all the call First shouldn't I now think about it eternal life is so easy to say it's so easy well I went up to the Altar and I got eternal life I accepted the Lord and I got eternal life I believe I have eternal life but eternal life has attributes and eternal life will Express Itself by works now one of those works is fasting now I've been asked in the last probably at least two months or so several times by people wanting to know about fasting and one of the reasons that I've been asked about it is several people has asked me about going on a fast for Erica for her healing and others have asked about fasting when should we fast how should we fast and I thought since we were dealing with this about works that we would look at this part tonight so instead of answering one person's question then another and then another and then another I'll answer them all from right here hopefully sometimes I make more than I answer which goes with that too but fasting of course is not a new thing in the New Testament it was something that the Jews did in the Old Testament it was something all through the law that they did but it does somewhat change in the New Testament and you remember the Republicans and the Pharisees they fasted often and they asked the Lord Jesus why is it that your disciples do not fast well he said while the bridegroom is with them there's no need for them to fast but do we fast for healing do we fast for faith now listen carefully you're doing good don't answer me so you won't get trapped do we fast for to please God do we fast to get God's attention turn with me to Matthew chapter 17 verse 14. and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a man a certain man kneeling down to him and saying Lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sorvax for off times he falls into the fire and off into the water and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him now listen carefully remember Jesus had sent them out seven chapters prior to this and Matthew 10. and he gave them power to cast out Devils heal the sick do many great things and they come back rejoicing and Jesus said I beheld Satan as Lightning cast down out of heaven so these apostles were sent forth under a power and it was that power that we looked at Sunday which is called excusion now it's nothing that they had within themselves by virtue of their own life but it was a jurisdiction and an authority that was given to them so they were sent out like a State Trooper like a magistrate like a judge somebody like that you go there you do this you do that that's how they operated and cast out Devils but now they run across one that this excusia Authority did not cover now I don't know if you understand this or not but I'll make it as simple as I can but demons are in different degrees now I don't understand myself why that somebody with epilepsy that that one is so hard but that Devil is a hard devil to get rid of as a matter of fact the prophet said it was the only one that ever got away from him so that tells you now this is why of course that he would tell the people to keep their children there if they didn't believe leave because that Spirit was going to leave and it was going to look not for a hog not for a bird not for a horse it's going to look for a human being to get into so the Lord Jesus watch now he's going to address this and the disciples no doubt they were shocked because they had just went out and they'd cast out all kinds of devils they had cleansed the leper they had healed all kinds of Affliction well this man brings his boy and he was a lunatic so he was of a further degree into this sickness and this possession then apparently anything they had run across when they were sent out prior to this now notice what the man says I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then Jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour now watch the apostles then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out now they're they're perplexed they just did not understand why couldn't we do this you sent us out in Matthew 10 to do this and we tried it we done exactly what we've done on all the others and it worked for them but it didn't work through him for this guy what was the problem now listen two aspects and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief well because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as of a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hints to Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing I know we quote it all the time that nothing is impossible with God but God said nothing is impossible to you now can anybody say been to that scripture now notice this is our God himself saying this if you'll say to this mountain remove him hence To Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you but now what so Jesus deals with first part of verse 20 an aspect the reason they could not do this and he crucified it as unbelief then Jesus comes down in verse 21 how be it this kind this kind now this was a different kind than what they had run into in Matthew 10. now the kind they had run into in Matthew 10 did not require require prayer and fasting the way this one did how could they do it under excusia Authority now remember there's two Greek words used for power one of them is excusio which is an authority the other is dunamis which is a power that's in You by Nature so it's something living in you the apostles didn't have that because it didn't have the Holy Ghost yet but what the Hat was a jurisdiction now once Jesus shows them how this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting prayer and fasting by whom now Jesus did not say well that the person that's sick this is not actually for the sick person it's actually for the person who's going to cast out the devil oh you didn't know that well you've learned something new tonight now watch Jesus is not dealing with the lunatic boy he's not dealing with the boy's father he's answering the apostles and they're they ask him the question why couldn't we do this and Jesus in verse 20 and verse 21 it said well the first phase of this was your unbelief and then secondly it's tied that you must pray and you must fast to get yourself out of the way now apparently because this power was not of an inward virtue and nature they were not connected from their soul to this excuse you because it could come and leave that's the way the prophets of the Old Testament worked under the anointing so it would come into prophesy visions and that it would leave it might leave him for weeks might leave them for months and then it would come back on them again but God didn't want that to be so in the New Testament age he wanted the Holy Ghost to be ever present every day of your life from the time you get it to the day you die it's yours but notice now the Lord Jesus then separates a certain degree of demonic warfare and he says that this particular kind can only come forth by prayer and fasting now again I say it is not so much the person that is sick and it is not so much other people that are fasting for the person that is sick now there's one thing that will tell you if you should fast or not I'm going to keep you wondering for a few minutes before I tell you what it is now what's the what's them says many times in these meetings sometimes fast for several days I've been fasting then three or four days and I do that because the Bible said these come out only by fast and prayer so once you notice now how the prophet applies this scripture of the Lord Jesus so it was not to the sick necessarily it was not even to other members of the body unless God would burden them to do so but the scripture was actually to be applied to the ministers that's going to Endeavor to cast out these evil spirits watch him again I usually like to fast about three days before the healing service so I told him I'd speak speaking to about a pastor there and if anyone there would pray for them just like a regular prayer line now what I found over and over again when the prophet would use the word fast fasting fasted all the forms of it that it would be making reference to either himself or other ministers that would fast to be able to get themselves out of the way now there were a few references as well to where that some people had fasted and they were fasting for brother Branham going out in the meetings and he actually called their name and said this brother setting right here and this sister right over here they have been fasting for several days for these services and he said that's why you see God moving the way he has ass but it's not that we fast in order to find favor with God now me my prior uh before coming to the message my prior understanding of being a Pentecostal and I was very legalistic so I fasted often three days five days seven days ten days 14 days not a week went by in my life that I did not fast some of those would be on a seven day fast we would be driving I'd be driving a tent truck setting up a tent 90 in the shade absolutely every week of your life sometimes going being Louisiana one night closed out be in Indiana the next night 21 days in a row and yet naughty one bite of food and I got to the spot if I did not do that I felt like God would not use me so I got under this legalistic view now God does not want us to do works even good works because of legalism you understand that he wants us to do it because we love him and we love his people now notice again the prophet said usually before I start in the prayer line I take three days of fasting and praying but notice he doesn't send a message to say to Minneapolis Saint Paul or or Duluth Minnesota or wherever he would go and say have the sick people to fast three days or have the local people to fast three days but it was something that he did himself why to get himself out of the way now even though no doubt a lot of My fasting was in vain I'm totally convinced of that in vain just legalism that's all but in my mind it made me feel better no because I done something and I felt like God but honor my face that is one pitiful situation because God does not move for us because we are so righteous and so good now sure we've got to live right there's things we have to do but notice when you come into this aspect of the ministry now for those of you that have never fasted very long time has ever fasted three days five Seven Ten fourteen gets fewer and fear and fewer and the thing of it is most of you will never need to so don't feel bad don't leave your not thinking oh my goodness I'm I've never done nothing for god well first of all there's nothing in the Bible that even requires you to do that 14 days as a matter of fact the prophet deals with an enticing Spirits it was a big thing in Pentecost everybody wanting to fast 40 days and the prophet dealt with it and said for some people it was demons getting on them to fast for 40 days not the Holy Ghost now let me just go ahead and blow you away right now if God ever leads you to fast you will not get hungry yup y'all like me you realize you've wasted a lot of good food ain't you you will not get hungry until it's time for you to end that fast that's what I said I'm convinced I've totally ruined most of mine because I was hungry from day one because whenever I know that I'm on the fast and I miss my 10 o'clock snap my little guts eating my big gut and in my big gut eats my little one and by lunchtime and by by supper time we think Lord I'll never make it I might as well have went ahead and eat because it's a good sign God never put me on the fast there's a supernatural element that comes with God leading you to fast and one of those Supernatural elements is you will not be hungry I'll go ahead and look at me funny and I'll prove it to you in a minute now watch this again the prophet said this has been a fast day fasting and praying that God would Grant his prayer His blessings upon you people tonight now I don't expect you to understand this but I found it myself that whenever somehow you get weaker and you get less of yourself and you get more out of the way the more that he can move through you and yet it's only like you've got a small margin of error to where you get out of the way and then you're so weak that you can't even be used does that make sense to you it's like you've got to get out of the way and the more you deny yourself and the more you know the more God lets you go through something and say Lord have mercy I I can't take another day I can't I can't get through another day with all this pressure and yet I've seen it myself that when you get to that spot God will do some of the greatest things he's ever done in your life when you're right there but yet if you go just a little bit too far the other way you'll have a breakdown it's it's absolutely phenomenal look at Elijah when he had come to that very spot and it's like he was there in that that margin but he went just a little bit farther over the other way and had a nervous breakdown under of course the junior portrayed where God found it so there's something about fasting and you're giving of yourself well and the anointing coming on you and you're you're dealing with demons of course and you're dealing with God's people at the same time and you've got to be so careful when you're there in that realm and yet you'll get so far out of yourself it's always been with me even when I was a Pentecostal preacher it will start in my fingers the tips of my fingers my fingers I'll start losing feeling it'll start working its way up you'll notice me sometimes when I'm praying for people and I'll I'll do this because I'm starting to lose feeling in my hands at the same times it reaches up about here I start losing it in my lips it'll work out of my lips and come up around my mouth and I get to where I can't hardly talk I can't hardly say anything whenever I'm preaching it's been since I was a boy preacher I'll start seeing spots before me I'll see it to the right I'll see it to the left it'll be dark star much like this in my peripheral vision and then it'll start coming closer and closer when it moves here I better stop or I'm fixing to get in trouble now God gives you those things as just a warning remember the man that was with brother Branham they would watch him in the visions and Bennett Paul or whoever the manager of the campaign they would come up and they would put their hands on brother random side like this and if brother Branham would take his arms and put down on their hands it was a sign to them so it would let them know he's all right or he's not all right and if he one sign was he wasn't all right take him off take him off so they would take him off the platform if the other one was there then he would be able to let them know he's all right for a little while longer now what is he he's in that margin that fine margin to where the most will be done when you're right there but you're almost close to the spot yourself that you're about to lose Consciousness you're about to lose from the realm that's all around you and you're getting I hope ain't hoping you know maybe not you don't think I'm a Nut tonight but it's to where you're just in that spot now this is of course what fasting does and it helps to be able to get yourself out of the way to where you're getting weaker and weaker it's like the weaker you get the stronger the anointing will get and you've seen the long prayer lines down the youth camp and places like that and whenever you get so weak and the brothers will watch in they can see your knees buckling and this and that and they'll grab you but you know yourself you hate to sit down worse than anything because the anointing is at its peak and you want to be right there in the middle of it you want to stay right there as long as you can and yet the spirit of God is always there to help us but it's like the more he can get us out of the way the more he can use us so here the Lord Jesus is speaking something to the to the disciples pre-holy ghost of course and no doubt they pondered about how in the world could that be but after the Holy Ghost come you imagine brother John he brought this back to their memory now I know what he meant now I understand now I've got dunamis inside of me which will help me to get out of the way and I will fast or I will pray I will be in that presence of God and it will help me now once again the prophet said usually in a fast I never feel hungry if you feel hungry it's time to eat Jesus afterwards was hungry now he's based on this on the scripture whether Jesus fasted 40 days and nights and then the Bible says and afterward he was a hunger it doesn't say he was hungry on day two day three 38 but the hunger returned to him so it was a sign that he was to eat but you see tradition what tradition does tradition is so far away so many times from the word notice again an enticing spirit says nothing in the word that tells you to have a 40-day fast not a thing there's nothing in the world telling you to fast lest God would tell you and if you fast you ain't going to get hungry and go all these things after your fasting brother you will be joy and happy all the time and that's why I'm telling you a lot of my fashion was an absolute waste because I become one hungry Grouch [Music] yeah I did I mean I didn't feel good I was wore out you're putting up a tent whatever more you can't already go you drag yourself in you're aching and hurting all over and you're as weak as I don't know what you ain't got enough strength or to do anything I didn't have no happiness I wasn't joyful well that's what I say if it's a real fast from God it's going to go but the direction God says but yet this is a work which could be done that's not laying in harmony with the scripture many times so people because of old Pentecostal ideas or whatever more just their own conception of it well I'm going to do this and I'm going to fast for so and so to be healed and I'm going to fast for Faith and I'm going to fast for that fasting is to get ourself out of the way amen now notice after your fasting brother you'll be joy and happy all the time it said don't appear before men like Hypocrites with a long sad face I'm on a 40-day fast my plates won't fit me anymore now he's talking about Dentures my plates won't fit me no more I've lost 30 pounds and they told me I looked better after this is over oh nonsense it's enticing spirits of the devil amen and the church said no so you know I know it's maybe hard for you to believe but why in the world would anybody want to go on a 40-day fashion to be of the devil well some of them it's amazing what Pride they get it's amazing how they have to tell everybody they just come off of a 40-day fast and there was such uh listen I've heard it over and over again I know this is not something that I've read about I've heard it over and over again and yet you realize and you know even back then there's something wrong about the whole thing but you didn't know what it was thank God for the truth notice again it says Christianity is not something God's not one you have to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve so when we fast we are not doing it to plead with God and beg God look friends we are not Beggars we are sons and daughters and how are we supposed to come the Throne of God what's boldness not as a beggar my goodness we don't come like what we're we live in the you know the South Side of Heaven and we ain't got no blessings and oh Lord just give me a calm from the table and I I don't need nothing else God's Prophet said if you're a child of God everything he purchased is yours you've got to bring them quotes and them scriptures together you live under that mentality well I'm just an old dog well you might have been an old dog but if you've got the Holy Ghost you'll end the dog no more you're a child of God filled with eternal life and the Holy Ghost so we don't have to come to God it's so easy for us if we're not careful and the time of distress and trouble we get back into the begging notion the begging and the pleading notion as if though that somehow we lose our status as children of God we don't have to do that notice God's not one you have to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve and everything like that to get to certainly not I'm not degrading a fast now I'm down in the quote it says I believe in fasting certainly but when you fast you don't hunger Jesus after he got through fasting the Bible said he was hungry God puts a fast on you you don't put it on yourself God puts a fast on you you don't put it on yourself and the church said amen so then if people could get in this and they oh I'm doing this for God I'm doing this I'm doing that but if it doesn't line up to the teaching of the message it works and sacrifices that they have done but there won't be no reward for it why it's not based on the scripture or the message look friends if we're going to be rewarded for what we do it must match God's protocol or God's requirement or they don't get rewarded for it my goodness why would we want to waste our time I don't want to waste mine to you my goodness why waste some good beans and maters and taters if God don't put it on me why should I feel bad I'm going to enjoy my wife's good cooking if God puts a fast on me then I trust God will lead me to do it and he'll let me know whenever it's time for me to quit but I am not going to fast well I don't want to fast because I need to be closer to God where's that in the Bible or is that in the message well Amen Brother Don notice down in Beaumont he said so I've been fasting for about two three days and I was going to go preach that afternoon I thought well it seems like he said you never want to fast until you're led to fast then if you get hungry it's time to eat again he says when God puts a fast on you you don't get hungry so if you start fasting it's quarter to seven and by nine your big guts eating your little gut well you just know right there you don't miss God a brother Donnie the word did you figure out won't get hungry well because this is the teaching of the message to start serpent eat water baptism and it's also the scripture that's how I figure because if God puts it on us to fast there is a supernatural element in the fast it won't let you get hungry [Applause] thank you Jesus I see everybody's going out after supper and need a Big Mac huh after church so he said when God puts a fast on you you don't get hungry it's God dealing with you Jesus was afterwards and hunger see after his fast was over now notice again in fundamental Foundation of Faith as I've said Faith doesn't come by fasting Faith doesn't come but what I'm fasting for more faith you're wrong you don't fast for more faith oh my goodness well I guess I should have preached this 20 years ago and said it tonight huh Faith doesn't come by praying reading a book all of that's good fasting praying reading reading a book but faith comes by a saddle something that's in the human heart that tells you just as sure as you come to this church tonight so if God lays on your heart to fast fast my brother fast my sister and if you go to the end of the day and all of a sudden you get hungry that's the time to break your fast if you go all day long and you don't feel hungry you get up the next day you don't feel hungry How will I know brother Donnie you've got to let you know the supernatural will move off of your belly and the belly will go to talking to you it's that simple it's not complicated if it's a day a half a day do you understand or if you've ever said to this or not brother Brennan acts of the days that it would go totally without food three to four days before prayer lines that would also be days that he would eat what he called soft foods not pleasant Foods Pleasant Foods now it did not give us a list so I don't know what they were but apparently it was something that he deprived himself of something that was pleasant something else he would eat for energy strength and so on but it was something what's the whole thing about it's to deny ourselves you see God knows that as long as we're here and these bodies we're going to wrestle we're going to wrestle against our old flesh and it'll be our constant enemy now how many beliefs tonight by God's word that works are absolutely something that every child of God will have in their life every child of God now whether you're a teenager tonight or you've been saved for 40 or 50 years it doesn't really matter every child of God when we stand before the Lord you young people here it will not be you and your mom and your dad and God will stand and look at you all as a family unit and say okay I see that you are Joel's son so you all Stand Together your mom Tamika your two brothers y'all stand there together no it won't be that you'll stand together so much as a family but we will walk before this great Throne of our Lord Jesus not the white Judgment of Revelation 21 but word rewards are given out every young person that if the Rapture takes place in their 15 16 17 years old they will stand before the Lord and they will give an account for what they have done the works that they have done for the kingdom of God Acts chapter 9 verse 36. now there was that japa a certain disciple named Tabitha wow a woman called a disciple a certain disciple Now read your Bible and you'll notice most of the time it was in reference to men but this woman she must have been a very outstanding sister now there was that Joppa a certain disciple called named Tabitha which is by interpretation it's called Dorcas this woman was full full I love this word filled up as opposed to empty this woman was full thoroughly permeated thoroughly permeated with complete like nothing so this woman was full of good works and alms Deeds look at this word mercy pity especially is exhibited and giving alms charity or donations to the poor so this woman had all kinds of good works and yet we know that she was not a woman preacher we know that as far as the Bible it does not record that she prophesied spoke in tongues had Visions dreams anything like that but the Bible is going to tell us what she did now listen carefully and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died human they had washed they later in an upper chamber for as much as lit up was nigh unto Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them then Peter arose and went to them when he was come they brought him to him into the upper chamber now notice he's right here they took the sister straight up there and they laid her down all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them now notice what a lot of her Works consisted of no casting out Devils no heat in the sick no raising the dead but this sister had the ability to sow so here was these people and they were even either wearing them or had had them in their hands and they were showing Peter look what their sister did for me I want you to look at the shawl look at this sweater uh look at this dress look at this you know cloak whatever it was I want you to look and that was just all kinds of them that was around and no doubt some of the other people that did not have sown Goods by which Tabitha had made them they would say well she gave me an armstein now an arms deeper is not a tangible piece of material but it was something that she did for them a little pity a little Mercy maybe she walked by them one day and they were begging on the street or she saw them as they went to get some fruits and vegetables at the market that day and she saw that when they come up to pay for it and they counted the little money and they didn't have enough to pay for it so she sneaked up there and said how much does she like well she likes uh three shekels okay well legit let me take care of that and you know that they was and they said that she'd done this for me and she done that for me now keep in mind what is fixing to happen in her life is not based upon her works but neither did it go against her she's fixing to be raised from the dead now I've often wondered about reading of this woman if she would have been a Christian that never really did anything for anybody else but she lived what I call a Lone Ranger Christian Life now we've got a lot of them around the message they feel like they don't have to go to church they can stay home and be just as good a Christian as they can a church if you believe God's prophet he told you you cannot do such a thing and besides that you are robbing yourself and robbing the saints of God by staying home there are no such a thing in the New Testament as a Lone Ranger Christian well praise the Lord that ain't even you and Tonto either it's a body and we're supposed to help one another and minister to one another Now The Lone Ranger type Christians if they're died like this nobody stands there and brings any coats nobody brings any arms Deeds why they stayed at home they never helped nobody they never done nothing for nobody they stayed at home and they stayed away from church they stayed away from fellowship well I'll tell you one thing if I ever do die and I hope I do get to be raised from the dead I want so many folks flocking in this church they stand Plum outside there said he done this for man he done that for many done that for me well come on do something look at me that way I don't want it done just for rewards sake that's the kind of Christian I want to be I want to live my life every day for others now I want you to sing if you and I would start keeping a record of how much time daily that we spend for ourself how much of our thoughts are for ourselves how much of what we do is for ourselves I wonder we would do that for a couple of weeks if we would be absolutely surprised at how much of our time how much of our things of life that we have that we would wind up seeing was entirely for us come on now and yet the Lord keeps no record of any of that [Music] according to the Bible there is a book of remembrance that God is having written on your account but none of that involves things you do for yourself I bought myself this and I've done this for myself and I've done that for myself and I bragged on myself too and I looked in the mirror for 45 minutes I tell you what I've seen some man that's just about a primpers as women are what are you doing worshiping you're worshiping that bald head of yours and you worshiping the 14 strands of hair that you got left you think they're so handsome and so cute that you can stand there before him here or brother let me just tell you need to look in my Mary it tells the truth some of y'all must have a line mirror where'd you get that thing send it back to Amazon get you one of them truth-telling beers it'll show every wrinkle ever gray half amen so this sister nothing is mentioned about herself but it's mentioned about others now remember Luke was the author of the book of Acts Luke wasn't even around when Jesus was here Matthew Mark and John Ward were but Luke was not even there but Luke came years later and went around from Community to community City to city and interviewing Witnesses live Witnesses so he would be able to write down the gospel of the Book of Luke and also the book of Acts so no doubt Luke went to the city of Joppa and he must have went to lit up and he went there asking because this was the mannerism of Luke so he wants to ask you anybody here know of sister Tabitha anybody know about that account I've heard about it but Matthew didn't write about it some of the others I I want to write this I want to write about this Paul never mentioned it none the rest of the other was written I want to know about this so Luke went around and getting eyewitnesses what was you there yes I was I was one of them sisters our glory to call I'll never forget that that day I'll tell you one thing we're standing there weeping and all of a sudden she jumped up running around there clap in her hands and worshiping God you'll imagine Luke say yes sister tell me how I was I'll tell you what no sister so-and-so down the street there she was there too and that guy down there selling pumpkins on the side of the road he was down there too and you imagine Luke going from one to the other to the other in order to write this down aren't you glad they done that aren't you glad these were men of vision where would we be today if these men had not wanted to write down these very acts of the Holy Ghost so here they began to cry no doubt and they lament and whenever they do they sin and get Peter and then all the witness said by him weeping and showing the coat and the garments which Dorcas had made while she was with sin but Peter put them all for us and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body I want you to notice he turned to the body but he calls her name he didn't call her body by this name notice how Luke separates the body from the person turning him to the body and said Tabitha so he turns to the body the house where she lived but he called her name she was out there in another dimension somewhere her spirit had to be brought back into the body so the human name was still identified with that soul in those Realms somewhere where they went to so he turns to the body the empty house and he calls her I wonder why he didn't call her Dorcas but he calls her apparently by her preferred spiritual name now he calls her name and watch what happens and turning him to the body said Tabitha arise and sheep opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she set up so here is a response but I find it so amazing now that these works and the identification of works and arms Deeds are identified with this woman and being the type of woman that she was oh don't you want to be this type of woman now who would ever think that making somebody a coat or a cloak or giving them a garment or showing them a little bit of pity or a little bit of mercy and you bought them a meal or you know just just something like that that was so simple who would ever think that would make the pages of the New Testament what if it made the pages of the New Testament here in this that we've just read and we are another book of Acts don't you figure there'll be people in this second book of Acts that it'll be wrote in their life as well amen notice Acts chapter 10 verse 34 then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth now this is after the Gentiles had received the Holy Ghost I perceive that God is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and work us righteousness workers righteousness so we cannot make righteousness but we work it so when we become righteous which is right standing with God we work in the form of righteousness and we live that out that every nation he that feareth God and work us righteousness is accepted with him Romans 2 9. tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that do us evil of the Jew first and of also the Gentile but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good now notice what you will get in this life if you do good works oh my glory honor and peace to every man that work us good to the Jew first also to the Gentiles and what will you get if you don't tribulation and anguish second Corinthians 9 8 and God is able to make all Grace I love this word it is absolutely astounding to make all Grace So God's grace is like an ocean at full time so what's how Paul ties this together so God is able to make all grace abound towards you now the word abound is like a plant or that'll put out a flower and it's right at the budding stage and then the abounding of that means it opens a little farther and a little farther and a little farther and it keeps on opening and opening until it reaches its pristine fullness and that's when the bloom is fully open so your power is saying that the grace of God will abound to you towards you that ye always having all sufficiency you see all Grace leads to all the other alls you'll ever need in life oh my so if you have oh Grace I don't want just Grace to just get saved by I want this right here all Grace make all grace abound towards you that you always have all sufficiency in all things so if you have all Grace you will have all sufficiency in all say I don't care what you're going through I don't care how low it is God will not leave you God will not forsake you somebody say Amen you always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work all praise God so you'll have sufficiency for every good work notice again Ephesians 2 10. for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works so we are God's workmanship his building and we are actually created which is schizo to make habitable to completely change or transform so where is workmanship created in Christ Jesus and this is what you created for not to just come to church not to be a pretty good Christian but we're created unto good works praise the Lord which God has before ordained that we should walk in them and the Saints said first Timothy 2 9 and like manner also that the women shall Adorn themselves and modest apparel with shame facingness and sobriety not with boarded hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which become us women professing godliness with good works so now here we come again to Sisters of what they can do now Paul does not go through there and so they'll cook somebody a pie make somebody a pound of cornbread do this or that but they should be able to find by their vocation that what God would want them to do so good works is not limited just to preachers it's not just limited to the deacons and the other ministers but God wants every member of his body to be up and about the father's business doing something to further Advance the kingdom of God which are the people of God now you remember whenever the prophecy came forth in Clifton's Cafeteria in 1961 and Danny Henry had come up and he could put his arms around brother Branham and he started speaking in French well he said he did not know French of course a couple of people stood up Anisha and then a third one stood up and they wrote down what was said and it was French so it was turned around and interpreted womans to interpret the U.N and did you remember the story and the prophecy that came forth was you had chose the harder past the harder way and it was my way and because of this a huge portion of Heaven awaits they a huge portion now and I would come into the the side of rewards everyone in Heaven will not get the same reward not according to the Bible as a matter of fact Jesus said some would lose their reward some would have a great reward but not everybody what will determine that works Works what you do for God what God calls you to do and your desire to be able to help others that's why the Bible also tells us in the New Testament but that we're supposed to do good and treat people good especially them of the household of faith because there's something about being good to God's people now how many if you were here in the days of the Lord Jesus you would have loved about Jesus a pair of shoes if you to walk by Jesus on the way to Damascus or Jericho and the Lord Jesus was barefooted if you had to put it on a credit card if you would have had to sow something another to buy Jesus a pair of shoes how many of us would have done it why nearly every one of us would happen well why did Jesus needed a change of garment if Jesus needed a meal if Jesus needed some bread and he was hungry would we do the same thing of course we would well now we have the opportunity to do the same thing for his body no I'm not fixing to lift an offer but we should feel the same way that we would be able to do something to a member of his body praise the Lord and you realize the Lord Jesus the way he looks at it he would rather you do it for his body than you would for him notice this Paul goes on to say in first Timothy 5 9 about a widow let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old now here this is whenever the church is starting to do a little bit of a spiritual welfare type of the thing to wear that the widows that were did not have social security and things the way we do today so whenever their husbands would die uh many of them did not have any way of provision their dollar was already gone they had no way of making a living but they even at that had restrictions and requirements that must be met so a woman could not be taken under the care of the church the local body unless of course she was at this age three school years old which was 60 and having been the wife of one man which is odd I find well reported of for good works now notice if the woman never done good works she would actually be disqualified from being taken care of by the church I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in your Bible now you see many many people feel like that the church ought to take care of them and whatever they need and whatever they need it we have people all the time I don't even know how much money I give away whenever we were here building this church because people drop in I need ten dollars for gas I need twenty dollars for this I need five dollars for that and I need 10 for something else brother Donna they might have been Angels not with the smell of cigarette smoke on them no but the smell is marijuana smoke on them no Angels don't smoke they don't they just don't do that but yet the best way the people look at it well the church my goodness the deacons have to turn people away all the time because people have it in their mind that the church should just do this and do that in the other but if you read your Bible you realize that there was requirements and qualifications that must be met so this woman might have been a good woman she might have been the wife of one man but yet nobody could really say much about the sisters she's 60 years old and she hasn't really done a lot for anybody else and we know that we have people like that in the church that they want and they want and they want and they want from the church but when it comes for them ever giving back to help others they don't ever do it oh dear Jesus I'll be standing on the side of the road tomorrow with a sign in my hand and your brother's hiring notice well reported for good works if she are brought up children if she had large strangers if she have washed the Saints feet if she have relieved The Afflicted why in the world are we asking things like this because this woman is expecting to be serviced by the church what if she's going to be serviced by the church she's got to have a life of service that proves she's worthy of such service and the church said ouch amen oh me or something all right thank you you're still with me notice so she got the Lord strangers washed the Saints feet what's it was a sign of humility of course now this was not just in church remember foot washing basically the only time we do it's in church but this was a custom among them so when a stranger would come in this was their Hospitality even if they lived in a tent and they were more like a bed one they would still bring you in and they would wash your feet and they would give you something cool to drink and they would offer you food so you know this was a requirement for this type of a person if she had diligently followed every good work my goodness you mean this was required just to help a sister financially praise the Lord again First Timothy 6 17 charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the Living God who give us us notice give us us richly all things to enjoy that they do good that they be rich and good works wow what a strange thing to say to Rich folks now if you're rich then the Bible tells you to be rich in Good Works and no it don't count to you it's got to be out of your house oh shoot now all you say oh my goodness brother Donnie I'm not rich oh there's not a person here tonight that's not rich but I only draw 400 a month but you're a rich person compared to the people I've seen in India and Uganda and Tanzania and Kenya and Zimbabwe and different parts of the world Robert yes every person here is a rich person compared to them but you see we compare ourselves to people that are richer than we are and we say well I I I can't do that am I going to let all so and so let them do they drive these big fancy Vehicles right and I see them pull in the church parking lot with them Vehicles my fingers tired on with bailing wire my my tires just a thing you could read the newspaper sir well I ain't got nothing glory to God that little widow woman come right up there and was going to cast her two mites into it and the Lord Jesus did not stop her because the prophet said he knew it had a greater blessing for her we can give and also many times we give out of our need not out of our abundance you see the Lord does not just look at always how much a person gives but he looks at how much they got left now a rich person might be able to give ten thousand dollars and somebody says Lord have mercy I could never do nothing like that ten thousand dollars to a rich man wouldn't be a bit more than 500 to those of you that are average type person so God wouldn't just say man what an offering but God looks and said that God had 12 million left they ain't give that much well dear Jesus I'm leaving while the getting is good look friends what do we once said about us when we stand before him from the books are open oh my God that they do good that they be rich and good works ready to distribute willing to communicate second Timothy 3 16 all scriptures given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God now here we're talking to preachers may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works so it's not just required that the lay people do good works it's required even more of preachers praise the Lord notice again Titus 2 7. in all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works in Doctrine showing uncorruptness gravity sincerity verse 14 talking about Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people now listen we're talking about bride listen at one of the traits that you don't hear spoken of very much around a bright message A peculiar people sell us zealous of good works zealous of good works let's stand I ain't dying but I'll give you a breather until next time [Applause] to purify unto himself A peculiar people zealous not jealous now not jealous only one letter difference but zealous which means you have a zeal so it ain't like you've got to be talked into doing it you're chomping at the bits what can I do what can I do is there anything I can do for the church a lot of us ain't going to ask that because we are scared to death somebody will say uh oh my what about brother Donnie what can some of us young people do we don't we don't preach well really you want me to help you huh all right but remember from this night forward you'll be held accountable how many of you has ever visited those that are homeless just walk up to him on the street ask him you know Jesus it's a better life what about some of our Saints who can't come to church any have you ever thought about getting a guitar and a tambourine going to send them singing a few songs to him to let them know we have not forgotten them all but we're too busy shooting basketball in the gym well let me just tell you right up front no rewards given for basketball in the gym I am at the retirement age I mean if you all want to speed it up a little bit you know think of it France if the Lord Jesus would call The Rapture tonight or call us individually what do you have to lay before him But I me and mine and I'm so busy and I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm that's what I'm talking about that's where so many of God's people live in that world of ah and me and mine may God help us how many wants to be zealous of good marks if I needed a pair of shoes and I and I didn't have the money to buy them how many of y'all would buy me a pair all of you yeah so what if there's somebody else in the church that's not the pastor that would need him if I was 500 short on making a payment of something electricity or making some kind of payment would y'all help me make it you would wouldn't you well what about somebody else in our church you see when we do it with respect to persons well I can only do stuff like that for brother Donnie and brother Daryl I just can't I mean I can't risk that I can't rest can't risk what helping a little insignificant nameless individual that the Lord Jesus died for I know you think I'm crazy already but I try to shower my kindness and my goodness Everywhere I Go I've got a reputation all over Johnson City Wendy's drive-throughs McDonald's drive-throughs Burger King drive-throughs Hardee's drive through donut Carol me and Carol pulled up to Wendy's the other day and ordered something to drink coming from Home Depot the woman thought she recognized my voice black lady I gotta pray front she smile said oh it's you good to see you all and she reaches over to Carol and looked at her Carol said you're nice to people you're kind to people she said you come at the right time because apparently the person in front of her and I just thought I hope it ain't somebody I go to church with they let her have it and she said you come right at the right time you'd be surprised what a smile are we so short of it always so short of kindness and goodness and good words how many wants to be a different person than when you come in here tonight I do praise the Lord I figure that my guardian angels bless their hearts they have Alpha's time ever was with me because I beat and thrash I turn skin off I hit myself I do I'm just finishing up a pretty good sized project that I had to do and I told Carol I said probably when the guardian angel heard me say I was fixing to do that they said oh dear God no I told her the other day I said probably when I stand before the Lord the Lord will give them my reward I won't even get one they had such a time watching over me but not on one thing when I stand before God I'm not sending an empty-handed I'm going to do what I can not for reward's sake because I'm zealous of good works I'm zealous anybody else in here zealous you just want what Can I Do Lord what can I do what what can I do for the body you don't want I do I walked outside my office door a while ago before I come out here walked around on the parking lot and picked up some paper trash paper I picked up some gravels and throw them back over in there I picked up a few sprigs of green grass I don't like green grass going on in them gravel nobody's seen me nobody knowed it but I knowed it I'd rather pick up piece of paper around the house of God David said to be able to just be a door bat at the house of God I'd rather do that than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season oh my I'll tell you one thing if we could get a building High full of Word of Life people that have that attitude you're talking about changing us but brother don't want Revival uh-huh and this is on the way to it yeah I would get something that when the emotions died down and the screamings died down that this is the kind of life you live when you hit the road out here I don't want something that'll just get you all pumped up and all cranked up when the music is gone and then you're as grouchy as all get out whenever you leave we want something that'll help us to live a Godly life on Monday it'll help us to live it on Thursday it'll help us to live it on Friday every day of the week we're trying to do something we're trying to be kind we're trying to help people because that's what Jesus did let's bury it o Heavenly Father I pray you'd forgive us Lord how much of our time have we spent for frivolous things Lord if we would as I said just start next week keep a little record of how much time we've spent for us how much thoughts in our mind we spend for us and about us we don't think of others contemplate what we can do for others or zealous about ourself some of us will move Beyond ourselves and move over into our immediate family the Lord Jesus when you came you love those that hated you those that despised you and even those who crucified you drove the nails in your hands you said father forgive them for they know not what they do Lord God I Repent tonight father [Music] here in a couple of months I'll be 67 years old and I look at my life and I think Lord have mercy what have I done thank you how much time have I wasted just a few more settings of the Sun and I'll be too old to travel much [Music] before long they won't want me to preach here no more I'll get slow and old and won't be able to think of it the way I used to could and they'll be looking for a younger guy to take this place Lord God I pray help me Lord Jesus I don't desire a reward you know the way I've done things for decades done all kinds of things around the world and funneled it through other people and churches so they won't even know who it come from I'm not doing anything for recognition I do it because I'm zealous of good works I'm not buying my salvation I'm not buying favor salvation is what you did for me my works is what I do back for you Lord May each of us here tonight leave and Ponder and think Lord what more could I do is there something more I could do for the body is there something Lord I could do around the church this was something I could do to help brother Donnie what about the other ministers Lord maybe I could start sending people just cards and tell them that I love them and I'm praying for them maybe I could I could just drop a note every now and then to those that are homebound Lord maybe a few of us could start going to the nursing homes we could do something just do something not sit around and wait maybe we could do something [Music] Hallelujah change us tonight Lord changes oh geez Jesus please use me and oh Lord don't refuse me for sure there's a work that I can do think about it now I need and even though it's humble so in a coat mending my sweater mending a pair of socks to crumble for the cost be great our word for you I'll stand for thee dear Jesus I'll stand for

praise the Lord let me just give you a little update on Erica before we go they just got her in a room this evening maybe about six o'clock something like that been been in the ER for the last two days waiting to get get into a room you'd not believe how many people are lined up and down the hallways of the ER just people everywhere people so sick just just breaks your heart but she has a pretty pretty acute pancreatitis also I mentioned to you that had found some lesions in her brain and the Radiologists came today Carol was there with her and they mapped her brain and they're going to give her some treatments for that they have a 80 percent success rate and even if they had two we're still believing for better amen aren't we so while she is in the hospital recover recuperating rather from the pancreatitis it might even possibly start the treatment tomorrow they said she'd probably have to have 10 of those that'll be Monday through Friday and not on the weekend so if you would help us pray about that I know we've asked you so much for prayer but I know that you want to know which is why that I tell you and we're encouraged we're encouraged in the Lord amen because our god reigns amen amen until God tells us any different we're going to keep right on applying his word and get claiming his promise and believing that he is a Healer amen is that right amen that's exactly right oh yeah the devil talks to you oh yeah yeah he talks to you let me just tell you what he told me yesterday he said if you will let up on me I'll roll that up on her now can you imagine how that makes you feel so in other words he wants to blame me but I saw his hand on Sunday he don't have a one in hand he's a liar praise the Lord amen and he ain't calling the shots no way my Lord's still in charge of all this don't you appreciate the Lord God bless you I miss glad brother Louie's back with us and able to sing and [Music] did you enjoy the word of the Lord tonight need help if you don't raise both hands something wrong with every one of you I needed help tonight don't you the Lord Jesus uses for your glory brother Mike Walsh slipped in just a while ago and didn't even know it until somebody told me brother Mike would you come here just one second buddy brother Mike where's he at we love you buddy we sure appreciate you I want you to offer a word of prayer for us tonight that God will help us to do what our pastor just told us to do pray for us we'll pray for you God bless you little brother Mike don't we amen today when I'll tell you I woke up at around seven this morning first thing on my mind with sister Erica and the Holy Spirit dealt with my heart [Music] I always like to know that he's in control amen amen I made sure to try to slip in where I couldn't be seen too easily I don't like to make a show but when God speaks he's going to do something and I was standing Lord if you want me to say something you just you just make the way I I don't want to do anything and I figured brother Louie's just going to go ahead and close the service I didn't even know he noticed me but the whole the whole Spirit just poked in my heart and I want you to remind you that sister Erica the faith that she's had through all that she's been through that's nothing but God watching over her and I know y'all know that but in my heart the Lord wanted me to tell you we love her we pray for her every service at our church and we know that God's a Healer and he's used this trial for some reason but God the devil can't win no matter what happens the devil don't win we're winners no matter what but the Holy Spirit dealt with my heart that the whole church not just my voice but this whole church tonight should pray when brother Donnie started that message about fasting I knew where he was going with that [Music] in my heart I know you can't just do this but what you can do is pray whether you fasted or not it's by faith that we believe this and I don't believe he would open me up this morning with that on my mind if he didn't want us to do it don't listen to me I'm going to back away from away from his microphone that's a work of Prayer let's work up love that's a work of faith that's something you can do tonight for our precious sister who's went through so much God's able whatever he's going to do for her so you want to do something open your mouth yes sir if it was my daughter or my granddaughter how would I feel you got to step into those shoes this man he preaches his heart out I know that but he's carrying a load That's Heavy he needs you to help him carry this burden and I know you are but I'm just here to encourage you this is God's man and he's using him he spoke to my heart tonight I needed that I needed it I needed the strength of the word to help me let's pray your lord Jesus this congregation this people of God are here together Lord [Music] and I don't hear them saying much but Lord they need to open their mouth they need to cry out Lord Jesus The Works that we can do Lord let's put our faith in action faith of that works is dead tonight and we stand here to give you glory and to give you honor Lord all that sister Erica has been true yet her faith has carried her this far her desire to serve you Lord has held her this much and tonight Lord we place her in your hands Lord we have the winning hand tonight that you're standing in the midst of the people of God and how the enemy has fallen every side of the Lord you know my heart all the day long I've been wondering Lord what would you do how could you move with people would begin to pray from the depths of their soul to try out and say Lord come to our little sister the Lord do something for her tonight we know the devil hates brother Donnie he hates this message he hates our Prophet but it doesn't matter oh God those of us who trust you and believe you with all of our heart we're not surrendering we're not turning around we're not backing
