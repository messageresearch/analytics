thank you Jesus well god bless you it's so good to be here amen again I trust that the word was a blessing to you last night amen and that God spoke to you in a real special way and then I'm so glad the Lord moved like he did you know sometimes we really need the Lord to move and I'm so glad he always does when we need him most amen I told the brothers in the back I've traveled 4,000 miles by playing six hours by car preached six services all in the last 10 days and I'm tired can I be honest with you today Amen bodies a little bit physically worn out I thought he might old brother Terry said I think that was the hardest physically that I've ever had to preach this was a struggle physically and he said well I don't think anybody noticed it brother I said well good amen that's what happens when the Spirit of the Lord takes over Amen that's what we always want Amen we always find that when we come to the end of our own strength that's when his strength takes over so we're so glad to be here as we said last night the Lord really just did something really special there I see one of the brothers Amen that was here at the camp so good to see you again brother and we had such a wonderful time amen it was something so special the Lord did just there at those meetings I told her and brother I said it was amazing it's like I've never had anything happened like that in all my years of ministering I walked on to the camp from the very first day we registered and that they showed me gave me the key to my room and I walked in my room and and I can't even hardly know how to explain it but from the moment I walked in there or I could even hardly get my luggage put on the floor the Holy Spirit of the anointing came in that room and I dropped my luggage and fell to my knees before I could do anything and the Lord just begin to move and God met me in that room three days in a row just like that and I said it was so hard to explain that knowing that I felt felt the same as if I had just finished preaching an anointed service and was about to pray for people yet I hadn't preached anything yet but God was so dealing with my heart I think anybody could have preached and the Lord would have done something God really really just moved in such a special special way I tell you what Lord's doing something right now amen 66 people I know the number was 68 at first but that was asked brother Ron how many was it I know it was a lot and and it was amazing even at the baptismal as the the people that came to be baptized in him one disc came and another came and another came and there were ministers coming and counselors adults not just God moving on the young people but God moving on the hearts of his family the Spirit of God is moving it's moving in all the earth Lord moving me how many want to pray that today the Spirit of the Lord is moving move Olga didn't me and that don't pass me by and then praise the Lord well it's so good to be here again as we said we always enjoy coming amen and just enjoy the presence of the Lord if you have your Bible return to the book of Judges we'll just turn over there this morning and we just like to go a little bit different direction today amen thank you better Louie we like to go just a little bit different direction today and I've only ministered this ever just one time and the Lord just began to deal with my heart and and recently and just started stirring this up in me again and I just knew the Lord was dealing with me and just over the past few days even here just in my prayer closet the Lord just bringing this up again in my life and I'd like to speak to you this morning on called out of judges and in Ruth called out of judges and into Ruth a man let's read it verse one of judges chapter 1 it says now after the death of Joshua came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord saying who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them and the Lord said Judah shall go up behold I have delivered the land in his hand Judah Cain said unto Semmy and his brother come up with me into my lot we may fight against the Canaanites and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot so Simeon went with him let's turn to chapter 2 and the Bible says here I'm sorry stay in chapter 1 let's go to verse 21 first the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day the house of Joseph they also went up against Bethel and the Lord was with them verse 27 neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth she Ann and her towns nor Tanic and her towns nor the inhabitants of door in her towns nor the inhabitants of Eve liam and her towns nor the inhabitants of Magda go and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in that land verse 29 neither did ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwell on gazer but the Canaanites dwell in gazer among them neither did Zebulon drive out the inhabitants of katrana or the inhabitants of may hell all but the Canaanites dwell among them verse 31 needed it Asher drive out the inhabitants of aiko nor the inhabitants of Zion nor the nor of a Balaam nor of Aksum no you say brother Matt why are all these towns so important we get the point they didn't have victory but you see judges was going to record these were individual people an individual potential for victory or defeat and God was going to record the areas in their life that they could never get victory and he says this brother had victory here but he could never get victory here he had victory I wonder if my life could be read that way had victory here but never over a temper never over this in his life he had victory here but God gave him a great victory here but then there was a great defeat here oh boy how closely related are we to these scriptures that's why I love this Bible and it says here in verse let's look here in verse 33 neither to Neptune I drive out the inhabitants of beth-shemesh nor the inhabitants of Bethan F verse 30 verse 1 of chapter 2 and an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochum and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and have brought you into the land which I swore in to your fathers and I said I will never break my covenant with you and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw it on their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this let's just bow our heads here just for a moment Lord Jesus father we so trust in you this morning Lord we're looking to your hand father to your voice Lord I pray that we would hear that voice today father may it just be that still small voice that really changes us father into that realm past our emotions Lord past what we feel past what we see or what we hear Lord we're looking to that unseen to move into that soul realm today Lord we pray father that you would just move amongst us again as we seen you moved last night Lord I pray that you would to speak to your children we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated I want you to pause your spot there in judges chapter two and I'm just going to I'm gonna go very slow and teach Amen this morning I'm actually a lot of people don't know that but back at home I teach an adult Sunday School I've done that for many years with just the adults there at our church and this is this the the channel that the Lord has brought me in this morning and I just want to go slow through this I want you to turn to Judges chapter 17 and I want you to read this one verse in judges 17 verse 6 this is gonna be the refrain that you hear throughout this entire book of Judges and there's a constant message in this book and it says here in judges chapter 6 17 and verse 6 it says in those days there was no king in Israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes this is the key to the entire book that you read here in judges and it has this constant message all the way from beginning to end as you study this book and I'm sure that many of you have studied this book and studied certain highlights of judges you know the story if you went to Sunday school as a child I'm sure you've heard the story of Samson and Delilah and we hear the story of Gideon you may know that story today the story of Gideon and how the Lord Shrunk his army and God did a great thing in Gideon's life and he had mighty victory over the Midianites you may have heard the story of of Deborah or a barrack or some of these highlights but I want today just to open the entire book and what the significance of this book was and what you'll find throughout the entire book of Judges is that there's this constant message that you hear throughout this entire stall of the stories that you read you'll hear this message there was no king there was no king and the people did write did that which was right not in God's eyes but in his own eyes I believe this is a very fulfillment of the day and age that you and I live in to where people have no king they have no absolute they have no authority and they became their own moral authority of their own moral interpreter to life and we see the mess that the world is in today from people who has literally exalted the thought of man to a place to where man is God and man chooses what's right and wrong judges was very similar to the age that you and I live in that they had rejected this this time period in this in this in this and this age here that they were in they had rejected the Lord and you'll see this constant cycle that that there was no king and and everyone did that which was right in his own eyes it's amazing because when you read the entire chapter the entire book of Judges you'll find that Israel the Bible says was in Egypt for many years the Bible says they were slaves in Egypt until the iniquity of the amorite was full and when the the cup of the amorite was full and overflowing God waits for that time period you see God has a season for everything he's not aimlessly just picking timeline and picking when this will happen and you know wins that wins the body change gonna happen when's the rapture of the church gonna happen when am I gonna send the seventh angel messenger know all of these things were ordered very ordered from the Lord and they all had a perfect time in a perfect place and at the right moment God sent a message and at the right moment and the right condition God sent a messenger and we find even here in judges the Bible says when the iniquity of the amorite s' was full this in other words God was saying that this land of Canaan was such a corrupt land it was such a corrupt people it was it was such a corrupt filthy society that God waited for that iniquity to get to such a place and when it reached the brink or the height of its corruption God sends a deliverer and delivers God's people out of Egypt and Israel was chosen to be God's punishment for sin the Bible says that Israel was going to begin to afflict the Philistines and afflict the amorite and afflict the Canaanites so the very purpose of why God delivered them out of Egypt was to dispossessed the Canaanites from the land of Canaan and to take the land back now very sadly as we know the story as they come out from Egypt as we spoke on last night they come out of Egypt and God delivers them with a mighty hand and they go through the Red Sea and we know all of the journey that they that they went through when you read the scripture and you follow that story all the way through the wilderness and yeah you have many events that happen in that place but now they come to the very purpose of why God had led them out they come to the very fulfillment or the very reason that you're going to deliver the land from its oppressors you're going to take possession back what God had promised your father's you're gonna you're gonna have full complete victory you're gonna dis possess the inhabitants of the land I want you to look here in numbers chapter 33 very familiar Scripture but I want you to turn there in your Bible if you have it Numbers chapter 33 and we'll just pause there and judges just here for just a moment God brings them all the way through Egypt and all the way out of Egypt and through the wilderness and now God is going to give them instructions through a prophet and the Bible says here in numbers 33 that the author is gonna start to list in chronological order all of the places where they camped and they come all the way down if you read every single verse you come all the way down to the very last encampment and it says in verse 49 they pitched by Jordan from Beth Jesu moth even unto Abel shittim and the plains of Moab the Lord spake unto Moses and the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho now notice the Lord is going to change something there's gonna be a dispensational change there's going to be something about to instruct them and he's gonna say up until this point I've been leading you up until this point I fought your battles up until this point I delivered you from your oppressors I've sent a Holy Spirit I've sent an anointing a pillar of cloud a fire by night and a cloud by day enough I've led you all the way to this point I've opened the Red Sea I've rained manna and quail for your food and for your bread and I've brought you all the way out of the world I've sanctified you I filled you with my spirit I've gave in you my very own life I gave you not just the gift of the Holy Ghost but I gave you the Holy Ghost himself as what God is saying to us today but now it's gonna come to a place in your life where you're gonna have to put action to your faith the Bible says here and notice what he says to Moses in verse 51 speaking to the children of Israel and say unto them when you are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan then you shall drive out some of the inhabitants of the land so we try that again then you shall drive out all the inhabitants that you don't really care for particularly like then you shall drive out just you know the ones that really don't bother you you know and the ones that really don't mean anything to you no the scripture says this is how you're gonna have victory in Canaan you're to drive out all a ll all of the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite plucked down all their high places what was God commissioning these Israelites to he was saying I want you to go in and I want you to completely annihilate completely annihilate this race of people and I want you to go further than just destroying them I want you to destroy all their images I want you to destroy all their pictures I don't want your children to ever know that there was a people who existed in this land before you did and God was saying I don't want there to be a trace I don't want there to be a hint I don't want there to be a smell because I want you to have such victory because this is your land and the devil doesn't belong in your land the devil doesn't have any place in your mind he doesn't have any place in your spirit he doesn't have any place in your mouth he doesn't have any place in your ears he doesn't have any place so that's why the Bible says give no place to the devil resist the devil and he shall flee from you you say how much of God how much of the of God is supposed to possess me 100 percent of your body your mind and your spirit is to be possessed by the Holy Ghost I notice what God says here he says I want you to destroy all of them and he says and you shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell there in for I now here's the promise for I have given you the land to possess it here's a promise I have given you the land to possess it then that's all I need God is a promise that's not all you need you got to put action to that promise because that promise is going to be very conditional in their life notice what God says you shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it so let's close our Bible let's in the service right there that's all we need just to promise amen praise God God says that ain't all verse 55 but boy that's a big word what do you mean but not hold on a minute I thought you just promised it to me but here's the condition if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell God was promising this and you'll find this promise played out so true in the book of Judges he was promising them I'm gonna give you victory you're gonna fight for every inch of ground that I'm gonna give you you're gonna have to fight for it not only are you gonna have to fight for every inch of ground you're gonna have to fight just to maintain the ground I'm gonna give you you know sometimes real victory is not gaining new ground it's holding the ground that God's already given you and not backing up from the faith God put inside your heart and God says you're gonna fight for every inch of it you're gonna hold your ground and you're gonna have complete conquest of this land but if you decide not to obey the voice of the Lord then I want you to notice what happens in this book of Judges he says here it shall come to pass they'll be thorns and they'll be pricks in your eyes and so God commands all of these words he commands them to these Jews and says go in and have victory what potential or what a wave of revival that Israel was riding on just coming through the land and now they're at the climax now they're at the point of possession now their God is with filmin and God's already given a promise and he's given I'm a prophet and he's giving them the word but as we just read in judges it happened so differently than what you might would have expected the Bible comes to Judges chapter 2 after all of this in complete victory and I want you to notice what happens here the Bible says as we ended reading on verse 2 why have you done this judges chapter 2 verse 3 says wherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and there God shall be a snare unto you and it came to pass when the angel of the Lord spoke these words unto all the children of Israel that the people lifted up their voice in wept they called the name of that place Volcom and they sacrificed there unto the Lord and notice what it says here in verse 7 and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel the first generation never has a problem they always can live to the victory or the level of the previous generation they have no trouble living that far but but now watch what happens when Joshua dies and not only Joshua even after Joshua dies the Bible says that they even after Joshua goes off the scene the elders are there and they live a good lives they live righteous lives under the elders of the message but now when that generation starts to die off notice what happens here in this pattern of judges the Bible says they bury him verse 10 and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord what a sad verse nor yet the works which he had done for Israel and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served Balaam they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods lowercase God's not God but gods you say brother Matt what happens when a person leaves the truth they don't always get sinful they sometimes get more spiritual or let me rephrase that they get more religious but they're not serving capital g.od they're serving lowercase G OD they're serving the gods of the people idolatry they're serving the gods of the people that were supposed to be driven out but now God says because you didn't drive them out now they're gonna be there for your children to see and for your children to worship and the Bible says that exactly what God says they become thorns in their eyes and pricks and their sides because why because they had to watch as the children who they raised in the message and told them the ways in the words of the Prophet the people who sat in church and went to church their entire life they watched an entire generation of message young people completely leave the Lord and it was a prick in their eye I can imagine it would be and the Bible says that they that noticed this they forsook verse 12 the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the Lord to anger and they forsook the Lord and served bail and Ashtaroth and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he delivered them into the hands of their spoils that spoiled them he sold them into the hands of their enemies roundabout so that they could no longer stand before their enemies wheresoever whithersoever they went out the hand of the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord had said and as the Lord had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed nevertheless notice this nevertheless the Lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hands of those that spoiled them yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bow themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the Lord but they did not so and when the Lord raised them up judges then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vex them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way now what you'll notice is there's a pattern as we said it we don't have time to cover this entire book of Judges nor the Book of Ruth but we want just to bring out something to you today and you'll notice that there's this pattern all the way through this book of Judges there's this cycle and God has a message through this book of Judges and through this book of Ruth I want to read you what the prophet of God says in the kinsman redeemer he says now many people look at this book of Ruth as they say it's a love story of the Bible the Bible is a love story the whole Bible the whole Bible is a love story not only is it a love story it's a prophet not only is the Bible a prophet you say the Bible a prophet it's a prophet it prophesies and he says it's not just a love story it's a prophet it's not only a prophet it's also a history not only is it a love story a history and a prophet it's God Himself because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so the word is God own print that oughta settle it brother God own print Jehovah printed on a book hallelujah oh this quote will get me excited he says it's God Jehovah printed on a book and none of it just comes some kind of a fiction tale don't ever don't let anybody ever tell you this is fables and stories and tales this is Jehovah printed on a book let me tell you what this is this is the voice of God to you my brother and my sister it's the Word of God brother Branham says there's none of it just a fiction or a tale it's absolutely the truth every single phase of it hang your soul it's there it's the truth and God will back up his own word this story speaking of that story of Ruth was written and all the old manuscripts when they were segregating the Bible the holy men when they were trying to put it together the Old Testament this book of Ruth was one of the most outstanding he said it was one of the outstanding books that they accepted why if it's just a love story why would the writers ancient sages accept this Book of Ruth is what he's speaking of as inspired because there's a hidden revelation in it and in this revelation you catch the real meaning it'll bring you real close to God he says in this Book of Ruth there's a real hidden revelation and it's more than just a love story it's a prophet it's more than just a prophet this book is more than just a prophet it's a history book oh that's what I love so much about when you study the Word of God this Bible is more than just prophecies and more than just divine sayings but it's actually unique in that it's mostly history and profit at future you ever study the Quran or you study any of the other books or look at some of their sayings the Quran is just filled with spiritual sayings and spiritual things it doesn't tell much history because it doesn't have a place in history it doesn't have a place in the mind of God but the Bible doesn't just prophecy but it also records history but it records a very special type of history it records history when there was no historian to write it down on a piece of paper do you realize the Bible tells us the history of the beginning of the earth and how the earth was formed yet there was no writer or historian to take a pen and write it down yet the Bible gives us the history of the beginning of the earth you go read the book of Revelation it'll give you the history of the end of the earth yet there's no historian to tell you how to ride it or to watch it all happen why is it because it's a book of prophecy it's a love story and there's a revelation inside of it and I say God give me that revelation that'll bring me real close to God give me that revelation Lord more than just the letter give me the word today brother madam says it's more than just a history it's more than just a love story hang your soul and I'm going to say today Lord I'm hanging my soul on this book and I want you to notice what this history of judges records the history of judges records this cycle of judges notice what we just read here in judges chapter 2 it says nevertheless the Lord raised up judges this is what happens as you see this constant refrain all the way through this book of judges you're gonna hear this message there's no king and you're gonna notice that there's this pattern through the entire book of judges you're gonna notice that there's this cycle this roundabout in the book of Judges and it just keeps repeating itself you have oppressor and then you have deliverer then you have oppressor then you have deliverer I want you to notice brothers if you can pull that PowerPoint up on the screen I need you to this to be quick today but I even titled this part of this section of judges and Ruth the circle and the line the circle and the line I want you to notice this circle of this pattern that we see here you notice this list of oppressors I go to the next slide brother you would have the king of Jericho that would raise up and would oppress the Israelites and so God raises up Oh Theo this straight judge and we don't have time to get into their life today but we just want to highlight just some of a few of them here today as you study this book of Judges he would raise up a king of Jericho and there would be a judge named öthey el and then he would raise up the king of Moab and then God would raise up even another judge and these judges would begin to deliver Israel from the oppressor then the ammonites would come in and they would oppress Israel so God would raise up a Shamgar and we know the story of Shamgar a man who was sick and tired of being ran over his entire life so he picked up a little off school just a little bit of faith and said I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I'm so disgusted of my my own condition in my own life I'm gonna choose to do something about it and I'm gonna put faith in God and the Bible says that Shamgar had a great victory in his own life and for his own family but what were these men they were judges the Amalekites would come in and then God would raise up Deborah and then he would raise up through Deborah barrack and you know the story of Deborah and barrack and how they went in jointly and together to battle what were these men the Bible calls them judges but I don't want you to think of judges like a court judge but actually more properly that word could be Savior now not the Savior there's only one Savior just like there's no healer amongst this there's only one healer but God brother Branham says uses the agency of man and through faith in that gift or that vessel God can heal you through the preaching of the word God can heal you you notice how important is to believe the vessel whom God had sent that's why the angel of the Lord tells brother if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand in your way not even cancer what was it it wasn't that brother branham was God it wasn't that brother branham was a healer it wasn't that brother Branham wasn't absolute but he was a representative of the mercy in the grace of God through divine healing and if you could believe on the vessel whom God had sent oh this is for free here today if you could believe on the man God sent to your life you can receive deliveries that's why it's so important for you to have confidence in your pastor that he's more than just a man getting behind a desk and revealing thoughts and ideas and concepts to you but it's God using the agency of a man to deliver you out of your situation to deliver you out of your oppressors thank you lord notice these Philistines would come he'd raise up a savior he'd raised up a judge he'd raised up they were saviors of the situation he'd raise up listings we all know the story of Gideon and how Gideon has an army and we all we know the entire story even afterwards they try to they try to raise up Gideon even after all the victory that Gideon has the people look to Gideon and say a wool will crown you King and then your son will reign in your stead and Gideon says Oh DUP a minute he already have a king his name is Jehovah you just got to obey your king you see that Judge was sent to turn their hearts back to God king of haze or we find in judges would raise up and there was a mighty story of Toula Midianites would come in and you had the jet the judge or the savior chair then you had the Amalekites and God would raise up jephta and then the Philistines would come again and and through this entire history of 52 years there was going to be oppressors and oppressors and then got a raise up a judge and he to deliver those people then the Ipsen came and the ammonites came and then God rose up Elon the ammonites come again later and God raises up another judge named abdun then we find the story of the Philistines and God raises up Samson Samson was not about a strong man it was actually about a very weak man Samson was not a great big muscle-bound man with you know the mister atlas or some kind of great bodybuilder that's brother madam said even that wasn't Samson if Samson was some big you know muscle-bound guy why would Delilah look at him and say wherein does your great strength lie because within him he looked like nothing but it was the anointing of God on his life you see Samson was not the story of how strong the human is it was how weak a human is apart from the anointing of God and God would raise up this pattern of judges he would raise up oppressors but notice what judges I don't want you I want you to leave that there brother if you have a Bible use it today judges chapter to notice the Lord raised up judges verse 16 of judges - which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them yet they would not hearken under their judges 'but went whoring after other gods bowed themselves to them notice what brother Branham says here just hold your place there in verse 17 brother Branham says in the Ephesian Church age the next slide now history keeps repeating itself this is the pattern or the cycle that you find in judges it's a constant repetitive circle history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated notice these words history keeps repeating the same process is repeated the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God its cooled off and became a bit formal that's what was happening back there to the Ephesians that second generation coming on was just like Israel now he goes and points back at this pattern again this great cycle this process this is what you find when you read the story of Judges you find a deliverer an oppressor God delivers then they sin then they repent then God delivers then they sin then they repent then God sends a deliverer and you find this constant cycle repeating over and over and over listen what brother Branham says about the cycle he says when they the second generation was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that is the history of the church it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they change their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get lacs that's what Ephesus means relaxed and drifting and then he says that cycle of revival and death has never failed because this is a pattern of judges the pattern of the judges in your own life and people's lives are so much like judges - where are we going cycles and in patterns and revivals and we go from one revival to the next revival brother Branham says history just continues to repeat itself on the generation of Israel we see fire in one generation then the second the fire phase then the third it goes down then the fourth there's no vestige of that original flame then that revival Dyess than god likes the fire again and that cycle just keeps repeating that cycle just keeps repeating judges is about cycles it's about a circle but I'm going to tell you about another book named The Book of Ruth and the Book of Ruth doesn't have any cycles it doesn't have a circle it's actually a line a straight linear path and God says I want you to come out of judges get off of the pattern of revival and then death get order get off of the cycle of up and down and step into a little land named Bethlehem where there's a girl named Ruth and God says there's going to be a difference between judges and Ruth judges is going to be a circle but Ruth is going to be a royal line and brother Branham says this is that cycle that circle and and and what you find is is that people's lives are so much the same you notice what happens to Israel they begin to get revival fires burning only to see the generation fade in the next and he says and that psycho just repeats itself they get away from God they go on that roundabout of life that circle of life you know what that roundabout is is that that roundabout circle that circle of judges where you know you get you going to life and you step on the roundabout in life and then you grow up and you get a job and you get a good career you marry a girl or you marry a boy if you're a girl and and and you you you have a family and you have a home and then you get a job and you get in that rut that circle you go to church on Sunday go to work on Monday and then you just go after work you come home and you veg on entertainment you go to bed you wake up the next day and you go back to your same job you go back to church on Sunday back to the career on Monday and on Tuesday on on Wednesday and you're going in that circle you go home you say hello to the family you watch a entertainment you feed yourself from all the things in life you deal with all the problems you wake up you do it all over again the next then on Wednesday you go to church then you go on Thursday back to work and you're on that cycle over and over again and you work a job and you work a career and then after 40 years or so you retire and then you step off the roundabout about the spot where you stepped on and you go through that circle over and over and so many people are on this pattern of a circle with no purpose in their life no purpose never identified the plan of God for their life they just live in a life they go to church they go to work they go to church they go to work they raise kids and they go through that entire round about you know the point have you ever been in the traffic circle around about you know what those are here in Tennessee we got a lot of them back home you know the purpose of that roundabout is not to stay on the roundabout and if you do you get the horn honked at you and people wonder if you're from there the purpose of the roundabout is to get off of the roundabout and get back on the line that God has for your life I've got a very simple message for you this morning get off the roundabout of judges and coming to the Book of Ruth where there's a purpose and a pattern for your life get off of the circle of life of just going through life and going through the motions and say god I don't want to go in a rut and in a pattern oh is there somebody here today they could say God take me off of the roundabout of life let me step out of judges and let me step into Ruth let me step into the pattern and the life that God has for me hallelujah come out of judges and come into Ruth you see Ruth was the answer to judges Ruth was the answer to this cycle of revival and death as you study this pattern over and over and over again you'll find that every time the people got close to God God sent a deliverer notice what happens here as we go through this God would send delivers but God gives them this this law of blessing and cursing and he says then it shall come to pass this is Deuteronomy chapter 28 it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day if the LORD thy God will set the own a high above and I set the own high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God verse 15 but it shall come to pass if thou will not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God to observe to do all his Commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee you see living for God is very simple you're either living under blessing or you're living under curse this is the pattern you see in Israel as long as they were close to God blessings came but the minute they got away from God and got away from His Prophet and got away from his teaching and away from his Commandments as soon as obedience leaves your life cursings follow says that that simple brother mat it is that simple you either live under blessing or you live under curse and when you disobey the Lord when you're disobedient in your life cursings come in so much that the Bible says they overtake you and sorrow comes upon sorrow and pain comes upon pain and hurt comes upon her and damage comes and leads to more damage this is what we see in Israel you see the problem with this cycle this circle this roundabout is you're not just going on a circle literally like this but it's a spiraling circle where you go lower and you go lower and you go lower and you go lower and you go lower and you go lower it's a cycle that leads you down further and further and further and further you even watch Jonah in his life when he rebelled against God the Bible says he went down to Nineveh he went down to the boat he went down into the bottom of the boat then he went down into the belly of the well he went lower and lower and lower and lower and this is the cycle of God in your life or the cycle of death the recycle the cycle of a circle or a line in your life that roundabout will take you lower and lower and lower that cycle will go lower and lower and lower where you have no purpose you're just aimlessly something very dangerous and wondering in life whether Branham says what happens after a while a spiritual amnesia sets in you go around and around and around and around and around you know what happens after a while when you go around and around and around do it sometime you get dizzy you lose your way spiritually you lose your way you lose your direction you don't know left you don't know right you don't know forwards you don't know backwards and you're trying to raise kids and your kids need the Holy Ghost and you're fighting devils and your marriage is in trouble and you're going around and around and around and around and around and everyone in your life needs direction but you're spinning in a circle and you go around and around and around but when you're on the line God has a purpose in your life your life has a purpose your job has a purpose your career has a purpose your church has a purpose you have a purpose in life everything just clicks and make sense you're living for a purpose you're serving God for a purpose you're raising a family for a purpose for a line for a plan but just as in the book of Judges the people gets away from the law of Moses away from the Levitical order and now their life goes from a line to a circle and anytime you get away from God your life turns into a circle it's a circle or line never would have thought we would've been back to elementary school would we back to shapes but this is how true this pattern this principle is in your life do you study judges it was a constant circle over and over and over again it's a circle the people get away from the law and then their life becomes a cycle I want you to look at this next slide brother if you can just go to to a few slides down in fact go all the way down to the very last one notice this pattern that you see in judges and here's this constant refrain in those days there was no king in Israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes when you walk by your own eyes this is how you walk you may think you have direction you may think you're planning your life you may think everything's working you got a plan you got a career raising kids getting more money bigger job bigger bank account bigger house but if you ever pull back and you look from the sky view your life is just a big circle and then they allow compromise you notice this pattern of sin notice that circle I have there this was the cycle this cycle in the book of Judges repeats seven times God's number of completion God's number of perfection both for evil and for good seven times the cycle repeats the people with sin they would go into slavery to that sin because that's what sin brings it brings bondage and it makes you a slave it doesn't as we preached last night it doesn't give anything back it just takes away and this cycle and judges as they would sin there would be sedition that would be either would be adjusted to our total backsliding and turning away from God and then that cycle would lead them from sin it would lead them to slavery and then from slavery they would lead to repentance and they would begin to cry out and call out to God say God deliver me God kill me God save me deliver me from this problem deliver me from these chains again then God would send a judge you'd send a deliverer it send a Savior and God would set him free and then they'd go right back notice what the Bible says here it says it came to pass in verse nineteen when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers so how long would they stay in that revival as long as the judge lived but as soon as the judge died they'd go right back to sin the only problem is this time it was worse and if you're not careful when you live in the pattern of judges you'll get freed from addictions and freed from problems and freed from issues you'll come to this altar you'll get excited in a meeting that God will come down and deliver you and if you're not careful you'll go right back to that sin and Jesus says when an unclean spirit is going out of a man he leaves and he finds the house notice the house is clean and sweat it says when the unclean spirit it's going out of a man he says it goeth to Dry places seeking rest because that spirits gotta have a house to live in and he says but when it findeth none it cometh back to the house that he was delivered from and Jesus says and he finds it swept and garnished and clean you know one of the most dangerous spots you can be in as a Christian it's clean but not filled one of the most deadly spots we see it in people's lives so many times brother branham said they live in varying degrees of sanctification they live in this pattern of judges where they're clean but then they go right back and brother Jesus says when he comes he finds the house swept clean and garnished but it's empty and he says then it goes and gets seven more spirits worse than the first and Jesus says the condition of that man is worse than before the spirit had left time you would be better dirty than clean but empty so that's a bold statement well I got the words of Jesus to back it up he says the condition of that man is worse than when he first started and we get to a place if we're not careful we live under such the pattern of judges that God cleans us god saves us but we go right back to the sin and you watch a person's life if they go back after sin after revival after a deliverance after a move of God that neck sin is always worse than the first and that bondage it's greater and it gets greater and it gets stronger and it gets stronger and it gets stronger and then it leads them to slavery and then you find them as they come back and they begin to weep and they come back to repentance but if you're not careful if you stay in the pattern of judges and you never make it out of judges into Ruth you go through that cycle for year after year after year after year compromise they allowed men to stay in the valley they got victory on the mountain but they never got victory in the valley that's what judges to records judges one it says that they got victory over all of the over the Canaanites and the mountains but they could never get victory in the valley and what was and it was compromised on the Word of God God said drive them all out all of them out of your life those allowances led to alliances because they never drove out all the enemies they said hey since you're gonna live here anyways let's just be allies you know the problem with that it was okay for the parents but guess whose eyes those young men started seeing started seeing non-israelite girls and the Bible says they allowed mixed marriages and God was so clear are you with me here today I don't want to go here by myself I want you to come with me God was so clear on mixed marriages he was so clear you're to marry a Jew is to marry a Jew and Israelite marries an Israelite because what happens when an Israelite marries a Canaanite tell you what happens it never works never works let me tell you something young people ought to stop here just for a moment be careful who you give your heart to be careful who you give your emotions to and you say gods leading me to date that girl from school just to go to church know this she believed the message no she's a good Baptist girl she loves the Lord she's got a real heart for God be careful we've gotten to such a place in our own ranks and the message to where we were sort of compromising to what we used to preach and what we used to believe these are the men are they good people I'm sure they're good people and very rare cases I've seen it seen God do something Mira miracle very special and God brought that person to the truth but very rarely you say brother Matt does that mean that we just you know everybody's let me tell you something young people some of the worst girls and some of the worst boys girls are sitting right in your church don't think just because they go to this church so they claim the message or believe the Prophet you better be led of the Spirit of God you better say do they have the same passion and zeal that I have for the Lord and the truth and His Word does my heart match their heart [Applause] they'll lead you astray booyah they compromise them when compromise comes conduct changes the conduct leads to sin slavery then repentance then salvation then back to sin and back to repentance then back to slavery back to repentance back to salvation and it brings corruption to the children of Israel it leads them and binds them in idolatry and immorality and we noticed this pattern just repeats over and over and over seven times and judges we see this pattern repeat the cycle of revival and death this getting away from God and living under the cursing of God but do you not want to know how to live under the blessing you see cursing or blessing is not a choice it's not you know like in school you have your you have your your required assignments then you have your extracurricular stuff you can just choose sort of an option if you want to do it or not well blessing or cursing don't work that way it's a required assignment you're either gonna live under the blessing of God or you're gonna live under the curse of God you say what would determinate your obedience to God or your disobedience to God as long as they live disobedient cursings followed their life but let me tell you something brother if they lived obediently blessings was a automatic blessings came automatically from God in fact the blessings were so great God said if you'll live close to my word and be obedient I'm not just gonna pour out blessings but those blessings are going to become so strong in your life they overtake you you say what are they overtake they overtake your issues they overtake your problems they overtake your burdens they overtake your family they overtake your children oh they overtake your church and God says I'll bless you abundantly I'll pour out a blessing it'll be so big you can't even contain it I want that kind of a blessing here today I say God's that my life live so close to you that I live under the blessing of God it's going to be a circle or a line it depends on if your life is in touch with the Lord in Israel's life their pattern unfortunately so sadly as you follow this book and you go all the way through the history of this book you'll find this pattern we come to the very end of Judges the very last part of Judges and it's a very sad story in fact I can't even repeat some of the stories here in judges if you've ever studied them and studied the entire book and the mixed audience some of the things you read about are so bad and they're so vile and so filthy you almost can't even believe it's in the Bible you can't believe these are stories that you read out of they'll tell you what your open your Bible sometime read something you've never read before you go look at the last parts of judges this book the Bible tells us of this historical time where you have both the northern tribe and the southern tribe you have Dan in the north and you have Benjamin in Souths and what you find at the very last story of judges after this pattern of savior deliverer then back to sin than to slavery then to repentance then Savior then back to sin then back to slavery then back to repentance then Savior and God leads them through this pattern over and over history keeps repeating itself but we come to the very end of this book and the Bible tells a story of both the northern tribe of Dan and the Benjamin tribe of the south and the Bible says what you have is two Levites both one in the north and one in the south and it's actually a Levite that leads both of them into calamity preachers are sometimes God's biggest trouble a man where he gets off on the will of God or the anointed of God for his life a leader can lead can do more damage a leader can do more damage and and I'm not just talking about a leader as a pastor because pastors are leaders preachers are leaders but let me tell you something fathers your leaders too and a man doing what's right in his own eyes and he's led astray can do more damage and it can wreck that family and that wife and those children worse than the devil ever could and we find even in the north there's a man named Micah I'll just tell you these stories and maybe you've never heard them before but you find in the story the story of this man named Micah and the Bible says that Micah steals 1,100 pieces of silver from his mother this is the LAT one of the last stories and this northern tribe and the Bible says that this man Micah takes these 1,100 pieces of silver he takes them for himself and now his mother he starts to get very fearful because now his mother begins to say curse it as the man who stole she starts to pray cursings upon his life and the scripture records that this man gets so fearful Micah comes back and says here and he gives the silver back to his mother and his mother looks at him you've done a good job son I'm glad that you brought them back you've been a good boy and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take that silver and I'm gonna make you a little silver God and I'm gonna give him to you and I'm gonna give you and the mother actually creates and she begins to take the silver and melt it and she creates an idol for her son sometimes it's parents who shove idols down the faces of their kids sometimes mothers and fathers are trying to live out the dream or childhood they never had in their life through their children's life they shove them into sports when they don't want to play sports they shove them into school when they'd want to stay homeschooled they shove them into career when they just wanted to be a carpenter or a framer or a plumber thank God for plumbers and they can live their life or their childhood they give their children a silver god and this mother gives Micah this God and now you notice what mother says I'll give you this silver God and I'm gonna give it to you and you could put in your collection of God's because her son was already collecting little idols Micah already had a chest full a trunk full of closet full of idols idolatry leads to more idolatry and she says I'm gonna give you and you can add it to your little collection of idols what a mom and Micah now grows up and Micah has a son and Micah makes his son a priest and Micah looks at his son now as priests once a son was not a Levite but this is how backslidden Israel is at this point makes him a preacher when he's not called to be a preacher makes him a leader when he's not called to be a leader some men are called to lead others are called to follow God is called both and ones not greater than the other but you better find your position and if you're a leader you better be a leader and not a follower and if you're a follower you better be a follower and don't try to be a leader find your position on how God has made you where God has called you get off of the circle get on the line because God has a plan for every single individual's life God has a purpose and a calling that's why the Bible says make your calling and your election sure and she says I'm gonna make you a priest and she take he take Mike it takes his son and makes him a priest even though the little boy wasn't a Levite but now here what you have in Micah's house is now there's a real Levite running retreating from the southern tribes he's here a scandal a great bad situation in Bethlehem Judy of all places and the southern Levite this priest is running for his life and he runs into Mike as he runs to the northern tribes and he goes into Micah's house and now this priest this Levite running to the North lodges in the house of Micah where his son is a false priest and now this Levi starts to see the silver gods and the idols and then Micah's house and he sees this priest over him and now Micah offers him a position now he's a real Levite he's really caught of God and Micah says I'm gonna offer you something if you'll stay here in my house and be my private preacher my private priest my private pastor I'll pay you a salary and you can be the priest over all these idols and do you want to know what a backslidden heart of a leader does it becomes a hireling for money and it takes a gift that God really put in his life and he sir comes to the pressure and the Bible says that this real Levite priest this is the end of judges this real Levite priest becomes a priest over the house of these idols and these gods he takes the salary and becomes a private priest for this one single family and now what's going to happen through this as Micah says my son wasn't a priest but now I've got a real priest I've got a real Levite I've got a real man of God but he didn't have a real man of God he had a backslidden heart a lukewarm heart of a leader who used his gift a real gift that God placed in his life for the wrong purpose but now here comes a little bit of time later take that story and time goes on a little bit later in the tribes of dan dan who failed to take the land and judges that God had given him in the south now Dan migrates north and now Dan lodges in the same house where you had a preacher who wasn't called and now you have a preacher a priest who's serving as a private priest and now Dan comes into this house and he sees all the gods and he sees the private priest and Dan says I've got an idea hey man you're a real Levite are you making just a little bit of money we'll pay even more money than what they're paying you and you could be the priest over an entire tribe not just a single family and guess what that backs let him priest did he said sign me up the Levite accepts it takes the job this Levite who is so backslidden in his heart to where he's preaching over idols known idols known idolatry in this single house but he never says a word against it and now Dan hires him as his Levite and that's why Dan is recorded as one of the most idolatrous tribes in all of Israel because a leader brought in idolatry and it corrupted the entire church with idolatry and just as Judas Iscariot goes missing from the Twelve Apostles Dan goes missing in the Book of Revelations say brother Matt how because one man one bad mom one evil son one evil priest that cycle led worse and worse and worse and worse and down they go and down they go and down they go I'm just on a cycle in a circle you're going further and lower lower lower and Dan is wiped off dennis has taken off he's he goes missing the Bible doesn't even record him in Revelations and notice what happens because of priests because a Levite it's a very sad story and now the other one is even worse that's the north now let's hear about the south now the southern tribe of Judah Benjamin it's another Levite a man from Ephraim a Levite from the tribe of Ephraim takes a you buy from guess where Bethlehem of Judea he takes a concubine and the Bible says through this story of their life that she eventually gets fed up with this man and she leaves him and runs back to her daddy and now the story goes where this Levite from the southern tribe of Benjamin is running to the house of this girl her father and the Bible says that they argue and he's trying to get her back and he argues with the dad and they argue all afternoon and all morning and finally finally he gives in and gives his daughter back to this man but now it's very late in the day and they try to travel out of Bethlehem Judea and the Bible says that they travel through the night but it gets dark and then make it to the town of Jerusalem which at that time was still a pagan City and that Levite says there's no way we can settle down here for the night we've got to go in a little bit further so they move on into the tribe of Benjamin and the Bible says that they make it to Gibeah where the Benjamites are settled when they get there they start to set up a tent this man in his concubine and the Bible says that a man of Gibeah walks out and says hey you're never going to make it out here in that tent you need to come inside and he invites this man this Levite priests from the southern tribe into his home and the story goes that he stays in this home he goes in there in the house and before he can get settled in that home there comes banging at the door and it's a group of homosexuals now I told you you go read this story of judges guarantee you never read some of this almost exactly like what happens in lot in Sodom and these men are banging on the door saying send out the man who came to camps in doubt that Levite out here and that man of Gibeah gets so scared that the Bible records that he takes that he takes that that the his daughter the concubine of this man and says I'm not going to send you this Levite but you can have his concubine and he sends out that concubine and the Bible records that they so brutal to file her that she dies and in the morning when the dawn comes in the daylight breaks there's this concubine laying dead on the ground you imagine the failure of one man what the consequences and the collateral damage when you get away from God and you're living on that cycle say brother Matt that's a horrible story it gets worse judges is gonna keep going down further and further and those men take the body of that concubine and they cut her up into 12 pieces go read your Bible and they send a piece to each of the tribes of Israel say how can that be judges a pattern a circle around about bowing down and down and further and further and further you see when you get away from God there's nothing impossible for you to do you go further in things you would have never thought you could ever partake of places you would go solo you could never imagine you could stoop that low and now that this happens all of Israel unites together and says how could such a horrible thing happen they unite together in the Bible records that they band up and say we're gonna make Benjamin how could Benjamin allow such a thing to happen how could they allow such an atrocity under their watch and all of Israel comes together against Benjamin and for the first time and only time in their history Israel has Civil War you know what happened with this civil war that we had in American history and lives and men died arguing and fighting arguing and fussing and fighting and they get so much away from God so much away from the plan of God so much of the word of that civil war breaks out in Israel and they begin to fight one with another and it gets so bad that the scripture records Benjamin is so defeated and so destroyed and there's so much bloodshed and Slyder the result was the tribe of Benjamin almost like Dan gets wiped off almost completely annihilated you say Israel this was Israel this is the story of the judges every man did that which was right in his own eyes and Benjamin's almost completely wiped off there's only 600 minute ride that had thousands when the war's over there 600 men no women no children go read your Bible they never realized what would happen but Benjamin's almost completely wiped out and then they realized what's happened to us we were twelve tribes now we're 11 and now Benjamin almost gets wiped off you say what happened brother Matt the judges cycle happened and they went further and further and further you say that's a horrible story brother Matt that's how judges ends that's what how your life ends when you get on that circle of judges that's how your life ends up when you get in a circle and you go around and around you say how much longer can a person go from one revival to the next deliverance back to sin back to revival back to deliver its brother you won't stay on that cycle you'll keep going down further and further and further and further and further let me give you the message of God today get off of that circle get off of that circle you say brother Matt that's a horrible story but I'm not just preaching about judges I'm preaching on getting called out of judges and into another book named Ruth you see the most special part about this story of judges and Ruth is that your English Bible separates the two books and in your English Bible it ends with Dan wiped out and Benjamin almost annihilated but go pick up a Hebrew Bible you see in the Hebrew Bible they weren't two books they were all the same book it was the same story what was God saying judges it's not it's not gonna end with judges your life is not gonna end with Benjamin dining and and eying and getting wiped off but I've got a line that answers the circle and Ruth it's gonna be a little girl who's anointed and redeemed of the Lord it's not going to end in calamity my brother and my sister and let me tell the devil today you might have brought us through a circle of cycles of revival and death but God's gonna plan before the foundation of the world and it's not going to end in defeat it's not gonna end with people leaving church and backsliding into sin and addiction it's gonna end in a line a line of redemption oh you ought to rejoice tonight today and say God take me off the circle put me on the line of redemption it's not gonna end with Benjamin it's not gonna end with Dan dying the story is the same it's one book judges and you say what was different about Ruth's brother Matt what was so different you see Ruth had a purpose past present future it wasn't just going to be a circle of repeating it was going to be a past of who she was a present of who God made her and a future of who she was gonna be and if you're an elected member of the family of God my life isn't a circle a pattern of history but my life is who I used to be and now who God has made me but it goes further than that who I'm gonna be I'm gonna be an overcomer I'm gonna be redeemed of the Lord Oh can you say yeah man this morning my life isn't going to end in a circle it's gonna end in a pattern a line a linear litterer why Oh give the Lord a praise this morning hallelujah stand to your feet this morning musicians if you would come we're out of time it's not gonna end in a circle it's gonna end in a straight by your heads with me if you could brothers if you could just play something here this morning whatever the Lord put upon your heart brother Harry it's not gonna end in judges you see judges was a land where everyone did that which was right in his own eyes tells that sad story of human history even today people live with that philosophy if it feels right if it seems right do it must be right you see they had no King in those days and sin leads to slavery and slavery leaves to repentance and dependence leads to deliverance but then back to that same cycle I wonder if every head could be bowed every eye closed just go ahead and play something this is how judges ends it ends with corruption and let me give you the warning of God my brother my sister if you don't get off that cycle and get off that pattern of judges of revival and death revival and Zen back to sin back to repentance back to slavery back to repentance from one meeting to the next from one service to the next and you get in that cycle and we're all susceptible to it as children of God get in that cycle of life to where you just get in a rut maybe you're here today and maybe you feel even identified maybe you're not sinful or backslidden but you feel like lord I've sort of got into that rut of life to where I'm just going through the circles oh just be honest today raise a hand to the Lord say God would you take me off that circle would you put me back on the straight path the straight and narrow would you put me back on that life that has a purpose where church has a meaning preaching has a purpose living for God has a purpose my job has a purpose raising a family has a purpose Oh sister brother you can get so depressed in that in that state of that pattern but God is saying I'm calling you out of judges and I'm wanting to put you in Ruth you know the beauty of Ruth that land of Bethlehem is that from judges to Ruth it was only two miles away only two miles only two miles you say I'm in a pattern I'm in a circle I'm in a ride I'm in that cycle but that line of Ruth is only two miles away my brother that land of Bethlehem was just two miles away that's how close you are to the fire and the revival of God that's how close you are you say I fell on a fallen so far I'm so far away brother Matt you don't know my condition today you're only two miles away my brother and let me tell you something about that land of Bethlehem there's a different atmosphere in that land there's a different anointing in that land the atmosphere feels different the atmosphere the filling in Bethlehem is not a feeling of cycles and torment and struggle and war and and and death and and murder and all of this terror that you read and judges in Judah in Bethlehem there's none of that there's a little girl who's being called to the throne there's a redeemed lady there's a redeemed woman there's a plan of redemption just outside of that circle of judges my brother and my sister is a line of Ruth and I wonder if you'd raise your hand today with every head bowed and every eye closed owned her fathers and mothers and children and teenagers could say to the Lord Lord take me out of that atmosphere of judges and plant me in that atmosphere of Bethlehem plant me Lord in that atmosphere where there's no fear there's joy where there's no hate there's love where there's no stress there's peace oh god it's only just a mile away all we got to do is walk to that land we don't have to stay off that in that cycle we don't have to stay in that roundabout we can today Lord step off of that roundabout you're calling us to Lord we preach last night Lord on the bondage the captive daughter of Zion Lord you're not wanting us to go into captivity again and then back to freedom them back to captivity them back to freedom but you're calling somebody today child step out of that circle step out of that cycle of death it's a winding ever winding road that leads further and further and further and further but today can you hear the voice of the Lord saying come out of judges let me bring your home into a different atmosphere let me bring your home into a different feeling Oh Lord yes oh yes Lord I raise my hands here today Lord with every believer here in this building I say yes Lord call my life out of that cycle call me out of that random wandering call me out of that that one during that circuit is to go around and that dizziness of life call me into de Ruth Lord call me into a different atmosphere call me into a plan a purpose of life or life has a meaning where my life has a has a past it has a present and it has a future and it has a purpose and it has a design and trials have a design and tests have a purpose and heartaches and sorrow has a purpose it has a will it has a plan it's going to accomplish something that trial on that test and that heartache and that sorrow when you're in judges it means nothing but when you're in Ruth it has a point again it has a purpose again it has a meaning again and I can understand in my life I can understand what I go through because I'm in Ruth I'm not in judges in God he's calling me he's calling my children he's calling my home he's calling my family's calling my church out of judges and in truth grant it Lord grant it for every life grant it for every holmgren it for every mother granted for every father grant it for that individual Lord who's praying here today with fervency that heart that's bleeding and crying take me out of judges Lord put me into it take me off the circle put me on the line take

rut take my wife's take my husband take my brother take my sister take my uncle take my aunt take my church take us out of that rut Lord that meaningless portion of life that dullness that dryness
