[6:30] My heart can sing
[6:34] when I pause to remember
[6:38] [Music]
[6:39] a heartache here.
[6:43] It's just a stepping stone
[6:48] along the trail.
[6:52] That's winding always upward.
[6:56] I'm so glad this troubled world
[7:01] is not our final home.
[7:06] But until then, sing it. My heart will
[7:11] go on singing. Hallelujah. Praise the
[7:15] Lord till then
[7:19] with joy I'll carry on. Oh, sing it if

[7:31] [Music]
[7:33] Until the day
[7:36] God calls.
[7:39] I like this second verse right here.
[7:42] These things of earth,
[7:45] they're going to dim and lose their
[7:48] value.
[7:51] If we recall,
[7:54] they're just borrowed
[7:56] for a while.
[8:00] And things of earth
[8:03] that cause our heart to tremble
[8:09] remembered there.
[8:12] They'll only
[8:14] bring a smile.
[8:18] And until then,
[8:21] my heart will go on sing.
[8:27] And until then,
[8:30] with joy,
[8:32] we're going to carry on
[8:36] until the day.
[8:39] Mine eyes behold
[8:42] that city.
[8:45] until the day
[8:48] God calls
[8:51] me home.
[8:55] Amen. Say amen if you believe me with
[8:57] all your heart. Praise the Lord. Give
[9:00] him a good hand. Clap of praise this
[9:01] morning.

[9:06] Amen. What is there to do but just to
[9:09] keep carrying on? Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; If you left here, where would you go?
[9:14] &gt;&gt; If you didn't believe this message, what
[9:16] would you believe?
[9:17] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't believe nothing. That's what
[9:20] I'd believe. I'd believe absolutely
[9:21] nothing if I didn't believe this truth.
[9:23] I'm so glad God has revealed something
[9:25] to us that's steadfast and sure.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; It'll never fail. The word of God will
[9:30] never fail. Do you believe that with all
[9:32] your heart? Give him another good hand
[9:34] clap of praise. Amen.

[10:18] Praise the Lord. Now, look at your
[10:19] neighbor and tell them you're glad to
[10:20] see him in the house of God this
[10:22] morning. Now, some of you ain't glad to
[10:24] see nobody because you ain't said
[10:26] nothing. Look at your neighbor, tell

[11:16] But if you keep moving and keep going,
[11:18] it'll be all right. Amen. That's why I
[11:20] try to work a little bit cuz I know if I

[11:25] too. Don't look at me like I'm the only
[11:26] one. Some of you old people, you're

[11:31] all let's all just keep going.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord one more good hand clap of
[11:35] praise. Amen.
[11:40] Praise the Lord. We're going to look at
[11:42] a prayer request this morning. Brother
[11:43] Jim Hughes from Virginia called in need
[11:45] of prayer for he and his family. Also,
[11:48] he's experiencing severe pain caused by
[11:50] a cyst on one of his hands, recovering
[11:53] from a carpal tunnel surgery on the
[11:55] other. Brother Jim's wife's also dealing
[11:57] with severe pain in her legs and hips.
[11:59] Brother Jim's son Brandon has kidney
[12:01] stones that are causing him pain and
[12:03] discomfort. Also, his daughter-in-law
[12:05] named Angie Gentry is dealing with leg
[12:08] pain from a recent surgery. Your prayers
[12:10] are greatly appreciated. So we want to
[12:12] remember those folks today. Brother
[12:14] Terry Stockton says requesting prayer
[12:16] for a nerve block procedure that I have
[12:19] tomorrow at the VA. Also I have an
[12:21] unspoken prayer request for a family
[12:23] member in Kentucky on for on Monday.
[12:26] Really appreciate my church family,
[12:29] brother Terry Stockton. So we just want
[12:30] to commit that unto the Lord. Brother
[12:32] Gary wants us to remember his daughter
[12:34] Paula in prayer suffering from
[12:36] pancreatitis and a lot of pain. So we
[12:38] want to remember Paula as we pray today.
[12:41] Brother Steve Bright says, "I'm
[12:43] requesting prayer for a kidney stone
[12:45] attack." So, we want to remember him as
[12:47] we pray today. Sister Ruth Louise Jax is
[12:50] requesting prayer for her friend Pamela
[12:52] Cook, her granddaughter Elelliana Marie,
[12:55] and Susan Albbright, and her family. She
[12:58] also has an important unspoken prayer
[13:00] request is asking for traveling mercy.
[13:03] So, let's remember that. Sister Barbara
[13:05] Grley had severe pain in the back of her
[13:07] neck. went to the ER, X-ray, CT scan,
[13:10] asked for prayer from brother Donnie,
[13:12] the saints here at the church, and the
[13:14] pain left. She wants to praise the Lord
[13:16] for that. Please pray for brother David
[13:18] Gadman, precious minister for brother
[13:21] Homer Longorius, who had his part of his
[13:24] colon removed. Uh pray that there would
[13:27] be not be any cancer found. So, we want
[13:28] to remember that prayer request. Brother
[13:30] John Taylor and his wife from New York
[13:32] want to thank everyone for praying for
[13:34] their daughter Emily as she dealt with
[13:36] the loss of her husband with the help of
[13:38] the Lord. She is doing much better and
[13:40] they're greatly encouraged. Also that
[13:42] her their oldest daughter has a very
[13:44] close friend that is dealing with uh
[13:48] breast cancer is not responding to
[13:50] treatment well at all. She also suffers
[13:52] from Crohn's disease and some major
[13:54] thyroid issues which prevents her from
[13:57] working. The doctors have given her a
[13:59] poor prognosis, but they are entrusting
[14:01] the great physician to move on her
[14:03] behalf. Thank you for your prayer. So,
[14:06] we just commit that unto the Lord. Uh
[14:08] Fred Walton, stage 4 cancer, and Britney
[14:11] Walton. We'll remember those folks in
[14:13] prayer. Brother Randy sends that in. And
[14:15] today, according to Sister Jennifer,
[14:19] if you if you could, Brother Steve
[14:21] Newsome could receive visitors today.
[14:23] He's in the Sycamore Scholes Hospital,
[14:27] uh, room 313. So, if you could go by and
[14:30] just say hey to him and let him know
[14:32] you're thinking about him, I'm certain
[14:34] that that family would would appreciate
[14:36] that very much. All the unspoken prayer
[14:38] requests, I know there's great needs
[14:40] among us today. Aren't you glad we're
[14:42] serving a risen savior? Somebody say,
[14:44] "Praise the Lord." Let's sing that last
[14:46] verse of that of that song if you will.

[14:56] with all its toll and struggle
[15:02] may take its toll
[15:06] of misery
[15:08] and stri.
[15:11] The soul of a man,
[15:15] it's like a mighty eagle
[15:20] when it's released.

[32:44] But when I
[32:47] I look around
[32:51] and
[32:54] I think things over
[33:00] all of my
[33:02] good days, you know what they do? They
[33:05] outweigh my
[33:07] bad days.
[33:09] So I
[33:12] I won't complain.
[33:15] You see the Lord,
[33:19] he's been so good to me.
[33:23] Though sometimes through weary eyes, I
[33:29] cannot see.
[33:32] So I just say thank you, Lord.
[33:37] And I
[33:40] I won't complain.
[33:43] You know the Lord,
[33:47] he knows what's best for me.
[33:52] Through my tearfilled
[33:54] eyes.
[33:56] Sometimes I cannot see.
[34:01] So I'll just say
[34:04] thank you, Lord.
[34:06] I lift my hands and say, "You know
[34:10] what's best, Lord."
[34:13] Oh, and I
[34:19] I won't complain.
[34:23] [Music]
[34:28] [Applause]
[34:41] And brother Joel keeps practicing.
[34:43] They'll sing good one of these days.
[34:46] Amen. We love those folks, don't we?
[34:49] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's stand to
[34:52] our feet if you will. Let's sing a
[34:53] little chorus this morning. It's joy
[34:55] unspeakable and full of glory.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "It's a truth.
[35:01] Somebody say, "It's really the truth."
[35:04] Give him another good hand clap of
[35:05] praise this morning.
[35:07] Oh, it is joy unspeakable
[35:11] and full of glory.
[35:15] Full of glory,
[35:18] full of glory. It is joy unspeakable
[35:23] and full of glory. and the half has
[35:28] never yet been told.

[35:48] and full of glory. And the half has
[35:52] never yet been told. One more time. It
[35:56] is joy unspeakable
[35:59] and full full of glory.
[36:03] Full of glory.
[36:06] Full of glory. It is joy unspeakable.
[36:12] Full of glory. And the h has never yet
[36:17] been told. Got to sing it again. It is
[36:20] joy unspeakable.
[36:24] It's full of glory.
[36:27] Full of glory.
[36:30] Full of glory. It's joy. I see.
[36:44] Glorable.
[36:51] Is it full of glory?
[36:56] It is joy unspeakable
[37:00] of glory and love has never yet.
[37:07] Oh, it is joy unspeakable.
[37:11] Full of glory,
[37:15] full of glory.
[37:18] It's full of glory.
[37:21] Joy unspeakable
[37:23] and hope of glory and
[37:27] has never yet been told.
[37:35] Go ahead and give him a wonderful hand.
[37:37] Praise the Lord.
[37:40] [Music]
[37:41] Amen. Isn't it such an awesome privilege
[37:44] to be a Christian to serve the Lord? God
[37:47] bless. You can be seated for a couple of
[37:49] minutes. We got a little baby to
[37:51] dedicate today. Brother Josiah and
[37:53] Sister Haven. If they bring a little
[37:56] baby girl, we'll dedicate her to the
[37:59] Lord today.
[38:04] Bring them in.
[38:08] Bring them in.
[38:12] Bring them in from fields of sin.
[38:20] Bring them in.
[38:24] Bring them in.
[38:28] brings our little ones to Jesus.
[38:37] Praise the Lord. What a little angel.
[38:40] Y'all think that when she's keeping you
[38:41] up at five or six hours during the night
[38:44] trying to pray about it, huh? Yeah.
[38:46] Yeah. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our
[38:49] heads together.
[38:52] Dear Jesus, how we thank you, Lord, for
[38:56] another little gift, treasure sent down
[38:59] from heaven.
[39:01] Dear God, I pray today that you would
[39:04] just be with my brother and sister as
[39:06] they embark on this new journey.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Don't seem like it's been that long ago
[39:12] that they were just a little boy and
[39:15] girl when I first met their mom and
[39:17] daddy. And now, Lord, here they are
[39:20] married and got their own little child.
[39:24] And it's true that time waits on none of
[39:27] us. And Lord, it's it's an honor for us
[39:31] whenever you've committed such to our
[39:33] keeping, but also what an awesome
[39:36] responsibility.
[39:38] Help my sister that she can be exactly
[39:40] what we've been taught in the word, that
[39:43] she's to be that fifth gospel. help my
[39:46] brother to be able to influence his
[39:49] little daughter in the right way. We
[39:52] know that the father's influence upon a
[39:55] girl can have such an impact even on the
[39:58] kind of husband that she will choose,
[40:00] the kind of man that she will look for,
[40:03] the kind of man that will fulfill her
[40:05] dreams. So both of them together, they
[40:09] want to bring themselves, not only their
[40:11] little girl, but themselves with her
[40:15] before you today. I pray, Father, that
[40:18] you'd be with them and strengthen them.
[40:20] I pray for Lily, Lord, that you'd be
[40:22] with her. If she would be able to live
[40:25] and time would go on to where she would
[40:27] know right from wrong. May the spirit of
[40:30] God touch her heart. May her heart be
[40:32] tender toward you, Lord, that she can be
[40:35] able to give her life to you. We
[40:37] dedicate her to you today, Father, for a
[40:40] life of service. In the name of the Lord
[40:42] Jesus, we ask. Amen.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, she woke up about right about when
[40:49] you get done preaching.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Congratulations,
[41:01] Y'all can just go ahead and tell me
[41:03] whenever I get intolerable and I will
[41:05] step down. I mean, you know, if I put
[41:07] everybody to sleep the way I do the
[41:09] babies.
[41:10] Let's stand together. But until you do,
[41:12] I'm going to go ahead and preach.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[41:19] just long as we had that understanding.
[41:22] Let's turn today to second Peter chapter
[41:24] 1 verse two again.
[41:28] how blessed I have been personally by
[41:31] looking at these great great passages of
[41:34] scripture. Once again, I've dealt with
[41:36] this difference of times, of course, um,
[41:39] in my ministry since I've been in the
[41:42] message, and I've been blessed every
[41:44] time that I've ever looked at it. But I
[41:46] don't mind telling you, I've been so
[41:48] blessed this time because I can see
[41:52] certainly see the need since the last
[41:54] time that I dealt with this to the
[41:55] statue of a perfect man. I knew we
[41:58] needed it then, but as times went on,
[42:00] oh, I realize how much more we need it
[42:02] now. And what's a great thing about it
[42:05] is we don't just need it, we're going to
[42:07] get it.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; By the help of the Lord. I have that
[42:10] much confidence in him. I can't say I
[42:12] got that much in you or that much in me
[42:15] cuz I know how rotten our old stinking
[42:17] flesh is. But I have confidence in his
[42:19] word.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; He would never put it in his Bible if
[42:22] somebody was not going to fulfill it.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; I figure I'm going to fulfill scripture
[42:27] one way or the other.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to choose the ones I want
[42:30] to fulfill.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. People's going to go to
[42:33] hell. You want to fulfill that? Not me.
[42:35] There's going to be repbates. You going
[42:37] to fulfill that? Not me. There's going
[42:39] to be children of God. That's the one I
[42:41] want. There's going to be people going
[42:43] to rapture. That's the ones I want.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; So, let's read it together now. And as
[42:48] we read, keep in mind that we are
[42:50] reading from the book that was written
[42:53] by a man that was very flighty,
[42:57] constantly
[42:59] making a fool of himself. Uh Peter was
[43:02] like many of us. The only time he opened
[43:04] his mouth was to change feet.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; And look what God did with him.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; So remember now when we read this, we're
[43:13] not talking about an archbishop or some
[43:16] dascese somewhere, some perfect man that
[43:18] was without fault. But we're talking
[43:20] about a man that had so many issues in
[43:22] his own life. So he's able to write of
[43:25] what God had done in him as well.
[43:28] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[43:30] through the knowledge of God and of
[43:32] Jesus our Lord, according as his divine
[43:35] power hath given us all things, all
[43:39] things that pertain unto life and
[43:42] godliness, through the knowledge of him
[43:45] that hath called us to glory and virtue,
[43:49] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[43:51] great and precious promises, that by
[43:54] these you might be partakers of the
[43:58] divine nature, having escaped the
[44:01] corruption that is in the world through
[44:04] lust.
[44:06] Wow. And here I was taught for years of
[44:08] my life it come through an apple.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us plainly how it came.
[44:16] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[44:20] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[44:24] knowledge, and to knowledge
[44:27] temperance, and to temperance patience,
[44:32] and to patience godliness, and to
[44:34] godliness brotherly kindness,
[44:37] and a brotherly kindness, charity.
[44:40] Before we pray today, how many like to
[44:43] be remembered before the Lord,
[44:45] Carol wasn't able to be with us today as
[44:47] we was backing out of the driveway to
[44:50] come to church. She got really sick,
[44:51] nauseated like and um she went back in
[44:55] the house and I just checked on her bit
[44:57] before I come out and she's really not
[44:59] feeling good today really sickly. I
[45:01] believe the Lord can touch her, don't
[45:03] you?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And all of your needs as well. So, let's
[45:05] just pray together.
[45:07] Heavenly Father, we are so honored today
[45:11] to be in your presence,
[45:14] dear God, to realize that every one of
[45:17] us one day are going to stand before
[45:19] you.
[45:20] I do not want to stand there on my own
[45:24] merits. I do not want to stand there on
[45:27] any works,
[45:29] anything that I could ever do. I don't
[45:31] want to stand before you because of my
[45:34] preaching or because of my hospital
[45:37] visits or anything in this world that I
[45:39] could ever do. I will need the greatest
[45:43] representation
[45:45] that could ever be given to a mortal and
[45:48] it is not our works. I'm so grateful to
[45:51] know that when we stand before you that
[45:53] day that you have made a way for us,
[45:56] Lord. And we believe once the way is
[45:59] made and then we start walking in the
[46:01] way that there's a journey to be
[46:03] completed. And then we know that this is
[46:06] the stature that you're wanting to build
[46:08] in your people. So, Father, as we look
[46:10] into your word today, help us. We know
[46:13] church is is something that's very
[46:16] unique. It's not like going to a store.
[46:19] It's not like going fishing. It's not
[46:21] like going to a favorite pastime to
[46:24] where it's all hoopla and rejoicing and
[46:26] this and that. We do. We do rejoice.
[46:29] Yes. But this is more serious than that.
[46:32] We come, Father, that we can hear our
[46:35] shortcomings, our failures, that we can
[46:38] hear the word of God coming forth as a
[46:40] measuring rod and measure where we are.
[46:43] And by that, we can know where we need
[46:45] to go. So, we're praying you'd help us
[46:48] today. Lord Jesus, I pray for the hands
[46:50] that were uplifted, the needs they
[46:52] signified. Lord, we agree together today
[46:55] that you're going to move for Carol. You
[46:57] see this nausea, Lord, and just so sick
[47:00] that she didn't feel like coming to
[47:02] church today. And as a body of
[47:04] believers, we command that devil to back
[47:07] away from her. Satan, you're a liar.
[47:10] You're defeated in the name of Jesus.
[47:13] bring healing to her body today, Lord.
[47:16] Speak to us your words of life in Jesus
[47:18] name. And the saints said,
[47:20] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, church. You may be
[47:24] seated.
[47:29] It's amazing to me that God would choose
[47:35] such things as he did to be able to add
[47:39] to people's lives
[47:42] that would make them superhuman.
[47:46] Now, having been raised in a home uh
[47:50] whenever I was a kid to where that we
[47:52] had television
[47:54] and I watched all kinds of superheroes.
[47:59] So, there was Batman and Superman and
[48:04] all different ones like that. Maybe many
[48:06] of you saw the same ones or you read the
[48:09] comic books. And isn't there something
[48:12] about us as human beings that we
[48:14] actually look for that type of figure?
[48:19] Someone who is, you know, above and
[48:21] beyond the average person that would be
[48:25] able to be someone that we could all
[48:28] look up to. And we think by them they
[48:31] could go into a telephone booth and
[48:33] change their clothes and come out and
[48:36] solve all issues. and they can come in
[48:39] and save the damsel in distress. And uh
[48:42] you know, you realize that they're not
[48:44] going to get killed because you're only
[48:46] watching part three of a 38-part series.
[48:50] So, you know, they got to live through
[48:51] the rest of it. So, it's not realistic
[48:54] though. It's not They never are going to
[48:57] project, and that's the power of
[48:59] Hollywood, that they want to put
[49:01] something before us. I heard it. I heard
[49:04] it the other day and they were talking
[49:06] about trying to bring some legislation
[49:10] into our nation because they have found
[49:14] out by studies and by relating physical
[49:17] or psychotherapists and different ones
[49:20] that have dealt with some of our youth
[49:22] and this day. and they're hearing it
[49:25] over and over again, especially from
[49:27] young ladies that social media is so
[49:31] affecting their upbringing. It's
[49:34] affecting how they look at others, how
[49:36] they look at themselves. And they're
[49:38] tying the increased um of number of
[49:41] suicides, especially with young girls.
[49:44] And over and over again, as I listened
[49:47] to it, I thought, what a sad thing that
[49:49] we're living. And they are toying around
[49:52] and kind of putting it back and forth
[49:54] before legislators that they would set
[49:57] it at the age of 16 or 18 or whatever
[49:59] more that our our young people would not
[50:03] be able to even have access to the
[50:05] internet and a lot of things like that
[50:07] because they're finding out with
[50:10] psychiatrists and these people that are
[50:12] trying to treat them that it's affecting
[50:14] them in such a negative way. And you
[50:18] think that putting something before
[50:20] people as they are young as I saw a clip
[50:24] yesterday on YouTube and it was in a
[50:28] church, a gospel church so-called and
[50:31] there was a woman sitting on the altar
[50:34] there with the steps and she was the
[50:36] pastor, however that can be since God's
[50:39] word don't ordain it. But she was
[50:41] sitting there and she had a long robe on
[50:43] and and had a wrap around her neck with
[50:46] the the colors of the rainbow. And then
[50:48] they had the rainbows draped up behind
[50:50] it. And they were having a little
[50:52] children's service. And there was
[50:54] another teacher there sitting by her.
[50:56] And she went to the book of Genesis, of
[50:58] course, and talking about God and his
[51:00] great mercy and and God gave the rainbow
[51:03] covenant. And all these little kids were
[51:05] sitting on the first two or three rows.
[51:08] And she asked those little children. Now
[51:10] she said, "How many knows that there's
[51:12] other symbols that God has used the
[51:15] rainbow for?" And all them little kids
[51:17] was raising their hand. And she started
[51:20] asking them, "So what what does God mean
[51:23] for the rainbow to be?" And you're with
[51:25] these little children now, the size of
[51:27] ours, Sunday school age. And they were
[51:30] answering these perverts as they were
[51:33] sitting there in a denominational church
[51:37] in America and saying gay rights,
[51:41] lesbian, LGBTQ,
[51:44] yo, you know, whatever more all they
[51:46] going to. And I thought if the Lord
[51:48] tries, how many of them will turn out to
[51:51] be just like them perverts sitting there
[51:54] in front of them? Why? This is why Satan
[51:57] wants to not just keep that thing out
[52:00] here in the world. He wants to bring it
[52:02] inside the church. And remember, it was
[52:06] Lot that the Sodommites knocked on his
[52:10] door,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; not on Abraham's.
[52:14] So, Satan knows exactly what it is to
[52:18] put an image before people that they
[52:22] will psychologically
[52:24] attach to that image. And if it ties
[52:27] with something within their soul, then
[52:30] they want to become or at least tolerate
[52:34] that image that they see. So this is why
[52:38] a lot of the churches are having these
[52:40] drag shows as they call it and they're
[52:43] doing it before churches. So they have
[52:45] their fall festivals and all their
[52:48] gatherings and they will have one drag
[52:50] queen after another after another. I
[52:53] wonder how those drag queens will be
[52:56] will be feeling when the angels drag
[52:59] them and hang them over hell and cast
[53:02] them into the lake of fire. Preach it
[53:04] now. Oh, I imagine their drag won't be
[53:07] worth too much then, will you?
[53:10] &gt;&gt; But you see, there's something about it.
[53:12] Satan knows it. He did it years ago in
[53:16] the land of the Canaanites by having
[53:19] them to worship Kimosh. Having them to
[53:22] worship the god sin, having them to
[53:25] worship all the gods and raise their
[53:28] children up under the oposes of that
[53:31] then they would turn out to be even
[53:33] worse than their parents were. So this
[53:36] is in turn why God told the children of
[53:39] Israel, teach your children these
[53:43] principles, these laws, these precepts
[53:47] that I've given them. Why? Because God
[53:49] knew also by keeping that before your
[53:53] children, it can have a great influence
[53:56] on what they become in life. You
[53:59] remember the story that the prophet told
[54:01] us about a family of seven sons and
[54:04] these brothers were raised in the same
[54:06] house and every one of them wind up
[54:10] going to become sailors and they
[54:12] wondered why. And one day walking into
[54:15] the room, someone notices it. And here
[54:18] is this picture on the wall of a frigot
[54:21] or whatever it was, a a naval ship, and
[54:24] they begin to realize it was that
[54:27] influence of those young men that they
[54:30] had that image there projected to them.
[54:34] But you know, God also, he was the
[54:36] original one of course from this. For we
[54:39] know that the Bible tells us in the book
[54:40] of Genesis, in the beginning when God
[54:43] made them, God made them male and female
[54:46] as he created them and he called their
[54:48] name Adam. And God projected the
[54:51] spiritual man that he made in Genesis 1
[54:55] into a body of dust or clay into the man
[54:59] of Genesis 2. And in the image of God
[55:02] created he them. So God knew there was
[55:06] something about putting an image before
[55:09] human beings that affects their life.
[55:12] Now this is why people want to water
[55:15] down and modify the image of the Lord
[55:19] Jesus Christ in the day we live in. So
[55:22] theologians will get in the pull pit.
[55:25] They'll get on their podcast. They'll do
[55:27] their radio broadcast, television,
[55:29] whatever it is, and they're not only
[55:31] trying to change your image, but they
[55:33] want to change the image of God in your
[55:37] mind. So, they water him down. They
[55:39] weaken him down. And somehow they
[55:42] project to you and I that God was in the
[55:45] Old Testament mean and wicked and God
[55:48] required of a lot of people. But in the
[55:50] New Testament, God got saved and God got
[55:53] rid of rid of his bad old temper and God
[55:57] got so much love and God found so much
[56:01] mercy. So what God told the children of
[56:04] Israel to stone people for which was
[56:07] sodomy. Now God in the New Testament
[56:10] says it's okay. It don't bother me no
[56:13] more. I got I I got saved. I went down
[56:16] to an altar and I give my heart to
[56:19] whoever God would give his heart to and
[56:22] I I got saved. Now I told the children
[56:25] of Israel that if they found a sodomite
[56:27] in their days, put them outside the
[56:29] gate, pick up stones and hit them on the
[56:31] head until dead.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I got saved. So now I'm okay
[56:38] with men, women.
[56:41] I'm okay with gay pastors. I'm okay. Now
[56:44] what do they do? They change the image
[56:47] of God into a man-made image and they
[56:51] start putting it before their people.
[56:53] Now where do them preachers get it at?
[56:55] In some cemetery I I mean seminary that
[56:59] they go to. Oh, aren't you glad your
[57:01] pastor didn't attend such a seminary?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; But then now we don't want to just
[57:06] strike on that negative side. But there
[57:09] is also a positive side to the exact
[57:13] same concept which come of course from
[57:15] the presence of God and that is that we
[57:19] also do likewise but we just don't use
[57:23] the same images but I'm doing the same
[57:26] thing every time I preach to you. I'm
[57:29] putting an image of whatever it is the
[57:32] Lord puts on my heart to bring to you.
[57:34] I'm putting an image before you. Now I
[57:37] can work under both laws of the laws of
[57:39] life and the laws of death of the law of
[57:42] light and the law of darkness. So I will
[57:44] use contrast as any preacher does and I
[57:48] will put before you those who fall and
[57:50] those who didn't follow that image and
[57:52] then I will also put before you the
[57:55] positive side of those who followed in
[57:58] the image, the projected image of what
[58:00] God had for the day and show you both of
[58:02] their end results. And then you have to
[58:05] ultimately choose which path you desire
[58:08] to go. Quite simple, really, isn't it?
[58:10] So, you know, whenever we look at what
[58:13] God is doing, well, brother Donnie, how
[58:15] are we going to know the difference
[58:16] between the bride and the church? That's
[58:18] really not that hard, actually. All we
[58:20] have to do is find the original image of
[58:22] God in his word and then see what
[58:25] preachers and what churches are
[58:27] preaching that image. Well, that's a
[58:29] pretty good answer right there. And that
[58:31] would let you know then whether that
[58:33] church you're attending or that preacher
[58:35] that you're listening to is actually
[58:37] from God or from the devil. Because if
[58:40] he's projecting and changing the image
[58:43] of God, then you know that God is
[58:45] immutable and God is unchangeable in his
[58:48] ways. So you are sitting under a false
[58:51] prophet that's going to damn your soul
[58:53] to hell along with his own because God
[58:56] is perfect. And if we believe that God
[59:00] does not need changing,
[59:02] &gt;&gt; we do.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen?
[59:06] &gt;&gt; So now saying of of this word that God
[59:10] wanted Peter to write. Now why did God
[59:13] use Peter to write this instead of Paul?
[59:16] Why did God use Peter to write this
[59:19] instead of John? Peter was not even a
[59:21] prophet. Paul was a prophet of the age
[59:24] and John was a prophet of the
[59:26] apocalypse. But yet Peter was not even a
[59:30] prophet in that sense. And Paul had to
[59:33] actually rebuke Peter. Notice again as
[59:36] we see that instance to where Peter was
[59:39] fellowshipping with the Gentiles. And
[59:41] yet when some of the brothers come from
[59:44] James up at the he was the pastor of the
[59:46] church in Jerusalem. And whenever they
[59:48] come from James and then Peter you know
[59:51] become two-faced. Amen brother Donnie.
[59:55] And Peter kind of pulled away from the
[59:57] Gentiles because he knew that the
[59:59] brothers from Jerusalem would be really
[1:00:02] offended. Now remember, it's in the
[1:00:03] transitory time from God just dealing
[1:00:06] with the Jews only into the merging of
[1:00:08] the Jews and the Gentiles. And some of
[1:00:10] the Jews were still having a hard time
[1:00:13] accepting Gentile brothers on the same
[1:00:16] basis that they were. Right.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; So Peter when he saw the Gentiles there
[1:00:22] there and he had fellowship. Oh my
[1:00:24] praise God eating together and man
[1:00:26] they'd have church together. He would
[1:00:28] see the Holy Ghost fall on them just
[1:00:29] like he did the Jews. He thought this is
[1:00:31] absolutely awesome. I didn't realize
[1:00:33] this is what Jesus meant when he said I
[1:00:36] have sheep which are not of this foe. No
[1:00:38] doubt different things come back to his
[1:00:40] mind by the Holy Ghost. But Peter got
[1:00:42] under peer pressure. Boy don't it
[1:00:45] happen. And it wasn't peer pressure from
[1:00:47] drunks and lards and horongers and
[1:00:49] thieves. It was peer pressure from
[1:00:52] religious people from Jerusalem which is
[1:00:55] headquarters. Oh my. Then what did they
[1:00:58] do when they come around? Peter got
[1:01:00] underneath that influence and then Peter
[1:01:02] kind of pulled himself away from them
[1:01:05] gentile brothers and Paul saw it. Now
[1:01:08] remember Peter was with Jesus
[1:01:10] personally. He hunted with him as we'd
[1:01:13] say. He laid down beside him or near him
[1:01:16] while there for three and a half years.
[1:01:18] He ate meals with him. He talked with
[1:01:21] him. He done all of these things
[1:01:23] personally. And he could say to Paul,
[1:01:25] "You wasn't even there. I was." He
[1:01:28] himself baptized me, never baptized you.
[1:01:32] Oh, he could say all kinds of things in
[1:01:34] the flesh. But you know what? Paul
[1:01:36] realized his position. So Paul actually
[1:01:40] rebuked Peter in this stage of his
[1:01:44] journey. Oh my. And said some pretty
[1:01:47] harsh words to Peter. You know why? Cuz
[1:01:51] Peter needed it.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to think now of that
[1:01:55] instance where it's recorded in the
[1:01:58] scripture that Peter himself had not yet
[1:02:02] quite attained to the stature of a
[1:02:05] perfect man.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Woo. Woo. Now, he had the Holy Ghost. He
[1:02:11] had faith. He had virtue. We saw that
[1:02:14] going out of him at the lame man that
[1:02:16] was crippled there. We see that. But
[1:02:19] Peter was still lacking some things and
[1:02:22] his walk with God. That gives me hope.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Does anybody else have hope today? So
[1:02:29] now then Peter years later, this is
[1:02:32] coming close to, you know, to the
[1:02:33] winding up years of his ministry by the
[1:02:36] time that he writes this. So Peter was
[1:02:38] like us. He was still a work in
[1:02:41] progress. And no doubt Peter might have
[1:02:44] been one of the ones that was a little
[1:02:46] bit slower, maybe coming along and some
[1:02:49] of these things of God. Paul was a
[1:02:51] different type of makeup and his battles
[1:02:54] were totally different, more
[1:02:55] intellectual. And when you're that way,
[1:02:57] you tend to lean back toward the mind.
[1:03:00] Peter was ignorant, unlearned. You know,
[1:03:02] he didn't never did battle that thing.
[1:03:04] But God knew exactly what to put in
[1:03:07] these building blocks that would cover
[1:03:10] every saint of God that would live from
[1:03:12] Calvary to the rapture. I think that's
[1:03:15] absolutely awesome that God would pick
[1:03:18] seven great virtues of his own divine
[1:03:21] nature. Now, I know that you know this
[1:03:24] as many times as we've read it that that
[1:03:26] Peter never used casting out devils and
[1:03:30] Peter never used speaking with tongues
[1:03:33] or he never used seeing visions or he
[1:03:36] never used discernment or signs or
[1:03:40] wonders. Now, I want you to notice that
[1:03:42] he does not use in that realm of the
[1:03:45] supernatural those things to be able to
[1:03:49] make the individual out of. Now, every
[1:03:51] one of those things are genuine and
[1:03:54] real, and we believe in them all, don't
[1:03:56] we? But we also know that most of those
[1:04:01] are actually bait on the hook in order
[1:04:05] to catch the fish.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; So, they speaking in tongues. Of course,
[1:04:11] that's for the unbeliever. When a man
[1:04:14] prays in tongues, he's not even supposed
[1:04:16] to do it in the in the service to
[1:04:18] interrupt the service because he's
[1:04:20] edifying himself and not edifying the
[1:04:23] body. Is that right? So then we know
[1:04:26] those gifts have their place when
[1:04:28] they're appropriated, right? But every
[1:04:31] individual that God would even be able
[1:04:34] to use in a manner of a gift don't mean
[1:04:37] that they have the building blocks of
[1:04:39] this here in in second Peter. So they
[1:04:41] could be anointed by the spirit of God
[1:04:44] to prophesy a true prophecy and the
[1:04:47] spirit of God never fall on them one
[1:04:49] more time in their life because they
[1:04:52] don't really have a gift of prophecy. It
[1:04:54] just fell on them in that service and
[1:04:56] then the next service it may fall on
[1:04:58] that person or that person. But this is
[1:05:01] something that don't don't fall on you
[1:05:03] and then leave you. This is something
[1:05:05] that is molded in your walk with God and
[1:05:08] once you get it, you never leave it
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; and it never leaves you. Now let's look
[1:05:14] again if we can at patience and to
[1:05:16] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:05:19] patience. Let's look at the meaning of
[1:05:20] the word again. enduring patient
[1:05:23] continuence, patient waiting,
[1:05:26] steadfastness
[1:05:28] in the New Testament, the
[1:05:29] characteristics of a man who is not
[1:05:32] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[1:05:37] his loyalty to faith and piety by even
[1:05:41] the greatest trials and sufferings.
[1:05:46] The greatest trials and sufferings
[1:05:48] patiently and steadfastly. I I know we
[1:05:52] read this but I want to go back to it
[1:05:53] again if you don't mind in the thy
[1:05:55] church age this is from the church age
[1:05:57] book I know your faith now how does he
[1:06:00] not say here as he did to the church in
[1:06:02] Pergamos you hold my faith he is not
[1:06:06] talking about his faith now but he is
[1:06:09] commending them for their faithfulness I
[1:06:13] love the way this works that God gives
[1:06:16] to us a measure of faith and God will
[1:06:20] require of us that measure of faith to
[1:06:23] be used in its full capacity. And then
[1:06:27] there will be things in life that our
[1:06:29] measure of faith will not attain to. And
[1:06:32] whenever we're in that time in our life,
[1:06:35] the spirit of God will come in and
[1:06:38] adjoin itself to our faith and
[1:06:41] supplement our faith and carry us right
[1:06:44] over the tide to bring it to pass. So
[1:06:46] when the divine sovereignty of God
[1:06:48] projects a promised word, then the grace
[1:06:51] of God will also give the strength to
[1:06:54] carry it through. But that don't mean
[1:06:56] then that our everyday walk with God is
[1:06:59] going to be only by the faith of Jesus.
[1:07:01] We wouldn't overcome nothing if it was
[1:07:03] that way. But it will be our faith and
[1:07:06] his faith together. Now notice he said,
[1:07:08] "Now faithfulness and patience go
[1:07:11] together." In fact, patience is the
[1:07:14] outcome of faithfulness. For it says in
[1:07:16] James 1:3, "The trying of your faith
[1:07:19] workketh patience. There is absolutely
[1:07:22] no other way in which to gain patience.
[1:07:25] It has to come by the trial of your
[1:07:27] faith." Romans 5:3. Tribulation workers.
[1:07:30] Patience. How highly God regards the
[1:07:34] outworking of our patience is seen in
[1:07:37] James 1:4. But let patience have her
[1:07:41] perfect work that you won't be. Notice
[1:07:43] this, that you may be perfect and entire
[1:07:46] lacking nothing. God's will for us is
[1:07:49] perfection.
[1:07:51] How many wants to be perfect?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; That is not human sinlessness.
[1:07:56] That is complete. God's will for us is
[1:08:00] perfection. And that perfection is
[1:08:03] patience. Waiting on God and waiting for
[1:08:07] God. This is the process of character
[1:08:11] development. And everybody can say,
[1:08:13] "Help me, Lord." How highly God has
[1:08:16] commended these saints of the dark ages.
[1:08:19] Patient as lambs led to the slaughter.
[1:08:22] Lovingly, faithfully, they serve God.
[1:08:26] This is all they wanted out of life.
[1:08:28] Just service to their Lord. How great,
[1:08:31] oh my, was their reward. I can't wait to
[1:08:34] see these saints of God as they walked
[1:08:36] before him on that day. Can you now I
[1:08:38] want you to think that God is the only
[1:08:41] one that can be able to bring this
[1:08:43] measure unlike the realm of the
[1:08:46] supernatural gifts. Now I you know I I
[1:08:49] just got to be honest with you. I'm sure
[1:08:50] I probably don't understand as much
[1:08:52] about the supernatural realm as a lot of
[1:08:55] other brothers do but I I do understand
[1:08:58] maybe a little T90 bit about it. But I
[1:09:00] do know that Satan can hand out gifts by
[1:09:03] the handfuls. And I know that Satan
[1:09:06] actually loves to be able to move in a
[1:09:09] message of God that he sent down through
[1:09:12] the ages, all of them, and be able to
[1:09:14] counterfeit the production or the
[1:09:17] appearance of supernatural gifts. And
[1:09:20] the reason he does that is to bring
[1:09:22] question on the credibility of the real
[1:09:25] and the genuine. Now, when I'm talking
[1:09:27] about gifts, I'm not just talking about
[1:09:28] tongues, interpretation of tongues,
[1:09:30] signs, wonders, all that. But I'm also
[1:09:32] talking about gifts of the ministry. So
[1:09:36] there are genuine pastor, genuine
[1:09:38] teacher, genuine evangelists, but Satan
[1:09:41] also loves to impersonate those
[1:09:44] ministerial gifts. So he has down
[1:09:47] through the ages and he'll continue to
[1:09:48] do so. So he will move on men's hearts
[1:09:52] and they will be totally convinced that
[1:09:55] they are called of God to be a preacher.
[1:09:58] And then they will start getting under
[1:10:00] that load and that burden and oh my,
[1:10:02] they just absolutely know beyond a
[1:10:04] shadow of a doubt it's God. And
[1:10:06] sometimes a learned man, the one that's
[1:10:08] experienced with divine wisdom can be
[1:10:11] able to pick it up just like that.
[1:10:13] Something wrong about that call. So they
[1:10:15] will be able to see and oh there's
[1:10:17] something out of cater. Other times you
[1:10:19] can't. So you just have to let it go.
[1:10:21] And it may be years, absolutely years
[1:10:25] before the fruition of that man will
[1:10:28] come into maturity. And when it does,
[1:10:30] then you look and say, "Oh my goodness."
[1:10:33] So this is what this has been about the
[1:10:36] whole time that this man will be able to
[1:10:39] carve out a niche in the message of the
[1:10:42] hour as it's been in every age. and he
[1:10:44] would be able to eventually pull an
[1:10:47] element of people as Paul said they're
[1:10:49] making disciples after themselves. So
[1:10:52] they're not really leading people to
[1:10:53] Christ even though that's what they say
[1:10:55] they're doing. And it what does Satan
[1:10:56] want to do? He has impersonated many
[1:10:59] pastors down through the ages. And the
[1:11:02] church said he has impersonated many
[1:11:05] prophets down through the ages. Many
[1:11:08] evangelists. Is that right? Can you
[1:11:10] preach your brothers? Say amen to that.
[1:11:12] Now, your brothers here today that's
[1:11:14] genuinely called of God, you have
[1:11:15] nothing to worry about because you know
[1:11:17] you're called and you know that God
[1:11:19] called you. But this is also a truth
[1:11:21] that has been down through the ages. And
[1:11:23] who has caused some of the greatest
[1:11:25] damage in the message of God down
[1:11:27] through the age from Pentecost until the
[1:11:29] end time so-called preachers? But have
[1:11:32] most of them that's caused such a mess
[1:11:34] been God called? Absolutely not. Why
[1:11:37] would God come in to bring hella,
[1:11:40] destruction, splits, false doctrine,
[1:11:43] error, this that and the other? God
[1:11:45] would would would orchestrate a body a
[1:11:47] move of God. And then God would raise
[1:11:49] somebody else up from within the same
[1:11:51] thing and divide and split and separate
[1:11:54] and make their own group, which is
[1:11:56] nothing but a miniature denomination is
[1:11:58] all it is. God would do that. Come on,
[1:12:01] church. Wake up. Look at the hour that
[1:12:04] we're living. God would never do such a
[1:12:07] thing. So he loves Satan does to
[1:12:10] impersonate God's gifts and then by the
[1:12:13] impersonation he will cause so much
[1:12:17] damage. It's no wonder to me that a lot
[1:12:19] of folks around the message don't
[1:12:20] believe in preachers because they've
[1:12:22] been so burned by so many of them. I
[1:12:24] understand I've been burned by probably
[1:12:26] more than than a lot of you all have.
[1:12:28] Believe me. But that does not change my
[1:12:31] belief in God's word. God's prophet had
[1:12:34] been no doubt uh took advantage of lied
[1:12:37] upon everything in the world by
[1:12:39] preachers more than all of us put
[1:12:41] together. But it didn't stop him from
[1:12:43] still believing in preachers. So you
[1:12:46] can't use that excuse. So what does the
[1:12:48] devil do? He loves to impersonate them
[1:12:51] in order to use them to pull away
[1:12:55] confidence and factual proof by the word
[1:12:58] of God that God still uses them. And
[1:13:01] it's the same way with the virtues in
[1:13:03] our life. So there is a genuine faith
[1:13:06] from God. Then there is a human faith
[1:13:08] that people can have and believe God's
[1:13:11] promise by their human faith. Human
[1:13:13] virtue, a divine virtue, a human
[1:13:15] knowledge, a divine knowledge. Every one
[1:13:18] of these virtues have a twin. And the
[1:13:21] prophet said, "Call them naturiven." So
[1:13:25] they were naturiven. How many of you
[1:13:27] know some good Baptist people that you
[1:13:29] work with and Nazarene and all kinds of
[1:13:33] good people as we call them? And yet, do
[1:13:36] they have some patience? No doubt. And
[1:13:38] you look at some of them and you say,
[1:13:39] "Man, a lot. They got more patience than
[1:13:41] some of the people I go to church with."
[1:13:43] Boy, they're nicer than some of the
[1:13:45] people I go to church with. Well, the
[1:13:47] main reason you're saying that is cuz
[1:13:48] you ain't never rubbed their hair the
[1:13:50] wrong way. If you rub it the wrong way,
[1:13:52] it'll be like an old cat that comes up
[1:13:53] to you. Now look, all y'all can like
[1:13:56] cats and you can have 47 of them in your
[1:13:58] house if you do. But they know I don't
[1:14:00] like them and they'll come straight to
[1:14:02] me every time I get in the presence of
[1:14:04] one. They'll come right to me and go to
[1:14:06] rubbing yourself. It sends chills up my
[1:14:09] back. I'm telling you what, they'll pur
[1:14:12] and look at me. You know, I hear a
[1:14:15] growl. I don't hear that pur thing. But
[1:14:17] you realize that's what it is with a lot
[1:14:19] of people. and you only know him at
[1:14:21] certain level and you're rubbing them on
[1:14:23] the back. Oh, nice kitty kitty kitty. I
[1:14:26] don't get the kitty kitty view. I get
[1:14:27] the real view.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But does that change then that
[1:14:33] there's not a real faith? It does not.
[1:14:35] It's the same way with patience. Now,
[1:14:38] real true patience, it will grow like
[1:14:41] all these other virtues. And don't think
[1:14:42] that it's inside of you that when you
[1:14:45] first get it, oh my, it's full grown.
[1:14:47] No. Patience can be in every Holy Ghost
[1:14:50] fil child of God in this service today,
[1:14:53] but it can be at different levels. So as
[1:14:56] it is being tried and it comes to this
[1:14:59] stage of the trial, it grows, it puts on
[1:15:02] more muscles as we would say, and it's
[1:15:05] developing and maturing. But the same
[1:15:07] God wants is to where each of these
[1:15:10] virtues are matured in your life. But
[1:15:13] your level of patience may be different
[1:15:16] from the person sitting beside you. And
[1:15:18] your mature level may be different as
[1:15:21] well. No doubt I'll never have to have
[1:15:24] the maturity of these things that a lot
[1:15:26] of great brothers have. I'm not a great
[1:15:28] brother. I just want to be saved myself.
[1:15:30] Me and greatness ain't nothing really in
[1:15:32] common about me and greatness. No, I
[1:15:33] never has been, never will be. But what
[1:15:35] I desire to be is the measure that God
[1:15:38] has ordained for me. You understand? Now
[1:15:41] many of you ley you'll never attain oh
[1:15:44] if I can just wind up like brother so
[1:15:45] and so and brother so and so that ain't
[1:15:47] nothing but a trick of the devil for you
[1:15:50] to get the wrong image before your eyes
[1:15:53] and that's what you're looking to and
[1:15:55] you look at this church oh man this is
[1:15:57] the perfect church in the message there
[1:15:59] are no perfect churches in the message
[1:16:01] oh this brother here he's a perfect
[1:16:03] preacher there are no perfect preachers
[1:16:05] in the message
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; come on look at every New Testament
[1:16:10] church and how The epistles were written
[1:16:12] to those churches. I'd like to take
[1:16:13] every one of them sometime. The Lord
[1:16:15] lets me live long enough. I'd like to
[1:16:17] take every one of them letters in the
[1:16:19] New Testament where Paul wrote to them
[1:16:20] and also in the book of Revelation and
[1:16:23] show you those same things have lived
[1:16:25] repeatedly over and over again for the
[1:16:28] last 2,000 years. I guarantee you that
[1:16:30] today I could take every one of them
[1:16:33] letters and find people in our assembly
[1:16:35] and those who stream and claim this as
[1:16:38] their home church and find traits and
[1:16:40] characteristics of the church at Ephesus
[1:16:42] of the church at Pergamos of the church
[1:16:44] of Thotyara of Thessalon Church on and
[1:16:48] on and on. Why? These are not just
[1:16:50] pretty books in the Bible. It is
[1:16:53] prophetic from God. God chose certain
[1:16:56] churches. Don't get in your mind. These
[1:16:58] were the only churches that he
[1:17:00] addressed. There was all kinds of other
[1:17:02] churches by the time the book of
[1:17:03] revelation was written. It's 96 AD. So
[1:17:06] there was all kinds of churches under
[1:17:08] different names. But he selected certain
[1:17:11] churches that had traits about them that
[1:17:13] would be suited for prophetic type a
[1:17:16] symbol. So what is the book of
[1:17:18] revelation? When we look at the church
[1:17:19] ages, what is that? It's an image set
[1:17:22] before us. Do this and don't do that. do
[1:17:25] this and don't do that. You understand?
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Now, when we look at this, then God, now
[1:17:31] keep in mind Luther Luther could never
[1:17:36] stand in the full stature of a perfect
[1:17:39] man.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Wesley could not stand in the full
[1:17:44] stature of a perfect man. Pentecost
[1:17:48] could not stand in the full stature.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute, brother Donnie.
[1:17:54] Now, how how how so some of the people
[1:17:57] in our church that have already passed
[1:17:59] and went on and you're just now
[1:18:02] preaching some of this stuff. What about
[1:18:04] them that went on before you started
[1:18:06] preaching this stuff?
[1:18:09] Our father will supplement and take care
[1:18:11] of them.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; You worry about yourself.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Ain't none of his going to
[1:18:19] be missing on that day.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you. I've watched
[1:18:23] many saints in our church pass and been
[1:18:26] around them in their final days and
[1:18:29] watched things transpire. I had a
[1:18:31] situation that happened to me several
[1:18:33] years ago and it was a brother that's
[1:18:35] been gone now for a few years and oh it
[1:18:37] was a man that I had such awesome
[1:18:39] respect for and still do. great brother
[1:18:42] in the Lord and been here for a long
[1:18:43] long time. And as he was coming close to
[1:18:47] to passing over, maybe just a week or so
[1:18:49] before he actually crossed over. And he
[1:18:51] he I I went to visit the brethren.
[1:18:54] Whenever I did, there was this person
[1:18:55] there and that person there, another
[1:18:57] person, and he said, "I want everybody
[1:18:59] to leave but brother Donnie." So, okay.
[1:19:03] So, everybody left. And he said,
[1:19:05] "Brother, come here." He was he was in
[1:19:07] the bed and he couldn't get up and he
[1:19:08] said took me by the hand. He said,
[1:19:10] "Brother Donnie," he said, "I I I said
[1:19:13] something against you years ago." And he
[1:19:17] said, "I I I didn't understand what you
[1:19:20] was preaching about this and preaching
[1:19:21] about that." And he said, "I should have
[1:19:23] already made it right, but I guess I
[1:19:26] just had too much pride."
[1:19:29] And he said, "My brother, I want you to
[1:19:32] forgive me.
[1:19:34] Will you forgive me?"
[1:19:38] I said with all of my heart.
[1:19:42] It wasn't but a few days he was gone.
[1:19:47] I've seen and heard things like that for
[1:19:50] decades. Now what was God doing?
[1:19:54] Completed. Now I knew that brother for
[1:19:57] years. I never even knew this sort of
[1:19:59] thing. I didn't need to anyway. I mean
[1:20:01] the important thing was he needed to
[1:20:02] make it right before the Lord. Now you
[1:20:05] saying whatever is lacking. But brother
[1:20:07] Donnie, what if I go out today and I go
[1:20:09] through the drive-thru and I order a hot
[1:20:11] dog and they get me a chicken leg and I
[1:20:13] lose my temper and then I go down the
[1:20:15] road and I get killed. God knows how to
[1:20:17] take care of you.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; If Jesus had to drive through the drive
[1:20:22] in this day, he might get a little bit
[1:20:24] upset and bothered too.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; One of my granddaughters told me the
[1:20:29] other day learning how to drive. They
[1:20:30] say, "Poppy, I can't wait to pull up to
[1:20:31] the driver and just give me what you
[1:20:33] going what you want. You're going to
[1:20:34] anyhow."
[1:20:37] But there's something about the time
[1:20:40] that we live. And the closer we get,
[1:20:42] friends, it's no wonder you feel like
[1:20:45] sometimes you can't even have a same
[1:20:47] thought in your mind. Look at Israel and
[1:20:50] keep them in tight. Look at what's going
[1:20:52] on the land of Israel. They are being
[1:20:54] bombarded and it will change from one
[1:20:57] thing to another. Just not long ago, it
[1:21:00] looked like that Iran was going to wipe
[1:21:02] them off the map. And look at Iran
[1:21:04] today. What happened in a little while?
[1:21:06] Look at Syria at the the fall of the
[1:21:09] Assad regime. And what happened there?
[1:21:11] They were building up arms. Building up
[1:21:13] arms. And did it work out then where
[1:21:15] Israel could have great peace? It only
[1:21:18] changed from one thing to another. Now
[1:21:21] look, the UK is wanting to recognize a
[1:21:24] Palestinian state. the German chancellor
[1:21:26] want to recognize a Palestinian state
[1:21:29] and different countries are wanting to
[1:21:31] start arms embargo against Israel. So
[1:21:34] it's like it comes down on one side and
[1:21:37] it starts on another side. Can anybody
[1:21:40] relate? So you get through one problem
[1:21:42] of life and you say, "Woo, thank God
[1:21:45] that was close." And then you get
[1:21:47] through that and you get about 45
[1:21:49] minutes of break maybe if you're lucky.
[1:21:51] And then something else happens. And
[1:21:53] then you get through that and something
[1:21:55] else happen. But the problem of it is
[1:21:57] sometimes you don't get through this
[1:21:59] before something else does happen. And
[1:22:01] then you get that took care of and
[1:22:03] something else. Don't you understand
[1:22:04] why? And you saying, "What's wrong with
[1:22:06] me?" There's nothing necessarily wrong
[1:22:08] with you. It's the hour we're living.
[1:22:11] It's an hour of tension. It's an hour of
[1:22:14] trouble. It's an hour of anxiety. And as
[1:22:17] Satan is following and pressuring the
[1:22:19] bride, so is he Israel because the
[1:22:23] transition time from the bride to the
[1:22:26] nation of Israel is so close. It's so
[1:22:29] close. He's working both parallel at the
[1:22:32] same time.
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:22:44] So we say, God, I want patience. Oh God,
[1:22:47] I need it so desperately. Could you have
[1:22:50] it overnighted to me?
[1:22:55] Oh, you know what? Even better than
[1:22:57] that, having it a package at home when I
[1:22:58] go in after church.
[1:23:02] God said, "No,
[1:23:04] I don't do that. I'm still doing the
[1:23:06] same slow
[1:23:09] aging process."
[1:23:14] So God, when it comes to
[1:23:17] making patience and these virtues,
[1:23:20] it's like he can be like the sloth,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; the three-toed
[1:23:26] sloth.
[1:23:35] That was a yawn, in case you didn't
[1:23:37] know. Just takes them so long.
[1:23:42] And we are a nervous wreck.
[1:23:48] Oh, I'll tell you one thing gets on my
[1:23:50] nerves as a stuttering preacher.
[1:23:54] I just want to say, would you sit down
[1:23:56] and please let somebody say it? I can
[1:23:58] say it.
[1:24:02] God don't stutter.
[1:24:06] But he just goes,
[1:24:08] "Has your patience today, don't he?"
[1:24:13] He don't need lying to him because he
[1:24:14] knows anyway.
[1:24:16] I mean, I might lie to you. You might
[1:24:18] lie to me. We might lie to one another.
[1:24:19] We shouldn't do it. Oh, I'm I'm good.
[1:24:21] I'm good. I'm good.
[1:24:23] But he knows.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He knows I need help with mine.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; All these virtues. I want more. Don't
[1:24:31] you have any of these? I have all of
[1:24:33] them.
[1:24:36] I said I have all of them,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; but they vary in size
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; from raisin to M&M's.
[1:24:49] How I'm longing for the day when every
[1:24:51] one of them be about the size of a
[1:24:53] monster pumpkin? You ever see them great
[1:24:55] old big pumpkins they raise, you know,
[1:24:57] wow, that's my image of a perfect man.
[1:25:00] But that may not be who I am at all.
[1:25:03] My maturity may be no bigger than a
[1:25:06] cantaloupe.
[1:25:09] And there will be all seven of them in
[1:25:11] my life.
[1:25:13] And right now I feel like a little tiny
[1:25:15] bud. I'm still a cantaloupe or I'm still
[1:25:18] a watermelon. Whatever I am, I'm I'm
[1:25:19] right there. And the same with you. And
[1:25:22] some of you are long and you think
[1:25:23] there's something there's something
[1:25:24] wrong with me. I I don't have the Holy
[1:25:26] Ghost. That's what it is. I don't have
[1:25:27] the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:29] and you're waiting until you get into
[1:25:31] the stature of a perfect man before you
[1:25:33] got the Holy Ghost. What if you can get
[1:25:34] that without the Holy Ghost? What do you
[1:25:37] need the Holy Ghost for?
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:25:45] Praise the Lord. Let's skip a couple
[1:25:48] there, brothers. Let's go over to taking
[1:25:49] sides of Jesus. Now, the opposite of
[1:25:52] patience is impatience.
[1:25:57] I'm sure most of us today is like a
[1:25:59] tandem truckload when it comes to
[1:26:00] patience. Ain't it?
[1:26:03] I know some of us are taking signs of
[1:26:06] Jesus. I believe that all these things
[1:26:08] has a time of lingering
[1:26:11] waiting.
[1:26:13] But it's waiting for a time for the
[1:26:15] scripture to be fulfilled till
[1:26:16] everything gets right,
[1:26:19] everything in order, waiting. Many times
[1:26:21] we get impatient or patient rather and
[1:26:24] then says impatient like a child great
[1:26:27] anticipations and many times we jump
[1:26:30] ahead
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; that just hinders the work
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; until the work gets caught up. See, we
[1:26:40] must move more reverently, have a
[1:26:42] purpose in the heart that God, if he
[1:26:45] would desire to use us in such and such,
[1:26:48] but wait till he makes the opening
[1:26:52] cuz he has to go ahead of us.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Now, that's so with preachers. That's so
[1:26:59] with every aspect of the five-fold
[1:27:01] ministry. And that's so not only with
[1:27:03] preachers, but with you all looking for
[1:27:05] your vocation. Lord, what I want to do,
[1:27:07] oh, I've always wanted to be a nurse.
[1:27:08] Oh, I've always wanted to be a doctor.
[1:27:10] Oh, man. I've always wanted to be this,
[1:27:11] that, and the other. And then you go to
[1:27:12] taking six, you know, six months or six
[1:27:14] years of school and whatever it is, and
[1:27:16] you realize, I hate this. Who in the
[1:27:19] world taught me into this? I cannot
[1:27:21] believe I ever wanted to take I wanted
[1:27:23] to be this. Now, you think how many of
[1:27:25] us have wasted years of our life because
[1:27:29] we did not go to God and said, "God,
[1:27:31] please help me, but brother Donnie, I'd
[1:27:33] rather do something even if it's wrong."
[1:27:35] You're crazy.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yes, sir.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Do you understand how long it can take
[1:27:41] you to try to ever fix a month's worth
[1:27:46] of wrong?
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; What's this? A year.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; You remember David going to battle that
[1:27:57] night. He was weary about that fight.
[1:28:00] Laid there on those malberry trees until
[1:28:02] he heard the Lord and the rumbling of
[1:28:03] the leaves going before him. Then he
[1:28:06] went with courage because he knowed that
[1:28:09] God had gone before him. And if we only
[1:28:11] do that, brethren, knowing that the
[1:28:13] battle must come, but we must wait till
[1:28:17] we see the hand of God going before us
[1:28:19] to make a way. Now, I want you to
[1:28:20] notice,
[1:28:22] look at the service Wednesday night.
[1:28:26] I told you there was a time to rush and
[1:28:29] there's a time to wait.
[1:28:31] Now, if Rebecca would have tried to
[1:28:33] apply this right here, she'd have never
[1:28:35] made the bride.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; notice patience. I love this in shalom.
[1:28:43] Patience. Some of us get so some of us
[1:28:45] gets in such a hurry. I think many a
[1:28:48] good man has done that. You get in too
[1:28:50] too much of a hurry. You want to you
[1:28:53] want to see you do it yourself.
[1:28:55] Minister, brethren, you know from what
[1:28:57] I'm talking and you just take and listen
[1:28:59] to this tape. I'm talking to you, not
[1:29:01] only the little congregation here, but
[1:29:03] men around the world. Many men go out
[1:29:07] impatient
[1:29:08] but believing that the time is near.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Well, if the time was near in 1964,
[1:29:15] we're already in 2025. So, if preachers
[1:29:18] would become impatient in 64, imagine
[1:29:22] how impatient they would be. genuinely
[1:29:25] called ones in 2025
[1:29:28] and they think if I'm going to do
[1:29:29] anything for God, I've got to do it.
[1:29:31] I've got to get out. Oh, I want to help
[1:29:33] people. I want to I want to reach. Oh,
[1:29:34] I've got to do something. I've got to do
[1:29:35] something. I've got such a burden, such
[1:29:36] a burden. And now, what what can I do,
[1:29:38] Lord? What can I do?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; You realize what a dangerous state it is
[1:29:44] for a man when he gets there?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz if he's not careful, his zeal will
[1:29:50] drive him straight out of the will of
[1:29:53] God.
[1:29:55] Why? Not the right time. And it's
[1:29:58] evident by the way he's acting. He don't
[1:30:00] have the proper knowledge to handle what
[1:30:02] he thinks he can do.
[1:30:04] Well, I realize I'm going to have to
[1:30:06] preach today and say amen and ouch and
[1:30:08] oh me and everything. I'm going to be
[1:30:09] wore out when church is over. It's hard
[1:30:11] to play multi characters, you know, at
[1:30:13] the same time. Oh my. Wait upon the
[1:30:16] Lord. Patience is a virtue. If you can
[1:30:18] have patience, it's virtue. They that
[1:30:20] wait upon the Lord, not they that try to
[1:30:23] get ahead of the Lord. They that try to
[1:30:26] tell the Lord, "Lord, I know you want me
[1:30:29] to do this."
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God
[1:30:38] accent it, you know, with a little glory
[1:30:40] to God. That makes it more spiritual, I
[1:30:43] suppose. Lord, I know you want me to do
[1:30:47] this.
[1:30:50] As a preacher preached at our church one
[1:30:52] time,
[1:30:55] he heard a little something in our
[1:30:56] church that he didn't like. Wasn't from
[1:30:58] me. It was just something, you know,
[1:30:59] amongst the people. When he gets up, he
[1:31:02] says, "I told the Lord,
[1:31:06] if I ever get to preach at this church
[1:31:08] again, I'm going to deal with this.
[1:31:12] I wanted to make a lasso out of the
[1:31:15] microphone cord and rope him like a
[1:31:17] two-year-old calf, flang him down on the
[1:31:20] pull pit, tie both hands and feet, and
[1:31:23] have the deacons throw him out.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz I realized he didn't have a lick
[1:31:29] business being up there in the pullpit,
[1:31:30] although he preached for decades.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are going to tell God sir.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Now come on. Some of you ley don't jump
[1:31:39] on that preacher back cuz some of y'all
[1:31:41] do the same thing with your life.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; There's more of y'all than there is me.
[1:31:46] I better get behind this pull pit right
[1:31:48] now.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Premen.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord. I know you want me to do
[1:31:57] this and glory to God. Don't do that. He
[1:32:00] says wait upon the Lord. They that wait
[1:32:02] upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:32:04] strength. God took thousands of years to
[1:32:06] fulfill his promise of a coming savior.
[1:32:09] But remember, he noted it all the time
[1:32:11] when it was coming. There were many
[1:32:14] people rose up and tried to be
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Messiahs.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? There was more
[1:32:27] Jesus's
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; in the days of the Lord Jesus than just
[1:32:31] one.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; You realize that the historians say
[1:32:35] whenever Pilot when he stood before him
[1:32:37] and Jesus was on one side and Barabus on
[1:32:40] another that Baraba's name was also
[1:32:44] Jesus.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; So which do you want? He said in the
[1:32:49] Aramaic
[1:32:51] Jesus the king of the Jews or Jesus
[1:32:56] Barabus.
[1:32:59] Oh my goodness. Both of them seem like
[1:33:01] troublemakers. Both of them seem to be
[1:33:04] bad type of characters depending on who
[1:33:06] you would ask.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; I wonder if it's not going to be closer
[1:33:11] than we think.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Do we want Jesus Christ the revealed
[1:33:16] word
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; or do we want a Jesus Messiah wannabe?
[1:33:23] God help us.
[1:33:25] Now watch this and hear you him. A group
[1:33:28] of Methodist brethren just received the
[1:33:31] Holy Spirit came to my church where I
[1:33:33] used to pastor talking about the
[1:33:34] tabernacle there and they was great men
[1:33:37] lived up in Indiana and they said,
[1:33:39] "Brother Brandham, we've received the
[1:33:41] Holy Ghost and we've been reading some
[1:33:43] books."
[1:33:46] I guess it depends on the books you're
[1:33:48] reading, right? said, "Should we wait on
[1:33:50] the Lord and seek the Lord to tell us
[1:33:53] our ministry?"
[1:33:56] And I said, "Don't do it at all."
[1:33:59] Whoa.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, the book said, I said,
[1:34:04] but wait a minute, brother. If you ever
[1:34:07] take men that's so zealous that they
[1:34:10] want to always be doing something,
[1:34:14] God couldn't trust that person.
[1:34:22] If you'll notice in the Bible, the man
[1:34:24] that God used was a man that was trying
[1:34:26] to get away from all of it.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; That's the one that God used. Say for
[1:34:30] instance, Paul, Moses, and so forth,
[1:34:32] trying to run from the very cause? You
[1:34:36] mean to tell me that a man can have a
[1:34:38] desire just to help the people of God?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; A woman can have a desire. So she thinks
[1:34:45] she's called to preach because she just
[1:34:48] feels for the needs of the people.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; She just feels it so bad. The Bible
[1:34:54] gives her no no scripture to preach, but
[1:34:56] she's just overwhelmed by this burden.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I've heard a few women preachers that
[1:35:02] could actually outreach men.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Notice this. If a man's got to give man
[1:35:16] to do a certain thing and he was so
[1:35:20] zealous of it, the first thing you know,
[1:35:24] he'd be so swelled out.
[1:35:28] But if a man doesn't want to do such,
[1:35:31] maybe God, now listen to this pitiful
[1:35:34] rendering of this equation.
[1:35:37] Maybe God can use him for a while
[1:35:42] in hell.
[1:35:45] Do you understand our God which can do
[1:35:48] anything and everything? One of the
[1:35:51] hardest things that he can do is to find
[1:35:54] a man that he can use.
[1:35:57] And if a man's ministry will grow and
[1:36:00] grow and his effect and his name and his
[1:36:03] personality and whatever,
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; and if he's not careful, his pride and
[1:36:08] his arrogance
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; will grow right with it.
[1:36:13] And the next thing you know, he wants to
[1:36:15] become a god or an angel. I'm quoting
[1:36:18] you a quote. Question answers 1959.
[1:36:21] He wants to become a god or an angel to
[1:36:26] the people.
[1:36:28] But if God can find a man
[1:36:32] that he can use him and the more he uses
[1:36:34] him, the littleer he gets. And the more
[1:36:37] he uses him, the littleer he gets.
[1:36:41] How many men that God used down through
[1:36:44] the ages
[1:36:46] that he was able to use him the entire
[1:36:48] expanse of their life?
[1:36:51] How many of them when they got older
[1:36:53] didn't get off here with women or here
[1:36:54] with money or here with popularity? How
[1:36:57] many of them run the full course?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Look at Noah died a drunk.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Look at Moses got cut off because of his
[1:37:07] temper.
[1:37:09] I hope and pray to God if God ever sees
[1:37:12] me getting off in some stupid something
[1:37:14] another. I pray he'd take me right
[1:37:17] before you this morning.
[1:37:19] I never want to lead God's children
[1:37:21] astray or bring reproach on this word.
[1:37:24] But let me tell you something, that
[1:37:25] ain't just so with a preacher. It ought
[1:37:27] to be so with every deacon. It ought to
[1:37:29] be so with every trustee. It ought to be
[1:37:31] so with every man, woman, boy, and girl.
[1:37:33] Come on. It's easy for us to point our
[1:37:35] pre our finger preacher, but let's point
[1:37:37] it right back to you as well. There's
[1:37:39] been way more leoty that's done that
[1:37:41] than there has been preachers.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Why? Why?
[1:37:47] Because we like these materials
[1:37:50] in our souls
[1:37:52] that we were motivated by this inward
[1:37:55] nature of these stones. And each one
[1:37:57] runs right into the other. It's amazing
[1:38:01] to me how God can use something so
[1:38:04] structurally sound and solid and make it
[1:38:07] so fluid that it blends right into the
[1:38:10] next one and it all parallels and
[1:38:13] vulcanizes into one structure which is
[1:38:16] totally inseparable.
[1:38:18] This is the perfect man, the perfect
[1:38:22] preacher, the perfect woman.
[1:38:27] And you will never see one of them.
[1:38:30] Never.
[1:38:32] As long as you're looking with this
[1:38:36] right,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; cuz this is the phenomenal thing about
[1:38:39] it. They will be a perfect work in their
[1:38:43] soul and their humanity will still be so
[1:38:46] flawed. And you'll look at their
[1:38:49] humanity and say, "Well, another one
[1:38:51] bites the dust. Well, this one ain't no
[1:38:53] good." Well, he got upset. Well, I don't
[1:38:55] guess there's anybody going to be that.
[1:38:57] God never put this image before us if
[1:38:59] somebody wasn't going to get it. I ask
[1:39:01] you this morning, word of life, is there
[1:39:03] anybody at this church that's going to
[1:39:05] attain to this image of the living God?
[1:39:07] I ain't just talking about preacher but
[1:39:09] men, women, boys, girls, teenagers. What
[1:39:11] about you young people? Is there any
[1:39:14] teenager in this church? Is there any
[1:39:16] young boy that said, "Lord, that's what
[1:39:18] I want to be more than anything else in
[1:39:20] this world." Are there any young sisters
[1:39:22] here today that said, "Lord, that's what
[1:39:24] I want to be. I want to be a full
[1:39:26] daughter of God with this image of God
[1:39:29] inside of me.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:39:41] notice the prophet said if you just if
[1:39:44] he can just get something out of him.
[1:39:46] But man that usually wants to go and
[1:39:48] blast over the world and tear it down,
[1:39:51] usually God can't trust him.
[1:39:54] He wants to do it himself. He wants to
[1:39:57] get into it his own way with it. And if
[1:39:59] a man don't want to go, then God almost
[1:40:02] has to drive him into it.
[1:40:06] That's the type of man that God usually
[1:40:08] uses in the scripture.
[1:40:10] And I said, "Now, this is a prophet's
[1:40:12] advice to men that are coming asking him
[1:40:15] about their ministry.
[1:40:23] I said you just live for him
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; and love him
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; with all your heart
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; and he will place you in the place that
[1:40:34] he desires
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; for you to be
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; so you don't seek your ministry you
[1:40:41] don't seek your gift
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; you seek him
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; and it makes you so in love with him
[1:40:46] that if he wants you to do something
[1:40:47] he's going to have to make you do it
[1:40:49] anyhow believe me I've run into a lot of
[1:40:51] preachers down through the age and Oh,
[1:40:52] you know, I'm I don't know if I'm one
[1:40:54] called to preach or not. I don't want to
[1:40:55] do it, brother Donnie. I don't want to
[1:40:56] do it. And you come to find out they
[1:40:57] done got 32 sermons studied out and
[1:40:59] ready to preach and wait for somebody to
[1:41:00] ask them and sitting right there lying
[1:41:03] to you. I don't want to do it. I don't
[1:41:05] want to do it. But God himself knows
[1:41:07] their heart. What are you doing studying
[1:41:08] it out for? If you don't want to do it,
[1:41:10] come on, somebody. Well, you want to go
[1:41:13] before the Lord and say, "Lord, just
[1:41:15] whatever you want me to do. If you don't
[1:41:16] want me to do nothing but come to church
[1:41:18] and give brother Donnie an amen." I know
[1:41:20] brother Donnie would appreciate amens.
[1:41:22] Brother Donnie would appreciate amen.
[1:41:24] Oh, praise God. Lord, if you don't want
[1:41:26] me to but clap my hands and say, "Preach
[1:41:28] it, man of God." And every now and then
[1:41:30] when I get beside myself and wing a
[1:41:32] buck, I'll stand up and say, "Glory."
[1:41:38] Brother Donnie will come too and then
[1:41:39] we'll go on with the service.
[1:41:50] Israel was so impatient with God.
[1:41:54] 1st Samuel 8:4, all the elders of Israel
[1:41:57] gathered themselves together and came to
[1:41:59] Samuel and to Rama and said unto him,
[1:42:01] "Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk
[1:42:04] not in thy ways."
[1:42:08] Really?
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; So, we have a prophet of God who had
[1:42:12] sons.
[1:42:14] and they wasn't walking according to the
[1:42:16] ways that their daddy taught.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody call 911. We're going to need
[1:42:22] them quick.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Now make us a king
[1:42:29] to judge us like all the nations.
[1:42:34] But the thing displeased Samuel when
[1:42:37] they said,
[1:42:39] "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel
[1:42:42] prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said
[1:42:43] unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of
[1:42:46] the people,
[1:42:48] and all that they say unto thee,
[1:42:52] for they have not rejected thee,
[1:42:56] but they have rejected me
[1:42:59] that I should not reign
[1:43:03] over them."
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; So Samuel was taking it so personal. He
[1:43:09] just feels put out by this. And God
[1:43:11] said, "No, it's not that they're
[1:43:13] rejecting you. They are. They are. But
[1:43:16] the most consequential one is me.
[1:43:19] They're rejecting me.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; But how are they rejecting God?" Through
[1:43:25] the message of the day.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; They're rejecting the word.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; They've rejected me that I should not
[1:43:32] reign with you. Imagine almighty God was
[1:43:34] out among them reigning over them. But
[1:43:36] how was he reigning? Through a prophet's
[1:43:39] voice. All right. Glory.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; But they didn't want to be reigns or a
[1:43:44] prophet's voice.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; They wanted a two soul king
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; or a return ministry king
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; or a seven thunder king. Woo. But we
[1:43:54] going to get into something here.
[1:43:56] Somebody would preach with me a little
[1:43:57] bit. They wanted a king, a man that
[1:44:01] could be among them and be a socialite,
[1:44:03] you know, and do all this and that and
[1:44:05] the other. and they could go up and just
[1:44:06] talk with him and hang around with him
[1:44:08] all the time and fellowship with him.
[1:44:09] They wanted a man that they could look
[1:44:12] and say, "There's our king like all the
[1:44:14] rest of the nations." Well, you put a
[1:44:17] few more letters in front of that and
[1:44:19] you'll find out the parallel of where we
[1:44:21] are in this day, denominations.
[1:44:25] As the nations were the parallel in the
[1:44:27] Old Testament, so the denominations
[1:44:30] are the answering to that in the New
[1:44:33] Testament. And that's why we are against
[1:44:35] a man-made religion. God never chose
[1:44:39] bishops to rule his church. God never
[1:44:42] chose a headquarters to say do this and
[1:44:45] do that. He called men filled with the
[1:44:48] Holy Ghost anointed by the spirit of
[1:44:51] God.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And that's God reigning through the
[1:44:54] ministry
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; preaching the word.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Every man, woman, boy, and girl with the
[1:45:00] king on the throne of their hearts.
[1:45:04] Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Let's read verse eight together. And
[1:45:17] according to all the works which they
[1:45:18] have done since the day that I brought
[1:45:20] them up out of Egypt, even unto this
[1:45:22] day, wherewith they have forsaken me,
[1:45:24] and served other gods,
[1:45:27] so do they also unto thee.
[1:45:31] Now, God told him in the preceding verse
[1:45:33] here, "They're not rejecting you.
[1:45:34] They're rejecting me." And then God
[1:45:35] turns right around. Why? Because Samuel
[1:45:37] had it out of proper cannon just a bit.
[1:45:40] He had it out of sequence. God places
[1:45:43] himself on top and then brings Samuel
[1:45:45] down under him. He said, "As they've
[1:45:47] rejected me, listen again. According to
[1:45:49] all the works which they have done since
[1:45:50] the day that I brought them up out of
[1:45:52] Egypt, even unto this day, where would
[1:45:54] they have forsaken me and served other
[1:45:56] gods, so do they also unto thee."
[1:46:00] Can't you see what happens when folks
[1:46:02] leave God's anointed prophets message?
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Some of them will pick another preacher
[1:46:13] over them.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Others will pick businessmen.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Remember, the children of Israel didn't
[1:46:20] just always want a king.
[1:46:23] As a matter of fact, when they was going
[1:46:24] to pull away from out from under the
[1:46:26] ministry of Moses,
[1:46:28] they said, "We will find a captain."
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; They got tired of that prophet stuff.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; So, they wanted a military man,
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; an educated man. Give us a captain
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; that'll lead us back to Egypt.
[1:46:44] That's the way they wanted to leave the
[1:46:46] message
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; by a captain, a leader of men that would
[1:46:53] lead them back to Egypt.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Follow your leader if that's what you
[1:47:02] wish.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; But you make sure of this. You make sure
[1:47:09] your choice that you're fully looking at
[1:47:12] it clearly.
[1:47:14] Captains
[1:47:16] out from under the oposes of the message
[1:47:18] of the hour will lead you to hell.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Pastors will
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; that pull out from under the influence
[1:47:28] of the message of the hour.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many times old Lot relived
[1:47:34] his choice.
[1:47:37] Oh my friends,
[1:47:40] don't you want to be what God wants you
[1:47:42] to be?
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Humble, small, little, insignificant in
[1:47:48] our own eyes, what difference does that
[1:47:51] make? Really? If we could do something,
[1:47:53] you imagine if we lived our lives and
[1:47:56] one soul was helped along life's
[1:47:58] journey.
[1:48:01] One soul was helped, maybe not even
[1:48:03] saved. Maybe you didn't even leave them
[1:48:04] to the Lord, but they was at a point of
[1:48:07] breaking point in their life and God
[1:48:09] used you to encourage them.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You imagine what your reward will be
[1:48:13] through eternity. And Jesus said, "If
[1:48:15] you only give them a cup of cold water,
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; just a cup of cold water,
[1:48:25] you'll have a great reward in heaven." A
[1:48:27] cup of water.
[1:48:31] It's amazing how we devalue things that
[1:48:34] are so valuable and put such value on
[1:48:37] stupid stuff,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; wealth and this and that and the other.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; People will devalue truths for the sake
[1:48:45] of money.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Some of you brothers in your business
[1:48:50] back and forth and all this that and the
[1:48:52] other and I know it, you know, it can
[1:48:53] get tough among you, but I'm asking you
[1:48:56] brother something.
[1:48:58] Is your business worth lying for?
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Do you have to run one another down and
[1:49:04] and spread lies and things on one
[1:49:06] another in order to get more business
[1:49:08] and get bigger this and that? And you
[1:49:10] honestly think God can bless you
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; in that way. Cannot we be Christians in
[1:49:16] our business if we can't? You need to
[1:49:19] get another job.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; If your business is turning you into a
[1:49:23] liar,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; uhoh. Did you attend the the work fair
[1:49:27] here Friday night? Maybe you ought to be
[1:49:29] more serious.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Don't lying matter no more, children.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how many people I find that
[1:49:42] lie.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Preachers
[1:49:45] that lie
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; get caught in certain situations and lie
[1:49:51] to your face.
[1:49:55] And some of them you think hung the
[1:49:57] moon.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it don't matter no more, right?
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Really? Are you sure?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; You mean lying matters?
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Being dishonest matters?
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody among us that can still
[1:50:12] say, "I'm sorry.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; I messed up.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; I said this wrong. I did that wrong."
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Does it even matter anymore?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; It does. Yes, sir.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; So, it really does.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Well, good. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm glad to hear you
[1:50:32] say that cuz I believe it does, too.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; If this message does not produce people
[1:50:38] of integrity, character
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; above this out here,
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; what better are we?
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Why bear the reproach?
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:51] But it will, my brother, sister.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Remember, this ain't my standard. This
[1:50:57] is not William Brandham's standard.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; This is God's standard.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads?
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:14] I wonder,
[1:51:16] was no one looking around today?
[1:51:22] Have you put a king over your life?
[1:51:27] Have you chosen a king that would
[1:51:28] dictate to you and rule you and
[1:51:33] it's replaced king God?
[1:51:37] I don't mind telling you his ways aren't
[1:51:39] always easy. Oh, no. I'd be lying to you
[1:51:41] to say that. His ways can be difficult.
[1:51:46] Sometimes he moves in ways we just don't
[1:51:48] understand.
[1:51:50] But we trust him even when we don't.
[1:51:55] But give me him any day
[1:51:58] over any other king there is out there.
[1:52:01] How many like to be remembered today?
[1:52:03] May the Lord just search each of our
[1:52:05] hearts. Search mine, Lord God.
[1:52:08] Let's just make sure, friends,
[1:52:11] that we've not placed any king
[1:52:14] above our God.
[1:52:18] For you see, the Lord went ahead and
[1:52:19] told Samuel to give them what they
[1:52:21] wanted. It wasn't his will.
[1:52:24] Be careful what you pray for. Be careful
[1:52:27] what you get in your mind as God
[1:52:31] because you may be moving into a
[1:52:33] permissive will that'll throw you out
[1:52:35] the will of God for years if you ever
[1:52:39] recuperate from it.
[1:52:43] Heavenly Father, I know
[1:52:46] these sermons I've been preaching lately
[1:52:48] are serious. They're they're they're
[1:52:51] soulsearching.
[1:52:54] But Lord, I believe myself it matches
[1:52:56] the time we're living.
[1:52:59] What good Lord would it do us if we just
[1:53:02] have a bunch of emotion and jumping up
[1:53:05] and down and singing and hollering and
[1:53:08] we thank you for all that? It has its
[1:53:09] place.
[1:53:11] But Lord, whenever we stop jumping, we
[1:53:13] want our feet to hit the ground. We want
[1:53:16] a life that is your prophet preached it,
[1:53:19] is your life worthy of the gospel?
[1:53:23] What a title. Is your life worthy
[1:53:27] of the gospel? So the title itself
[1:53:31] conveys to us this title is not for
[1:53:33] sinners, but it's for people professing
[1:53:37] Christianity.
[1:53:39] people professing
[1:53:41] they are disciples.
[1:53:43] Lord Jesus, like Peter, I admit to you
[1:53:46] today, I need more growth, more maturity
[1:53:50] in my life.
[1:53:52] By the time Paul rebukes Peter, he had
[1:53:55] already had supernatural miracles.
[1:53:57] Phenomenal, phenomenal things you had
[1:54:00] done through the man, but he was still
[1:54:03] lacking in its character.
[1:54:06] It's easy to see, Lord, some of the
[1:54:08] emphasis that we've gone and the
[1:54:09] direction we've taken the last few
[1:54:11] years, it's more on the supernatural,
[1:54:14] so-called.
[1:54:18] And yet, for those who might differ with
[1:54:21] some of those, it's going in that
[1:54:23] direction, if you don't go along with
[1:54:25] them, they write you off
[1:54:28] and you're dead, and you don't believe
[1:54:29] in a move of God no more. and they cut
[1:54:32] you off, have no more fellowship with
[1:54:34] you.
[1:54:37] So is that brotherly kindness, Lord?
[1:54:42] Is that patience?
[1:54:45] So it shows once again the same devil
[1:54:48] that's moved down through the ages is
[1:54:51] moving right among us.
[1:54:55] It's easy to see why we're not already
[1:54:57] gone. Father,
[1:55:00] help us today. Lord,
[1:55:03] forgive me Jesus
[1:55:06] of any shortcomings, any faults, any
[1:55:08] flaws.
[1:55:10] Help me, Lord, that I can grow and grow
[1:55:14] into that stature
[1:55:17] above perfect man.
[1:55:20] I'm so glad with you that every day
[1:55:25] is a new beginning.
[1:55:28] I'm so glad that our failures of
[1:55:30] yesterday and last week are not what
[1:55:33] will dictate our future.
[1:55:37] For every morning, your mercies
[1:55:41] are renewed.
[1:55:45] Oh, we love you, Jesus, with all of our
[1:55:48] hearts. Anybody
[1:55:50] here can just raise your hand and say,
[1:55:52] "Lord, be mindful of me today."
[1:55:57] Maybe you look at the map of where you
[1:55:58] are and you look at the image that I've
[1:56:00] put before you today and said, "Boy, I
[1:56:03] got some growing to do.
[1:56:06] I need some more changing in my life."
[1:56:09] You ought to be so happy that you can
[1:56:12] recognize it. Think of it, friend. We're
[1:56:14] living in a time when millions of people
[1:56:16] are walking on the earth with reprobate
[1:56:19] minds.
[1:56:21] They no longer know right from wrong.
[1:56:25] You could put right before them and they
[1:56:28] wouldn't even recognize it. So you're
[1:56:31] blessed even have a thirst, a desire.
[1:56:34] You're blessed to stand right here this
[1:56:36] morning and raise your hand and say,
[1:56:38] "Lord, remember me. Remember me,
[1:56:43] Lord Jesus. Don't let us leave this
[1:56:45] world
[1:56:47] until the requirements of God have been
[1:56:50] met in our life. For we know this is not
[1:56:53] the end of us.
[1:56:56] We know, Lord, there's a resurrection
[1:56:57] coming. In order to be in that
[1:56:59] resurrection, we must be included in the
[1:57:01] body. And we know this is why Luther
[1:57:04] could not raise on their own. The
[1:57:07] Methodist age could not raise on its own
[1:57:10] because they were lacking so many
[1:57:12] things. They without us cannot be made
[1:57:17] perfect.
[1:57:19] But Lord, you're going to complete a
[1:57:21] body on the earth. I don't know how many
[1:57:24] there will be, but it will be enough.
[1:57:27] Praise God. And whenever they reach that
[1:57:29] state of maturity, the resurrection will
[1:57:32] take place
[1:57:34] and you will have capped off the entire
[1:57:38] church ages
[1:57:40] as the fullness of the baptism of the
[1:57:42] Holy Ghost comes at the very top.
[1:57:47] Then Lord, it will cap off the ages
[1:57:51] Lord. And we know,
[1:57:53] oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:56] The re the dynamics of this church will
[1:57:59] be a refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:03] Lucer had a portion of the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:05] Wesley had a portion of the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:07] Pentecost had a portion.
[1:58:10] But this is the evening time for the
[1:58:12] token,
[1:58:14] the fullness, the attribute of the
[1:58:16] fullness of God to return back on the
[1:58:18] earth again in the last days to cause a
[1:58:21] resurrection.
[1:58:23] Oh Jesus, don't let it one of us walk
[1:58:25] out of here today. Men, women, boys,
[1:58:27] girls, may we search our hearts. We've
[1:58:29] been in the message for 40 years, 50
[1:58:31] years, however long it's been.
[1:58:34] May we open our lives before you today.
[1:58:36] Search us, oh Lord God.
[1:58:40] Search me, Jesus.
[1:58:43] Put me up on the scale of your word, my
[1:58:45] father.
[1:58:47] May I not compare myself to a Baptist
[1:58:49] preacher. May I not compare myself to a
[1:58:53] Catholic priest or the pope,
[1:58:57] cuz comparing me to them, it would
[1:58:59] certainly make me look better as far as
[1:59:01] scripture by scripture.
[1:59:04] But I don't want to compare me to them.
[1:59:06] That's not the image I have before me.
[1:59:09] The image I have before me is you.
[1:59:13] So every time I look at you and I look
[1:59:16] at me,
[1:59:18] I see so much wrong
[1:59:20] and so much flaws.
[1:59:24] Oh Jesus, anoint my eyes with your eyes.
[1:59:26] I have
[1:59:28] help me to get the proper balance of my
[1:59:30] sight spiritually
[1:59:32] to see the work and progress is divine.
[1:59:35] But the human element is still human and
[1:59:37] will never be perfect.
[1:59:40] Would you come through this building
[1:59:41] today, Father, and anoint our eyes?
[1:59:44] What's your eyes of recognition?
[1:59:47] Your eyes sav
[1:59:49] understanding for we could open our eyes
[1:59:51] and see something and say, "I see it,
[1:59:53] but I don't understand it." It's because
[1:59:56] the way we're perceiving it. Anoint us
[1:59:58] today, Father.
[2:00:00] Oh, hallelujah, Lord Jesus.
[2:00:03] We worship you today, Father.
[2:00:06] Mold us, Lord. Shape us, oh God, into
[2:00:10] that which pleases you.
[2:00:14] Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:16] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:00:19] Can we just worship him a little bit
[2:00:21] now? How many believes with me now? This
[2:00:25] is the promise of God. This is the word
[2:00:27] of God. And we by God's grace are going
[2:00:31] to come to that promise.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; He can only do for us in heaven as we
[2:00:38] confess that he's doing it on earth. And
[2:00:41] I'm going to confess it this morning.
[2:00:44] Every elect member
[2:00:48] and our church, not only ours, but the
[2:00:51] churches all around the world will
[2:00:54] attain
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; to this image out here. Amen.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; And Word of Life Church said,
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; And I just happen to believe I'm one of
[2:01:05] them.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Do you believe you are?
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; And what you going to believe? You're
[2:01:09] going to believe your shortcomings and
[2:01:10] your faults, or you going to believe
[2:01:12] that you're identified with a promised
[2:01:14] word
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; for this hour?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; We're there and sing something. Let's
[2:01:18] worship him together a little bit, can
[2:01:19] we?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you appreciate the Lord today?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:01:26] We love you, Jesus. Let him pour a
[2:01:28] little bit of oil and wine now and kind
[2:01:30] of minister to us a little bit before we
[2:01:32] go. We worship you, Jesus. Remember
[2:01:35] brother Wayne Lawson and myself this
[2:01:37] week, Brother Joe Green's meeting starts
[2:01:40] on on Tuesday. Brother Wayne Tuesday,
[2:01:42] myself Wednesday, Brother Wayne
[2:01:44] Thursday, myself Friday, then I'll be
[2:01:46] back with you on Sunday, Lord willing.
[2:01:48] But remember in the meetings there,
[2:01:50] missionary meetings. So there'll be lots
[2:01:52] of brothers from overseas, all different
[2:01:54] parts of the world would certainly
[2:01:55] appreciate your prayers. Let's just
[2:01:57] worship the Lord a little bit now before
[2:01:59] we go.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I need more
[2:02:04] of
[2:02:06] you.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, we do. Jesus,
[2:02:09] everybody now,
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; that's the way it's got to be.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Make it a prayer to the Lord Jesus this
[2:02:16] morning. I need more
[2:02:19] of
[2:02:21] you.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; More of you, Jesus.
[2:02:23] [Music]
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Till there's no room left in me.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; All those wasted
[2:02:36] hours and minutes.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; They're yours now.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yours now.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; From the start to the finish.
[2:02:46] I need more.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; I need more of
[2:02:51] you.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Everybody now with all your
[2:02:55] hearts for there is. Sing it with all
[2:02:57] your heart.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; I need more

[2:03:04] more temperance, more patience, more
[2:03:06] godliness, more brotherly kindness. the
[2:03:08] way it's got for the capstone.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; I need more
[2:03:16] of
[2:03:18] you
[2:03:19] just for Jesus
[2:03:22] till there's no room left in me.
[2:03:28] Hallelujah. All those wasted
[2:03:32] hours
[2:03:34] and minutes,
[2:03:37] they're yours now. From the start to the
[2:03:41] finish. I need more

[2:03:47] you.

[2:03:57] of
[2:03:59] you.
[2:04:01] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:04:03] That's the way it's got to be.
[2:04:09] I need more
[2:04:12] of
[2:04:14] you
[2:04:18] till there's no room left in me.
[2:04:25] Oh, all those wasted

[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yours now from the start to the finish.

[2:04:55] you.
[2:05:00] That's the way it's got to be.
[2:05:05] I need more

[2:05:10] you

[2:06:06] you

[2:06:29] finish, I need more
[2:06:33] of
[2:06:35] you.
[2:06:37] [Music]
[2:06:39] Our sister's a teacher at school and I
[2:06:41] know we have some more teachers in in
[2:06:43] our church as well. If you'd like to
[2:06:44] come up and we'll pray for you all as
[2:06:46] well. Um, I I've talked to some of these
[2:06:50] teachers and they've told me some of the
[2:06:52] things that they have to deal with and
[2:06:54] they have to hear and even with such
[2:06:57] small children, it's it's just
[2:06:59] unbelievable the age that we're in right
[2:07:01] now and what they're going through.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; So, it puts them in a real a real
[2:07:05] difficult spot. I want you to think
[2:07:08] about it. Most of those kids at school
[2:07:11] will never see me. They'll never see the
[2:07:14] rest of these preachers.
[2:07:16] This might be the only Jesus.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's true, brother.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; That they see
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; and they have to be so careful in what
[2:07:23] they say and how they say it. We're not
[2:07:25] living in the same America it was when
[2:07:28] some of you all went to school
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; where the teachers could say this and
[2:07:31] that. But Justin, God bless you, buddy.
[2:07:34] Glad to have you all back home.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:41] Dear God.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:44] Oh lamb of God.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; as these sisters and this brother stand
[2:07:52] before you today, Lord,
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; I cannot imagine what all they see and
[2:07:57] what all they hear and what all they
[2:07:59] have to deal with, Lord.
[2:08:02] Lord God, I pray for strength for them.
[2:08:04] And I pray that you'd help them, Lord.
[2:08:07] They can't really preach to the kids as
[2:08:10] we'd say and forbidden to say so much
[2:08:12] anymore. But I'm asking you, Lord, that
[2:08:15] should be with them. Lord God, how many
[2:08:18] of these kids Lord don't know hardly
[2:08:21] anything
[2:08:22] Lord having le having worked with it a
[2:08:25] little bit, being a teacher's aid and
[2:08:26] some of the things that she had tell us
[2:08:28] is just heartbreaking. Lord, I pray the
[2:08:31] spirit of God would be with them. Lord,
[2:08:33] may they see Jesus.
[2:08:35] May they see Jesus be lifted up.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; May they know that there's a difference
[2:08:39] in the lives of these children, of these
[2:08:42] teachers rather. May the spirit of God
[2:08:45] help them. Lord, may they be a light.
[2:08:48] May they see Jesus through them. May
[2:08:50] they be able to recognize that there is
[2:08:52] a better life than maybe their mom and
[2:08:54] their daddy are trying to offer them.
[2:08:57] Father, would you be with them? Give
[2:08:58] them strength. Lord, you told us, "Let
[2:09:00] your light so shine before men that they
[2:09:04] may see your good works and glorify your
[2:09:06] father which is in heaven." I pray for
[2:09:08] them today. Lord God, in the name of
[2:09:10] Jesus, may the spirit of God anoint
[2:09:12] them. Give them strength. Give them
[2:09:15] wisdom. Help them. Father, I pray
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:22] God bless y'all each of you.
[2:09:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:09:32] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:09:39] Fall just like the rain.
[2:09:42] [Music]
[2:09:45] Our sisters wanting us to pray for these
[2:09:47] children. Maybe maybe all of you
[2:09:50] children that go to school, if you'd
[2:09:51] like to come up and gather around here,
[2:09:52] we'll pray for you all as well. Maybe
[2:09:54] our school starts at different times.
[2:09:56] maybe in a week or so or two weeks or
[2:09:58] whatever. But if you'd like to come,
[2:10:00] we'll be glad to pray for each of you,
[2:10:02] too. We'll wait on you. So, I'm coming
[2:10:03] up out of the mezzanine there.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; I know what it was like whenever I was a
[2:10:10] Christian going to school and laughed at
[2:10:12] and made fun of. And I can imagine it is
[2:10:16] so small compared to what our kids have
[2:10:19] to deal with in this day.
[2:10:21] But the question comes back is, is our
[2:10:24] Jesus capable of helping them?
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, parents?
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; This is what we preach to them and teach
[2:10:30] to them.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Some of our kids attend, of course, some
[2:10:40] of the Christian schools around here,
[2:10:42] and we're we're thankful that they can
[2:10:44] be able to do that. And I've been to
[2:10:45] some of the different things the kids go
[2:10:48] to and there's definitely a difference
[2:10:49] in in them in the public school, but
[2:10:52] they also still need help and prayer.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Anyone else before we pray?
[2:11:00] Amen.
[2:11:02] No doubt there's children that have
[2:11:04] streamed today and
[2:11:06] your mamas and daddies gather, your
[2:11:08] little children around your computer
[2:11:09] there, your phone, whatever it is.
[2:11:13] Can we just pray together for them,
[2:11:14] church?
[2:11:17] Dear God, these poor little sheep,
[2:11:21] these little lambs.
[2:11:24] Dear God, we pray for them today. Father
[2:11:28] in the name of Jesus, that you'd help
[2:11:30] them and be with them.
[2:11:33] Lord, we know that we can teach them and
[2:11:35] try to rear them and bring them up in
[2:11:36] the right way.
[2:11:38] Yet we also know, Father, that we can't
[2:11:41] isolate them totally and keep them from
[2:11:43] the world. So we seek the balance of
[2:11:45] trying to in the years of their
[2:11:48] education know how much to expose them
[2:11:51] to, Lord. And I feel each each set of
[2:11:55] parents has to deal with that
[2:11:56] individually, how they should do their
[2:11:58] children.
[2:11:59] So God, I pray for every one of them
[2:12:01] today. Some of them homeschool, some of
[2:12:03] them going to the Christian schools that
[2:12:06] are around here, Lord. And for many of
[2:12:08] them, I've I've had to sign and validate
[2:12:11] a form for them that they attend church
[2:12:13] and any recommendation or drawback that
[2:12:16] I would have about their children. And
[2:12:18] it always does my heart good when I'm
[2:12:21] I'm able to send out that form and send
[2:12:24] them back and say, "I know this family
[2:12:26] and they've been in our church for x
[2:12:28] amount of years and they're good people.
[2:12:31] They love God and I can stand and vouch
[2:12:34] for their character." Oh Lord, it's one
[2:12:37] of the honors of my life to be able to
[2:12:39] do that now. Lord, their little children
[2:12:42] are standing here in a week or so.
[2:12:44] They'll be going back out into this,
[2:12:47] Lord God, into this school system. And I
[2:12:51] pray that you'd have mercy on them,
[2:12:53] Father, for those who choose to
[2:12:55] homeschool their children. I pray, Lord,
[2:12:57] that you'd be with them. Most of the
[2:12:59] times falls to the to the ability of the
[2:13:02] mothers, and I ask you for them for
[2:13:04] strength and help, Lord. And we pray,
[2:13:06] Father, for those going to the Christian
[2:13:08] schools that are around. And we're
[2:13:10] grateful, Lord, because I know in
[2:13:12] dealing with some of them, Father, that
[2:13:13] they do try to maintain somewhat of a
[2:13:15] standard. Father, would you be with
[2:13:18] them? Would you help the children, Lord
[2:13:20] God? Oh Lord, they may be offered things
[2:13:23] like this and that that they're not used
[2:13:25] to and words that they wouldn't say or
[2:13:27] whatever, but may the teachings of mama
[2:13:30] and the teachings of daddy and their
[2:13:32] Sunday school teacher, Lord, may it be
[2:13:34] there in them. Lord, would you keep our
[2:13:36] children? Father, Lord,
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; if you would, Terry, Father, this might
[2:13:40] be the evangelist of the message in the
[2:13:42] future and pastor's wives and deacons
[2:13:45] wives and little deacons standing here
[2:13:47] today. Lord, we don't know what they
[2:13:49] are, but we pray you'd watch over them
[2:13:51] and keep them. Father, help their
[2:13:53] parents to be sensitive when they come
[2:13:55] home at night to be able to pick up on
[2:13:57] anything that they're dealing with.
[2:13:59] Lord, bless them. I pray father in the
[2:14:02] name of Jesus we ask.
[2:14:05] Amen.
[2:14:07] God bless y'all. I love every one of you
[2:14:09] so much.
[2:14:11] Can we give him a hand today? Praise the
[2:14:14] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:14:19] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't get to it today, but I'll pick
[2:14:27] it up maybe next time.
[2:14:30] But Jesus
[2:14:32] asked his disciples in the book of Mark,
[2:14:35] "How is it
[2:14:38] that you were in a dispute along the
[2:14:40] way?"
[2:14:43] But they didn't answer him a word.
[2:14:46] So what had happened was they got into a
[2:14:48] debate about who was going to be the
[2:14:50] greatest in the kingdom.
[2:14:54] But Jesus has just told them he's fixing
[2:14:56] to die. And this is what they're
[2:14:58] concerned about.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; You see, he also has to have patience
[2:15:02] with us.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; So to prove his point, he called up a
[2:15:07] little child
[2:15:09] and it said, "Except you become
[2:15:12] converted and as humble as this little
[2:15:15] child, you'll no wise enter into the
[2:15:18] kingdom of heaven."
[2:15:20] What a lesson to preachers.
[2:15:24] Amen.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; So to get a message across to preachers,
[2:15:28] he uses a child.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Has it been good to be in
[2:15:33] the house of the Lord today?
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:42] Let's just bow our heads together.
[2:15:45] Lord Jesus, thank you for another
[2:15:47] Sunday.
[2:15:49] Just in a few moments now, it'll go in
[2:15:51] the book of the records.
[2:15:54] I'll have to stand before you that day
[2:15:56] and answer for what I've preached today.
[2:16:00] But they will have to answer for their
[2:16:02] attitude toward it.
[2:16:04] And we'll all have to answer for our
[2:16:06] attitude of how we apply it. Or do we
[2:16:09] let it go in one ear and out the other
[2:16:10] as we say?
[2:16:12] But may we be like James said that we're
[2:16:14] not just hearers of the word and he
[2:16:17] called them forgetful hearers, but may
[2:16:20] we be hearers that will apply to our
[2:16:21] lives.
[2:16:23] go with us today, Father. Keep us by
[2:16:25] your grace, Lord. You see the meetings
[2:16:27] coming up this week, and I pray that
[2:16:28] you'd be mindful of us there, Lord. And
[2:16:31] help us meet with us in a in a great
[2:16:33] way, Lord, in your presence. Dear Jesus,
[2:16:36] watch over my sheep. Keep them, Lord.
[2:16:38] They're not really mine. They're just
[2:16:40] yours that you've allowed to meet to be
[2:16:42] an undersheperd.
[2:16:44] Lord, you see those that are sick and
[2:16:46] needy. Father, Brother Steve Newsome
[2:16:48] really having a a hard time, Lord, and
[2:16:51] in the hospital. Lord Jesus, you see
[2:16:54] where he's at. Dear God, I pray that
[2:16:56] you'd be with our brother. Father,
[2:16:59] Sister Patty Cooper, Lord, you see, dear
[2:17:01] God, our sister and her needs, others,
[2:17:03] Father, with great needs in their lives.
[2:17:05] And we just ask that you'd be mindful of
[2:17:08] your children today. Go with us, Lord,
[2:17:11] through these great trials of our life.
[2:17:13] You're trying to bring us to that
[2:17:15] completed stage of patience. And so be
[2:17:18] it. May we not falsely accuse you or
[2:17:21] charge you, Lord. But may we at the end
[2:17:23] of the trial be faithful. God, go with
[2:17:26] your children now, Father. I pray as we
[2:17:28] dismiss from this place, let not be
[2:17:31] dismissed from your presence. In the
[2:17:33] name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. I love
[2:17:36] you, saints.
