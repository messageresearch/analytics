[27:45] whether we could see it out yonder and
[27:48] we had a good glimpse of it all how it's
[27:50] really gonna be and you could see
[27:51] yourself in a glorified body and you
[27:55] actually caught a glimpse of yourself
[27:57] walking down the streets of gold you see
[27:59] that was our trials and troubles
[28:04] everyone same nears heart of the day so
[28:08] more than likely we probably won't see
[28:10] that while we're in this life but we
[28:13] have faith that we're going to be happy
[28:17] amen the man we've been looking at job
[28:20] for a few weeks if he would have been
[28:21] able to sing

[28:31] everything he heads and I have double
[28:33] his kids he's gonna have all these
[28:34] things that's going to go on double gold
[28:36] double camels I mean there ain't no
[28:38] investment company they can do that for
[28:39] you so God's will actually multiply
[28:42] everything you've had your family's
[28:43] going to come back your friends that's
[28:44] going to come back the sabaeans is going
[28:46] to return everything they've took from
[28:47] you actually and they're gonna bring
[28:49] more back to you if you could see that
[28:51] when you're at pure when God said look
[28:53] you're fixing to go through a test but
[28:54] this is gonna be the outcome fine no
[28:56] problem all this let's get it on Lord
[28:59] let's get her down but he didn't know
[29:02] that he didn't know that now we believe
[29:05] tonight we're gonna be there but if any
[29:10] of you ever by vision seen your name in
[29:13] the Lamb's Book of Life when you ever by
[29:18] vision by reality not just by dream now
[29:21] but by vision which is tangible
[29:23] substance from the fourth dimension
[29:25] seeing yourself and it's the Alpha new
[29:27] body or a glorified body or yourself
[29:30] walking down streets of go well praise
[29:34] the Lord
[29:35] but how many believes you're gonna be
[29:40] there ah so this is why our journey is
[29:45] so affected the things that are around
[29:48] us because we are a believing people and
[29:54] we do believe well I guess when go home
[30:00] now that was my sermon transform in five
[30:05] minutes I preached everything in this
[30:08] turn tonight if I got a little more you
[30:10] think of it all right joke chapter 40
[30:14] verse 1 they said brother Louie was
[30:17] right or not he said I had a little bit
[30:20] more to say so this same job chapter 40
[30:27] verse 1
[30:29] remember our sermon title is still the
[30:31] same what is thy beloved more than
[30:36] another what makes him so outstanding so
[30:40] different I realize the attributes that
[30:42] we're looking at especially in the last
[30:44] couple of weeks and tonight and tomorrow
[30:47] Lord willing it's attributes that people
[30:49] may not necessarily want to really love
[30:53] about God and that they may not consider
[30:56] great but God this God considers them
[31:00] great if God considers things great and
[31:02] I want to consider them great whether I
[31:05] understand them as being great or not
[31:06] because if he says they're great they're
[31:09] great if he's theirs or nothing then
[31:11] they're nothing and I want to think the
[31:13] same way job chapter 40 verse 1 more of
[31:16] the Lord answered joven said shall he
[31:19] that contended worthy all mighty
[31:20] instruct him he that reproveth God let
[31:26] him answer it then job answered the Lord
[31:30] and said behold I am vile which is
[31:35] nothingness I'm little I'm small
[31:43] he ain't down there yet he still thinks
[31:46] he's something
[31:48] what shall I answer they are not honed
[31:53] upon no no in other words I'll stop
[31:57] saying the foolish gibberish that I have
[32:00] said but I'm still not willing to repent
[32:06] the old I'm Val what shall answer thee I
[32:09] will lay my hands upon my mouth once
[32:13] have I spoken but I will not answer yay
[32:17] twice that I will proceed no further but
[32:23] he didn't say he would stop thinking it
[32:30] he just said he would stop saying it but
[32:34] you see God goes beyond even what we say
[32:36] and looks inside of our hearts and say
[32:40] if we're still thinking the same stuff
[32:42] about him hey let's let's pray together
[32:46] shall we
[32:47] Lord Jesus we love you so much tonight
[32:50] and all of your great ment majestic
[32:53] wonder father the universe all the
[32:56] things which you've created and done oh
[32:59] I believe much of it no doubt was done
[33:02] for the very fact you did it because you
[33:05] could prove that you could do it the
[33:08] more we look about and see the things
[33:10] father that you have done and most of
[33:14] humanity many of the things with nature
[33:17] and the laws of God most of humanity
[33:21] will live their life and never even know
[33:23] they exist
[33:26] most of man will live his life and be so
[33:30] ignorant of so many things which you've
[33:32] done upon the Earth's so you didn't do
[33:35] it just necessarily for man to behold it
[33:38] you didn't do it so man would look at it
[33:41] and marvel you did it to prove your
[33:44] greatness so you would be able to enjoy
[33:46] it I pray to not father you would take
[33:50] your word speak to us once again would
[33:52] you Lord Jesus
[33:53] we
[33:54] I'm here tonight as needy people we say
[33:56] that often but Lord we want you to know
[34:00] that we believe tonight
[34:01] your power is much greater than all of
[34:04] our needs so we bring our needs before
[34:07] you and we by faith believes that you
[34:10] will speak to us tonight as you always
[34:12] do in Jesus name and the Saints said god
[34:16] bless you may be seated you ever thought
[34:20] about how many things that God has done
[34:22] how many creatures that he's made how
[34:26] many things that he's placed upon the
[34:28] earth and you will live your threescore
[34:31] and ten or 55 or 35 or 85 and you won't
[34:37] even know one hundredth of one percent
[34:39] of what God has ever done how many of
[34:44] you know high for the species of trees
[34:46] that's on the earth how many of you know
[34:49] how many species of butterflies they are
[34:54] praise the Lord and they notice how many
[34:57] species of flowers kinds of rocks and he
[35:05] all ever seemed a little worm that lives
[35:08] on the jungle floor which has green
[35:12] lights going down his side and comes
[35:15] down he's back on this like led and on
[35:19] his head he has a little red light he is
[35:23] a millipede eater so when he gets close
[35:27] to the millipede he switches off his
[35:31] little green lights because the
[35:35] millipede can't see red oh my goodness
[35:41] you brilliant intelligent intellectual
[35:44] people and none of you ever heard of
[35:46] such a thing
[35:48] face it we're a bunch of ignorant
[35:52] when it comes to the greatness of God
[35:54] friends we haven't even scratched the
[35:57] surface of what God is I'm just glad to
[36:02] let me be saved I know I'm an ignoramus
[36:06] they're suing me and some of you is I
[36:08] know I'm an idiot and some of you think
[36:10] you're brilliant you're worse idiot than
[36:12] I am because you're an idiot too but
[36:15] you're an idiot on a lower level because
[36:16] you won't admit that you are you won't
[36:19] admit that you need such help and you
[36:21] want to try to impress the rest of us by
[36:24] big words that you say big things that
[36:27] you do and let on like you know so much
[36:29] about God why don't you just come on
[36:32] down to the same dirtbag level as all
[36:34] the rest of us and realize if it wasn't
[36:36] for the grace of God you'd be out there
[36:39] tonight as lost as loss could be you'd
[36:42] be out there running around with
[36:44] somebody else's husband or somebody
[36:45] else's wife or drinking or smoking or
[36:48] whatever more but the grace of God has
[36:51] allowed you to sit in the house of God
[36:54] and be saved and filled with the Holy
[36:57] Ghost you know Joel had a great a great
[37:01] understanding about God we don't want to
[37:03] take anything away from Jill but as we
[37:06] will look at it as we go into chapter 42
[37:09] Jobe admits that much of what he had
[37:11] learned about God was through a
[37:13] transitionary source that it was a
[37:15] source that was very very limited in its
[37:18] ability to be able to teach him and job
[37:21] has now come to this part in chapter 42
[37:24] where that he's able to admit that he is
[37:26] small that it's not as big as God and he
[37:29] doesn't have as much great understanding
[37:32] of God but he still is into that state
[37:34] of repentance I'll tell you friend I
[37:36] believe that for many many people in the
[37:39] age that were living once we get to a
[37:41] place that we cannot repent and ask God
[37:44] to forgive us and asked one another to
[37:46] forgive us we're in a terrible spot the
[37:49] zeal of this hour
[37:51] is to repent and if you and I get to a
[37:54] spot that we cannot repent when we are
[37:57] wrong not only when we're wrong as far
[37:59] as doing things of the world or whenever
[38:02] were shown that we
[38:03] and doctrine are shown that we're wrong
[38:05] because we've listened to something and
[38:07] called it God and then someone proved to
[38:10] us that voice that told us that was a
[38:12] liar and we cannot repent of that we are
[38:15] in danger of hail because you are that
[38:18] close to listening to a deceiving spirit
[38:21] that you are calling the Holy Ghost now
[38:25] a real sign of God is going to make
[38:27] mistakes and the church said there's
[38:30] going to be times we are going to be
[38:32] certain that we are led of God and it's
[38:35] going to prove we were led by the devil
[38:38] there's going to be times we are gonna
[38:40] feel so impressed that it's the Lord
[38:44] that told me to do this and the Lord
[38:46] said do this and that and the other and
[38:48] the facts itself approve out it was not
[38:51] God at all and this is what makes our
[38:54] beloved so wonderful and that he is just
[38:57] he is righteous he is pure he will not
[39:01] let his children get by when they do
[39:04] wrong or when they believe wrong or
[39:07] listen to wrong he wants him to be
[39:10] straight and that's because He loves us
[39:13] you see the devil is the type of master
[39:16] and the type of God that loves for his
[39:20] children to be deceived he lies for
[39:23] babies to be born blind
[39:26] he loves four men to divorce their wives
[39:29] he lost four people to commit adultery
[39:32] he lies for people to get on Facebook
[39:35] and on their phones and texts and so on
[39:38] and cause trouble and cause gossip in a
[39:41] family he loves for trouble to be born
[39:44] and an atmosphere of deceit alot that's
[39:47] the kind of person that he is this is
[39:50] the kind of God and I do say God because
[39:52] He is God of this evil age but he's a
[39:55] puny God because he ain't got no power
[39:58] to create I said he's a puny God he
[40:01] cannot offer you heaven he cannot heal
[40:04] you and you can sit he cannot raise you
[40:07] up when you get down
[40:08] he cannot deliver you from the power of
[40:11] darkness that's a kind of golf that is
[40:13] he's a liar he's a hypocrite he's
[40:17] two-faced well praise the Lord I figured
[40:22] y'all be shy I'm told that you're head
[40:23] of it now that's the kind of being that
[40:26] is but my beloved is not like that Satan
[40:31] will let his bride get Bible doing
[40:33] anything she wants to do she can live
[40:36] any way she wants to live and then go to
[40:38] church on Sunday and do her religion and
[40:41] her husband loves her for it and she
[40:44] loves him for letting her do it I mean
[40:46] they are madly in love they love one
[40:49] another so much they give their body
[40:53] their soul their mind their spirit they
[40:56] will sell their children to the devil
[40:58] husband's will sell their wives wives
[41:01] will give up their husband they will
[41:03] give everything to the devil come on now
[41:06] and we growl and grumble if the Lord ask
[41:09] us to give up this and that and the
[41:11] other on line the world serves their God
[41:14] they a my my they love him they love him
[41:18] more than heaven they love him more than
[41:21] Jesus they love him more than salvation
[41:24] if they didn't they'd come to God and
[41:27] what's he gonna do take the whole sign
[41:30] right down to the lake of fire that's
[41:33] right but that's not my beloved my
[41:36] beloved is so particular the devil will
[41:39] live in anybody the devil will even go
[41:42] to stoop so low that he will live in
[41:46] animals in order to carry out his will
[41:49] the devil will live in a Hulk that tells
[41:52] you a lot about the devil
[41:54] the devil will live in anybody on
[41:57] what they do how they talk how they did
[42:01] that's the kind of being he is but my
[42:04] husband is very picky who he lives him
[42:07] my husband is very very picky who he
[42:11] calls as his home he's very very picky
[42:15] as far as who he calls as his elect and
[42:18] his bride he will not let a two-faced
[42:22] liar and a hypocrite he will not live in
[42:24] them I don't care how much they think he
[42:26] does he will not live in a troublemaker
[42:29] God hates that sort of thing but the
[42:31] devil loves all those that oh my but my
[42:34] beloved is very very particular the
[42:38] devil is a hypocrite he has an impostor
[42:41] he is a liar he is a fabricator of
[42:45] untruths he is a promoter of sayings
[42:48] that are contrary to the Word of God he
[42:50] is an absolute liar from the beginning
[42:52] he is a murderer he is deceived and a
[42:56] deceiver but my beloved is the fountain
[43:00] of truth he is the truth he is the way
[43:03] he is the life he sells shoddy I used to
[43:06] hold Ajara he saw us along he's a healer
[43:10] come on church he's a heart mender
[43:12] he's a universe creator he's a New
[43:15] Jerusalem maker he's a new life changer
[43:18] praise be to God he is a regenerator
[43:22] that's how my beloved is notice this he
[43:29] is just let's look at this now for a few
[43:31] months before we get over to Joe I said
[43:33] chapter 45 verse 21 tell you and bring
[43:36] them near yeh let them take counsel
[43:38] together who has declared this from
[43:41] ancient time they're told it from that
[43:43] time I've not I the Lord and there is no
[43:47] God so for those of you who believe in
[43:57] more than one this is the man that's in
[44:00] the throne himself and he looked around
[44:03] and said there ain't nobody beside me
[44:06] on either side there is no one home ah
[44:12] there is no god else beside me a just
[44:18] God and a savior there is none beside me
[44:25] that's my beloved he's not one of threes
[44:28] not two of three he's all three in one
[44:30] look at the words yes it is lawful
[44:33] righteous righteous and government
[44:35] righteous and conduct and character
[44:37] right correct and lawful so you believe
[44:40] with me tonight that I believe it is
[44:43] just even when he allows us to go
[44:46] through trials and things that we do not
[44:48] understand you see job is not having a
[44:50] question about God in that can God
[44:53] control the ostrich and God control the
[44:55] stars and God control the solar over to
[44:57] the moon and God placing a position and
[44:59] God doing many of these things that is
[45:01] not job's major problem job's major
[45:04] problem is trying to understand why God
[45:07] would allow the wicked to prosper and
[45:10] God would allow the righteous that love
[45:13] him with all of the heart to lose
[45:15] basically everything they got and
[45:17] struggled a lot job as a rich man he did
[45:20] not hear the conversation in heaven
[45:22] between God and the devil and job is now
[45:24] looking he looks over at the center god
[45:26] this guy may be him no no telling what
[45:28] he's done to get his living he's lied
[45:30] he's robbed he stole he's cheated job as
[45:33] a man of honesty and integrity he had
[45:35] tried to do everything on fries and
[45:37] jocose everything is that his wife even
[45:40] moves out of the house his wife leaves
[45:42] him his servants leave him his brothers
[45:46] and his sisters he don't even get a
[45:48] friendly text from his sisters to check
[45:50] on how he's doing they show up a tree
[45:53] he's healed I've got a few friends out
[45:55] there Oh nobody even comes to the house
[45:58] his settlements are gone there's nobody
[46:00] there Joe beckons and nobody comes they
[46:03] I've got him he's stinking he's satting
[46:05] outside oh my is a rotten mess and jokes
[46:08] that I just don't understand that how
[46:10] can you say you are just how can you say
[46:13] you are holy and righteous and pure I've
[46:16] done nothing to deserve this
[46:18] I've done nothing to bring this Ummah
[46:20] now this is where these three friends
[46:21] accuse him remember they said you've
[46:23] sinned and you've done wrong and God is
[46:25] punishing you say I've not done it I've
[46:28] had a just sacrifice before God and this
[46:31] is something friends that you and I may
[46:32] struggle with from time to time herself
[46:34] is to kill still keep this in our mind
[46:37] God is perfect God is just
[46:40] God is righteous even when things happen
[46:43] that we don't understand even when loved
[46:45] ones pass on and we pray everyday that
[46:48] God will move for them and he simply
[46:51] refuses to answer us you believe he's
[46:55] just for the rest of you believe you
[46:58] believe it's just notice definite
[47:02] chapter 3 verse 5 the just Lord is in
[47:06] the midst thereof he will not do
[47:08] iniquity every morning does he bring the
[47:11] judgment to light he fayliss not but the
[47:14] unjust knowest no shame revelation 15 3
[47:18] and they sing the song of Moses the
[47:20] servant of God and the servant of lamb
[47:22] saying great and marvellous are thy
[47:24] works Lord God Almighty notice they
[47:27] don't say Lord God Almighty
[47:29] there's only one Lord God Almighty he's
[47:32] here my name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:33] just and true are thy ways thou king of
[47:41] saints so he is just but job is
[47:45] struggling with the Justice of God David
[47:48] said the wicked spring forth as a green
[47:51] bay tree why is it God that he said I'm
[47:54] so hated I'm so persecuted my enemies
[47:57] come against me they stomp me Lord on
[48:00] every side
[48:00] everywhere I turn there against me yet
[48:03] look at this wicked man look at that
[48:05] wicked man look at that one it seems
[48:07] like nothing happens to their they don't
[48:09] pray they don't read their Bible and
[48:12] they are so blessed they have so much
[48:15] stuff and they have such peace are you
[48:18] sure they do remember the law these land
[48:23] of sins or hypocrite actors oh they can
[48:26] tell you how much they got and how good
[48:28] their business is doing how do you know
[48:30] what's going down down inside that soul
[48:32] when they lay down at night when you lay
[48:34] there you may not have the money to pay
[48:35] your bills but at least you got peace
[48:37] with God they lay down or not oh god
[48:40] what happened to me a Fido you say some
[48:42] of them don't think that I'm sure some
[48:43] of them don't they've sinned away their
[48:45] day of grace they've sinned so far
[48:47] there's not even a consciousness of God
[48:49] at all and yet you're laying there and
[48:51] you say oh how am i blessed you're
[48:53] blessed because you say Lord forgive me
[48:56] my sins this day forgive me lord if I've
[48:59] done anything wrong you don't identify
[49:01] that and so blessing do you understand
[49:04] how blessed you are when you lay down on
[49:07] your bed at night and you say Lord if
[49:10] I've done anything this day please
[49:12] forgive me you know you are a blessed
[49:14] human being
[49:19] anything else you pray that way he's
[49:28] just and he's righteous second
[49:32] chronicles 12 6 were upon the princess
[49:34] of Israel and the king humbled
[49:37] themselves and they said the Lord is
[49:41] righteous this is the exact same word
[49:44] that we just read English translators
[49:47] called it of course just his exact same
[49:50] meaning
[49:51] Ezra 9:15 o Lord God of Israel thou art
[49:56] righteous Psalms 11 7 for the righteous
[50:03] Lord loved us righteousness his
[50:06] countenance does behold the upright
[50:11] but in this day we have a different God
[50:16] we have a God that's a large large
[50:19] grandfather he's a big grandfather in
[50:24] heaven and for most people I was just a
[50:27] young little boy and young man setting
[50:29] her by him you know ii come in god a
[50:30] blue team in general all that sort of
[50:32] thing and he does all these other things
[50:34] that this old man this old man didn't
[50:36] want to come down and died for us so he
[50:37] sent his son to come down coward that a
[50:43] my God my God but not send some boy to
[50:47] die for me and then when he say he's the
[50:49] one who gave the penalty if God gave the
[50:52] penalty God should buy his own
[50:54] instrumentality take the penalty of his
[50:56] along
[50:57] my beloved did that condescension and
[51:03] creation of humanity called sonship of
[51:05] Jesus Christ not another God the same
[51:08] God so we got this old dhoti grandpa and
[51:18] he has all these grandkids in church now
[51:21] he knows this is the Laodicean age and
[51:23] grandpa knows that kids can't live right
[51:25] in this day so grandpa noise all the
[51:27] singers and all the preachers and
[51:29] everybody and they're just preaching
[51:31] Christ grace grace grace grace to your
[51:33] appearing grace or the way they preach
[51:36] it anyway
[51:38] what's this but I'm stuck no and this is
[51:40] the layer to see an agent or this age
[51:42] needs a sharp rebuke from God
[51:45] it needs a sharp rebuke on our clergy
[51:49] get so soft and dhoti like some aged
[51:54] grandfather to his grandchildren now I
[51:59] know I'm getting older and I know I'm
[52:01] getting slower but I ain't Dodi yet and
[52:05] I don't plan on getting Dodi neither
[52:07] praise the Lord
[52:09] now notice how he likens it now to
[52:12] grandparents huh to a grandfather
[52:16] instead of a father wonder what it is
[52:19] about a grandfather and a
[52:21] mother and their relation to
[52:24] grandchildren but one thing all three
[52:26] categories are grand grandfather
[52:30] grandmother grand show you saw what I
[52:32] love in kids the most about the homeless
[52:34] set of years ago if I don't know these
[52:35] grandkids that have been so much fun
[52:37] I've had them first
[52:38] forget them youngins so what is it
[52:42] something about that second generation
[52:44] the way like oh my oh my they didn't
[52:47] know Hong that's not true they do do
[52:49] wrong your grandkids are just not mine
[52:52] they're human they need to be born again
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:56] well I see tonight's gonna be an am
[52:59] endless night
[53:01] notice this now that is grandeur of
[53:03] grandfather to expand children ever what
[53:05] they do is perfect it's been said so
[53:08] much that God is such a good God until
[53:12] they try to make God just a big Dodie
[53:18] grandfather so if God is a big Dodie
[53:21] grandfather then God's clergy should
[53:24] also be Dodie clergy now this is why the
[53:31] clergy who have this concept of a
[53:34] grandfather God all these clergymen are
[53:38] Doty clergy but a me in my image of God
[53:45] so guess what I'm not a dirty bastard
[53:52] a man military a member the less hey man
[53:55] Happy Valley now if this is your image
[53:58] of God and this then this is the kind of
[54:00] clergymen that you should expect to come
[54:03] and preach to you because your God is a
[54:04] noted Rand Paul then your God ought to
[54:06] have a dhoti pastor a dhoti evangelist a
[54:09] dhoti teacher a dhoti prophet you see
[54:16] but he's not he is a father God is not
[54:21] my grandpa he's my daddy and everything
[54:27] I do is not perfect in his sight so
[54:30] sometimes he gives me and Kentucky
[54:32] terminology we can understand on war pay
[54:36] now for you sophisticated folks I'm
[54:38] going to show what you want to call it
[54:39] time out I guess count to three my god
[54:42] never did count on me he walked well
[54:45] there's been a few times I wish he had
[54:47] accounted you know no not really i
[54:48] brother him treat me like a son instead
[54:50] of her grandson now notice this is my
[54:55] beloved though this is who he is
[54:58] this is who I see and what I see about
[55:01] him and to me it expresses his love to
[55:04] me
[55:04] if so intimate he loves me so much he
[55:08] will not let give me give I was wrong
[55:11] if I get cold he shakes me up if I get
[55:15] indifferent he shakes me up if I get
[55:18] stopping he whoops me oh oh so I'm your
[55:27] only proud of that you mean you want to
[55:30] see which God would just let you along
[55:31] and let you smoke unless you shoot up
[55:34] and let you listen to rock and roll and
[55:36] you sisters dress out the world and God
[55:38] would treats you like he does he's
[55:39] Laodiceans you know where you're going
[55:41] tribulation God don't treat dollars that
[55:44] way God don't treat sons that way praise
[55:51] the Lord
[55:51] love is always correct if she love
[55:55] corrects no matter how bad it hurts it's
[55:59] still correct so real mother will
[56:00] correct her children a real dad will
[56:03] correct notices in paragraph four
[56:05] - then there you take a Christian that's
[56:08] supposed to be a Christian and let the
[56:10] life of God go from him and the
[56:12] experience the joy of serving Christ and
[56:16] living in a trench for such as going on
[56:19] he runs twice as quick wow they're
[56:28] laying right in the stream where water
[56:30] is now remember he gets his Simon taught
[56:33] it was down in Kentucky in a bit hunting
[56:35] down there that weak squirrel hunting
[56:37] and he jumped up on the side of a beach
[56:38] draw those would be the only thing about
[56:40] beach snow though the beach is a very
[56:41] hard wood it's not a pretty wood but
[56:43] it's a hard way so they use Beach from
[56:45] making barstools and chairs and tables
[56:47] and things like that the grain is very
[56:49] very drab so they'll put oak veneer
[56:51] walnut veneer shaven here's some type of
[56:53] veneer on top of it but the sub
[56:54] structure will be Beach because it's a
[56:57] very good hardwood very cheap wood
[56:58] doesn't sell for 100 board foot and all
[57:01] that and then some of the exotic types
[57:02] of woods there but a very good
[57:04] structurally foundationally sound wood
[57:06] so you're the profit jumped up on the
[57:08] side of this beef log which had been
[57:10] standing there for years and something
[57:11] happened to it and it died so the life
[57:13] went out of it it fell down and when he
[57:15] jumped up on the side of that beach
[57:17] slope a great big old chunk of the log
[57:19] fell off now this is where he gets his
[57:22] sermon how can I overcome Wow
[57:25] don't you love that seminary he wants it
[57:28] so what happened I brings this like two
[57:31] Christians that are coming he said this
[57:33] big tree at one time stood right there
[57:35] it's roots it's at provement down beside
[57:37] the branch of water that was there and
[57:39] it thrived and thrived for years and
[57:41] pulled the nutrients out of the water
[57:42] and the nutrients out of the leaf matter
[57:44] and that stood for years and years the
[57:46] life goes out of it the tree falls and
[57:48] when it falls it falls right into the
[57:50] same branch of water that it had drawn
[57:53] from from years and years but now the
[57:55] life is gone the quotes are there the
[57:57] scriptures are there maybe so dress as a
[57:59] Christian for a while even tops icon for
[58:02] a while but the life is gone from that
[58:05] tree and then it lays right in there
[58:07] where God's healing where God is
[58:09] delivering were gone
[58:10] is moving and it will rock twice as
[58:13] quick as a badness which is going to a
[58:15] dead church
[58:16] that's why message folks when they go to
[58:19] getting cold on God it ain't no wonder
[58:20] they fall so quick why do they fall so
[58:23] quick though right now we're healing is
[58:24] the right that word deliverance is and
[58:26] they come right there and know there's
[58:29] deliverance and but choose not to be
[58:31] delivered oh my goodness
[58:34] notice the joy of serving Christ and
[58:37] living in a church for such as going on
[58:38] here at ins trisys Creek living right
[58:41] under it so we are trying to follow the
[58:43] message of the hour or at least they'll
[58:45] notice I says this because the tokens
[58:46] had to be preached the part of the
[58:48] message we should live counsel in the
[58:50] life of Christ because if you don't you
[58:52] learn around and know that these things
[58:54] are supposed to do and don't do it the
[58:56] Bible said he that knows to do good and
[58:58] do it or not
[58:59] to him it's in then what happens you
[59:02] become duty so you got a doe to God with
[59:08] the dodi clergymen guess what you're
[59:11] gonna become
[59:12] Dody yourself unless you refuse and say
[59:17] I'm out of here
[59:18] I'm now stickin around well they don't
[59:20] believe in the power of God come on show
[59:22] then you become Dodie rotten when you're
[59:25] separated from the life of God so strive
[59:27] with all that's in you to stay in the
[59:30] life of Christ that you may be fruit
[59:33] berry now it's job save during this time
[59:37] yes as far as what would call save yes
[59:41] but it sure isn't bearing good fruit
[59:45] he's so ill his temper is so out of
[59:49] sorts and this trial is bringing some
[59:53] things out in job
[59:55] the child never realized was there no
[59:57] doubt and he's disappointed in himself
[1:00:00] he's disappointed in his understanding
[1:00:03] of what he thought about God God had
[1:00:07] never allowed him to be tested in such a
[1:00:09] way God goes on now in chapter 40 and on
[1:00:13] down through the rest of chapter 40 and
[1:00:15] chapter 41 was bringing some comparisons
[1:00:18] let's look at a few more verses if you
[1:00:19] don't mind and
[1:00:20] eleven God says to him cast abroad the
[1:00:24] rage of thy wrath and behold every one
[1:00:30] that is proud and a basin now you know
[1:00:33] that this may not mean much to us but
[1:00:36] this is deity speaking from a level of
[1:00:39] deity understanding of God being on a
[1:00:43] throne and this is one of the attributes
[1:00:45] of God dealing with humanity in time
[1:00:48] this will never be an eternity of course
[1:00:49] but God dealing with human beings for
[1:00:52] thousands of years this was something
[1:00:54] that God was demanded of in the loop of
[1:00:58] time to be able to express at times and
[1:01:01] that was his indignation his anger and
[1:01:04] his wrath I proud humanity so God moves
[1:01:08] from the stars momentarily and he moves
[1:01:10] from the animals and from botany live it
[1:01:13] God said here is another attribute of
[1:01:15] God that I would like to see you
[1:01:17] displayed so I would like for you to
[1:01:19] show me your godly air your anger as a
[1:01:25] king of eternity bring down the proud
[1:01:32] and make him humble himself before you
[1:01:38] now the God this is a no-brainer joke in
[1:01:43] him humble himself how can he humble
[1:01:47] anybody else now like the rolling of the
[1:01:52] lion may attacks are far from your
[1:01:55] throne may your majestic voice and your
[1:02:00] great of nepeta n-- sand power may it
[1:02:02] thunder in such a way that the sinners
[1:02:05] will hear it and tremble at your
[1:02:08] presence maybe he just got done callin
[1:02:13] for a servant to come and he found out
[1:02:16] there were no more servants left they
[1:02:19] all left God knows how to say the right
[1:02:26] things at the right time stop aren't you
[1:02:28] daddy knows your address now I want you
[1:02:33] to do this and then I want to see the
[1:02:36] consequence of them abasing themself at
[1:02:40] your voice maybe I'll believe you job is
[1:02:50] probably surprised you all right can you
[1:02:54] - a proud man and the esophagus and make
[1:03:00] him humble himself and repent as I am
[1:03:05] able to do come on show how much tammini
[1:03:16] 10 seconds 5 minutes you tell me
[1:03:30] verse 12 look on everyone that is proud
[1:03:34] and bring him low that's it you and I
[1:03:40] would never even think of this is godly
[1:03:42] no this is knobby leather this is one of
[1:03:46] the things that he does everything about
[1:03:49] him is not sparkling stars this is part
[1:03:54] of being God this is part of being God
[1:03:58] listen now don't misunderstand me this
[1:04:01] is part of being God but not being the
[1:04:03] eternal God's anger will one day cease
[1:04:08] to exist in manifestation please listen
[1:04:12] carefully
[1:04:13] one day faith will no longer be needed
[1:04:19] the blood will no longer be needed as an
[1:04:23] atonement between you and God you will
[1:04:25] stand there face to face and see him man
[1:04:30] one day your face will turn to sight or
[1:04:36] will be to God hey man this is
[1:04:40] manifested only in time one day God will
[1:04:42] never look out of his spirit eyes and
[1:04:45] display such anger there'll be nobody
[1:04:48] there to look at that way track down the
[1:04:54] wicked in their place oh my now this is
[1:04:57] what God does again hacia chapter 2
[1:04:59] verse 11 the lost in looks of a man
[1:05:01] shall be humbled in the Holderness a man
[1:05:03] shall be bowed down and the Lord a long
[1:05:05] shall be exalted in that day why because
[1:05:08] God can do that again verse 17 and the
[1:05:11] loftiness of men shall be down down on
[1:05:13] the hardness of men shall be made low
[1:05:15] and the Lord alone shall be exalted in
[1:05:18] that day you know God will repeat
[1:05:20] himself several times
[1:05:21] it's verily verily I say unto you that's
[1:05:23] a double vindication of God's own
[1:05:24] character now he said as I am God I have
[1:05:28] the ability to thunder my voice I'll
[1:05:31] have the ability
[1:05:32] to instill such fear in the wicked now I
[1:05:36] understand you want my job
[1:05:41] speak all nighty job I guess there's no
[1:05:54] wall Mattie's in the building tonight
[1:05:57] but one is there any almighty seaworthy

[1:08:57] bigger than God God bigger than devil no
[1:08:59] you don't find him going that way his
[1:09:00] problem is about allowing the things
[1:09:02] that's going on in his own life now
[1:09:03] notice he's moving into the face of
[1:09:05] repentance real genuine repentance
[1:09:09] repentance can only come to us in
[1:09:12] reality when we see the greatness of God
[1:09:15] the reason people do not repent in this
[1:09:19] day the fear of God has left them
[1:09:22] they're not afraid of God they'll come
[1:09:24] to church and we have a lot to devil and
[1:09:26] set right terrible the Holy Ghost is
[1:09:27] moving it don't bother them at all
[1:09:28] people run down a man of God they'll run
[1:09:30] down a pastor they'll let the devil lie
[1:09:32] to them they'll do all kinds of things
[1:09:34] against the Word of God against the
[1:09:35] scripture against the message come on
[1:09:36] Saints and they have no fear of God at
[1:09:38] all they'll get on the internet make up
[1:09:40] all kinds of lies they'll get on
[1:09:41] Facebook make up all kinds of lies the
[1:09:44] fear of God has left this generation but
[1:09:47] it has not left the bride praise be to
[1:09:51] God all mine notice this I know that
[1:09:54] thou canst do everything not only now by
[1:09:59] power not only by power by the gym but
[1:10:02] divine justice to the power of the
[1:10:05] allocation of his thoughts bringing in
[1:10:08] the Providence and the divine wheel that
[1:10:10] the things that you're going through
[1:10:12] Jove even though you don't understand it
[1:10:14] not only can God do it by power God is
[1:10:17] doing it for your good Omar I know the
[1:10:22] Falcons do everything that no thought
[1:10:25] can be withholding from thee you
[1:10:28] understand friends now he's finally
[1:10:31] reached a spot that you you it's not me
[1:10:34] it's not been me the one that's been
[1:10:36] right the whole time I've been wrong
[1:10:37] I've had such an attitude I've said such
[1:10:41] things
[1:10:56] no salt no salt
[1:11:00] kimby was holded from job saw he now had
[1:11:10] been so long and he's headed and his
[1:11:16] mentality notice in verse 3 who is he
[1:11:21] that highest counsel was that knowledge
[1:11:25] I love this verse you probably don't
[1:11:29] remember it but this is job actually
[1:11:33] quoting word-for-word what God asked him
[1:11:36] in job chapter 38 verse 2 you see
[1:11:45] repentance is starting to work because
[1:11:48] now joke can quote God's word about his
[1:11:52] faults not only about his blessings and
[1:11:55] his healings or we can say the word oh
[1:11:58] yes by strap some here I wish above all
[1:12:00] things that Thomas prosperous say the
[1:12:01] word say the word quote the word repeat
[1:12:03] the word I believe in all that - but
[1:12:05] when we are wrong we have to quote the
[1:12:08] word about us being wrong you see he did
[1:12:11] not do this in chapter 40 he had not
[1:12:13] broke over the last chapter chapter 40
[1:12:16] in full chapter 41 finally broke through
[1:12:18] that hard shell that had been built
[1:12:21] around show up in his complexes and all
[1:12:23] that he was going through and God
[1:12:25] finally broke through it and now Joe is
[1:12:28] quoting back to God the thing that God
[1:12:30] put into him who is this the highest
[1:12:36] counsel without knowledge now job is
[1:12:41] saying not you now I can quote your word
[1:12:49] I'll listen to a lion devil
[1:12:54] anybody in you ever listen to a lyin
[1:12:56] devil devil go to line you say brother
[1:12:58] Wayne don't like your brother Donny
[1:13:00] don't like it he don't care of nothing
[1:13:01] in this world for you don't sit don't
[1:13:04] look at me Saints like you know what I'm
[1:13:05] talking about the devil has done that
[1:13:07] over and over not only about you pastor
[1:13:09] about the Deacons or your friends in the
[1:13:11] church but the same about the Lord Jesus
[1:13:13] he don't love you he don't care for you
[1:13:15] he why he don't even give you the time
[1:13:17] of day and when we listen to that word
[1:13:19] listen to that live devil that's exactly
[1:13:22] what we do he ain't nothing but a liar
[1:13:24] and the church said we listen to that
[1:13:27] line Joe finally come to his body said
[1:13:29] I'm wrong I have listened to lies who is
[1:13:42] this darkness counsel by words now he's
[1:13:53] taking the word and rebuking himself
[1:13:58] well we're all good at that when it
[1:14:00] comes to buchan or wife or the pastor of
[1:14:04] the Deacons whoever more bold we drag
[1:14:06] out our sword will cut their heads off
[1:14:10] how many of y'all are good at cutting
[1:14:12] your own off a good Christian is not
[1:14:16] always one who can cut everybody else's
[1:14:18] tongue off but knows how to cut their
[1:14:20] own oh sweet Jesus
[1:14:26] Carol honey amount Oregon's job
[1:14:28] application will be fired after this
[1:14:29] weekend swords a whirl oh ma
[1:14:34] now in this corrective way the world is
[1:14:37] finally broke through and Jobs seen
[1:14:39] himself surely I did not say that surely
[1:14:45] I did not say that to God surely I would
[1:14:50] this has not been me
[1:14:52] it has questioned him this way
[1:14:58] yes job it was you I am foolish notice
[1:15:11] this who is this that hiders counselor
[1:15:13] that knowledge therefore have I uttered
[1:15:16] that I understood not that sounds like
[1:15:22] us concerning the providential dealings
[1:15:30] of God with men I have said things I
[1:15:34] flap my jaws and I didn't understand the
[1:15:38] first principle about things too
[1:15:48] wonderful for me which I've been Deva no
[1:15:52] now I realize it
[1:15:54] it was total maintenance on my part even
[1:15:58] say anything
[1:15:59] I have pronounced an opinion on subjects
[1:16:06] which I didn't even understand well I
[1:16:16] wonder how many of us are so self
[1:16:19] opinionated and we are so strong on our
[1:16:25] opinion on just about everything
[1:16:33] well I'm gonna come right down among you
[1:16:35] and preach if anybody puts out a bad
[1:16:39] spirit I'll be able to put my hand on
[1:16:41] dinner fine
[1:16:45] what causes the most of our problems and
[1:16:48] arguments between husband husbands and
[1:16:50] wives strong opinionated husbands strong
[1:16:53] opinionated wives and neither them
[1:16:56] willing to bow and willing to hold their
[1:16:58] peace sometimes for the sake of peace
[1:17:01] itself what do you value the most your
[1:17:05] opinion or peace what do you evaluate
[1:17:08] the most you get in your way
[1:17:10] or being able to come to a church I
[1:17:12] don't go along with the music and I
[1:17:14] don't like this and I don't like oh then
[1:17:16] you know what you never will find a
[1:17:17] church that you like unless you run it
[1:17:19] and then if you run it nobody else watch
[1:17:21] it that's all we've all got to be
[1:17:24] changed because if we'd get there to
[1:17:26] heaven would be cropping about which
[1:17:27] foundation was first what say Lord why
[1:17:29] didn't you make the Burrell first I
[1:17:31] thought Burrell would have been a lot
[1:17:33] prettier on the bottom we'll all be
[1:17:35] changed from all that nonsense well I
[1:17:37] don't understand why did you make it
[1:17:39] like a pyramid I would have enjoyed it a
[1:17:41] little bit better all of that about us
[1:17:43] so they totally gone all that about us
[1:17:45] that don't like some of the people we go
[1:17:47] to church with it will all be gone
[1:17:49] there'll be none of you standing down on
[1:17:52] 8th and 7th world crosses down there and
[1:17:55] still around horses
[1:17:56] lord have mercy there's brother Jack Oh
[1:17:58] God let me good on this one that won't
[1:18:00] be the honor that there nobody will show

[1:18:48] though hard and his friends and servants

[1:24:52] teach I love this next verse I have
[1:25:02] heard of thee by the hearing of the ear
[1:25:09] now once you notice now how attributes
[1:25:13] where he's answering from brother Jim
[1:25:16] it's not the hearing of the soul he
[1:25:22] realizes for the tyrrhene is able to
[1:25:24] come to the divine supper
[1:25:26] of truth and tradition I have heard of
[1:25:32] thee by the hearing of the ear that job
[1:25:36] is a great man you agree with that a
[1:25:38] great understanding but we can see for
[1:25:40] this child he liked a lot as well
[1:25:43] notice where he attributes been the
[1:25:46] foundation of what brought him to
[1:25:48] questions such things in the swathi had
[1:25:51] heard about God by the ear his ancestors
[1:25:55] his parents his grandparents the people
[1:25:58] that was around I've heard of thee by
[1:26:01] the hearing of the air but now the eyes
[1:26:05] of my understanding see you in a total
[1:26:13] different way then I heard you I
[1:26:15] realized what I heard about you left me
[1:26:19] was much understanding what I heard the
[1:26:23] way you was and the way was told to me
[1:26:25] and the very best that they might have
[1:26:27] known but by the hearing of the ear it
[1:26:31] has left me in such desolation but now
[1:26:43] well praise the Lord
[1:26:45] I wonder summer jobs children cannot not
[1:26:49] could say the same thing some of what we
[1:26:52] heard of thee by the hearing of the ear
[1:26:54] made us Trinitarians uh-huh some of the
[1:26:59] what we heard of the hearing of the year
[1:27:00] some of y'all said under women preachers
[1:27:02] or believe tongues of evidence the Holy
[1:27:04] Ghost or eternal hell or whatever more
[1:27:06] you got that from the hearing of the
[1:27:08] year no doubt my people that love God
[1:27:10] and we're telling you as much as they
[1:27:12] knew but why don't you believe it
[1:27:14] tonight because your eyes have seen him
[1:27:16] in a different way by the hearing of the
[1:27:18] year and you can hear truce I believe
[1:27:21] that we have the truce here do you not
[1:27:23] believe that
[1:27:24] and yet we hear it over and over and
[1:27:26] over again and it never never moves out
[1:27:28] of her head down to our heart it is no
[1:27:30] more than a traditional value this
[1:27:32] message can be no more than tradition to
[1:27:34] us and our children until it becomes a
[1:27:37] divine revelation I've heard I've been
[1:27:44] instructed in matters of religion I've
[1:27:46] been so instructed I heard by the
[1:27:49] hearing of the year I'd left much to be
[1:27:52] desired
[1:27:53] that hearing allowed me to question you
[1:28:00] know I feel like a fool but this is my
[1:28:09] beloved he separated Jobs flesh from
[1:28:14] job's soul by dividing what he'd heard
[1:28:18] by the ear from what he heard by the
[1:28:22] heart I've heard of thee by the hearing
[1:28:26] of the ear notice by the cherry how he
[1:28:28] identifies I've heard so much about you
[1:28:31] I've learned a lot about you but a lot
[1:28:33] of it was not heavenly accurate oh
[1:28:36] praise be to God man wasn't that too
[1:28:39] good words put together thank you lord
[1:28:41] it was not heavenly accurate it was an
[1:28:45] earthly conception by people that matter
[1:28:48] men well but it less this man lasting
[1:28:50] understanding he could develop such an
[1:28:53] attitude come to understand our people
[1:28:54] do it today because the teaching they're
[1:28:56] sitting under oh they're sitting under
[1:28:58] the teaching and won't apply it I've
[1:29:00] heard of the by the hearing of the year
[1:29:08] I have had much hearsay knowledge I've
[1:29:18] heard you're a good dog I've heard
[1:29:20] you're a grandpa I've heard that you
[1:29:23] don't care how women dress I've heard
[1:29:26] that it don't make no difference to you
[1:29:27] whether we pay in her face or whether we
[1:29:28] look at the world address at Jezebel's
[1:29:30] I've heard that you did she don't even
[1:29:32] care about that I've heard that you
[1:29:34] don't even believe in homeless no more
[1:29:35] god if he believed it wants to still
[1:29:36] believe in it he's holding he said as I
[1:29:39] am holy be you there for her Levi be
[1:29:41] your perfect Sara what what how do
[1:29:43] people to come up with this conduct of
[1:29:44] this concept it's because they have
[1:29:46] heard of him of the hearing of the ear
[1:29:48] and they hear and they set that under a
[1:29:50] dhoti preacher preaching a dhoti God
[1:29:52] they become a dhoti Christian and they
[1:29:54] hear it in here it in here in here and
[1:29:57] some we was all the same way one way or
[1:29:59] another after in the world in his bond
[1:30:02] as we could be hearing about a God why
[1:30:04] don't we look at those things tonight
[1:30:05] God rich and mercy reach down to us and
[1:30:09] divided and separated just for the
[1:30:11] hearing of the year to now mine eyes now
[1:30:29] let me close up again in the morning
[1:30:32] wherefore I love all my people who tell
[1:30:41] me they see so much about God and
[1:30:44] they're so close to God
[1:30:47] ah you know I get a lot of emails and a
[1:30:51] lot of letters and a lot of texts from
[1:30:52] folks around the world I understand
[1:30:55] understand I understand why God don't
[1:30:59] have time to talk to me 24 hours a day
[1:31:02] there's so many other people in the
[1:31:04] message you spend all of his time with
[1:31:06] he ain't got time for somebody like me
[1:31:12] or at least to hear them tell it and
[1:31:18] most of those people will never amount
[1:31:21] to nothing in god they're spiritually
[1:31:25] arrogant spiritually proud and most you
[1:31:29] know people God said God said God said
[1:31:31] listen carefully to what they're saying
[1:31:33] God said most of what Muslims say is
[1:31:36] it's all the time stuff God's saying
[1:31:38] about them how great they are how
[1:31:40] wonderful they are what they're going to
[1:31:42] be in that amazing God didn't treat
[1:31:44] Jeremiah that way God spoke to Jeremiah
[1:31:47] God spoke to syke God spoke to Jose of
[1:31:49] God spoke to Amos he can spend all that
[1:31:50] time by the field since you're my you're
[1:31:52] one the businessmen out there well let's
[1:31:54] just go eat lunch together come on man
[1:31:55] I'll tell you what I'm sure Ben Ramos
[1:31:56] let's have supper together we'll have a
[1:31:58] midnight snack together I ain't got time
[1:32:00] talk about how bad is really is that's
[1:32:01] not what a prophet does a prophet comes
[1:32:04] to rebuke folks of their sins if he's if
[1:32:07] he's the end of his prophecy he's a
[1:32:09] false prophet well a man brother Donnie
[1:32:13] that's one thing that convinces me more
[1:32:16] and more brother branham's not a false
[1:32:17] prophet because his mercy was not
[1:32:19] pointing to him it was pointing to Jesus
[1:32:22] Christ and his bride was staying
[1:32:30] together listen a joke now we'll pick it
[1:32:34] up in the morning Lord willin i abhor
[1:32:37] myself therefore i repent in sackcloth
[1:32:45] and ashes the first time is used this
[1:32:51] word repent while he's finally seeing
[1:32:56] himself as being wrong
[1:33:03] and then you can still see yourself as
[1:33:05] being wrong at times most the time all
[1:33:10] the time now believe it or not I don't
[1:33:14] feel sorry for those of you who say that
[1:33:16] I feel sorry for those of you who don't
[1:33:22] that's right because the real son or
[1:33:25] daughter of God Ballman they miss it
[1:33:27] they want God to correct they say
[1:33:30] something wrong do something wrong have
[1:33:33] a wrong attitude they want God to
[1:33:36] correct they want to be able to be
[1:33:39] corrected why because they're born of
[1:33:42] God they love his word it may burn them
[1:33:47] it may tan their hide as we say but
[1:33:50] they'll repent and cry and say thank you
[1:33:52] Jesus thank you Jesus for loving me so
[1:33:55] much I have heard of thee by the hearing
[1:33:59] of the ear as my uncle and the preachers
[1:34:04] of the church that got saved in they
[1:34:07] told me he was more than one baptize me
[1:34:11] entitles the man I preached for then I
[1:34:14] came out of that and I went into Jesus
[1:34:16] only then I heard of thee by the hearing
[1:34:19] of the ear and they was wrong too
[1:34:23] then I heard about one purchase and a
[1:34:25] her book I don't really care about women
[1:34:27] painting or doing this and that and the
[1:34:28] other and Curtis told Matt not long ago
[1:34:30] she said you remember certain time in
[1:34:33] our life in Pentecost that we got to
[1:34:35] even wondering and questioning if
[1:34:38] holiness was really required by God
[1:34:43] because I left a ministry that preached
[1:34:45] it and went to a ministry that didn't
[1:34:47] and you see the same God doing the same
[1:34:50] things then you begin to question and
[1:34:54] wonder do you need it after all was it
[1:34:56] ready necessary what what was it
[1:34:59] I'd heard of thee of the hearing of the
[1:35:01] air
[1:35:03] but tonight I can say now mine I see a
[1:35:08] thing praise be to God don't you love it
[1:35:17] was so much children this is my beloved
[1:35:24] you see friends you look at me and most
[1:35:26] of you you don't know me you know
[1:35:29] already know me or not that much around
[1:35:30] me you know I'm in the pulpit you know
[1:35:34] me when I pray for you you know me when
[1:35:36] we meet back here and I counsel you on
[1:35:38] occasion that I'll meet you out or
[1:35:40] something like that one occasion I get
[1:35:43] to go out and shake hands after church
[1:35:44] if I don't have an interview so I could
[1:35:47] stand up here if to you tonight and say
[1:35:49] I love God with all of my heart I don't
[1:35:52] want to do nothing wrong if I'm wrong oh
[1:35:55] I want God to correct me I don't mean
[1:35:57] it's true you could tell me the same
[1:36:01] thing but God knows
[1:36:07] God knows each of us does he not and he
[1:36:12] manifests himself through our lives so
[1:36:18] if I ever leave the word if I ever give
[1:36:22] a selfish motive selfish objective my
[1:36:25] father knows I don't want to be here in
[1:36:28] the first place because tell me that day
[1:36:31] she said wouldn't it be something if we
[1:36:34] could just sit down
[1:36:35] you didn't have to preach no more would
[1:36:38] have to get out of the limelight as
[1:36:40] people called it I call it gunfire and
[1:36:47] they limelight it's laser light from
[1:36:48] them scopes people who think I want this
[1:36:55] position I want to be an authority you
[1:36:59] are deceived people in this message to
[1:37:02] think I want to be here you are deceived
[1:37:06] and you better get straightened out
[1:37:08] before you mind up being lost if the
[1:37:11] devil can tell you that about me and
[1:37:13] convince you I guarantee is lied to you
[1:37:15] about God as well I've been with the
[1:37:20] happiest men in this world if I could
[1:37:22] step from behind this pulpit and tonight
[1:37:24] mother Jim would be my final last sermon
[1:37:29] I could close my Bible shut my iPad shut
[1:37:35] off my computer and come to church stand
[1:37:39] outside shake hands do like the rest of
[1:37:42] you do complain about the organ to loud
[1:37:45] guitar you came here that still get to
[1:37:48] hop yeah one thing I don't understand
[1:37:50] what we're all I even play the fan for
[1:37:52] I'd be a good church member like all the
[1:37:53] rest of y'all well I like to burn up in
[1:37:57] church tonight and tell what church is
[1:37:59] about to some people
[1:38:00] growl and fuss and complain
[1:38:06] after tonight I probably will be sitting
[1:38:09] out there tomorrow but it just so
[1:38:18] happened it fell my lot in life to be
[1:38:21] right here for however long God wants me
[1:38:25] to be here another service another six
[1:38:26] years to the rapture however long will
[1:38:28] I'll leave that entirely up to him to be
[1:38:32] honest with you I'm glad he don't always
[1:38:34] grant us our desires and our requests
[1:38:37] cuz brother Branham would have never
[1:38:39] been our prophet people who want to be a
[1:38:44] prophet people who want to be a preacher
[1:38:46] want to be a pastor
[1:38:47] more than likely they're not even called
[1:38:50] it's always the man running from it not
[1:38:54] the man running toward it that's right
[1:38:59] aren't you glad God's mercy went beyond
[1:39:01] you face facts
[1:39:03] you went looking for God God come
[1:39:06] looking for you and His mercy oh praise
[1:39:10] God but this is our beloved praise God
[1:39:20] let's bow our heads together Oh Lord
[1:39:25] Jesus
[1:39:29] Heavenly Father you alone know every
[1:39:33] heart here tonight I pray you'd begin
[1:39:37] with mine search me see if you see any
[1:39:43] hypocrisy any insincerity any error in
[1:39:48] my ways
[1:39:52] Lord God I don't have to stand before
[1:39:55] men to be judged
[1:39:56] I'll stand before you right here tonight
[1:39:59] you judge me look at my heart not to
[1:40:04] sell her see if you see anything in me
[1:40:08] that displays
[1:40:10] reveal it to my lord so I can make it
[1:40:14] right Lord not only with me but search
[1:40:20] every individual here tonight Lord every
[1:40:23] man woman boy and girl
[1:40:26] mayor motives our objectives be totally
[1:40:32] surrender to Him
[1:40:33] I pray Lord that you would help each
[1:40:39] young man each young lady maybe those
[1:40:44] that have lived decades of the life for
[1:40:46] you each of us the entirety of the rest
[1:40:52] of our lives will be placed sill before
[1:40:53] you that whatever you want to do with us
[1:40:57] Lord or to him Lord I cast myself before
[1:41:04] you
[1:41:04] I say it's job involved
[1:41:09] give me an audience
[1:41:11] Lord God oh I hear brother Branham say
[1:41:16] how they like to be able to just sit
[1:41:20] down on the creek bank not have to
[1:41:23] preach anymore
[1:41:27] still be saved he said still be a
[1:41:30] Christian and nothing to his salvation
[1:41:34] but the load the poor man worked under
[1:41:37] all the criticism of a circus and that
[1:41:39] he had to deal with constantly I don't
[1:41:42] say he took it Lord but your grace
[1:41:45] helped him I'm glad you didn't give him
[1:41:48] what he wanted because he didn't want to
[1:41:50] be Malachi 4 he didn't want to be a
[1:41:54] prophet he did not want to be a man that
[1:41:58] would bring rebuke to people as a matter
[1:42:02] of fact I heard him said the other day
[1:42:03] things of value come of great price
[1:42:06] they said it costs me something to bring
[1:42:10] this message I'm sure we won't know till
[1:42:13] we get there to see the value of the
[1:42:15] cost of what it was Lord Jesus were
[1:42:19] thankful he was willing to do
[1:42:21] and we know that's the kind of people
[1:42:23] you use so help each of us tonight
[1:42:27] whether it's a musician a singer I
[1:42:30] imagine some of these musicians some of
[1:42:33] these Deacons trustees I'd say brother
[1:42:37] Jim Babb has topped up his resignation
[1:42:39] time and time again whether it's made it
[1:42:43] to the computer or just in his mind or
[1:42:44] in his dreams
[1:42:45] he's probably dreamed about giving me
[1:42:48] his resignation and him just shout
[1:42:51] screaming and hollering
[1:42:53] no more library keys no more bookkeeping
[1:42:57] and then all of a sudden he woke up and
[1:43:00] realized it was only a dream a fairy
[1:43:04] tale in reality because Lord people are
[1:43:07] called to do something most of them
[1:43:09] don't want to do it in the first place
[1:43:12] but then we always have those around us
[1:43:15] who are chomping at the bits god I pray
[1:43:21] that you'd help those chompers to
[1:43:24] realize you're the only one that can
[1:43:26] place people help each of us father
[1:43:30] Oh Lord God more than likely unless I
[1:43:35] just get so old I can't preach no more
[1:43:37] some crippling disease or something that
[1:43:41] happened to me more than likely I'll
[1:43:43] never get to retire really I can't even
[1:43:47] grasp that I'm up at that age and people
[1:43:50] think about retiring more than likely
[1:43:53] I'll never get to do it and just as time
[1:43:56] goes on my retirement awaits me in
[1:44:00] another place but how we all long for
[1:44:04] our Father we love you tonight Jesus

[1:47:19] encourage him earlier in the week but he
[1:47:21] just got so down brother Seth with what
[1:47:23] he was going through and he just began
[1:47:27] to question God and he just began to
[1:47:30] kind of say things to God and I could
[1:47:33] just feel it and his email is he said
[1:47:37] brother Donnie I know I've heard him and
[1:47:43] I thought yeah that's what a real child
[1:47:47] of God is afraid of I've heard him I

[1:48:55] among us and miracles I don't know if
[1:48:57] they turned into testimony or not but
[1:49:00] the Matthew walked up here there they're
[1:49:02] not : trouble for weeks situations going
[1:49:06] on in his body brother JD email man
[1:49:08] think was Thursday morning so brother
[1:49:10] Donnie Matthew wanted me to share with
[1:49:11] you God performed a miracle in his body
[1:49:16] you know I don't I can't do miracles you
[1:49:19] know I can't do that these brothers who
[1:49:21] does it God does it but I don't just
[1:49:24] want him here in miracles of that nature
[1:49:26] I want him in miracles to break down our
[1:49:29] strong will and nobody may not even know
[1:49:32] it it may not be some that you turn a
[1:49:34] testimony in I've been so stubborn for
[1:49:36] 40 years I've been hard-headed for 50
[1:49:38] God only had to beat the far out of me
[1:49:41] ain't none of us wants to turn in that
[1:49:42] testimony but it's as mirror it's a
[1:49:44] miracle just as well if God can deliver
[1:49:47] us and we ride to that spot do you
[1:49:49] understand the rapture is hinging on
[1:49:52] such preaching you want to see think
[1:49:56] it's gonna be just great jargon of
[1:49:58] rigmarole what we're going off and
[1:49:59] uttering off one mister after another
[1:50:01] after another deep preaching so-called
[1:50:03] that we don't even understand it's gonna
[1:50:05] be our lives and such harm into the Word
[1:50:06] of God and seeing who we are that's
[1:50:08] gonna get us out of here we're in the
[1:50:10] final phase friends don't let this pass
[1:50:13] over and said that what that wasn't deep
[1:50:14] that had no value it's got more value
[1:50:16] than what you realize it does
[1:50:18] much more value could be placed and on
[1:50:20] getting the soul in harmony with God
[1:50:22] [Applause]
[1:50:29] it's just worship together Kim let me
[1:50:33] say this this all resultant for yourself
[1:50:36] maybe you don't hit a perch or lay hands
[1:50:39] on me you just saying you know what Lord
[1:50:40] I just have to come up and talk talk
[1:50:43] some things over with you not ah I
[1:50:46] realize I've had a bad attitude I've
[1:50:49] questioned you over this and that in the
[1:50:50] other and I'm really sorry I just like
[1:50:54] to be mellowed in your presence the
[1:50:58] elders open maybe you don't need so much
[1:51:01] that but you need healing it's hopefully
[1:51:03] deliverance it's open we'll look at it
[1:51:06] in the morning how the word says that
[1:51:08] God come and brought deliverance to
[1:51:12] Jaffa deliverance closer delivered from
[1:51:16] his poverty his loneliness his sadness
[1:51:19] and when God delivered Jove you know
[1:51:22] what God will look at it again in the
[1:51:23] morning God spoke to his three friends
[1:51:26] and said you've not said what job said
[1:51:29] therefore take an offering and let my
[1:51:32] servant Joel pray for you the final
[1:51:36] phase of job's deliverance was praying
[1:51:39] for the friends that had ran him down
[1:51:41] and when he prayed for him God never
[1:51:45] even answered Joel brother Terry God
[1:51:47] never even responded good job well done
[1:51:49] God still remained in silence glory to
[1:51:53] God then God sent his friends to him and
[1:51:56] said pray for us job we've done wrong
[1:51:58] pray for us
[1:52:00] then the scripture says God give him
[1:52:02] double what he's had his brothers his
[1:52:04] sister's they brought a piece of money
[1:52:06] he had something they bring money after
[1:52:10] he's restored why didn't they bring it
[1:52:13] when he needed it don't misunderstand me
[1:52:16] sometimes God will cause your closest
[1:52:18] friends even separate from you

[1:52:24] going through such a trial I hope you
