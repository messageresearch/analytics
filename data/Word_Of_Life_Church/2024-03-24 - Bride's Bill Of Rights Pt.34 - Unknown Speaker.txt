breathless don't it thinking about that time that's not a dream that's not a Walt Disney story that's a reality and we'd like to be remembered today as we pray we've got about six prayer claws for a lot of different needs want you to remember them as well let's just talk to him right now Heavenly Father what a great privilege it is for us to be gathered together here again today in your awesome presence knowing that at one time we as Gentiles we were not allowed in the presence of God the outer court is as far as we could get to but today we stand in the presence of the almighty God not only that but many here in this building today have you in their soul and you have sealed their soul to the day of redemption we pray today father as we approach the word that you would help us I need help no doubt more than anyone here for to stand and to try to bring the word of God what an honor yet what a responsibility help me that I'd not say anything would cause anyone to stumble help me that I'd not say anything wrong and yet I know I've been preaching for almost 50 years and I've never preached a perfect sermon they've all been flawed and all had their human mistakes but somehow you take those sermons and you change people's lives with them would you do the same today for us Lord Jesus when we leave this place it won't be that we'll give honor credit or praise to any man but we'll give it all to you these prayer calls that I hold in my hand today Father signify by many needs some in the body some in the soul lord you know them all we're just asking you today that you'd be mindful Lord as I stand under your anointing to preach the word May the presence of God go with these claw for those that are sick as soon as they touch their body May that evil leave them open our hearts today to your word father as your servant I'm reporting for duty but I'm not reporting alone an army stands here today and we're reporting together speak to us would you father or it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen praise the lord it's awesome to be a child of God isn't it yes turn with me if you would in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 and while you're turning there I have an engagement announcement this morning brother Malachi Spencer and sister Khloe ball got engaged this week and they're planning on a November wedding and we wish to wish them congratulations and the blessings of the Lord on their lives brother Malachi Spencer is uh brother Mark Spencer's dad which makes him brother Ron Spencer's nephew so he's moved here to the church to be a part of our church family so we certainly welcome him on on that aspect too and we're also keeping our eye on him to make sure he takes care of our sister so whenever I met with them a couple weeks ago I told him I said I feel like she's one of my daughters you better take care of her so just a nice little warning that's all it is am amen God bless you let's let's read together Revelation chapter chapter 1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and walk washed us from our own sins in his own blood and has made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen Revelation 5 verse 9 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and that's made us made us we not just invited you didn't come because you wanted to he has made us Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and to the reading of the word the saints of God said amen God bless you you may be seated we have a right to a spiritual priesthood we don't get this right because we were naturally born into it we don't get it because that we live a certain kind of life and we give up this and we trade off sin for this and that but we get it because God himself gave it to us we are called to be a part of the family of God we're not called just to be a part of the saved only but we are called to be a part of a priesthood a priesthood which is given the solemn obligation and responsibility of presenting prayers and praise and sacrificial lives that come to the Lord that is something that every child of God that's filled with the Holy Ghost is called to do not just the preachers not just the ministry but every child of God in this great position of priesthood there are two aspects of things that we'd like to look at today one of them is worship and the other is praise I realize probably most church people um understand an element about worship and praise and they think it pretty much involves either raising their hands or saying certain religious terms and they think that's worship and they think in their mind that church is where worship is supposed to take place part of that is true church is the right place for worship to take place but if that's the only place you worship God you're failing it because worship is supposed to take place in your home worship is supposed to take place in your car on your job whenever you're doing your daytoday activities and if you understand that then you realize you can give him so much more worship and praise than you're doing it right now you think why would I want to well because you were made for that purpose it it it's it's I look at it and I look at it and I study it and I I still can't say that I comprehended that God would condescend himself to a level that he would put himself in need of anything from us I can understand why I need him every day I need him every hour to survive to live but why he would condem sin to such a level and put himself if I can say it this way in a state of vulnerability that if man does not meet God's needs they will not be met we were born that way we are we're totally dependent from the time that we're children the rest of our life we're dependent on others we're dependent on the government for a certain aspect of our life and dependent upon people we go to church with family members loved ones and so on but yet for God the great Eternal to condens send and bring himself to such a level that he would put himself on a basis that if human beings don't need these certain needs that God has they will not be met even cherubim and seraphim and Angelic beings can never meet it they praise him they love him they adore him they worship him but he designated a certain type of worship and a certain type of praise you understand that the type of Praise that we give to God is redemption praise it's Redemption worship Angels cannot praise God in that state only one who's been redeemed we give him saved worship we give him bride worship the Angels cannot do that those of you that are married you know that there is a love that is between a man and his wife that the man has for her the woman has for him that is unlike the love that you have for your children unlike the love that you have for your grandchildren and your mother your father people you go to church with it's love but yet it's a different type of love and if you have the right type of marriage there's things that you can share with your husband or wife that you cannot share with anyone else and there's a relationship a companionship a compatibility that you have with them that no one else has and it's the same thing with the Lord Jesus and his bride there's a relationship that angels have to him that I don't have and there is one that I have that Angels do not understand and we've done looked at it in the scripture in the book of Peter how that the Angels desire to look into which means to stand over and to peer and to look into it in a very suspicious and curious way because they simply do not understand it they watch how God looks at us and they watch his Mercy being extended to us day after day and they watch how little we give him back and they are so curious as to how his Mercy would continuously be extended to us even though they themselves know we are not even worthy of it we don't deserve it and he gives it to us day after day after day don't that make you feel pretty small notice that Paul in the book of Hebrews chap 13:1 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God now listen how how frequently continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name so this is one of the things that we are called to do now not just things when things are going good when your bills are paid as would say all your prayers are being answered but we're to praise God maybe when the bills have not been paid yet but you're praising him that they're going to be you're praising him not only when things are going good but when things are going bad and you've waited and you've prayed for an answer and it's not yet come but you're praising him that it's going to amen notice how the prophet picks this up in a message entitled ordination he said I think our Expressions that we should constantly long to be in worship I wonder how many of us feel this way today that we constantly long to be in worship or is there somehow a a separation that when we're not in church that we don't necessarily think about worshipping God because we relate to worship as being in a church building or a church facility or a church you know service whether it be in a pavilion down there or wherever it be and you automatically think of worship in that type of setting alone so when I read and study along these lines it helps me to realize that as the people of God we are missing so much of what we're called to be in our priesthood truly there's no other place that we can praise him like we can here together but on the retrospect of looking at that on the other side there's something about you praising God when there's no one there but you that you can love him in such a way and just tell him how you feel and you know even misunderstandings and misgivings that you have and when you don't know how to even pray we'll get to it but Lord willing I I'd like to to help you to understand that in the Book of Romans that Paul broke into an element even of prayer that was more than the articulation of saying words I don't know if you've ever been there or not but there is a place that you pray in God that you actually don't say anything now we think in our mind that we know how to pray and we know what should be said not always and Paul described that in the Book of Romans that there was times when we enter into prayer that we can't even utter what needs to be said yeah so if I can't speak it how can I know what to pray well Paul went on to describe this and he said it was with groaning that you cannot even talk about and that Greek word there is articulate which means you don't have the knowledge to be able to express the proper words so you go into it in prayer and then you find yourself moving deeper and deeper into the presence of God and before long you stop talking and you just groan oh oh oh why you said Brother Don that's crazy it's not crazy it's Bible and I can see from the looks on some of your faces you've never been there you've never been in that channel to where the spirit of God uses your mouths but not in words but you begin to grown you say well how can he understand he understand the groanings of the spirit for it's no longer you that's praying but the spirit of God inside of you anybody ever been there you know what I'm talking about some of you I know you do you're shaking your head and you've been there well you didn't even know how to pray and yet the spirit of God in you would start groaning without the articulation of words and it would groan in that realm and you understand what's being done your words and the intent of your heart is being masked ask from Satan and Satan and you understand when you get down to pray now God I'm going to church today and brother Donnie don't speak something that's going to help me I ain't going back no more you just set yourself a big trap for the Devil the devil's going to do everything he can to keep you from get anything out of that service that's why the prophet said even whenever he was praying they asked him the question you told us why you went to Tucson in the beginning now you've gone back again and you haven't told us and give us the explanation and said well it's a secret in my heart and he said as long as it's in my heart the devil don't know what it is but if I speak it Satan will hear it and try to mess up the plan of God there's sometimes when we pray we don't even need to tell exactly how we feel we need to get along with God and let the spirit in us go to praying out of us and you've got a direct line and the devil don't even understand what you're saying come on somebody now when you enter into that sphere also with that will come this element of worship and this element of Praise now we realize many many people have gathered in the Tri Cities today and no doubt they've praised and they've loved the Lord and do many of them love him yes they do they do love the Lord with everything they know to love with they will worship Him and they will give him will it be accepted brother Donnie well that's up to the Lord Jesus what he accepts at any up to me and it ain't up to you it's up to him to accept what he will but this helps me to see that as the prophet said I think our Expressions that we should constantly long to be in worship anywhere to Worship the Lord when we come together to worship Him worship Him at home worship him while you're driving our cars whenever wherever we are Worship the Lord just think that the Bible said let everything that has breath praise the Lord again he says Oh How He Loves to be worshiped I don't know if you've ever done a study in this way or not but if you do it through the Bible and do it through the message it's absolutely amazing whenever you go to Stud I'm going to warn you before I do it there'll be hundreds and hundreds of things you'll have to look at but to find the things that God actually loves now God's unlike us God doesn't love cars God doesn't love airplanes God doesn't love all kinds of things that we love and when you go to honing it down and really looking at it it's very very minimum that I begin to find personally of the things that God actually loves but what he does love he loves with such passion he loves with everything that he is now this is one of the things that God really loves he loves to to be worshiped but you understand what that does then when God loves this it brings him to that spot that I spoke about a while ago of vulnerability now in order to be worshiped you have to have something less than you you have to have something inferior to you to be able to worship you because a greater is certainly not going to be able to worship a greater so you have to have something less than the person or the being desired to be worshiped and they will come and bows and humble themselves into the presence of this Superior one and they will say I worship you I adore you I love you I give you my all so that means that God in order to be worshiped must bring himself to a level of condens to where he will depend upon beings that are so weak and so frail and so feeble that at times they're not sure that they can put one foot in front of the other and yet he lowers himself to that type of creatures depending on them for what he loves only God could do such a thing notice how he loves to be worshiped he loves loves you prais be his name you ought to believe him right now every one of you have faith and believe again he says oh my how people ought to worship him just give him praise and glory he loves to be worshiped now remember this is not something that he can do on his own so he wanted to expand himself he wanted to extend himself beyond the of Eternity and he thought of himself as being a human being he thought of himself of being in a tangible seeable form so he could do that and that was an act of condensation still is not dependent on anyone yet because then he could expand his Heavenly creation and start it bringing into molecules and light meters and things like that but he still not brought himself to where is dependent anybody understand what I'm saying this morning you know there's that element about each of us every one of our human relationships that are intertwined with other people with every person that you and I build a relationship a friendship whether it's people that you work with people you go to church with we become more vulnerable with each human being that we extend a relationship you follow me because the more we love them and the more we can defi in them and Trust in them the more vulnerable we become because you open yourself to people and you tell them secret things about yourself you're opening yourself up to the trust of that individual they may turn their back on you they may tell your deepest secrets and you are making yourself very vulnerable anybody here got hurt by doing that before of course we all have so we open oursel when you marry a man when you marry a woman you brothers and you sisters marry a man you you don't you don't have the ability to look into the future that man may love you for 20 years or 30 then he may turn against you he may hate you he may take another woman into his Embrace and absolutely destroy your life no way to know it no way for you parents to know the children that you're going to bring into the Earth that one day they may turn your world upside down you gave them so much and you sacrificed so much for your children and then they turn turn against you they turn against what you believe no way for you to know that unlike us God knew by making himself vulnerable he knew there would be many days and many nights he would long for worship and he knew many of those that he loves so much and those that he has redeemed they would go day in and day out they would praise him on Sunday morning they would praise him on Wednesday night but they never really even related to praising him on Monday or Tuesday and they didn't think about praising him on Wednesday morning they just more or less were programmed to do it on Wednesday night when they come and found their spot in the church he knew that they would get so many of blessings from his mighty hand and never even stopped to thank him I find it amazing that some Christians don't even bow their heads over their food and thank God for it I I don't understand that myself I just I I cannot relate to that I understand that some people and I told the young people here Thursday night that some people want to find the boundaries in God they want to find What God Says do they want the minimum requirement they want the MDR the minimum daily requirement of what it takes to be bride what it takes to be a Christian what it takes to go on the Rapture so they just tell me what I have to do to get in then they want to get as close as they can to walk on that MDR that minimum daily requirement and get as close to the world as they can and still yet be saved now I also want to know what I'm required to do but I don't want to know what I'm required to do so I can get as close to the world as I can I want to know what I'm required to do and then I want to do above it I don't want to do just what I'm required to do I want to do that but I want to do more I know y'all think I'm crazy and I admit that I am but I want to do what he wants me to do but then I want to do so much more of what he wants me to do that he's overwhelmed by how I feel about him now I know many many church people they say just tell me what I've got to do just to get it in minimize it don't complicate it for me give me a list a b CDE e f g h i j k don't tell me any more than that but I believe somebody that really loves him whose name is on that Lamb's Book of Life they don't want just the MDR but they want everything above and beyond if he wants me to praise him an hour a day I think I'll start out with an hour and a half and then work myself up to two and then up to three make it unlimited come on somebody if he wants me to love him if he wants me to praise him I want to do that but I want to give him more than he even wants me to give him why because God loves to be worshiped and when I worship him whether I'm at church or whether I'm diving down the road if I'm in Lowe's or Home Depot wherever I am I am actually making the Eternal happy wow it's an awesome thing to be able to make someone happy nearly impossible with some people of course but to think that you could actually make God happy and as we can relate to it this way and put a smile on his face and God would look back down to you and say thank you you made my day wouldn't that be awesome if every person under the sound of my voice today would leave this building and say by God's grace I make it my goal I will make him happier than I ever have in my life I'm going to praise him at home I'm going to praise him on the job I'm going to praise him when I'm driving my car I'll tell you what it benefit you and God a whole lot more if you'd spend more time doing that less time on Instagram less time on Tik Tok less time on your social media come on somebody notice now he says in the greater witness God is an object of worship now remember in the realm of Eternity he wasn't even God he was what the Jews call him the Eternal because God is an object of worship and there was nothing or anyone to worship him so he became God when he created angels now I know it's hard for us to imagine but think he was this great being before there was light molecules atoms time anything like that just a great Eternal but he thought himself as being God I want to be worshiped so then he started creating these beings by the myriads that he called Angels some elect some non-elect now don't look at me funny that's what Paul says Paul said the elect Angels so there's some angels that were created others rotated if I can say it that way off of the Eternal himself that was you in representation some angels were created where they could worship him for a long time and then they would make their choice to leave him they're what we know today as demons then they begin to worship and praise and I mean they had nothing else to do there was no humans on the earth the earth wasn't in existence so God created them before he created the Earth and they worshiped them constantly just constantly worshiping him then he wanted to expand his creation out into a universe as we know it so he started speaking let there be let there be now remember the Angels actually fell before the foundation of the world so Lucifer this bright shining Angel which was next to Michael Christ then he he decided he also wanted to be worshiped now there's many difference between him and the Eternal but one of the main ones is that Lucifer could not create he does not have the ability so he could only pervert what the Eternal created but he still loves worship now I can't understand to Satan's mind myself I cannot relate to a being that would want worship and attention so bad that he would take it under the name of another person so let me show you what I mean so I try to get done preaching today's sermon and you were blessed by the sermon and then you go up to Brother John John Horn and you say brother John thank you so much for that sermon today thank you so much for all the studying you done thank you brother I'm an out and people stand around you and you say this that are you nuts brother John did not Preach Today he prayed brother was the one that pray but you see that's just the way Satan will take worship now he knows that many people would never worship him directly most people absolutely scared to death if they'd walk into a church and see a pentagram on the floor they'd see a pentagram on one of these screens and they'd see a a goat with horns on top of oh Lord have mercy devil worship devil worship get out of here get out of here well the majority of the world is never caught up in such but Satan they worship the devil ignorantly thinking they're worshiping God why teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so whenever they teach for Doctrine the Commandments of men the Lord Jesus cannot receive that worship so that worship there's another being standing over here on the side and said I'll take it I'll take it I'll take it and Satan actually receives it even though they are standing there oh Jesus I love you I love you baptizing titles deny Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4 you know whatever it is that they deny and they're offering it up they think in the name of the Lord Jesus but if it don't come up by the Light of the hour and the word of the hour he cannot receive it so it goes to whom the goat I don't want my worship going there brother Paul do you anybody here want your worship going there I don't think so not if ver our right mine and yet Satan is the God of this evil age and before long he will be crowned by his bride right he is the worshiped person of this evil age it is him who is running the Nations it is him who is the god of America America it is him who is the god of Europe Asia India subcontinent of Africa it is him who is the greatest worshiped person I know it's staggering isn't it and God knew when he created this being what he would do he knew he would turn on God and stab him in the back as we would say he knew he would turn against him he also knew that he would pull this element of angels out from under the headship of the word and they would follow Lucifer so this bright shining Angel changed when he looked within himself and about himself and he saw his Brilliance and his magnificence which God gave the to him for God's glory and he twisted that in his heart you see that's where sin began in the heart of Lucifer sin did not begin on the earth sin began in heaven right when another being desired to be worshiped do you understand when you make an idol out of your body oh my y'all going to get quiet on me already if you get any quieter my goodness we'll hear a mouse traced across the floor won't we do you understand in the eight that we're living when people are worshiping their bodies their image their pride their arrogance they're worshiping themselves so they spend you know all this time trying to get rid of wrinkles and all this time trying to do this and trying to do that all my what that pay for a bottle of eternal life today what would it be worse why would a bottle of eternal life be worth what would a serum be worth this morning even some of our Christian sisters if they'd be able to it on their face and the wrinkles would disappear you and I both know a lot of that ain't nothing but snake oil but yet people spend millions of dollars every year on Cosmetics looking for as Pon Deon did years ago that Fountain of years well I found him I said I found him I can tell you where he is I can tell you what his name is but yet it's the Fallen unregenerate nature of man to make a god out of himself and then he turns his adoration and his love which God made to be received by him he turns it toward himself and makes an idol out of himself and you'll watch him it's it's amazing to watch people I'm a people Watcher and it's amazing to watch people when they get in front of a mirror it's absolutely amazing I mean you can watch you know you going to Lowe's and they've got mirrors for sale or you going to Target or wherever it is and you're just looking for a mirror for your house or whatever and it's amazing to watch people whenever they get in front of a mirror it's just amazing to watch what they do and how they look at thems and how they idolize thems you know I mean sure comb your hair and take a bath for the rest of us if for no other reason put on good clothes as you come to the house of God but you realize there's an element of people in this earth and they are worshiping thems and making Idols out of themselves which means they are devil worshippers because they are worshiping that which was born between Satan and Eve when you worship your body you are worshiping the progeny of Satan brother oh my goodness well praise the Lord now whatever we think then about worship God is an object of worship he said and God wants to be worshiped in Sp and in truth so God just don't want to be worshiped but he wants to be worshiped a certain way in spirit and in truth now the prophet of course told us over and over again some people worship in truth with no Spirit others Worship in spirit but no truths what do you all want in our church what both that's what I want because he won't receive it any other way we don't want it to be cold we don't want it to be formal neither do we want it to be where we just scream and holler and shout and all that is good it has its place but we do not have truth which relegates our worship into the presence of God and the church said now let's go this morning into this direction as far as Priests of God and remember that we have one high priest which is the Lord Jesus I am not a high priest no other preacher is a high priest we have one high priest all the rest of us stand on the same plane and level before God now of course we know that gifts and callings of God make a difference in a person's life but when it comes to been saved you're just as saved as I am you got just as much Holy Ghost as I've got you're just as well thought of and loved in heaven is the greatest preacher in the message is that right but then let me ask you this question today what position does Jesus Christ truly hold in your life is he first second third 10th 20th 25ths hundreds what position does he hold now what's the prophet and the unwelcome Christ he said what part has God has he got rather in your life today Christian has he got the best part or are you just giving him the attic now remember he's preaching about Jesus coming to Simon's house now remember Simon was a Pharisee and he was going to have a great feast one day and he invited the Lord Jesus he did not invite the disciples this is one onone public humiliation so he invites the Lord Jesus and before he gets there he tells his footwash flunky now that Nazarene preacher guy is invited but this is just between me and you I'm going to embarrass him today the whole invitation is this in mind I'm going to humiliate him I'm going to embarrass him I'm going to prove to his followers and the poor ignorant people out there that think he's some kind of special person I'm going to prove he is not even worthy to be acknowledged so when you see him walk in the door don't you anoint him forbid anyone to kiss him and don't you dare wash his feet now the ritual was that they would walk and they would come each one of them present their invitation to this Feast signed by the man himself the Lord Jesus comes gives his invitation then they would have couple of different people they would have one that would anoint you because the Palestinian sun was so hot and you were sweaty and you would walk and your perspiration your body order of course and then they you wouldn't feel welcome among the rest of the people so have someone to anoint you with a a mixture of Frankincense Sandalwood Merd some different things like that and everybody would smell the same they would anoint you and then they would take your old shoes off and they would have a footwash guy that would set there he's the lowest paid guy in the whole structure of the household he would set you down and they would have a room take your old dirty shoes off and put your feet down in this pan of water and then he would wash your feet so this is his job so he washes everybody's feet then they would give you according to the size of your foot they would give you a pair of really nice house shoes so then you were anointed and whenever they did that then you would stand up then it was a signal to the man throwing the party that you had come through this process then he would come and embrace you he would kiss you on one side of the neck turn kiss you on the other side of the neck then he would embrace you you would Embrace him and you were welcome then you could go in and start mangling around with some people hey there dror so and so brother so and so how are you and they would come up to you and they would smell of you and they would they knew that you would come to the process so Jesus walks in nobody greets him nobody kisses him nobody anoints him now remember Jesus was so much a man that Jesus could feel embarrassment yeah as a matter of fact the prophet said that on one occasion whenever they spoke to him that jesus' face actually turned red and it embarrassed him he had to understand how his bride is going to feel when she feels humiliated being laughed at because she dresses a certain way and acts a certain way so he didn't just bear your sin he bore embarrassment so he comes in and they just motion him through get on in there you sorry thing so Jesus didn't turn and walk out no doubt he already knew when he accepted the invitation how this church service was going to be so he goes in and he don't know where to set because nobody was kind to him nobody told him sir your seat is over here this this is reserve for you so he just kind of looking around where should I go so we say he just goes over here and he he's kind of feeling embarrassed and ashamed and anybody ever felt that way embarrassed ashamed maybe your clothes wasn't as nice as so and so and whatever more you didn't meet up to their standard and you just kind of look down you imag the disciples they're on the outside now they weren't invited so they're looking through and they say I imagine Peter saying I'll tell you one thing if I get in there I'll Mash their mouth John say Peter Peter Peter hold up you know Jesus wouldn't want you to they do our Lord that way out out Peter calm down calm down come on be honest most of us just still got a little bit of Peter left in US I'm talking about the ones that got the Holy Ghost the rest of you got a lot of Peter left in you brother Dave can you imagine how they felt in their heart as they said look at him why would they do that to our Lord I have the same question why would we invite Jesus Christ to come to this service today then if he would go to moveing on some of you you wouldn't even respond cuz your scared to death of what somebody would say about you the prophet said as he got the best part of you just giving him the attic you give him a little prayer now and then what about it what kind of place you given him there set Jesus sitting over by him and his disciples couldn't come in they wasn't invited all of them standing around looking on there sit Jesus over there very uncomfortable the smell of the road on him dirty feet imagine Jesus as he unnoticeable as it could but down at his feet dust up between his toes dust all up around his ankles them all stand over look at him that's the Son of God so they say you're going over to speak to him I ain't going over to speak to him he stinks church people still say the same thing about him that old holy ghost stuff that old shouting and jumping and healing and miracles it stinks it don't to us amen is it stink to you brother Adam brother Adam sit up here a few Services ago pinch nerve in his neck couldn't hardly move his neck excruciating pain Brothers we laid our hands on him text men are day or so and said every pain of it's gone every effect of it's gone call it a stink if you want to we call it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever they said Jesus uncomfortable smell of the road on him dirty feet un anointed face not kissed welcome setting over to one side in the corner head down that old Pharisee what'd you invite him for you hypocrite that's the way it is with your church you'll pray for Revival when the Holy Ghost comes you push it off I hope and pray to God we never do that at Word of Life oh I want a Revival Among Us I don't know about you I want a stirring oh brother Donnie what if people get excited what if they do if they go to a ball game and will stand and scream and holler and Shout for a crazy ball game there ought to be somebody so in love with Jesus Christ that they're not ashamed to say Glory Hallelujah praise the [Applause] Lord you pray for Revival when the Holy Ghost comes you push it off you'll never make him welcome somebody gets healed or something another filled with the Holy Ghost you go around and talk about it push him off you don't want to get the Holy Ghost no more you want a preacher that oh my listen to this you don't want a preacher that preaches the Holy Ghost and sanctification you don't want it no more you want some little classical halfwit I know that don't suit some of you in your prim and proper way but in case you don't know it I'm going to let you know today Donnie Reagan ain't some classical halfwit amen I don't believe we want these preachers in our church to be classical High wits we want them to be Anointed with the Holy Ghost to preach the gospel to cast out Devils to lay hands on the SE to pray our young people through to the Holy Ghost we don't need a bunch of classical High wits in the message I say we send all the classical halfwits out of the message you want some classical little half wit you do know what a half wit is don't you that means he's only got half is wits the other half is gone I don't want to be a half WI I want to be a fool with well come on somebody I want to have a mind of Christ to know what he wants done with his word oh all polished up with a little mental theology with real good grammar and stuff like that give me the oldfashioned God sent Holy Ghost God sent Bible preaching where Jesus is welcome he said he will bless your heart and you'll set and choke it down you won't make him welcome he wants to be praised but you won't praise him but you'll holler hello Mr President ain't it amazing some big important person comes around and if they are our friend how many people we want to know that I'm their friend Jesus will come around and make us cry make a shout a little bit oh that embarrassed me oh I got a wrinkle in my trousers I got a wrinkle in my shirt oh my my let me get my towels straight okay Jesus pour it out on me now Glory oh you cold cold creature I wish the Holy Ghost had get a hold of you some of you it would knock all the pride out of you it knock all the arrogance out of you but brother Donnie what if I act like you well if you act like me then you might know how I feel sometimes oh I'll tell you one thing I don't come Oh Brother Don what what if we get in the flesh I've been in the flesh for 67 years I'm more concerned about getting out of it I want the Holy Ghost to grab a hold of us and Shake us to he shakes the world out of us till he shakes the coldness out of us and the starch out of [Applause] us well you say hello Mr President how do you I ain't seen you for a long time Jesus comes and you push him over over in the corner unwelcome you pray and pray and pray for Revival and when the Revival begins to break out somewhere you say uhuh not in my church have nothing to do with that over there oh you actor Pride head up in the air hypocrite shame on you you ask him to come to your church sometime when he'll fall in an oldfashioned way look at how he relates this he will fall in an old fashion way and you're ashamed to let loose and let him have his way and you quench him away you invite him to your home and then you're ashamed of him before your neighbors let him sit there unentertained now listen there's something else Jesus wants Jesus wants to to be worshiped he wants to be entertained now everybody in this building ought to be able to relate to this since we spend so much of our time being entertained movies music social media phones Amen brother Donnie Amen brother Donnie Preacher Brother Donnie I'm G to let these streamers think there's a bunch of people agreeing with me Amen Brother D Amen Brother D Amen Brother D apparently you all ain't going to worship him I reckon I might to preach and do that too so Jesus actually wants to be entertained now being a grandfather I have been entertained my girls entertain me too Ash Courtney whenever they was little they would entertain us whenever the Parker girls come along they would entertain us and they wanted the intro and me they wanted everything ladies and gentlemen I present to you Miss elliana Reagan Parker she's going to come out and do so and so buddy would they put on the dog because they was entertaining us but you know what they was doing that they wanted to be seen sure they was doing it because they loved us and Jesus comes to church and we think about ourselves the whole time well what about me Lord what am I getting look I've not come to entertain you today I have come to entertain him well come on somebody that's the way he wants every day of our my life to be every day ought to be a day of entertainment for the Lord Jesus now know this may seem strange to you to think that this is what he wants but listen he wants to be entertained how do you entertain Jesus say come Lord Jesus Come into my heart I love you Lord entertaining so what do you do when you entertain people you put them in a special spot you let them be seated and then you get up and do whatever it is you're going to do to entertain them is it amazing how we've got church backwards It's All About Us well the temperature wasn't right I thought they sung one song Too Many well I thought this one song I definitely did not like I I and you think it's all about you it is not all about you we've come here to entertain the King of Kings and the Lord of lords sure these singers sing to bless you but we're not here just to bless you we're here to bless God we're here to entertain God right listen what Webster says the word entertain means provide someone with amusement or enjoyment give attention or consideration to an idea suggestion or a feeling he goes on to say my brother sister the most important thing in your life is to entertain Jesus Christ praise God ah I saw it click over some of you praise God you finally got your purpose in life right there you just got it that's the main purpose of your life but think about it how much of our life is focused on us entertaining him it's us being entertained we go here we go there we do this we do that other how much of our life is spent on entertainment for us though oh my and then he asked a question I'm going to ask you you believe that now they responded and said amen I believe the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in the first place in your worship first place in your life first place in Everything Jesus Christ deserves that place amen I believe it with all of my heart but if you don't now listen if you don't want him to have first place listen how he is if you don't he'll take second place he'll go down in the basement with you so let's say we invite Jesus in we go to the door oh Jesus Oh My Savior my king thank you for shedding your blood thank you so much thank you for dying for me oh how I appreciate that come in come in come in and then we set him down and then we go to laying the law to him now you sit right there don't you go into my closet don't you dare look at any of my books cuz there might be something in there that you might not like I want you as my savior but I don't want you telling me what to do so you sit right there and you keep still I don't want none of this tongue speaking stuff I don't running no jumping nothing like that I'm a classical half wet you're also a nit [Music] wet so Jesus don't you go to cry don't you get all emotional you leave my music alone you leave my movies alone you leave my Tik Tok alone and my Instagram alone and all the rest of my stuff alone but I do want you to save me me and my family's fixing to eat supper and you sit right there so Jesus just sits there he hears you all in there in the table and you're eating and laughing and having a big time you noticed some of you didn't even pray over the food so we're just sitting in there sitting in there I can't wait till they come back I can't wait till they come back and talk to me a little bit I I I I just know one of them is going to come out at any time they're going to come over and put their arms around me I can't wait till they do so y'all get done with your supper you come out he's still sitting there you don't offer him nothing to drink nothing to eat no Fellowship now we're going into our family room and we're going to watch an x-rated movie now we know you're very religious and you're very strict so you just stay there while we go have us a little bit of entertainment don't you dare get up from that seat so it just sits there and his face gets a little bit red and he said that's my daughter I I love her that's my son hurts me so bad that do that you come up about 10:30 11:00 whatever it is you looking there are you still there yeah I I I thought you invited me you you wanted to talk to me where did you get that idea I work hard I need a little bit of enjoyment in life I get give you my heart what more do you want well I actually wanted all of you all of you you mean you want everything about me you want to control my time you want to control my life you want to tell me where I can live you want to tell me what church to go to now you want to tell me I've got to go to this certain church that has a message of the hour I can't even be part of the Rapture you're you're a controlling God you know that so where would you like for me to go well we're fixing to go to bed and we're actually pretty tired and we do not have time to pray tonight so if you don't mind would you care to go down the basement sure I'll go in the basement which door is it and you could enter and you keep quiet we need our rest Lord God children we send him in the Attic we send him in the back bedroom we send him upstairs we send him in the basement and he wants to be right in the living room with us he wants to be sitting at the kitchen table when we're eating he wants to sit there at the table and eat with us and have fellowship with us now I don't mind telling you I've got a long ways to go in my Christianity he's still working on me so if you invited me to your house and you treated me the way I just described the way we treat Jesus I might come back the second time just thinking perhaps you were not at yourself you had a really bad day you know you're really stressed out I might go back the second time if you invited me again but I probably would never go back again if you treated me the same way right but Jesus comes back again and again and again how many churches is he visited today in the Tri Cities he's been there for years been there for decades and they keep turning him out but he keeps coming back to see if there's one there that would warn him one that he could get a hold to their heart and bur them and bring them to a true relationship with him my brother my sister the most important thing in your life is to entertain Jesus Christ you believe that I believe the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in first place in your worship first place in your life first place in Everything Jesus Christ deserves that but if you don't he'll take second place he'll go down in the basement with you so you take him down in the basement you say now Jesus we're having a party upstairs after church but it might get a little bit Rowdy you know and we we might actually tell a few jokes it's you know kind of off color a little bit we know that that you wouldn't want to be around that so you just St here but now don't get in your mind now that we don't that we we're running you off oh no no no we definitely want you as our savior absolutely and when we walk before the white Throne we want you there oh my we want you there so you'll stand before the great judgment seat of God on our behalf and say father forgive them but we just don't like you meddling in our lives but by now she's already late she wasn't invited so she goes down her creaky steps and something's off she can tell it because the streets aren't crowded that day times she walks out a little bit toward the city market and she can smell it that roasted lamb and those Mediterranean potatoes and the taziki and the bread and the wine and all of it she gets close and think oh wow what a meal what it must be like to be able to sit there she thought well but a one woman of my type can never have nothing like that so she thought maybe maybe I'll just walk down and see what's going on so she gets down and she sees this great big crowd around the Pharisees house and she kind of goes to pushing her way in and of course she's a woman of ill frame and bad reputation and all the church people natur don't want nothing to do with her so when they see her coming they all go to scattering you know just scattering scattering so she looks in and she sees him and say oh no look at him they've not anointed him they've not washed him he's still sitting there dear God forgive me Lord for every day I've done that to you you know the story she goes back and gets her money and comes back and said I want the best perfume you have she didn't run to Big Lots at the clearance table and buy two for the price of one but she said I want the best you've got you imagine as she heads back maybe she gets on forth in Main and she comes to herself and said what in the world is the matter with me that man is a prophet he'll know who I am he'll know what I've done he'll know where I got this money to buy this but I can't help it there's something about his look that Drew me to him here she comes she's in a frenzy it's a passion by now I don't even know what I'm doing he'll probably throw me out I'll never even get past the front door but if it's him calling me he'll make a way to accept me so here she comes in and they've got the guards of course the poor people are on the outside and they're all just smelling that wine and smelling the lamb and all the things that the kebabs and everything in the Mediterranean diet and they're just smelling it in their mouths are watering about that time she comes running through and bust through the door somebody grabbed her out of my way out of my way reminds me of that little Mexican woman down in Mexico years ago and her baby had died that morning but she heard that the God had sent a prophet in the land the doctor pronounced the baby dead she come up oh Hallelujah hundreds of users couldn't keep her back they God they tried to stop her she crawled between their legs she went over the top of their back so that dead baby and that blanket under her arm why she had to get to where God God would be able to move I guarantee you one thing if we would start coming to the house of God today with that attitude all the Devils would tremble they would shake when you and I come to the house of God because we've come to worship we've come to entertain we've come to bless we've come to magnify we would get our attention where it needs to be not just on us so she bursts in the door and then the Pharisee looks at you you filthy woman course there's probably some more of them other people in there said oh dear God she's going to tell I'm a client she ain't there for them now let's face reality she's not even there for herself she's there for him oh brother Steve if we could start coming to the house of God but that frame of mind I've got needs but I ain't going for myself today my family's got needs but I ain't going for them today I'm born for his needs I'm called to meet his needs I'm his wife I'm a part of the bride of Christ I'm here to benefit Jesus imagine as she gets sh I do it shall I do what should I do his eyes hit her and his eyes Lo onto hers and like a gigantic magnetic power of a million strong it knows her she's helpless she can't resist him oh Hallelujah here I go despite the consequences you're like oh and she reaches you I don't know about you but I can't wait till I get there that day and I can fall at his feet and take his feet in my hands oh Jesus you walked that lonely path for me the aroma fills the room her tears the tears of a repentant sinner begins to fall upon his feet the prophet said Jesus never moved never flinched never moved a muscle what's going on Jesus is being entertained he finally got entertained I can't wait to see her at that day can you you talking about awesome you talking about an awesome time when we get up there and she finally walks before the Lord Jesus and he gives her her reward y'all might as well get ready for it I'm just going to tell you right now I'll be one of the I may be the very last one on the very last row in the very back part of it you'll hear me screaming from the back I preached about you many a time God bless you Sister God bless you your story touched my life don't you want her story to touch your life hallelujah oh hallelujah look children Jesus Took this woman and made her a part of his story his story each one of you today if you're called by the Lord Jesus you are a part of his story one of the brothers text me this week and said I just want to thank you for prayer for my family and this and that you've been a great pastor and you know just thanking me for for all that sort of thing and I said brother I just answer back I said brother I'm I'm so glad to be a part of your story I want to be a part of every one of your story I am the sheep that come here I'm a part of yours you're a part of mine but we're all a little tiny part of his story you understand when we stand before him what it's all going to be about it's him rewarding us because we make the story complete you musician Brothers you're not playing in vain you singers you Sunday school teachers you youth leaders you are part of the story of Word of Life Church you are part of the story of this message you're part of the story of Jesus Christ and when we hear it told over and over again in eternity he'll start telling Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Donnie Carol you you you you imagine she don't know where to raise her head or not she's weeping she's crying she's washing Jesus said Simon I have somewhat to say to him say on master hypocrite Master how could you treat your master that way you remember the story then he turns to the woman and says daughter Oh Glory to God daughter son whichever you are your sins are forgiven you may I say it to you today in this format if you will accept it right now while I'm preaching to you this word if you're a sinner your sins can be forgiven while you're sitting there you're a Christian today full of the Holy Ghost but yet you're hearing an element about worship that you fail to give the Lord Jesus aren't you some of you sitting now your hearts are smitten right there you feel like your heart's about to burst open well let me go ahead and just tell you your sins of denying him your sins of not entertaining him are forgiven hallelujah oh Hallelujah why because you've repented right there in your heart you don't have to come to the Altar and beat on the altar

forgive us now we're so sorry Lord we're so sorry s that we've made Church all about us and all about what we want and all about what we think forgive us Lord may we never come into this building again the same way and we realize it's not about us being entertained and yet that's exactly what some people want they go to church to be entertained that's why a lot of the modern day preachers ain't nothing but entertain ERS they know the things to move the crowd they know the words to say so many jokes that they can say that's why many of the modern-day churches they want flashing lights they want rock and roll bands they want all kind of theatrics I don't know that I'll ever forget whenever these professional people come in to talk to us about what we wanted on the platform and the screens and the guy told me that he had just bought this gigantic screen to put up his church for theatrics while the preacher was preaching so it would make the sermon more interesting I said sir I depend upon the holy ghost and sometimes the presence of God gets so real in our services if it become any more real I'm not sure we could take it we don't need theatrics we need to respond to the holy H ghost amen Lord if there's a sinner here today that's not made that commitment deal with their hearts may they hear you calling their name there's one without the Holy Ghost not only here but streaming no doubt there's many of us that have felt smitten if we've set in your presence we're sorry I realize I've not been a very good priest I missed so many times I could have praise you forgive

in the name of the bridegroom our sister never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus like many of us she was baptized in titles but the Lord been dealing with her heart to take on his name in water baptism we understand from the scripture when Jesus said those things in Matthew 28910 going to All Nations teaching and making disciples of all people baptizing them in the name of the father of the son of the Holy Ghost Jesus ever said names neither did he say repeat these titles so Peter in Acts chapter 2 whenever they stood there men and Brethren what must we do to be saved repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so he didn't do what the opposite of what God told him to do he done what he told him to do we're so grateful that the evening light has shined upon this great scripture and we can obey this today Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that our sisters come today to take on your name and baptism we know Lord that it's a simple as it would be for a woman that would marry a man and she takes on his name then what kind of wife would she be if she refused his name she would want his money she would want His blessings and this and that and the other but she would say I'm ashamed of your name I don't want your name Lord we're so grateful that you've opened it us up to us that to be bride we must take on your name in obedience to your word I will baptize this sister in water father I pray that you would fill every fiber of her being with the Holy Ghost Lord Lord Jesus may she grow and grow into your image until she comes to the place that her body can be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye granted Lord amen amen sister in obedience to the word of God already upon your profession of Faith accept him as your savior I baptize you in
