[34:04] is you lord
[34:08] praise the lord hallelujah
[34:12] amen thank the lord we can certainly say
[34:15] that tonight can't we
[34:17] gracious in that in the name of the lord
[34:18] and wonderful privilege for us to be
[34:20] gathered together again
[34:22] in god's house ii timothy chapter 3
[34:25] verse 1.
[34:28] second timothy chapter 3 verse 1.
[34:34] he believes in prophecy
[34:39] prophecy has always been from the garden
[34:43] of eden one of the attributes
[34:47] of our father as a matter of fact he was
[34:50] the first one
[34:52] to prophesy he gave his word and his
[34:56] promise
[34:57] of the promised seed that would come and
[35:00] bruise the
[35:01] serpent's head so prophecy is something
[35:05] that
[35:06] believers real bible believers
[35:09] hold to it's not something that we have
[35:12] to try to
[35:13] make happen or even sometimes that we
[35:16] fully understand it
[35:18] until it's right before us and then
[35:20] there it is and that oh my goodness so
[35:22] you know the prophet said that god
[35:24] fulfills his word
[35:26] by bringing it to pass
[35:29] but let's read tonight of some of these
[35:32] prophecies of the end time
[35:35] this know also that in the last days
[35:38] perilous times shall come
[35:42] we can say amen to that coming up for
[35:44] men shall be
[35:46] lovers of their own selves
[35:50] covetous boasters proud
[35:54] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[35:58] unthankful unholy
[36:02] without natural affection truce breakers
[36:06] false accusers incontinent
[36:10] fierce despisers of those that are good
[36:15] traitors heady high-minded
[36:19] lovers of pleasure more than
[36:22] lovers of god my goodness what kind of
[36:26] people are these
[36:29] well i'll tell you what kind they are
[36:30] most of them are religious
[36:33] church-going people now if you think
[36:37] this is describing infidels
[36:39] they're even worse than this
[36:42] this prophecy is pertaining to
[36:45] apostasy not agnostics
[36:50] it's not those on the extreme left of
[36:52] the political spectrum
[36:54] that do not believe in god
[36:58] i got your attention now donna
[37:02] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[37:04] pleasures more than lovers
[37:05] of god ah
[37:10] man you believe me having a
[37:13] form of godliness and the word godliness
[37:16] in the greek means to
[37:18] be like god so
[37:21] all of the above people now with this
[37:24] one included
[37:25] 19 adjectives compound and singular
[37:30] that paul uses to describe the people
[37:33] in the last day and all of these people
[37:36] right here
[37:37] are apostates now can you imagine then
[37:41] what the rest of the world which are
[37:44] agnostics infidels islam
[37:47] and on and on and on hindu and all the
[37:50] rest of the people that don't even
[37:51] follow in the line of christianity
[37:54] this is only the apostate group
[37:58] wow notice this
[38:01] having a form of godliness
[38:04] but denying the dunamis
[38:08] the dynamite the power
[38:12] thereof so you can profess godliness and
[38:14] hold and maintain to i am a christian
[38:16] i believe this i believe the bible i
[38:19] believe jesus died for my sins
[38:21] i believe if i accept him as my savior i
[38:23] won't be lost
[38:24] but you deny any power of his grace to
[38:26] change your life
[38:28] to keep you from sinning every day
[38:35] not turn to not run toward
[38:38] but from such such what religion with no
[38:42] power
[38:44] brother brahman said it over and over
[38:45] again god
[38:47] hates a powerless
[38:50] religion that ain't just baptist
[38:54] methodist
[38:54] that's message if we turn into it that
[38:57] includes us
[38:58] just as well as everybody else god hates
[39:02] a powerless religion
[39:05] my don't you love the word tonight i
[39:08] mean like to be remembered in prayer
[39:10] god bless you let's uh bow our heads
[39:12] together
[39:14] heavenly father we're so grateful
[39:16] tonight for your precious word
[39:19] as we read it it stirs our hearts
[39:22] lord it it does so many
[39:26] things for us depending on what
[39:29] portion of the word that we're reading
[39:31] and looking at
[39:33] these portions that we've read tonight
[39:36] lord i believe for many of these people
[39:39] that are
[39:40] standing here it is not a description
[39:44] of who they are from their soul
[39:48] they're isaac if they've been born again
[39:51] and they have that
[39:52] isaac that promised seed in their soul
[39:56] they cannot be apostate and be that
[40:00] but yet because in time we're still held
[40:02] in these
[40:03] prisons our bodies can certainly
[40:07] get under these old anointings of the
[40:10] last day
[40:11] so father i pray that you would help us
[40:14] lord to realize that these things are
[40:16] written for our
[40:18] admonition they're written so that we
[40:21] would not be
[40:22] caught up in the spirit of the last days
[40:25] everybody on the earth
[40:26] is going to be under the spirit of the
[40:28] last days
[40:30] but we want to be under the spirit of
[40:32] god we want to be under
[40:34] a rapturing spirit not hatred
[40:37] variance and strife emulation and all
[40:40] these things that we've read about
[40:42] we pray that you'd be mindful lord of
[40:44] the sick those that are suffering
[40:46] lord god move among us tonight we pray
[40:48] with your great presence
[40:50] in the name of the lord jesus we ask it
[40:53] amen
[40:54] god bless you saints you may be seated
[41:00] i know in some ways when we read
[41:03] things like this it doesn't make us feel
[41:05] very good
[41:07] there's this negative side of prophecy
[41:10] that
[41:11] we look at and we think well you know
[41:13] that's not me and i hope and pray
[41:16] that there's not a person here tonight
[41:18] under the sound of my voice or any
[41:20] that's streaming this service
[41:22] that would fit into this category that
[41:25] paul
[41:26] so fluently described i hope that
[41:29] there's
[41:29] none of us here that will wind up in
[41:32] this
[41:33] category but i'm sure that all of us
[41:36] could say
[41:37] that in our life that we have in times
[41:40] past
[41:41] been under this influence because it is
[41:44] the spirit
[41:45] of the last days it's part of the
[41:47] portion of prophecy
[41:49] that is given to laodicea somebody's
[41:51] going to fulfill it
[41:53] but if i have a choice that ain't part
[41:55] of the word i'm going to fulfill
[41:57] i'm going to fulfill the other part but
[41:59] nevertheless
[42:00] i don't want to look at it with some
[42:03] mindset oh that's not me
[42:05] i don't have anything to worry about but
[42:07] as a
[42:08] mortal in time i have to watch
[42:12] the spirit of the last day i have to
[42:14] watch
[42:15] because my flesh as we're looking at on
[42:18] sunday morning my flesh is not saved and
[42:21] yours isn't either
[42:22] and it is not yet fully redeemed so i
[42:25] have to watch this o ishmael because
[42:27] he still wants to try to convince me
[42:29] that he's the promised son
[42:32] and he wants to convince me that i need
[42:34] to listen to him just like
[42:36] yours does but yet when i'm in perfect
[42:39] harmony
[42:40] with the seed life that's in my soul and
[42:43] i'm in fellowship with my father
[42:45] he constantly is suppressing this
[42:47] ishmael
[42:48] and sending him out from the presence of
[42:51] the promised son
[42:52] which is isaac but my ishmael needless
[42:55] to say he does not like that
[42:57] every day that he's out of the presence
[42:59] of abraham
[43:00] it is a day of humiliation and a day of
[43:04] embarrassment now listen as the prophet
[43:06] said this
[43:07] in 1953 in west palm beach florida
[43:11] the world's got to get like this god
[43:13] would be unjust
[43:15] to pour his wrath out upon a just people
[43:19] which shows us that the bride will only
[43:22] be allowed
[43:23] to remain on the earth earthen up to a
[43:26] certain time before it reaches the
[43:30] climax
[43:31] when god's wrath will reach to a certain
[43:34] level
[43:35] the bride must be raptured out or the
[43:38] justice of god
[43:39] would have crossed his own barrier of
[43:42] grace
[43:43] and god will only let the bride stay on
[43:46] the earth
[43:47] when the tribulation before the
[43:48] tribulation ever sets him
[43:50] and even before the wrath of god and the
[43:54] anger of satan reaches a certain climax
[43:57] it would be unjust of god to leave his
[43:59] sweetheart here
[44:01] on the earth one day pass when the wrath
[44:04] of god
[44:05] is being poured out notice this they've
[44:07] ignored him
[44:08] now these are the people that have
[44:10] turned him away they have ignored him
[44:12] and walked away and satan's captured
[44:16] them
[44:16] now whether we tonight or americans or
[44:19] canadians
[44:20] or africans or indonesians or indians or
[44:24] whatever more that we would be
[44:25] we cannot look around and see our
[44:28] fellow americans or the people in africa
[44:31] their fellow amer
[44:33] africans or the people in the continent
[44:35] of india
[44:36] or asia wherever more that they would be
[44:39] they could not look at their
[44:40] fellow brethren of their nation and see
[44:44] the people who have done this
[44:45] turn down the mercy of god and see them
[44:48] walk into the captivity
[44:50] of satan and their soul be sealed away
[44:53] and they're actually souls that are in
[44:55] prison now if they truly have the spirit
[44:57] of god
[44:58] you cannot see people who are in that
[45:00] state and not feel
[45:01] so sad for them in your heart
[45:04] because there's something within us that
[45:07] grieves us for our fellow americans here
[45:09] we are
[45:10] veterans day and i'd like to say to all
[45:13] the veterans in our church and all of
[45:15] those
[45:15] that will stream the service thank you
[45:18] for giving the years of your service
[45:20] that you would be able to risk your life
[45:23] so that we would be able to have this
[45:24] right tonight to me
[45:26] do we not thank them for many of them
[45:28] they got wounded maybe not physically
[45:30] but
[45:30] psychologically and whatever more and i
[45:33] appreciate
[45:34] each one of you that gave that service
[45:36] for us
[45:37] i'm sure it must break your heart as you
[45:40] see what you the price that you pay
[45:42] and see what our nation is leading into
[45:45] but from one
[45:46] american to another i thank you and i
[45:48] salute you tonight
[45:50] on the programs of one of those who's
[45:53] enjoying the benefits
[45:54] of what you did do we not saints as the
[45:57] children of god
[46:04] just as we salute our spiritual
[46:07] forefathers
[46:08] who pave the way for us now we how we
[46:11] thank god for men like brother branham
[46:14] but then we look back at brother branham
[46:15] would say he could not have brought what
[46:18] he brought
[46:19] had it not been for the people who run
[46:22] a precedent before him and we thank god
[46:25] for those
[46:26] people who the early pentecostal fathers
[46:29] had paved away
[46:30] that even forerunned brother rem they
[46:32] did not see of course what brother
[46:33] branham saw
[46:34] and even maybe for those who who was in
[46:36] the earlier days
[46:38] of the message and they you know many
[46:40] maybe some of your fathers and your
[46:41] grandparents and we could preach tonight
[46:44] the message of the hour
[46:45] and they would sit here maybe 50 years
[46:47] ago and they'd say
[46:48] what are they even talking about i never
[46:50] heard that when i was in the message
[46:52] well in their day
[46:53] they was talking about god sending the
[46:55] prophet and you know the prophet said
[46:57] this and the prophet said that
[46:58] boy thank god god sent a prophet and
[47:00] that's where they rallied around
[47:02] for years and years but what did they do
[47:04] if it had not been for them
[47:06] we would not be where we are tonight so
[47:09] they foreign us
[47:11] thank god they did is that right if
[47:13] there is
[47:14] another generation we are forerunning
[47:17] them
[47:17] i personally can't believe and see that
[47:19] there would be but each one
[47:21] foreruns the other and when we see that
[47:24] we cannot see our nation
[47:26] our brothers our people and see them how
[47:28] they're so caught up
[47:30] in the rottenness of laodicea and hurt
[47:32] our hearts as the prophets before us did
[47:35] notice this in question actually in 1954
[47:38] we've got to get in the spirit
[47:39] of the last days when the last days are
[47:42] here
[47:43] you go to a dance hall and you've got to
[47:46] get in the spirit
[47:47] of dancing or they won't dance you go to
[47:50] the church
[47:51] and you've got to get in the spirit of
[47:53] worship how many knows there's the
[47:55] spirit of worship
[47:56] and you and i will try and try and try
[47:58] and sometimes the lord
[47:59] will let us try and put forth our effort
[48:02] and then he'll send the spirit of
[48:03] worship but you know if you worship very
[48:05] god god
[48:06] very long at all there is a difference
[48:08] in you doing it
[48:09] and him doing it through you now what
[48:12] happens is
[48:14] you give actually get under the spirit
[48:16] of worship
[48:17] and then he just takes all of your
[48:19] effort and he makes it so much easier
[48:21] but until he does we're going to do it
[48:24] whether we feel it or not
[48:25] right because that's what we're called
[48:27] to do so it'll be the same way with
[48:30] people who get out in the dance fire
[48:31] never got out the dance floor in my life
[48:33] only dancing i've ever done has been for
[48:35] the lord so i don't know how it is to go
[48:37] to a honky tonk or a bar room or nothing
[48:39] like that
[48:40] because i've never done it before but i
[48:42] imagine that there's people out there
[48:43] and they want ain't no dancing mood
[48:45] well they would call it a dancing mood
[48:48] but actually it's in the spirit
[48:50] of dancing but there'll be somebody out
[48:52] there and boy they'll jump about on the
[48:53] floor
[48:54] as i said i've never been in one of
[48:55] those places so i really don't know what
[48:57] it's like
[48:57] but they may get out there and they they
[48:59] bring that spirit
[49:00] then there'll be somebody else and
[49:02] they'll get out there and they'll go to
[49:03] dancing
[49:04] and then the spirit is getting stronger
[49:06] and stronger well don't you understand
[49:07] it's the same way in worship
[49:09] and what if 90 of you come in here
[49:11] you're dead as a hammer
[49:12] you said you're on wednesday night and
[49:13] you're tired and you wore out you don't
[49:15] feel like going to church you don't feel
[49:17] like worshiping you're
[49:18] aggravated and you're mad as an old
[49:20] hornet but you know what there might be
[49:22] one person that again here say praise
[49:25] god i come to have
[49:26] church i drove all the way from the
[49:29] mountains of virginia
[49:30] i put forth the effort so while i'm here
[49:32] i think i'll just worship god
[49:35] and maybe that one person will go to
[49:37] worship in god
[49:38] i'm crying a little bit and crying out
[49:39] well glory to god
[49:41] and that spirit to get on somebody else
[49:43] and somebody else
[49:44] and then somebody else before you know
[49:46] it it's turned that whole
[49:48] service around because somebody got
[49:50] under the spirit
[49:51] of worship well it's the same way
[49:55] with the last days now we've talked
[49:57] about the last days for many many years
[50:00] and there's a sequence of the last days
[50:03] that have actually
[50:04] been in the session since the lord jesus
[50:06] spoke
[50:07] his words of matthew 24. now when paul
[50:10] writes this here
[50:11] in second timothy chapter 3 verse 1.
[50:13] this was actually written around
[50:15] 66 a.d so already the last days
[50:19] had begun so the last days are the two
[50:22] last thousand year
[50:23] increments of time that will be lived
[50:25] out on the earth before the millennium
[50:28] so the last days began then but yet what
[50:31] what we know about prophecy is
[50:33] that god can allow prophets to utter
[50:35] certain words from god
[50:37] and part of them will go say to this
[50:39] dispensation
[50:40] and then part of them will be fulfilled
[50:42] over here part of them over here and the
[50:45] sequence of that fulfillment will keep
[50:47] unfolding until
[50:48] every word has come to pass so there was
[50:50] words of this no doubt
[50:52] that paul began to see jude of course
[50:54] wrote and said i
[50:56] thought it to brought to this unto you
[50:58] that you had earnestly contend for the
[51:00] faith that was once delivered to the
[51:02] saints
[51:02] thirty years after pentecost and they
[51:04] were already getting cold
[51:06] they were feeling indifferent toward god
[51:08] toward the church
[51:10] they were substituting a new birth for
[51:12] shaking their hands and
[51:13] so on and so on so already the
[51:16] conditions of the last days had moved
[51:18] into the church
[51:19] but not in the face and not in the
[51:22] reputation
[51:23] and the multiplicity of how much it
[51:25] would be like it is
[51:27] in our day so we live in the day when
[51:30] not only
[51:30] are these every one of these descriptive
[51:33] terms of these 19
[51:34] terms that paul used to describe the
[51:36] last day but it is
[51:38] so much greater than it ever was when
[51:41] paul is here do you believe that
[51:42] well you have to because it's greater
[51:44] than it was three or four years ago
[51:47] i may believe we were in the last days
[51:49] three years ago how many believe we were
[51:51] in the last days in 2019
[51:54] but as 2020 felt more like the last day
[51:56] year than 2019
[51:58] or 2018 or 2017. if there is a 2021
[52:02] may god have mercy on us that's all i
[52:03] know if it's gonna be any worse in 2020
[52:06] come and get us lord jesus that's right
[52:09] because you know as well as i know this
[52:11] year
[52:12] is a turning point and it's not just us
[52:14] that knows this
[52:15] i spoke one year just yesterday to a man
[52:18] that's
[52:18] doing some work for us over here in our
[52:20] building and this man was so
[52:22] tore to pieces tore all two pieces about
[52:25] the election and tore up about
[52:27] he said you can just feel it you can
[52:29] just feed it
[52:30] what's wrong what's wrong preacher he
[52:32] said things are just so
[52:33] all tore up i said well i agree with you
[52:36] they are but i said the lord has got
[52:38] these things
[52:39] under control and we've got to believe
[52:41] in him i know that i know that but i've
[52:43] never seen
[52:44] i'm so tore up i've never been torn up
[52:46] by an election and tore up by this
[52:48] i just had to stand right there in my
[52:50] heart and say thank you jesus
[52:52] thank you jesus that we've got a place
[52:54] i'm not saying that things don't bother
[52:56] us
[52:56] i'm not things saying that things don't
[52:58] trouble us but i'm saying
[53:00] is our god is bigger than politics our
[53:03] god is bigger than the democrat party or
[53:05] the republican party
[53:07] he's bigger than a voting machine he's
[53:09] bigger than the senate
[53:10] he's better than the congress well come
[53:12] on church he's bigger than who
[53:14] he's bigger than the world health
[53:16] organization and every other
[53:18] he's bigger than covid he's bigger than
[53:20] influenza
[53:21] our god is god and there ain't nothing
[53:25] going to destroy the council of god
[53:27] he will bring his word to pass
[53:35] so while they're getting the spirit of
[53:37] hatred and murder
[53:38] we ought to be getting in the spirit of
[53:39] the rapture
[53:43] amen notice this he says we're in the
[53:46] spirit of the last days in god's promise
[53:48] that these things would be here and
[53:50] that's what we've got we're in the last
[53:52] days
[53:52] and men and women are setting asleep
[53:56] and don't realize it now let's look at
[53:59] this prophecy and we'll take this verse
[54:01] by verse
[54:02] and word by word and let's break it down
[54:05] a little bit now as i said this
[54:07] is a prophetic insight not so much
[54:10] just a total anti-god move now remember
[54:14] that even as much as the left in america
[54:18] wants to actually take america away from
[54:21] her
[54:21] judeo-christian background and as much
[54:24] as if we listen to a bunch of these
[54:26] socialists in the white house
[54:27] and in the congress and so on they would
[54:30] want to take america away and many of
[54:31] them want you to believe
[54:33] that america will eventually get away
[54:35] from her religious right don't you never
[54:37] believe it
[54:38] don't you never believe that that is
[54:41] nothing but a scarecrow from the devil
[54:44] god symbolized her in the book of
[54:46] revelation
[54:47] under them two horns she will maintain
[54:50] her religious identity
[54:52] not truths i'm not talking about truth
[54:55] i'm talking about her religious
[54:57] identity right up to the very last phase
[55:01] of her helping israel and then if she
[55:03] turns on israel
[55:05] she will be destroyed but for them to
[55:07] want to project sure that's what they
[55:09] want to do
[55:10] but as the demons in world war ii
[55:14] wanted to destroy the earth and god sent
[55:17] an angel down and world war ii they
[55:20] still to this day don't know exactly
[55:22] how it all come about well i could let
[55:24] them in on something if the white house
[55:26] would like to know
[55:27] if they want to know all they got to do
[55:29] is call me and i'll tell them exactly
[55:31] what it was
[55:32] our father had a greater plan most of
[55:35] that well a lot of us hadn't even been
[55:36] born yet
[55:37] and we certainly hadn't been born again
[55:39] and them demons were so at one another
[55:42] the demons of america versus the demons
[55:45] of japan
[55:46] versus the demons of germany and the
[55:48] demons of the uk
[55:49] and them demons got in such an uproar
[55:52] like had never been before
[55:54] and god looked from heaven and said
[55:56] they're about to destroy the whole thing
[55:58] and god dispatched the mighty angel down
[56:01] and he went down and said let there be
[56:04] peace
[56:05] i want you to sound to our mistress it's
[56:07] time to bring
[56:08] world war ii 2 and then you imagine them
[56:12] devils
[56:13] were so mad and they were so angry and
[56:16] they went to report back to hell
[56:18] and satan said i want to know which one
[56:20] of you
[56:21] stop that war well it wasn't me the
[56:23] demon of germany said
[56:25] and the demon of america said it wasn't
[56:27] me and they said well we thought it must
[56:30] have been you he said it wasn't me
[56:32] i wanted all them people to kill one
[56:34] another so i could take them all to hell
[56:36] but if it wasn't you and it wasn't you
[56:38] who was it they might have heard a voice
[56:40] from heaven say
[56:41] it was me it was me
[56:45] oh hallelujah the same god that stopped
[56:48] that war
[56:49] is the very same god when all hell comes
[56:52] against you as an
[56:53] individual or against us as a church or
[56:56] against the bride around the world
[56:58] and all the demons say we've got her
[57:00] we've got her now we're going to get her
[57:02] oh no our god still has the power
[57:06] over war he still has the power over
[57:09] disease
[57:10] and sickness and trouble hallelujah and
[57:13] if he wants to stop it he can say stop
[57:16] stop
[57:21] and guess what it'll do stop
[57:28] and then demons will report down in hell
[57:30] again who was it to stop that attack
[57:33] against donny
[57:36] i've been working on this for years and
[57:38] we're going to well we thought you did
[57:40] well i didn't do it what was this your
[57:42] depression devil wasn't me
[57:43] was it you quitting devil he's just
[57:45] gonna quit wasn't me
[57:47] who was it that voice come back from
[57:49] heaven it was me
[57:52] it was me he's my boy he's my boy
[57:56] and i thought today was the day it's
[57:59] gonna change
[58:00] and i stopped
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:13] watch this paul says this
[58:16] know also that in the last days
[58:21] perilous times shall come so
[58:24] this is identified as one of the most
[58:28] prophetic things in the new testament
[58:31] concerning apostasy peter writes about
[58:35] it
[58:35] jude writes about it but not quite as
[58:38] eloquent in the way that paul does
[58:41] notice this in second thessalonians 2 3.
[58:44] second thessalonians was written around
[58:46] 54
[58:47] a.d so here written before of course
[58:50] timothy here and paul had already begun
[58:54] to deal with some of these things let no
[58:55] man deceive you
[58:57] by any means for that day
[59:01] that day a prophetic time shall not come
[59:05] so
[59:05] this phase of prophecy had not already
[59:09] moved in the full cycle they were seeing
[59:11] deception
[59:12] they were saying all kinds of things but
[59:14] that day
[59:16] that day had not arrived it has now
[59:21] for that day oh my shall not come it's
[59:24] not here but it shall come
[59:26] except there come a falling
[59:29] away now look at this word falling what
[59:32] the greek word is apostasia and this is
[59:35] where we get the english word apostasy
[59:37] and it means to forsake a falling away
[59:41] a defection or an apostasy so
[59:45] it is not infidels it is not agnostics
[59:49] it is not people that are islamic it is
[59:51] not people that are hindu or any other
[59:53] heathen
[59:54] worship that we know about in the world
[59:56] today but it is
[59:58] actually people who have known an
[1:00:01] element of truth
[1:00:02] but they have apostasized now they have
[1:00:06] walked away
[1:00:07] apostasy is not a genuine sincere person
[1:00:11] believing wrong now listen to me and so
[1:00:14] you don't misunderstand what i'm fixing
[1:00:15] to say
[1:00:16] no doubt every one of us sitting here
[1:00:18] tonight believes things
[1:00:20] right now that are incorrect
[1:00:25] now you see the difference between an
[1:00:28] apostate
[1:00:29] and a genuine sincere person that's
[1:00:32] believing wrong
[1:00:33] out of hearsay or out of ignorance
[1:00:36] is that whenever a genuine sincere
[1:00:38] person sees that they are wrong
[1:00:41] and they're proved wrong by the word you
[1:00:43] know what they do they change their
[1:00:44] thinking about it
[1:00:46] they change their beliefs so if they
[1:00:48] they was taught there was three gods
[1:00:50] and you show them by the word that
[1:00:51] there's only one they change their
[1:00:53] belief
[1:00:53] but not an apostate person an apostate
[1:00:57] person will actually hold on
[1:00:59] to what they believe even after you
[1:01:02] prove them wrong why because their pride
[1:01:06] whatever more
[1:01:07] will not allow them to be corrected they
[1:01:10] will not
[1:01:11] bow to the god of truth because of
[1:01:14] humiliation
[1:01:15] embarrassment whatever the reason is so
[1:01:18] a person who's believing
[1:01:19] something wrong and maybe we're sitting
[1:01:21] here tonight and you believe this about
[1:01:23] election and you believe
[1:01:24] that about so and so and this weekend
[1:01:26] you'll hear me read a quote
[1:01:27] and it'll totally spin your whole world
[1:01:30] around you're saying oh my goodness
[1:01:32] lord i'm sorry i believe that wrong i am
[1:01:35] so sorry lord jesus
[1:01:36] brother john does that mean i'm apostate
[1:01:38] no it means that you're a real genuine
[1:01:40] believer
[1:01:41] but you believed it wrong because of
[1:01:43] tradition or because you was told
[1:01:45] somebody said so-and-so about so-and-so
[1:01:48] or somebody said brother brahm told them
[1:01:49] so and so about this and that and the
[1:01:51] other
[1:01:51] and once you actually see it in the word
[1:01:54] then you say
[1:01:54] lord i'm so sorry i repent of that let
[1:01:57] me know so i don't talk it up
[1:01:58] any all still have to do that
[1:02:02] oh my goodness well the rest of you holy
[1:02:04] angels i realize while y'all are still
[1:02:06] here it's me and the rest of these
[1:02:07] people that raised their hands
[1:02:10] i'll find out something just about
[1:02:12] weekly
[1:02:14] well come on i do you say brother donnie
[1:02:16] as old as you
[1:02:17] are yeah i'm as old as i am and i hope
[1:02:19] as long as i'm in my right mind i can
[1:02:22] still be talked
[1:02:23] because i found out that's one sign you
[1:02:25] got the holy ghost you've got a
[1:02:26] teachable spirit
[1:02:28] so no doubt we will go on this weekend
[1:02:31] next week and the week there after
[1:02:33] that we will find things about the word
[1:02:35] and we'll say you know what i didn't
[1:02:36] realize it but i i believe that wrong
[1:02:38] i've held on to that but this is not the
[1:02:41] falling away
[1:02:43] but a falling away then is people who
[1:02:45] have been told the truth
[1:02:47] but they refuse to measure up to that
[1:02:49] truth and they fall away from what they
[1:02:52] have heard
[1:02:53] and they begin to alter and they begin
[1:02:55] to reach
[1:02:56] a state of compromise now notice paul
[1:02:59] said
[1:02:59] that no man deceive you by any means for
[1:03:01] that day shall not come
[1:03:03] except there come a falling away
[1:03:06] first first and that man of sin
[1:03:10] be revealed so falling away is an act
[1:03:13] of professed christians who deliberately
[1:03:17] reject revealed truths
[1:03:20] so you show them in the bible nobody in
[1:03:22] the bible was ever baptized in titles
[1:03:24] and you show them scriptures about one
[1:03:26] god and you showed them malachi 4
[1:03:28] and so on and so on and so on you see
[1:03:30] god is the only one that knows
[1:03:32] when we are witnessing to people whether
[1:03:34] or not they actually see that
[1:03:35] now jesus told the people when he was
[1:03:37] here if you would blind
[1:03:39] if you were blind if ye were blind you
[1:03:42] would have no sin
[1:03:43] but because you say we see
[1:03:46] therefore your sin remains so it shows
[1:03:48] you an eye
[1:03:49] that many of those scribes pharisees
[1:03:51] have seen such a seed
[1:03:52] they actually saw who he was but they
[1:03:56] would not bow to it we know there's no
[1:04:00] man can do these things you do unless
[1:04:02] god be with him
[1:04:04] is that right so apostasy differs
[1:04:07] from error now listen apostasy is not
[1:04:10] the same thing as
[1:04:12] error errors i said can become because
[1:04:14] of traditional
[1:04:16] things or you just not been taught or
[1:04:18] even hear saying you base it on
[1:04:19] ignorance or hear say
[1:04:20] but apostasy is something that is
[1:04:23] totally
[1:04:24] different so now it's not that the
[1:04:26] people of god
[1:04:27] are free from error holding on to
[1:04:29] something that is wrong brother branham
[1:04:30] believes many things
[1:04:31] you do a study sometime and you get time
[1:04:33] if you don't take a lot of time
[1:04:34] and type in what he said i used to
[1:04:36] believe type it in quotation marks so
[1:04:38] you get all the quotes
[1:04:40] i used to believe that uh you know this
[1:04:42] that mary produced the egg and i used to
[1:04:44] believe that and i used to believe that
[1:04:46] and i had election wrong until an angel
[1:04:48] of god stood and corrected me
[1:04:50] so you know what i hear when i hear
[1:04:52] those things i hear a man
[1:04:54] that is able to acknowledge that he was
[1:04:57] believing
[1:04:58] with all of his heart sincerity but he
[1:05:00] was not
[1:05:01] an apostate you see this is why those
[1:05:04] who have left the message are trying to
[1:05:06] make brother branham
[1:05:07] they're trying to make him a false
[1:05:09] prophet they're trying to make him a
[1:05:11] liar
[1:05:11] they're trying to make him apostate
[1:05:14] don't you understand
[1:05:15] who that is that's the devil out of hell
[1:05:17] getting on them people
[1:05:19] to try to get you to doubt the message
[1:05:21] of your homeland
[1:05:23] you see this is who you are this is
[1:05:25] where you
[1:05:26] belong it's the very same thing they
[1:05:29] done to the children of israel
[1:05:30] when the spies were sent out and they
[1:05:32] went out and they come back and well you
[1:05:34] know here's all these grapes but
[1:05:36] my goodness we found all this and that
[1:05:38] and the other here was the amorites and
[1:05:40] the hittites
[1:05:41] and we saw the sons of anac there and we
[1:05:43] were in their side as well as our own
[1:05:45] side as grasshoppers
[1:05:47] and how in the world can we ever go out
[1:05:48] there what are they doing
[1:05:50] using these people that were a part of
[1:05:53] that move
[1:05:54] and trying to plant doubt and questions
[1:05:57] and all that
[1:05:58] in the minds of the people in the
[1:06:00] message but who were these people
[1:06:02] message followers at the time
[1:06:05] so then they started getting websites as
[1:06:07] we'd say today
[1:06:08] and they started writing books and they
[1:06:10] started interviewing this person and
[1:06:12] that person another person
[1:06:13] well i'll tell you one thing i wish some
[1:06:15] of them would be able to interview god
[1:06:18] that's the one i'm looking for to come
[1:06:19] up on youtube
[1:06:21] of those who have left the message i'm
[1:06:23] not just interested in this man and that
[1:06:25] man and that man and that man
[1:06:26] and many of them don't even know their
[1:06:28] own middle name they're so old well i
[1:06:29] don't remember what i don't remember i
[1:06:31] don't remember i'd like to see you all
[1:06:33] interview god and i'd like you to ask
[1:06:36] god god why
[1:06:37] did you vindicate this man around the
[1:06:39] world if this man was
[1:06:41] a liar and a deceiver and a false
[1:06:44] prophet
[1:06:45] god why did you give this man a ministry
[1:06:48] that surpassed
[1:06:50] anyone that had ever been on the earth
[1:06:53] well praise the lord him so much said it
[1:06:55] was the lord jesus
[1:06:56] using his body well come on saints
[1:06:59] that's who you ought to interview you
[1:07:01] got all kinds of questions don't come
[1:07:03] and ask me i'm just a little beyond i'm
[1:07:05] nobody
[1:07:05] i know nothing go to god's door and tell
[1:07:08] him you want an interview and you want
[1:07:11] some answers
[1:07:12] and you want some straight answers if
[1:07:14] this man was not a prophet of god then
[1:07:16] why did not
[1:07:17] god kill him when he made the challenge
[1:07:20] if i'm not a servant of god
[1:07:21] may god strike me dead on this platform
[1:07:24] why would god leave a liar
[1:07:26] and a deceiver and a hypocrite on the
[1:07:29] earth
[1:07:29] deceiving and leading away his innocent
[1:07:32] children
[1:07:33] to follow this so-called false prophet
[1:07:35] to hell come on somebody
[1:07:40] amen but you know what god would say if
[1:07:42] i could interview god tonight
[1:07:44] god would say donny i done spoke amen
[1:07:47] i done spoke i spoke to supernatural
[1:07:51] it was me calling their names it was me
[1:07:54] giving their address
[1:07:56] it was me telling them i see your doctor
[1:07:58] he's a heavyset man
[1:07:59] he's got on glasses he told you day
[1:08:01] before yesterday
[1:08:03] their sister so and so they're so and so
[1:08:05] they're so and so that was me donny and
[1:08:07] i just smile real big like a
[1:08:09] meeting sour grapes and say lord i knew
[1:08:11] that all the time thank you jesus
[1:08:13] i knew that already i just wanted to
[1:08:15] make sure lord
[1:08:17] this is why all of their questions don't
[1:08:19] move
[1:08:20] me you see when people have all kinds of
[1:08:23] questions
[1:08:23] i like to look at the heart that has the
[1:08:25] question because a lot of times
[1:08:27] questions are not from a sincere heart
[1:08:30] i'm reminded of a preacher one day
[1:08:32] that sat there and watched as a woman
[1:08:34] come in and poured out precious ointment
[1:08:36] on the feet of my lord
[1:08:38] and he sat there and the bible said that
[1:08:40] he had a question well come on somebody
[1:08:43] and he began to ask this question how
[1:08:46] come this was not sold for so much money
[1:08:49] and given to the poor you sorry rotten
[1:08:51] hypocrite you
[1:08:53] he wasn't concerned about the poor but
[1:08:55] the bible said he was
[1:08:57] a thief so what do we have we have
[1:09:00] a question not coming from the heart of
[1:09:03] a sincere person
[1:09:04] i don't know why i'm going this way but
[1:09:06] i'm going this way but we have a
[1:09:08] question coming from the heart
[1:09:10] of a thief he was not interested in
[1:09:12] truth
[1:09:13] he was interested in what he can get out
[1:09:15] of and i can tell you friends
[1:09:17] that for some of these who say oh bless
[1:09:19] god none of these message preachers will
[1:09:21] tangle with me they're bald-faced liars
[1:09:24] i've sent many of them all kinds of
[1:09:26] things in the scripture that looks like
[1:09:28] mistakes and error
[1:09:30] you know what they can't answer you they
[1:09:32] have to hang their face and say well
[1:09:34] thank you
[1:09:35] well thank you aha thank you you
[1:09:37] two-faced small-faced liar
[1:09:39] you hypocrite hell down gonna burn up in
[1:09:42] the lake of fire come on somebody
[1:09:44] but why because god vindicated this word
[1:09:48] and where is there going to be a great
[1:09:49] fall in a way right around the message
[1:09:52] of the hour
[1:09:53] right around the very last light of the
[1:10:00] gentiles
[1:10:11] oh brother donnie don't poor old brother
[1:10:13] down in me
[1:10:15] this is going to change poor old brother
[1:10:17] donnie
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:20] this is going to get us out of here
[1:10:22] brother wes
[1:10:23] [Applause]
[1:10:25] what's this the apostate is perfectly
[1:10:27] described
[1:10:29] in second timothy 4 3 for the time will
[1:10:32] come
[1:10:34] when they will not endure
[1:10:37] wow what a word to use
[1:10:42] for sound doctrine so sometimes
[1:10:46] you have to endure it sometimes it
[1:10:49] whoops
[1:10:49] up one side and whoops you down the
[1:10:51] other stomps on your toes it crumples up
[1:10:54] your knees
[1:10:55] man it runs in one ear and out the other
[1:10:56] it shears you like a sheep on the top
[1:10:58] palm down
[1:10:59] when you get done you feel like there
[1:11:01] ain't nothing left of you but there's
[1:11:02] something down inside of you you want to
[1:11:04] come back the next time the church doors
[1:11:06] is open
[1:11:07] why because you've got the ability to
[1:11:09] endure
[1:11:10] sound doctrine i don't want to just talk
[1:11:12] about sound doctrine
[1:11:14] i want to have something in me that can
[1:11:16] endure if the lord cuts me to pieces he
[1:11:18] cuts me up one side
[1:11:20] and down the other i want to try my best
[1:11:22] to wobble in church the next time
[1:11:24] and sit down on the pew and say
[1:11:25] hallelujah glory to god i may sit there
[1:11:28] like an old ragged scarecrow
[1:11:30] i might raise my hand and one arm fall
[1:11:31] off and raise the oven and my hand falls
[1:11:33] off
[1:11:34] but i'm going to do my best to let hell
[1:11:36] know whose side i'm on
[1:11:38] i want heaven to know whose side i'm on
[1:11:41] because according to the bible there
[1:11:43] is a book of remembrance that's been
[1:11:45] written down in heaven hallelujah
[1:11:47] i want the lord god to know i am
[1:11:50] identified
[1:11:51] soul spirit and body what the message of
[1:11:54] malachi
[1:11:54] 4. i ain't got no intention on going
[1:11:57] back
[1:11:58] i've got no desire to go back my boats
[1:12:01] are burned
[1:12:01] my bridges are destroyed hallelujah
[1:12:04] i don't want to go back i'll be only
[1:12:07] saying my
[1:12:08] future lays before me because my past
[1:12:11] has been erased
[1:12:23] now this is 66 a.d
[1:12:27] so by now already folks are getting
[1:12:29] tired of sound doctrine
[1:12:31] why don't you notice how paul frames
[1:12:33] this in the prophetic
[1:12:35] future for the time will come
[1:12:40] so paul knows the scope of this
[1:12:43] prophetic word
[1:12:45] was not for his day it had not yet
[1:12:48] arrived
[1:12:49] the fullness of this prophecy well the
[1:12:52] time will come when they
[1:12:56] they i'll tell you one thing i'm glad i
[1:12:58] ain't in this
[1:12:59] vague group
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:03] you know hear people say well what they
[1:13:05] said they said i'll tell you one thing a
[1:13:06] lot of these days are going to hell
[1:13:08] and this day right here that they in a
[1:13:10] daily mess of trouble
[1:13:12] they that ain't me what about you
[1:13:16] what about you i ain't going to sing
[1:13:19] whenever i quote this question i ain't
[1:13:20] going to say
[1:13:21] i'm one of them i'm one of them
[1:13:26] that ain't me
[1:13:29] but the time will come when they will
[1:13:32] not endure
[1:13:33] sound doctrine but after their
[1:13:36] own lusts shall they heap
[1:13:41] to themselves teachers isn't it amazing
[1:13:44] they don't want just one so they got
[1:13:47] them on youtube they got books by them
[1:13:49] they got them on television
[1:13:51] so they they're just you know all these
[1:13:53] pictures all they are they're just
[1:13:54] another one on the heap
[1:13:58] it's a good place to get them burned you
[1:14:00] pile them all together in a big pile
[1:14:04] and the seventh vision will take care of
[1:14:05] them when this nation will be destroyed
[1:14:09] oh god help us
[1:14:12] notice this they shall heap
[1:14:16] to themselves teachers having itching
[1:14:19] ears
[1:14:22] and they shall turn away
[1:14:25] their ears from the truth
[1:14:33] and shall be turned unto fables
[1:14:40] in reality the spiritual fables they
[1:14:42] turn to
[1:14:43] are worse than snow white and the seven
[1:14:46] dwarfs
[1:14:48] the worse than disneyland characters
[1:14:51] snow white wouldn't take you to hell
[1:14:54] but turning to these spiritual fables
[1:14:57] three gods
[1:15:00] what is that a fable out of hell
[1:15:03] won't disney never come up with that
[1:15:05] demons out of hell
[1:15:07] loosed out of the mouth of the false
[1:15:09] prophet
[1:15:14] and shall be turned unto
[1:15:17] fables you see apostates
[1:15:21] depart from the face
[1:15:24] but not actually from the outward
[1:15:26] profession
[1:15:28] of christianity as we read the scripture
[1:15:31] here in second timothy 3 5 having a form
[1:15:34] of godliness but denying the power of
[1:15:37] thereof so apostates
[1:15:38] will depart from the faith itself
[1:15:43] but not the form of religion
[1:15:47] you believe in hell i sure do you
[1:15:50] believe god so loved the world gave you
[1:15:51] some of god's
[1:15:52] absolutely my favorite scripture in the
[1:15:53] bible
[1:15:55] you believe in moses well i sure do
[1:15:58] jeremiah
[1:15:58] zekel zephana haga malachi zechariah
[1:16:01] absolutely
[1:16:02] matthew mark luke and john absolutely i
[1:16:05] can quote you matthew
[1:16:06] mark luke and john now what about
[1:16:08] malachi 4.
[1:16:10] oh you are them branhamas
[1:16:14] no i'm not i am a child of god
[1:16:20] i am a christian filled with a holy
[1:16:22] ghost
[1:16:23] i'm not known by the name of paul or
[1:16:26] peter or james or william branham or
[1:16:27] even donny reagan we're not reaganites
[1:16:29] here we're christians
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:32] oh my well luke 17 30 revelation 10 1-7
[1:16:37] all that oh oh oh oh
[1:16:43] you see apostate teachers as we look at
[1:16:46] it here
[1:16:47] again in second timothy 4 3 and 4. so
[1:16:50] they will
[1:16:50] turn away but watch now let's skip down
[1:16:52] here and look at jude
[1:16:55] just one chapter of course in verse 4
[1:16:57] for there are certain men
[1:17:00] notice how they got in they crept
[1:17:05] two-legged serpents
[1:17:13] in the original serpent form
[1:17:16] upon two legs instead of licking dust
[1:17:21] they crept in but how do you think they
[1:17:25] crept in
[1:17:26] well in our ranks they crept in carrying
[1:17:27] a book
[1:17:29] or they crept in going into the library
[1:17:31] and getting some tapes
[1:17:32] or they crept in up here and said
[1:17:34] brothers i want to be baptized
[1:17:36] i want to be baptized i wonder how many
[1:17:40] slippery snakes we've dunked down in
[1:17:41] that water
[1:17:44] what they do they crept in in the form
[1:17:47] of religion well
[1:17:50] thank you jesus for there are certain
[1:17:53] men
[1:17:53] crept in unawares
[1:17:57] you talking about a contrast unawares
[1:18:01] to men but notice how he says this
[1:18:04] who were before of old ordained
[1:18:09] to this condemnation unawares to men
[1:18:13] does not mean they're unawares to god
[1:18:19] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[1:18:23] men turning the grace
[1:18:27] of our god into lasciviousness in other
[1:18:30] words
[1:18:31] making the grace and the mercy of god
[1:18:37] a covering for crimes
[1:18:40] and sins and intimidating
[1:18:43] persuading and convincing men
[1:18:46] that they can sin because god
[1:18:49] understands and that's what the blood is
[1:18:53] for
[1:18:55] you sin and then god forgives you and
[1:18:57] then you sin again and god forgives you
[1:18:59] that's what the blood is for
[1:19:02] turning the grace of god into
[1:19:06] lasciviousness
[1:19:10] turning grace into disgrace friends if
[1:19:14] that don't describe
[1:19:15] most of the modern day tv preachers
[1:19:18] well come on now say amen oh
[1:19:22] yes you see it it projects to them the
[1:19:24] idea
[1:19:25] that they can sin safely
[1:19:31] they can do wrong safely that they have
[1:19:33] no fear
[1:19:34] in the sense if you do wrong you'll get
[1:19:36] punished no no no no no no
[1:19:38] these guys turned the grace of god into
[1:19:41] wantonness and lasciviousness and lust
[1:19:44] and they convinced them well you know if
[1:19:46] you sin you're safe you're protected
[1:19:48] because you're in christ jesus
[1:19:50] god can't get you god can't harm you now
[1:19:53] that's what the blood is for
[1:19:54] because you're going to sin true you're
[1:19:55] just going to go ahead and sin and you
[1:19:57] might just go ahead and enjoy it and
[1:19:58] then do it
[1:19:59] and then every day just ask god to
[1:20:00] forgive you because that's what the
[1:20:01] blood is for
[1:20:04] the blood is to release you of that
[1:20:05] desire to sin
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:08] the token life come back and come back
[1:20:10] in you and annihilates that sinful
[1:20:11] nature
[1:20:12] and you're never the same again
[1:20:16] now you're going to make mistakes that's
[1:20:17] right but you ain't going to do it from
[1:20:18] a serpent nature inside of your soul
[1:20:21] but you see these types of preachers and
[1:20:23] teachers
[1:20:24] are preaching to people who he'll still
[1:20:26] have the snake
[1:20:27] in their heart so the serpent is still
[1:20:30] treading in their soul
[1:20:32] and they are smoothing it down and
[1:20:34] convincing them
[1:20:35] they can sin safely
[1:20:38] you're okay you're all right that's why
[1:20:41] it doesn't matter what you look like
[1:20:42] how long have who ever heard a long hair
[1:20:45] in the bible
[1:20:46] anybody's read it very much as why who
[1:20:49] ever heard of what differences it make
[1:20:51] of a woman wears pants or
[1:20:52] or a pantsuit or whatever i think it's
[1:20:54] very fitting for a lot of these women
[1:20:56] are our supposed vice president think
[1:20:59] it's pretty fitting for
[1:21:00] her to have on a pant suit
[1:21:03] uh-huh come on now things it's pretty
[1:21:05] fitting because she's a dominating
[1:21:07] female
[1:21:08] well glory to god same way with hillary
[1:21:10] y'all ever seen hillary in her dress
[1:21:14] it'd be like putting a dress on a hog
[1:21:16] it'd be about the same way some of these
[1:21:17] women wearing a pants that they probably
[1:21:18] don't even own a dress
[1:21:20] because you know what they've got that
[1:21:22] man thing on them that perverted thing
[1:21:23] their spiritual perverts
[1:21:26] that's right oh hallelujah brother
[1:21:28] donald you're going to get in trouble
[1:21:29] what's new about that
[1:21:31] come on tell me something i don't know
[1:21:33] but what is it they turned the grace of
[1:21:35] god
[1:21:36] into lascivious convincing people you
[1:21:38] can sin
[1:21:40] safely
[1:21:43] and god will protect you he understands
[1:21:46] you you can't keep from it
[1:21:48] i agree i agree totally
[1:21:51] for people who aren't born again they
[1:21:53] can't keep from sinning
[1:22:01] is it just me or is it getting warm in
[1:22:03] here
[1:22:05] i'm sweating plum down to my socks man
[1:22:11] notice this verse 8 jude says likewise
[1:22:14] also these filthy
[1:22:18] dreamers defile the flesh
[1:22:22] despise dominion
[1:22:25] so they hate men of god that are called
[1:22:28] to be set
[1:22:29] in the position that god calls him to be
[1:22:33] to have over the body so what do they do
[1:22:36] they despise them
[1:22:40] amen i wonder how many message folks
[1:22:42] will fit into this verse in the book of
[1:22:44] jude
[1:22:46] they despise dominion and speak
[1:22:49] evil of dignities those that are called
[1:22:53] by god and sent by god to lead the sheep
[1:22:56] and they despise their position and
[1:22:58] their rank and say you don't need a
[1:23:04] pastor
[1:23:06] the lord verse 11 he says woe unto them
[1:23:11] woe unto them they have gone
[1:23:15] in the way of cain what is the way of
[1:23:18] cain the selfish life filled with hatred
[1:23:20] and murder
[1:23:21] amen and the way of cain ran
[1:23:25] greedily after the error of
[1:23:29] balaam like balaam trying to make a gang
[1:23:32] of godliness and perish once you notice
[1:23:35] how jude wrote this
[1:23:36] brother west he writes it in such a way
[1:23:39] as if though these
[1:23:40] people now this ain't even come to pass
[1:23:42] yet fully but he
[1:23:44] writes it as if though they have already
[1:23:47] perished
[1:23:50] he writes and takes the form of the word
[1:23:53] and
[1:23:53] uses it in the past tense they're done
[1:23:57] annihilated because jude knows once they
[1:24:01] get to this
[1:24:02] there's no place to get back
[1:24:05] paris not will perish but
[1:24:09] perist and the gang saying of korah
[1:24:12] who thrust himself into the priesthood
[1:24:16] they intervene into the righteous holy
[1:24:21] offices of god which should not be
[1:24:24] entered into without a divine call
[1:24:29] how many businessmen around the message
[1:24:31] churches get up and accept the office of
[1:24:33] pastorship
[1:24:34] ain't a bit more a pastor than a
[1:24:35] groundhog in a hole
[1:24:38] they're a businessman and yet they
[1:24:39] control the church and they run the
[1:24:41] church and tell the
[1:24:42] come on now don't get quiet on me why
[1:24:44] that's what's projected from
[1:24:45] headquarters
[1:24:47] well come on saints don't get quiet if
[1:24:50] it was projected
[1:24:51] apostolic it would be what trying to
[1:24:53] encourage every man of god
[1:24:54] not to sit down on sunday morning and
[1:24:56] play a tape but to
[1:24:58] preach the word preach the word that's
[1:25:01] what brother branham did
[1:25:02] why because he said what paul said
[1:25:06] well hallelujah and somebody that don't
[1:25:08] say that is a liar
[1:25:09] and they're not saying what paul said
[1:25:11] [Applause]
[1:25:14] thank you jesus notice in verse 12 how
[1:25:18] he identifies these people
[1:25:20] these are spots in your
[1:25:24] feast of charity notice where they were
[1:25:26] they were not
[1:25:28] romans they were not pagan romans that
[1:25:32] were out there trying to kill the
[1:25:33] christians but they were
[1:25:34] actually among the message people in the
[1:25:36] first century
[1:25:39] they are spots in your feasts of charity
[1:25:41] when they feast with you so they were
[1:25:43] actually coming in now i've told you
[1:25:44] before
[1:25:45] that the rich people that had large
[1:25:46] houses they would actually have church
[1:25:48] in their houses
[1:25:49] and then after the service was over they
[1:25:51] would have a big meal because many
[1:25:52] christians were poor people
[1:25:54] so they would have their servants out
[1:25:55] there in the kitchens and then prepared
[1:25:56] their meal so they would have what they
[1:25:58] call
[1:25:59] love feast or charity feasts and they
[1:26:01] would come and they would meet together
[1:26:03] one day out of the week
[1:26:04] and they would gather together and
[1:26:05] they'd hear the preaching of the word
[1:26:07] and testimonies and songs and worship
[1:26:09] and then after the service was done
[1:26:10] they'd make a day out of it basically
[1:26:12] all the saints would stay together and
[1:26:14] eat and your jude says they're coming
[1:26:16] together with you they're sitting there
[1:26:18] feeding on the word
[1:26:20] and they're saying amen and then they go
[1:26:22] out there and eat whatever more that
[1:26:23] you've got out there
[1:26:24] and they're sitting right there with you
[1:26:26] acting like they believe every word
[1:26:28] that's being preached
[1:26:32] oh my notice how he says they do feeding
[1:26:36] themselves without
[1:26:39] fear my god
[1:26:45] clouds they are without water
[1:26:49] carried about of winds
[1:26:52] trees whose fruit withereth without
[1:26:56] fruit twice dead notice
[1:26:59] twice dead born dead in humanity now
[1:27:04] their soul has crossed eternal
[1:27:06] separation
[1:27:07] twice dead
[1:27:14] oh my goodness friends how you ought to
[1:27:16] thank god today
[1:27:18] for his truth and his grace to us
[1:27:21] brother donnie i'm not perfect i'm not
[1:27:23] blaming myself i make mistakes but the
[1:27:24] spirit of god deals with me you ought to
[1:27:26] be shouting all over this whole building
[1:27:27] tonight
[1:27:28] the spirit of god's dealing with you you
[1:27:30] ought to be so grateful that he is
[1:27:32] amen because people that are twice dead
[1:27:35] are beyond redemption
[1:27:37] twice dead plucked up by the roots
[1:27:41] raging waves of the sea
[1:27:44] foaming out their own shame
[1:27:47] wandering stars to whom is reserved
[1:27:51] the blackness of darkness
[1:27:54] forever remember when brother branham
[1:27:57] went there as a boy
[1:28:00] he said a burning hell would have been
[1:28:04] a pleasure can you imagine
[1:28:08] he was falling and falling and falling
[1:28:11] in the smoke
[1:28:12] and in the darkness and these beings
[1:28:16] were coming out
[1:28:19] haunting him can you imagine an
[1:28:22] individual
[1:28:23] saying that burning flames would have
[1:28:25] been a pleasure
[1:28:28] can you imagine every person that goes
[1:28:30] out that set here in our assembly
[1:28:34] that have become these apostates
[1:28:38] every sermon they heard me preach every
[1:28:41] sermon that had brother daryl preached
[1:28:43] ever quote they ever quoted you imagine
[1:28:46] as they're there for thousands of years
[1:28:48] or however long
[1:28:49] this will be the amplified part
[1:28:52] of their torment this same man they're
[1:28:55] now calling a false prophet
[1:28:57] it's like they will hear his voice over
[1:29:00] and over in hell
[1:29:04] in hell part of their torment they will
[1:29:07] recall setting in happy valley church
[1:29:10] clapping their hands singing worshiping
[1:29:13] seeing themselves
[1:29:14] worship don't you remember the rich man
[1:29:18] in luke when jesus gave the parable
[1:29:20] and he showed part of his torment with
[1:29:23] his human memory
[1:29:24] his human memory of life
[1:29:28] his human memory of what he could have
[1:29:30] done do you think it's just going to be
[1:29:31] oh
[1:29:32] oh worship in the drunk oh i wish i had
[1:29:34] done this part of their torment
[1:29:36] will be every tape they've ever heard
[1:29:39] part of their torment whatever man of
[1:29:41] god
[1:29:41] every alder called that was made and
[1:29:43] they sat there and held them to the back
[1:29:45] of the pew
[1:29:46] and refused it and the spirit of god
[1:29:47] dealt with their heart they will hear me
[1:29:49] preach through the ages
[1:29:53] oh god
[1:30:00] but for those of you who take what i
[1:30:02] preach what brother branham preached
[1:30:04] what with the daryl brother wes
[1:30:05] his other brothers here preach and
[1:30:08] eternity you won't hear me preaching
[1:30:10] every day

[1:30:15] that
[1:30:15] me too me too eternal retirement praise
[1:30:20] be to god
[1:30:21] but can you imagine them people in the
[1:30:23] other realm
[1:30:24] they are hearing me over and over again
[1:30:26] how many of them i sit right there in
[1:30:28] that office and warn them don't do this
[1:30:30] don't do it i beg you in the name of
[1:30:32] jesus don't go that way
[1:30:33] don't do it over the dolly ain't going
[1:30:35] to ain't going to be right there
[1:30:37] knowing my heart to fix it dude
[1:30:41] and walk out the door and kill said do
[1:30:42] you think they believed you i said no
[1:30:44] they didn't believe me and you just
[1:30:47] remember from this day on they'll go
[1:30:49] down oh lord god children
[1:30:55] don't you see how much he loves us to
[1:30:57] give us grace
[1:30:59] and correct us when we're wrong and give
[1:31:02] us the spirit and say lord god i want to
[1:31:04] be wrong
[1:31:05] lord god i want to be right don't let me
[1:31:07] go in my ways god
[1:31:09] don't let me turn the grace of god the
[1:31:11] precious grace of god
[1:31:14] into lasciviousness and it become a
[1:31:16] license for people to sin
[1:31:18] and they can actually sin and feel
[1:31:21] safe in doing so because i preached
[1:31:25] false doctrine to them and convinced
[1:31:28] them thus
[1:31:32] lord god
[1:31:36] let's read this someone close verse 16
[1:31:40] these are murmurers
[1:31:43] complainers walking after their own lust
[1:31:47] and their mouth
[1:31:48] speaking great swelling words
[1:31:51] having men's person in admiration
[1:31:56] because of advantage
[1:32:02] may god help us we'll have one thing in
[1:32:06] our hearts
[1:32:08] the lord jesus in his word
[1:32:11] stand with me and let me read this to
[1:32:13] you again in second timothy 3 1
[1:32:15] when paul says this this no also on the
[1:32:17] last days perilous times shall come
[1:32:18] we'll pick it up again lord willing next
[1:32:20] week
[1:32:21] but the word translated perilous means
[1:32:25] violent
[1:32:26] fierce wild difficult
[1:32:31] grievous hard to bear
[1:32:35] distressing now believe it or not it's
[1:32:39] the exact
[1:32:40] same word that's used in matthew 8
[1:32:43] 28 when it describes
[1:32:46] the maniac of gabra
[1:32:50] so it's describing this maniac
[1:32:54] it's the same word perilous describing
[1:32:57] this man
[1:32:58] that was so demon possessed that he
[1:33:00] would cut himself
[1:33:03] so look what paul is saying in the last
[1:33:05] days
[1:33:07] that people will believe doctrines of
[1:33:10] demons so much
[1:33:12] it will become in the last days a
[1:33:15] demonic
[1:33:16] graveyard
[1:33:21] so people will run around in these
[1:33:24] doctrines of devils and you try to talk
[1:33:26] to them
[1:33:26] don't go that way don't go that way and
[1:33:28] they just smile at you and go right on
[1:33:30] and do what they're going to do
[1:33:33] just as in gadara friends we are rubbing
[1:33:37] shoulders with
[1:33:40] demon possessed people as it was
[1:33:45] in the time of the maniac from ghatera
[1:33:50] oh god help us how much longer lord
[1:33:55] how much longer we got to live here
[1:33:58] in these tombs
[1:34:03] now let's just say
[1:34:07] that they prove there was not enough
[1:34:12] tampering with the vote and all of that
[1:34:14] to change the election
[1:34:16] mr biden and miss harris get voted in
[1:34:21] and they get inaugurated and all this
[1:34:23] and that and the other
[1:34:25] what's going to happen to all the hatred
[1:34:28] that's been shown for the
[1:34:30] conservatives and for trump and his
[1:34:32] people
[1:34:33] wonder where all that hatred is going to
[1:34:35] go to because you know they're going to
[1:34:36] express it toward biden we don't
[1:34:37] see that they're not going to express it
[1:34:40] toward the left aoc can do whatever she
[1:34:42] wants to do and whatever say and
[1:34:43] everybody just thinks it's a-okay with
[1:34:46] aoc
[1:34:48] but it ain't okay with me i don't care
[1:34:50] if it is aoc
[1:34:53] praise the lord so where's that hatred
[1:34:56] gonna go you reckon
[1:34:57] don't you understand that something has
[1:34:59] happened in the last few years
[1:35:01] that people have been able through the
[1:35:03] the media
[1:35:04] through facebook through all these
[1:35:06] different things express
[1:35:07] hatred and express such things where is
[1:35:11] all this coming from the demons that was
[1:35:14] in gadara
[1:35:16] are here the violent protests that we're
[1:35:20] sending and burning businesses and all
[1:35:22] that
[1:35:22] what is it spirit of the last days
[1:35:26] you imagine how the people in the days
[1:35:28] of jesus must have become so overwhelmed
[1:35:32] that jesus would speak and in nazareth
[1:35:35] they would pick up rocks to stone him
[1:35:37] and they're looking over there and
[1:35:38] that's the quietest man you've ever seen
[1:35:40] in your life
[1:35:40] his temperament is so mild and meek and
[1:35:43] all of a sudden he's standing with a
[1:35:45] rock in his hand
[1:35:46] and over his old sister so-and-so why
[1:35:48] she ain't never been violent a day in
[1:35:50] her life
[1:35:51] but all of a sudden they're getting so
[1:35:52] violent they're getting so angry
[1:35:54] they're calling names they're just
[1:35:56] saying all this terrible terrible stuff
[1:35:58] you say
[1:35:58] what is it they were getting under the
[1:36:00] spirit of their last days
[1:36:08] but what did jesus tell his followers
[1:36:11] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:36:14] when they cast your name out as evil
[1:36:16] rejoice why he didn't want his followers
[1:36:19] to get under that spirit
[1:36:20] whichever spirit you get under it's
[1:36:23] going to crown
[1:36:24] you you get under hatred oh that hurt my
[1:36:27] friend and said well the bible tells us
[1:36:29] what to do
[1:36:30] pray for them turn the other cheek oh
[1:36:32] it's easy for you to say
[1:36:33] you don't have a clue do you you do not
[1:36:36] have a clue what i go through
[1:36:39] no you don't the deacons don't
[1:36:42] the trustees don't my wife don't
[1:36:47] if god did not help me i would be the
[1:36:49] most
[1:36:50] violent man you've ever met in your life
[1:36:53] i would have so much hatred in me
[1:36:56] tonight
[1:36:57] it would spill out of me
[1:37:00] but it came i've got the holy ghost
[1:37:08] when message preachers will lie on you
[1:37:11] when message preachers that you all
[1:37:12] listen to
[1:37:14] have lied on me and said things against
[1:37:16] me
[1:37:18] oh i could tell you i could call names i
[1:37:20] and what good was that do
[1:37:22] then i lower myself to their level
[1:37:25] but i refuse to hate i know not one
[1:37:28] individual in this world
[1:37:30] that i hate not one that i want to say
[1:37:32] go to hell
[1:37:33] well praise the lord why
[1:37:36] i want to be like jesus now a lot of our
[1:37:39] preachers want to be like jesus and
[1:37:40] healing the sick and raise them dead and
[1:37:42] casting out devils and sin visions
[1:37:43] that's fine that's well and good too but
[1:37:45] i'm going to turn the other cheek like
[1:37:46] jesus
[1:37:47] i want to pray for them that
[1:37:48] despitefully use me like jesus
[1:37:51] anybody in here want to be like jesus
[1:37:56] well this is part of the spirit of the
[1:37:59] last days what is it satan's
[1:38:01] personifying himself so much in his
[1:38:03] church hell
[1:38:05] is embodying itself as it presses its
[1:38:07] gates
[1:38:08] into humanity and when all hell
[1:38:11] turns loose all heaven comes down
[1:38:17] praise god
[1:38:20] so which spirit are you finding yourself
[1:38:22] yielding to
[1:38:23] getting even with so and so they run me
[1:38:25] down i'll tell you one thing i'll get
[1:38:26] them back if it's the last thing i do
[1:38:28] that's not the spirit of god friends
[1:38:30] love does not keep a record
[1:38:33] it does not keep her i'll get them back
[1:38:35] you need to repent of that
[1:38:37] that is not the spirit of god forgive
[1:38:40] them oh they haven't asked me
[1:38:42] oh really so where did the roman
[1:38:45] soldiers ask the lord jesus to forgive
[1:38:48] him for crucifying him
[1:38:52] answer me they did not
[1:38:55] but from his person he said father
[1:38:59] forgive them for they don't know
[1:39:03] what they do come on happy valley church
[1:39:06] how many wants to walk this walk carry
[1:39:09] this cross
[1:39:11] be like jesus this way
[1:39:14] amen don't you love him with all your
[1:39:16] heart
[1:39:18] oh my this is the spirit that is
[1:39:20] expecting his bride
[1:39:22] to become in so much that his
[1:39:26] own life will be manifested among her
[1:39:28] and his word will be made flesh
[1:39:31] in her when her very flesh
[1:39:34] is going to become the word
[1:39:40] think of it the word was made flesh and
[1:39:44] dwelt among us
[1:39:45] there's another promise that's got to
[1:39:47] connect with john 1 14
[1:39:49] when the word is becoming flesh and
[1:39:52] flesh
[1:39:53] is becoming word you say what are you
[1:39:57] talking about
[1:39:57] i'm talking about the resurrection and
[1:39:59] the rapture
[1:40:02] to where our flesh one day will become
[1:40:06] spoken word of god
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:11] thank you lord jesus but you see what
[1:40:15] precedes that
[1:40:16] the word must be made flesh in us
[1:40:19] in the work of incarnation that started
[1:40:21] 2 000 years ago don't think it stopped
[1:40:23] with mary
[1:40:24] she was the beginning we're the
[1:40:26] culmination
[1:40:28] of that great immaculate thing
[1:40:31] and when it becomes the word becomes
[1:40:33] flesh and a bride around the world and
[1:40:34] the fullness of the godhead body is
[1:40:36] represented to the bride
[1:40:37] and the moment of the old glory to god
[1:40:40] in the moment the consummation of it
[1:40:42] reaches and the trump of god
[1:40:43] sounds our flesh will change
[1:40:46] you may be standing there combing your
[1:40:48] hair brushing your teeth and our flesh
[1:40:50] will change
[1:40:51] and become the word don't tell me you're
[1:40:54] not familiar with that quote invisible
[1:40:55] union
[1:40:56] when flesh is becoming the word
[1:41:00] don't you understand this is what it is
[1:41:02] in you crying you're crying for
[1:41:03] perfection and you're living an
[1:41:05] imperfect body this is what you're
[1:41:06] crying for
[1:41:08] when your flesh will become the word
[1:41:11] amen praise god
[1:41:15] oh thank you lord jesus
[1:41:19] oh heavenly father
[1:41:24] lord god i pray you would help us
[1:41:25] tonight
[1:41:28] lord jesus forgive
[1:41:31] lord if there's anything tonight that
[1:41:33] we're holding on to that's wrong
[1:41:36] lord if there's any saying any error and
[1:41:39] our walk and our belief system
[1:41:42] and our doctrine correct us by
[1:41:46] your word lord but father if there's
[1:41:49] error in our spirit
[1:41:52] error in our attitude we want that taken
[1:41:56] away just like false doctrine
[1:42:00] lord we don't want to blame our ishmael
[1:42:02] and say well god made me this way
[1:42:05] oh how we have to watch that thing
[1:42:09] this is the agenda that many of the
[1:42:12] homosexuals say
[1:42:14] well god made me this way
[1:42:17] so how can god judge me if he made me
[1:42:20] this way
[1:42:22] father we do not want to take our
[1:42:23] weaknesses of our flesh and our old
[1:42:25] carnal thing that we inherited from our
[1:42:28] families and say well god made me this
[1:42:30] way
[1:42:31] well if god is perfectly happy and
[1:42:33] accepted
[1:42:34] with the way we are with our tempers and
[1:42:36] this and that and the other
[1:42:37] then preachers are wasting their time
[1:42:39] preaching against it
[1:42:42] if you made us the way we are and you
[1:42:44] want to leave us with our tempers and
[1:42:46] our upsetness and this and that
[1:42:48] then why in the world are you making me
[1:42:50] and the rest these preachers preach
[1:42:51] against it
[1:42:54] help us to understand lord much of what
[1:42:56] we are
[1:42:58] is not what you made us your prophet
[1:43:01] told us we become the nature
[1:43:03] of one behind us i inherited reagan
[1:43:07] traits i
[1:43:08] inherited show traits i inherited guffy
[1:43:11] traits way behind me
[1:43:13] many of them things are not made by you
[1:43:16] they are
[1:43:16] ungodly they are unruly
[1:43:20] and it takes the preaching of the word
[1:43:22] and me applying it to my life to help
[1:43:24] bring that old thing
[1:43:26] subject or i can hide behind the excuse
[1:43:29] well god made me this way
[1:43:33] lord god you never made me to be mean
[1:43:37] you never made me to be ill-tempered you
[1:43:40] never made me oh god to be anything
[1:43:42] contrary to your word
[1:43:44] so where does it come from my mama my
[1:43:47] daddy
[1:43:48] my uncles my grandparents
[1:43:52] oh jesus help us to be changed lord
[1:43:56] give us a desire father
[1:43:59] amen how many in this place should raise
[1:44:01] your hand to god tonight and say lord
[1:44:03] make me like you father remember friends
[1:44:07] we're not talking about perfecting our
[1:44:09] human flesh
[1:44:10] but we're talking about making it
[1:44:12] subject that part about your human
[1:44:14] makeup
[1:44:15] that is wrong don't you think for one
[1:44:18] minute
[1:44:19] that almighty god made you that way is
[1:44:21] going to leave you that way
[1:44:23] how could god make you with a temper
[1:44:27] strong enough to fight a buzzsaw and
[1:44:29] then convict you for displaying what he
[1:44:31] made you to have
[1:44:33] how could god make you men to be full of
[1:44:35] lust
[1:44:36] and then you lust after women and then
[1:44:38] god convict you for lusting
[1:44:40] come on somebody wake up let's face the
[1:44:43] facts and god never made
[1:44:45] much of what we are the way we are we
[1:44:47] inherited it
[1:44:49] out of the grab bag of humanity
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:44:53] but satan will do his best to try to
[1:44:55] convince you your ishmael
[1:44:57] that's what many of you are still
[1:44:59] thinking this is why you hide behind
[1:45:00] well god made me this way i don't have
[1:45:02] to change
[1:45:03] this is the way i am god made me loud
[1:45:05] mouth god made me don't you blame that
[1:45:07] stuff on god
[1:45:11] well praise the lord
[1:45:14] god wants us to change to be conformed
[1:45:18] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:45:22] the firstborn
[1:45:24] among many brethren
