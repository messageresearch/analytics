[13:03] me tonight in faith, believing that'll
[13:06] happen and and do that with your own
[13:08] need. Um as we've been told so many
[13:11] times, the prophet said, "It's a
[13:12] finished work." You need healing in your
[13:14] body, that body is right there. that
[13:16] whale body is right there in front of
[13:18] you. You just walk to it. So, let's
[13:20] let's take these needs uh to him
[13:23] tonight. Heavenly Father, we're so
[13:24] grateful, Lord, that we have a place
[13:26] that we can come to, Lord, to bring our
[13:28] needs before you, to bring the the the
[13:30] cares of our life to you, Father. Lord,
[13:33] this this week, I've been thinking of
[13:34] the service that we had here Sunday,
[13:37] Lord. uh the the things Lord that were
[13:40] brought out of the things in our life
[13:41] father that you know when we call
[13:44] ourselves Christian we say we are
[13:45] Christlike and the things that we have
[13:48] in our life Lord that are unlike that
[13:50] Lord the prophet said that so many times
[13:52] that leads to us not receiving the
[13:55] healing that we need the the things Lord
[13:57] that that come between that healing that
[13:59] blessing Father is things that that we
[14:01] carry in our life Lord help us to to to
[14:05] drop those Lord as as our brother was
[14:07] preaching Sunday, Lord, and the
[14:08] bitterness, the grudges, the the the
[14:10] spite, Lord, anything that we would have
[14:12] against another brother or sister.
[14:14] Father, Lord, that could that could be
[14:16] the thing that's keeping us from
[14:18] receiving what we've asked for. Lord,
[14:20] help us to get in the same the one mind
[14:22] and one accord as we're in the upper
[14:23] room. The Bible says they received all
[14:25] of them received the Holy Ghost because
[14:27] they were all in one mind and one
[14:29] accord, Father. Lord, I pray that the
[14:32] bride would get that way around the
[14:33] world, Father, and that's what would
[14:35] bring your coming. I pray that these
[14:36] needs, Lord, have been brought before
[14:38] you tonight, Lord. We lay them at your
[14:39] feet. There's nothing we could do within
[14:41] within ourselves, Lord. Lord, we're
[14:44] where it would be impossible, Lord. But
[14:46] with with you, all things are possible.
[14:48] Lord, we invite you tonight. We welcome
[14:50] you here tonight, Lord. Help us to
[14:52] remove anything in our hearts, our
[14:54] minds, anything that we want to do
[14:55] later, what we're going to do tomorrow.
[14:57] Father, and focus only right now on what
[14:59] we're given to you, Lord. May we worship
[15:01] you and praise you with everything
[15:03] that's within us, Lord. Bless the
[15:04] service. Bless the the musicians, the
[15:07] singers, Lord. But anoint brother Aaron
[15:09] the Lord. And Lord, I pray as Brother
[15:11] Donnie comes, Lord, that you would get
[15:12] him out of the way that you can use the
[15:14] gift, Lord, that you placed in his life.
[15:16] Speak to your bride. Lord, this is your
[15:18] time. We give it to you. We thank you

[27:07] Why the king would choose to be
[27:12] be a baby [music and singing]
[27:14] born to die.
[27:18] [music]
[27:24] [music]
[27:26] And all fell silent
[27:29] for the cry of a man in the voice of God
[27:34] [music] was dividing history
[27:37] for those with eyes to
[27:39] [music and singing] see the sun would
[27:40] shine
[27:42] from earth at night
[27:45] and the angels [music and singing]
[27:47] filled the sky.
[27:50] of [music and singing] heaven. Wonder
[27:53] why
[27:56] [music] the king would choose to be.
[28:01] Be a baby born [music]
[28:04] for me.
[28:07] A baby born to die to break [music] the
[28:12] chains of guilt [singing] and sin.
[28:17] Find us here to [music and singing] pull
[28:20] us in. So we can join [music]
[28:24] in heaven [singing] song. And with one
[28:28] voice around the throne. [music]
[28:36] All the angels [music and singing]
[28:38] fill the sky.
[28:41] And I can't help but [music and singing]
[28:43] wonder why
[28:46] why this king would choose to
[28:49] [music and singing] be
[28:52] be a baby born for me.
[28:57] Be a [music and singing] baby born to
[29:01] die.
[29:03] All the angels [music] fill the sky.
[29:08] And I can't help but [singing] wonder
[29:11] why.
[29:13] Why [music] this king would choose
[29:16] [singing] to be
[29:19] [music] a baby born for me.
[29:24] Be a [singing] baby born [music]
[29:27] to die.
[29:30] Be a [singing] baby born
[29:35] [music] to die. [singing]

[29:49] specials tonight. Let's just stand as we
[29:51] change the order of service. Amen. How
[29:53] many come with expectant heart tonight?

[30:00] knows. And I mean the Lord can [music]
[30:01] touch each and every heart gathered here
[30:02] tonight. Let's just sing this little
[30:04] course to him. Amen. As [music] brother
[30:06] Donnie would come. Jesus, draw me close.

[30:31] Let [singing and music] the world around
[30:34] me fade [singing]
[30:37] away.
[30:41] [singing]
[30:44] Jesus, [music]
[30:45] draw me close,
[30:50] closer, [music and singing]
[30:52] Lord,

[31:40] [music]
[31:46] [music]
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[31:51] I [music] deserve
[31:53] to worship and
[31:57] [music]
[32:01] praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Before
[32:04] we read the scripture tonight, um I want
[32:06] us to pray kind of kind of soon. Um
[32:10] brother Timberad had text me this
[32:12] afternoon and his wife had had a a heart
[32:15] attack today and uh she's in the
[32:18] hospital and he text me just a few
[32:20] minutes ago before I came out and said
[32:23] that she's in a lot of pain. They've put
[32:25] a patch so nitro I suppose on her and
[32:30] they're going to look at doing a maybe
[32:32] possibly a stent whatever tomorrow but
[32:34] he said she's in severe pain right now.
[32:37] How many else has a need on your heart
[32:39] and life tonight? All right. Can we just
[32:41] pray together as we pray over the word
[32:43] and pray for our sister?
[32:46] Lord Jesus, we believe that you're
[32:48] present help to us in the time of need.
[32:50] Dear God, you see our sister Bdette.
[32:54] Lord, I know it must have been very
[32:55] pressing for brother Tim to text and ask
[32:59] for prayer. Lord, we're grateful that we
[33:02] have you that we can come to in the time
[33:05] of such need. Lord Jesus, you see what's
[33:08] going on in our body and just not that
[33:11] many weeks ago having another episode.
[33:14] And Father, we're just praying that
[33:16] you'd move forward. We believe in
[33:18] doctors. We believe in medicine. We
[33:20] believe in all that, Lord. and we thank
[33:22] you for the things they can do. But we
[33:24] know many times they don't know what to
[33:26] do. But we're praying right now in the
[33:28] name of Jesus. May the spirit of God go
[33:31] to that hospital where she is. May the
[33:34] angels of the Lord be present, Father.
[33:37] And we know that you've designated
[33:40] healing angels when it comes to the
[33:42] administration of it to your saints. May
[33:45] you move for our sister tonight, Lord.
[33:48] You saw the hands that were uplifted,
[33:50] the requests that laid beneath those
[33:52] hands and the desires. Father, this
[33:55] prayer calls that I have in my hand
[33:56] tonight, the sister Lord and writing in
[34:00] and meeting this for her children and
[34:02] the request about the grandchildren. You
[34:05] know all about it, Father. We committed
[34:07] to you tonight. I pray that you'd help
[34:10] us, Lord, as we look into your word, oh
[34:14] Jesus. We know that your word is the
[34:16] fountain of great understanding for us
[34:19] and it brings illumination and help.
[34:22] Help me tonight, Father, that I can get
[34:24] out of the way. And may our hearts be so
[34:27] open to receive from you, dear God, I
[34:30] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[34:33] Amen.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm happy to be in the
[34:37] house of the Lord tonight.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Privilege for us, isn't it, to be
[34:41] gathered together.
[34:44] First Kings chapter 17:E9.
[34:48] The Lord has a different way of dealing
[34:50] with me. He'll let me study for days and
[34:53] hours, look at hundreds of quotes on a
[34:57] direction that I think is what I'm
[34:59] preaching on Wednesday night or Sunday
[35:01] morning.
[35:03] And then he'll wait till Wednesday
[35:05] afternoon
[35:07] and say, "No, Donnie, that's not it."
[35:12] So that's the way he done me this
[35:13] evening.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; So I've been sweating bullets ever
[35:18] since.
[35:20] First Kings 17:9.
[35:24] I want to speak to you tonight on being
[35:26] certain of God.
[35:30] Arise, get thee to Zerapath,
[35:33] which belongth to Zidon,
[35:36] and dwell there. Behold, I have
[35:40] commanded
[35:42] a widow woman there to sustain thee. I
[35:46] have commanded a widow woman there to
[35:49] sustain thee. So he arose and went to
[35:52] Zarapath. And when he came to the gate
[35:56] of the city,
[35:58] behold the widow woman, the
[36:02] widow woman, not one of many, but the
[36:06] &gt;&gt; widow woman. Now, this is why I believe
[36:09] about prophecy. God deals on both ends.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it's dark and deep and
[36:16] mysterious and all that sort of thing
[36:17] and it's guess and happen stance. No, I
[36:20] I believe this is the way God wants it
[36:22] to be.
[36:23] And the widow woman was there gathering
[36:26] sticks. And he called to her and said,
[36:29] "Fetch me,
[36:31] fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in
[36:35] a vessel that I may drink." And as she
[36:39] was going to fetch it, don't you love
[36:41] that vernacular?
[36:43] Fetch.
[36:45] He called to her and said, "Bring me, I
[36:49] pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine
[36:53] hand." Now remember what the Lord told
[36:56] him. The Lord told him, "I have
[36:58] commanded a widow woman to sustain
[37:02] thee." So it's not unusual then for him
[37:05] to ask for bread and water.
[37:09] You imagine what he thought whenever
[37:11] this woman answers him
[37:14] and she said, "As the Lord thy God
[37:17] liveth,
[37:19] I have not a cake,
[37:22] but a handful
[37:25] of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in
[37:29] a cruise.
[37:31] And behold, I'm gathering two sticks
[37:34] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[37:38] my son that we may eat it
[37:42] and die.
[37:46] You imagine Elijah thinking,
[37:49] &gt;&gt; "God, you sent me to a woman.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; She's got one handful of meal and a
[37:55] little bit of oil and her and a boy's
[37:57] going to eat this and they're dying. and
[38:00] you sent me to a woman to sustain me
[38:03] who's on the very verge of starvation
[38:05] herself.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you love God's ways?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; They're very confusing.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. It's the
[38:15] truth.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes at times he tells you
[38:17] something, his word, and you think,
[38:19] really?
[38:21] And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not.
[38:26] Go and do as thou hast said,
[38:29] but make me
[38:33] thereof a little cake first,
[38:38] and bring it to me, and after make for
[38:42] thee and thy son.
[38:46] Here we go. For thus saith the Lord God
[38:51] of Israel,
[38:54] the barrel of meal shall not waste,
[38:58] neither shall the crus of oil fail until
[39:02] the day that the Lord sendeth rain
[39:06] upon the earth. May the Lord bless his
[39:09] word. You may be seated.
[39:18] He must have noticed it for
[39:22] several days.
[39:25] He kept getting a little bit more hungry
[39:27] every day.
[39:31] And probably he noticed that his mama
[39:34] wouldn't eaten every day.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And he felt himself getting weaker.
[39:42] and he wondered what's what's mama going
[39:45] to do.
[39:47] Now remember this was a widow woman but
[39:49] she had a son and as any true mother
[39:53] would have done in a situation like
[39:56] this. No doubt this mother the way I
[40:00] remember seeing my mother cuz we was
[40:03] raised poor. And I remember mama
[40:08] fixing supper for us little Reagan kids.
[40:12] But mama not being hungry,
[40:15] which I found that hard to believe at
[40:17] the time
[40:18] &gt;&gt; and I didn't understand
[40:20] cuz I wasn't a parent yet.
[40:24] So you imagine this little fella as he's
[40:26] looking around and this is the last
[40:29] night. Now she knows
[40:31] that after this there's nothing else
[40:34] left.
[40:36] And this woman is not a Hebrew.
[40:39] She is not a Jew.
[40:42] She is a gentile.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; She must have put him to bed early. And
[40:49] she herself as she laid there, it was so
[40:53] hot and dry
[40:56] because the famine had been there for
[40:59] quite some time.
[41:01] And she was now in in another part. She
[41:04] wasn't even in the land of Israel, but
[41:07] in a bordering place.
[41:10] But the famine was so dire that even
[41:13] other countries were starting to
[41:15] experience it
[41:17] and are laying there thinking
[41:19] tomorrow will be our last meal.
[41:23] Maybe the little boy said, "Mama,
[41:25] when can we have some more vegetables?
[41:29] Mama, what about dates and and dried
[41:32] fruits? Maybe Oh, honey, maybe. Yeah,
[41:37] maybe. We we we'll try to we'll try to
[41:39] do that. We we'll try to we'll see if
[41:43] something will work out. But you imagine
[41:45] as she lay there nod
[41:48] and the tears rolling out of her eyes
[41:50] realizing
[41:52] tomorrow will be our last meal.
[41:55] I've got one handful left
[41:58] and it'll make maybe one little hoake.
[42:00] How many of y'all know what a ho cake
[42:02] is? I feel sorry for the rest of you
[42:04] Yankees then.
[42:08] and her thinking in her mind that one
[42:11] little handful of meal and just a little
[42:14] bit of oil,
[42:16] it won't go very far.
[42:19] So, the only thing I know to do is just
[42:22] we'll eat it and I'm going to break the
[42:25] news to him. Son,
[42:28] I hate to tell you, but we're going to
[42:30] die. But now, wait a minute.
[42:34] Didn't God say
[42:36] he had already commanded a widow woman
[42:38] to feed Elijah?
[42:42] What I find amazing about that statement
[42:44] is
[42:45] she didn't even know it yet.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; You see, the way God's word is, God can
[42:52] say something and the people on the
[42:54] earth to fulfill it and they don't even
[42:58] know yet. They're called to fulfill it.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that cuz I think that's me
[43:02] and you.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; I wonder what God's got on his mind for
[43:06] us that we don't even know yet is our
[43:09] word. This was her word. Had she knew
[43:14] that word was hers, she could have
[43:18] rejoiced and been so happy. She wouldn't
[43:21] have understood how it was going to come
[43:22] to pass. But she would have known
[43:24] somehow God was going to make a way.
[43:29] Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; You imagine her as she lay there in the
[43:32] night and many of you have been hungry
[43:34] before and you you wake up and you can't
[43:38] wait for you to be able to get up and
[43:39] eat some breakfast or get a snack or
[43:42] something another. Probably most of us
[43:45] didn't experience what she had. And it
[43:49] was so painful, not only just in her own
[43:52] body, but to see a little boy. Pull him
[43:56] up close to her. Honey, it's going to be
[43:58] all right. The Lord God is going to do
[44:01] something for us. Now, what I find
[44:03] amazing is that this woman whenever she
[44:06] spoke to Elijah and she said, "As the
[44:09] Lord thy God
[44:11] liveth
[44:13] and she calls him by his Hebrew
[44:16] revelatory name, capital L, capital O,
[44:20] capital R, capital D." Who told her
[44:24] that?
[44:27] That name was secret.
[44:30] That name was made known to Abraham and
[44:33] his seed.
[44:36] And yet when she spoke to Elijah, now I
[44:39] want you to notice also that she
[44:41] recognized the Elijah ministry.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[44:47] and
[44:47] &gt;&gt; she recognized that he was God's
[44:49] prophet.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, it also spoke
[44:54] complimentary about her because God
[44:58] would have never sent him to a house
[45:02] that would not have matched him.
[45:06] That makes me feel pretty good as well.
[45:09] [laughter]
[45:10] You know why God don't send this message
[45:13] to everybody? Cuz they ain't a perfect
[45:15] fit for an Elijah ministry.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I fit this word. Aren't you?
[45:20] And what I don't fit yet, he'll mold and
[45:22] shape me till I do fit.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Now watch as she now enters
[45:30] in and the daylight maybe is just broken
[45:33] through the window
[45:35] and she realizes today without something
[45:40] happening,
[45:41] it will be the final day. There's no
[45:45] more food.
[45:46] Nobody in the city has hardly anything
[45:49] to eat. And if they did, only the rich
[45:53] would be able to get it.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; So she's finally resolved to accept it.
[46:00] Today is the final day. Notice now again
[46:04] in verse 10. So he rose and went to
[46:07] Zarapath. And when he came to the gate
[46:09] of the city, behold, the widow woman was
[46:12] there gathering of sticks. And he called
[46:15] to her and said, "Fetch me, I pray, that
[46:17] a little water in a vessel that I may
[46:19] drink." And as she was going to fetch
[46:22] it, he called to her and said, "Bring
[46:24] me, I pray, thee, a morsel of bread in
[46:27] thy hand." Now notice her response now.
[46:30] And she said, "As the
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[46:35] &gt;&gt; thy God
[46:38] &gt;&gt; liveth."
[46:40] Now, how does she know the Lord is his
[46:42] God?
[46:46] Now, reckon she done a YouTube check.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Reckon she checked all the local papers
[46:52] in Jeffersonville. I I mean, uh,
[46:54] Jerusalem or wherever, to do a
[46:56] background check on on this guy and see
[47:00] if she could find out if he was a true
[47:01] prophet or a false one.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Now, just in case you're curious, I
[47:05] couldn't find this story to be
[47:07] vindicated in the Courier Journal about
[47:09] this widow.
[47:11] I
[47:11] &gt;&gt; I couldn't find it in Snoops or Snopes
[47:13] or Snoopies or anywhere else to make
[47:15] sure that this is actually factual, but
[47:18] the Bible tells me and that's all I need
[47:21] to know.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Now, watch how this woman is showing
[47:31] already that she matches this prophet
[47:35] and his message. As the Lord thy God
[47:38] livest, I have not a cake, but a handful
[47:41] of meal in a a barrel, and a little oil
[47:46] in a cruise. And behold, I'm going I'm
[47:49] gathering two sticks, that I may go
[47:52] dress it for me and my son, that we may
[47:55] eat it and die.
[47:58] Now, watch this. How the prophet brings
[48:01] into view about characters of the Old
[48:04] Testament and us as well. This is Be
[48:07] Certain of God in 1959. If you haven't
[48:09] listened to it, I would highly recommend
[48:11] it. I listen to it about six times
[48:13] today. So, I think it'd do you good. You
[48:16] know, when we have confessed our sins
[48:19] and met every requirement that God
[48:22] requires, we believed on God and there's
[48:25] circumstances that has to be met and
[48:28] according to his will and we've
[48:30] confessed our sins and we've made all
[48:33] the wrongs that we've did right and done
[48:36] everything we know how to do. Now listen
[48:38] how he keeps emphasizing this through
[48:41] this message. So there's certain things
[48:44] that God requires. And if there's
[48:47] unconfessed sin or things that needs to
[48:50] be fixed in your life, then before God's
[48:52] going to move for you 100% in that
[48:55] avenue, you got to fix it. So he said,
[48:58] "Every requirement that God has made or
[49:01] ask, we have met the requirement and yet
[49:05] he lays silent and just won't answer us.
[49:12] Anybody ever been there
[49:14] &gt;&gt; to where you'd done everything that you
[49:17] knew to do and God is silent
[49:21] &gt;&gt; and maybe you set an interview with
[49:23] brother JD to come and talk to me or or
[49:26] you'll run into one of the other
[49:27] ministers out in the parking lot and you
[49:29] said, "Brother, I'm just having a hard
[49:31] time. Would you pray for me?" And they
[49:33] pray for you and it seemed like their
[49:34] prayer never even left the parking lot.
[49:37] and you come and talk to me and I'll
[49:38] talk to you about this and that and the
[49:40] other and I did my best and you walked
[49:42] out and I say I can't believe brother
[49:45] Donnie didn't even help me. People told
[49:47] me they went in there and boy they flew
[49:49] out that door nearly they just got so
[49:51] blessed. I went in there and sat down
[49:53] and Lord I don't know what in the
[49:54] world's going on.
[49:57] THAT'S amazing how that God will do this
[50:00] that you do everything that he asked you
[50:02] to do and yet he lays silent at times
[50:05] and he just won't answer. I'm sure I'm
[50:08] speaking to peoples this morning who's
[50:11] come to that place. I've been there many
[50:14] times
[50:17] &gt;&gt; myself.
[50:18] You mean brother Brandham was not there
[50:21] one time, two times, three times, but
[50:23] many times in his own life that he did
[50:26] not know what to do and God would be
[50:30] silent.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; My goodness. When I went back and traced
[50:35] my life and turned over every stone and
[50:39] I'd find that I did something wrong.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay with me reading this
[50:45] quote tonight? You're okay believing
[50:48] this was a man that we're following.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; I couldn't follow any other kind of man
[50:53] cuz any other kind would be a fake.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; I ain't got a lick of confidence in a
[50:57] preacher that never tells you he falls
[50:58] short of the glory of God. First of all,
[51:00] he's a liar.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, notice what brother
[51:04] Brandham in his honesty would say. And
[51:08] I'd find that I did something wrong. I'd
[51:11] go and confess it and say, 'Lord God,
[51:13] I'll make it right. and go do so. Then
[51:16] come back again and SAY, "NOW LORD, THOU
[51:18] ART GOD. You'll answer me." Now notice
[51:22] what he did. He would do the same thing
[51:25] that most of us would do. So we would do
[51:27] something wrong or we would harm
[51:30] somebody or say something to them or
[51:32] something like that or offend somebody
[51:34] whatever it was that we did and the Lord
[51:37] would bring it to our heart and would go
[51:39] and clear the record with them or you
[51:42] know make it right with our wife or
[51:44] husband or friend or pastor or whatever
[51:46] we need to do and then we come back we
[51:49] think well praise God everything is
[51:51] going to be all right now it's
[51:53] definitely going to move now God did
[51:55] brother Brandham exactly the the same
[51:57] way that he does you and I. That makes
[51:59] me feel better. Praise the Lord. THEN HE
[52:01] SAID, "NOW I'D GO AND CONFESS IT AND
[52:03] SAY, LORD, God will make it right. GO DO
[52:06] SO, THEN COME BACK AGAIN AND SAY, now
[52:08] Lord, THOU ART GOD. YOU'LL answer me.
[52:11] Surely I've met every request that you
[52:14] required me to do, and every
[52:16] requirement, I have met it, and still
[52:21] he won't move."
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[52:26] So you mean every prayer brother
[52:29] Brandham prayed and every time brother
[52:31] Brandham asked God, God didn't move for
[52:34] him like like us.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, people that
[52:39] paint the picture to you the opposite or
[52:42] lying to you.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Now let me just break it to you tonight.
[52:48] If brother Brandon was here alive today,
[52:51] still able to pray for the sick, all the
[52:54] sick that he would pray for would not
[52:57] get well.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; How many people do you figure died in
[53:02] the 33 and a2 years that Jesus was on
[53:05] the earth?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Hundreds, if not thousands.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; And how many did he raise from the dead?
[53:13] &gt;&gt; How many did he heal? No doubt hundreds.
[53:16] But how many did to heal?
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Now I know of one setting in the Bible
[53:21] when he walked through a whole multitude
[53:23] of the sick and the impotent and they
[53:26] had all kinds of different plagues and
[53:28] whatever were wrong with them. But the
[53:29] father led him to one man who had a
[53:32] prostate trouble who had been laying
[53:34] there for all that time. I wonder how
[53:36] many babies that he stepped over. How
[53:38] many blind? How many crippled? HOW MANY
[53:40] HALT? HOW MANY M YOU MEAN the Lord Jesus
[53:42] didn't heal them all?
[53:45] If the Lord Jesus was HERE IN THIS
[53:48] BUILDING TONIGHT PHYSICALLY, he wouldn't
[53:51] heal every person that's sick.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE WILL of God
[53:58] is so broad and we're looking at it and
[54:01] sometimes God will allow sickness for a
[54:03] whip. Sometimes God will allow a
[54:06] sickness for a test. Sometimes he's
[54:09] testified about you before the devil up
[54:12] in heaven and you didn't hear the
[54:14] testimony. Too bad. You didn't HEAR WHAT
[54:17] GOD HAD TO say about you. But he's going
[54:19] to prove to the devil by the trial
[54:22] you're going through that you're the
[54:24] kind of person that he said you was.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH. AND HE SAID HE STILL WON'T
[54:31] MOVE. and he seems to sit
[54:35] silent.
[54:38] That's when you've got to be sure
[54:42] that he is God.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice what you're to be
[54:47] sure of. Not yourself.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Not the church you go to, not the pastor
[54:53] you're sitting under. Come on, somebody.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; You're to be sure of him. All people
[55:00] will let you down.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Don't put your ultimate confidence in no
[55:05] man. I have my ultimate confidence in no
[55:09] human being. I put my ultimate
[55:12] confidence in the Lord Jesus. I have
[55:14] confidence in preachers and friends and
[55:16] church people and all that. Yes. BUT MY
[55:19] ULTIMATE CONFIDENCE I will put in nobody
[55:22] because they will disappoint you and let
[55:25] you down. Come on, say amen. So, what
[55:28] you need to be sure of tonight IS NOT
[55:30] THE PEOPLE you're going to church with.
[55:32] You don't need to be sure so much of the
[55:34] deacons or the preacher or the pastor or
[55:37] the associate pastor. You need to be
[55:40] sure of one being and that's Almighty
[55:43] God.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Notice what he says then. THAT'S WHEN
[55:47] YOU'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT HE IS GOD.
[55:50] DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. THE ONLY thing is
[55:54] that in your heart to be certain of God.
[55:58] And when you've met everything that he
[56:01] said, then you're SURE THAT HE'S GOD.
[56:03] THAT'S WHEN faith goes to work right
[56:07] there. Faith stands steady for it knows
[56:12] that he is. Notice now what faith
[56:15] believes. And you've met every
[56:17] requirement. You believe that he is. and
[56:20] faith holds steady. Now remember, this
[56:23] woman was a gentile. So she didn't
[56:27] actually even have a prophet that was
[56:30] allocated to her, a special Zidonian
[56:33] prophet or a Phoenician which was in a
[56:36] nearlocating community near her. She had
[56:40] one that GOD HAD SENT, BUT HE WAS A
[56:43] PROPHET OF ALL NATIONS. Now remember
[56:45] Elijah was not like some of the other
[56:47] JEWISH PROPHETS THAT SOME of the Old
[56:49] Testament prophets were only to Judah,
[56:52] some were to Israel. And then there was
[56:54] some like Elijah which was a national
[56:58] prophet. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT
[57:01] God sent a gentile, a national prophet.
[57:05] Now you see, IT HELPS US TO understand
[57:07] why God would use the same spirit of
[57:09] Elijah. And he would send that same
[57:12] spirit back again to a gentile woman on
[57:16] the face of the earth in the day and
[57:18] hour that we live in. And we're facing
[57:20] all kinds of tests and all kinds of
[57:23] trials and all types OF DIFFICULTIES.
[57:26] AND IF GOD SENT HIM to you, then it must
[57:29] SAY THAT GOD HAS confidence that you
[57:32] know what to do with this prophet's
[57:35] word.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THE PROPHET can bring the
[57:39] word to the woman, but then the woman
[57:42] must know what to do with the word once
[57:45] it's delivered.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Now notice he said when you've met every
[57:49] requirement, you believe that he is and
[57:52] faith holds steady. He said if you met
[57:55] God's requirement IN YOUR HEART, HE SAID
[57:57] GOD'S ONLY TESTING your faith for he
[58:02] loves to do that. Now remember I told
[58:04] you speaking about godliness that if
[58:06] you're like God, you love what God loves
[58:08] and hates what God hates. And and I told
[58:10] you there's some things that God loves
[58:12] that I'm still working on.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; This is one of them RIGHT HERE. GOD
[58:16] LOVES TO TRY ME AND I'M STILL PRAYING
[58:19] GOD HELP ME TO LOVE IT. NOW, MAYBE SOME
[58:22] OF Y'ALL LOVE IT WHEN God tries you.
[58:23] WELL, I I'M STILL WORKING on that love.
[58:25] Anybody know what I'M TALKING ABOUT? GOD
[58:28] LOVES TO TRY US, BUT IT MAKES ME
[58:30] NERVOUS. I GET ANXIOUS. I I get weary
[58:33] WITH IT ALL. NOTICE GOD'S ONLY TESTING
[58:36] your faith for he loves to do that. Can
[58:40] you imagine that God actually loves to
[58:44] put you RIGHT BACK AGAINST A WALL OR PUT
[58:47] YOU RIGHT TO WHERE IT LOOKS TOTALLY
[58:49] IMPOSSIBLE AND then he himself will not
[58:51] be whispering love secrets to you but he
[58:54] will go into that silent mode and he
[58:57] will let you stand there SEEMINGLY BY
[59:00] YOURSELF. YOU PRAY, YOU read your Bible,
[59:03] YOU GO TO CHURCH. MY GOODNESS, you'd be
[59:05] just shouting victory tonight if some of
[59:07] you had a handful of meal. You'd say,
[59:09] "Really? a handful meal. It would FEEL
[59:11] LIKE A 55GALLON DRUM TO me as low as I
[59:14] am tonight. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD LOVES
[59:17] TO FIND PEOPLE THAT HE CAN PUT THEM
[59:19] RIGHT IN SUCH A DIFFICULT SPOT AND THEN
[59:22] HE WILL remain silent. And you know how
[59:24] this battle works. When he chooses to
[59:27] remain silent, oh, SLOOH FOOT STARTS
[59:29] RUNNING HIS MOUTH LIKE A BLABBERMOUTH.
[59:32] GOD DON'T LOVE YOU. GOD DON'T CARE FOR
[59:34] YOU. GOD THIS. GOD THAT. GOD THAT. AND
[59:37] GOD WON'T EVEN SAY one word. and the
[59:39] devil takes that opportunity. But just
[59:42] remember, friends, when you're at that
[59:44] place, what you NEED TO DO IS SQUARE
[59:46] BACK OFF AND RE-EVALUATE and
[59:48] repprioritize things and say, "THERE'S
[59:51] ONE THING I'm sure of, and that is God
[59:54] is a mighty God. I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[59:56] WHAT'S GOING ON. I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[59:58] WHERE I'M AT. I don't understand why my
[1:00:00] family's going through this and that and
[1:00:02] the other, BUT I BELIEVE MY GOD IS A
[1:00:04] MIGHTY GOD. AND I BELIEVE HE HAS A HOLD
[1:00:07] TO MY LIFE.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. Let's have church
[1:00:11] tonight.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; God's only testing your faith for he
[1:00:16] loves to do that. And you have confessed
[1:00:18] your sin and you've MET EVERY
[1:00:20] REQUIREMENT THAT God requires. And still
[1:00:24] he lays silent. REMEMBER, FAITH says
[1:00:29] that he is. THEN FAITH HOLDS ON TO IT
[1:00:32] NOT KNOWING WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, BUT IT
[1:00:34] KNOWS THAT HE IS. SO FAITH DON'T EVEN
[1:00:38] ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. FAITH
[1:00:40] DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW WHY YOU'RE GOING
[1:00:42] THROUGH IT. BUT FAITH COMES BACK TO ONE
[1:00:45] THING. HE IS. HE IS. NOT HE WAS, NOT HE
[1:00:50] WILL BE. HE [screaming] IS. DO YOU
[1:00:53] BELIEVE he is?
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, help us, LORD. IF HE REQUIRED YOU TO
[1:01:00] MEET THESE CIRCUMSTANCE, that's this is
[1:01:02] all from the same sermon. He goes over
[1:01:04] this over AND OVER AGAIN. REMEMBER WHEN
[1:01:08] HE WAS IN NEW YORK, BIMINGTON, New York,
[1:01:10] maybe 1951, I'M THINKING INDICOTT shoe
[1:01:13] company and there was a big famous shoe
[1:01:15] place there. So they had an auditorium
[1:01:17] that was named after that shoe company.
[1:01:18] HE SAID PEOPLE WOULD COME THROUGH THE
[1:01:20] PRAYER LINE. ONE man in particular who
[1:01:21] said the Lord had DELIVERED HIM OF A
[1:01:23] TERRIBLE, terrible disease and sickness.
[1:01:25] AND HE SAID IN A FEW DAYS THAT MAN COME
[1:01:27] BACK TO HIM. THE SAME thing was on him
[1:01:29] again. AND HE SAID OTHER PEOPLE KEPT
[1:01:31] COMING BACK AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD UNDER
[1:01:33] THE ANOINTING ON THE PLATFORM WOULD
[1:01:35] DRIVE THEM DEMONS OUT of their bodies.
[1:01:38] And then WHEN THEY WOULD GET OUT on
[1:01:39] their own away from the anointing OF
[1:01:41] THAT PROPHETIC GIFT, THAT DISEASE WOULD
[1:01:44] COME RIGHT BACK ON THEM. AND HE SAID THE
[1:01:46] ANGEL OF THE LORD MET HIM AND SAID,
[1:01:47] "TELL THEM PEOPLE TO GET UP THERE AND
[1:01:49] CONFESS THEIR SINS."
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; NOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING? THE SPIRIT OF
[1:01:54] GOD WAS MAKING THEM DEMON SPIRITS LEAVE.
[1:01:57] BUT THEM DEMON SPIRITS KNEW THEM PEOPLE
[1:01:59] STILL HAD SOME THINGS IN THEIR LIFE THAT
[1:02:01] WASN'T RIGHT WITH GOD. OH, hallelujah to
[1:02:04] God. AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD DID NOT
[1:02:07] WANT THEM PEOPLE, LOOK AT THE MERCY OF
[1:02:09] GOD. THE ANGELS OF HEALING DID NOT WANT
[1:02:11] THEM PEOPLE GOING BACK HOME AFTER THOSE
[1:02:14] MEETINGS IN WORSE SHAPE, which they
[1:02:16] would HAVE BEEN. BECAUSE WHEN THAT THING
[1:02:18] GOES OUT AND IT COMES BACK, IT DON'T
[1:02:20] COME BACK ALONE. IT COMES BACK WITH
[1:02:21] OTHERS. That's right. AND HE DID NOT
[1:02:25] WANT THEM GOING BACK WITH THAT. HE
[1:02:26] WANTED THEM DELIVERED. SO HE TELLS THE
[1:02:28] PROPHET, "HAVE THEM PEOPLE TO GET UP AND
[1:02:31] confess their sins." Well, you know
[1:02:33] what? WHENEVER THEY DONE THAT, THEN HE
[1:02:35] PRAYED FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT LEFT
[1:02:37] THEM AND IT DIDN'T COME BACK. BUT HERE
[1:02:39] WE HAVE A DIFFERENT SCENARIO THAT YOU'VE
[1:02:42] DONE THIS AND YOU'VE DONE THAT AND
[1:02:43] YOU'VE MADE THIS RIGHT AND THAT RIGHT.
[1:02:45] AND GOD STILL lays
[1:02:49] lays. Notice the word he's using. lays,
[1:02:51] not sets, lays. So, it's like God's in a
[1:02:54] reclining position.
[1:02:57] Hang tight, Dave. I'll be with you
[1:03:00] before long.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Someone is in your mind now
[1:03:04] figuratively, God's kicked back in this
[1:03:07] heavenly recliner,
[1:03:09] just getting massaged.
[1:03:13] You're crying. You're screaming. You're
[1:03:15] begging. God saying, "Hang with it,
[1:03:18] Donnie. Hang with it." And I said, "I'm
[1:03:20] trying, Lord. I'm trying, but I ain't
[1:03:23] getting massage. It's my nerves. I'm
[1:03:25] about to go crazy. God, help me. Lord,
[1:03:27] if you DON'T MOVE TODAY, I WANT TO SAY,
[1:03:29] GOD SAID, YOU'RE GOOD. You're good."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; But he don't say it.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; He's thinking it. I can't read his mind.
[1:03:36] Can you?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU READ GOD'S [screaming] MIND?
[1:03:42] NOTICE
[1:03:44] WHEN YOU'VE MET HIS REQUIREMENTS,
[1:03:47] THAT BRINGS YOUR FAITH
[1:03:50] to a showdown.
[1:03:52] If you met God's requirements and you've
[1:03:55] been met, notice this again and again,
[1:03:58] he uses this terminology, and you fully
[1:04:01] CONSIDERED AND HAVE DONE EVERYTHING GOD
[1:04:04] REQUIRES YOU TO DO, THEN YOUR FAITH rest
[1:04:10] that he is.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Be certain
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] SO, IT'S TOO COMPLICATED. BUT IT'S TOO
[1:04:20] COMPLICATED. IT'S OVER MY HEAD. IF this
[1:04:22] is over your head, I wonder if you've
[1:04:24] got a head.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; This is TOO COMPLICATED TO KNOW ONE
[1:04:30] THING.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; HE IS.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; HE IS. [screaming]
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; You know, he loves to test us.
[1:04:43] Apparently, the Lord knew I needed this.
[1:04:45] Brother preached a sermon in 1959. And
[1:04:47] he said, "I've got a young one down
[1:04:48] there in 2026.
[1:04:51] He's going to really struggle with some.
[1:04:52] I'm going to have my prophet say it over
[1:04:54] and over again. Tell him. Tell him
[1:04:56] Elijah. Tell him. Tell Donnie. Tell him.
[1:04:57] Get it over to him. Tell him. He loves
[1:05:00] to be tested. He loves to test you. He
[1:05:03] loves to do all this. HE LOVES TO SEE
[1:05:07] the reaction
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; of your face."
[1:05:12] SO YOU SEE, IT'S NOT THAT GOD LOVES IT
[1:05:14] WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME, BUT GOD
[1:05:16] IS SENDING THE HARD TIME OR ALLOWING THE
[1:05:17] HARD TIME so he can see what really
[1:05:21] makes him so happy with his children.
[1:05:24] And that's the reaction
[1:05:27] of your faith.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; When you don't feel it, you don't see
[1:05:31] it, you don't understand it, but your
[1:05:34] faith says he is.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; He is.
[1:05:44] Just a couple of days before Erica
[1:05:45] passed
[1:05:49] over little girls was able to come and
[1:05:51] she was
[1:05:53] able to pull each one of them up close
[1:05:56] to her and just talk to them a little
[1:05:58] bit.
[1:06:00] I was standing near her when she spoke
[1:06:01] to one of them
[1:06:04] and she said, "Don't you ever forget
[1:06:08] we serve
[1:06:11] a mighty God.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Now, she's laying there and cancer has
[1:06:18] riddled her body.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; She's been through one thing after
[1:06:22] another after another. What a heritage
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; for a mama
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; to leave for her babies.
[1:06:30] others. She told them, "Be sure you get
[1:06:32] the Holy Ghost." Not about, you know,
[1:06:34] roll your hair this way and curl it this
[1:06:36] way and be sure and use this rouge and
[1:06:39] use this lipstick and and do this and do
[1:06:41] that and the other. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, you talking about a testimony of a
[1:06:47] little daughter of God laying there in
[1:06:48] that bed. And within a couple of days or
[1:06:51] day and a half, something like that,
[1:06:52] after those words left her mouth, she
[1:06:54] was carried beyond the curtain of time.
[1:06:56] And I thought to myself, I've relived it
[1:06:58] out again today over and over again when
[1:07:00] I was listening to this tape. This is
[1:07:02] what kept coming back to me. THAT FAITH
[1:07:05] KNOWS HE IS. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT FAITH
[1:07:08] KNOWS. FAITH DON'T UNDERSTAND WHILE
[1:07:10] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS TRIAL OR WHY
[1:07:12] YOU'RE FACING THIS TEST. FAITH DON'T
[1:07:14] UNDERSTAND ALL THE UPS AND THE DOWNS AND
[1:07:16] THE INS AND OUTS. BUT FAITH CAN COME
[1:07:18] BACK AND SAY, "HERE HE IS. HE IS WHAT?
[1:07:21] HE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED. HE'S THE
[1:07:24] ALPHA. HE'S THE OMEGA. HE'S THE
[1:07:26] BEGINNING, THE END, THE FIRST, THE LAST.
[1:07:28] THERE'S NOTHING GREATER. THERE'S NOTHING
[1:07:30] BIGGER. HE'S GOT YOU, HALLELUJAH, ON HIS
[1:07:33] MIND. HE KNOWS HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOU. HE
[1:07:36] KNOWS HOW MUCH HE CARES FOR YOU. HE IS.
[1:07:40] HE'S RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. HE'S IN YOUR
[1:07:42] HEART. HE'S IN YOUR LIFE. HE LOVES YOUR
[1:07:45] FAMILY. HE IS. THAT'S WHAT FAITH KNOWS
[1:07:49] HE [screaming] IS. [applause]
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; He said he loves to see the reaction of
[1:08:01] your faith. Did you KNOW THAT GOD LIKES
[1:08:05] TO SEE HOW you'll react?
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SAY, "OH LORD, I I BELIEVE YOU.
[1:08:12] THOU ART MY SAVIOR. I BELIEVE THAT YOU
[1:08:14] are the healer. I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE
[1:08:15] THE ONE WHO gives the Holy Spirit and
[1:08:17] the things THAT I'M REQUIRING." YOU'RE
[1:08:18] THE GOD WHO GIVES THAT.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then when you CONFESS ALL YOUR
[1:08:22] SINS AND PROMISE GOD HE'LL DO WHAT HE
[1:08:24] LET YOU GET WELL. And then because it
[1:08:27] don't happen, you run off like a coward.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; RUN OFF LIKE A COWARD SOMEWHERE. God
[1:08:37] can't use that.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM TO USE YOU.
[1:08:43] THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM TO ANSWER YOU.
[1:08:46] FRIENDS, it makes you wonder.
[1:08:49] It makes you wonder. for a lot of our
[1:08:50] unanswered prayers, as we call them, and
[1:08:52] God don't move for us. And if we're not
[1:08:53] careful, we'll tend to blame the Lord
[1:08:55] for it. He ain't to blame for it.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; I would guarantee you one thing, he
[1:08:59] ain't to blame for nothing.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Not wrong, anyway.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHERE'S MOST OF IT GO? LET'S BE
[1:09:05] HONEST. PROBABLY COMES RIGHT back to
[1:09:06] ourselves.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; We're cowards.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. YOU GIVE UP ON DAY 632 AND YOU
[1:09:13] DIDN'T KNOW DAY 633 WAS GOING TO BE YOUR
[1:09:15] DAY OF DELIVERANCE. AND THE DEVIL BEAT
[1:09:18] YOU OUT OF AN ABSOLUTE PHENOMENAL
[1:09:20] MIRACLE AND YOU WAS WITHIN 24 HOURS OF
[1:09:23] HAVING IT DONE IN your life, but you got
[1:09:25] weak.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:09:32] NOTICE BECAUSE HE ONLY ANSWERS BY FAITH,
[1:09:35] THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU go away. LISTEN
[1:09:38] TO WHAT HAPPENS. YOU GO away
[1:09:42] and he can't answer.
[1:09:45] SO THE VERY [screaming] HOUR THAT WE
[1:09:48] DISBELIEVE,
[1:09:50] he can't answer.
[1:09:55] BUT REAL FAITH STANDS THERE being sure.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Ready for this?
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; This is so deep. Y'all ready? Hold on.
[1:10:07] That God is
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; now amazing. Nobody shouted. Nobody
[1:10:13] jumped up and run around this building.
[1:10:15] I've seen people jump up and run for a
[1:10:17] whole lot of things that wasn't near as
[1:10:18] deep as what what I just read to you.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; If you could ever get that in your soul,
[1:10:22] there ain't enough powers in hell to
[1:10:24] ever stop you.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; There's not enough sickness. THERE'S NOT
[1:10:26] ENOUGH TROUBLE TO KNOW that God is
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; well. Hallelujah.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Notice this. HE CAN'T ANSWER, BUT REAL
[1:10:36] TRACE TRUE FAITH stands there. BEING
[1:10:39] SURE THAT GOD IS BE CERTAIN
[1:10:43] that he is.
[1:10:46] You see, Abraham had this same type of
[1:10:49] faith to believe that God could move. He
[1:10:55] probably DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK
[1:10:56] 25 YEARS FOR GOD TO MANIFEST HIMSELF.
[1:10:59] BUT somebody just believed God and God
[1:11:03] kindly to him for righteousness.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:11:07] WENT BEYOND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING, human
[1:11:09] reasoning, and believed. And you imagine
[1:11:13] this man didn't even have the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost, didn't have the new birth, but he
[1:11:17] believed God. THREE OF MY BROTHERS ONE
[1:11:20] TIME GOT CAUGHT into a a very flammatory
[1:11:26] situation.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BOW THEIR knee
[1:11:32] at the image of a prophet of God.
[1:11:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT IMAGE WAS MADE OF DANIEL.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; YOU AND I ARE BEING FACED with the same
[1:11:44] thing in the last day. Folks around this
[1:11:46] message that want to MAKE AN IMAGE OF
[1:11:48] OUR PROPHET AND THEY WANT US TO BOW.
[1:11:50] SORRY, WE DON'T BOW our knees to any
[1:11:53] man.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; NO PASTOR, NO PREACHER, NO TEACHER, NO
[1:11:56] MAN. THERE'S ONLY ONE BEING THAT GETS
[1:11:59] OUR WORSHIP AROUND HERE. That's the Lord
[1:12:01] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WE KNOW OF COURSE THESE
[1:12:06] BROTHERS REFUSED. NOW REMEMBER they were
[1:12:08] comrades. They were buddies as we WOULD
[1:12:11] SAY WITH DANIEL AND IT WAS HARD AND YET
[1:12:13] THEY HAD A GREAT RESPECT for Daniel and
[1:12:15] a great honor for Daniel. That's why
[1:12:17] they couldn't bow because they knew who
[1:12:19] he was. And no true prophet of God would
[1:12:22] ever want anyone to bow to him. And the
[1:12:24] church said amen. NOW NOTICE BROTHER
[1:12:27] BRANDON preached about them when he
[1:12:28] preached the sermon. And he SAID WHEN
[1:12:30] THEY HEARD THEY GO TO the had to go to
[1:12:32] the fiery furnace, THEY SAID, "OUR GOD
[1:12:34] IS ABLE TO deliver us from this furnace,
[1:12:38] BUT IF HE DOESN'T DO IT, WE'RE NOT
[1:12:41] BOWING TO any of your idols." I love
[1:12:44] that BECAUSE IT'S EVIDENT THAT THEIR
[1:12:47] FAITH DID NOT TELL THEM YET that God WAS
[1:12:50] GOING TO DELIVER, BUT THEIR FAITH TOLD
[1:12:52] THEM ONE THING FOR SURE. We're not
[1:12:55] bowing to no image. Whether it's A
[1:12:57] PROPHET OF GOD, WHETHER IT'S THE MARK OF
[1:12:59] THE BEAST OR WHATEVER it is, WE ARE NOT
[1:13:01] BIND. YOU SEE, FAITH DID NOT TELL THEM,
[1:13:03] "DON'T WORRY about it. It's going to be
[1:13:04] fine. You're going to be okay." They
[1:13:06] said, "WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'LL DO IT
[1:13:08] OR NOT." DON'T you understand? We
[1:13:09] approach things the same way in our
[1:13:11] life. We get sick, we get cancer,
[1:13:13] whatever it is, we approach it with the
[1:13:15] general orders of Mark 16. LAY HANDS ON
[1:13:18] THE SICK AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. AND WE
[1:13:20] DO THAT UNTIL GOD SAYS OTHERWISE. WE
[1:13:24] SAY, "WE KNOW OUR GOD CAN DELIVER. WE
[1:13:27] KNOW OUR GOD CAN HEAL. WE KNOW OUR GOD
[1:13:29] CAN DO IT." NOW, IS THAT HIS WILL FOR ME
[1:13:31] AT THIS TIME? I DON'T KNOW YET. BUT I
[1:13:33] KNOW ONE THING. WHICHEVER WAY IT IS,
[1:13:36] I'LL BE A VICTOR whichever way I go out.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOTICE HE SAID THEY KNOWED HE WAS
[1:13:43] JEHOVAH. THEY KNOW HE ANSWERED PRAYER.
[1:13:45] BUT WHETHER HE DID IT IN THEIR case or
[1:13:48] not, it would have to be for the good.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Ah, here we go.
[1:13:57] SO, THEY JUST MADE THEIR STATEMENT,
[1:14:01] confessed their sins, and walked into
[1:14:05] death.
[1:14:08] HE GOES ON TO SAY THEY WERE CERTAIN OF
[1:14:10] GOD BECAUSE THEY KNOW GOD WOULD WORK
[1:14:14] EVERYTHING FOR THEIR GOOD. LISTEN TO
[1:14:15] THIS AND DON'T ever forget it.
[1:14:18] And when we are certain OF GOD,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT GOD WORKS.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Don't you see why we question these
[1:14:33] things?
[1:14:35] Because we're not certain about him yet
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and his sovereignty and his control and
[1:14:42] his power. WHEN WE ARE CERTAIN,
[1:14:46] EVEN THOUGH IT MAY RIP OUR HEART OUT, IT
[1:14:49] MAY COME OUT OF THE WAY. NO, NO, NO.
[1:14:51] THAT'S NOT WHAT WE PRAYED FOR. THAT'S
[1:14:53] NOT WHAT WE WANTED.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; AND WHY DO WE FEEL THAT WAY? CUZ WE'RE
[1:14:57] CERTAIN IN OUR MIND, OH, THE OUTCOME IS
[1:14:59] GOING TO BE THIS WAY. OH, YES, THAT'S
[1:15:00] IT. That's the will of the Lord. It's
[1:15:02] not for us to tell him what the will of
[1:15:04] the Lord is.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; But we can be certain he is. How this is
[1:15:08] GOING TO WORK OUT, I don't have an idea,
[1:15:10] but I know one thing, he is. He's in
[1:15:13] charge of my life. He's the one who
[1:15:14] brought me on my onto this earth and my
[1:15:17] journey. AND THE DEVIL CANNOT TAKE ME
[1:15:19] UNTIL GOD'S finished with me.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; NOTICE WE KNOW THAT God
[1:15:26] when we are certain of God. We know that
[1:15:30] God works everything for our good. This
[1:15:36] ought to be a refrigerator quote. This
[1:15:39] ought to be on your iPhone, your
[1:15:40] Android, your iPad, your computer. Mark
[1:15:43] it on your forehead if you want to make
[1:15:45] you a t-shirt. Forget these football
[1:15:47] stars, baseball star. They're a bunch of
[1:15:49] heathen anyhow. Put some You're going to
[1:15:51] wear something on your on your clothes.
[1:15:52] Put something that amounts to something.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT GOD WORKS EVERYTHING FOR
[1:15:59] OUR GOOD. Is there anybody here tonight
[1:16:01] that believes this quote?
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; What a few of you. Well, praise the
[1:16:05] Lord.
[1:16:06] HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE COME TO THE SPOT?
[1:16:10] THEN WE ARE being certain of us of the
[1:16:15] medical science,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; certain of God.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; So they made one statement and they were
[1:16:26] certain. They walked right into the
[1:16:27] fiery furnace and God let them walk
[1:16:30] right there sitting right there looking
[1:16:32] at him.
[1:16:34] He wanted to see their reaction. You
[1:16:36] imagine almighty God just sitting there
[1:16:38] watching looking at him saying I want
[1:16:40] you to look at that. You ever seen
[1:16:41] anything like that in your life?
[1:16:43] They were CERTAIN HE WAS GOD. THEY WAS
[1:16:46] NOT CERTAIN. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
[1:16:48] THE PROPHET IS BRINGING HERE? THEY WERE
[1:16:50] NOT CERTAIN ABOUT WHAT IT WAS PERTAIN TO
[1:16:52] THEM, BUT THEY WERE CERTAIN ABOUT GOD.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; They made their confession. They made
[1:16:59] everything right. And they knowed, they
[1:17:02] were certain
[1:17:04] that he was God. SO THEY WALKED RIGHT UP
[1:17:08] THAT FIERY FURNACE and right at the last
[1:17:13] moment.
[1:17:16] That scares me.
[1:17:19] I mean, I'm always the type of guy if
[1:17:20] I've got an appointment here at the
[1:17:21] church and I've got to meet somebody,
[1:17:23] I've got to talk to them at 4:00. I'm
[1:17:25] here no later than 4, you know, 3:40. I
[1:17:29] mean, I'm I'm late. If I'm here at 3:45,
[1:17:31] I always want to be early.
[1:17:34] And God says, "Uh, Donnie, that ain't
[1:17:37] going to work with me
[1:17:39] cuz I don't operate on your time.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I wait till the very last
[1:17:45] moment."
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:17:52] So they walked right UP TO THE FIERY
[1:17:54] furnace and right at the last moment
[1:17:58] there he come riding right out of the
[1:18:01] heavens on a chariot of wind fanned the
[1:18:05] breezes OFF OF THEM WHILE he consoles
[1:18:09] them. Glory to God. And talked to them.
[1:18:12] GOD LET YOUR FAITH COME TO THE SPOT
[1:18:16] WHERE IT'LL REACT. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
[1:18:19] THAT SOMETIMES THIS TYPE OF DYNAMIC
[1:18:22] FAITH, BROTHER JIM, IT DON'T REACT IN
[1:18:24] THE EARLY INITIAL STAGES, YOU THINK IT
[1:18:27] DOES,
[1:18:29] BUT IT TAKES DILEMMA. IT TAKES SOMETIMES
[1:18:32] PRESSING US.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; This has been pretty pressing, right?
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, the guys that's got a hold of
[1:18:40] your arms dies throwing you in
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; and you're thinking, Lord, if you're
[1:18:44] going to show up, you're going have to
[1:18:44] show up quick. Where's the thermostat?
[1:18:46] Where's the thermostat? And I'm breaking
[1:18:47] out sweating already. Oh Lord, where's
[1:18:49] it at? Where's it at? And the very last
[1:18:51] moment BEFORE THEY WOULD, YOU KNOW, THAT
[1:18:53] IS WITH FIRE. BROTHER RON SPENCER GOT
[1:18:55] BURNED years and years ago. And whenever
[1:18:57] that happened, he breathed that fire
[1:18:58] inside of his lungs, just fried his
[1:19:00] lungs and done all kinds OF DAMAGE. YOU
[1:19:02] IMAGINE THEY'RE THAT CLOSE. THEY'RE THAT
[1:19:04] CLOSE TO THAT FIRE. AND ONE MOMENT left
[1:19:08] and all of a sudden here come this
[1:19:11] gigantic breeze.
[1:19:13] this fan just
[1:19:17] and then they were standing right in the
[1:19:18] middle of the fire, BUT THEY WASN'T
[1:19:20] BEING BURNED. ALL THREE OF THEM WAS
[1:19:22] BEING ENCIRCLED BY THIS BREEZE. IT'S A
[1:19:24] HEAVENLY DIMENSION. BOY, it wouldn't
[1:19:26] look somebody on the earth right to make
[1:19:28] a fan like this. IT KEPT THE SMOKE OFF
[1:19:31] OF THEM. NOT EVEN ONE HAIR ON THEIR HAND
[1:19:33] OR THEIR ARMS GOT SINNED. AND THEY WERE
[1:19:35] STANDING THERE FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE
[1:19:37] PRE-INCARNATE SON OF GOD. WHY? THEY WERE
[1:19:40] CERTAIN HE IS. THEY WAS NOT CERTAIN
[1:19:43] ABOUT THE OUTCOME. THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW
[1:19:45] IT WAS GOING TO GO. BUT THEY WERE
[1:19:47] CERTAIN ABOUT ONE THING. WE AIN'T BOWING
[1:19:49] TO YOUR IMAGE. WE'RE NOT BOWING TO YOUR
[1:19:52] IMAGE. AND WE KNOW OUR GOD IS.
[1:19:57] [applause]
[1:20:05] Now back to Zarapath.
[1:20:09] I don't know how it happened really.
[1:20:13] [snorts]
[1:20:14] I'm going to ask her when I see her. I
[1:20:17] don't know how she knew.
[1:20:20] I don't know who told her
[1:20:23] or if it's just something the father
[1:20:24] shared with her cuz her name was on his
[1:20:27] book.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; But the prophet says it this way about
[1:20:32] that little woman.
[1:20:34] This poor little woman. She knew
[1:20:38] that he was God.
[1:20:42] And as the barrel went down, down, down,
[1:20:46] down, [gasps]
[1:20:48] circumstances got worse and worse
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; all the time. But God WAS LETTING IT GET
[1:20:56] that way. He just loves to do that.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I'm honest tonight. Lord, help me.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Help me. Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to pray for this for
[1:21:07] these lying sinners sitting here
[1:21:08] tonight. They need help, too. Lord,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; he loves TO DO THAT. HE LOVES TO PUT
[1:21:16] YOUR FAITH TO A TEST TO SEE HOW YOU ACT
[1:21:20] on it. LET YOU BE ANOINTED AND BE PRAYED
[1:21:23] FOR, then make your worse.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:31] Yes, sir.
[1:21:32] Brothers and sisters, this is separating
[1:21:33] the men from the boys.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; This is separating the bride from the
[1:21:37] church.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. THIS IS SEPARATING
[1:21:40] MAKE BELIEVERS FROM BELIEVERS.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; YOU DO EVERYTHING GOD SAYS AND THEN YOU
[1:21:44] WALK UP THERE. I'M HAVING BROTHER DONNIE
[1:21:46] THE BROTHERS TO PRAY FOR ME. HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:47] I believe it. GLORY TO GOD. AND YOU WALK
[1:21:49] UP THERE AND GOD TELLS THE DEVIL, I NOW
[1:21:51] TOMORROW MAKE HER WORSE.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes I need to start a 575p
[1:22:06] part series on faith.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Notice this. LET YOU BE ANOINTED THEN
[1:22:13] MAKE YOU WORSE AND SAY COME ON
[1:22:15] [screaming] SATAN.
[1:22:18] You imagine God
[1:22:22] inviting the devil
[1:22:26] to come and mess with you.
[1:22:30] Come on, Satan.
[1:22:33] PUT HIM TO THE TEST.
[1:22:38] But listen, these next four words, I
[1:22:42] know
[1:22:44] he
[1:22:45] believes. Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy, children. If we could
[1:22:49] only hear God say that about us, we
[1:22:52] would never have no more tests, would
[1:22:53] we? We' just say, "Where you at, devil?"
[1:22:55] Every day we get up looking for him.
[1:22:57] Come on. Come on. Come on. COME ON.
[1:22:59] YOU IMAGINE GOD TELLING THE DEVIL THAT,
[1:23:01] "COME ON, DEVIL. COME ON."
[1:23:04] SHE GOT PRAYED FOR, HE GOT PRAYED FOR.
[1:23:06] HEY, COME ON. TRY TO HIT HER HARDER. LET
[1:23:09] HER BLOOD PRESSURE GO EVEN HIGHER. LET
[1:23:11] HIS HEADACHE GET EVEN WORSE.
[1:23:15] BUT HE WON'T turn his back on me.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; I know he believes me.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:23:31] I KNOW HE BELIEVES ME. THEN BROTHER
[1:23:33] SAID, "BLESS GOD FOREVER." Y'ALL hear
[1:23:35] him PREACH THIS. OH MY. PUT HIM TO A
[1:23:38] TEST NOW. I KNOW HE TOOK MY WORD FOR IT.
[1:23:41] And then he asked this question. Could
[1:23:43] he say that about you?
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me how many cues you know on
[1:23:51] a guitar. Don't tell me how well you can
[1:23:53] play the piano or the organ or how many
[1:23:54] times you can jump up and down, speak in
[1:23:56] tongues or shout. How many people you
[1:23:57] prayed for and they've got healed. On
[1:23:59] this very same tape, you'll hear the
[1:24:00] prophet of God say that a person could
[1:24:02] be healed. And he said faith can't even
[1:24:03] come coming from their heart and it's
[1:24:06] not even a genuine CLEAN HEART.
[1:24:09] JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVE AND SOMEBODY
[1:24:11] GOT HEALED, IT DON'T MEAN THEY'VE GOT
[1:24:12] THIS.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; But when God can say, "Come on, devil.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I know him." That's what he said about
[1:24:23] Job. GO AHEAD, TAKE HIM.
[1:24:27] But the prophet said, "God and Job had
[1:24:29] been fellowshipping together."
[1:24:32] And God bragged on him. Ain't no another
[1:24:35] man like him in all the earth.
[1:24:38] Praise be to [laughter] God.
[1:24:42] Oh my. PUT HIM TO THE TEST NOW. I know
[1:24:45] he took my word. Could he say that about
[1:24:47] you? HE SAID THAT ABOUT JOE. DO ANYTHING
[1:24:50] TO HIM YOU WANT TO, but don't take his
[1:24:52] life for I know he loves me.
[1:24:56] HE'S MADE THE BURNT OFFERING. HE'S MADE
[1:24:58] THE REQUIREMENTS. HE DID WHAT I told him
[1:25:00] to do and he believes it. Now roll him
[1:25:04] over the coals.
[1:25:06] Lord, make it a little bit easier there
[1:25:08] if you don't mind. I mean, come on. Have
[1:25:10] the devil roll me over jelly rolls maybe
[1:25:12] or cinnamon buns or maybe chocolate or,
[1:25:14] you know, crepes. Crepes. That would be
[1:25:16] the thing. Roll us over crepes with
[1:25:19] whipped cream. Blueberries and
[1:25:21] strawberries on the side. Oh, God make
[1:25:24] me a holy roller. Let it be crepes. And
[1:25:26] I'm rolling over, Lord. Let make my You
[1:25:29] yellow belly coward.
[1:25:32] OH, GOD AIN'T LOOKING FOR PEOPLE THAT
[1:25:35] ARE WEAK AND FEEBLE AND CAN'T STAND
[1:25:38] THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RAPTURE
[1:25:40] TIME, FRIENDS.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS PEOPLE THAT CAN STAND AND LOOK
[1:25:45] THE DEVIL IN THE FACE AND SAY, "I
[1:25:47] BELIEVE HIM. [clears throat] I KNOW HE
[1:25:50] IS." BUT WHAT [screaming] ABOUT YOU? WE
[1:25:52] AIN'T TALKING ABOUT ME. WE'RE TALKING
[1:25:54] ABOUT HIM. WHAT ABOUT THIS PREACHER?
[1:25:57] WHAT ABOUT THAT PERSON? I AIN'T TALKING
[1:25:59] ABOUT THEM. I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM.
[1:26:06] [sighs and gasps]
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; BOY. BOY. You imagine when God tells the
[1:26:09] devil this now? Roll him over the coals
[1:26:12] if you want to. Well, you know he wants
[1:26:14] to.
[1:26:18] ROLL HIM OVER THE COALS IF YOU WANT TO.
[1:26:22] He took everything away from him. God
[1:26:24] doubled it when he gave it back to him.
[1:26:28] He puts our faith to a test
[1:26:32] to see if we really believe
[1:26:37] in the seven seals and the seven
[1:26:38] thunders and the seven trumpets and we
[1:26:41] believe that he is God.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, DON'T YOU WHEN THE MESSAGE
[1:26:46] FOLKS EVER GOING TO get it? When are you
[1:26:47] going to get it?
[1:26:49] IT'S NOT BELIEVING IN CERTAIN DOCTRINES
[1:26:51] AND CERTAIN IDEOLOGOLOGY THAT'LL HELP
[1:26:53] YOU OVERCOME THE DEVIL. SO, WHAT SEAL DO
[1:26:56] YOU USE WHEN YOU'RE FACING TEMPTATION?
[1:26:59] WHAT THUNDER IS IT THAT YOU USE WHEN
[1:27:01] YOU'RE BEING TESTED BY LUST, BROTHERS?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; This is the way we overcome. This is the
[1:27:10] victory that overcometh the world, even
[1:27:12] our faith,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; not our knowledge.
[1:27:18] [sighs]
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. He puts our faith to a
[1:27:23] test as if we really believe that he's
[1:27:25] God. That little woman no doubt said, "I
[1:27:29] prayed
[1:27:31] and I prayed
[1:27:33] and I know I'm an unworthy gentile."
[1:27:37] When she seen that last little cake,
[1:27:40] death had done entered the gate
[1:27:43] and come into the door.
[1:27:46] One more bite a piece.
[1:27:51] So her little boy gets a bite. No doubt
[1:27:53] she told him to take a bigger bite than
[1:27:55] hers
[1:27:57] and she gets the little bite
[1:28:00] and she and her son died. I can see her
[1:28:02] all night praying. The hot winds are
[1:28:04] blowing. The earth parched. The people
[1:28:07] crying and screaming in the street. She
[1:28:09] walked around through the house. She
[1:28:12] looked at her little boy, looked at his
[1:28:13] little pajamas and they were all out and
[1:28:15] his little feet sticking out.
[1:28:19] Looked at her own hands wrinkled. You
[1:28:20] walked back and forth and said,
[1:28:22] "Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:28:25] I KNOW [screaming]
[1:28:27] he's God.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I know he's God. And I've made all of my
[1:28:37] confession. I've done everything that he
[1:28:39] required. And I'm asking for our lives
[1:28:43] for his glory."
[1:28:45] God seen her.
[1:28:52] Now, there's a woman, another woman not
[1:28:54] too far from this place.
[1:28:56] She's the queen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Her name is Jezebel.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; She heard it over and over again. The
[1:29:06] ministry of Elijah,
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; but she hated him.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; And she said, "I'LL DESTROY HIS
[1:29:14] INFLUENCE.
[1:29:16] I'LL GET ON [screaming] YOUTUBE. I'LL
[1:29:19] MAKE ALL KINDS OF VIDEOS.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I'LL kill him.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? One woman from one
[1:29:26] side and another woman from another
[1:29:28] side.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; And the word of the Lord spoke her
[1:29:34] destiny as well.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; For the dogs
[1:29:39] will lick your blood.
[1:29:45] What made the difference? Their attitude
[1:29:47] toward the message of Elijah.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Now, for people who think a prophet is
[1:29:52] important. Well, when we get there that
[1:29:54] day, maybe you can ask this widow of
[1:29:56] Zarapath if she thought a prophet was
[1:29:58] important or not.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE YOU MIGHT ASK THE ANIMALS uh
[1:30:03] that'll be there in the millennium if
[1:30:05] they thought a prophet's message was
[1:30:06] important in pre-andoluvian destruction.
[1:30:10] MAYBE YOU MIGHT ASK THE CHILDREN OF
[1:30:12] ISRAEL DOWN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT
[1:30:14] WHENEVER THEY COME OUT IF THEY thought a
[1:30:16] prophet was important. Need I go on? IF
[1:30:19] YOU WOULD TAKE ALL THE BOOKS OUT OF YOUR
[1:30:21] BIBLE THAT WAS WRITTEN BY PROPHETS, HOW
[1:30:23] BIG WOULD YOUR BIBLE BE?
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I DON'T BLAME EVERYBODY. THIS MESSAGE
[1:30:32] AIN'T FOR THEM. IT'S TOO RICH. GOT TOO
[1:30:35] MANY VITAMINS. VITAMIN A FOR ALPHA.
[1:30:37] VITAMIN B FOR BEGINNING. VITAMIN C FOR
[1:30:40] CHRIST, VITAMIN D FOR DEITY, VITAMIN E
[1:30:43] FOR EVERYTHING, VITAMIN F FOR FIRST,
[1:30:45] VITAMIN G FOR GOD, VITAMIN I FOR THE I
[1:30:48] AM. AND YOU KNOW, I GO ON ON AND ON AND
[1:30:50] ON. AND FOR, YOU KNOW, THOSE THAT DON'T
[1:30:52] HAVE A STOMACH FOR THE
[1:30:57] WORD, you got anymore?
[1:31:01] You got anymore? Wow. I've never ate
[1:31:03] this good in my life. THIS IS AWESOME.
[1:31:06] I'M GETTING SO FAT. I WANT TO WEIGH
[1:31:09] 5,000 POUNDS SPIRITUALLY BEFORE I LEAVE
[1:31:11] THIS WORLD. YOU'LL BE OVERWEIGHT AND THE
[1:31:13] POWER OF GOD will change me. I ain't
[1:31:14] worried about being OVERWEIGHT NO
[1:31:16] RAPTURE. OH, HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO
[1:31:18] KEEP ON EATING AND FEEDING AND FEEDING
[1:31:20] UNTIL MY BODY SAYS, DONNIE, IF YOU DON'T
[1:31:22] QUIT, I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE. AND I'M
[1:31:24] SAYING, GET USED TO IT, BODY, CUZ I'M
[1:31:26] GOING TO KEEP ON FEEDING TO THIS WORD.
[1:31:28] HALLELUJAH. AND HIS ANOINTING COMING
[1:31:30] DOWN AMONG US AND HEALING THE SICK AND
[1:31:32] DOING THE SUPERNATURAL OF GOD. I
[1:31:34] [screaming] GAVE THAT SAME ANOINTING WE
[1:31:36] EXPERIENCE RIGHT HERE IN THIS CHURCH IS
[1:31:38] GOING TO SWEEP OVER YOU AND IN ONE
[1:31:40] MOMENT YOU'LL BE AN OLDER MAN AND THE
[1:31:42] NEXT MOMENT YOU'LL BE TURNED INTO AN
[1:31:44] 18YEAR-OLD BOY.
[1:31:47] [applause]
[1:31:50] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:31:55] [laughter]
[1:31:57] [sighs and gasps]
[1:32:01] Daylight broke. She said the little
[1:32:04] fella had cried all night for something
[1:32:05] to eat.
[1:32:07] What will I do with
[1:32:10] one little handful of meal?
[1:32:15] You know that meal was Christ.
[1:32:18] Any Bible student knows that Christ was
[1:32:20] the meal offering.
[1:32:22] And that meal offering had to be ground
[1:32:24] with a special burr to cut it every
[1:32:26] little piece of the corn the same
[1:32:28] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:32:30] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:32:33] In St. John 4, the father seeketh such
[1:32:35] to worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:32:38] and Jesus was the truth. He was the meal
[1:32:40] offering. Then this oil was the spirit.
[1:32:44] So the spirit mixed with the truth. So
[1:32:48] what's in her house? a handful of meal
[1:32:52] and a little bit of oil.
[1:32:54] She has to take the ingredients to mix
[1:32:58] it together to minister to Elijah his
[1:33:02] cake.
[1:33:04] WHERE'S OUR FAITH? WHEN GOD'S WORD IS
[1:33:06] PREACHED IN ITS SIMPLICITY, THOUGH IN
[1:33:07] ITS POWER THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE same
[1:33:10] yesterday and forever, and the word goes
[1:33:13] forth for the meal, YOU'VE GOT THE OIL
[1:33:17] to mix with it.
[1:33:19] AMEN.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THE WORD COMING FORTH. THEN
[1:33:23] YOU THAT ARE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT,
[1:33:25] YOU'VE GOT YOUR OIL.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD COMING FORTH, HALLELUJAH,
[1:33:30] IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S
[1:33:31] FROM YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER OR NOT. IF
[1:33:33] IT'S THE WORD, YOU SHALL BE ABLE TO
[1:33:35] RECEIVE IT FROM A MAN AND YOU MAY NOT
[1:33:36] EVEN LIKE HIS MAKEUP, BUT YOU'RE NOT
[1:33:38] LOOKING AT HIS MAKEUP. YOU'RE NOT
[1:33:40] LOOKING AT HIS HAIRSTYLE. YOU'RE
[1:33:42] LISTENING FOR GOD TO SPEAK TO YOU.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IF YOU'RE THERE AND YOU'VE GOT
[1:33:46] A NEED AND THAT WORD COMES AND THERE'S
[1:33:49] CHRIST THE MEAL AND YOU REACH UP AND
[1:33:51] GRAB A HOLD OF IT, what are you doing?
[1:33:54] You're mixing your oil
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; with that word.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And the word goes forth for the meal.
[1:34:01] YOU'VE GOT THE OIL TO MIX WITH IT. And
[1:34:04] it may be just a little handful or a
[1:34:06] spoonful,
[1:34:08] but whatever it is, it's real.
[1:34:12] So, you've got the meal. Now, this is
[1:34:14] what she had. And she had the oil,
[1:34:18] but there's one part missing it.
[1:34:21] The cross.
[1:34:25] The cross.
[1:34:29] I want you to notice SHE DOESN'T FIND
[1:34:31] THE cross in her home.
[1:34:35] SHE DOESN'T FIND THE CROSS IN HER
[1:34:37] NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE.
[1:34:39] She's out looking for the cross
[1:34:42] when she runs into Elijah.
[1:34:46] [laughter]
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I thought somebody shot glory on that
[1:34:49] one.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; NOTICE NOW WHAT IS IT READY FOR? It's
[1:34:56] ready for the cross. It's ready for
[1:34:59] self-sacrifice.
[1:35:00] And that's what you have TO DO. IT'S THE
[1:35:02] WORD'S BEEN PREACHED AND YOU'VE GOT THE
[1:35:05] SPIRIT IN MIXED TOGETHER. It's
[1:35:06] self-sacrifice.
[1:35:09] to deny every pain.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Listen [laughter] friends, THIS WILL
[1:35:15] CHANGE YOUR LIFE IF YOU'LL LET IT.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO WHAT THE WORD OF GOD COME IN
[1:35:20] PREACH AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT INTO YOUR
[1:35:21] HEART AND LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN YOUR
[1:35:23] SOUL AS IT CAPTURES THAT WORD. THEN THE
[1:35:26] CROSS WHICH CAN ONLY BE APPLICABLE by
[1:35:29] you.
[1:35:30] YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR CROSS. WHAT WILL
[1:35:34] IT BE?
[1:35:36] SELF-SACRIFICE, to deny every pain, to
[1:35:39] deny every sickness,
[1:35:42] to deny everything that's contrary to
[1:35:45] God's word and stand on it. The doctor
[1:35:49] says this, that, or the other. That
[1:35:50] don't make a bit of difference. You
[1:35:52] stand ON IT BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. THE
[1:35:54] MEAL COMES, you've got the oil, you mix
[1:35:57] it together. HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:00] LOOK AT THE CROSS. WELL, I GOT PRAYED
[1:36:03] FOR ABOUT MONDAY AFTER OH, LORD, AFTER
[1:36:05] THAT SERVICE ON SUNDAY, I I GOT PRAYED
[1:36:07] FOR AND I FELT SO WONDERFUL IN CHURCH ON
[1:36:10] SUNDAY. WOULDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DEVIL
[1:36:11] ATTACKED ME? WELL, OF COURSE HE'S GOING
[1:36:13] TO.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; You've got to take them two pieces,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; them sticks of wood.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; And you got to know what to do with
[1:36:23] them.
[1:36:30] She didn't specify three, four, five,
[1:36:32] six, seven.
[1:36:35] Two,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; a main beam and a cross beam.
[1:36:40] And then she's got to climb up on that
[1:36:43] cross.
[1:36:47] And I hear a voice. It's a little after
[1:36:50] daylight. A voice speaks and says, "Go
[1:36:53] out in the yard
[1:36:55] and get two sticks."
[1:36:59] Did you notice the scripture said two
[1:37:01] sticks for cross?
[1:37:04] She got the meal and the oil, but she's
[1:37:07] going to be called now to act to act
[1:37:09] with it. Ever how much you've got much
[1:37:12] meal or oil as you need, but you've got
[1:37:15] to act. Self- sacrifice.
[1:37:19] two sticks. THE VOICE SAID, "GO THROUGH
[1:37:22] THE YARD. GET TWO STICKS."
[1:37:24] The same time up on the mountain,
[1:37:27] there's a voice thundered down to the
[1:37:29] prophet and said, "Go to the city. I
[1:37:33] have commanded." Oh my. Both of them
[1:37:36] obeyed.
[1:37:38] Something has to happen. Both of them
[1:37:40] are obeying. Oh, glory to God. Can't you
[1:37:44] understand? Malachi 4 is more than just
[1:37:48] brother Brandham. BEHOLD, I GOD SEND
[1:37:52] UNTO YOU, ME.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; YOU, TOO, CAROL. All right. You, too.
[1:37:57] You, TOO. YOU. OKAY. BEHOLD, I SEND UNTO
[1:38:01] YOU. [screaming] ELIJAH THE PROPHET.
[1:38:03] ELIJAH OBEYED GOD. NOW, GUESS WHOSE TURN
[1:38:07] IT IS?
[1:38:09] ELIJAH [screaming] OBEYED GOD. HE
[1:38:11] PREACHED WHAT GOD GAVE HIM. HE STOOD
[1:38:13] AGAINST THE DENOMINATION AND THE CHURCH
[1:38:15] WORLD. NOW IT'S YOUR TURN. OH,
[1:38:18] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:38:18] WE'RE NOT CALLED TO DO WHAT HE DONE.
[1:38:20] WE'RE CALLED TO TAKE OUR LITTLE HANDFUL
[1:38:22] OF MEAL AND OUR LITTLE BIT OF OIL AND
[1:38:24] MIX IT TOGETHER AND CLIMB RIGHT
[1:38:26] [screaming] UP ON THE CROSS AND SAY,
[1:38:28] "HERE, I'LL MANIFEST MY PART."
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; OH,
[1:38:35] thank you, LORD. BOTH OF THEM ARE
[1:38:38] OBEYING.
[1:38:39] She don't know where the sticks will be
[1:38:41] laying, but there's two sticks in the
[1:38:44] yard somewhere.
[1:38:46] She starts off. She goes out in the
[1:38:47] yard. She looks around. Oh, how hot the
[1:38:51] screams from the city. The night prowers
[1:38:55] coming in, scrambling along, drinking
[1:38:58] their wines and so forth. She looks down
[1:39:00] the street, she sees nothing. She finds
[1:39:03] one stick, part of the cross,
[1:39:06] self-sacrifice.
[1:39:08] She gets another piece of the stick. And
[1:39:11] when she picked up the stick and A
[1:39:12] STICK, HOW GLOOMY IT MUST HAVE BEEN. GAS
[1:39:15] LAYING AT THE DOOR. HER AND HER SON HAD
[1:39:17] TO EAT ONE LITTLE PIECE OF A whole cake
[1:39:19] and die. That was all evident. Sometimes
[1:39:21] right in the midst of the gloom that we
[1:39:24] hear the voice.
[1:39:27] [panting]
[1:39:28] When she picked up that second stick and
[1:39:30] started back, there was a voice came
[1:39:33] over the gate and said, "Fetch me a
[1:39:37] little water and a vessel."
[1:39:41] She turned to look with these two sticks
[1:39:43] in her hand with the meal and the oil
[1:39:46] mixed and ready. And she said she
[1:39:48] dressed mixed it together. The word, the
[1:39:51] spirit has to mix. Lay it upon the cross
[1:39:54] of self-sacrifice to deny ANYTHING
[1:39:57] THAT'S CONTRARY to what you've asked.
[1:40:02] Lord, children.
[1:40:08] It shows to me how ignorant sometimes
[1:40:12] people can be. Do you understand there's
[1:40:14] people in the message, even preachers,
[1:40:16] that won't even quote any quotes prior
[1:40:18] to 1963.
[1:40:20] Of
[1:40:21] course, they missed the Holy Ghost
[1:40:23] series.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; That might not have been the only thing
[1:40:28] they missed out of that part.
[1:40:33] What a message
[1:40:35] [sighs and gasps]
[1:40:36] God gave our prophet.
[1:40:39] Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:41] That's right. I MIXED IT. NOW, I'M GOING
[1:40:43] TO GET THESE STICKS. And that voice
[1:40:44] said, "Bring me a drink of water in a
[1:40:46] vessel." She charged back with the
[1:40:47] sticks in her hand. The voice thundered
[1:40:49] again. Not only do you share your water,
[1:40:51] but bring me a little morsel of bread in
[1:40:54] your hand. Bread of life. Water of life.
[1:41:00] Was it of life? Question mark. Should
[1:41:03] die as soon as that perished.
[1:41:07] What we hear then next? But fetch me a
[1:41:09] little cake first.
[1:41:12] Can you believe this man would have the
[1:41:14] audacity?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:17] after she tells him, "I've only got a
[1:41:20] handful of meal and a little bit of oil,
[1:41:22] AND WHENEVER ME AND MY SON EAT IT, WE'RE
[1:41:24] GOING TO DIE." HE SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO
[1:41:25] WAY. NO WAY. MAKE ME one first,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; and you're a servant of God.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PROPHET OF GOD. DIDN'T YOU HEAR
[1:41:36] WHAT I JUST SAID TO YOU?
[1:41:40] THIS IS ALL I'VE GOT LEFT. WE'RE ABOUT
[1:41:42] TO DIE." AND YOU WOULD TAKE THAT FROM MY
[1:41:46] BABY'S MOUTH?
[1:41:52] NO, not exactly.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Sometime God requires a seed.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Sort of like this. You're asking God to
[1:42:03] heal you. No manifestation there yet.
[1:42:07] You're waiting till you get healed where
[1:42:09] you can turn a testimony in, where you
[1:42:11] can praise God. Sometimes God wants the
[1:42:14] seed before you ever get your healing
[1:42:16] manifested. I'm praising you, Lord,
[1:42:19] because I believe you're going to do it.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You know what? And you give him THAT
[1:42:22] SEED AND HE'LL turn right around. And if
[1:42:25] you'll believe him, he'll take care of
[1:42:26] you just like he did her.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; OH MY. NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS,
[1:42:34] WHATEVER IT IS, HOW GLOOMY IT LOOKS,
[1:42:36] WHATEVER IT MAY BE, TAKE GOD FIRST.
[1:42:41] DOCTOR SAID I can't GET WELL, BUT HIS
[1:42:42] WORD FIRST. I'M TOO MUCH OF A SINNER.
[1:42:45] I'M A PROSTITUTE. I'M A GAMBLER. I'M A
[1:42:47] DRUNKER. GOD'S WORD FIRST.
[1:42:51] THOUGH YOUR SINS BE SCARLET, THEY SHALL
[1:42:54] BE AS WHITE AS SNOW, RED LIKE CRIMSON.
[1:42:56] THEY WILL BE WHITE LIKE WOOL FIRST. GOD,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; bring me a little cake first. And Elijah
[1:43:04] said unto HER, "FEAR NOT. GO AND DO AS
[1:43:06] THOU WAS SAID, BUT BRING ME THEREOF a
[1:43:09] little cake first and bring it unto me
[1:43:13] after make for thee and THY SON.
[1:43:18] AND HE SAID, BUT FIRST MAKE ME A CAKE.
[1:43:21] SEEK YE first the kingdom of God and his
[1:43:23] righteousness, and all things will be
[1:43:25] added unto you. Put God first. Put God
[1:43:29] first. God's word first. God's
[1:43:32] principles first. Children, I wonder how
[1:43:35] this little simple thought would totally
[1:43:38] transform our lives if we'd put him
[1:43:41] first in everything.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Above your feelings, above your
[1:43:45] emotions, above what you're going
[1:43:46] through.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Put his word first, put his spirit
[1:43:50] first, put him first. Instead of that,
[1:43:54] we put him last. BRING ME A LITTLE CAKE
[1:43:56] FIRST. WHAT'S SHE GOING TO DO? SEE, HE'S
[1:43:57] obedient to the word. She turns and
[1:43:59] starts not knowing why she's doing it.
[1:44:03] Men and women who LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:44:05] SOMETIME DO THINGS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
[1:44:08] THEY'RE DOING.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:12] TURNED AND STARTED INTO THE HOUSE. THEN
[1:44:14] SHE HEARD THAT VOICE AGAIN, THAT
[1:44:17] GLORIOUS WORD COME FROM HIS MOUTH. THUS
[1:44:20] SAITH the Lord.
[1:44:25] She knew who it was. Then
[1:44:30] the barrel will not be empty. Neither
[1:44:32] shall the cruise run down drown till the
[1:44:34] day the Lord God sends rain on the
[1:44:36] earth. Why? She was willing. She put God
[1:44:39] first.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; This enticing spirits and I'll close you
[1:44:45] in a moment. Give me a preacher. Give me
[1:44:47] a Christian. Give me a housewife that's
[1:44:49] a Christian. A farmer. A factory worker
[1:44:51] that'll put God first in everything.
[1:44:54] I'll show you a man that'll be
[1:44:56] successful in spite of all the devil can
[1:44:59] put on him.
[1:45:03] Oh, I'd like to have a bunch more
[1:45:05] Christians like that filling up these
[1:45:07] chairs at Word OF LIFE CHURCH THAT PUT
[1:45:10] GOD FIRST AT WORK. THEY PUT GOD FIRST AT
[1:45:13] HOME. THEY PUT GOD FIRST IN WHATEVER
[1:45:16] THEY DO. AND THEY'LL BE SUCCESSFUL IN
[1:45:18] SPITE OF EVERYTHING. CAN YOU IMAGINE
[1:45:20] GETTING UP IN THE MORNING AND the
[1:45:22] devil's GOING TO GRABBING THEIR HEADS
[1:45:23] AND SCREAMING DOWN IN HELL, "GOOD LORD,
[1:45:26] HE SURVIVED ANOTHER NIGHT. THERE SHE IS.
[1:45:28] SHE LIVED THROUGH THE NIGHT. LORD HAVE
[1:45:30] MERCY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE TRIED
[1:45:32] THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER. I'VE DONE
[1:45:34] USED EVERYTHING ON MY LIST. I'VE DONE
[1:45:36] EVERYTHING I KNOW TO DO." AND THE DEVIL
[1:45:38] SAID, "GO ON BACK UP THERE AND KEEP
[1:45:39] TRYING. THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY,
[1:45:41] DEVIL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET AROUND
[1:45:42] HER." AND SHE GETS ALL DOWN AND ALL WORE
[1:45:44] OUT AND SHE GETS IN HER CLOSET AND HER
[1:45:46] PRAYING, GOES TO TALK IN SOME KIND OF
[1:45:48] LANGUAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT EVEN IS.
[1:45:50] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE JUMPS UP OUT OF
[1:45:52] THERE. AND IT'S LIKE SHE'S GOT A
[1:45:54] DYNAMITE ON THE INSIDE OF HER. AND THEN
[1:45:56] I HAVE TO COME [screaming] RUNNING BACK
[1:45:57] DOWN TO HELL CUZ I'M TERRIFIED.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Of course, most of us just GET UP. OH
[1:46:08] GOD, I'LL LIVE FOR ANOTHER NIGHT. OH NO.
[1:46:12] OH LORD HAVE MERCY. OH GOD, TAKE ME,
[1:46:15] KILL ME, TAKE ME TO HEAVEN. I DON'T WANT
[1:46:17] TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You need to get some zeal. You need to
[1:46:21] GET A DESIRE.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; GET IN THE WILL OF GOD.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:28] [sighs]
[1:46:31] [gasps]
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I got a few phone numbers I could call
[1:46:34] some preachers if y'all want me to call
[1:46:35] somebody here for Sunday.
[1:46:40] She made the cake.
[1:46:42] She give it to the prophet.
[1:46:46] She went back and made some for her son
[1:46:50] and herself.
[1:46:52] But whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1:46:55] But now, wait a minute. She only had,
[1:46:56] according to her own testimony,
[1:46:59] she only had one handful of meal
[1:47:02] and a little bit of a
[1:47:06] but she made the prophet one first.
[1:47:11] Where did it come from?
[1:47:14] How did it get there? Scientifically,
[1:47:17] tell me where did that meal come from?
[1:47:20] Where did that OIL COME FROM? HOW DID IT
[1:47:22] GET IN the cruise?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; She poured it dry. [screaming]
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Every [clears throat]
[1:47:31] morning,
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Carol, I just about run around my pickup
[1:47:38] when I was down there today. Listen to
[1:47:40] this.
[1:47:42] cuz something clicked to me and I
[1:47:44] realized I thought that's exactly right.
[1:47:47] That's the way we are today sometimes.
[1:47:49] WE THE BLESSING OF GOD COMES SO GREAT
[1:47:53] and it just seemed like it's gone the
[1:47:55] next day. We say, "Well, what in the
[1:47:57] world? Where's where's that LEFTOVER OF
[1:47:59] THAT POWERFUL SERVICE WE WAS IN?"
[1:48:01] [snorts]
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. ANYBODY KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:48:03] TALKING ABOUT?
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; SHE POURED IT DRY EVERY [screaming]
[1:48:08] MORNING.
[1:48:12] SHE EMPTIED
[1:48:14] THE MEAL barrel
[1:48:17] every morning
[1:48:20] and it was dry.
[1:48:22] Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:24] [snorts]
[1:48:25] But when she went back for more, there
[1:48:29] it is.
[1:48:31] When she went back for more, it was
[1:48:35] there.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't that like our God?
[1:48:40] OH, SO IT AIN'T LIKE EVERY DAY. I MEAN,
[1:48:41] HERE'S THIS BIG 55GALLON DRUM AND I
[1:48:43] MEAN, JUST BOUGHT IT OUT. SHE SHOULD
[1:48:45] CLEAN IT OUT EVERY DAY. WHY? IT'S A
[1:48:48] CONTINUAL FAITH WALK.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; SO, IT AIN'T LIKE FAITH WAS APPROPRIATED
[1:48:53] ONE TIME. OKAY, THAT'S IT. PRAISE GOD.
[1:48:55] THAT'S IT, MAN. I don't have to do
[1:48:56] anything else. All I got to do is say,
[1:48:58] get fattest big rat in a barrel. I'M
[1:48:59] ONLY A MAN ALIVE. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
[1:49:01] AWESOME. BUT EVERY TIME SHE'D CLEAN IT
[1:49:03] OUT, BY THE WAY, SHE'D HAVE TO SAY, "BUT
[1:49:06] THE SAME GOD THAT FILLED IT UP
[1:49:07] YESTERDAY, WE'LL FILL IT UP TODAY." OH,
[1:49:10] LORD, I'M I'M JUST REMINDED. I'M JUST
[1:49:12] SAYING ALL THE CORNBREAD'S GONE. ALL THE
[1:49:15] FRITTERS IS GONE. I MEAN, ALL THAT'S
[1:49:17] GONE. LORD, I'M JUST SAYING I AIN'T
[1:49:18] WORRIED ABOUT IT CUZ I DONE SEEN WHAT
[1:49:20] YOU CAN DO. AND I KNOW THAT YOU IS. I
[1:49:23] DONE KNOW THAT YOU IS. AND I KNOW THERE
[1:49:25] AIN'T NOBODY LIKE YOU. YOU'RE A MIGHTY
[1:49:27] GOD. YOU WILL PROVIDE ALL I NEED. LORD,
[1:49:30] I AM CERTAIN OF THAT.
[1:49:33] [applause]
[1:49:42] [laughter] When she went back for more,
[1:49:46] it was there.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Where did it come from? Take God at his
[1:49:51] word.
[1:49:53] Be certain of God.
[1:49:55] He's a creator. You might have lost your
[1:49:57] health. might have lost your fellowship.
[1:50:00] Take him at his word. Be certain that
[1:50:02] he's God. The gloomy times it's looking
[1:50:05] now may not look so gloomy if you'll
[1:50:08] take his word
[1:50:10] and be certain that he's God.
[1:50:13] Let me close with this.
[1:50:15] In Germany once I saw a picture and it's
[1:50:17] always stuck with me. A German painter
[1:50:20] had painted
[1:50:22] the picture that's called the cloudland.
[1:50:25] And when you see it off at a distance,
[1:50:27] it's the horriblest looking gloom you
[1:50:29] ever seen. Just clouds matted together.
[1:50:34] When you're looking at it from a long
[1:50:36] distance,
[1:50:38] but when you get real close to it,
[1:50:42] it changes
[1:50:44] and it's angel's wings
[1:50:47] beaten together.
[1:50:50] Now remember what we've been talking
[1:50:52] about in your little diary box, little
[1:50:53] bride. Here you go. Here's another view
[1:50:57] of angels.
[1:50:59] It's angels wings beaten together
[1:51:03] singing hallelujah
[1:51:06] to the Lord.
[1:51:08] So that's what gloom is
[1:51:12] sometime.
[1:51:15] Wow.
[1:51:16] I need help tonight. Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; You mean a lot of times God has hung
[1:51:26] this great work of art
[1:51:30] and I thought it was gloom and doom.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And it was actually a multitude of
[1:51:35] angels. I felt so alone.
[1:51:40] That's right.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; And I thought he was nowhere around the
[1:51:44] gloom and the darkness and the despair,
[1:51:45] whatever you're going through.
[1:51:49] So that's what gloom is. Sometimes if
[1:51:52] you look at it at a long distance, it
[1:51:54] looks gloomy and dark, but take God at
[1:51:57] his word and be certain that he's God
[1:52:00] and move up close to it and you'll find
[1:52:02] out it's just angel's wings
[1:52:06] beaten
[1:52:08] together.
[1:52:12] Stand together.
[1:52:35] So, are you certain of God tonight?
[1:52:40] No matter what you're facing,
[1:52:45] maybe you've got a wavered son or two or
[1:52:47] three or two, three daughters plus
[1:52:50] husband, father.
[1:52:53] Maybe your family's going through
[1:52:55] something you ever thought you'd go
[1:52:56] through.
[1:52:58] Maybe it's your church family.
[1:53:04] You know how it is. When we get hurt by
[1:53:05] people,
[1:53:07] then it makes us question other people.
[1:53:09] makes us uncertain about other people.
[1:53:12] That's why you need to put your
[1:53:13] certainty up this way.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Be certain of God.
[1:53:20] Cuz you know as well as I do,
[1:53:23] all of us have made plenty of mistakes.
[1:53:26] Anybody in here that hasn't made a
[1:53:27] mistake since you become a Christian?
[1:53:30] Anybody in here that hasn't made a
[1:53:31] mistake today
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; within the last 10 seconds? Anybody?
[1:53:40] So we can't be even be certain about
[1:53:42] oursel.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can always look up this way
[1:53:49] and say, I know I can trust him.
[1:53:52] [snorts]
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; I know I can be certain about him.
[1:53:58] So maybe you ain't got a handful of meal
[1:54:00] tonight in the service. Maybe just a
[1:54:02] teaspoon is all you got. And just a few
[1:54:05] drops of oil
[1:54:07] is what you're containing there. And all
[1:54:09] you got out of the service, you sat
[1:54:11] there and you was fighting the devil.
[1:54:12] And I was running up here like I'm wild,
[1:54:15] man. You're thinking, "What in the
[1:54:16] world's the matter with him? What is he
[1:54:18] doing?" And you just you got a little
[1:54:20] word here, a little word there.
[1:54:23] It don't take that much really.
[1:54:26] So if you got just a little bit and a
[1:54:29] drop or two of oil and if you'll mix it
[1:54:32] together,
[1:54:34] you may not need a cross no bigger than
[1:54:36] two match stems,
[1:54:41] but climb up on there and say, "Lord, I
[1:54:43] don't feel one bit better. The situation
[1:54:46] ain't changed one,
[1:54:49] but I'm going to praise you like it's
[1:54:51] already happened."
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I'm going to love you
[1:54:54] cuz your Bible says the joy of the Lord
[1:54:57] is my strength and I'm tired of being
[1:54:59] sick. I'm tired of being beat down. I'm
[1:55:03] tired of not having no joy. So, I'm
[1:55:06] going to sacrifice tonight and I'm going
[1:55:09] to raise both of my hands
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; and close my eyes and worship you
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; like I feel it
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; even though I don't. And I don't know
[1:55:20] how long it's been since I felt
[1:55:21] anything,
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to put my praise on the
[1:55:26] cross and offer it to you. It hurts my
[1:55:29] arms. It hurts my back. Lord, I can't
[1:55:30] hold them up long. The Lord understands.
[1:55:33] The Lord understands if it hurts you. He
[1:55:36] does. But you know what? He loves you so
[1:55:39] much. And he wants your praise so much.
[1:55:42] If you can only praise him for 10 or 15
[1:55:44] seconds and it's from your heart and you
[1:55:47] have to put your hands back down. It's,
[1:55:48] "Oh Lord, I'm so sorry." He said,
[1:55:50] "That's okay. Rest a few, then put it
[1:55:53] back up again." That's good. That's
[1:55:55] good. Then rest a few, and then put it
[1:55:56] back up again. Praise the Lord. What are
[1:55:59] you doing? You're learning to die on
[1:56:02] your cross. So, what little bit of word
[1:56:03] that you got out of this sermon tonight,
[1:56:05] mixed with what little bit of oil that
[1:56:07] you got left, mix it up in that teen,
[1:56:10] tiny little tiny tiny mixing bowl there
[1:56:13] in your heart. Just [laughter]
[1:56:18] and they say, "Okay, Jesus.
[1:56:20] I got it mixed up."
[1:56:23] And now I'm going to climb up on this
[1:56:24] cross with me and hit together.
[1:56:28] And I want to say I thank you that you
[1:56:30] are.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; You always will be.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; You're my I am. You're my everything.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; You're my mighty God.
[1:56:41] Whatever I need, you are.
[1:56:46] Don't you love him?
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; S.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Can we bury our heads tonight?
[1:56:52] [clears throat]
[1:57:00] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:57:04] Lord Jesus, I pray, Father,
[1:57:08] that you'd help each of us now as we
[1:57:10] open our hearts.
[1:57:13] Not only those in the visible audience,
[1:57:15] but Father, those that streaming as
[1:57:16] well.
[1:57:19] Lord, you alone know all those that are
[1:57:21] streaming and what they're going through
[1:57:22] at this time of their life and
[1:57:25] the things that they faced and what
[1:57:27] they're going through and family
[1:57:30] difficulties, church difficulties.
[1:57:32] You know how discouraging life can be
[1:57:34] sometimes, Lord.
[1:57:37] And it's like your prophet said it so
[1:57:39] well that sometimes you sat silent or
[1:57:44] you lay silent is the word that he used.
[1:57:48] Lord, we want to be the kind of people
[1:57:51] that even in those silent days
[1:57:56] that we trust and we believe and we know
[1:57:59] you're still God.
[1:58:04] For when in reality we know that more
[1:58:07] than likely we'll have more silent days
[1:58:10] than we will those thundering thus
[1:58:12] sayaith the Lord days.
[1:58:16] But it was those silent days that the
[1:58:18] woman had
[1:58:20] that led up to the Elijah visit that
[1:58:24] brought out the thundering voice of God
[1:58:27] out of that prophet's lips.
[1:58:30] If she had not been faithful in those
[1:58:32] silent days, Elijah would no doubt never
[1:58:35] have visited her. But it was her
[1:58:38] faithfulness
[1:58:40] in the silence
[1:58:42] that brought the voice of God.
[1:58:46] Lord, may we look ahead in time and
[1:58:48] realize as we are faithful through the
[1:58:50] trials and the test of life
[1:58:53] and may go through these silent periods
[1:58:55] in our life. Lord,
[1:58:57] our faithfulness and those silent days
[1:59:01] will culminate
[1:59:04] in that one day that we're all waiting
[1:59:06] for
[1:59:08] when the voice of the resurrection
[1:59:11] will speak and our loved ones will
[1:59:13] raise.
[1:59:15] And that same voice will speak to us and
[1:59:20] our bodies will be changed in a moment,
[1:59:23] in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:59:27] It will be worth all the silent times
[1:59:29] we've had. All the silent days.
[1:59:33] Then, Lord Jesus, when we get caught up,
[1:59:37] the days of silence
[1:59:40] will be over.
[1:59:43] For our faith is no longer being tested
[1:59:45] and tried. Faith is now turned into
[1:59:49] sight.
[1:59:51] And at that day, we'll need no more
[1:59:53] faith. Faith will have culminated and
[1:59:56] produced its work.
[1:59:59] And then we'll be able to see you, touch
[2:00:02] you,
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; and you will touch us.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; We'll set across that great table at
[2:00:10] that wedding supper.
[2:00:13] Glory to God.
[2:00:15] And we'll reach across that table to
[2:00:18] those battle scarred soldiers. And we'll
[2:00:21] hug one another and hug one another's
[2:00:23] shake one another's hands. And each one
[2:00:26] of us, the lamb will come down through
[2:00:28] there, stop by our side.
[2:00:31] And we'll raise our head from talking
[2:00:34] and fellowshipping with those around us.
[2:00:37] And we'll look up in your face
[2:00:40] and the tears will stream down our face.
[2:00:42] Maybe the last time we'll ever cry
[2:00:44] tears. I don't know.
[2:00:47] But she'll take her garment,
[2:00:50] put it in your hand,
[2:00:52] and rub it in her eyes and say, "Don't
[2:00:56] cry no more.
[2:00:58] It's all over."
[2:01:02] Oh Jesus, we live for that day.
[2:01:07] We live for that hour. Lord,
[2:01:10] help us tonight. Father,
[2:01:13] Lord, may each of us take our little
[2:01:15] meal and our little bit of oil, mix it
[2:01:18] together,
[2:01:20] may we take the two sticks.
[2:01:23] When that little fire is lit under it on
[2:01:27] the cross,
[2:01:29] it will transform those two elements
[2:01:32] into one. They will be made a cake.
[2:01:38] Praise God.
[2:01:40] We don't want to just be bride seed, but
[2:01:44] we actually want to become bread on your
[2:01:47] table.
[2:01:48] That's what your prophet teaches us also
[2:01:50] in harvest time. For we know the 12
[2:01:53] loaves that was on the table of shoebre.
[2:01:56] And that word shoebre is bread of his
[2:01:59] face or bread of his presence.
[2:02:04] So that bread was set before your face,
[2:02:07] your presence,
[2:02:09] each loaf representing a tribe.
[2:02:12] In the Gentile dispensation, you had
[2:02:14] seven loaves,
[2:02:16] one representing one age, one another,
[2:02:19] one another, one another, on down to the
[2:02:22] seventh.
[2:02:24] And what will the rapture be?
[2:02:27] the New Testament table of shoebre,
[2:02:31] the bread of your face. So we don't want
[2:02:35] to just be seed, but we want to be
[2:02:38] transformed into bread. For you were
[2:02:42] also seed, but you also said, "I am that
[2:02:46] bread which came down from heaven."
[2:02:50] Take our lives, Lord. bring us to
[2:02:52] maturity and then allow that seed to be
[2:02:55] transformed.
[2:02:58] Hallelujah. Into the bread of your face.
[2:03:03] Granted, Lord God,
[2:03:05] we worship you tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:08] May some of them ain't felt you in a
[2:03:10] good while, Lord. And in reality, they
[2:03:12] ain't even felt like praising you. But
[2:03:14] may they raise their hands right here
[2:03:16] tonight,
[2:03:18] lift their voices,
[2:03:20] raise their head as it was up into your
[2:03:22] presence
[2:03:25] and climb up on that cross with their
[2:03:27] hands uplifted
[2:03:29] and say, "Jesus, I love you. I believe
[2:03:33] you.
[2:03:35] I trust you. I know that you are.
[2:03:40] I know that you are.
[2:03:44] Praise God. Praise God.
[2:03:48] Whatever your need is tonight, friends,
[2:03:50] you believe whatever you want to
[2:03:51] believe.
[2:03:53] I believe almighty God directed me this
[2:03:55] way tonight. And I know if he did, he
[2:03:57] did it for a purpose. May not be for one
[2:04:00] purp, one person. Maybe two, three. I
[2:04:02] don't know. It's up to him. I ain't
[2:04:03] worried about numbers. My concern is
[2:04:06] obeying him. Amen.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; If he spoke to you tonight,
[2:04:10] why don't you open your heart to her,
[2:04:12] little bride,
[2:04:13] little woman from Zarapath, you little
[2:04:17] gentile,
[2:04:19] God sent an Elijah message your way with
[2:04:22] thus saith the Lord.
[2:04:25] A sustenance, a sustenance that'll keep
[2:04:28] you in hard times. What is it? Spiritual
[2:04:32] food in due season.
[2:04:35] Hallelujah.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Sing something for us. Let's just
[2:04:43] worship him, can't we? I know you got
[2:04:45] kids got school tomorrow and you got
[2:04:46] work tomorrow. If you need to go, we
[2:04:48] certainly understand that. But if you
[2:04:49] can stay,
[2:04:51] let's just stay and worship him just a
[2:04:53] little bit. If you don't care,
[2:04:56] praise God. Jehovah.

[2:05:34] them there, Lord, for us.
