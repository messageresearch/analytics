[27:08] we'll be coming from another portion
[27:10] scripture he loved him this morning you
[27:19] appreciate him job 35 and verse 10 but
[27:27] none sayeth where is my God my maker who
[27:33] giveth songs in the night and then in
[27:36] and I you know some people call it
[27:39] Ibaka but have a cook and if you have a
[27:42] Scofield Bible it's page 958 so but I
[27:44] think they'll put that on the screen but
[27:46] chapter 3 and verse 17 we want to look
[27:51] says although although the fig tree
[27:53] shall not blossom neither shall fruit
[27:56] being the vines that labor of the olives
[28:00] shall fail and the fields shall yield
[28:02] yield no meat the flock shall be cut off
[28:05] from the fold and there shall be no herd
[28:07] in the stalls yet I will rejoice in the
[28:11] Lord I will joy in the God of my
[28:14] salvation
[28:15] the Lord God is my strength and he will
[28:18] make my feet like Hinds feet and he will
[28:21] make me to walk a poem might hide behind
[28:23] high places
[28:25] a man may the Lord bless the reading of
[28:28] the word you may be seated this morning
[28:30] a man I'd like to take for a thought
[28:32] maybe this morning a song in the night a
[28:35] song in the night and I was thinking
[28:38] about this and for we get started like
[28:41] to read you something may go along with
[28:42] what I want to preach out here brother
[28:44] I'm talked about this it's pretty
[28:46] lengthy but I'll try to you know try not
[28:48] to hurry but just take my time he says
[28:50] it's why I'm a Holy Roller listen what
[28:53] he said and I thought this was real
[28:54] amazing y'all pray y'all have heard this
[28:56] before if you listen taste it I was
[28:58] going not long ago up here in Canada
[29:00] brother Ross misen and I we were going
[29:03] into Canada brother Baxter where he's
[29:05] going way up in the North Woods one
[29:07] night he said one night I was riding
[29:09] alone there with my horse there's a big
[29:12] old thicket of puns I just love the
[29:13] outdoors I love to see God that was my
[29:16] first Bible God in his nature and I
[29:19] looked and I passed by an Old Forest
[29:20] where it used to be a great towering
[29:22] Pines but a burnover had come years ago
[29:26] and burn it all down and it was just a
[29:28] big bunch it looks spooky great big old
[29:31] white trees the moon shining down
[29:33] against them and them just parched white
[29:35] and there came a wind blowing through
[29:38] the mountains and all them trees were
[29:40] doing and making the most mournful scent
[29:42] of and I thought oh my a spooky place
[29:46] then that scripture come on my mind what
[29:49] the Palmer Warren left the caterpillar
[29:52] eaten what the caterpillar left the
[29:54] locust eaten but that was his church I
[29:57] thought truly Lord after the Reformation
[29:59] back under with a with a Catholics left
[30:03] the fundamentals eaten when what the
[30:05] fundamentals left the Presbyterians
[30:06] eaten what the peppered Presbyterians
[30:08] left the baptist eaten what the
[30:10] Baptist's left the Nazarenes eaten until
[30:12] the they eat the thing down but I'll
[30:14] restore saith the Lord hallelujah God's
[30:17] going to have a church I will restore
[30:19] saith the Lord I stood there and
[30:21] wondered and hear God's sending that
[30:23] wind down all them big old trees we're
[30:25] doing
[30:26] I thought that's just exactly like that
[30:28] rushing mighty wind that came from
[30:30] heaven on the day of Pentecost when it
[30:32] strikes them to go cold churches today
[30:34] like around Chicago the only thing they
[30:37] can hear is moan and cry and say the
[30:39] days of miracles has passed fundamental
[30:42] they are trees yes sir they were once a
[30:45] tree the method it's the Baptist to
[30:47] presbyterian the Moody's all the rest
[30:49] they got great big turn spot
[30:51] spires but they that they say the days
[30:53] of miracles has passed because the
[30:56] pummel worm has eaten all the blessings
[30:57] out of the church so there's no more
[30:59] hallelujah is there no more praises to
[31:02] God hallelujah there's no more divine
[31:04] healing speaking with tongues they
[31:06] carried it away
[31:07] tongues dead I stood and looked there
[31:09] came a twin again instead of it bend
[31:11] into it they go whoo I thought that's
[31:13] about like it when God sends a revival
[31:15] in the city they say don't you believe
[31:17] such stuff days of miracles has passed
[31:19] or no such a thing as Holy Ghost dr.
[31:21] so-and-so my well went out then I well
[31:26] then I was discouraged I said Lord you
[31:28] said I will restore and about that time
[31:30] the wind dropped a little lower and when
[31:32] it did I noticed there was some
[31:33] undergrowth coming up hallelujah glory
[31:36] some more little trees they invented
[31:40] they were interdenominational like
[31:42] Israel was God said you'll never be a
[31:44] nation no more and she won't be there
[31:45] was interdenominational and when the
[31:47] winds begin to blow and these little
[31:49] trees begin the wind begin to hit them
[31:51] little trees begin to fall I can jump
[31:53] and dance and carry on about hallelujah
[31:56] I will restore say the same power the
[31:59] Holy Ghost that fell on the day of
[32:00] Pentecost if their moan mournful
[32:02] churches won't the morn and say well I'm
[32:04] a Methodist I'm a Baptist more tone
[32:06] there's an undergrowth coming up
[32:08] hallelujah the life that left the tree
[32:10] but it's coming up again
[32:14] a man he said that's coming up again
[32:17] every time the wind blows them little
[32:19] trees just dig down and get a better
[32:21] hold that's right I will restore safe
[32:24] the Lord God is raising up the first
[32:26] rains done pass the blisters stop the
[32:30] power went out of the church but God in
[32:32] the last days is sin in the latter rain
[32:34] now that's right the part of the Holy
[32:36] Ghost coming back and sure he sins the
[32:38] wind and rains there's a tree standing
[32:40] there to rejoice how happy that was then
[32:43] little trees just have bending with the
[32:44] wind so that when said Jesus Christ the
[32:46] same yesterday today and forever the
[32:49] little tree said hallelujah hallelujah I
[32:51] believe it hallelujah hallelujah I
[32:53] believe it the other tree said in a
[32:55] sense it was fundamentally that was just
[32:57] as much tree as what this little fella
[32:58] was but brother they couldn't be into
[33:00] the spirit and tonight that's what our
[33:03] today that's what the trouble these
[33:05] great big churches can't bend to the
[33:07] spirit because they're so organized
[33:09] it would break up their organization
[33:10] that's right a strong wind is always
[33:12] coming up called backwash and holy
[33:14] rollers hallelujah just as flexible as
[33:17] it can be that's right God life in him
[33:19] that new tree was alive the old tree was
[33:21] dead that's the reason they can't be in
[33:23] because it's dead dead but there's a new
[33:25] birth coming on the ladder rains been
[33:28] poured out in these last days power
[33:29] signs and wonders and the same joy them
[33:32] old trees Jordan long time ago let's

[36:08] begin to beat that ten marine and Moses
[36:09] sang in the spirit amen he begin to say
[36:12] the horse and the rider were thrown into
[36:14] the sea but what about before then what
[36:19] about before then
[36:21] amen before the end what had happened
[36:24] there they were God and gave them a
[36:25] great victory we went out to eat went
[36:27] out of Egypt letting in there and they
[36:29] got to the Red Sea and brother branham
[36:31] said it like this you would think that
[36:33] God him being a
[36:34] the great general that is he'll be the
[36:36] great master of ward everything that he
[36:39] would not need his children right there
[36:41] to the midst of the Red Sea but he
[36:42] wanted to prove he was a man God likes
[36:47] to us and he how does he prove who he is
[36:49] by me and you the believer man how does
[36:54] he prove that he's a healer by being you
[36:56] being sick hey man how does he prove
[36:58] that he's a deliverer by me and you need
[37:01] to deliver hey man brother it was in the
[37:07] night that he proved his love to me
[37:11] sometimes we might not understand the
[37:13] night we might not know why we going
[37:15] through these things but it's God that
[37:17] gives a song hey man and before they
[37:22] could sing hey man they was backed up
[37:25] against the Red Sea amen
[37:26] and then all of a sudden there was
[37:27] favorites on me coming right behind them
[37:32] they couldn't sing then they begin to
[37:35] cry they begin to say god help us maybe
[37:40] goodness a God why'd they be getting the
[37:42] arguing complaining murmuring they said
[37:44] Moses wouldn't be done wasn't there no
[37:46] graves in Egypt that she let us out in
[37:48] this wilderness to die hey man Oh before
[37:54] the song to be sung amen you know
[37:58] sometimes we look at all of our troubles
[38:01] hey man we look at all of our troubles
[38:05] we said my I'm going through a lot I'm
[38:07] going through this and I can't pay my
[38:09] bills amen
[38:10] but we sing that song he's the good did
[38:13] not show up on time did not pay your
[38:15] bills for you amen just to prove what
[38:18] just to prove my love for you man
[38:23] like I said we sang songs we sang songs
[38:25] of victory we sang songs of peace we
[38:28] send songs of deliverance but will we go
[38:31] through it words that had a man I've
[38:34] seen people get up and they and then
[38:37] they sang songs and they said I'm
[38:38] shelter let the dark clouds row let the
[38:41] storm clouds
[38:43] I'm sheltered safe within the arms of
[38:45] God and then they go through a trial
[38:50] they go through a battle and they give
[38:54] up on God
[38:55] where's your shelter at then a man that
[38:58] they sung that song where's your shelter
[39:00] at they're my shelter is still in the
[39:03] arms of God and you can only say that if
[39:07] it's real to you it's gotta be made
[39:10] known to you it's gotta become real to
[39:13] you hey man it's gonna use it might be

[39:35] so we look at all of our troubles and we
[39:38] looked at all of our trials that we go
[39:40] through and we look at all our failures
[39:42] and we look at all this around us and
[39:45] what we fail to do is look up to the
[39:47] hills from which cometh our help and our
[39:50] help coming from God hey hey man I know
[39:53] my help comes from him this morning hey
[39:57] man the one who gives Mercy's the one
[40:01] who gives grace the one who gives peace
[40:03] hey man the one who gives joy amen the
[40:06] one who incur David had to encouraged
[40:09] himself in the Lord amen when he was
[40:11] going through a great battle there he
[40:12] was physically I had been burned a man
[40:16] and all this family there and nothing
[40:19] his soldiers his men that were behind
[40:22] him their wives and their children their
[40:24] sons and their daughters had been taken
[40:26] captive a man and so David a man that
[40:30] the Bible says that they picked up rocks
[40:32] to stone David a man they picked up
[40:36] rocks to the stone David but the Bible
[40:39] says that David begin to encouraged
[40:41] himself in the Lord
[40:42] why because he remembered said my god
[40:45] delivered me one time and if God
[40:48] delivered me one time he could do it
[40:50] again
[40:51] and he encouraged himself in the Lord
[40:53] amen if God held me one time he could
[40:57] help me again and that's why we are
[40:59] encourage ourselves in him then this
[41:01] morning very mad if he live with me one
[41:05] time he can deliver me again if we
[41:11] brought me out of one trial surely it
[41:13] can bring me out of this one and he
[41:17] encouraged himself in the Lord Amen I
[41:22] think every now and then would it be
[41:25] good for me and you to do is take our

[41:30] what God has done a man and begin to
[41:33] count our blessings one by one Amen we

[48:06] cleaning you know buffing floors and
[48:09] different places emptying trash for
[48:10] about 30 years
[48:11] and most of my time that I've been at
[48:13] have been in some sense of Western world
[48:14] work in connection with what maybe the
[48:17] military or something like that because
[48:18] I when I lived in Texas I worked at a

[49:11] want to try it so I don't know if they
[49:13] really had to but it's only it's
[49:15] demonstrated here you can stand up and
[49:17] we was tested and tried amen and the
[49:21] only way that the power or the gospel
[49:23] can be fully shown
[49:25] when you go through a trial or go
[49:28] through a battle and then we know that
[49:31] this gospel Willie works or not I say it
[49:34] works hey man
[49:39] hallelujah but part of the gospel can be
[49:42] fully shown only when the Christian is
[49:44] subjected to some fiery trial hey man
[49:49] family's been through free trial and
[49:51] you're still here you ought to give God
[49:53] praise and glory they're still pressing

[1:07:37] depended on Elvis he even said that even
[1:07:43] said that this woman one time was in a
[1:07:48] bank to conduct some business and just
[1:07:50] so happens that was Presley was in there
[1:07:52] and so Elvis walked out and she was a

[1:08:23] because they tell me he was miserable
[1:08:24] any man he was so uh he was a very
[1:08:28] secure he was miserable a man and I
[1:08:30] wonder if he ever listened to what the
[1:08:32] Prophet said he sold out his birthright
[1:08:33] for a fleet of Cadillacs I wonder what
[1:08:36] he thought then
[1:08:37] Amen but many brothers and sister God

[1:09:06] Lord hey man he said he would rejoice in
[1:09:13] the Lord and be joyful
[1:09:14] God is the inexhaustible source an
[1:09:16] infinite supply of joy God my Savior is
[1:09:22] Villere the god of my salvation a man
[1:09:25] cuz Psalms 1846 says it like this the
[1:09:29] Lord liveth and blessed be my rock and
[1:09:32] let the God of my salvation be exalted
[1:09:35] hey man

[1:09:40] by truth and teach me for thou art the
[1:09:44] God of my salvation on thee do I wait
[1:09:46] all the day
[1:09:48] hey man too many people keep trying to
[1:09:51] buy joy but to buy joy but happiness is
[1:09:55] not found in circumstances hey man
[1:09:59] happiness is not found in circumstances
[1:10:01] hey man like I said before I might have
[1:10:04] said it here I preached the message one
[1:10:06] time to door the Lord and they said joy
[1:10:08] and happiness it's two different things
[1:10:09] happiness comes from the word happer
[1:10:12] happen in other word for you to be happy
[1:10:14] something has to happen you have to get
[1:10:16] the raise on the job and then you're
[1:10:17] happy you have to do this or they don't
[1:10:20] they have to sing your favorite song are
[1:10:22] you happy but joy comes from a different
[1:10:24] source that comes from the Lord God
[1:10:26] Almighty amen
[1:10:27] and if they don't say my favorite song
[1:10:29] if they don't give me the Rays of the
[1:10:30] law on the job my joy is still in the
[1:10:33] Lord
[1:10:33] and the joy of the Lord is my strength
[1:10:39] hey man
[1:10:41] hallelujah hey man so I don't matter
[1:10:45] happiness is not found in circumstances
[1:10:48] but joy is available to everyone even to
[1:10:50] those who are stripped of every material
[1:10:52] possession
[1:10:54] hey man for joy is found in the person
[1:10:56] Christ Jesus it comes to an intimate and
[1:11:01] personal relationship with the Lord so
[1:11:03] even in the worst circumstances we can
[1:11:06] smile
[1:11:09] hey man used to sing a song I forget
[1:11:12] what it was don't let Satan see that
[1:11:14] frown smile Amen because just over there
[1:11:17] hey man
[1:11:18] coz joy comes in the morning hallelujah
[1:11:20] the unfailing source and confidence
[1:11:23] necessary just satisfaction and
