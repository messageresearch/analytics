grateful for that tonight thank you brother Jordan what a blessing it is to be under the protection of his wings and this hour will live him amen me brother Daryl was just talking about before I came out if a prophet whenever he was here in his day was talking about the world groping and Insanity can you imagine what he'd say now about how dark it is and the spiritual condition of of the world our natural state of our our nation and the nations of the world come Lord Jesus is what I say Amen Let's uh turn tonight if you would to numbers chap 1 verse 52 remember the U youth meetings that'll be going on this weekend brother Matt Watkins and um just looking for the Lord to come in a special way did yall announce it already to announce it okay um not only for the Youth of course but brother mat be speaking to to the whole church on Sunday so we're looking forward to that as well always appreciate brother Matt's Ministry numbers 1 verse 52 how many believes it's important to find your position your position in Christ of course and then your position in in the in the body um your position in the home we know it's a very important thing to God many people don't put much relevance on it they just do whatever and whenever and however but our God has always been a god of order divine order that's what we want and I've said it before and I've said it again tonight probably said it many times as we go on we're so against organization if we're not careful we'll be against organism and divine order and if you don't think the prophet taught divine order type it in and you'll find out the Bible is filled with it that's not the same thing as organization there's a difference in man organizing something and God setting it up by his word I was looking at it today where Paul had told the Believers in the first church age to be followers of him he mentioned it several times and he also told them to be followers of the church churches so I just clicked on that y'all think I'm really smart I ain't really too smart I just click and get the meanings of them words so I just clicked on that and it took me straight to the Greek Lexicon and the meaning of the word was to be a follower of him was to be an imitator an imitator come here you you I want you to imitate me I want you not to do something different now which one looks like me neither one of them look exactly like this thing that's for sure but which one is imitating me you choose so what about preachers then if we've got one that s what the Bible said and one what the prophet said then we've got one that ain't thank you brothers so we want to be imitators of Christ right now watch this numbers chap 1 ver 52 and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own Camp every man by his own standard throughout the host chapter 2 verse two every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard with the ins sign of his father's house far off about the Tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch Isaiah 5919 so shall they fear the the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord which is ruach ruach Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him so the enemy comes in and when he does then the spirit of God lifts up a standard which is an inside what is it a flag it's an identification a message if you will it's so you know where to stand so the enemy comes in like a flood and whenever he does God raises up a sign and the elect of God are looking looking looking like everybody else is looking looking where do we go where do we go where do we go and God raises up the flag and said this is the box of the hour this is the anointing you're supposed to live by walk by talk by and in our age be raptured by Joel chapter 2 verse 7 they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War and they shall March everyone on his ways now remember this is a prophecy of the last days of the army of God and they shall not break their ranks so if this is a prophet prophecy what do you figure the devil's going to do try to get us as the people of God to break that prophecy right and see this is not making that you oh I there ain't no God I I've just made up my mind there ain't no God no that's not people like that it's simply just to try to talk them out of the will of God for their life and then they will break the rank so God predetermines and pre assigns your rank and then Satan will do his best to pull you out of it how many light to be remembered tonight as we pray let's just hold our needs our requests and our heart before the Lord Heavenly Father we love you so much we thank you for your word we thank you for the insign that's been raised in every age we're grateful for those ins signs in the past we're grateful for the ins signs that will be raised during the time of the tribulation period for it will be a gathering again of your people not your bride but Lord are we so grateful in this day that you have sent an anointing an ins sign an Insignia that we might be able to be identified with it help us tonight father that each of us can each and every individual men women boys girls no matter who we are what our age what our color authenticity help us father to be more more determined than ever before to find our place and to war in that place and not let no Devils our mama our daddy no preacher no prophets no prophesied that place in Christ Jesus granted father it's in Jesus name we pray and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I'd like to go back to that that are read to you last Wednesday night from the fifth seal now the prophet has a little box there where people would give prayer requests and prayer clause and things like that and he says I'm going to set this box up here to represent that and what he's talking about is that God would release a certain anointing in every day and the people of the day the elect of God could only operate under that anointing that God gave to them and he gives us the four powers that was released from the The Book of Revelation of course and the first one was influenced by the very Life of Christ himself which was the line of the tribe of Judah and then we had the ox or a a sacrificial uh beast and then we had the face of a man and then we had a flying eagle I'm sure that all of you all already know it but three out of those four are Earthbound the lion Earthbound the ox Earthbound the the man Earthbound and the force was a flying eagle was the anointing that Paul and the first church age operated under tremendous absolutely tremendous anointing but it could not produce a Rapture now think of it none of them in the first church age took a Rapture there was not a Rapture message it was a church message a burst message baptism of the Holy Ghost message but it was also a burial message a burial of the seed of God that was going to be crushed and going to die out in the alpha stage and then it would bring a resurrection so none of them had a Rapture even the Beloved Apostle Paul which was able to go into the third Heavens hear things that was not lawful for him to utter tell the Saints when he come back but yet that he did not have a Rapture he went by the way of the grave and is there of course to this day in the sixth Dimension waiting for the resurrection then we move from that anointing to the ox anointing not one of them had a Rapture there was not a church in that anointing that had a Rapture moved from there to the man anointing which come right up and joined into ours not one of them had a Rapture not a one of them churches was caught out but prophecy says that there will in the last days be those who will have a Rapture now listen there have been those of course that have lived under the eagle anointing and many of them have also died many of them have come to the spot to where their life was terminated as we know but they live their life walk their life and believe the light of the day under the message of the hour and they were partakers in that their souls were already quickened now remember the token was not in the middle Church ages the token was not under the man anointing the token was not under the ox anointing but the token was to return in the last day in the evening time remember the prophet says it himself it's evening time for me it's evening time for you when when the token is to return in its fullness now did they have a portion of the spirit of God they did lucer had a portion of the spirit of God but he didn't have enough to help him lay down his PO his pipe neither did they had enough to quit drinking their beer come on now but yet there was a fullness that was going to return in the last day now under that anointing it will be some of the same things remember God can never give a revelation and then send somebody else with another Revelation contrary to that one God can send a revelation and then God will add more to that Revelation and as the prophet says it in the church AG's book it will simply be more information about the same thing but it will not be contrary you know that God cannot say one thing and then say something else so God would not send a prophet in this day and send me or any other man and that would say something the exact opposite of what that Prophet said absolutely not he might send other men and they'll be gifted in other ways and they might make it you know in an Evangelistic way or in a teacher way but they'll not say one thing contrary and be led of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost has one mind and the church said so what is then this anointing in the last day so what is released to us in order to bring it to pass now he goes on to say now he'll prove it to you by the history of the church and by the opening of those seals and the powers that let loose watch exactly the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else so now think of people that are still operating and we've got millions of them that are still operating under the man anointing so they will take the word and they study it and they oh my that they do a great job with it while they can write Christian books Christian bookstores are full of books written by Christian authors and they approach the gospel from what view not from the Flying Eagle but from the man so they bring it from the psychological side and they would got Christian therapist and Christian this and Christian that on how to love your wife and how to be a better man how to do this what's it all dealing with the mind to try to be able to you know a psycho analysis to where that they can be able to set you down and know your problem is this you know you had these issues when you were a child and this is what made you this way let's talk about it and let's bring it out that'll help you deal with it better no a lot of times it's a spirit it ain't got nothing to do with just that and you read them books and you say oh I'm a better man I'm a better man and you still don't have the power to be able to overcome sin why because it's working on the mind again and what's sad about it is friends we've got message preachers that have done exactly the same thing and they're still doing the same thing to this very day to try to take the message and change it just modify it a little bit just whitewash it a little bit you know we we can preach the message without mentioning where we got it oh why in the world would you want to do that you know Paul told him he said don't be ashamed of the gospel and don't be ashamed to me his messenger what in the world is a matter with a preacher that ain't got enough guts to stand up and tell where he's getting what he's preaching I call that a chicken I said I call that a chicken I knew them guys back in Pentecost but a real anointed servant of God is not ashamed to tell of where he feing because he knows he's going to stand to be identified with that Prophet messenger of the age now do I thank God for the man anointing I do I appreciate it with all my heart I've been privileged by the grace of God to operate under two phases of the anointing and that is I was called under the man anointing I preached under the man anointing I lived under the man anointing so and by do doing that I used to despise those years that I spent under that man anointing I did I despise it I thought it was a waste of time but as I went on I realized the Lord allowed me to be under that man anointing so whenever I come to the eagle anointing and when the man anointing started penetrating around the eagle anointing I would be able to look back and said I've already been in that and I don't want to repeat of that that myself I've done been there and done that and I know what that produces come on but you see some of the message people never were really in Pentecost so someone could come in with a Pentecostal anointing and they wouldn't even know it they could start doing things that I've done in Pentecost when I was a boy preacher and they wouldn't even know it at all they wouldn't even know it and they just swallow it right down and think well glory be to God my this here he goes it's a bride's Revival how many of them have we had anyway how many bride revivals have we had and every one of them points back to a man who come up with the idea well that tells me enough right there it ain't a bride's Revival cuz a Brides Revival comes from Heaven it don't come from New York it don't come from Johnson City it don't come from Virginia it don't come from Louisiana or Canada or come on somebody or Nigeria it didn't originate in Jeffersonville it originated in the streets of gold there you go but now watch what Satan will do again to try to get the army of God to break their ranks to break their ranks now you see if he cannot get you to belittle what you are then he'll try to get you to overshoot what you are it makes him no difference whichever works for you is what he's happy with so for some they you know they feel like they're never really used that much and we know how it is for some people position means everything to them I've seen people that would trade off eating a seven course meal for eating out of a garbage can because the garbage can offered them a position and yet setting there feeding on a seven course meal they might not be used near as much but to them what really matters is position anyway well let me tell you something when you go to talking like that you're talking the devil's talk can you imagine Lucifer the bright shining angel that he was and he forfeited being the right-and man of God the right-hand man to Fellowship the angel or the Cherub who stopped the approach so any angels that would come up to the throne of God they had to come up to Lucifer first that's his original name day bringer lar all that so the Angels would have to come up to Lucifer and Lucifer then would inquire of them what seeky of the master what do you want he was the anointed cherub and God said him so and he traded all of that to become what we know today as the devil can you can you imagine that a being would trade all that he was to become the devil which is my goodness an object that we have heard about our entire life that is going to be destroyed and yet that angel Satan was the greatest person in heaven outside of God himself was given great traits and characteristics and the only angel that was given Godlike traits except he was not a Creator he was more of the divine nature more of the Divine traits and characteristics but he could not stand being second place in heaven now you watch then so when Satan will begin to move on people men women boys girls whatever it is and try to get them to craving after a position or something that God himself maybe has not called them to do but they're convinced that God has but you see we know the way that God deals in his Divine protocol and that is that God deals with his creature in the way that he's made it so the prophet said a man that claims that he's called to be a pastor well he said a pastor cannot be a flighty type of person and he said if a man claims he's called to be a teacher watch how he interprets the word so if a man claims he called to be a gospel preacher gospel teacher and he will say well we don't we don't need that that that that end time message stuff well let you know right there that man ain't really called of God why watch how he interprets the word well if he goes to Reading in there and he reads the Bible and he comes out with three Gods well you know right there is not called to be able to interpret the word because God gifts him according to what he's claimed that he's called to be so and how do we judge it then by Apostolic order now some people as I said they're so against the you know the organization and all that and they don't even study the scriptures close enough to realize that the framework of Satan's Antichrist move of organization was stolen from the passages of the very Bible they hold in their lap uhhuh what's this in the Ephesian Church age this is from the church age book page 66 thus what the church was as Pentecost is the standard now in other words this the word standard here is one of the same words that was used in the Old Testament that we just read there in the book of numbers by his own standard or by his own Insignia so here the same thing is used in the New Testament the prophet uses so the Pentecostal church is the standard now what kind of church was it a church that was born of the spirit of God they did not have church membership you did not join it you were born into it you did not get into it because you was a man of wealth and because you a wealthy person they gave you a position in the church that's not the way they done it but they actually they were led by the spirit of God and the Holy Ghost would tell them separate me Paul and Barnabas so there was none of this stuff well there's brother so and so back there he's quite wealthy so let's make him a a position in the church and as long as you know we do that we we'll kind of appease him and uh and he'll He he'll all the time contribute a whole lot to the church yeah and every one of them guys come with an agenda too and then you cross them and they'll pull their money from you and then you're led by businessmen instead of being led by the Holy Ghost come on brother Donnie preach well you see that is the standard so then when you see a church that is being formed and you watch the pastor and you watch the the people in position and they go to picking people and giving them positions because they know the makeup of that man and that man and that man and they know if he don't get a position he won't stay now I know friend I know you don't even want to hear this but I'm got to tell you there's Pastors in this message that study by psychology they study people's makeup well enough to know when a man wants and needs a position and they will give him one if they can pull him from another church that is and in order to let them do this and that and the other and then people will fall right in for it come on Brother Don and then we claim we Apostolic well I'll tell you what I'll do I'll tell you what I'll do I'll apologize for tonight's sermon if you show me that in the Bible and if I can show you where it ain't you need to apologize to me after the service is over for thinking what you just thought praise the Lord now are we Apostolic or do we just think we are now what so here is the standard the church at Pentecost there is no other pattern no matter what Scholars say God has not changed the pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close how many word of alive believes this quote well I'd like to know why some people think God's changed the pattern we got folks around this message they don't even believe in Preachers well God has to change the pattern there somehow they think the end time is just push and play and Obey you show me that quote that had a quote brother Ram said that's something somebody made up it might make a nice cliche but it's not in the teachings of the word of God come on somebody say Amen what if you can't say Amen say ouch or at least seek him or something so I know you're listening to me now notice what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages closed how many believes the church age is still on going and the lead of sin age will close with the Rapture of the body change now watch's this in page 67 the promise of the power with which the apostles were uted Pentecost is to you Jews and your children Jews and to all them a far off Gentiles to as many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and Gentile until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not now when preachers try to take quotes from the same message and make it sound like brother Brandon was against Pentecost I wonder what they're led by well come on now remember the prophet was a great balancer and if he would be at Jack Moors he would say certain things if he'd be among the brother out there in Arkansas in 1963 and you hear him preaching on once more and then you hear him go back to the Tabernacle and described them Services now he said some of you all were there he said that group of people was was leaning in a certain way and God led me to try to pull them out of that direction now you see that's where preachers have got to be so careful when we go to pull in quotes together and to make sure that we're following the continuity of the spirit of God because you can pull a quote here and one there and one somewhere else and you put them together glory to God I'm saying exactly what the prophet said you mean you're put you're saying exactly what the prophet said and them three places that don't mean that's all he said about that certain subject so we got people say well we're Beyond Pentecost and we don't need that no more well I'm afraid we've got an issue right here then because that same Prophet also said that it will not cease the Pentecostal message and power will not cease and Word of Life said notice again what the church had at Pentecost is her I love this quote inalienable right here we go the bride's rights it is our right well I want them I said I want them it is oh Hallelujah it is our right notice what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manif fested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost and yet if we see that today in some message churches then you are lied at you are ridiculed do you understand some of our services portions of them are played in certain message churches and are played to be ridiculed Brother Louie is tuck of certain little clips and certain clips of our songs and other churches that are played before congregations and we are used as an example to prove Pentecost well they use it to shame us I counted a great honor I counted an honor to be identified with people that still believe in Acts 238 acts 2:4 Mark 16 come on somebody I'm glad to be identified with a group of people that believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever he still heals the sin he still Saves The Lost he still baptizes with the Holy [Applause] Ghost that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word Oh Glory pattern how many believes it how many wants our church to be exactly the same way well tell me how it is now my wife is a seamstress her grandmother taught her to First SE and she was what three years old something like that she set Carol up on her lap and she had one of the more meal machines you sisters understand what I'm talking about and she would she Carol's feet of course couldn't even reach it so her grandmother would sit there and pedal the thing and she would show Carol how to turn a seam and so she's a absolute beautiful seamstress of what she can do and I've helped her before on our bar whenever she'd lay out something and she'd make a pattern and she'd take and maybe she got patterns that she's used for years find a good skirt cuz we're the skirt church and have a skirt pattern and use the same pattern well wouldn't it be really odd if she laid out that pattern and cut a skirt size six and she did that for the first year and then two years later she made another out of the same pattern three years later four years later five years later and then 15 years later she lays out that same pattern and I hear out walks my wife with a dress instead of being down here is way up here and I said Carol Jean what in the world are you doing why Donnie this was made from the same pattern that you bought me it's Mall's number 6307 don't you remember you bought it down there in Somerset Kentucky at that fabric store well no I may not remember that but you're trying to tell me it's the same pattern as that one that you made the skirt off of two years ago five years ago you understand where I'm going don't you if it's the same pattern laid out on the same type of people people won't it do the same stuff won't it act the same way won't they believe the same stuff brother Jack if we get the pattern and we lay it out on the same type of fabric it will produce what Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever the unchanging God with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God than judge by that standard praise the Lord that is how it is done so let's just be honest it makes no difference how big our church is makes no difference how nice the carpet is how nice everything looks that's not what God's going by if Our Lives don't match the pattern if them acts two Christians we'll miss the Rapture as sure as there's a God in heaven amen oh but Brother D I believe God said a prophet no you got to believe that plus you got to believe what that Prophet said will produce a holy life is that right now notice that is how it's done the true church will always try to be like the original did you say that out loud yes I did well my goodness are you a Pentecostal sir don't tell me we've got Pentecostals in here tonight Lord have mercy you mean the true church will try to be like that original church so at PA went they won't be going if Paul preached women ought to have long hair then what do you figure preachers of today is going to preach I tell you what some of them's going to preach nothing they ain't even going to mention it no they're not going to mention it well I'm afraid I'll run people off how do you know that ain't the very thing that'll bring them to the Lord God I listened to the testimony of a young man a while back this brother had been backslid away from the Lord he got in a real nervous State and he said God I've got to have some help I need help bad it wasn't where he needed to be with the Lord at the time so he didn't call the pastor he didn't go to the church in the area where he was but he went to a medical place not too far from where he lived so he goes in there he sore all the pieces his nerves is a bundle you know just tied up in knots he don't know what to do and just got a lot of trauma in his life he's sitting in there with his head down the door opens in walks a woman with a pair of sandals on he notices immediately her toenails ain't pink or or green or purple as he raises his head and he looks up at her and there stands this medical person in a dress long hair he told me the spirit of God oh he knew what he needed to do anyway but when he saw that example of the word walk into that office to be able to minister and to him she ministered unto him by her clothes before she ever wrote him a prescription Hallelujah tonight that man that young man is sitting back in the church where he's needed to be all along back in fellowship and it wasn't a preacher standing there pointing his finger in his face it was not somebody prophesying over him it was a daughter of God with her long dress and her long hair Hallelujah why a life live by the word is the word expressed sisters don't you let the devil intimidate you by the world you are a living [Applause] testimony oh my and remember when the prophet was carried beyond the curtain of time he saw no women in pants neither did he see any men in shorts W thank you Jesus I'll say it again if you wrinkle your nose too bad on me he didn't see no women in many skirts on there was no trans people there the only trans people were transformed a people I believe in that kind of transor I believe in being transferred from a homosexual to a son or daughter of God I'm being transferred from a cigarette suck and drunk oh my to a Son of God so full of the Holy Ghost that the devil don't want nothing to do with you the devil can't stand it cuz you're so much like Jesus the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one the messengers to the churches had the same spirit of God in them amen and Tred to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like it but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul yes Lord who was free of all men sold out to God Gave for us a word of God only manifested the Holy Ghost and power none else would do you have to work from the original is there anybody in this building tonight dumb enough to believe this was made from an apron of an elephant you don't think so is there anybody here tonight lost your senses so much you can believe this was made from a pattern of blue jeans thank you so what would you want to suggest to me tonight that this was made from the pattern of anyone a Barbie dress a clown outfit what boy your brothers are so vocal tonight so brother Tom horac says that no doubt the way he's looking at this this was made from a pattern of a handkerchief how many of you all would agree with brother Tom dear God some of y'all didn't raise your [Laughter] hands so somebody please explain to me how that we are producing message churches socalled message preachers so-called messing Christians so socalled that make fun of people with a Holy Ghost I know you don't understand it but there is a move right now around us friends that so against the move of God they're scared to death of emotion Oh Brother Don I'm scared bro going to get in the flesh I've been in it all my life I'm trying to get out of it oh Lord why why in the world would you want to lead people back to Pentecost I ain't leing back to Pentecost God's the one doing that I ain't talking about 1906 I'm talking about that original I realize what makes it hard is we've got two time frames called by the same name there was no two Lucen dispensations there was no two Wesleyan dispensation but we've got two called by the same name the original Pentecost and then the restoration of gifts and if we're not careful we will merge the two together and try to put them under the original name thank you Jesus brother how we going to judge it simple by the word any Spirit that'll lead you away from one scripture is not the Holy Ghost any spirit is is not of the Holy Ghost that won't lead you to God's word now let's jump down a bit he said you had to work from the original as like begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost oh my goodness so you mean we're going to have to follow some men wow that sort of sounds like an army don't it some of y'all was in the military right some of y'all I saw you raise your hands for Veterans Day and all that we so appreciate your service thank you so did they just send you all out there to do whatever y'all thought best go at her boys I'm going back to the house it's dangerous out here I'm leaving or did you have to follow orders now why do you say GL to God I'm a against organization Hallelujah they'll send your parts home in a box M notice this let's take a little journey tonight let me let the journey with me for a bit you got some time don't you now let's look at this New Testament Church let's look at the founder now Matthew 16 18 this is the founder himself and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so truly every church that you passed on your way to here tonight Jesus did not build it every message Church Jesus did not build it a lot of them are men built just like organizations are just built by man out of jealousy or whatever more I hope and pray by the grace of God ours is built by Jesus Christ himself if it isn't it'll never endure but the way we can check it is our foundation our motives our objectives are lined up with God's word so now Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church notice acts 1 vers vers one Luke of course wrote this and he said the former treaties have I made o Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken after he had through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen now notice here's the man himself the Lord Jesus who said on this rock I will build my church then Jesus transfers the Commandments unto the apostles notice acts 1 and3 to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallable proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God Acts chapter 2: 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayers so here the original church was built upon the doctrine of the Apostles praise the Lord amen and what was that Doctrine what did they teach repentance baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus I've got a series I hope the Lord lets me preach to you before we get raptured if not we won't worry about it anyway but you know we have folks for years saying they're leaving the message so what I've been doing is taking by the scripture and accumulating and proving by the scripture every doctrine that we believe in the message new births by the scripture sanctification by the scripture baptism of the Holy Ghost by the scripture justification by Faith by the scripture Apostles Doctrine by the scripture and then when you come right down to it so say when you're leaving the message what do you leaving justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Holiness righteousness before God on and on and on it goes and it's true about a lot of them because you can see the way they dress when they leave it that's what they leave behind now watch in Ephesians 2:19 here Paul says now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophet you mean the Lord Jesus is not the foundation hello are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so the Chief Cornerstone is laid upon the foundation so what's the first building Stone of the New Testament Church the beginning of that New Testament Church is Jesus himself oh Hallelujah upon what the the apostles and the prophet are the foundation so from the Old Testament the coupling together of the prophets of the Old Testament and the Apostles of the New Testament then what did they do they laid upon that new dispensation the foundation block the first one which was Jesus Christ himself praise God in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit now this is Apostolic Doctrine that the Holy Ghost is to live in each of our souls and we are to become the very temple of God on the earth and we are a temple that grows together and moves together and flows together in the direction of God that's the way they moved can't you see why Satan loves contention Among Us and if he can't cause you adults to argue with one another he'll cause your kids to argue with one another which in turns make you all argue because of course each one of you is going to take up for your kids cuz most of you unlike me and Carol Alicia and Erica uh we got just regular human beings for our kids and they need to be corrected and whooped and all that sort of thing but I realize some of you had little angels which come down with little T90 Wings on their back and they flew around their crib room didn't they oh you did darling you y'all y'all was little young on they just flew around in the crib and they just co co angel tongues I reckon who you think you're fooling come on your children is as rotten as mine and mine was as rotten as yours was everyone born lost and on our way to hell and we needed to be regenerated by the spirit of God don't you go to putting a bunch of wings on the back of them young ones and convincing them they don't need the Holy Ghost you better tell them without the Holy Ghost they lost Ephesians chapter 3:5 which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit second Peter 3:2 that you might be mindful of The Words which are spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment yes sir do you understand Peter's words is not a suggestion Paul's Epistles are not suggestions they are the words of God Amen praise the Lord the Commandment of us the apostles wow what a statement of our Lord and savior now let's notice how did this Apostolic Ministry how did they work together how did they do acts 8:14 now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John what so the apostles heard that Samaria had received the word of God and the Apostles sent preachers right now you see if we're not careful we're so against organization we will deny our Apostolic roots and breaking ranks from the original teaching of scripture thinking we're standing on what's right no no sir no sir no this is the original on Church well I'm sorry y'all didn't know this was in your Bible so you should spend more time in this book instead of on face book oh brother night that's only one scripture that's cuz I'm just getting started I got a lot more now notice in Samaria had received the word of God they sent it to them Peter and John Peter and John Peter and John were sent somewhere Acts 9: 26 when Saul was come to Jerusalem he Sav to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him if you and I been living there we would have been too and believe not that he was a disciple they had good reason not to didn't they but I want you to notice how God brought Paul in to be able to get influence among the people now this is the church Aid's messenger now why he say glory to God I feel that of the Lord to you bunch of serpent seed if you you don't want to receive me that's up to you go to hell I want you to notice how this man being a preacher now you see a preacher that can't be taught is not a real leader at all he's a dictator come on now watch but Barnabas took him you mean to tell me that Paul the church age messenger submitted himself to a man of lesser understanding less calling less degree as far as the presence of God was concerned and let this lesser man introduce him that he could gain favor but Barnabas took him and brought him oh no to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he preached boldly at Damascus you imagine now Paul the great orator the prophet of God standing there Justin just listening or Barnabas is saying he's okay Brothers really honestly he okay the man got converted I mean God done this for him God done that for him Paul just in why didn't Paul say I'm going and I'll tell you one thing I'll go in and I'll show them I'm a man of God that's not Apostolic at all you know as I begin to study this really kind of made me wonder how many message Apostolic churches we got oh my notice in Acts chapter 9:28 and he was with them coming in and going out of Jerusalem he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the grecians and they weren't about to slay now Paul was bold now which when the Brethren knew they brought him down to cesaria and sent him for us torous now I wonder how many preachers in our church could follow this Apostolic pattern wonder how many preachers and message churches and we claim or Apostolic well if you can't say Amen say pray for me brother d i 11:22 then Tidings of these things came into the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch well now wait a minute I thought I thought anybody the church would send forth was nothing but organization you haven't read your Bible enough so you see God has a divine order this is the Divine part I'm reading to you tonight and what did Satan do he tuck that and tried to mimic it and make an organization and raise it up in front of some of the message people that's been around it and makes them despise even God's protocol that's right they think they're rebelling against organization when in reality they're rebelling against against the very Bible that they hold in their hand when they stand up and preach and beat the pull pit with sir thank you Jesus y'all see me on the side of the road Friday I will preach for food notice in Acts 13:1 now there were in the church which was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers and now wait a minute I thought the Bible said the the prophets was under John and then after John there was no more prophets uh-huh shows you ain't called to preach notice now so there's certain prophets and teachers Barnabas and Simeon Kiger and Lucius of sirene and manine had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch and Saul as they ministered to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where unto I have called them and when they had fasted and and prayed they laid their hands on them they sent them away wow so the Holy Ghost what was it doing from the church that God ordained out of that church is going to be birthed of Works don't you understand one of the reasons God does this this way is to keep out false prophets amen keep out false Shepherds keep out false evangelists false teachers if it didn't come from recommendation from the church of Jerusalem the people wouldn't hear [Music] [Applause] them oh I can say why a lot of preachers don't want this protocol it would show their wolfy hide well come on brother Donnie hey I I thought you folks believe the Bible I'm sorry anybody got a Donald Duck cartoon book you me to read from that you brother me preach to you about Barbie do you want the word do you do you want the [Applause] Bible oh my acts 14:21 and when they had preached the gospel to that City and had taught many they returned again to lisan Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples exhorting them to continue in the faith that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God and when they had ordained them elders and every church I want somebody to stand right now show me chapter and verse where any church in the New Testament was ever established just to give a preacher more places to preach in that's not the apostolic pattern as a matter of fact a church was born then a preacher was sent to it never the other way that a preacher goes in and people rally around a personality right then it becomes a denomination around one man boy is it me is it is it off of warming here tonight when they had ordained them and their elders and every church so you mean actually from the church have you noticed in all these scriptures that we've read tonight there's not one spot where this man or that man or that woman or this person did it because they felt led if it didn't come from the original church it was not recognized as being from God amen amen amen praise the Lord so you see the ordination then of these ministers was an act not just by the man himself or the denominational board but Apostles prophets spirit-led [Music] men a church wasn't started out of jealousy right that's right it was not started in competition or to bring division to the church at Jerusalem notice Titus 1 verse5 for this cause left I Thee in cre that thou should us set in order the things which are wanting and ordain Elders in every city now wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you mean this man right here is going to go out there and help the church get pastors now remember there's over 100 cities in the island of cre and Paul had started from the north and travel South and evangelized the whole island and before he could get Pastor set in there he had to leave and go somewhere else so he sent Titus back with Apostolic Authority amen amen and he told him now I want you to go back because there's a lot of things lacking there's no pastors here there's no pastors there where again where's these preachers raising up I feel L to go here I feel L to go over there I feel L to go over here Paul said hey before that gets started Titus you go you go among the people now remember he's not acting as a cardinal he's not acting as some bishop or some kind of denomination or something we know the way of God well enough to go enough to know that Titus did not go in there some sort of Archbishop and go to handpicking people he must have got together with the elders and with the church and says there anybody here that feels the call of God you know he would have never left the teaching brother Joel of that Apostle Paul he knew he could trust Titus oh my now this man was not even an apostle yeah I want you to notice I I found this amazing looking at the scripture he said that you might be able to set in order the things that are wanting now that actually comes from a medical term which means the setting of a crooked limb so here was churches on down through them that them cities one after another after another after another but they didn't have no pastors so Paul said there's something likeing wonder why they didn't just write down Paul's books and just distribute books among them and just have somebody stand up and read the books that way they get it straight from Paul's mouth oh Paul said it's a cooked limb it's a crooked limb I'll tell what you need to do Titus you need to go in and set them so Titus going to set that limb so he leave that one place to get a Elder established come on down to the next come on down to the next come on down to the next and wherever God sent a Revival notice what come first it was not the preacher going in to build himself a little kingdom it was the birth of a church under God called men which were not Kingdom Builders except the kingdom of Christ and then after they left then he sent another man in which was not a kingdom Builder and the the people caused the preacher to be called by God praise be to God so then it was not the big Mighty preacher standing glory to God I done this this and I done that and i' done something else and man I transformed this place uhhuh you see where we're going don't you but what was it that man was called on the scene because the bride in them cities Hallelujah and the spirit of God moved on Paul and said Paul set these things in order set him up Mur set an arm and set a leg and set a nose and this and that here come Titus down through there and ordaining the church would vote on it the church would vote on it it was not a dases praise be to God Titus 1 verse 6 these are the type of men that Paul instructed Titus about if any be blameless unreprovable that cannot be called into account unac accused innocent of wrongdoing I don't know that I'll ever forget it as I was called to preach at a convention many years ago many many hundreds of people there the host Pastor introduced me to a a preacher back off the stage before church said Brother D this is brother so and so I said how you doing brother I don't think I've ever met you before no no not been around that much so whenever I preached the Lord laid on my heart to preach about Satan's ambition so while I'm preaching I turn around to this man and I use the example that I used you a while ago about Satan wanted to be you know next to God so I had that man to stand up I said stand up brother I said so be like this brother right here he got tired of being an associate here in this church and say he wants to build his own church or whatever he wants to be a big guy in the message I said thank you brother so he sets back down sometime after that I'm preaching in another city many hundreds of miles away from that one this man is there he comes up to me after the service how you doing brother D you remember me I said yes I do remember you I remember what you preach up par I said really yeah yeah uh but I want to tell you me and some of the Elders of the church there we fixing to split the church I said brother why well we don't like this and we don't like that and you know some of the elders have come to me and they they they want me to Pastor I said I be very careful F you that's a man of God you going to answer to God for that well we we we feel led and we're going to we're going to okay well he tells me this about two weeks before they got a set date they've got this date set they've already got a building Ed so I come home and I pondered over it prayed about it and thought about it I called a little short dark-headed friend of mine I see right off there's no need to mention no names I tell him the scenario I said what what what what would you do well I'll tell you right now what I do I knew he would tell me that's my little buddy I'll tell you one thing if brother Daryl Ward or anybody at your church was going to do that to you I would certainly tell you well I said that's kind of what I was thinking but I I I didn't want to cause no trouble cause trouble well look at the trouble is fixing the C if you don't tell them so I call the brother make small talk how you been doing brother been a while since I talk you oh doing good brother D how you doing doing good how how's your church oh doing good I'll tell you what I said how how's brother so- and so doing oh brother Donnie I'll tell you what he's doing so good he has been such a blessing to me he's been such a blessing to the church and I said brother I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I just saw that man about two weeks ago I gave him the date I said on this date they're fixing to split your church now you know what amazed me about it was not just the man himself but some of the people who were part of this were Elders of that church now how could a man like this with sneaking around his pastor's back like a snake tell me how that man could meet this requirement right here of being blameless which is the very first requirement of a pastor it never ceases to amaze me how ignorant how ignorant that some people are when it comes to God's Bible and yet we pride ourself we know the church ages we know the Seven Seals we know this and that and the other and on some principles of the scripture we're Dumber denominations now do we believe this is the truth or not it ain't no wonder we've got churches in the message that don't even believe in Holiness no more do you understand there's some of the churches in the message that don't even believe in Holiness that do not believe in communion because the Lord has already come some of them don't even believe in the necessity of even going to church they don't even believe that the gospel nobody can be saved after 63 which means most of us are lost right why we got preachers wound up from the pulpit that was not called of God yes sir look at it wasn't enough for Paul to mention it in verse 6 he mentions it again in verse 7 for the bishop must be blameless and as I read this again this story come back to me cuz it's been one that's haunted me for years I never knew exactly why that man ever told me that he didn't know me really close enough to be a confidant but I've told this story around the world and I wondered if that's why the Lord let me know about it and you see it repeated over and over again I've heard of it in Africa I've heard of it in India I've heard it in South America especially in the last 6 months to a year it's like we go through cycles and that's the cycle that the message is in right now you hear preachers going in and causing all kinds of confusion and this and that and the other oh yeah I preached on this not long ago and one of our sisters sitting here come up crying with her husband because that same thing had just happened in their country I heard about it in Africa I've heard about it in Europe I've heard about it here and there and there and yet supposed Elders joining up with such a thing why don't believe the Bible and they sure don't believe the message that's the truth amen come on a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God not self-willed not soon anger now remember Titus would have went this is what Titus went with when he started at the top and went down through the island of creit looking for pastors of the churches it was not if the man could sing like a Mockingbird and he looked like an Elvis Presley and he had curly hair and he had this and that and the other if the man was as crossided as I don't know what and couldn't carry a tune in a lard bucket if the man was faithful not self-willed and the man was without reproach you tell me you tell me how could that man that I just described to you which did all this conniving and this evil ever be blameless and how could them people which had been around the message for decades ever want to be identified with such a man I can tell you why for part of them this one was going to get a position that one was going to get one that one was going to get one that one was going to get one come on now sir and let me tell you the result of that man he later backslid left his wife don't even serve God no more now I wonder where some of them Elders yes sir is going to stand and they stand before God and they're going to be identified on the wrong side of that situation why why we don't check it by this but what do we go by oh this is my friend this is my buddy it's Uncle so and so it's great grandpa so and so I don't care if it's your 13th cousin and your 14th uncle and your second whatever more you ought to judge every man by God's word me included every preacher in this church ought to be judged by the same thing if my life ever gets to a spot that it's not above reproach I hope you know what to do yes sir have a vote amen you don't remember the sermon I preached to several years ago how to get rid of a pastor who's still in the archive you can go back and listen to it but don't ain't you scared nope long as long as I live right I ain't scared at all it makes you wonder Friends when the eagle anointed goes to flying in the resurrection how many in our message churches will show up the Sunday Morning After the Rapture cuz we think it's enough to say I go to a message church I believe God sent a prophet every devil in hell believes the same thing as a matter of fact them devils are more faithful to church than a lot of you all are they don't take vacations they don't find out whether I'm going to be gone or not and it's another Dollywood weekend brother Donnie's out of town they believe it I don't want to just believe it I want to live it brother the GRE I want our church to be a word church look friend I know we've heard it for years many of you have heard it you've heard it and heard it and heard it but I'm telling you every day we're getting closer to the end look at our world look at Israel look at what's going on around us we better make sure amen that we are built up upon the solid rock of God's word I wonder if Paul Peter James John some of them bre would walk into some of our message churches and say you've got to be kidding me this is supposed to be a message Church stand if you can't get up you can just sit there if you're be eat a week you can't we'll excuse you tonight oh my how many loves the word praise the Lord praise the Lord oh my so I wonder when the eagle anointing goes to flying on the earth for the resurrection time the dead in Christ rise our loved ones will go to appearing before us I wonder how many people that have set in message churches profess to be message Believers yet in their hearts they can never really accept that word as their absolute and some of them that accept what they think as their version of the Bible and say well I really don't need a prophet's quotes I really don't have to preach that I just preach the Bible I I don't understand that myself how can we understand this Bible without the inside of a prophet's message this message does not come to give us another version of the Bible it gives us more information about the original Revelation don't you understand all that hit me the other day like a bol light and I nearly had an oldfashioned Holy Ghost spell I told Carol I want you to listen to this I said God never gave brother Bram another Revelation contrary to what Paul's PR contrary to the Bible it was only more information about the same thing to make it more real to us I don't know about you I needed more information but there we needed more information is that wonderful hallelujah praise God brother Manuel it gives us more information it's not contrary to what Paul said it's more information oh hallelujah how many wants to be an Apostolic Bible believing Holy Ghost Phill Christian me too thank you Lord me too heavenly father these words aren't easy to bring I know tomorrow oh my goodness help me tomorrow dear Jesus I pray you'd help each of us when the last sermon is preached the last song has been sung when the call is being made when you Gathering your Jewels May there not be a one of us left behind father dear God we want our church to be built upon your word I wouldn't even know how to estimate how many churches Christian churches socalled that there would be in the tric Cities area hundreds if not thousands more than likely every one of them think they're built on the Bible you're the judge all but those good people go there people don't take the Rapture because they're so-called good people they take the Rapture by the word oh Father we don't want to just be good people we want to to be your people cuz when you was on the earth you said there is none good not one but I hear it so much I get sick of it good people good people good people ain't none of us any good if you don't change us and make us like you What In Me Is any good what in any of these people is any good unless you make us good we're lost father we don't want the pattern laid across our life our life our humanity is the goods and the pattern will stretch across us and if the pattern was a handkerchief and we come out looking like a jacket something bad bad wrong if the pattern was a jacket and we come out looking like a handkerchief and we say well we're a good person I'm a Christian I'm a Believer yet Our Lives don't match the pattern where will we be Lord help us Jesus God I pray every man every woman every boy and every girl those that are streaming tonight those that are sick wanted to be here and couldn't be may you minister to every heart begin with me tonight Lord Jesus and then move to every preacher that's in this place and every preacher that'll hear this may we realize your Prophet told us in 1965 three times in the Bible it was an unpardonable sin to add one word of your own interpretation to a message after it had been Vindicated to be the truth so every preacher who stands behind his pulpit and adds or takes away from the message of the hour will be judged at the day of judgment dear God hide me I pray you would take me off the Earth before I would fall away Lord I've been serving you for 55 years now preaching for many many many years baptized hundreds buried hundreds preached thousands of sermons what good but all of that do to come down to the end and deny this word or that word or another word go to adding a sleeve to a handkerchief adding a cuff adding a collar adding this and that and the other oh God help me help me Jesus I know you don't want us to serve you by ungodly fear but we know that there is a fear that you want your people to have for it is the beginning of knowledge and the beginning of wisdom it's evident many of the message people have lost all fear they'll talk about a servant of God they'll run him down they'll spread lies on him and others will believe it and spread it not realizing they're taking a knife and stabbing him in the back and they are guilty of murder and they will will stand before God as a murderer it's evident a lot of our young people have moved away from Fear they listen to music they shouldn't listen to they watch movies they shouldn't watch they do different things that they shouldn't do and it don't even bother them no more or just waiting till the next Youth Camp to get all fired up but Lord what if you come in between youth camps we want to have a Revival within us that don't tied us over from Youth Camp to Youth Camp or camp meeting to camp meeting but it ties us over through hell it ties us over from one storm to another and if there ain't nobody else in the church having Revival we can have it because us and God are the majority if everybody else sleeps in church we come to church to worship we come to church to receive and that's what we are going to do amen help us Lord we worship you tonight father we bless your Holy Name father as we set aside these next few days to have these special meetings visit us in a special way Lord come dear God use brother Matt to speak not only to
