don't we amen buddy we love you you're this uh isn't going to be easy uh I just kind of I was going to supposed to top out what I was wanting to say but I just didn't have time it's just been so crazy so I just going to kind of start from the beginning and hope everyone understands uh Sunday evening I'd finally got home and was actually sitting in uh my recliner I had a bag of ice on my jaw my jaws have been out of whack so if I talk a little funny that's why that is and and Caroline called me said dad said you did you remember to get the stakes for the scarecrows young people were going to uh put together scarecrows for the Fall Festival Sunday and I said no Caroline I forgot I said I'll I'll take off right now so I went to Lowe's and came back and delivered them and there was some trucks up at the church and they were loading up and so we kind of came up here and uh if I understand it right brother Mark mcel had went trying to get to his um place of work over in Burnsville and apparently couldn't make it and they were on the back roads and came up on some men and they said nobody had been to them no contact or nothing and they needed supplies bad so Mark had arranged that and we sent out four trucks Sunday afternoon probably around 7:30 or 8: at night and to the they drove over to the community of popper it's Mitchell County it's been hit really bad and uh I think it was either that evening or the next next day I said Mark I said you want me to share it on the church Facebook and I did and I think I even posted it just on Facebook itself and uh from there we we have turned into a uh well we're not major we're just doing what we can but a major drop off and supplyment for the communities that nobody is going to we're we're trying to get back into the valleys the mountains where nobody's going to help these communities they can't get out so if nobody gets to them they're hurting really bad and brother Aaron Gil and the and the brothers they've been taking equipment out and uh I don't know if you've been seeing the pictures uh I've been posting they uh went to one community and the bridge was just totally full of trees and everything nobody could get out and they actually went over and and cleared that bridge for that Community it's actually from right here it's 15 ft taller than in our building 60 ft tall there was trees all over the top some of the trees were that big and they said a church went over that bridge so that tells you the devastation that the communities are are seeing and we found out um is either I can't remember you forgive me that it's been hectic either today or yesterday evening the the bridge that the brothers cleared they found uh four bodies under it that the brothers had worked on uh yesterday so it's just and they've been doing a tremendous job just going out where nobody can and that's and it's just been overwhelming we' we've never done nothing like this uh this is we've never had a facility like this to do it so this is the really the first time we've been able to help our community and uh it it's been amazing what social media can do and uh the number of people that have been donating to our Vin Mo and uh I just switched over to the church today but it's just been phenomenal I got a text from a lady today said this is my contribution from California God bless you all $1,000 you know and and uh a lady contacted me from Kentucky she said we see what you're all doing cuz nobody body is really going into the back Parts you know they've got the center set up which is great but you have to go there to get the supplies and we're trying to get back to the people that can't get out to get the supplies It's really hurting and a lot of people have seen that and U I had another lady uh contact me from Christiansburg and she said I want to do a fundraising up here uh for you guys and I said yeah that'd be great so you know we may have to go get the stuff I don't know if somebody could bring it down if they do that but we're starting to get it's starting to get pretty major for our little church and and it's really I I've been I went out Monday and to buy supplies to send out and I got over to Walmart and I said golly I need people to help me shop so I put on the Facebook so these people came in I said you go this you go get that you go get get buggies just fill your buggy full and you know and I emptied out the men's socks and men's underwear you know and everybody's looking at you you know and there was a lady there she said uh are you all helping people and I said yeah I said well this is actually getting ready we're getting ready to take a load to popper she said Mitchell County North she yeah she said that's where I from she said we had to flee we're having to stay over here and she said my kids are sick there's no doctors there's nothing over there and she just couldn't believe it we were getting ready to send a shipment over there and uh we went in the brothers took that first load and I went in the next day a couple of us and took some loads and it it's like a war zone I mean just unless you get out into the mountains and stuff and we were just standing there looking and it it it had to be a tornado way the mountain was just cut off all the trees were just leveled halfway up the top so it's tornadoes that came through a lot of those places and just devastated I mean there just you're trying to get down the road and they already had that road cleared down to the bottom but after that you couldn't get to the community and um it was just tree after tree after tree cut and so you know there's so many more places that they we still can't get into yet so it's a it's turning into a bigger operation and uh brother Ben and him brother Daniel we've got tractor trailer loads of water coming in next week for people so it it's starting to get bigger and bigger and flowing into the weeks and that's where it um kind of hits the Fall Festival and uh it been laying real heavy on my heart cuz I know what a blessing he is everybody but when you see our community and what the people was going through it just they're devastated you know I talked to brother Donnie and he said well you know he said this is the first time we've been able to help our community and uh he said I think that is a whole lot more important in the Fall Festival at this time you [Applause] know so we talked and I I told him that's what had been laying heavy on my heart I just didn't feel right having it when so much suffering is going on and we're in the middle of helping people survive you know and and it's just getting bigger and bigger for us to to help people and I just I just I weighed the balance and it just didn't didn't come out right so I hope you forgive me you know and maybe we can try to have it something later I don't know but uh you know in the Bible uh the little lady that brought gave her money and Jesus told her she'd gave more than all there was a little sister come up to me before church $468 she emptied her piggy bank you know and that's that's what it's that's what it's all about that's what that's what we're here for it's you know we're Christians but we're here to help everyone Christian non-Christian whoever they are if they're a human they deserve help you know and and that's what we're trying to do and U I don't I don't I hope I've understood what I tried to said tonight but uh we're still continuing uh receiving donations and but uh it's a we actually had to slow down today everybody's wore out I mean some of us put in 16 hours Monday and the brother's going out and working all day and getting in at night and um so if you can share you know our post the the donations is what's keeping us going and we had to slow down a little bit today because we we really got in the hole we were like $4,000 in the hole but we came out today and uh some people started fundraising for us and getting some more more money in but it's you know you say well you all received a lot of money but like yesterday we sent out over $115,000 of supplies in one day and so that don't last very long you know we go out I go out shopping and the trucks bring it in it's gone that day and we have to figure out okay what we going to do for the next day so the word is getting out and I think there's more and more churches uh going to start helping us so that that that's what keeps us going you know but we're just trying to do all we can and uh just doing what God's leading us to do so I hope you hope everyone understands and if we can't do anything reschedule it we'll look forward to it next year so God bless everybody I I really appreciate the help everybody's come in I mean like I said I was at Walmart and I got standing there and I said man I need help I came back I was I was planning on the stuff with God to just start separating myself the sisters were here already set up tables and was separating the stuff you know not even contacting anybody so it's it's been a learning curve our first time doing this type of thing and uh but every everything's just really fell into place and and we we've had to learn really quick but I just want to say I really appreciate everybody that has jumped in and helped I mean people's come in it's it's just been amazing there was a couple came in they were with a rafting company an hour east of chattano they couldn't find their home base they were taking supplies or something to us and they seen our signs out front chrisa made and put out and they come in and gave us their donations and they said they may said we're going to contact the other people so that night I left and uh Caroline College said there's some people here from the same rafting company and uh they couldn't find it so they bring in a tremendous amount next day the same company some guy bring in a Trailer Load of supplies so the Lord's blessing us and it's just tremendous to see everything going on and and working and the amount of people uh donating has has been a a phenomenal but uh you know I found out in something like this that's what keeps it going is is the money so but uh God bless you all and we'll just see what happens from here and see if we can do anything if not we'll we'll just try it again next year but I I really think this is just more important for our community what we're going through because people can't even hardly accesses that would be com from North Carolina South Carolina and Georgia so it it was just a uh would be a big hindrance for a lot of people and I know people's got plane tickets in Canada and Arizona so we're just trying to get the word out as quick as we we could so I hate to be you know the bear bad news but I think that over there far outweighs the Fall Festival right now so God bless you all [Applause] well praise the Lord just to kind of bring a little bit of detail into what brother Michael was saying and then uh we'll go right on into the service but as Michael said this all started uh from a simple phone call of a friend in need when brother Mark went over there seen the need to kind of how it it got started um and I just want to bring a few things out here to point out what's been done what's been accomplished we've been the first people on the ground in eight different communities uh we believe that there's been over 100 people whose lives have been saved because of the effort as of yesterday evening um the ground crew went out up towards I believe it was up towards Mountain City let me see this right here large work crew headed down to Jenkin Hollow area and then up into Mountain City here's what they reported we loaded five to six dumps off of Jenkins Hollow we left towards the other side of the mountain City and cleared a block Creek so that the home owners could access their homes easier we also checked on my friend's Papa that lives near there and got him some food and some water on the delivery side it's people taking food taking supplies water medical needs uh toiletries and different things like that uh there's been two trucks of supplies that's went into the new the North Carolina area they were the first ones to ever show up there and they was saying that when the team took the stuff into the in there to newand that the people just started crying they just started crying because nobody nobody had been there to help them at all and so when they saw that truck pull in with water you can imagine if you had no water and you had none of this and all of a sudden somebody showed up it it would really bring tears to your eyes we delivered six trucks to Burnsville North Carolina area took them to the Altech plant for further distribution into the community delivered two trucks of supplies to the little Milligan area were the first ones to show up with supplies for those people delivered three trucks supplies to the trade Tennessee area were the first ones to show up with supplies for those people in this area we able to deliver a generators of the people in some uh of the most remote areas so that they could use starlink use the internet and be able to get out delivered one truck supplies to Mountain City Tennessee area were the first ones that show up with supplies for those people delivered four trucks of supplies to badine North Carolina U delivered four trucks of supplies to Bumpus cold one truck to Chucky area uh donated fuel money to help with a person doing helicopter support who we were in contact with delivered 350 hot meals to the Chucky area so those are some of the things that we have done and you say well you know I've not been able to help so what we would like to do this evening just before we go into the services is to lift an offering that this offering will be used to uh buy gas buy food water whatever would be needed to help these people get back up on their feet and uh some of the brothers that's come back from the area said the pictures that you're seeing don't even do justice it's just from it's just it just breaks your heart I've just sat I was down in Missouri in the meetings and when all this began to happen and was looking at it and I just wept and the brother said are you okay and I said I'm just so burdened for the people up our way but this is one way we can help and if you if you don't have anything to give just prayer prayer is a a great weapon when it's held in the fingers of Faith so if the brothers will come tonight and we'll just lift an offering and this offering will go for the support of buying gasoline Water Propane uh generators gas lean canisters just toiletries just all kinds of needs so let's just bow our heads we'll have a word of prayer right fast Heavenly Father Lord as we come before you this evening we thank you for this opportunity that we can give and Lord we know that yourh told us in in this age that the only hands you have is our hands and the only feet you have is our feet and the only lips is our lips so father God we surrender our hands and all that we have to you Lord that you may use us Lord that this community is in need Lord in the great time of Darkness that they can see the light for lord your Prophet told us it's always in the darkest hour that Jesus showed up Lord I pray that through this effort May the people not see us Lord but may they see you bless this offering Lord may it be used for its intended purpose may it touch many lives we pray for we ask these things in Jesus name Amen brother George sing at thank you for giving

well in this place one more time with all your heart Oh Holy Spirit [Music] this [Music] I I I personally saw something about the people in my church that I've never seen before I saw young men working like dogs just trying to clear roads trying to get supplies to people paying for their own gas their own Vehicles their own time I saw sisters preparing meals um doing Sho and putting everything together just just working so hard I saw brother Daryl Brother Louie um um brother Rocky Ward just so many people from all age groups I mean it was just uh you know it's it's it's good to have uh a faith like we've got but sometimes you got to we this world it needs a Jesus with some skin on it and H and Word of Life we we got to have some skin in the game you know we we we can't be separated from our community this is these are this is our this is our group but at the same time this is our community people that we rub shoulders with people are hurting so bad myself got to to make contact with um a lady when at the bridge that he was mentioning and and knowing that those bodies were under that bridge kills me because more than anything that's what I wanted to do because my own brother drowned I just can't stand the thought of that but even in the darkest of hours he is still God he's the same yesterday today and forever he is still alive his power is just as great as it's ever been uh his Mercy is just as great as it's ever been I know because his Mercy was new to me this morning when I got up his Mercy was dealing with my heart personally in the in the back here about things in my own life he is still God what could he do tonight forget about everything that's going on let's focus on tonight let let let tonight let let it just be a refuge from what we've been dealing with all week tonight could be your night tonight could be your night young person that you get filled with the Holy Ghost it don't have to be Sunday it don't have to be when brother Donnie's here or brother Daryl which I'd much rather him being up here just to be honest with you it don't have to be that way you could be delivered today of something that's been in your life that's just dragging you down and and you feel like it's going to take you under you could be healed today of that thing that's just uh that that nagging thing I've got things I've got a shoulder that doctors say is is uh is permanently disabled I don't want that and I ain't going to settle for that I could be healed tonight tonight could be my night it could be your night tonight amen tonight could be the night that he fills your heart with peace with all that's going on in this world today tonight could be the night that he restores your joy maybe so if you just got a I got a little cold on him tonight could be your night so let's not let this pass tonight Word of Life Church give him everything that you've got right now while you have this opportunity and let's go out let's live our faith let's live our faith Let's help our communities let's love our fellow men I I I tell a little story about Brother Louie um we say we give a rose while while some while they're still here with us I worked at a security post years ago and I got to talking to a guy and he was telling me a story about his testimony he got to ask him where I was where I went to church and I told him where I go to church at and he said well tell me some people that go there he said I don't don't recognize the name I said we got a whole lot of yanes I can tell you that you know I said got a lot of Babs and and I just got telling him some names and I said I said well our song leader you might recognize him everybody knows him I said his name is Louis blevens he said get out of town Lou bevens is your song leader I said yes he's our song Lead said let me tell you about that man he said that man changed my life he was he was my little league baseball coach did you coach Andy's baseball team he was my little league baseball coach and he said the way that man lived and the way that man treated us the life that I saw in him when I went down into drugs as an adult that life that I saw in that man is what pulled me out that was his testimony to me you never know what the what you're doing right now the impact that it could have on somebody else's life amen amen sorry all right Hebrews chapter 11 amen amen let's have church tonight what do you [Applause] say Amen if you see me breathing hard I I was nervous I'm not now I get excited there's a point where you get excited you just have to find that level between excited and control and it can be hard to do sometimes but I want to talk to you tonight about a little thought called just about what is Faith I think it might be appropriate for what we're dealing with right now what is Faith amen Hebrews chap 11 verse 1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen maybe we just let's just all bow our heads Lord Jesus once again your people are assembled together in this place um we've came Lord not to just see each other we came to Worship You Lord we came to hear your voice we came to we need something we want to but we also want to give back to you Lord there's uh um we just love you father well I feel excited right now because I believe you're going to do something in our midst tonight Lord so I just pray you'd help them Lord just to pull upon the gift in my life help me to step aside and just find that right channel Lord just come be with us Jesus we're so excited about what you're going to do with in our in our lives tonight oh God Amen come be with us we love you we so appreciate you it's in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated all right I'm going to try to wind down for a second all right now what is Faith thank you buddy what is Faith now it's that faith is the most talked about subject in all of Christianity um every church every denomination you can go sitting about any service that they that they're having and they're going to be talking about it they're going to be preaching about it it uh faith is the foundation of every Doctrine it's the foundation of every and it's the key to every blessing that we have it's uh the scripture teaches us that by Grace you're saved through faith um healing Deliverance Revelation all these things come by faith even here in our own message the a lot of our themes and our theme songs and and things of that nature are all they're all built around Faith um we think about brother brandom's favorite song only believe um the angel of the Lord really loved that song only believe what is it talking about faith it's speaking about faith um the campaign slogan Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever speaking about a faith in in a God that can do exactly what he did 2,000 years ago it's speaking about that same God of faith in that same God today uh I think about uh even in the message brother Bram I I I I I searched this before it came out 13,16 times that I see that he mentioned Faith 1481 times that he mentioned bride um just just to give you a little perspective faith is so important to us but there's a difference and here's what I want what I want to get into there's a difference in having faith and having a faith you understand what I'm saying there's a difference in having faith and having a faith we've all heard the expression my faith my faith won't allow me to eat a certain food my faith won't allow me to wear certain clothes my faith won't allow me to do this my faith dictates that I have to do this thing and it's spoken of almost it's almost like it's almost like a rule book a code of rules rules to live by uh like a belief system is that is is that friend is that what faith is is Faith just a bunch of dos and don'ts that we abide by uh the these things that we the these things that we follow is it just a belief system which is just a a belief system is just a set of principles that guide life there's over 4,200 religions in the world that I that that when when I Google that's what it told me anyway over 4200 religions all belief systems all of them have a code of conduct a a standard that that that the people have to live by thousands of them and thousands of them philosophies you have people that believe in believe in that the universe is God and people the the the the I think it's the Hindu or the Buddhist belief of uh of karma what comes around goes around type of stuff we have all kinds of belief systems in in in in in in our world in America we got a different type of religion called politics you know you're either maggot or you're liberal am I right you and and people talk about this stuff like they're talking about it's coming from the Bible For Heaven's Sake you know I've got my own political opinions but I ain't crazy enough to think that that that you know I think about I don't want to say anything too much but I think about how we're talking about making America great again I can't understand how any message folk could get it in your head that we're going to make this country great again the word of God has already been spoken we I love my country I expressed that the last time I talked to you I'm very patriotic I express that the last time I talked to you but we are not going to make this country great in the is that what our faith is is that all just a code is it a code to live by a code of ethics I promise I'm just building a little background and then we're going to go is it just a moral code of ethics that we uh or guidelines that we follow you know like the Rich Young Ruler John mentioned on Sunday he had a code of ethics called The Ten Commandments that we all believe we all believe that's true but this young man had this code that he lived by and this this young man came running to Jesus he came running he wasn't walking laad desically this young man was very sincere he came running to Jesus he knelt before Jesus showing great respect for the for him called him good Master letting you know he understood who this was only one is good and that is God and here he's telling him good Master what may I do that I may inherit eternal life that was that young man's problem right there he's he's a rich young man he thought it was something that could be passed down to him he wanted a religion he wanted a Faith with no death to self Jesus said scripture says Jesus looked at him and loved him love that boy that's a good young man he kept the word Jesus he he says what can I do that I inherit and Jesus says you know the Commandments keep them you know the what the word says keep the Commandments he says I've done them all my life from my youth he said I've kept the word of God and Jesus didn't correct him the word corrects the error Jesus didn't correct that boy that was some young man standing before Jesus Christ right there but all he had was a code of conduct he had a religion he had a faith but he did not have faith in the word of God he did not have faith Faith otherwise this young man would have yielded his life right there in the presence of God Jesus said you're lacking one thing and that young man when Jesus told him went away sad because he didn't want a faith that involved death to self and I think about our young men you know I love you guys I really do I get around y get around y'all working this week my goodness I get around you and I feel like I'm a young man again and then I wake up the next day and I realize that I'm not I did I was chucking logs the other day I'm cutting branches and I was having a time brother brother josi we we did we were I just felt like a young man again I love I love my young Brothers but let me say something to you to follow Jesus Christ you're there's going to have to be a death to self and he's going to ask you many times for that thing that is the hardest for you to give up you know like this young man was his wealth and I think about so many times our young men I I think about how I just just what I say we're Sports church here at Happy Valley is what I've heard people say uh Sports can be something football let me say that football there's not not nothing wrong with a game but many times if that thing is consuming you if that's the thing that consumes you we can enjoy things I enjoy things I like Hunting Fishing exercising Woodwork and all kinds of things but if that thing is what you are that thing defines you that is what you speak about every time you get around people if that is consuming you maybe Jesus is Calling to you you might need to lay that thing aside you know you young sisters your beauty sometimes can be the thing that just pulls you it'll make you cross the lines that you know you I don't know why we're going this way make you cross them lines because it's just it's that thing that you've got that thing that's special it's that thing that gets you attention and then you see yourself just getting pulled right across that line in in across the line of the word we don't have a faith we have the faith you know in in our country now there's another code another another religion called the wokeness code that has kind of kind of took over it's a little they call it a higher moral code of living they nothing but a of Pharisees it's all based on emotion it's all based on their feelings and saying if you disagree with me you hate me you uh um if you don't if you don't agree with everything that I say you're a bigot it's it's a it's there nothing but a bunch of a bunch of Pharisees and that same thing has crept around it can't it's crept around in in in our doors to the point people we saw people start getting enlightened of a higher way you know uh people walking away people getting away is brother l i just some of the stuff he says that's going on with ministers I just blows my mind I'm glad I don't hear this stuff it's good to be a nobody sometimes um the the ministers the things that they say about quoting the prophet and getting away from these things and talking about the Liberty in it well let me ask you this you those people who walked away from this where has your Enlightenment taken you today where is the victory in your life today where are your children today what kind of condition are they in how is your marriage doing now that you left the word and found another Faith they just a church Creed is just it all is a church Creed is something that dictates church membership this is what I got to do to be a part of the group and the message is no different we're no different we we got the the the God sent a prophet and that makes me okay that I got to have the Holy Ghost to see the message to believe the message um in Word of Life it comes down to us too just because you believe brother Donnie's a man of God and you love to sit and listen to him preach that that don't give you the Holy Ghost nothing replaces the Holy Ghost you must be filled with the Holy Ghost you will not go in the Rapture without the Holy Ghost brother B himself said don't just believe say I believe the message he said you obey the message come into Christ die to yourself be filled with the Holy Ghost let this life live through you this an odd this is an odd topic for a day like today the faith not a faith is spoken of in scripture Malachi 4 itself says be behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet and he's going to turn your hearts back to the faith of the fathers amen we see Paul teaching the the new Believers and the church is being established in the faith um there's and Paul and Barnabas exhorting the Believers to continue in the faith Jude telling us to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints I now I ask you is the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is it just doctrines is it just things that we believe like water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I believe that's right don't you is it just believing in the there is a baptism of the Holy Ghost which we do believe in is it believing is it just in believing that that we we believe in preaching the gospel in a five-fold Ministry in the power of God in Holiness on the inside and the outside is it just in in believing the revelations of the church ages our young people can teach they could probably teach you the church ages better than I could I can't remember nothing I can't remember what I had for breakfast this morning and that's not a joke um they could teach the Seven Seals the godhead we understand the godhead we understand election predestination we understand that we are Sons and Daughters of God with genes that literally came from God not something separate not a a separate something that that he created and put in us but literally genes of God with a deposit from God himself living living with within us as as the elect is just believing that is that the faith that we're talking about is it believing the Mysteries serpent seed was one of the first ones I mean when I started to when I started seeing serpent seed my goodness that one blew my mind I mean um when you start seeing it just popping out of the out of the scripture you know and you just Trace that Antichrist spirit all the way down through the through time and we can see it today we see it in our own ranks and um all these things yes they do make up the faith but is that what God requires is that the faith that God requires for us to make it into Rapture is that the faith that God requires for us to have victory in our lives to have victory in our homes to overcome sin to overcome self is that the faith that's going to see us through I believe these things are true I these things alone are just knowledge and education to his friends and education ain't the same as experience you know we hear the saying knowledge is power all the time and I and I'm not saying it's a bad thing I appreciate the knowledge you know but we've become better educated Believers um than we've ever been naturally and spiritually um we're better dressed people than when when I first came in you know we we we look better in society now we're more well spoken we got more things than we've ever got had before we got more money we got more possessions we s we and we we say so many times we're blessed I'm not goodness I'm am not trying to scold you I Don't Preach like this good night we say we're blessed but why is it we when we say we're blessed we're only talking about the things that we we've been given the money the possessions the things that we get to do why are we not saying why am blessed because the grace of God has changed my life I've been filled with the Holy Ghost the word of God has been revealed to me the purpose of the of the Gospel is not to make us a better class of people the purpose of the Gospel is to change your life the purpose of the Gospel is to set you free to give each and every one of us overcoming power to open your eyes to see who you are as Sons and Daughters of God Amen second Timothy chapter 3 warned us you know there would be people that ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth in the last days now there's two kinds of knowledge there's knowledge of me I can tell you something and now you know it and then there's an intimate type of knowledge like as the scripture says and Adam knew his wife Eve and she conceived there's an intimate knowledge a relationship that produces a life there's two different we're talking about two different types of knowledge there are two different types of Truth there is there are truths and there is the truth Jesus said I am the way I am the truth and I am the life the truth is not doctrines it is not these things these Mysteries the all these things that we understand and believe the truth is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ Living in you and living in me knowledge of the truth not truths my goodness I Don't Preach like this friends don't think I'm balling you out my goodness gracious Hebrews 11 again faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen now substance is something that is possessed I've got it it's mine the evidence of Things Not Seen evidence is proof it's something that I got faith is something that I've got it's something that every one of you got that proves his word to be true it we literally possess it and it gives us the the ability it gives us the power to make the word of God live in our lives faith is a lived it is a LIF lived yes sir brother Brenham said your faith is what God sees in you your works is what other people see in you your works is what tells people that that that's what told I almost said his name that what told that man that Louis belev are something special about that man he saw he saw brother Lou's life and it touched him faith is a lived life and it has an impact when we live this gospel when we live this word it has an impact amen just the other day we were when we were out helping these folks and we got across that bridge had a man tell me he said I'm going to visit y'all's church and he kept coming back he said you think I'm joking I'm going to come visit your church he said our neighbors got the same equipment y'all got and it's sitting in their Barn right now he said you don't even know who we are you never met us until today and he said you're donating your time you're bringing us gas you're you're you're working like dogs these men are uh brother Aaron and brother brother uh Charles donating their equipment they're me their Manpower paying these men to get out here and work he said that that impacted that man your faith lived your faith live has an impact faith is a sixth sense it's a six sense brother Brandon says faith sees what blind people don't see now we've got five senses five senses to contact this Earthly our Earthly home that we can make contact with each other we can know each other through these five senses C taste pH smell and here now sorry brotheri what is that it's a what' you say it's a pen how do you know that's a pen I can see it you can see it are you straining are you sure yes sir you just you're just looking it's a pen his his his sense of sight tells him that this is an ink pen he's not trying to force himself to see that it's just right there in front of his face he's not forcing himself and trying to press himself into seeing that that's an ink pin take that for me what does it feel like it's a pen right it what it feels like a pen his sense of touch is telling him that is an ink pen just pop the pop it pop it a couple times you hear that what does it sound like it sounds like a pin donut see his five senses are telling him they're telling him what this is am I making sense now now we have a sick sense that we don't we don't have to press our way you press and you miss it just relax yourself just relax yourself and believe it don't don't try to press yourself Young people into receiving the the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll miss it cuz you'll work yourself up into a nervous breakdown just receive just relax yourself believe the promise believe that promise and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's just that simple yes sir that's why we miss it that is that is unbelievable simple a child understands that yes now our five senses they contradict our sense of faith our five senses our five senses tell us the complete opposite of many times of what our faith is trying to tell us My Five Senses tell me all the time oh boy no you ain't healed no you ain't healed my shoulder go it'll go Stone Cold numb on me it throbs it pounds I times I can't lift it my senses tell me that my there's no way there's no way there's no way that you're healed Pete I've got a the quad on my right leg is gone um from the nerve damage in my back now the doctors say I'll never be the same I disagree I disagree with that they say that's never going to come back I disagree with that statement see my senses they disagree with what my faith tells me my faith tells me that he's a man of his word he's an honorable man he will do what he said that he would do he said that he paid my price with his stripes he said Pete you're already healed my faith has got a hold of that and I will not let go of that many of you have lost loved ones that it looks like they have gone too far to reach don't you let go of the promise of God your children that are out in the world or your children that just just gone Haywire my word tells me that my children are a Heritage of God my inheritance from almighty God I will not accept that they're that they're going to go away I will not accept that I'm going to lose my children don't you let go when I when I preached here last time several people came up and praying for their children I remember every one of you and I'm holding on to that with that promise with every one of you don't you let go you hold on to that word deny how you feel your feelings will lie to [Applause] you it don't feel like you're going to get the Holy Ghost sometimes young people that ain't got nothing to do with it he said it is the promise to as many as the Lord Our God shall call as many as the Lord Our God shall call you hold to that word you don't let go of that word thank you amen Faith causes action the scripture says that by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice now Abel saw it he got the revelation of it but that wasn't enough he saw that it was right he understood that it was right but Abel had something to do abrel had to go slay that lamb and then let blood splatter and everywhere and offer that sacrifice Faith requires action sometimes we need to just shut up or talking and start walking take back your land amen I had two two friends back in school I remember one time we were playing ball these two Knuckleheads got to talk and junk to each other and uh start you know making their threats they thing I know one of them say draws a line you step across that line I going to wear you out by the time they were all done there were dozens of lines up and down that road I finally had enough I I had enough I said if one of y'all don't throw a punch I'm going to whip the both of you talking all of that junk sometimes when he need to quit talking junk and throw some punches at the Devil and say it is RI that is the exact same thing that Jesus Christ himself did when he defeated the devil he said it is written and he stood on the word of God and he would not back up amen it don't take nothing it don't take no special kind of faith it ain't got to it don't take no Mountain Moving type of Faith all you got to do is just have a little bit of it brother brandom said it is a common thing a common thing that we all possess in Exodus 12 they were commanded to take hisp and and excuse me and apply the blood to the lentil in the post of their door his up is nothing but a common weed it's common Faith just a common everyday Faith the same faith that you young men use to button up your shirt that you use to tie your tie to get in the car and drive to church to put your clothes on that is the same faith that you use to apply the word of God to your life to apply the blood to your home just apply the word how do I apply it brother Pete brother brandham said say you hear the word you hear it you believe it and then you apply it it's real deep ain't it it's so simple just takes a simple Faith yes sir Lord y'all wearing me out I appreciate it I appreciate it I think we all need it tonight we all need it in the token message brother Brenham said he said Hipp hiip was just common weeds hiip means your faith somebody tries to have Supernatural Faith he said that's the reason you miss your healing you're trying you're trying so hard he said faith is just a common thing you got faith to come to church think about that that took Faith you got faith to come to church you got faith to walk out there he said you got faith to start your car all of them things requires or or requires Faith he said your faith to eat dinner he said that's the way it is just common Faith every one of you tonight have a Measure of Faith every one of you have enough faith if you'll just reach out and grab a hold of the promise that you have need of tonight I can't I mention healing because that I'm I'm going to fight on the battlefield that I've been placed on if the devil want wants to hit me there that is where I am going to fight I've got three special specialist telling me that I'm disabled and I ain't ever going to work again that's exactly why I got on that bridge with them young men I ain't accepting that brother Jackie that's why I didn't tell you about my shoulder when you asked me to move that couch if I believe I'm Healed then I'm going to act like I'm Healed and I'm going to walk like I'm Healed I'm going to do what I would do if I was healed I refuse to accept that I'm a disabled man you should refuse to accept any lie that the devil is trying trying to shove down your throat you know what the word of God says hold on to that amen faith is based on one thing that's the Eternal Word of God it ain't based on on your emotion my emotion can lie to me it lies to me every single day of my life you know what I'm talking about my feelings lie to me every single day of my life it ain't based on how you feel it ain't based on what you think or your opinions it ain't based on what no particular brother says about something it's based on one thing the word of God only Faith anchors in the word of God faith is persistent yes sir brother brand I'm talking about that little sire Phoenician woman I love this story it's one of my all-time favorites brother B says faith won't turn loose said faith is persistent he said it holds right on he said she come to get something she was determined to stay there till she got it now notice when she got to Jesus instead of getting a welcome she got a turn down she came to him and run up to him to worship him and said she's showing nothing but respect she's showing sincerity worshiped him said thou son of David have mercy on me my daughter is is very is grievously vexed with the Devil and and I've known that you're a great healer and I and I come to to you to ask you to help me he just ignored her now why would he do something like that after she showed nothing but respect why would he do something like that see he knows what is e in each and every one of us tonight he knows the faith that each and every one of us know or have tonight problem is we don't know and you don't know until you're in the situation I'll guarantee you Daryl Ward never realize the faith that laid in him and until his little girl was laying in that hospital room you see what I'm talking about that great faith that every one of us thank God for every one of us have benefited from would it he found out what he had in the worst time of his life God knew what what he what what was in there and he was bringing it out for the benefit of the Bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ easy life don't bring that out he said now she went after him again said Lord I can can I just have said here she was thinking about what she had come through where she wasn't thinking about what she came through she wasn't thinking about what she would have to go through the only thing she knowed she believed that if she could get him to say so that's it if I can get him to say so that's all she needed to know if he would just say so she know it was working on others so why wouldn't it work on her you fight every inch of the way Faith told her that that man is able to do it and she was willing to fight him if she had to to get it he ignored her Time After Time and Time After Time she came back saying but Lord coming back lord hear me out I've got a daughter just listen to me will you hear me out Lord and he turned her down but her faith knew that's him Jesus is in the room tonight she saw it she recognized his presence her faith told her so hey amen she got right up to the very God himself and he ignored her and she run after him crying she was persistent Lord help me she said she worshiped him said help me listen at that rebuke I ain't ain't even sent to your race he said my gosh on he said a lot of them would like would have got up and said well I guess he wasn't sent to us see Jesus he said Jesus knowed that she had that kind of Faith he knew what lay inside of that little woman he knew how far he needed to push her to put that pressure on to make that seed just burst forth and come to life amen easy life ain't going to produce this type of faith brother sister you're going to have to take some be willing to take some punches stand back up and throw some punches back amen if I was in a wheelchair tonight brother sister I'm just going to be honest with you I'm at the point in my life my wife and my kids are going to have to pick me up every single day of my life cuz I'm going to get up out of that wheelchair and if I fall a thousand times I'll get up a thousand and one I'm going to stand up until I walk and you've got to have that same persistence brother sister you can't accept what you feel if you accepted the cancer that you maybe that you have it's just it is what it is you're going to die most likely but if you can grab hold of his word and hold on to his word when you're down on your on your knees puking in the toilet because the chemos made you so sick after you after you're done puking tell him tell the Devil by his stripes I am healed you won't stop me I will not listen to How I Feel amen Sho lordy time stand still amen said he wouldn't pay no attention to her he ignored her and finally she got his way and he couldn't get around her be on his hands brother sister if he says no if you pray and you feel like you're praying up against a stone wall and your prayers don't even hit the ceiling you keep coming back I will drive him nuts if it's possible I will I will drive him nuts if it's possible cuz I'm going to ask every single day of my life I want to be healed I want to be well and I won't stop confessing it I won't stop asking it until it's mine you've got to do the same thing he said I'm not sent to you in your race your R Ain race ain't nothing but a bunch of dogs good Lord I'm not going to take the children's bread it's not right for me to take the children's bread healing and give it to your group to give it to to you a bunch of dogs and he said Lord that's the truth he said faith will always admit the truth thank you faith will always admit the truth yes she said truth Lord we are nothing but a bunch of dogs but I'm only asking that I could get just some crumbs that fall from the master's table I love the way he says this she was crumb hunting she was crumb hunting she came for something she was willing to Humble herself down when he ridiculed her when he turned her away when he ignored her she was willing to take the testing of her faith why why she knew he's the one she knew he's the one she refused to take no for an answer and she got what she came for tonight young people you can be filled with the Holy Ghost my young brothers that are struggling it's a it's a struggle in this age more than ever before your the battle that you fight with your eyes the battle that you fight with lust the word of God says that you are more than a conqueror you are more than able to take it don't you listen to that devil tell you that you can't beat that thing you can beat it put some action behind it if your telephone is the thing that he keeps using to knock you flat on your face then put that thing down sometimes your faith requires some action that ain't real popular most of the time but it's the truth brothers and sisters amen I know because I I get around them I talk to them I want to see my brothers be free if you're going to be free you have got to [Applause] fight amen faith is a stand taken on his word not just words but a stand Faith draws a Line in the Sand and it don't stand back and draw another Line in the Sand it draws a Line in the Sand and says I won't back up throw your punch and I'll throw mine I'm not afraid to say listen I've been hit by the devil plenty of times you know many of y'all brother Daryl think about how you fight fight your back a man what you think about this a man who has been used to bring healing to thousands of God's people and he fight something like that why because that's the battlefield he's been placed on that's the battlefield he's been placed on Amen we got to draw a line in the sand and say I'm not going to back up I may go down but I'll stand back up he might hit me again and I might go down but I'll stand back up the scripture says that a righteous man falls seven times and gets back up I'm going to I'm going to multiply that a little bit a righteous man falls however many times you got to pick yourself back up you pick yourself back up and you fight don't [Music] [Applause] quit amen it's a stand you've got to take a stand on his word if you want to get somewhere by faith the scripture says that Noah prepared an ark and for 120 years he was willing to go through the ridicule and the mocking and the jokes why his faith told him his word is the truth so he went to work he went to work he didn't just preach the word he didn't just tell him it's going to rain but he built a boat and because that man had some action behind his faith it saved it saved Humanity from extinction because everything would have been wiped out by faith Abraham was willing to separate from his family in his Kindred and leave them all behind to go live in a place like Johnson City to to follow a gospel chasing this promise and after 25 years for 25 years that man confessed for 25 years he held on and when he finally got it and that young boy becomes a he's starting to become a young man the Lord says now I want you to take him and offer him to me Abraham as a sacrifice and abraam did it because he knew this one thing think about the horror that man felt what if he don't stop me what I'm what I'm about to do what if he don't stop me but he was willing to go through with it because he believed he knew my son is my he is my air that is my seed if I do have to take his life God will raise him back up again and because of that we C he's referred to as the friend of God because of that he is referred to as the father of the faithful because Abraham was willing to take a stand on the word of God Amen scripture says by faith so many others stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword wax Valiant and fight and women receive their dead to life again but others it says were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain aain a better Resurrection others had cruel mockings and scourgings bonds imprisonment stoned sown aund slain with the sword went through terrible things but they refused they refused they didn't know if he was going to save them or not they knew that he could they knew that he could but whether he does or not I ain't backing up on this word of God I will not deny Jesus Christ Jesus Christ The Living Word by faith says others wandered around destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy bring it on down to Home by faith Erica Parker brother Lance told me said there was no other alternative to her but I by his stops I'm Healed I am healed and she won she wouldn't she have refused to accept anything other than that there was no backup plan our sister she held on in in in the face of just such great oppositions there such a terrible fight she held on we all got to witness that life by faith Eugene Kennedy our brother that we all saw as a as a big muscular athletic looking man and we saw him wither away down uh down to probably from 200 lb to what 80 90 lb we watched him wither away but then when we'd have a prayer line we would see our brother could have him being carried in on a stretcher why why he knew his God was able he knew he was he refused to back up on that promise he refused to say the negative you can't tell me he didn't get down you don't get down when you can't walk you can't eat you got to be fed through a tube but our brother held on that is the faith of the fathers The Living Word living inside of his people my goodness I don't even know where I'm at that type of Faith can't be scared out it can't can't be beat out it can't be cut out burned out it'll hold to the promise even in death we got to witness it first uh very personally brother sister we know we know this Faith holds those of you who are desperate tonight you're desperate for a move of God in your life remember that story about them two farmers them two farmers they both they were going through a terrible drought it hadn't rained on their land everything's dried up their Farmers it's how they make their living both them men prayed for rain they both asked God God send the rain that I need in my life one of them went out he tilled his field he planted the seed and when it came time for for the rain to fall that he was ready to receive the promise my brother my sister those of you who've got a loved one you've got a child that's out in the world make their bed for them their old bedroom paint their bedroom their favorite color get ready to receive them back plow your field up and get ready my brother sister if you need a job today update your resume print it out put in your application get your work boots by the door get your tools by the door waiting expecting the promise

this to some brothers the other night I can't remember who it was if I were to audibly hear the voice of God tell me or what I want to believe to be the voice of God to tell me Pete I am not your healer healing is not for you I ain't going to believe it see because I can I I can be deceived as a man by Voices I can be deceived by revelations I can be deceived by how I feel about things right Revelations sometimes can fail voices can deceive your feelings are going to lie to you the word of God the word of God will never fail you you got to understand who you are is Sons and Daughters of God Leah you are a daughter of God you are a daughter of God is who you are you know sometimes DNA matters okay DNA matters on the natural side I out the first of my people and this explains a whole lot to me his name was William Lawson they call him William Lawson refer to him as William Lawson the Scottish Rebel this is a is a 15-year-old boy he fought in a revolution against against England at the Battle of cin was taking captive spent a year in prison came aboard my first my people were slaves that came to America he was a slave William didn't take that laying down you know when they went to get off the the boat they they were making them sign this contract if you work diligently and obey your master in all things in seven years you can go free like aund and some men was on that boat only one of them was a teenager he's 16 years old his name was William Lawson to a man every one of them refused they said almighty God did not make us sign any such contract when we were born we will not sign it for you so they made them they they they forced them into slavery William was was taken to a home I can't remember where it was that I think in the Carolinas is that right Micah is it in Virginia he's taken to a place in Virginia his master they were real hard on him um William he was a rebel he uh his master had told him cuz William would he didn't take being a slave too well so he bucked his master all the time refused to eat his master wanted to keep him strong refus to eat so one day William was sitting in the floor he wasn't allowed to eat around everybody else he was sitting in the floor and he uh a dog the Master's dog a very loved dog of the master came walking by and his tail flopped on his table William took a knife and whacked his tail off his master came in him he was livid he was angry said why would you do something like why did you do that he said you told me to eat was whatever's on my plate your dog's tail was on my plate I thought I'm not reading this I'm thinking that explains a whole lot to me DNA matters brother sister but we we all have a natural a a a natural DNA and he's messed up you may not be as messed up as us Lawson but you all are messed up y'all's flesh is messed up but we've got another another another Jean line as I said earlier we have a deposit that came literally came from almighty God a part of God it's in my loss and DNA to be stubborn and rebellious and to be bullheaded but it is in my other DNA to be an overcomer it is in your other DNA to be an overcomer Victory runs in my family tree the baptism of the Holy Ghost run runs in my family tree the Rapture runs in my family [Applause] [Music] tree stop focusing on this guy and start looking at this guy pay attention to this guy more feed this guy more and
