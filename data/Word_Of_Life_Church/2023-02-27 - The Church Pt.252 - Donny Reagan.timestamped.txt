[23:13] medical experience and her doctor's
[23:16] hands get this out
[23:19] little boy said well why don't you see

[23:35] hear this patient screaming with joy and
[23:38] rejoicing and the doctor comes out

[50:51] together to get today and once again
[50:54] see what the Lord will say to us and do
[50:58] for us
[50:59] in this hour of terrible spiritual
[51:01] Darkness that's on the earth we're
[51:04] grateful that we're still able to walk
[51:06] in light are we not
[51:08] let's turn to the book of Hebrews if you
[51:10] would today chapter 3.
[51:14] 3 Hebrews chapter 3.
[51:18] wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[51:21] Heavenly calling
[51:23] consider the apostle
[51:26] and high priest of our profession
[51:29] Christ Jesus
[51:31] the Apostle and high priest of our
[51:35] profession
[51:37] look at the meaning of this word
[51:39] profession
[51:40] it means confession subjectively it
[51:43] means whom we profess to be ours
[51:47] what one professes or confesses
[51:52] so he is the Apostle and the high priest
[51:55] of our profession so the word simply
[51:58] means to say the same thing now just
[52:02] give you a little bit of a background
[52:03] where Paul was coming from when he wrote
[52:05] this that there was in the days of the
[52:08] high priest and there was the regular
[52:11] priesthood which was of the levitical
[52:13] order but the high priest alone could go
[52:15] in on the day of atonement to make
[52:18] atonement for the people of God
[52:21] so he went in one time a year you would
[52:23] go in and out in and out in and out
[52:25] seven times on that particular day
[52:27] before he would go in the Elders of the
[52:31] Sanhedrin which was the overseeing body
[52:34] of the Jews they would come to him
[52:38] and they would tell him great
[52:41] apostle
[52:43] and messenger of God
[52:46] you are going into God's presence to
[52:49] represent us
[52:50] so they would Place their faith and
[52:53] confidence in this man that he had lived
[52:55] the right kind of life and that he would
[52:57] be able to represent them before God so
[53:00] Paul has taken from this now he tells us
[53:03] we have an apostle and a messenger In
[53:07] God's Presence so as they confessed and
[53:11] profess that he represented them so we
[53:14] confess our lord Jesus represents us
[53:18] and verse 2
[53:20] who was faithful to him that appointed
[53:24] him as also Moses was faithful in all
[53:29] his house I made love to be remembered
[53:31] today as we pray have a need a request
[53:34] desire in your heart
[53:36] Lord Jesus we profess first of all today
[53:40] that you are our high priest
[53:44] we do not come to a man we do not come
[53:47] to a system or a church but we come to
[53:51] you today
[53:52] we believe that you represent us in
[53:56] heaven
[53:57] therefore we bring our needs our desires
[54:00] our requests before your presence right
[54:03] now
[54:04] we're asking great Apostle great high
[54:07] priest of God
[54:09] that you would mediate for us today
[54:12] not only just as we pray
[54:15] but as we Endeavor to break your word
[54:17] and open it up
[54:19] may you mediate on our behalf
[54:22] open to us the scriptures open to us
[54:25] your word
[54:27] for we know out of the word comes the
[54:29] abundance of power to help us to live
[54:32] the right kind of life
[54:33] we can quote the word 24 7. but if the
[54:37] power in the word is never released to
[54:39] us it doesn't do us a lot of good
[54:42] so help us today mediate on our behalf
[54:46] speak to us father as only you can do we
[54:49] commit the hearers of the word the
[54:51] speaker all of it into your great charge
[54:54] today in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[54:57] ask it
[54:58] and the Saints said amen amen God bless
[55:01] you you may be seated
[55:07] I know that you already are aware of it
[55:12] but until he came
[55:15] there was never
[55:17] a priest like the Lord Jesus
[55:20] it was forbidden by God's law
[55:23] for any of the Kings of Israel
[55:27] to ever cross the line of being priests
[55:31] and King in the same position
[55:35] we know that Uzziah got in great trouble
[55:38] with God because he tried to do such
[55:41] there were several different ones down
[55:43] through the Jewish history that did so
[55:46] they tried to mix both King and
[55:49] priesthood now to you may look and think
[55:50] what was such a big deal the big deal
[55:53] was God was going to be the first one
[55:56] and the only one that would be able to
[55:58] do this so whenever we are able to look
[56:02] at our lord Jesus today and know that he
[56:05] is not only our King but he is our
[56:08] mediator he is the one that intercedes
[56:12] for us whenever we are sick Afflicted
[56:15] weary whatever it is that we have need
[56:18] of he's the one that can do it it is the
[56:21] merging together of the Divine slash
[56:25] human high priest there was never such
[56:28] on the earth before a high priest all of
[56:31] them of course were human but he was the
[56:34] first one to be divine and human at the
[56:39] same time in order to bridge the gap so
[56:42] that once he ascended back into the
[56:44] presence of God even though he was
[56:47] glorified and deity had embodied him
[56:50] again he would never get away from the
[56:54] human memory of experiencing what
[56:57] humanity is really like I'm so grateful
[57:00] for that today I know you are too turn
[57:02] with me to Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14.
[57:06] seeing then that we have a great high
[57:09] priest that is passed into the heavens
[57:12] now unlike abiathar unlike Aaron unlike
[57:17] any of the other priests that ever
[57:19] existed through the Jewish line none of
[57:22] them could ever Ascend into heaven now
[57:25] there was a foreshadowing of this of
[57:27] course in the Old Testament and when
[57:29] Abraham met the great Melchizedek who
[57:32] was the king of Salem which was
[57:34] Jerusalem and it was we know God in the
[57:38] form of a theophany that appeared
[57:40] theophany in form of a man and it was
[57:44] something that was a mystery and it had
[57:46] been for thousands of years until the
[57:49] end time when it was revealed but here
[57:51] Paul is emphatica now remember the title
[57:54] of this book is the Hebrews so it was to
[57:58] Hebrew people that had become converted
[58:00] by the new birth you imagine what a
[58:03] struggle that some of them must have had
[58:05] that accepting a man like Jesus now for
[58:09] you and I we look back through through
[58:12] 2000 years and we know who he was but
[58:14] can you imagine being there a Jew in
[58:16] that day a Hebrew in that day and or you
[58:19] heard about where this guy was born you
[58:22] actually went around by the cave where
[58:24] his mother gave birth to him you went by
[58:27] the house where he was raised you went
[58:30] by the place in Capernaum where he had
[58:32] preached in the synagogue by this time
[58:34] it had not yet been destroyed you went
[58:36] by Peter's house which is just a stone's
[58:39] throw from where the synagogue was
[58:41] compared him we stood there a few years
[58:43] ago and they found it just a few years
[58:45] back and they dug around and actually
[58:47] found Peter's house where Jesus went in
[58:49] there in Peter's house and laid his
[58:51] hands on his mother-in-law and she was
[58:53] healed and you saw the boats that it
[58:56] actually stood on to fish in and then in
[58:59] your mind you've got to accept the fact
[59:01] that this was actually God in a human
[59:05] form it must have been a very difficult
[59:08] thing unless of course you had the Holy
[59:10] Ghost
[59:11] so this letter whenever you see the
[59:14] setting of it that was actually written
[59:15] to Hebrews people that had been their
[59:18] whole life under the influence of Moses
[59:20] their whole life under the influence of
[59:23] the prophets and the Torah and now
[59:25] they're trying to accept that some man
[59:27] that had walked among them was that
[59:30] Mighty God of the Old Testament so Paul
[59:33] wanted to make sure that by the spirit
[59:35] of God he covered every aspect that God
[59:38] would give him so now he goes again into
[59:40] the order of the high priest and he said
[59:42] seeing that we have a great high priest
[59:45] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[59:49] the son of God notice he doesn't refer
[59:51] to him as Jesus the son of Joseph
[59:53] because he wasn't Jesus the son of God
[59:56] let us hold fast our profession now here
[1:00:02] we have a high priest that has passed
[1:00:04] into the presence of God and because we
[1:00:07] have that now let us hold fast hold fast
[1:00:11] best our profession or confession to who
[1:00:15] the Lord Jesus notice now let us hold
[1:00:19] fast our profession so verse 14 does not
[1:00:22] say let us hold fast our holy ghost or
[1:00:26] let us hold fast our Salvation or let us
[1:00:30] hold fast our favorite Church seat or
[1:00:33] our favorite church pew but let us hold
[1:00:36] fast our profession why would we need to
[1:00:40] hear these words because there's going
[1:00:42] to be many things that's going to try to
[1:00:45] take our profession away from us
[1:00:49] now what will our profession be it will
[1:00:52] be our confession and who we believe
[1:00:54] that he is and who we are in him you
[1:00:58] understand now it's more than just
[1:01:01] saying well I'm a Christian I believe
[1:01:03] the Lord I accept the message of the
[1:01:05] hour I believe I'm going in the Rapture
[1:01:08] anybody can do that mentally and that
[1:01:10] never Strike their soul but the type of
[1:01:14] profession that we must hold fast is the
[1:01:17] one that God himself has revealed to us
[1:01:20] by the Holy Ghost and once that is there
[1:01:24] even though we have it we still must
[1:01:27] hold on to it why because symptoms
[1:01:30] sickness all types of negative things
[1:01:33] around us will do its best to take it
[1:01:36] away from us anybody ever lost that oh
[1:01:39] yeah
[1:01:40] you know you can imagine now that he
[1:01:42] would write to them and say let us hold
[1:01:45] fast that profession so it has to do
[1:01:48] with the believer's testimony of what he
[1:01:51] believes that Jesus is but it also has
[1:01:54] to do with what the believer believes
[1:01:56] that he is in Christ Jesus now the Jews
[1:02:00] in the Old Testament were a type of this
[1:02:02] in that they wandered through the
[1:02:04] Wilderness for 40 years and God the
[1:02:07] Bible tells us that God actually LED
[1:02:09] them a different way now there was a
[1:02:12] more direct past that would have led
[1:02:14] them straight away to the promised land
[1:02:16] but if they would have went straight
[1:02:18] away from Crossing out of Egypt straight
[1:02:21] by the way the crow would flies would
[1:02:23] say they would have went more direct
[1:02:25] they could have been there in a very
[1:02:27] short time but had they went that way it
[1:02:30] was the most civilized trade route in
[1:02:33] the known world at that time so they
[1:02:35] would have fought the most tremendous
[1:02:38] battle so the Bible says that God LED
[1:02:40] them another way lest they would become
[1:02:43] discouraged in the way because of War so
[1:02:48] God LED them the long way around and
[1:02:51] they thought why are we going this way
[1:02:54] no doubt some of them knew the trade
[1:02:55] routes they knew the shortest path to
[1:02:59] this land and it could not understand
[1:03:01] they couldn't make no sense out of the
[1:03:03] whole scenario why would God lead them
[1:03:06] way around this way he did it for their
[1:03:08] own good and I'll tell you there's times
[1:03:10] he leads you and I the same way and we
[1:03:13] try to contemplate it figure it out and
[1:03:15] just be honest with me today most of the
[1:03:18] time we don't we just say I don't
[1:03:20] understand I don't understand but if you
[1:03:22] could look out there he's got a giant
[1:03:24] he's sparing you from he's got another
[1:03:26] trial he's sparing you from and it's
[1:03:28] actually for our good that he's doing it
[1:03:31] this way but it doesn't always tell us
[1:03:34] that he wants us to trust him so what
[1:03:36] the Jews lost as they were in this
[1:03:39] transitory time and they're moving from
[1:03:42] the land of Egypt into the promised land
[1:03:44] what they lost was their confession they
[1:03:48] lost their confession that the god that
[1:03:51] brought them out of the land of Egypt
[1:03:52] the god that gave them the token under
[1:03:54] the administration of the Prophet Moses
[1:03:57] that same God was going to lead them to
[1:03:59] the land but what left first their
[1:04:02] confession he's forgot us he's not with
[1:04:06] us anymore where is he we can't find him
[1:04:09] we can't see him we can't feel him what
[1:04:12] did they lose they lost their confession
[1:04:15] now remember the prophet tells us that
[1:04:17] God never left them but they left him
[1:04:20] but it had to begin with in their heart
[1:04:23] before they would physically leave him
[1:04:25] so word was one of the first aspects
[1:04:27] that they left him they left him in
[1:04:30] their confession that he loved them that
[1:04:33] he cared for them and he brought them
[1:04:35] out with a mighty hand and if he brought
[1:04:37] them out You See Redemption actually has
[1:04:40] two parts and the first part is coming
[1:04:43] out and the second part is going into a
[1:04:47] person can believe God can bring them
[1:04:49] from The World God can bring them from a
[1:04:52] life of drinking and a life of drug
[1:04:55] addiction on the life of all kinds of
[1:04:57] things and many people accept the Lord
[1:04:59] Jesus on that basis but they never go
[1:05:03] any further all they do is just confess
[1:05:06] well he's my savior He's My Savior and I
[1:05:08] love him and I no longer belong to the
[1:05:10] devil but they never become a disciple
[1:05:13] they never go any farther in Christ
[1:05:15] Jesus don't you understand the right the
[1:05:18] Rapture is for those who are not just
[1:05:21] saved from sin it is for those who
[1:05:23] become one with Christ Jesus in the word
[1:05:27] now you realize that for for the
[1:05:29] children of Israel they could testify
[1:05:31] things most of us have never even seen
[1:05:33] in our life the Miracles that God did in
[1:05:36] the land of Egypt had never been done
[1:05:37] before and have never been replicated
[1:05:39] exactly like they were then and they
[1:05:42] could stand up and have a testimony
[1:05:43] meeting boy didn't we see God do
[1:05:45] something God done this and God done
[1:05:48] that and God done something else and yet
[1:05:50] they began to get away from their
[1:05:52] confession that they believed that God
[1:05:55] that brought them out could take them in
[1:05:57] so where did they run into issues
[1:06:00] believing that God had brought them out
[1:06:03] no believed in God would continue to
[1:06:06] take them in I wonder if some of us
[1:06:09] aren't in the same place today oh yeah
[1:06:11] he saved me from sin I was lost I used
[1:06:13] to drink I used to do this and that but
[1:06:16] I I just don't know if he can take me on
[1:06:18] in or not I just don't know if he can
[1:06:20] finish this work if you're not careful
[1:06:22] there's where you will lose your
[1:06:24] confession I'm struggling with this and
[1:06:26] I'm struggling with that I it didn't
[1:06:28] bother me when I was a sinner of course
[1:06:30] not you was a hog in the pig lot you was
[1:06:33] eating slop you was eating junk you was
[1:06:35] eating all kind of old trashy things
[1:06:38] that matched your nature and now you've
[1:06:40] come out of that but don't lose your
[1:06:43] confession in Christ Jesus
[1:06:46] how many believes the same God that
[1:06:48] brought you out can bring you in
[1:06:50] well if he came he said puny God I'll
[1:06:52] tell you that this morning
[1:06:54] but they begin to lose their confession
[1:06:57] I want you to notice in the pogos on to
[1:06:59] say in Hebrews 4 15 we have not an high
[1:07:04] priests which cannot be touched with the
[1:07:06] feeling of our infirmities again look at
[1:07:09] this word weakness disease sickness want
[1:07:13] of strength feebleness of health or
[1:07:17] sickness or of the Soul now can you
[1:07:20] imagine in order for him to be a high
[1:07:23] priest that could be able to understand
[1:07:25] people of infirmity he himself must also
[1:07:29] become infirm so Jesus became sick Jesus
[1:07:34] became weary Jesus became oppressed I
[1:07:38] hope you understand this Jesus actually
[1:07:41] allowed himself to feel depressed he
[1:07:45] allowed himself to feel the depths of
[1:07:48] sadness and heartache and sorrow you
[1:07:50] understand that he must feel infirmity
[1:07:54] to help the infirmed now you know no
[1:07:57] matter how great a person can quote the
[1:08:00] scripture and quote the word I I don't
[1:08:02] necessarily if I'm in the time of need
[1:08:04] and if I'm really going through
[1:08:06] something and I want somebody to pray I
[1:08:08] don't really care if they're a
[1:08:09] theologian or not I don't care if they
[1:08:12] can quote the scripture word by word and
[1:08:14] tell me all the diphthongs of the Greek
[1:08:16] and they can quote the Aramaic and tell
[1:08:18] me where the word comes from what I want
[1:08:21] is somebody that can touch God
[1:08:23] now you know yourself if you've ever had
[1:08:26] anything in your life those of you
[1:08:27] that's had kidney stones or say cancer
[1:08:30] you go through something there's
[1:08:31] something about having that yourself or
[1:08:34] your wife or your daughter or your
[1:08:35] children it changes your view from that
[1:08:38] point on anytime you hear of anybody
[1:08:41] having that it touches a part of you
[1:08:44] that was never touched before come on
[1:08:46] say Amen you know it's the truth because
[1:08:49] it does something to you well that's the
[1:08:52] way God had to become himself he had to
[1:08:56] become that he knew it because he knew
[1:08:59] all things but he never experienced it
[1:09:02] until he experienced it in the Divine
[1:09:06] human relationship that he did in Christ
[1:09:09] Jesus so then we have a high priest
[1:09:12] himself who was infirmed and felt sad
[1:09:17] and felt lonely you imagine how
[1:09:19] disappointed Jesus must have been in the
[1:09:21] apostles how many ever been disappointed
[1:09:23] with
[1:09:24] friends family members loved ones sure
[1:09:26] we all have can you imagine how
[1:09:28] disappointed the Lord Jesus was in his
[1:09:31] disciples how disappointed he was in
[1:09:33] people that he loved and that he tried
[1:09:36] to lead them to the truth and and that
[1:09:38] they're fussing and arguing along the
[1:09:40] way because they're trying to figure out
[1:09:42] who's going to be the bishop when Jesus
[1:09:44] is gone who's going to be the big man
[1:09:46] when Jesus is gone you're talking about
[1:09:48] disappointing oh my some of the greatest
[1:09:51] disappointments that I experience as a
[1:09:54] pastor as a servant of God it's not from
[1:09:57] Sinners out here I expect him to run me
[1:09:59] down I expect them to talk about me I
[1:10:02] expect them to do all kinds of crazy
[1:10:04] stuff but what becomes so heartbreaking
[1:10:07] and disappointment to me is people who
[1:10:09] say they love you
[1:10:11] Christians who say they love you you
[1:10:13] know what I'm talking about it's like we
[1:10:15] don't expect very much from the Sinners
[1:10:17] that we work with and go to school with
[1:10:20] but what breaks our heart the most when
[1:10:23] Christians will sneak around behind our
[1:10:25] back and talk about us or betray us or
[1:10:28] whatever you know what I'm saying then
[1:10:30] what does that do say I thought they was
[1:10:32] a Christian I thought they was a brother
[1:10:34] I thought she loved me I thought he
[1:10:37] loved me can you imagine the
[1:10:39] disappointment that Jesus must have felt
[1:10:42] in people so when you and I feel that
[1:10:44] way we have a high priest that we can go
[1:10:47] to we can just be honest with them and
[1:10:49] say Lord I don't understand my sister
[1:10:52] said this my brother did that Lord I
[1:10:55] need your help before he come to this
[1:10:58] earth he could not relate and say I
[1:11:01] understand Dave I understand I
[1:11:03] understand what you're going through but
[1:11:06] now when you go to him he can answer
[1:11:08] back and say I know exactly what you
[1:11:11] feel why because one of my preachers
[1:11:14] actually sold me out to the Sanhedrin it
[1:11:17] was one of my preachers that I anointed
[1:11:20] one of my 12 closest Apostles that I
[1:11:24] called them and chose them that forsook
[1:11:27] me and betrayed me I understand how you
[1:11:30] feel
[1:11:31] notice and again in Paul whenever he
[1:11:34] says this let us therefore come boldly
[1:11:37] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:11:40] obtain Mercy how many needs Mercy that
[1:11:44] we may obtain mercy and find Grace to
[1:11:48] help in the time of need don't friend
[1:11:50] get in your mind that the only time that
[1:11:53] you need Grace is associated with sin no
[1:11:56] do we we limit God so much when we think
[1:12:00] well the only reason I need Grace is
[1:12:02] whenever I've sinned and done wrong no
[1:12:04] you need Grace every time you have a
[1:12:07] need
[1:12:08] what you notice Paul does not put this
[1:12:10] just about repentance of sin but he says
[1:12:13] find Grace to help in the time of need
[1:12:17] as a matter of fact the more I look at
[1:12:18] this the more I realize I need Grace
[1:12:20] every day of my life I need Grace to
[1:12:23] overcome I need Grace to live right I
[1:12:26] need Grace to forgive I need Grace when
[1:12:28] I need forgiven you understand so we
[1:12:30] find Grace to help in the time of deed
[1:12:34] watch again in Hebrews chapter 10 verse
[1:12:36] 13. Paul said let us hold fast here he
[1:12:40] goes again with the same words let us
[1:12:42] hold fast the profession and again the
[1:12:46] word whole there means to take by or be
[1:12:50] powerful to be chief be master of so God
[1:12:56] wants us to be master of our profession
[1:13:01] or our confession so God don't want
[1:13:04] circumstance or events or what people
[1:13:07] say or even your mistakes or your
[1:13:10] failures to be the master of your
[1:13:13] confession well I'm nothing but a
[1:13:15] failure I'll never amount to nothing
[1:13:17] I'll never go on the Rapture they don't
[1:13:19] need me at the church nobody loves me
[1:13:21] nobody even speaks to me I ain't no good
[1:13:24] I guess I'll just quit do you understand
[1:13:26] somebody else has got a hold of your
[1:13:29] tongue
[1:13:30] well come on now but Paul said what you
[1:13:33] need to do is be the master of your
[1:13:36] confession I wish somebody would say
[1:13:38] Amen
[1:13:40] be the master to rule to cease to lay
[1:13:44] hands on in order to get one to get him
[1:13:48] into one's power so God wants us to lay
[1:13:52] hands on our mouths lay hands on our
[1:13:57] confession lay hands on our profession
[1:14:01] and say shut up
[1:14:03] shut up that negative stuff God saved
[1:14:07] you God Sanctified you God give you the
[1:14:10] Holy Ghost he loves you he cares for you
[1:14:13] you have value you have worse
[1:14:18] oh my now remember this is definitely
[1:14:21] not mind over matter
[1:14:24] but there is a truth to the
[1:14:26] understanding of the psyche now this may
[1:14:30] Blow Your Plum out of your Pew today or
[1:14:32] your seat but the prophet uses this word
[1:14:34] psyche because the people in his day
[1:14:38] actually thought that he was a mind
[1:14:40] reader so he would be able to stand up
[1:14:43] and tell the people that they lived on
[1:14:45] this certain address there's three steps
[1:14:47] going up to your apartment where you
[1:14:48] live I see your address 2309 West so and
[1:14:52] so you want to adulter Heaven said God
[1:14:54] wore glasses he told you this and that
[1:14:56] and the other you can imagine the people
[1:14:57] thinking this guy's a witch I mean this
[1:15:00] guy's nothing but he's just a sorcerer
[1:15:02] or something like that so he had to use
[1:15:05] this word citing and explain to them
[1:15:07] that it's exactly a part of our being
[1:15:10] that God made us that way and oh it'd be
[1:15:13] wonderful if we lived under the
[1:15:15] anointing 24 7 but we don't do it we
[1:15:18] don't always overcome under the
[1:15:21] anointing as a matter of fact most of my
[1:15:22] overcoming is without them anointing
[1:15:24] without feeling one thing but I'll stand
[1:15:27] on the word whether I feel it or whether
[1:15:29] I don't
[1:15:30] but yet our mind what we feed on what we
[1:15:34] the appetite the diet that we feed into
[1:15:37] our spirit is much of what we become and
[1:15:40] lie now you say brother Donnie here you
[1:15:42] go and that mind will partner that mind
[1:15:44] over matter no it's not mine over matter
[1:15:47] notices the prophet says it this way God
[1:15:50] can't do nothing
[1:15:52] till you first confess
[1:15:55] that he is now I want you to notice how
[1:15:58] your confession actually is tied to what
[1:16:02] the Lord Jesus does and says about you
[1:16:06] in heaven now remember he is our high
[1:16:10] priest so we want to go to him this
[1:16:12] morning as the Sanhedrin did to the Old
[1:16:15] Testament high priest and we want to lay
[1:16:17] at the feet of our high priest our
[1:16:20] confession and say this is what we
[1:16:23] believe you are to us and this is what
[1:16:27] we believe we are to you now we want you
[1:16:31] to act on our behalf now remember this
[1:16:34] is what the high priest would do so they
[1:16:36] would come oh Apostle of God messenger
[1:16:39] of God we believe that you're going into
[1:16:41] the holy place you will represent us now
[1:16:44] remember he walks in there with the
[1:16:46] ephod on him he walks in there with the
[1:16:49] breastplate on him the breastplate
[1:16:51] actually was something that was worse or
[1:16:54] like a vest something like this except
[1:16:56] it had 12 stones are close to here four
[1:16:59] rows of three it was a birthstone of the
[1:17:02] Twelve Tribes of the children of Israel
[1:17:04] so they would have their names engraved
[1:17:07] on each one it was when the light of God
[1:17:09] would shine upon that stone it was the
[1:17:12] urum thumum so the light of God would
[1:17:14] shine upon it and the supernatural
[1:17:16] colors would reflect from the high
[1:17:19] priest's heart because the light of God
[1:17:22] shined on this and the mixing together
[1:17:24] of these Stones which is the
[1:17:26] foreshadowing of the city you're going
[1:17:28] to live in then when the rainbow colors
[1:17:30] come back it was showing that Israel was
[1:17:33] God's covenant people so he walked in
[1:17:37] there representing them so their name
[1:17:40] was on his heart their name was on this
[1:17:43] Stone so here was issachar zibulan Judah
[1:17:47] Levi nephtalia all the different ones
[1:17:49] they couldn't go in there themselves but
[1:17:52] they went by representation so their
[1:17:55] names was under the trial every
[1:17:57] individual name was not there but every
[1:18:00] name that was identified in the tribe of
[1:18:02] naphtali or Judah or issachar or
[1:18:05] whoevermore you was identified if you
[1:18:07] was a Jew under that birthstone praise
[1:18:10] the lord well if God could do that in
[1:18:12] the Old Testament what about the Lord
[1:18:14] Jesus he did not wear our names on a
[1:18:18] vest as it were he did not wear our
[1:18:21] names on and he fought but he said your
[1:18:24] names are engraved in the palm of my
[1:18:26] hand
[1:18:27] so when he goes before Spirit God he
[1:18:31] goes by representation to represent
[1:18:33] every one of us that's the kind of high
[1:18:36] priest we have today now what is he
[1:18:39] going to say well the high priest would
[1:18:42] walk in there on the day of atonement
[1:18:44] and he would say oh Lord God oh Yahweh I
[1:18:47] don't die I come here today to represent
[1:18:50] your people I bring this Blood of the
[1:18:53] atonement please forgive your people one
[1:18:55] man is repenting for the whole nation
[1:18:59] One Man by representation has the right
[1:19:03] to stand before God and if there's two
[1:19:06] million people standing outside of that
[1:19:09] Tabernacle two million people that
[1:19:12] believed that one high priest prayed and
[1:19:16] every one of their sins were forgiven in
[1:19:19] an instant by the prayer of one man oh
[1:19:23] Hallelujah if a high priest could do
[1:19:26] that what can the Lord Jesus Jesus do
[1:19:28] for us today but you see they must
[1:19:31] believe they had to trust they had to
[1:19:34] believe enough they try to figure it out
[1:19:36] my mind now how is that even possible
[1:19:37] how can one man go in there and
[1:19:40] represent me and Scott and everybody
[1:19:42] else and that one man is going to pray
[1:19:44] and I'm going to be forgiven how is that
[1:19:46] even possible they probably couldn't
[1:19:48] figure it out no more than we could but
[1:19:50] they had to believe it and they had to
[1:19:52] confess it I believe I believe when that
[1:19:56] high priest goes in there I am forgiven
[1:20:00] I believe when he walks in I don't
[1:20:03] understand it I don't understand how it
[1:20:05] works but I believe when he walks in
[1:20:07] there my sins are annihilated so their
[1:20:12] profession much match his office
[1:20:18] I want you to listen to this
[1:20:21] I hope you understand that some of these
[1:20:23] modern day guys that preach this
[1:20:26] positive confession stuff this is being
[1:20:28] preached before some of them as ever
[1:20:30] preachers
[1:20:31] in order some of them got it from a
[1:20:34] prophet of God oh they'll never tell it
[1:20:37] but that's why they got it notice God
[1:20:39] can't do nothing to you first confess
[1:20:41] that he is then when you confess it then
[1:20:45] believe it act upon it stay with it and
[1:20:49] God will bring you out
[1:20:52] notice again he said now he's the high
[1:20:54] priest of our confession you get what I
[1:20:57] mean what you confess you are that's
[1:21:01] what you are
[1:21:04] now the Lord Jesus will never match your
[1:21:07] confession in heaven if you're saying
[1:21:10] I'm defeating I'm no good there's no way
[1:21:13] out I'll never get through this I'll
[1:21:16] never be victorious I'll just barely
[1:21:18] hang on from one service to the next you
[1:21:21] do not have a high priest that Echoes In
[1:21:24] Heaven Before the Throne of God that
[1:21:27] type of testimony
[1:21:28] so when you're saying that he's saying
[1:21:31] nothing
[1:21:40] is that what you want
[1:21:42] do you want one you are praying to him
[1:21:45] that he can't even respond because your
[1:21:49] testimony does not match his thought
[1:21:53] of you so his thought of you is you're a
[1:21:57] conqueror you're more than a conqueror
[1:22:00] his thought of you is you are one of his
[1:22:03] attributes he loves you before the
[1:22:06] foundation of the world but you're
[1:22:08] saying something totally opposite so he
[1:22:11] cannot Echo your confession in heaven
[1:22:14] because you're not saying what he
[1:22:16] thought you're saying what you think not
[1:22:19] what he thinks
[1:22:22] oh praise the Lord
[1:22:25] now I want you to notice this any man
[1:22:27] will never live any further or any
[1:22:31] higher than what he believes
[1:22:34] he's living
[1:22:36] so you'll never live any higher than
[1:22:39] what you believe you're living again he
[1:22:42] says remember he can never do nothing
[1:22:45] for you until first you say
[1:22:50] he's done it
[1:22:52] oh brother don't in my marriage is
[1:22:54] enough to shape every voice and my my
[1:22:55] wife she's gone too far this time I'll
[1:22:58] tell you one thing my husband has gone
[1:22:59] too far I'll never be able to forgive
[1:23:02] him do you know what just come out of
[1:23:04] your mouth
[1:23:07] you'll never be able to forgive him or
[1:23:10] forgive her never
[1:23:13] is a long time
[1:23:15] you must say I'm struggling to do it and
[1:23:18] I need God's help that's one thing but
[1:23:20] don't never say never
[1:23:23] don't never say I'll never go to church
[1:23:26] again I'll never I'll never I'll never
[1:23:29] if you're going to say never say it this
[1:23:31] way I'll never again testify of the
[1:23:33] devil I'll never again let the devil
[1:23:36] control my confession I'll never again
[1:23:39] let Satan lie to me and me take that is
[1:23:44] who I am
[1:23:45] [Applause]
[1:23:48] isn't it amazing we're not very good at
[1:23:50] those Nevers
[1:23:52] we're so good at never forgiving and
[1:23:55] never this and never that but when it
[1:23:57] comes to the devil it just seems like
[1:23:59] it's natural for us to never never never
[1:24:03] but remember the Lord Jesus can never do
[1:24:07] nothing for you and the first you say
[1:24:09] he's done it believe him and accept them
[1:24:11] and testify to you know that he's the
[1:24:13] high priest of what confession now he
[1:24:16] quotes the scripture we just read
[1:24:17] Hebrews 3 1. now he's standing at the
[1:24:20] right hand of the father to make
[1:24:22] intercession Upon Our confession so he's
[1:24:26] not setting there to make intercession
[1:24:29] upon what he wants
[1:24:33] the Bible says he is not willing that
[1:24:35] any should perish but that all should
[1:24:38] come to repentance but we'll all come to
[1:24:41] repentance
[1:24:42] why
[1:24:44] because God wants them to go to hell
[1:24:46] because God wants him to see he wants to
[1:24:49] see him burn in a lake of fire no it's
[1:24:52] not his will it's not his desire it's
[1:24:56] not his purpose that the biggest drama
[1:24:59] the biggest liar the biggest whatever
[1:25:01] out here in Johnson said it's not God's
[1:25:03] will that that man or woman go to hell
[1:25:06] and burn and burn and burn that's not
[1:25:08] God's will but why do they not receive
[1:25:12] it because they well I came to her I've
[1:25:14] been to church and I've seen a bunch of
[1:25:16] Hypocrites I agree there's a bunch of
[1:25:18] Hypocrites in church but everybody in
[1:25:20] church ain't Hypocrites and if you let
[1:25:22] the Hypocrites stand between you and God
[1:25:24] they're closer to God than you are oh
[1:25:26] yeah there's a lot of Hypocrites there's
[1:25:28] a lot of folks that don't live it but
[1:25:29] that ain't got nothing to do with me
[1:25:31] that ain't got nothing to do with you
[1:25:33] there's Hypocrites but we just move
[1:25:36] right around them and we keep serving
[1:25:38] God with all of our hearts
[1:25:42] now about hypocrites ain't nothing but a
[1:25:44] scarecrow to try to keep you from eating
[1:25:46] butter beans what you need to do is do
[1:25:48] lots of little groundhog dead when the
[1:25:50] prophet was out there planting butter
[1:25:51] beans in his garden and he would plant
[1:25:53] them out there and the groundhog would
[1:25:54] come to and eat them he'd go back and
[1:25:56] plant them again the groundhog would
[1:25:57] come to down and eat him so he put out a
[1:25:59] scarecrow and he put that scarecrow and
[1:26:01] boy it scared the little that little
[1:26:03] groundhog for a bit but after a while he
[1:26:05] got used to it so it would Rattle and
[1:26:07] make faces and he got to where he'd just
[1:26:09] go right around him well that's what you
[1:26:10] and I need to do with Hypocrites liars
[1:26:13] whoremongers and whatever more why can
[1:26:15] you believe so-and-so goes to church
[1:26:17] over there well right here's a good
[1:26:18] place for so and so to be changed right
[1:26:21] here's a brother Donny there's people
[1:26:23] that come to the church that drink and
[1:26:25] don't do right don't you think I don't
[1:26:26] know that but I figure they're better
[1:26:28] off coming here than they are to a bar
[1:26:30] on Sunday morning the better off coming
[1:26:32] yeah well somebody preached with me
[1:26:34] today they can get their lives changed
[1:26:37] here they can get their souls changed
[1:26:40] here by the grace of God
[1:26:46] ah
[1:26:48] now notice he said
[1:26:50] he's before the father to make good
[1:26:52] anything
[1:26:54] that we confess in the Redemptive
[1:26:57] blessings of course
[1:26:59] so you mean God Almighty can't do
[1:27:01] anything for me until first I say
[1:27:07] he can do it
[1:27:12] wow
[1:27:13] now remember it isn't how much you cry
[1:27:16] it is and how much you repent
[1:27:19] it isn't how loud you can cry to God
[1:27:24] it is and how sincere
[1:27:28] you can be
[1:27:30] it's how much Faith you have when you
[1:27:32] come to it
[1:27:34] he doesn't save you on the merits of
[1:27:36] your prayer he doesn't save you on the
[1:27:39] merits of your righteousness
[1:27:42] he saves you upon the merits of your
[1:27:44] faith
[1:27:45] it's by faith are you saved and that
[1:27:50] through Grace
[1:27:52] well to God I I live right I don't cut
[1:27:54] my hair and Lord I don't cheat and I
[1:27:56] don't lie Lord I need heal so I want you
[1:27:59] to heal me on this basis I pay my God
[1:28:01] that ain't the way he heals you he heals
[1:28:03] you on the basis of your face and his
[1:28:05] promised word and then you start telling
[1:28:09] him what you believe by your stripes I
[1:28:12] was healed can you imagine Isaiah
[1:28:14] writing such a thing he writes that
[1:28:16] hundreds of years before the Lord Jesus
[1:28:19] ever died and Isaiah puts it in the past
[1:28:23] tense and by whose stripes we are healed
[1:28:27] he put it in the past tense before the
[1:28:30] present tense ever declared it
[1:28:33] oh you say you people are crazy well if
[1:28:35] we are we're enjoying the blessings of
[1:28:37] God you know imagine Isaiah writing that
[1:28:40] brother Scott and saying before the Lord
[1:28:42] Jesus ever died by his stripes we are
[1:28:44] already healed a real believer in faith
[1:28:47] and the promise of the word they can
[1:28:49] have every symptom they can be dealing
[1:28:51] with all types of negative things but
[1:28:53] down inside of their heart their
[1:28:55] confession is still by his drops I am
[1:28:58] healed but you got a terrible headache
[1:29:01] by his tribes I am healed but you still
[1:29:04] ain't got your voice back this but by
[1:29:06] his stripes I am healed But Eric because
[1:29:09] you're still dealing with symptom but by
[1:29:11] his child I am already healed those of
[1:29:15] you sitting here today fighting this and
[1:29:17] that and the other by his strike I am
[1:29:20] already healed the work has already been
[1:29:24] done that's my confession
[1:29:28] now high priest go into the presence of
[1:29:32] God
[1:29:33] and repeat
[1:29:35] what I say
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:40] we've heard it preach for decades
[1:29:42] the opening of the word
[1:29:44] the third poll
[1:29:46] speaking the word
[1:29:48] well here's your chance
[1:29:54] forget squirrels I don't need squirrels
[1:29:57] I need healing I need Deliverance forget
[1:30:00] me controlling the lightning and the
[1:30:02] Thunder I don't need that
[1:30:04] I need wisdom to guide God's people and
[1:30:07] it's strange oh hallelujah how many
[1:30:10] understands what I'm saying
[1:30:13] oh my
[1:30:15] god listen to this friend how he Narrows
[1:30:17] us down he can't do nothing nothing
[1:30:22] for you until you confess it
[1:30:30] nothing for you until you confess it as
[1:30:33] ever for he is the high priest of
[1:30:34] conjunction of your confession he can do
[1:30:37] nothing you can confess me before men
[1:30:40] I'll confess you
[1:30:43] before the father
[1:30:45] what you say I've done here for you
[1:30:50] that's what I say the father that you
[1:30:55] that I have done for you
[1:30:58] so what you say on earth when it aligns
[1:31:02] with his word he says it in heaven
[1:31:04] Before the Throne of God on your behalf
[1:31:10] not just that you're forgiven this is
[1:31:12] not just for folks getting saved this is
[1:31:15] not just for green Christians young
[1:31:17] converts that's just come to Christ how
[1:31:19] can a sinner know these things to get
[1:31:20] saved he can't but this is for people
[1:31:23] that's been saved and people that should
[1:31:25] be Disciples of the Lord and then you're
[1:31:27] saying well the blessings have slowed
[1:31:29] down since I got saved he wants you to
[1:31:31] grow up he wants you to learn how to
[1:31:34] manifest what he's called you to be and
[1:31:37] he wants you to learn that he
[1:31:39] reciprocates in heaven with you so your
[1:31:43] conversation on the earth can be
[1:31:45] repeated by the Lord Jesus Before the
[1:31:49] Throne of God can you imagine the Lord
[1:31:52] Jesus wanting to take your words be for
[1:31:56] Father God he's not wanting to send the
[1:31:59] Lord Jesus oh Jesus please heal me oh
[1:32:02] Jesus oh Jesus that's when you got saved
[1:32:04] but now that your son or daughter of God
[1:32:06] he wants you down here in the middle of
[1:32:08] Hell in the middle of battles in the
[1:32:10] middle of trouble so quote his word
[1:32:13] and then Jesus
[1:32:22] Lord God
[1:32:29] he's the high priest you get that young
[1:32:31] man to hear the prophet speaking to a
[1:32:33] young man the other Scott of need you
[1:32:35] get that young man the high priest of
[1:32:37] your confession
[1:32:39] setting to make intercessions on my
[1:32:42] confession I have a right to confess
[1:32:44] that he's done anything for me that's in
[1:32:47] the Redemptive blessings there you are
[1:32:49] he can can't do nothing for you
[1:32:52] until you first confess it he's a high
[1:32:55] priest
[1:32:56] of your confession not his
[1:32:59] don't you understand yourself Santa they
[1:33:01] are mine they are mine I claim them I
[1:33:03] love them I forgive them I died for them
[1:33:06] that's already been settled
[1:33:09] but he's waiting on us
[1:33:11] you imagine day in and day out brother
[1:33:13] Paul he says give me something children
[1:33:17] give me something to take before father
[1:33:19] today
[1:33:20] sister Judy give me something that I
[1:33:22] can't
[1:33:24] give me something young people that I
[1:33:26] can tell father
[1:33:28] let me Express to Father your
[1:33:30] faithfulness
[1:33:35] your brother Daryl prayed for you but
[1:33:36] give me something that I can tell father
[1:33:38] so I can tell father you're still
[1:33:41] holding fast to your professor tell me
[1:33:43] something to tell him
[1:33:45] oh I'm down I'm weary I'm no good I got
[1:33:48] prayed for yesterday and my symptoms is
[1:33:50] worth I don't know if I'll even go back
[1:33:52] or not
[1:33:53] so you give Jesus all this to say
[1:33:56] and Jesus says absolutely
[1:34:04] you're saying Lord
[1:34:06] what's going on he said
[1:34:07] repeat that
[1:34:09] I cannot say that
[1:34:16] praise the Lord
[1:34:20] listen to this
[1:34:22] believe us now this he cannot intercede
[1:34:25] for you
[1:34:27] until first you confess
[1:34:31] it's already done
[1:34:34] by faith
[1:34:38] for he is the high priest of your
[1:34:40] confession
[1:34:44] not the high priest of your salvation
[1:34:47] not the high priest of your mercy not
[1:34:50] the high Priests of your oh I got the
[1:34:51] Holy Ghost praise the Lord I got the
[1:34:53] Holy Ghost but he's the high priest of
[1:34:55] your confession
[1:34:58] well he said how often should I do this
[1:35:00] however often you need it
[1:35:04] four times a day 40 would probably be
[1:35:07] more like it or 400
[1:35:10] . hey look we're going to say something
[1:35:12] okay we're going to say something most
[1:35:14] of us have got a mouth and we know how
[1:35:16] to use that tongue in our fat mouth and
[1:35:18] we say so much negative stuff and so
[1:35:20] much something ain't worth nothing if
[1:35:22] you're going to put a bunch of stuff on
[1:35:23] Facebook why don't you put your
[1:35:25] confession on that I'm saved I'm
[1:35:27] Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy
[1:35:29] Ghost it may not look it like like it
[1:35:32] now but I am a complete Overcomer in
[1:35:35] Christ Jesus it may look like this
[1:35:38] disease has gotten my body but I want
[1:35:41] everybody to know by his stripes I am
[1:35:43] already healed it may look like I'm a
[1:35:47] loser but a whatever devil in hell to
[1:35:49] know I am a winner and Jesus Echoes it
[1:35:54] in heaven you hear that father he is a
[1:35:58] winner she is healed she is delivered
[1:36:03] and Jesus is a high priest of your
[1:36:06] confession
[1:36:08] go imagine when you give him that he
[1:36:10] says give me more give me more give me
[1:36:14] give him I can say on your
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:26] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:36:28] setting at the right hand of the father
[1:36:31] making good
[1:36:34] what you're confessing
[1:36:38] now that's the same thing it is about
[1:36:39] healing you accept him as your healer
[1:36:42] renounce
[1:36:44] your feelings
[1:36:47] that's hard to do when you've got a
[1:36:48] headache that's nearly blinding you
[1:36:51] right you got a migraine or you got this
[1:36:52] or that or the other and you're dealing
[1:36:54] with it it seemed like it's about to get
[1:36:56] the best of you but renounce something
[1:37:00] in the middle of pain speak to your body
[1:37:02] and say in the name of Jesus I am healed

[1:37:25] he renounced his feelings
[1:37:29] he renounced his anxiety
[1:37:38] some wonder how many days
[1:37:42] the Lord Jesus ain't had a whole lot to
[1:37:44] do

[1:40:24] talk about
[1:40:25] than you

[1:40:58] Supernatural signs and wonders that has
[1:41:00] never been anything like that on the
[1:41:01] earth he didn't just come with Miracles
[1:41:03] he come with a message this is part of
[1:41:06] the message this is what separates us
[1:41:08] from the rest of the church World a
[1:41:10] message to get us out of here don't you
[1:41:12] understand why the bride is going to be
[1:41:14] so different going on the Rapture she's
[1:41:15] becoming the word as you feed on the
[1:41:18] word you walk by the word every day you

[1:46:48] attacked this whole week ain't nobody
[1:46:49] been attacked this week uh-huh yeah yeah
[1:46:52] I guarantee you why because Satan hates
[1:46:54] the truth or the word of God I can stand
[1:46:57] up here and preach about the cross
[1:46:58] forever Sunday from now until the
[1:47:00] Millennium comes but for most of us we
[1:47:02] have done received the power of the
[1:47:04] cross I can stand up and preach about
[1:47:06] the law and preach about Moses and all
[1:47:08] that's good but I want to bring to you
[1:47:10] something that you need for the hour
[1:47:12] you're living and for the battles that
[1:47:14] you are fighting if I can help you see
[1:47:17] who you are and help you see who he is
[1:47:20] in you oh my the devil is no match for
[1:47:23] you then brother sister we are an
[1:47:26] invincible Army but only when we know
[1:47:29] who we are and where we stand in God's
[1:47:32] promise
[1:47:35] I think of Russia just a year ago this
[1:47:37] week when they attacked Ukraine and they
[1:47:41] thought within a couple of weeks some of
[1:47:42] the greatest War people that study war
[1:47:45] from Europe from America they give
[1:47:47] Ukraine maybe a month maybe two
[1:47:51] some of the great generals and this and
[1:47:53] I said there ain't no way Ukraine will
[1:47:55] be able to withstand them here we are a
[1:47:57] year later and they are wearing them
[1:47:59] Russians out
[1:48:00] they are wiring them out
[1:48:03] they're undergunned they're
[1:48:06] undermissiled they're under binoculars
[1:48:08] they're under an Ever way possible but
[1:48:11] they have got a territory you know what
[1:48:14] the Russians are the aggressors that the
[1:48:16] ukrainians are fighting for their ground
[1:48:18] like you're fighting for your child and
[1:48:21] you're fighting for your husband or your
[1:48:22] girlfriend or you're fighting for your
[1:48:24] health and the devil said all I'll get
[1:48:26] him you stand up there you little
[1:48:28] spiritual Ukrainian drop your little M16

[1:48:40] right there and say you want more come
[1:48:42] on back come on back I ain't talking

[1:48:52] that can identify their place in Christ
[1:48:56] Jesus

[1:49:09] to add to your atomic Arsenal
[1:49:15] I am strong in the Lord
[1:49:18] and in his mighty power I'm going to
[1:49:20] give you some scripture references here

[1:49:24] I'm a chosen generation and a royal
[1:49:27] priesthood holy and special
[1:49:32] God hides me in a secret place I abide
[1:49:36] in the shadow of his presence
[1:49:39] God is my safe place I go to him because
[1:49:43] I trust him in times of mourning the
[1:49:47] Lord shall give me Comfort I seek the
[1:49:50] Lord he hears me and delivers me from
[1:49:53] all my fears my heart will not be
[1:49:56] troubled or be afraid God has given me
[1:50:00] peace I wish somebody would say Amen
[1:50:03] oh what a church we would be if we would
[1:50:07] replace all this negative stuff all this
[1:50:10] sickness stuff all this sadness stuff
[1:50:12] and give Jesus so much to imagine that
[1:50:15] next week the Lord Jesus is going to say

[1:50:20] people have overwhelmed me this week
[1:50:22] they
[1:50:23] they have overwhelmed me and they've not
[1:50:26] been complaining and groaning and
[1:50:28] grumbling but they have been testified

[2:10:59] that they have they don't have
[2:11:01] constructive all they had is destructive
[2:11:03] everything is negative
[2:11:05] they don't have nothing to do good to
[2:11:07] say about nobody no preacher of the
[2:11:09] church instead of come and saying wow
[2:11:10] what a beautiful place to I don't like
[2:11:12] the way they painted that ceiling black

[2:11:34] so I can be a better man a better
[2:11:36] Christian
[2:11:38] a greater Overcomer Lord God in my life
[2:11:42] we love you today Jesus
[2:11:45] I wonder I'm on all for prayer for
[2:11:47] those of you that's visible and those of
[2:11:49] you that are home or wherever you are in
[2:11:51] your office
[2:11:52] streaming the service wherever you might
[2:11:54] be Greenland Iceland
[2:11:57] Switzerland France South Africa wherever
[2:12:00] you are around the world
[2:12:01] you'd like to be remembered today
[2:12:03] sit right there in your home
[2:12:05] you visible here you say God remember me
[2:12:10] I'm sorry Lord Jesus I've not been
[2:12:12] confessing you
[2:12:14] I'm sorry I didn't realize there was
[2:12:16] such power there
[2:12:17] I pray you'd forgive me
[2:12:19] help me to be different after today
[2:12:22] would you mind laying your hand on the
[2:12:24] person standing near you
[2:12:27] let's pray together as a congregation
[2:12:29] today
[2:12:30] you visitors in our gates we welcome you
[2:12:33] too of course
[2:12:34] we want your heart to be ministered too
[2:12:37] as well
[2:12:39] now heavenly father is a group of
[2:12:41] believers
[2:12:42] we agree together
[2:12:45] We Believe Lord that what we've heard is
[2:12:47] the truth
[2:12:49] we don't want it to be that it'll go in
[2:12:51] one ear and out the others we say
[2:12:53] James called him forgetful hearers
[2:12:56] people that hear it but they don't
[2:12:58] really apply it to their lives
[2:13:00] we don't want to be that kind of people
[2:13:01] Lord
[2:13:02] I pray you would help us
[2:13:04] begin with me
[2:13:07] recreate my thoughts
[2:13:10] recreate
[2:13:12] Lord God that which I was born with in
[2:13:15] this negative world
[2:13:17] fed it to me since a child
[2:13:20] we don't even have to learn it really
[2:13:21] it's in our nature
[2:13:24] but Lord God would you help us today
[2:13:27] we're not designed to be great as far as
[2:13:29] the world is concerned
[2:13:31] most of us will never be on the who's
[2:13:34] whose book
[2:13:35] but we do want to make your who's who
[2:13:39] we want to be identified as your
[2:13:41] children
[2:13:42] but we don't want to just be saved
[2:13:46] and constantly live at the foot of the
[2:13:49] cross I know some people think that is
[2:13:51] such a great description to describe a
[2:13:54] Christian
[2:13:56] but we know that John was the only
[2:13:58] disciple as far as we know that was
[2:14:00] there to see you die at the cross
[2:14:03] but yet Matthew wrote more about it than
[2:14:05] John did
[2:14:07] the other gospel writers and why didn't
[2:14:09] John
[2:14:10] just write one chapter after another
[2:14:12] after another after another that John
[2:14:14] wrote about the cross but he also wrote
[2:14:16] about election
[2:14:17] and he wrote about the mystery of God
[2:14:19] and he wrote it wrote about so many
[2:14:20] other things
[2:14:22] because John didn't stop at the cross he
[2:14:25] knew the cross was the bridge to
[2:14:28] Eternity
[2:14:29] so father we don't want to stop at the
[2:14:31] cross
[2:14:32] Lord God we want the cross to become a
[2:14:34] bridge to Eternity for us
[2:14:37] and Eternity involves the word so it
[2:14:41] opens up all the things we need in our
[2:14:43] lives
[2:14:44] and Heaven consists of the word
[2:14:48] help us today Jesus
[2:14:51] we love you father hear our prayer now
[2:14:54] Lord God I pray
[2:14:55] in Jesus name
[2:14:58] and the Saints said
[2:15:00] a band from Kentucky
[2:15:03] there were certain vernacular that I
[2:15:05] picked up of being a Kentuckian
[2:15:07] one of them was that when you was a
[2:15:10] little boy especially
[2:15:12] and if you said words
[2:15:14] that you weren't supposed to say
[2:15:17] now I never had this to happen to me too
[2:15:19] many times but it happened enough where
[2:15:21] I didn't want it to happen again
[2:15:24] but Mama one time I said something and
[2:15:26] it wasn't bad words but it was just some
[2:15:29] smart mouth that I said to her
[2:15:32] she said little boy
[2:15:35] you're going to get your mouth washed
[2:15:37] out with soap
[2:15:42] we didn't have dial
[2:15:48] we didn't have antibacterial
[2:15:52] that smelt and tasted like lavender
[2:15:56] but on special occasions we used lie
[2:16:01] soap
[2:16:02] some of y'all don't want him I'm talking
[2:16:03] about do you how many knows what a lot
[2:16:05] of soap is
[2:16:06] all right some of you
[2:16:09] well it didn't take too many times now
[2:16:11] you say brother Donahue mean literally
[2:16:13] literally
[2:16:15] so she put your mouse over a wash pan
[2:16:18] and she gets that live soap real soapy
[2:16:21] and sticks that soap in your mouth
[2:16:23] and washes your mouths out
[2:16:27] nope I didn't see no words laying in
[2:16:30] that dish pan when she got done
[2:16:32] any all Ever Had it happen to you
[2:16:34] brother Paul has all right some more
[2:16:36] okay praise the Lord but today they'd
[2:16:38] call that child abuse
[2:16:41] but I'll tell you it taught me a lesson
[2:16:42] that I wouldn't take a million dollars
[2:16:44] for it today
[2:16:45] so actually what just happened in this
[2:16:48] service was the Lord Jesus had me grab
[2:16:51] shall we all by the back of the neck
[2:16:53] and hold your mouse over a pan of
[2:16:56] washing of the Water by the word
[2:16:59] and put the soul for the word of God in
[2:17:01] your mouth
[2:17:03] [Applause]
[2:17:10] and wash your mouth out
[2:17:13] with the soap
[2:17:16] of the word
[2:17:20] saying something brother Harry
[2:17:24] don't you love him Saints
