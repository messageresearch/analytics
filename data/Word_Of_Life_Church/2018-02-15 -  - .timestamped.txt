[38:27] that went in jeopardy of their lives
[38:29] therefore he would not drink it these
[38:32] things did these three mighty men amen

[38:52] under the sixth trumpet the Pentecostals
[38:55] reject the Bible the lukewarm not only
[38:58] Pentecostals but all the rest the church
[39:01] world rejects Christ and he's put on the
[39:04] outside and the same seal rather when it
[39:08] was open to show Jesus on the outside of
[39:10] the church trying to get back in at the
[39:13] same time and brother him says the
[39:15] trumpet sounds for the Jews of the Jews
[39:18] recognized the atonement all glory
[39:19] hallelujah all mine now watch what he
[39:21] says the holy spirit has been bound by

[39:27] 2,000 years but it's to be loosed in the
[39:31] evening time by the evening time message
[39:35] the Holy Spirit back in the church again

[39:42] mighty men Christ himself revealed in
[39:45] human flesh in the evening time he said

[39:53] Kings desire the Kings desire let's just
[39:57] buy our hearts now the Kings desire
[39:59] Heavenly Father Lord as we are able to
[40:03] come into this place today with
[40:05] Thanksgiving in our hearts and Lord how
[40:07] that we've sang Lord and expressed our
[40:10] love and gratitude towards you we're
[40:13] asking that you would just come now Lord
[40:15] for the most important part of any
[40:17] service and that's the breaking of the
[40:19] bread of life may you come Lord and may
[40:22] you not just anoint me but Lord we all
[40:25] want to be anointed I pray Lord that you
[40:27] would just catch us all up together in
[40:29] heaven
[40:30] places in Christ this morning and Lord
[40:32] may we just bind the enemy may we lock
[40:34] him outside of this building now Lord
[40:37] that our thoughts and our minds could
[40:39] just be centered they can just be
[40:40] focused on you today and Lord for those
[40:43] Lord that are streaming and listening to
[40:45] this service we ask the Lord that you

[40:51] I asked Lord that you would go over
[40:52] there at may the warmth of the Holy
[40:54] Spirit move upon them lord help us that
[40:57] we can look within the scripture today
[40:58] Lord and help us not just to see the
[41:01] prophet Lord not just being able to see
[41:03] Lord different parts of the scripture
[41:05] but let me see myself in the words help
[41:08] me to recognize Lord I got something to
[41:10] do I must believe in this our Lord we
[41:13] ask that you had come now take control
[41:15] we pray in Jesus Christ's name and
[41:18] everybody said amen god bless you you
[41:21] may have your seats for a few moments
[41:22] the king's desire the Kings desire
[41:26] I'm sure this thought has been looked at
[41:29] many times but I want to take it from
[41:31] this angle of the desire that the King
[41:35] would have and take these men of David
[41:39] and just take and show you what the
[41:41] Prophet said I'm concerning these men
[41:43] and I've been listening to the message
[41:46] while little Bethlehem of course we all
[41:48] know why that God chose Bethlehem and
[41:51] those those things that the Prophet laid
[41:53] out and I wanted to try to take and
[41:57] bring this parallel if I can and I want
[42:00] to use it from some statements that
[42:01] brother venom is making concerning you
[42:03] and I and the Pergamon Church agent but
[42:05] the RAM said I want you to notice the
[42:07] harmony of the father and the son Jesus
[42:10] never did anything until first it was
[42:12] showed to him by the father that's John
[42:13] 5:19 this army now is to exist between
[42:17] the groom and his bride he shows her his
[42:20] word of life she receives it she never
[42:22] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[42:25] not even death for it the see be planted
[42:29] watch brother found now if the CP
[42:31] planted the water will raise it again
[42:32] and here is the secret of this the word
[42:36] is in the bride and as it wasn't married
[42:38] he said the bride has the mind of Christ
[42:42] for she knows what he wants done with
[42:44] the word she performs the command of the
[42:47] word in his name for she has thus saith
[42:51] the Lord then the word is quickened by
[42:54] the Spirit and then it comes to pass
[42:56] like a seed that's planted in the water
[42:58] it comes to full harvests serving its
[43:03] purpose those in the bride knew only his
[43:06] will and no one can make them do
[43:08] otherwise they have dust set the Lord or
[43:11] they keep still they know that it has to
[43:14] be God in them doing the works
[43:16] fulfilling his own word he did not
[43:19] complete all of his work while he was
[43:21] here in his earthly ministry so now he
[43:23] works in and through the bride
[43:26] she knows that for was not yet time for
[43:28] him to do certain things that he must do
[43:30] now but he will now fulfill through that
[43:34] bride the work which was left for this
[43:36] specific time we know that but the RAM
[43:40] brings a parallel of that story of these
[43:44] mighty men of David and he brings it
[43:47] right down to the time that we are
[43:49] living in right now and we know
[43:52] scripturally we know prophetically that
[43:55] we are living in the closing moments of
[43:57] the Gentile dispensations there is no
[44:00] more ages after this there's no more
[44:03] Church ages to come brother this is the
[44:06] final scene of the play amen and we know
[44:10] that about living in this time we are
[44:12] aware of that by scripture by prophecy
[44:16] that we are living in the time of the
[44:18] harvest we have come through the fall
[44:22] we've come through the winter we've seen
[44:24] the resurrection of the spring we've
[44:26] actually sit underneath the the more a
[44:29] the teaching rain but now that time is
[44:32] over we come to the time of the harvest
[44:34] and we know that this is the hour that
[44:37] has been promised throughout all the
[44:40] scripture every type of the Bible his
[44:43] vein manifests right before us today
[44:45] every scriptural type that laid in the
[44:47] Old Testament it's coming to pass right
[44:49] before our eyes today we are living in a
[44:52] time where the lamb has
[44:54] calm and he took the book out of the
[44:56] right hand of him that has sit on the
[44:58] throne and not only has he took the book
[45:01] but we've seen a mighty angel that has
[45:03] descended in this hour with that same
[45:05] book that is disclosed it's now often in
[45:08] the hand of the angel and we know this
[45:10] is the hour that that book comes down
[45:12] and he gives it to the seventh angel the
[45:14] seventh angel takes that book and he
[45:16] begins to reveal it to the people and I
[45:19] believe were the people that are the
[45:20] recipients of this book this is the hour
[45:23] that the word has come to not just a
[45:26] partial restoration we are not just in a
[45:28] partial deliverance but he's bringing a
[45:31] total deliverance and we're living in
[45:33] our that we have come to know that the
[45:36] completeness of the word it's coming to
[45:38] a full restoration and now it's embodied
[45:41] in a living group of people who is
[45:43] standing where no other age has ever
[45:45] been able to stand I know you we're
[45:49] standing at a time oh my where no other
[45:51] people's been able to see and look upon
[45:54] what you and I have been blessed to look
[45:56] upon and we're not just any people we're
[45:59] not just another group or not just
[46:01] another church but I want to say this
[46:03] we're not just another Gentiles we're
[46:06] elected Jintao's not just any jintao but
[46:10] I'll say we are those who has been
[46:12] elected we are those who are being
[46:14] called by Almighty God we are those who
[46:16] are predestinated we are those who are
[46:20] chosen by God I challenge you to believe
[46:23] that today oh we are those people who
[46:26] was all caught up in the grip of
[46:29] denomination and organization but we are
[46:31] those Gentiles who heard the voice of
[46:34] the seventh angel we've been called out
[46:38] of Laodicea we've been called out the
[46:40] darkness in this hour we be called out
[46:43] all kinds of creeds and dogmas and we've
[46:45] coming in to the fresh kill the man of
[46:47] the word of God's OMA we've been called
[46:51] out of every system from every walk of
[46:53] life and we know that we are not just
[46:56] people we are the allotted Gentiles that
[46:59] has come down now at the climax of the
[47:03] seven ages all glory and we are the last
[47:06] Jin
[47:06] we are not just chit toss it's a special
[47:09] group it's a special people living in a
[47:12] special hour a supernatural time where
[47:15] God's going to move in a supernatural
[47:17] way on a supernatural Church given her
[47:21] supernatural power to overcome the wiles
[47:24] of the devil in this hour oh we're the
[47:26] last Gentiles who's going to hear from
[47:29] God like no other age he's been able to
[47:32] hear from God
[47:33] Oh notice in the scripture he'll that
[47:36] the scripture says these are mighty men

[47:44] are mighty Gentile warriors

[48:20] revelation of the hour where the
[48:22] Gentiles who's standing here believing
[48:24] the Word of God for this day all the

[50:51] anointing was upon that king and they
[50:53] know that kidding though it looked like

[50:58] time of impossibility that he had a
[51:00] special revelation that David was gonna
[51:03] be crowned king

[52:33] would be set apart think about it the
[52:36] scripture intent in it the scripture on
[52:39] purpose sets these men apart and calls
[52:42] them mighty men men that the word would
[52:47] exalt to such a place such a position no
[52:50] glory to God all God's not just gonna
[52:53] have people in this hour he's gonna have
[52:55] mighty people not just a church he's
[52:59] gonna have a mighty church I'd rather

[53:04] Church that came Harley yet for one day
[53:06] to the next he's gonna have some
[53:07] victorious people he's gonna have some
[53:09] overcoming people he's gonna have some
[53:11] people's when I take that word and they
[53:13] gonna go to the enemy's camp show me and
[53:16] we'll go the enemy's camp mighty people
[53:20] for the scripture says that were a
[53:22] chosen people
[53:23] you believe that Oh first Peter says it
[53:27] like this concerning you and I that you
[53:28] are a chosen generation you're a royal
[53:31] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[53:32] people that you should show forth the
[53:35] praises of him who has called you out of
[53:37] darkness into his marvelous light which
[53:41] in
[53:41] times past we weren't a lot of people
[53:43] but we are now the people of God which
[53:48] obtain mercy
[53:49] oh my which had not obtained mercy but
[53:51] now have obtained mercy he noticed Peter
[53:54] says we're a chosen people which means
[53:57] we are elected were chosen by God to
[53:59] obtain salvation across we are
[54:01] Christians that's chosen or elect the
[54:03] Messiah in called the elect we are being
[54:06] appointed by God to the most exalted
[54:08] office conceivable not just a reform age
[54:14] not in the later Reformation but the
[54:17] people whose been restored back through
[54:19] the original world
[54:20] back to the original see what he has the
[54:23] original seed a spoken word is the
[54:25] original seed and will restored back to
[54:28] that original it means the best of its
[54:33] kind of class applied to certain
[54:35] individual Christians however yes
[54:39] oh he's calling us today we've been
[54:42] hand-picked for this day
[54:44] I've been hand-picked for this moment
[54:46] I've been called for this hour I've been
[54:48] called to living this day I couldn't
[54:51] have lived any the other day he saw me
[54:53] overcoming in this age he saw you
[54:56] victorious he saw you triumph over the
[54:59] enemy in this age can you handle that
[55:03] today bring your hand I'll be calling
[55:05] you that you're a chosen people not only
[55:08] are you a priesthood you're I of
[55:10] priesthood
[55:16] how can Gentiles which had no covenant
[55:23] with God a people that was not even
[55:27] worthy of the gospel all right how can
[55:30] the people in know rise but no covenant
[55:33] with God
[55:34] how can they be called and exalted so
[55:38] high it's because of not who I am it's
[55:42] who I've always was
[55:47] because who I am sometimes differs and
[55:50] it looks different from who I always was
[55:54] hallelujah somebody that's why we
[55:57] disagree with nearly every denomination
[55:59] they say that when the rapture takes
[56:01] place you're getting the body of the
[56:02] future but only in this hour did a
[56:05] prophet come and say you're not getting
[56:07] a body in the future you're getting a
[56:09] body down with some a eternal in the
[56:11] heavens but they don't you see we're
[56:13] standing where no other hour has been
[56:16] able to see the revelation that you and
[56:18] I see in this hour pull through the word
[56:25] we found our place by the word we found
[56:29] our position hey man the watch because
[56:32] the scripture said which in tongues pass
[56:34] we were not of people but are now the
[56:37] people of God which have attained which
[56:39] not obtained mercy but now have obtained
[56:41] mercy in times past we were neither
[56:44] people come on somebody but we are now
[56:47] the people of God that means for this
[56:49] present occasion God has chosen us for
[56:53] this time right here these men these men
[56:59] of David are oh my these men for him
[57:03] touch them as Gentiles that has come
[57:09] under the king's command he touched them
[57:12] according to scripture it's me in that
[57:15] head follow David all the way to the end
[57:18] flourish but I begin to think where did
[57:23] these men come from to be able to come
[57:27] to this place and to to find that just
[57:32] follow me there's been a transition of
[57:34] power and there's being a prophet that
[57:38] has anointed a man to come to a position
[57:42] that is greater than man's choice which
[57:46] was sold for lunch but we move past
[57:51] man's choice and we come to God's choice
[57:57] where are these men come from that that
[58:00] they're not under the administration of
[58:03] solve but they are chosen means who
[58:09] plans to serve underneath David Bible
[58:13] says it like this what's very closely
[58:15] and subversive no twenty two and one and
[58:18] David therefore deport advance and
[58:20] escape to the cave of a deulim and when
[58:23] his brother and all his father's house
[58:25] heard it they went down there to him and
[58:29] when his brethren
[58:31] lauric with his brethren and all his
[58:35] father's house heard it they went down
[58:37] to him and everyone now watch these men
[58:41] and every one of them what that was in
[58:45] distress everyone that was in debt
[58:50] everyone that was discontented power to
[58:55] God gathered themselves together and he
[58:58] became a captain over them and there
[59:00] were with him about four hundred men
[59:03] look at these men that starts following
[59:06] David they was men of distress they was
[59:11] mere that was bound with a debt that
[59:14] they could not pay come on somebody they
[59:18] was me and that was discontinued all
[59:20] don't you see the picture today that
[59:22] sounds like you and I people that was
[59:25] under distress people who was in bondage
[59:27] and in debt of debt we could not pay but
[59:31] we started following David and by the
[59:35] time David got down with them they were
[59:37] familiar death to male-male as our fight
[59:47] will get from sissies to Mali men
[59:50] hallelujah stay away from me with
[59:52] pressures and debts and sickness and
[59:54] disease though in David got done with
[59:56] them they was my team and my Legion
[59:58] towers hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:07] well you think about that you started
[1:00:10] out as a sinner in debt then with all
[1:00:12] kinds of sin bound with all kinds of
[1:00:14] doubts all kinds of unbelief but after
[1:00:17] Jesus got a hold of Hugh and because
[1:00:20] he's got a power to transform I said
[1:00:25] he's got a power of transformation he
[1:00:29] can transform you from an old Gentile
[1:00:31] any man dressed in rags to the Queen of
[1:00:34] Heaven the queen of Almighty God
[1:00:37] any man somebody all you and I the way I
[1:00:39] started he's not the way I'm gonna
[1:00:42] finish way I started in this thing it
[1:00:48] away were finishing I started out just
[1:00:50] for no sorry Gentile when I got done I
[1:00:53] was a mighty gym towel warrior another
[1:00:55] whenever I got to hanging around David a
[1:00:57] man I got to see in the anointing that
[1:00:59] was so fun David how David could stay a
[1:01:01] hell David Correia how David could Mars
[1:01:04] how David could fine I got some of that
[1:01:06] of northern over on me they begin to
[1:01:08] transform me into a mighty warrior for
[1:01:10] God for Peter said which in times past
[1:01:19] were not a people but are now the people
[1:01:21] of God which whole list of this now I
[1:01:25] have obtained mercy I don't know about
[1:01:27] you that makes me feel good because I
[1:01:30] obtained mercy I said it was mercy that
[1:01:33] changed my life it was mercy that
[1:01:35] rewrote my life it was grace that picked
[1:01:38] me up it was grace that transformed me
[1:01:40] and brought me to what he called me to
[1:01:42] be grace picked me up and carried me
[1:01:44] back to what I was called to me Paul
[1:01:49] says like this in Ephesians worn
[1:01:50] according as he's chosen us in him
[1:01:53] before the foundation of world and we
[1:01:56] should be wholly without blame before
[1:01:57] him in love having predestinated us unto
[1:02:00] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:02:01] to the good pleasures of his will of his
[1:02:07] will
[1:02:07] it wasn't my will when your will write
[1:02:09] the pastor's will it was God's will for
[1:02:12] you to come to this don't you see it was
[1:02:14] God's will and David would have somebody
[1:02:16] Jintao warriors
[1:02:17] was God's will that done it to the
[1:02:22] praise of the glory of His grace this of
[1:02:25] this wherein he has made me made me I
[1:02:32] wasn't acceptable but he made me
[1:02:35] acceptable talk about a power
[1:02:38] transformation
[1:02:40] I was not acceptable he magic forward to
[1:02:42] God through Christ he made me because of
[1:02:46] his grace because of his mercy and we
[1:02:49] have obtained his Trent house we was not
[1:02:51] a worthy people but he made us worthy to
[1:02:53] serving where is he made us sit in the
[1:02:59] beloved the word made means to be highly
[1:03:02] favored to make accepted to make not
[1:03:06] that she was to make graceful he wasn't
[1:03:10] lovely un charming you ain't even
[1:03:12] agreeable you couldn't even agree with
[1:03:16] yourself
[1:03:21] thank you lord that's a given right
[1:03:23] there
[1:03:24] hey man the worst argument you'll ever
[1:03:26] have is with yourself cuz you never
[1:03:28] gonna win hey man we was in love link
[1:03:33] all right
[1:03:34] calmly punch oh my think about it
[1:03:37] Freitas we was not agreeable but he made
[1:03:40] me agreeable what had God had to do for
[1:03:45] us he had to pursue with grace he can
[1:03:48] past me with his favor to honor me with
[1:03:51] his blessings
[1:03:52] oh he transformed us I don't know about
[1:03:56] you but he I wasn't graceful but he made
[1:03:58] me in for this then Paul picks it up
[1:04:01] like this and in chapter 2 of Ephesians
[1:04:03] and you hath he quickened who was dead
[1:04:05] in trespasses and sins
[1:04:07] where in times past he walked according
[1:04:09] to the rest of this world
[1:04:11] I meant somebody according to the Prince
[1:04:13] of the power of air the spirit now
[1:04:15] worketh in the children disobedience he
[1:04:17] was not the children of disobedience but
[1:04:20] at one time we was disobedient children
[1:04:27] among among whom also we all had our
[1:04:32] conversation times past
[1:04:34] did you see if this was you lust of the
[1:04:36] flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:04:38] flesh from the mind and worry about not
[1:04:40] by seat now but by nature by seed I was
[1:04:45] elected by seeing I was predestinated
[1:04:48] that seed I was chosen I God but my
[1:04:50] nature I had the same nature when I come
[1:04:53] to this world just like you did our
[1:04:54] nature was to children last here's the
[1:05:00] difference but he's a God who is rich in
[1:05:03] mercy oh he can be rich in a lot of
[1:05:06] things he's not just rich in monetary
[1:05:08] things but when it comes to notice when
[1:05:11] David begins to describe God he said
[1:05:13] he's a God who is rich in mercy for his
[1:05:15] great love wherewith he loved us even so
[1:05:19] when we were dead in sins he's quickened
[1:05:21] us who and has quickened us together
[1:05:24] with Christ by grace are saved and he's
[1:05:28] raised us up together and made us to sit
[1:05:32] together
[1:05:33] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:05:36] that's my position but the RAM said my
[1:05:39] position is in Christ he has quickened
[1:05:42] me he has raised me he has made me he's
[1:05:45] accepted me I've been accepted in the
[1:05:48] beloved because of what he's done for me
[1:05:50] oh my here David has some men and the
[1:05:55] scripture depicts to us is the Prophet
[1:05:57] brings this thought to us and he says I
[1:06:00] want you to notice now the Bible tells
[1:06:03] us it was the time of harvest when these
[1:06:08] Gentiles was following David the Bible
[1:06:12] says in second same for 23:13 and three
[1:06:15] of the thirty chief went down and came
[1:06:18] to David in the harvest town
[1:06:23] so here during the harvest three
[1:06:27] warriors come to David these Gentile
[1:06:30] Warriors they had just been sitting
[1:06:33] around now they ain't just been just
[1:06:36] waiting for what happens but if this for
[1:06:38] the scripture they had been fighting and
[1:06:41] the scripture tells us and gives us the
[1:06:44] synopsis of what these men had been
[1:06:46] doing and I want to tell you they've
[1:06:48] been fighting some things but not only
[1:06:51] had they been fighting
[1:06:53] they've been overcoming but remember
[1:06:57] says like this make eternal life and
[1:06:59] during this time be a fugitive from his
[1:07:03] people talk about David he picked up
[1:07:05] many gallons Jintao's and one of them
[1:07:08] one of them killed 800 men one day with
[1:07:11] a spirit of sword another one jumped
[1:07:13] into a pit killed a lion on a snowy day
[1:07:16] and they was gathering the little which
[1:07:19] was being for peace something like that
[1:07:20] and all them run away and he stood and
[1:07:25] he stood when everybody else during the
[1:07:30] harvest time what's turning away

[1:10:59] that event of david's mighty men and
[1:11:02] brings that top right down to this hour
[1:11:05] hey man now watch David had been
[1:11:09] anointed as the king in Bethlehem and
[1:11:14] Bethlehem is the house all right it's
[1:11:21] the house of God spread pellets you're
[1:11:27] gonna feed from the bran of God you got
[1:11:31] to do it in Bethlehem so fitting it's
[1:11:37] the bread of Bethlehem oh my can you
[1:11:40] imagine why had to be why little bit
[1:11:43] Levin says why why I don't know
[1:11:45] Bethlehem his brother said that was the
[1:11:48] bread place of the world and what a
[1:11:50] better fitting place could it be that in
[1:11:53] Bethlehem was born David's son which was
[1:11:55] Jesus Christ which was the house of
[1:11:57] God's bread for jesus said take my body
[1:12:00] for in his bread eat of it Jesus is the
[1:12:07] bread sinner of the elbe world
[1:12:08] hey man somebody and here David being
[1:12:13] God's anointed did not come to be
[1:12:16] crowned king but was anointed king watch
[1:12:19] now that he brought this time where he
[1:12:22] had been driven out because of the
[1:12:26] jealousy among his churches his brethren
[1:12:29] a man somebody and because of jealousy
[1:12:33] David had become Bodrum uses this
[1:12:36] terminology if you look it up David had
[1:12:38] become a fugitive to his own place he
[1:12:41] was fugitive from his own town ohhohh he
[1:12:45] was a fugitive from his own family a
[1:12:47] fugitive from his own brad ina Forman
[1:12:51] Bethlehem Norton in Bethlehem
[1:12:55] but now he's a fugitive from Bethlehem
[1:12:57] and brother Graham tells us that like
[1:12:58] this and there's a main concern a lot
[1:13:00] they're topping David which was a
[1:13:02] fugitive at the time of the
[1:13:04] excommunicating from his people he was
[1:13:06] turned out and Bethlehem was besieged
[1:13:09] and the Philistines was garrisoned
[1:13:12] around Bethlehem again he says what time
[1:13:15] are we living in all of this quote what
[1:13:17] time are we living in
[1:13:18] what's the sign that God said he would
[1:13:20] show last before it come to pass what
[1:13:23] was the things he said here's real whole
[1:13:25] listen now watch him now tell him if a
[1:13:27] fig tree in Israel how that when Jesus
[1:13:29] said when you see the fig tree putting
[1:13:30] forth its buds you know that summer is
[1:13:32] nigh and a summer is a type of the
[1:13:34] rapture and he's letting you know and
[1:13:36] you see that season when you see that
[1:13:38] hour when you see Israel getting ready
[1:13:40] the rapture is at hand
[1:13:44] he says what time we live in him what
[1:13:48] was the things he said Israel in her
[1:13:50] place over Endor the fake tree restoring
[1:13:52] its or so back again look everything
[1:13:55] just exactly sitting in line brother you
[1:13:59] may think things is just a mess and
[1:14:01] everything's out line I differ from me
[1:14:03] it's exactly in line ma'am and this
[1:14:07] message I was listening to this morning
[1:14:09] about him said Omaha notice it's setting
[1:14:12] itself in line and Burrell said here
[1:14:14] David was he was anointed king of Aram
[1:14:16] says who cares who becomes presidents we
[1:14:19] know who the king is
[1:14:23] but what's it matter who gets it if you
[1:14:27] get the king just let me add the king
[1:14:33] look at everything just exactly sitting
[1:14:36] in line oh my it almost sounds prophetic
[1:14:39] this morning setting a line of the
[1:14:41] church the church and the layout of see
[1:14:43] a condition Jesus on the outside of
[1:14:46] fugitive to his own church just as David
[1:14:49] was up at Bethlehem a fugitive from his
[1:14:52] own people a fugitive and cross the
[1:14:55] Bible sin the last days was a fugitive
[1:14:59] to his own people
[1:15:02] they're in Revelation in the third
[1:15:04] chapter let's see age that we're living
[1:15:06] in cross is on the outside knocking over
[1:15:08] em sez trying to get in a fugitive to
[1:15:12] his own people but these men didn't see
[1:15:17] fugitive these men could only see the
[1:15:20] revelation of Kings that's the
[1:15:24] difference maker
[1:15:25] they knew David was coming into power
[1:15:28] one day and they chose to stand with
[1:15:32] David even though they'd have to stand
[1:15:34] alone sometimes preach until you now
[1:15:38] come on somebody they know they have to
[1:15:40] stand by themselves sometimes yeah
[1:15:43] they're gonna be looked at strange
[1:15:45] sometimes but they're standing by David
[1:15:48] even though it looked as if David had
[1:15:53] been defeated and it looked like the
[1:15:58] world was going to take over and it
[1:16:00] looked like Satan was gonna be
[1:16:02] victorious it looked like David was
[1:16:04] gonna be overcome but even though no
[1:16:07] matter what it looked like even though
[1:16:10] every circumstance was against them they
[1:16:14] chose the stand beside David it was
[1:16:22] during that time of the harvest it was
[1:16:25] during that time of wars and rumors of
[1:16:29] wars
[1:16:31] it was during that time that David had a
[1:16:35] desire in his heart oh what's where it
[1:16:38] comes in now and they were so close to
[1:16:41] David these men was so in tune with
[1:16:46] David oh how can I say it to make you
[1:16:49] see it they become so long with the word
[1:16:54] of the hour they become anointed with
[1:16:59] his desire
[1:17:03] or to God even though there was a great
[1:17:07] challenge before the hill they didn't
[1:17:09] care how big the challenge was they was
[1:17:11] only interested in fulfilling the Kings
[1:17:15] desire River says a perfect picture of
[1:17:20] revelation three brilliant said cross on
[1:17:23] the outside force in relations 320
[1:17:25] behold I says the door knock If any man
[1:17:27] hear my voice and open the door I'll
[1:17:29] come in to him and will sup with him and
[1:17:30] he with me what he's saying is if the
[1:17:33] door becomes open I'll have communion
[1:17:35] with you the king was designed for a
[1:17:42] time of communion Oh God
[1:17:45] just like his he did with Abraham half
[1:17:48] to the battle after the battle he had
[1:17:53] communion with Abraham I feel the Holy
[1:17:57] Spirit I said the last thing that Elohim
[1:18:01] did with Abraham was he had communion
[1:18:04] but that we are living in the hour of
[1:18:06] the repeating of the Son of man ministry
[1:18:09] what has come to life in this hour I can
[1:18:13] prove that to you by your Bible what's
[1:18:15] the last thing that Elohim did with
[1:18:17] Abraham had communion what's the last
[1:18:20] thing Jesus did with his disciples had
[1:18:23] communion what's the last sermon for the
[1:18:25] Wrentham preached Jesus Christ is the
[1:18:31] same yesterday today and forever
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:35] we commune with the king because we want
[1:18:39] to know his desires
[1:18:46] Judith she's telling us on his own
[1:18:49] church Oh or one time David would be
[1:18:54] welcome he's been set outside
[1:18:56] and besides heaven David they took it in
[1:18:59] Creed's they've taken in dogmas they've
[1:19:02] got church programs they got men
[1:19:05] standing in the place of God
[1:19:08] I'm preaching somebody I'm told matter
[1:19:10] in this hour right now and I want to say
[1:19:12] this because they have accepted
[1:19:14] something else
[1:19:15] they made him a fugitive from his own
[1:19:17] church I may get tough for a minute but
[1:19:21] hang on somebody he's a fugitive from
[1:19:24] his own people instead of drinking from
[1:19:26] the well of Bethlehem they've turned
[1:19:29] what I've said to some stagnated cistern
[1:19:32] of yesterday a man some a water of days
[1:19:36] gone by they refuse the water from the
[1:19:39] well of Bethlehem a man they won't

[1:22:50] wanted to hear it they wanted to sign
[1:22:52] the hand whoa but that was only bait on
[1:22:57] the hook
[1:22:57] brother em said that was only something
[1:23:00] to attract the people's attention but it
[1:23:02] wasn't a tension to try to get them just
[1:23:04] to recognize what God can do in a great
[1:23:06] way but they was trying to get them to
[1:23:08] recognize the David the ministry the son
[1:23:10] of man was standing in our midst and the
[1:23:15] Pentecostals rejected the message of the
[1:23:17] hour
[1:23:18] oh how they loved him under son of God
[1:23:24] they loved him under ministry of son of
[1:23:26] God
[1:23:27] they loved the break of the bread but
[1:23:29] when he moved when the seven seals come
[1:23:31] open and he moves from Son of God
[1:23:33] ministry to the Son of man ministry and
[1:23:35] Christ begin to unveil himself and let
[1:23:38] his mister become known that's when they
[1:23:40] rejected him better in preach the
[1:23:45] message present stage of my ministry oh
[1:23:48] man he tells us through the message how
[1:23:51] that the shuck has pulled back my
[1:23:54] brother the shucks has pulled back it's
[1:23:57] got a reveal something who's a girl
[1:24:01] reveal some Gentile lawyers some
[1:24:05] Gentiles who's gonna stand some Gentiles
[1:24:07] he's gonna believe brother him said the
[1:24:10] only thing I know that the we has to do
[1:24:12] he said that wheats gotta lay in the
[1:24:14] presence of the Sun to wrap it into
[1:24:15] mature hey man
[1:24:17] and now here comes David during the time
[1:24:19] of the harvest and these Gentile
[1:24:21] Warriors are now they're coming to David
[1:24:23] and while his ministry had been rejected
[1:24:25] they hear David say something what's the
[1:24:31] timing after the rejecting of the word
[1:24:34] of God for this day David begins to
[1:24:37] express something that he hadn't
[1:24:40] expressed before but no God now that
[1:24:43] he's coming to the climax he's coming to
[1:24:46] the Paramount of his ministry now he
[1:24:48] begins to say something and breathe
[1:24:50] something for his lives he hasn't said
[1:24:53] before never drink
[1:24:57] I could just have a drink
[1:25:01] I remember brother Graham says at that
[1:25:04] point right there is where David wrote
[1:25:07] Psalms 42 as the deer pants for the
[1:25:11] water so does my soul
[1:25:18] brother Vance it was and David was at
[1:25:20] the cape of a deulim it's where he
[1:25:22] writes Psalms forty to watch after the
[1:25:25] word had been rejected now his soul is
[1:25:28] calling out for something the word was
[1:25:33] calling for the word now he's looking
[1:25:40] for revelation to match his revelation
[1:25:46] fed up with those old waters
[1:25:49] stagnation but all and the point of
[1:25:53] harvest time verbum says the Sun was
[1:25:57] shining real hot down on David because
[1:26:02] that's when the week begins to mature is
[1:26:04] when the Sun begins the Sun and it was
[1:26:07] during that season during that time that
[1:26:09] David began to remember how God
[1:26:12] hallelujah Dave had begin to remember oh
[1:26:15] god somebody help me he begin to
[1:26:18] remember the water and they begin to
[1:26:19] remember there's something promise for
[1:26:21] this day he begins to remember there's
[1:26:23] somebody who's gonna stand he begins to
[1:26:25] remember the water from the well of
[1:26:27] Bethlehem when the tassel and the shucks
[1:26:33] was drying up David began to remember
[1:26:36] him he don't want just any water he
[1:26:41] wants a water that can match the thirst
[1:26:43] whoo God he was a water that can match
[1:26:46] the the Stars the desire the longing of
[1:26:49] his soul he wants a soul to match his
[1:26:52] soul he wants a people who's hungry for
[1:26:55] the revelation of God's words he's
[1:26:58] wanting some of that original water but
[1:27:01] the problem was he wasn't gonna be easy
[1:27:05] now let me preach to you now it ain't
[1:27:07] gonna be easy
[1:27:09] yeah you're gonna fight some batters
[1:27:11] you're gonna go through some stuff they
[1:27:13] were some Philistines that was blocking
[1:27:15] the well can I preach this it was during
[1:27:20] the time of the harvest that the enemy
[1:27:23] was coming against them the greatest
[1:27:26] come on somebody under the breaking of
[1:27:29] the seals there's been a supernatural
[1:27:31] demons released and now they're standing
[1:27:34] between you and the whale 100 the
[1:27:39] minister the rejection of the word hood
[1:27:41] Christ has been put outside the church
[1:27:42] yes when Gentile orders begin a raise up
[1:27:45] I said there's a New Testament church
[1:27:48] it's rising up for the Redman want a
[1:27:52] little Bethlehem well hurry
[1:27:54] he said if I only had a drink listen to
[1:27:56] this inside of him cried out what
[1:28:01] programs say this mystery was as the
[1:28:03] mystery that was hidden his heart
[1:28:04] all right and from his being he begin to
[1:28:10] cry out if I could only drink once more
[1:28:13] from that well at Bethlehem listen this
[1:28:15] statement this is why priestess his
[1:28:17] desire was a commandment to those who
[1:28:22] loved
[1:28:30] it's not just a social religion not some
[1:28:33] social gospel they come around but when
[1:28:36] they heard him say this from his being
[1:28:38] his dessert just his desire his side his
[1:28:42] desire if I could just have a drink they
[1:28:45] heard him they heard that revelation and
[1:28:48] something stuck inside of them if the
[1:28:54] king wants the king go get what his
[1:28:59] desire is it's me come on it's our is
[1:29:05] it's our was a commitment to those who
[1:29:06] loved him remember his soul was crying
[1:29:08] for a drink of water his cell was and
[1:29:11] those who loved him his least his desire
[1:29:13] was a command again why a little bit
[1:29:16] lehem 63 David here's a type of Christ
[1:29:18] in Bethlehem because christ is david's
[1:29:20] son this and david's crying for drinking
[1:29:23] water desire was a command i said to
[1:29:25] those who loved him three of those men
[1:29:27] watch this the first thing that happens
[1:29:29] under the ministry the son of man during
[1:29:32] the time of the harvest when the shucks
[1:29:34] is pulled away here is some gentiles
[1:29:36] that here's the desire David's heart and
[1:29:38] when he decides what he wants they pull
[1:29:41] the sword first pull and second pull has
[1:29:48] went by come on somebody and now the
[1:29:51] Kings sword has come down into the hands
[1:29:55] come on church under the ministry the
[1:29:58] sentiment the anointing is fell and when
[1:30:02] they see him desiring this they pulled
[1:30:05] the swords
[1:30:08] those men pulled their swords and fought
[1:30:11] 15 miles of men down to that city watch
[1:30:14] while others fought keeping them or
[1:30:18] gallant fighting men those Philistines
[1:30:22] twice their size some of them but it was
[1:30:26] during that time the King had a desire
[1:30:30] in a time where it looked impossible
[1:30:33] there's no way that anybody's ever gonna
[1:30:36] have a rapture it's impossible that
[1:30:39] anybody's gonna leave here like this but
[1:30:41] where there was impossibility with man
[1:30:43] there's impossibility with God where it
[1:30:46] looks like their circumstances bucking
[1:30:48] the way a man
[1:30:49] there's no circumstance considered when
[1:30:51] it comes to God told rogram said oh
[1:30:56] during this time they were sold one with
[1:31:02] the king it become a personal ambition
[1:31:05] to fulfill the Kings desire a man church

[1:36:15] with a message I'm fighting with water
[1:36:18] man and I'm making sure there's not one
[1:36:23] drop of water
[1:36:27] they'll miss it now
[1:36:29] not one revelation is gonna fall short
[1:36:32] not one manifestations gonna be left
[1:36:35] void I'm not spilling one drop of this
[1:36:38] word I'm not stopping for nothing I
[1:36:41] don't care if they march against this by
[1:36:43] thousands we're not stopping I've got
[1:36:45] the Kings desire who you we've got the
[1:36:56] water which means we're packing the
[1:36:59] revival of the king I've got the Kings
[1:37:03] revival in me all the Pentecostals they
[1:37:06] thought they had a revival but the real
[1:37:08] revival when you want to come to the
[1:37:09] Pentecostals the real revival was gonna
[1:37:11] come through David's money man my agent
[1:37:13] towers him seven thunders was going to
[1:37:18] awaken the Gentile warriors to the real
[1:37:20] revival hallelujah what is the real
[1:37:23] revival it's the bride's revival it's
[1:37:27] the revival of fulfillment
[1:37:28] it's the revival her manifestation hey
[1:37:31] mana story Bible the King has been
[1:37:33] looking for it and longed for
[1:37:35] it's the revelation he's desired to make
[1:37:37] his desires down to a people how does he
[1:37:42] know how good this water is because he's
[1:37:46] drank it before and what he drank under
[1:37:52] the Alpha
[1:37:57] come on somehow he's designed for the
[1:38:01] manifestation under the Omega how can
[1:38:06] these men how convenes me and overcome
[1:38:09] when the odds is so great against them
[1:38:11] when it looks like men there's no way
[1:38:13] and Satan is bringing every gun that he
[1:38:15] has and he's pointing and holding
[1:38:17] against you how can we overcome because
[1:38:20] I'm know what the Kings desire they had
[1:38:24] a revelation within them that they was
[1:38:26] an invincible army I could read the
[1:38:32] quote to you but they was an invincible
[1:38:33] army they had a revelation that the king
[1:38:35] was coming into power and they was
[1:38:38] anointed with that desire so therefore
[1:38:40] they're anointed with the spirit of the
[1:38:41] King and they've seen David fight and if
[1:38:44] he overcome I can overcome
[1:38:46] he conquered I can conquer they're
[1:38:50] fighting don't you see that's why we've
[1:38:53] recognized this day that's the reason
[1:38:55] revelation is stuck in our hearts
[1:38:56] because we've seen our day we've seen
[1:38:58] our message and we've been anointed in
[1:39:00] this moment of time I believe this and
[1:39:03] we don't care how many enemy stands in
[1:39:04] the way we might as well give the devil
[1:39:06] fair warning nothing's gonna stop me
[1:39:08] from bringing my desire back to me we're
[1:39:14] under the ministry think about it we're
[1:39:16] under the ministry that the sword has
[1:39:18] been given amen church and the only
[1:39:22] reason I know you got a sword is because
[1:39:23] you're gonna have to do some fighting
[1:39:25] and when this message kind of underneath
[1:39:27] the third pull and revealed it to you
[1:39:28] and I let me tell you that message that
[1:39:30] went to get the rainbow trout it's
[1:39:32] because we're going to stand and fight
[1:39:35] all this of this I love this quote
[1:39:39] listen to the statements because because
[1:39:42] although Jesus swallowed a Bethlehem
[1:39:43] because although Jesus from Bethlehem is
[1:39:46] the bread of life
[1:39:47] he's also the water of life
[1:39:51] cooler to God their pack and Christ
[1:39:56] they're pack and Christ he's the water
[1:40:00] life sure he is and what did he do
[1:40:01] Oh God he was represented in both David
[1:40:05] and warriors really really think about
[1:40:19] it he's not just my presented in David
[1:40:22] that's Wang he's represented in every
[1:40:25] Gentile warrior who's packed in that
[1:40:28] water that revelation Christ back to the
[1:40:31] original place he's represented in both
[1:40:38] David and warders plural warriors
[1:40:43] because he was the king and he was the
[1:40:46] warrior who came and broke through the
[1:40:48] enemy's lines oh my but there's some men
[1:40:52] know that he was coming King Revelation
[1:40:54] chapter 4 but rim says they stayed right
[1:40:57] with him brother I mean you couldn't get
[1:40:59] them away from him as they walked on
[1:41:00] they were warriors and when he come into
[1:41:03] power you know what he done he made each
[1:41:05] one of them a ruler over a certain city
[1:41:09] don't you see Christ there he that
[1:41:13] overcomes shall rule over a city watch
[1:41:15] what he called us the overcomers and
[1:41:19] today when we see that he's coming in
[1:41:20] power Christ is going to rule in this
[1:41:22] world Germany United States he's gonna
[1:41:28] rule in Germany United States and all
[1:41:30] must fall every nation must fall the
[1:41:32] kings of this worlds become the kingdom
[1:41:33] of our God and of his Christ and he
[1:41:35] ruled in reign on them that's why we
[1:41:37] know by revelation we know he's coming
[1:41:40] in power so the least of his desire is a
[1:41:44] command to us
[1:41:48] and then bream screams this out and was
[1:41:50] our musicians come this morning
[1:41:52] well a little better him so rise your
[1:41:57] son's and warriors and let's cut back to
[1:42:01] our original Bethlehem
[1:42:04] remember when David come to song these
[1:42:05] men stood by him because they know David
[1:42:07] was going to be on the throne and
[1:42:11] brother brems said underneath that
[1:42:12] ecclesiastical system under that nickel
[1:42:14] alien spirit he said it went from a
[1:42:16] doctrine from a doctrine it's going to
[1:42:18] become a man and they're gonna crown
[1:42:19] their king but the Antichrist is gonna
[1:42:25] be crowned and he only copies what my
[1:42:27] God does brother Bram says we're gonna
[1:42:30] crayon here man
[1:42:33] we're gonna crown him king of all kings
[1:42:37] and Lord of all they understand our feet
[1:42:43] this morning god bless you oh he says
[1:42:46] and God's gifts always found their place
[1:42:57] he says how the Gentiles today men of
[1:43:00] honor me and raped me and taken the
[1:43:03] sword and standing there cutting her way
[1:43:05] through to get a fresh drink of water
[1:43:07] for Christ our David which is very
[1:43:09] unpopular today but our David which we
[1:43:12] know he's coming in power he's gonna
[1:43:14] every nation under feet like that
[1:43:16] and rule them with a rod of iron and
[1:43:18] real gallant me and standing with the
[1:43:20] Word of God
[1:43:22] chomping from one side to the side
[1:43:25] fearlessly because we know he's coming
[1:43:31] let's borrow hearts
[1:43:35] praise be to God we got a revelation
[1:43:38] he's coming but Evie you don't know the
[1:43:43] trials that we go through I'm telling

[1:43:46] that's okay he's giving you something to
[1:43:48] fight with he's not left you in this
[1:43:50] hour helpless for you ain't got nothing
[1:43:52] to stand with he's giving you his word

[1:43:57] hour and they nothing sharper than his
[1:44:00] words they ain't no enemy to big day no
[1:44:04] problem to great if the Word of God
[1:44:07] can't pierce through every unbelief
[1:44:10] every doubt he can break through it he's
[1:44:13] coming into power the Kings desire I
[1:44:17] trust you've got that revelation today
[1:44:19] during the time of the harvest I've got
[1:44:20] a revelation that I'm gonna take and I'm
[1:44:23] gonna use this word I'm gonna use this
[1:44:25] message and allow it to transform me
[1:44:28] it's already turned me I'm not a sinner
[1:44:30] they transform me from a sinner to a
[1:44:32] saint that quickening power has already
[1:44:34] been at work in my life it's turned me
[1:44:36] from the world and turned me back
[1:44:38] heavenly set my feet in heavenly places
[1:44:40] it's already been at work transforming
[1:44:42] me now but it's an onus anointing us to

[1:46:08] predestinated seat down in there lower
[1:46:10] to God oh and he was knocking on the
[1:46:13] door not because he's trying to become a
