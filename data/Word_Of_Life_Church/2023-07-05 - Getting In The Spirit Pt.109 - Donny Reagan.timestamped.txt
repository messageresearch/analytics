[45:08] praise the Lord
[45:10] praise the Lord
[45:12] thank you Lord Jesus
[45:15] well I don't know about you I'm still
[45:16] rejoicing over the services we had here
[45:19] this weekend
[45:20] what
[45:26] the Lord was so wonderful to us wasn't
[45:28] he
[45:29] this is my 40th year
[45:32] being a pastor
[45:34] 40th year
[45:36] I've hosted a lot of meetings
[45:38] and those Decades of time
[45:41] but I believe
[45:43] I say this without exaggeration that
[45:46] these are the greatest meetings that
[45:49] I've ever hosted in my life
[45:52] oh
[45:55] Lord
[46:00] the preacher Brothers they've done
[46:01] awesome didn't they
[46:03] the singing the specials the music
[46:06] and the deacons is cooperating the food
[46:09] and
[46:10] it was just wonderful I just thought it
[46:11] was I just hoping the Rapture could take
[46:13] place on Monday
[46:16] I didn't want to go back to this
[46:17] everyday stuff
[46:19] you know where you just have to go
[46:21] through all this humdrum of life but I
[46:24] was just so blessed Myself by hearing
[46:27] the word and fellowship with the
[46:28] brothers and I just saw brother Tim who
[46:31] did an outstanding job in the first
[46:32] service and bringing about the
[46:34] dedication and what it awesome
[46:37] and then brother Ron of course and then
[46:39] Brother David I've heard Esther preached
[46:42] since I was knee-high to our grasshopper
[46:44] but I ain't never heard Esther preached
[46:46] like it was preached on Sunday
[46:57] there's only one regret I had about that
[46:59] I wish I'd appreciate it first
[47:04] I was just so blessed
[47:07] of course Brother David was too he was
[47:08] cutting a shine buddy
[47:10] bless his heart he's his Pentecostal as
[47:13] he can be
[47:13] [Applause]
[47:15] and in case y'all are wondering what
[47:18] Pentecostal church he come out of
[47:20] he didn't
[47:23] then in this message his whole life
[47:27] that's what the message will really do
[47:28] for us to get it under the right
[47:30] preacher
[47:30] [Applause]
[47:33] Hallelujah
[47:38] praise the lord we were just so so
[47:40] blessed and I just want to thank
[47:42] everybody again for everything that you
[47:44] did everybody it would have been it
[47:47] would have been utter chaos to try to
[47:48] have such a meeting without the deacons
[47:51] helping and the brothers and the parking
[47:53] and the sisters and preparing the food
[47:56] and then having to leave before service
[47:58] is over and
[47:59] you know you may wonder why we didn't
[48:02] want to have a a meal a full meal on
[48:04] Sunday morning well I preached a bunch
[48:07] of these conventions
[48:08] and I hear what the pastor's wives and
[48:11] the hosting church has to go through
[48:14] getting up three o'clock in the morning
[48:16] trying to fix a meal for everybody
[48:18] having to leave halfway through Sunday
[48:21] morning can't even hear the service and
[48:24] I thought you know what that's a lot to
[48:26] ask for our sisters to have to give up I
[48:29] know we're here to serve and I think we
[48:31] did well
[48:32] I heard it from one after another after
[48:34] another how that people were so blessed
[48:37] to be here and our kindness and so on
[48:39] hey that's what Christians do isn't it
[48:41] but I thought this year no we ain't
[48:43] going to do it on Sunday morning we just
[48:45] let them be able to enjoy the service
[48:46] and be able to get in it's a real shame
[48:48] as I said I mean I'm I'm on the inner
[48:51] circle and hearing the preachers and all
[48:53] that talk about what the church church
[48:55] has to go through and it's really sad
[48:57] when you have a special meeting for the
[48:59] local church and they miss so much
[49:01] because they're serving
[49:04] now some of you may have wondered why
[49:07] why did we need another church
[49:12] I hope this weekend was a great big
[49:15] answer to you
[49:17] we have been robbed
[49:20] we have been robbed
[49:22] for years of being able to have a
[49:25] meeting like we had
[49:27] because we couldn't put nobody anywhere
[49:28] else other than our crowd that we had no
[49:30] parking no chairs no nothing else so any
[49:34] of you that were still griping about it
[49:36] I hope your gripes went out with the
[49:38] shouts
[49:40] thank you
[49:44] praise the Lord
[49:47] now we can have one meeting after the
[49:50] other okay we've got plenty of room to
[49:52] do it God bless you let's turn together
[49:54] tonight
[49:56] well you've had all them great preachers
[49:58] now and all them exciting guys and
[50:02] now you're back with me again so
[50:11] First Corinthians chapter 3
[50:13] verse 11.
[50:18] I love the word don't you I absolutely
[50:20] love it
[50:22] I'm so glad that our shouting and our
[50:24] rejoicing and are jumping and hollering
[50:26] is not based just on enthusiasm
[50:30] and emotion we get enthused God did
[50:35] we didn't know that Masterpiece 1964.
[50:38] God looked at his Masterpiece and God
[50:42] got enthused
[50:45] what he said God got enthused so there's
[50:47] nothing wrong with enthusiasm I won't
[50:49] say it's Enthusiast about the right
[50:50] thing but I'm glad that our enthusiasm
[50:53] and our excitement is based upon the
[50:55] word
[50:56] not just emotion I love to shout with
[50:59] that organ but I can shout just as good
[51:01] without it yeah
[51:03] I love shouting with that piano but I
[51:05] can shout just as good I've got my
[51:07] rhythm built in I've told you all before
[51:09] I'm a black man on the inside
[51:12] [Applause]
[51:15] the music makes it good but I've got to
[51:17] dance without the music
[51:19] wow because I go to wordburst
[51:22] that gives you a dance
[51:23] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11.
[51:26] let's consult again tonight the master
[51:28] builder
[51:29] for other Foundation can no man lathe
[51:32] and that is laid which is Jesus Christ
[51:35] now if any man build upon this
[51:37] Foundation brother Tim read this of
[51:39] course on the first service gold silver
[51:42] precious stones wood hay stubble
[51:47] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[51:49] for the day shall declare it because it
[51:53] shall be revealed by fire the fire shall
[51:56] try every man's work of what sort it is
[52:00] if any man's work abide which he has
[52:03] built thereupon you shall receive
[52:06] rewards if any man's work shall be
[52:09] burned he shall suffer loss but he
[52:14] himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
[52:20] we're going to pray tonight him may not
[52:21] to be remembered
[52:23] we've got a youth camp going up I'm sure
[52:24] many of you know it up in Indiana
[52:26] brother Daryl was there last night
[52:28] tonight and tomorrow night I got a text
[52:30] from him today requesting prayer for him
[52:33] that the Lord would just help him and
[52:35] the Lord will meet there with all those
[52:36] young folks and and meet their needs
[52:38] Erica went to the doctor today and her
[52:42] platelets are at 9 000. normal is a
[52:47] hundred and fifty thousand
[52:50] to
[52:52] 450. thousand
[52:55] hers is nine thousand
[52:59] so brother Donald what does that mean
[53:01] nothing
[53:03] it changes nothing
[53:06] you hear me it changes nothing amen We
[53:11] Believe God's A Healer
[53:14] amen
[53:22] so she texts me today from the doctor's
[53:25] office and and told me my God made the
[53:28] first platelets he'll take care of this
[53:32] so that's what we're believing so if
[53:33] you'd remember her tonight how many has
[53:35] a need a request on your heart God bless
[53:38] you let's just pray together
[53:40] Heavenly Father we thank you so much for
[53:42] your great blessings on each of us as
[53:44] your children Lord we're still just
[53:46] rejoicing from the tremendous Services
[53:48] we had and we're so thankful still see
[53:51] some of the saints that have hung around
[53:54] for a few days to be with us tonight and
[53:56] we're honored to have them with us again
[53:58] Lord and we're just praying that you
[54:00] take your word and speak to us father
[54:02] we're a needy people and you know our
[54:05] desires are to serve you and to please
[54:07] you with all that we are help me to move
[54:10] out of the way tonight with you Lord to
[54:12] be able to speak the words of Life Lord
[54:15] these needs and requests that we've made
[54:17] known to you we just pray that you'll
[54:19] move for every one of them you see Lord
[54:21] Erica set tomorrow to have the infusion
[54:24] of these platelets we know what the
[54:26] doctors are thinking we know what they
[54:28] are saying but Lord we refuse their
[54:31] reports we believe the report of the
[54:35] Lord amen by your stripes she's already
[54:38] been healed Lord these other needs
[54:40] tonight we commit them to you speak to
[54:43] us tonight from your word it's in the
[54:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it
[54:47] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[54:50] you may be seated
[54:52] let's turn also if you would in First
[54:54] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 4. now
[54:57] we've been looking at each of us as the
[55:00] saints of God that we are going to stand
[55:03] before the Lord in the elevated place
[55:05] not the white Throne judgment but the
[55:08] place to where that we will give an
[55:10] account for the Deeds Done in our body
[55:14] God will only require of each of us what
[55:17] God has given to us whatever those gifts
[55:21] and abilities are you'll never be
[55:24] required of what your brother your
[55:26] sister your pastor or some great man is
[55:29] you will only be required of what God
[55:32] gives you now I know that whenever we go
[55:36] to trying to find what does God want me
[55:38] to do so what is my place what is my
[55:41] position and no doubt most of you would
[55:44] probably say with me tonight sometimes
[55:46] that's one of the hardest things you'll
[55:48] ever find in your life it's what God
[55:50] wants you to do and what God wants you
[55:54] to be but you see God does not hang
[55:57] something out before us and let you pick
[55:59] it out and see if that works out for you
[56:01] try it and see if that's it no God
[56:04] doesn't do that but God actually equips
[56:07] us with what he's called us to do now we
[56:11] want to look at the gifts of the Spirit
[56:13] and I know this this is always
[56:14] treacherous when you go this way a lot
[56:17] of folks get nervous but we shouldn't
[56:18] because it's it's God's word First
[56:21] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 4 now there
[56:24] are diversities of gifts and diversities
[56:28] is diverse kinds though there are
[56:31] different kinds of gifts and we can say
[56:35] Amen to that now we saw three great men
[56:38] of God preached Friday Saturday and
[56:41] Sunday all three of them great preachers
[56:43] all three of them approach the word
[56:45] total different way all three of them
[56:48] had a total different delivery a total
[56:51] different way that they'd read the same
[56:53] scriptures and get something totally
[56:56] different out of it why because God
[56:59] diversifies his gifts so every preacher
[57:02] does not preach identical well thank God
[57:05] we wouldn't need but one if they did
[57:07] that one preacher preaching everybody
[57:09] just stream him and all the rest of us
[57:11] preachers just sent out but God
[57:13] Diversified defies the gifts that are in
[57:16] the body God diversifies the ministry
[57:19] the prophet even says it that some men
[57:21] dramatize and some are more like Paul
[57:25] more of a scholarly type some are more
[57:28] of a Firebrand an evangelist comes in
[57:30] all burning up and preaches faith and
[57:33] this and that gets you all fired up get
[57:36] you stirred up get something going
[57:38] inside your gastronomics and my you feel
[57:41] so fired up that way you can come back
[57:44] to church and the pastor can who upon
[57:45] you and you can take it a little bit
[57:47] better than you did before
[57:49] so every man has his own ability by
[57:53] which God gives him now notice Paul uses
[57:56] the words I want you to notice these
[57:58] next three verses how they tie together
[58:00] now they are diversities of gifts but
[58:04] the same spirit so there's different
[58:06] kinds of gifts and there are differences
[58:10] of administration so there's different
[58:14] kinds of gifts and then there are
[58:17] different types of administrations or
[58:21] offices now there are different gifts
[58:24] and there are administrations that will
[58:27] be diverse in the way they come out so
[58:30] even pastors none of them are the same
[58:33] evangelists are none the same teachers
[58:35] are all a little bit different an
[58:37] apostle a missionary so God diversifies
[58:40] each one of them in a way that pleases
[58:44] him now notice verse six and there are
[58:47] diversities of operations so there are
[58:52] diversities of gifts and there are
[58:55] differences of administrations how it
[58:58] will be administered so the office of
[59:01] the pastor for some they may not jump
[59:03] run holler but then there'll be other
[59:06] pastors like Brother David Siler he's a
[59:08] pastor and my goodness he was all across
[59:11] this Pulpit I thought that man was going
[59:13] to shout himself to death at the end of
[59:14] that service didn't you at that chalk
[59:17] statement I thought Lord have mercy I
[59:19] was looking at it last night and that
[59:21] man was back there shouting and running
[59:22] around well you know what but every
[59:25] Pastor don't do that so does that mean
[59:28] brother David's more spiritual a lot of
[59:30] it has to do with how many birthdays
[59:32] you've had as well
[59:34] so he's still a young man so there are
[59:38] differences of the administration's but
[59:40] the same Lord there are diversities of
[59:44] operation but it is the same God which
[59:48] work us all in all now notice how Paul
[59:51] is diversifying before he starts
[59:54] mentioning what the gifts are by name
[59:58] now we believe that God's word is true
[1:00:01] and infallible is that right
[1:00:03] and he believes Paul had the authority
[1:00:05] to write about this
[1:00:07] even though no other rider in the New
[1:00:10] Testament mentions them
[1:00:13] no writer in the Old Testament mentions
[1:00:16] the nine gifts
[1:00:18] amen so you mean you believe this on one
[1:00:23] man's word
[1:00:27] me too
[1:00:30] now what's
[1:00:32] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[1:00:36] given to every man to profit with all
[1:00:40] now this is why God does it God never
[1:00:43] gives us gifts so that we will be lifted
[1:00:48] up and people will adore us and make an
[1:00:51] idol out of us no it's so that God can
[1:00:56] get Glory out of every gift that he puts
[1:00:59] in the body
[1:01:01] now notice here we go to the gifts now
[1:01:04] he's going to name them photo one is
[1:01:07] given by the spirit the word of wisdom
[1:01:12] now when I was a Pentecostal preacher
[1:01:15] and spent those years that I did
[1:01:17] preaching and then a boy preacher and
[1:01:19] then on up till I was in there for
[1:01:22] several years what I found in Pentecost
[1:01:24] was the most sought after gifts was the
[1:01:28] vocal gifts which were tongues
[1:01:31] interpretation and prophecy
[1:01:34] I never run into anybody
[1:01:37] that wanted the gift of the word of
[1:01:40] wisdom
[1:01:41] I want to find amazing and the message
[1:01:43] is you find so few of people that want a
[1:01:46] Word of Wisdom in the message
[1:01:49] or even a word of knowledge
[1:01:53] well I thought we wanted all nine do we
[1:01:57] just want three or two or just certain
[1:02:00] ones isn't isn't this one important too
[1:02:03] you believe it is of course we do four
[1:02:06] to one is given I want you to know who
[1:02:08] gives it now so it's not us going and
[1:02:12] saying now Lord I want this and I want
[1:02:15] that and then Carol says now Lord I want
[1:02:17] this one and then you go and say well I
[1:02:20] want that one and you say I want this
[1:02:21] one that's not the way it comes the
[1:02:24] spirit of God gives it to us
[1:02:27] now we know how brother random taught
[1:02:29] this that actually the spirit of God
[1:02:32] could move on someone and they could
[1:02:34] raise up and speak in tongues and the
[1:02:36] spirit of God move on another one and
[1:02:38] they could interpret and it may never
[1:02:40] fall on them again it may never hit them
[1:02:44] again
[1:02:45] you know he said that right
[1:02:47] but at the same time there are some
[1:02:50] people that get the deposit of these
[1:02:53] gifts and they will have them their
[1:02:55] entire life
[1:02:57] now why does God do it that way you can
[1:02:59] ask him when you see him because I'm not
[1:03:01] really sure four to one is given by the
[1:03:05] spirit the word notice it's not plural
[1:03:08] the word and this word here is logos
[1:03:13] so it is the thought the concept the
[1:03:16] Mandate of God so to one is given the
[1:03:20] logos of wisdom now look at the meaning
[1:03:24] of the word wisdom Sophia
[1:03:27] Supreme intelligence
[1:03:30] such as belongs to God the wisdom of God
[1:03:35] as events informing and executing
[1:03:39] councils in the formation and government
[1:03:42] of the world and the scriptures so here
[1:03:46] is the first spiritual gift
[1:03:49] a word of wisdom so this is not wisdom
[1:03:54] that comes by age this is not wisdom
[1:03:58] that the Bible declared would come when
[1:04:01] a man would have strengths and his
[1:04:03] strength would be his glory when he was
[1:04:05] a young man and his gray hair would be
[1:04:07] his strength and his wisdom when he was
[1:04:09] an old man but this is a word that comes
[1:04:14] from God
[1:04:16] and it is not because well this ancient
[1:04:19] man has had so much experience in this
[1:04:22] aged woman has had so much experience
[1:04:24] and because of that experience then
[1:04:27] they're going to say this word to
[1:04:28] someone about this or that no no you see
[1:04:31] this word could actually come to a 20
[1:04:35] year old man
[1:04:37] hang on everybody or the 20 year old
[1:04:40] woman
[1:04:42] oh goodness gracious alive
[1:04:44] now notice the Bible does not designate
[1:04:48] that these gifts are for men only
[1:04:54] oh dear Jesus help help me Lord
[1:04:57] come on now
[1:04:58] notice Paul does not say now these
[1:05:01] scriptures are only for the brothers
[1:05:04] notice how he identifies this for to one
[1:05:08] is given by the spirit the word of
[1:05:11] wisdom the word of wisdom so what is it
[1:05:15] it is a word that Taps into the Supreme
[1:05:19] wisdom of God I dare say if there's
[1:05:23] anybody here tonight that's been serving
[1:05:26] the lord for very long very many years
[1:05:28] filled with the Holy Ghost and that you
[1:05:30] can recall and if you will think about
[1:05:33] it more than likely there's more people
[1:05:36] here tonight than not who have had this
[1:05:40] to happen to you and you didn't even
[1:05:43] realize what it was
[1:05:46] it was a word it might have been two or
[1:05:50] three or four
[1:05:54] and you were talking to someone or
[1:05:57] someone was in need of something from
[1:06:01] God some counsel and all of a sudden
[1:06:04] something just dropped in your heart it
[1:06:08] was beyond you it was beyond your
[1:06:12] knowing it was beyond your understanding
[1:06:16] and it might not have been but a few
[1:06:19] words but it was divine and it was
[1:06:22] something that come from the Lord and
[1:06:25] the Lord dropped a word of wisdom and
[1:06:28] used you as an individual to encourage
[1:06:31] to uplift to be able to bring media you
[1:06:36] know a great encouragement to someone
[1:06:38] that's down and it come and you spoke it
[1:06:41] and you saw where did that come from I
[1:06:45] didn't even know I knew that you never
[1:06:47] knew it it wasn't like that the resource
[1:06:51] come from within you it was a word of
[1:06:56] wisdom so where does that come from it
[1:06:59] comes from the Eternal but now how many
[1:07:02] folks in the message want this gift
[1:07:07] well now you see this gift may not be
[1:07:10] used in the Pulpit all the time it is
[1:07:13] it is the word of wisdom is used behind
[1:07:16] the pulpit it's used in the office
[1:07:18] counseling people
[1:07:19] it's used in more private type secular
[1:07:23] settings I'm speaking about myself
[1:07:27] when God will drop something down in you
[1:07:29] and you sit there and you Marvel
[1:07:32] yourself Lord have mercy oh my goodness
[1:07:35] and you realize that was not you and
[1:07:39] I'll study friends I study every day of
[1:07:42] my life I study hours on end I study but
[1:07:46] that don't give me wisdom that only
[1:07:49] makes me ready when I stand up here the
[1:07:51] Holy Ghost has got more to anoint
[1:07:54] oh yeah and he can bring it back to your
[1:07:57] memory but whenever This falls upon you
[1:08:00] it's not something that you even learned
[1:08:03] not something that you know God drops
[1:08:07] this on you and it becomes a word of
[1:08:10] wisdom
[1:08:12] praise the Lord
[1:08:14] to another
[1:08:16] the word logos of knowledge now this
[1:08:21] Greek word is Nurses now it means
[1:08:23] knowing but I want you to look at it now
[1:08:25] it's not man again by man memorizing
[1:08:29] scripture man memorizing quotes but
[1:08:31] notice what the word gnosis means the
[1:08:34] deeper more perfect and enlarged
[1:08:38] knowledge of religion
[1:08:40] such as belongs to the more advanced so
[1:08:46] you mean then God would use some for a
[1:08:50] Word of Wisdom others it would be a gift
[1:08:53] now this is one of the nine spiritual
[1:08:56] gifts how many knew this nine spiritual
[1:08:58] gifts so God then so they're not
[1:09:01] speaking in tongues they may not even be
[1:09:04] shouting or jerking or anything like
[1:09:06] that but all of a sudden it's just a
[1:09:09] word of divine Supreme knowledge and
[1:09:12] remember there is no greater Source than
[1:09:15] him now no matter how much we know his
[1:09:18] word we don't know nothing compared to
[1:09:20] him so we limit what God can do through
[1:09:24] us when we say well I can't remember
[1:09:26] that and I don't remember I don't
[1:09:28] remember well the gift is there to to
[1:09:31] say something that you never even
[1:09:33] learned yourself in the first place but
[1:09:36] yet it comes from the Divine source of
[1:09:39] knowledge which is God God himself
[1:09:43] my Lord how many wants to be opened to
[1:09:45] let God use you
[1:09:47] now watch they don't ever say nothing
[1:09:49] contrary to the word
[1:09:51] so to one is by giving the word of
[1:09:54] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[1:09:57] by The Same Spirit now remember only one
[1:10:00] River but yet many gifts coming out of
[1:10:03] that River and that river is the Holy
[1:10:06] Ghost now once Paulie says to another
[1:10:09] face now we know that it's given to
[1:10:12] every man has a Measure of Faith but
[1:10:16] this is not the Saving Face here this is
[1:10:20] not the faith except well I believe God
[1:10:22] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:10:24] begotten son well you'll never be saved
[1:10:26] if you don't believe that but this gift
[1:10:28] right here is not that type of face this
[1:10:32] gift right here was in many men down to
[1:10:36] the ages it was really manifested uh
[1:10:39] back in the restoration but it was in a
[1:10:42] lot of men a man called Jack Cole a man
[1:10:45] called
[1:10:47] different ones that had the gift of
[1:10:50] faith now let me me if you're not
[1:10:52] familiar with Jacko you've heard the
[1:10:53] name of jacco right well this is what
[1:10:55] Jack Cole would do whenever people would
[1:10:58] come up in the prayer line to be prayed
[1:10:59] for every person that come up and had on
[1:11:02] glasses
[1:11:04] Jack Cole had an anvil
[1:11:08] an anvil standing beside his pulpit
[1:11:12] and the first thing he would do is reach
[1:11:15] and grab your glasses off of your face
[1:11:17] and take his hammer and bust your
[1:11:21] glasses
[1:11:24] so you better have faith or you're going
[1:11:26] to go off like this
[1:11:29] if you come up on crutches he would take
[1:11:33] your crutches and burst them to
[1:11:35] splinters
[1:11:37] not actually prayed for you before
[1:11:40] if you were in a wheelchair he would
[1:11:43] disable the wheelchair
[1:11:44] the prophet said he never seen a man
[1:11:47] like him was that what he called Bulldog
[1:11:50] face
[1:11:52] now you're imagining this that that man
[1:11:54] would have scared people to death
[1:11:55] brother REM said there's only one shot
[1:11:57] call God knew the world couldn't handle
[1:11:59] two of them at one time he said now he
[1:12:01] was a very radical type of a God but
[1:12:05] brother random identifying now remember
[1:12:07] Jacob never done any Discerning and Jack
[1:12:10] Cole was not a theologian he was a good
[1:12:13] preacher and of course some videos out
[1:12:14] on YouTube and stuff where he can hear
[1:12:16] him actually you're hearing preaching
[1:12:17] one place and brother Brandon was
[1:12:18] sitting there behind him and you'll
[1:12:20] watch brother Brown and she worships God
[1:12:22] and then he makes an order called
[1:12:23] brother round goes up and prays and
[1:12:25] stuff so that's at the same meeting but
[1:12:27] Jackal was not a theologian he was not a
[1:12:30] prophet but brother Brandon identifies
[1:12:32] Jacko of having the gift of faith now
[1:12:36] watch this most of the ministers who
[1:12:38] preach Divine Healing he says are
[1:12:40] usually all that I have ever met are
[1:12:43] great teachers of the word some of them
[1:12:45] says have a powerful face they lay hands
[1:12:48] on the people and scream out and make
[1:12:52] the enemy leaves them now that's face
[1:12:56] that's a gift of faith
[1:13:00] so a person then could not say now the
[1:13:04] Lord shows me you've got this and the
[1:13:06] Lord shows me you've got that wonder why
[1:13:09] it is that people tend to gravitate more
[1:13:11] toward that type than they do the gift
[1:13:14] of faith or the word of wisdom or the
[1:13:16] word of knowledge
[1:13:19] but I don't find Paul listing them in
[1:13:22] that order which is the greater or which
[1:13:24] is the Lesser but you see the gift to
[1:13:27] Faith is something that is definitely
[1:13:30] going to be more widespread over the
[1:13:32] world than that prophetic gift which is
[1:13:35] only given to a prophet to be able to
[1:13:38] ascend and discern people's hearts
[1:13:41] notice again he said I've seen oral
[1:13:43] praying for a little baby Oral Roberts
[1:13:45] from up in Canada he had a bad eye and I
[1:13:49] believe the parents was Catholic and
[1:13:50] brother Roberts in his real way of Faith
[1:13:53] he slammed his hand down on that little
[1:13:57] baby and prayed for it and the little
[1:13:59] baby was healed now that's a real gift
[1:14:02] of faith that Oral Roberts had yet Oral
[1:14:06] Roberts was a trinitarian or Roberts was
[1:14:09] not a theologian or Roberts we know what
[1:14:12] he wound up being wound up being a
[1:14:14] compromiser basically as it got older
[1:14:16] and older in order to build his
[1:14:18] university and all that sort of Saint he
[1:14:20] was not a prophet he was not a
[1:14:22] Vindicated messenger somebody say Amen
[1:14:26] but yet he did have a gift of faith
[1:14:28] there were thousands times thousands of
[1:14:31] people that were healed in Oral Roberts
[1:14:34] Ministry and he's the one who coined the
[1:14:37] term of making a point of contact when
[1:14:40] people that would have a television or
[1:14:42] radio and they would put their hand for
[1:14:44] it and touch that he's the one that
[1:14:46] coined that term and that had many
[1:14:49] mighty Miracles but did the man discern
[1:14:52] no he was not a prophet so what did he
[1:14:55] use he had a gift of faith well you know
[1:14:58] I believe myself looking at other men
[1:15:01] that we know in the message that there
[1:15:03] are men in the message that have a real
[1:15:06] gift of faith I personally believe
[1:15:08] brother Daryl ward has a great gift of
[1:15:12] faith
[1:15:13] because he prays and he believes and
[1:15:15] he'll encourage you to go on and he'll
[1:15:18] tell the people you send me an email or
[1:15:20] you write me a letter when you're well
[1:15:21] or you'll give them a prayer cloth and
[1:15:23] say use mail this back to me whenever
[1:15:25] you will he's gone about from all over
[1:15:27] the world because he has a real face to
[1:15:31] be able to just smack that devil and the
[1:15:33] devil going down the hill like this he
[1:15:35] don't know what in the world ever hit
[1:15:36] him but why is it that a lot of times
[1:15:39] folks tend to minimize that and think
[1:15:42] that it's not as great as the Lord
[1:15:45] showing somebody well I see this or I
[1:15:48] see that who is it that Diversified that
[1:15:50] gift and made it greater than the gift
[1:15:53] of faith
[1:15:54] anybody answer me I didn't think so
[1:15:58] now watch this when Paul identifies
[1:16:01] Faith now he says to another
[1:16:05] the gifts of healing
[1:16:08] now Faith is singular word is singular
[1:16:12] of wisdom word of knowledge singular but
[1:16:15] when we come to Healing now we have
[1:16:18] gifts
[1:16:19] gifts
[1:16:21] of healing instead of just one gift
[1:16:24] there is no such a thing as the gift of
[1:16:27] healing it is Gifts of healing now watch
[1:16:32] the prophet again said some of those who
[1:16:34] have great faith in healing that's
[1:16:36] called Gifts of healing or gift of
[1:16:39] healing and he says there is no such a
[1:16:42] thing as the gift of healing because
[1:16:45] it's in its plural it's gifts
[1:16:49] so there are Gifts of healing now some
[1:16:52] of you are really going to wrinkle your
[1:16:54] nose at me right here but God might drop
[1:16:56] it in a sister's heart
[1:16:59] to be able to pray for another sister
[1:17:02] and she would have an empathy in her
[1:17:05] soul for that sister maybe more so than
[1:17:08] her brother would
[1:17:10] now does that mean that sister's
[1:17:12] supposed to get her a microphone and
[1:17:13] start having a prayer line in the back
[1:17:15] of the church while I'm having one here
[1:17:17] she'll be set down as she does
[1:17:21] praise the Lord why because God never
[1:17:23] called her to start no prayer line but
[1:17:25] we know from the example the prophet
[1:17:27] gave us of the woman who had the baby
[1:17:29] and she was up in the balcony remember
[1:17:31] the story and she was walking around the
[1:17:33] baby crying crying crying the woman uh
[1:17:35] sitting there and she had a seat and
[1:17:37] this woman didn't have a seat she said
[1:17:38] honey take my seat don't think no I
[1:17:40] don't want to do that yeah yeah take my
[1:17:42] seat and then she sat down and she said
[1:17:44] sister honey this just keeps coming on
[1:17:46] my heart to pray for your baby would you
[1:17:48] mind I know you've got a prayer card and
[1:17:51] brother random is going to pray for your
[1:17:52] baby but with you man she said why no
[1:17:54] dear go right ahead well that little
[1:17:56] sister prayed for the baby later the
[1:17:59] prophet brought her upon the platform
[1:18:01] and she comes across to the prayer line
[1:18:03] and he looks at her vision breaks forth
[1:18:05] and said your baby is already healed
[1:18:07] that woman right back there prayed for
[1:18:10] your baby and God heard her prayer right
[1:18:12] then now brother random goes on to tell
[1:18:15] us that God knew that that mother would
[1:18:18] have a feeling in her heart for that
[1:18:20] child you see we've we've done such a
[1:18:23] discredit by thinking this is only for
[1:18:26] preachers that it's only for men only
[1:18:30] like you Mamas and your babies running a
[1:18:33] fever at home and you can't get a hold
[1:18:35] of me and you can't get a hold to
[1:18:37] brother Daryl I'll tell you one person
[1:18:39] you can get a hold to Heaven he's the
[1:18:40] only one that matters anyway and that's
[1:18:42] the Lord Jesus and the Lord could come
[1:18:45] right there and you lay your little hand
[1:18:47] right on that baby and say in the name
[1:18:50] of Jesus Satan I heard our pastor
[1:18:52] readeth from the word of God leave my
[1:18:55] child right now in Jesus name I believe
[1:18:57] it'll happen if you believe it with all
[1:18:59] your heart
[1:19:04] Now watch how the prophet takes this and
[1:19:06] diversifies and he said God works and
[1:19:09] many different ways to heal the sick and
[1:19:13] on another quote turns 63 I believe it
[1:19:15] was he said that God heals by music God
[1:19:18] heals by surgery God heals by love and
[1:19:22] he went through several different things
[1:19:23] that God healed by so there are Gifts of
[1:19:26] him you say music God remember when all
[1:19:28] Elisha was in a really bad mood you
[1:19:31] remember the prophet Elisha and he got
[1:19:33] in a really bad mood one day and they
[1:19:35] needed a word from the Lord but he
[1:19:37] wasn't in no mood to be able to give him
[1:19:38] no good word from the Lord so he said
[1:19:41] somebody bring a men's job well that was
[1:19:43] somebody that played an instrument so
[1:19:45] they brought the menstrual land that old
[1:19:46] boy got to plan on that thing and his
[1:19:48] hands must have been anointed as he was
[1:19:50] across them strains and whatever
[1:19:52] it was he is doing and all Elisha just
[1:19:55] got all calm down and relax and his
[1:19:57] Spirit got all calmed down on the
[1:19:59] presence of God and the hand of God
[1:20:01] moved on that prophet and he begin to
[1:20:04] give them a word from the Lord after the
[1:20:07] music come that's exactly why we sing
[1:20:10] before we preach sometimes we come in
[1:20:13] here and we're all muddled up in our
[1:20:15] minds and we've got business deals on
[1:20:17] our minds and we're worried about this
[1:20:19] and worried about that we need to get
[1:20:22] under the anointing and sing a little
[1:20:24] bit and clap their hands and worship God
[1:20:26] and get in a right mood how many knows
[1:20:29] you got to get in the right mood
[1:20:30] sometimes you've got to get in the right
[1:20:32] mood in order to be able to get into the
[1:20:34] service
[1:20:36] oh my notice the prophet said God works
[1:20:39] in many ways to heal the sick sometimes
[1:20:42] preaching the word I've seen it
[1:20:44] countless of times that whenever you
[1:20:46] preach and you'll see them sometimes
[1:20:48] they'll come up here and you'll notice
[1:20:49] that they'll tell me something and I
[1:20:51] won't pray for them well most of the
[1:20:53] time it's them sharing a testimony that
[1:20:55] while they're setting there in the Pew
[1:20:56] the Lord healed them or that's talking
[1:20:58] about that very thing that I preaching
[1:21:00] when they got dropped in their heart
[1:21:02] they don't need prayer they just wanted
[1:21:04] to share the testimony why God healed
[1:21:06] him when they're sitting right there in
[1:21:08] their Pew do you believe God can do that
[1:21:10] sure a preacher don't even have to lay
[1:21:12] hands on them at all but notice how he
[1:21:14] goes this way so sometimes the preaching
[1:21:17] of the word sometimes a neighbor
[1:21:21] setting by you and just lay his hand
[1:21:24] over on you feel like he should do so
[1:21:26] always do that whatever a born-again
[1:21:30] child of God feels to pray for the sick
[1:21:32] that's the Holy Spirit moving in you to
[1:21:35] do so no matter who is going to pray for
[1:21:40] the person you go ahead and pray for him
[1:21:42] anyhow well they told me that's going to
[1:21:45] get brother Donna to pray for him I
[1:21:47] better not know you better pray for him
[1:21:49] because the Lord may go ahead and answer
[1:21:51] your prayer and they'll just tell me God
[1:21:54] healed them and you prayed for them you
[1:21:56] see friend I I don't I don't understand
[1:21:58] I don't understand I just don't
[1:22:00] understand while we think it's so
[1:22:03] important that this man or that man or
[1:22:05] another man gets credit well I prayed
[1:22:08] for so and so when this happened and I
[1:22:10] prayed for so-and-so what the world is
[1:22:11] the matter with us we don't deserve no
[1:22:13] credit we don't deserve no honor well I
[1:22:17] prayed for him and I've done this and
[1:22:18] that and the other My my what difference
[1:22:21] doesn't mean who prayed for him if God
[1:22:23] answered prayer and they're better isn't
[1:22:26] that the most important thing they got
[1:22:28] healed they got delivered praise God
[1:22:31] that's what we want
[1:22:32] [Applause]
[1:22:36] foreign
[1:22:39] look at verse 10. now remember gifts
[1:22:44] are dangerous
[1:22:48] do you know that you can take a Divine
[1:22:51] gift
[1:22:52] and send your soul to hell with it
[1:23:01] I'll let you Ponder on that for a little
[1:23:03] bit
[1:23:05] now verse 10 he says to another
[1:23:09] thing of Miracles
[1:23:12] I wonder how many preachers in the
[1:23:14] message it was offering out the gifts
[1:23:16] tonight
[1:23:16] that'd be the first one they'd want
[1:23:21] why
[1:23:22] people tend to talk about that more
[1:23:26] seems to be more visible
[1:23:30] well y'all get inclined on me
[1:23:33] to another the working of Miracles the
[1:23:37] working of Miracles is not is that not a
[1:23:41] great gift it is absolutely a phenomenal
[1:23:44] gift but it's not the only one nope so
[1:23:47] what if a person doesn't need a miracle
[1:23:49] but they need a word of wisdom
[1:23:53] so and then they'd go to a preacher that
[1:23:55] has the ability and God uses him to
[1:23:58] perform great signs and wonders and
[1:24:00] miracles but at that present time
[1:24:03] they're not sick
[1:24:04] and they don't have uh you know a great
[1:24:07] Mighty Red Sea that's laying before him
[1:24:10] they need a word from God they need a
[1:24:14] word of wisdom and Thomas
[1:24:17] the Lord tells me there's somebody in
[1:24:20] the building tonight
[1:24:21] that's sad
[1:24:25] wow what discernment
[1:24:28] the Lord tells me there's somebody here
[1:24:30] tonight that's got a pain I can't
[1:24:33] pinpoint it but it's from the crown down
[1:24:35] to the bottom of the foot somewhere in
[1:24:37] that general area right there that
[1:24:39] covers everything don't it
[1:24:43] oh my goodness
[1:24:45] to another working of Miracles mama
[1:24:50] working of Miracles
[1:24:53] to another prophecy
[1:24:57] wow now that's a great one ain't it
[1:25:00] is that great prophecy
[1:25:03] and you know that prophecy tongues being
[1:25:07] interpreted is prophecy but that
[1:25:10] requires a team or the same person can
[1:25:14] be able to speak in tongues and then
[1:25:16] interpret what they said which is
[1:25:18] prophecy
[1:25:19] but a man or a woman can have prophecy
[1:25:24] alone prophecy is a standalone gift
[1:25:27] so the spirit of God could fall on them
[1:25:30] and they would say thus saith the Lord
[1:25:32] tomorrow Johnson City a bomb will fall
[1:25:36] out of a plane and such and such and so
[1:25:39] and so will happen well if that was God
[1:25:41] you better run
[1:25:43] I said you better run now if it wasn't
[1:25:46] God will all be gathered here on Sunday
[1:25:48] morning and we'll be trying to figure
[1:25:50] out how to cover the heart of that
[1:25:52] person who lied
[1:25:56] God Don't Lie if God says you're going
[1:26:01] to go hunting and you're going to do
[1:26:02] this and that the other it'll happen if
[1:26:05] God says it's going to rain tomorrow
[1:26:06] 1201 it'll rain 35 seconds and then
[1:26:09] it'll stop and then it will come in
[1:26:11] absolute Deluge for another 47 minutes
[1:26:13] and 35 seconds mark it down it will
[1:26:16] happen exactly that way if God don't say
[1:26:19] it oh you're in trouble because you got
[1:26:22] a lion Spirit on you
[1:26:24] dear Jesus look friends God Don't Lie
[1:26:30] so to one is giving the working of
[1:26:34] Miracles to another prophecy
[1:26:38] to another Discerning of spirits
[1:26:43] now listen carefully
[1:26:44] so one is called by God to work miracles
[1:26:48] another is called by God to prophesy
[1:26:54] another is called to discern spirits
[1:26:58] but now remember this is not the
[1:27:00] prophetic gift
[1:27:03] of discernment
[1:27:06] ah he didn't know there's a difference
[1:27:08] huh well you're fixing to find it out
[1:27:12] this is exactly as it says Discerning of
[1:27:18] spirits
[1:27:20] you know what amazes me is that Samantha
[1:27:22] message preachers preach this message
[1:27:24] and preach by the brand there's a
[1:27:26] prophet and this and that and the other
[1:27:27] and they'll take all they'll take his
[1:27:29] quotes on the Rapture they'll take his
[1:27:31] quotes on the Seven Seals they'll take
[1:27:33] his quotes on women cutting their hair
[1:27:34] and they'll take his quotes on this and
[1:27:36] that and the other but when it comes to
[1:27:37] the gifts it's not they think somehow
[1:27:39] brother Bram didn't what he's talking
[1:27:41] about well that don't make a lick of
[1:27:42] sense to me if I can't trust his
[1:27:44] teaching on the gifts how can I know I
[1:27:46] entrusted teaching on the rapture
[1:27:48] how can I trust his teaching on the
[1:27:51] Holiness and a lot of the other things
[1:27:52] if I can't trust his teaching on the
[1:27:54] gifts well come on somebody
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:27:58] so watch now Paul is wanting the church
[1:28:01] at Corinth and of course Paul knew that
[1:28:03] it was more than the Church of Corinth
[1:28:04] he knew that this would be no doubt read
[1:28:07] for countless of Ages so he wants them
[1:28:09] to be able to see what God wants to do
[1:28:12] in the body now remember the body of
[1:28:14] Christ reflects the mind of Christ
[1:28:18] what God wants the body doing on the
[1:28:21] earth in his stead shows what he thought
[1:28:25] about the body it's not what you and I
[1:28:28] think God wants us to do it's not what
[1:28:31] the church world thinks God wants us to
[1:28:33] do it's what God Said himself this is
[1:28:36] what I want my church to do in my
[1:28:40] absence I want you all to carry out my
[1:28:43] work the same way I did
[1:28:48] well can you understand that Jesus had
[1:28:50] all of this
[1:28:51] Jesus operating the gift of faith Jesus
[1:28:54] operating the word of wisdom the word of
[1:28:56] knowledge he operated and all this Jesus
[1:28:58] spoke in tongues on the cross and Jesus
[1:29:00] was able to discern spirit so all of
[1:29:02] this come from the great fountain at one
[1:29:04] time he said only one no doubt that it
[1:29:06] will ever be that way and then God
[1:29:08] Through the Ages he will disperse these
[1:29:11] gifts down through time and they were
[1:29:13] lost during the church ages what was the
[1:29:15] Pentecostal message a restoration of the
[1:29:18] gifts how many of them
[1:29:22] but what did mostly Pentecost emphasize
[1:29:25] tongues interpretation prophecy
[1:29:30] so that's the only three they got
[1:29:33] I've always wondered myself that Jack
[1:29:35] and hoped before I left this world or
[1:29:39] before the Rapture came
[1:29:41] that would be true
[1:29:44] scriptural manifestations of this word
[1:29:48] of God
[1:29:49] now either we believe it's still the
[1:29:52] word of God like it was when Paul wrote
[1:29:53] it oh we have to say well well now that
[1:29:56] that ain't no more says who
[1:29:58] the prophet said these things should be
[1:30:00] in every local body
[1:30:05] well praise the Lord
[1:30:08] Discerning of spirits
[1:30:13] Discerning of spirits
[1:30:16] now if I would ask here tonight how many
[1:30:18] people knows what this means no doubt
[1:30:21] the answer would be
[1:30:22] Diversified
[1:30:24] uh I'm sure that some would say I know
[1:30:27] what it means I know what it means it's
[1:30:29] this man calling this person out and and
[1:30:31] telling them this and the other are you
[1:30:33] sure
[1:30:35] Discerning of spirits
[1:30:39] now Peter by this gift
[1:30:43] discerned the ananias
[1:30:47] had lied to the Holy Ghost
[1:30:52] now remember if it could be taken like
[1:30:55] that Peter was using prophetic
[1:30:59] discernment
[1:31:02] but he was not
[1:31:04] he was not a prophet
[1:31:08] you see this prophetic discernment of
[1:31:11] the son of man
[1:31:13] it's only to be one
[1:31:16] in a generation
[1:31:19] only one
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:22] only
[1:31:23] one
[1:31:25] but Discerning of spirits is a gift
[1:31:28] that's to be of the body which is not
[1:31:31] the prophetic gift
[1:31:34] boy you all are sure looking at me funny
[1:31:36] have I got something on my face I mean I
[1:31:38] thought I wiped my face off
[1:31:40] now once Discerning of spirits it does
[1:31:43] not use the word discernment
[1:31:45] but Discerning of spirits what does it
[1:31:48] do what does the word discern to see
[1:31:50] right from wrong
[1:31:52] so Discerning of spirits is not somebody
[1:31:55] standing up with discernment I'm sorry
[1:31:58] that is the wrong meaning of the word
[1:32:04] Hallelujah
[1:32:06] so Peter could tell by Discerning of
[1:32:10] spirits when he looked at an eyes you
[1:32:13] have lied to the Holy Ghost
[1:32:15] [Music]
[1:32:16] and they packed him out a dead man
[1:32:19] right Safara come in same thing
[1:32:23] Discerning of spirits
[1:32:26] and said you have also lied to the Holy
[1:32:29] Ghost and the men that Pat your husband
[1:32:31] out are standing at the door and they
[1:32:34] will pack you out
[1:32:36] now he did not tell her what her name
[1:32:38] was then tell her what a street address
[1:32:40] was he did not read her thoughts or read
[1:32:43] her mind he was Discerning the spirit
[1:32:47] this is a church gift that belongs in
[1:32:52] the body of Christ
[1:32:54] amen but this is not a prophetic gift
[1:32:59] now look at me funny if you want to you
[1:33:01] know I wouldn't be saying this if I
[1:33:02] didn't have it in front of me
[1:33:06] sometimes I like to check you out and
[1:33:07] see how much you know how much you think
[1:33:10] you know anyway
[1:33:12] so Discerning of spirits oh do we need
[1:33:15] it yes
[1:33:18] yes yes
[1:33:19] we still need Discerning of spirits if
[1:33:22] we would allow the Lord he would help us
[1:33:25] to keep from getting hurt a lot of times
[1:33:27] by people that ain't got the right
[1:33:29] Spirit anyhow
[1:33:32] and if he could be able to flow through
[1:33:36] us oh my
[1:33:37] now you remember also there was another
[1:33:40] example now remember Peter was a great
[1:33:42] man but Peter was not a prophet he was
[1:33:46] not a church-aged messenger even though
[1:33:49] he preceded Paul he did not have the
[1:33:52] gift that Paul had
[1:33:55] praise the Lord now watch in Acts
[1:33:57] chapter 8 verse 18. there was a man by
[1:34:01] the name of Simon I'm on Simon saw that
[1:34:04] through the langon of the Apostles hands
[1:34:06] the Holy Ghost was given he offered them
[1:34:08] money never remember this man had become
[1:34:10] supposedly converted under Philip the
[1:34:14] evangelist
[1:34:15] now apparently Philip did not have this
[1:34:19] this gift of discerning of spirits
[1:34:23] so this man says he believes the Lord
[1:34:26] he's accepted the message and he's
[1:34:29] hanging around the message Church
[1:34:34] but Peter has already been used by God
[1:34:37] to discern
[1:34:40] spirits
[1:34:42] so watch when Simon saw that through the
[1:34:44] landline of the Apostle stands the Holy
[1:34:46] Ghost was given he offered them money
[1:34:48] now watch here Peter and them they laid
[1:34:51] their hands on the people and they
[1:34:52] received the Holy Ghost and this Simon
[1:34:54] Magus is his name Simon Magus so Simon
[1:34:58] says hey hey
[1:34:59] I'll pay you for that
[1:35:02] I'll give you money
[1:35:04] I want that same thing now remember this
[1:35:07] guy was hanging around and he was uh he
[1:35:10] had been a magician so he'd been working
[1:35:12] in the realm of demonology in witchcraft
[1:35:15] so he wanted this and Peter that thing
[1:35:19] struck him again oh mom won't you listen
[1:35:21] what he said
[1:35:24] give me also this power that on
[1:35:27] whomsoever I lay hands he may receive
[1:35:30] the holy ghost that sounds like a real
[1:35:32] desire don't it but it was as selfish as
[1:35:34] the Devil Himself
[1:35:37] now once you notice what Peter's
[1:35:40] response was oh brother brother we're
[1:35:43] all so full of love around here we don't
[1:35:46] never say nothing harsh to nobody oh
[1:35:50] brother ah not brother Peter he was
[1:35:52] rough on a corn cob and Peter said unto
[1:35:56] him thy money perish with thee because
[1:35:59] thou has thought the gift of God may be
[1:36:02] purchased with money thou Hast neither
[1:36:05] part nor locked in this matter for thy
[1:36:10] heart oh
[1:36:12] the heart is not right in the sight of
[1:36:16] God boy that's a mouthful
[1:36:20] how are you going to be able to tell
[1:36:23] what's in a man's heart
[1:36:26] Discerning of spirits
[1:36:31] your heart ain't right you ain't got no
[1:36:33] power
[1:36:35] and yet no doubt Philip went back to
[1:36:37] town said glory to God I'll tell you
[1:36:39] what I was over here preaching there's a
[1:36:41] magician God saved Oh Glory to God I'll
[1:36:43] tell you one thing out there testifying
[1:36:45] Hallelujah to God man a lot you talking
[1:36:48] about a meat we had all for one office
[1:36:50] meetings ever was I ever seen in my life
[1:36:52] that magician come by prayer he'd give
[1:36:54] his heart to the Lord Lord glory to God
[1:36:57] I was in South Africa a few years ago
[1:36:59] I'm talking about me I never been a
[1:37:01] message preacher there in front of me oh
[1:37:02] it's just a few weeks had been to this
[1:37:04] certain certain place and I done heard
[1:37:06] them coming back let's talking about
[1:37:07] bragging boy we've witnessed to the
[1:37:10] message of this certain certain guy we
[1:37:12] baptized him he was on fire with the
[1:37:14] Holy Ghost and I was there about two
[1:37:15] weeks after that he was still drinking
[1:37:18] he was still smoking he was still
[1:37:20] wearing his short britches around like a
[1:37:22] little girl he was still doing this and
[1:37:24] that and the other and they was going
[1:37:26] all over the states bragging about what
[1:37:28] God had done for us and that's the way a
[1:37:30] lot of preachers are they ain't nothing
[1:37:32] but a bagel in
[1:37:36] I'll tell you one thing if you ever get
[1:37:39] a hold to Jesus the drinking will go the
[1:37:42] cigarettes will go the short one will go
[1:37:45] the lion will go the cheating will go
[1:37:48] you will be a changed person
[1:37:58] wow
[1:38:01] Peter said break it
[1:38:04] of this thy wickedness and pray God
[1:38:08] if perhaps
[1:38:11] I mean he's hanging him over hell and
[1:38:12] not sure there's even any Mercy left for
[1:38:14] him
[1:38:15] perhaps
[1:38:17] the thought of thine heart may be
[1:38:21] forgiven
[1:38:23] well Peter sure wouldn't make a good
[1:38:24] layout of sin would he
[1:38:26] imagine oh no matter what you've done it
[1:38:29] don't mean no difference you can cuss
[1:38:31] God you can buy same one whatever we're
[1:38:34] all going to heaven no way you owe my
[1:38:36] you son of the devil yourself preached
[1:38:38] such lies and Damned them people to hell
[1:38:42] no we ain't all going to heaven there's
[1:38:44] only one way and that way is Jesus
[1:38:47] Christ and you cannot come the lust the
[1:38:50] father draws you to that way
[1:38:54] wow
[1:38:58] repent therefore this thy wickedness and
[1:39:01] pray God if
[1:39:04] perhaps
[1:39:05] the thought of thy heart may be
[1:39:09] forgiven me how could he say this in
[1:39:12] such a forceful assertive way it wasn't
[1:39:15] just his gift to preach
[1:39:18] God had used him in Discerning of
[1:39:20] spirits and this man's own mouth this
[1:39:23] man's own behavior showed who is still
[1:39:27] on the throne of his heart don't you see
[1:39:30] what God wants the body to become to a
[1:39:33] child of God filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:39:35] the body is a servant to the soul
[1:39:40] the body becomes that's what it is when
[1:39:42] you're a sinner the body is a servant to
[1:39:45] the nature of the Soul on your lost so
[1:39:48] the body fulfills whatever the soul
[1:39:50] wants if the soul wants to drink if it
[1:39:52] wants to lie whatever it wants to do the
[1:39:54] body just goes ahead and does it and
[1:39:56] when a person is born again the same
[1:39:58] thing ought to happen again except you
[1:40:00] got a new master on the throne of your
[1:40:02] heart and then the body becomes a
[1:40:04] servant hey body I'm going to clap my
[1:40:06] hands my soul ain't got none well here
[1:40:08] you go here's mine go ahead and clap
[1:40:10] them boy I want to dance a little bit
[1:40:12] well here's my feet go ahead and dance I
[1:40:15] want to shout I want to worship God I
[1:40:17] want to go to church and the body said
[1:40:19] yes sir yes sir yes sir
[1:40:21] [Applause]
[1:40:30] whew
[1:40:32] watch these words verse 23 for I
[1:40:35] perceive
[1:40:39] oh here we go
[1:40:42] how did he perceive
[1:40:44] by Discerning of spirits the thou are in
[1:40:47] the gall
[1:40:49] of bitterness
[1:40:51] I'll tell you one thing he preached
[1:40:53] rougher to this guy in four verses and a
[1:40:55] lot of church folks here in 40 years
[1:40:56] didn't he
[1:40:58] he stripped him down laid him bare right
[1:41:00] before hell and hung him right there by
[1:41:02] a string and said buddy you better
[1:41:03] repent fast and you better get back to
[1:41:05] God I hope there's Mercy for you you
[1:41:07] imagine this old boy shook her he was
[1:41:09] scared he totally to death he said oh
[1:41:11] pray for me pray for me Peter why he did
[1:41:14] not need a Word of Wisdom he did not
[1:41:17] need a word of knowledge he did not need
[1:41:19] Miracles he did not me well somebody
[1:41:21] preached with me tonight what did he
[1:41:24] need the summoning of spirits to say man
[1:41:27] you need to be set free from that evil
[1:41:29] thing
[1:41:33] I think we'll still need it don't you
[1:41:38] I want you to know Simon's response let
[1:41:41] me finish verse 23 for I perceive the
[1:41:43] Thou Art and the gall of bitterness and
[1:41:45] then the bond of iniquity
[1:41:47] in other words you ain't nothing but a
[1:41:49] make-believer boy
[1:41:50] you better get your ass straightened out
[1:41:52] quick
[1:41:55] I just hope there's Mercy for you I'm
[1:41:57] not sure there's even an ounce left
[1:42:01] well if Peter would have said that to a
[1:42:03] man who wanted to be able to have the
[1:42:05] gift of God to give the Holy Ghost out I
[1:42:08] wonder what he'd do to a bunch of these
[1:42:09] make-believing preachers and the
[1:42:11] denominations and so on today Lord have
[1:42:14] mercy they probably wouldn't let Peter
[1:42:16] he wouldn't be able to preach five
[1:42:17] minutes in the Pulpit would he I wonder
[1:42:19] how many of our message churches Peter
[1:42:21] will be able to preach in his Senator
[1:42:22] preaching about the gall of bitterness
[1:42:24] and God biting and doing this and that
[1:42:26] and I said what no why does it matter to
[1:42:28] you all bunch of people I thought you
[1:42:30] all believed the apostolic doctrine that
[1:42:32] me and Paul and James and Matthew Prince
[1:42:34] you folks are about your pansies you're
[1:42:36] a bunch of weaklings you got your
[1:42:38] feelings out on your shoulder and if the
[1:42:40] preacher don't shake your hand you ain't
[1:42:42] coming back what the world's a matter
[1:42:44] with you all you all need to get that
[1:42:46] same holy ghost that we got on the day
[1:42:49] of Pentecost and helped us to die for it
[1:42:51] it helped us to live for it we've raised
[1:42:54] The Dead We heal the sick we cast out
[1:42:57] Devils we discern spirits and it'll do
[1:43:00] the same for you
[1:43:03] thank you
[1:43:08] we'd all be sitting in here and say dear
[1:43:10] Jesus
[1:43:13] let me show them some of y'all been
[1:43:15] watching the pastor and said what's
[1:43:16] brother Donnie said
[1:43:18] his brother died not in his head if he
[1:43:20] knows he's dead I'm Gonna Know
[1:43:21] the brother Donald's got that peculiar
[1:43:23] look in his face I'm gonna have that
[1:43:24] peculiar looking mine
[1:43:26] you imagine these boys they didn't play
[1:43:28] they didn't play they wasn't there to
[1:43:31] rub people on the head they was there to
[1:43:33] tell them the truth
[1:43:38] um
[1:43:40] now notice Simon's response
[1:43:42] then answered Simon and said
[1:43:45] pray ye
[1:43:48] to the Lord
[1:43:50] for me
[1:43:54] now prior to this discerning
[1:43:57] he wanted to buy the Holy Ghost so he
[1:43:59] could give it out
[1:44:02] and after this Discerning of spirits
[1:44:05] he didn't even feel worthy to pray
[1:44:08] wow
[1:44:10] did God give the man what he needed
[1:44:14] a good rebuking
[1:44:17] oh you imagine somebody's allowed to
[1:44:19] send pictures they said come on in
[1:44:20] brother how much money you got

[1:45:05] Holy Ghost sweat my sweat stinks just
[1:45:07] like yours does there's only one holy
[1:45:10] thing among us and that's the Mighty God
[1:45:12] that ain't the holy preacher it ain't
[1:45:15] the holy church it's the Holy Ghost
[1:45:17] [Applause]
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:27] huh
[1:45:30] so Paul says to another
[1:45:32] Discerning of spirits
[1:45:34] to another diverse kinds of tongues
[1:45:39] huh
[1:45:40] diverse kinds of tongues
[1:45:45] now I know there are tongues of men
[1:45:48] and there are tongues of angels
[1:45:51] I know all the message folks don't even
[1:45:53] believe in tongues no more
[1:45:56] yes you do
[1:45:57] that one that causes you so much trouble
[1:45:59] is cutting the middle and tied on both
[1:46:02] ends it's the best one some of y'all
[1:46:04] seem like you got two or three times the
[1:46:05] way you gab and Goss it and carry them
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:10] [Applause]
[1:46:12] are you taking us oh Lord have mercy
[1:46:15] you've taken us back to Pentecost oh
[1:46:17] dear God don't tell me we're going back
[1:46:19] to 1906. no no no no no no no no we're
[1:46:23] going way further back than 1906. we're
[1:46:26] going back to Acts chapter two we're the
[1:46:30] original Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[1:46:32] Pentecost not just the restoration of
[1:46:35] gifts but the undoing of the power of
[1:46:37] God that changes Our Lives
[1:46:46] diverse kinds of tongues some of these
[1:46:49] tongues will be interpreted and some
[1:46:51] won't
[1:46:52] some will be intended for prayer only
[1:46:56] you alone with God
[1:46:58] and the Holy Ghost will begin to speak
[1:47:00] out of you
[1:47:02] you said why in the world would he do
[1:47:03] that I reckon because he figures I ain't
[1:47:05] smart enough to know what to say so he's
[1:47:08] going to take over my tongue and say
[1:47:10] what I need to say
[1:47:11] well don't sit there and look at me some
[1:47:13] of y'all don't know what to pray a bit
[1:47:14] more than I do Paul even said sometimes
[1:47:16] he'll utter things that can't even be
[1:47:18] articulated how does he do it by
[1:47:20] groanings in the spirit so he said oh
[1:47:24] oh people say Lord have mercy that ain't
[1:47:27] praying read your Bible a little closer
[1:47:28] sometimes you don't even know the words
[1:47:31] to say nobody know what I'm talking
[1:47:32] about when you get down then you're just
[1:47:34] groaning and groaning and groaning and
[1:47:37] what is it the spirit of God and then
[1:47:39] maybe all of a sudden you'll break forth
[1:47:41] and speak in a language you never talked
[1:47:43] in your life and then you may talking
[1:47:44] that for a bit and then Break Forth into
[1:47:46] another and into another well come on
[1:47:48] somebody why because the Bible says God
[1:47:51] will find the way over God do that ask
[1:47:54] him
[1:47:55] I'm just the Mailman
[1:48:01] to another the interpretation of tongues
[1:48:07] so the person that is an interpreter
[1:48:10] if they're a genuine interpreter
[1:48:13] and I'm speaking in Arabic
[1:48:16] which I have
[1:48:17] or in Hebrew which I have
[1:48:20] or Italian which I have
[1:48:23] or Spanish which I have and German which
[1:48:27] I have
[1:48:30] well you say I didn't know you was that
[1:48:32] smart I ain't
[1:48:36] I don't even speak good English
[1:48:38] must I say anything else
[1:48:42] brother Tony no no no don't tell me
[1:48:44] don't tell me you speak your truth I
[1:48:46] just told you
[1:48:48] and I'm not ashamed of it
[1:48:50] I said I'm not ashamed
[1:48:55] anybody else in here that's not ashamed
[1:48:57] to say well yeah glory to God every now
[1:48:59] and then I do too
[1:49:02] I'm surprised that some of you that do
[1:49:05] oh Lord have mercy glory to God I've
[1:49:08] never thought of previous loser would
[1:49:09] ever talked in tongues I never thought
[1:49:11] all the previous Baptist or a Church of
[1:49:13] Christ whoever talk 10 times but that's
[1:49:15] what the Holy Ghost does once he gets a
[1:49:17] hold of you he throws looserness about
[1:49:19] the window he throws Catholicism out the
[1:49:22] window why because God says I want
[1:49:25] somebody even in the message that I can
[1:49:28] get their mouths
[1:49:37] what language do you speak brother
[1:49:38] beside English
[1:49:41] come here
[1:49:48] I'm going to say it English you're
[1:49:50] speaking in Swahili the Lord Jesus
[1:49:52] Christ
[1:49:54] Lo loves you and our Panda he died for
[1:49:58] you
[1:49:59] he come down from heaven
[1:50:04] how many understands what he's saying
[1:50:10] ah
[1:50:13] thank you so to the rest of us it's
[1:50:16] Swahili
[1:50:18] or Greek or French I mean we wouldn't
[1:50:20] know the difference
[1:50:26] now how could he interpret what I said
[1:50:29] because he also speaks and hears English
[1:50:33] so tongues that are to be interpreted
[1:50:35] they will speak in whatever language and
[1:50:38] a person with the gift of interpretation
[1:50:40] will hear it just like he heard it
[1:50:44] and he'll bring it for us in that
[1:50:46] language and others are sitting there
[1:50:47] saying what in the world is he talking
[1:50:48] about what in the world is he saying you
[1:50:50] see that's why that the Bible and the
[1:50:52] prophet goes right along when teaching
[1:50:54] them the same thing that without an
[1:50:56] interpreter in the church lets him hold
[1:50:58] their peace
[1:50:59] people get up speak in tongues and speak
[1:51:01] in tongues and speak in tongues and we
[1:51:03] sit here and we sat there and we sat
[1:51:04] here and nothing happens that person's
[1:51:06] supposed to hold their peace and tell
[1:51:08] them whenever you're praying and tell
[1:51:10] them when you come up you know on the
[1:51:11] Alder and all that and the Holy Ghost is
[1:51:12] all over you I'm talking about one of
[1:51:14] the interruption service or even at the
[1:51:16] end of the service and people stand and
[1:51:18] speak in tongues and speak in tongues
[1:51:19] and speak in tongues and nothing ever
[1:51:21] comes out of it let him hold his peace
[1:51:23] or her hold hers
[1:51:26] except there being an interpreter then
[1:51:29] an interpreter will hear it exactly as
[1:51:32] my brother heard my English and
[1:51:35] translated it into Swahili so if it'd
[1:51:38] been the opposite and I was up there
[1:51:39] speaking in tongues and Swahili and he
[1:51:41] had the gift of interpretation he'd be
[1:51:43] able to stand up yes the Lord Jesus
[1:51:45] loves you he came down from heaven I
[1:51:48] spoke in Swahili and he heard it and he
[1:51:50] gave it to you to make it understandable
[1:51:52] so the world wouldn't think we're more
[1:51:54] crazy than what they already do
[1:51:58] anybody here believe in this
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:07] verse 11 but all these work us
[1:52:11] that one and self-same spirit dividing
[1:52:13] to every man several is his will
[1:52:16] verse 27. now you're the body of Christ
[1:52:19] and members in particular
[1:52:22] I love this word particular part portion
[1:52:26] apart do or assigned to one a lot of
[1:52:31] Destiny and a measure
[1:52:34] so God chose to do it this way in order
[1:52:36] to reveal his mind
[1:52:39] in the body
[1:52:40] so the body would act out the mind
[1:52:44] of Christ so the body of Christ is the
[1:52:49] servant to the soul
[1:52:51] of Christ
[1:52:54] I don't go over your head now remember
[1:52:55] what the prophet tells us and so is in
[1:52:57] prison now about that soul
[1:53:00] a soul of God in 1965 he tells us the
[1:53:02] soul of God that was in God before the
[1:53:04] foundation of the world
[1:53:06] Christ Jesus should be the soul of our
[1:53:09] church the soul of Our Lives the soul of
[1:53:13] everything we are that what are we the
[1:53:15] body of Christ that we are a servant to
[1:53:19] our soul which is our master
[1:53:23] glory to God
[1:53:25] can I have a few more minutes
[1:53:27] First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 28.
[1:53:36] God set some in the church
[1:53:38] first apostles
[1:53:41] secondarily Prophets
[1:53:44] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[1:53:47] then gifts notice again Paul of healings
[1:53:52] helps
[1:53:55] uh
[1:53:56] helps
[1:54:00] helps
[1:54:06] would rather be Apostles and Prophets
[1:54:08] and
[1:54:10] but how can you run a church without
[1:54:12] helps
[1:54:14] but who wants to be helps
[1:54:17] if people don't want to be a prophet
[1:54:20] they want to be the next word
[1:54:22] governments
[1:54:26] they want to run the church
[1:54:31] diversities of tongues now did the New
[1:54:35] Testament Church have and believe in
[1:54:39] Prophets
[1:54:41] that's how the Bible said the law and
[1:54:43] the prophets were unto John
[1:54:47] you see these poor Knuckleheads that
[1:54:48] have left the message and try to use
[1:54:50] that scripture to disqualify brother
[1:54:52] Branham or disqualifying the book of
[1:54:54] Acts when they do it
[1:54:56] they're so ignorant they don't even
[1:54:57] realize the law was the Torah and the
[1:55:01] prophets was identified from the first
[1:55:03] five books of Moses on down to Malachi
[1:55:05] that's the way it's referred to over and
[1:55:08] over and over again in the Bible the law
[1:55:11] and the prophets so the first five books
[1:55:14] of Moses and from there on over to the
[1:55:16] Book of Malachi so it was identifying it
[1:55:19] was not excluding prophets from the New
[1:55:22] Testament and somebody said
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:26] Acts chapter 11 verse 27. and in these
[1:55:30] days came
[1:55:34] after John
[1:55:37] came prophets from Jerusalem
[1:55:40] unto Antioch so did the New Testament
[1:55:43] Church believe in Prophets
[1:55:47] but now remember these are Church
[1:55:48] Prophets
[1:55:51] it's not the church age messenger
[1:55:54] he's not on the scene yet in his office
[1:55:57] and there stood up one of them named
[1:56:00] agabus
[1:56:02] and signified by the spirit that there
[1:56:05] should be a great nurse throughout all
[1:56:07] the world
[1:56:09] I love this so Luke writes the prophecy
[1:56:12] and then tells the time when it was
[1:56:15] fulfilled
[1:56:16] which came to pass in the days of
[1:56:21] Claudius Caesar
[1:56:23] that was this man a great preacher we
[1:56:26] don't know
[1:56:27] what's this man an evangelist we don't
[1:56:30] know was this man a church-aged
[1:56:33] messenger he was not
[1:56:35] that I do know
[1:56:37] did he even write any books I've never
[1:56:40] found one in history
[1:56:42] or church history
[1:56:44] well he ever wrote anything
[1:56:46] he was known in the book of Acts by two
[1:56:50] prophecies
[1:56:51] but he was called a prophet now this is
[1:56:55] not like Paul you understand
[1:56:58] now what's there Acts chapter 21 verse
[1:57:01] 10.
[1:57:02] and as we tear down many days there came
[1:57:05] down from Judea a certain Prophet named
[1:57:08] agabus now this is Again Luke writing
[1:57:10] about him traveling with Paul and when
[1:57:12] he was coming to us he took Paul's
[1:57:14] girdle and bound his own hands and feet
[1:57:17] and said thus saith the Holy Ghost
[1:57:20] so shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the
[1:57:23] man that only this girdle and shall
[1:57:26] deliver him unto the hands of the
[1:57:28] Gentiles now it doesn't even sound like
[1:57:31] he even knew who Paul was
[1:57:33] but watch how he's acting out in a
[1:57:37] symbolism as an Old Testament Prophet
[1:57:39] but he never gave us any books there's
[1:57:42] no book of agabus there's no letter that
[1:57:45] he wrote to any church but he was a new
[1:57:47] testament prophet and when we heard
[1:57:50] these things both we and they of the
[1:57:52] place besought him not to go to
[1:57:53] Jerusalem so they hear agabus prophesy
[1:57:56] this and they tell Paul please don't
[1:57:57] don't go watch Paul and then Paul
[1:58:00] answered and said what mean you to weep
[1:58:02] and to break my heart
[1:58:04] for I am ready not to be bound only but
[1:58:07] also to die Jerusalem for the name of
[1:58:09] the Lord Jesus
[1:58:11] oh my God now look with me in chapter 12
[1:58:14] verse 29 are all apostles
[1:58:19] answer listen me are all apostles no are
[1:58:23] all prophets no are all teachers
[1:58:28] are all workers of Miracles
[1:58:33] have all the gifts of healing
[1:58:37] but I want you to notice they are still
[1:58:39] part of the all
[1:58:42] now he's not talking about the world
[1:58:45] and comparing the prophets the apostles
[1:58:47] the gifts of healing but he's talking
[1:58:48] about the body so is everybody in the
[1:58:51] body a prophet no that's everybody on
[1:58:54] the prophet or an apostle no there's
[1:58:56] everybody in the body have the gift of
[1:58:58] Miracles no
[1:59:00] but they're in the body
[1:59:02] and nobody can take your place the
[1:59:05] greatest Miracle Worker that there is
[1:59:07] Among Us cannot take your place or take
[1:59:10] your crown that God's ordained for you
[1:59:12] to wear
[1:59:14] notice this are all teachers no our own
[1:59:16] workers and miracles have all the gifts
[1:59:19] of healing
[1:59:21] do all speak with tongues
[1:59:24] so you mean we're still talking about
[1:59:26] people in the body and Paul didn't
[1:59:28] believe everybody in the body had to
[1:59:29] speak with tongues
[1:59:31] do all interpret
[1:59:33] now let me go on and say this do all see
[1:59:36] visions
[1:59:37] no
[1:59:40] huh
[1:59:45] what was the commission that Jesus gave
[1:59:48] to his church
[1:59:49] in Mark 16
[1:59:51] 17.
[1:59:53] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:59:56] belief
[1:59:57] in my name they shall
[2:00:01] cast out Devils take up serpents which
[2:00:04] Paul did on the aisle of course that was
[2:00:07] not a snake handling church now
[2:00:09] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[2:00:12] shall not hurt them they shall lay their
[2:00:15] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:00:19] so the commission to the church
[2:00:22] never included visions
[2:00:25] shouting
[2:00:26] jumping
[2:00:27] running
[2:00:31] but we believe in all of that do we not
[2:00:33] no wonder why Jesus wouldn't use that as
[2:00:36] a sign that so well ever believer will
[2:00:38] have a vision because he knew they would
[2:00:40] not
[2:00:41] but this would be among the Believers
[2:00:44] size following casting out Devils
[2:00:47] raising the dead whatever believer do it
[2:00:49] no you won't some of y'all let the devil
[2:00:52] beat you over the head because you ain't
[2:00:54] never done this and that and the other
[2:00:55] it ain't your place too remember
[2:00:57] Florence shakiran coming to brother
[2:00:58] Brown and she said brother Branham I
[2:01:00] fasted and fasted and fasted and cast
[2:01:02] out Devils he said sister Florence you
[2:01:05] wasn't called to do such you was called
[2:01:08] to fast for them whose call to cast out
[2:01:10] devils
[2:01:12] you see once we find that spot then
[2:01:15] godliness with contentment is great gain
[2:01:19] then you won't let the devil beat you
[2:01:21] over there well you never spoken like
[2:01:23] brother Donnie speaks in tongue to
[2:01:24] brother so and so to well look at
[2:01:26] so-and-so they stand up and lay their
[2:01:27] hands on the set and they say look devil
[2:01:29] shut your mouth if God wants me to speak
[2:01:31] in tongues he'll give it to me if I
[2:01:34] believe it if he wants me to lay my
[2:01:35] hands on the sick he'll give it to me
[2:01:37] and you shut your mouth trying to
[2:01:39] torment me because I'm going to be what
[2:01:42] God made me be
[2:01:48] thank you
[2:01:49] how many police and visions
[2:01:55] Acts chapter 2 verse 17 and it shall
[2:01:57] come to pass in the last day say of God
[2:01:58] I will pour out of my spirit on All
[2:02:00] Flesh your sons and your daughter shall
[2:02:02] prophesy your young men
[2:02:04] not limited now to Prophets
[2:02:07] this type vision
[2:02:10] your young men shall see visions and
[2:02:12] your old man shall dream dreams
[2:02:15] acts 9 verse 10. and there was a certain
[2:02:18] disciple at Damascus notice it doesn't
[2:02:21] even say he's a preacher now a disciple
[2:02:24] named ananias
[2:02:27] and to him said the Lord
[2:02:29] in a
[2:02:33] inhibition
[2:02:34] ananias and he said behold I am here
[2:02:36] Lord
[2:02:37] and the Lord said in him arise and going
[2:02:39] to the street which is called straight
[2:02:41] and inquire in the house of Judas for
[2:02:44] One Call Saul of terseus for behold he
[2:02:47] prays
[2:02:48] and have seen in a vision
[2:02:51] a man named ananias so Paul ain't even
[2:02:55] got saved yet as we'd call Sage
[2:02:59] Sanctified baptized filled with the Holy
[2:03:01] Ghost he's just praying
[2:03:03] you mean this man saw a vision and he
[2:03:05] didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet this
[2:03:07] man saw a vision and he just now come
[2:03:10] straight off the street from con you
[2:03:12] know absolutely condemning the Believers
[2:03:14] and blaspheme in the name of the Lord
[2:03:15] Jesus and the Lord shows the man is this
[2:03:18] your Bible
[2:03:19] now is this a prophetic Vision no
[2:03:23] is this an end time messenger Vision no
[2:03:29] Hello friends I'm sorry you didn't know
[2:03:31] this is in your Bible
[2:03:36] can it go on
[2:03:39] are you sure
[2:03:41] Acts chapter 10 verse 1. there was a
[2:03:44] certain man in caesarea called Cornelius
[2:03:48] Cornelius was a Roman Centurion of the
[2:03:53] Italian band
[2:03:56] not saved not Sanctified not baptized
[2:04:03] and listen what happened to this matter
[2:04:05] Centurion of the band that was called
[2:04:06] the Italian band a devout man under the
[2:04:09] law now doing everything he knew to do
[2:04:11] but he still wasn't safe one that feared
[2:04:13] God and out his house which gave much
[2:04:16] arms to the people and prayed to God
[2:04:18] that sounds like a good church member
[2:04:20] don't it he saw in a
[2:04:26] wow
[2:04:29] so you mean a person could actually see
[2:04:32] a vision and not be a prophet
[2:04:38] but it wouldn't be a vision the way
[2:04:41] it would come to a problem now remember
[2:04:42] the Bible tells us in the Old Testament
[2:04:44] and the word of the Lord was precious in
[2:04:45] those days because there was no open
[2:04:49] vision
[2:04:50] you see this is why God used prophets in
[2:04:53] this way because when God but showed
[2:04:55] them a vision they're so made where they
[2:04:58] cannot listen they cannot say anything
[2:05:03] wrong
[2:05:04] in that vision
[2:05:07] the word of the Lord comes through the
[2:05:09] vision and the vision is infallible now
[2:05:13] you said you believed what Paul wrote
[2:05:15] right
[2:05:17] well according to the Bible every word
[2:05:19] is supposed to be established in the
[2:05:20] mouth of two or three Witnesses
[2:05:23] so show me at least one more that wrote
[2:05:26] about the nine gifts of the Spirit
[2:05:33] preachers can be a smart addicts
[2:05:34] sometimes
[2:05:38] but yet you believe Paul had the
[2:05:40] inspiration of God
[2:05:42] now do you need another writer in the
[2:05:45] New Testament before you're going to
[2:05:46] believe what Paul said about the gifts
[2:05:47] what Paul said about women in their hair
[2:05:50] he's the only one that wrote about it
[2:05:52] you're going to believe what Paul said
[2:05:53] in the book of Hebrews about many of the
[2:05:54] types and the Shadows of the Old
[2:05:55] Testament
[2:05:57] you mean you're going to take one man's
[2:05:59] word for it
[2:06:00] let's apply that same principle to Moses
[2:06:02] coming down off the law when Moses said
[2:06:04] off the mountain with the law of God
[2:06:05] when Moses said God brought that with
[2:06:07] his own finger of course two more
[2:06:09] witness to say God did
[2:06:12] but you see God so hones them prophets
[2:06:15] in their gift is not the same as
[2:06:19] Discerning of spirits in the church
[2:06:22] that one can hit
[2:06:24] or Miss
[2:06:28] let's stand
[2:06:33] [Applause]
[2:06:41] let me read the rest of this of
[2:06:42] Cornelius
[2:06:44] he saw on a vision evidently about the
[2:06:47] nine Tower of the day an angel of God
[2:06:49] coming into him
[2:06:51] and sang unto him Cornelius
[2:06:55] and when he looked on him he was afraid
[2:06:57] and he said what is it Lord
[2:07:00] and he said unto him thy prayers and
[2:07:02] thine arms are come up for a memorial
[2:07:05] before God
[2:07:07] Acts chapter 10 verse 9.
[2:07:11] and on memorials they went on the
[2:07:12] Journey of June 9 to the city Peter went
[2:07:14] up to the house top to pray about the
[2:07:16] sixth hour
[2:07:17] and he became very hungry
[2:07:19] and it would have eaten but while they
[2:07:21] made ready he fell into a trance
[2:07:27] strange that he didn't use the same word
[2:07:29] vision
[2:07:31] look at what the word trance means I
[2:07:34] thought that was absolutely rapturous
[2:07:40] a man who by some sudden emotion is
[2:07:44] transported as it were out of himself
[2:07:50] so that in this wrapped
[2:07:54] wrapped r-a-p-t Rapture wrapped
[2:07:58] this is the kind of rap I believe that
[2:08:03] hahaha
[2:08:07] I'm a holy ghost rapper
[2:08:12] so a man by some means is carried out of
[2:08:18] himself
[2:08:21] in this wrapped condition
[2:08:24] although he is awake
[2:08:27] his mind is drawn off
[2:08:30] from all surrounding objects
[2:08:34] and wholly fixed on things divine
[2:08:39] that he sees nothing but the forms and
[2:08:42] images
[2:08:43] lying Within
[2:08:46] wow
[2:08:49] but what's amazing to me is when God
[2:08:51] Appears to Cornelius in this Vision it's
[2:08:54] as plain and simple as it can be when
[2:08:57] God Appears
[2:08:59] to Paul it's as plain and simple but I
[2:09:03] want you notice when God Appears to
[2:09:05] Peter
[2:09:06] and he saw heaven opened and a certain
[2:09:09] vessel descending unto him as it had
[2:09:11] been a great sheet knit or tie that at
[2:09:15] the Four Corners and let down to the
[2:09:17] Earth for him or all manner of
[2:09:19] four-footed Beast
[2:09:21] of the Earth
[2:09:23] wild beast
[2:09:26] and creeping things
[2:09:28] and files of the air
[2:09:30] this trance is full of symbols
[2:09:35] Cornelius didn't say nothing about
[2:09:37] having no symbols at all ananias didn't
[2:09:39] say nothing about having no symbols
[2:09:40] neither did Paul's have any symbols they
[2:09:43] say wonder why in the world the lord
[2:09:45] shows symbols to use Peter must him in
[2:09:48] God's way of dealing with him it's kind
[2:09:49] of a stubborn sort of a guy you know
[2:09:50] hard-headed and the Lord really had to
[2:09:52] convey him about this and there came a
[2:09:55] voice to him rise Peter kill and eat
[2:09:59] but Peter said
[2:10:01] not so Lord
[2:10:03] for I have never
[2:10:05] eaten anything that is common or unclean
[2:10:08] and the voice back on him again the
[2:10:10] second time what God has cleansing
[2:10:11] called not thou caught
[2:10:14] this was down Thrice see what I'm saying
[2:10:16] anybody being stubborn hard-headed
[2:10:19] isn't this amazing a gentile
[2:10:22] saw one vision
[2:10:24] and it was enough
[2:10:26] ananias was sent to a man that they knew
[2:10:29] was guilty of killing Christians God
[2:10:31] didn't have to send him three
[2:10:34] he sent him one
[2:10:36] but it happens to Peter three times now
[2:10:38] while Peter gathered in himself what
[2:10:40] this is and which he had seen should
[2:10:42] mean
[2:10:43] behold the men which were sent from
[2:10:45] Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's
[2:10:47] house and stood before the gates so
[2:10:49] Peter's trying to figure what in the
[2:10:51] world God wants me to eat shrimp Lord
[2:10:54] have mercy God wants me to crap he wants
[2:10:58] me to eat Gunk and Goose Lord certainly
[2:11:01] the goodness that wasn't a hog
[2:11:03] Peter you don't know what them Baconator
[2:11:05] sandwiches is like man I'm telling you
[2:11:08] boy
[2:11:10] you imagine God showing him and Peter's
[2:11:12] saying what in the world is a matter
[2:11:14] with me this couldn't be the Holy Ghost
[2:11:17] this couldn't be God
[2:11:20] but it was
[2:11:22] somebody's sitting there pondering and
[2:11:24] thinking Lord
[2:11:27] you mean I've got to start eating pork
[2:11:29] ribs
[2:11:31] hogged out Lord have mercy the brothers
[2:11:34] will kill me they'll throw me out of the
[2:11:37] church
[2:11:38] and while he's thinking on it some old
[2:11:40] boys downstairs knocking on the door
[2:11:42] said you all got a man here by the name
[2:11:44] of Peter
[2:11:47] yeah it just so happens we do
[2:11:51] the Lord God sent us
[2:11:55] Hallelujah
[2:11:57] the men which were sent from Cordelia
[2:11:59] you said made inquiry at Simon's house
[2:12:01] and stood before the gate and called and
[2:12:04] asked whether Simon which was surname
[2:12:06] Peter lodged there while Peter thought
[2:12:09] on the vision the spirit
[2:12:12] said unto him behold three men
[2:12:16] seek them
[2:12:19] now you see that isn't the same thing
[2:12:22] as a prophetic gift
[2:12:24] let me just give you this some of y'all
[2:12:26] will die if I don't give it to you for
[2:12:28] Wednesday night you'll be panicking
[2:12:29] three Witnesses in 1951 the prophet said
[2:12:32] there's a gift in the Church of
[2:12:33] discernment that's true but a prophetic
[2:12:37] gift
[2:12:38] is ordained before the foundation of the
[2:12:40] world greater than Solomon I want you to
[2:12:43] know my brothers and sisters you don't
[2:12:44] have to wait for some special advances
[2:12:46] to come no no your pastor has the same
[2:12:49] now he may not be able to have that
[2:12:51] prophetic gift
[2:12:53] that comes
[2:12:56] what'd he say
[2:12:59] one
[2:13:00] and a generation
[2:13:03] ah one and a generation this is why I'm
[2:13:07] not looking for a Malachi four and a
[2:13:09] half
[2:13:11] I'm not looking for another Prophet to
[2:13:13] come if you all feel sorry for you why
[2:13:16] we've done got the one that we needed
[2:13:19] is that right
[2:13:21] now he said
[2:13:22] but look he has the same rights to pray
[2:13:25] for you that I would that discernment
[2:13:27] doesn't heal you it only brings you God
[2:13:30] conscious
[2:13:32] that you're in the presence of God again
[2:13:34] now believe what I'm praying I'm going
[2:13:36] to pray for you in these passages see I
[2:13:37] don't want to leave the town people
[2:13:39] think well the Evangelist is here he did
[2:13:41] this I want you to know your pastor has
[2:13:43] the same Authority he might not see
[2:13:45] visions that may become one
[2:13:52] but he's got the same Authority from God
[2:13:56] you know brother Branham said brother
[2:13:57] Billy Paul saw these Visions just like
[2:13:59] him
[2:14:01] as a matter of fact brother REM said
[2:14:02] they'd be going down the road
[2:14:04] and Betty Paul would say there'll be a
[2:14:06] certain certain place he'll go around
[2:14:07] this curve and brothers and say stop
[2:14:09] let me finish it so Billy but see part
[2:14:12] of it and brother Brandon would tell the
[2:14:14] rest of it brother Adam said if he would
[2:14:16] commit himself to God
[2:14:18] we would be running two prayer lines
[2:14:24] you know I said that
[2:14:26] well he did
[2:14:28] it's amazing how those gifts can run in
[2:14:31] families
[2:14:33] and land on somebody that's not even
[2:14:35] called to do it
[2:14:38] I better close right now
[2:14:42] I'm as happy you come to church tonight
[2:14:45] the rest of you wish they'd went to
[2:14:46] Walmart huh
[2:14:51] and a rich another one now I want you to
[2:14:53] know my brothers sisters you don't have
[2:14:55] to wait for some special evanges to come
[2:14:56] he may not be able to have the prophetic
[2:14:58] gift that comes one or a generation now
[2:15:00] notice a greater than Solomon evangelist
[2:15:02] goes in town does all the praying all
[2:15:04] the baptizing then the people when he
[2:15:06] leaves well the pastor think their
[2:15:08] Pastor is nothing
[2:15:11] yeah
[2:15:12] your pastor is a man of God he said he
[2:15:15] lets you safe this far he can take you
[2:15:17] on
[2:15:18] he's an instructed man of God
[2:15:21] again he says identification of God has
[2:15:24] always been knowing can foresee what
[2:15:26] it's been until what it's been how it is
[2:15:28] and what it will be well that's how the
[2:15:30] prophets was known that's how Jesus was
[2:15:32] known as the Messiah he's the same
[2:15:34] Messiah today only without a Corporal
[2:15:36] body here on Earth he sent the spirit
[2:15:39] back to use your body and my body now
[2:15:41] you might not be able to do this
[2:15:44] we know in the scripture
[2:15:47] there is
[2:15:49] one
[2:15:51] in a generation trial Topeka I don't say
[2:15:54] your pastor or anybody will be taking
[2:15:58] this gift of discernment they don't have
[2:16:00] to do that that's not their calling
[2:16:03] that's not he repeats it that's not
[2:16:06] they're calling to do that that's to be
[2:16:10] one in an age
[2:16:15] you say oh my goodness without ought to
[2:16:18] relieve every one of us
[2:16:20] none of us has to try to be like brother
[2:16:23] Bradham no preacher no evangelist no
[2:16:27] teacher none of us
[2:16:28] would just be what God made us
[2:16:33] and that's all we have to answer for
[2:16:37] and the church said
[2:16:39] and they loves him with all your heart
[2:16:42] God bless you let's bow our heads
[2:16:49] Heavenly Father
[2:16:52] we know it's an amazing thing how people
[2:16:54] are
[2:16:56] it was the Curiosity of Eve
[2:16:59] in the Garden of Eden about her position
[2:17:03] that begin to pull her into questions
[2:17:06] and pull her into a sphere
[2:17:09] that she did not belong in
[2:17:12] that she stayed in her place mind her
[2:17:14] own businesses would say we certainly
[2:17:17] wouldn't be where we are today
[2:17:19] the Lord is that Curiosity
[2:17:22] and it still works on people today
[2:17:25] father I pray in the name of Jesus you
[2:17:27] would help each of us
[2:17:29] there's Minister standing here tonight
[2:17:31] Lord there's deacons and trustees and
[2:17:33] lay folks and all kinds of people that
[2:17:36] will stream this and
[2:17:38] I pray that she'd help each of us to be
[2:17:40] able to find what you want us to be
[2:17:43] and Lord if it's a housewife if it's a
[2:17:46] farmer if it's a factory worker a
[2:17:47] painter an electrician a musician a cook
[2:17:51] Chef whatever it is Lord a nurse a
[2:17:54] doctor would just be what you've gifted
[2:17:56] us to be we do it faithfully and we'll
[2:18:00] answer to you at that day
[2:18:02] all we know Satan will always try to
[2:18:05] make us compare ourselves
[2:18:08] but we'll look at it in a week or so
[2:18:10] that Paul said they that compare
[2:18:13] themselves by themselves or among
[2:18:16] themselves are not wise
[2:18:19] so he said we compare according to the
[2:18:23] rod
[2:18:24] that God has measured Us by
[2:18:29] so Paul believed there was an allotment
[2:18:32] even to preachers
[2:18:34] they were given boundaries they were
[2:18:37] given a call they were given gifts
[2:18:41] and they themselves were to work in the
[2:18:43] confines of what you had given them
[2:18:47] Lord May each of us tonight realize that
[2:18:50] Lord some people feel so bad because
[2:18:52] they see others shouting and they don't
[2:18:55] shout and they think God must not love
[2:18:57] me I must not have got anything
[2:19:00] Lord boy they may not shout tonight
[2:19:01] maybe Sunday will be their time and it
[2:19:03] may be a week it may be a month
[2:19:06] but Lord we always want to be like the
[2:19:08] next person
[2:19:09] Ephraim grows corn we think we ought to
[2:19:11] grow corn Reuben grows cane we think we
[2:19:15] ought to go Cain
[2:19:16] oh Lord help us just to be what you've
[2:19:19] called us to be
[2:19:21] Lord God we love you today
[2:19:24] we're asking father that should forgive
[2:19:26] us of our Wasted Years
[2:19:28] of our wasted moments and weeks Lord God
[2:19:32] that we founded around our time
[2:19:35] thinking and wishing we were this and
[2:19:37] that and the other
[2:19:39] Lord and may we just find what you want
[2:19:41] us to be and be that Faithfully with all
[2:19:44] of our hearts
[2:19:46] Lord help us
[2:19:48] we love you tonight father
[2:19:50] how many let you be remembered that way
[2:19:52] before the Lord
[2:19:55] oh Hallelujah
[2:19:57] some of you may not be a preacher that
[2:19:59] will go out and preach great conventions
[2:20:02] some of you may not be a preacher
[2:20:03] that'll preach full time and maybe be
[2:20:06] gone 25 30 weekends a year you may not
[2:20:10] preached about a half a dozen dozen
[2:20:12] times a year but if that was my gift I'd
[2:20:15] rather preach that and be faithful than
[2:20:17] to try to make myself something
[2:20:20] that I'm not
[2:20:22] and if God's calls you to preach 30-week
[2:20:24] weeks out of the year you better not sit
[2:20:26] down buddy and try to preach five
[2:20:28] because you'll get in trouble Jonah
[2:20:31] it's so hard for us
[2:20:33] to just find what God has made us to be
[2:20:37] and somehow be satisfied I know it may
[2:20:40] sound crazy to you but a lot of the
[2:20:42] folks who God's attribute to them a
[2:20:44] small portion they want to be greater
[2:20:46] and most of the ones that I know
[2:20:48] personally that God has laid on them a
[2:20:51] great load and a great responsibility
[2:20:53] and a great burden they would to God it
[2:20:55] wasn't theirs
[2:20:56] they want to be less
[2:20:58] it's amazing how we are isn't it
[2:21:01] we either want to be less than what God
[2:21:03] made us to be or more than what God made
[2:21:05] us to be is there anybody that just
[2:21:08] wants to be what God made us to be
[2:21:11] brother brother Don do you fight that
[2:21:13] yep I'm that other guy
[2:21:15] I'm that other guy
[2:21:17] I wish nobody knew my name
[2:21:20] I wish people around the world didn't
[2:21:21] know me
[2:21:23] if it's looked up to me you think I'd
[2:21:26] still be here no I'll be down in
[2:21:28] Monticello Kentucky where I started that
[2:21:29] little church about 1982. that's still
[2:21:32] where I'd be I was down there I was as
[2:21:34] happy as I could be nobody hardly knew
[2:21:36] me I come with a message once your
[2:21:37] brother Charlie Cox at church then
[2:21:39] brother started meeting me and from
[2:21:41] there the trouble started
[2:21:44] I was so happy oh my goodness we just
[2:21:46] went to church and we thought my
[2:21:48] goodness glory to God I thought we was
[2:21:50] at the end I thought was probably the
[2:21:52] last ones to come to the message now you
[2:21:53] are you're so ignorant I just thought we
[2:21:55] was the last once I went to the bank and
[2:21:56] borrowed a bunch of money went to
[2:21:58] Jeffersonville and bought up as much
[2:21:59] tapes as I could afford I started
[2:22:01] listening to them day and night day and
[2:22:03] night day and night landing the message
[2:22:06] and then somebody heard me preach
[2:22:09] and then somebody else and then somebody
[2:22:11] else
[2:22:12] and you know the rest of the start
[2:22:17] and you think I want that
[2:22:20] I told God just the other day I said why
[2:22:22] didn't you leave me alone
[2:22:23] why don't you just leave me alone
[2:22:26] just leave me in Kentucky and leave me
[2:22:28] alone
[2:22:30] you say brother Tony would you say that
[2:22:32] yes
[2:22:33] I'm being totally honest
[2:22:36] why
[2:22:40] I don't want to be hated and despised
[2:22:45] I don't want to be there
[2:22:47] another portal Nets I mean poor old good
[2:22:50] brothers that
[2:22:51] they want to be this and they say are
[2:22:54] you out of your mind
[2:22:57] I'll tell you one thing a man that wants
[2:22:59] to be a pastor either he's called or
[2:23:01] he's out of his mind
[2:23:02] a man that wants to be a preacher he's
[2:23:04] either out of his mind or genuinely
[2:23:06] called
[2:23:07] I think that's what it is brother Jack
[2:23:10] oh children
[2:23:12] let God help us
[2:23:14] that God help us
[2:23:16] that we can get in our sight remember
[2:23:18] Joel prophesied about this Army he said
[2:23:21] they would not break their ranks
[2:23:26] there won't be one person going in the
[2:23:28] Rapture who will break Divine ranks
[2:23:32] and make the rapture
[2:23:34] because the prophecy does not allow
[2:23:36] breaking of ranks
[2:23:39] if they're supposed to be here they
[2:23:41] better be here if they're supposed to be
[2:23:43] there they better be there if they're
[2:23:45] supposed to be there they better be
[2:23:47] there that's part of them knowing who
[2:23:49] God is
[2:23:50] and knowing who they are
[2:23:54] praise the Lord
[2:23:56] Harry get us out of this mess
[2:23:58] saying something that'll lift them up

[2:24:11] absolutely wonderful what the Lord is
[2:24:13] doing let's just worship him a little
[2:24:15] bit together now just meditate on these
[2:24:17] things you young Brothers young sisters
[2:24:20] all of us
[2:24:22] what's God wants you to do
[2:24:24] what's God called you today you may not
[2:24:27] know right now maybe six months maybe a
[2:24:29] year maybe two
[2:24:30] well what am I supposed to do until that
[2:24:32] time read your Bible pray come to church
[2:24:35] see a piece of paper on the parking lot
[2:24:37] pick it up
[2:24:39] well you say my goodness let me tell you
[2:24:42] one thing
[2:24:43] I try preachers when they say they're
[2:24:45] called to preach
[2:24:46] and if they're too big to preach at a
[2:24:49] youth service they ain't taking a Sunday
[2:24:51] morning service for me
[2:24:53] they're too big for the britches already
[2:24:56] if you can't start on the bottom you'll
[2:24:59] break your neck trying to climb the
[2:25:00] ladder at the top
[2:25:02] well come on now if a man's called to
[2:25:05] preach he'll preach to one if he has to
[2:25:08] is that right
[2:25:09] because you know that God has a call for
[2:25:12] you and you're willing to start at the
[2:25:14] bottom and work your way up that's the
[2:25:17] way God does it

[2:32:18] have recalled the savior's weren't so
[2:32:21] true if you won't be ashamed of me I

[2:32:43] for me

[2:34:04] Grace
[2:34:06] and someday soon I'll have the chance to
[2:34:11] thank him face to face
