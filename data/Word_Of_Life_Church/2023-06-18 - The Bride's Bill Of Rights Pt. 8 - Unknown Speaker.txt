because eventually what we found out this brother walked away from this truth he was a beacon in this message proclaiming this message the brother that that made me aware of this sent me a screenshot of the brother he was sitting behind me and you could just see it and I watched the the segment of the video he didn't like it one bit so it makes the devil man it makes me glad so I'm going to sing

everything about it I don't but I know what it did to me behold I send you Elijah the prophet as I've declared before God identified me before he identified William Branham behold I send you praise

angry no one could ever take my joy away you know what I've done I have stepped into the vision is the way I'm certain kids seeing time Revelation spoken word prophecy of Malachi 4. [Music] oh here in this evening time God promised that his little light would shine to illuminate my path and make my way clear but those Corner ones only deified to one who was prophesied to turn back the heart to the original way but I can only jump and shine be because [Music] they are the highest keep it great know what could ever no one's gonna ever take much away cause I'm set into the vision this way I'm certain known it's the inside Revelations listen devil whoa here in this evening time God promise that his light would shine to illuminate my path and make my way clean but those carnal ones only deify this one who was prophesied [Music] but I'm only gonna jump and Shout because my soul is stirred it can only be this great history these Mysteries I've stepped into the vision this way I'm searching it's in time Revelation spoken word [Music] my life has changed Revelations [Music] [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord we're so glad to be a part of this in time prophecy amen God bless you we greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus what a privilege it is for us to be gathered together once again the house of God let's turn to the Book of Psalms if you would today Psalms 37 and 3. to wish all of our fathers are happy Father's Day may God bless you appreciate our fathers if you weren't for our fathers we wouldn't be here would we I know we're living in that age probably a couple years goes on this holiday will probably outlawed won't it Father's Day Mother's Day I guess it'll be its day I'm not sure exactly how they're going to take care of all that but since we still believe the Bible we still have the proper pronouns him his hers all right it's so glad that I'm just so glad today to still be in my right mind we're living in a world that's totally insane totally insane Psalms 37 3. trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give Thee the desires of thine heart we believe this is true it will give the desires of thine heart Romans chapter 8 verse 16. the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God let me just share this with you I was reading it to Carol last night it's a studying for today in the talmud which is part of the on the ancient Hebrew books whenever a boy or a girl had reached the age that they were weaned they would time that about the same time frame that they could be able to talk so they would begin to recognize who their father was who their mother was so they called father Abba and mother EMA so Abba and Iman so can you imagine when the Lord Jesus began to teach his disciples how to pray and whenever he told them now this is what you're supposed to say our we say English father but acts in the Hebrew it would have been Abba our Abba which art in heaven now to a Jew hearing this it would have been blasphemy to call God your daddy which is what Abba means daddy EMA means Mommy so to call God your daddy the apostles themselves must have been overwhelmed when they heard Jesus pray this way I'm so glad we can pray that way so the spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God now if we are children then this is what we get and if children then heirs Heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be that would Shout with him oh we heal the sick we raise the dead we jump we run we scream we holler no we believe in that too but if so be that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together wow second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10. listen to contrast that Paul himself faced as a Believer as a Christian as a messenger as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things I'm glad I can see that same world today aren't you I may like to be remembered as we pray today just hold your request in your heart Abba Daddy Papa we counted such a privilege that we can call you our father today we love you so much we're so grateful that you love us as we hear in our Earth today set this day aside for Father's Day and I know just because a man biologically can father a child certainly doesn't mean he's much of a father many fathers would disown their children and have but you will never disown one of yours Lord Jesus we so love you today and we're grateful for what you've done for us we thank you for becoming one of us that you could make us like you as we Endeavor to look into your word today I pray that you would help us you see our needs there are many but our God is so much greater than all of our needs we pray Lord that you would heal the sick that you would encourage those that are weary those father that maybe don't know you in the building today if there would be one may they find you those that don't have the Holy Ghost those that just need a refilling whatever their needs are would you be mindful of us today Father help me that I can get out of the way to be able to speak the words of life to your people Grant it Lord and when it's all said and done we'll give you all the praise and the glory today in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I've been speaking to you about the bride's Bill of Rights I hope you've been enjoying it blessed by it as I've looked at this I've studied this before but I've got to say there's a lot that I've found out about it that apparently I'd overlooked before where it was in time or the season for it for me but as I begin to study I've realized how many things that God had his Prophet to say that was our rights and what is children of God that we are heirs to and I've found it so amazing as I begin to look at it and kind of look historically back a little bit and see what Paul said to the Believers in his age and then when you study somewhat and what irania said and the different Church age Messengers as Luther said to his group what Wesley said to his and then you see how much more that the Lord had our Messenger to say to us than was ever said to any other group of Believers in any church age and then you think about that why would God so increase the quantity of what was said and the quality of what was said and as I was thinking about it early this morning as I was a week before daylight and just pondering about it and it just was made so real to me that God knew exactly that living in this age of such terrible darkness and sadness and sickness and disease and trouble and turmoil that our world is in that we would actually need more said to us and about us than any other age that has ever been when you think of how God in his Mercy would cover us with his protective wings of his mercy and give us promises that has never been said to any other Generation Now Paul was very eloquent of course and the words that he used and very blessed of God to be able to speak many languages and to be able to bring it in such a wonderful way other men of God down through the age but yet when you look in comparison to all that we have they had so very little and yet they would go to church say today and by next week they would have lost their head they would have went to church today them maybe their wives their children would absolutely be thrown into the lines and they would have been eaten they would have been totally annihilated but the volume and the amount of word that God gave them was so much less than us and you look at that and you think God and His abundant love and mercy has given to us so much because he knew we was going to need it I don't mind telling you I need it more than I've ever needed it in my life anybody here with me because we realize we're living in such a time of darkness and Trauma and everywhere we look we look at our nation we look at our world and we see the things that our government is doing our leaders are doing I read just yesterday where that a pastor in Germany had stood up in his church and said that God was a queer he said it's time that we become inclusive and we start letting people know you don't have to change from what you are that God loves you as you are well if he loves you as you are and accepts you as you are the cross was in vain oh sure he loves you but he wants to change you from what you are to what he wants you to be I know that's not very popular but it's the truce anyhow and we know that it's becoming greater and greater and the Darkness and we can see that the powers of hell are aiming at our children like never before is that right and whenever we look about and we see that our nation and the world is gone it reminds me so much as I've studied some historically about the empires that live thousands of years ago and when you look at the Babylonian Empire and the Assyrian Empire and the Roman Empires it changed from a republic to become an Empire and you see that much of what America is falling in line with is not the great great things that God set forth as a nation but they're following in the track of the Babylonian Empire the Assyrian Empire the exact same state of Rome now when Rome started out it was a mighty thing just a city that become a republic and then of course it grew into an Empire but you look and see what eroded Rome and you study it and you can see some of the same things are eroding our great nation oh I know the pundits still called it the greatest nation in the world and truly at one time it was but she fastly so fastly is losing day by day her identification as a superpower we can see it that China is stepping up and taking over what we were Iran is stepping up and taking over what we were don't you understand why Russia is going to be empowered by a weak leadership in our nation and they will feel that they will be able to take us on and defeat us but I'm so glad when the bombs go to fine I would have already flew the coop I'm so glad I don't care what they do to the world what they do how many names that they write our nation's name on it ain't going to hinder me at all because I'm not going to be here by the grace of God and God knew that before the time of the Rapture would actually come that we would face so much stuff and we know that we've gone already over into the grace period of the links of our church age and the prophet could only see as far as he could see by Vision was around 1977 which is why he made the prediction that the end would come because he could only see to 77 as far as he would be able to be allowed to peer into the timeline and then it would become so dark that he couldn't even see beyond that and that he would say I do not prophesy but I predict that it will come by 1977. so we see that we've been lived even these years beyond that to where it was total darkness how many knows that's where we are and an hour of such darkness that is on the earth now even though our lives are not participating in that Darkness we're not drinking we're not running around and doing what the world does but because it is such a predominant Factor we deal with it every day of our lives and we need such encouragement from the word and such encouragement from one another as a body do we not so God knew and this is why that he would have his word written down so that it would not cease to exist out to the first generation and then what did God do in this day he allowed his prophet's voice to be able to be recorded oh how I thank God for that we are the only church aides that ever lived that I to their Prophet had been gone off the scene for decades that the followers of that message would be able to still hear their prophet's voice you are a blessed people so we can be able to go back and hear the Rapture the way it was preached in 1965. now God did that for a reason and I'll tell you the reason God did not do it was so that it would replace church God never done it for the reason that people would stay home and say they don't need to go to the house of God that's right but God did it for us so we would be able to hear his voice it's one thing to read a book but it's another thing to be able to hear the voice of that man and the pronunciation and the emphasis and so on that he would put on the statements that he would make and he would say terms about us and things about us that no other messenger said about his people it would even unfold to the year of 1965 and God would allow brother random to start using the words about a predestinated sea and a seed in your soul which he had never used from 56 on up to 64. never used it from 47 faith is the substance the verse first service that we have recorded all of that span of time he never used certain words that he was allowed to use the last few months of his life in 1965. and the culmination of the bride's identity he was building greater and greater and it wasn't just for those people that were there but it was for us those of us that have come in the footsteps of those that have laid down the past and I'll tell you for one I appreciate our predecessors and the founding fathers that have taken this message on where would we be today were it not for those I told one of the brothers the other day as brother Jerry Phillips I was talking about his father and his family and some of those that was part of the founding of this church right here over on Rome Hill where would we be today because I never started this church I inherited something that was started by others and if time goes on it will be the same thing we will hand it on to another generation so what do we want to hand them we want to hand them something that is word based Spirit fed spirit filled that still believes the doctrine just like the apostles did in the book of the relax is that right we don't want to hand our children some cold dead form that all they do is go to church and get our religion done and then we go I have a little cake and a little coffee together but we want our children to know there is a living Resurrection Lord Jesus he is the same yesterday today and forever if it goes on another 50 years we want them to be able to hand to their children and their children that there is a living God that we're not serving some dead cold form but we are serving a resurrected Lord Jesus [Applause] in that God knew that the bride would need such encouragement how grateful I am for our founding fathers that in the 1700s would be able to make the amendments to the Constitution and address what they call a Bill of Rights which would give us freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom to be able to express a difference and our leaders would not be able to be as it was with the Kings by which they had left England and come here and establish what we know commonly today as our Bill of Rights it's had many amendments of course since it was founded and no doubt it will continue to go on and I look at the message of the hour not as a replacement of the Bible any more than I look at the Bill of Rights as being a replacement of the Constitution now listen to me carefully so you'll understand the Constitution was set up first originally signed by the founding fathers but then they saw a little lack there that they needed to add what they call the Bill of Rights so in there the Constitution would Define great things by which the nation would be founded but individual identity they did not deal with it so much in the Constitution and after looking at it they felt like they needed to add some amendments and therefore they wrote this and called it the Bill of Rights I don't know about you I'm glad they did we understand now in the direction that a lot of our government is going right now that they're trying to take your weapons from you and eventually they will shut you down they've already got the ability to do it maybe not by law but by pressure and this is why a lot of our corporations are going woke in the day that we live in because they've got to please not the majority but the minority but the reason as I said on Wednesday night that we are not joining the won't move it's because we have already woke up but we not waking up to the transgender we woke up to the Lord Jesus and his power so we're not part of that move and we're not interested in what they are doing but we are interested in our rights how many knows that you must know your rights as an American citizen so if they show up here today and say we've come to arrest you especially that loud mouth preacher you got in there and you all cannot have church Wednesday night well we know what we're going to do we're going to get us one of the best lawyers that we can afford and he's going to stand right there and say you have no right to shut them up but he blasted the transgender we've got him saying that yeah and so far it's my rights to do so and I'm going to continue to do so and if they make it illegal I'll still do it anyway well brother Donnie will be sold in jail won't be the first time I've been in prison at least this time I was on that side of the bars next time I might be on the other side but I'll still be preaching this same gospel because he is the same yesterday today and forever so God wants his people to be able to understand their rights so they can be able to stand up and claim what they are I love the way Paul says this in Romans 8 16 for the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children now notice the littlest two-letter word if children if children then heirs so another right that we as the bride have is the right to be an heir now most of us are not rich people we're not wealthy people and if we would get a little thing when my mom and daddy died they didn't have already anything we sold their place and they each one of us wound up of the couple thousand dollars a piece something like that and that was pretty much it it wasn't that much I got a little bit more because Mom and Daddy have bought our place in Kentucky and had never paid us for it because that's poor and they couldn't afford to do it so they put it in their will that I was supposed to be paid for them now I didn't get no more because I was the firstborn I just got my portion like Harry and like the rest of my sisters and my other brother but I was not you know even though it wasn't that much neither was into the rest of my siblings going to say well I really don't want mine we all know how people are when it comes to money now people will fall out with one another when it comes to money and material Goods oh I realized I broke the amen channel right there so people will will fight they will separate with friends with family when it comes to money and that that's mine that's mine I've got to write to that and yet when it comes to our spiritual rights it's a real shame to me that we let the devil kick us around like a tin can down the road we let him stomp us we let him talk us out of our blessing and if it was a thousand dollars you'd stand there saying this is my thousand daddy wanted me to heaven and you ain't getting it Bubby I love you sister but that's my thousand how much more are you to stand for your rights in Jesus Christ not just for a hundred dollars or five hundred dollars but to be able to stand for what the Lord God has made for you he paid the ultimate price so if children then air so if we are heirs we will be treated as Sons and Daughters of God and Heir is one who is able to become a part of understatement now I want you to notice now the way that Paul mentions this and if children then heirs notice what your heir of heirs of God so what you get is God notice he doesn't say Heirs of His blessings Heirs of his peace Heirs of his healing to the bride she gets God Heirs of God so what did you inherit from your mother your father your grandpa your uncle well I'm Heirs of his estate well he had him a call attractor he had an old mule named Bob and he had a lamb named Susie and he had you know this and that and the other well you become Heirs of what he had well God give us what heirs we are Heirs of God so I inherited God wow hello I inherited God you inherited God deity predestinated seed eternal life now can't you see the difference between the bride and the church that the bride and herods God but what does the church get salvation from God what does the church get oh they get healing they did a lot of blessings y'all that's all well and good and they say thank the Lord the Lord blesses my business and the Lord does this for me and that's for me that's all well and good but the bride gets God Not His blessings I don't just want his gifts I want him and if I get him I get gifts too now notice so then we are Heirs of God so God himself is his greatest gift the loftiest blessing that we could ever inherit is to be able to inherit God so we receive as our portion God so my portion your portion as Believers is not well praise the Lord I got saved and I've got the gift of healing and I've got the gift of faith and and I got set free from smoking oh that's wonderful to testify there thank God for that but what is your inheritance what is your portion well I got salvation well that's good but what what about the Savior did you get him well I got salvation and I I got this and I got that notice what a lot of people thank God for I thank God for healing me that's good we ought to thank it for that and then many of them will get healed and they go right back to living a sinful lot you know why that God is blessing and apparently didn't get healed but the bride gets him which means she gets everything inclusive with him so our father is our portion now a human father can disinherit his son or his daughter so the son would do something to make Daddy mad and daddy makes a different will and then he goes right ahead and he leaves Paul out of the will or Donnie or whoevermore and he says why do you made me mad I'm taken away from him I was going to give him this and I was going to give him Bob The Mule I ain't giving him nothing now I was going to give him this that I ain't giving him us and I disinherit him I'm giving all the Donnie's portion to Harry but almighty God cannot by his own sovereignty ever Oh Glory ever gets on one of his own attributes totally impossible now notice he says sinner for your children we are Heirs of God and Joint heirs notice how he says this joint heirs with joint heirs with Christ so what did Christ get God so I want you to notice this must have been overwhelming to the people of that day when they heard this and them knowing the laws of adoption of course and the way that they was able to receive an inheritance that Paul would say that we aired God and then we are joint heirs with Christ and he put Christ on a basis of Brotherhood with the rest of the family of God oh so you mean us and Jesus get the same portion we are join heirs joint heirs equivalent basis joint heirs with Christ and somebody said it shall be that would suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so partaking of the same eternal glory I want you to notice this those of you that are familiar with the Bible you know this in second Chronicles chapter 21 verse 3 when he's speaking about Jehoshaphat and their father gave them great gifts of silver so Jehoshaphat now has many sons and what Jehoshaphat does he divides his kingdom and his riches and his treasure among his household or his family so to one son he gave him the entire Kingdom to the rest of the sons listen what they get and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and the precious things and fenced cities in Judah but the kingdom gave he to johoram because he was the firstborn you mean so all of them had the same Daddy so Jehoshaphat is the father of all of these boys but johoram got the entire Kingdom and what these other guys got was a little bit of silver and a little bit ago and a little town over here a fenced City a fenced walled up denominational City I'm glad that's not my inheritance now some of y'all been there you know what I'm talking about well man those people be safe they will be saved but I'm glad I didn't get a fan City I got a free country a free message of the hour so notice what the Bible says then but the kingdom the kingdom gave heed to johoram because he was the firstborn so the Lord Jesus was the firstborn of God what do you mean brother Donnie well he was the beginning of all things in him was life and the life was a light of men and all things were made by him and was not anything made that was not made by him so he was the very existence of the Eternal coming into an expression of time you follow me so far so God wanted to make himself tangible so God gave birth to a son not a little boy not an inferior God but the word so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the word was God and the same is in the beginning was God all things were created by Him is that right so God gave birth to his word so how did that come about he spoke and when God spoke that was giving birth to the firstborn of the new creation of God so God gave birth to a son now keep in mind God was not an old man and then God somehow created a young man God was the invisible as Paul said now unto the Eternal invisible Immortal only wise God be Dominion power and Glory forever so God gave birth to a son I ain't making this up as question answer 1953 if you'd like to check it out so God gave birth to a son which was the expression of his word that sign would have been the heir of all things but that son that Humanity of God later came to the Earth and he said I want to share everything I have was my brothers I was made the executor of my mother and father's will by the law of the state of Kentucky I could have taken a larger portion that's the law but I love my brothers and sisters and I didn't want that portion to separate us for the rest of our life I didn't figure I deserved it no way but by law I could have done so so the firstborn the right to the firstborn the Lord Jesus could have kept all the healing all the mercy all the deity all the power all our Glory all the glory but instead of him wanting to keep it for himself he said I want my brothers I want my sisters to share with my glory I want them to Bow the weight of eternal glory so he said that he anoints Paul you imagine Paul must have been so overwhelmed with him even when the spirit of God struck him and he wrote this down and remember Paul had no other scriptures to reference this Swiss to check and make sure that what he was saying lined up with the Bible nobody else said this but Paul well I'm sorry you didn't know that nobody else said this you see I believe that a prophet of God not only interprets the written word but a prophet of God is called to be able to write down that which is not even yet written if you don't believe that you don't believe your Bible because Paul wrote things in the New Testament that neither Peter James John no none of the rest of them wrote nor did they write in the Old Testament and verify well come on Saints it's the truth so God wanted himself to be able to share this Glory with us now notice in Galatians 3 29 if ye be Christ which is not plural but possessive then we ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise again Titus 3 7 that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life Hebrews 1 14 are not all they ministering Spirits talking about angels now listen this who are sin Force to minister to them who shall be Heirs of Salvation so the angels of God are sent to minister to you to be Heirs of Salvation eternal life and the blessings of God James 2 5 how can my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and Heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love in First Peter 3 7 the advice to married people likewise your husbands dwell with him speaking of the wives according to knowledge give honor unto the wife as into the weaker vessel as being heirs together of the grace of life heirs together of the grace what a beautiful passage of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so God don't want us to be able to just walk around down on the earth and while I'm saved and I don't guess I'll get nothing else till I get there he actually wants us to enjoy his kingdom while we're going that way now listen as brother random says it this way you know if I bought a home and it was mine and I go through the thing and see what I had I'm just kind of a prospector I like to dig around and find out what a God I'm an heir of Salvation I'm an heir to Divine Healing I'm an heir of heaven I'm an heir to the Earth I'm an heir a joint Heir with Christ in all things that I like to look through his book to Prospect and see what all I'm an heir to so that's what you need to do when you read your Bible is you're looking through your Bible it is your personal gold mine so you want to read through there and find out what belongs to you as a Believer well brother Donnie will it fall right out of heaven right in my lap no you'll have to fight for every inch of the ground you get notice again in Abraham said your heir to it air of Salvation air Divine Healing air of every Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for you are the heir to it for you are Abraham's see and you're an heir of the whole thing oh my goodness the world better enjoy this Earth while they got it because we're fixing to take it over again in Jehovah Jireh I am an heir to all things through Christ I'm an heir to my healing I'm an heir to my joy I'm an heir of Salvation purchased of God born of the spirit washed in the blood yes sir I'm an heir I'm a child of the king I'm a Son of God everything that God promised is mine I'm a joint Heir with the Lord Jesus amen [Applause] now I'm gonna see how many of you'll say Amen to this possessing all things in 1962. did you notice here in second Corinthians Paul said even of death we possessed death s don't possess you you possess it it is not your master he said death come to get him when he was setting up on that and he shot that rifle and it exploded he said but Jesus sent him back empty-handed I wonder how many times death has come to get you with a sickness or a food or a car wreck or whatever more and deaths come to get you and Jesus said oh I know this it ain't his time yet it ain't her time yet back off death back off all glory to God why because we even possess yes and the grave oh well Glory said I've done forgot about that explosion of that gun he said Why didn't it kill me because it couldn't God wasn't ready he'd come as much as he wants to but he can't take you Gloria I paid my debt for that a long time ago when I believed on Jesus Christ who's alive forever more now death listens to what we say so if the devil tries to take it you say hey buddy listen to me I'm not leaving this world until my father says it's time for me to come home but I'm a cancer I'm a TV I don't care what you are you are not going to take my life until Jesus Christ is ready for me to go because I possess deaths not death possessing me you say a possessor of death that's why Paul said here in Corinthians death we even possess it well when they was fixing to cut his head off he said oh death where is your sting show me where you can scare me death said I'll squeeze you down and put you in the grave and you're rot and Canker and Paul said but thanks be to God who gives me the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ a grave listen that is what he said I I thought that one time hell possessed you and you lived under the influence of hell but not no more you possess it and you say out of my way hell out of my way death out of my way Garden if you ain't got no claim on me oh praise the Lord I'm an heir of Divine Healing I'm an heir of Joy how many needs more joy in your life friends we are living in a sad time we're living in a sad World we're living in a very sad sad time and the age of we're living when there's so much Darkness all around us and Christians find it hard to be happy I know I know me too you see so much sickness and you see so Much Death and so much heartbreaking so much going on but I still believe we can have joy right in the middle of Trials I believe we can have joy unspeakable and full of Glory right whatever things are going wrong and upside down it seems like listen what brother Graham said I'm an heir of Joy I've got a right to be happy wow I've got a right to be happy you say you're right bill John is that your right sisters is that your right Brothers so you're gonna let the devil stealing from you now listen I love the way he answers himself he said I've got a right to be happy so he said in the form of a question so what makes you so happy this is this simple tremendous answer I've got to write to me [Applause] so it had nothing to do with the temperature had nothing to do with the weather I had nothing to do with the thermostat on the wall if you'd like to froze to death in church or burn up like I'm doing right now it had nothing to do with Mama didn't fix your favorite breakfast for Father's day it had nothing to do with your job it had nothing to do to understand why we base so much of our happiness on things that are around us instead of basing it upon this one thing you've got a right to be happy that's why you can be happy because the Lord Jesus purchased your right why he was happy himself and he said I want to share my happiness with my family so he says children I'm gonna give you a right here you go I'm going to give you a rival show oh Lord who am I going to be happy whoever's going to be happy cause I give you this right to be happy oh okay yeah okay I'm going to be happy because because he gave me the right you see for most of us we don't understand it we're constantly controlled by the things that are around us praise mother Donnie oh God so what makes you so happy I got a right to be how do you know because I'm an heir to it amen he says now I feel religious almond air to happiness I'm an heir to Joy I'm an heir to peace I'm an heir to eternal life I'm an heir to the Holy Spirit I'm an heir to every evidence it's got I am an heir to the authority of God who made you that not me he did every one of you is an heir to the same thing wow notice he says I am an heir to a throne he that overcome us shall set with me and my son as I have overcome and sit down with my father in his throne an heir to all things not just one thing all things everything's under your feet this is going to take an understanding from God to help you to comprehend what I'm fixing to read to you even death is under your feet the grave is under your feet hell is under your feet sin is under your feet everything is under your feet you are an heir you are dead and your life is hid in Christ through God there you Rose again to eternal life setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and he says that again he's getting Plum beside himself honey call us anything you want to say we're crazy if you want to but we are heirs heirs to what all things all right brother Donny I've been waiting now for 37 years because actually I had a great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great uncle that was part of the Campbell Soup Corporation and uh his estate has been in the courts you know for about 385 years now something like that and I'm just waiting for the day when I'm going to get my money and then I'm going to change my life I'll tell you one thing I'm going to buy me a house I'm going to buy me a car I'm going to do this and other if I was you I'd get a job and forget about the Campbell Soup thing just go to the store and buy you one just go ahead and buy you one more like even if you was an heir it's been so long you'll never see one dime of it because them lawyers will get most every bit of it anyhow oh but brother sister we are set up in such a way that the Lord God became our personal lawyer so there ain't no crooked lawyers in this deal he became our personal lawyer he don't want no cut he don't want no commission what he wants is for you to have everything that hides your name on it healing and joy and power and peace all that I find so much depression you don't have to you don't have to be depressed of the devil you can have joy you can have peace you can have happiness you can be so filled with the Holy Ghost that the devil don't even know what to do with you thank you I love this in the church age book don't fear John don't fear little flock all that I am your heir to all my power my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love courage and ability

experience you got more than an experience you got God he has power is ours his omnipotence so what happens when two omnipotents meet [Applause] but instead we sat around well we're going to go to church today I don't know I'm awful down I'm awful low how about a bad week sounds like you rented go to church bath that's the best time to go to church and you don't feel like going to church because if you go to church you might get something from church for that church oh but I think I might go to their own Mountain go to the wrong Mountain I actually go to church and it'll be a whole lot prettier to you what I think will go down and we'll go down to Dollywood and just have a day off come here and fight the devil then go to Dollywood and it'll be a much better day why because you will get quick into what you are and who you are in Christ Jesus and you can see this is my right I'm sick of the devil stealing my joy I'm sick of the devil putting depression on me I'm sick of the devil making me so sad I'm fed up for the devil I'm fed up when the devil get out of here hallelujah hallelujah email listen there's anything that Satan's put on you in the way of sickness or whatever it is ever born again person has an abstract warrant now not a title deed but a warrant for for what for the devil's arrest of course he won't fly into the courthouse the way Trump didn't either his great big old 7-6 December or whatever it was it is a flying an arm to all the splendors all the glory when the Lord gets down to the Devil he's going to fry his hiding hell I told him not long ago I'll be so glad when you ain't no more cause you are a liar and you are a thief and you are a deceiver and when you ain't no more I still will be when there ain't no more cancer you will be when there ain't no more trouble you will be and we want to serve a warn on the devil today every born-again person has an abstract warrant a warrant from God and the Holy Spirit is here to put any devil out no matter if he's cancer tumor cataract whatever it is the holy spirit will put him out if you'll serve notice on him in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] so you've got the warrant the promise of God in your heart and you say back off devil here's my warrant you have trespassed on my body you stole cells in my body you stole the peace from my mind you stole the peace from our family I've got the warrant right here in the name of Jesus get out you hear so much of in the day that we're living that if you abandon your house or your apartment or you're taking a tour say to Rome wherever and you're gone for so many days our crazy government has given a lot of these people a right to go in and move in your house and they call it squatters rights and once they get in it's nearly impossible to get them out because you abandoned your house and you was gone somewhere well this I've got the title d right here it's mine but you were gone and you was gone long enough to get this squatter a right y'all heard of that I've been reading some of the stories about what they've been doing to get rid of some of them squatters I thought aha sounds like something we might need to do to the devil well some of them hook up an electric cord to the doorknob yeah there's all kinds of things you can do by law to get rid of that squatter well that's the way it's done some of your homes that's the way he's done some of your bodies he's moved in and said well he like me she let me they allowed me to do it you need to hook up not 110 but a holy ghost power of God to the doorknob and when the devil touches that door and say I'm going back what in the world had me baptism of the Holy Ghost entire out of here devil get on back to Hell leave my body alone leave my daughter alone brother Donnie the Elder you get I believe the crazier you're getting well good [Applause] other when you got a courage enough to step up and toe to toe the line with the devil and scapped him off what a great theological term if I went to my house tonight and I got a legal Deed from my house and if I went in there someone was laying in there drinking and carrying on I'd say you have no right to get out get out of here friend well that say this is a house for human beings I've got a right to be here I'd say you do not I possess this house it's mine will it say I've got it right to stop sickness enter the body or ascend so while the other ones drank the others do this or that or the other but he has no legal rights I can take my abstract deed and go down to the courts and say look at here someone has moved in here that doesn't belong here and this is mine it belongs to me and the law would come up and put them out because I have an abstract written deed to the property brother and sister we have an abstract written deed tonight to Salvation to Divine Healing and the devil has no rights no rights trust God and the Holy Ghost to put him out that's all I'll say I feel religious right now he says well he was getting Plum religious wasn't it brother we need some more Christians not jellyfish jellyfish but with a backbone that'll stand well I don't mean to fuss with people but stand your god-given rights that Christ died for certainly not be pushed around no sir we got an inheritance Our Heritage belongs at us and it's your privilege Amen to have anything Jesus Christ died for yes sir Satan said I'll tell you one thing what I'm going to do no you ain't that's the way to talk back to him he says someone here I'll tell you what I'm gonna do said shut your mouth and get out of here I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna know you ain't gonna do nothing you ain't got no rights well glory to God that's the way to talk to him say I know my position in Christ and you thought you'd get away with it but you ain't gonna do it we act like Satan is our boss there's a great difference between being a boss and being bossy dear Jesus help me a lot of folks are bossy you need to do this and you never need to do that you need to do something else and you look at their own life and their own own life is tore all two pieces but yet they know what you ought to do in every circumstance of your life I personally have a little bit of hard time to be able to take advice from people that can't take advice from others thank you Jesus a leader that cannot be led is not a god-called leader a leader what says he's a leader which cannot take Godly advice from other leaders there's something wrong with that leadership shame on you if you follow one of such so Satan is not
