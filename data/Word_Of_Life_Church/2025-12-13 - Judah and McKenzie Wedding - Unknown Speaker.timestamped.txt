[10:20] You may be seated.
[10:25] Family and friends, we've gathered here
[10:26] on the side of God in the face of this
[10:29] company, you witnesses to join together
[10:32] this man and this woman in the holy
[10:35] state of matrimony which is commanded in
[10:38] the scriptures to be entered into in the
[10:40] fear of God reverently and discreetly.
[10:44] There's any person here today who can
[10:45] show a just cause why these two men may
[10:48] not be lawfully joined together. Let
[10:50] them speak now forever hold their peace.
[10:53] Who gives this woman to be married to
[10:55] this man?
[10:56] &gt;&gt; Our mother.
[11:23] Wipe your tears. Take a breath. Lay your
[11:27] head on my chest. [singing]
[11:30] Let me hold you through the night.
[11:36] Yeah. [music] The world can bring us
[11:38] [singing] down.
[11:40] But I still believe somehow
[11:43] it's all going [singing] to be all
[11:45] right.
[11:47] Come what may, [singing]
[11:50] the highs, the lows.
[11:54] Well, this life [singing and music] will
[11:55] be hard, but you and me won't.
[12:00] When the waters rise [singing] and we
[12:03] face the fire, we'll rest in our
[12:06] foundation. [music]
[12:07] Hand in hand on [singing] our knees.
[12:10] Nothing [music] between us.
[12:13] You, me, [singing] and Jesus.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll have a few fights.
[12:32] who's wrong and who's right. [singing]
[12:35] But I want you to know
[12:41] at the end [singing]
[12:42] of the day, [music] I'm always here to
[12:46] stay. No, [singing] you'll never be
[12:49] alone.
[12:52] Come on. May
[12:55] the highs, the lows. [singing]
[12:59] Well, this life will be hard, [music]
[13:01] but you and me won't.
[13:05] When the [singing] waters rise and we
[13:08] face the fire, we'll rest in our
[13:10] foundation. [music]
[13:12] Hand in [singing] hand on our knees.

[13:37] well, this [singing] life [music] will
[13:39] be hard, but you and me won't. [singing]
[13:43] [music]
[13:44] Oh, and when it's time to say goodbye,
[13:47] we'll rest in [music] our foundation.

[13:53] Hand in [singing] hand, on our knees,
[13:56] nothing between us. [music] Cuz in the
[14:01] [singing] end, even death could only
[14:04] lead us
[14:09] &gt;&gt; to you, me, and Jesus.

[14:26] I require and charge you both as you

[14:33] impediment where you may not belully
[14:35] join together, you do now confess it. If
