a tape just a little bit ago brother Branham talked about a young man that had never got to see the ocean in his life and he was so excited so just overwhelmed the fact that he was gonna get to visit the ocean and he was walking along the shore getting ready to go down to the ocean he met an old man and the old man said son where are you going he said I'm gonna get to see the ocean for the first time in my whole life I'm so excited the old man he said I've sailed the seas I've seen this ocean my whole life I don't see nothing to get excited about brother Branham said the reason he didn't is because he had got used to it now I want to say that just to say this you and me as Christians as individual servants of the Lord we don't want to never just get too used to it his presence and his his Spirit coming in our midst that is a treasure that is a treasure don't let us none of us ever and I'm not saying we will and pray to God we won't but don't let us never just get used to use to it because it is so sweet and so precious it ought to be sweet to us every time we enter these walls we're gonna get to hear from the Lord Jesus Christ we're going to get to sit together in heavenly places with God's people this is an opportunity a lot of people would die for today let's give our Lord Jesus a real good hand type of praise if you this morning everybody that lives around us very

I'm gonna let you be CD for just a bit while we look at her prayer requests this morning brother West you've done a great job for us last night I want to say thank you daddy thank you for being obedient to the Lord and well God is just so so good to his church he is so good to us this is from brother Joel Moyer the family there in Ohio the rescue that we would continue remember them in prayer concerning court dates that the Lord would just intervene the state don't get custody of their children the attorneys they're asking that we would just pray on that behalf that the Lord would intervene and let everything work out according to his divine purpose we believe he's able to do that don't we amen when continue to remember brother Donnie in prayer this morning he's about the same this morning and believing God for complete healing also brother Don and sister Carol want to thank everyone for their prayers so let's pray for our pastor and his wife this morning that the Lord would just touch him let him let him be alright I know God God is able to do that and Satan likes nothing better than to throw a servant of God on the shelf and put him out of commission but I'm gonna tell you he don't have enough sense to know that while he's out of commission there's golden nuggets dropping into his heart that's gonna bless the children of God so we we know that we know that something good will come out of something bad don't we man but the key straighter is having an echocardiogram on Tuesdays wearing a heart monitor and they're asking that we would remember him in prayer as we pray today one remember sister Christine Baker in prayer having severe pain in her neck this morning so let's just remember her as we pray want to want to pray for brother Frank Williams this morning also his daughter daily both are very sickening the healing touch so let's remember those folks as we pray and I believe that's all of our our written request all the in spoken prayer requests if you have a need something you'd like for this group to pray about we're serving a prayer answering God and we know that we continue to believe that I told you last night the Lord has touched my body and I want to and thank him for it he just he pestered us to death but he's knows he's got a little time to work on us and the old burger man he likes to take his shots at God's people but I'm gonna tell you something we get we guess the Fargo that and we just eventually go on out of this world look what's waiting on us look what's waiting now it's brother gene good to see you in the service today praying for sister Jane gonna continue to pray for they may give him a nice hand this morning and we continue to pray for her brother Daniel no knees still I guess in the hospital not for sure but want to pray for a brother the day you know how to some complications different things so let's remember that brother Keith Phillips brother Eugene Kennedy won't remember those folks in prayer as we pray today let's stand if you will let me let me make these announcements as we get ready to pray over the needs today by the West if you just come get ready to pray this morning but the West wanted me to make this announcement please be here no later than 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday for the bus to the Louisiana camp we will go over bus and camp rules at that time so remember if you're going to Louisiana can't be here Wednesday no later than 5:00 p.m. so can can you remember that we would certainly appreciate you also there'll be no service here Wednesday night because of the youth that's gonna be leaving going to camp so we want to we want just as we pray we want to pray for the success of the camp the success of our young people and all those other young people that will be joining the ministers and just pray that God will give them a great great reviving in their spirits and in their hearts when welcome to the service today the Duke family from Indiana would you just raise your hand wherever you're at somebody help me find them give them a good hand this morning god bless you so glad to have you here this morning also brother Brian Taylor a longtime streamer from the state of Alabama he's visited with us again this morning going to be giving us the song just a little bit and looking forward to that so we're just we've got a lot going on here this morning brother West come this morning take us to the Lord in prayer as we pray appreciate our brother don't leave Amen we love you buddy real quick before before we go to the Lord in prayer there's one rule for the camp that I need to go over really quick in case somebody hasn't prepared properly in years past you know there's dress code rules and everything we want to we want to look out for the safety and the modesty of our of our sisters and brothers when they go to camp and and there's always a few who go down there you know that the Lord hasn't really dealt with yet and he usually deals with them when they're down there though but there's a you know always somebody that just kind of wants to push the envelope a little bit and because of that sometimes the rules have to seem a little bit too the stricter side and some of the sisters had been going in in Tom's Paston and maybe wearing leggings to account for a skirt that was a little too short and wasn't quite modest enough so they they have had to make a rule that there's no leggings in order to ensure that the skirts would be long enough because they're looking out for the holiness of the of our sisters and and their and you know trying to protect them and they're also you know trying to look out for the the Spirit that we bring in among us when we're when we're worshiping there at the camp we wanted to be the Holy Ghost we don't want it to be a religious spirit or something like that we want to be the Holy Ghost and so this is a protection and holiness is is something you know that the people of God are known for so we you know a lot of people may be concerned you know about about not using the leggings or like well that you know as an extra layer of protection you know if they were to fall down or or something like that well that they're just wanting to ensure that the skirts are long enough to protect our sisters without having the need for leggings so that's why they're outlawed completely and I wouldn't want somebody to get down there and they brought a bunch and and they're not prepared and then they get embarrassed we just wouldn't want that you know so that's why I have to make this announcement but other than that the rules are all the same and we'll go over them we have several visitors coming with us and riding on the bus so we'll go over the rules and stuff that's that's not changed all those are about the same and we never have an issue with that anyway we always have the the best and young people in the world by far and I'm so proud of them and I don't want it to seem when we talk about rules and stuff I don't want to seem like we have young people that are rebellious or hard-hearted or anything these are the finest in the world and that adds the truth I'm not to say that cuz I love them okay let's let's go to the Lord in prayer father I thank you so much for the body of believers across the whole world Lord I can feel us growing closer together in your in your love Lord and in your presence daily I can feel us just getting closer and closer to you Lord there's there several prayer requests here our pastor is still laying in his sickbed Lord and Lord we know that he is already healed we know that everyone who submitted a prayer request to appear today in faith Lord is already healed father we're speaking to the the lying symptoms that are coming against him and we're rebuking them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're believing together as the body of Christ as the the broad of the Lord Jesus here on the earth we're believing Lord as we lay these at your feet that we can fully trust you to do away with these symptoms and to restore each one to health and to raise them up Lord you said you would do it and we believe it and that's something that we're not going to back down from we're not going to turn and run Lord but we're going to stand boldly in the face of Satan and we're going to say you don't have a chance you don't have a chance when you come against this broad because our groom is our protector and he is the greatest of all the hast of all and there is no name higher than that of the Lord Jesus Christ we worship You Lord we love you Lord we feel the dearness of your spirit as it draws in we feel the heat of your conviction Lord in our hearts and we thank you for it because that's love too and Lord Jesus we just thank you for your word we thank you for the servant who's back there and who's prepared and studied to bring the word to us today Lord and we're looking forward to how you're going to speak through that man and talk to our hearts today and and take us one step closer to the rapture father that's what we want we want to this place one step closer we don't want to leave here the same as we came in or worse than we came in but we want to leave here Lord closer to you father we love you with all of our heart I ask that you you have the freedom to walk in among this Lord as we open our hearts to you today Lord we're going to trust that you you have got something special we're never going to walk into this this service not expecting Lord we're expecting great things we're looking forward to them we know that it's going to happen we don't wonder or hope but we know that it's going to happen when you're on the scene Lord when you come in among us we invite you Father and want to make you welcome and Lord for those who are suffering and pain with these symptoms we ask you now father as we agree Lord we ask you to lift those symptoms and set them free in Jesus name we pray amen an offering you give us unto the Lord you're visiting with us today in the service we want to welcome you glad to have all of you here those that are streaming we pray this service will be a great blessing to those folks

[Music] I kind of like that don't I make you want to go home there's just something about the Lord Jesus that he has a pool that he wants us to be with him when you think about in Jesus prayer as I've said so many times but I like that he always you know not my will but dime be doing he came to do the will of the Father but he asked one thing the only thing in his prayer John's 1724 think it is he said I will that where I am there you may be also he only asked one thing that's all they ever asked a father for one thing and that's your fellowship that's that's wonderful that's wonderful I appreciate him well praise the Lord we're get to go back to church amen and I'm really thankful that I get to go back to church I mean you know I could be in a pine box somewhere you know but the Lord just been real good to me and appreciate again all the prayers and the cards and and and it's just been in the hand of the Lord you know I haven't had any really roadblocks setbacks no flu no pneumonia just it's just been really hard to just you know you just can't use your arms you just can't you know for the first six eight weeks you know I also had to kind of tie me down just don't do nothing you know but I'm getting a little bit of freedom now I can do a little bit Jim but as Jim Babb called me this morning he said brother Terry said I don't want you to be jumping off a platform just just go up there and just teach real quietly and you'll be okay I said I'm not making no promises but brotherwe actually did real good last night we appreciate that thank you I've had several people to ask me when you're gonna preach again on Israel I've got some more good things on this show but I've got to go as the Lord leads so what we have this morning is more important in Israel this is you that's you amen if you want to go home we want to go get ready to go home so actually I'm gonna preach this morning a little titled and we'll call it rapture ready but so well if you say I have wonderful rapture ready I mean he's going to preach he's going to teach us he's going to give us some deep revelation about the mystery of the seals of the thunders of the pools or some deep mysterious dark something other we've never heard before now I'm not going to tell you anything like that what I'm going to teach you this morning tell you this morning is why you don't have the Holy Ghost why you don't have the Holy Ghost those that who you don't have it they said well is anybody oh you know oh yeah yeah and why why is it so hard for people that struggle to get the Holy Ghost we're going to we're going to uncover the the issue by the grace of God okay because it's got it needs to be exposed and listen I'm I'm not a real smart man I've been a Christian about 44 years I've been in a message about 35 years I'm not a pro not an expert I'm not a theologian but I have been around the block a few times I know a little bit about what I'm talking about and I have actually been studying on this thought for for some time and just for the proper time to bring and what to say and trying to bring a composite of a lot of different things dealing with the Holy Ghost you can go if you have it listen you preach to message of what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for December 1959 whew the second one especially of what does the Holy Ghost given for if you haven't listed that one a long time go back and listen to it especially if there's any question your mind or anybody anybody it's very good young people it's very good turn with me to acts 19 verse 1 and 2 and this is that this scripture here is course a very familiar scripture but I want to try to even the scripture 7 bring out something that would provoke a little fault if we could x19 verse 1 and verse 2 now you ready to have church alright okay if you pull I'll try not to behave I won't be responsive acts 19 verse 1 now acts 19 was written of course about Luke and it was written about ad 58 okay so that's about 25 28 29 years since John the Baptist so listen and it came to pass that koala Paulus was at Corinth Paul of course you know during Paul's time Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples now they're not sinners they're disciples and he says certain disciples so that mean they were just that wasn't every disciple is up there but just certain ones and so it probably wasn't a great big group with just certain disciples as I said this was probably maybe 25 to 28 years after John the Baptist and he said to them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and he said unto them we've been in the message for 10 years and don't even know if we got the Holy Ghost [Applause] did I read that right oh I did I did have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed or you say well I that was just for those in the upper coasts of Ephesus back that no no no no have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed actually this question is actually more needed today and I think it was back then I mean you know there were just certain disciples I mean look look I mean look at the young people that was that are raised in the message raising the message you know it's a real it's a it's a real struggle for young people because the race had a message now like my wife and I and many of you older people we actually were revelations 18:4 come out of her we were kicked out denomination we we heard the Eagle scream we was literally forced kicked out those raised in the message to them this is until they get a revelation this is just religion that's all it is I mean well we God sent a prophet wait you know it's a special but until you get a revelation it's just religion I don't care it doesn't you have to understand it's just religion it's no more than Methodists Baptists or nobody else unless you get a revelation because you're not going to go in old mom and daddy so it's it's really more needful today have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed and what about people playing I'm playing Church I'm just gonna I'm not gonna pull any punches today okay I'm just gonna this is what the Lord laid on my heart and I'm gonna deliver it what about people leaving the message thought that that had to hold a ghost you you can't leave the message and how the Holy Ghost now they thought they had it I don't care if he's raised in this whatever have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we're thankful for the reading of the word well thankful Lord that this scripture was put in here Lord they're just so abundance amount of thoughts and revelations it'll take eternity for you to to really reveal yourself to us that we might further know you and we'll never would never learn at all but Lord while we're here give us a little bit more understanding today hide me behind the cross Lord may you speak I've got some note scriptures and quotes here but I pray that you'll bring out the understanding give sense to the reading of the word may you know what the people to receive Lord and I thank you for healing my body so many times thank you so many times for healing my body and you've healed it many times but I really have thanked you so much and I appreciate it watch over us today bless our pastors strengthen him sister Carol give them grace today maybe when we leave the service for sake we can say it's been good to be in the house of God grant these things Lord we asking the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody says amen you can be seated well the greatest experience a human being can have is receive a new birth not only says the greatest but it's the most important and it will absolutely absolutely will change a person's nature and it's actually a miracle if you could take a any kind of an animal you know a whole you and actually could change him to be a sheep which obviously we can't do that but if you could how can you take the nature of an end of that animal and make it a completely different nature but that's what God has done for us we were actually just animal beat groupies you know with it with a snake nature of follow nature and God changed that nature and make a totally different nature a christ-like nature I mean he changed our whole nature our focus our attitude our desires our speech our behavior outlook our disposition oh everything's been changed by numerous that's a miracle that's miraculous that God could do that for me and you and change our nature to make us wrap to really and to go in the rapture you must have the holy no option about it all the way those who have the Holy Ghost goes in a rapture and somebody said if you if if you not beat on the pulpit you probably will save your sternum bone there you probably won't break it if you just try not to beat the pulpit - I'm making no promises we must have the Holy Ghost without the holy goat listen without the Holy go where we are today so close to the rapture without the Holy Ghost you're headed for either the tribulation are you lost I mean what are the option you got those virgins remember the foolish virgins brother may have said they all thought they was under the blood but they weren't under the blood but they thought that they were so unless you're a sinner today and you know everybody in this building some have the Holy Ghost some don't have those goals it goes but unless you're sinner everybody thinks they have the Holy Ghost is this an important important subject and yet still I hear it often how do I know when I get it or how what will I do how will I act how how will I know I still hear that you know I'm still not sure that I have it so let's by God's grace try to at least settle that part of it this morning okay and worse than that worse than that there's some people that actually think that they have the Holy Ghost and don't have the Holy Ghost I say old brothers Harry don't don't tell me that mean that there's been at least a one preacher standing right here in this pulpit left the message we thought he had the Holy Ghost but probably been others people leave the message they don't have the Holy Ghost been around the message for years how many people who assumed they had to hold a ghost and left a message here's let's look at this first quote what the holy ghost what is the holy ghost upon this upon this place we wish you approach the subject now think is the outstanding subject of today what is the Holy Ghost what is it and now the reason I have taken these subject like this and you cannot and you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you know what you've got it got when you get it and that would settle it okay in the token message now we read that acts 19 one and two have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe now in the token 147 now the Spirit is a token you should be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when the blood was shed the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost like a rushing mighty wind now listen to this next part that was the theme of every apostle that was have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed many I'm was baptized by John or under John's ministry 25 or 28 years before that but the question was many of the disciples have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed on the Lord Jesus amen now brother man preach what is the Holy Ghost 1959 and what is it given for but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you just about a two minute synopsis on what it is but then we want to go more into what I did how do you know what defects does that have and so forth and so on okay now and Luke 24:49 Jesus told them go to you up the city of Jerusalem and and tarry until they receive power he didn't explain it he didn't hit tell him how long he would be there he said you just go there and wait and tail now that's very important wait and tail well you say after I come to the altar or wherever I give my heart to Lord how long will it be I don't know but you just wait until it's just got to be on tail there's no set amount of time it's just a tail but there's some reasons why it has to go until a further until and he says what is the Holy Ghost we found that what the Holy Ghost is it's a sign the chillness will we're given a seal of circumcision a sign it's a seal piece of 430 grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you're sealed it's the Spirit of Christ in you that I'll be with you even in you it's a comforter I pray that followed he'll give you another comforter it's an advocate any man sin we have an advocate with the father it's our rest coming to me all your heavy and are heavy laden and I will give you a rest and then it's power you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost will come upon you and now I just preaching the sermon or what is the Holy Ghost all those things that's what it that's what it is but you know it's also it's kind of like you know what it is these five or six things and it's more than that also but also one place brother Branham he talks about Holy Ghost it's kind of like electricity he said nobody knows yet what electricity is we can harness it we can see the fix a light bulb we can see the effects of a motor we can see the effects of your stove in your house whatever you conceive the effects of electricity but you tell me what it is what you say well it's current below what is current well it runs through the wire well I can't see what is electricity well I'll tell you one thing you might not can tell me what it is but when you get a hole in wires you know you got it [Applause] so it's good that you know what the Holy Ghost is but you better know if you got it that's the main thing so don't forget about that maybe maybe it's like electricity but maybe I can teach that to what it is but when you when it bites you you know it when it bites you you know it I mean they're being bit by electricity most of you mmm yeah yeah if you do it too didn't you amen you know we know what it is but now I want to ask here's the big question for those who don't have it for those who not sure that they have it and maybe for those that think they got it and really don't have it maybe you ought to think about that and then for those who do have it maybe it would be a confirmation my big question is if you don't have the Holy Ghost you want the Holy Ghost how bad do you want it how badly do you want the Holy Ghost well they say all brother Terry more than anything in the world really really how bad did the rich young ruler won't eternal life how bad did he want eternal life well to a point to a point but really that's your answer there there is rub Donna just preached here recently price and value you may think you mourn it more than anything but really how much do you really really want it leadership and he refused to be called the son of speaking of Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter because he esteemed their approach to Christ greater treasure than all the riches of the world he esteemed that watch what he done he followed up quickly he was cuss out stood out by his people the people that once loved him it might cost you everything you got it might cost you your home it might cost you your friendship it might cost you your stitching so party it might cost you your place in the kiwanis it might I don't know what it'll cost you but it'll cost you everything that's worldly or pertains to the world I can tell you that I don't know what it'll cost you but it's going to cost everybody something you say well it's a free gift it's true it it's a free gift you cannot purchase with a price of works that gift it is a free gift you can't buy it but you have to surrender to get it it'll cost you everything that's worldly or pertains to the world you'll have to separate yourself from everything that's worldly you have to do it now that's really that's one of the key things right there while many people don't receive the Holy Ghost you're not you have it really and then we're going to get into that a little bit more but as we just lay a foundation thing about this yeah I'm willing to get everything up really really if you don't have it and you're thirsting for it and it's for you it shows you there's something wrong somewhere it's not God Moses laid aside everything Moses laid everything aside and went to the desert with a stick in his hand amen days after days passed and wonder if he thought he made a mistake not many times people start out and say oh I'll do it glory to God I see it let somebody laughing you make fun of it well maybe probably I was wrong how badly do you want it well it's kind of like the little story of the chicken in the hall no no if you've ever heard a little story but the chicken in the hall was kind of going along one day and they saw that sign a sign out there and it said ham and egg breakfast and so you know ham and egg breakfast you don't ham an egg the chicken and the hog to help the war effort and the Hogs head to the chicken you know for you it's only a sacrifice but for me it's a total commitment you're gonna have ham that's a total commitment the chicken laying egg that's just how bad do you want it that's the quiz how bad do you want it your salvation is a free gift that's true but it costs you everything that's worldly to get it I'd like to think about this for a minute the and I'm just going to read this white quickly think about this the the guard of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier what he's his life and his discipline what he's willing to give up just for that position all they get is a wreath and they're part of an elite group being the guard of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier but this is what he has to his discipline his sacrifice he must be between 510 and 62 tall and weigh sighs cannot exceed thirty inches of the requirements of the guard he must commit two years of life to guard tomb living the barracks underneath the tomb cannot drink any alcohol or owner off duty for the rest of the lives they cannot swear in public for the rest of their lives cannot disgrace the uniform or the tomb in any way after two years the guard has given a wreath pen that is worn on the lapel signifying they served as the guard of the tomb there are only four hundred presently worn the guard must obey these rules for the rest of the lives will give up the wreath pen the shoes are specially made for very thick with very thick thick soles to keep the heat and cold from their feet remember this is 360 24/7 they guard the tomb there are no wrinkles folks lint on the uniformed guards dressed for duty in front of a full-length mirror first six months of duty guard cannot talk to anyone to watch TV all off-duty Thomas Pitt studying 175 notable people laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery the guard must memorize who they are and where they're interred every guard must spend five hours a day getting his uniform ready for guard duty he's willing to do that just to be a 2-year assignment to be a guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier what are you willing to give up and what would be discipline of your life just to receive eternal life how much is it worth to you is that where separation is a worth giving up everything is it worth that kind of a separation from the world is it worth that kind of a life to be able to to be different to be not like the world to be an oddball to the world is it worth like that you remember this is we're a royal priesthood we're a different people to procure you people did it we're talking about Bryden we're talking about bride members we're talking about a bride condition word bride and still we wonder why so many people struggle with even the Holy Ghost and why many even for weeks or months or years Wow my Wow Wow listen I don't want to hurt you but I want to tell you the truth brother I'm sitting in trial Tucson he said sometimes he lingers as he did in the night to Noah as he did in the days of Moses he did in all days but he never told the Pentecostal people go you up in the city of Jerusalem Jerusalem in 24 hours I give you the Holy Ghost he never said that they didn't have any idea they didn't even know what it was going to get they just said I'm on you until you be endued with power that's all they told him and he said tarry there until you've been in dude with power from on high he never said one day to day ten days he said stay until your endued with power Lord they stayed there until the evidence spoke back through them that was the Holy Ghost of God they stayed there until so that's the key on tale but that's not all the key I want you to understand something about acts 2:38 repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the Mists of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I don't know if you've ever seen this quote before but I want you to think about this patmans vision I was in the spirit it isn't it just beautiful my love that could you just you could just call those words a hold of the Christian life if we're going to live as Christians we have to be in his his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these fishes it had to be in the Spirit of God it has to be the Spirit of God with us too all of our efforts are in vain Paul said our pray in the spirit i'll seen the sphere i'll live in the sphere if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the words made manifest by the results it bears as surely as john needed to be in the spirit holy spirit to receive these tremendous revelations from jesus fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that god has given to us to live by in his word for the same spirit remember even faith is a revelation you got to have faith to be saved and even that's the revelation paragraph 44 look at it this way Oh too many read the Bible where it says in acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and just pass right on think about I want you to think about this quote they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then God will be duty-bound to fill his word fulfilled his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost they never get in his spirit the Holy Spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says they never get into his spirit pray to God for revelation by his Spirit that's the first step why is it and I baptizing many young people and that's all good and I will continue to do that but why is it I'm just playing okay I'm just playing why is it a lot of young people to baptize young why is it - 15 20 years later go back out in the world whatever to come back and then they want to get rebaptised and then later on then to get the Holy Ghost why I mean there's a reason why when we read the scripture repent be baptized the name of Jesus Christ from it and you see it's like we we want to thank well you're going to get it and within 5 minutes it doesn't say that it doesn't say that don't read that into it you could you could but most time they don't come that way and especially in Laodicea and there's reasons why and Laodicea there's so much pull of the world how badly do you want it it's for you and if your seed you're going to get in some time but why wait till you're 90 years old he told him to tarry Jerusalem but just wait Intel and first you know now he told that whole group and you know he didn't tell him how long he didn't tell him how long the way but he told that whole group was at 500 whoever it was to go up the city of Jerusalem but only 120 obeyed what happened to the others only 120 obeyed not everybody obeys which brings us to another subject about this did the rich young ruler obey no no said go sell if you had don't label Warren it quite that bad did the Pharisees obey no did Judas obey no do the foolish over to foolish virgins obey they thought they were but no acts 5:29 then Peter and the other apostles answer said we ought to obey God rather than man the God of my father's raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree him hath God exalted with his right hand to be Prince and to be Savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins verse 32 and we are his witnesses of these sayings and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey so there's something you got to do has nothing to do with the purchase price of salvation that's a free gift but remember the Lambs wife hath made herself ready you've got to do something you got to do something rest your life you've got it you have you've got to stay surrender to the ones you see you got the soul is burst into the New Kingdom you got ten outlets that's against you they're not born again see taste feel smell hear constant reason it matters a memory affection they're all against you they're not born again they're not redeemed they are against you so your souls got to tell the spirit what to do the spirits got to tell the flesh what to do and they all are rebelling against the soul because they're not redeemed so you it's one against ten which one's gonna win he gives the Holy Ghost it was given to them that obey know what about that wonder why you haven't received the Holy Ghost it's certainly not God's fault so it has to be your fault somewhere because if you have that thirst in your seat you're going to get some time the token jeffersonville all little people my brother's sister get under that token quickly see don't take no substitute don't don't don't don't don't do that see don't just imagine you stay there and tell you know that the token is applied until you're a whole the mind that was in crisis in you until all the nonsense of the world is gone see until the whole hearts desire is him see there then then you know then you know something is happening there's got to be a death [Music] [Applause] you say well you know too many people that fall short they never truly fully sincerely repent that's the most critical thing I want to touch on that again remember I brought it out here several months ago but I want to touch on just a little short part of it John come preach and repent us for the kingdom of heaven his hand Jesus preached repentance for the kingdom of heaven his hand Peter preached for repentance repentance it's a it's a prepares is a process of death repent means to turn around about-face you're going this way now you going this way you're going this way now you turn around go this way it's a process of if you must be born again progressed 67 yes to be born again you must go through a process of death you mean you you actually have to die what part of you dies that old snake nature that's inside of years old that snake Nature has got to die you just can't put it on herself that nature must die go back and listen invincible using again one of the most beautiful message listened to invisible Union one more time he said you just can't divorce that you just can't put it on yourself that first husband must die absolutely die you to be born again you must go through a process of death everything does from a grain of see a whole nature dance burial resurrection core never expects to live again it's got to die first if a grain of we never expect to live again it's totally impossible that corn that sweet that flower that tree that grass that virtually everything that expects to live again must first die then how you how are you going to escape it you've got to die first you've got to die die out to yourself die to everything so that you can be born again you've got to do that if you don't die you can never again I know most all the young people over here and probably on the internet and wherever it doesn't matter it's got to be a death oh I'm willing to do that know you if you know if you've been seeking for months and months and months and months it's something if something's not dead yet something's not dead yet what kind of life do you live I brotherwe said we got that we got the that the cream of the cobble Eve that you come to church but we're talking about we're talking about receiving the Holy Ghost that's the Lambs wife that's those that he has chosen that's going to live in this city be in the millennium reign with him that's that's his sweetheart he ain't gonna pick no further he ain't gonna take no harlot he's not going to take no ill Fame he's not going to take just somebody today dating he's going to be is going to marry a real real woman a real mature lady the Lambs wife that's why you got to die first he said it three times and that you must die well you say well I just changed my mind that's why you got to change your mind but you've got to die and God will change not only your mind but it's changed your nature but they just don't want to die you know listen Jesus died for you now you must die for him you got to die to your first nature into your worldly desires and all that stuff Jesus died to make away now you've got to you got to die to receive that way as we said all I follow that same pattern death burial resurrection all life all nature death burial resurrection everywhere John 12:24 verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit all nature we're the same way long as that seed stays in a in a seed package somewhere you can have a little seed package of daffodils or whatever you know marigolds they might stay in that package 500 years if they don't get wet if their German bow ties but they gonna bring they're not gonna produce no life they got to be put in the right kind of better ground and they got a dying right then it can bring forth life amen that's right entail this place in the good ground it cannot and die and rot it can never bring forth life and you must be born again Jeff paragraph 73 you see what I mean now you are dead our souls are placed upon the divine judgment that's brass when our souls is placed upon an altar divine judgment what was the penalty death now even what I'm covering right now this is so important well I I have died really why is you had wise some of you - some of you live a questionable life you shouldn't say things like that it's it's it is what it is you're you are dead our souls are placed upon His divine judgment that's brass when our souls are placed upon the altar demands of what was the penalty death and when you lay yourself upon the altar of God which is pronounced death upon the sinner how can you raise from there alive in sin if God hasn't accepted the sacrifice is that clear now you die you actually are consumed and you're petrified there's no more left to you but just this form that you're standing in like the brass serpent like Christ was when he took his took him dead and cold off the clothes you're dead cause why your own God's altar of judgment what was his judgment when the judge surpasses the sentence what the sentence of this penalty was death you say well you're really laboring on death it's got to be that way you've got to die to receive life you've got to die you've got to run you've got to be willing to give up everything it's unlike Christ I don't care if you're 40 years old I don't give you 50 years old I don't care if you've been in the message 30 years as I say it there's many of middle aged and older people this fell away from the message they didn't have the Holy Ghost so don't tell me just because you're old everybody's got and everybody ain't got it they shouldn't you shouldn't preach today I want to preach I want I want you to make it we are so close brother sister listen there's no need to be playing Church you must be born again paragraph 76 now your soul is laid upon the altar of God's breast judgment then God receives it now it shows that you haven't received it it if you're still alive in the world God never took it now you people talking about getting the Holy Ghost and how you have to wait so long here you are until God receives that sacrifice you have to wait so long here it is until God receives that sacrifice until it's late on his judgments there until his judgment has actually killed her senses killed your senses did you hear what I said killed your senses your five senses your 10 senses you might say well I'm going to turn a new page that ain't it well I know I used to smoke I'm going to quit that still isn't in and tell God Racine's that sacrifice on his brass altar the altar of judgment what is this judgment death that's the penalty the soul that sinneth that remaineth in that shield I don't care what you've done like Abraham until he had fully separated from light and unbelief and all doubt then God gave him the seal of circumcision that he had received his faith he had to separate he had to separate God receive Abraham's faith then he give him to the seal of circumcision brother man said in future home who said you don't accept God God accepts you because it's his attributes God's got to accept you what the parties got to accept is your faith because you have to have faith your faith has got to be a revelation that I am willing to die and surrender and dream transformed that's why maybe Jesus said to his disciples do you now believe after all this time do you now believe the seeds helpers instigated the enemy paragraph 31 now when we received Christ our Savior then if we're sincere in that then oh oh yeah it's up there then if we're sincere in that then if he put it if they're in sincerity Then There is obviously a possibility the person cannot be sincere there is a possibility then if we're sincere that then God gives us a sign that heareth has received our faith in Christ by giving us the seal of circumcision which is a Holy Ghost it was a natural back their spiritual today that's the seal of circumcision grieve not the host fear of God whereby you're sealed till the day of your redemption not to the next meeting but to the day of your Redemption that's right feasting for 30 now that's how we receive the Holy Ghost 32 and now you say oh I'm a believer and gods never give you the Holy Ghost yet he's never recognized it I told you it's not God's fault it's your fault he's never recognized your faith yet maybe your faith is not to that point maybe your revelation not to that point you say well I just can't live it no you can't but when you make up you well you got to really choose your words correctly because we're talking about election here God broods and God puts that desire in there and you you know if you if you're God's seed he's going to put that thirst is going to be there but you still have to do your part what and what how well at what point are you willing to say okay I'm ready God knows that what you point you ready well maybe you get baptized you know and you say I'm ready to die I want the Holy goes well what maybe even maybe maybe maybe you go back in for a couple of years you still kind of worldly well you see did that cult God catch God by surprise God already knew so it's gonna be two years he's going back into the world he knew you wasn't ready but see when God recognizes your faith and he knows you're ready then that's what it comes because he knows down the road he knows that you're going to be two years of five years or six months or twenty years he knows that but he's not going to he's not going to see all that and tell him until the point which he knows what point you're going to be ready he says which is okay we just skip on down to paragraph 32 and now oh you say you never give you the Holy Ghost yet he's just he's never recognized you're just confessing that you believe but when all the daily I'm not saying you're not a believer now in a certain portion you are believer but when God has found favor you have Fedor found favor with him rather and he recognizes you to be his child and he knows your heart and sees your sincerity sees your sincerity he knows all things are cut away from you then then he seals you into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost proving to the world that he accepted what faith you profess to have it have in him get it now so there's got to be the part that you've got to play you've got you have to have that sincerity he knows well not you're ready really ready to die he knows well maybe it's going to take two years three years five years hope it don't but he knows at what point is okay he's ready why didn't God give Abraham the seal of circumcision the first year that he called him he had to because he wasn't ready yet he goes down he goes down to career I'm not to career goes down to Egypt the first time fate Road lies about his wife and so forth it's on like that and we'll give it I'm gonna give you a little grace in just a minute I won't give you a little grace in just a minute brother we're talking about bride material I don't want to miss it I don't even want to be foolish virgin I believe I'm called to be bride now God never sent me no special delivery letter you know certified letter but I believe by my faith and by my testimony your brother Bev said by the word of your testimony he said your testimony is your Holy Ghost by your testimony it's a sign to the world that you've really got something I believe that I have the Holy Ghost a word birth on my soul I believe I've been transformed sealed into the Keen I don't want to miss it that's what it means to me we're talking about the Lambs wife his sweetheart not flirt his wife we're talking about a word bride we're talking about those who separated from the world and unbelief we're talking about those that are chosen and if you are chosen and you have a thirst for God and that thirst is in there which you know what a thirst is it's a painful desire for God a painful desire a thirst is a painful desire a real thirst if you've got a painful desire you're going to wait until until until whatever it don't matter how long until like the story it did whichever preacher that was he said I'm going to stay in this cornfield you'll find my bones in this cornfield if you don't were filled me with the Holy I'm staying here a tail it's got to be on tail there's no other way has got to be a tail if you really desire you'll give up everything this carnal that's not godly paragraph 27 once the Holy Ghost now there's a vast difference between just the Christians and the Holy Ghost field Christian now you're going to get this from the scripture and place it exactly in the scripture the first lay there is a Christian I profess to be Christian but if this this mission has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in the process of being a Christian see he is professed to believe it and he's working to it but God has not yet given him his spirit of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached that goal with God that God hasn't recognized yet this is not new material this is just the message have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed we've been in message 50 years have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed if not there's many people's been in the message for years that don't have the Holy Ghost we used to believe it if you could see the revelation of the seals and thunders and pools and this and that we used to believe that 30 years ago you got it you got the Holy Ghost and we found out that wasn't true brother it's the same thing brother man said well you said the the the Methodist we shouted they got up he said many didn't didn't have it well the Holy Ghost we spoke in tongues they said well we got it and many of you spoke in tongues it didn't have it you say I'm in the message the dependent me a lot of people say that in the message don't have it same thing bring it up to date remember the Holy Ghost is a sign it's a seal that's a comforter it's an advocate it is rest but remember when you talk about the seal let's talk about that just for a moment remember what brother been said about the boxcar oh the boxcar how many boxcars we got out here nobody won't raise it we got one to raise the Henry oh hi he sealed the boxcar are you a type of the boxcar he says that's what the matter we don't get sealed too much now what's this I didn't write it I'm just reading it per graphic that's what's the matter we don't get seals so much where's Toulouse about things when the inspector Oh who's inspector Holy Ghost when the inspector goes through and expects your life to see if you're not just a little loose about things a little loose in your prayer life a little loose about that temper a little loose about that tongue to talk on Facebook about others he'll never seal the car I didn't write that I'm just reading it how many believe it 73% how many believe it how many believe it the the inspectors going to expect the car before he seals the car right he'll never seal the car some dirty habits some vile things some vulgarity mind he can't seal the car I'm telling you I'm teaching you I'm preaching you trying to show you why some people haven't received the Holy Ghost yet say I don't want to hear that what he gonna hear it anyway but when he's found everything in his place inspector then he seals it you say is that going to make you flawless absolutely not it's not going to make you flawless be ye therefore perfect this flesh will never be flawless if you don't believe it you just ask any wife they'll tell you about your husband and maybe vice versa he'll never seal the car he can't seal the car but when he's found everything is in place inspected any seals dare any dare anybody open that seal until the cars reached its destination where he'll steal - there it is Peter had believed on / 121 Peter had believed on the Lord had been baptized and been getting power to heal the sick cast out Devils raise the dead Jesus told him that night before the crucifixion after after after you are converted strengthen your brethren that's why been both saved and sanctified and yet hadn't been converted that's the scripture or you say all sanctified yes Sir John 17:17 sanctify them by the truth thy Word is true they had the the word sanctifies them they had the word which they're sanctified by the word it is truth you think he put that spirit in a vessel that wasn't fit whoa whoa that's heavy duty the inspector finds the car it's got to be you don't want anything that broken he don't want to fall when it gets you know all the going around the curves of the Train and you know it's got to be tied down strapped down it's got to be it's got to be right not flawless it's got to be packed right set right it's got to be set right you're not your own you're a boat with a price your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost don't defile it you might as I said you're not flawless you make mistakes you'll still make mistakes no sir but you have to be sanctified the mob won't give you a little grace now I told you give a little grace okay yeah glad about that Abraham first time he went down into Egypt lied about his wife said this is my sister and then you know in favor oh I'll take it from my wife you okay well then after after after Abraham gets a body change made by young again which is that his body changes the type of us receiving the Holy Ghost after he gets a body change Danny goes down to Greer and the King down there by the name of amulets and the same thing happens and you know he falls in love with this grandma that's now 18 and he said that's that's the one I've been looking for all of my life and says I'm gonna take her he said sure it's all right it's my sister go ahead take her because you know he was he was a little bit coward because he know it's gonna kill his hide if you know if he said anything otherwise say yeah go ahead they see see he and Sarah had coveted years and years ago if we ever get in trouble I'll say you're my sister because it was his half-sister they had made that covenant many many years ago when L started out but Abraham he's already been changed by yunk again signified as a type rather of receiving the hold and he still lied he lied about his life after he had received the Holy Ghost can you imagine a man lying purposely after even the Holy Ghost I can't imagine that well I did think about one instabuilder Brownlie at one time he said now a telephone rang and it was a tax case he said now he went out the door said to me today you tell him not here I'm not here he went outside he had the Holy Ghost brother Ram actually said I lied and he said you know I'm not trying to put words I mean he said I lied I told some wasn't true and he had the Holy Ghost now I'm not advocating lying but I'm going to tell you you probably going to lie if you've been born again you're probably going to lie you probably lied this year oh my but aren't you glad God to judge as a man according to the desire of his heart I'm so glad about that according to what this true hearts is true hearts desire in the was the Holy Ghost given four paragraph 56 and Jesus said they'd be so close together in the last days that would deceive the very elect impossible remember it's just the elected that will see it God calls election calls by election aren't you happy that you're one of them aren't you people here tonight knowing that something in your heart is tugging tugging something in you young people's hearts tugging tugging I want the Holy Spirit I want you Lord in my heart that's because God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he said that no man can come to me except said Jesus except my father has drawled him first and all that comes to me I'll give him/her to eternal life what is he turn what is eternal life the Holy Ghost and what is that thirst it's a painful dis I hear you've been around this message all this law in and you don't have no thirst for God you've been around a message for years and you don't have no thirst for God you probably ain't seed been around a message these years that no thirst for guard something wrong somewhere but I tell you what group does have it so you've been real playing Isis I told you I was gonna be real plain summer do church aids there is only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the Spirit says in each age it is one special group that receives a revelation for each age hello hello this is a special group of people receive the word for age I mean it is a separated a special they chosen a royal you didn't make yourself that he did you just ought to be so thankful to God I'm willing to do whatever it's one special group that receives a revelation three days that group is of God that means you're forgotten of God because that group cannot hear that group because the group that cannot hear is not of God John 8:44 1444 the group that can and does hear what the Spirit is saying and receives the revelation there is that group described 1st Corinthians 2 they are the ones who have the Spirit of God they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ biosphere they are baptized with the Holy Ghost thank god there's somebody is going to continue his work they don't care what the world thinks they don't care what the their peer pressure is they don't care what the teacher thinks they just want a new birth whatever it cause I want it whatever the price is I want it whatever I have to do to get it I want it yeah I've got to have it it's it's paramount I can't go in the rapture without I must have it what good has been a popular in school and you stay here in the tribulation what good is that what good will that be if you've gained the whole world and lose your soul what good is it look I'm I'm 66 years old if the world if time carries I don't have but a few more years so let's say I'd know I'm happy about it you want to leave this world not today but I'm ready but I tell you what I wouldn't trade place within the 18 to 20 year old and go through it again no sir I've lived my life I'm ready to go on I'd rather be there this stay here however better be up there and stay down here I've seen all this world I want to see no desire ain't looking back and going back and concerned about what's back there I'm pressing forth brother-sister use young people you need that same desire say well I'm young you might be young but somebody somebody is going to be 16 when the rapture takes place somebody's going to be 18 when the rapture takes place somebody's going to be in school when the rapture takes place you be one that's got the Holy Ghost hey man and he brother BAM says and try but I want to get down a few more things he said ever birth is a mess I don't care if it's a top peak decorated hospital room ever births a mess remember the theme of ever apostle was have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed it's very simple receiving a Holy Ghost which is receiving Christ as self same spirit that's the whole purpose of the New Testament which you'll notice this quote paragraph 19 what was the Holy Ghost given for paragraph 19 this is tremendous this whole purpose all that God was they poured into Christ all the Christ was he poured into the church why why now the purpose what was what was God's purpose in sending the holy spirit marked that down John 14 beginning the fourteenth verse in reading through the chapter of the bathe God's purpose we find here and send in the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continues work through the church it's very simple all that God was you know above us in the children of Israel illness in the pillow fire with us in Jesus now he wants to be in us above us with this in us well for him to continue his work because he said I've got to go away I'll send you another comforter he's got to leave he can't stay here with us he's got to go away what is it what is another comforter it's the Holy Spirit's the same spirit of Christ but it's not Jesus in flesh anymore it's that same spirit that he had coming back into the church so he so you you you could continue the work of the church as brother Donna's been preaching on the church yours continuation he is the beginning of the creation of God you are the continuation of the creation of God you have to have the Holy Ghost of being a but be to be qualified to continue the work of God in His Church you have to have the Holy Ghost he's not gonna he's not going to continue he's not he's not even gonna feel unclean vessel you have because you can't do it on your own you can't do it without the Holy Ghost there's one purpose God himself might dwell in the church and continue its plans through the church and you can only do it you think about the Lord about Apostle Peter when he went up into the Upper Room he was scared to death of the Jews they was persecuting his killing killing people he was scared of the Jews he was scared of the he was actually afraid of them why did it why did he deny the Lord Jesus you think he he denied because he was afraid he was afraid when he went up in the upper room he was afraid but when he came out of the upper ooh but that's afraid of him that's the difference before you get the Holy Ghost you might be afraid but well after you get the Holy Ghost the devil is afraid of you well that was good wasn't it then the brother man said when the weakest Christian gets on an easy frame makes a devil tremble that's the weak that's what about the strongest you're Abraham's role your face is your strong in faith I'm just almost getting where I

the greatest message ever struck the earth complete revelation of Jesus Christ you think you're going to get by with being a Mossback church member you're see buddy as the line has begin to shine in the last days he's expecting us a great thing from us because where there's much given there's much required so he's going to require much more of us than he did other Lutheran's or the Methodists because we walk in a greater life with a greater power with a greater a greater witness than they had now we have a greater witness of the resurrection we have things more firmer more sure than they have to him much is given much is required I will say it out front to him much is given much is required you've been given the greatest message in every structure sir you've been invited into the kingdom of the secret kingdom of Almighty God you've been invited to be at the wedding suffered to being the millennium to reign and judging that you've been invited to live in the new city you've been invited to be the wife the Lambs wife you've been invited to be the cream of the crop why wouldn't you want to love him why wouldn't you want to give God your best why wouldn't you want to come to church and serve him with all your heart why would do you want to do that he'd give you the very best why would you want to give him your best Oh hallelujah he gave you the very best he had why would you want to give him the very best you have he saved the best for last he say the very best for last he said it's a prophet the greatest vindicated prophet that we've ever had on the face of the earth outside of the Lord Jesus brother Graham said he didn't he had more success in my ministry that he did in his own Jesus now not brother round me Jesus giving Jesus a credit more vindicated any other messenger the greatest message the seals and opens the revelation of truth all the wonderful things we are understanding and believe the very best and you want to play around with God not me brother not me for me and my house we're gonna serve the Lord for me and my house we're gonna serve the Lord I'm not playing games we're not playing you that's over with you know the rapture may happen next week I don't know but we're that close and remembering I die I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to get into souls are now in prison but but he's expecting more of us we'll just leave it at that he's going to require much more of us than he did Lutheran's or the methods because we walk in a greater light greater power we have a greater witness of the resurrection more for more sure than a ham oh brother we are privileged people musicians why don't you come while I finish up live holy lifts Len live separated don't live a loose life give up the things the world it's not worth it it's not worth it I heard a person tell me I didn't go on path by come on musicians had a person tell me said well I'm gonna let my children grow up and let them make their own decision don't try it don't take them Church don't train them you know just let them grow up that's insanity if you think about it they don't even have a chance because they're born with a snake nature they're born already whipped you might say they're born come as rural speaking lies and if they've never told about God what chance do they have I mean outside of election maybe what chance did to have if you take him if you train train up a child away she go if you train him up right take him to church teach him have a godly home then he's still only got let's just say you know you told him right he's born wrong he has at least a fighting chance but if you know trying to put always to go what chance does he have no wonder brother Ram sent him outside of election now he said a child that's been taking his to church so just paraphrase now child has been raised up in the Lord got a 95% better chance to become a Christian than Wanda don't why because he's been right you take a baby that's born in America he's brand-new let's say I've used the example before you take him to Russia and then he says stays in Russia six years then you bring him back to America he went over Russia when he's six months old he says they're six years he comes back to America what language does he speak Russian duh why does he speak Russian because he was tall Russian well he was born in America I don't care
