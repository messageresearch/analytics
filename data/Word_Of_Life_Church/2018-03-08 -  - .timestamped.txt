[39:10] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[39:13] sit with me in my throne even as I also

[39:18] in his throne brother Branham says bring
[39:21] this the scripture there in verse 21

[39:28] God's domain eternally first John 5 and
[39:34] 4 we'll read verses 4 and 5 excuse me
[39:41] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[39:44] the world and this is the victory that
[39:47] overcometh the world even our faith who
[39:49] is he that overcometh the world but he
[39:52] that believeth that Jesus Christ is the
[39:54] son of God you can be seated I've had
[40:03] this thought for quite some time for
[40:05] over a year so I preached a message and
[40:10] I forgot where I think part of this
[40:13] message was from a message I preached
[40:15] here three years ago but I got the this
[40:20] the last year so this thought of what
[40:23] overcoming has really been on my heart
[40:25] and one reason is because I I want to
[40:28] overcome to the point where I can get
[40:29] out of here I want to to live a life of
[40:33] overcoming it to the point where Satan
[40:35] don't know what to do with me and that's
[40:38] what God is wanting from from each of us
[40:42] to look at the word overcome and the
[40:45] Greek it means to conquer to carry off
[40:47] the victory come off victorious of
[40:50] Christ victorious over all his foes of
[40:53] Christians that hold fast their faith
[40:56] even unto death against the power of
[40:58] their foes and temptations and
[41:00] persecutions when one is arraigned or
[41:03] goes to law to win the case
[41:05] maintain one's cause that's what
[41:09] overcoming is overcoming is it's not
[41:12] just getting up in the morning and
[41:14] reading your quotes to the devil every
[41:15] time he attacks you or throwing the
[41:17] scripture he knows those he knows him
[41:20] lay out of play I was saying church age
[41:23] in Chapter nine brother Bannerman
[41:26] wrote a quick look at these scriptures
[41:28] which involved the Lord Jesus overcoming
[41:31] will bring out the truth of this
[41:33] proposition in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus
[41:36] is tempted of the devil
[41:38] he overcame the personal temptations of
[41:41] Satan by the word and by the word only
[41:42] in each of the three major trials that
[41:46] course bonded exactly to the temptation
[41:48] of the garden in the Garden of Eden the
[41:51] lust of the flesh the lust of the eye
[41:53] and the pride of life Jesus overcame by
[41:56] the word fell to the personal Eve fell
[41:59] to the personal temptation of Satan by
[42:01] following by failing to use the word
[42:03] Adam failing direct dose disobedience
[42:06] Adam went willing we do know that he was
[42:08] not deceived but he did go willingly
[42:10] but Jesus overcame by the word and right
[42:15] now let me say this is the only way to
[42:17] be an overcomer also it is the only way
[42:20] you can know if you're overcoming
[42:21] because that word can't fail
[42:26] in in taking this thought I got to you
[42:31] can't help but take the topic of
[42:33] overcoming and look at the life that
[42:35] we're living the age that we're living
[42:36] in the way the world is tor part where
[42:40] the government's corrupt and you see the
[42:43] issues going on in Ferguson it's it's
[42:46] not just how you say it's not just a
[42:50] black against police and all that it's
[42:53] it's it's a racial issue and Satan knows
[42:56] what he's doing when he stirs that but
[43:01] that's part of as a Christian as a
[43:04] member of the Bride overcoming in this
[43:06] age overcoming is you if you're a member
[43:11] of the bride most things that are
[43:12] happening there you're feeling that
[43:14] pressure that pressure is going to come
[43:16] it's gonna get more so ain't gonna stop
[43:18] there you know we got a taste of it at
[43:23] the first of the year by God's grace we
[43:26] made made it through but Satan is going
[43:29] to try on every hand as hard as he can
[43:31] to push you to a point where you feel
[43:34] like you can't overcome once he get you
[43:36] to the point that you feel that you're
[43:37] defeated he's got you because then when
[43:41] you start feeling like you've defeated
[43:44] you look for other ways other than the
[43:45] word to try to get out get past it
[43:49] so we look at the world today we look at
[43:51] the government's they're worthless
[43:53] Republican Democrat they're all corrupt
[43:57] you know it's been many years that we've
[44:02] seen a politician in the White House the
[44:05] Congress or the Senate that you just
[44:08] really felt like you know that man's a
[44:11] Christian you don't see that anymore
[44:12] it's because we know Satan's got his
[44:15] hand in that to look at our churches our
[44:18] schools kids are fighting battles now
[44:20] that we never dreamed what they would
[44:22] ever fight in this age right now your
[44:25] your child fought a harder battle and
[44:28] lay out to sea than you ever dreamed of
[44:29] fighting yeah
[44:31] and the only way for them to get through
[44:33] that is the Holy Ghost so as I said as I
[44:39] said before if your child comes to you
[44:40] wants to be baptized wants to accept the
[44:43] Lord as your Savior I encourage that
[44:45] especially in the in the and the life
[44:48] we're living and we see people following
[44:51] away or see people just leaving just
[44:54] leaving the word the only that I've
[44:57] thought and thought about that why would
[44:58] people leave something when you look at
[45:01] the way it feels to you the word this
[45:04] message it's everything I can't think of
[45:08] any single thing on the face of the
[45:10] earth not one single thing that you can
[45:12] think of in your life that you would
[45:14] trade for this work but you got people
[45:16] leaving it daily weekly monthly people
[45:20] leaving the work and I've thought about
[45:23] why would people leave something that
[45:26] has no no price its of no earthly value
[45:30] why would somebody and thinking of that
[45:33] and praying about that I got to thinking
[45:37] they were holding on to the message they
[45:40] were holding on with everything they had
[45:42] the only problem was the message wasn't
[45:46] holding them you couldn't hold on with
[45:50] your your own self-will your own
[45:54] strength that you have inside but as a
[45:57] human being yourself will only hold up
[45:59] for so long if you don't get that that
[46:02] that message down on the inside you're
[46:05] gonna lose your grip people are hanging
[46:08] on it's not that they come up with some
[46:11] new revelation when you leave this
[46:12] message God will not give you a new
[46:14] revelation that the message is wrong if
[46:16] he did he would not be God because he's
[46:18] changing his word so you got people that
[46:21] are just leaving
[46:23] for what reason they wanted to fit in if
[46:29] they could have found a way to steep
[46:30] still keep going to the word church a
[46:32] message church and fitting in out in the
[46:35] world they'd have done it but they
[46:38] couldn't stand the condemnation they
[46:39] were getting so they had to leave they
[46:42] couldn't overcome so how do we overcome
[46:50] how did Jesus overcome
[46:52] he said he that overcometh as even I
[46:55] overcame so how did Jesus overcome first
[47:00] we know by the word by giving in to the
[47:05] will of the Father and by dying that's
[47:10] how Jesus overcome sometimes we we go by
[47:15] the word we feel like we're overcoming
[47:17] by the word daily Satan comes against us
[47:20] we go the Scriptures we tell the devil
[47:24] the the the Bible said this the Bible
[47:27] said this brother Branham said this
[47:28] you're not telling him anything he don't
[47:30] know but are you giving it to the will
[47:35] of father sometimes that's too hard
[47:39] sometimes we never reach the dying part
[47:42] because we can't get past the will of
[47:45] the father there's things that God's
[47:47] will for you to do we don't want to go
[47:49] that way it goes against our nature
[47:54] and then we have to die out we have the
[48:00] word to defeat Satan but it's not
[48:04] quoting the word that will defeat the
[48:07] devil it's using the word in your life
[48:12] if you have the word in your life if it
[48:16] is sealed you have the Holy Ghost sealed
[48:18] in your soul you can't help you can't
[48:22] help to live the life as we last Sunday
[48:26] when brother Michael played the the
[48:29] video up there
[48:29] major Ian Thomas talking about how God
[48:34] in you
[48:35] it's he made the description of oil in a
[48:39] lamp the lamp is not going to work
[48:43] harder once you pour the oil in it the
[48:47] lamp is still just a lamp but gas in
[48:51] your car you pour the gas in your car if
[48:56] it's just sitting there it's still just
[48:57] a car the gas is what operates the car
[49:02] it's the gas being gas the oil being old
[49:05] it's God being God in your life he said
[49:08] let God be God functionally that means
[49:12] like God operate in your life so if
[49:17] we're letting God we're allowing God to
[49:19] operate in our life we've got no choice
[49:24] but the word the word to be lived out
[49:26] because it's not you living it you can
[49:29] overcome God never said for you when you
[49:32] come get up in the morning and and you
[49:35] face the devil and you attacking for a
[49:38] while and if you can't do it I'll take
[49:40] over for you
[49:41] beneath a god I'm already to quote here
[49:43] in a minute brother BAM said that God
[49:45] don't want you doing it he wants to do
[49:48] it himself hey if you if you're outside
[49:54] digging a ditch and somebody walks up
[49:55] says let me do that you gonna let them
[49:59] you're gonna let him do the digging
[50:02] that's what's God saying God saying let
[50:04] me do the dig and give me the shovel
[50:05] I'll do it for you when brother Brandon
[50:10] preached putting on the whole armor of
[50:11] God in 62 he said God makes himself
[50:17] present in his army that's us
[50:20] do you believe that now God said I sent
[50:23] him the word Eve just walked over the
[50:26] top of it disbelieved it I made it
[50:28] manifest and they crucified it I'm just
[50:31] getting tired
[50:32] I'm coming myself so here he come God in
[50:36] you God above us the pillar fire God
[50:39] with us in Jesus Christ God in us the
[50:42] Holy Spirit what is it the same word the
[50:44] same God amen no more trusting and
[50:48] anything else God come himself this was
[50:50] a man-sized job so he just brought it on
[50:54] down he come down himself
[50:57] they don't have to do anything about it
[50:59] just let them surrender to me I'll walk
[51:01] in them talking them speaking them
[51:02] working them oh my that's it I'll do the
[51:05] work just let them just humble
[51:08] themselves we know too much to humble
[51:10] ourselves we know too much to the word
[51:14] the oldest scripture went it says in the
[51:17] Bible says if it the brother having
[51:18] aught against you he come
[51:19] tell her sees you in a fault if you see
[51:22] a brother in a fault year to go to it
[51:24] well when you've got a brother or sister
[51:26] that's doing what the word says and
[51:27] going to see to somebody and they're
[51:29] saying brother sister you shouldn't be
[51:32] doing that
[51:32] and we take an attitude they're just
[51:36] doing the word if they're doing it right
[51:39] in love but we refuse to humble
[51:43] ourselves we can't humble ourselves we
[51:45] can't overcome that arrogance that we
[51:48] have because we know some what's more
[51:50] than anybody else that's pretty much
[51:53] goes with the same the truth hurts
[51:55] people don't like it when they telling
[51:56] the truth says I'll do the work
[52:01] just let them humble themselves let them
[52:04] just empty up I'll just beat my enemy
[52:07] out there through them that's what God
[52:09] is saying the enemy is coming answer
[52:13] he wants you to step aside let him use
[52:17] the armor and he'll defeat anything you
[52:20] have that's allowing you the scripture
[52:24] when putting on the you put on the whole
[52:26] armor of God are you trying to operate
[52:30] that armor are you trying to let God
[52:36] I'll finish that quote here
[52:39] well Bram says you can't do it yourself
[52:42] now you're no match for him but if
[52:44] you'll just let God do it get the word
[52:48] in you that'll all be taken care of it's
[52:52] the word that's taking action it's the
[52:55] word in you now that don't mean you stay
[52:58] home lay in your bed and say God will
[53:01] attack the day for me you've got to be a
[53:04] willing vessel you've got to be your in
[53:07] the fight whether you like it or not you
[53:09] were in the fight God didn't want us to
[53:12] face Satan on our own we've been told
[53:15] many times he's a worthy adversary how
[53:18] many times we tried to do it ourselves
[53:20] he just made a bigger mess everything
[53:25] but God will fight your battles look
[53:27] let's look at the armor that we're
[53:29] putting on what what kind of armor do we
[53:32] have vision 611 does put on the whole
[53:36] armor of God that we might be able to
[53:37] stand against the wiles of the devil so
[53:40] what is the armor first is truth truth
[53:48] definition of I went through the
[53:50] definitions of each of the six pieces of
[53:53] body armor their truth what is true and
[53:57] things pertaining to God and the duties
[54:00] of man truth is a personal excellence
[54:04] but that candor of mine which is free
[54:08] from affection pretense simulation
[54:10] falsehood and deceit truth lived out in
[54:15] you there's nothing false about there's
[54:17] nothing fake about it people can see in
[54:21] your life if you're walking in truth or
[54:23] not if you're living if the truth is
[54:26] living out in you
[54:27] second righteousness the state of him
[54:31] who has he ought to be righteousness the
[54:36] conditional condition acceptable to God
[54:39] you can't work righteousness up you
[54:43] can't be a there's no such thing as
[54:47] self-made righteousness
[54:49] there's self-righteous people but it's
[54:52] fake it's put on when I go through these
[54:58] we'll see how they all tie together in
[55:01] and they work together third piece of
[55:04] armour there's peace the tranquil state
[55:08] of a soul assured of its salvation
[55:11] through Christ
[55:12] that's a peace your soul knows that your
[55:15] seal there's a salvation that's in you
[55:18] that's of Christ and nothing can take
[55:20] away faith a conviction or belief
[55:26] respecting man's relationship to God and
[55:29] divine things generally with the
[55:31] included idea of trust and holy fervor
[55:34] born of faith and joined with it it's
[55:38] saying here that it it it works with
[55:40] trust so when you're having faith in
[55:42] something you're having you're trusting
[55:44] God that your faith will bring it to
[55:46] pass salvation saving bringing salvation
[55:53] he who embodies this salvation through
[55:56] whom God is about to achieve it
[56:03] lastly is the word that which is or has
[56:09] been uttered by the living voice things
[56:13] spoken word which this particular word
[56:17] used in Ephesians is Rhema you can't use
[56:22] Rhema by itself we've heard hope series
[56:25] on riemann here this shouldn't be
[56:27] anything new to anybody you can't use
[56:29] Rhema by itself you can't take the word
[56:32] the written word down here when Satan
[56:35] comes against you you can't pull this up
[56:37] and say Satan right here it says now
[56:40] so not tempt the LORD thy God greater is
[56:44] He that is in me then than you
[56:47] he knows all that that's Rhema your you
[56:50] are quoting the word what are you adding
[56:54] to other pieces of armor with it are you
[56:58] adding the faith without the faith this
[57:00] word don't work without the piece it
[57:03] don't work without the truth it don't
[57:06] work without the righteousness it don't
[57:10] work
[57:12] so we're arming ourselves we quote James
[57:16] 4:7 all the time resist the devil and
[57:18] flee Fleming from you but do we forget
[57:21] the first part of that verse wonder why
[57:23] you people always say that resist the
[57:25] devil he'll flee from me resist the
[57:26] devil complete for me they're starting
[57:28] in the middle of a sentence and and
[57:30] quoting it
[57:31] how many knows what the first part of
[57:33] that sentence says submit yourselves to
[57:37] God then resist the devil and he will
[57:40] flee from you
[57:43] people get in their mind that resisting
[57:46] the devil is okay I'm not gonna do that
[57:49] I'm not gonna look at that I'm going I'm
[57:51] gonna put my hands over my head over my
[57:53] eyes resisting is having a desire a
[57:58] burning desire to do the totally
[58:01] opposite it's not going through rehab
[58:06] resisting the devil is not
[58:08] rehabilitation it's having an earthly
[58:12] desire to submit yourself to it's a
[58:14] eternal desire to submit yourself to God
[58:18] and do his will
[58:24] even if you resist even if you submit
[58:27] yourself to God he's gonna come back
[58:30] he's gonna punch you he's gonna hit you
[58:33] we get so we get so caught up and
[58:36] resisting we we forget that that was
[58:39] gonna fight back
[58:40] he's not gonna he's not gonna stop the
[58:43] first time you decide to resist him he's
[58:46] a worthy adversary he don't go down easy
[58:49] he's gonna come back and punch he knows
[58:53] your weak spots he knows where your
[58:54] weakness
[58:54] that never knows where you're living if
[59:00] he'd know he knows that your life is
[59:02] sealed and you're living with God
[59:05] working in you functionally say knows it
[59:13] part of this that I was studying on it
[59:18] was people getting comfortable in battle
[59:21] in the middle of overcoming they
[59:27] obviously it has a thing about it but it
[59:31] can law you to sleep it can make you
[59:35] feel comfortable it can make you feel
[59:37] like everything is okay there's more
[59:42] than one way that the devil can attack
[59:44] you devil will hit you and hit you and
[59:47] hit you or he'll back off when just low
[59:49] you to sleep and then you got people
[59:53] that are if you're comfortable and they
[59:55] obviously you're not fighting you're not
[59:58] fighting you you know you're not armed
[1:00:01] if you're comfortable if you if this
[1:00:04] world that you're living in does not
[1:00:06] make you want to leave you're not
[1:00:10] fighting you're not overcoming the
[1:00:13] things that you need to overcome to get
[1:00:16] out of here you say well I don't hardly
[1:00:17] have anything that I need to overcome
[1:00:19] return your ruler only thing he had to
[1:00:21] overcome was keeping up with the Joneses
[1:00:22] that's all he wanted keep up with the
[1:00:25] Joneses I want money I want to be rich
[1:00:27] you might not think that's nothing but
[1:00:30] it kept him out of heaven hard to cry
[1:00:36] out in desperation the bride's crying
[1:00:39] out in desperation to leave the true
[1:00:41] Bride of Christ is desperate to leave
[1:00:44] this world
[1:00:46] if you're not you need to check your
[1:00:48] salvation but we're crying out it's hard
[1:00:53] to cry out when you're comfortable it's
[1:00:56] hard to cry out when things are going
[1:00:58] good and it's not I was thinking the
[1:01:02] other day at work when you you know the
[1:01:05] internet everything is it's it's just
[1:01:09] crazy the things that's going in the
[1:01:11] world you know Thanks Russia stirring up
[1:01:15] and the things that's going over and the
[1:01:17] homeland and the cities with the the
[1:01:22] race issues that even if it's not
[1:01:26] happening in your hometown
[1:01:30] you've got to something is it gives you
[1:01:33] a greater desire to leave it ain't
[1:01:36] necessarily that is going on don't don't
[1:01:40] think that if it ain't going your
[1:01:41] hometown everything's good true bride
[1:01:44] feels that no matter where it's at but
[1:01:49] we become traditional Christians we get
[1:01:53] you know we walk over the sideline I
[1:01:55] fought for a while I'm going to sit down
[1:01:57] we've become traditional Christians
[1:01:59] Church becomes an event that is
[1:02:03] scheduled in the week it's another thing
[1:02:07] on our list to do we don't look at it as
[1:02:13] I'm going to go hear from God tonight
[1:02:17] we can't we can't overcome that a man
[1:02:20] and flesh is gonna stand on a platform
[1:02:23] I'm gonna read the quotes and tell us
[1:02:25] what it's all about that's the way we
[1:02:27] look at it we don't view it as I'm gonna
[1:02:31] hear from God we can't get past human
[1:02:35] flesh we've got too many things to do
[1:02:38] our mind is too occupied we say we love
[1:02:43] God we want to hear from God but somehow
[1:02:50] big orange keeps overcomes the desire to
[1:02:53] hear from God or your hunting whatever
[1:02:57] you want to do if you want to stay home
[1:03:03] watch your game go hunt go work so you
[1:03:07] can buy that new boat you don't have the
[1:03:15] true desire to overcome you don't have
[1:03:19] the true desire to hear from God you can
[1:03:21] say brother Joe let your own conviction
[1:03:22] know it's not that's the word anything
[1:03:24] you put before God is your God
[1:03:35] I'm you know I like there's things that
[1:03:38] I like I love to hunt I like football I
[1:03:41] don't you know I hope you don't condemn
[1:03:43] me for that I enjoy those things but I
[1:03:46] hope to god that I never have more of a
[1:03:49] desire to do anything more than hearing
[1:03:53] from my lord never if you would
[1:03:58] how can you mull around in your mind
[1:04:00] while you're sitting there deciding with
[1:04:02] you and go to church
[1:04:03] you're gonna kill that book that you
[1:04:05] know the neighbors gonna get if you
[1:04:06] don't get him
[1:04:07] how you gonna justify that what if what
[1:04:12] if you had you were dying what if you
[1:04:15] had cancer what if you had a financial
[1:04:19] decision to make in your life that was
[1:04:22] going to ruin you and God said I'll take
[1:04:25] care of that but I'm gonna go watch
[1:04:26] Notre Dame play football first we can't
[1:04:33] we can't separate our pleasures with God
[1:04:36] pleasure
[1:04:37] God's pleasures talking about overcoming
[1:04:43] you know when I look at my cell there's
[1:04:46] things in my life I have to overcome I'm
[1:04:48] not if right now I could tell you right
[1:04:51] now that I look at my life and it makes
[1:04:54] me sick sometimes when you look at your
[1:04:57] full life you go through the week and
[1:04:59] you think oh I shouldn't have done that
[1:05:01] or I shouldn't do this decisions that we
[1:05:06] make and they come back and bite you
[1:05:08] because you didn't seek the Lord for it
[1:05:11] we got it over we we got to overcome the
[1:05:16] fleshly desires I don't I don't mean to
[1:05:22] step when he told you like every you
[1:05:24] know when it comes to my heart I'm you
[1:05:26] know I won't apologize
[1:05:33] when we put on the whole armour of God
[1:05:35] when we put on all those six six things
[1:05:38] that I just read to you you are God in
[1:05:42] flesh God in flesh sometimes our our
[1:05:48] human minds cannot comprehend that we
[1:05:50] cannot understand how you say you are
[1:05:54] God in flesh it's God in you it's God's
[1:06:01] armor on you and God fighting your
[1:06:04] battles for you we can't we have a hard
[1:06:08] time adjusting to the armor maybe where
[1:06:13] God has one tailored fit to meet you for
[1:06:15] you young people he's got one tailor fit
[1:06:18] for your size the things that you go
[1:06:20] through at school peer pressure I know I
[1:06:23] talked I talked to my boys I know a lot
[1:06:25] of my boys friends you know things that
[1:06:28] some of them do it's totally
[1:06:30] unbelievable I go up there that pick
[1:06:32] pick him up practice and you got 15 year
[1:06:35] old 14 year old freshman walk out big
[1:06:38] dip spitting their daddy sitting beside
[1:06:40] him I can wear a ticket book out but you
[1:06:45] know I've teased him about that too but
[1:06:51] but look what they go with what they go
[1:06:53] through God wants to see a young person
[1:06:59] become God in flesh putting on the whole
[1:07:01] armor of God there's nothing you can't
[1:07:03] overcome the peer pressure don't matter
[1:07:06] you know you get look down because you
[1:07:07] you young ladies have long hair because
[1:07:10] you wear skirts because you don't wear
[1:07:12] makeup because you you bow your head and
[1:07:15] pray when you go to lunch one day you'll
[1:07:22] reap your reward one day wearing the
[1:07:25] armor of God will pay great dividends
[1:07:28] it's an honor to wear the armor of God
[1:07:33] there's a saying to be yourself don't
[1:07:39] try to be somebody else
[1:07:41] just be yourself because everybody else
[1:07:43] is taken so why would God why would God
[1:07:55] allow us tests and trials why would God
[1:07:56] let allow a young person testing trials
[1:07:59] why would they let him go through the
[1:08:01] things that good they go through
[1:08:02] nowadays because he trusts him with the
[1:08:06] armor he trusts us with his armor and
[1:08:11] the brother Brahim said God gives you a
[1:08:13] trial because he because he trusts you
[1:08:15] with it
[1:08:19] don't look at a couple gentlemen that
[1:08:23] you know in those scriptures here that
[1:08:24] had to overcome first one we want to
[1:08:28] look at his Joe keep in mind Joe did not
[1:08:33] have the Holy Ghost so why did Joe why
[1:08:38] did Satan choose Joe I've got my own
[1:08:43] opinion about that and this is not
[1:08:44] gospel and this is my own opinion
[1:08:46] everybody's got different opinions about
[1:08:47] everything I think I shared your brother
[1:08:49] Larry one day I've got my own opinion on
[1:08:52] why Satan chose Joe remember in the
[1:08:59] garden God said coke the devil told
[1:09:02] Satan the her seed would bruise bruises
[1:09:05] hit have that to them to seeds God hid
[1:09:10] that seed that natural see God hid it
[1:09:12] all the way coming up through Christ God
[1:09:15] hid that seed Satan's entire time this
[1:09:17] is my opinion Satan has looked for that
[1:09:21] seed ever since to destroy that seed and
[1:09:24] who but job could be that seed we know
[1:09:28] he wasn't but who but job could be that
[1:09:33] seed only the seed of God could be that
[1:09:37] perfect why else would God put a hedge
[1:09:40] around
[1:09:42] why else would God protect him
[1:09:45] so Satan comes to me he didn't even ask
[1:09:48] God for joke God just said hey you want
[1:09:50] him he does that to us you're on the
[1:09:56] mountain for two months and you're
[1:09:57] praying and reading and you're getting
[1:09:59] in church and the the Lord speaking the
[1:10:02] word to you you're feeling it you feel
[1:10:03] the growth and all sudden you get up
[1:10:07] Monday morning and you've been hit with
[1:10:08] something you never saw coming
[1:10:12] it happens
[1:10:16] God said have you considered my servant
[1:10:18] whis and got threw you under the bus by
[1:10:22] the West but isn't he does that all the
[1:10:26] time
[1:10:27] because he trusts you he knows your
[1:10:29] armor he knows your strengths he knows
[1:10:32] you can overcome he's not going to give
[1:10:34] a major battle major test as somebody
[1:10:38] that he can't trust with his armor he's
[1:10:42] gonna keep working on him till they get
[1:10:43] the armor on right so he goes to Joe we
[1:10:47] know we know those scriptures that talks
[1:10:49] about a job loved God sacrificed every
[1:10:53] day for his first children there was no
[1:10:55] fault in him God even said he's perfect
[1:10:58] not touji was perfect you're perfect
[1:11:03] Sayed was right over omen to and fro and
[1:11:05] he comes up to before God and God says
[1:11:09] hey how about Joe Satan said well you've
[1:11:13] got a hedge around him you won't let me
[1:11:15] do nothing so God offered the most
[1:11:18] perfect nail and facing the earth so but
[1:11:20] you can't take his life so Joe because
[1:11:27] hearts going through his trials his
[1:11:28] friends come tell him you've sinned
[1:11:30] you've done this I start lying to him
[1:11:32] basically you've done this you've done
[1:11:34] in JP Jobe knew he had but as Joel jabs
[1:11:38] trials kept going on and on Joe began to
[1:11:42] look at the good things that he done he
[1:11:48] began to look at the flowers the trees
[1:11:50] how come those how come when a tree dies
[1:11:54] it comes back how come when a flower
[1:11:57] dies it comes back began to look at
[1:12:01] himself I've done this what why would
[1:12:03] this happen to me we do that we throw
[1:12:05] our goodness back into God's face
[1:12:07] sometimes got those astrology and you
[1:12:11] think God look I've been doing good for
[1:12:14] for two months why would you give me
[1:12:16] this because you've been doing good for
[1:12:18] two months
[1:12:20] that's why you're going to get it you
[1:12:23] can't you can't be molded and shaped
[1:12:25] unless you're going through tests and
[1:12:27] trials and it's hard to do when God
[1:12:30] throws you a trial it's hard to rejoice
[1:12:33] it's hard to start praising God and say
[1:12:35] thank you Lord for this trial because
[1:12:38] it's not what you want but it's what you
[1:12:40] need my Paul said I rejoice in my
[1:12:43] infirmities my glory in my tribulations
[1:12:49] so as joke goes on Joe how many Nobel
[1:12:55] Bram said job wrongly accused God Marie
[1:13:01] quote from God's provided way keep in
[1:13:04] mind joke did not sin but Bram said he
[1:13:07] did not sin the Bible says he did not
[1:13:09] sin God's provided way there was a
[1:13:13] profit that's right there was a profit
[1:13:15] back there he didn't know just exactly
[1:13:17] what the will of God was for him he
[1:13:20] waited he didn't know what to do so the
[1:13:23] first thing you know when everything
[1:13:25] seemed to go wrong his comforters
[1:13:27] wouldn't comfort him then God was under
[1:13:29] obligation down from the east came a
[1:13:31] little fellow Elihu Ella he stood to him
[1:13:36] said now look we put it in childlike
[1:13:40] form job said now look I see the trees
[1:13:43] when they die they live again the
[1:13:45] flowers when they die they live again
[1:13:47] but man lay it down he has to give up
[1:13:49] the ghost he wastes it the way his sons
[1:13:52] come to honor him but where is he
[1:13:54] someone job's mine when I die I'm done
[1:13:57] I'm not coming back Joe hadn't had a
[1:14:00] revelation yet shortly hereafter he gets
[1:14:03] a revelation he couldn't overcome his
[1:14:07] own intellect his own thought and in his
[1:14:09] mind I died I'm done I'm never coming
[1:14:13] back there he didn't have her he didn't
[1:14:15] see the resurrection yet he said he has
[1:14:20] to give up the ghost he wasted the way
[1:14:21] his sons come to honor him but where is
[1:14:23] he
[1:14:23] oh that thou would hide me in the grave
[1:14:25] and so forth Ellie who said now wait
[1:14:28] joke by the banks out like this wait job
[1:14:32] you're accusing
[1:14:33] got wrong now that flower hasn't sinned
[1:14:37] God has a provided way for that flower
[1:14:40] to live again and then we go on in God
[1:14:45] asking Joe where were you and I laid the
[1:14:49] foundation of the world before I laid it
[1:14:51] when the sons of God sang together and
[1:14:53] the morning star shouted for joy
[1:14:55] I gave brother Terry this quote you are
[1:14:58] my witness he's my twin died about two
[1:15:00] years ago to preach on it he ain't done
[1:15:01] it so I decided to use so Jobe and Jones
[1:15:09] mine when I die I'm finished it's over
[1:15:15] there's no resurrection I'm not coming
[1:15:19] back but where do I go beginning and
[1:15:23] ending of the Gentile disposition
[1:15:24] brother Brandon 55 brother Graham said
[1:15:26] see we come out of eternity we was
[1:15:29] before there was a world as you know
[1:15:30] that God made man in his own image where
[1:15:34] was you he said to Joe when Jobe thought
[1:15:36] he had some wisdom said that where were
[1:15:39] you when I laid the foundation of the
[1:15:40] world before I laid when the sons of God
[1:15:43] sing together and the morning star
[1:15:45] shouted for joy you might wonder why I'm
[1:15:50] going off on a tangent here but I'll
[1:15:52] come back to overcoming in a minute the
[1:15:55] morning star shouted for joy never shot
[1:15:56] anyone shouted for joy when they seen
[1:15:58] that someday through a tabernacle here
[1:16:00] on earth the King Melchizedek would come
[1:16:03] back in the righteousness of God give
[1:16:05] his life to redeem us to God back again
[1:16:08] and outshine the Stars forever and ever
[1:16:11] so looking at this The Shining ones
[1:16:13] shouted for joy because why because they
[1:16:17] were seeing that Melchizedek would come
[1:16:19] back in body and Tabernacle himself in
[1:16:21] human flesh and the lives of those he
[1:16:25] tabernacled himself in without shine
[1:16:27] them stars forever and ever
[1:16:29] that's a true overcomer but it don't in
[1:16:32] their spiritual amnesia Bela Bram said
[1:16:37] we don't want not to be a true Christian
[1:16:38] you have to be the same we don't want to
[1:16:40] forget that all that he was
[1:16:42] I'm identified with him I'm identified
[1:16:44] with him notice he was in
[1:16:46] him notice then every Christian that's a
[1:16:50] real genuine Christian was with him when
[1:16:53] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:16:55] sons of God shouted for joy before there
[1:16:58] was a foundation of the world
[1:16:59] we were identified in the immortal
[1:17:01] realms with God ten million years before
[1:17:04] the world was ever formed I was back
[1:17:07] there with him if I got eternal life now
[1:17:11] I was there with him I was identified
[1:17:16] with him when the morning stars sang
[1:17:18] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:17:21] joy who were those sons of God shouted
[1:17:24] for joy how many was there brother
[1:17:32] Branham I was telling brother Bradley
[1:17:34] for service this that particular quote
[1:17:38] that I gave brother to brother Terry I
[1:17:41] had used it in a sermon I think up in
[1:17:44] New York or something but it really
[1:17:45] after I get with you brother Terry I
[1:17:48] wondered why I gave it to him because he
[1:17:49] took it and I had to hunt it back up and
[1:17:53] and it just ate at me and hated me and
[1:17:55] there's I think there's something in
[1:17:57] there that I couldn't and I had a
[1:18:00] question and a 90's brother Donny about
[1:18:04] it and I came to church I was telling a
[1:18:07] vow that came to church and this is what
[1:18:10] he preached on this point right here
[1:18:11] adoption number 260 so beautifully
[1:18:14] displayed in the prodigal son I was lost
[1:18:16] this is my son he was lost and now he's
[1:18:19] found he was dead he's alive again bring
[1:18:21] forth the fatted calf the best robe or
[1:18:23] ring put it on his finger no wonder when
[1:18:25] the morning stars saying together in the
[1:18:27] sons of God shouted for joy when they
[1:18:29] seen the plan of salvation God putting
[1:18:32] your name on the book before the
[1:18:35] foundation of the world
[1:18:38] brother Donnie right dad just some come
[1:18:41] over me
[1:18:41] I saw my name wrote down I don't
[1:18:44] remember it but that's why shouted I
[1:18:48] shouted around the throne of God you
[1:18:52] shouted around the throne of God
[1:18:54] how could not you not rejoice over that
[1:18:59] you realize what you're doing when you
[1:19:01] come to church Saturday Sunday and
[1:19:03] Wednesday God is jogging your memory
[1:19:05] trying to get you to remember what you
[1:19:07] saw before the foundation of the world
[1:19:10] thank you
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:19] cerfancy bud Brandt said he's praying
[1:19:23] this is how he opened it this is how he
[1:19:25] actually open serpents 1858 dear God
[1:19:31] the great and mighty God who formed all
[1:19:34] things by the power of his Spirit has
[1:19:43] brought Jesus Christ His only begotten
[1:19:45] Son who freely died for we sinners the
[1:19:49] just for the unjust to reconcile us back
[1:19:52] into this marvelous fellowship that we
[1:19:53] have again with God we are taught in the
[1:19:57] blessed word that we had fellowship with
[1:19:59] him before the foundation of the world
[1:20:01] when the morning stars sang together the
[1:20:05] sons of God shouted for joy way back
[1:20:08] before the foundation of the world how
[1:20:12] do we know that there wasn't the same
[1:20:13] time that the lamb was slain that when
[1:20:16] God is great thinking seeing us
[1:20:18] shouting and rejoicing in our salvation
[1:20:21] through Jesus Christ you stop and think
[1:20:25] a minute what were you shouting for
[1:20:27] what were you rejoice in brother Branham
[1:20:28] said was because you've seen the plan of
[1:20:30] salvation and here is Joe all depressed
[1:20:33] I'm dying I'm not coming back so God
[1:20:37] says Joe where were you
[1:20:41] what God knew that joke didn't know God
[1:20:43] knew that joke was one of those around
[1:20:44] the throne shouting and rejoicing
[1:20:47] because before the foundation of the
[1:20:49] world job seen the plan of salvation he
[1:20:53] didn't remember it brother Branham said
[1:20:55] in the breech the God handed drove
[1:20:58] binoculars and let job look four
[1:21:01] thousand years ahead and saw the
[1:21:04] crucifixion saw the resurrection and
[1:21:09] after after God jog job's memory job
[1:21:14] said I know my redeemer liveth so how
[1:21:19] can we overcome no we can overcome in
[1:21:22] this age because before the foundation
[1:21:26] of the world God revealed to you that
[1:21:30] you would overcome and Laodicea when you
[1:21:33] saw the plan of salvation before the
[1:21:35] foundation of the world you can overcome
[1:21:37] by representation of your theophany you
[1:21:41] already knew that you would overcome and
[1:21:44] here you come every service and God's
[1:21:47] jogging your memory and you remembering
[1:21:49] a little bit at a time you remembering a
[1:21:51] little bit at a time and overcoming
[1:21:55] power get stronger the more your
[1:21:56] memories job the more that comes back to
[1:21:59] you and brother Branham was preaching on
[1:22:00] them with spiritual amnesia your memory
[1:22:03] starts coming back you start you don't
[1:22:06] remember you being around the throne but
[1:22:08] God's jogging your memory this is what
[1:22:09] the plan of salvation is that is Christ
[1:22:11] living in you putting on the whole armor
[1:22:14] of God and conquering and lay up see
[1:22:22] young people let me tell you you can
[1:22:26] overcome by representation if you have
[1:22:28] the Holy Ghost sealed in yourself every
[1:22:32] time you come in here and you sit down
[1:22:34] you pay attention to the word you pray
[1:22:37] you read God's jogging your memory
[1:22:40] you're going to see how you can overcome
[1:22:45] because you already saw it before the
[1:22:47] foundation of the world
[1:22:50] another gentleman we want to look at a
[1:22:52] dear brother brother John you might not
[1:22:57] see how John the Revelator would tie in
[1:23:01] to overcoming but but they've solid was
[1:23:07] up here preaching one day and I had
[1:23:09] already had this thought and it's been
[1:23:10] about six months ago he was up here
[1:23:13] preaching part on John it just hit me
[1:23:17] when John I'm if you can't turn to
[1:23:20] Revelation 5 1 through 4 and we'll read
[1:23:21] that what every parts of that scripture
[1:23:24] there revelation 5 chapter 1
[1:23:32] I mean chapter 5 first 1 through 4 and I
[1:23:36] saw on the right hand of him that sat on
[1:23:38] the throne a book written within and on
[1:23:40] the backside sealed with seven seals and
[1:23:42] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:23:46] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:23:48] book to loose the seals thereof no man
[1:23:50] in heaven nor in earth neither under the
[1:23:52] earth was able to open the book neither
[1:23:54] to look thereon and I wept much because
[1:23:57] no man was found worthy to open and read
[1:24:00] the book neither to look thereon if he
[1:24:05] you were John was caught up in the
[1:24:07] spirit had the Holy Ghost and it been
[1:24:10] revealed to him that no one was worthy
[1:24:12] what that meant was all creation was
[1:24:15] lost
[1:24:16] John was lost everybody was lost so do
[1:24:21] you think John had any overcome the
[1:24:22] power at that time right there he didn't
[1:24:25] have any
[1:24:26] he was in the spirit had the holy ghost
[1:24:29] and caught up in the spirit and felt
[1:24:31] defeated because all was lost but man
[1:24:40] sitting the breach when you and John
[1:24:41] looked John didn't see the line because
[1:24:43] lamb wasn't there yet the lamb wasn't
[1:24:47] there brother Branham told us where the
[1:24:48] land was that said we went back into the
[1:24:51] eternities to make intercession for all
[1:24:54] those sacrifices to the Old Testament he
[1:24:58] was giving overcoming power to all those
[1:25:00] that were living under the bull the
[1:25:02] blood of bulls and goats making good
[1:25:05] their sacrifices without that lamb Abel
[1:25:08] was lost without that lamb David was
[1:25:10] lost they was all lost but God rich in
[1:25:17] mercy because I go back and pick him
[1:25:19] back up John didn't seem the brand said
[1:25:25] then he came out through glory through
[1:25:28] the Fontan through the throne revelation
[1:25:33] 5 verse 5 through 7 one of the elders
[1:25:38] said unto me we've not behold behold
[1:25:45] means to turn the eyes to gaze upon
[1:25:51] behold turning your eyes gaze upon the
[1:25:55] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:25:58] David hath prevailed to open the book to
[1:26:01] loose the seals thereof
[1:26:03] now John could have stayed in his
[1:26:06] depressed state and not look just said
[1:26:07] yeah okay and in his mind there's a lion
[1:26:10] behind him but the voice told him to
[1:26:14] behold it to look at it so he said I
[1:26:19] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:26:20] and of the four beasts in the midst of
[1:26:24] the elders stood a lamb as it had been
[1:26:26] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:26:29] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:26:31] forth and to all the earth and he came
[1:26:33] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:26:36] of him that sat upon the throne
[1:26:41] WAM had to take the book the lamb hadn't
[1:26:45] taken the book our names wouldn't been
[1:26:47] revealed
[1:26:47] John's names wouldn't been revealed
[1:26:50] we're gonna jump down to verse 13 if you
[1:26:53] will I'll hurry and every creature which
[1:26:57] one is in heaven and on the earth and
[1:27:00] under the earth and such hour in the sea
[1:27:03] in all them therein that pretty much
[1:27:05] means everywhere heard I sang blessing
[1:27:08] and honor and glory and power be unto
[1:27:09] him that sitteth upon the throne and to
[1:27:11] the lamb forevermore John was not just
[1:27:14] rejoicing because the book was open
[1:27:18] John was glad for that but that is not
[1:27:20] what gave John overcoming power the same
[1:27:24] thing that gave John overcoming power
[1:27:26] can give you overcoming power if you see
[1:27:29] your name in that book
[1:27:31] John rejoiced because he saw his name in
[1:27:35] the book we can read in the breech
[1:27:38] brother Branham said what a Jubilee
[1:27:40] going on in heaven when the lamb bleeds
[1:27:43] that leaves that intercessory box to
[1:27:45] come here to possess his claim
[1:27:47] you know what got next to John he must
[1:27:49] have saw his name wrote there when them
[1:27:51] seals broke he must have got real happy
[1:27:53] listen what he said he said every
[1:27:55] creature which is in heaven and on earth
[1:27:56] underneath the earth such her in the sea
[1:27:59] and all that in them is he in them
[1:28:01] hurting me saying blessing honor glory
[1:28:04] power to him that sits upon the throne
[1:28:06] to the lamb forever a man and a man and
[1:28:09] a man and the four beasts said a man and
[1:28:12] the four and twenty elders fell down and
[1:28:14] worship Him that lives for ever and ever
[1:28:18] so when I would say John at that point
[1:28:21] he didn't care what they did to him he
[1:28:24] had a revelation of where he was who he
[1:28:27] was and where he was going when you get
[1:28:31] to that point to me out when I look at
[1:28:34] that God was showing John again this is
[1:28:37] what I showed you before the foundation
[1:28:39] of the world John brother Branham said
[1:28:41] John was showing the plan of salvation
[1:28:44] talk about a Jubilee talk about a time
[1:28:47] when that lamb walked forth see the
[1:28:49] books even sealed in heaven the
[1:28:50] mysteries say is my name there
[1:28:54] I don't know I hope it is but if it is
[1:28:56] it was put on the book before the
[1:28:57] foundation of the world and the first
[1:28:59] thing that represented a trip
[1:29:00] represented that Redemption come to Lamb
[1:29:03] and had been slain before the foundation
[1:29:05] of the world he took the book glory
[1:29:07] opened the book tore off the seals set
[1:29:09] it down to earth to seven things
[1:29:11] revealed to his people there you are oh
[1:29:14] my what happened the screams the shouts
[1:29:17] the hallelujah is the anointed the power
[1:29:19] the glory the manifestation and Oh John
[1:29:21] when he was standing there a brother
[1:29:22] crying why he said everything in heaven
[1:29:24] everything in earth and everything to
[1:29:26] see heard me holler
[1:29:27] amen blessings honor and power my power
[1:29:30] to him that lives forever and ever talk
[1:29:34] about a time when them seals broke John
[1:29:36] must have looked in and seen past the
[1:29:38] curtain of time and said there's John oh
[1:29:39] he was so happy everything in heaven he
[1:29:43] must have really cried out didn't he
[1:29:44] everything in heaven everything in earth
[1:29:46] everything beneath the earth every
[1:29:48] creature and everything else heard me
[1:29:51] saying Amen blessings and glory and
[1:29:54] wisdom and power and might and riches
[1:29:56] belong to him amen
[1:29:59] John saw my name I have no doubt my name
[1:30:03] is on that book if I doubted it I
[1:30:05] wouldn't be here tonight I wouldn't be
[1:30:07] wasting y'all time but I believe it with
[1:30:10] everything was in me and I know begun a
[1:30:12] shot of a doubt before the foundation of
[1:30:15] the world
[1:30:16] I was rejoicing because I see my name
[1:30:21] that's what makes me an overcomer I know
[1:30:24] I had represent representation before
[1:30:26] the foundation of the world I was
[1:30:28] shouting for me I was shouting for my
[1:30:31] salvation what have I got to lose I've
[1:30:34] already been there and I'm going back
[1:30:45] if your if you were there before by
[1:30:48] representation if you were there if your
[1:30:50] name was there there's no way it's
[1:30:53] totally impossible for you to lose true
[1:30:56] you're gonna you're gonna be armed
[1:30:58] you got the armor on you got the whole
[1:31:02] armor on Satan knows you there that
[1:31:04] having the armor on his nothing keep
[1:31:05] Satan from attacking you and if I can
[1:31:10] stress this if he's attacking you he got
[1:31:11] you if Satan is attacking young people
[1:31:16] he sees you have value you take anything
[1:31:20] that God holds valuable but the way I
[1:31:28] look at it to me I hope you know that I
[1:31:32] can take that revelation that God gave
[1:31:34] me when I was studying this and black
[1:31:36] the devil's eye as hard as I can
[1:31:39] there's nothing to stop you if you were
[1:31:41] there before the foundation of the world
[1:31:42] there's nothing on this earth can stop
[1:31:45] you nothing it's impossible that's
[1:31:48] totally impossible
[1:31:50] that's about as impossible is the word
[1:31:54] impossible I guess but how many
[1:31:58] overcomers well let's stand together
[1:32:04] [Applause]
[1:32:17] I've got everything here to lose and on
[1:32:20] the other side of got everything to gain
[1:32:22] I don't want to be here anymore
[1:32:24] I'm tired of getting up and fighting
[1:32:28] every day fighting every day it's a
[1:32:31] fight the fights are gonna get harder if
[1:32:33] you're the bride the fights gonna get
[1:32:34] harder in it
[1:32:36] I'm tired of fight I hate this place if
[1:32:39] I've ever hated thing in my life I hate
[1:32:42] this place that I live I have prayed
[1:32:45] fervently beg God Lord let me awake in
[1:32:50] the morning in a new wife I don't want
[1:32:54] to be here no more I hate this place
[1:32:58] with everything
[1:33:01] godly that is in me when you look at it
[1:33:06] you look at the things that are
[1:33:07] happening you look at the the timepiece
[1:33:11] of Israel you look at Russia Russia's
[1:33:12] moving the reading of the day they're
[1:33:15] moving a whole convoy back into Ukraine
[1:33:17] which is gonna stir a lot of trouble and
[1:33:23] you look at the the rights issues
[1:33:26] everybody's gay rights and civil rights
[1:33:29] and all that it's all it's all there to
[1:33:32] cost contention that's all it's for it's
[1:33:34] it's as part of Satan's plan cause
[1:33:37] contention to mess with your mind to
[1:33:39] make you reason to make you wonder where
[1:33:42] you're at but we've heard for years you
[1:33:47] know the gates are in sight the gates
[1:33:50] are right there we're closer now closer
[1:33:55] now than we ever thought we we sing that
[1:33:59] song I'm running my last mile home I'm
[1:34:02] running my last hundred yards that's how
[1:34:05] close how believe it is I had we have to
[1:34:13] run we're in a race
[1:34:15] the bride would run hardest when she's
[1:34:17] in the straight this trade away when she
[1:34:20] can see the finish line and that's when
[1:34:21] the bride they fight the hardest or run
[1:34:24] the hardest will overcome the most when
[1:34:26] she's in in the straightaway I had to I
[1:34:30] had hired a coach to work with my oldest
[1:34:34] for football and he would have him and
[1:34:38] other boys he was training they would
[1:34:39] run to hit the 250 it's 250 yards around
[1:34:42] the track you'd have to go around to
[1:34:44] terms and he would stay on the others he
[1:34:48] would stand at the finish line I would
[1:34:50] stand beside him and he would tell Gabe
[1:34:55] he said Gabe go and me being the father
[1:34:58] I would look at my son I would look at
[1:35:01] him running I'd hi the father would tell
[1:35:04] the coach hingle make his time with that
[1:35:08] pace and he would yell at him Gabe you
[1:35:10] better pick it up pick it up a little
[1:35:14] bit but he wouldn't make his time after
[1:35:19] about two or three months I standing at
[1:35:23] the finish line watching I thought he
[1:35:26] might beat his table he keeps that pace
[1:35:28] Gabe you keep that pace you'll beat your
[1:35:31] time the father would tell the coach and
[1:35:34] the coach would tell the son when he
[1:35:38] would come around the last stretch he
[1:35:41] would yell at him run Gabe run that's
[1:35:45] when he would run his hardest that's
[1:35:49] when he would overcome his tongue he
[1:35:52] would have his buddies standing at the
[1:35:54] in line yelling for him go Gabe Rudd
[1:35:56] yeah we're in the same kind of race
[1:36:03] when you come around that turn there's
[1:36:06] nothing left but the finish line your
[1:36:08] terms are gone your turns are behind you
[1:36:10] your loved ones are sent in to finish
[1:36:12] line and every service you come in here
[1:36:15] the father has already talked to coach
[1:36:17] the coach is coming up here telling you
[1:36:20] run little bride run you've got a
[1:36:23] hundred yards left that's all you got
[1:36:25] left why would you jog now why would you

[1:36:38] gonna win this race I'm gonna win this
[1:36:41] race with everything that's within me
[1:36:43] and I'm gonna beat my time and I want to
[1:36:45] step into eternity if that ain't your

[1:37:34] things in my life I can't overcome I can
[1:37:36] look at mine and I can say that there's
[1:37:40] things that I could change in my life
[1:37:42] there's things that I could add to this
[1:37:45] armor I can tighten this armor up some
[1:37:50] but you look at your life and you say
[1:37:52] brother Joe I need strength I don't
[1:37:58] matter if you got the Holy Ghost you're
