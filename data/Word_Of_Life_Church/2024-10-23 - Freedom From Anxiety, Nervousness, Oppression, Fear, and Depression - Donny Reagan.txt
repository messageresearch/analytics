sister Jennifer no I said that because you brought 65 people off that roof you did those things and honor and glory to you people have need Lord You've provided that need already so father we're stepping into the vision as children of God and we're going to take a hold of what you've already given us and possess it and walk forward as overcoming Christians and testifying of the things you've already done even if we don't see it that's faith in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you brother Keith us if you'll come at this time we'll receive the tithe and offering and give unto the

tonight not just from your mouths but from your soul you are one blessed human being that's right a lot of folks that like to heal like Jesus they wouldn't mind even walking on water like Jesus raising the Dead Like Jesus being able to do all kinds of things of their own sort what they would pick but I wonder how many wants to be hated despised rejected Jesus reputation was not made among messeng people his reputation was made among Liars prostitutes thieves Tax Collectors the number one IRS agent in Israel and you imagine the Lord Jesus taking an IRS agent as W say and said I want you to write a book I'll even let it be called after your name the Book of Matthew now some of us we wouldn't have give them the time of day cuz we're so holy and so Pious and so high and mighty ain't we I'll tell you friends I don't want to have that attitude myself I want to be like Jesus amen so my reputation is made among those that other folks won't have nothing to do with so be if my reputation is made among those that are have a terrible evil rep reputation God Saves evil people some of the most evil people I ever dealt with in my life are church people anyway sometimes Ain can be mean or the rattlesnake twice as fast so well praise the Lord that's a good greeting wouldn't it how yall doing we're good you good all right praise the lord well we certainly appreciate the kindness of the Lord to us and want to say we had a a really good youth service over in North Carolina the Lord really moved and blessed the services there and brother Andrew of course always does a great job and brother digs done done a really good job as well and had a prayer line on Saturday night and I'm still hearing of the things that the Lord Jesus done it was absolutely wonderful to see what our Lord done and how he came by I got several uh things today and just absolutely phenomenal what the Lord is doing Matthew chap 6: 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not life more than meat and the body than Raymond let me read it to you again now therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life look at the word thought take thought be careful to be anxious or in other words to have anxiety now would not this be the common thing that most of us would be so concerned about why could Jesus say such a thing take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink near yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than rment now look in verse 31 therefore take no Sal saying what shall we eat eat or what shall we drink again the same word there thought is to be anxious for so Jesus is not saying well don't go to the grocery store and don't plan your meals and don't even worry about it I mean just happy gol lucky just be like the birds and The Sparrows you know just sit around the house and twiddly thumbs and wait on God to drop something out of Heaven he's not saying that to us but what he wants to get over to us is that we are not so anxious and so tore up listen how he breaks this down what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek oh wow wonder why he didn't say Jews for all these things the Gentile seek so then we as Gentiles maybe we need to pay pay special heed to this since Jesus specifically this is a racial scripture it's aimed for the race of the Gentiles in particular amen and some of the Gentiles said all right okay for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you so you see it's not that he doesn't want us to pray over it and think about it but he doesn't want it to be the priority of our life the first priority will be the kingdom of God verse 34 take therefore no Sal anxiety to be anxious tore up worried for the moral for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself who ever thought tomorrow could think you see why the words of the Bible can seem absolute foolishness to people who go just by education and signs for the martal shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof now I mentioned to you the prayer line for a reason brother Jason and them do their prayer line a little bit different there at the yam so they have two preachers up here two here two here two here and two there like five different positions then the deacons will bring people up to these two these two these two instead of one guy having to pray for basically everybody then it kind of divides it up so he wanted to put brother Diggs and myself together and then other brothers that they pick to put together brother Diggs and I kind of stood in the middle and I noticed as we started praying that it was one after another after another after another after another after another and this one word kept being requested prayer for anxiety anxiety some of those you were standing in the prayer line for their parents cuz some of the parents wasn't going to church some of the parents had got cold on God and the youth were standing in for their parents some of the requests are just heartbreaking of course they're private anyway so I'm not going to tell it any all but I was so curious so the next morning which was on Sunday morning the ministers was back in the office there to pray before the service started so I asked the rest of the brothers that was praying here here and and there I said' Brothers I'm just curious did you all get a lot of request for anxiety and every one of those preachers which had doubled up every one of them said it was the biggest request that they prayed for brother Jason spoke up and said brother Donnie I've noticed it in the last two years he said last year anxiety was 3 to one three to one greater than every other need that was mentioned some were oppression some were you know just different stress and things like that but after that on Sunday and then I talked to a couple more preachers afterwards and and they said the exact same thing one after another after another so since I've come home on Sunday afternoon I've not been able to get this off of my heart so I'm going to speak to you tonight on freedom from anxiety nervousness oppression fear and depression and if you'll listen tonight to the word of the Lord and you'll be able to open your hearts in faith some of you will not even need prayer he'll deliver you as you're hearing the word amen let's pray together shall we heavenly father I stand here tonight at your bidding Lord God you see our needs we know that they are many you know the needs of your children around the world father we've come here tonight to report for service dear God all we can do is prepare ourself and as a minister I can pray and study and then as you give me inspiration and I break into the channel of your anointing then try to put it together as best I can and Lord as I set Monday and I went downstairs to study and your anointing came to where I was and I sat there father for a couple of hours under your presence Hallelujah after a bit I got up a little bit after 9: and went up get me a little something to drink Carol said you okay I said yeah I'm just exhausted been sitting under the anointing so Lord I believe you have something in your heart for us tonight so dear God we ask you that you just come and speak to us Lord I bind every devil every demon spirit that would try to hinder us tonight speak to us from your words father Hallelujah we look to you tonight for you are our deliverer our Mighty God take charge of this service May every evil spirit be brought subject to the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ for it's in his name and he is the word that we ask it amen and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated as I've done a little research and looking on anxiety and stress and I found so many therapists and counselors that are constantly coming up with methods to help people deal with anxiety the three three three method and then the five five five method and the 10 10 10 method so it's to breathe in for 3 seconds hold it for 3 seconds and breathe out for 3 seconds then someone else said breathe in for 5 seconds hold it for 5 seconds but I've got a remedy tonight amen it's not the three five or 10 it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen being Christians we know that we're not exempt from anxiety and trouble notice again Jesus in Matthew 10:18 says and you shall be brought before Governors and Kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the Gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought again same word anxious anxiety take no thought how or what you shall speak now I want you to notice that Jesus is saying these things and it would be the exact opposite of what our human human tendency would be so if we knew we were going to be brought before a tribunal a governor a police officer a judge and we're going to be questioned about what we believe the church we go to what we stand for why why do you women dress the way you do why do you men do the way you do and there could be some kind of consequences for us doing this then the natural thing would be for us to become very anxious would it not kind of troubled about it and okay what what will I say and how will I go about saying it now you see what Jesus is trying to set us straightforward that we would not rely on our own ability and we would not become anxious which would go in on our nerves and then we would come to a spot to where we would try to talk our way out of this situation but he said don't become anxious if you before the judges don't think about what you'll even think or speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak so what would premeditated thoughts do no doubt make a mess and it might even make a coward out of us because we might think of a way to compromise and get out of it so look at what Jesus wants to replace anxiety with arama word from God so it will be given you in that hour what you shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you now look at what we trade what we trade for the spirit of God leading us and speaking out of us we get anxiety or we can go the the other way and trade our anxiety back send it back down to Hell where it come from and let our father give us the right words to say which do we want notice again in Luke 10:41 and Jesus answered and said unto her you're familiar with the scripture I know Martha Martha Thou Art careful exact same word anxious or anxiety never remember Martha got upset at Mary cuz Martha was fixing Jesus food and drink and all of that hey that would be an important thing would it not sisters if Jesus was at your house and you'd want to feed him and you'd want to take care of him but yet her sister was constantly wanting to sit at the feet of Jesus and be able to eat of the Mana so Jesus has to turn and he doesn't actually rebuke Mary but he actually speaks to Martha and Jesus answered and said her Martha Mara Thou Art careful or anxious and troubled about many things but well I guess I don't understand why that we as Believers add to this scripture and we add this one word million one million and ain't that the way life is oh I got to do this and we got to go there and we got to do this and we got to go that that's contrary to the words of the Lord Jesus when it's all said and done when it comes right down to Deaths and it comes down to the reality of God according to what the Lord Jesus said there's one thing needful all the rest of it all you say oh I can't do it without I can't do without it but if you're put in the hospital tomorrow and you're in a coma could you do without it so if you were in a car ready and you were laid up and you broke every bone in your body oh I've got this great appointment I've got to do this I've got to do that I've got to do that can it be put on hold it can be so notice how Jesus now sets it in order but one thing is needful Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her now Mar say it may make you upset but I will not take this from Mary now believe it or not most of us have both a Martha and a Mary in our own makeup so we have things that we can be so upset and so troubled about and we will let the Needful Things Go aren't you glad though the Lord Jesus is merciful notice in Philippians CH 4: 6 same word be careful for nothing now Paul is not telling us to live a halfhazard life and PA don't even worry about them I you know drive down the road 90 M an hour around a 5505 m m hour curve and don't worry about this just drive Reckless don't don't be careful about nothing he's not saying not to be careful but he's talking about anxiety and being anxious as I begin to study these scriptures the other day as the Lord begin to put together for me each scripture that I read I begin to ask for more help Lord help me y'all already asking Lord help me Lord help me why because it's our human makeup it's our human nature for many of us to become so anxious and to become so worried and so Laden down and we allow the devil to Rob us of the blessings of God be careful or anxious for nothing but in every Thing by prayer in supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God now the same Greek word there which means exactly what I told you that is to be anxious notice again Peter says in 1 Peter 5: 7 casting all your care upon him for he carth for you now you know what I found amazing was the same word so the reason we don't have to be anxious is because Jesus is for us so why should most of us do it I mean it's not human anxiety of course but Peter chose to use a word that you'd think it wouldn't even match his Heavenly Body it wouldn't even match his his glorified state but to draw from it that would be able to pour out to us how concern the Lord Jesus is about what we go through in life casting all your care upon him because for he carth for you now watch the prophet as he was here and he was dealing of course with many many people and their troubles and he said the uncertainty of the security of the nation not only this nation but all nations because little Nations can just got the same weapons that the big Nations has got we can certainly say Amen to that in this day can't we the security is certainly uncertain and we don't know just what there's unrest among the people now if it was that way in 1961 can you imagine what it is now traveling around from Nation to Nation I find that everyone seems to be nervous and the psychic Wards are filling up and the people down the street there seems to be so much anxiety and they rush just as hard as they can till they don't have courtesy even one for the other and I noticed it amongst all people they go down the road at night and the man will diem his life and the next man won't dim his lights just go on and pay no attention to it let him go let him go and blind him as necessary that's Pentecostal cursing now I w't ask how many of you tonight are Pentecostal cursors so when you meet somebody and they've got their lights on bright and you reach over and flip yours on bright that'll show you buddy you just cussed uh oh guilt is a hound dog in the hen house I didn't see it right now now watch our brother Brandon would pick this up no I know this is not deep it's not a great tremendous great Revelation I'll tell you why we can't get no deeper because we think things like this don't matter amen let him go blind him as necessary that's Pentecostal cursing you see let him alone oh he says we shouldn't have done that no matter what the other fell does let's show what we're made of let's get something down in here to show love and respect and respect the next man and love him whether he's right come on now friends we're separating bride from Brites I hate to be the bear of bad news but we've got a lot of folks around this message they're just simply brandit that's all they are they will not go in the Rapture they'll go straight to the tribulation period you think this flood is something I told Carol yesterday we talking about I said you know people look around I'm I'm just marvel at the kindness and the generosity of people and what all people are doing but I told her said can you imagine in the tribulation period it'll not be the way it is right now in this flood time and disaster relief it'll be every man every woman every boy and every girl fending for themsel because they will be starving they will be looking the Bible says they will cry they will seek for peace and safety they will cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them it will be as it was when the Lord Jesus told oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have gathered thee together if thou would have only known the time of thy visitation and Jesus said there will not be one stone left upon the other and we know of course whenever Josephus wrote about what went on that the people would wait in the streets and the people of Jerusalem would die and they would fight over who got their body to eat it they ate the bark off the trees they ate grass they ate bugs they ate ropes they ate animal skins and hides it was every man for himself you imagine whenever the blood of the Lord Jesus Takes the bride there will be no genuine love left on the face of the Earth people will kill one another for food they will absolutely turn into hell oh Lord Jesus let us miss it father notice there'll be no love there'll be no respect notice he said if you just love those who love you the Sinners do the same thing but we're different when Christ has come into our heart we love those who don't love us love the unlovable can Word of Life say Amen to this quote tonight love the unlovable and we were unlovable one time too and we were unlovable one time too and you know Christ loved us until we came to him then if we be of Christ and Christ is in us we have the same Spirit of fellowship and cooperation and helping to try to move the great load and make life a little easier for our fellow men and the church said oh I know this is not a convention quote it's more of a Wednesday night quote but it's a pretty good quote anyway isn't it we want to make life a little bit better for people and not just for those of course that we love but for those that are absolutely unlovable now because the age is so anxious and we know that the pre-tribulation period is already among the people now and we can see the nations of the world have turned against Israel over and over again more human resolutions uh uh have been passed against Israel than all the rest of the nations of the world put together and they seem to be looking for another excuse by which they can penalize Israel and now of course our president and blinking are telling Israel if they don't do this and this and this that they are facing an arms embargo and remember Israel and their Iron Dome and their David slang and all of that they may have helped invent that but they cannot afford to buy every one of those missiles to be able to shoot them down because they average from 30,000 some of them up to $200,000 a piece so whenever they're sending two and 300 missiles at a time then you count 50,000 100,000 150,000 easy in a few days you can wind up spending millions of dollars so what does our great nation do they put them under pressure you do what we tell you or we will not send you missiles to defend yourself now remember being a friend with America comes with a great price because America will give you money as long as you do what America say you know the sad part about it is we got folks in church that do the same thing oh I'm the greatest Pastor they ever seen in their life until I do something they don't approve of and then boy they get mad in the Hornet and they claim to be filled of the Holy Ghost well I'll tell you one thing I'm glad my Holy Ghost helps me to love those that differs with me come on somebody but America that's part of being her friend you do what we say do and then we'll reward you yeah that's the way they are so then it puts Netanyahu it puts the liud party it puts shenet it puts the mad it puts all of these things in Israel under a great deal of pressure and even though they're looking at it and they think this is the best thing for us to do but our government says no we don't want you to do that and we can see the same way in our own life this person tells you to do this this one tells you to do that you get you know influenced by your job you get influenced by people on social media as I was reading this week that even some of the Hollywood leftists that is left as they can be that they have started limiting their children's time on the internet and their children's time on social media because they've been having to take some of their children to get therapy because of so many hours that they're spending in social media and especially young girls because they see the images and the body shapes and forms and they look at theel and they don't find themselves as pretty unattractive as them images that are put on there and they they go through all kinds of this thing suicide rates have went up why it's not bringing them peace it's causing more anxiety so they they're constantly bombarded is anybody going to say Amen with me tonight it is more anxiet Y and more anxiety every day that we live in and what does it cause and that anxiety runs in on our nerves which God gave us of course what would we be without nerves but Satan knows how to multiply that to create or cause a nervous tension watch this he said we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension everybody racing here going there going nowhere and it's just that kind of an age and I know this church of be plagued with it as everywhere is plagued with it he said the Tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere you mean to tell me the church our brother brandom was plagued with nervous tension oh my you understand setting in brother brandom's church was people that had been married three and four times do you understand there was people sting in brother bram's church that had all kinds of trouble all types of anxieties so for those of you that are looking for a perfect church that has nobody in it that's been remarried nobody in it that has problems and issues I hate to be the bad bad bad news tonight but you ain't going to find one cuz there is no such a thing the Ephesian church is not perfect the church at Corinth was not perfect the church at galatia was not perfect but what you need to do is find the church where God has ordained you to be there get behind it with all your might and your strength and if you got a man God that's telling you the truth get behind him and pray for him and instead of trying to add his trouble pray for him that God will lead him praise the Lord love your brothers and sisters do what you can to help one another but notice brother brandom identifies it now he's preaching another one of the local churches are in Jeffersonville so he was referring to that church and also his church the Tabernacle is played with it everywhere the whole world it's a day of pressure h hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait oh my hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90 oh my goodness 90 miles an hour and then get home for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready that's right it's the time in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wife say something a little contrary and you want to fly off temper husband say something and you'll patch your foot and tell him to get in the room see well now husband I don't want no words with you you get out there wife I'm so nervous see why what's the matter all this together this tension building up then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place that's right so it builds up and then you do something wrong and then you act out of your place that's right now it'll make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class we're hearing a lot about the middle class we always do in the election year so let let bring in the middle class from another perspective shall we the middle class will act that way it'll make the rich act that way so you got the lower class the middle class and the upper class sound lot to me it covered everybody on the earth don't you so the all like that what if you speak to the kitty come in your mama oh there you are it builds up oh my you feel like you're notice you feel like you're going to your heads going to come off I know I'm with it every day so I know what it means you mean Elijah that with that kind of pressure every day no days off Church age book each age had it it pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches self living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in you understand the majority of people on the face of the Earth today are fitted for this age you're not you're they are fitted to live in drunkenness and blindness in Le DEA it don't make them sick they're all looking for a great time they figure if they can flip the hide house and get Trump in there boy the whole thing's going to turn upside down I agree it's going to turn up upside down it don't matter no difference who gets in there this nation is done my hope is not on November the 5th my hope is in the coming of the Lord Jesus now watch this there's a difference between being nervous and a demon of nervousness anointing you now remember God made us with nerves emotions and feelings un let everybody be attentive and be careful but when a demon of nervousness will start moving on an individual it's it's more than they normally would feel it's similar but beyond what they normally deal with in their nervousness now watch this 5 years ago when I was here I saw you now listen to this this is a discernment and in the vision the prophet recalls seeing this this individual five years before when he was in Jonesboro Arkansas I saw you you went through a line or something you was healed then between you and I comes a dark shadow it's shaking and jumping there's only one thing that can mean that's a demon a demon of nervousness so it's everybody then that would have bouts of nerves is that a demon not necessarily but can you imagine then for all of this nervous age that if we would allow a demon of nervousness to jump on us and we're already nervous anyway then here would come this jerking shaking demon is that right now notice what this Demon Done to this individual it's a woman you think sometimes you've lost your mind isn't that right but he's a liar now want you notice how he separates this he does not call this this Christian woman a liar Hallelujah he does not call this woman a liar but he addresses what is anointing her thinking and you'll never find him ever referring to a demon as a her so he wants this woman to see where this is is coming from now he said he's a liar you're not you're just the same as anybody else but he's trying to get you down lady Oh Glory to God don't you pay no attention to that now I want you to watch him now as he challenges this demon thou devil in the name of Jesus Christ you're exposed come out of the woman Leave Her Go rejoicing sister you're free now may the Lord bless thee Oh Glory to God thank you Lord Jesus come here sister what's the matter you're you're you're all nervous mental nervousness you just feel like you can't get to yourself you want a place to put your foot this is right now at the cross I can make it leave you but it'll come back it's it's causing this presence now he couldn't stay here if you had to but it'll come back but if the good man of the House's face isn't there you've wanted a place to start you see friends this is what happens to people sometimes they come and get prayed for and God will do something for them and they may feel better for an hour two maybe a day maybe a week and that thing will try to come back you understand what happens when the men of God that are called and ordained of God to pray for you and if they've been given delegated authority by the Lord Jesus and to make that devil leave then that devil when you're away from that man of God and you're feeling weak and you don't feel the anointing you don't feel the presence of the Lord that's when he will try to come back oh brother Donnie's out of town oh my goodness brother Daryl Arizona oh my where's brother John where's brother Joe where's brother Pete where's all the brothers that oh no oh no but but remember if you've got the good man of faith in your soul if I'm a thousand miles away the good man of faith is resident in your soul now that's keep this in mind that's when the devil will try to attack you and many times it'll be when you're by yourself oh my what this now you've wanted a place to start now start from here Lord in the name of Jesus Christ now watch this Shadow Of Darkness like a Mist hanging at the woman in the name of Jesus Christ demon of nervousness leave the woman now go and rejoice look be happy just rejoice and thank God it'll stay away from you just believe it now you imagine a man that was called by God to break into that type of Realm and whenever he would see this this sphere of demons some of them would look like bats and have long hair hanging down off an epilepsy devil would look like a tortoise shell now I'm quoting to your quote why why would they take on such form I don't have a clue I'm just glad God gave us a window to the supernatural in the end time to be able to unveil that devil do you believe the same Lord Jesus is here tonight to set you free from nervousness if you've got it listen to me friends as I'm reading these quotes to you if your faith can rise to that level you can be free as I read it several years ago I had an Affliction in my body and always really really Troublesome and really been bothered me I was listening to a tap and I was down the basement building something and and while I was listening to the discernment there and the presence of God came in that little room where I was and I thought wow it's strange I mean it was a really good tape I've already been blessed but it was just something that just like could swep in you know what I'm talking about you felt it before yourself and brother Brandon it was before that he did it as serman and he called someone out and told them exactly the same thing that I was experiencing and what I found was something like leaped within me and that thing left my body right there now you see we want the message of the hour to be not just something that was recorded back 1955 and 1965 and 1958 I believe that same thing if we will receive it in the right way it can happen to you right here tonight watch this let's go now to oppression Judges 6: 7 and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you look at what the word oppressed means to squeeze to squeeze and press I get in your mind is you would take a lemon a lime or an orange or something that you're trying to get the juice out of it and you squeeze and if you do what Carol does when she gets limes which are harder she'll roll it on the counter or if I'm there she'll have me to do it if I'm not there she'll take a hammer take it on the back porch and soften the outside of it and then roll it because you get more juice out of it so this is the word that the auar of Judges used this is what they were doing to you in Egypt you understand demons out of hell are trying to squeeze the very life out of us oh my look this way sister something's wrong with you yeah you also have bad eyes too and you're a nervous case aren't you you have a real demon depression isn't that right oppression just bothers you all the time nervousness isn't that right God bless you if I'll tell you that you're healed will you believe me all right go home you're healed Hallelujah you understand understand if the Lord Jesus was here tonight preaching this service he could do no more for you than what he's already done he would just try to get your faith to a level to where you could believe it notice again I want to say there's so many people passing through here that suffering with mental oppression demon manifestation now look children I'm not here tonight to scare you I'm not here tonight to try to open up a realm Beyond where we should walk but I want to let you know what this is that you're feeling and I want to let you know it's not you it's your en but he wants to make you think it's you you're weird you're strange you're crazy you cross the line there's no hope for you you'll never get back he is a liar but he tries to make you believe his lies by symptoms lying vanities but I'm here tonight to tell you there is a way out hallelujah hallelujah freedom from anxiety freedom from nervousness freedom from oppression Freedom From Fear freedom from depression I don't think you have to wait till Sunday I think you can lay it right here tonight and walk out free by the presence of God demon manifestation Satan I seen a vision breaking before me of a young lady she went back there and sat down a few minutes ago that thinks she's crossed the separating line don't let Satan tell you that as long as you love God God still loves you anybody believe that tonight as long as you still love God God loves you and I'm going to tell you one thing Word of Life Church if almighty God offers Mercy to people that you and I think is beyond Mercy who are we to say they can't have Grace I want somebody to stand here tonight and tell me how we have got a right to say this person's this and this person is that you don't know that if almighty God can give people Mercy who am I to say they can't have have it I hope and pray some of the message folks never get to a place they need a lot of Grace cuz they're going to be hurting when they do need it oh my for the same judgment that you meet out shall be Meed to you again my goodness you have a real dark look around you and I don't mind telling you I'm glad I'm not made to see all this okay I've been able to see some of it before I've never asked for it and I'll be perfectly fine the rest of my life if I never see it again but I've dealt with them enough to sense when they're around and they're here tonight and they are getting some kind of scared too I love it when the Holy Ghost makes nervous demons nervous but don't the Holy Ghost shouldn't make you nervous you ought to be calm tonight cuz the Lord's fixing to do something Hallelujah you have a real dark look around you cause you're suffering from some kind of Oppression demon bothering you now friends if we tonight God would open our eyes into another realm and let us see what would be here tonight it would probably scare us to death some of us it would haunt our dreams we probably would would take weeks if not longer to get over it what is right here present can you imagine those demons the prophet said they would follow his meetings so say he was in Colombia South Carolina and evil spirit was forced to leave people and he would go from there say to Charlotte or wherever more and then demons would go to the next meeting why because them demons knew there would be people there that didn't believe they would ridicule that prophet of God they would make fun of him a church is a perfect place to get demon possessed that's why brother benam would tell people to Bow their heads and be reverent respectful right why you making a demon go out they ain't looking for a dog ain't looking for a cat or looking for a human being to go into so the gend to somebody that's got a bad mood they got a bad Spirit they've developed a critical spirit you know they're just mou they hate this and they hate that that's a very good home Prophet called it a church home for for a demon well praise the Lord everybody oh my now think I want you to be aware that every day of your life these things are around you taunting you tormenting you whispering to you but you don't have to put up of the devil's garbage now what you have a real dark look around you CA you're suffering from some kind of Oppression demon bothering you is that true you're haunted it's like something haunting at you all the time it' run you wild if it could now what's amazing aming is this person isn't a Christian now watch brother Brenham goes down there in this in this quote and he said now will you at this time accept him as your personal savior ain't that amazing that an individual could have this kind of Faith operate the gift of God and wasn't even saved will you at this time accept him as your personal savior before this group of people and promised by God's help from this night on you'll live for him the best of your knowledge and the rest of your days if you will by God's help I'll make the evil thing leave you and never return again praise be to God now you talking about a time when you got a voice of a prophet of God and that devil on that person can you imagine now it's nervous time for demons oh Lord I love just for a bit to been able to look into that room into that real whether than you imagine when they got back down in Hell together and they was arguing back and forth why did you holler why did you holler at me I was standing up there under in the platform and you you cowed you you was sitting Plum back there in the church he didn't even know that I was there but as soon as you said help me help me you coward why did you do that and there was a black streak that formed between you on the platform and me I was headd back there on the back pew and all of a sudden them prophetic eyes followed that black streak and it unveiled both of us so we got two with one discernment hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'll tell you one thing if we could have a testimony meeting tonight from the Devils down in hell you wouldn't hear them say what the believe the sign people say they would not make a YouTube video and said I'll tell you one thing that man's a false prophet he's a liar he's this and that if they could tell the truth they say it's one of the scaredest times I ever had in my life it was like that man could look right down in The Souls of human beings he saw my claws he saw my feathers hanging off of me he saw this and that and the other well come on somebody aren't you glad our God now look there is no prophet in this building tonight to be able to discern your heart but the very word of God that I'm preaching is a discerner and he can go right down to the deepest recesses of your soul and declare to the Lord Jesus what you have need of in this [Applause] service you're B bothered with nervousness any how that's your trouble you believe he'll take it from you it's your age and this time there's probably only one remedy for you and that's Christ it's a horrible thing it's the worst feeling anyone could have nervousness there's nothing like feeling that that distress you see but Jesus Christ can make you well so you mean nervousness it's actually like an Affliction a sickness if you're nervous here tonight Beyond human nervousness I'm talking about do you understand it's no more than a demon spirit that would try to anoint you like a person with cancer or a person with a gross or a malignant tomb it's a demon he haunts your mind he keeps you out of church he tries to keep you away from The Fellowship of the saints of God to torment you to get you off by yourself and every friend you lose and every friend that you cut off you get weaker and weaker and weaker what you want to do weaken you down till you get to a place you can't take it no more and you ain't got confidence in nobody and you ain't got respect for no preachers and you don't need nobody no more you understand what you're doing you're getting yourself off in a corner and then the horde of demons are going to make their attack and you'll not be able to withstand it dear God it's oppression demon oppression like a dark shadow ble hangs and it always causing you to be that way but he will heal you if you can believe will you believe now I'm asking you he can deliver you this very night of your nervousness will you believe friends are as real as you're real I see them many times when they leave I've seen them leave right here at this platform I've seen some of them in the shape of bats look like long hairs hanging on their legs but an epileptic demon look like a tortoise with round legs hanging up but use said demon of Oppression seems more like of a cloud form like a wave a cloud form but like a wave for the first time since the fall of Adam and the Garden of Eden we get a view into the way they appear the form the shape that they take their traits their sounds even the words they say can't you hear them he said they're saying keep them from believing keep them from believing you imagine in that realm in that fourth dimension where they communicate he could hear them de demons and they were gathering in the service he said the demons are here and the angels of God are here unbelief is accumulating and faith is accumulating which way will the battle go he says depends on which way you believe so the demons were saying keep them from believing keep them from believing so evil spirits right there in church keep them from believing occupy your mind with this occupy your mind that over the Don

Jesus Christ I command every nervous demon to go away from these people Satan I call your bluff tonight and say you are a liar you are trespassing on our inheritance God wants peace to be the umow of our hearts not nervousness and shaking and quivering scared to go here scared to go there you are defeated you demon of Oppression I don't have to see you tonight I don't have to have prophetic eyes to be able to look and see we're declared by the word that you're here to fight us but guess what we're here to fight you back oppression in the name of Jesus take your hand off of these people if there's any suicide that's left hanging around you might as well go with them hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord God father right now as your children we believe the promise of your word now children lay your hands on one another Brothers fits and sisters standing by you you don't feel comfortable by you laying your hand on her just move around and grab a hold of her brother just we just want to pray for one another now hallelujah hallelujah friends you believe I was led of the spirit of God you trust me as your pastor I got an email today before I come to church from someone in South Africa the streams are service and they were so tore up and so tore to pieces because a preacher there in South Africa had been preaching around to the people that the Millennium was going to start tomorrow you ought to thank God for the men of God that come to our church to preach us the truth instead of a bunch of garbage you imagine brother Steve facing what you're facing in your life and you're sitting under some kind of trash and garbage that preachers say God told him to preach let's believe together Hallelujah Heavenly Father we have our hands laid one upon the other Earthly Brothers touching Earthly sisters husbands and wives siblings mothers and fathers touching their children deacons reaching out of their place and touching others musicians singers Lord God we need you tonight Jesus Lord God I believe father that your word is the power that will cause demons to leave and the presence of the Holy Ghost is here right now so father we within ourself would never come against such an army as hell how could we come against beings that stood before your throne that were one time holy created angels how in the world could I ever stand against such I would be an idiot to do so but father with you living in us we are more than a match for the devil tonight I believe you have got men of God on the earth tonight they are called hallelujah oh thank you Lord to cast out Devils out of your children father then the prophet would have us to lay our hands over on one another Eagle to Eagle believer to believer then Lord we believe that that can also Minister strength to one another maybe just another little bit of faith that would help them Lord to believe for whatever it is they have need of oh God I pray right now in the name of Jesus would you heal the sick would you deliver those that are bound father maybe some father God under that oppression of the devil may they be set free tonight father maybe some of these discernments described exactly the way they feel and we have no problem in believing that because even though those people that those Spirits were on then have been dead for many many years yet Spirits do not die so we can see the same traits on people decades thereafter but that also means the Holy Ghost has not die so the same holy ghost that made them demons leave in 195 8 and 1965 can make them leave right here tonight so we're calling on you tonight Lord Jesus bring healing to our troubled hearts father I pray Lord God in Jesus name make them free from oppression set them free from Suicidal Thoughts set them free oh God from nervousness may they walk out of this building tonight oh God in the name of Jesus Christ free from the power of the enemy and if that devil tries to come back may that good man of faith in their heart take these scriptures help them to pin them down and when the enemy comes against them may they just quote it like a Gatling gun and aim for that devil straight to the heart granted I pray tonight father in the name of Jesus Hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight father can we rejoice in the presence of our God hallelujah hallelujah those of you that need Deliverance tonight as a servant of God I speak to you in the name of the Lord Jesus believe it and you'll be well from this night forward hallelujah hallelujah Halle hallelujah thank you Lord God I
