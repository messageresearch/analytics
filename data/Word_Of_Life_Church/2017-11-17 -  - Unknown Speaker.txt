know I was listening to brother Chuck song and he was singing and I got to thinking about way back in December the 21st 1981 there's on a Sunday afternoon around two o'clock in an old antique store in Jonesboro Tennessee I was listening to those words and I just got to remembering that day they're not before and then I look late doing things I shouldn't be doing that Sunday afternoon I was there by myself and the spirit of Lord came upon me I knew it was him because I felt him when I was a boy the Lord spoke to me that afternoon it wasn't an audible voice but it was just as real as my voice said if you go out that door I'll never call you again there I knelt on the floor that Oh antique store by myself hadn't been to church in years that gave my heart to the Lord Jesus but I told the Lord that I would go wherever he would leave me that I've tried to keep that promise I used to come in from meetings sometimes I'd be tired and get weary I used to drive down by that old store pull into the parking lot and sit because that was where I was born and I would set I remember that day and a few year ago I got busy it's been a while I thought I think I'll go by the old birthplace that drove down there and it was gone big supermarket was there with a big old paved parking lot and I don't mind to tell you hurt my feelings just a little bit but then I thought that's right they can tear down the building they can pave the parking lot but they can never take that experience out of my heart the day that the Lord Jesus saved me [Applause] [Music] do you remember that day that he done that for you we could spend all night and just take turns and telling and they were singing about that the touch and I was just thinking of when I was in New Mexico and my back had went out old me I tell you when you hurt that bad there's only one place you want to be that's at home but I was so far from home I thought how can I even get home I can't even get on an airplane and I went to that meet the sister Cindy hunting brother David was in that meeting it was all I could do to get to the pulpit I was hurting so every step was paid to shooting down my legs and this hip was like four inches higher than my other one it was just waked up like this in the air and I went to that pulpit and I turned around and brother Chuck made me think about it when he's talking about I felt his hand and that's the way it was I was standing there and I thought the song leader had come up and put his hand on my back because my mic wasn't on or something and so I just felt this hand touched me on the back and I turned to see who it was there was nobody there and I thought that's strange then all there was she was just like Warhol God it was just like warm water I just run down the legs and the pain was gone [Music] what a mighty God we serve tonight do you love him amen if you have your Bible sir with us to the Book of Luke we want to read from Luke chapter 1 and you know I've just kind of put some things together thank you brother I put some things together that we've been looking at for the last few months and so maybe some of this you're going to hear you've heard it before and I trust it won't bother you to hear it again but we just want to put some of these things together and and bring a few thoughts out of it and we trust it to be a blessing to you but we want to read from Luke chapter 1 verse 30 and this is like I said just a kind of a compliation of some of the things we've been looking at in the last few months on the field Luke chapter 1 verse 30 and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God a man we can say amen to that the house found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end that's the kingdom I want to belong to then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and we know what that is can you say Amanda there the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be boarded thee shall be called the Son of God and behold our cousin Elizabeth Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the six month with her who is called barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word not the emotion not sensation not feelings not goosebumps but according to thy word heavens and earth shall pass away yet the world of God shall never failed amen be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her amen you know why the angel left because she received his message and he accomplished what he was sent to do Thank You Laura let's bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on it was me it was me Heavenly Father thank you lord thank you for that old building down to Jonesboro thank you Lord for this place here on the hillside and I came here when I was a little boy and my feet wouldn't touch the floor there are the old Happy Valley Lord I remember the day the message came and broke father on Sunday morning to the congregation that we thank you for these wonderful memories of your presence that has been with us and Lord I'm so glad that we don't just have memories but we believe right now today you're doing the same thing you've always done and we believe Lord if there isn't tomorrow you will continue for you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord bless the children tonight father thank you for the wonderful testimonies of the healers that continue to come in father's for Lord we believe this is the hour of the manifestation of the sons of God Lord we believe they'll be more and more in our faith we'll race higher and higher until our very bodies will change Lord father we were looking for that rapture we believe in lanes just ahead bless your children do not father Lord may you just come as we surrender ourselves to you and speak to the hearts of your people that Lord will be careful to give you the praise and the honor and the glory blessed brother Donny Lord breast brother David denied different ones Lord preached and different places father just bless them father and be with them we pray but we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says Amen god bless you you make me sheet it now I found this quote and I thought it was interesting the way brother Branham said this he said now when Israel began to cry for their deliverance and God began to hear and when they began to cry then God begin to hear and he provided a way of escape he sent Moses to them now Moses came as a direct result of their crying for deliverance they cried for deliverance God heard them and he sent Moses because they cried for deliverance and he said this is the point I want you to understand he said how strange it was that after crying for deliverance and when deliverance was brought to them they failed to recognize it and refused it and had to suffer 40 years more so we see the consequences of failing to recognize your hour your day and the word for your day because they failed to recognize the direct result of their crying for deliverance God answered the cry and the deliverer but they failed to recognize it and 40 more years it was 40 more years before they realized the delivers that they had salt had been with them the hotel so here's what I tried to get you to see is that there is the consequences of failing to recognize what God is doing for you then if that's true if we fail to recognize that God's doing something for us and we fail to recognize it and that would be a consequences then what would it be if God was to do something for us and we wants to recognize it's me do you see what I'm saying tonight because you see I want you to understand that no matter how great the revelation is about how rich the anointing would be no matter how great the gift would be that God would send to you if you don't recognize that it's for you it will do you no good for God had sent this to Israel and yet they failed to recognize it so they got no benefits all they got was 40 more years so about how rich the anointing is know how great the promise is for the hour in which were living in and the anointing that's released by the opening of the word to pour out the blessings of God if we don't recognize it if we don't realize it it's me the word is speaking to me it'll do us no good you see we're living in the days when identification is required it's required it's not well I don't have any but that'll be okay no we're living in the day if you don't have the identification you ain't getting no no airplane so we're living in an hour you must help identification I remember a few year ago out in Arizona and I was standing over two priests and the girls that been out there with me and they were flying back on Saturday and so I was going to preach for brother on Peterson on Sunday and fly home on Monday and so I took sterling the girls to the airport and I just that we was using their passports for our IDs it's one of the best studies you can have it so we had took our passports with us and so we were running a little bit late because I've got girls I told the brother one time I was preaching at our cuz I said Moses got two million people out of Egypt I can't get three women have a hotel Ruby so anyway we was running late I saw just y'all pray for me huh I'll hear about that but anyway we grabbed the passport so when we got to the airport guess what I had searles I had Allison's and I had mine know Jessica's and so we was trying to go through her person trying to go through Searles first to try to find some identification so that Jessica can say it's me this ticket belongs to me it's my ticket here's the proof this is Who I am so then we see then that we're living in an hour of identification but not only is that in the natural but it's in the spiritual we must have a scriptural spiritual identification now if we are the bride of Jesus Christ and here's the word that his bride must also be the word then the only true identification that we can ever have it would have to be a word based identification but there's the word body there must be a word frame for that body of cinema so then we understand our true identification it's not our birth parent our true identification it's not our genetics that we can trace back to a natural lineage but our true identification of who we really are there's only one place you'll ever find that that's in the Word of God so that we can look into the Word of God and find out most assuredly who we are that we can look into the word and say it's me you see the Prophet preached the message perfect faith and he said in the message perfect faith he said now faith is based on forgiveness before you can ever have faith in the word you must first believe that the word is for you you see your individual revival is when you realize or you recognize the word is speaking to you now let me say that again your personal revival it's when you come to the understanding that what you're reading and the word it's not just talking about brother Donnie it's not just talking about brother Branham it's not just talking about brother Bisco it's talking about you that will stir something in your heart when you realize it's me a man you see because why it's Christ in His Church reconciling the people to God he may had he promised he would do it it's written and he's the same yesterday today and forever he said do you believe that in the congregation says a man Abram said I believe it with all my heart he's just waiting now listen to this quote he's just waiting now to be called on the scene the only thing that can call him on the scene the only thing that can call him on the scene is for us to awaken him in ourselves to awaken the Christ that's in you that's the only way I can call him on the scene is to awaken the word that's in me that's a quote that's what the Prophet says the only way not a fast room not a vast sound nada congregationally though those things are fine they're needful they've got their place but it goes back to the word everything must go back to the foundation of the world it's for us to awaken him could it be that he's sleeping in me I've let him go to sleep because of that my problems get bigger than my Christ I've left my store and get bigger than my boat come on somebody we must awaken him in ourselves to call him on the scene now remember you know you've heard this before you've heard many people preach it but brother better talked about the Welsh revival and I'll a bunch of men went to the United States to go over to see that revival and they were walking around they didn't know where it was at and they saw the policeman now why did they go to that policeman I want you to notice they did not go to him because he was a policeman though you think it would be if they wanted directions they would go to a policeman but they didn't go to him because he was a policeman they went to him because he was whistling at him big difference they whipped him because they heard him whistling Amazing Grace or down at the cross or an old gospel hymn and they go up to him and said sir we came all the way from America we're so excited to see this revival can you tell us sir where is this revival being hilt he never said go two blocks to the gas station make a ride you turn left at that corner you'll find the librarians behind it he never said plug this into your Google Maps he never gave him an address but you know what he said he took his billy stick and he packed it on his chest and he said you're looking at it he want to find the Welsh revival you're ever I'm it's me I else remember if we can only understand if we can only grab that in the reality that the Prophet gave it to us that we we are the reflection of Jesus Christ we are the reflection of Jesus Christ His Word made manifest you are the reflection of his word where is the West revival sir what building is it in it's me it's me sir it's in the heart he was the river and today the church optimi Jesus Christ in action not just a bunch of closers not just a bunch of quoters smaller than a pitcher more than a belt buckle more than a Malakai for license plate though there's nothing wrong with that but more than just doctor turn to Jesus class today not just a bunch of colors but the living word living in the people you see God don't need my ability doc don't need my education Oh God needs is my skin hallelujah God wants me to die to myself that he can connotes if he himself did to me how God was important to Christ but they don't stop there how Christ was important to his church then we should be the manifestation of the life of Jesus Christ in action today not Sunday today what do you say brother Daryl this the branch writing another book of Acts that's what we ought to be because he said if that vine ever puts forth another branch they will write another book of Acts behind and he said that would be in the hour with Hosea saying the immorality of the women and seven women would grab a hold of every man's coat down below there will be the branch of the Lord and God said it will be beautiful this day yes our hallelujah by revelation we stand tonight not my arrogance but in the humility of the Spirit in the decency of holiness we say it's me he was so full of the Welsh revival he was the richest level and we ought to be so full of Christ to reflect him in the power of his word that's allotted for us this day man worried about the soup stairs don't worry about all the Facebook don't worry about all that stuff that always wouldn't be there that opposition was that when he was here and it'll be here when we're here amen they think they want us gone they think we're the problem with America but I promise you when we leave there would to God we was back you just remember that you just remember that the only thing holding this nation together right now it ain't the Democrats or the Republicans but working for the same guy come on somebody the only thing holding this nation together right now is you you can stand there and say it's me ichy aye sir that's why this nation is still clothing because God's still using us to get the word out but when that last seat comes yet God will close the book a man and we'll take our journey where the God about to get excited man we're supposed to be the light of this age you believe that the Bible said he'd even the time there shall be light who is it it's me so you arrogant no I'm not hurting I'm not being arrogant I'm not even saying that a girly God knows I'm not but I've said it by revelation I'm saying it by faith if Wesley was the light of his day and Luther was a lot of his day and Pentecost with the restoration against what's the line of their day whose light is it now remember said word the further up the road now we're coming into the bride the called out the elected the bride the call out elected to remember if you are you're just like that officer if you're the bride if you're the called out if you are the elect if you are if that's who you are then you're just like that officer you can say it's in me where's the bride's revival you're looking at you see the bride's revival is the opening of the word and the opening of the word when that seals are loose and the word comes open the prophet of God said the full Word of God was born into manifestation then that makes it exactly like it was with Jesus was on the earth he was the fullness of the word and then the bride hallelujah is expressing the fullness of his words pain making him the same right now for somebody come through the back door they're not dragging across with the white road people would scream but that's not Jesus he never said he would come like that he's already done that you said you want to see me you must see me in my bride that's where I'll be man the open of the word it stirs her not only you see who brother Branham is we see who we are we see our position we see our our we see that I'm not just part of the move I am the move she is the move come over me you see she catches the revelation and see the class it's me [Music] so she said whose scarlet threads out hanging in the window Rahab said it's me you see the senator changes it's God dealing with the church this is the last stage can you say amen to that then whatever God's gonna do he must do now when the church age ends it's the fullness of the Gentiles dispensation when the truck changes are over he will never call another Gentile those who are filthy will be filthy still those who are righteous will be righteous still we're not the consummation of the church changes then if God's gonna do something in this hour he must do it with us little brother doe my son he's the Church of tomorrow no I beg your pardon he is not the Church of the morrow these young boys sitting right here on the Pew they are not the Church of tomorrow will they maybe if there is no tomorrow but throw the Church of right now we have no promise of tomorrow this is our our this is our time we see the thing of it is so so many people are lacking we can be such legal eagles and I do know there's a standard of holiness do not misunderstand me and it's a shame we've let it slip there's a standard of decent dressing in standard of the way men should dress and apt and we've let it slip but that's another message for another time but you see the key of it is the key it is it's not to live this message by ruler but the key of it is is just fall in love with Jesus [Applause] not just see how much with the cano though we should study not just see how much we can quote though we should be able to quote it but the key of it is is how much can we love you see if you love right everything else will fall into place because love produces confidence and confidence produces trust the Bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God when you trust in what the word is saying to you Oh God when you've got confidence that the word is speaking to you and what it's saying to you is true you see where there's a lack of desire to forgive you find there's a lack of love people do things that say things to one another and they have no remorse because they have no love and because there's no love there's no forgiveness and then you find where there's no forgiveness there is no faith because faith is based on forgiveness the Prophet said in the last days that the love would be so far away that the only love you'll find will be among the elect that's the only love that would be left will be among the elect as the song says they will know they will know that we are Christians not by belt buckle but by tonight those who despitefully use you to love those who kill you if they had the opportunity we need work I need work especially when you drive down Tennessee Highway i-40 you realize you need work but we're gonna get there because he said we would see faith is based on forgiveness where there is love there is forgiveness Jesus expressed that so well on the cross when they had beat him until he had been beaten more than any man has faced the Bible said was Lord more they need him in facing them had been more his head was plastic normal size his eyes were swollen shut every time he spoke blood splattered out of his mouth he was bleeding out of his mouth bleeding out of his face bleeding out of his body bleeding out his everywhere in blood was he said I am poured out like water and they hung him there on that cross and no doubt the Flies were blowing on the blood as it was drying on his body but he looked upon those with duit oh god think of it he looked upon those who had beat him like that say I'd beat him unmercifully that Jesus looked at them with what little vision he had through his swollen eyes he pushed upon the cross in you all he said Father forgive to him why did he say that because he loves them look at Joseph his brothers threw him in a pit sewed him into slavery look at all he endured and when they got caught up with myself oh god Joseph is gonna kill us now this is it we're gonna who are gonna get paid back he's gonna make us pay back he's got that hot position now he has the authority he didn't really stick it to us they just knew they was gonna have it and Joseph dismissed his wife and there he stood with his brothers and said this is it it's gonna be swift it's gonna be just but you know what he said he looked at them and he forgave them because he loved them the Bible says well I was yet a sinner Christ died for me he was down in the muck the mess of my life and he lifted me up he loved me when I was unlovable he forgave me when I shut up and I forget the bonds he passed over millions to bring this message to you because he loves you see if he loved me enough to die for us if he loved us enough to die for us my brother my sister he loved us enough to heal us he loved us enough to lead us he loved us enough to rapture us real genuine love produces confidence that he's forgiven us he has forgiven me Oh God spotted my mistakes it's part of my failures he loved me you mean back there way back there and not indecent remaining one no I'm talking about this week just like you when we stopped our when we messed up yeah he loves us anyhow and that produces faith if he loves me enough to forgive me he'll take care of me then I can have confidence I can have faith in what the word says I am by the blood of Jesus that's it friends it's not what I can do myself that's what he's done for me hallelujah like that little chicken you think bream just told those stories to be telling them they had meanings that little chicken child I mean that little Eagle he tried his best to be a chicken he tried to walk like them cluck like him roost like him he tried his best they said you're the funniest looking chicken ever seen this I don't care if I'm funny or not I'm still a chicken cockadoodledoo or whatever you know but one day was out there in the middle of that barnyard and Mama remembered she had junior I've got one down there somewhere and she flew over the barnyard when she begin to fly and she let out the scream of an eagle everything that wasn't an eagle ran but why did you do something about the deep begin to call under the deep and junior didn't run he began to look up and we begin to look up he saw the head he saw the wings he saw the feet then he looked at himself and he looked up and he looked at himself when he looked up and he said that's me that's me that's Lyle not the son of Mary Jo and James Oberg Ward I'm an attribute of gold you see Jesus had perfect faith because he relied on what he was he knew he was loved by the father he relied and knowing he was the word and he had faith in the God who made him the word he knew what he was there for he relied upon what God made him now think about that for me don't just leave that with Jesus but just bring it down into yourself just a little bit and let these words become your words he knew what he was there for he realized about what God made him what did God make us believers the bride of Jesus Christ I didn't make myself that he chose me that's what he made me he predestinated made a dig at you he relied upon what God had made you he recognized listen to these four quotes what we're been said about Jesus and it's perfect faith he relied he relied upon what God had made you he recognized himself in the written word now he win it as the temple on the seventh day as it was this custom and the priests hitting the book and he turned over to the Book of Isaiah and he said the spear the Lord is upon me because he's anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty Bruce he hath anointed me to do these things to preach acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book because the rest of that verse belongs to you when he would do that in the day of the bride he closed the book he handed it back to the priest and the Bible said the eyes of all the people was upon him and he began to say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now if you'll allow me to translate that into hillbilly so that we can understand it because I'm a hillbilly he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears but to give the translation in the hillbilly what he really said was it's me speaking of Isaiah was speaking of me this day the words of Isaiah is fulfilled here elided knowing he was the word and he had faith in the God who made him the word then if that's true for the bridegroom and the same word speaks for the bridegroom speaks for the bride then can't we rely upon what God made us as believers the word says the believers shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe the Bible said we're believers because we believe why do you call yourself believers because we believe well why do you believe because we're believers well I know you're believers but why ID are you believers we're believers because we believe but why do you believe because we're believers that's why believers down pretty simple ad it's just simple amen hey man see he had faith in what he was Jesus said destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up now why did he say that he said that because the word said that and he knew he was that word manifested he knew that when David said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither I'll leave his soul in hell jesus knew David was not talking about himself because David saw corruption therefore Jesus knew that David was prophesied with him and he said it's me I am who David was prophesied of David under inspiration was speaking of the Holy One Jesus knew he was the fulfillment of that that boy said I will not see corruption led me in a tomb but I'll rise again you see he went to Calvary believing if I lay my life down the word says he'll raise me up again he went to Calvary relying on what the word said would take place he went to Calvary relying upon what the word said would take place then when we lay our hands on the sick brother West and pray for the sick it's not my responsibility to heal them the Bible said I would do that then if I do what the word says we can expect what the word says will happen and the word says we can expect that's going to be the outcome the believers shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover that's the outcome of the believers that's what believers do we don't have to pump it up we don't have to work it up we just lay our hands on the sick and they recover because that's what the word says [Applause] amen he understood his position he understood his position because he knew what the scripture said about this if he had faith in what he was because the word said he was there and he proved he was there then can't we as believers rely upon what the word says we are who God help us Lord let that quicken to us that we can recognize ourselves in the scriptures and we can look and say it's me see brother bear who told the story several different times he told the story and I've told you here before brother Donnie's brother did ever a lot of brothers has told the story about the little boy in the mirror we all remember the story but I got to looking at that story and I thought it was interesting the last three times that I found brother Benny mentioned that story now I don't think they come to brother brems said you know program I know you try to save money you try to keep your expenses low and you've been leaving about 15 20 sometimes 25 minutes on the tape is there any story you could tell and take out 15 or 20 minutes of tape and then we'll only have five minutes left yeah I think I could find a story you know something I heard when I was a boy and I'll put a story on I don't believe that but I believe when he was telling these stories when he was preaching the word he was trying to get us to understand something the story of the eagle he was trying to get us to understand you're not a chicken you're Annie who you always were an eagle I didn't come to mix up a doctor not come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and scare that you don't know who you are you're not going to be you are now sons and daughters of God you always were sons and daughters of God he comes to tell that so I was looking the last three times that I found that brother Brennan told this story was 63 in a message called identification then he told it again in 64 in a message called things that are to be and then the last time that I found brother Ben I mentioned it was in 1965 in a message titled leadership now you know the story the little boy goes where Ben one place he says it was his grandmother's house in another place he says it was his aunt's house I mean it goes down to the story you know the the details of the story but the meaning of the story is what we really want to understand anyhow so the boy goes down to the house he's never seen the mirror before and he kind of gets bored you know and he goes in there playing in the house and he shuts the door when he does all of a sudden that's the little boy well this you know his mom and his grandma hours and whoever it was you know they're in the house that come to see what the noise was so they were standing back and they were watching and the little boy waved at the boy and the boy way back little boy messed with his hair and the boy messed with his hair and he jumped out of the mirror and he jumped back and the boy jumped back so he made a funny face and the boy made a funny face and he got closer and closer because it attracted his attention so he began to draw closer to the mirror and he got closer and closer and he touched it and when he touched it the realization struck him and he said why mama it's me it's me and brother Ben said that's what we want to look at tonight I want you to look at me and I want you to look at yourself as we look into God's great mirror the mirror of his word let's be able to identify ourselves with son that we're going to speak about some of the characters listen to this quote some of the characters at other times I want to see myself in God's looking-glass because if anything will show you where you're standing it's this book I'm sure tonight we ought to find ourselves somewhere in some character of the Bible now listen the rest of this quote so by doing that we would know the outcome of that character and then we would know what our outcome would be no words we would be the mirror of that character if we can find ourselves in some character in the Bible and see how God dealt with them and see how God moved with them and to see their outcome then we could see what by knowing that outcome we would know our ELCA so I thought about that I thought now if that's true somewhere in the message we should be able to find that so I got to looking and I come across a very interesting thing I come across the black woman in Memphis whose boy got out of his God social disease and was dying of syphilis and he's landed on the bed and she got down to pray and she said Lord if I'd be like that shoe to my woman if I'd be like that shooter my woman then where's your prophet now she identified herself with the character in the Bible and she said if I be like her where is your prophet and so we're brother Brendan was flying and they grounded the airplane beam up in the Peabody Hotel he goes out to Miller postcard the Spirit of God says turn around start walking and he finds himself in a black neighborhood he's singing I'm one of him I'm one of them and as he passes by the gate aunt he's standing there that's what they called him in that day and he was standing there with her with her back was wet from them from the do been out there since 3 o'clock in the morning and the Prophet stops singing tipped his hat to her and said morning and she said morning parson and he said how do you know I was a preacher and she said I know she's coming now for those who preach that God tells this prophesy God's only tells his prophets and the only speech this prophets who told her that come on soba nonfat sisig where's your satchel you're supposed to have a satchel with you he said I left it in the room so who knew more about what was happening the profit or her come on somebody please she identified herself in the Bible like the pseudonym woman God said I lied you to her outcome because you know the rest of the story brother Bennett brightful he said mama let's get light in the room Oh do you love you God said in Jeremiah said I know the thoughts I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end you see God hasn't expected in for us to bring us to our final outcome you see the Prophet said if you were in his thinking at the beginning you were in his thinking at the beginning if you've got eternal life anybody here like that deceiver how many's got eternal life then if you've got to eternal life guess where you was you was in his thinking at the beginning there's only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and it has no ending so if you have eternal life your attribute of God stinking before there was anything but him and remember your eyes oh god your stature whatever you was you were in his thinkin at the beginning and the only thing that you are is the expression after he thought it he spoke it and here you are so what are you you are the food you are the spoken word thoughts of God Express for the hour that you live it in if you can catch that revelation you can say it's me if it isn't if he wasn't in his thinking there's no way at all for you to ever be there he's the one that gives eternal life and you were in his thinking your name and all and he before knowledge or danger to see this he ordained me to see this and you that was not ordained will never see it so just be kind to you'll have to argue you don't have to argue fuss get all mad on face you don't have to do that if it's not for them it's not for them you know why I don't go to chess matches because it ain't for me I couldn't have a clue who not to reward I don't know no that's the I try to play it like checkers that's true it means nothing to me so if I leave something at your house don't ever bring it to a chess mat to give it back to me because I won't be there because that ain't Who I am has nothing to do with me you understand what I'm saying that's why the case stay that's why they must go or they might hang on for awhile but it is not for them just love them just be good to them just be kind to them and thank God that your eyes can't see your hour thank you day because I tell you it's only by the grace of Almighty God amen read memory says in the name of the Lord Jesus the hour is here would you believe him won't you give your life to Him the hours here for what brother Branham the hour is here to see this this was a previously in a mystery this was foul dust we didn't understand it but don't you understand the word has become more plainer that more plainer that more plainer why it is the hour you see the word mirror the word mirror reveals to us our word image like the little boy we say it's me that moment that moment that you recognize yourself that moment that you see yourself in the vision now think about that just a minute think about that the moment that you catch the realisation that he is talking about me when you realize that God had a dream God had a vision God had a plan whatever words you want to use God had it and when you begin to realize I am a part of God's plan he said brother is that possible do you think it's possible that someone could actually see their self in the vision is that possible could that be possible that someone could actually see a vision and see their self now think of it that God would have a dream or God would have a vision or God would have a plan and come down at the end time tear off the seals open the mysteries and reveal to you you as a part of it the whole time can you imagine that moment in time when you realize I'm a part of the vision you're the expression you're the thought that God thought you are a part of the vision now listen listen to this prayer line 1953 the woman seems to be going for me she's in a hospital or a doctor's office or hospital room or something she's been examined and they're pressing on her side it's it's it's it's on the left side and there's a middle-aged man and it's a it's a tumor it's in the left side of the woman there's two doctors and they're they're at they're at one says it's to be operated on another says it can't be operated on that's why I trust God more than I trust doctors one said it came to the Senate must be met I'm glad God's Word EJ Nene one said to be operating the other says it can't remember is that the truth was that description exactly I just see something moving I see something moving she's you've been praying for before in a in a meeting and the agenda avenge allistic meeting there's a man that's kind of kind of dark handed then her why it was me I pray for you you had a tumor in the brain and you were healed I see a light flash around you okay amen he wasn't making that stuff up he saw it when it happened on that day and when he saw the vision again he saw the light flash again Oh God you were healed with the tumor in the brain you're not fun this city you're from Illinois is that right here's a different one divine healing 54 I trusted he will give you the desire of your heart knowing you're a Christian you're not a critic you're a firm believer in what I'm talking about and then that way I can help you the first thing you're a woman suffering with a woman's trouble a female condition you may not know this yes yes you do you do know it you have trouble in your head which is cancer and it's on the brain but God will make you well you I see you sometimes setting just holding your hands like this you've been in another meeting somewhere you was holding yourself breathless it was something taking place at a platform why it's me it was Portland Oregon when the maniac was condemned I see him fall on the floor now and roll oh god you're healed sister go home and be made well in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he saw himself in the vision he said it's me I'm the one that prayed for you you remember the vision of the caribou with a 42 inch rack remember that vision and brother BAM said there's some young boys hands and there would be a man there with a green checkered shirt and we weren't a pair of British Columbia to hunt he said this looks like the area I talked to brother Eddie Bisco this week I was asking about this vision I said brother Eddie could you tell me about this vision and he began to tell me said you know brother down brother branham called me a month before we went on the hunt a month before the hunt brother branham called me and was telling me about the vision that he had and that that part of the country looked like that that vision made me fulfilled he said brother Darrell he was telling me that I had no idea it was just a vision he said we went out that morning I was crossing a log I just a cutting short we're losing time he said I slipped and fell into a creek he said I had green checkered shirt but I told my wife to throw it away said that store in a couple places that I I didn't want to I said throw it away so I fell in I got wet I waited put on the shirt he said I wore the shirt all day long I knew it was green checker but I never thought a thing about it so here he was putting on a shirt in his tent it was green checkered time out maybe got him a cup of coffee at the campfire before he headed out again worried all day long talking laughing praying over lunch wearing the shirt and the whole time the vision was being played out brother man suits the caribou they management 42 inch horns everybody in the camp said nobody had a shirt like that brother man said perhaps it'll be somewhere else then but the vision will be he's anybody perhaps it'll be somewhere else he went out there he killed the caribou 40 teenagers brother and said enough somebody should have on a green check or surety said why brother any and brother any said brother man I didn't know who but that moment in time that non I said how did you feel when you realized I'm a part of the vision I'm the green checkered shirt I am the green checkered shirt that's me that's who I am I'm not the measuring tape I'm not the little boys heads that was somebody else Oh God I'm not the one that shot it that was somebody else but I am my part of the vision my part of the vision is I am that green checkered shirt you see you may never be the pastor but you've got a part of the vision you everybody's got a part they must play you've got to find yourself in the vision and you've got to say by faith it is me now let me hurry our scripture reading you know brother Brennan oh but nobody can dramatize like brother Brennan the birdramon relaying this this story I didn't I'm in a meeting now the day before this event that we read about in the scriptures took place brother Ben just talks he talks it just starts dramatizing and he said Joseph and Mary went to church that morning they were sitting on the porch Ector Sunday dinner and they was talking and Joseph said halt Mary wasn't that a wonderful service this morning and my goodness didn't that Rabbi certainly bring the Word of God to us and they were just talking you know and Mary said that because they were you know they they were to be married and me know the Prophet said Mary said you know you know Joseph dear I think it would be good if we just ran a few scriptures they said well Mary that's wonderful of you said going there and find us something to read now the prophet of God said in that day course the Bible wasn't scrolls had a scroll of Isaiah or Jeremiah they was rolled up in wood you've seen the scrolls and they had like a wasted like thing and they would just stick these scrolls down in it so you would go in there and you would pull out the scroll Jeremiah or the scroll of Isaiah and so Mary goes in there now it wasn't that chance because I believe the footsteps of a good man is ordered of the Lord she goes in there and pulls out the scroll of the prophet Isaiah and she brings it out to Joseph he opens a screw and he begins to read a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and they shall call his name counselor mighty God principes everlasting father and Mary was listening she was listening to that word and when he got done read and married her innocence she said Joseph what is that prophet talking about a virgin so I can see what does he mean by that and Joseph being an honest man he looked right at her and he said I don't know I don't know what the prophets talking about Mary but there's one thing I do know if God said it God is able to keep that what she said you see my brother my sister I don't have to be a lot of people on Facebook I don't have to try to figure it out I don't have to try to find a newspaper or some kind of article to Vindicator this iceberg I'm not that kind of guy I simply believe it because God said so amen that's why I believe it I don't have to understand it I don't have to figure it out I'll believe it by faith hey can you say amen to that listen to me I don't know how God opens blinding eyes oh I know there's one day just to settle my lap she couldn't see me for nothing and the next day she could see how God done it I don't know I don't know how he done it I'm just glad that he does it hey man I don't know how he got Jessie on that wheelchair I don't know one day she's in a wheelchair have no control over her body the next day she's walking on us I don't know I don't know how he done it I don't know how he made Christina's leg grow out in Romania when the guy said I watched it brother Darrell grow out in the meekness she walked out well I don't know how he done it I don't know how that woman's tumor fell off the back of her ear a parallel how a few a few weeks ago six seven months ago waves I don't know how that happened freeze I don't understand it but I don't have to understand you I just believe you know I believe because I believe I believe he's able to do anything he said he would do so the next morning Mary he goes down to wash clothes and on her way down she couldn't get that off of her mind that remark that Joseph made when he stopped at that scripture of Isaiah 9:6 he said you know Mary I always thought she was the beautifulest girl in the whole community but somehow in just the last few minutes you're more beautiful than ever who your eyes or the sparklin just when I'm mixing that scripture a virgin shall conceive it's just like you illuminated it's just like you lit up and she was thinking why why did that scripture do that to me when I heard that Scripture why did it bring that kind of response to me like we brother Donny it's taking the mysteries of God and laying them out to us and the church starts hearing those words and starts line upon line precept upon precept and the Roar begins just like last Wednesday when brother Tim was here and he began to lay out that word and lay out that's close and you begin to grab it and the roar of the people why what was he feeling the same thing she was oh you're feeling the same thing sheep that wah that word for you it's coming alive in you she saw a flicker of life the puffer God said I'm hurry now she turned another corner saw another freak love ride but the Prophet said when she got to where was just a small place where only her could pass because you see it's an individual affair it's not you and your mama you and your daddy you and your husband it's you in Christ he's revealed to you personally what his new birth Barbara's Christ revealed to you personally you've met this person yourself once God was just just her could only go through and when she got to that little narrow place well the only place she could do is look up there she met the messenger there she met the angel with that light standing around him and it startled her and he said he'll my thought highly favoured of God Oh God think of it that little woman in the meanest City there wasn't Palestine the meanest city there was can anything good come out of Nazareth Kenny thank God got out of that city we say the same thing tonight can anything good come out of Laodicea I say to you come and see come and see hey man you see she lived a good life God chose her for a certain work he was going to do that was highly favored you see God chose her she never volunteered she was chosen but forgot she she I wasn't looking for God you wasn't looking for God God came looking for us Isaiah said we shall be called the people who's known as the salt out people who sold us out he did he come looking for me he come looking for you don't you see he said all I'm gonna find us [Applause] he began to reveal to her the scriptures he begin to take the words of Isaiah and make him real to her she knew the angels message was scriptural she began to think about the porch she began to think about the scriptures she began to think about the things that she had heard just yesterday and while they angel messenger standing there vindicated by God a vindicated messenger from God telling her the revealed Word of the hour taking the words of the Prophet and tying him together and making them real to her when she was hearing those words and she began to think of what see her yesterday and she began to hear what he did on her her she knew his message was scriptural and at that moment of time she realized it's me when Isaiah wrote a virgin shall conceive he was writing about me at that moment Mary realized it's me Isaiah was speaking about me I am Who as a a saw in a vision think of that Oh God if you could only grasp that tonight just take that and bring it down to earth day it's the same thing God said to us a vindicated messenger to take the mysteries of the word what did he tell us he come to tie up the loose ends and what did he come to do show us who we average I can see think how crazy that is no matter how crazy it sound to the world the prophets prophesy and came out on the scroll and was now flesh don't you see yesterday the scripture is fulfilled in your ears the attraction had left the prophet and was now on his prophecy she was what was happening what's happening in this out what is God doing in this hour she could say it's it's me God sent a messenger to her to tell her she was the vision it's you his shoe but you see she he had to receive the messengers message just like you must receive what I've told you tonight you've got one or two choices you need to take what I've said to be the truth and believe I was speaking about you or you can say I simply don't know about that and walk out the building the same way you came in but you see the angel has come with a message I don't we know God has sent a messenger the seventh angel messenger has come to us he has come to us with the message and that message has told us your predestinated but God he was in God's thinking before there was ever of the world he was in God's thinking then he know the color eyes he knew you hair color he knew even your name he knew everything about you but you see she had to receive the angel's message and what did she say here's what she said something simple not not something mind-blowing just four little words be it unto me be it unto me think of it friends the wickedness darkest days God once more is a messenger with the light to tell you you are the vision you are the dream you are the thought that God taught in the meanest darkest age of Laodicea get anything out of a seer yes I'm looking at it an angel messenger with a great light what did he come to do he come to cause us to refocus if you can only realize it's me it's me I am the vision I am the prophecy I am the dream I am the thought I am the manifestation I am the word I am the wheat plant I am Psalms 24 Psalms 27 it's speaking of me the rapture chapters Genesis 5 Enoch walked with God and was not that's me that's me it's me I'm the one he died for it's me I'm the one he would strike for by His stripes you are healed he took those times for me he died for me I'm the one he died for I'm the one he was fought for I'm the one he's covered for of the one he loves pop the one he taught us I'm the one he chosen everything you've heard brother Donny preacher everything brother Tim spoke last week the things brother David's be speaking other brothers Ben's me can you see it can't you understand it can you grasp it can you receive it and say it's me he's speaking of me this is who I am this is what I do you've got to say it for yourself you've got to express it for yourself you know why I'm closing because this is the spoken word age it's not the age of not in your hand it's not the age of clapping your hands though there's nothing wrong with that we appreciate it when you clap it makes you just like saying sick until don't we appreciate that but this is a spoken word age more than just a nod you must speak it why because your body will obey your confess daddy we must speak we must speak what the word says about us all about over clapping oh yeah I'm going in a rap sir not ever son of wood this is who I am this is what the word says I am
