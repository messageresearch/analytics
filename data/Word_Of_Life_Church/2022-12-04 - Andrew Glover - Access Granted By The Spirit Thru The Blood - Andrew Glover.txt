of Jesus what a wonderful name it is the name of Jesus [Music] are you sure that's your name too the first time that name was ever mentioned a dead baby in his mother's womb jump to life whenever you heard that name what did it do to you or some of you maybe the first time you heard it it was used in vain Associated it was cursing or this or that or that but that wasn't really the first time your soul heard it when your soul heard that name it did something to you and changed you forever and the effects are still ongoing to this very day being changed by that wonderful name isn't it a privilege for us to be together today amen so glad to see each of you and happy happy that we can be here in this place that we've set aside to be able to Worship the Lord I'm sure the Devils will be glad whenever we've got our own place because they're just trying to figure out what in the world is going on here on Holiday Inn well as long as we're here this is our place we're just thanking God for it but we're believing the Lord that he's going to help us to be able to get our new place done and we can have our own place back nothing like being at home are they we're so blessed today for brother Andrew to be with us and we just want to open our hearts I know all of you have needs Desires in your heart things you need from the Lord so we just want to ask him to help us speak to us no matter what you need it doesn't really matter you may look at your need compared to others you think it's so small but I'm so glad the Lord doesn't categorize things in that way heard from several last night and this morning that are dealing with sickness and flu and this and that and the other so we certainly want to remember different ones that can't be here today but we know that our Lord is so mindful for many of you that maybe haven't heard but eugenius back in the Hospice place over near in Bristol there near the Bristol Medical Center Lord willing with Andrew and I'll be going to see him today and if the Lord doesn't move for him this may be our brothers going home time the family as well that the Lord had just had just been comfortable he told me the other day when I went to see him he said I didn't really want to come here hospice he said I don't want nobody to think I've lost faith and I said brother Eugene I don't know of anyone that would think that about you you have been faithful you fought a good fight you've kept the faith that's what we believe in amen so if it is time for our brother to go home it'll be one of the happiest funerals that I've ever preached in my life yeah you know why because his battle his rage going on day after day hour after hour I laid my hand over on his knee the other night as I was standing by his bed and his knee was about the size of my elbow and my arm it looks so pitiful why could we not rejoice are just beyond this life is a body that he'll never be sick again never be weary never be tired it'll be a great homecoming I don't think it's going to be long we'll all be gathered together anyway so just remember them if you would let's just pray together we're going to ask for them to come out and just give us what the Lord's placed on his heart how many has the need to request from your heart today you'd like to be remembered God bless you heavenly father is we stand here on this side of the Veil the way we look at deaths and the resurrection and all that lays before us there's still an element of uncertainty to us and we don't know exactly what it's like someone asked me the other day is there pain in the Rapture will we hurt what will happen I couldn't rightly answer them because I don't know for sure myself but I know it'll be in a moment in a twinkling of an eye even for deaths when a child of God goes we know that you send someone down to the river Force so we're praying Lord that if this is our brother's time that you'll be mindful of him and Sister Janet his sons family church family Lord these other needs and requests as I mentioned hearing from several in the last couple of days some of the flu some with coveted some with after effects of this and that and the other but we pray that it should be mindful of us all today Jesus someone just telling me just a little bit ago that doctors are saying there's six different viruses that are going around right now that's besides flu and covid so certainly the devil's on a rampage but we believe in all hell goes to breaking loose all Heaven comes down so we're just believing you to manifest yourself and if we can look at it right these things we go through are opportunities of Faith by which the supernatural can manifest itself we've gathered here today Lord and we've come to worship to sing to pray to praise no doubt different needs maybe some are discouraged some are weary but whatever every person your needs today we believe that you are more than Able by now they've already met in Uganda all kinds of little churches all over the countries in the cities they've already met in Kenya they've met in Europe they've met in England they've met in Norway New Zealand Australia many of them have met around the world and part of them now are streaming us because we're several hours behind them so they've already testified that you was in their service today so Lord God We Believe on this one's over we'll be able to testify the same come today Father we ask that you would anoint our brother help him to get out of the way speak to us the words of life we love you today Jesus help us now fathers we open our hearts to the word of God and the Saints said amen let's sing together he touched me praise the Lord no matter whether you need a physical touch a spiritual touch whatever you need it all comes basically the same way I've been listening to a sermon preached in Chicago in 1961 called getting in the spirit and it's a wonderful message if you haven't heard it in a while and brother Brandon was talking about faith and our needs and the things that we have need of and he said many people tried to reach for orchid Faith Orchid Orchid the beautiful flower you know what an orchid is he said they try to reach for orchid faiths but he said the faith that you need is just the common everyday weed face because hyssop was a weed that growed out of the walls it growed out of rocks it just growed everywhere so we like and face to being like a weed he said the faith you need is the exact same face that you start your car with that you get in your car and you go somewhere so what do we all do after church we'll get our keys and maybe your car doesn't have even an ignition anymore a lot of them don't they just got a button but you still got to have your thing there with you and what do you do by face you reach and push the button or by faith you put the key and the ignition I thought how simple and he said people are trying to reach out for that when all you need is weed face isn't that wonderful but remember the devil's got his weed killer and he'll try to kill that faith of yours and make you think you ain't got it but you know the very same faith that helps you get up every day get you out of the bed start your car does this or that it's that common it's not some great something that I've got to reach way out yonder somewhere it's just common everyday phase so let's reach out to him today was the faith that is growing out of the cracks of your walls I was shy shackle by [Music] e just touch me [Music] now [Music] [Applause] [Music] I touch my soul [Music] [Music] thank you Lord thank you what about her brother to come out now second verse [Music] at me a song [Music] [Music] to praise him [Music] can we just worship while we sing it together [Music] [Applause] [Music] enjoy that floods my soul [Music] and I am [Music] he touched me and me [Music] hey man how many witnesses do we have here this morning amen that you can touch him and the greatest thing about it is he can touch you amen I believe a touch of the Lord this morning would do more for us than any doctor or psychologist or a lawyer Amen to be touched by him this morning would change everything amen we say God bless you all this morning I feel the spirit of the Lord here among us today don't you amen I believe he's brought us together for a purpose and that is to reveal himself to us and amen to manifest himself in our midst and we want to greet you all this morning in the name of the Lord and it's sure good to see everyone out this morning in the house of God I know there's a lot of sickness going around and things but Amen to see those of you that can be here this morning we amen have come under expectation amen and if you have your Bibles today we'll go straight to the word we want to read a few places in the New Testament we want to look in the Book of Romans the fifth chapter and while you're turning there this morning I want to greet you on behalf of our pastor brother Sean Martin and the Saints there at Faith Tabernacle in Blacksburg Virginia send their greetings to you I know uh brother Terry and brother Amos would want us to be sure and greet you all for them this morning so we say God bless you from them and we want to say we appreciate brother Donnie and his friendship and that's always an honor to be here and to come back home and to see all the folks here and to be with brother Donnie we say God bless you and appreciate you and you stand for this word and amen I know you all are under anticipation for that new building any day amen so but we just want to look here this morning in the Book of Romans the fifth chapter I want to look in the first verse Paul here writing says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ but whom also we have access somebody say access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God now Paul uses a word there access that I've been looking at and if we could turn to Ephesians of the second chapter Ephesians the second chapter and I want to look there in the 18th verse of Ephesians 2 he'll use this same word again in Ephesians 2 and verse 18. he says for through him we both have access by one's Spirit now in Romans 5 he said we had access by faith now he says we have access by one Spirit unto the father and if we could look at one other chapter the third chapter in the 11th verse of Ephesians Paul again uses that word again of access and in the 11th verse he says according to the Eternal purpose how many is thankful to be called by the Eternal purpose which he has purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him so now he has added boldness and confidence to this access amen let's just buy our hearts together I mean say Lord speak to me this morning amen Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our hearts before you this morning and humble our Spirits in your presence we are very well aware this morning that we are not here by ourselves but Lord there is a host of angels that's in this building today Lord there is an unseen force of the supernatural that his Lord assembled here is these Believers have assembled here now father as we join our faith together this morning and we have opened your word and Lord with physical strength we have turned the pages Lord with the natural ability of our eyes we've been able to read what the what the word says upon the page but father we're now inviting your spirit to come into this meeting Lord may you take Supreme control may you take preeminence among us today and Lord May the spiritual strength of God come into every heart and every life Lord that father you could open up what we're reading and it could be more than just a sermon it could be more than a few quotes and scriptures but Lord it could become Revelation it could become substance in the lives of these Believers now Lord I pray this morning you would send the spirit of Revelation to the meeting and Lord may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord while the word is going forth May healing take place in bodies Lord why while the word has gone forth May Deliverance take place father for those that are at home this morning Lord sick in their bodies Lord even Lord those in our own family Lord my grandmother in other words I pray this morning that your grace as your word would go forth would just touch them Lord and he would raise him up father for Lord You're Still A Healer and Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our savior the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen God bless you this morning as you can have your seats here this morning I want to by the help of the Lord to take care for a few moments and just share a few things and pray that the Lord will give us the ability to maybe draw you into the thoughts that have been upon our heart but I want to speak to you by the help of the Lord on access granted by the spirit through the blood access granted by the spirit through the blood I was listening to a tape the other day and the prophet of God says this in 1953 how the angel come to me he said our heavenly father we come tonight to worship thee how many has come to worship him today he said and we're thankful for the opportunity that we have of coming he said and through this channel of the Holy Spirit which has been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ that we have access to the throne of grace through the name of Jesus and we're so happy for it amen he said through this channel of the Holy Spirit which has been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ we have access to the throne of grace through the name of Jesus and we're so happy for it tonight I I truly believe that our access to God this morning amen is through the spirit and it comes by the blood of Jesus Christ now when you start looking at this word access Webster says it is a means of approaching or entering a place it is the right or the opportunity to use or to benefit from something it is the right or the opportunity to approach or to see someone so if you have access then you have benefits if you have access then you have rights if you have access then you actually are entitled Amen to go into what one is Desiring to go into and I find it amazing that in the age we're living in that people are always trying to find amen the easiest way to access something you know I'll say it to you like this the age that we're living in amen it has become easier than any other age to access certain things you know uh you think just maybe here on the natural side for a minute amen maybe 20 30 years ago if you wanted to see a movie or you wanted to see something you had to go to the movie theater had to go to the store had to amen but now amen to the advancement of Technology we're now carrying cell phones and then that access to these things have been made easier than ever before now amen I know that you've all heard it said we probably maybe even said it ourselves said our young people today have access to more sin and ungodliness and wickedness and amen corruption and things of perversion than any generation before and that is true because of the access that has been granted by technology they no longer have to go to the store to buy a dirty magazine but now on a little cell phone amen you can access ten times worse than what they were accessing 20 years ago Amen in a in a store but amen I'm not one that likes to leave things on the negative but let's bring that to the positive if this generation amen has more access to ungodliness and wickedness then I propose to you this morning amen that there is a group of young people on the face of the Earth that has more access to the things of God than any generation before them you say how can you say that because now according to what a prophet taught we now have access Amen to the full word in the Book of Revelation the 10th chapter the first verse you know what by heart it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven amen and he was clothed with a cloud out and a rainbow was up on his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet his pillars of fire now you know Revelation 10 1 was none other than the mighty Angel Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant you come to Revelation 10 7 and it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets so amen without Revelation 10 1 we do not have Revelation 10 7. amen because Revelation 10 1 the mighty Angel which was Christ amen was delivering to the seventh angel a message and that message amen was not a bunch of opinions it was not a bunch of Creeds it was not a bunch of dogmas it was not a furtherance a religious tradition amen but that message was the full word the prophet of God said the last message of the last Church age is not a reformer he is a prophet not a reformer amen because the word of the Lord comes to the prophet that that's the reason that they could continue on in baptism and father son Holy Ghost and all these other things because they were reformers and not prophets they were great men of God they saw the need of the day they lived in and got anointed them they sent out there and tore those thanks to Pieces but the full word of God never come to them because they was not prophets so without a prophet we don't have the full word I I know this morning that you all here are very well taught in the message but let me just let me just share my heart with you there has never been a time amen and I believe in all of time to say what a prophet said amending the time that we're living in right now listen our benefits are not coming because of what church we go to they're not coming because of what family line we come out of Amen but the benefits that we are partaking of this morning amen is coming from the message of the hour without this message we are a confused group of people without this message we have no promise of a rapture we have no promise of a resurrection amen but with this message this morning amen all things are possible to them that believe listen I know people say well sometimes amen you say too much about a prophet but let me say this amen if you see who a prophet is you'll see who you are amen if you see that he was Eliezer amen then you'll see that you're Rebecca and if you are Rebecca then you're on your way to me I say amen and if he's not Eliezer amen then you are not Rebecca and you have no hope of sin I say Amen but we are not here as a hopeless helpless amen confused generation this morning we have heard the voice of Eliezer and the voice of Eliezer has opened up the full word in this generation that we can be partakers of it listen this is not a Lutheran age remember Sid this is not a western age he said it's been the same even through this Pentecostal age but at the opening of those Seven Seals Revelation 10 amen the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength that it was when he was here on Earth manifest invested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth he says what is it it is Hebrews 13 8. it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday amen today and forever among Church what is this full word it is the Fulfillment of Luke 17 30 which set in the days when the son of man amen would be revealed from Heaven amen there would be a body of people upon the Earth that's a revelation of the son of man would be taken preeminence in their flesh listen I'll say it the way the prophet said he that believes not the full word of God is a sinner now what is a sinner a sinner amen is not a sinner because they smoke they are not a sinner because they drink but according to the prophet a sinner is a sinner amen because they disbelieve the word listen if you're going to overcome 200 000 000 Devils it's not going to come through Dr Dobson if you're going to overcome 200 000 000 Devils it's not going to come from charismatic influence it's going to come from the full word that has been released in this generation Amen to give you Rapture and Faith to give you overcoming power to give you rapturing favor listen this morning we are not here gathered amen based upon man's ideas but according to Isaiah he said that precept must be upon precept Amen in line must be upon line and here a little and they're a little remember to say when a baby is conceding the womb of a mother when that one cell goes in the air another cell Builds on top of that it's not one cell of a human and the next of a dog and the next of a kind and the next is something else amen from the first sale to the last it's absolutely straight human being he said see and when a man is born of the spirit of God he don't inject anything into his life amen it's unadulterated word of God Vindicated for that hour he takes the full word of God he don't put no Creeds or nothing else in it it is purely unadulterated it is God's word made manifest Among Us I'm on church amen this bride is not part by ambition part Methodist and part Pentecostal and part Catholic and part return in part 7 Thunder and part Perugia amen this Bride is a word born bride amen she's been born by the sale of the word of almighty god listen we're not here injecting our ideas in this message we're not here wider in this Mrs tale and diluting it with some type of idea amen but there's a bride here this morning who is precept upon precept she is lying upon line she is weared upon word she is manifesting Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now when I think about this how amen could we not be happy to know that this morning we have the full word how can we not be happy this morning listen I know you got troubles I know you got trials I know you got situation amen but I didn't come to tell you got all those things I come to tell you you got the full word and if you got the full word you got everything you need if you got the full word you got joy unspeakable and full of Glory if you got the full word you've got healing and peace and deliverance he that believes not the full word is a sinner now when you look at this full word according to the prophet in the token he said the full obedience Amen to the full word of God is what entitles us to the Token no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word you'll never be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word fully obey what word the full word see not what somebody has put into it or added to it amen but what God has said about it do you realize when a Prophet come on the saying amen man had so injected so many ideas on the way into the things of God Amen they had people with joining churches signing cards putting their name on a church register amen but the full word said amen Jesus first Doctrine was ye must be born again amen all the way amen back in the Book of John the third chapter there was a man by Nicodemus and he said how can I go amen into the father how can I go he said a man must be born again is it okay to preach this morning a man must be born again amen let's say that together you must be born again amen I don't care how revelated we got that's still a principle amen we must be born again and I'll tell you what will fix a lot of our problems just some new births I tell you what'll fix a lot of troubles this new birth amen Creeds and reformations will never change a person amen but a new birth through the water and the blood and the spirit of Jesus Christ will take a sinner and make a Son of God out of him and those churches there's still power in the blood is there still power to take a drunk and make a preacher out of him is there still power to take a young man that is addicted to sin and the things of the world and set them free I say there's still power in the birth of Jesus Christ there's still Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar that don't mean walk back there and shake hands with a pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done it means putting it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means Death to Your First being and Life to your second being the new birth is death to the first man and it is life to the second being it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ now when you look at this you realize this morning that God Amen has given his believing children amen the promise of access you say what is that promise of access I said to you like this it is that all things that are in Christ amen belong to you and you have access to them all things that are in Christ belong to you and you have access to them how many will agree that in Christ we have all things I love what Paul says he said we he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely amen give us all things then this morning church amen we are not earning all things we are not buying all things amen but Christ amen through his death at Calvary which was a propitiation for our sins amen through the blood we have access to All Things remember say when the word when the work is finished we have all things again what kind of all things he said we have all power we have eternal life we have eternal Health we have eternal youth we have eternal power he said oh we are just Eternal with eternal we are Eternal with the Eternal then this morning church we are not trying to gain access amen but by the shed blood amen every man woman boy and girl amen has got a right by the blood to come into the things of God well the prophet said he said all things are ours now watch this if all things are ours then we have access to all things he said we're not wanting you to join a church I'm asking you this one thing amen we have in common that is Jesus Christ he is in common with us we can all be Baptist so we can't all be methodists we can't all be wonders or threateness or whatever but there's one thing we have in common that is the pardoning offer of God Amen his son Jesus Christ we have all things in him see this morning the Christians he says does not realize amen what God has provided for them many people he said don't realize that the great and glorious Powers amen has been provided for them he said coming into Jesus is like walking the arcade down here at a great big department store if somebody give me a great department store in the arcade and told me this is all yours well the first thing I do I'm going to walk around in there and find out what I own because it was mine he he said and that's the way it is in Christ amen when you become a Christian amen walk around and find out what is yours what you own because all things are yours they are given to you freely I don't have I'm on church amen how long are some of y'all going to sit there and let other people around you walk around in their blessings and walk around well we might as well preach it's Sunday morning amen how long you're going to sit there and let somebody else walk around in the Revelation and walk around in the understanding come on if you are a son of God if you are a daughter of God then your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life and by the authority of the word this morning you've got every right Amen to go in and possess amen when Christ died that you can have come on if he said we can have joy somebody start walking around in it if he say we can have peace amen somebody start walking around and they said we could have love somebody start walking around if they said we can have healing and miracles and signs and wonders and infallible proofs of his resurrection then don't you think it's time amen for the church the Living God Amen to put your walking shoes on and start walking in the blessings I'm on Church you know what a prophet's head he said footsteps means Possession come on footsteps means possession every place that the soul of your foot sets upon he says that have I given you as a possession well glory to God it's time to walk around it's time to see what's has freely been given to us everything that Christ died for is yours every one of you and you got a checkbook with Jesus name signed across there the problem is you're just scared to fill it out amen but can I tell you this morning there's never been one check amen bounced in the kingdom of God there's never been one check amen returned insufficient funds in the kingdom of God you gotta check for your healing you gotta check for your prodigals you gotta check for your joy you gotta check for your health how long are you going to sit there and say well someday somehow I say this morning I say this hour I say this day this time time has come upon you to move into the promises that God died for you to move into there is only one way that we have access and that is not by our works that is not by our church standing that is not by our social standing Paul said amen there is one body and there is one spirit and you are called in one hope of your calling I love what Birmingham says he said let that spirit that dominated his body and his mind controlled him come into us tonight and interpret the word and preach the word and give it to our Hungry Heart as we wait on him then what that tells me is you are the body and he is the spirit you are the body and he is the spirit then the spirit of God is superior to all other Spirits there is not one spirit that the spirit of God is inferior to the spirit of God is superior over Rebellion the spirit of God is superior over witchcraft the spirit of God is superior over cancer the spirit of God is superior over organization come on Church you know I'm telling you the truth amen the spirit of God Amen will never be defeated the spirit of God will never be overcome because that spirit is the spirit that was in his body has returned in this body and we are living in the age when the spirit of God has dominated a body and that body is controlled by the word and in the only way they go is by the word you got life this morning you got a body you got life in it listen then you're moved by a spirit now when you think about this we're living in a very odd time would you agree with me it's a time when the prophet of God said amen that men can achieve the greatest thing you know what the greatest thing to achieve is is life remember I said the greatest thing go over to Heaven talk to Father Abraham he'll tell you the greatest thing there is to achieve is life now I want you to catch something he says the greatest thing we can achieve is life then he turns around and says but people are so dissatisfied with life he said that they are trying to end their life think about that amen the very Fang amen that God through a prophet told this generation they could achieve amen was like and then he turns around and says but they're so dissatisfied amen with that life that they're trying to end their life you know I'm telling you the truth amen we got superheroes and Superstars and Hollywood idols and they've got millions up on top of millions up on top of billions of dollars and they're committing suicide and they're overdosing on pills amen they got life amen but it's a miserable life they got they got all this money they got all this wealth amen but in their soul it's a cavern that is crying amen for a satisfaction and the prophet said there's only one way that the human soul will ever be satisfied that is not by Creeds that is not by traditions and it's not by religion it is by the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ the only thing that will ever satisfy the craving in a man's heart is the blood now when you look at this you realize that there's actually two types of Life there is a natural life and then there is a spiritual life you know how the Natural Life comes the Natural Life comes through amen what the prophet called this sexual blood now you say how does the spiritual life come remember said the spiritual life comes amen through the blood of God I love what Paul says he said if in this life only we have hope in Christ then we are of all men most miserable if in this life only thing we have amen is hope we are of all men most miserable but any man that is in Christ Jesus is a new creation he is a new creature amen and he's not just living with a natural life from a natural father and a natural mother oh God have mercy but he is living with a spiritual DNA of the almighty God oh God her own church you're not the Sons and Daughters of a pomper you are the sons and Ballers of God and your father owns the cattle on a thousand hills your father walks on water your father turns water into wine your father raises the dead your father heals cancer your father provides I'll tell you what David said David said I once was young amen but now I'm old and I've never seen the righteous forsaken or exceed bacon bread then quit living like pompers cause you're not one quit living like spiritual welfare people cause you're not on spiritual welfare you have got a God who has got sufficient funds he can satisfy whatever your right protect for there is no money there is no value in that sexual blood but through the blood of God are you hearing me the access then to eternal life that's not come through the sexual blood it does not come through the religious blood it comes through the perfect blood of almighty God when a man's born again it won't do any good and he can't be born again listen until life comes into him are you hearing me he cannot be born again until life comes into him now watch this I thought you had life I thought everybody had life they do but the life he's talking about is not the natural life it is the spiritual life it is the eternal life now he says it like this he said now look at how God planned that God is the male part that brought Jesus Christ here now God is a spirit so there couldn't be any sex there couldn't be any sexual desire because if it was then Jesus wasn't born a virgin birth he said so God is a spirit now come on I know we've got a lot of kind of preach I know we got a lot of religious people around us now these intellectuals they go around talking about how you can come into God and bypass the new birth I'll tell you what that is that's a doctrine of Cain that was originated in the guard of Eden and I've got the guests to take a sword to that devil amen because you want to put young people in prison tell them they can get to God apart from the blood you want to put them on a roller coaster every day tell them they can get in the bride apart from dying out the altar come on church I can tell you where the Prophet put it in and you show me where he took it out amen from 47 to 65 it was a new birth it was the blood it was a Sanctified and he comes in 1963 and says now we've come through the water age we've come through the blood age but now we have come to the Token age where the token must be on this plane because when the token is on display then the Covenant blood comes into full effect listen I may be the craziest preacher you ever heard but I'm going to say it this morning without the blood we're on our way to Hell Without The Blood where everyone condemned without the blood we have no future but with the blood this morning with the blood this morning all things are possible I'm on now everyone you're sitting here this morning including myself well let's just say what the Bible said he said you got an evil you got a belly button and if you got a belly button you was born a renegade I don't care what family what church what Ministry I don't care what she's raised under if you was born with a belly button you was born a renegade well that's your truth anyhow you might as well say amen I don't care how much money he had in your bank account he was born a renegade now listen that sexual blood is what condemns us that sexual blood is what keeps us out of the things of God you know why because in that sexual blood amen come traits in that blood amen things it was in Generations amen 10 Generations ago has been passed down through that sexual blood and you amen through your first birth become a victim to what was in your family lineage for years now you know amen a few years ago they actually said that alcoholism amen was not an actual it was not an actual recreational problem it was actually a trait that had been passed down through generations because one grandfather then the next grandfather then the father then the son and that alcohol trait was passed down listen when you was born you come here according to a prophet without a Fighting Chance we everyone come here without a fighting chance so we were born amen victims to our bloodline we were born victims to whatever was in our family tree amen would come upon us and there wasn't one thing we could do about it we couldn't bargain with the doctor we couldn't bargain with her mother we couldn't bargain with our father amen because it was a blood amen it was automatically passed down now come on Church in that blood was a fallen nature and listen I don't care how beautiful that little baby is before long give it time that baby will display or he will manifest that Fallen nature because he was brought here amen through a blood which was a sexual blood which goes all the way back to Genesis which separated God and man right so that child will eventually he will eventually manifest that fall of nature now watch this when he gets older he'll begin to hear about the things of God they'll begin to they'll begin to get around the things of God and they'll say my I wish I could go into that I wish I could be a partaker then I wish I could access that I wish I could have that blessing are you with me amen amen and before long they'll begin to feel condemned amen because of what is heaped upon them amen through the sexual blood listen amen there's boys amen that are that are 15 16 years old and they go in a store and somebody treats them a different way you know why but because I know who that boy's daddy is and they're holding it against that boy because that boy is Of The Bloodline of his of his daddy but can I turn a corner now and say what a prophet said he said God is a spirit and he overshadowed this marriage and created and heard the blood cell that brought forth the Son of God and it's through his holy blood that we have access to life through the sexual blood we had access to a perverted life we had access to a natural life but through the blood of the almighty God which was a created blood which comes from a blood cell through that blood we have access to life are you ready for this and the prophet said in our sexual blood is dismissed well glory to God our sexual blood is dismissed come on church then this morning you don't have to stay out of the things of God by your sexual blood you can't come in by your first birth you can't come in but by the second birth glory to God by the second birth through the blood of God by the blood cell of God you have been given access into the promises of God into the Forgiveness of God oh my we have the blood of Jesus Christ that stands for an atonement for our sins that we are not saved he says by our sexual blood we are saved by the creative blood by God's own blood himself look what Paul says in Romans 5 10 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life I'm on church where was that life coming from it was coming out of the blood and where was that blood coming from it was not coming from a Jew it was not coming from a gentile that blood was coming from God it was a creative blood I wish I was a preacher this morning it was a creative blood are you hearing me it was a blood that flew your first birth there was no way you could possess it I'm gonna feel your first birth you can come to church seven days a week and sit there condemned through your first birth you could come to the house of God and hear the word and never rise up and put a footstep on that promise and a footstep on that promise but what if I told you this morning that every one of you that's been born in the water and the blood and the spirit has got privileges you've got rights you've got access laughs and to the provisions of God by his life which shall be saved and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we now have received the atonement then the atonement did not come through the first Blood it did not come to the first birth but through the second birth through the second blood through the created blood we have received the atonement said he said how could there be a more perfect sacrifice than God himself becoming the atonement himself when God was made flesh in his own created blood only way that a life of God could ever come back because all of us were born by sex therefore the life that's in there is of the world and that life will not stand it's the thing that's already touched and condemned you can't patch it up you can't patch it up you can't smooth it out there's no way to make it better it's got to die I'm on Church what did Paul say in Romans 7. he see Brahman takes Romans 7 and preaches the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and what does he say he says your first husband must die he said not lay him aside put him in a closet he said there's got to be a death to the first man so that the new husband come on church can come into possession of this bride and listen this morning friends our first husband is not in a corner we're watching us waiting on us to fail but according to what a prophet said our first husband has died and we have been married to the new anointed word and by that word through the spirit and the blood we have access into all things that Christ died for what is it it's got to die that's the only requirement there is it's got to die now let me ask you this morning church what did Paul say he said by the access we have confidence and boldness can I ask you this morning where does your boldness come from where does your boldness come from does your boldness come from what church you go to that's your boldness come from what kind of clothes you're wearing does your boldness come by who your parents are and what businesses they own and what Society groups they're a part of I'll tell you what the Bible says our boldness comes by the blood see Paul said in Hebrews 10 19 having therefore Brethren boldness somebody say boldness what did he say boldness to enter into the holies amen of holies by the blood of Jesus then what does access mean it means to enter into something it means to approach something it means to become a part of something then by the blood this morning we have a right to go into the holiest of holies and by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us amen through the veil that is to say his flesh now look at this word boldness it is a freedom in speaking it is an unreservedness in speech amen is free and fearless confidence it is a cheerful courage it is an assurance I love what Barham says he said we was Redeemed by the blood of God and now that blood cell that's what gives us boldness to stand on his word listen amen if you're if you're a coward this morning then the first question I'm going to ask you is by what Authority Are you standing if you're afraid to speak the word over the conditions of your life then by what Authority Are you standing by amen if you're standing by your first blood then you'll be a yalabat coward if you're standing by your first Blood you'll be asleep in church you'll be waiting on the preacher to close you'll be waiting to get out of here but if you're standing by the blood of almighty God then that blood has released the boldness upon you I'm on Church you say mother I'd say Amen but I'm afraid the devil will condemn me well the blood condemned the condemnery brother Andrew I'd worship but I'm gonna tell you this much you don't know my pastor you don't know what I've been involved here you don't know the place I've been I didn't ask you your past I didn't ask you what you've been involved in I told you there's a blood for you there's a blood this morning and that blood is a creative blood it is an authoritative blood it is a blood that releases a boldness to stand upon his word he said that's what gives us boldness Amen to walk in the face of demons and opposition because we know we're coming covered with the blood of the Lord Jesus which is in the Divine powers in the blood of the Lord Jesus I'm not preaching to you by what I've done and who I am and how much I know I'm preaching to you by the blood I'm on Church let's just go ahead and kick that devil out of here these musicians they're not up here playing because they got fancy talents they're up here playing because they're covered by The Blood Brother Don he's not preaching to you because of who he is and what position he holds he's preaching to you because he's covered by the blood if I was standing here this morning by the blood of my first birth I would be of all men most miserable I would be a weak and Confused preacher but because Hallelujah because brother Jim I'm under the blood I've got an authority this morning just stand right here and say Satan take your hands off of God's Property buy the blood I've got an authority to say house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus buy the blood I've got enough fire to lay my hands upon the sick and watch him recover the boldness is coming by the blood I'm on Church you say Melinda I wish I could rise above it you can I wish I could get above this condemnation you can I wish I could get above this Guild you can I wish I could get above my first birth you can remember you don't know my situation you think a prophet of God sat down in 1964 in the month of July and counseled with a lady named Georgia Bruce based upon the blood of Charles and Ella Branham come on now y'all know that I remember said my parents charged he said I was born to Branham born of a natural birth born of a sexual blood and God would raise that man up to go around the world seven times challenging devils witch doctors I'm on now you know it's the truth challenge in all kinds of spirits but he was standing there Brother Mac not with a confused look but with a boldness come on he said listen he said when God anoint you you're not made out of running material he said you're not anointed off the Rock Amen of Gibraltar you're anointed off the Rock of Ages then a prophet could stand there brother Jack night after night after night after night and face demons in opposition and criticism and false doctrines and spirits of intimidation and spiritual manipulation and never one time back up and say well we're going to close out tonight and come back and try again tomorrow night but he stood there night after night after night you know why because he was covered by the blood and brother John that same blood has been released upon the Church of the Living God I'm old Word Alive you ain't got to back up and say well maybe we'll try again Wednesday maybe we'll try again next Sunday maybe we'll try when we get in the new building I see her right here this morning there is a blood and that blood is kind of voice and it's a voice of authority back that they will offer your property you're covered by the blood [Applause] you got opposition but you got the blood you got demons against you but you got the blood I'm on Georgia Bruce I'm on Georgia Bruce if you stay in that condition you're going to live condemned Lonnie I thought about something the other day you imagine Georgia Bruce amen sitting there in the masterpiece before that private interview you imagine her sitting there brother Jackie imagine if she would have went in there sat down in that meeting without having that private interview and all the condemnation and all the pressure and all the guilt hanging over but God allowed a prophet to catch her before the service and record it on a tape and send it around the world and here's what he says he said Sister Jordan don't sister Georgia don't look at yourself sister Bruce don't look at yourself I'm fixing to pray for you I'm not worthy of that I think what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here now what would he do if he was sitting here he would lay his hands upon you and with his great face see you'd get well well I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him I'm on church amen I come to represent him watch his language change brother Keith but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not not a sinner well I'm about to shout all by myself you just sit there and watch me remember before God I'm not a sinner listen he didn't just leave it on a prophet he said and neither are you before God I'm not a sinner and neither are you come on Church some of y'all sitting here this morning under Bill gaither's mentality I'm just an old sinner saved by grace that's a good song to a Baptist but to the Bride of Jesus Christ before you as a sinner you as a son and daughter of God before you was trapped in humanity your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life a known church I'm not preaching to a church full of Sinners I'm preaching to some redeemed Holy Ghost Field fire baptized Sanctified by the blood Sons and Daughters of the Living God rise up out of that Center mentality rise up out of your past rise up out of that condemnation rise up out of that guilt I'm not a sinner and neither are you [Applause] I'm not a sinner and neither are you you got a Right To Worship You Gotta right to praise you got a right to believe you gotta right to put your foot up on the head of that devil I'm not a sinner and neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood he hears our voice but he sees the blood he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us oh God it's Christ talking through us to God then a prophet has just told you your voice has become the blood by the word I'm on church and the blood don't say I'm serpent seed and the blood don't say I guess it's going to fall apart and the blood don't say I'm never going to make it but the blood quotes the word and the word said greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world and the word and the blood and the family of God is all joined together under the authority of the token that's somebody Rejoice I'm about to explode in here are you hearing me he's not hearing your voice he's hearing the blood when you petition God he's not hearing the voice of David hair he's hearing the voice of his own son through the blood come on Church you're not under Abel's blood come on brother John I'm about to preach myself happy you're not under Abel's blood there's a difference in Abel's blood and the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Abel cried come on the blood of Abel cried and the father God said when it was crying you couldn't understand what was being said and there was nothing in the blood of Abel to cover those sins he said but according to Hebrews 12 through Jesus Christ who is the Covenant of a New Covenant who is the mediator he said the blood don't cry the blood speaks the blood don't cry the blood speaks there is a difference in crying and speaking cried you can't understand what's being said cried you cannot articulate sounds but when something speaks when something speaks it is an articulate sound oh God I feel like shouting right now it is a clear sound it is a punctual sound and this morning church the blood is not crying over you the blood is speaking over you and you know what the blood's saying you've never even done it in the first place you know what the blood is saying your old man is dead and you can marry this new anointed where you know what the blood is saying your sins are in the sea of forgetfulness your iniquities I remember no more there's a blood it's a powerful blood it's a Holy Blood it's a perfect blood it's a creative blood [Applause] brother Michael by that blood I say I'm not a sinner and neither are you what are you saying I'm saying when a prophet told George Bruce your mistakes are not looked at and neither are they lauded to you sure I'm on now Brother David you imagine you imagine Georgia Bruce in that service Brother JD I bet she'd give the deacons a job that night I bet she I bet I bet the deacons had her hand their hands full of trying to control that woman because she has just heard the voice so they sent a man and it spoke to her through the blood and said Georgia you're not a sinner and neither am I and she comes into a meeting and here's a prophet preached the Masterpiece and goes all the way back to Eden and says she was smart and it was a fallen Masterpiece but in the end time through the restoration of the Plan of Redemption by the blood I will present what was in the alpha will be in the Omega brother hold Georgia Bruce now men I pray you attract you know why because she caught more than a message she caught more than a sermon she called her Revelation by The Blood Brother Lily I'm not a sinner I'm not a sinner no more I'm a daughter of God listen I'm after a devil and you can sit there and watch me I'm gonna get him you need to quit letting these Services go by you you need to quit sitting back and let the devil say well someday somehow sometime you'll get good enough to become a part of this message I resent that devil in the name of Jesus Christ I charge that devil Satan take your hands off of God's Property I loosen by the blood it's a Holy Blood I'm on Church anybody gonna ride Johnson City to dance in the spirits and the shout is the bride the blood has released you what are you saying preacher I'm saying this access this access is not in the future it's right here this morning I'm on this access is not coming brother Donnie I know you've heard him say it someday somehow or sometime when brother Brown comes back he gonna set up a tent if God told me not long ago kind of funny he told me he said yeah he said you you young preachers All Fired Up preaching about this bride's Revival he said sad thing is you can't have Revival till brother Brown comes back to Tabernacle I said what you mean by that he said well he said according to brother Bradley's going to come back for Tabernacle and he's going to preach the seventh seal and open it I said funny thing to me yes sir is if he did come back he'd go the random Tabernacle and there wouldn't be nobody there because they turned into a museum well we might as well preach I'm not a I'm a preacher that's a devil from the pits of Hell to take the most powerful message that's ever hit the face of the Earth and lock it in a Creed of misunderstanding through a voice of a prophet but I say this morning the bride's Revival's not coming you're in the middle of the greatest Revival that is ever going to hit the face of the Earth this bride's Revival is not coming the seventh seal is open the blood is applied we're under the token it's the evening time and the third pull is in the bride that's a devil to put this in the future it's a Roman Catholicism spirit well we might as well preach hadn't we it's a Catholicism Spirit from the pits of hell and if you want to Pope over here why don't you go get the original one well it got caught there but I'll preach through it if you want a man over here go get your original but this bride is not under the headship of the finite mind of a man okay she is under the headship of the word the full word well that Devil's mad and I'm glad I said that Devil's mad and I'm glad this ain't in the past and it's not in the future it's in your present well someday somehow sometime if not now tell me when come on if not now tell me when well somebody brother Andrew brother Pete if not you then tell me who come on this is not in the future it's right here in Holiday Inn on a Sunday morning [Applause] the full word is walking the aisles of this building with a Pentecostal blessing listen when healing is supposed to be here it's now what about John when he says now we are the sons of God now I'll go I'll go a distance with you on that idea Robert Andrew you can't preach the present test now because the Bible says the Bible says we don't know what will be but we shall be like him well thank you you answered your question see I'm not educated I'm I'm just an old country boy from the hills of East Tennessee I'm not educated I don't know how to break this stuff down only thing I know how to say is what a prophet said and the prophet said we shall be like him then listen it's the devil come on church it's a devil to rob you of what's going on the present while looking at the future but the prophet said May the same anointing that brought down on Abraham drop in this building tonight and bring the people to a present knowledge that Jehovah of the Bible is in the midst of the church what are you saying I'm saying now somebody say now now Jesus Christ is here in the form of the Holy Ghost with all the Divine gifts in the body of Christ being made manifest men look back and see what God done look forward to what God's going to do he said well they do it they're looking back at Pentecost and they're looking forward to the Millennium he said but watch and they are ignoring this very being in the presence of his people making ready for that Millennium come on Church Luke 17 30 comes after the Son of God before the son of David and Son of Man returns in the age when the fullness of all things would come under a voice a restoration to prepare the people how about church they're looking for the Millennium and missing the preparation time oh the prophet the gun said right now is when he's preparing you for the millennium how can we break or can we preach this morning can we preach right now he's preparing you for the Millennium see oh my they ignore it it's just the nature of people to do that Satan gets among them to hide their eyes from the very thing that God has sent to them you go to church as much as you want to do whatever you wish to do but ignore the very things that God has sent to us what are you saying I'm saying this access can I have a few more minutes I'm saying this access I'm speaking of is a two-fold access it's an access amen where man wants to access God but at the same time God wants to access man see what the proud of God say he's pressing trying to get into you and to move you to move into you today now notice this look what David says look what David says in Psalm 65 4 he said blessed is the man whom now chooses and calls us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of my house even of thy Holy Temple there is a way then to approach all things and there's a way to approach god listen he says and we must find the way somebody say the way not a way but we must find the way to approach God see then Christ is not a way to approach God according to John 14 6 he said I am the way I am the life I am the truth and no man coming to the father but by me so what are you saying I'm saying it's not enough just to get in church hello now it's not enough just to get around the message we got an entire tape on in 1963 the token get under the token get beneath the token I'm on now you say what are you talking about brother said on the David Tolkien come into effect and Moses said go put the blood over the doors he said there were Jews downtown in the community stirring a pot of blood talking about how much they believed in Jehovah and ridiculing the token message he said see they had a knowledge of Jehovah but they were not displaying the revelation of Jehovah and there's an entire group of people glory to God might as well preach that now there's an entire group of people sitting around the ranks of this message right now saying well brother Andrew I'll tell you what we need we need emotion we need shouting we need worship we need praise and there's a whole other group it gets up and says well we don't need shouting we don't need praise we need the word we need we need intellectualism and then can I preach and then you get guys get up and say well you know what I'm gonna preach on I'm going to preach on emotionalism versus worked up or worked up emotionalism versus intellectualism well let me ask you something pray tell me where brother Brandon preached emotionalism versus into intellectualism I don't have a tape but I call that but I do have a tape called Christianity versus idolatry you know brother Brandon didn't make it a fight it's a bunch of intellectual backsling preachers that don't want to stand with a prophet that made it a fight they don't want no shouting they don't want no screaming they don't want no worship they don't want no messy births around the altar because they don't want to stay past two o'clock and praise somebody through the Holy Ghost amen but I tell you where that Doctrine comes from it comes from the pits of hell and there is no room in the Bride of Jesus Christ for intellectual conversions there is no room in the pride of Jesus Christ for a bunch of handshaking members we've had enough hybrid hot men amen aristocratic church members I'm ready to see some Messiahs I'm ready to see some young people on fire with the Holy Ghost I'm ready to see the word be preached and the authority back up that word I'm on Church don't you back up off of your praise don't you back off of your worship don't you back off the anointing for some cold formal intellectual backslid and refrigerating preacher well I gotta sort out this morning are you hearing me we're not coming anyway we're coming the way in the words of my good friend Ron Spencer refrigerated preachers produce ice cubes all right ice cubes and they don't like no fire you know why I would hug God when fire comes in the building fire melts through a rich Socratic identity fire melts their dignity fire melts oh oh they want somebody up in the pup head that they can bring somebody to church and he don't sweat he don't holler and he don't spit I tell you what they want they want a rich young ruler that can get up and say a few good points but listen good points ain't gonna put you in the Rapture but the power of the Holy Ghost coming in the church not by work to music not by emotion but by the preaching of the blood of Jesus Christ foreign I think that devil got out here it's not enough to get in church you better get in Christ it's not enough just to carry a spoken word book you better get into the influence of what a prophet said remember that and I'll tell you what we got to be careful we got to be careful we're just getting people to church we're getting the message remember said see he said we're not come together to talk about the message the message is Christ he is the word we are to get into it come on Sir where does the shout come from it comes from it comes from the word where does the worship come from the word see then we are to get underneath it we already get beneath it see then that's Divine instruction from the seventh angel get into Christ you say how do I get into Christ by one Spirit we're all baptized then how does Christ get into the church Abraham says it like this he says he's got a threefold purpose it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed right he says watch he said the first fold is he reveals himself the second fold he takes preeminence in the body by the revelation of himself and the third fold is he leads the bright Body by the preeminent revelation of himself back to a Garden of Eden condition come on church we are not waiting for Christ to take possession of this church he has taken possession of this church through the sounding of seven Thunders which was revealing the mind of Christ what are you saying I'm saying you are back in dominion and Authority by the blood saying you got to write this morning to speak the word and go forward I'm saying you got to write this morning to stay awake in church oh I know I never say well you know I just I just I just can't stay awake if anything is they don't sleep at a ball game and the funny thing is listen I'm preaching the funny thing is they don't sleep at Dollywood and the funny thing is they don't sleep at Disney but they come in the house of God and barely stay awake you know why because they've just been around the message but if you ever get in it if you ever get underneath it if you get off of a bunch of nonsense in the middle of the week and get your head in this message it wouldn't be a foreign language when brother Donnie quotes a quote well glory to God it's a truth anyhow come on Church there ought to be some connections we got we got the books and the tapes it shouldn't be Sinners saying well wow where did he get that wow who said that wow no there ought to be some connection you know why because we're not just around it it's not just a social Gathering we're under the influence of the Revelation the full word come on and it's changing us it's changes come on church it's changing the way we talk it's changing the way we preach it's changing the way we sing oh you know I'm telling you the truth get in the influence of UT one time it'll change the way you look you'll take blonde hair and paint it orange you'll take a button-down shirt off and put a UT Jersey on come on now come on you know I'm preaching to you I'm telling you the truth are you hearing me you'll get on the influence of it it'll change you it'll change the way you act well what about the revelation and the message I mean I think it's time it ought to change the way we dress I think high heels shoes and Bob's hair and painted faces ought to be out of the church I think boys wearing shorts ought to be out of the church listen I'm just preaching are you hearing me it's the word or it's nothing and I refuse to back off of the Revelation that is penetrated this generation to bring a change in our conduct to bring a change well we might as well preach you know what I think it's time to do I think it's time to bring some Holy Ghost Field and fire baptize foot stomping religion back in the house of God and put every devil under our feet by the authority of the word come on young ladies put that devil under your foot come on young boys put that devil under your come on preachers put that devil under your foot the revelation of the age has taken preeminence in your body what are you saying I'm saying and closing this morning you ain't got to back up you ain't got to turn around Christ by the revelation of his word coming from the spirit through the blood has taken possession what does revelation 3 20 say behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man knock If any man hear my voice and will open the door I will come into him and I will suffer them you know but them said he said that word sup means reveal he said I'll come in and I'll reveal myself that I'm the same yesterday today and forever and that revelation will put a people God just go and tell you which are it'll put a people in position that'll cause hell to tremble [Applause] are you hearing me it'll put a people in position that will cause hell to tremble you say but Andrew who is this that is knocking when somebody knocks are you hearing me when somebody knocks they're knocking trying to gain access when somebody knocks they're trying to gain access and the prop come on now the prophet said Christ was put out of his own church he said he was standing at the door of the church knocking trying to gain access to me he was trying to gain access Into the Heart of Fallen Humanity that's what a prophet said he said just think can I have a few minutes here and I'm closer y'all's pulling now so I'm gonna preach a few minutes I know some of y'all's already at Longhorn but we're going to finish this out just think this morning for the king of glory for The Great I Am for the one who is in the burning bush for the one who separated The Waters at the Red Sea for the one who spoke to Joshua and the son stood still for the one who formed the moon the stars got them in their sockets to shine for the one who said Lazarus come forth and a man dead four days in the grave come to life again for the one who in the lion stand with Daniel and protected him from the lines for the one who went in the fiery furnace with the three Hebrew children and fanned the fire from them for the one who stood and said I am the resurrection and I am the life and he that believeth in me though we were dead yet shall he live who shall we live with him believeth in me shall never die he stands at the door of Fallen Humanity knocking trying to gain access to the soul but we turn that great important person away you know why because lordship means ownership now you say what are you saying I'm saying he is the husbandman of the vine right I am the vine ye are the branches so the vine must have access to the branches but remember said like this he said it's the life of the vine manifesting itself through the branches can I read this quote I was studying last night and the Lord just Lord just opened this up to me I think it'll be special to you who is this that's performing these Miracles who's it that's doing these great works is the preacher it's Oral Roberts is it Billy Graham is it Jack Schuler William Branham whoever it may be they have nothing to do in it they are the instruments it's the Holy Spirit coming forth with the gospel and signs and wonders Miracles making ready a people and the air is charged with expectation with Believers expecting him to come and others are saying why these revivals why do we have it let's settle down to a church listen this quote I tell you it run through me why it's been said in the church right here that when we started to build a new church said we don't need Miracles we don't need these things anymore you want them going out in the field where they happen we don't need them here when Branham Tabernacle Stoops to that low place it sunk this church is founded upon the principles and the power and the Gospel of Jesus Christ are you ready for this and as long as this Tabernacle stands May the glorious holy spirit find access to souls to save and feel with the Holy Ghost and heal the sick to me it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and and forever what are you saying preacher I'm saying come on we're alive amen this church was founded upon Miracles and the word and the power that I defy any devil that says when you go in your new building there can't be Miracles there can't be so Satan that's a line devil from the pits of hell it's time to rise up and remember who you are a church where the Messiah rules a church where the word has feminence a church in position and Authority Under the spoken word which is the original seed to speak can I leave your face you're a church founded upon the word released by the blood saved through the death of Jesus Christ restored by the voice of Malachi 4. in position to speak in position to speak I mean those brother and preaches three messages called speak to the Rock then he preaches speak to the mountain then he preaches a sermon called why cry why the blood of Abel cries but the blood of Jesus the blood has put you in position to speak Moses you need water yes okay speak to the Rock Exodus 17 God told him to smile The Rock numbers 20 God told him to speak he smoked the rock the people stayed out of the land and God said Moses I never anointed you to Smite that rock the second time you broke the top but I didn't want you to speak then you go to Mark 11 and he says have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall nod unto this mountain our wink editor give it a thumbs up or kind of wait whosoever shall say in this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which you said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he noteth he said whatsoever he Winks at her you know just kind of slightly this brother don't know he's not asleep he shall have whatsoever he saith I'm gonna tell you what a prophet said you're a Christian you have a right to any Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for it's already yours it's already paid for you just have to believe it not imagine it but believe it and know that it's yours and you can possess it he knew Jesus what would happen before he could predict what would happen because he knowed it would happen and once every predicted come to pass now watch whatever God said whatever he said rather God honored whatever Jesus said God brought it to pass so he knowed his words were God's words and that same scripture huh comes right back into us Mark 11 is not just in a Bible this morning it's in the flesh speak to the Rock and God is the rock speak to the mountain and the mountain is the obstacle and before we can speak to the mountain we've got to be on speaking terms with the rock so it's good to know God get on speaking terms with him while there's nothing wrong on speaking terms means you're with you're with someone you are quite friendly with them and often talk to them and are acquainted with them and when you become Born Again a personality of God acquaintance comes into you and he knows goes from the ridiculous to the sublime what are you saying I'm saying Adam spoke to the Rock and The Rock was in Eden Noah spoke to the Rock Daniel spoke to the Rock Hebrew children spoke to the Rock Hagar spoke to the Rock Joshua spoke to the rock band barimea spoke to the Rock the woman at the whale spoke to the Rock Martha spoke to the Rock Jairus spoke to the Rock the disciples spoke to the Rock he said on the water that night because the rock walks on water can you speak to the Rock tonight are you on speaking terms with him that scripture is to return into you again listen friends it's time for the devil to take his hands off your vocal cords it's time to speak you've been anointed to let our musicians come this morning if you was under your sexual blood by your mother and father you have no authority to speak this morning you have every right to be scared to take God at his word you have every right to sit here afraid this morning if you're under that sexual blood but the sexual blood has been dismissed the spirit of God forgive me this morning the spirit of God see the revelation of Christ has taken possession in a body and put you in position to speak listen if I was the devil I'd fight you too if if I was the devil I'd do everything I could to stop you from getting the house of God brother Donnie if I said devil I'd do everything I could to stop you from preaching

some of y'all sitting right here this morning right now I need to speak and you're scared to death too you know why because that old Devil's telling you well you did this and you did that and you did this and you did that you went here and you looked at that and he was a part of this can I tell you what that devil is he's a bluff can I tell you what else that devil is he's defeated and I tell you what a prophet said he said Satan is defeated and he knows it Satan knows he's defeated and some of y'all are sitting right here now questioning whether you're a Victorious or not see it's the word it's the word you're not Victorious by your blood you're not Victorious by who your parents are you're Victorious by the word what if I told you this morning everything you had need of is right here

this building right now it's not me it's him it's not me it's his word see you're trying to work your way into it you're trying to get good enough and get in a better position to ask God for what you need but I tell you this morning you don't have to ask God you don't have to get good enough I'm not saying you have to ask God you don't have to get good enough to ask God you'll never get good

you need the Holy Ghost speak to the Rock whatever you need speak to the Rock he will bring forth his Waters that do you believe that what the church needs tonight is to get back on speaking terms with Iraq the Rock of Ages Christ Jesus God smitten Rock that's God's Rock it's the salvation of God that's still our commandment tonight whatever we have need of speak to the Rock use the name of the Rock and God will bring forth his Waters out of the rock I feel like I could run over 100 miles right now old brother I know that Schmidt rock is laying right here now don't Smite it anymore don't

to the rock you that are homeless then you're sick in your bodies that rock is right there in your living room that rock is right there in your bedroom you that's in the hospital listen that rock is right there I I'm going to say this one I believe that rock is right there in that building with brother Eugene this morning that rock is wherever the Sons and Daughters of God are and you've got to write this morning by the blood through the spirit to speak to that rock I challenge that devil right now of condemnation I bind that devil right now that says you can't speak I bind that devil that's trying to remind you right now of your past and remind us of what we used to be and I speak the word by the blood and say you're not a sinner and neither am I you got a right this morning it's your turn it's your turn Word of Life it's your turn to speak it's your turn young man it's your turn young lady Mama it's your turn Daddy it's your turn grandparents it's your turn it's your turn preachers it's your turn children now is your turn Moses spoke Israel spoke Joshua spoke Rahab spoke Martha spoke Lazarus spoke now it's your turn to speak do you need the Holy Ghost speak to that rock do you need healing speak to that rock almighty God in the name of Jesus Christ I raise up this rock out of History this morning I raised this rock up out of the pages of this Bible and out of the voice of the seventh angel I raised this rock up in this place as Jesus Christ and I present this rock to a perishing person I present this rock to a sick body I present this rock to a defeated mind I present this rock to a bound spirit I present this rock to a dying loved one I re I present this rock oh God I present it to an empty vessel I present it to a filthy vessel I present this rock Jesus Christ and I encourage them this morning I implore them by the blood Lord to look away from their symptoms to look away from their conditions to look away from their circumstances to look away from their besetting sins look away from their habits look away from their strongholds because if they can just get their eyes on the Rock and they can make eye contact with a rock they can make a step towards the rock they can speak to the Rock then that Rock will begin to speak back to them and as that rock begins to speak back it'll say go and sin no more it'll say you're made whole in the name of Jesus Christ it'll say you've never done it in the first place it'll say you're Justified and Sanctified that rock will speak better things that rock won't cry that rock won't matter words that rock won't muffle up a few things that rock will speak clearly that rock will speak with articulate sounds and this morning dear God if there be one here today that needs to speak to that rock and that old filthy Lucifer that old squatter that old devil has squatted upon the right to the Sons and Daughters of God this morning I by the word of almighty God serve eviction notice upon that devil and in the name of Jesus Christ I say Satan take your hands off of God's Property loose them and let them go loose their voice loose their emotions loose their Spirits lose their mind loose their body from the Affliction and let them get to the Rock in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ Satan Thou Art defeated and you know it take your leave Oh Glory to God hallelujah take your lead Satan the blood is against you we're not talking to you this morning we're not going to sit down and reason our way out of this situation with you we're going to speak with the blood speaks and the blood says we're saved the blood cells were Justified the blood says were Sanctified the blood says there's an atonement and a propitiation for our sins the blood says our past is in the sea of forgetfulness listen if you remember that this morning then it's on your own conscience if you try to hold somebody's past or their failures and their mistakes against them it's on you but I resent that judgmental devil I resent that Spirit of condemnation and I say let the blood speak for you quit trying to work it out quit getting all tore up and getting mad when somebody says something to you or they don't treat your eyes or they look at you different because of your past or the things you've been involved in listen you got a right to put a smile on your face you got a right to square your shoulders back you got better actor say God bless him listen I'm not speaking for myself the blood is speaking the blood is speaking the blood is articulating the blood is speaking in Freedom the blood is speaking of unreservedness in speech the blood speaks this morning it's a powerful blood it's an atollen blood it's a forgiving blood it's a bloody rock this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah oh wherever you are right now I want you to close your eyes and I want you to just raise your hand as I look across this congregation right now or some or some Sons and Daughters of God speaking of that Rock right now I speak by the word to the spirit and the blood there's some chains breaking right here this morning there's some devils that's held and bound and tormented and inferiority complexes and all kinds of spirits they're being pushed back this morning they're being pushed back this morning because the blood is speaking listen Andrew Glover don't have the microphone this morning the blood is speaking through this microphone the word is speaking over your family the blood is speaking this morning Hallelujah can you receive it can you accept a pardon offer can you accept that pardon offer can you let that thing go once and for all can you let it go this morning can you let it go to the sea of forgetfulness where it belongs can you rise in the pardon can you rise in the freedom of who you are can you receive this boldness this morning by the blood can you repent of that sin can you repent of that thing and let it go this morning listen he's here this morning he's moving all across this building and this altar is open today I believe the blood is in this building the Rock is in this building I challenge you I implore you don't you let some devil rob you of this moment don't you let some devil back you out of this presence you're in the presence of God by Divine promise you're in the presence of God and you've got access into this presence don't you let the devil rob you of what you need right now if you got to step out and say Satan you're trying to buy me right here but I'm walking up front and I'm putting my foot on that devil and I'm taking back my family I'm taking back my joy I'm taking back my healing I've come to do business with the rock this morning he's here he's here he's here speak to that Rock right now speak to that rock speak to him he'll free you right now in the name of Jesus Christ that's squatters he's come in and taken residency upon you but this morning that squatter don't have no right the squatter don't have no rights you know really this morning I was hearing someone talk about it the other day they said a squatter can come on a piece of property set up on that property and they can stay there for seven years and if they're not contested in seven years they've got squatters right so they legally can continue to exist on that property even though it's not theirs even though they don't have a title to it even though they don't have an abstract but they got what they call Squatters right but then you go read brother Branham and brother Brian says that Devil is a squatter you know what he says he says but he ain't got no rights then you know what fat does by the blood that gives me a right right here and holiday in this morning to contest the existence of that squatter
