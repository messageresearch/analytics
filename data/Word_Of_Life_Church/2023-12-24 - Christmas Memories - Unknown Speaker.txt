wonder about what it's going to be like when we gather there that day and all the singers that have been down Through the Ages that have used their talent for the Lord won't it be something and it won't be just a few specials it'll be special all the time I realize a lot of folks that don't believe in music in church they have a hard time going to heaven because John saw Harps up there and must have been singing and shouting and praising God and worshiping well we ain't going to work we're not going to argue we're not going to fuss which takes up a lot of our time in life so what are we going to do we're going to worship we're going to praise we're going to I Love The Way the prophet brought it and he said that heaven is a continuation of this same life there'll be avenu in that city parks Rivers streams that we will eat we will plant we will enjoy like it was supposed to been in the Garden of Eden in the beginning except this time there be no sin a't it wonderful what a promise God's given to us but Daryl's going to come and speak for us this morning how may come with a need in your heart open to receive something from the Lord let's just pray before he does and just ask the Lord to speak to us Heavenly Father we love you so much we know Lord it wasn't this time of the year that you actually came but it doesn't really matter to us if it had been January or April or whenever it was but you chose to come in springtime we know because that's when Lambs are born but this is the time that man has set aside to honor your birth we're so grateful father that we're not just worship Shing a baby and a Manger today but we are worshiping the deity that's inside of us and we are so grateful but we understand Lord God that the light of God has shined in this our day you've sent a star in the west to be able to draw the attention of your people back to you so it's not church anity it's not religion that we're interested in today it's a person would you come Lord just anoint with the Daryl father we pray that you'd be mindful of the needs of your children today some sick some physically Lord need and touch others mentally psychologically but whatever they are would you move for Lord we open our hearts to you today May our hearts be a Manger by which you can come and indwell in US Lord God in Jesus name sing that start let's just sing together as brother Daryl comes oh it's such an honor to be here today and it wonderful to be children of God and be able to Fellowship around his word let's sing this together brother Daryl prepares to come down from his glory think about what you're singing now ever story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in aaz thank you Lord to his own oh [Music] strange amen of Sorrows tears and [Music] I with all your hearts now oh how we love you Jesus how we love you Jesus [Music] him my my sun shine for my heart Hallelujah the [Music] great the great creator thank you Jesus my Savior [Music] [Music] and you know what to me makes that song so good it's not the tune but it's the fact that it's the truth it's not just a mythical song that someone imagined in their mind and wrote but it's the reality of what he done for us what a privilege it is this morning to be a part of the family of God Amen we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and we always count it an honor to be home and stand before you and certainly appreciate all that you've ever done for us and for our family may God richly bless you this season be our prayer if you have your Bibles this morning turn with us to the Book of Luke we've uh We've sung about it worshiped about it now we're going to talk about it just a little bit but Christmas amen hallelujah appreciate brother Donnie giving us the opportunity to stand before the people and we just trust to be a blessing to you just a simple little thought this morning it's really the it's really the only kind I I can bring but I trust it'll it'll speak to your heart Luke Chapter 2 we want to read now from verse 8 very familiar scripture to us all the Bible says this there were in that same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger so that he wouldn't looking for him in the Hilton or the Ritz or the cuz he wasn't there you'll find him lying in a manger and suddenly there was with an angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will towards men and it came to pass as the Angels were going away from them into the heaven that the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known to us aren't you glad he's made it known to us and they came with haste that's the way we need to be running they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a Manger just the way the angel said let us pray heavenly father thank you Lord for loving us we commit this congregation and oursel into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you you may be seated this morning you know we are indeed a privileged people to be alive this morning and to come to this church on the eve of Christmas gathering here with a group of believers who have a revelation of what Christmas really is and what it means to us you see Christmas to so many people means so many different things Christmas to some means Santa Claus and reindeer and elves to others its families and Gatherings and food and laughter to others it's a depressing time because of memories of better Christmases past or because they don't have the means to provide gifts for their family or for their friends but is that really all that Christmas is just a festive holiday just an event but you know I believe all real Christians know what the world has made Christmas isn't Christmas at all and the fact of all the eror the prophet said in everything there is about it there's something about it that the world tries to make it an exmas you know they try to take Christ out of the whole thing all right and we know that's true I was getting off a plane the other day when I was preaching up in Michigan as I pass the stus at the door she said happy holiday because to say Merry Christmas is Politically Incorrect but no matter what they tried to do to Christmas God still got a Christmas in in it somewhere hasn't he he sure has the prophets said he's got something about it the very names and thoughts of the birth of the Lord Jesus said oh the world puts a Santa Claus in this place sure the world has made it an exmas and a happy holiday but not the Christians to the Christian it's still a Christmas you see Christmas is not a celebration but it is and it should be a day of worship because we all know that Christ was not born in December Brother Don saying in this prayer but somewhere in April or May or something like that but the prophet said it this way he said what difference does it make see today we are even if they was doing it in July or in August or whenever it might be it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in us Christmas Is A Day to Remember to Remember what Christmas did for us and that's my message this morning for just a few minutes I want to speak to you on Christmas Memories last night we had my family it's Christmas and we gathered together over at CB's house and we took time we went around to each one and gave them an opportunity to tell their favorite Christmas memory and as people begin to talk we cried so and we laugh some because there's just something about remembering that it warms the heart you see as long as you remember that person's still in your heart and as long as you can remember of Christmas that memory it'll warm your heart and I say let this Christmas Eve this time to take some time to set aside to slip off somewhere and to remember Christmas Memories you say what should I remember remember a promise that God made us for he said in Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace we remember Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel right we remember the promise of numbers 24:17 I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not n th shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel Christmas Memories that first Christmas was the Fulfillment of the coming Messiah spoken by the prophets of God that first Christmas was the Fulfillment of their prophecy showing that what God spoke to them was the truth and in Matthew we find speaking of Joseph that while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and that shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us we remember the first Christmas This Morning When Heaven and Earth United in Flesh and Bones wrapped in a swaddl cloth and laid in a Manger you see Christmas gave us an everlasting sign we remember the humanity and the deity of Jesus for he was both all God and all man hallelujah what was it Christmas gave us an everlasting son Jehovah God became man the prophet said he took our stock and costed himself from God and become man there's the sign he was God and became man not rich man but a poor man this is the super sign you asked for a sign said God I'll give you an everlasting sign the prophet said he could have come otherwise as I've said but a baby why did he become a baby when that first little toothless mouth opened it it mouth in the manger on that first Christmas morning in his little manger crib and the first little yell that went from his voice that was God God crying Jehovah crying a man come from God who was a man every WI a man but he come to the world with nothing but still a man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a boy on the street he told like a man but yet he was Emmanuel Hallelujah this is the super sign God dwelling in the creation that he created let me say that again this is the super sign God dwelling in the creation that he created this shall be a sign unto you amen that first Christmas morning it was an eternal sign to the believer that God is with us the super sign do you see it this morning God made Manifest this Christmas Eve 2,000 years later that super sign is still being manifested hallelujah hallelujah God dwelling in the creation that he created God In the Flesh of his bride as we remember it's no longer Christ in a Manger but it's Christ in you amen hallelujah in the manger scene of Bethlehem of 20000 years ago is now being played out in 2023 In The Word of Life church amen as I heard brother Donnie say many many years ago way back in the 80s preaching a message on Christmas he said if I was going to put a major scene in my yard it wouldn't be Campbell and wise men he said I just go out there and lay down myself Hallelujah CU that's where Christ is today Hallelujah Christmas Memories remember that the wise men saw the star the star that balam prophesied would rise out of Jacob they knew the conditions was right for the star to appear brother benam said they were stargazers they constantly went around looking up I think we spend too much time looking down we spend too much time feeling down you said why do you say that because the Bible said when we see these things coming to pass lift up our heads for our Redemption draw now these wise men brought gifts to the young Tri Christ child for Jesus was 2y old when they found him in the house with Mary and the gifts that they brought for him was very appropriate for the gifts testified that the wise men had a revelation of who he was oh I'm so glad I've gathered here this morning with wise men and wise women who have a revelation [Applause] amen for the very gifts that they possessed testified of who he was and let me say this morning what we bring to this service testifies of what your Revelation is of him amen the Bible said when they came they opened from their Treasures in other words they gave him the best that they had they didn't give him a second hand but they gave him of their best and that's how we ought to come not just on Christmas Eve but into the house of God every service we should give him the best that we have the best amen the best Hallelujah the best praise not a secondhand praise not a half Abberly praise but everything that we have that when we leave these doors we can say this day this day I have given my all for Jesus Christ Hallelujah we ought to Give Him worship and praise not a secondhand praise but from the very depths of our heart it ought to be The Treasure of our hearts that we give to him this Christmas Eve what are you looking for wise men and Wise Women today still follow a star amen amen I saw one time someone was bashing the message on a on a chat and they said I'm so glad that I don't follow a dead man I couldn't take that I said are you serious did you really text that you mean you don't follow the teachings of Paul and Peter and John them guys have been dead for thousands of years and about the dumbest I ain't the sharpest knife in the drawer but that's dumb I'm so glad that we're with wise men and women today who still follow a star the seventh star that was in the right hand we have seen his star and where is it leading us this leading us to where the word is made flesh Christmas Memories we all have them a memory of a Christmas that we would say that was one of the best Christmases I ever had or a memory of a present that we received all of us has those kind of memories I remember as a boy when Christmas we were poor we didn't get a lot not a lot of presents and I was wanting the football and you know you just you only got about one good present you know it just and mom and dad gave me the present and I remember I was wanting a just a kid but I was wanting a football and I opened up the package and it was a box and I I can't even remember what was on the box but boy was I disappointed because I was thinking the present was a football but the outside of the box said something else and I guess this look of disappointment on my face God rested her soul I remember my mama looking at me she must have I didn't say anything but I just remember Mama looking at me she goes look in the box and when I open up the box it was a football amen it wasn't what the package looked like that made it so precious to me but what made it so precious to me was what was in it I just heard on the radio this week of a of a lady at Goodwill brought a vase it wasn't it wasn't even really a pretty vase but the colors of the vase kind of matched her rooms so she bought it at the Goodwill and she sold it I believe it was for over $140,000 yes sir that she got at Goodwill yes sir because it wasn't what the vase looked like that made it so valuable yeah but what made this vase so valuable was the name that was on the vessel right in the Civil War they placed this Soldier before a firing squad they going to execute him for leaving his post of Duty but this man had a friend and he went to Abraham Lincoln he said I know this man he's a good man he just got scared in battle and he ran said please don't take his life he's got a family and Abraham Lincoln just pulled out a piece of paper and wrote I Abraham Lincoln president of the United States pardons this man such a date and signed it have the man goes running to the to his friend who was to be executed and said look what I have for you and he grabbed a piece of paper and he looked at it and he said don't mock me don't make fun of me get out of my cell said if that was Abraham Lincoln it would be a presidential seal it would be White House stationary it's just a piece of paper had he refused to receive it yeah and they took the man and executed him and then they had a trial why was this man executed when the president of the United States had pardoned him and they came to this judgment that a person is only pardoned right if it's received that's right as a pardon you see he was only seeing the paper not the signature Christ like the Bible says he had no beauty that we should desire him but when you look in the package amen oh you find he was the gold of God he was the greatest carrot Diamond he was that pearl of great price not because of what he looked like but because of the name that the vessel revealed amen he was God's present to you God gave you a present and it came from his heart you see when God gave us Jesus Christ he gave us his very heart for Christ was the very Heart Of God revealed amen an appropriate gift an appropriate gift for a dying Humanity that's right God gave us life amen Christmas Memories remember that first Christmas that God showed us his love for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shall believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life 1 John 4:9 and this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God s his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him the love of God the prophet say how God unfolded himself and become a Christmas package and was laid on straw the first thing he had to press against his little head was straw and a dirty piece of swaddling cloth wrapped around him and the last thing he had was a thorn crown and a dirty rag wrapped over his eyes and hit on the head saying if you're a prophet tell us who hit you and then they tacked him to a cross love reaching out when his own children crying for his blood and he scream father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing right that's love you see the church don't want that they want Creed but we need love the church is dying by Creeds but it can only live by love amen because love is etern eternal life love overcomes all things love is the most powerful force there is that's right brother B said Satan is hate Satan is hate but God GL is love why do we give presents to each other at Christmas time why do we do that brother brandham explains it so well he said we're giving you a little present this morning because it's letting you know that one time God gave the greatest present that could ever be given to the human race his son and we have a poor way of expressing it and there's nothing that we can give that will compare to that but just as Mortals to one another we do that we give gifts in remembrance of what he gave us an appropriate gift that God the Creator could give to his creation would be a savior to save us from the condition we was in but said I wonder this morning as we're approaching Christmas now if we could take a moment on these things and remember Christmas Memories that first Christmas the Shepherds in their fields received a visitation from an angel that told them of his great gift that was given to the world and where they could find the place where the word was made flesh deity revealed in humanity there wasn't looking for him in Jerusalem they knew he would be found in Bethlehem the house of God's bread because you see he came to where his name was oh God what a revelation he came to where his name was what did Satan do in the first church age what did he do to try to shut the church down he took the name of Jesus away from the church and gave them titles come on somebody and for years they baptized and titles but what has God done for us in this end time he has restored to us the name there is power in the name of Jesus Hallelujah he comes to where his name is he come oh Hallelujah he comes to where his name is amen spend your time looking for him to where he's not but you'll find him to where his name is the Shepherds were told you'll find him in a Manger wrapped in swaddling cloth in Bethlehem and where do we find him today we find him where the word says He will be right amen where will we find him where his name is well Glory get too many amens out of that but that's all right we'll find him where the word says He will be where his name is amen the headship and the body has become one unit it's God manifested in his people that's the reason that the husband and wife is no longer Twain they're one God and his church is one Christ in you God's Great Revelation glory to God even bearing his name his name is Jesus the anointed the reason he is called Jesus he is the anointed and it's the anointed Body of Christ proving manifesting God just like that body did the same anointing that was upon the groom with the same name that same anointing is upon the bride who has been given the same name for all Hallelujah he said the prophet said she will be known as mistress Jesus Christ the family name of God in heaven and on Earth we baptize in that name we pray in that name we live in that name we sing in that name we preach in that name and we will Rapture in the name of Jesus and you'll find him today where his name is hallelujah oh my Hallelujah the package didn't look like much no beauty that we should desire him but the greatest thing that was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world God gave himself as a Christmas package it was an appropriate gift for dying humidity amen yes sir that first Christmas morning when Christ was born what was it God the Creator created a second Adam a virgin birth a perfect lamb who could take the curse off of Adam's race and free us from our sins the love of God that God had for Adam and his race how God unfolded himself and as a Christmas package Mary on that first Christmas morning took and wrapped that child in a swaddling cloth and lay in a Manger but I wonder if she really knew what all was in that Christmas package did she know that because of this Christmas package that the blood will see Hallelujah that may not mean so much to some people but when you've had a child that was blind and you got a promise in the word hallelujah that he come to Open the Eyes of the blind amen did she know that in this package that God wrapped had sent to Earth the blind would see the death will hear the dead will live again the L will leap the DB will speak the Praises of the lamb Mary did you really know as the song says that when you was kissing that little baby's cheek he was kissing the very face of God I wonder sometimes when we shake one another's hand do we really see who our brother is do we really see who our sister is you see those Jews didn't want to believe they were unbelievers they thought they were saved but God knew they needed a savior they were praying for a [Applause] warrior but God gave them a baby a savior he knew what they needed just like he knows what we need amen that was her Christmas present that's what you need today that's what I need today is a savior from my unbelief a savior from your unbelief we need a savior to save us from ourselves for our greatest enemy our greatest enemy is ourselves and God gave us a Christmas package to save us from ourselves thank you Lord you may not have a lot friends this Christmas some people judge a good Christmas by how much is given but you know as Humanity goes you may not have a lot you may not even get a lot this Christmas but I want you to know we have been given the greatest gift that could ever be given greatest a savior to save us from our sins God's great Christmas package was not placed under a tree but this great Christmas package God placed it on a tree the reason his present is not under the tree is because that's where you give your present to him amen the only appropriate gift that you can give God and that is yourself back to him right as you kneel at the true Christmas tree Calvary right and place yourself under under that tree Hallelujah there's only one gift we can give you we say it all the time what you going what you going to what you what you going to give them they've got everything but what did he want riches gold and silver and cattles on the hillside matter of fact when he was here the only thing he even asked the father for he walked everywhere he went but he never asked for a chariot he had one suit of clothes but he never even asked for a suit right he had no place to lay his hand but he never even asked for a Dwelling Place yes sir but the only thing he ever asked for oh God the only thing he ever asked for was our Fellowship he wanted to be one with youall the only thing you can give him this morning this Christmas Eve is to give yourself to God because God's already G you his gift and the only thing you owe back to God is yourself to him this Christmas take a moment to remember what he did for you receive this great gift the only true original Christmas package the prophet said Jesus Christ Our Lord for you see a pardon is only a pardon when it's received as a pardon he's given this great gift but each of us has got to receive the gift amen because you see Christmas is about giving and receive him and let us all receive this life that he's given to us yes sir Christmas Memories take a moment and remember what he did for you don't just get caught up in the commercialism and all that that goes with all that they try to promote but slip off somewhere to the side thank God for your Christmas presentence amen that he placed on a tree do you love him this morning let us stand you say that's not much but that's the package he came and died that we could live a very merry Christmas for my family to yours and let me say as the brothers are coming let the word that was formed in Mary yes sir be formed in you receive the real true and only Christmas package Jesus Christ amen may God richly bless you I'd like to share this with you I found this is just so good if there had been no Christmas where would we be but because there is a Christmas we can live through him if there was no Christmas then where would I be if God's Christmas present wasn't placed on a tree if there had been no Christmas there had been no guided star there had been no Angels announcing no wise men from afar if there had been no Christmas there had been no peace on Earth there' been no Shepherds coming to worship the Christ child's birth if there had been no Christmas what more can I say no hope for man no love today but there is a Christmas I know it's true it's not Christ in a Manger but it's Christ in you there is a Christmas God keeps his word I've seen his star his voice I've heard come see Jesus he's on the Earth today he is the truth the life and the way yes there is a Christmas

you're so glad that little receipt is inside there where you can take it back but he is the only Christmas package that I ever got that was everything I would ever need aren't you glad praise the Lord you need healing today it's in the package Deliverance salvation it's in the package whatever you need you need comfort today it's in the package I'm not sure still brother John that we really understand what it meant to him to come to the Earth and have fellowship and Carol told me that the other day and I told her said you know it's astounding to me because the prophet said that the Lord Jesus did not want to leave his disciples can you imagine that what he was before where he came from what it was like and when he come down here and was able to have Fellowship like that for the very first time that way he was having a hard time to go back to Heaven you think you want fellowship with him that's only half the story he wants it with you so bad Hallelujah and he made a way so we could go back with him aren't you glad I'm so glad one day the spirit of God dealt with my heart your heart so we would be able to go up to the tree didn't have balls hanging on it rope or any that sort of thing it was a man hanging on it his eyes were nearly swell shut his lips swollen his head swollen because of the crown of Victor Thorns that they call it 6 to9 Ines long stuck in his head and there was God's great Christmas gift even before he took his last breath he was giving out the contents father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing and the thief you imagine you and I wouldn't even consider what he said a prayer of repentance as a matter of fact he didn't even say I'm sorry one time he didn't mention the word forgive me one time but he said remember me remember me sir and the Lord Jesus just opened up his package heart and just gave him the greatest gift he could ever get today you will be with me in Paradise oh thank God I don't mind telling you we've uh we've been having some pretty painful Christmas Memories in the last week or so we'll have some more tomorrow and the next day I'm sure I told brother Ron Spencer the other day I'll kind of be glad when Christmas is gone Erica loved the holidays so much she loved to spending time with her family ain't going to be the same but yet how grateful I am for the Christmas package that she received one day oh yeah you see most of you that knew her you knew her after we came here I'm telling you that was a mean little young one sometimes I won't tell you which one one of her daughters got that but what the Lord did for her and how he changed her and she received this Christmas package the Lord Jesus and by that she was able when it come her time to go go across that River and step on to the other side many of you probably know Sister suim's also pass this week and what a lovely lovely Christian lady she was we're certainly going to miss her we certainly desire the prayers also for their family that God would just be with them brother Calvin Ward pass of course week before last and remember them during the holidays it can be a a difficult time but won't it be a time when we all gather to the together there there be no more sorrow no more pain no sickness let's just bow our heads together did you enjoy the service today the word thank you brother B amen Heavenly Father we thank you for the service today thank you for your servant thank you Lord for him getting out of the way and Lord submitting his gift to be able to bring to us what he felt on his heart was beneficial for us we thank you Lord our hearts go back and our minds to that time when you came to the Earth and if it hadn't been for that that we would not be here today we were Gentiles so we had no hope no mercy but you wrapped your heart your mercy your goodness your kindness your forgiveness your healing your deliverance you wrapped all of that and a package of humanity and the package had to be tore open someone could give us a gift and we could just take the package and just adore the package and AD door the wrapping and all of that and would never know what was on the inside so you let him be tore ripped and beaten and whipped so that the inside will be able to bleed out we're so thankful for it today Lord we never want to let it become so common to us we know that you didn't know it to us you gave it to us we're thankful father I pray that you go with with the people now Lord Jesus may we as brother Daryl has said search in our mind and spend a little time with you and thankful for the real Christmas package maybe some won't get much from Christmas this year maybe they've had a hard time financially and they won't get very much but Lord we realize it's not just that that we get from one
