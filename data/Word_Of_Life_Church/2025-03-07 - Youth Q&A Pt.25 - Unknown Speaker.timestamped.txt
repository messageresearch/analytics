[14:49] they don't know he's awesome all they
[14:51] know him is just in a church membership

[15:15] tonight dear God that we have been able
[15:18] to experience and know that you are an
[15:21] awesome mighty God we thank you Lord
[15:25] Jesus it it's not just something that we
[15:27] read out of the old Testament or read
[15:30] out of the new or even read in the time
[15:33] when your Prophet was here on the earth
[15:36] Lord God we can look around and see and
[15:39] know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you
[15:42] have moved Among Us I wonder sometimes
[15:45] if these young people Lord here at the
[15:47] church realize how blessed they are they
[15:50] have seen things with their eyes that
[15:53] people many people down Through the Ages
[15:57] have never seen right here in our church
[16:00] we've seen the dead raised we've seen
[16:03] cancer healed we've seen one thing after
[16:07] another after another lives changed by
[16:10] the power of God we are so blessed
[16:13] father and we don't want to just receive
[16:15] it from you and not let you know how
[16:18] much we appreciate it we are so grateful
[16:21] and so thankful as we've come tonight
[16:23] Lord that we could be enlightened a
[16:27] little bit more of the day that we're

[16:40] tonight in the name of Jesus Amen praise
[16:44] the Lord so glad to see each one of you
[16:46] tonight thank you for coming out on this
[16:48] Thursday
[16:50] night U eventually I'm going to get done
[16:52] with this one question but until I feel
[16:55] like I've covered it all I we just keep
[16:57] going on is that okay okay can you
[17:00] explain why brother brandham is a
[17:01] Vindicated prophet and why the message
[17:03] is correct I have a difficult time
[17:06] speaking to why I believe what I believe
[17:10] you can you can be
[17:12] seated I want to say I was out in
[17:14] Arkansas this past week and and a
[17:16] brother come up to me after the service
[17:18] there he's one of the deacons of the
[17:20] church and he wanted to S and Sharon
[17:23] brother Rob he wanted to express how
[17:25] much he had been enjoying the question
[17:27] and answers so maybe some of you would
[17:29] have a question on your heart and you
[17:31] wouldn't understand something and you
[17:33] might think man I I hate to ask that I
[17:35] don't want people to think west of me or
[17:37] something if I do it but it's amazing by
[17:40] your questions and things that you have
[17:42] asked how many people have been blessed
[17:45] by it and I'm grateful for that I'm
[17:47] grateful that we're we we have enough in
[17:50] our hearts to be able to understand that
[17:52] God is Supernatural but there's also an
[17:54] element of our humanity and I want you
[17:56] to know I'm not going to shame you
[17:58] because you need to understand more or
[18:00] you want to know more that's one of the
[18:02] things that we learn about as I've been
[18:04] studying on these questions I've just
[18:07] been amazed at how much more that I have
[18:09] found myself now the last time that we
[18:12] dealt with this I closed in Deuteronomy
[18:14] 131 and this is where I'd like to open
[18:17] up again tonight and it's quite
[18:18] astounding really whenever you look at
[18:20] it because people of this modern day
[18:23] don't have this concept about God and
[18:26] the way that God works and because
[18:28] mindset is that God basically has to
[18:31] Baby his people and God cannot treat
[18:34] them like mature Sons and Daughters of
[18:36] God so God has to keep all the bad away
[18:39] from them all the wrong away from them
[18:41] God's never going to allow them to be
[18:42] tested God is certainly not going to
[18:45] test them himself but we happen to know
[18:48] that that's totally different
[18:49] Deuteronomy
[18:51] 13:1 if there arise among you a prophet
[18:54] or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a
[18:58] sign or a
[19:01] wonder and the sign or the Wonder come
[19:04] to pass whereof he spake unto thee
[19:09] saying let us go after other gods now
[19:13] what's amazing is that a man could
[19:15] actually give a sign or wonder or even
[19:18] have a spiritual dream or see a vision
[19:20] and it could be genuine and true so you
[19:24] wouldn't just know a prophet because the
[19:27] dream was true or because the vision was
[19:30] true but what you would do is see after
[19:34] that man gives the dream or the vision
[19:37] then what is he trying to get you and I
[19:40] to follow because those things are given
[19:43] as signs so brother Bram likened it to
[19:46] bait on a hook and when you're going
[19:49] fishing that you don't show the fish the
[19:51] hook but you show it the bait notice
[19:54] Moses goes on to say in verse 13 Thou
[19:56] shalt not hearken to the words of that
[20:01] Prophet now notice here here actually
[20:04] calls these people prophets or that
[20:07] dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God
[20:11] proveth you you mean God would actually
[20:15] do that God would let people raise up
[20:19] down Through the Ages and he would let
[20:21] them do that yes it's apparent that he's
[20:24] done it over and over again to know
[20:27] whether you love the Lord your God with
[20:30] all your heart and with with all your
[20:33] soul so we're not only going to be
[20:36] tempted by worldly things out here on
[20:38] the world and we tend to categorize
[20:41] worldliness as drinking smoking and all
[20:43] the wrong kind of dress your sisters
[20:45] cutting your hair uh your brothers doing
[20:47] things or saying things that you
[20:49] shouldn't do and people think that is
[20:51] worldliness but actually worldliness
[20:53] contains much more than that worldliness
[20:55] is actually unbelief there's only two
[20:57] aspects that's faith and unbelief so
[21:00] Satan will actually come against us in
[21:03] many ways other than just hair and dress
[21:06] and drinking and makeup and alcohol and
[21:09] drugs and so on and so on so this is
[21:12] actually what he used in the Garden of
[21:13] Eden to try to pull Eve away from the
[21:16] promise of God so he said you should
[21:18] walk after the Lord your God and fear
[21:21] Him and keep his Commandments and obey
[21:25] his voice and you shall serve him and
[21:28] clear unto him and that Prophet or that
[21:31] dreamer of Dreams shall be put to death
[21:36] now God was very very serious about this
[21:39] because Heath spoken now notice the
[21:42] prophets why they would do this because
[21:46] he has spoken to turn you away from the
[21:49] Lord your God which brought you out of
[21:52] the land of Egypt and redeemed you out
[21:55] of the house of bondage it's a Thrust
[21:58] thee out of the way so this is way we'll
[22:03] be able to judge and know a false
[22:05] prophet from a true one it's not always
[22:08] by signs it's not always by Miracles
[22:11] you've heard me share difference of
[22:13] things that I saw in Pentecost and the
[22:16] Miracles were genuine many of them were
[22:19] but yet you always wait and see but what
[22:22] he got to say what's the message that
[22:26] follows The Voice now watch in Genesis
[22:31] 15:1 this is why that we believe that a
[22:34] prophet is in a different category than
[22:37] even a pastor an evangelist a teacher an
[22:41] apostle which is one that goes forth and
[22:43] starts works for god notice how that the
[22:46] Bible says this about Abram and after
[22:49] these things the word of the Lord came
[22:54] unto
[22:55] Abram in a vision
[22:59] the word of the Lord came unto Abram in
[23:03] a vision so a prophet then wasn't
[23:06] somebody that just said uh you've got a
[23:08] sickness and you've got a trial and and
[23:11] you've got a burden and you're going
[23:12] through this and that and the other they
[23:14] they would say those things but God's
[23:16] main channel for his word was prophets
[23:21] so to us that's not unusual and strange
[23:24] then to believe that God would use a
[23:27] prophet in our day anybody have an idea
[23:29] tonight of how the what the number is
[23:33] current number as of
[23:36] 2024 of denominations in Christianity
[23:40] around the world anybody have an idea
[23:44] over
[23:49] 45,000 as of
[23:52] today
[23:56] 45,000 denominations and when brother
[23:59] random is here
[24:01] 900 so in this day of confusion now
[24:06] those denominations they don't agree
[24:09] right they don't agree if they all
[24:11] agreed there'd be no different and in
[24:14] just having a different name why be
[24:16] Baptist Methodist Church of God Church
[24:18] of Christ First Baptist Second Baptist
[24:20] 48th Baptist 153rd Baptist you know you
[24:23] follow me so if they all believe the
[24:25] same thing there would be no need for a
[24:28] differentiation just by name so why do
[24:31] we have all them different ones because
[24:33] they all disagree so they would split
[24:36] away from that one a lot of it of course
[24:39] we know in our day has been because of
[24:41] the gay move and the homosexual and all
[24:43] that sort of thing the Methodist are
[24:45] dividing the Baptists are dividing many
[24:47] of them are dividing and separating and
[24:49] even the churches are going more woke
[24:51] and that's what they want so that's
[24:53] that's exactly the reason that they're
[24:55] dividing and separating so you can
[24:57] imagine now in the early church age
[25:00] there was no
[25:03] denominations there weren't
[25:05] any in the first years when the
[25:09] apostolic church was founded in the book
[25:12] of Acts there were no
[25:15] denominations then as it began to go on
[25:17] in 325 ad at the council and sometime
[25:20] I'd like to take that for you and be
[25:22] able to break that down to help you see
[25:24] it but for 300 years there there was a
[25:28] truth that had come about still
[25:30] baptizing right and then in 3:25 ad
[25:33] whenever they meet together because the
[25:36] division started and it came from a man
[25:39] named
[25:40] aryion and it was about the godhead so
[25:43] there was a great doctrinal dispute
[25:46] about who Jesus really was was he God in
[25:50] essence or was he of the lower creation
[25:54] of God which is what many of them
[25:56] believed and then they had this great
[25:58] dissension so they wanted to meet so
[26:01] they came from Constantinople they came
[26:04] from the Mediterranean they came from
[26:06] the known world for now for about 300
[26:08] years Christianity had spread and they
[26:10] meet together and it was actually a
[26:13] great leader of Rome that had them
[26:15] together and said you all need to
[26:17] discuss this you need to resolve this so
[26:20] here come prophets and sages out of the
[26:22] Wilderness and said don't do this don't
[26:24] do this it's wrong it's wrong 325 D at
[26:29] the Nan Council was whenever they
[26:31] decided to do away with the name of the
[26:34] Lord Jesus Christ and water baptism and
[26:37] replace it with the titles of father son
[26:40] Holy Ghost but now God had already foran
[26:43] that and gave a prophet in the first
[26:47] church age which was Paul now think if
[26:51] God wanted to do that before there was
[26:53] ever any denominations at all wonder
[26:57] what God would send then in the last day
[27:01] knowing that there would be 45,000 by
[27:04] next week or maybe a few more so why
[27:07] would God send a prophet so that the
[27:11] word of the Lord could come to him well
[27:15] brother Donnie can't the word come to
[27:17] you no I'm not made that way can I have
[27:21] Impressions yes can I be inspired yes I
[27:25] can I can be inspired and God will give
[27:28] me things but I have to take my
[27:31] inspiration back to an absolute and
[27:35] check my inspiration to make sure that
[27:39] it's right why because Satan is a
[27:42] deceiver and he can easily trick people
[27:45] but now a prophet is made to where he
[27:48] can so get himself out of the way I
[27:51] can't do that or can any other preacher
[27:53] other than just a prophet now Abram it's
[27:57] not that he was a a special man but he
[27:59] was a man that God chose so notice after
[28:02] these things the word of the Lord came
[28:06] unto Abram in a vision now this was not
[28:11] Abraham feeling impressed and saying I
[28:14] feel led I feel led to do this I I feel
[28:18] led that um I I'm going to be God's
[28:21] chosen one no it's not impression it's
[28:24] not even feeling Leed and it's the same
[28:27] for us today today we will feel led to
[28:30] do a lot of things that are absolutely
[28:32] contrary to the word of God and that's
[28:35] why God gives us his word to where we
[28:37] can trace that back and say okay is
[28:40] there anything in the word that says I
[28:42] shouldn't do that and then if you look
[28:44] and you search and you can't find
[28:46] anything then God gives you a Shepherd a
[28:48] pastor then you go look you know brother
[28:50] Donnie you know please help me pray
[28:52] about this I'm thinking about doing this
[28:54] or that do you know anything in the
[28:56] scripture or do you know anything in the
[28:58] message why I should not do that now why
[29:00] does God do that for your double
[29:02] protection so that it'll keep you from
[29:04] making a mistake but even in that if you
[29:07] come to me it doesn't mean that I will
[29:10] always have the answer many times people
[29:12] come to me and they say you know you
[29:14] know this NOP I'm sorry I sure don't but
[29:17] I'll be praying with you I'll be praying
[29:19] with you but now if I was a prophet then
[29:22] a prophet would be able to get a word
[29:24] from the Lord it is so perfect and so so
[29:28] absolute that God will judge
[29:31] Nations by what them people them
[29:34] prophets got from God that's how perfect
[29:37] you understand so it's a different than
[29:39] an impression anybody here tonight be
[29:42] honest enough to say in your walk with
[29:44] God that you felt led to do certain
[29:47] things or feel you know just a a pull or
[29:51] something and it wound up being not the
[29:55] Lord yeah yeah yeah well all the rest of
[29:57] you just hang on you
[30:00] will now but a profit is made to where
[30:04] the word of the Lord can come to him in
[30:07] a vision now you know it's amazing
[30:10] because Joel 2 one of the Prophecies of
[30:12] the end time was that God would appear
[30:15] to people and he would actually cause
[30:18] young men to see visions and old men to
[30:22] dream dreams now I've never had too many
[30:24] spiritual dreams myself I've had Visions
[30:27] before I had one about a month and a
[30:29] half ago two months ago I saw two
[30:33] message preachers sitting at a table and
[30:37] they were actually talking about me and
[30:41] they were discussing me because they
[30:44] felt like I was wrong and some things I
[30:47] was preaching and I heard one of them
[30:50] preachers in this Vision I saw it and I
[30:53] heard him and I saw him say some certain
[30:57] things to this other man about me but
[31:01] was that the word of the Lord no can we
[31:04] base a Doctrine on that no so the word
[31:09] of the Lord that come to the prophets in
[31:11] this form of vision was somewhat
[31:14] different than that I know of different
[31:16] people in our church that has actually
[31:18] had visions and they might happen and
[31:21] they might not now you know brother
[31:24] random told us about seeing a vision
[31:26] that whenever a prophet would see a
[31:28] Vision that he might see a lamb in the
[31:31] vision and it might mean sheep or it
[31:35] might mean wool so in a vision a prophet
[31:40] unless God gives it to him clearly and
[31:43] the word of the Lord format that Prophet
[31:45] would have to wait for God to turn it
[31:48] around and reveal to him what it meant
[31:51] by symbols so now notice in this one it
[31:54] was not symbols that God was dealing
[31:57] with Abram but it was clearly the word
[31:59] of the Lord in a vision the word of the
[32:02] Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying
[32:06] so notice it wasn't a star and a bridge
[32:09] and a sheep and a book and and pews and
[32:13] this and that it was the word of the
[32:15] Lord
[32:16] infallibility now remember he tells us
[32:18] in the church age book that the power of
[32:21] infallibility would return in the last
[32:24] days but in what format pastors no
[32:29] evangelists no teachers no in the form
[32:33] of a god-sent prophet to whom the word
[32:35] of the Lord does that make sense to
[32:37] everybody that the word of the Lord
[32:38] would come now notice so the word of the
[32:40] Lord comes to Abram in a vision saying
[32:42] fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[32:46] exceeding great reward so this was not
[32:50] just not the spirit of God speaking to
[32:53] his Spirit or it was not him hearing a
[32:56] voice you know just like you and I would
[32:58] hear it was something even greater God
[33:02] is going to base his Covenant God is
[33:06] going to base millions of people's
[33:11] Destiny on this word God is going to
[33:14] base this is the foundation of the Jews
[33:18] the real Jews today still go back to
[33:22] this very word because to them it's the
[33:25] word of the Lord you understand now
[33:29] people can feel impressed and this is
[33:31] where brother brandom warned the
[33:34] Pentecostals and I saw it many many
[33:37] times myself when I I was in Pentecost
[33:40] and people would feel impressed brother
[33:42] I I I feel that that you're going
[33:45] through a hard time I could say that to
[33:47] probably everybody here tonight right
[33:49] you know and you say uh brother you're
[33:52] you're you you've got a I feel a back
[33:55] pain I feel a back pain yeah if You'
[33:57] anything today you probably got a few
[33:59] pains here or there but that's not what
[34:01] I'm talking about I'm talking about
[34:03] something that is absolutely perfectly
[34:08] infallible it does not miss so it's not
[34:11] guessing it's not mind over matter now
[34:15] watch in numbers 12: 6 and he said hear
[34:20] now my words if there be a prophet among
[34:24] you I the Lord will make myself known
[34:27] unto him in a vision and will speak to
[34:31] him in a dream so now here again God is
[34:35] giving in the book of numbers of course
[34:37] Moses again writing that it would be by
[34:40] this identification that we'd be able to
[34:42] know if a man was a prophet 2 Chronicles
[34:47] 3232 now the rest of the acts of
[34:51] Hezekiah and his goodness behold they
[34:55] are written in the
[34:58] vision of Isaiah the
[35:02] prophet the vision of Isaiah the prophet
[35:06] so the book of Isaiah I love the way the
[35:10] the author of Chronicles writes this and
[35:13] he actually calls it the vision of
[35:16] Isaiah yet in Isaiah is also chronology
[35:20] of the tribes and all different types of
[35:23] things but the author here of this chose
[35:26] to write this in this way in the vision
[35:29] of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos in
[35:32] the book of the kings of Judah and
[35:35] Israel now watch why this has such value
[35:39] to the people of the Old Testament and
[35:41] to us as well if we believe it Proverbs
[35:45] 29:18 where there is no
[35:49] vision the people perish now I find this
[35:54] amazing because you hear this scripture
[35:57] quot Ed so much in modernday
[36:01] Christendom but what they do is they
[36:03] take the scripture and Miss Supply it
[36:06] like that a church has to have a vision
[36:09] well we've got to have a vision of Word
[36:10] of Life Church and and I I want
[36:12] everybody to invite somebody to church
[36:14] on Sunday because we want our church to
[36:17] grow and then we're going to hand out
[36:18] tracks and we're going to have a a
[36:20] church ball team and then we're going to
[36:22] do this and that and the other and we're
[36:23] going to try to make our church grow cuz
[36:26] we have to have a vision without a
[36:28] vision the people
[36:29] perish that scripture is so
[36:33] misapplied it's pitiful because actually
[36:36] most of them don't even believe in the
[36:39] way this scripture is written but I'm
[36:41] going to read it to and I'm going to
[36:43] read you the meaning of the word where
[36:45] there is no
[36:48] vision the people
[36:51] perish look at the word
[36:54] Vision Vision in a
[36:58] static
[36:59] State
[37:01] Oracle
[37:03] prophecy
[37:05] Divine
[37:07] communication young people I want to ask
[37:09] you a question tonight where would we be
[37:13] had God not sent us a
[37:16] prophet if we had not received Divine
[37:21] communication from God in a vision the
[37:24] very say we're laughed about that people
[37:27] ridicule us and make fun of us until of
[37:32] course they come and hear us
[37:34] some so here a few weeks ago when we had
[37:37] sister tr's funeral there was a
[37:40] prominent
[37:41] businessman that came to the funeral
[37:44] service and he had heard things about us
[37:48] he knew our former church and where we
[37:50] were and all that had said some really
[37:53] bad bad things about us but he had had
[37:56] some dealing with us through the flood
[38:00] thing and he had told one of the
[38:02] brothers of our church that the Lord had
[38:05] rebuked
[38:07] him and told him that he should not
[38:11] think those things or say those things
[38:14] that he had said about our church so the
[38:17] man and his family came to Sister tr's
[38:21] funeral on his way out that door there
[38:25] he spoke to someone that he knew in our
[38:27] church and he said I've been in church
[38:29] all my life I have never in my entire
[38:33] life heard anything like that
[38:38] funeral so now what makes us different
[38:41] then every preacher is known for
[38:45] something you know one of the things I'm
[38:47] known for the way I preach funerals and
[38:49] you think dear God have mercy
[38:53] really wow that's really an
[38:55] identification is it not brother Daryl
[38:57] tells me all the time he said brother
[38:59] Donnie I wish I was up there in that box
[39:01] when you get done I wish I was dead
[39:02] going on to Heaven Ain't that really
[39:05] something to be known
[39:07] for but why what is it then that makes
[39:10] us different what makes our funerals
[39:13] what makes what what because we say it
[39:15] and the way we approach it and our
[39:17] preaching now that man may have never
[39:19] come to a service but he come to a
[39:21] funeral and he was somehow impacted CU
[39:25] he had never heard a funeral quite
[39:27] preach like that well is it because I'm
[39:29] such a great speaker you know better
[39:31] than that you know I'm not a great
[39:32] speaker I never finished high school
[39:35] much let preacher training preacher
[39:37] education huh I wouldn't even know where
[39:39] to start on such a thing but what is it
[39:42] oh he said brother Donnie so gifted it's
[39:44] not just about my gift it's where I feed
[39:48] from it's where I feed from what where
[39:52] do I feed from I'm feeding from an open
[39:56] vision that came through a prophet that
[40:00] gave to us Divine communication from the
[40:03] presence of God and I preach funerals in
[40:06] different states and different parts of
[40:08] the United States I preach them in
[40:10] military funerals I preached one several
[40:12] years ago of someone that was associated
[40:14] with our church that was a police
[40:16] officer I've never seen so many police
[40:19] cars state troopers constables sheriff's
[40:22] police it was absolutely unbelievable
[40:25] the amount of people that they came to
[40:27] the funeral the amount of police
[40:29] officers that was there they came to the
[40:31] gravide I've never seen such a gathering
[40:34] before I had the chief of police of
[40:37] Elizabeth also the sheriff of Washington
[40:40] County different ones come up and Sh
[40:42] hands me I've heard about you I'm going
[40:44] to come and hear you preach again I've
[40:46] never heard anything like that in my
[40:48] life now why cuz I'm a great preacher
[40:50] I'm not but it's where we feed from it's
[40:54] the Divine communication
[40:57] and as I stood there praying God please
[41:00] give me something and this police
[41:02] officer that had died every state
[41:05] trooper had a radio every Sheriff had a
[41:07] radio every cop had a radio and his last
[41:11] communication when he checked in he said
[41:14] so and so so and so and they told me
[41:16] when they was going to do it and they
[41:18] told me to pause every police officer it
[41:21] went off on his radio every Sheriff it
[41:24] went off on his radio and it was that
[41:26] man's voice voice which was now silenced
[41:30] in
[41:31] death and when that happened the Lord
[41:34] dropped something down inside my heart
[41:38] to speak to those men now where I
[41:41] wouldn't know that me Carol was talk
[41:43] about not Longo she said Donnie where
[41:45] would we be right now if it wasn't for
[41:48] the message I said probably still in
[41:49] Pentecost probably running here and
[41:51] running there and you know thinking was
[41:54] doing some great something from the Lord
[41:56] but why why do I preach different why
[41:58] why does brother Daryl preach different
[42:00] why does our message preachers different
[42:02] an open vision from God aren't you
[42:05] grateful aren't you grateful notice so
[42:09] where there is no vision the people
[42:13] perish this is why we were where we were
[42:16] this is why there's over
[42:19] 45,000
[42:21] denominations they're searching
[42:23] searching searching searching looking
[42:25] looking looking why they have no open
[42:28] Vision so they have somebody that
[42:30] differs with that church and then they
[42:32] split and they make another church and
[42:33] then they get three or four more
[42:34] churches and they say let's make an
[42:36] organization so they make an
[42:38] organization and then they go for a
[42:39] while and then somebody splits out that
[42:41] no we're breaking away from them they
[42:43] have no open Vision thank God for the
[42:46] truth but he that keepeth the law happy
[42:50] is he now look in Ezekiel
[42:54] 8:4 for behold the glory of the Lord
[42:57] Lord of Israel was there according to
[43:01] the vision that I saw in the plane now
[43:04] remember these prophets are going to say
[43:07] things that none of the rest of them had
[43:11] said before because God works in
[43:14] dispensation so you remember we still
[43:17] have a few out there but whenever Co and
[43:19] all that was going on and and I bought a
[43:22] bunch of the hand sanitizers and put
[43:24] them here and there and there so they
[43:26] were out alcohol dispensers and soap
[43:29] dispensers why so you could put your
[43:32] hands and I could under them and it
[43:36] would automatically
[43:38] dispense so much alcohol they come
[43:41] preset with so many milliters or
[43:43] whatever it is and you would put your
[43:45] hands there it's all you had to do you
[43:47] put your hands there battery's charged
[43:49] everything's working good it would
[43:51] dispense something in your hands you
[43:54] would be able to do this and you'd go in
[43:56] from that point on you bumped elbows or
[43:58] bumped fist you didn't touch nobody's
[44:00] hands because you had been
[44:03] washed by the dispenser right so what
[44:07] good would it do if all the dispensers
[44:09] were empty what good would it do if they
[44:11] was there but there was no soap or no
[44:14] alcohol in them to dispense so God
[44:17] dispensed his word the same way so in
[44:21] the days of Moses he gave a large
[44:23] dispensation first five books of the
[44:25] Bible the law the Torah then God would
[44:28] go for many years before another Prophet
[44:30] might come and say a few things and then
[44:32] on and on and on but they would prophesy
[44:36] and they would say similar things but
[44:38] yet sometimes one would say something
[44:41] that not another one would say for the
[44:44] rest of the entire
[44:46] scripture how can God trust that are
[44:50] there any perfect human beings that are
[44:53] so in contact with God that God could do
[44:55] that there aren't any
[44:57] so God makes these men so special that
[45:02] that power of
[45:03] infallibility can be projected through
[45:06] their lips now can you imagine a man
[45:09] saying one day a virgin shall conceive
[45:14] that was a very peculiar setting in the
[45:15] way that Isaiah prophesied about this so
[45:19] he's looking at the Su dial of
[45:23] ahaz and he said the Lord will give you
[45:26] a sign and all of a sudden he jumps
[45:31] ahead
[45:33] 714
[45:35] years and he says the Lord himself shall
[45:38] give you a sign a
[45:41] virgin shall
[45:44] conceive now you imagine what doctors
[45:46] would have said nurses Nurse
[45:49] Practitioners if they had them in that
[45:51] day you imagine what common just people
[45:55] with common sense
[45:57] would have said that man is out of his
[46:00] mind who heard of a virgin
[46:03] conceiving and this is the thing of it
[46:06] Ezekiel Never Said Amen to that that's
[46:09] right praise the Lord the Lord showed me
[46:11] the same thing Jeremiah never verified
[46:14] it Micah never verified it zachari
[46:18] Malachi Hagi naam Joel not another
[46:24] prophet of the Old Testament said a
[46:26] virgin shall conceive one
[46:29] man but Israel the real saints of God
[46:34] that believed that one man they held on
[46:37] to his word now you understand that same
[46:40] prophet Isaiah prophesied not only from
[46:44] chapter one on down to that chapter he
[46:46] didn't stop there he went on in chapter
[46:50] 65 and he prophesied of the
[46:54] Millennium now how can we have conf
[46:56] idence now in this day his prophecy was
[47:01] given almost
[47:05] 2800 years
[47:07] ago about the
[47:09] Millennium so now are we going to
[47:12] wait until the Millennium happens before
[47:15] we say all right Isaiah now I'll believe
[47:18] you when the Millennium happens we have
[47:22] confidence because we see other things
[47:26] that he said come to pass then we can
[47:28] say chapter 65 it'll come to pass too
[47:32] and chapter 66 which talks about the
[47:35] eighth day after the Millennium I'll
[47:37] just go ahead and tell you I'm resting
[47:39] on it aren't you I have confidence now
[47:42] you see for people who want to pick and
[47:44] sort and pick and sort well they said
[47:46] well it didn't come to Passion I ain't
[47:48] believing it you see God wrote it that
[47:51] way actually Ezekiel 44 through chapter
[47:55] 48 speaks again about the Millennium the
[47:59] Millennium Temple how the prince will
[48:01] enter into the Eastern side all those
[48:03] things none of those verses have yet
[48:06] come to pass the former sea the hinder
[48:09] sea Zechariah 14 the the mountain will
[48:11] be cleaved in half and the water will
[48:13] come out of that and it'll go to the
[48:15] Dead Sea it'll stream right down to the
[48:18] Dead Sea and the Dead Sea will come
[48:20] alive well are we going to wait and
[48:22] judge him he said no wait a minute wait
[48:24] a minute people want to pick on brother
[48:25] brandham and so this ain't come to pass
[48:28] and that ain't come to pass sure that's
[48:30] the way prophets do but it gives us
[48:34] confidence praise the Lord I saw a
[48:37] Pentecostal guy on
[48:39] YouTube some time back and he was
[48:42] sharing a lot of testimonies I think I
[48:45] sent it to you brother Rob and the man
[48:47] was sharing uh a lot of different
[48:49] testimonies he was not a message
[48:51] believer of things that he saw in
[48:54] brother ROM's Ministry and one of the
[48:56] ones I just thought was so outstanding
[48:58] was that his family his mother and
[49:00] father knew this certain woman and they
[49:03] had went to a meeting where brother
[49:04] brandham was and brother brandham called
[49:06] the woman out told her she was going
[49:09] through this that and the other and told
[49:11] her her
[49:12] address and his mother and father were
[49:15] there in the meeting and they knew where
[49:18] this sister lived and they knew that was
[49:22] not her
[49:24] address or so they thought
[49:28] so they went to her after church and
[49:30] said how you doing you know how you
[49:32] doing you know talk a little bit and
[49:33] said we we we just have to question you
[49:36] on this brother bam told you was that
[49:39] right about the sickness yes it was
[49:40] right praise the Lord it was right well
[49:43] we know that's not your address oh she
[49:46] said I hadn't told you all I just
[49:49] recently
[49:53] moved so what does that do for us Young
[49:56] people it gives us confidence you know
[49:59] and it's easy for lot of these people
[50:01] that want to criticize him now after
[50:03] he's done gone thank God for all those
[50:06] that have given us testimonies believe
[50:08] me I've been around many many people
[50:12] that were there as eyewitnesses people
[50:15] that were told all types of things these
[50:18] things are not made up and you remember
[50:21] when you're listening to brother brandom
[50:23] and he's calling them people out listen
[50:25] to their response yes yes amen praise
[50:28] the Lord praise the Lord you'll also
[50:30] hear sometimes I heard one the other day
[50:32] well that there was a preacher on the
[50:34] platform behind him brother random was
[50:36] calling somebody out telling them their
[50:38] sickness their disease and the man
[50:40] behind him on the platform said I
[50:42] brought her to church with me tonight
[50:44] that's the truth so there are witnesses
[50:47] by the hundreds of thousands that gives
[50:51] us confidence then that the things that
[50:54] he had to say there will be sharks
[50:57] swimming in California she will go under
[51:02] I don't care what they say it gives us
[51:04] confidence you understand now watch in
[51:08] Ezekiel again 11: 24 afterwards the
[51:12] spirit took me up and brought me in a
[51:16] vision by the spirit of God into
[51:22] Chala What A peculiar thing now remember
[51:26] prophet PHS they move in the realm of
[51:30] the fourth
[51:31] dimension so when God created the
[51:35] dimensions there was seven of them light
[51:39] matter time science where the unbeliever
[51:44] goes where the believer goes and where
[51:47] God
[51:48] is so all
[51:50] diseases began in the fourth dimension
[51:54] you can find this in the demonology part
[51:56] two if you like to look for it so in the
[51:59] beginning there were no diseases once
[52:02] Angels fell then they were still
[52:05] maintain their
[52:08] capability of being able to appear in
[52:11] time and appear in molecules and atoms
[52:16] even appear as angels of light God never
[52:20] created cancer God never created
[52:23] pneumonia God never created any of that
[52:27] where does cancer come from bruised cell
[52:30] brother called it a cell that backslides
[52:32] so A demon Spirit then will come and
[52:36] hijack the life in that cell and that
[52:40] cell then one of the difference that
[52:42] they found several several years ago is
[52:44] the trigger in most cells in our body
[52:47] they will duplicate replicate duplicate
[52:49] replicate and then they shut off but a
[52:51] cancer cell they've not so far been able
[52:54] to find that trigger inside that cell
[52:57] and they just keep growing growing
[52:58] growing growing until they explode and
[53:01] then overpower the rest of the cells in
[53:04] our body so a prophet in the fourth
[53:07] dimension it must have been a peculiar
[53:09] world you know to to live in in that
[53:12] world so here Ezekiel says he brought me
[53:14] in a vision by the spirit of God into
[53:18] Chala to them of the
[53:22] Captivity so by Vision a prophet could
[53:25] move back Wards he could move
[53:29] forwards and then he could also be in
[53:32] the present tense at the same time so
[53:35] something like this a a woman stands
[53:37] before brother brandham I see you with a
[53:41] yellow check of dress on I see you
[53:44] running coming home from
[53:46] school a dog gets behind you chases you
[53:50] up on the front porch and you you go
[53:53] through the screen door and it put a
[53:55] spirit of fear on you and it's haunted
[53:58] you all your life now what what happened
[54:02] so he went back in
[54:05] time and brought it right up to present
[54:08] tense in the fourth dimension because in
[54:11] the fourth dimension it's unlike what
[54:14] you and I can do we can't travel like
[54:16] that can you imagine being able to go to
[54:18] New Zealand in the fourth dimension I
[54:21] just think about it and be there praise
[54:22] the Lord one of these days that's the
[54:24] way we'll travel that's the way prophets
[54:26] was so Ezekiel by the spirit of God it
[54:30] was like he was
[54:31] transported into
[54:33] Chala and then another place he said
[54:36] that he was transported to the river of
[54:39] chibar they say wow how how did they do
[54:41] that so there wasn't hitchhiking in the
[54:43] fourth dimension and trying to find a
[54:45] fast horse in that Dimension they could
[54:48] travel that's why brother R would be
[54:50] able to be carried beyond the curtain of
[54:52] time Paul said I knew a man about 14
[54:54] years ago whether in the body out of the
[54:56] body I cannot tell but he said I knew
[54:59] such a man and he was carried Beyond you
[55:01] know of course what we know beyond the
[55:02] curtain of time into the third heavens
[55:04] and saw things and heard things that was
[55:07] unlawful for a man to utter my so
[55:11] prophets were able to move into that
[55:14] realm and see these things now watch
[55:16] Daniel Daniel chapter 2: 19 then was the
[55:22] secret revealed unto Daniel
[55:26] in a night
[55:28] vision then Daniel blessed the god of
[55:31] Heaven now remember the king had had a
[55:34] dream and he couldn't remember all of it
[55:37] yet it was weighing on him it was
[55:39] troubling him to death as we would say
[55:41] so he call for the susers you know and
[55:44] all those men that did all of that and
[55:47] they said look y'all I I've had this
[55:48] dream they said oh great King live
[55:50] forever tell us the dream he said well
[55:53] that's the problem you Knuckleheads I
[55:55] can't remember the dream
[55:56] but it's troubling me it's bothering me
[55:59] I want you all to tell me they said are
[56:01] you kidding us there's never been a king
[56:04] that's ever asked such a thing there's
[56:06] never been a king so all the Su said now
[56:09] what's what God's doing God's doing this
[56:12] to pull his Prophet away from being a
[56:15] susay
[56:17] identification now them susers they had
[56:19] to admit it well we can't do this we
[56:21] can't do it but Daniel Shadrach me check
[56:27] and a
[56:27] minuto they knew a living God and they
[56:30] said oh King live forever there is a God
[56:33] who can reveal it now watch So Daniel in
[56:37] a vision you know what Daniel sees he
[56:41] sees the King's
[56:44] dream so but the difference was he
[56:47] wasn't like this he was in a trance in a
[56:52] state of
[56:54] euphoria a static place oh what what a
[56:58] thing it must have been for these men
[57:00] when they were there in a
[57:02] wrapped condition r a p t which is a
[57:08] short word for what you're fixing to
[57:10] experience rap
[57:13] sure now watch So Daniel then sees there
[57:18] he is he said oh my Lord oh it's this
[57:22] it's this colossal
[57:25] image and and he sees the head of gold
[57:27] and he sees all of the image of the of
[57:30] the king there the man in in the in the
[57:32] vision was described by metallurgical
[57:36] elements so gold silver bronze brass and
[57:41] then the feet iron and clim mixed
[57:44] together so they go the next day and he
[57:46] said all right tell me of course the old
[57:49] s said well can we we don't know I mean
[57:53] we're we're we we belong to the Baptist
[57:55] Church but we don't know what to tell
[57:56] you we belong to the Methodist Church
[57:58] but we don't know what to tell you we
[58:00] belong to the Luc and the Church of God
[58:01] we don't know what to tell
[58:03] you but Daniel walked up and said oh
[58:06] great king there is a God hallelujah
[58:11] there is a God who can reveal the
[58:14] secrets of the hearts can you imagine
[58:16] what them susers and all the rest of
[58:19] them people must have thought when
[58:21] Daniel stand there and he says great
[58:23] king you saw this great colossal image
[58:27] the head was of gold and then he goes on
[58:30] down and as he's seeing it
[58:33] Nebuchadnezzar's face is lighting up
[58:34] like a Christmas tree he said that was
[58:36] it that's what I saw how did you know
[58:39] that he said the god of Heaven
[58:43] re the god of Heaven revealed to me the
[58:47] secret do you understand we are still
[58:51] living in that
[58:53] dream we're living right down at the
[58:56] feet and the toes to where the iron and
[59:00] the clay protestantism and all the rest
[59:02] of Catholicism and all that they tried
[59:05] to mold it together but it will not hold
[59:08] together it will break apart we're still
[59:10] living in that great thing notice again
[59:14] Daniel
[59:15] 8:16 let me go ahead and read verse 15
[59:18] and it came to pass when I even I Daniel
[59:23] had seen the vision and sought for the
[59:26] meaning then behold there stood before
[59:28] me as the
[59:30] appearance of a
[59:31] man now I don't mind telling you most of
[59:34] us are not
[59:36] made to deal in this Supernatural realm
[59:40] we're just not and it don't mean that
[59:41] we're not good Christians that don't
[59:43] mean that we don't love the Lord but
[59:44] we're just not called to deal with this
[59:47] there's special people that God has
[59:48] placed on the earth these prophets to
[59:50] walk in that realm to be honest with you
[59:52] I don't I I don't want to I don't want
[59:54] to be there anyway I'm not made up to
[59:56] deal with what what Supernatural things
[59:58] that I've seen has scared me to death
[1:00:00] and I don't believe God would press us
[1:00:02] beyond what that we're called to do but
[1:00:04] now listen what he what he experienced
[1:00:07] there stood before me as the appearance
[1:00:08] of a man and I heard a man's voice
[1:00:11] between the banks of
[1:00:14] Uli which called and said
[1:00:20] Gabriel make this man to understand the
[1:00:27] Vision so here was the angel
[1:00:32] Gabriel huh you wouldn't have to worry
[1:00:35] about me telling a visitation about
[1:00:36] Gabriel cuz I'd probably pass out I'm
[1:00:39] not made to deal with that neither are
[1:00:41] you all come on just accept it most of
[1:00:43] the preachers that we know in this
[1:00:45] message are not called they're not this
[1:00:48] caliber of men though many would love to
[1:00:50] be when God chooses men to deal with in
[1:00:54] this way they are set apart from
[1:00:57] everyone else and we cannot make ourself
[1:01:01] this only God can do this notice chapter
[1:01:06] 10:14 now I am come to make thee
[1:01:11] understand what shall befall thy people
[1:01:15] in the latter days for yet the vision is
[1:01:19] for many
[1:01:22] days you understand that the children of
[1:01:25] Israel are now walking in part of the
[1:01:28] vision of the Book of Daniel and part of
[1:01:31] it is yet to come part of it they lived
[1:01:34] out under Antiochus epiphanes Daniel saw
[1:01:38] a goat raise up and he had one horn then
[1:01:42] he saw a ram rais up with so many horns
[1:01:44] each one of them was a power and a King
[1:01:47] Antiochus epes was the one with the one
[1:01:50] horn nearly wiped them out but God would
[1:01:53] not let it happen what was it it wasn't
[1:01:55] a priest it wasn't a singer it wasn't a
[1:01:59] good person it had to be a man that was
[1:02:02] made in a certain way God couldn't risk
[1:02:05] it to a person who had a gift that had a
[1:02:09] margin of
[1:02:11] error now you see there are people that
[1:02:14] are gifted but their gift has a margin
[1:02:17] of error that's how it can hit and miss
[1:02:22] hit and miss hit
[1:02:26] and
[1:02:28] miss that ain't the way God is going to
[1:02:30] reveal his word it's got to be
[1:02:36] infallable praise
[1:02:39] God now notice Obadiah very very small
[1:02:43] book of the Old Testament the vision of
[1:02:48] Obadiah thus
[1:02:50] saith the Lord
[1:02:53] God concerning Edom
[1:02:56] now when these prophets would say this
[1:03:00] this is not actually a
[1:03:03] man just feeling impressed thus sayeth
[1:03:07] the Lord thus sayith the Lord it
[1:03:10] actually was the Lord I hope this don't
[1:03:14] stagger you but when Jesus was here they
[1:03:17] they they you know they constantly was
[1:03:19] picking him and he quoted them the word
[1:03:22] how can you condemn me when I say I am
[1:03:26] the Son of God when your own law says ye
[1:03:31] are
[1:03:34] Gods that's in your new testament for he
[1:03:37] said did not he call them Gods to whom
[1:03:41] the word of God came
[1:03:44] to now that was not all of Israel that
[1:03:47] was those chosen ones so is it in the
[1:03:51] message we've got great preachers in the
[1:03:53] message we've got some great event great
[1:03:56] pastors great teachers but we only
[1:03:59] needed one prophet of God of the caliber
[1:04:03] of Malachi 4 that's all you need is that
[1:04:07] right you only need one of that caliber
[1:04:11] cuz God can say everything with that
[1:04:14] prophetic gift then what are the pastor
[1:04:16] supposed to do study what that Prophet
[1:04:19] brought and stay with it evangelist
[1:04:22] teachers and so on now watch thus sayith
[1:04:26] the Lord God concerning Edom we have
[1:04:28] heard a rumor I've always thought this
[1:04:31] is so unusual we have heard a rumor from
[1:04:36] the
[1:04:37] Lord and an ambassador is sent among the
[1:04:41] Heathen arise ye and let us rise up
[1:04:46] against her in battle naom again one of
[1:04:51] the Minor Prophets as is called in the
[1:04:53] Old Testament the burden of of
[1:04:57] Nineveh the book of the vision of
[1:05:03] naom the
[1:05:05] aishite but now remember these prophets
[1:05:09] would sometimes only
[1:05:11] preach to the time frame in which they
[1:05:15] were in but then every now and then they
[1:05:20] would break Force the way naam did and
[1:05:24] God allowed naam to look into the city
[1:05:29] of
[1:05:31] Chicago and see the Outer Drive anybody
[1:05:34] ever been in the outo drive of
[1:05:37] Chicago and he looked and he saw it and
[1:05:41] he didn't know what to make of it and he
[1:05:42] said the Chariots was jostling against
[1:05:46] one
[1:05:47] another whe they didn't have Chryslers
[1:05:50] and Chevrolets and Fords and Dodges so I
[1:05:53] mean he he saw this in the vision and
[1:05:55] brother renam said that whenever the
[1:05:57] prophet looked there and saw it he saw
[1:06:00] the Outer Drive of Chicago and he didn't
[1:06:03] know what to call them so he called them
[1:06:05] chariots can you imagine that man
[1:06:08] looking at the Outer Drive of Chicago I
[1:06:11] mean it's it's quite it's quite an
[1:06:12] expressway and loops and ramps going
[1:06:15] just every different direction and him
[1:06:17] carried up this man was used to dirt
[1:06:19] roads this man was used to paths and
[1:06:23] people walking and all of a sudden he's
[1:06:25] mov mov D up into who knows what time it
[1:06:27] was 20th century centuries and centuries
[1:06:31] way on in the future and he looked there
[1:06:34] by vision and saw people blowing their
[1:06:36] horns and there was tractors and
[1:06:38] trailers and there was dump trucks and
[1:06:39] there was cars and there was volkswagons
[1:06:41] and Fords and Chevrolet and pickups and
[1:06:43] all this that and other and thinking
[1:06:45] Lord God what in the world what is all
[1:06:48] that what what was
[1:06:49] that so he just come back down out of
[1:06:52] the vision all he knew to do was just
[1:06:55] write it down you imagine people for
[1:06:58] hundreds of years picked up and read
[1:07:01] that chariots josing against one another
[1:07:05] they thought Jing against one another
[1:07:08] well they ain't but three people in our
[1:07:09] community that's even got it got a
[1:07:11] chariot and they they certainly ain't
[1:07:13] josing against one another that was a
[1:07:15] false prophet I'm going to go on YouTube
[1:07:18] and I'm going to make me a video and I'm
[1:07:20] going to say that that man said
[1:07:21] something that wasn't even
[1:07:23] right well they called him Cher charot
[1:07:25] said we call him a false prophet because
[1:07:27] he didn't call it
[1:07:31] Chevrolet as a joke it's okay you can
[1:07:33] smile a little bit thank you
[1:07:35] Maria now think how
[1:07:38] unusual that it
[1:07:40] was for these men habac 2:2 and the Lord
[1:07:45] answered me and said
[1:07:49] write the
[1:07:52] vision and make it plain upon tables
[1:07:56] that he may
[1:07:58] run that readeth it praise
[1:08:03] God for the vision is yet for an
[1:08:07] appointed time but at the
[1:08:11] end it shall speak and not lie though it
[1:08:17] t wait for it because it will surely
[1:08:23] come it will not
[1:08:27] Terry and the use of the Word of Life
[1:08:29] Church
[1:08:30] said
[1:08:32] amen now let's move from there to the
[1:08:34] New Testament did New Testament people
[1:08:38] also have
[1:08:40] visions Luke
[1:08:43] 1:22 now this is the father Zacharias of
[1:08:47] John the Baptist the angel of the Lord
[1:08:49] appeared unto him and told him him and
[1:08:53] his wife was going to have a child
[1:08:56] but she was past child birth she was uh
[1:09:00] several years old and according to the
[1:09:02] time of life it had already ceased with
[1:09:04] them so he doubted and questioned and
[1:09:09] the angel said because you have done
[1:09:12] this you will not be able to
[1:09:15] talk so for nine months you're going to
[1:09:19] lose your ability to speak because you
[1:09:22] have doubted what I had to say
[1:09:26] when he came out he could not speak unto
[1:09:29] them and they
[1:09:32] perceived he had seen a vision in the
[1:09:37] temple for he beckoned unto them and
[1:09:41] remained speechless so the New
[1:09:43] Testament Prophet John the Baptist was
[1:09:48] foretold by an angel of God coming in a
[1:09:53] format now remember this was not a
[1:09:55] Prophet who saw the vision it was a
[1:09:59] priest so the word of the Lord could not
[1:10:01] come to him in the same way that it did
[1:10:05] to a prophet so you can imagine that
[1:10:07] many wasn't a priest so he he sees this
[1:10:10] and there's the angel of God you don't
[1:10:12] know what to make of it Luke
[1:10:15] 2423 and when they found not his
[1:10:18] body they had that had also seen a
[1:10:23] vision of angels which said he was alive
[1:10:26] now here the Lord
[1:10:28] Jesus has raised from the dead and a
[1:10:32] vision of angels has appeared you mean
[1:10:36] people in the New Testament were seeing
[1:10:39] visions no wait a minute I thought after
[1:10:41] the cross we would do Visions no more
[1:10:45] well you know we've got the Bible and we
[1:10:46] don't need them well you see that's
[1:10:48] actually tradition it's not the
[1:10:50] scripture acts 9: 10 and there was a
[1:10:54] certain disciple at Damascus named
[1:11:00] ananas and to him said the Lord in a
[1:11:06] vision
[1:11:08] ananas and he said behold I am here Lord
[1:11:13] and the Lord said unto him
[1:11:15] arise and go into the street which is
[1:11:18] called
[1:11:20] straight and inquire in the house of
[1:11:23] Judas for one called Saul of tarus for
[1:11:29] he pray
[1:11:31] us and hath seen in a vision now I want
[1:11:35] you to notice now God dealing on both
[1:11:36] ends so ananas is seeing a vision and in
[1:11:41] the vision the Lord tells him I want you
[1:11:42] to go to this certain city I want you to
[1:11:44] go to this certain Street and then when
[1:11:47] you get there I want you to ask for a
[1:11:49] certain man you see how different this
[1:11:53] is than from a lot of the charismatics
[1:11:55] and stuff today well somebody here's got
[1:11:58] a burden and somebody's got a vision God
[1:12:00] can tell you the street the city the
[1:12:04] name the time the address praise the
[1:12:08] Lord a lot of discernments and things
[1:12:10] that are said today they're said in a
[1:12:13] very I hate to say it but they're said
[1:12:16] in a very deceitful way they're said
[1:12:20] that in a way that if it don't happen
[1:12:23] you won't be able to point your finger
[1:12:25] at the one who said it and if it does
[1:12:28] happen of course they're going to take
[1:12:29] credit and glory for it but a real one
[1:12:33] and they was already dealing with this
[1:12:35] when brother Brandon was here there was
[1:12:37] already people that was mimicking what
[1:12:40] he was doing and he rebuked it of course
[1:12:42] he said in face of the trumpets he said
[1:12:44] that sign of discernment he said not a
[1:12:46] dozen men but one man one man but you
[1:12:50] see after God sent that
[1:12:53] one impat
[1:13:07] well the devil sure didn't like me to
[1:13:09] did him with this part did he
[1:13:12] uhhuh now watch whenever brother Brandon
[1:13:15] was here all these impersonators started
[1:13:17] raising up I feel this and they would
[1:13:20] have oil and blood my my younger brother
[1:13:24] Jamie I love him with all of my heart
[1:13:26] but Jamie my younger brother I've seen
[1:13:29] oil drip from his
[1:13:33] hands he did not cause that to happen
[1:13:37] whenever we were praying for my mother
[1:13:39] dying with cancer and I seen it from
[1:13:42] both of Jim's hands and the oil it was
[1:13:46] as wet as if he would have dipped his
[1:13:48] hands down in uh some type of container
[1:13:52] and hold his hands and the oil would
[1:13:54] drip for him from his hands now remember
[1:13:57] that was one of the things going on when
[1:13:59] brother Brandon was here CU he said they
[1:14:01] got signs they got wonders they got all
[1:14:03] dripping I'm not saying that in a
[1:14:04] dragory way against Jamie because Jamie
[1:14:06] could not help it it just happened to
[1:14:08] him and I saw it with my own eyes praise
[1:14:12] the Lord now seeing that God was going
[1:14:18] to bring this to the New Testament
[1:14:21] Church and even though that have Bibles
[1:14:24] that have the church in order God was
[1:14:26] still using Visions so God then told
[1:14:31] ananas now this is what I want you to do
[1:14:33] and when you get there you're going to
[1:14:35] meet this man and I've already give him
[1:14:37] a vision too well wait a minute I
[1:14:39] thought Visions wouldn't even supposed
[1:14:40] to be in the new test oh but you see
[1:14:42] they are and have seen in a vision a man
[1:14:46] named
[1:14:48] ananas coming in that's my God and
[1:14:52] putting his hand on him that he might re
[1:14:55] receive his sight I imagine ananas
[1:14:59] needed this reality of God because this
[1:15:01] man was killing
[1:15:04] Christians now you imagine he needed
[1:15:06] this Vindication I would too wouldn't
[1:15:09] you chapter 11 of the book of Acts verse
[1:15:12] 5 and then we'll close I was in the city
[1:15:15] of japa
[1:15:17] praying and in a trance I saw a vision a
[1:15:23] certain vessel descend as it had been a
[1:15:27] great sheep now remember this is Simon
[1:15:29] Peter let down from heaven by four
[1:15:33] corners and it came even to me acts 16:9
[1:15:38] and a vision appeared to Paul in the
[1:15:41] night and there stood a man of
[1:15:46] Macedonia and prayed him saying come
[1:15:50] over into
[1:15:53] Macedonia and help us
[1:15:56] so do we believe in
[1:15:58] Visions are they new testament teaching
[1:16:02] I want your response back are Visions in
[1:16:05] the New Testament was it God that said
[1:16:09] there won't be no more Visions in the
[1:16:10] New Testament we see God doing the exact
[1:16:13] opposite let me read one more and
[1:16:15] actually had seen the vision immediately
[1:16:18] we endeavored to go into Macedonia
[1:16:20] assuredly Gathering that the Lord has
[1:16:23] called us for to preach the gospel unto
[1:16:27] them let's Stand
[1:16:29] Together praise the Lord thank you Lord
[1:16:33] Jesus how many here tonight believes
[1:16:36] that God still deals with his people in
[1:16:38] this way do you see young people why we
[1:16:42] needed a prophet of God that would come
[1:16:46] in this day and would not be able to
[1:16:49] just rally the people around him and
[1:16:51] have great healing campaigns well we'll
[1:16:54] get to it maybe maybe next time but one
[1:16:56] of the the signs for sure that Jesus
[1:17:00] gave us and the scripture by which we
[1:17:04] would be able to know the difference
[1:17:06] between a true prophet and a false one
[1:17:09] is a false prophet will always try to
[1:17:15] broaden the narrow paths a false prophet
[1:17:19] will come by deceptive means means that
[1:17:23] will try to draw all the people after
[1:17:26] him he will soften the gospel make the
[1:17:30] gospel easier Jesus warned us that there
[1:17:33] would be false prophets that would come
[1:17:36] and they would be dressed in sheep's
[1:17:38] clothing but he said that inside they
[1:17:41] would be ravening wolves ravening
[1:17:46] tearing ripping dividing pulling
[1:17:50] aunder but a true prophet of God will
[1:17:53] tell the truth
[1:17:55] if his friends forsake Him He will not
[1:17:58] preach for money fame or Fortune truly
[1:18:03] that's the kind of prophet that God has
[1:18:05] sent us in this last day can you imagine
[1:18:08] them bringing brother brandom a check
[1:18:10] over a million
[1:18:13] dollars escorting
[1:18:16] it and bringing it to him and he turned
[1:18:19] it
[1:18:20] down how many preachers in this message
[1:18:24] would do that
[1:18:26] today a man that the denomination said
[1:18:29] brother brandom if you will back off of
[1:18:32] serpent seed water baptism there's not
[1:18:36] another gift on the field that can touch
[1:18:39] yours if you will back off from some of
[1:18:41] these things our brothers will get
[1:18:44] behind you it'll go around the
[1:18:47] world you imagine as a man brother Rob
[1:18:50] that he looked at it and thought Lord is
[1:18:52] this what I need to do should I do this
[1:18:55] but aren't you glad he didn't he would
[1:18:58] have had to compromise on serpent seed
[1:19:01] then that had another list now you got
[1:19:03] to compromise on women preachers and you
[1:19:05] got to compromise on this and you got to
[1:19:07] compromise on that and do you honestly
[1:19:10] believe that sign that presence of God
[1:19:13] would have ever worked the same it would
[1:19:15] not have worked the same oh he still had
[1:19:17] it sure God gives gessi and an indan
[1:19:20] giver but I'm so grateful that we had a
[1:19:23] man that was willing to take the way of
[1:19:26] the Lord's despised few I'm grateful God
[1:19:30] still got men tonight that's doing
[1:19:31] exactly the same thing let's bow our
[1:19:34] heads together if you
[1:19:37] would Heavenly
[1:19:39] Father we consider
[1:19:42] ourselves such a blessed
[1:19:45] people to be able to set under the
[1:19:48] opes of the reveal word of this
[1:19:52] hour oh my father how
[1:19:55] we would have set in the days of Paul
[1:19:58] and if we'd been privileged to be at
[1:20:01] Corinth or Ephesus or any of the other
[1:20:04] places that he made his missionary
[1:20:06] Journeys and heard him
[1:20:09] taught we would have been the first
[1:20:11] century Christians and we would have
[1:20:13] heard Peter give his his experiences
[1:20:16] with the Lord Jesus or John oh Father
[1:20:20] how blessed we would have been in that
[1:20:23] day but Lord we consider ourselves to be
[1:20:26] so blessed in our day and in one sense
[1:20:29] of the word we are more
[1:20:32] blessed because when Thomas was able to
[1:20:36] touch the nail prints and the scars in
[1:20:39] your
[1:20:40] side and he said my Lord and my God yet
[1:20:44] you said to him Thomas you have believed
[1:20:49] because you have seen but how much more
[1:20:52] blessed are they that have never seen
[1:20:56] and yet they believe there's young
[1:20:59] people standing here tonight that was
[1:21:01] never in one of brother Ram
[1:21:03] Services they never talked maybe some of
[1:21:06] them to
[1:21:08] eyewitnesses to verify what they're
[1:21:11] hearing on tape but they believe it with
[1:21:14] all of their hearts if there would be
[1:21:16] another generation before long all those
[1:21:20] eyewitnesses brother Harvey sister
[1:21:22] Shirley Lunsford said here in our church
[1:21:26] brother Byron Palmer also an eyewitness
[1:21:29] brother Brenham came to their home they
[1:21:31] was there at the tabernac was through
[1:21:33] many services eyewitnesses even still
[1:21:36] alive in our church brother Tim puit an
[1:21:39] eyewitness there at the meetings in sort
[1:21:42] in
[1:21:44] 1965 if time goes on these eyewitnesses
[1:21:48] will all be gone but the word will still
[1:21:52] stand true Lord Jes Jesus thank you for
[1:21:56] opening our eyes and letting us be part
[1:22:00] of the open vision of the end time bless
[1:22:04] these young people father I pray keep
[1:22:07] them by your grace in the name of the
[1:22:09] Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you
[1:22:14] I love you all so much what I would have
[1:22:19] given if Carol and I and our teens or
[1:22:23] our 20s
[1:22:25] could have been able to heard these
[1:22:26] things I thank my goodness how much more
[1:22:29] I could have done for God you see you
[1:22:33] won't have to go through the years of
[1:22:36] unlearning a bunch of stuff stuff that
[1:22:39] you heard that you picked up and and
[1:22:42] still you'll hear things in the message
[1:22:44] and and those things will try to raise
[1:22:46] yourself up you don't know what that's
[1:22:48] not many of you never you've never had
[1:22:49] to do with it many of you were raised in
[1:22:52] in this church not in this church
[1:22:53] building but you know what I'm saying
[1:22:54] you were raised in the message don't
[1:22:57] take it for granted think how blessed
[1:22:59] you are that you don't have to struggle
[1:23:01] and wrestle with trying you in baptism
[1:23:04] and you don't have to wrestle with this
[1:23:05] and that and the other that a lot of the
[1:23:07] older people that come to our church
[1:23:09] you're bless young people may God bless

[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:31] 30 is coming into the message and one
[1:29:32] thing that brother Donnie mentioned uh
[1:29:34] brother Donnie mentioned at the end is
[1:29:36] that they wanted him to compromise on
[1:29:38] serpent seed and they wanted him to
[1:29:39] compromise on on water baptism well
[1:29:42] those are the things that got my
[1:29:44] attention that's what got my attention
[1:29:46] do not be afraid that it's what we
[1:29:50] believe is
[1:29:51] different okay it's very different than
[1:29:54] than when Christendom was and very
[1:29:55] different what I was hearing from the
[1:29:57] ministry as well as the message and
[1:29:59] basically I'd read the scripture first
[1:30:02] and I would go back and I'd read a
[1:30:04] sermon and I'd go back to find out where
[1:30:05] is that in scripture I was not wanting
[1:30:08] to sign up for anything and when I
[1:30:10] recognized the message dovetailing with
[1:30:12] the Scripture it was shocking to me how
[1:30:14] it did not it went against what I had
[1:30:17] been taught but it was exactly according
[1:30:20] to the word so I challenge you and God
[1:30:22] challenges Us Try Me look into the word
[1:30:25] and see if that's what Dove tales with
[1:30:27] the word and not with the world and
[1:30:29] that's what got my attention because it
[1:30:32] was different what they wanted him to
[1:30:33] compromise about is exactly what God
[1:30:35] hold of me and then I founded the word
[1:30:37] and then it gave me confidence it
[1:30:40] doesn't matter what man has to say about
[1:30:42] these things God has honored to his word
[1:30:43] will honor his word and honor his word
[1:30:45] in me that that was a progression and we
[1:30:48] ask you to do that even if you're young
[1:30:50] you don't want to just be in this church
[1:30:52] you want to go ahead and find God for
[1:30:54] yourself and let the Revelation grow in
[1:30:56] you according to the scripture Let's uh
[1:30:58] let's pray dear Lord thank you for your
[1:31:00] grace to us I thank you so much for the
[1:31:01] opportunity I thank you for the
[1:31:03] atmosphere in this building tonight Lord

[1:31:31] and I so thank you for it Lord than you
[1:31:34] are worth everything Lord we could ever
[1:31:36] hope and dream for and I pray and we'd
