[5:44] [Music]
[5:49] It is with deep sorrow and great love
[5:51] that we announce the passing of Marilyn
[5:53] Faith Wiggins,
[5:55] a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and
[5:58] great-grandmother, and friend who went
[6:01] to be with the Lord on May the 28th of
[6:04] 2025.
[6:06] She was preceded in death by her beloved
[6:09] husband of 68 years, William Alva
[6:12] Wiggins, whom she married on April the
[6:15] 30th, 1955.
[6:17] Their enduring love and partnership
[6:20] served as a shining example of
[6:22] commitment and devotion.
[6:25] She was also preceded in death by her
[6:28] son Robert William Wiggins. Her parents
[6:31] Lillian and Allan Scott and her brother
[6:35] Vernon Scott. She is survived by her
[6:38] loving children Evelyn Marie Wiggins
[6:41] and William Alba Wiggins III and wife
[6:45] Renee. her grandchildren, Shawn Micah
[6:48] and Kimberly Wiggins, Brian Joseph and
[6:51] Sharon Wiggins, Kimberly Dawn and Josh
[6:55] Dixon, and Kristen Faith Wiggins, her
[6:59] cherished great grandchildren, Chloe
[7:02] Oliver and Robert Dixon, Liam and Fiona
[7:06] Wiggins, Cara and Avery Wiggins, and her
[7:10] daughter-in-law Sher Wiggins. Marilyn
[7:13] had a heart for caregiving and spent 24
[7:16] years as a dedicated certified nursing
[7:20] assistant. Her compassion and gentleness
[7:23] touched the lives of countless patients
[7:26] and families.
[7:28] She had a true love for the simple joys
[7:30] of life, gardening, crocheting, and
[7:33] reading. But her greatest joy came from
[7:36] her family whom she loved deeply and
[7:38] unconditionally.
[7:39] A woman of faith, Marilyn was a proud
[7:42] member of Word of Life Church in Johnson
[7:44] City, Tennessee. Her strong Christian
[7:47] values guided her every step and were
[7:50] evident in the way that she lived her
[7:52] life with grace, humility, and love. She
[7:57] leaves behind a legacy of kindness,
[7:59] strength, and unwavering love that will
[8:03] continue to live in the hearts of all
[8:06] who knew her. Matthew 25:23, well done,
[8:11] good and faithful servant. Enter in to
[8:14] the joy of the Lord. On behalf of the
[8:18] Wiggins family, uh they want to express
[8:21] their love and appreciation to this
[8:24] assembly and to all who shared their
[8:26] love to them during this loss, this
[8:29] season of their life that they're going
[8:31] through. Uh we just want to say that we
[8:34] love the Wiggins family. They're part
[8:36] they're part of us and we're part of
[8:37] them. But they want to thank you for all
[8:39] the food that you've that you've sent
[8:41] that you brought to them. All the cards,
[8:44] all the calls, everything that you've
[8:46] done. It is very very much appreciated.

[8:52] of Life loves you and we hold you in our
[8:56] heart as well. God bless every one of
[8:58] you.

[9:17] [Applause]
[9:21] On the top of Mount Zion
[9:26] is a city
[9:30] and the Earth
[9:32] [Music]
[9:37] with its glory
[9:39] it does fill.
[9:42] [Music]
[9:43] I shall look on its beauty
[9:48] in the morning
[9:52] when I reach reach that city
[9:57] on the hill.
[10:01] Oh that city oh that city
[10:04] &gt;&gt; on the top of Mount Zion on the top of
[10:08] mountain
[10:10] of pure
[10:14] I love thee still.
[10:18] I'm not with thee
[10:22] through the air
[10:27] when I reach reach that city
[10:33] here.
[10:36] Oh, I'll stay here until my Savior calls
[10:43] me,
[10:45] trying daily
[10:48] to perform his will.
[10:53] Then he'll say unto me, well done up
[10:59] yonder.
[11:02] When I reach breeze that city
[11:07] on the hill,
[11:11] I'm invited
[11:14] to come home to that city
[11:20] where the word it says who soever
[11:25] will.
[11:29] And I know there's a mansion
[11:33] for me waiting
[11:37] when I reach reach that city
[11:42] of the hill.
[11:46] Oh city
[11:50] on the top of mountain top of mountain.
[11:55] [Music]
[11:59] I love this.
[12:04] I'm not

[12:14] [Music]
[12:21] When I reach
[12:24] the city
[12:26] on the hill,
[12:33] [Music]
[12:43] Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[12:48] In that city is a mansion.
[12:51] And in that mansion is a little lady, no
[12:54] doubt sitting out on the porch
[12:58] beside her king,
[13:00] waiting for us to get there, too. Amen.
[13:04] Married land, Bula.
[13:07] Amen.
[13:11] I'm kind
[13:13] of home
[13:16] sick
[13:19] for a country
[13:25] to which I've
[13:28] never
[13:32] been before.
[13:38] No sad goodbyes.
[13:42] There
[13:44] will be spoken
[13:50] for time won't matter
[13:58] anymore.
[14:00] [Music]
[14:03] to the land.
[14:09] I'm longing
[14:12] for
[14:14] you.
[14:18] And someday
[14:24] only thee I'll stand
[14:31] where my home
[14:37] has been made eternal.
[14:43] eternal home
[14:46] land
[14:48] [Music]
[14:51] sweet
[14:53] land.
[14:57] I'm looking
[15:00] now
[15:04] how across
[15:06] that old river
[15:08] [Music]
[15:11] where my faith
[15:16] where my faith shall end
[15:20] inside.
[15:24] I have only just a few more,
[15:30] I believe it, more days
[15:33] to labor
[15:35] [Music]
[15:37] and then I will take
[15:44] my heavenly
[15:46] flight from this old world.
[15:51] Oh, beautiful land.
[15:57] I'm longing
[15:59] for you.
[16:01] [Music]
[16:04] And someday
[16:10] on pe I will stand.
[16:17] Where my home
[16:23] has been made
[16:26] eternal.
[16:30] to the land.
[16:36] Sweet Mary
[16:39] land.
[16:41] [Music]
[16:47] Thank you, Lord.
[16:49] I'm longing
[16:51] for you.
[16:56] And someday
[17:02] on that new land I shall stand
[17:09] where my home
[17:15] has been made eternal. Oh
[17:21] [Music]
[17:24] land,
[17:25] [Applause]
[17:28] sweet
[17:30] land
[17:35] where my home
[17:41] has been made
[17:44] eternal. Oh,
[17:48] sweet beauty the land
[17:55] sweet Mary
[17:59] lamb.
[18:03] Hallelujah.
[18:20] certainly wish to extend our condolences
[18:23] to family and friends of our departed
[18:27] sister.
[18:29] I'd like to read to you this evening
[18:31] from Proverbs chapter 31 verse 10.
[18:36] Who can find
[18:38] a virtuous woman?
[18:42] For her price
[18:44] is far above
[18:46] rubies.
[18:48] The question is who can find
[18:52] doesn't suggest that there aren't women
[18:55] that do exist like this.
[18:58] But the setting that Solomon wrote it so
[19:00] many many years ago is that they are
[19:03] very very rare.
[19:06] and hard to find. If he would have said
[19:09] that several thousand years ago, I
[19:12] wonder what he would say today. If he
[19:14] would come and live in Johnson City,
[19:16] Bristol, Kingsport for about a week and
[19:20] then walk around and then write this in
[19:24] modern terms. Wonder what he would say.
[19:28] Listen what he goes on to say. the heart
[19:31] of her husband doth safely trust in her
[19:37] so that he shall have no need of spoil.
[19:42] Now this woman is not just a natural
[19:45] woman that we're talking about but a
[19:47] woman that has been so touched by
[19:50] heaven's fire
[19:52] it is consumed innate desires of things
[19:56] that would be contrary to righteousness
[19:57] and truth. And this woman has truly
[20:00] found a great position. Looked over by
[20:04] many of course, but for those who find
[20:07] it, what a great thing they have found.
[20:10] I believe tonight that we're speaking
[20:12] about such a lady. The heart of her
[20:16] husband does safely trust in her so that
[20:18] he shall have no need of spoil. She will
[20:22] do him good and not evil all the days of
[20:27] her life. Ah, that was Sister Marilyn.
[20:30] Ladies, those of you that are here
[20:32] tonight, you may never be an actress to
[20:35] Hollywood. You may never be a great
[20:37] opera singer. You may never make
[20:41] Hollywood's hall of fame or golden
[20:44] streets and your name may be written
[20:46] there in a star by your name.
[20:50] But in reality,
[20:52] if you make this right here, you will
[20:55] excel further than any Hollywood star
[20:58] has ever excelled.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Because soon and very soon, Hollywood
[21:05] will be sunk.
[21:07] But you see the women who attained to
[21:10] this
[21:12] as our sister Evelyn
[21:14] started out like all other females, all
[21:17] other males, born lost,
[21:21] conceived in sin, come to the world,
[21:24] speaking lies, seemingly without a hope,
[21:28] without no ray of light to ever change
[21:30] us from what we were. We were deceitful
[21:32] in our nature. We were lost and we loved
[21:36] every minute of it because that was what
[21:39] our nature was. But one day something
[21:42] began to hunger in her heart. What was
[21:45] it? This call right here. You see, God
[21:48] could never have this word written had
[21:51] there not been somebody that would be
[21:53] able to respond to this. I believe I'm
[21:55] looking to other women that are of the
[21:57] same caliber right here tonight. Good
[22:00] comes to this husband who has this kind
[22:03] of wife. She will do him good and not
[22:04] evil all the days of her life because
[22:07] this woman is an asset. She's not a
[22:11] liability.
[22:12] She will do him good all the days of his
[22:15] life. So good comes to him in such a way
[22:19] that he can be comforted by having her
[22:23] as his wife. I not only see a godly
[22:26] woman in this, but I see the true bride
[22:29] of Jesus Christ. one which will bear his
[22:33] reproach and bear his shame. And that
[22:35] the Lord Jesus is not pacing in heaven
[22:38] today wondering, "Will there be anybody
[22:41] saved? It's got so bad down on the earth
[22:44] and it's so dark. I'm so worried. I'm
[22:47] just so concerned that I've died in
[22:50] vain." You need to reread your Bible.
[22:53] Let me show you how worried he is. He's
[22:56] already gone away to prepare the place,
[22:59] and it's this close to being done.
[23:02] Streets have already been laid. The
[23:04] gates have already been hung. And the
[23:06] angels of God are waiting breathlessly
[23:09] for the last women and their husbands
[23:12] and their children to be completed in
[23:15] the economy of God. What a meeting
[23:18] that's going to be. She's faithful in
[23:22] helping him all of her life. Now notice
[23:24] how Solomon goes on to describe her. And
[23:26] he uses terms that would have been very
[23:28] common in that day, not so much in our
[23:30] day. He says, "She seeketh wool and flax
[23:35] and workketh willingly with her hands.
[23:39] She is like the merchants ships. She
[23:43] bringeth her food from afar." Now notice
[23:47] her setting. It's it's the entirety of
[23:51] her life and the God-given call and
[23:54] purpose of what he's made her to be. And
[23:57] things that people in this day would
[23:59] think, "Oh my goodness, that's nothing
[24:00] to even brag about. It's not a BA. It's
[24:03] not a PhD. It didn't come from Harvard
[24:05] somewhere. It didn't come from this,
[24:07] that, and the other." Uh I' I've studied
[24:10] this Bible for a long time. I've never
[24:13] even found the word Harvard in there.
[24:16] Right?
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe I overlooked it somehow. I've not
[24:19] found Bob Jones University. I've not
[24:22] found Oxford,
[24:24] &gt;&gt; but I found this woman.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; This woman is a reflection of God's
[24:30] original thought of what a woman should
[24:35] and could be.
[24:37] She riseth also while it is yet night
[24:41] and giveth meat to her household and a
[24:45] portion to her maidens. She considerth a
[24:49] field and buyth it. With the fruit of
[24:52] her hand she planteth a vineyard. She
[24:56] girthth her loins with strength and
[24:58] strengthenth her arms. She perceiveth
[25:01] that her merchandise is good. Her candle
[25:05] goeth not out by night. Oh my goodness.
[25:10] I think I need to go back to verse one
[25:12] and say, who can find such a woman?
[25:17] Are there any left?
[25:19] Are there any left in 2025
[25:23] that God would call virtuous? Beautiful.
[25:27] Oh, yeah. We could find those. Rich.
[25:30] Yep. endowed with this and that and the
[25:33] other. Yes. But would God say that is a
[25:39] virtuous woman?
[25:42] You see, God's image of what he wanted
[25:44] Sister Marilyn to be was not what her
[25:46] mother and father had endowed her with
[25:49] at birth. To no fault of their own, they
[25:52] could not pass on righteousness or
[25:54] purity or goodness or tress or
[25:57] faithfulness or anything of that great
[26:00] thing. No doubt she had good attributes
[26:03] as she was a little tiny girl. But like
[26:06] all of us, she needed to have another
[26:09] birth,
[26:10] &gt;&gt; a birth from heaven.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; You see, she was born once and then
[26:15] somewhere in that time frame she died
[26:19] and then she started living again and
[26:22] then she died and now she started living
[26:25] again.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; We that's complicated. No, it's not
[26:29] really. She was born and she lived a
[26:31] life of a mortal. Then she met him and
[26:33] she died to this world and she was
[26:35] reborn and started living again.
[26:38] And then just a while back she as we
[26:42] call it died but actually she didn't
[26:45] die. She just started living
[26:49] &gt;&gt; her real life. And if you and I could
[26:51] see her tonight, oh, by now she's
[26:53] already went through the sixth
[26:55] dimension, seen probably tens of
[26:58] millions of people, not angels up there
[27:01] flying around with wings on their back,
[27:03] but human beings that have been changed
[27:06] in a theophenic appearance and they you
[27:09] can feel them, touch them. No doubt her
[27:12] young, handsome husband was waiting for
[27:15] her right as she crossed the river. and
[27:18] her friends and her loved ones and they
[27:20] were giving her accolades of a great
[27:24] woman. Now when she passed our flag was
[27:28] not flown at half mass. The state of
[27:31] Tennessee our governor never
[27:32] acknowledged her and it broke all over
[27:35] from Nashville to Knoxville to Tri
[27:37] Cities to Memphis from one end of
[27:39] Tennessee to the other. A great lady has
[27:43] passed today.
[27:45] Most of the world never even knew it.
[27:48] But my Bible tells me, precious in the
[27:52] sight of the Lord is the deaths
[27:58] of his saints.
[28:00] What a peculiar thing to say that God
[28:04] would look at something that we consider
[28:06] so painful and something that so
[28:10] separates us and call it precious. What
[28:14] does death do? It's simply a vehicle. C
[28:18] certainly it takes away the animation of
[28:21] our body. And what it does, it brings us
[28:24] to our true identity of who we really
[28:27] are. Our spirit goes back to God who
[28:30] gave it. Our body goes back to the dust
[28:32] of the earth and our soul goes to its
[28:36] habitation of the master that we served.
[28:39] So what death does, it brings you to the
[28:42] tress of really who you are. And this
[28:45] body that you're living in tonight is
[28:47] not the real you anyway. It just bears
[28:50] an image of the life that you live.
[28:54] Listen what Solomon said. She layeth up
[28:57] her hands to the spindle, and her hands
[29:01] hold the distaff. She stretcheth out her
[29:05] hand to the poor. Yay, she reaches forth
[29:08] her hands to the needy. She is not
[29:11] afraid of the snow for her household,
[29:15] for all her household are clothed with
[29:19] scarlet.
[29:20] Who can find such a woman in this day? I
[29:25] knew one.
[29:27] As a matter of fact, I have been
[29:30] privileged
[29:32] to know thousands of them.
[29:35] I've met them from the darkest parts of
[29:37] Africa into India. I walked into their
[29:42] homes in Tanzania.
[29:45] There was no carpet on the floor. As a
[29:47] matter of fact, there was no floor.
[29:50] It was dust and dirt.
[29:53] I've been into the houses and the homes
[29:56] of the people in Madras and Bombay and
[29:59] different parts of the world and found
[30:02] women just like this.
[30:06] Wow.
[30:08] But what would they all have in common?
[30:11] cuz some of them were former Hindu, some
[30:15] of them were former idol worshippers,
[30:18] some of them were former church members,
[30:20] and some of them just drunks, liars,
[30:23] whatever else you could imagine.
[30:26] But it was like a trait that ran through
[30:28] them all as I've seen them around the
[30:31] world. They never met one another. They
[30:34] never shook one another's hands, but it
[30:37] was as if though they were all from the
[30:41] same patronage,
[30:44] the same genealogy,
[30:47] &gt;&gt; a family trait that was in them. They
[30:50] might not even speak the same language.
[30:53] When I stood in India and preached to
[30:56] over 5,000 people at one time, I had an
[30:59] interpreter to my left, one to my right,
[31:02] and 20 more out there amongst all them.
[31:06] Thousands of people. They didn't even
[31:09] speak their own language, yet they lived
[31:11] in the same country. What was it? It was
[31:15] a different parent.
[31:18] What parent was it? Almighty God.
[31:21] You see, it's been his desire to have
[31:25] women, not only women, but men, young
[31:29] men, young ladies that would reflect his
[31:33] character. Solomon goes on to say, "She
[31:36] maketh herself coverings of tapestry.
[31:40] Her clothing is silk and purple." You
[31:44] see, linen is made from flax and purple
[31:48] is the dye made from shellfish.
[31:52] Her own clothing was the evidences of
[31:56] what her children were clothed in. Flax
[32:00] during part of the time frame when the
[32:02] Bible was written was worth more than
[32:06] gold ounce for ounce. purple made from
[32:11] the shellfish, the silicus, a little
[32:14] tiny insect that they would get which
[32:16] inhabited itself under the bark of an
[32:19] oak tree. And they would get one drop
[32:22] out of each insect.
[32:25] And this lady worked and labored and
[32:29] worked. She wasn't like a lot of the
[32:31] women today that give birth to their
[32:34] babies
[32:36] and put them in a dumpster
[32:39] and walk away from them or never even
[32:42] give them a chance to live.
[32:46] There's such a difference between what
[32:48] God describes
[32:50] as a virtuous woman. When you look at
[32:53] this picture of our sister,
[32:57] I want you to walk out of here tonight
[32:58] with just one thing. Forget what I've
[33:00] said. It's not really relevant any man
[33:03] what he can say. She has preached her
[33:05] own sermon.
[33:07] And when you meet a daughter of God like
[33:10] this, keep this in mind. This day these
[33:14] scriptures have been fulfilled in your
[33:17] hearing. And it was not in her ability
[33:21] nor any of these sisters here or any
[33:24] around the world to do this on their
[33:27] own. You see, a life lived by the word
[33:31] is the word expressed.
[33:34] I'm not sure that our sister would be
[33:36] able to quote 10 chapters in the Bible,
[33:39] word by word, without missing a verse.
[33:41] I'm not sure that she could tell you how
[33:43] Peter died, how James died, how Mark
[33:46] died, all the history of the church. I'm
[33:49] not sure she could do all that, but I'm
[33:52] sure she knew how to take a child up in
[33:54] her arms and love its hurts away. and be
[33:58] able to kiss a boo boo or whatever it
[34:00] was she called it and them little lips
[34:03] able to mend a broken heart as a mother
[34:07] as a grandmother as a daughter of God.
[34:10] So which will live the longest? If she
[34:13] could have left her children $10 million
[34:15] a piece which would last the longest?
[34:18] That heritage of love? You see, because
[34:21] money is not forever. It's only a means
[34:23] by which we're able to get the things in
[34:25] life that we so desire. But true love is
[34:30] eternal. Notice the evidence of her
[34:33] family. They were wellto-do.
[34:37] They were wellto-do.
[34:40] And it doesn't mention that it was the
[34:42] father that did it. It was the mother.
[34:46] Her husband is known in the gates when
[34:50] he sitth among the elders of the land.
[34:53] You see, a noble woman of such enhances
[34:57] her husband's standing.
[35:00] Oh, I want to stop preaching the funeral
[35:02] and just preach you a sermon tonight
[35:04] about the bride of Christ and what she
[35:07] does to the Lord Jesus. She enhances his
[35:10] name, his honor, his reputation, his
[35:16] character. Verse 24, she maketh fine
[35:19] linen, and sellth it, and deliverth
[35:22] girdles unto the merchant. Strength and
[35:26] honor are her clothing, and she shall
[35:30] rejoice
[35:32] in time
[35:35] to come.
[35:38] Many of you know the icon, the woman
[35:41] called Marilyn Monroe,
[35:44] a woman that was no doubt one of the
[35:48] most beautiful women in her time. And
[35:51] yet when she died,
[35:53] no one left to come and claim her body.
[35:58] King Henry VIII when he was laying on
[36:01] his bed and screaming and flames was
[36:04] coming up around him to engulf him. He
[36:08] screamed for the monks and the priests
[36:11] to come.
[36:13] And before they could get there, he
[36:14] finally said, "It's too late.
[36:18] I'm lost."
[36:22] Who can find a virtuous woman? No doubt
[36:25] he was looking for something because he
[36:27] sure had enough wives and he sure had
[36:30] enough women in his life.
[36:33] But having women in your life and a
[36:36] woman like this is not the same thing
[36:40] as I stand here tonight and pay tribute
[36:44] and honor to our sister. Though her
[36:48] mortal life has come to an end and we're
[36:51] here tonight as a memorial to her, she
[36:55] has just started living in that world
[36:58] that all of us tonight who are
[37:00] Christians have read about, sung about,
[37:03] heard about our entire life. Now, as I
[37:07] close,
[37:09] let me say this. Verse 26. She openeth
[37:12] her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue
[37:16] is the law of kindness. She lookketh
[37:20] well to the ways of her household, and
[37:22] eateth not the bread of idleness. Her
[37:25] children arise up, and call her blessed,
[37:31] her husband also,
[37:34] and he praiseth
[37:37] her.
[37:41] as I went to the nursing home before her
[37:45] precious, precious husband passed and he
[37:48] said, "Brother Donnie,
[37:50] I'd give anything to get out of this
[37:52] place." I said, "Buddy, I know you
[37:54] would."
[37:55] Mean, Brother Daryl went in there with
[37:57] him and there was so much sickness in
[37:58] the nursing home and he wasn't even in a
[38:01] room. They had him out on a hallway and
[38:03] I was trying to get him out and move him
[38:04] around a little bit. Brother Daryl and I
[38:07] both knelt down there in the middle of
[38:09] the hallway with nurses passing by and
[38:12] we wept with him and cried.
[38:15] And I thought, "What a shape man can get
[38:18] in."
[38:20] Aren't you glad tonight, friends, that
[38:22] there's a land beyond this life here?
[38:26] Every one of us are preaching our own
[38:30] funeral
[38:31] by the way we live, what we do, the way
[38:35] we say. There's nothing any preacher can
[38:38] say that will change what you already
[38:42] do. All he can do honestly is use what
[38:46] you give him.
[38:48] I hope and pray to God if I'm ever
[38:51] rolled up here in a box. The preachers
[38:54] don't have to stutter and uh um uh uh
[38:57] well um um um boy, it's been a nice day,
[39:02] ain't it? Well, it's been really pretty
[39:03] outside today. And um
[39:07] I want to give them so much to work on.
[39:10] They don't know where to start and they
[39:13] don't know where to end. Is there
[39:15] anybody else here that feels the same
[39:17] way? Or do you want a stuttering
[39:20] funeral, a stammering
[39:23] funeral?
[39:25] Well, I heard one time that he he he
[39:27] bought the widow some coal and uh and he
[39:29] gave $5 to Goodwill. And um I I was told
[39:33] one time that he um took an old pair of
[39:35] wore out shoes and socks that had holes
[39:38] in them and an old dress shirt and uh
[39:40] dropped them off at the Salvation Army
[39:42] and he was a good man.
[39:46] Wouldn't you rather be this type of
[39:49] individual,
[39:51] men and women alike?
[39:56] So when you pass beyond the veil of
[39:58] time,
[40:00] that a man can say about you, words that
[40:03] are so true that they ring up into
[40:07] heaven. Now, y'all can't hear it
[40:08] tonight, but if you could hear the voice
[40:12] of the Lord Jesus,
[40:14] when this is preached at every one of
[40:16] his children's funeral, the Lord Jesus
[40:19] can say, "Amen."
[40:22] The angels of God can say, "Glory."
[40:25] &gt;&gt; And the archangels and the cherubams can
[40:27] say, "It's true.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; It's right."
[40:33] The saints of God in the sixth dimension
[40:35] where our sister is gathered.
[40:38] Hallelujah.
[40:41] They all could echo back the same.
[40:44] Would our sister Marilyn ever want to
[40:46] come back to this life? No. Death, the
[40:50] vehicle of death has settled the score
[40:52] and divided her back to what God wanted
[40:56] her to be.
[40:58] Separated the soul out of the body. The
[41:00] spirit breaks up when you die and the
[41:03] soul goes into that house that Paul
[41:05] wrote about. A house not made with
[41:08] hands.
[41:10] So what did she take with her? Her
[41:12] favorite house shoes, her favorite house
[41:15] coat, favorite pictures, none of that.
[41:18] You know what she took? Her character,
[41:22] the fulfillment of God's word in her
[41:25] life. And when she stands before the
[41:28] Lord Jesus that day, it will not be a
[41:30] throne of judgment. You should have done
[41:33] that and you should have done that and
[41:35] you should have done that.
[41:38] But to say to her, well done,
[41:42] my good and faithful daughter.
[41:45] You served me well. Enter into the joys
[41:49] of your Lord. I saw what you went
[41:52] through in life and your life wasn't
[41:54] easy, but I was with you. I strengthened
[41:58] you. I am the one that made you the
[42:01] fulfillment of Proverbs 31.
[42:06] Let's bow our heads.
[42:14] Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight,
[42:16] Lord,
[42:19] for a life that has been lived among us.
[42:23] Dear God, that we would be able to stand
[42:27] up and not lie and not have to fabricate
[42:31] things about her and hunt and search.
[42:36] Brother Louie basically read her
[42:38] funeral. whenever he read the orbituary
[42:42] put together by family members and
[42:47] those who knew her the closest.
[42:49] Was she perfect and faultless? Of course
[42:52] not. She was not perfect. She was just
[42:56] redeemed. She was not without fault.
[43:00] But she had a perfect blood and a
[43:04] perfect sacrifice
[43:06] that spoke for her. So all of her
[43:09] mistakes was hid away under the blood of
[43:13] the Lord Jesus.
[43:15] She no longer knows time. We set her
[43:19] memorial service to begin at 7:00.
[43:22] That's because us mortals still go by
[43:24] time. But she no longer is a subject of
[43:29] time.
[43:31] She's now been changed back to an
[43:32] appearance of about 18 years old.
[43:37] her handsome husband was standing there
[43:39] with her, ready to meet her at the
[43:42] river. All those family and friends that
[43:46] were privileged by the grace of God to
[43:50] be able to have a theophony body,
[43:53] they met her at the river. No doubt
[43:56] she's met some of the saints that she
[43:58] fellowship with here in our church.
[44:01] Neither of them were able to come to
[44:03] church very much in the last few years
[44:06] because of their health.
[44:09] But Lord, how many years they went to
[44:11] church and were faithful. Not only here,
[44:13] but the years they lived in Arizona. I
[44:17] remember seeing them in different
[44:18] meetings when I'd go out there and
[44:20] preach in Arizona. They'd always try to
[44:22] come up to me if they could and just
[44:24] speak a few words and shake my hand. But
[44:28] now, Lord, she'd never
[44:30] have to part from church again
[44:34] cuz she's with the church. They no
[44:37] longer meet in a building, but they're
[44:40] meeting in fields of blueg grass with
[44:43] rolling hills and sparkling streams of
[44:46] water
[44:47] and skies that are the ash of blue and
[44:50] the flowers that are the brightest
[44:51] yellow she's ever seen.
[44:55] She's never seen Fuchsia so beautiful
[44:58] and dynamic.
[45:00] And Lord, when we meet him again,
[45:03] it may be similar to as it was when the
[45:06] prophet had told someone who had lost a
[45:08] loved one.
[45:09] Whenever you see your son again, to him
[45:13] it will seem
[45:15] that it's been no more than three
[45:17] minutes
[45:19] why they broke into eternity.
[45:24] It certainly doesn't feel like three
[45:26] minutes to us, though, Lord.
[45:30] So, I turn my attention tonight from
[45:33] heaven,
[45:35] and I turn it toward these mortals whose
[45:38] hearts are broken,
[45:40] tears trickling out of their eyes as
[45:42] mine.
[45:44] I pray you would help us, Jesus.
[45:48] Bring comfort tonight, Lord, as only you
[45:51] can do.
[45:53] Dear Father, may your loving arms just
[45:56] wrap around them in those moments when
[45:58] they feel like they can't take it no
[46:00] more because the loss is so great. Help
[46:03] them to realize how blessed they were to
[46:06] have such a mother, a mother-in-law, a
[46:09] grandmother, a great grandmother,
[46:12] us as a church family to have her as a
[46:15] sister. We were blessed. Father, be with
[46:19] us. Lord, keep us saved. I pray there
[46:22] won't be a one of us missing on that
[46:25] day. Lord God, when you gather your
[46:27] people of such quality as what we've
[46:31] read about here tonight, what a
[46:33] gathering that will be. Help us, I pray.
[46:37] Father, in the name of Jesus,
[46:42] [Music]
[46:43] if we never meet
[46:47] again
[46:50] on this earth, my preious friend,
[46:56] if to God you have been true
[47:02] and you've lived above all sin,
[47:08] Then for us there'll be a meeting.
[47:13] Oh,
[47:17] your greeting.
[47:20] I'll see you in the rapture.
[47:24] [Music]
[47:26] Thank you, Lord.
[47:30] Oh, I'll see you in the rapture.
[47:37] I'll see you in the rapture. Help me
[47:42] sing it. I'll meet you. I'll see you at
[47:46] that meeting, Sister Marilyn,
[47:49] over there.
[47:52] [Applause]
[47:54] There was my blessed
[47:58] Savior
[48:00] will live and reign forever.
[48:05] I'll see you in the rapture
[48:10] some sweet day.
[48:16] To my loved ones, let me say
[48:22] that there surely come a day
[48:28] when our Lord will come again
[48:33] and take his waiting bride away.
[48:39] So get ready now to meet him
[48:45] and with
[48:47] hallelujah.
[48:48] We're going to greet him. I'll see you
[48:52] in the rapture
[48:55] some sweet day.
[49:01] Oh, I'll see you in the rapture. Can we
[49:06] just praise him? See you in the rapture.
[49:13] I'll see you at that meeting
[49:18] in the air.
[49:24] There was our blessed
[49:27] savior.
[49:29] We're going to live and reign forever.
[49:35] I'll see you in the rapture
[49:40] some sweet day.
[49:44] Sister Marilyn, I'll see you in the
[49:50] rapture
[49:51] some sweet day.
[49:55] [Applause]
[49:57] [Music]
[50:01] Hallelujah.
[50:03] And you see for those of us who are
[50:05] alive and remaining,
[50:07] it may be to your house
[50:10] that you're standing there in the mirror
[50:12] one day combing your hair, brushing your
[50:14] teeth, and you look in the mirror, and
[50:17] you see this beautiful young woman
[50:20] standing there, and you say, "Oh my
[50:23] Lord, it's mother. It's grandmother as
[50:27] you knew her. It's mother-in-law."
[50:30] And then you see brother Wiggins and you
[50:32] see this one and that one and you know
[50:34] it won't be long you're going to be
[50:37] changed. That's what we're looking for.
[50:40] Friends,
[50:41] God bless you. Thank you for attending.
[50:44] May the Lord Jesus and his grace comfort
[50:47] each of your hearts and be with you and
[50:50] give you strength. Harry, would you
[50:52] continue to sing that? Sister Evelyn had
[50:55] asked if we'd pray for her tonight and
[50:58] I'm going to step down and do for that.
[50:59] Would you pray with me for our sister?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; I'll see you in the rapture.
[51:11] I'll see you in the rapture.
[51:17] I'll see you at that meeting
[51:22] in the air.
[51:27] [Music]
[51:28] There with our blessed
[51:32] savior
[51:34] will live and reign forever.

[51:45] some sweet day.
[51:49] Oh yes, I'll see you in the rapture.
[51:57] I'll see you in the rapture.
[52:02] I'll see you when
[52:06] &gt;&gt; May we stand together. God bless you.
[52:08] Thank you for your attendance.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; There with our blessed
[52:17] Savior
[52:19] will live and reign forever.
[52:23] [Music]
[52:25] I see you in the rapture
[52:29] some sweet day.
[52:33] God bless you. You're dismissed.
[52:35] I'll see you in the rapture.
[52:41] I'll see you in the rapture.
[52:47] I'll see you at that meeting
[52:52] in the air.
