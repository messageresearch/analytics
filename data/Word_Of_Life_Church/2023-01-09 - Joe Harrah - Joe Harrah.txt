translation of the Bride he goes and talks about Sarah and Abraham and how he said before that promised son could come they had to have a body change then he goes on to talk about how the word in you that word that's coming will materialize around the word that's already in you my so that's what we're getting ready you say we're both Joel you don't know what I'm going through you don't know how weary and blue I am you're still promised a body change weeping may endure for a night but joy it's coming in the morning I don't know about y'all but I believe these things we've been hearing I believe these things that I read I'm going to take them on one day let's go son let me shut up praise God God's good to us isn't he [Music] who don't have to worry and don't you be afraid Joy comes in the morning troubles they don't last always for there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away and if your heart is broken just lift your hands and say oh I know that I can take it with him I know I will stand no matter what may come my way my life is in his hands with Jesus I can take it with him I know I will stand no matter what may come my way my life is in his hands [Music] so when your tests and trials they seem to get you down and all your friends and loved ones I know where to be found remember there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away and if your heart is broken listen just lift your hands and sing oh I know that I can take it I know I know I know that I can say no matter what may come my way my life is in his hands which Jesus I can take it with him I know I can say no matter what may come my life is in his hand oh I know that I can take it [Music] on my way with Jesus I can take it [Music] may come my way [Music] no matter what they come my way my life is in his again [Music] nope [Music] no matter what gets in your way I read a quote before I come out here brother Andrew whoever had had posted so brother Branham said in 56 and God has provided away he said you look at all the what they went through in the Old Testament they escaped the edge of the sword their dead was raised he said you can do that too if you take the same road he said that was he said you said that was the Bible Way that's what they did in the Bible said we're still in the Bible Way yeah why did he say pray and read your Bible every day because you're in the Bible Way you are the living Bible as you're going to find out today if you've never ever heard how much of the Bible you are after today you have no excuse because I have got bruises and stripes and man I have fell short so don't get mad at the messenger Jimmy while ago and I told Tim Murray Friday night I said brother Donnie heard I was preaching so he went to Gatlinburg [Laughter] I wish he'd took me with him but we're glad to see but they don't want to get some rest yeah he's he's worked and worked and worked he's put in a lot of time over there he might not tell you but he's getting old I watch him walk out the other day I thought who is that man it didn't look like the same guy that stood up here 30 years ago but for him it's a labor of love look I go I don't I've done nothing there right near as much work over there as everybody else uh but I go over there I see them brothers working I'm sorry if I'm taking up your my preaching time I'll cut it short I always do anyway so watching Brothers work and you can tell by the spirit their attitude that they love what they're doing you know I've often thought people that would say I can't believe you're doing this you're building this you're doing that and all that everybody knows it that knows brother Donnie brother Donnie does anything until he's led up the Lord because I remember the brothers came to brother Donny about 25 years ago to do this to build this church and he's said they didn't feel the leading of the Lord to do it so just be careful what you say when you've got a man of God that is doing something I promise you he's doing it prayerfully prayerfully and he's doing it for you he ain't doing it for himself he he loves his he loves God's people so if you have your Bibles and you want to turn with me to Mark chapter 16. if anybody sees anything wrong with my suit this morning my wife tried to dress me but she didn't so I got some looks on the way here I'm not up on fashion sorry she won't post no pictures of me though I guarantee you with this song so anyways let's go to work after he had appeared in another form onto two of them as they walked into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them they didn't believe when he said we saw him they didn't believe him afterward he appeared unto the leaven as they sat at meat and uprighted him with for their unbelief and their Hardness of Heart because they believe on they believe not on them that had seen him after he was risen people are going to see Christ in you what we're going to talk about today is go tell the world that's the title go tell the world because you are the message you are the message people are not going to believe you people are not going to believe you there's some that will believe you just by watching your life your life will bring people into this message without you even opening your mouth that's the Bible Way and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that means a creature in here today this message was preached to you or you would have not been here there's many of you or most of you are here because someone that carried this message that lived this message expressed it to you and here you are and it wasn't a preacher many of you are here because someone that wasn't a preacher lived a life in front of you if that seed that was in you was never there that deep calm to the Deep on that person whose life that influenced you would never influence you we'll look at that further on but there has to be a life in there to respond to a life does that make sense you know me I don't get deep I'm just real simple it's about our heads Heavenly Father we're so grateful for another day Lord another day Lord to sit around your word Lord we know so many times we've heard Lord this is the House of Correction and Lord we receive that but sometimes this is also the house of blessing this is the house of Praise this is the house of worship Lord I Hope in today's sermon father even if we get correction help us to give you praise help us to worship help us to get blessings Lord lord it's not always just about coming and hearing and and making sure that our lives are just straight and narrow Lord but that's part of it but it's also sometimes Lord it's time to give Glory back to you to give praise and worship back to you because you are the only one that is worthy of that may we do that this morning we advise you Lord help me to get out of the way Lord is as I put these notes together and I sit back there I study them over and I've studied them again and getting ready to come out here just seems like it all goes blank ministers here can tell you that that's how it happens you think you you have it how you're going to do it on your notes and then you walk out it all goes blank but Lord if I have to go blank so you can feel that void Lord may it happen may you speak to us this morning Lord Lord anything that would hinder our lives may be push it out any criticism any anything Lord any bitterness Lord that we if we would come in here and say give me something show me something lord I can't give them anything but Lord you can give them you that's what we're going to look at this morning how you have given you to us we thank you for that bless your people Lord in Jesus name amen you can be seated as I said the title that I've given this is go tell the world and Jesus tells him go eat in all the world and preach the gospel of every creature he wasn't talking just to the disciples that is your commission that is my commission you have a commission your commission is not go Sunday Wednesday and go and listen to the preacher and receive the word I'm going to read you a quote that I found last night that just totally floored me brother Brandon said our job is your job is brother Graham says in question and answers now you remember what I said last Sunday you are a preacher get a Pulpit if you're not live your sermon see that's the best way to do that live your sermon he says it again if you're a preacher get a Pulpit and go to preaching if you're not just live your sermon let your life be your pulpit I don't I think that takes care of a whole lot don't you and you say brother Joe what am I supposed to preach you know we've got preachers all in the message we have to put quotations beside the message now because there's so many versions so many so many opinions so many ideas but there's God still has some God called men that are still in the Bible Way that are still teaching the message as The Seventh-Day messenger who brought it yeah you know the other night I was listening brother Jackie's saying bro I'll tell you what brother Jackie I don't know where to start about brother Jackie brother Jackie his no doubt LED thousands thousands of people to the Lord and influenced Millions but Brothers Jackie his life has said more than every single sermon he's ever preached his life has said more than any one any any message that he ever preached brother Jackie could never preach one sermon that would be better than the life that he lived God still has those well brother Jackie has done is what you and I are supposed to do not going to the jungles where no man's Gone Going Places where and take the gospel to people that nobody's ever heard where they've never heard it that ain't what our job is God didn't call us God didn't call us to go spread the gospel around the world but he called us to spread the gospel so what is the gospel the gospel is by definition it is the good news the Glad Tidings that what we're told it's the Glad Tidings which you know the in the New Testament you said they want to spread the gospel the Glad Tidings of Christ that was what they were commissioned to do to testify what Christ has done in your life Bill Brown said question and answers this is the one that I found last night while I was studying and said since a child I've always known that there was a god and though there was something happening in my life and that's beyond any question but let me say this there will come a message and there will come a messenger I believe that if it is to be a man it'll be somebody after me and don't let that stumble you he said if if there will come a message after me if don't put a period there and stop we've got too many periods on too many quotes don't put a period there and stop I believe if the it's to be a man it'll be somebody after me but this message that I'm preaching is the true message of this day and it's the last message you see what I'm doing brother I'm putting you all in the same place I am the same place you are messengers of this same message there you are your commission go do it we can dismiss that's your commission God's going to hold you to that you are to preach the same message he preached with your life you are to be a messenger of this last age message you've got no excuse so if Christ has set us about in your heart your life will scream louder than any words you can say there's nothing you can say there's nothing I can say this morning that could say anything louder than the Life of Christ in my life in your life you can witness to people you can you can tell them this you can tell them that they're going to watch your life when you be careful when you witness to somebody be careful that whenever you witness to somebody you're living what you're witnessing to when you tell people this is where I go to church this is my pastor this is what I believe I believe in the in The Seventh-Day messenger Malachi 4 and 5. and they go find books they go find messages they start streaming your church and then they watch you at work they watch your life are they seeing what you said you belong to that's the message of this age that's the message that we're supposed to be telling other people how can you bring other people in If You Don't Preach to them now be careful everything I say today don't cross it up with me talking about using your mouth when you get up in the morning you should be ready to preach without opening your mouth my son's over here and he's he's finding out ways to mimic me when I get home he does he makes fun of me so well don't make fun of me but he mimics me dad you do this I hope every one of y'all get one like Kim ah don't confuse the message with your beliefs do not confuse this message with your beliefs people let their beliefs guide them they love their beliefs they love their opinions of this message they love their opinions of God they love their opinions of you they love their opinions of people and that what leads them that what what do you think we've got radicals today in politics and all that radicals because they love their beliefs they love their beliefs they don't love their God if you love God you will let God guide you instead of your beliefs don't let your beliefs your beliefs some many times beliefs come with the wrong spirit that's the Muslims comes with the wrong spirit and they believe 100 that what they're doing is right they believe it that's the message that's the message they're preaching with their lives just their beliefs don't confuse what you believe as far as I hope these beliefs you know in my heart this is what I believe and I believe I believe that let God guide you sometimes your beliefs and your opinions might be wrong why do you think Peter cut off the guy's ear Peter's beliefs this was God's Almighty son right here and nobody was going to take him that was Peter's beliefs this you're not going to take him you're not going to kill him you're not he's not he don't have to die that was Peter's beliefs when he he told him you know that he had to to die they didn't want to believe it but that was their beliefs God's beliefs God's way don't line up with our beliefs sometimes the scripture that I read you this morning go into all the world and preach the gospel for years even as an adult I thought before before I was called to preach I thought I had to go find people and witness to them well they liked it or not that's true that was my belief I believe that's what I had to do was to tell people that hey if you heard of brother Branham you know introducing to people this message with that tactic of telling them about brother Brandon has turned many people away many people away whether brother Branham come to do Point him to Christ so we're supposed to be preaching the same message that he preached Point him to Christ hahaha being zealous of your beliefs brings wrong Spirit many times being led by the holy spirit will never lead you wrong never brings the wrong spirit Revelation 12 10. I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength the kingdom of our God the power of of Christ for the accuser of our Brothers cast down which accused them before God before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death this was the Bible Way they loved not their own lives unto death that was the Bible Way you say that was in the Bible that was the martyrs we're in the Bible Way but I got to looking at that and said by the word of their testimony and I looked in John we've read John 1 1 the beginning of the word was with in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God if you look in the Greek it's the same in the word of their testimony and in the Word was God is the same word so what was the word of their testimony it was God what is the word of your testimony it's God it always is he will always be your testimony that's how you live your life by God so the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us right but what did what did the word when he become flesh what did he say I go away but how come again and I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what else did he say Greater Works than this shall you do you say I've never raised the death you might you your life might have raised somebody that was spiritually dead it's not all about going out to a funeral and standing over a coffin and praying and raising somebody up you're better off dead in the flesh and have God than to be spiritually dead it's a greater work to raise somebody that's spiritually dead it's a greater work because the one that's laying here in the coffin that's not him anyway that's not her anyway they've received ultimate healing but your life the life you live there's many of you in here could can get up and testify right now about people coming up to you and asking you where do you go to church what do you believe this that different things in your life because they watched you what did they watch they watched your sermon they heard your life they heard your life your life is speaking if we realize that when we get up in the morning that when I walk out the door and I go to school and I go to work and I go here and I go there people are going to hear your life you think maybe that might make us more weary of how we Act how we treat others how we treat our family our wives our husbands our kids because people are watching is the life that you're living at home the same life that you're living in front of people are you living the same life are you preaching at home what you're preaching to people where you work with is your wife looking you as the message being spoke is your husband looking at you as the message that's being spoke come on a messenger of this message is a 24 7 Commission 365. there's no days off there's no days off I got the when I got the stadiums I got to thinking your life is two books two books we look at it many times as the old man and the new man God wrote a book about you before the foundation of the world that book has no beginning and no ending it always will be there but Satan's kept a book of you too when you took your first breath he began to writing you say not me brother Joe I was raised in a Christian home I've served God all my life let me tell you a little chapter in your book that Satan's got you came into the world speaking lies born in sin shaped in iniquity you came from a sin birth because the result direct result of the Fall right all the mistakes and failures in your life you think God has those in his book when God looks at Satan's book of your life it's blank God can't read Satan's book of you he can't he has to look through the blood right so when I just read to you that he is the accuser of the brethren day and night he is going before God with your book in his hand and saying look at this chapter look at this page where he done this where she done that God says that looks like all empty pages to me I don't see nothing but that's still your book I still got your name on it your Earthly name God's got one with your Eternal name on it Satan don't want to see that one he's accuser of the brethren and so many times in our life we revert back to a page in Satan's book we make a mistake we fall this book will always be there you get saved get the whole field of the Holy Ghost that book's still there it's still there you say well I I killed the old man you're still dragging him around he might be dead but you're dragging him around yeah if y'all if y'all have if you don't understand that brother Donnie preached a sermon many years ago am I dragging that old Roman soldier around right go back and listen to it I can't preach the way he preached it but I can tell you you're dragging an old man around he might be dead but he stinks and you know he's there and sometimes that old stinky nature wants to rise up sometimes every once in a while we put an AED on him right we try to resuscitate him we do you say brother Joe how do you do that well where should we start when Satan pulls out a little page of you if you remember when you did this and you like oh Lord I forgot or you think it was something way back in the day and it was really cool how you did this and you start talking about the old things you did how you did that how you did this what I did when I was in the bar when I did when I was in the world all the things that you did you start talking about them like you know hey the devil takes a page of your book all the time and gets you to read it all the time he's a messenger too he's got a job he's got a message to preach to you you think he's going to say they got the Holy Ghost can't bother them he's right but God allows him Satan can only do to you what God allows don't ever forget that he don't have free reign at you anytime he wants go back and read Joe you'll understand what will our book read to others let's say we're expressing these two books in our life those you work with which book are they reading your wife just bring it home what book is your wife reading about you husbands what's she reading could she look at your life and say that lines up right with the message that lines up with exactly what what the prophet said his life the way he treats me the way he treats the kids let me tell you explain something to you there's no third book there's no third book there's not a book that's your way so if you was doing something wrong say if you was a a deadbeat dad whatever I hope nobody here is he had another kids nothing to do with your wife it's just the way you were and say your pastor called you in and wanted to talk to you about it and he accused you of living out Satan's book and you would say no there's no way no way what can you honestly say that you're not living it the way the message the message that God sent you to live it no I can't say that but I'm not there's no middle there's no middle your brother Brandon brother Brandon said there's only two forces at work in your life two once of God ones of hell so if you're not live as a husband if you're not living up to what brother Branham said to be or there's the Bible said to be what did Jesus say what did what did Paul say love your wife as Christ loved the church the church is God's Queen it's a birth the bride you get married you go in your honeymoon are you gonna lay around tell your wife hey go cook me some eggs don't go sure go do this start start cleaning up not expressing no love not expressing anything what kind of honeymoon would that be wives are you the kind of wife that lines up with this message hey we're all friends and family are you the kind of wife that could say I I am that Proverbs 31 Woman I am I am the way that Jesus said for the bride to address the groom It's A Love Affair It's A Love Affair can we say that if you're not if you're the wife and you says well he won't do this he you know he's cold on the Lord he's lukewarm okay you be the message to him husband you be the message to her you know I when I was studying this I got to think of the brother when brother Brandon told that story about that that drunk sinner that brought his friends home with him he's going to show him what a wife he had made her go in there and cook for him when they're cooking brought it to me like he threw it on the floor started yelling at her cussing at her she got down her hands and knees began to clean it up wanted to give him more she led them all to the Lord without opening her mouth never opened her mouth we always have something to say we want to be heard well my husband won't listen to me my wife won't listen to me show him the message leave the message in front of them that is the greatest thing on the face of the Earth you could do this counseling session is free it won't cost you a dime don't cost you a thing be the message that's what you were commissioned to do but Brandon said he was to pass that way brother random gets a little deep breath here I don't but he gets a little deep so you decipher it and so a good Praying Wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of God on her knees than sometimes the preacher can do on the platform that's deep in big words that's as plain as he'd be I don't like I don't like getting in people's lives because it's impossible for me to get in people's lives when I study and not get in my own be a perfect testimony of what God speaks through your life are we fathers this is me this is something that I got to looking at and I got a quote here that this really struck me you know we're to express the message to our children and some of you new fathers with new kids mothers even I want to look at the fathers here because you're the head of the home right you're the head of the home your wife's The Fifth Gospel but are we living the testimony one thing that always struck me was I would come in here at church and listen how things about the message and then I'd go out you know my son started getting in teenage years and and stuff and I thought and I got to thinking you know they're understanding things now and what they're hearing do they see that in me do they see the same message they hear on Wednesday let me tell you I fail so much as a death I failed many times I have sat just sat by myself many times at work driving down the road at home thinking of decisions I made actions I did with my kids sometimes thought why why did I do that why did I act that way then I got thinking God's a father too God's the father the greatest lesson that we could learn is how many times has he pulled us back in when we've made mistakes we've made failures as his kids and I thought Lord I want to be the kind of Dad now y'all know me and I've drove my kids crazy because they're my hobby I love them I do if they're doing something my first spit and I want to watch that's it a minister I have drove listen crazy I'm sure he's free now so for a little bit but they're my life they did things because I liked it more than they liked it showed their love for me that's the way God does God's love for you overlook the things in your life God lets you do things you want to do sometimes just because you want to do them just because he loves you but are we living the message as far as the message of this last Tahiti our kids seeing that or are your kids looking to somebody else are they looking for that message somewhere else they're going to get a message somewhere they're going to learn a message from somebody and let me tell you right now dads you better be involved in your kid's life you're in a society now that teaches them everything under the sun and you're a bad parent if you don't allow it according to them you better be this message right now in this age more than any other age you're in a society where it's all about me It's All About Me Society the people in today's society one and whatever anybody can give them they feel the government owns them owes them they feel the world owes them and they're going to take that's the message they're sending out that's the message the world's receiving and they're giving it hahaha sometimes we have to live out a page of the old book for God to open our eyes to see the chapter in the new book yeah yeah sometimes the old book brother Joel has to come at play in our life a mistake a fault of failure sometimes you got to be flat on your back so you can look up and God's holding this book right above you and says this is what you should have done the whole time what is your book reading which one are you reading the most but people today they want all the attention is no exception people in the in the message nowadays they want attention preachers they want to be in a certain big preacher big name preacher group I care less God didn't call me a big preacher group I'm a help all lowercase letters I help if I don't want to be any more than that I don't want to be no more than that there might be guys out here that think you know they're gonna get better recognition if they're with this group of preachers or this group of preachers guess what group I'm in biggest name preacher of all that's what group I'm in Christ that's the biggest name out there [Applause] but we want to give glory to men and and that's sometimes it's not the preacher's fault you get people you could tell when people are stuck on one preacher they'll follow him everywhere he goes if he goes on special meetings they go everywhere that's who that's the preacher they quote all the time they forgot how to spell brother Branham they quote that preacher all the time brother so-and-so said this brother so and so said that brother so and so said this what'd the Bible say God gives gifts he gives Talent to people and people want to steal the glory for it they want to steal the glory that's the message they're sending it's about me I did this I did that what did God do what message are you giving people that you did so and so you laid hands on so and so you sing this song you wrote this song and you want everybody to give you the glory who gave you the talent who gave you the gift that's the part we forget it's given of God what do you think happened to the children of Israel they gave glory to an image that they made they gave Glory God's glory and God destroyed them that spirit is still alive that's it's not changed brother Graham said at 59 when Jesus was here on Earth all things he did he gave God all the glory Jesus gave God all the glory all of it not 99 percent for God to use you he has to empty you of you he has to empty you you have to be a willing vessel so it's not you to start with it's not you to start with it's God using the vessel guys want to get glory for laying hands on somebody and praying for them they get healed of cancer I prayed for this person and they got healed I I I we it's all about God from from the very first scripture I read it's all about God this message that you were supposed to be the messenger of it's all about God Brandon said the mighty conqueror but you see it didn't last because if a man is to conqueror his objectives must be right and motives must be right what are your objective motives and objectives to bring glory to yourself to let everybody know who you are to let everybody know what you did is that your motive I'll read a little more and if you don't play the game fair you're bound to lose no matter how much conqueror you are you have to follow the rules of the game to be a winner if you cheat you're put out of the game no matter how good player you are so Hitler never followed the rules what an example he wanted all the power to himself he wanted all the glory to himself therefore his objective was wrong any man that has those motives and objectives I'm gonna go ahead and stop right there might not want me to read that last part we'll end up just like Hitler did it's quite an example you might say I am giving God the glory is your wife is your life expressing that is your life expressing I'm giving God the glory is your mouth expressing I'm giving God the glory can people look at you and see your humble spirit your Meek and contrite spirit are they seeing somebody that's boastful prideful boastful prideful it's all from hell you can turn it any way you want to your tear and pay you're bringing in Reading pages off your old book all glory goes to God brother Brian said how can I overcome remember your life will testify louder than your mouth what you live will prove to people more than what you say sometimes Satan's going to use somebody else's life to influence you Satan's going to use somebody else's message in their life to influence you you think well Joe how does that happen go ask somebody that still says they believe this message but don't come to church well because there's too many hypocrites there's too many Hypocrites you know why they say that they got nothing else they got nothing else so basically you're allowing Satan to use somebody's message and you're fulfilling it you're fulfilling it you're taking the message they're preaching to you because you're looking at their life oh lord they're claiming to be a Christian they're doing that they're doing this and they're preaching their life is preaching to you and you're accepting it you're accepting it you're fulfilling a page in their book that Satan wrote about them why don't you come to church and you influence them with the right message if they're being a hypocrite maybe God wants you to come in and you can preach your life to them let your life speak to them I'm going down here and it says close them to wind it down influence now you know there is somebody that you are influencing your life has a written epistle read of all man therefore if your life isn't according to your testimony or your testimony according to your life rather you are putting a stumbling block in somebody's way for somebody is watching you some little child is watching his mother watching his dad your life's going to be contagious one way or the other it's going to be contagious if your life is preaching this word this message if it's preaching the same message when you buy yourself as it is when you're in church you're going to be contagious but if your life is preaching something different you're still going to be contagious because people are watching you your kids are watching you they're watching how Mom and Daddy interact they're watching how dad treats mom and Mom treats dad there's got to be a life there has to be a life that speaks what is what is that life going to speak it's going to speak the name of Jesus Christ your life preaches Christ that's what the message is right that's what brother Branham pointed everyone to that's what his whole the Malachi 4 and 5 was to come to turn the hearts back right for what the name of Jesus Christ amen the name above all names you know I was studying this I got to thinking of Mary in Elizabeth and I got to thinking how Mary Gabriel told Mary you're going to have a child you know how all that went then he tells her to go see Elizabeth the Bible says she gave salutations unto Elizabeth and took a prophet to come say what those salutations were he said that was the first time the name of Jesus Christ was spoke on human lips I'm going to have a son but Graham says she says are you married oh no no but he says it's not it's of God and Elizabeth catches that and calls her the mother of my Lord oh but the thing that got me the most was the name when she spoke it life coming to a dead baby life it was the message that Mary brought and wasn't me it wasn't the message Mary brought to Elizabeth wasn't about herself she wasn't telling her this is about me this is about Jesus that was the message she conveyed to Elizabeth and Life coming to that dead baby there had to be a life in there for life to come in there when you express your life to someone else for them to receive it they have to have that same life it may lay dormant for years anybody lay dormant for many years and that name was spoken to that seed that's in there they're predestinated ordained oh when when I think of predestination and how long a dormant seed can lay in there I always think of when brother Brandon went to the other side and that young woman came up to him woman comes up to him said brother Brown do you remember me he said no I don't said you baptized me led me to the Lord when I was 90 years old 90. she was predestinated to receive a message she was predestinated for to receive a message of the name that name was said he said she said you led me to Christ to Christ that was the message he gave her nine years old if that seed had never been in there if it had never been there it would have never received that message go listen deep call to the Deep I've said that here 100 times it's a free destination before you can receive brother brother when you come in the message it was something that spoke from here to something that was in there before the foundation of the world and when you took your first breath of life when you took your first breath of life God put it in there and said one day somebody's going to have an influence on that seed there's going to be a messenger come and that messenger might be Larry Elliott look brother Robin Larry tell you that story sometime it's a life and Strikes something if that's seed there's something you think there's something about that person something about him is speaking to me I've got to talk to him why it's kindred it's the same name in here that's in there and you didn't realize it was there were called to be Messengers why it had to be Shepherds the Holy Ghost the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary and told her she was going to have a baby knowing no man told her about Elizabeth's conditions she went up to the hills of Judea to tell Elizabeth and when she met Elizabeth she told her she was going to be a mother she couldn't understand it knowing no man but she said the Holy Spirit overshadowed me and this holy thing that'll be born of me will be called the son of God and I'll call his name Jesus and that the first time the name Jesus was ever spoken on a human lip a little dead baby in his mother's womb leaped for joy and shouted foreign actually said John received the Holy Ghost right then he received the Holy Ghost so if you ever answer your question if anybody could be born with the Holy Ghost and jumped in the womb of a mother and it never had received life yet the name of Jesus Christ spoke life unto a dead baby what it ought to do in a church that claims to be born again the name of Jesus just to name Jesus what it ought to do to a church that says I'm born again I got the honor several years ago and I'm not going to call their names they wouldn't want me to anyway I got the honor of baptizing a young sister in our church she'd been backsliffed her testimony was what her husband had she wanted she said I want one he's got he's not a breacher one of the most godliest men in this church got one of the sweetest spirits what she had for a moment God closed the Satan's book and said it's your time it's your time and what was in her husband's life spoke to her and said I want that what he's got I want what he's got that's how a message in our life is preached he didn't get up every morning and brown beater and say you better get saved he didn't say you're not seeing our kids so you get saved he lived he got up in the morning went to church went to work a Christian came home a Christian went to bed a Christian got up the next morning a Christian it's as simple as that don't complicate it it's as simple as that it's a life that's lived it's a life that you live that people can hear his life spoke the name of Jesus and there was a seed of life in her that responded that that might be the way it happened with many of us the name speaks to us the woman at the well Jesus said I am he that speaks to thee I am he she knew one was coming we've heard we've heard the ones come I'm he it touched her then what did she do she went and told the whole city the whole city turned out because of her testimony so your life might touch one person or many your host school maybe look how this nation was touched recently over an injury on the football field for the first time on ESPN you had a guy bowed his head and prayed and said God's name and nobody said anything about it there's power in that name I don't care whose lips it comes off of you say well they don't belong to the message there's power in that name amen let's Stand Together [Applause] sometimes we need to tell the devil you all heard people say I'm not talking to people I'm not wasting my breath on him well Jesus talked to him you know you you hear you know a lot of the times people get that because they say you know I don't uh you know you shouldn't confess things well I'm not talking about confessing you know if doctor tells you have cancer you say I'm not confessing that I totally agree don't say that don't say it out loud I got cancer you know if you don't want to say it don't say it but when God said you can be healed of cancer why don't you tell him that why don't you tell him you know Satan can put thoughts in your mind but he can't read your thoughts so brother Ram said you get a thought here don't speak it you can't read your thoughts but if you're thinking hey I'm going to be cancer hey God's going to save my kid God's going to save my son going to save my daughter he's going to deliver say it out loud let him hear it tell him about it speak that name to him Jesus said Greater Works than this shall you do let him know don't just keep it to yourself if you don't want to tell nobody else at least for for goodness sake tell the devil let him know what his end is let him know that you've beat cancer amen let him know that you've been saved let him know that you've been delivered delivered of spirits and whatever he's the one who gave them to you so let him know I'm not taking them you know brother Donnie she's referenced so many times about the box of rattlesnakes send it back providing a big note on top of
