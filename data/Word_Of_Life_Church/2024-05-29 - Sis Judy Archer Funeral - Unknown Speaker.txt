be with this service Lord Comfort the family and the friends and may all that's done be pleasing to you for it's in thy hands we commit Judy and the family and this service in Jesus name Amen on behalf of the family I would like to thank each of you for taking the time to call and to text thank you for the cards thank you for the food that you brought us thank you for dropping by the house to visit with us and from the bottom of our hearts we thank you for coming and being a part of this service to celebrate the life of Judy Gail Ward Archer Judy was my sister she and my brother Dell were twins but she's also like a second mother growing up we were poor and Mom had to work to help out the family and jitty being the older sister by 5 years jitty took care of Dwayne and Dale and me my mom was at work she would cook for us and watch over us and that motherly Instinct that she had for us went right over into adulthood she was always calling in checking on us Judy was a loving and caring mother to Carrington and Eric and as a Grammy to her grandkids Kensington and Logan Eli Ethan and Lauren she was the best she was involved in their lives going to all their special events and showing her commitment to her family and even though Judy was Jessica and Allison's aunt she was also like a grandmother to them because my mom died many year ago and when they were young and Judy kind of took the row of filling in for Mom when shl and I went out of town Judy would stay with the girls a lot and they would head to the dollar Tre to load up on junk food and Blow Pops and pizza have a night of karaoke and when we come back home we found two spoiled kids when Aiden was born Judy was just Smitten by him my my grandson and even the last few days of her life when he'd come to see her she was just light up and grin ear to ear she would just hug on him and love on him she was the best and although jimy never had a lot of money she'd never let it stop her from trying to make sure that everyone had a gift for their birthday and for Christmas and she would take thought in trying to find a gift that she thought you could really use one memory that the family often brings up is jitty's chiropractic skills when she was younger she worked for a caropractor here in town and so every holiday birthday party family get together after we eat we'd all line up and she'd have us in the floor rubbing on sore muscles and adjusting backs it was a family tradition even for Cheryl's family jitty's favorite scripture was Isaiah 41:10 she said the the Lord had given her that scripture several year ago and it had been her go-to scripture ever since and along about 2020 she was on a call service at the VA hospital where veterans would call in to make appointments and Judy told me she got a call one day and that the man on the phone told her that the Lord had told him to call this number and when the person answered to tell them that the Lord told me to give you this scripture and she said before the man ever started reading the scripture she knew what it was Isaiah 41:10 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness she said she hung up the phone and rededicated her life to the Lord Judy had a great sense of humor she loved to laugh and most of her times together was spent just laughing and even when she would call or come by to discuss something that was important we'd end up laughing and cutting up some of my favorite memories and I was looking at some of the comments that people had said about jitty on Facebook and I'd like to share just a few jimy was one of the selfless persons you'd ever meet she always put everyone above of herself she would always buy and give gifts to people and when you tried to give her something for it she wouldn't take it Judy was one of the sweetest persons I knew always caring for others another one said Judy was a rare Jewel she was such a wonderful sweet and Beautiful Soul JY always let her light shine she never wavered in her faith and jimy had many heartaches and many disappointments in life but it never stopped her smile or wavered her faith and when they told her that she was terminal she never stopped believing that God would heal her she told me I'm a winner either way if I go I'm ready or if I stay I will go with you and testify of the god that heals she placed her life in the hands of the god who cannot fail go rest high Judy your work on Earth is done we'll see you again on that morning and as long as there's a memory of you you will always be in our hearts I am so thankful that you have gathered with your people we love you thank you for being such a wonderful sister

all I will do is forever [Music] forever worship [Music] you I Can Only [Music] Imagine certainly wish to extend our condolences to the family and friends I'd like to read to you from Genesis chapter 3 verse 9 and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself I'd like to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on facing man's greatest fear probably most of us in this building tonight have all different types of fears we can fear Heights we can fear water Darkness falling failure sickness plagues pestilences but yet when it comes right down to it the greatest of all fears are death if you get pneumonia a good doctor good treatment they catch it fast enough good chance you'll recover many of you probably had covid you're recovered but when you go into death there's no recovery unless you've been vaccinated by eternal life whenever we think of our precious sister and the journey of her life as brother Daryl's already said she had many ups and downs like most of us sicknesses and heartaches disappointments and people disappointments no doubt in herself but yet the thing with the Christian is that we're able to come back and find where our hope is but what I find amazing for a child of God is that when man's greatest fear strikes them they look at it totally different now the parallel between this is because the Lord Jesus himself actually feared death which is the opposite of what his children will do the Bible tells us in Hebrews 5:7 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard that he feared Jesus Christ feared death you see he was going to die a curse in the sight of God he was going to die out of his presence he was going to die on a horrible horrible cross but he died out of the presence of God so we wouldn't have to he died fearing and trembling so Jesus Christ the perfect sinless Lamb of God died afraid but let me tell you something tonight sister Judy didn't die afid brother darl was just telling me a few moments ago before we come out of the office how it was that she left she was not screaming crying begging for another moment of life I don't want to go I don't want to go I'm lost I'm lost but instead she faced man's greatest fear and wasn't afraid so it's hard for us to imagine the sitting here in in the Book of Genesis that man for the first time experienced fear he never felt it before must have been overwhelming knowing that he had done wrong and had displeased his father and he hears the voice of God come walking in the garden of the cool of the day as the Bible says and he went and hid himself then God comes running to the Garden screaming Adam Adam where are you he's wanting him to come out himself but after man falls it's not in himself to do that so father came looking for him and he gets these words out of his mouth I heard your voice and I was afraid so just to meet God In the Garden in the afternoon instilled such a fear in man he didn't even want to meet him that way can you imagine then living your life the way that we live ours all of our mistakes all of our failures all of our shortcomings and then we have to meet God naturally shouldn't it terrify us shouldn't it make us so afraid that we cannot even think about meeting God how is it then that people die all the time and they don't fear man's greatest fear but the answer is what the first Adam lost the second Adam retrieved retrieved but he had to experience fear and deaths himself so that were you face it I face it as children of God we don't have to be afraid David said it this way in Psalm 23:4 ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thy rod and thy staff they comfort me you see these are status symbols of a Shepherd his rod and his staff so to a sheep the rod and the staff are status symbols of their protector that he will fight and give his life to protect him a lion a bear a Jackle whatever it would be that would come against them the rod and the staff and the hand of a loving Shepherd he would give his last drop of blood which is exactly what Our Shepherd did he did not want you or me or sister Judy when it come down to facing deaths to have to be so terrified and believe it or not death is actually the easier part for it's appointed unto men once to die then after that the judgment but there's something unnerving about death needless to say none of us have been there all we've known is life we've known sickness and maybe you've been so sick at times you thought you were going to die but once we go into the channel of death is there a way out is there a way back or once we are there is not our destiny determined for as that tree lean and it falls whether it's toward God or away from God there's no way to change it man moves by this passage of deaths into that spot no wonder people are terrified no wonder they're so afraid because in death you cannot change your mind our minds must be made up now again Hebrews 2:9 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste deaths for every man maybe there's some people here tonight and you don't s serve him you don't know him you have no desire to and he knew you would or would not and still he tasted death for you so that whenever you come to where Judah did that you won't have to scream and be horrified by death in verse 14 Paul goes on to say for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that has the power of death that is the devil here we set tonight and we're under the influence of two different dimensions what happened a few days ago when sister Judy Drew her last breath in the sixth Dimension were're saints of God go it was so different than the way it was in the room where this family were tears running out of their eyes and grabbing one another and holding her hand and all of that that was the influence of these four dimensions here that we see but if we could have been able to look into the dimension where she now lives what a contrast and as the Bible tells us precious in the sight of the Lord is the deaths of his Saints precious you mean a child of God dying is precious to to the lord well was it precious to all them in one way yes and another way no you could ask any of these family members tonight I feel I could freely answer for them would they want her to come back and that same old body that she had suffered so much in would they want her to come back in this same house that she had had so much hardship and troubles in life there is no way they would call her back into this same house Paul tells us being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself speaking about Jesus and became obedient unto deaths even the deaths of the Cross so he screams he cries the anointing leaves him in the Garden of [Music] Gethsemane they put him on the cross and they drive those Nails into his hands they've already placed the crown of thorns on his head which was Victor's Thorns they called them from 6 to 9 in long they placed it down on his head with sticks so they themselves would not get stuck with them by the time he goes to the Cross his head is swollen nearly twice the size that it would have been normally his body is in such Agony he's thirsty bursting his blood pressure is fluctuating up and down his heart all that he went through why for you for me so when I die I won't have to experience that that I will be able to draw my breaths and know that when my last one is drawn in a few moments I'll be on the other side you see whenever we think about deaths whether you're rich or poor famous or inFAMOUS let me give you a few words of some great people Elizabeth I queen of England died in 1603 all my possessions she said would I give for a moment of time all my possessions would I give for a moment of time now we're not talking about a beggar I talk about somebody living on the street but a king a wife of a great king who was dominating the world at that time no doubt had lavish Lifestyles some of the greatest food that you'd want to eat in a palace that was so beautiful of the finest clothes money could buy gold silver gems rubies diadems all types of things all around her and she would trade it all for one moment of time Henry VII king of King of England died in 1547 All Is [Music] Lost now this man had lived his own life out of the economy of God now he's facing man's greatest fear and he says All Is Lost and these are his last three words monks monks monks and he takes his life breath why is he so fearful he's a great man he's got gold silver plenty of money servants but you see death has the ability of putting us all on the same level you ever seen anybody's Cadillacs and their caskets keys to their BMWs or Porsches or whatever it is they drive their Worth or tit it's worth nothing in that world that is to come Andrew Jackson United States president died 1845 oh do not cry be good children and we will all Meet in Heaven General Thomas Stonewall Jackson 1863 let us cross over the river and sit in the shade of the trees facing man's greatest fear but look at the difference in what people say when they face it some wanting another moment another hour Edgar Allan pole you know of him died October the 7th 1849 Lord help my poor [Music] soul lord help my poor soul what good did all of his ability to write poetry doing when it come down to facing man's greatest fear Sir Francis Newport head of the English infidel Club said to those gathered around his death bed do not tell me there is no God for I know there is one and that I am in his angry presence you need not tell me there is no hell for I already feel my soul slipping into its fires wretches cease your idle talk about there being hope for me I am lost forever but isin it comforting family members that wasn't what you heard from the lips of sister Judy I'm lost forever there's no hope for me but just Breeze and Breeze and G facing man's greatest fear David Hume the famous atheist cried I'm in Flames I'm in Flames voler the famous skeptic died a terrible death his nurse said all the money for all the money in Europe I wouldn't want to see another unbeliever die for all night long he cried for forgiveness now in comparison to a lot of these people sister Judy is not going to leave a lot of gold lot of silver a crown of royal purple robe but she leaves behind a legacy which is absolutely Beyond price her memory as brother Daryl has done said will live on and when you all think of her you may not think as Edgar alen Poe as the Queen of England or the king of England but you have been affected each of us by the life she lived let me read you one more Sir Thomas Scott Scott once the president of the English lower house said up until this time I thought there was no God Nor Hell now that I feel that there are both I am delivered to predition by the righteous Judgment of almighty God on her desk bed Queen Victoria told those around her that she loved God and was his little child and she was ready to die she then called for the hymn To Be Sung Rock of Ages Cliff for me let me hide myself in thee are you sure Victoria you're going Beyond the Veil you can never come back is Immortal again you don't know for sure what's there scientifically we can't prove that there's a God scientifically we can't prove to you people who believes that that there is a heaven we've never sent a satellite there we have no jets that can go there and come back so are you sure we're sure because our lord Jesus went there for us and he come back or he say how can you know that preacher all of them disciples gave all of their lives do you think they would have done that if they would have thought he was an impostor they would have died they hung Andrew on a cross in the form of an ex the priest of Greece beat Mark with Fuller's clubs on and on we could go talking about those men who walked with him if he was a fake why would they have given their all now let me leave this world for just a moment and share a little bit with you from that world where our sister has gone she's not been gone that long from our side but again in reality we know that there is another world by which those which are prepared go into the presence of God and they are not a disembodied Spirit but according to the scripture they have a body which is prepared before the foundation of the world I imagine by now that sister Judy has already seen many of the Saints I'm reminded of a story that we are told and it was a sister that had sung many songs and blessed many people and our Prophet stood and said her great talent and gift now God has called home her Daddy went before her and her mama went before her this is what came to me the other day brother Daryl when you call me and told me that sister Judy was gone and he says Mom and Daddy call their baby home so we know then when we cross that River we don't have to cross it screaming hollowing as if we are lost but the Lord God sends someone down by the river for us and whenever they look beyond the curtain and they step out as it were of The Old Ship of Zion there those loved ones appear by now no doubt she's already met her daddy her mama her loved ones people here in the church that she's fellowshipped with no doubt she's already met my little girl that just passed over in October and if I could ask either of them tonight would they want to come back no no doubt brother Homer Arnold's already met her and they done embrac and my precious sister my precious brother oh and think of it they're not going anywhere they're in no hurry they don't have really anything to do on their schedule they're just there waiting under the altar but is this the end will we never see her again well you see that entirely depends upon you I will see her again because I have the same preparation but you will only see her again if you have the same preparation she does I always Marvel when I preach funerals and people will cry and they will lament over that lost loved one oh we don't want you to go we don't want you to go please don't leave we don't want you to go and yet they make no preparation to see them again I guess I don't understand that kind of love it looks like to me if we really really loved them we would want to be with them forever you hear me forever the life our sister has entered into she will never have an ache or a pain or a sorrow or a broken heart she has faced man's greatest fear and she laughed in death's face no doubt she knew it was coming the Grim Reaper as we call it came he must be he must still get confused because he's he's took billions of people down this alley this Avenue called deaths but there's some he just don't understand them he he he took them years ago in the Roman coliseums and the Arenas when the lines were taking their claws and tearing their bows out when they would take their head and cut it off and Nero would take these Christians and have their bodies dipped in Pitch tar t a r and put them up on a cross and light them so he could walk through his garden at night with illuminated human bodies and them children of God not recanting not fearful Young imagine when that Grim Reaper that angel of death comes and he comes into a hospital room or a hospice room or by a bedside and he looks at him and thinks oh no not another one of them what is wrong with these people I've been with Kings and presidents and governors and Mayors and guys that work for the CIA and the Marine Corps and the Army and the military scream and and clinch their fists and bite their teeth together when they come to die and then I've seen little old frail grandmothers that were nobody's and they would look me in the face and say come on do what you need to do cuz you are not my master but I am yours so come on you know what death is it's like your vehicle your vehicle brought you to this service tonight so you went out push the button or crank the key whichever yours is you got in that vehicle pulled it down and drive and it drove you here in a little bit you'll be going back in it taking you the same way that's all death is to a child of God we stand there and look at it and say hey I am not afraid of you let me close the question is for those of us who are alive tonight when you face man's greatest fear how will you face it will you be screaming begging for mercy or will you be like sister chy you'll breathe and the time will lapse and lapse between another and then finally they didn't see it but her soul went out of her body into another dimension and there she's waiting for us tonight let's bow our heads if you would Lord Jesus we are so grateful truly it's a Marvel Adam was terrified to stand in your presence yet since you came to the Earth and gave your life and redeemed us from the fear of death millions of your children have not faced you in a garden but they faced man's greatest fear some of them were shot some of them were burned some of them died by diseases plagues pestilences but no matter how they faced him they all had the same attitude because you took the fear away I we thank you for the life of our sister father I pray for her family her friends the church family here Lord I was so startled a couple of months ago and maybe six weeks ago when she came up for prayer I hadn't seen her for a little bit but she came up and then sister kson came up behind her as I saw sister Judy walk up to the altar here I just could not get over how much that she looked like her mother and I told Carol after the service it just shocked me how much she looked like her mother but I realized after she passed the other day she looks more like her mother now than she ever has no doubt it was them that met her down at the river and when she stepped out of that Old Ship of Zion as we say they run to greet her and they looked at each other and they were about the same age cuz there aren't any old people there no one with gray hair no one that's humped over because of age Lord Jesus I pray that you'd help each of us we're still on this side of the chasm of death help us that we will Choose Wisely May there never be a preacher that'll stand and repeat our words that we said oh God oh God no I'm lost I'm lost but may our words be come Lord Jesus I'm ready May there be words that even in our deaths will testify we have a risen savior granted father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] somewh [Music] and wake up where the clouds are far behind me where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops that's where you find me somewhere over the rainbow bird fly birds fly Over the Rainbow why oh why [Music] can't if happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow oh why oh why can [Music] a [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] all [Music] oh I [Music] I am free author is anonymous don't grieve for me for now I'm free I'm following paths God made for me I took his hand I heard him call then turned and bid farewell to all I could not stay another day to laugh to love to sing to play tasks left undone must stay that way I found my peace at close of play and if my parting left a void then fill it with remember Joy a friendship shared a laugh a kiss ah yes these things I too will miss be not burdened deep with sorrow I wish you sunshine of tomorrow my life's been full I've savored much good friends good times a loved one's touch perhaps my time seemed all too brief don't lengthen it now with grief lift up your hearts and share with me God wants me now he set me free may we all bow our heads at this time in prayer heavenly father I'm reminded of the words of the Prophet when he said how you changed your strain to come and take on the image of a man Flesh and Blood Sorrows weariness pain sure there's joy in there there's Elation there's excitement but Lord that flesh eventually had to die and if you did how are we going to escape it the only way that I know father is to take on that image that you've so freely given to us and oh God it's time Marches On we'll gather again in settings like these to say goodbye our memories will be flooded be so Paramount of what we recall about that one that's gone on they've loosed their Moorings from time and all the trappings of time and oh God if they could look back as it were and have have a voice to penetrate time to where we would be able to hear them I'm sure sister Judy would say something like as we just read in the poem don't grieve I'm just gone from your sight but oh if you could only see what I'm seeing now if you could only feel what I'm feeling now come on come to where I am take on the identity of that one who changed his strain that's what I chose to do so father if there's some sitting here tonight that don't know you in that way I just pray that you'd grip their hearts oh God if they've been playing around on you father may you turn them back as that prodigal or maybe it would be someone that's sitting by a well as that woman did that day she had no clue that eternal life exist existed within her she had no clue she was an eternal being so father may your light illuminate some paths tonight we love you and we thank you oh God even for times like this because it gives us time and opportunity to pause and take inventory of our own lives I pray that you would be a hand of comfort to this family Lord she was a daughter she was a sister she was a friend she was an auntie she was a grandmother she was mom she was a sister in Christ so many things in time but oh God how much more she is today and how much more we can be if we find ourselves hidden in you so may you be that Comfort may you be that arm around the family Lord when the When the Crowds Are Gone when the food is all eaten and the doors close on that last visitor and you're just there with your memories and the tears begin to flow we know how grief is God it comes in waves so Lord be that portion you promised us that you wouldd be a very present help so be that father I pray forgive us where we failed you we give you all honor and glory and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we have one more song tonight that uh brother Joel is going to lead the congregation in if you just remain seated uh brother Rocky is going to escort the family out into the lobby I want to thank all of you for being here this concludes the service for our sister Judy everybody remain seated if you will and the family be dismissed at this time brother Joel go ahead and start singing Once like a bird in prison I dwelt no freedom from my sorrow I felt but Jesus came and listen to me and glory to God he set me free yes he set me free yes he set me free he broke the bonds of prison for me I'm Glory bound my Jesus to see for Glory to God Set Me Free now I am climbing higher each day darkness of night has drifted away my feet are planted on higher ground and glory to God I'm home wordbound oh he he set me free yes he set me free he broke the bonds of prison for me I'm Glory bound my Jesus to see for Glory to God he set me free [Music]
