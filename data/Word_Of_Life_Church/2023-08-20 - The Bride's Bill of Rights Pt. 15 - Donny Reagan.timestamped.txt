[30:54] morning I'm sure most of us if we've
[30:56] been serving the lord very long
[30:59] we know that we have those times when we
[31:02] think morning will never
[31:06] come but is't it amazing it always
[31:11] has 1973 carollyn I hadn't been married
[31:15] very
[31:15] long and a tornado come through down in
[31:19] Kentucky where we
[31:21] lived we lived in a single wide
[31:23] trailer we lived about the way the crow
[31:26] flies Maybe 3/4 of a mile to a mile to
[31:31] where the that tornado hit it was
[31:34] lightning thundering raining wind they
[31:38] found horses in the tops of
[31:41] trees they found woven wire fence that
[31:44] was round up just like that and the
[31:47] fence post were still standing up they
[31:51] found drinking straws thrown into brick
[31:55] houses you've seen and heard of that
[31:58] before but what's amazing was Caroline
[32:02] and I didn't even know it
[32:03] hit we lived in a single wide Traer you
[32:06] can imagine that so we get out the next
[32:08] morning to go to work and we're seeing
[32:11] all this Devastation and thinking what
[32:13] in the world happened several people
[32:16] lost their lives it was a a terrible
[32:19] terrible thing houses destroyed
[32:21] livestock all types of things and yet we
[32:26] were totally unaware of it but there's
[32:29] been other storms I've been through and
[32:32] that you've been through I was well
[32:35] aware I was aware of the loss of life I
[32:38] was aware of the discouragement the
[32:40] sadness and all that went with it how
[32:43] many knows what I'm talking about but
[32:45] whether it's in a storm that God is so
[32:47] protecting you and helping you that you
[32:51] look back and you saying how did I ever
[32:53] make it and then you look at others and
[32:56] think
[32:58] that was
[33:00] close but either way you're going to
[33:03] make it amen aren't you glad we're not
[33:06] here today gathered thinking well maybe
[33:10] I might be able to make it till next
[33:12] Wednesday night no we can have such a
[33:15] relationship with God that no matter
[33:18] what takes place we know beyond a shadow
[33:20] of a doubt he's with us and his plan
[33:23] cannot and will not be destroyed amen
[33:27] and many believes that with all your
[33:29] heart 1 Peter
[33:33] 4:12 we welcome you today in the house
[33:35] of the Lord trust you've come to receive
[33:38] something from God not only to receive
[33:41] but to give something to God our love
[33:44] our adoration our praise our worship 1
[33:48] Peter 4 verse 12
[33:52] beloved think it not
[33:54] strange concerning the fiery tribe
[33:59] which is try to try
[34:01] you so apparently Peter felt like he
[34:04] needed to warn the people of God
[34:07] whenever heavy trials would come that
[34:10] they wouldn't look at it and think this
[34:12] is so
[34:13] strange why am I going through this how
[34:17] could it be
[34:18] allowed that I would deal with such
[34:21] trauma beloved think it not strange
[34:24] concerning the
[34:26] fiery look at the the word fiery what it
[34:30] means a burning the burning by which
[34:34] metals are
[34:37] roasted
[34:39] roasted so they're not just held over
[34:42] the fire and then pull them back but
[34:44] they're actually hung over the fire
[34:46] until they are roasted you know what I'm
[34:49] talking about where you stick a little
[34:50] cream puff marshmallow on the end of
[34:53] your stick and you hold it over the fire
[34:56] and you hold it there until the desired
[35:00] color change has arrived and then you
[35:03] pull it off and try to eat it without
[35:06] scorching your
[35:08] mouth right oh yeah or a hot dog and you
[35:11] stick it on the end of a stick and then
[35:12] it swells and swells and that's probably
[35:15] where some of you are today you're all
[35:17] swollen
[35:19] up but it's because of the fire a
[35:22] burning the burning which metals by
[35:25] which metals are roasted and and
[35:28] reduced by a figure drawn from a
[35:32] Refiner's Fire calamities or
[35:36] trials that test the
[35:41] character but
[35:43] Rejoice oh well that's good that's
[35:46] wonderful you after we're roasted now we
[35:49] Rejoice but rejoice in as much
[35:54] as
[35:55] wow ye are
[35:58] partakers of Christ's
[36:01] sufferings so you can imagine the trial
[36:03] that you go through now not
[36:05] self-inflicted of things that we do to
[36:08] ourself but that he and his wisdom allow
[36:10] us to come to pass and he actually
[36:13] attributes that to a suffering that you
[36:17] have done with him it's as if though you
[36:20] were hanging on a cross and you were
[36:24] being beaten and you were being stucked
[36:27] and you were being chastened that's the
[36:30] way he looks at it when we come through
[36:32] it Faithfully but rejoice in as much as
[36:35] your partakers of Christ sufferings
[36:37] listen to this part that when his glory
[36:40] shall be revealed ye may be glad also
[36:46] praise the Lord with
[36:49] exceeding Joy if you be reproached for
[36:53] the name of Christ happy are ye for the
[36:56] spirit of glory and of God resteth upon
[37:01] you on their part which is those that
[37:04] are not saved on their part he is evil
[37:08] spoken of but on your part he is
[37:12] glorified aren't you glad that's your
[37:14] part today I made a l to be remembered
[37:16] as we pray today let's just bow our
[37:19] heads father we thank you for your word
[37:21] we thank you Lord for the songs that
[37:23] we've sung every prayer request every
[37:25] testimony thus far of the service
[37:28] I pray today Lord that you would help me
[37:30] to be able to get out of the way you
[37:32] alone can be able to custom fit a sermon
[37:35] that'll be able to meet the heart of
[37:37] every hungry person and Lord we know
[37:40] those that are streaming are many times
[37:42] over what's what's here gathered so I
[37:45] pray that you would help me Lord Jesus
[37:48] please help me to move aside help me
[37:51] father that I can be able to get out of
[37:53] the way and speak the words of Life dear
[37:56] God you so the hands that were uplifted
[37:58] signifying a need on many in their
[38:01] hearts and I pray you'd be mindful of
[38:02] them Father you see these prayer calls
[38:05] that I have today it's for three wayward
[38:08] children and their families Lord God we
[38:11] can look around and see the signs of
[38:13] your coming we can see how things are
[38:16] becoming so dark how can we not be
[38:19] concerned about our children our loved
[38:22] ones husband wife whoever it is that's
[38:24] out of the Ark of Safety Lord God be
[38:27] mindful of these three not only them but
[38:30] others are standing here today with
[38:32] friends and loved ones that are lost
[38:34] without you or backslidden would you be
[38:37] mindful Lord God we pray in the name of
[38:39] Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God
[38:43] bless you you may be
[38:48] seated we know the word teaches that no
[38:52] man or no woman that is looking for a
[38:56] companion for life
[38:58] life should make such a decision or such
[39:02] a choice without prayerfully prayerfully
[39:08] considering such a choice that choice
[39:12] can
[39:13] be such Agony and such difficulty in
[39:18] life if it's the wrong one if it's the
[39:21] right one a marriage can be a little bit
[39:24] of Heaven on Earth that's what God
[39:27] intended for it to be marriage is
[39:29] supposed to be a reflection of what
[39:32] heaven is going to be it's miniature
[39:34] Heaven you'll have battles and
[39:36] difficulties of course but you have your
[39:38] husband or wife to be able to help you
[39:41] through those things of life and this is
[39:43] why that we're instructed then before
[39:46] that we would decide on this man or this
[39:48] woman that we want to live the rest of
[39:50] our life with that we don't look so much
[39:53] at their financial status we don't look
[39:56] at where they fit in society how they
[40:00] say their nouns their pronouns you know
[40:02] how they know how to do this and that
[40:05] but are they matched to you as an
[40:08] individual and it really takes the Lord
[40:10] to help us to do that because we are so
[40:13] easily deceived when it comes to our
[40:16] emotions and we can think we're in love
[40:19] with somebody and then it doesn't take
[40:21] you know some people 6 months or a year
[40:23] others three or four years and then they
[40:25] realize that was not the person they
[40:27] thought they getting it all and then
[40:29] they begin to realize what a terrible
[40:32] terrible mistake that they made so we
[40:34] have the guidelines given to us in the
[40:37] word in the message of the hour to help
[40:39] us to be able to make such a decision as
[40:43] you've heard me or other men as they
[40:45] will stand there and go through the
[40:47] wedding things and and they will they
[40:49] will welcome you as the guest and then
[40:51] they will begin to go toward the vows
[40:55] and believing that you have consented
[40:58] toward God and toward yourselves I will
[41:00] now present to you the marriage covenant
[41:03] will you so and so take this woman to be
[41:06] your lawful wetted wife will you love
[41:08] her will you cherish her will you honor
[41:10] her so on and so on and so on and those
[41:13] vows are so easy to say when everybody's
[41:16] standing there and the the dresses are
[41:18] beautiful and the suits are all crisp
[41:21] and clean and pressed but then whenever
[41:23] you put away your beautiful wedding gown
[41:26] and the man takes off his tucks and then
[41:29] he starts wearing his old dirty tennis
[41:31] shoes and he starts taking off his
[41:33] clothes and piling them in a pile you
[41:35] didn't realize he' done that you thought
[41:37] he was a neat Freak no that was only
[41:40] until he got you and then once he got
[41:42] you he's going to revert back to being
[41:44] what he was the same old himy but you
[41:47] see God himself unlike us God has the
[41:50] ability to be able to look forward and
[41:53] to be able to see things that we cannot
[41:56] see and he is able to choose by his own
[42:01] choice who he wants to be in his bride
[42:04] but unlike us we try to choose one that
[42:08] matches us as best as we can and those
[42:11] that we feel like they're be a an area
[42:14] of compatibility and religion an area of
[42:17] compatibility and the way we're going to
[42:19] raise children our finances so on and so
[42:21] on and so on but inevitably there's
[42:23] going to be things that you're going to
[42:25] face in life and a you didn't discussed
[42:27] that did you you did not think about
[42:29] that and here you have your first big
[42:32] argument because you wanted to spend
[42:34] Christmas with your parents and you
[42:37] didn't realize he wanted to spend
[42:38] Christmas with his who live in
[42:42] Arizona so you didn't discuss how the
[42:45] holiday things is going to work out so
[42:47] then you've got this big argument and
[42:50] disagreement but yet if you really love
[42:52] one another you're able to work through
[42:54] it and somebody's going to have to give
[42:56] a little bit more than likely both of
[42:58] you but the difference between us and
[43:01] God is that God is able to look down
[43:04] through time and see every one of his
[43:07] kids and he placed an element of them in
[43:10] every age so he would always have
[43:13] someone to Bear witness of his light now
[43:16] there won't be many but there doesn't
[43:18] need to be but unlike us to where we
[43:21] wish we could change our husband or wife
[43:25] or maybe some of you do you wish wish
[43:27] you could change him and you wish you
[43:29] could modify this about him and that
[43:32] about him and maybe some of your
[43:33] brothers think I wish I could change her
[43:36] there's not a question in my mind that
[43:39] some of you probably wish you could
[43:41] change me as your pastor you wish I
[43:44] wouldn't do that and you wish I wouldn't
[43:45] say that and you wish I wouldn't do that
[43:48] can you imagine what kind of preacher
[43:50] I'd be if 600 people or so would be able
[43:53] to change me I'd be your style today and
[43:55] your style Wednesday and your style next
[43:57] Sunday I'd sort have to pre be preaching
[44:00] 25 times a week in order to get around
[44:02] everybody in a few months time but it
[44:05] God unlike us God has the ability of
[44:08] taking up junk absolutely off the scrap
[44:13] heap of humanity looks like worthless
[44:18] helpless hopeless of no value at all and
[44:23] start molding in those people what he
[44:26] knows he wants to be his bride now with
[44:31] us there's certain changes of course
[44:33] that can be made and we're all still
[44:35] make them because we love our companion
[44:38] and we want to do what we can to be able
[44:40] to get along in life but God doesn't
[44:43] have to have really a whole lot to work
[44:46] with so he saves us sanctifies us fills
[44:49] us with the Holy Ghost and quickens that
[44:53] seed that is down inside of us that he
[44:56] himself play place there now unlike us
[45:00] whenever we pick our mate we hope and we
[45:02] pray and we try to talk and sort through
[45:05] everything and we find little
[45:07] differences but we say well we can work
[45:09] through that but God has the ability to
[45:13] be able to take those which seem like
[45:15] are character less they have hardly any
[45:18] at all they come from the scum of Life
[45:22] they are some of them the offscouring of
[45:25] the world some of them are so far gone
[45:27] even the devil thought there's no hope
[45:28] for them and some of you probably
[45:30] thought just so far gone there was no
[45:32] hope for yourself but God has the
[45:35] ability unlike us to make such major
[45:39] major changes in people that he can pick
[45:43] a people which would not look like a
[45:46] wife and by the time he gets done with
[45:49] them they are the Elite of the
[45:53] elite totally unrecognizable
[45:57] their family don't know who they are
[46:00] their friends don't know who they are
[46:02] and they don't know who they are
[46:04] themselves because the spirit of God
[46:07] begins to work such a work in their
[46:10] lives and totally transforms them now we
[46:14] know the way he does this is he allows
[46:17] his own mind to be in
[46:20] us now if we all have the same mind
[46:23] today and we come to church for the same
[46:26] go
[46:27] same motive same objective we want to
[46:30] see God move in this place more than
[46:33] anything else and we are willing to do
[46:36] whatever we have to do to allow him to
[46:39] do so I wonder what kind of service we'
[46:41] have I wonder what kind of church would'
[46:44] have if we made up every one of us our
[46:46] mind from this day forward every service
[46:50] that I'm going to be in from this day
[46:52] forward I'm my motive is going to be to
[46:55] worship God I don't care what the people
[46:57] think about me I don't care if they like
[46:59] it or they don't like it I'm going to
[47:01] get in with all of my heart I'm not
[47:03] going to sit there like a bump on a
[47:05] pickle I'm going to amen the word I'm
[47:07] going to say praise God Brother Don
[47:10] ain't going to have to say and the
[47:11] church said to me brother Donnie ain't
[47:13] going to have to say let's everybody
[47:15] raise their hands to me because I'm a
[47:17] son or daughter of God and I'm going to
[47:19] do it because I'm ordained to do
[47:24] it wouldn't that be something if we all
[47:27] had that mind well if we did have that
[47:29] mind now this is what happened on the
[47:31] day of Pentecost that they were in one
[47:33] place and one Accord and they'd receive
[47:36] one mind but that mind was not yet the
[47:38] mind of Christ now the mind of Christ is
[47:40] that Supernatural element according to
[47:42] the teaching of the seven seal the mind
[47:44] of Christ is that Supernatural element
[47:47] which does not come by reading the Bible
[47:50] it does not come by listening to tapes
[47:53] it does not come by listening to me it
[47:56] does not come by listening to your
[47:57] favorite preacher whoever that is it can
[48:00] only come by a supernatural endowment of
[48:04] almighty God himself but you can see if
[48:07] God had found a way to be able to drop
[48:10] in every member of his bride the same
[48:13] mind they might be different cultures
[48:16] different colors different backgrounds
[48:18] so much about them that would be so
[48:20] different but if he could take the
[48:22] carnal mind out of each one of them and
[48:25] drop in his own mind then even though
[48:28] they would still be different in their
[48:30] makeup and difference of opinions about
[48:32] this and that but the mind that was in
[48:35] them would be of the same mind which
[48:37] would be the mind of Christ now what I
[48:40] just described to you is the bride
[48:42] that's going in the Rapture you see
[48:44] there's lots of folks around this
[48:45] message that will never be bride
[48:47] material they've got quotes they've got
[48:50] the doctrines of the message down path
[48:52] and they've got all this out and other
[48:54] we've seen over the last few years many
[48:56] of those and whenever the Bel the sign
[48:58] thing come around I know of preachers
[49:00] around this message that had been in
[49:03] this message for over 40 years and they
[49:06] turned away from it and said William
[49:08] Brandon was a false prophet well you see
[49:10] where the message was up here and never
[49:13] hear well come on now how could God ever
[49:16] give you his mind and acknowledge the
[49:18] word is true and then all of a sudden
[49:20] the same God let you know that you was
[49:22] in a in a cult well there ain't no way
[49:25] that's the spirit of God but if we all
[49:28] had the same mind you say is that
[49:30] attainable brother Donnie it's not only
[49:32] attainable it is prophecy now the mind
[49:36] that was in Christ Jesus is in every
[49:40] believer there is the soul Soul's in
[49:44] prison now November 1963 now the mind
[49:48] that was in Christ Jesus is in every
[49:51] believer there is the soul there is the
[49:57] soul so God changes our nature and God
[50:01] drops in the elect every one of them now
[50:04] this is not just the prophet and this is
[50:06] not just preachers only but every member
[50:09] of the elect has or will have if they
[50:12] don't have it yet the mind of Christ so
[50:16] they may become part of them come from
[50:17] India part of them from Africa and I've
[50:19] been in many of those parts and I've
[50:21] told you before you go there and the
[50:23] worship in India is totally different
[50:24] from that in Mexico and in South America
[50:27] and our worship here may be a little
[50:29] different from the northern brothers and
[50:30] sisters up in Ohio and Michigan places
[50:33] like that but yet when it comes right
[50:35] down to it every member of the Bride
[50:37] will have the same mind now Satan hates
[50:41] this so what he loves to do is to seow
[50:43] Discord and contention among the people
[50:46] and get them arguing over this Doctrine
[50:49] and that Doctrine and to a lot of the
[50:50] message folks that's all the message is
[50:52] anyway it's just a bunch of doctrines
[50:55] but this message is is not just a bunch
[50:58] of doctrines it is a message from God to
[51:01] get us ready for the Rapture in the last
[51:03] day is that right it was not a doctrine
[51:06] that died for you on the cross it was
[51:08] not a doctrine that raised from the dead
[51:11] it is not a Doctrine that's coming back
[51:13] for you it was a person amen and if you
[51:16] don't love that person with all of your
[51:18] heart I'll tell you one thing you better
[51:20] get to praying now God can be able to
[51:23] take people that it would seem as if
[51:25] though that would be no hope for them
[51:27] all to ever arise above their own sin
[51:31] and Fallen nature much less to rise into
[51:35] a super race now you see what God does
[51:38] and he takes those people and He will
[51:40] begin to mold them and shape them now he
[51:42] has years and years and years of his
[51:45] program before most of them and then
[51:47] what will happen he start shaping them
[51:50] and he does not unload it all of course
[51:52] at one time because he knows we could
[51:54] not take it we could not take the stress
[51:57] we could not take the anxiety that comes
[51:59] with a child of God I know I know the
[52:01] people out here in the world they're
[52:03] feeling it too they're feeling the
[52:04] stress you're not the only one but yet
[52:06] you put a foolish virgin in the
[52:08] footsteps of a righteous virgin a wise
[52:11] virgin and let them try to walk there in
[52:13] three or four weeks time that'd have
[52:14] their brains blowed out they couldn't
[52:16] take it there ain't no way in the world
[52:18] they could take it why because they
[52:20] don't have the spiritual metallurgical
[52:23] value inside of them now you said what
[52:26] were you you talking about I'm talking
[52:27] about Abraham being a silver dollar and
[52:30] lot being a penny so Abraham at a
[52:33] spiritual metallurgical value that a
[52:36] hundred lots a hundred Lots it would
[52:39] take to even come close to Abraham and
[52:42] you could never ever change the value of
[52:45] lot he hung around the messenger he hung
[52:48] around the message but yet it never did
[52:50] really change him he was a lot when he
[52:53] started he was a lot in the middle and
[52:55] he was a lot when he finished praise the
[52:58] Lord and Abraham was an Abraham whenever
[53:00] he was called of God I wish somebody
[53:02] would preach with me this morning he was
[53:04] an Abraham when he was backslid down in
[53:06] the land of Egypt he was an Abraham when
[53:09] he went over and was caught up again and
[53:11] said this is my sister not my wife he
[53:14] was still an Abraham come on somebody
[53:17] why because God had chosen him to be one
[53:20] of his now we look at Jacob and we look
[53:23] at Esau and We Know by reading the
[53:25] scripture and what the the prophet has
[53:27] told us about them that Esau was a much
[53:29] better man as far as a good person he
[53:33] was a much better good person than Jacob
[53:36] ever was he was a liar he was a
[53:38] supplanter he was a deceiver but the
[53:41] seed fell in Jacob not in Esau and God
[53:45] was able to take a man that no doubt his
[53:47] daddy looked at him and we know that his
[53:49] their father he actually preferred Esau
[53:52] above Jacob is that right and we know
[53:54] many times it'll be that way
[53:56] because there was no doubt things about
[53:59] Jacob that he thought how can this ever
[54:01] be the one that'll carry on the seed
[54:04] lineage of God how could Jacob ever do
[54:06] it why he's a deceiver he's a Shyer he's
[54:09] a trickster there ain't nothing in the
[54:11] world can ever get a hold of that boy oh
[54:13] yes there is his name is almighty God
[54:16] and when God got done with Jacob he
[54:18] turned him into a prince praise the Lord
[54:22] he turned him into a prince so only God
[54:25] can take a man like Jacob and turn him
[54:28] into a prince in so much that he
[54:30] wrestles with God himself but you know
[54:34] when God begins to set this in motion
[54:37] and we may look like that we're doing
[54:39] really good for a while and then the
[54:41] spirit of God will start turning up the
[54:44] pressure oh my how we all dislike
[54:47] pressure except this water pressure in
[54:49] our house isn't it aggravating if you
[54:51] live in a part of of of East Tennessee
[54:54] here where there's so many Hills and all
[54:55] that and the people down in the valley
[54:57] got a good 60 65 lbs pressure and in
[55:00] your house you got 45 and you're
[55:03] thinking we're hooked up to the same
[55:04] Elizabeth and water what in the world's
[55:06] going on I pay my water bill just like
[55:09] they do theirs I stand out there and
[55:11] wash my car and it takes two hours cuz
[55:14] I'm they stand out there in their garden
[55:16] hoses like a pressure
[55:18] washer they just washed all over
[55:20] everything all we we hate it cuz we got
[55:22] low pressure but how many Christians
[55:24] today want the pressure turned up on
[55:26] your
[55:28] life
[55:31] a you notice my hand didn't go up either
[55:34] now I know that's a reality because the
[55:37] Babs my son my son and my son-in-law and
[55:40] my daughter and their family and The
[55:41] Parkers live over the hill for me and
[55:43] Carol and they've got the offest bunch
[55:45] of water pressure that ever was and if
[55:48] I've got one of my garden hoses on and
[55:50] try to water a plant in the front I
[55:52] can't hardly do it at the same time
[55:54] because you're a't enough pressure to
[55:56] pray push up that hill apparently and to
[55:58] be able to get it out well that's the
[56:00] way people are sometimes that God
[56:02] chooses his and he will let the pressure
[56:05] come to them as he knows they are able
[56:07] to take it and if we're not careful
[56:09] we'll lose sight of the main goal of why
[56:12] he's doing this that is he's taking us
[56:16] and going to process us and turn us into
[56:19] a people that the angels of God will bow
[56:23] themselves before us when we walk down
[56:27] streets of gold is that going to happen
[56:30] by just the new birst it will not will
[56:33] that happen just by attending church it
[56:36] will not how will that happen when God
[56:39] begins to mold in us a character that
[56:43] will match him now think of it do any of
[56:45] y'all here today believe that God would
[56:48] marry a
[56:50] liar
[56:51] anybody anybody belied that God would
[56:54] marry a drunk
[56:57] prostitute hormonger
[57:03] dopic so whatever kind of woman God
[57:06] marries proves what kind of God he is
[57:09] just like a man when he picks a wife or
[57:11] a woman chooses a husband then it shows
[57:15] if she sees him as he is and marries him
[57:19] and then she looks and say well that's
[57:20] what I wanted that's the kind of man I
[57:22] wanted I wanted a man that cuss me out I
[57:24] wanted a man that wouldn't be true to me
[57:26] I wanted a man well you say well most of
[57:27] them never do that well if he's that
[57:29] type of a fell what do you figure that
[57:31] you're
[57:32] getting see we don't have the ability
[57:34] like God to be able to look in there and
[57:37] see a character which is there in the
[57:39] molding but it's laying there in seed
[57:42] form and yet it can be brought to it
[57:44] through years and years of testing and
[57:47] trying one of the largest diamonds that
[57:50] were found many years ago and they
[57:52] studied it and kept it for years and
[57:55] years
[57:56] before they ever cut it so they x-rayed
[57:59] it they put it through sonograms through
[58:01] different types of things because
[58:03] they're studying the light the way the
[58:05] light hits it now every Diamond almost
[58:07] every one of them is going to have an
[58:08] element of carbon on the inside and that
[58:11] is called inclusions whenever you're
[58:12] looking at diamonds and they want to
[58:14] study that diamond and see how they can
[58:17] cut it to get the most out of it because
[58:19] a diamond in the rough it does not have
[58:21] the ability to reflect light or release
[58:24] the fire as we say so they study that
[58:27] diamond and they look at it from this
[58:28] shape and that shape and and they cut it
[58:31] some of the most famous Diamond Cutters
[58:32] that there have been for centuries are
[58:34] the Jews and you know anything thing
[58:35] about diamonds know that Anor is where
[58:38] that the great Diamond Market comes from
[58:40] so before they would be able to take
[58:42] this diamond and cut it now should they
[58:44] just take it and cut it into one
[58:47] gigantic diamond or should they take it
[58:50] and cut it make one great big one and
[58:52] then some smaller ones and then some
[58:54] little bitty ones so they study it and
[58:57] they study it and they try to put in a
[58:59] computer graphic and figure that if they
[59:01] do it this way and they leave this one
[59:03] great big chunk of a diamond then would
[59:06] it be worth more would it have a greater
[59:09] historical value or would they be better
[59:11] off to take and cut it into multiple
[59:14] pieces well you see the Lord God did
[59:17] this the Lord God brought his great
[59:19] Diamond to the Earth it was himself in
[59:23] the form of a human being we called him
[59:26] the Lord
[59:28] Jesus and then God's great plan was not
[59:31] to leave this diamond in this gigantic
[59:34] perfect sinless form as the Son of God
[59:39] but his plan was to cut this diamond and
[59:43] take from him a piece and another piece
[59:46] and another piece and another piece and
[59:49] another piece because the way he looked
[59:51] at it it would bring him more glory and
[59:54] more honor if he had had multiple Sons
[59:57] and Daughters of God all over the Earth
[1:00:00] than it would be to have one perfect one
[1:00:03] on the throne of God in
[1:00:05] heaven the way he looked at it if he
[1:00:08] could multiply that one and cut off of
[1:00:11] him another and another and another and
[1:00:14] another now of course you those of you
[1:00:16] that are in construction you know you
[1:00:18] have Diamond coated blades saw blades
[1:00:20] Diamond coated this and that and the
[1:00:22] other and diamonds are used for all
[1:00:24] types of things and so the Lord God
[1:00:26] decided before the world ever began
[1:00:28] before there's ever a man there was a
[1:00:30] plan before a man was ever lost there
[1:00:32] was a cross so the Lord God decided that
[1:00:36] he would create himself in Diamond form
[1:00:39] and he would allow the light of all the
[1:00:42] Brilliance of his majesty to show forth
[1:00:45] down through time so in the beginning
[1:00:47] was the word and there he started so he
[1:00:50] had this program within himself and he
[1:00:53] wanted to divide himself and give me and
[1:00:57] you and every other son and daughter of
[1:01:00] God a portion of himself I don't want
[1:01:02] your spirit and you shouldn't want mine
[1:01:05] praise the Lord I don't want somebody
[1:01:07] else's Spirit you know the prophet said
[1:01:08] it over and over again I was looking at
[1:01:10] it last night studying and he said you
[1:01:12] walk into a church and he said you watch
[1:01:14] the pastor if the pastor jerks his head
[1:01:17] a certain way many times you find the
[1:01:20] people in the church doing exactly the
[1:01:21] same thing now he said if we're not
[1:01:23] careful we will find ourselves getting
[1:01:26] one another's spirit and S of the spirit
[1:01:28] of God now let me tell you how much I
[1:01:30] appreciate y'all not doing that today
[1:01:32] cuz when I get up I get real happy
[1:01:34] sometimes I'll shake that leg well I
[1:01:36] don't see hard to anybody else should do
[1:01:38] it some of his little boys do I know
[1:01:39] they do that kind of laughing at me but
[1:01:42] yet I'm glad that you don't want my
[1:01:44] spirit you don't want to jerk your hand
[1:01:46] or whatever like me you want to be the
[1:01:48] way God made you is that right now a lot
[1:01:52] of pastors that's what they want they
[1:01:55] want their Church
[1:01:56] to be little miniature Donnies or little
[1:01:59] miniature Tims or little miniature Rons
[1:02:02] I don't why in the world would I want
[1:02:04] you to be a little noad Donnie when you
[1:02:07] can be a miniature Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:10] Living inside of your
[1:02:12] body praise the lord well don't you feel
[1:02:15] the same way why in the world would you
[1:02:16] want to be like me when you could be
[1:02:18] like him I've never understood that I've
[1:02:20] never understood why people would rather
[1:02:22] act like a preacher than they would like
[1:02:24] God
[1:02:27] but God himself decided to divide
[1:02:30] himself of course this is the term we've
[1:02:31] been looking at for a couple years now
[1:02:33] called kinosis so he empties himself of
[1:02:36] those attributes which would forbid him
[1:02:38] from elements of time and Humanity how
[1:02:40] could the Eternal ever break into into
[1:02:43] time so he laid aside kosis himself
[1:02:46] stepped out of that invisible form which
[1:02:49] cannot be seen into a visible tangible
[1:02:51] form in order to become like us and when
[1:02:53] he come to the Earth and when he arrived
[1:02:55] did he arrive with a perfect character
[1:02:57] now listen carefully the very character
[1:03:00] of Jesus himself was molded by suffering
[1:03:04] is that what the church hbook tells us
[1:03:06] so the character of the Lord Jesus being
[1:03:09] the created Son of God was not perfect
[1:03:13] by perfect I mean complete remember
[1:03:15] there's two Greek words used in the New
[1:03:17] Testament we use the one English word
[1:03:19] perfect but it means two different
[1:03:20] things one word is sinlessness and the
[1:03:24] other word is lack that which is to be
[1:03:27] completed so he was here on the earth
[1:03:29] totally sinless but he laid aside the
[1:03:32] completion of himself and he's going to
[1:03:35] regain it not by creation so whenever he
[1:03:39] gets back into that imorph body he will
[1:03:42] not speak himself back into Perfection
[1:03:45] of character so he lays aside that
[1:03:48] character before he comes down to the
[1:03:50] Earth and when he arrives he arrives
[1:03:52] like us lacking things in his character
[1:03:56] so how will he get them back now
[1:03:58] remember if he's going to be the diamond
[1:04:00] that come from God and chips of himself
[1:04:03] is going to come off and get in you
[1:04:06] however God gives him his character is
[1:04:08] how God is obligated to give you yours
[1:04:12] is that right so what does he do he
[1:04:14] allows his own character to be molded by
[1:04:18] the things he went
[1:04:20] through so he had to step out of this
[1:04:24] being of completion and Perfection and
[1:04:28] lacking nothing to having a character
[1:04:31] which needed to be worked on I remember
[1:04:34] Jesus never had a temper like us Jesus
[1:04:36] never you know said words that he
[1:04:37] shouldn't say or nothing like that but
[1:04:39] it was that element of character molding
[1:04:42] that can only come through the
[1:04:46] instrumentality of human
[1:04:50] beings human beings can be some of the
[1:04:53] greatest of God's creation
[1:04:56] and other times they can be sorry rotten
[1:04:59] dirt
[1:05:01] bags boy I didn't get very many amens on
[1:05:06] that and yet what was it that God used
[1:05:11] to mold the very character of the Lord
[1:05:14] Jesus
[1:05:16] donkeys cattle sheep giraffes horses
[1:05:21] elephants flies fleas gnats bees
[1:05:26] what was it
[1:05:29] people
[1:05:31] people people not good people
[1:05:34] now generally the people that are used
[1:05:38] to mold our character a lot of them will
[1:05:40] never even be saved anyway right they
[1:05:43] won't even be saved no they won't as a
[1:05:46] matter of fact you'll judge them in the
[1:05:47] day of
[1:05:48] judgment because a lot of them will
[1:05:50] never embrace your God and your truth
[1:05:54] but yet they are are on the negative
[1:05:57] side on the side of darkness and they
[1:05:59] will gou you and get at you and it just
[1:06:01] seem like they're not happy if they're
[1:06:03] not causing you trouble how many knows
[1:06:05] what I'm talking about you go anybody
[1:06:07] like that you work with or works for you
[1:06:08] or your mom or your daddy I
[1:06:12] mean and there's something about it that
[1:06:15] it just really irks us as we say and all
[1:06:18] that people and they can just so affect
[1:06:21] you you're having such a great day and
[1:06:23] you get a text from Mr irksome himself
[1:06:26] or Miss irksome and it just almost sends
[1:06:29] a chill up and down your spine and they
[1:06:32] just really rub you the wrong way you
[1:06:35] you I I would to God God would send
[1:06:37] lightning down out of heaven and and
[1:06:40] absolutely ackowledge them no you don't
[1:06:42] say them things you're too Angelic you
[1:06:44] think them
[1:06:49] yeah and yet God himself may have been
[1:06:52] the very one that allowed you to come in
[1:06:55] contact contact with that person and let
[1:06:58] them cross your
[1:06:59] path because those others who are so
[1:07:03] nice to you and so wonderful they never
[1:07:05] bother you they never bring any of those
[1:07:07] you know those weak things out of your
[1:07:09] character but it's those other type of
[1:07:12] people that do and when they do it
[1:07:14] really shows what we are now I'm sure
[1:07:18] this is probably not hardly for anybody
[1:07:20] that's here present today it's only for
[1:07:23] the streamers Erica honey this this is
[1:07:25] for you you need to straighten up some
[1:07:28] of you sorry people over in Norway
[1:07:30] that's streaming us right now would you
[1:07:32] bunch of Sinners get right with
[1:07:35] God some of you people in Johannesburg
[1:07:39] you Brothers over in Greenland you folks
[1:07:41] in Iceland you folks in Germany I wonder
[1:07:44] to God you people would get right with
[1:07:47] God so I could preach where all these
[1:07:49] Holy Angels
[1:07:52] Live I am preaching where you live
[1:07:56] right that's why you're quieter than a
[1:07:58] mouse this morning you might as well go
[1:08:00] ahead and loosen up cuz you ain't going
[1:08:01] to shut me down you ain't going to
[1:08:03] freeze me out and God allows things like
[1:08:07] that to come toward us and if we're not
[1:08:09] careful we'll become so discouraged by
[1:08:12] looking at the past in between the time
[1:08:14] we're in and out of the furnace and
[1:08:15] things that are going on to tr that we
[1:08:18] will lose scope of what it's all about
[1:08:20] it's for our good traumas that seem like
[1:08:24] will bring us to our knees time and time
[1:08:27] again and we wonder why why should this
[1:08:29] happen to me a as a child of God I'm a
[1:08:32] member of the Bride I believe this
[1:08:34] message with all of my heart reread what
[1:08:36] Peter said think it not strange beloved
[1:08:40] that some of these things will come upon
[1:08:42] you to try you as though some strange
[1:08:45] thing this is not strange at all as a
[1:08:48] matter of fact if you've got the Holy
[1:08:49] Ghost and the devil ain't trying you I
[1:08:52] question your Holy Ghost because if
[1:08:55] you've got not the Holy Ghost every
[1:08:56] devil in hell hates you when you get
[1:08:59] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:01] it's like God puts a great big Target on
[1:09:03] your back about that big and all of a
[1:09:05] sudden you walk out of The Honky Tonk
[1:09:07] you walk out of the world you walk out
[1:09:09] of the darkness of the light that you've
[1:09:11] been living in and the spirit of God
[1:09:13] fills you with the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:09:15] so happy but you didn't realize at the
[1:09:17] same time the Holy Ghost fell on your
[1:09:19] soul and God put a seal on your soul he
[1:09:22] put a great big old red target about
[1:09:24] that big on your back and you're
[1:09:26] thinking what in the world went wrong
[1:09:28] there ain't nothing wrong there ain't
[1:09:31] nothing out of cater you're doing
[1:09:33] exactly what you're supposed to do come
[1:09:35] on somebody and preach with me this
[1:09:37] morning I'll tell you what we're here
[1:09:39] for we are here to upset hell we are
[1:09:43] here to set the captive free we are here
[1:09:46] to make the devil mad and yes he will
[1:09:49] get mad but if you can't take it then
[1:09:51] get out of the way but if you're
[1:09:53] ordained of God I I say that we rise out
[1:09:57] of the high sheat that some of us are in
[1:10:00] today and let's dust off our clothes out
[1:10:02] of the ashes and say all right devil I
[1:10:05] put up with your lip long enough I'm a
[1:10:08] Son of God I'm a daughter of God yes I'm
[1:10:11] being tried yes I'm being tested and yes
[1:10:14] I will overcome because he sees in me a
[1:10:18] seed of his own making I am a chip off
[1:10:22] of the old Diamond Hallelujah I am am

[1:15:42] portion of that diamond and he's molding
[1:15:45] and cutting and shaping us to we can be
[1:15:48] what he wants us to be and when he gets
[1:15:50] all the diamonds cut around the world he
[1:15:53] will call for his jewels to come
[1:15:57] home Hallelujah then he will gather us
[1:16:09] all no matter how much trouble we have
[1:16:13] how much heartaches and Sorrows we go
[1:16:15] through all these are
[1:16:18] reasons and there's a reason for
[1:16:22] it do we understand his reasons of
[1:16:24] course of course we
[1:16:26] don't but we trust
[1:16:28] him God's purpose can
[1:16:33] never how many believes it
[1:16:36] never be defeated there is
[1:16:45] nothing can defeat it so how sad and how
[1:16:50] depressed and how longf faced
[1:16:55] how what happy we'll let your face know
[1:16:58] it would
[1:16:59] you how happy ought we to be today
[1:17:04] resting upon that
[1:17:07] beautiful
[1:17:09] Revelation but you see friends the
[1:17:11] reason a lot of us aren't happy is
[1:17:13] because this is not revealed to us it's
[1:17:16] just a beautiful
[1:17:18] quote not a beautiful
[1:17:22] Revelation if God reveals this to us us
[1:17:25] I don't care what we Face we know there
[1:17:28] is a peace in the middle of storms
[1:17:31] there's a great joy in the midst of
[1:17:32] Trials oh that's
[1:17:34] right notice I love this he said what
[1:17:37] God has
[1:17:38] imagined in his mind what God has
[1:17:43] purposed in his heart now imagined it in
[1:17:46] his mind purposed it in his heart to
[1:17:50] bring to pass there is no demon there's
[1:17:53] no power there is nothing can ever
[1:17:56] separate God's Great Immortal Eternal
[1:18:00] plan it must be as God has
[1:18:04] said hallelujah hallelujah and the
[1:18:08] church said it is a purpose of God
[1:18:13] listen to this now to to give us the
[1:18:16] Blessed Holy Spirit it is a purpose of
[1:18:20] God to show us signs and wonders and and
[1:18:26] miracles well Glory I realize a lot of
[1:18:29] the folks in the message don't want that
[1:18:31] no more but I personally believe we're
[1:18:33] in need of these more than we've ever
[1:18:34] been we've got sick folk everywhere
[1:18:37] we've got folks that the doctors are
[1:18:39] saying we don't know what to do to help
[1:18:41] you I believe the supernatural God wants
[1:18:43] to manifest himself anybody in here with
[1:18:46] me today why because any where God is
[1:18:49] there is Supernatural taking place let
[1:18:52] people call us Pentecostal let them call
[1:18:55] us whatever they want to call us you
[1:18:57] call me that if you wish to but when the
[1:18:59] Rapture comes call me gone cuz I ain't
[1:19:02] going to be here how can I say days of
[1:19:05] Miracles is passed when every person
[1:19:07] here today that's saved is a miracle
[1:19:10] every person here today that has the
[1:19:13] Holy Ghost is a miracle you're sitting
[1:19:16] here today by the grace of God because
[1:19:18] you're one Miracle after another after
[1:19:21] another God desires to display himself
[1:19:27] and no Satan cannot stop
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:34] it let me read this again is it a
[1:19:37] purpose of God to give us the Blessed
[1:19:38] Holy Spirit it is a purpose of God to
[1:19:41] show us
[1:19:43] signs and
[1:19:45] wonders and miracles it is a purpose of
[1:19:49] God and
[1:19:51] nothing you hear me I don't care hot
[1:19:55] cold and indifference some of the
[1:19:56] message people get it ain't going to
[1:19:58] stop the
[1:20:00] bride all the message people ain't bride
[1:20:03] no way I know it hurts your feeling to
[1:20:05] acknowledge that but you might as well
[1:20:06] Prophet tells us a power transformation
[1:20:08] every Revival produces a set of twins
[1:20:10] and we've got one too they look like us

[1:20:14] difference is they got different daddies
[1:20:16] our father is the word we don't cut and
[1:20:19] splice and take out what quotes we want
[1:20:21] what quotes we don't want we lay them
[1:20:23] aside we don't cut imply scriptures we
[1:20:26] believe every word God
[1:20:30] said Hallelujah let me tell you what's
[1:20:33] against
[1:20:34] you all powers of
[1:20:41] Hell might wager against it but it will
[1:20:47] prevail you understand down through time
[1:20:50] God in his sovereignty would not let
[1:20:53] every demon do his full
[1:20:58] capability not only have the seals come
[1:21:00] open in this day but the Gates of Hell
[1:21:04] have opened

[1:24:48] matter of fact nasala the main guy of
[1:24:52] Hezbollah and some of the other
[1:24:54] Terror programs said just last week we
[1:24:58] will blow Israel back to the Stone
[1:25:04] Age and I read that I
[1:25:07] thought
[1:25:10] NOP I'll tell you who is going to take
[1:25:12] them back to the Stone Age though it'll
[1:25:16] be the Lord
[1:25:17] Jesus that stone that was cut out of the
[1:25:19] mountain the Stone Age is
[1:25:22] coming Oh Glory to
[1:25:25] God oh my Putin has got his big bomb
[1:25:29] called the tar the largest nuclear
[1:25:31] manmade weapon of course it's ever been
[1:25:34] designed and it's horrific the amount of
[1:25:37] Devastation and destruction that they
[1:25:39] say that it can accomplished but every
[1:25:41] Born Again child of God sting here today
[1:25:44] you can lay down on your bed tonight and
[1:25:46] not worry about nuclear fallout you
[1:25:49] don't have to worry about Putin you
[1:25:51] don't have to worry about Russia or Iran
[1:25:53] or irq or your neighbor because God is
[1:25:57] the only one who can oh Hallelujah
[1:26:00] complete what he's ordained Satan cannot
[1:26:03] stop
[1:26:12] it Israel is totally surrounded like you
[1:26:17] are got the Mediterranean over here
[1:26:20] Egypt down here they got Lebanon they
[1:26:23] got Iran
[1:26:24] good Way's over everywhere around them
[1:26:27] they got enemies everywhere and every
[1:26:29] one of them out to get them and then
[1:26:31] poor old dumb Palestinians living right
[1:26:33] next door wanting them to bomb them with
[1:26:36] the atomic bomb you say duh so where do
[1:26:39] y'all figure you going to go that that
[1:26:41] nuclear fall that would make it
[1:26:43] unlivable uninhabitable they say for 150
[1:26:47] years so you're wanting them to bomb you
[1:26:50] and you know what divide section A B and
[1:26:53] C you don't what ab and C is no probably
[1:26:55] not well they divided Israel so they got
[1:26:57] a section A a section b a section c when
[1:27:00] we was there a few years ago and going
[1:27:01] into Bethlehem that is under Palestinian
[1:27:04] control so you've got a little town of
[1:27:07] Bethlehem how still we see the lie and
[1:27:09] you see a mined over here and a mined
[1:27:11] over there which is the sign of Islam
[1:27:14] you go down through and there's section
[1:27:16] A and section B our guide could not even
[1:27:18] go into Bethlehem because he was a
[1:27:21] Jew his homeland
[1:27:24] how could it be because they compromised
[1:27:27] on God's word years ago and now the
[1:27:29] enemy's got their land is that what we
[1:27:32] want we want the enemy to have our peace
[1:27:35] we want the enemy to have our joy and
[1:27:37] stick up his minettes here and there I
[1:27:40] say it's time we tear them
[1:27:42] down Hallelujah and say Satan you're not
[1:27:47] building your Memorial on my ground get
[1:27:50] out
[1:27:56] so you imagine here's a Jew he's not
[1:27:58] even
[1:27:59] allowed to go into
[1:28:02] Bethlehem the Galilee you understand
[1:28:05] what they're calling the occupied West
[1:28:08] Bank you know where that is
[1:28:11] Galilee and
[1:28:14] Samaria and they're called in Israel the
[1:28:20] occupiers that's why they hate it when
[1:28:23] they dig out stuff out of the
[1:28:25] ground and they find Israel's Heritage
[1:28:29] laying buried down in the
[1:28:31] dirt so they find this King and they
[1:28:33] find this sign that I read you one six
[1:28:35] or seven months ago when they had dug
[1:28:37] down to the streets of Jerusalem just
[1:28:39] three months ago three and a half months
[1:28:41] ago they uncovered the original pool of
[1:28:44] salom the Bible says they would go up to
[1:28:47] Jerusalem and they knew there had to be
[1:28:49] an Ascent somewhere they have just found
[1:28:52] just recently the original steps that
[1:28:54] went from salom up to the Temple Mount
[1:28:58] and they found Rings down inside there
[1:29:01] they found a stamp on the other side in
[1:29:03] the city of David and it was of one of
[1:29:06] the scribes in the book of Jeremiah of
[1:29:10] course the Palestinians don't like that
[1:29:12] because that tells them they was there
[1:29:14] before they were there that's the way
[1:29:16] the devil wants to tell you you don't
[1:29:18] belong to God you belong to me but God
[1:29:21] digs and digs and digs and goes past
[1:29:25] this and that and the other and God
[1:29:27] wants you to see your seed Hallelujah
[1:29:30] God wants you to see who you are if he
[1:29:33] can have a minister that'll dig past all
[1:29:36] your complexes all your fears all your
[1:29:38] anxiety and say here child here say who
[1:29:41] you are say who you belong to you don't
[1:29:45] belong to the world you don't belong to
[1:29:47] the devil You Belong To Me
[1:30:01] Hallelujah it can never be destroyed it
[1:30:04] is the purpose of God to see that it
[1:30:07] will
[1:30:08] prevail then it's not up to
[1:30:12] me or it's not up to
[1:30:17] you whether it will be destroyed or not
[1:30:21] it's up to God oh yeah we're going to do
[1:30:24] our part but it's not me that'll make
[1:30:26] this work it it ain't you God will do
[1:30:33] it we can rest assured on it listen this
[1:30:37] God will never let our
[1:30:42] heritage be
[1:30:47] destroyed can you imagine what an
[1:30:49] awesome thing it must have been about
[1:30:52] nine months ago

[1:30:57] Shiloh or Shilo of
[1:31:00] Hebrew we've stood there Carol and
[1:31:03] I we saw them digging up a Roman Capital

[1:31:08] top goes on a
[1:31:11] post theya back to Caligula's
[1:31:16] time and they found a place where all
[1:31:18] these bones and skeletons of animals
[1:31:21] were
[1:31:24] and then they found steps and they found
[1:31:26] a place where water had
[1:31:29] been and the man said the way it was
[1:31:32] centered on
[1:31:34] Shilo it was the place where the holiest
[1:31:36] of holies would have been in the
[1:31:42] Tabernacle hundreds of remnants of Bones

[1:33:24] let our heritage be destroyed for it's
[1:33:28] his
[1:33:29] purpose to give it to
[1:33:32] us but brother Donnie the scientists
[1:33:37] say and and and the great theologians
[1:33:40] say and the great teachers say
[1:33:43] uhhuh I hear you you see the great
[1:33:47] theologians even Bible study and
[1:33:50] theologians said that Pontius Pilate
[1:33:54] never
[1:33:55] lived cuz they couldn't find no
[1:34:00] history but several years ago in
[1:34:04] cesaria whenever they was out there
[1:34:07] digging
[1:34:08] around I like to dig don't
[1:34:11] you they sat there digging around here
[1:34:13] and they found this Roman Coliseum
[1:34:17] beautiful place right on the right on
[1:34:18] the seaside awesome place and they had
[1:34:21] this long stretches of sand where they
[1:34:23] would race and they had the the Roman
[1:34:25] circus and all their hell right there
[1:34:29] and they got over after looking around
[1:34:30] at the Coliseum and somebody happened to
[1:34:32] get down on their knees that might be a
[1:34:35] good place to
[1:34:36] start and you was all these solid Stone
[1:34:40] steps and somebody was down on their
[1:34:42] knees kind of digging
[1:34:46] around and they happened to look up and
[1:34:50] when they looked up there was a stone
[1:34:52] that had been carved in that Coliseum
[1:34:56] that had been there for 2,000 years
[1:34:59] dedicated in the memory of ponches
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:10] pilot once again God's word is proven
[1:35:14] true let me tell you something I don't
[1:35:15] need a rock in a Coliseum to you I don't
[1:35:18] need them to find a COI pot over here
[1:35:20] and a pot over there I have the mind of
[1:35:23] Christ and with the mind of Christ he
[1:35:26] projects to us as his children something
[1:35:29] more sure than a
[1:35:31] rock it's a revelation of his
[1:35:48] word you're talking about Grace listen
[1:35:51] to this next quote
[1:35:54] no matter how
[1:35:57] indifferent we seem to be at
[1:36:00] times and how strange things go and how
[1:36:04] the church gets in this condition and
[1:36:06] that condition it's all in the Divine
[1:36:10] Purpose of
[1:36:11] God to mold us and make us in his own
[1:36:17] way who knows how to Fashion the
[1:36:21] material more than the Creator can I
[1:36:25] share one more with you it just goes to
[1:36:28] show that nothing can defeat his
[1:36:33] purpose not even
[1:36:37] death can defeat his purpose Abraham was
[1:36:40] as good as dead and Sarah's womb had
[1:36:43] been dead for 40 or 50 years but nothing
[1:36:46] can defeat God's
[1:36:49] purpose her body was old it was wrinkled
[1:36:52] the milk veins are dry up her heart was
[1:36:54] so weak it could not have went through
[1:36:56] labor but God let us know that his
[1:36:59] purpose will not be
[1:37:04] defeated he changed Sarah and made her a
[1:37:07] young woman again and took a man 100
[1:37:10] years old and turned him back to his use
[1:37:14] no matter how unreasonable it may seem
[1:37:17] God gave the promise and Abraham
[1:37:19] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:37:21] through unbelief but was strong giving
[1:37:25] God praise praise for he judged him that
[1:37:30] he was able to perform what he had
[1:37:35] promised and the church said amen do you
[1:37:39] judge him faithful he promised a Rapture
[1:37:42] will there
[1:37:44] be you believe you're a part of
[1:37:47] it he promised there'll be a people
[1:37:49] around the world will there be yes well
[1:37:53] the dead in Christ
[1:37:55] rise will you see your loved ones will
[1:37:58] we be changed in a moment in a twinkling
[1:38:00] of an eye we judge him
[1:38:05] faithful praise
[1:38:09] God praise God let's bow our heads
[1:38:14] together got this request here for
[1:38:16] sister chudy Davis she's been taken to

[1:41:27] message from you and your Prophet told
[1:41:29] us it was part of your purpose to have
[1:41:32] signs and wonders and miracles that
[1:41:36] purpose is not to exalt a preacher that
[1:41:38] purpose is not to exalt a church it's to
[1:41:41] exalt the Lord Jesus Christ Lord we can

[1:42:29] Christ centered life and that will
[1:42:32] become their absolute then Lord if they
[1:42:35] have a Christ centered life when they're
[1:42:37] up they've got an absolute when they're
