brother Brendan green you come on the platform be getting ready to sing but I was talking to sister patty not only brother Geoff I guess last night maybe that was the night before maybe was not before I guess it was anyway just to show you what God will how God will use people and sometimes you don't even have a any idea of why you're doing what you're doing but you're serving the purpose of the Lord many years ago brother brother Terry but the David Nunley sister patty they moved to Texas they went to Texas brother day was gonna try to find work and so they came upon a job site brother Davey

to the message of this hour we know brother David's been gone from us now for a year or so maybe a couple of years but sister patty but the Jeff and the family they got a nice letter from this family in Texas thanking them so much for the life of brother David Nunley and for their lives how that God used them to bring this family to the message of the hour and I just thought you know brother David's long gone but his testimony lives on and his work that he did for the Lord leaves undone telling what he's enjoying on the portals of glory right now but it's not sometimes you're doing something you don't understand what you're doing you don't have no idea why you're doing it but if you're led to the Lord and you feel good in your spirit about doing what you're doing you may be serving an eternal purpose for the Lord Jesus Christ I just want to share that I hope it's okay I didn't want to share that tonight we're glad you're here hey sister Lisa's gonna say four is anybody

will dance on season of Amazing Grace in heaven [Music] where the streets are going every chain will be broken [Music] here is gone I mean soon on the shores of eternity return Sam streets are [Music] [Music] [Music] you've got any other desire than that tonight you're in the wrong place why are you standing if you'll turn in the scriptures with me to acts 19 we're going to reverse 13 through 16 then certain of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches there were seven sons one of Siva a Jew and chief of the priests which did so these men were trying to cast out Devils without authority the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you that's bad when the Devils don't know who you are and the man and whom the evil spirit was leaped on them overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out the house naked and wounded I'm gonna read a quote by the Brandon Bobby in where sixty five of God Richard mercy natal of my sermon if you listen as I read this quote you'll see it but is who are you now we are part of God you always was you don't remember it because you weren't only an attribute in God you were only in us thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was there before the foundation of the world he knew who you were but Bream says I'm not saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out but we might get away from this fear and scare that you don't know who you are you're not going to be but you are now sons of God see you always were the sons of god let's pray Heavenly Father the Lord it's fill my lot tonight father but lord I ask Lord that you take control father lord I may be a vessel Lord that could be set aside for service Lord if they've come to hear me if you don't come Lord it's just dirt speaking to dirt that's all it is and Lord and they would leave this with human knowledge but Lord if you anointed if you anoint me Lord in this brother JD was back there tell me Lord while ago with just everybody in here had a desire to be anointed when the word goes forth or what a move we would have if everybody in here looks to hear from you and not from me if we perceive the father that this is that's not flesh that's God using man or this word would transform our lives lord I pray that you come to not meet every need father Lord you see the need of comfort Lord and Thomas sorrow for brother Don and brother Harry and his family father I pray that you would go there and our Lord give him the comfort and the peace father that only you could give touch each need here tonight father we thank you for Jesus name amen you can be seated if you'll give me a minute uh I want to give you a background on how I got this sermon I was telling brother Bradley brother JD back there well ago it I actually got this sermon out of the last one that I preached here several months ago when I was preaching it who had hindered you and when I was preaching ayah I was preaching about how we all realize you know we testify where we are of the bride we're the bride and when I was speaking there now remember how I related to finding your position finding out who you are in the bride not just not just realizing that your bride let's become a cliche in the message I'm part of the bride but God is is sent a message here to each individual to find out what your position in the bride in it and that really bared on my heart for a long time and you know when I get a thought as a minister of brother Terry some of these brothers will tell you that whenever you get a thought some of the talk it might be a thought of your own you think well I'd like to study on that but God will change it and then when God puts a thought in your heart it's totally different you can't get away from it you you just eat at you and I remember that thought who are you just kept coming back and coming back and I remember coming into service one night and I was like Lord if that thought that you give me I didn't even have a scripture for it just who are you brother Donny was preaching and in the middle of somewhere in the middle of the sermon he read acts 19 and before I came in I've been praying Lord just confirm that and when that scripture was read that just really sealed it in my heart and but Satan's job in this last day is to get you to not see who you really are get you out to fear put fear in your heart of what's laying before you what Satan and then when you when that fear comes out that blocks any revelation you have of finding out who you are and that Satan's job and while I was studying this and I was putting this down to the data I thought of the eagle in the chicken yard I don't know why that thought came to me and I just that eagle never really knew who he was he was in a chicken yard but he never realized who he was even when he her first heard the scream just when he heard the scream he didn't really realize yet who he was but he knew it was different that scream got him thinking but one is on the voice that led off the scream told him who he was then begin to realize I don't belong here if you ever realized who you are and you realize that you don't belong here you'll have a greater desire to get out that's when you'll see the bride begin to move you know and holy we identify ourselves people wide identify their selves with their homes their jobs their their families all that's good all that's good but God wants us to see past this flesh God wants us to see past who we are so how does God want how does God see for us who we really are how does he see us how does God look at us is he looking about Terry sits brother that's Terry Horne does God look at that way did you see that's Keith Phillips it's nowhere near the way God thinks there's nowhere near there was a thought that God had a view before the foundation of world and he still sees that thought he still sees he don't see the flesh but Brennan said in God the mystery in Christ mystery he made the statement that's where brother man made the statement of the bride recognize who she is she got here like I said we've made that a cliche we've identified with a body move instead of an individual and falling into place in this body that's my desire I'm glad I'm bright it tickles me to death that I'm a member of the bride but I've got to think past that I've got to find my position you've got to find your position in the bride so when brother Branham was saying that we've got to get past that fear that you don't know who you are how you going to get it people get stuck on I'm the bride and then they go on with their life I'm the bride and they're going through life there's nothing greater than being the bride but finding your position in the brothel in future home brother Branham says the future in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom an earthly bride if you are the bride and the bride is part of the husband the only place you'll ever recognize is recognized what part of that husband that word you are you can't recognize being the bride or you can't recognize being the bride you have to recognize your position your position is different than mine everybody's walk is different everybody's walk is by the word with everybody's walk is different you got to walk in the place that God puts you when I was preaching here before on a football team you can't be alignment and decide you want to play quarterback it don't work that way you're gonna be moving out of position you're gonna cause your team to lose what if we get to the place and we all get stuck on I'm in the bride and then we go by our daily lives nobody tries to find their position we're from nobody tries to find their position in the bride to find out what God wants for them to do this I was telling brother Walt earlier this message right here has spoke to me more than any message that I've ever heard that I've ever preached compared to some some brothers I haven't preached a lot but but this right here has got me a greater desire to see Who I am see Who I am in Christ when I see myself different I'm gonna see you different when I see what God wants for me my life can shine a little different for you and in a and I pray that we could all see that way it's not enough to say that you know God it's not enough to say God knows you God's desires that you know God in you in yourself it's wonderful to know God but if you don't know who you are what if God put you in a trial what if you got a test coming your way and you don't realize what God has made you God has made you more than conquer God has made you an overcomer he's made you able to be overcome anything that comes your way and yet you can't recognize it you can't recognize the tools that God gave you for that you can't recognize the power that you have in the word because you fail to see your possess and in the bride it could be that one little thing that keeps us from overcoming our trials we get so burdened down because we go through trial after trial after trial and we think it's this huge sin in your life you think it's something major the devil beat you beat you and all it is is you recognizing your position yeah all it is is a little revelation that God gives you this is who I made you this is who I want you to be all I want from you is for you to see it it's just it's just one little thing and it's in it's Satan trying to blind you Satan knows that he is not going to tell you that you're not bribed he's not gonna tell you this word is wrong because he you can always take Satan back to the place where you got saved where you got the Holy Ghost so he's not going to tell you what you believe in is a lie he's not gonna tell you that God's not real all he has to do is blind you to who you really are if you go in the battle and you got a sword but you don't know how to use it you got a spear but you don't you don't know how to use it you got a shield you got all the armor I preached this sermon a few years ago are you an overcomer you got all this armor that God gave you you're loaded down with armor but you don't know how to use it what if you're in the military a lot of y'all in the military they handed you a gun handed you a bunch of bullets said skip boot camp we need to hurry up and get you over there you don't know what to do you could have no idea what to do you're putting totally in front of the enemy without anybody telling you who you are what you're supposed to be doing and how to use what you got don't realize the power we have as the bride more read you a quote here minute well brother Bantam said the power that you have I've never read it before but if we ever get to the point to realize as the Bride of Christ because we all believe everybody believes that the bride is Christ in flesh we're Christ in flesh so will not Christ in flesh do what Christ did when Christ was here before the same power that Godhead would not the brought half so why don't we use it why don't we see that we are God in flesh why can't we see that we are Christ in flesh it's a bridegroom working through the bra the bride it's a little it's it's a little thing of satan put the scales over your eyes you can't you look in the mirror and you can't see nothing it's a revelation and 61 brother Branham preached I made these words big and I still can't see him that's pretty bad 1:18 fawni big enough in 61 he preached the house well you're talking about Jupiter and Mars and these stars that you see now well my think think about a hundred he says 186,000 miles per second and take a hundred and twenty years by one second 186,000 and break it down to a hundred and twenty million years that's then what what do you got that's miles oh my it makes makes us feel like I mean you're just see he says and then beyond that just as many moons moon and stars that's past all that 100 million years there's more behind that and he holds them with the power of his own word God holds it them with the power of his own word so what can you do you claim you have God you claim that's who you are a child of God that's what we're speaking of who are you you're a child of God you that's your testimony God holds them with the power of his own work and the very same thing that holds them is in you as a Christian see there you are Kareem says that's who you are if that if that ever came in revelation to every single member of this bride would be gone that's a revelation of who we are that's the bride getting revelation of who we she really is world would have no idea what to do with such power when I was when you got that much power and we hold it back you know we say this all the time when you get sick you run to the doctor you take a pill you do all this and you got problems in your life and financial problems instead of going to God you run the bank and all these kind of things you don't realize your brother branham the bible tells us you know come boldly before the throne come boldly look at Esther I might be off here but I've seriously don't think Esther even after she was made Queen realized who she was yet her pastor Mordecai had to tell her to go before the throne your people are being killed your people are gonna be murdered she know what to do Mordecai said go to the king but she still didn't come boldly she crawled up on her hands and knees that's her husband sitting there but when she realized who she was she did not I was thinking of sitting in the back while ago she did not make her request known yet what does she ask the Queen became for fellowship she said I want to fellowship with you I want to prepare a meal for you we're gonna get towards the end now you don't mean every time I preach I jump everywhere but we're gonna get into that fellowship part but she asked she asked the King for fellowship first as is the bride you know we realize for you I'm a child of God soon as you got a need it's ask ask ask ask ask ask this ask that everything you ask for everything gimme gimme gimme gimme do you ever give back do we ever give fellowship we can learn a small lesson from Esther here when you reach out the scepter to her she didn't say o Great King they're murdering my people can you go save him she said let me prepare you a meal let me serve you a little bit let me give you a little fellowship and she realized who she was and she knew that if she had fellowship with him she would get her request granted so realize if we could realize the power in us you're the Queen of Heaven why are you walking around with a long face why why we walk around defeat it all the time the Queen of Heaven and you think yourself insignificant you think down of yourself when you go down to pray do you say Laura I'm just pitiful I can't do nothing why would you tell God hey I'm your queen but I'm nothing who you are is a revelation who you are is a queen of heaven if you can see it I don't know about y'all but I'm tired of being here I hate this place and maybe maybe I might be the last one to get the revelation Who I am but but I pray this right here is hurrying me up I pray that God is talking to me through this that I can find out my position in my place and you tonight when you go home and tomorrow every day that you live I want to get out here so please pray for a revelation of your position that God will reveal to you if you don't want to leave that's fine I pray God gives you the revelation so I can [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you look at people in the world today they'll sell anything to have there's people that will give millions to go off on a journey I want to find myself won't find out who I really am they'll leave their wives their families their jobs have some psychiatrist get thousands of dollars to tell them who they are and in the end what are they dirty stinking rotten flesh that's all they're gonna find out no matter what some psychiatrist tells you some doctor know much how much money you spend if you're not looking right here you'll never find out who you are and I pray God reveals that to me we sing the song all the time Who am I and that's not what I'm preaching about tonight you know we preach about who am i and in regard to our worthiness to him or his I done dying grace to us it's not that it's about a position it's about who you really are there's a real you sitting here tonight there's a you and there's a real you and I can assure you if you're under this blood there's only one of you that God sees there's only one and God don't see the flesh he don't call us by our names he publishes by the name that he has for us he looks at us has he saw we look for the foundation of the world this is one of my favorite quotes in the entire Bible I mean the entire message brother Branham and 64 this was almost exactly a year before he passed in who do you say this is that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again because his thoughts are being manifest and that's why we are right here this day that's why you're right here god fellowshipping with his thoughts so you are his thoughts being made manifest there you are so you by taking thought cannot add one cubit to your stature you cannot do this that or the other it's God that short mercy it's God all the father has given me will come to me and no man can come except my father draws him that settles it so it's God fellowshipping with his thoughts so tonight if you could ask yourself Who am I really Who am I who are you I hope this can shed a little light one of these quotes I don't know if I have it here or not brother branham said 10 million years before the foundation of the world you were with him you were in his thoughts and so God is sitting up there but the tairy he had a thought of you he thought in the minute that thought of brother Terry came to God's mind his heart begin to beat you'll never express the love just in a thought think the way God loved the thought of relative you'll never be able to express that love so the very minute the very second that God had a thought of brother Terry God desired fellowship with brother Terry and God says I'll do anything okay how long it takes I don't care what happens I'll do anything to have fellowship with brother Terry anything so brother Terry when God said let there be light you were his purpose you were the purpose that God said let there be light when God said let there be anything but the land form the skies brother Terry you were his purpose it was because of you he said let there be he said let there be man and there was man and Godzilla image why because brother Terry was his purpose and God began to speak and everything begin to form because God wanted fellowship with brother Terry God wanted fellowship with you and then man fail why did man fall because God wanted fellowship with brother Terry the fall did not take God by surprise he didn't say I need to rethink this I need to do something different the man failed because God says I want to fellowship with brother Terry and then God had that seed that kept on going through Adam through Seth on down the line why fellowship with brother Terry the seed comes on down through David on down into Bethlehem my son is born God's own son without sin God said I want those she brother Terry wanna kill him go to murder my own son so I can have fellowship but brother Terry I'm gonna murder him if that didn't happen mother Terry whenever he fell she would go you and I would never get fellowship with God so why would God do such drastic things something so terrible the fellowship that's all it was let's fellowship then one day a man and a woman met came together and they had a child it was brother Terry God's heart began to beat more but Terry was born he dropped the seed in there let me put a different way God dropped a part of himself in there you dropped a part of himself God will only have fellowship with himself so he knew the only way he was going to fellowship with brother Terry has put himself in him his first breath come God drops it in there and he watches him it lays in there God will never lose himself God will never lose himself and as brother Terry's life goes on to the school through military through denominations God's heart still beat you knows one day one day the deep is gonna call to the deep end brother Terry because that's who the real Terry is the real Terry was not Terry Horn God says I'm gonna stick it in this vessel that somebody named Terry Horn and I'm going to stick it in there and let us sit down there for a while never watch it but man I just kept God's like I can't wait I can't wait because that's who he really was God in flesh I always thought I'd do a woman of the whale I was reading the scripture the woman in the whale before Jesus was that the whale before she ever got there so she didn't come and Jesus think honey did went over here the whale the real water was already at the whale waiting on her when she got there she didn't have to wait on it you ain't got to go looking for God you you you can't say that the Holy Ghost that you got in your life that was but you received you went and God without the Holy Ghost you was tickled with what you were you were happy with the way you were there's many of you now look back and you probably had it a whole lot better off before you got that Holy Ghost before that this word was revealed to you you was light you liked your life you could say you didn't I'm gonna tell you I had a lot of fun I had a lot of fun before the Holy Ghost ever coming into my life I was raising the message but I had more fun when I was back slid I had more fun you can say what you want it wasn't the right kind of fun but I'm enjoying myself a whole lot more now we read this the mighty God invaded it before us by Bram said now what did this putting the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was given it was giving to her what did it it it made the Messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning she was redeemable the only way you'll ever be redeemable only way as if you were in his thoughts first you can't redeem something you didn't have God's redeeming what he already had so we redeemed her or brought her back when she's seen the expressed scripture manifested of Jehovah what he was what he is it reading her what is it what redeemed her what is it it was her position before the foundation of the world that's what it is that's the it in your life where you was in God's thinking before the foundation of the world that's what we redeemed her back but that's predestination I don't care how you look at it listen Jesus knew she was coming he knew she was coming it was impossible for her not to go to the whale that day don't care what she did where she went she was going to end up at the well at that time in your life if using God's talk before the foundation of the world it was impossible it's impossible for you not to have this here this work have this revert word revealed to you it's impossible for you not to get the Holy Ghost if you were in his thought then brother Branham said you will go back it was something that God had placed in her before the foundation of the world they don't matter where her life went the adultery sin wherever it god says I ain't looking at that well the Terry it didn't matter what she did the denominations it didn't matter what you did before it was who you are it's because of who you are is what you why you received your turn a lot and when I was reading this reading to me people can tell of some great and I'm not preaching this as a doctrine people can take it about predestination and make it a doctrine and that's fine I can only tell you how I see it and that's I'm gonna tell you how I see it it's as simple as I was young I was young when the first time we watched the feeling beat took halls to the deep and that's head of that little simple sermon the deep in God out they're calling it the deep in here because to me that that revealed predestination to me because I was saying the brother Terry had that seed place in his life that part of God placed in his life before the fountain before the foundation world when he took his first breath God dropped it in there and you could say you know I made it I went searching for God I went looking for God I made I made the decision to live this message listen people make a conscious effort every day to read their Bible they make a conscious effort to go to church they and it's all here they make a conscious effort to live a good moral life you cannot seek God unless there's a God in there to seek when brother Brian Priestley beep calling to the deep that portion that was placed in you without that you would have never responded you couldn't respond only God can respond back to God that's the way I see it you can you know if you disagree I'm not here to start a new doctrine I'm just telling you that's predestination how I see it it's to me that simple I never made a choice to be the bride I didn't make a choice to be Gary here son he was the one that was blessed [Applause] he messed up three times before he got me but but I didn't make a conscious effort to be his son his blood runs in my veins anything I can do but do about it you listen they can drain all my blood put somebody else's blood in me take DNA off on my scanner still gonna come up Gary here don't matter but I could have never I never made the choice you never made the choice if God has sealed you before the foundation of the world you can't say I don't wanna be right it'll never be your thoughts it'll never be in your soap and as I was reading that I I got to reading it x19 imagine being in them gentlemen's places the devil said it I don't know you what if you got up in the morning and that was like yes I get him again he's weak if he'll don't know who you are you're lacking something if God is in you he'll knows it hell is gonna know what Bebel is going to know what would you imagine those guys if Satan was to look at when they said we cast out these out in Jesus name in the name of Paul and that one says I don't know you I know who I'd rather hear that from God say I don't know you're Satan say I don't know you I guess most as bad as the other attack but imagine in your life not having the Holy Ghost and you go out and try to venture without authority because you've never gotten the revelation of who you are that's a scary thought but I want to all held into Who I am when all hell - to shape when I get up now I believe that for all of us you know how a lot of tremble when you get up hell out of wish you could sleep for 24 hours hey listen I think the child of God could fight the devil in his sleep come wait if you're asleep or awake because I say this job save this job just to keep you from seeing who you are if he can keep you convinced that's your nothing can keep you down discouraged hey those are blinders those are blinders and Satan puts on you if you can't see who you are if you can't see the word you can't see the your brother your sister he's doing his job he's doing his job he like I said earlier he's not gonna convince you this words not true he's not gonna convince you of that you never will but long as you don't see yourself in it he don't care how much of it you see he'll put things in your life I think I've said this here before last time I preached he'll put things in your life that's not seeing that becomes sin because you put it before God but your job could be sin your hobbies you sports your family your everyday life can hinder you from being the real you we never get a revelation we never get a revelation of who we are we're not asking for revelation we don't you ever wonder why to me when we come in here we sit down and don't matter who's preaching it's like I mean brother JD was talking before if people could come in sit down and thank God speaking to me tonight if God is speaking to me like but we got our favorite preachers I have a favorite God I'll have a favorite God he's here every time but when you when you don't come because your favorite preachers not here your actions are saying that God's not going to speak to that man that's your actions you would never say that nobody would ever say that hey listen I was tempos ad I believe in honesty I've been a Reagan out of time - I have I pray God forgives me for it but I have you know that's human nature that's human nature granted there's you do have I have favorite preachers I do I do I'm my wife's favorite feature - but I've never got to the point that I don't think I praise that I never get to the point to think God can't speak to that man because when we come in here each time we come over here God and God is using someone to pull the wrapper off who we really are we come when it comes down to the rapture it's gonna be all peeled away I was like brother Donnie preaching sometimes rapture is on it's happening you're the rapper is being pulled off this flesh is being pulled off who you really are is being revealed so why are we not getting it why are we not seeing it we've come three times a week are we not letting God pull the wrapper off are we not desiring Lord coming in prayerful praying and reading Lord show me show me more of myself show me more in this work because I know the more that gets peeled off of me the closer I am to the rapture but we come in we sit down we look around who's here what they're wearing service starts we create a side of the song leader we criticize special songs criticize the music the criticizes the preacher by the time the word comes out we've done criticized it everything that we is going to get away how do you expect God to speak to you when you've sitting there with a critical spirit about town the minister comes up listen I don't know I know brother I love preaching brother Jean taro is here brother Jean we'll pull you out of your shoes Oh auntie brother Terry hey hey pulls butt and there are certain people that you could you feel pull when you preach and there's some that push there's some that push and it's it's a push-pull battle if we can get everybody me included when the ministers up here brother Donny's other brother Terry brother Darrell brother Davey pull them what hey I want to see more of myself I want more myself revealed to me and that's what I'm coming for I'm not coming to here man man will do me no good and that's what I desire and what's that's what I longed for when you realize who you are there's nothing there's nothing that Satan can bring against you you can't overcome there's not a thing listen this is a temporary dwelling place that's temporary you were dropped you were interned in eternity in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world and God dropped you down in just a little bit of time but when he dropped you down in time he dropped a part of himself in you and you go through time as you go through time the rapper starts being pulled off and pull it off and pull it off each time you get into the word it gets pulled off to the point to where it's gonna be pulled all the way off and you're going back into eternity that's that's where I want to find myself I want to be able to look in the word and say the rappers coming off me I can see it I know there's still some on me there's still so on but it's coming off the God wants God wants to bless us more than we we want to be blessed listen whenever we go through trials temptations you know what was he called why why do you mind you putting this on me I'm supposed to be a child of God that's why he's giving it to you that's why you go through trials God God don't bless you for being good God don't bless you because you had a good week and you overcome and not that's not God's purpose God blesses you because of who you are he blesses you he gives you that he delivered you He healed you because of who you are your blessings don't you're a good boy here's some candy you did good God's mine don't work that way but you go through tests and trials tribulations because of who you are but Bram said he'll never never give you more than you can bear and he gives you a trial because he trusts you why would God trust you with the trial he knows that's him inside you it's impossible for God not to get their trial but so many times we we suppress the real us we suppress the real us and we can't get through it we try to get food on their own that's like getting through the service sometimes you haven't eaten a service and then you try to get through and his devil just bogging you down he's bogging you down and you want to get through that's his job because he knows God's God's gonna bless you so I was saying he delivers you because of who you are he heals you even when you come down to death when death counts because of who you are death can only do one thing can only do one thing and that is take you right back to where you were where you were before and that's because of who you are and I want to say this is like I sell brother about brother Terry it's God's desires fellowship not too long ago when brother Donny was preaching I was sitting in the back Bella Donna you was just wrapping up the end of a sermon and I was thinking Lord why would you give me eternal life why me why eternal life I'm sure everybody's probably asked that question of themselves why why eternal life why would you give it to me and both Donny had everybody staying and when I stood I've never heard a voice speak to me and I didn't that not never had a voice speak to me but something as loud of a voice as loud as a voice in my heart said he never wants the fellowship to end it's not but he's gonna give you eternal life because you were good here on earth everything good about you is him anyway everything that you are anything that you've done how you treated each other it's him anyway so what was the first thought that God had of you in the beginning fellowship it was all about fellowship but Bram said it fellowship by Redemption when our body comes in tune with God became a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power and omnipotent he has risen from the dead he lives among us today and he wants fellowship back with his people again his great Majesty his glory is now spreading forth and he's designed to fellowship with his people again like he did in the Garden of Eden father and his son fathering a daughter there's our fellowship but you can't have that fellowship without love it requires love fellowship requires love because if somebody wants you to fellowship you gotta ought against that brother and you go fellowship with him there's gonna be some tension yeah that's just the way it is it's uncomfortable God that God don't want that between you and him God wants to fellowship with that part of you that he put there before the foundation of the world that's the only thing he wants to fellowship with he don't want fellowship with his flesh why do you think Christ came and died and took all your sins took all your sins took him right back to hell why because through the blood the only way God can put himself in you is for you that soul to be sinless he will never dwell in a sinful being that is sin God won't touch sin that's why he took your sins put him on the sacrifice and that's what God wants to fellowship with that was his desire but there is to put it in you so we could fellowship with it so as we look down through time everything he done from 10 million years before the foundation of the world everything he'd done had a purpose you look at down through the ages the bride there's gonna be millions and millions and millions of people millions and God had that same desire same thought for each individual every individual did he not think a less of one than he did the other and it requires love but that love needs to be reciprocated back and if God's in you it will because only God can reciprocate love back to God brother Branham said in the sixty and fellowship fellowship comes by love and love requires fellowship if you love your wife you've got to get with her and talk with her if you love your friend you've got to get with him and talk with him and if you love God there's got to be a basis for a fellowship you cannot have complete fellowship and livelihood without these agreements you can't fellowship with your wife your family your friends if there's not a kindred spirit there there's love you love your wife you love your kids let me tell ya I don't like hanging around people I don't like that's just everyone could say actors there's people you don't like I love everybody and I'm sure there's a lot of people who don't like me but that's life and that that's what he's saying that you got to have that that one element there for fellowship that's all God requires that fellowship is the God in you so he can fellowship just I don't know how simple to make that but it's God in you God fellowshipping with God in you if you want to really understand see that clear go back watch the deep cause of the deep as to me the most simple simple is it could be made whilst my spot you cannot be married without an agreement you cannot have a wife without some kind of agreement and that agreement is based upon your vow you cannot have fellowship with God without coming to God's agreement and there's a basic thing for fellowship and that's the blood the blood only it's been God's Way from the beginning and it will be till the end the only place of fellowship is through the blood without that blood without the blood God couldn't have placed himself in you he couldn't he couldn't have done it I always thought of that you know to me when the quote where brother branham said that god murdered his son I always thought he needed you take a man that's got a son an only son say brother Harry Justin's his only son I know brother here he loves me he's my buddy no he loves me he'd never kill his son for me he could never he would never be able to feel that love so when you look back and you look at God you know God loved Jesus loved him it says only Son there were he without sin and God took the only thing in the world without seeing killed it the only thing that was pure to save the dirtiest thing there was how does that make sense and it all was for fellowship fellowship with us so when you look at what does God want why is God gonna rapture us all up to heaven the bride's gonna come in he just wants fellowship God said I had a thought of you before the foundation of the world but when I had that thought of you my heart about beat out of my chest and the only way I can have fellowship with you one is for you to see who you really are and that's me in you and I pray that we we see that any like I said I don't want to be here no more this world is gone there ain't no President and ever it's gonna save it during a congress there's not a Senate there's nothing that's gonna save this place and I don't want to be here I don't care how much better they say it's gonna be it's it's over and I'm ready to get out of here when we get to the point that we begin to see the God in us I really believe will have a higher know how to put it opinion of ourselves we won't put ourselves down so much you think God sits up in heaven and thinks then poor insignificant people them unworthy people I think God's proud of you I think God is shows you off everybody's gonna have a joke moment in more ways than one there's gonna be a time when God tells Satan have you considered brother Tim Mullins we hate those only brother Tim you consider brother Keith I don't want one of their moments but you're gonna get it have you considered my daughter my son have you considered him why would God do that because he's proud of you he was proud of Joe he wanted to show Satan what he could do we've we were all like that we're that way naturally when we have a son or a daughter we want to show them off you want to show them off that's just our human nature I love watching my kids play ball loved it still do that's my hobby that and getting beat by Joel golf those are my hobbies I played for second place all the time but I'm proud of them because they're they're mine those are my kids and they have me and they're inside of them and I want to show them off when my youngest just passed football year kicked the winning field goal over here at Hampton I had more people come up to me congratulating me now I was beside myself but I had people coming up to me congratulate me and I went home later that night thinking about that he's the one that done it but then got to thinking when I was studying this it's because who he was listen when you fall and you get up just to gettin up there celebration going on in heaven there's high-fives going on in heaven because you overcome something you want something when you win a battle when you overcome a test I don't believe I don't believe gods like well it's about time I say that to myself sometimes but I don't believe God says it's about Tom I think he's proud and I don't mean this in a carnal way but I'd say angels are giving God some high fives because why because of who you are they know heaven knows that God is in you heaven knows who you really are how they gonna know where to put you in the table if they don't know who you are [Applause] it's God in you God loves us all the same I don't think that God gives more love to a pastor a preacher than he does to a little kid out here I don't believe that I believe when a pastor or preacher minister an adult it's on their knees crying out to God for a need in the family I believe God's silence is heaven I believe that with all my heart but you take a twelve-year-old girl on the bus ride to school saying god I got a test today God will silence him her prayer it's no less than any other child of God her need is no less God don't look at levels of needs because he can do anything if we could get to the point I'm closer if we could get to the point to realize what God wants us to see in ourselves instead of sticking with the old tradition I'm the Bride of Christ and that's I don't mean to slight that in any way whatsoever call that a tradition but we get that way we get settled we get settled saying I'm the bride of christ on the Bride of Christ well is that something you heard or has it been revealed to you because if it ever revealed to you you're gonna know your position in the bride you're gonna know what God's design your life is and God's desire in our life for all of us this fellowship stand together [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let's bow our heads please Heavenly Father Lord when you gave him this this subject Lord gee you started revealing an opening my eyes and what what you wanted me to see father lord I believe this was for me more than anybody because you know my desire Lord to leave this place but Lord then it's true this is a body move but it's a body move with each one of us recognizing our position Lord Lord and I pray the words that were said father denied it some way somehow or you could touch somebody's heart Lord if you could prick that heart to have that desire Lord as somebody say father's show me who I am reveal more of Who I am Lorca's into that revelation comes father we're not going nowhere lower when your prophet was reading that it was saying that when the bride recognized her position or d1l to say we each need to find our position lord help me to find mine Lord if there's a need here there's all heart desire from someone Lord you know the urgency of each heart Lord I pray that you would touch it Lord may our hearts cry tonight Lord be to show me who I am Laura let me see myself clear let me let me see myself as the Bride of Christ let me see myself as you see me Lord I'm tired of looking at Oh Joe Hara Lord we're reading the scriptures Paul or he saw himself as two men and he said they struggled back and forth they struggled but what I do struggle but I believe you're open in my eyes lord help me to give myself to you - this word help me give myself to this bride hey everyone here do the same father

laid there in there - he did - Swati who was your hoes are wrong so I can rise today wasn't wasn't an how he left his home to die hurry just to save someone live still there's only what they left to say wasn't an wasn't that love how he left his home to the dial just to save someone like me [Music] every day I'm still there's only one to say was and laws of the time [Music] truly truly that's all it can be said was it that love it's truly what of what a real thought and revelation tonight who are you recognizing who we are your position our place we're not just anybody worthy bride surely he said yes that's just a cliche but I am part of the kingdom of God I am a son of God I was with him before the foundation of the world I'm eternally in this sauce I'm gonna be there we're gonna be there we're gonna be there that's what he said he promised it you know we've got to have faith for the rapture it's gonna take more faith in any because côté trapped in faith but he's given he said he gets supreme grace into supreme our everything you have Nita for the Raptors in that sea that's going to be there but we need to cultivate it and recognize true who we are Perry's gonna sing as we close I said you know I'm still amazed I'm still amazed how much God loves me we think about I'm just amazed but yet it's true this little story comes to my mind I think I told her one here one time here years ago really what one person says we are that's really not we are but really some at some point time there's got to be a declaration who we really are there was a man his true story in iris in Ireland and he was caught stealing sheep and so one of the vector two three hundred years ago and so when they caught them what they did they branded them on the forehead with a hot iron st sheep thief and so that was his punishment being a sheep thief and he had to go for years of well the rest his life because he was branded permanently so was it too long after that the man got saved lived in the same community is where he stole the Sheep changed his whole life he got saved lived many many years of a real real Christian life in that same community and finally one of the magistrates that somebody said that's not right that's not right that man bears out that that stigma of st sheep thief for all those years he's not a sheep thief he did that many many years ago so he held up town council if you we'll and call it everybody in the little town together safe I'm gonna make a declaration day that st on his forehead it don't stand for sheep thief anymore it stands for saint he made a declaration of who that man really was no wonder the prophet of God in the first seal could say I'm not going to call you Church I'm gonna call you bride he's making a declaration of who we are but we've got to accept that and realized that's really who we are because his whole ministry was come out of her my people that's what everybody's sitting this building I'm sure has been called out of systems the world or whatever it is we're no longer in it we're in the bride age aren't you happy about that aren't you truly happy when we say brother Terry uu I don't know if I corned it or not but we get to go to church aren't you glad you still get to go to church one day these church doors is going to be closed cherish every minute let's pray Heavenly Father were so thankful for the service and I so thankful Lord that the words that you laid upon brother Joe's heart to bring to us what a tremendous understanding and insight and revelation Lord he Minister us and we can have that revelation and I just pray God that each one maybe it's not to that point where as we all or maybe not all to that a point but maybe some ways far down the road they they continually criticize herself put yourself down I'm not worthy well we're none of us worthy yet lord I believe that I was within your thinking help each one to realize that get that revelation serve God with all their heart come to church live a godly life live above the approach of the world and Lord one day you're gonna catch us home we thank you for that bless brother Joe specially tonight and each one has come out to hear the word of God we pray that you bless each one until we meet tomorrow in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ god bless you you're dismissed for the hair sing for us while we go wasn't that love how he left his home to die on cash just to save someone like me I'm still there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love wasn't down wasn't that how we live this don't care just to save someone life [Applause] [Music] [Music]
