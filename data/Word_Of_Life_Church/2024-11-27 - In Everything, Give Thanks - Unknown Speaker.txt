God bless you you may be seated this evening now tomorrow being Thanksgiving our thoughts naturally turns towards gathering with family and friends and fellow fellowshipping and thanking God for all that he has done and for all that he's given us and that's just wonderful I to me Thanksgiving is one of my favorite times of the year because you can just get together with family and enjoy fellowship and yet many will be like the prophet said speaking about Thanksgiving he said now Thanksgiving Day many people today never thought tens of thousands times thousands and millions of Americans eat dinner today in a Thanksgiving celebration with a turkey on the table and never as much offer a blessing or return Thanks now why is that because the Bible says in 2 Timothy 3:1 know this also that in the last days pearless times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful and Unholy that is the hour and the time and the day that we are living in but I am so thankful tonight that I am gathered here with a group of people called The Believers I'm so thankful tonight that I'm gathered here with the bride of Jesus Christ and to the believer Thanksgiving is not a seasonal tradition it is not a theme to a Believer Thanksgiving is a way of life to a Believer every day is a day of giving thanks to God for the Bible said I will praise the name of God with a song I will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving the Bible says let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms and I say tonight as We Gather here let my voice be heard in a proclamation giving thanks not just on a Thanksgiving day but on every day that I might tell of all of his wondrous Works Hallelujah the Bible said who is liken unto thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful In Praise Jus doing wonders and so tonight for a few minutes with the voice of Thanksgiving I want to make a proclamation of how great our God is can I get an amen tonight I want to make a proclamation on how great our God is and I'd like to say tonight he is there is no God like our God now there's many gods in the world today people make a God out of their job they make a God out of their car there's all kinds of gods but there is no God like our God hallelujah amen there is none like ours the Bible says remember the formal things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me many gods in the world today but there is none like our God he is the true and living God and I am so thankful that the God we serve is not a dead God of stone that we pray to and we cry out to but he has no ability to answer back no ability to heal us no ability to deliver us or a god of someone's imagination I am so thankful tonight that we serve The God Who is able to answer back that you can cry out to our God and he hears your cry and he can answer back amen we serve the Living God tonight he is Almighty he is all powerful he is full of Mercy he he is love our God is love and I am thankful that we can cry out to him and he hears our cry and he sees our tears and our God has the ability to speak back Jeremiah 33 says call unto me and I will answer thee that's right not maybe not hope so not could be not if you hold your hands right not if you say certain words right that's not what he said he said if you call unto me I will answer thee and show you Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not you think of Jona in the belly of a whale a man who had more circumstances than any person I ever heard of more symptoms than any person I anybody here been swallowed by a fish Jonah was swallowed by a fish but he said I cried out to the Lord the Bible said then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of a fish's belly and I cried by the reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice I am so thankful tonight for this Revelation if God can hear the prayer of a man in the belly of a whale then surely he can hear our prayer tonight in a sanctuary set aside for service to him oh hallelujah hallelujah amen David said in Psalms in my distress I called unto the Lord and I cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came up before him even into his ears who is like thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders that's right I am so thankful tonight for the past Wonders of Our God the Wonders that our God performed and I am so thankful knowing that he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he done it then he can do it now amen when he went down to Egypt he brought the children out of bondage he broke their chains he delivered him of their oppression with his mighty hand he delivered him and drowned f Pharaoh's Army in the sea he destroyed Pharaoh's Kingdom when our God went down to Egypt he ched every one of the Egyptian gods showing he was the one and true God Amen he destroyed their Kingdom he destroyed their nation and drowned them in the sea and let me say the devil may try to hold you and you're in his Egypt in a chain of circumstances in a bondage of fear in a chain of Oppression a chain of sickness a chain of addiction a chain of fear despair chains of Darkness but I am so thankful for this Revelation if God done it once he can do it again and when God comes to your Egypt he breaks the chains of bondage he breaks the chains of Oppression and he sets the captive free when God comes to your Egypt Satan's kingdom comes down hallelujah hallelujah I am so thankful with the voice of Thanksgiving I will declare he is the true and living God I am thankful for the revelation of who we are not who we're going to be but who we are now H but said I didn't come to mix up a Doctrine but I come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and this scare that you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be but you are now Sons and Daughters of God you always were Sons and Daughters of God thank you buddy amen so he said I didn't come to mix up a Doctrine but I come to straighten one out to get away from the fear and the scare that you don't know see the devil don't you see that's his desire is to keep us in a state of Amnesia that we don't know where we come from and we don't know where we're going and we don't know who we are but our God doesn't want us to live that way he wants you to know where you come from he wants you to know where you're at he wants you to know where you're going and he wants you to know who you are amen hallelujah amen the Bible says in Colossians 1:12 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light meat it means to make sufficient to render fit to be equipped one with adequate power to perform the duties of wood he has equipped us with the power to perform the duties of of what Sons and Daughters of God Oh Glory Jesus said I am the light of the world he that follow me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life then he turned around and said he said I'm the light of the world then he turned over and said ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hid you see the evening light is not just the the name of the Tabernacle it's not just the name of the church but the E what is the evening light it's you you are the evening light amen you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people yes that's right that you should show forth the Praises of him which have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light I'm thankful for that tonight in this blind darkness of Le oosa God has given us light amen you see man was made to be God yeah that's right don't never get too many amens out of that yet it's the message that's actually a quote that's what the prophet said I'm quoting from the prophet man was made to be a God and God was made to be man oh Messiah the great Jehovah dwelt in a human body made that body like his so he could be a human body a messiah to govern this Earth and control it amen The Works that I do shall you do also oh I like that Jehovah walks backwards and forth over his throne and says them are my eaglets yay they are Flesh of My Flesh they are bone of my bone they are borned of my spirit they are washed in my blood they are mine they're mine amen anything I tell them they believe it why they are eagles that's what what they are they're Eagles just the same as I am an eagle they're the little Gods where I'm the big God that's right I'm Jehova Papa and they are my children there you are so he promised these things to be taking place now if we're the children of his kingdom the Bible said who ha delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into this Kingdom of his dear son know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture then the God we worship we did not make with our hands the God we worship made us with his hands amen I am thankful tonight that he wrote our name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the prophet said I'm thankful that he wrote name with his before the foundation of the world he wrote your name with Jesus name not in just a book not just in a book but in the Lamb's Book amen the believer he said have you got your joy shoes on listen to this if you're a Christian anybody here like that tonight well praise God we got a few amen listen if you're a Christian then you're truly a child of God the Bible that's no preacher that's the Bible it says your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the same time that Christ God sent Christ to be slain he wrote your name with his Hallelujah there you are your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life he said and he deceived all great and small so many were church members pretended Christians he deceived all whose names were not written in the church book but in the Lamb's Book of Life when before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word and sent Christ the sacrifice to buy to redeem that same group that he wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen I am thankful for that Revelation tonight to know that my name was wrote with his yeah before the foundation of the world is that true then when did God know us long before you was born he knew you I'm so thankful tonight that we're not feeding on a Creed or a Dogma or some man's ideal the prophet said the angel was not the son of man he he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and I say to you tonight what a Thanksgiving feast that is amen remember remember you are what you eat I'm so thankful tonight for the name of Jesus John was 6 months without moving anyone knows that's subnormal three to four months at the most and here's 6 months and he hadn't moved but as soon as she heard that salutation in her ear from Mary another one expecting another one expecting both of them and when Mary said and called the name of the Lord Jesus the first time that name was ever spoken human lips a little dead baby in the womb of its mother leap for joy and John received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb and began leaping for Joy At The Mention Of The Name of Jesus I'm so thankful we have the revelation of the name of Jesus and if the First Time The Name of Jesus was ever spoken human lims made a dead baby leap in its mother's womb for Joy what ought it to do in a Born Again Church to get Faith for power he said I'm not excited I know where I'm at see but I just get the feeling good sometimes when I go to talking about these things that's right because it's true the name of Jesus Christ has life and when it's spoke with power and Faith there isn't nothing that'll stand in its presence that's exactly right oh sure Sons and Daughters of God every man today knows he can take the name of Jesus Christ and meet any foe any place any time and they will be defeated I've met Witch Doctors I've met Demons of all sort and I've never seen the time but what they bowed to the name of Jesus Christ I tell you Friends when the church lost the name of the power in the name of Jesus Christ that's when they lost it but let me tell you tonight we have not lost the power but that name has been given unto us amen amen is that not true friends what is the bride called Mrs Jesus Christ she takes his name why she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit she is him expressed on the earth amen once more the light Hallelujah the light of the world is not in the man Jesus it's now in the bride amen I'm thankful for that Revelation tonight we are not a Creed we are not a denom we are not a they try to make us a cult but we are not a cult we are the body of Jesus Christ represented on the earth amen hallelujah At The Mention Of His name when we speak that name upon our lips the dead is raised blinded eyes come open and the lame get up and walk don't you tell me he can't do it I've witnessed it I've seen him do it I've been there when he done it amen hallelujah there's power in the name of Jesus to break every chain to break every chain what did the prophet say when Temptation rounds you gathers breathe that holy name in prayer and watch demons scatter amen see I don't come in my name I don't come in my name I come in his name I'm thankful for that name tonight I'm thankful for the blood that atones for our sins for what can wash away our sins nothing nothing but the blood of Jesus brother is talking about this woman since she was a character police courts records everything a gun mole and now notice but tonight she's a lovely woman to be a mother settled down to a good God saved Christian what a difference what did that where everything else where the law failed where houses of Correction fail where Medical Science fail the blood of Jesus Christ took up and it canot fail the blood of Jesus can not fail Why by faith why the power of of God that would change a prostitute to a saint a drunker to a righteous man I'm so glad that he does it tonight thank you Lord hallelujah can I get a witness for somebody when we was held in the bondage of alcohol and all kinds of nonsense but God rich in his Mercy provided a blood for us hallelujah I'm so glad for that tonight when I went to try to tell my friends that I had met Jesus and what a difference he made in my life me and I was in the army with and they said where you been Ward and they want I don't drink no more you I don't smoke no more what I just come to tell you about Jesus and they begin to laugh at me and make fun of me and Cat call me and I left that house and I went out and I sat in the car and I said Lord I've lost every friend that I have I don't have a friend left and a voice spoke to my heart and said I will be your friend there is no friend like the lovely Jesus he'll pick you up out of a gutter he'll forgive you when you fail come on somebody I'm not talking about me tonight I'm not talking about you tonight I'm talking about the lovely Lord Jesus who said his blood amen that we could stand in his presence as though we never even done it amen hallelujah the power of God that would change a prostitute to a saint a drunk or to a righteous man why that by the same power will take any cancer deaf dumb blind crippled for the same blood from the same man on the same day atoned for your healing that atones for your salvation you see when he died at Calvary not only did he die for your sins but he died for your healing the same man that died oh my is the same man that gave his blood for your healing on the same day well if the Lord would only heal me you're already healed amen yes sir you're already healed is that not what the prophet T us is that not what the message teaches us but said if Jesus Christ stood here right now in the suit that he gave me he could not heal you he's already done it and if you can realize if he died to save us if he died to for our sins then that same by the stripes that was on his back was for our healing it took place on the same day yes that's right from the same man the same blood from the same man on the same day atone for your healing that atones for your salvation that's the truth he was wounded for your transgression and with his stripes you're healed The Blood Run exactly off the same man at the same day the same man at the same day there is a blood that sights the blind that heals the sick the lonely finds it has the power to free the bound as chains they fall up on the ground amen I'm thankful for all these things tonight and we could go on and more and more and spend all night talking about things that we're thankful for that God has done for us and listen to me it's easy to give God praise when everything is going good when you're on the mountain shouting the victory it's easy amen it's easy to holler Amen in church when you're on the Mountaintop sir amen it's easy shouting the victory it's easy to thank him for his blessings when you're enjoying the blessings but what about when you're in the valley and everything seems like it's going wrong you're sick and you're lonely you feel like God is a million miles from you what are you to do then when the doctor's report is so negative and our children are so rebellious us against us what are we supposed to do when we're heavy with sorrow and bitterness is in our marriages when we're battling the afflictions of our body that will not let go and you constantly have to push it back off of you come on now what are you to do then yes sir it's easy to think God when everything's going good and the bills are paid and you're on fire and you can't wait to get to church what do you do when you're so sick you can't hardly get one shoe on or your back is so bad you have to pray to get out of the car what do you do then but I want you to know tonight that God has given us three Mighty weapons for times such as these and these weapons are found in 1 Thessalonians 5:116 three weapons that just lays there but if you use these weapons it will make such a vast difference in your lives not so much when you're on the Mountaintop but when you're in the valley I've been there have you yeah amen they're found in 1 Thessalonians 5:16 the Bible says Rejoice ever more yes that means at all times it means always yeah Rejoice well I don't feel like it he didn't say that always Rejoice Rejoice everm more verse 17 pray without ceasing yes the prophet said prayer is the greatest weapon ever placed in the hand of a human being more powerful than an atomic bomb oh yeah amen and when you're in a belly of a fish and everything is against you you can take this weapon of prayer and cry out to a God who hears your words amen hallelujah and sometimes when you don't even know what to pray you don't even know what to say but the prophet said sometimes he doesn't even see your words he just sees your heart and I am so glad Brother David because there has been times I have gone out into the woods and I've knelt B before a tree and I couldn't even pray I didn't even know what to pray and I would just say the ABCs because I knew God was able to take the letters of the alphabet and say what my heart was trying to say Amen Rejoice ever more at all times pray without ceasing and verse 18 says this in in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you now the Amplified Bible says it this way in every situation no matter what the circumstances are be thankful and continually give thanks to God wonderful for it is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus you see he didn't say we wouldn't have trouble he didn't say we wouldn't go through hardship he didn't say that we would have sorrow in our lives but he did say when you have these times don't pout don't quit amen just start praising him yeah just start thanking him you say what good would that do I'm going to tell you in just a second Amen in those times in those times some of the hardest times of our life life when you just throw up your hands not to quit but to praise him and to thank him for his goodness and to thank him for his Mercy in every situation no matter what the circumstances be thankful and continually give thanks to God for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus circumstances you see circumstances and situations does not change who God is the biggest problem you've ever faced in your life did not change who God was that's right amen he was still a Healer he's still a deliverer but praise power praise is power yes it and when you praise him and you pray with a Thanksgiving heart what does it do it turns the focus from your problems to the God who can fix them see as I've said many times the devil wants you to see the clouds but not the sun he wants you to see the storm but not the Sun but if you can turn your thanks if you can turn in your darkest hour and just start praising God just start thanking the lord for his goodness what does it do it refocuses from your problem to the God who can fix the problem you see Thanksgiving giving thanks to God focuses our attention on God rather than our circumstances if we fix our eyes on the difficulty then the pain becomes unbearable peace eludes us and the situation seems hopeless because all you're looking at is this report that says your daughter will never see again never walk again never talk again never feed herself again never go to school again that's what the MRI said that's what the CT scan said that's what the doctor said that's what your friends at work said and if that's all you ever focus on that's all you've ever got but in the midst of your greatest trial when you say God I'm going through a hard time God I really need you but I'm calling on you to do something big because I believe you're a big God I believe you can still open blinded eyes you can still make the lab walk you can still make cancers disappear you can still raise the dead no matter how great my problem is no matter how hard the sorrow is it is not greater than you so I will not focus on my problem I will not focus on my sickness I will not focus on the battle but I will focus on my general who's leading me in battle amen the situation seems hopeless but giving thanks shifts our Focus to the Lord and reminds us that we can know for certain that we're not alone but going through a hard time I know that but you're not alone we're not alone he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you he didn't just say now when you're on the mountain I'll be right there but when you're in oh no remember the the remember the story where the guy was looking back on the footprints on the sands of time in some of the most difficult times of his life in the great times of his life he noticed there was two set of footprints but in the deepest darkest times of his life he noticed there was only one set of footprints he said I don't understand he said why when I needed you the mo in the good times he was walking right beside me but in the bad times in the darkest times of my life there's only one a Footprints where were you when I needed you and he said Son you don't understand the good times of life I was walking with you but in the darkest times of your life that one set of footprints that you see they're not yours they're mine it was them times that I was carrying you we're not alone God is with us thank you Lord he loves us we're eternally secure we just saw that he wrote our name in his Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and nothing can take that name off that book we're secure the Lord walks with us he will bring us through God will turn the experience into something profitable in our lives because you see we have this promise according to Romans 8:28 what does it say we know that all things all things work together for good to them that love God Amen all things and sometimes we don't understand the moing and the training listen as a young preacher I used to preach God open blinded eyes and he made the lame walk I preached that I believe that but I never witnessed that I never seen that even though I believed that and I preached it yet I had never witnessed it until Jessica got hurt and then the God that I preached about that open blinded eyes I saw it I experienced it and now when I stand in a pull pit and I tell you God can open blinded eyes I don't tell you that because I've never experienced it I'm telling you that because I've experienced it I've seen it I know that he can do it and I would have never had that experience without going through that dark time so you see all things work to the good that God will mold you he'll bring things into your life that'll mold you and shape you in the way he wants to use you and as I told someone you know during the with taking the supplies over to North Carolina trying to help those poor people over there I told the people when we prayed you know I said God let us be your hands let us be your feet and I told him there's more ways for Show Jesus there's more ways to show Jesus than behind the pull pit true and God will mold us and shape us the way he wants to use us that he can show his light through us God will turn this experience into something profitable for our lives according to Romans 8:28 we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose his purpose you see Thanksgiving energizes us physically and emotionally and spiritually in in difficult times giving thanks to God in the most difficult times of our life it energizes us wow thank you Lord when you start praising God no matter how dark the trial is and you just start worshiping him and all of a sudden I've seen it many times in church I call it a piggyback blessing I've seen people I've sit back there on the seat and I've seen someone get a blessing I've seen the spirit of the Lord come up on them and they start rejoicing and you know what I do I say pour it on them Lord bless them real good set them on fire I just start thanking the lord for that blessing upon that person's life and you know what the next thing I know it's on me amen I call it a piggyback blessing because I don't know what else to call it but I know it works because there's something about it that in your darkest times when you begin to worship God there's a change takes place in our lives well what would be better well God can't help me I guess I'm too far gone there's no hope for me the doctor says it's the worst case he ever saw how's that going to help us how's it going to help us it'll never help us it'll just make us dig deeper and deeper in the muck of Despair on but when the doctor says I'm sorry and you say sir I appreciate that I thank you for all that you've done for me but I've got another oh god I've got another doctor's manual here and according to this manual here it says I'm already healed amen and you know what they'll do when you do that they'll just kind of patch you on the shoulder ask me how I know that yeah amen but you know when everything was said and done this doctor's report was right amen for this report says he opens the eyes of the blind Heath anointed me to Open the Eyes of the Blind and to make the lame walk Oh Glory Thanksgiving energize es us physically emotionally and spiritually in difficult times pain oh God pain and trouble and disappointment drains us anybody had a constant chronic pain day in and day anybody had back trouble you know what I'm talking about day in and day out the pain never L up you can't sleep you become irritable everywhere you're action would be somewhere else because you think if you go there it won't hurt as bad and when you get over there it hurts just as bad anybody know what I'm talking about pain and trouble and disappointment drains us [Music] physically but trusting God focusing on him and thanking him revitalizes us it's his presence within us that renews us physically spiritually and emotionally so that we can keep going when we just L up our hands and start praising the Lord Brother Donnie sent me this article not knowing what I was going to even speak on but he sent me this article Yesterday by text it it was in the news that said giving thanks giving thanks to God can make you happier and healthier wow experts say the Thanksgiving holiday is all about being grateful for what's present in your life and giving thanks can only provide an unexpected Health boost sounds to me like that's better than insure cuz this is I'm sure hallelujah amen it's all about being grateful and thanking God it gives you an unexpected Health boost practicing thankfulness gratitude practicing gratitude has been shown to improve people's mood and mental health according to experts so in the good times when everything's going good I'll throw up my hands not to quit but to give God praise and when everything's going hard and everything's against me and it seems like there's no way out you know what I'm going to do I'm going to throw up my hands not to quit but to give God praise thank you Lord oh my as that song says I like it it is so good I just throw up my hand start praising the Lord I won't give up cuz I'll stand on his infallible word when God sees my hands raised he comes down and inhabits my praise I got a dynamite plan Satan just can't stand when I throw up my hands amen when I'm faced with a trial there's only two ways I can go I can face it with a smile or let it bring me down low Satan Whispers you're through but I hear Jesus just tell me to stand what am I going to do I think I'll just throw up my hands I'll just throw up my hands start praising the Lord I want to thank him for the Revelation that he's always with us and he never ever forsakes us the prophet said I'm very very thankful for what he's done for us the great mysterious hand of the Living God what greater thing could be how much more a privileged people could we be than to have our presence the King of Kings the Lord of lords we would probably blow whistles and hoist flags and lay out carpet and everything for the president of the nation to come to the the city but just to think that would be all right it would be an honor to the city but think in our little humble Tabernacle tonight we're inviting the King of Kings God and we don't he don't desire carpets to be thrown out and so forth he desires Humble Hearts to be laid out that he might take these Humble Hearts and reveal to them the good things that he has in store for all those who love him amen so much we can thank him

can line up to preach but Whose desire is to be in the will of God to declare the gospel of God to stand for truth to declare it before the multitudes of hundreds or whether it's just a few but to be
