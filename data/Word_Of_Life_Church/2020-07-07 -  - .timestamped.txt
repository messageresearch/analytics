[0:00] now Watson verse 12 not as Cain who was
[0:08] of that wicked one let me read you this
[0:15] from Jean Gil who was of the wicked one
[0:18] Satan he was a child of his an imitator
[0:23] of him one that appeared to be under his
[0:26] influence to belong to him so that you
[0:29] say of Cain that he was of the side of
[0:32] the serpent now I thought we were the
[0:36] only strange ones that believed serpent
[0:38] seed but John Gill and some of these
[0:42] other men were gonna read you about
[0:43] tonight that wrote back in the 1500s and
[0:45] the 1600s and the 1700s believe the
[0:48] strange thing and John who lived back
[0:51] 2,000 years ago said the cane was of the
[0:54] devil raised the Lord all night so that
[1:01] you say have came that he was of the
[1:02] side of the serpent that o serpent the
[1:04] devil that old serpent the devil as the
[1:09] way of the serpent is destroy him to
[1:11] kill so Cain immediately became a murder
[1:13] and again because Cain came from the
[1:15] side of the Angel of Death he slew his
[1:19] brother listen to this from the Bible
[1:22] exposition commentary Cain is an example
[1:25] of a life of hatred Cain is not
[1:27] presented as an atheist he is presented
[1:31] as a worshipper and this is the point
[1:35] children of the devil masquerade as true
[1:37] believers they attend religious
[1:40] gatherings as Cain did they may even
[1:41] bring offerings but these actions in
[1:44] themselves are not valid proof that a
[1:46] man is born of God the real test in his
[1:49] love is for the Brethren where Cain
[1:51] failed
[1:54] every man has a spiritual lineage as
[1:57] well as a physical cane spiritual fire
[2:00] wise the devil taints attitudes and
[2:06] actions originated with Satan Cain was a
[2:10] murderer and a liar like Satan was st.
[2:12] John 8:44 he murdered his brother and
[2:15] any lied about it
[2:19] now lies hidden leave commentaries with
[2:22] Lester's quotes every member Cain wasn't
[2:25] an infidel Cain was a believer this is
[2:29] going to shake the gizzard out of you so
[2:33] if you got a gizzard in you to nod I
[2:35] guess this clothes gonna shake it out
[2:38] which I hope it does because only
[2:40] chickens got gizzards you know evening
[2:43] Eagles don't have gizzards I guess I
[2:45] hope it does some of you fundamentalists
[2:48] and put a heart in you that's right a
[2:50] hard to believe
[2:51] Cain was religious and a believer he
[2:55] came up and built an altar to the Lord
[2:57] with just as much faith
[2:59] that's what Abel did I want to watch
[3:06] want you to watch something god it's
[3:08] just so you believe that audience he is
[3:09] absolutely just enough God on a requires
[3:11] of religion Cain was just as just as
[3:14] Abel was both those boys came before God
[3:16] Cain wasn't a communist he wasn't an
[3:19] infidel an unbeliever he was a believer
[3:23] if God only requires a believer he was
[3:27] unjust to condemn Cain I wonder hemming
[3:30] around the message and what do we call
[3:31] him the same thing Cain was called
[3:32] believers why we substitute believers
[3:38] from being born again if you got the
[3:39] Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost
[3:40] why because people can say more positive
[3:42] yes I'm a believer yes I'm a believer
[3:44] but pinpointing are you born again you
[3:46] know I don't know our hope I you know
[3:48] why don't you see what it is it's easier
[3:49] to say well I'm a believer I follow the
[3:51] message ah brother darling should good
[3:53] man I'm a believer I'm a believer all
[3:54] the tangka say exactly the same thing I
[3:56] want to say more than came to say
[3:58] [Applause]
[4:00] came to say I'm a believer he could say
[4:02] I'm sincere I'm a worshipper I love God
[4:05] I want to say more than that I want to
[4:07] say that too I want to say I'm a
[4:09] believer I'm a worshipper I'm sincere
[4:11] but I want to say I'm born of God I
[4:14] passed some death unto life and one way
[4:17] I know is I don't want to murder anybody
