down to that's the only thing that's gonna get us through Amazing Grace amen amen we can do a lot of things you know that how I've been thinking a lot about just what we've been hearing about predestination and and there's two two classes of people that hate the word that's coming forth to real legal people because they're the ones that are doing it all they don't want God to do nothing with it uh-huh right and then you've got the real liberal people that say oh I'm predestinated we got to find that middle of the road Amen I didn't come here to preach that what's wrong with you god bless you if you would turn with me to Genesis chapter 12 we want to look at verses one through three and I'll have you be seated just let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we certainly love you Lord we're so amazed father daily father how blessed we are how much Lord Jesus you must really love us how much you must really care for us Lord Lord Jesus as we come before your people Lord ah I need you to help me to get out of the way Lord calm my nerves Lord Jesus in just just step in behind me Lord Jesus Lord not only my nerves Lord Jesus but the people father we just pray the church soothing presence would come down father and just help us to get out of the way Lord Lord Jesus I've studied I've looked Lord I'm not bound by notes Lord Jesus I pray your Holy Spirit would just move father each person the Lord Jesus in this building represents a need father and you're more than willing and not only more than willing Lord but you want to meet each and every need father and with a crowd that side Lord it looks impossible but Lord Jesus nothing is impossible with you I pray that you just help us anoint this service father God we ask it in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hmm now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed may the Lord had his blessings whose word you may be seated we're gonna Lord when we're going to try and look at something and I've got to watch the time I preached once on Sunday so I tend to go a little bit long but don't worry and don't worry about it we're gonna we're just gonna let the Holy Ghost lead us and he'll cut out what he needs to cut out and we'll get what we need to get and we'll get home on time so I've been wrestling with a thought here and I didn't know where to start and Lord just kind of laid this on my heart I preached us some of this I guess two weeks ago but we're looking at Abram and I wanted to open with this scripture to kind of put him in his where he is right now now we know that he was in her and and God called him to separate himself and he brought his his his daddy and his his nephew along with him and so he had received the promise okay he hadn't received the name change but he had received the promise okay and so he was on the way to something he was going somewhere now he hadn't accomplished much at this point he just started out okay so so here here he is he's he's he stepped out any auntie's he's accepted the promise but he's not really accepted the promise because you can't accept the whole promise without accepting the whole word now let me say that again because that's important you can't accept the whole promise without accepting the whole word you got to take it all it's not a spiritual buffet you got to take it all okay so Abram he's starting out in he's walking in this direction now he's got an end point he's got a goal God calls him the father of Nations he said among you all the nations will be blessed you're gonna be the father of Nations I'm gonna start something in you I'm gonna begin a good work in you so Abrams just got saved okay he's just got saved now I'm not gonna for the sake of time I'm not gonna go through all the things that he he went through buddy he's been saving it at some point he he gets his name changed right in and it takes it takes him going down to Egypt twice and lion and getting into trouble and it takes him all these all these different things and we're all familiar with the story but but as he's walking as he's going and trying to get to the place that God has sent him to and it started him out for he's made a lot of mistakes in he and he's grown up he's grown up he's saying God I you know at first I believed that you wanted to make me a father of Nations but I didn't believe you were serious about all that other stuff and he started walking and he learned that God was serious about everything that he said separate yourself listen to me obey me do what I asked you to do he's he's starting to understand exactly what God had wanted him to do so he's moving from salvation to sanctification justification he's done he's starting to add these things to him now we're gonna skip ahead to Genesis 27 keep your Bibles where I read a lot out of the Bible so I'm sorry it's not Genesis 27 Genesis 22 so all these years Abram and he's changed his name to Abraham all these years he's been testifying right he's testifying saying I'm the father of Nations Ivan changed my name to be the father of Nations I've got a testimony that I'm a father of Nations we've got a testimony that were the bride right any any ladies walking that way any any and he's testifying of this okay everybody knows that he's not just Abram anymore he's the Abraham and it comes to fruition he has a son the promised son starting to happen and I believe that the word coming forth right now and things are starting to happen in our lives revelation upon revelation brother Don he's been preaching on the riemann it's starting to drop down we're starting to understand a little bit of who we are what we what we're supposed to be doing and and how we fit in this great big puzzle of God and so it's starting to happen for us we're starting to testify we're starting to be able to say hey I'm the bride I'm the one that was in the back part of his mind I'm the one who he thought of that's me ah and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham Abraham and said unto Him Abraham and he sold and he said behold here am I so he's attentive to it wasn't like a hesitation it wasn't he didn't have to do great things but he said Abraham and Abraham responded so he's in the mind of the Lord and he said take now thy son that only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee to the land of Moriah and offer him up him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the of wait a minute here's the manifestation of his testimony Isaac is the manifestation of his testimony that's what he testified of for so many years he said I am the father of Nations and for years he had to wait 25 years before this even happened and now it's manifested and he's lived in that glory for a little while he's got 13 years or so right he knows exactly he says my testimony is manifested before you here it is and we're starting to see the things the attribute of attributes of God starting to be added to us we're starting to see this stuff happen in our lives we're seeing testimonies we're seeing things that that the things that we kind of wavered on before we're starting to establish ourselves a little more and now God says you know that testimony you've been so proud of you know that thing you've been so proud of let's go take it on the mountain we're going to sacrifice whoa wait a minute now god I've trusted you a long time right I've been through thick and thin with you God but this is what your trials do for you this is what your hard times do for you let's read on a little bit so he's God is giving him instruction about how to - he's testing his testimony he is testing his testimony because he's not the father of Nations quite yet but he's got a real good start on it but he's not he's right there in Abraham rose up early in the morning whoa I don't about you but when I'd read something then I know I've got to do in the day I kind of pull the covers up right you know you got to face something that day knew it Oh coming Abraham break it down boom he pops out of bed trials trials he said he said I've been through this with you God time and time again I tried to help you out it didn't turn out so good for me I got in bad situations and you got me out of them so if you're telling me that I've got to test my testimony good morning good morning I'm Steve I'm fixing to see you move one more time part of the manifestation of this ride it's going to be able to face things head-on we're gonna be able to pop out of our beds as it were say devil what do you got for me how are you gonna test this testimony and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him hit his straight out let's go he's still being led from God he didn't get frustrated with God and said I can't believe we're going through this again God oh boy I don't want to face this you're a good god you know I love you I'm your bride you've been telling me that I'm the father of Nations let's just skip all this let's just step right over this Guardian you know we're close enough close enough to home let's just skip this stuff God mm-hmm he said let's go let's go I want to see your glory and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and took the fire that was in his hand and a knife and they both of them together and they went both of them together and I was expecting to Abraham his father and said My Father and he said here am I my son and he said Behold the fire in the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering oh my Abraham just doing what God told him to do press song press song this is not an age brothers and sisters to dread serving god this is not a time to say oh god I just don't know how I can do it oh god how am I gonna how am I gonna face this thing Oh God it seems so heavy seems so hard he went to the mountain for a sacrifice he didn't know how was gonna work out he didn't know how God was gonna put all the pieces in place he had a lot of wandering in his mind he was human but he'd been through enough to know he'd been through enough to know that God was gonna fill in the blanks he was gonna take God at His Word he was gonna say all right God you said I was gonna be the father of nation right here I'm standing in front of my the manifestation of my testimony is right in front of me and you're telling me to go up to the mountain and kill it how's that gonna work I don't know but I trust you [Music] but I trust you I know it's gonna work out God does not get angry if you if you wonder in your mind he knows we're human he knows we've got this flesh on a steel [Applause] when he gets upset with us is when we delay and we worry we've got a negative attitude we have this wimey thing going on hey I know I'm not the only one guilty that we all go through things we all have to face things and it's it's okay to wonder okay God what are you doing but he don't like to have that negativity it's okay to wander but don't don't don't see here I don't see teri going through nothing like this you better watch it all that is is an invitation to get the heat turned up that's all it is you might have sway see gone mmm nothing for this fat boy he ain't doing that no more and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told her him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood I skipped a verse here verse 5 neighbor ahem said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I in the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you he had all the ingredients for a sacrifice who is him I didn't he was like we're still missing something but he had all the ingredients he went up the mountain with all the ingredients and he knew he knew to fulfill the promise to fulfill the promise let me say it again real slow he knew to fulfill the promise him and lad would come back his testimony was I will be the father of Nations God changed my name from Abram to miss Jesus Christ he went through all that trouble to change my name God has gone through all that trouble to change you to move you to take you from a rotten wrench change your attitude change your name to miss Jesus Christ so it don't matter how many times your testimony is tested or what you're going to go through you're going up the mountain and you're coming back down the mountain holiday glory dogs it means something to me because life isn't always easy there's times where this old flesh wants to string somebody up and my testimonies tested this is just brother John I'm gonna be honest with you I've got issues and you all do too because if you didn't we'd be raptured by now so our testimonies are tested they're tested I'm the bride of Jesus Christ but I wanna get you boy we go up the mountain we're gonna come back down the mountain man let's let's turn we're gonna look at one more one more little bit and then we're gonna go into something else let's go to Acts chapter 23 yo brother branham and I've got quotes here but brother branham he talks about that this is thus saith the Lord 100% let's say they don't fail it's not sure sometimes I think we forget that that's the say at the Lord becomes a book sometimes it just you you read it and you see the promises in there but it's hard to grasp it's hard to embrace sometimes because it's become so common to us but that's the fatal it's good for whatever ails you [Music] x-23 verse 11 and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at Rome my baubles red-letter that's the 5th Ward right he said you testified me of me and Jerusalem now you're going to Rome now let's turn to acts 27 41 and falling into a place where two seas bent they ran the ship aground and the four-foot part stuck fast and remain unmovable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves and the soldiers council was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape I should probably tell you that this was two years after that prophecy two years he went through a lot in those two years bondage your time you talk about the bondage of time two years and he was in prison the whole time he was in captivity they bound him up and they every now and then they dragged him out and he had to testify [Applause] he'd have to testify and then they dragged him back have you ever been through one of those trials just doesn't seem like it ends god you promised me that this was going to happen that was going to happen I feel it in my heart you said I will be healed your word says that I could be healed your word said that I don't have to live with this this oppression this depression this or that your that's what your word says and you told me to take you at your word that's what you told me to do and Here I am with this thing on me steel steel the doctors say it's no good I don't feel any good and it's not only an illness but but we go through a lot of things that seem like they just press on and on and on two years then he finally gets released to go to Rome like god you're so good thank you Lord I'm so glad I'm serving you hmm then he gets stuck in the sand and the boat breaks apart and he hears the soldiers whispering get off get away let's just kill them let's take care of this hmm Paul testified I'm going to Rome I'm going to Rome I'm going to room don't look like Rome to me you still on a boat buddy you're still in the midst of this trial you're still right in the middle of this thing don't look like Rome to me but the Centurion willing to save Paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim could cast themselves first into the sea and get the land so God has made away God has made away Paul already told them we're not going to lose anybody he said we're not going to lose anybody and he softened the Centurions heart these guys are killers man they didn't care kill them they're prisoners the worthless right the devil says about you that's exactly what he says about you why do you even fool with this guy he's worthless let's get rid of him yeah that's what he wants to do he wishes to sift us like wheat yeah let's go down at chapter 28 and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called I want to say Malta but it's not it was an island in the barbed Barrios people showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received every one of us because the the present reign and because of the cold so God gives Paul some relief he's got some friendly friendly people there he said they showed us no little kindness they well couldn't see him built us a fire and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand and anybody been in snake bit I'm not talking literally been snake bit been snake bit you have trouble do you have trials have your flesh get over then snake bit Paul was doing a service he's putting more wood on the fire he was doing a service to his brother and sisters got snake bit he wasn't looking for trouble don't come crying to me if you're looking for trouble and you get snake bit [Music] you can ask my children don't come crying to be you go out and you find your big brother and punch him in the head no come crying to me if he punches you back you give a little sometimes you get a lot you better be careful I know that's a little unconventional these days but that's what I am but here they are Paul was doing a service and it gets snake bit his good was evil spoken of he's trying to do the right thing and he gets snake bit and he shook the Beast into the fire and felt no harm he did not reach up for the onion tini he didn't defend himself he just said no I'm not putting up with it I'm not going to acknowledge I am NOT going to take my time to acknowledge the devil we spend as Christians too much time praising the devil ouch we spend too much time giving the devil glory for what he's done to us too much time that's just like brother branham talk about reaching for the onion team you're gonna feel the effects of the burn the minute you acknowledge that burn and so when the devil gets you like I said you're not looking for him but we all have that punch we've all got that thing yours is different than mine maybe but we've all got it [Music] there's nothing what why did the devil be send away from God why what is God object worship right so when you worship something you're acknowledging it right so the whole purpose of the devil is to get you to acknowledge him and worship Him that is his whole goal I know this sounds funny but if you think about it's 100% true that's what he wants to do he wants worshipers he wants followers so if he can get you to acknowledge him go around and like brother Jewell says say wowsie wowsie whoo look where I'm at oh and he can get that plane over and over in your mind he's accomplished his task he's done what he came to do I'm getting to the point by God's grace I'm not acknowledging him anymore I understand the grace of God that is the the thing that's lacking the most in the church I believe MA within my heart that's what I think they don't understand the grace of God the grace of God is not loose living but the grace of God is not law the grace of God is an understanding that God is trying to protect us from ourselves that's all it is it's not do's and don'ts don't you do this don't you do that I'm not a mean dad cuz I tell my kids not to touch the hot stove I'm trying to prevent them from harm so holiness is to prevent us from harm don't overthink it don't overcomplicate it don't go around feeling defeated cuz you you you want so bad to trim your hair or wear long dresses or wear short dresses I guess that that's what a man watch your language or turn your head that's the Great's of Dawg what do we talk about the beginning of service Amazing Grace that's what's gonna see us through it's not hard to live this way if you know that it's just God's grace that's keeping you when it's God's grace keeping you you can start to understand that he's just sheltering you he's keeping you he's preventing you from your own ruin from snakebites Paul was going to Rome he got snake bit shook it off in the fire Amazing Grace I'm going wrong I'm hoping that you can make that connection he was going Rome he got snake bit they even said hey watch him drop dead he's gonna drop dead because he got snake bit his testimony was being tested he said I'm going to Rome and he got snake bit there's a happy land of promise over in the great beyond I'm going somewhere I'm going somewhere real John's you get snake but I guess I do I just shake them off in the fire [Applause] that what he called us to do shake him up in the fire we don't need to sit there beat ourselves up over our mistakes and our faults and our failures because it's not getting us anywhere well all we're doing is worshipping the devil that's all we're doing and the devil wants nothing more than for you to give him praise that's a whole reason he came all the way down and separated himself from God we make mistakes brother sister I'm not saying well there he is that loose living no no I'm saying understand that you're going to get bit but don't acknowledge you get up and you move on you get up and you move on it does nobody any good to sit and sulk over your past over your sins of your faults over your mistakes I'm kind of a simple-minded guy I can I can think on one thing at a time my wife she can multitask with that thing it there but I once I get something in my mind I got a sink on it all the way through I'm going to a place I ain't got time for distractions my mind does not function that way so the more the devil can throw at you the more he could give you the more he could say oh look at you and shame shame you got snake bit how you gonna make it how are you gonna make it you ain't even got the Holy Ghost how are you gonna do it I've seen you do this or that how are you gonna make it how you call yourself the bride you get your mind going in that direction and you'll wrestle with something for months and months and months and all you're doing is delaying Rome you're going to Rome he's been prophesied you're going to Rome I was going to Rome in spite of the snakebite don't roam but our testimony is going to be tested it's going to happen but if we spend so much time being of time we spend so much time soaking in and taking everything that the devil throws at us acknowledging it beating ourselves up over it it's not doing us any good no good young people I've seen it over and over and over again you're young you don't have Abraham's experience yet your experience you just started out in salvation you're getting that yeah that change young Christians you're starting to go through some trials some things and you get snake bit no you wasn't God was doing it in you you were going to Rome don't sit there with that snake shake it off in the fire and move on he wants us to move on we're trying to put this thing on we're trying to get this body change before we can get the body change we've got to get our minds right my man let's turn to this is my probably my favorite scripture let's turn to Isaiah 43 when I get snake bit this is where I go you might have somewhere else but this is where I go but now thus sayeth the Lord that created thee Oh John and he that formed thee Oh John fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art mine now art my colony you're going to Rome Big John you're going to Rome your mind you've got to read your name into it every time I read that scripture I'll make a mental note I'm reading my name in that scripture I created you I called you by your name your mind your mind but God I've just been snakebit your your mind how'd it make so many mistakes your mind you're going to Rome you went up the mountain you're coming down the mountain when now passes through the waters I will be with you and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee without walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kimbo upon thee when you go through the people the waters don't worry about it

try and encourage you but I got to take care of me and you got to take care of you and those you love you parents that have done what the scripture said to do raise them up in the way that they should go when they grow old they will not depart from it did I not just read thus saith the Lord we can't make him bride but we can do everything that we can do and embrace the promise he's not failed he's not come short thus saith the Lord but brother dawn they look so lost thus saith the Lord when you had that child you had Rome in mind you had Rome in mind and you raised them the very best that you could and you embraced Rome and you dedicated them to God thus saith the Lord don't be discouraged say God I've done what I can do I'm embracing your promise I'm embracing thus saith the LORD what else can we do they looked hopeless for me they did if I were to go to my hometown and tell them I was preaching Oh we'd have plenty of attendees hey I got to see this cuz I was a snake handler [Music] yeah a lot of you were to guess what God said you're going to Rome you're going to Rome I don't care how many times you get there I don't care how far down you went I don't care how hopeless

on I'm still going wrong there's no demon out of hell that's going to stop me there is nothing going to take me and divert me away from Rome ask Jonah go ahead ask him Jonah you're going to Nineveh Jesus he did his best to get out of it I don't know how in the world that people are still going around in this message and that cannot see predestination I can't see it I called you by name let's stand I gotta quit [Applause] Isaac was a manifestation of Abraham's testimony they got tested that boat Rome was a manifestation of Paul's testimony and they got tested we have a goal we have a purpose we have a predestinated destination that we are headed to and it don't matter how many shipwrecks we get into it don't matter how many times the snake bites us it don't matter how we look at that mountain and say God how are you going to do this I can't connect the pieces because I've got this flesh in my way I've got this thing in my way that it's Abba setting sin and it seems like it hitting me over and over and over again I make mistake after mistake after mistake how am I going to go up the mountain and back down again my testimony is being tested right now every day you walk wake up it's being tested [Music] we're starting to see the manifestation of our testimony we were not just camping around the message anymore understand what I'm saying I love this message I love what brother Branham got us where he's brought us and it's been God I love it [Music] but when I was a kid it wasn't this it was it was distorted and warped I grew up thinking brother Branham was infallible I did not that anymore [Music] the focus has changed for a while there we were talking so much about how that it's the word this Bible and it is it is absolutely I'm not downplaying that but we've turned another corner [Music] we need this we need the message what's the last piece us it's us if this word could be born in Mary and surely surely it'll be born in you in me we're turning the corner were starting to see Rome is just over the next wave [Music] we've been up the mountain and we're understanding that the RAM is in the thicket he's provided to sacrifice it wasn't so clear before going up the mountain it wasn't so clear where is that sacrifice how are you gonna do this God we're going up to worship and there's no sacrifice I can't see it but God says I will provide for you as sacrifice you are going to Rome [Music] oh yeah I'm gonna read more moisture this is another one of my favorites Philippians [Music] one six being confident of this very thing [Music] that he which hath begun a good work in [Music] John will perform it until we get to Rome this is my word it's being written in me it's for me you take it if you want that's not if to me I want to encourage you take it embrace it but if you don't want it don't criticize me without sure I'm happy this way it's easy to get up in the morning when you know I can shake those snakes off in a fire Lord Jesus
