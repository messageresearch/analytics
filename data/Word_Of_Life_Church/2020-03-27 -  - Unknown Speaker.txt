certainly appreciate God's mercy and His grace I tell brother Darrell just a little while ago I said actually you said you set two records here Sunday morning you preached to the smallest group in

home we're almost all almost home [Music] [Applause] well I'm sure that we all certainly believe that tonight is closer than it's ever been before we can certainly look around and see all the things that are happening in the time that we're living most of us I'm sure did not think that would ever be having Church quite like this you'd be living your life at home if you're not able to go to work and able to go here and there only the Lord knows actually what the future holds but I'm so glad we may not know exactly ever twist and turn in the road well we know who holds our future we're sort of grateful for that we'll read together tonight Psalms 91 it seems to be so fitting for for where we are brother Daryl really ready or rather on Sunday and did such a wonderful job on it and someone had text me and said that they had streamed by the very coffee on Sunday morning and he had read Psalms 91 and then streamed a little bit of brother Tim put them in Louisiana and the Timothy I think maybe had read Psalms 91 so we're gonna read it again tonight so apparently it's it's something that's very fitting for us we know that it's any portion of the Word of God of course it's wonderful and great but we believe that there's a season to God's Word and we're grateful for the brothers has come out to be able to make this available for those of you that are streaming out once and once that brothers are so appreciate you you coming out and we'll do this as long as as long as necessary to be able to get us through this time Psalms 19:1 one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield buckler and verse five thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies that day we're going to pray and we want to remember all these requests that brother Louie had mentioned I'm sure those of you that are streaming tonight you have different things and maybe your your your job situation is uncertain many many things but remember friends even in the time of great trouble our God is mindful of his people he knew this hour would come upon us we certainly did and it caught most of us I'm sure by surprise our nation is caught by surprise as well as the world is but it's not surprising to our Lord so let's just pray together Heavenly Father as we bow our heads or Jesus we're grateful Lord that we would have this opportunity to be able to call upon your name once again thank you for the brothers Lord that have been willing to assemble themselves together here tonight to be able to make the service available for all those that are streaming and Lord how our hearts longed to be able to see one another and it makes us feel very sad Lord we can't see our brothers and sisters and be able to meet here like this but father we just pray that you'd strengthen us and help us and Lord that you'd give us grace to were able to do it again Lord we thank you Father for your grace and mercy to us it extends even in trouble sometimes Lord these prayer requests that brother Louie read we ask that you be mindful of them tonight no doubt hundreds of them that were out across those that are streaming the service and we just pray that you'd be mindful of them Lord there's uncertainty in our country in our world uncertainty in our economy uncertainty in our jobs uncertainty ever will be look what we're so glad there's no uncertainty in our God well pray that should help us tonight in the service help me father to be able to get out of the way pray Lord that you just helped me to surrender myself to you that you can speak through me Lord to your children father we're hungry tonight even though we're not able to gather together so we normally do people sitting around their phones or tablets or computers wherever they are at work or at home and lord they're hungry they've got needs they've got something inside of them Lord so we pray that you just be mindful of us we know this is different for us but we're asking you that you would just compensate for the difference Lord and minister to us would your father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen god bless you you can be seated you brothers thank you all so much I want to speak to you if you're just just a little while tonight on on this simple salt don't fear little sister most of you know the story you know where it comes from so I'll not really go into much detail of the story but it was one of a little girl and her brother and her family being down in in the caverns and the guide turns off the light and little brother sees it and the little girl starts screaming and going into hysterics the Prophet said but the little brother spoke up and said don't fear little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light I believe truly if there's an hour that we need to be conscious of that it is the hour that we're living in we a week or two ago you know whenever we started hearing more and more and more about this virus coming into our nation and affecting more and more people I'm sure that most of us saw oh well maybe it's hype maybe it's this that the other and no doubt a lot of it is high a lot of it is to scare and the fear and to me one of the greatest pandemics is fear itself and not the virus but yet I believe the Lord wants us to be sensible I believe he wants us to do everything we can if you read about the life of Martin Luther during the time of the great plagues is struck in their land while they were living also John Alexander Dowie many great people that have lived down through different time frames that have dealt with different pandemics it's been on the world they did everything they could they prayed they went to church they assembled when they forbid them to assemble they did not assemble but yet they done everything in their power to be able to keep on going with what the church was called to do and I believe that's what the Lord wants us to do as his body now whenever we look at where we are and we think you know what an occasion that it is for the Spirit of God within us to be able to rise to the our true - we all have needs we have needs right here tonight those brothers that are here all of you that are streaming their service no doubt you have needs but we know that our God is not bankrupt just because there's no doubt people now that's per than ain't parading years there's probably a message folks that are that are long in for the day when they can come back to Happy Valley no doubt we'll see a revival of backsliders but you know most of them you know sure how long they last but what I wanted to be is a revival for the real word born-again Christians and we know that sometimes the Lord will actually use tumult and trouble and times like this to be able to stir some of these people so I thank God for it whether you have to pull them out of the fire where they're able to come just by hearing the word and recognize it either ways fine with me but what I like to focus on tonight if the Lord would help us is these wonderful things in the scripture that David had experienced himself now remember David was the chosen of God and he was God's God's elected King but David was a man of many errors and he was a man of grave mistakes and David what we're going to read about tonight had experienced it himself in a very close proximity of his own life when David went to riding as we'll get to it about pestilence and terror and things that would come david had experienced that in his own life you remember who never david numbered the people and Satan moved on David's heart the Bible says and whenever Satan moved on him he moved on him to count the people of Israel now God had already told him don't count them you don't need to know how many they are because how many ever you've got I'm greater than all of that but yet he which was Satan moved upon David and David went out and they began to count the people as soon as he did it then the Spirit of God moved upon his seer and told him because you have done this you've disobeyed me then God gave him a choice of three things so I said I'll choose the mercy of God immediately a plague one out from the presence of the Lord now what's amazing is whenever David is the very man that actually calls this plague to come but when the plague come it never struck David but the Bible tells us 70,000 people of the children of Israel failed in one day now you say what a peculiar saying that God did but now you and I read this in the Bible and we think but that's not even fair it makes no sense all but you see we're reading it from this side of the book no doubt a lot about them seventy thousand people as hard-headed stubborn rebellious and just waiting for a time for the judgment of God to strike them you see god correlates all of his program together and David saw a thousand fault at one hand and ten thousand fall in his other head but it never even come nigh to David's dwelling so when David is going to write about this in Psalms 91 he's not just writing about something that he had not experienced and we all know how that is whenever we experience something I remember many many years ago whenever Carol and I Alicia the little girl four time Erica wasn't even born and we lived in the state of West Virginia and we lived up in a holler and we all think you have the hollers here no hollers like they had there and it was so far back in the hollers that the son never even hit the front porch Harry was there so he never remembers what it was it was so far back up in the sticks that the front porch was never touched by the Sun so you had a little bit of daylight right up here whenever that open window there in the trees but Larry might have been near that place and there was an abandoned coal mine right in front of it would report our car so I've been out in several weeks of services and come back in and the devil attacked my body one night it was a mysterious type of saying just hit me all of a sudden I got deathly sick I couldn't hardly breathe Carol finally helped me get to the bed I never didn't know exactly what it was and we was crying and praying calling on the name of the Lord nobody there didn't have cell phones of course and I told her I said get your Bible get your Bible and I want you to open up to Psalms 91 I don't want you to start reading it to me and her with a quiver in her voice and still crying and still shaking and she started reading what David had to say when she got down to about verse 7 or 8 I said read it again she started reading it again there wasn't just but me and her unless that was there but all of a sudden somebody else entered into that room so whenever I read Psalms 91 it is very personal to me because I have experienced Psalms 19:1 in my own life and I'm sure many of you when you think about it you'll be able to say the same now what I'd like to do is to begin tonight if we could with first one and let's just break it down a little bit if we can he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty now once you notice that in the promises of God that many of God's promises are based upon conditions some of them God gives you certain things it really has nothing relevant to whether you do anything or not but there's other conditions of God promises rather of God that come with conditions and this is one of them and the condition is the very force three is a number of God he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High now notice it's not him that goes in and comes out it's not him that visits on occasion but it is him that dwells look at this word it means to dwell or remain or sit or abide or have one's abode or to marry so this promise that is going to be made to us tonight now I think I've wanted you out there with the scare this in the land and the fear that's in the land I believe we all want this promise to be ours do we not we want to be kept and the time of pestilence we want to be kept in the type of horrific disease and military and we do not know how far this thing is going to go now I understand that some of the brothers around the message are trying to take this time and say the bride is in the tribulation period don't you believe that for one minute the bride is never going into a tribulation period they will never the Lord will take her he will allow trouble to come away and difficulty to come our way but the tribulation has not said Ian we get the rapture we do not get a tribulation period that's exactly right well God let us go through things certainly well but we are not in a tribulation period now David said he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High so it's not every man then that actually dwells in the secret place and in reality it's not even every Christian now we've been through that enough to know that those that are called Christians are those that are saved but we're not just talking about being saved we're talking about heaven the token and being filled with the Holy Ghost so he that dwelleth in the secret place so he comes to God's house but he does not come and leave now unlike whenever the service is over here tonight the ten brothers of us or whatever it is it's here we will depart we'll say goodbye and we'll see you again Lord willing on Sunday and we will leave this house and we'll say well we'll see you again in the way for all of us to be gathered together but in reality those of us that are filled with the Holy Ghost never leave God's house because God's house is the mystical body of Jesus Christ and once you're baptized Ian you're there forever so David said he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High don't you notice that he dwells in the father's house so there's some who worship in the outer court and there's some who come in to the second realm but this doesn't apply to them actually it's those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High he dwells and lives in the Holy of Holies so he lives where under the shadows of the cherubim over the mercy seat now remember this is where that it is going to apply this light of the word so he is not a stranger in the house of God this man this woman this boy this girl of Psalms 19:1 one it's not a guest in the house of God they are at home praise God they are not a guest in the house of God and we know how that is people come to our house and they're a guests and then many folks come here to this place of worship and they come and visit they'll never come back again they will be my goodness what kind of church is that and they come one time and never come back again some come a dozen times half a dozen time but this is not who we're talking about we're talking about those that go into the mystical body though they're baptized by the Holy Ghost and when they get there they are home they are no longer a visitor they are at home notice he said he that dwelleth in the secret place so what place would this severe well in the time of David wrote this David of course being a middle-eastern King himself and David would have practiced this was the people in his kingdom he would have practiced this with the emissaries of other kingdoms with those who would have come from different places and only those that David would have hand-picked would have been allowed to enter into the holy of Holy's or as it were as the inner sanctum of the palace now even David's 500 wives could not come at will and go into that secret place this was where the king himself went to get away from all the issues of the kingdom and they knew it was an unwritten law no one went there unless you were bidden by the king so David himself practiced this secret place and no doubt it must have dropped down in his heart that he realized God has this place God has a place like this whenever he was in there maybe David was dealing with administrative problems with this and there was a drought over there the waters running dry over here and there they're having problems over there David said I've just got to get away from it all and he went into its place and said nobody nobody bother me everybody leave me alone hit walk inside there and the curtain mud got behind him and there it was all my just for the peace just for a little bit of joy for a little while no worries no problem so it would only last for a moment but it was something that he needed must have struck his heart maybe a brother down walking in that one day after dealing with such situation and if the piece just covered over him and if the revelation struck his heart God has a place at this well David did not know the Holy Ghost David didn't understand the baptism of the Holy Ghost all David knew was that there was a place there a tabernacle a crude place that he felt that he wanted to be there and he got his clothes has said the law would allow him to go but he knew he could never enter behind that veil but he said oh I want to I want to get behind there our shadows of priest I was out to kill the undead well I wish I could be there to be in the presence of God and he said all there's got to be a place there's got to be a place that a man can go that God calls him his secret place notices it is God's pavilion and words he hides his friends from harm those that dwell in this secret place now brother Daryl read this also on Sunday but I'd like to read it again Psalms twenty-seven and five I want you to notice now what's the links of this and who does what in the time of trouble he shall hide me now once you notice now who's doing this it's not us hiding ourselves it is not us seeking God and we were supposed to do our part now but if this is not us doing this it is God doing this I'm that Psalms 27 is what a background for the rapture the more I see the timer in the more I realize how perfect this Psalm really is and it begins out with trouble it begins out in verse 2 talking about difficulty we'll look at it later but you go right on down it's one verse after another after another trouble being everywhere well the Lord keep us brothers will he keep us you folks that are streaming a man he'll keep us notices in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he high me notice again it's not as adding ourselves it's not us running scared it's an old god oh god what are we going to do I don't know what we're gonna do we're gonna be calm we're gonna trust him we're gonna wash our hands we're gonna do what we can do and we're gonna claim his promises that's right for it's not up to me to hide myself I can wash my hands he won't do that but it's not up to me to hide myself it's up to him it's up to me to believe that he will and claim his promise he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall say me notice the three phases first pole second pole third pole all three of them saying the same thing as far as the power of the one who's doing the work it's the Almighty all we're doing is surrendering he will hide me in his pavilion he will have set me oh ma he was in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me on a rock and what is Iraq on the Bible a revelation he will set me on our revelation now we know the majority of the world they don't have a clue what the outcome of all this is as far as the numbers of the dead and so on neither do we but we know this if trouble comes our way our God will be with us am i saying every Christian will be descent from this thing that's coming I am NOT because we are human beings but I know this there is a difference and disciplinary action of a plague that comes from God upon the wicked and it is of a son or daughter of God who experiences the same thing because children of God are not getting it for disciplinary action but they will get it with a blessing they're coming out of it there will be a better person than what they was when they entered into it now the world does not have that promise but we do as is believed in children notice he said in the secret of his tabernacle chali hide me he shall set me upon a rock some thirty one twenty now shall hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of men thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues is there a Amen so that hear your life of worship it's actually what makes the obedient life that is put on display before the people now notice this the hidden life of worship and communion with God it's what makes possible the walk of faith that we live every day of our life notice not verse tune some snotty one I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him Oh hallelujah and I'll tell Fred it ain't good enough that he's your mama's gone ain't good enough he said daddy's God he ain't good enough he's your pastors God and I were living you need to know it's you're gone that's right I will say of the Lord I trust every one of us can say this tonight I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence to Pels mentioned here the snare of the Fowler and the noise and pestles of course both of these indicates a different type of Perak now remember David was a hunter and many of us are not even familiar ready with a sniper tower but it was a metaphor for evil plots or things that would come against us I mean know that the Fowler actually depending on what what type of bird that he was gonna hunt that he would study the bird itself and he would adapt the trap according to the nature of the bird now he is looking for a coil you would not go up in an eagle's nest and be able to lay the snare up there because the quail is not going to be there and it would be the same way if you're looking for a partridge looking for a grouse whatever more you would study the nature of that bird and then you would lay your snare according to that nature now we all can say Amen to this that the devil knows every one of our weaknesses he knows our nature's and he lays the snare for us according to our weakness for some people it may be you know one thing for others it'll be something different but the devil knows every one of us some folks call all the pieces one a time like this comes up and they just they just go to pieces and they shake and tremble and their faith just falls away and to them that's a great thing they're so kind of all praise God we're gonna go through it now remember they've got their weakness somewhere we all do and the devil will lay his trash according to your wings you see every child is custom-fit according to the nature of the one that is being tempted and he can tweak it and I'll trade just a little bit but David said no matter what he does the Spirit of God will help me and God will deliver me and the trap we know exactly what a foul would do that he would study the heart he would study the habit he will SETI the habitat he would study the die to what they would look for and certain ones would go underneath branches and they pick up little seeds and then pick up this and that in the other so guess where he's gonna put his snare he's gonna put it right where they feed right where they water well if they're scared of that area over there he's not gonna put it over there he will stay away from that area and he will lay the snare where they are comfortable with the things where they feel like well I'm okay I'm okay this is good this is my space I'm good and he will watch him and say oh okay right there's what we want to lay the snare but you know what the Spirit of God will help us even in our weaknesses aren't you glad now notice he says that God would be those that would come to those that would deliver them he said he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence you know the human race since the fall of Adam in the beginning has never been exempt from disease and turmoil and all kinds of things I'm not sure a few things with him - not historically a pestilence is recorded as raging and Babylonia in AD 40 in Italy and 80-66 and basta these took place before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD now if you look at the sequence of many of these events down through time we know that God uses actually will allow will allow Satan to move in the with plagues with diseases and even war and he will use them as a judgment but remember we're children if we're filled with the Holy Ghost God ain't want to turn that devil loose on us a man now what's this this one that struck in Babylon and 40 ad and the other one in 66 AD in Italy and then both of them full ran the destruction of Jerusalem and when you look at where we are in you think of this one and that one one plague has crippled the world one play has brought economic disaster to the world can you imagine want to be in the tribulation when there's one after another after another after another I knew already I didn't want to be here during the Tribulation Period I'm more that convinced now can you imagine what it's going to be like well today I'm so glad there's been a way made Jesus said pray you that for all ways that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the Son of Man that is my prayer so a pestilence is a deadly disaster usually a disease which will be perpetuated through an entire community or it can be an island or a country it can be a contagion that is passed one to the other notice is the black deaths the bubonic plague of the 14th century wiped out the majority of the population of Europe resulting in the deaths of an estimated between 75 to 200 million people and who was on the earths at this time Martin no sir swingley and there you know what they had to deal with they had to deal with some of their people suffering so Luther said he would go through and fumigate the air and still pray and claim the promises of God while they were humans they're not exempt from sickness and difficulty and heartache and trouble can your bags in 75 to 200 million of course they didn't have the dad and all that that we keep up with today one-fourth of the population of the civilized world perished and Europe alone reaching 25 million 25 million OMA the great pestilence of 1918 the Spanish flu what's wiped out people in the United States more than a nation loss in World War one it infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide about 1/3 of the planets population and killed an estimated 20 million to 75 million victims including some 675 thousand Americans so it's our God greater he is yes it's our Holy Ghost greater then play then disease then the black deaths and whatever death absolutely right so what do we do in such times we claim the promise of God we do every thing we can do I do not believe face is foolish I believe faith is based upon the word I believe faith helps us to be able to guide us through such trouble sometimes I mean though many people think they have faith when they're absolutely foolish and wrap us with it Amen that's exactly right any of them will lose a life foolishly because of their perception of faiths but faiths never will lead you contrary to the Word of God if God leads you on a leprosy camp go right ahead God will take care of you if he leaves you there but if you go because of human selfishness and pride to prove what you are you better count your fingers and toes because you may lose them before you get back because you're going out of pride not by faith people will say during this time all bless God I'm going to church I'm proven my faithful first of all you're not cooperating with whatever our government is asked us to do you're also risking your own testimony before people because they can't go here and there and there and you're acting like you're better than they are and you're going to prove yourself you're proven that you're ignorant well amen should have made that amen tape a long time ago first service that will get everybody back we're going to have any men making tape amen now notice this if where we are in this age will we have millions of deaths I don't know that I'm not saying that we will I don't have a clue no more than any of you know but all I know is that God in the past has allowed such things to come upon the earth our eyes most of us are we praying more now when we pray over our food are we more sincere than just a habit are we mentioning things with sincerity I know it's sad for us too but we might as well just go ahead and admit to it and shake our heads and it's the truth because there's something about trouble that stirs us up there's something about it that shakes us it's a shame that God has to use such things but God knows how the human being is now what you notice this in the message the seven churches brother BAM said when the first world war that six trumpets sounded according Zach according to the time God's poker that exactly geographically fallen the seal before that and when the mystery was revealed in there for the baptism of the Holy Ghost how the church did not move up what's how he like insists that the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the church did not move uh and those who were moving refused to walk in the light and went back and the plague was opened at that time and pulled out upon the earth which was influenza influenza that killed all the people as it did the thousands times thousand now what he's referring to is the Spanish flu that we just read 20 to 75 million people and you mean God a loving wonderful faithful merciful God allowed that to happen why brother there are people refused the baptism of the holy ghost and some of those that had walked toward it started walking back and what did God do God allowed this now remember God does not create sickness God is not the ulcer of sickness the Prophet says that over and over again God is not the author of sickness he's not the author of disease but God will allow or our enemy I hope every one of you understand that Satan right now this is his type of day he's having a heyday he loves time cycler and can you imagine down in hell they are just they are having as we call it a revival the demons are frolicking they are so happy they love it when human beings are under fear they love it when human beings are under trauma and stress I read yesterday where a doctor here in our nation said he was more afraid of suicide and depression and all of that that's going to affect American people then he was the virus itself he believes that numbers of suicides will soar because it was so interrupt our way of life God made those social creatures that's alright we're not made just to hibernate by ourselves and there's something about it we love to get together as people but can you imagine them Dimas what kind of a dear demon would love to see people so stressed out but Satan loves this type of an opportunity but I've got news for that devil he may take a lot of people no doubt it'll affect our economy it'll throw it still place it will never occur break neither with the rest of the world but you know what I believe a bribe will come out on the other side we're going to be better people after this I believe we'll be closer to God I believe we'll be closer together I believe we'll appreciate our church like never before I believe we'll appreciate one another like never before I believe we'll appreciate life just being able to go to Walmart not be worried just they'll go stop at a restaurant and get a hamburger come on preacher and I believe that we'll be able to appreciate just the things of a lot more we take so much for granted Oh notice this from the New Testament we learn that God does not keep his people from all sickness and trouble we know that he does not even keep us from the valley of death but he keeps us from the valley of the shadow of death he does not keep us from death but he keeps us through this he does not keep us from dying but when we're going through death to us it's just a simple crossing over we're taking the taxi as it was it takes us on the other side it's only a few moments in any work time you get in sit down time to get out so you aren't even know that you've been there now to those that are going that are not ready of course it's a different time but remember the Lord Jesus and talking and referring to in the Book of Luke when he talked about those that would be killed and so on for his namesake and they would go through a great persecution and then Jesus says these words accompany along with that but not one hair of your head shall perish and he was talking about people that would lose their life for his calls it shows he looks at it in such a different way than we do we look on side oh no oh no if I succumb to this or that of the other I'm a loser people say oh he lost the cancer don't you say that about a child of God a child of God is a winner either way oh you say they never got their healing they did get their healing they got their healing from mortality that's exactly right sometimes we pray God will heal people of cancer and God said I want them to experience the real miraculous power of supernatural divine healing from another dimension hey man if we are the children of God when we goso everything as I said it's not punitive that God is punishing us it's not that God's trying to get even with us but as we looked at job that God has a lesson and the people of God will come through this with a lesson I believe there are people that will come out of this with great gold in our character meetings have had been cancelled all over the world all types of things have been shook up our world shook up us around us and sometimes as I said we get lazy and we need to be shook up but I believe we're gonna be shook up who knows this might be the life shaken before the change oh praise God notice in verse 4 that David said he shall cover thee with his feathers brother Daryl covered that so beautifully I'm not even gonna go the direction that he did because there's no need to it he just covered it so wonderfully he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler but I wonder if you felt of this verse of this way if this would have not been said by man inspired by the Holy Ghost it would almost be blasphemous that any mortal man would liken the almighty eternal elohim to a bird but god inspired david to liken him to a bird what do I see in this verse the condensation of the infinite Jehovah that he would allow my such transcendent condescension that he would allow himself to be likened to a bird that God would liken himself to an eagle or to a in the book of Matthew that when the Lord Jesus come on the air and he said o Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I gathered you together as a Hindu gather her brood even there he likens himself to a mother hen can you imagine the eternal condescended don't you see how much he loves us why would he say such a thing he didn't need to say it for himself he said it for us that we would be able to understand oh my that he would come down so low he would go beyond just the likeness of a man he'd gone to animal nature and say I'm like an eagle I'm like a here I'm like this Wow so you'd be able to grab ahold of it all praise God when I said right there son did her brother down preaching about that eagle and her watching her little babies down there I just see myself put my face on that Eagles head and I grabbed ahold of that eagle hallelujah I climbed mad to my own science was rot down on that feather than you why because to me that's the way Papa wants it to be I put my face right on that little eagle whenever that storm come I felt myself from the wind hit me right in the face but I wasn't afraid because I was a hold of Jehovah's way and I'll tell you I'm going to face this pandemic I'm gonna face it the way I faced everything else with my eye right on the promise of the Word of God I'll be going into the storm we're gonna run from it nobody ain't running we'll go right into it as the Spirit of God the leaders but we're not doing it and our pride in our arrogance and our might we are doing it in the power of the Lord how will we come through this with dots a thorn or how will we overcome it with touch saith the Lord how will we be hallelujah that God how will we all be on the other side we'll still does say it the Lord will go into it but saith the Lord in the middle we'll have thus saith the Lord on the other side we are God's attributes his spoken word children hallelujah well I was gonna say forgave me but angles say that I'm getting excited praise the Lord said he gathers chickens I would have gathered you notice your Luke 13 he said o Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hand as a hand just gather her brood under her wings David said he'll cover thee with his feathers under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield the shield and buckler protected the body's vital parts from the weapons of thrusts that were thrown at you from the enemy let the devil throw sickness at him throw disease that him throw depression let him throw whatever he wants to throw we are more than honkers before the dawn and we never been here before I totally agree with that but our Lord Jesus has been here before what about the saints of God that lived through the bubonic plague did he help him did he keep him by his grace certainly did and there was millions dying all over the earth the people of God but right there in the middle of it was her people have gone the Spanish flu of course there were weather people of God and the plagues in different times there were 2000 fallen on the left ten thousand on the right but David said Rother I stood in the middle of it and somehow the grace of God spared my life looking at it you think he was the very man that should have died that God said not so not so no one in riverdale he can wrap this with such inspiration your imagine standing down in the middle of it feeling your the very calls and people dying everywhere around you and he went out thirdly saw the angel of God and he said something for me something into the presence of God stopped the plague I believe we are to pray like never before for God's mercy I'm sure you are but I'm praying every day that God will help doctors biochemists and whoever more to be able to bring relief to the human race because the prophet of God did exactly the same thing when he was here notice this in verse 5 thou shalt not a man thou shalt not be afraid for the terror but 9 now we know there's something about night isn't it amazing that if a thunderstorm comes in the day there's there could be an element of fear but if that same thunderstorm would come of the same amount of wind same amount of lightning and the same amount of thunder why is it it seems more scary in the nighttime because of something about us as human beings and the night everything becomes different the night or even different I've been in the African bush honey and the night sounds in Africa they're just they're incredible they're awesome in one way and yet they're fearful I'm sitting in a place in Sim probably there whenever I was hunting one time and the guy told me said now you say over here but yourself was a block type of thing around top of little room maybe size some office or something like that and he said now don't get scared he said we see leopards around here and he said we see you know some different things but they only come out at night and he said oh I forgot to tell you don't have a lock on your door oh ok don't have a lock on the door so I finally did go to sleep and I woke up in the night but something like this well my heart's got as big as saucers now if I've heard that same noise in the daylight it wouldn't bother me near as much but there's something about darkness and David said I want to frame the night I'm gonna frame the night and I'm gonna catch the fears I'm gonna catch the Majan Asians I'm gonna catch the you know the unknown that's what's getting everybody right now it's the unknown it's the unknown where is it going oh how bad will it be here how bad will it be there will it get me will it get my momma will they get this it's the unknown and David said I'm gonna catch the unknown at the worst time in the nighttime and I'm gonna go ahead and lay it out by the inspiration of the Spirit of God and he said thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by the day so firestorms tempest enemies you imagine an enemy a bunch of men coming at you at the night time and they would lie in wait many times at night and they would attack at night you can't see them you don't know who's on your side who's against you and David must have been there he must have been there I felt I know what that's like I know what it's like when you're looking out there you're sinking who's on my side who's for me who's against me I can't see him I don't know what to do do I throw a rock or throw a javelin do I shoot an arrow do I wait do I leave I don't know what to do and David said I felt that feeling before I know that feeling I'm sure every one of us have felt the same way when the darkness oh man when we can't see they live around us and we wonder where he is but remember he's still in the ship sometimes you may not be able to feel him and you may go quiet on your buddy stealing it for a reason Oh hallelujah man nor for the arrow that fast bad the day brother shot from the bow of God or shot from the bow of the devil or shot from the bow of man oh you realize there's three different aspects about what's the bulk and come against you God in His mercy because of his love I'm ready just yesterday when brother Graham said that God sometimes well let a sickness come on an individual and he said just in order to draw him a little bit closer to it so he can kind of pull itto you up in his arms and were thinking that he don't like us we're thinking that he's rejected us and he spanking us but in reality many times it ain't that way at all he's actually pulling us a little bit closer because we'll we'll get real closer time and we'll snuggle up to him and he pulls us real close and goes to minister some real close intimate fellowship so sometimes God pulls a hair out of his bowl I'm gonna allow things to come our way other times he'll allow Satan to do it other times it'll be men and I'll shoot their hours of discontentment or their hours of gossip or arrows of this or that but David said it makes no difference who it comes from if it fires my day nobody comes from by God's grace I am going to live oh I love this in verse 6 nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness oh my shrouded in mystery never remember they did not have biochemist they did not have laboratories microscopes when David wrote this yet they had plagues they had all kinds of things that deal with and it's mysterious to us now the coronavirus and all the other things that we do with it's mysterious and they're looking thank god they are looking I hope and pray God will let them find something but can you imagine how mysterious it must have been in this timeframe whenever things were coming they didn't know what to do and many of them it was the water that was causing it it was this and that and the other and they didn't know what to do it was veiled in mystery oh my but David said for the pestilence that walketh in darkness it stays hidden I don't know what to do listen is not our own president and his cabinet and many of the doctors saying that we are in a war a president is identifying himself as being a wartime president and you know doctors are saying we're in a war now we understand that actually a little bit better than what they did because we know what this is is a fourth dimension a fourth dimension visitation that has come from the demonic world and pressed its way now some they say started with some type of exotic plant or a brother now they're saying possibly in the wet markets of China which I've been there and seeing all that and they're saying now maybe possibly that it was about that someone they Batson in China and that actually they'd went to a wet market and it's someone that had made him sick and it come from that one person and we say how Satan does it time that exactly for the Chinese New Year them going out to visit and so if the Chinese fault they didn't bring this upon us intentionally many of those people have suffered greatly we don't bind them but yeah they were Satan time that exactly right so that them going out to visit here and there and down many Chinese live in Italy what did they do they want a broad brought it right back into their homeland and they're doing the same thing over and over again many international travelers what did he do at the end of World War one when the Spanish flu hit what was at the time that some of the boys was coming back home going here and now exactly how that it was time our enemy knows exactly what he is doing but so do we we are not ignorant concerning his chops and his devices and we are not ignorant that our God will move on our behalf he said I am Not Afraid even at the destruction that will waste at noonday if it comes in the night so big that comes in the noonday so being my God is grief all my God is greater than all of it verse seven a thousand a thousand shall fall at thy side which is your left there and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not it shall not come nigh ha see this is not talking about the battle this is talking about the pestilence that he just described in the verse before now this is a man without the Holy Ghost I wonder how close it could get to us and now shake our faith now whenever we read it on our apps and we read our news and see the little news clips on our phones and so on and we see their numbers most of them are faceless people they are stats to us no lifes name no first name no middle name the skin color we know nothing about them they're just a number but what if it was your neighborhood what if you sure community what if it's people in our church people in our message this is why I think we have to be careful and taking the quote when brother bem said they'll be plagues gone in the life station it'll fall on everybody without the Holy Ghost we've got to be careful and make sure that whenever we apply this if we know what we're doing because if somebody in the message gets this then what does that make us doing makes them putting the move without the Holy Ghost now whether or not this is that plague I do not know that plague will come because he said it will be here right notice it was so close that David comparing these numbers a thousand to my left 10,000 you're chose the devastation by the Lord that was made by such a plane and remember David experiences 70,000 of his own people dying right around him but God in His mercy spared him no wonder this man could write this with such conviction your Mattson hearing and seeing people screaming out of your own city and you yourself are the very cause of why this happened and God's grace God's providential good oh you say I'm not worthy you saying David was worthy you saying David had done any good thing he was the very man that had caused it it was a picture of God's grace so I understand it all I don't but I know one thing he is merciful and that's one thing I was sure appreciate about it the special Providence of God he said it will not come nigh thee but you will be safe you'll feel protected oh I believe that there's ever a time that we need to not do that just physically but we need to know that we know that we know that our soul is sealed with the Holy Ghost now I know I mentioned to you they were going to have a prayer line Lord will and we're going to do that cuz I felt led to do so whenever we come back we'll have it now remember the prayer line it's not just gonna be for the sick bodies the prayer line will be for those who need to be saved the prayer line will be there for those who need strength and the wall it'll also be for those who need the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a matter of fact the Prophet tells us the Apostolic way of receiving the Holy Ghost is to have hands laid upon you I can't never see where that was ever changed no this is all about mother darling well what if what if someone our church gets it what what if what if you get it what if somebody gets it oh well ma does that mean you don't have the Holy Ghost they don't mean there's such thing around does that mean God didn't watch over you no no what if some unbeliever dies with it God did watch over him no that doesn't mean that many of God's children died was diseases all kinds of different things but we get something different out of it than what the normal Joey here gets from he does his family gathers around him and all he was a good old guy done this and that and the other all but you see we have promises aren't these now thing happens by chance it all happens for some reason the grace of God is right again he says I don't believe that anything happens to a Christian by chance I think it's ordained of God because jesus said he would make all things work together for good to them that love him praise God so what am I gonna do wash our hands and keep on believing I will do everything that's in my power I said you that Sunday board it I trust God but also lock my doors and I leave the house it's not that I don't trust God it's so many people in the community where I live I don't trust so you know what I trust God I have insurance I trust God have insurance on the car right I trust God with all different kinds of things and there's things that I do to be able to perpetuate in my life as long as I'm here I'm going to enter this and I have entered it exactly in the same way am I gonna watch am I gonna stay keep my social distance well I'm gonna do my best to be able to do that and if anybody sneezes I'm dropping everything I'm gone and I'm out of the store yeah whatever you gotta do to protect yourself now I realize there are people that look at that and they struggle well that's not my problem that they don't understand real faith you see the prophet of God himself when he was going overseas he said my arm is sore this morning because of shots that I had to take the yellow fever son and I the government requires it though brother Branham never told us oh yeah this is a persecution against the church this is not a persecution against the church the last time I checked the NBA was not a religious organization the Masters being canceled down in Georgia is not a church persecution now friend don't being doming nuts no don't don't done this don't be foolish during this time this is not a persecution against the church if this is a persecution against the church I'd be one of the first ones to say we're not doing it we're gonna come here anyhow this is not a persecution against the church people can't work people can't go here they can't go there oh but what if it comes out of it well if it comes out of it we'll deal with it then but that ain't what it is now and whenever we try to represent it that way when you're doing something falsely and telling a lot we need to tell the truth oh I'll see some beyond it brother Donnie you better make sure what you see it's based upon the word and if you're in a profit you don't know a bit more about it than I do so let's just follow what God said and this just behave ourselves in the line of duty and the brother says amen notice this again thanks there to be you were all pre-planned by God nothing that happens by chance was God he knows all about it's all pre plan praying for many generations a man back so that you could be here tonight now here we are and God knew this Wednesday night that be one two three four five six seven eight nine ten that I can see in this place which normally there's hundreds and hundreds and you know we are we're still in shock why we didn't know the plan we're still trying to figure it all out oh my goodness how long is this going to go I don't know if I could jump up here and read the plan to come back down and tell you but since I don't know what the plan is we'll just have to play it out Bay but day by day but I do not believe that this is how passive God said oh no I can't keep my children this coronavirus it's awful it's hard for this bigger God can stand that ain't my god I said that ain't my god my God's bigger never devil a lot of hell he's bigger than ever disease shame he's bigger than all of it put together a notice in verse eight only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward notices when God allows a plague to come upon the earth which is his righteous judgment it is reward to the wicked but when his children get sick it is not a reward for wickedness it's not punitive at all it's educational now we don't like going to that school but we all got to go I know we want to be tardy on them hard trial days and on them hard test days but we've all got to have them because I've seen in myself many many times when people get sick and maybe the last six months six weeks two months of the life and see little things that needed to be tweaked see this may dried and watch them and they call this brethren maybe that sister and just fix little things here and little things and them setting in church every time you have Church and somehow another they never did it they never fix it or no that never struck home but all of a sudden they're laying on their deathbed and this little saying I've had many of them to call me by the bedside another wife or the husband to go out the room brother Donny I need to make this right I said this about you I've done this I should have done that sure brother sister I understand and maybe live an hour maybe live 30 minutes maybe live you know however long from that time but it takes sometimes things like that what do we do we know we're facing it and we search every avenue of our life we search every room of our life we search every motive look a brother's whenever we think about it all you streamers tonight what's the most important to you tonight your money or your freedom and food and toilet paper and bottled water and things now who'd ever thought tolet paper would have such value why because people are scared to this whoever solved that should walk to Kroger Food City and the shelves would be empty our America don't you see what this is done I'm great scientists our great nation that's so full of pride she's humbled once again we can't control it Kenneth come on America you think you did or will Roz will be greater that's who America is but remember one of these days she'll meet her doom I'm so glad God has made a way for us don't you appreciate it so much notice what David said you'll receive and closure momentarily only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high the annotation or thou praise you have made the Lord your home you're in father's house praise God this is why the Prophet said that the blood was applied over the door for the lair because the name was on the door so when you'd come in not like Irish today on a mailbox outside but they would write the name on the door on the doorpost either hear the lentil going across the top and they'd write the name so when he said apply the blood when they applied the blood they applied the blood to the name or the entrance and he said the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ the body of God were baptized into that body and the blood is applied to the name what is the name not Reagan not Bayley not blevens it is the name of Jesus Christ and there we are safe but return does that mean we won't have trouble no no no no it doesn't mean that we're free from trouble but it means in our trouble we are safe in our trouble the world is not say don't you understand there's such a difference even what was also less trouble and we have trouble to say sure we but they are in turmoil in their trouble they are lost in their trouble can you imagine the world it's never not in our lifetime is it ever felt this lost and then America many people the world are so proud they can't stand it when they lose control and they're out of control they can't control the money market they cannot control the stocks the bonds they can't control their health they're out of control but I have rest you know you could have rest in that not because I've got control but because my daddy helps control I'm in my father's house the blood is not a tape oh my the token is not a tape of some of the unbelievers around the message I'd like to make it the blood of Jesus Christ the life that was in that boy is our token the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what keeps us safe so if I go through trials I'll come out on the other side of that trial I'm more blessed man than I was before I went to here if I go through hardships I'll come out on the other side my faith stronger let's stand brothers god bless you and we read verse 10 while you stand there there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come not not dwelling a security in the midst of Evil's a peace in the midst of storm safety amidst desolation these are our promises we claim them oh brother done what if we get sick what kind of anyway we climb them right on through it because he will be with us and our sickness and our trouble and our disparity of life he will help us through this time that B Valley all of your brothers and sisters I know your hearts are broken I left my little clean at home a while ago so sad and just feeling so despondent many of you I'm sure you feel the same way tonight some of the brothers are going to be able to meet with ten people in their sanctuary and maybe ten oh when the fellowship hall and you know be able to manage it that way because they have a small congregation time we get that done this thing will be done past anyway so I figure we just go through it as best we can and it'll make a stronger when we come out on the other side y'all won't y'all just be chomping at the bits for the next time we're able to come and you set here in the house of God here all brother Lewis saying here these musicians play and make their normal regular mistakes and you know the old clap off beat some of you singing off-key it'll sound

know is your promises apply either way if you allowed Satan to release this as a temporary judgment upon the earth prior to the going a home of your people then you'll keep us Alleluia if you turn loose the vials and the judgments the bowls of the judgments of God temporarily pre-tribulation you'll still keep us so either way we're going to be camped praise God Lord as I said it doesn't mean that we'll be free from sickness and free from death just our sister chevy just passing a few days ago no doubt Lord if you tear there be more of us sort of go that way but we're still kept in death
