[18:25] [Music]
[18:29] Lord so glad that he is that
[18:32] reality praise the
[18:35] lord we certainly welcome each of you
[18:37] that are here tonight thankful for the
[18:40] opportunity once again we can be able to
[18:43] meet together like this
[18:45] and try to um answer some of these
[18:49] questions it's on people's
[18:53] hearts today I had the order of this the
[18:57] way that I thought I was going to go but
[19:00] as I sat later this afternoon praying
[19:04] and I just felt to kind of change it
[19:08] around a bit so first
[19:11] question can you
[19:14] explain why brother brandham is a
[19:17] Vindicated
[19:18] prophet and why the message is
[19:22] correct I have a difficult time speaking
[19:26] to why I believe
[19:29] what I
[19:31] believe maybe to a lot of people that
[19:34] question wouldn't have much relevance
[19:37] but to us as message
[19:40] followers it is such an important
[19:43] question and naturally as being able to
[19:45] understand it now you may not be able to
[19:47] explain it like a preacher would be able
[19:49] to but yet God certainly wants each of
[19:52] us to have an understanding and me' like
[19:55] to have a need on your heart before we
[19:57] pray God bless each of you
[20:00] heavenly father as we approach these
[20:03] questions here tonight Lord Jesus I'm
[20:05] asking you that you would help me Father
[20:08] help me to be able to get out of the way
[20:10] Lord once again that you can speak
[20:12] through me help me Lord as Paul said
[20:16] that I might be a an oracle of God
[20:20] that's an awesome responsibility placed
[20:23] on any human being but I pray tonight
[20:26] that you would help me Jesus shut my
[20:29] mouth to anything that would displease
[20:31] you make me sensitive tonight father if
[20:34] there's a need of a young person here or
[20:36] someone else even streaming and they
[20:39] need to hear something said make me
[20:42] sensitive to the spirit of God and help
[20:44] me Lord we're so grateful and
[20:47] appreciative of these Services these
[20:49] question answers I've heard from people
[20:52] around the world how that many of these
[20:54] people have had questions for years and
[20:56] years and it would be a question and a
[20:59] young person here would ask about it and
[21:01] there'd be multitudes of people that
[21:03] would get an answer that they have
[21:05] pondered over them so we see your hand
[21:09] in it so once again would you come and
[21:12] help us tonight father in Jesus name we
[21:15] pray amen God bless you each of you
[21:18] thank you for your attendance
[21:21] tonight you can be
[21:24] seated so can you explain why brother
[21:27] brandham is a Vindicated prophet and
[21:29] while the message is correct I have a
[21:31] difficult time speaking to why I believe
[21:36] what I believe and before we would
[21:41] actually deal with brother brandom
[21:43] instead of talking about brother brandom
[21:46] and going backwards what I'd like to do
[21:49] is to go backwards first so why is it
[21:53] that we even believe in a prophet
[21:59] why is it that we believe that we had to
[22:03] have a message in the last day what was
[22:07] the relevance what was the importance uh
[22:10] we've had the Bible now for many many
[22:13] years King James version 1611 we've had
[22:16] many versions thereafter so why would we
[22:20] need a prophet to come with what is
[22:23] called a message what does that mean
[22:26] exactly isn't Jesus dying on on the
[22:28] cross isn't that the message of the
[22:31] gospel and uh going to church and being
[22:34] a good church member isn't that enough
[22:37] to put people in the Rapture is that not
[22:39] enough to be able to give us a body
[22:42] chain so what we'd like to do is take a
[22:45] u a journey back to the scripture
[22:48] tonight now all the scriptures will be
[22:50] here on the on the screen and I've got a
[22:52] bunch to look at so I'll try not to go
[22:55] too fast but we will also have these on
[22:58] the website where you can go back and
[22:59] look at them but let's begin in numbers
[23:03] 12: 6 now remember God's nature if we
[23:06] can ever find the way God is then he
[23:09] cannot change in principle you and I
[23:11] change all the time and the way we view
[23:13] things and the way we see things it's
[23:15] because we learn more and we learn a
[23:17] better way to do something but God of
[23:20] course cannot do that numbers 12 and he
[23:24] said hear now my words if there be a
[23:27] prophet among among you I the Lord will
[23:31] make myself known to him in a vision and
[23:36] will speak to him in a dream now this is
[23:39] God himself giving us at least two in
[23:43] this verse of scripture of the
[23:45] identifications of what a true Prophet
[23:48] will be that God will deal with this man
[23:51] in the form of vision and will speak
[23:55] unto him in a dream now our dream dreams
[23:59] um conclusive only to prophets no of
[24:01] course we all have dreams but the
[24:03] difference is that we don't have the
[24:06] ability to be able to interpret that
[24:08] dream now many people in the message try
[24:10] to take that on themsel and they say
[24:12] well brother so and so had a dream and I
[24:14] I think it meant this and I think it
[24:16] meant that but yet we know in the Bible
[24:19] that the only one that had the ability
[24:20] to be able to interpret a dream was a
[24:22] prophet the very reason that he did was
[24:25] because God showed him the dream in the
[24:28] form of a vision that's the way
[24:30] Nebuchadnezzar's dream was interpreted
[24:32] so the susers of the different people
[24:35] were around him and they could not they
[24:36] just couldn't do it they just could not
[24:38] do it so God showed the prophet the
[24:42] dream and a vision so he stands right
[24:45] before the king and said you saw this
[24:47] and this and this and this he said
[24:48] that's exactly right how did you know
[24:50] that how did you know that's what I
[24:52] dreamed so this is one of the things
[24:54] that God says also Deuteronomy 13:1
[24:58] if there arise among you a prophet or a
[25:02] dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign
[25:06] or a Wonder Now watch how God moves in
[25:10] another stage now of a prophet so and
[25:13] numbers it was a vision or a dream but
[25:16] now he's fixing to give us a significant
[25:19] difference of how we'll be able to tell
[25:20] a false prophet from a true one if there
[25:23] arise among you a prophet or a dreamer
[25:25] of dreams and giveth thee a sign or or a
[25:28] Wonder so now a man's not only seeing
[25:31] visions and Dreaming Dreams but he also
[25:33] has a touch of the supernal and the sign
[25:37] or the Wonder come to pass whereof he
[25:42] speak unto thee saying let us go after
[25:46] other gods I want you to listen to this
[25:48] how tricky it can be and the sign or the
[25:52] Wonder come to pass so a man will stand
[25:55] and say tomorrow about this time
[25:57] there'll be such and such and happen and
[26:00] you better take warning because it's
[26:01] going to happen by 10:00 in the morning
[26:03] something will happen in Johnson City
[26:05] and so and so and so and if it does
[26:08] that's a sign that one I'm telling you
[26:09] the truth and that William brandham is a
[26:12] false prophet and you young people
[26:14] better get away from it well say
[26:16] tomorrow at 10:00 that certain certain
[26:18] thing
[26:19] happens what are you going to
[26:22] do I'm going to say that man's a liar
[26:26] right why because what he's saying
[26:29] doesn't line up with the rest of the
[26:30] word now you see how tricky when you
[26:33] move Beyond visions and dreams into the
[26:36] re into the realm of Supernatural
[26:39] operation I'll be the first one to tell
[26:41] you I don't understand how Satan can be
[26:43] able to do it yet the prophet tells us
[26:45] in Harvest Time 1964 that Satan can hand
[26:48] out them Supernatural gifts by the
[26:52] handfuls you imagine the devil ain't
[26:54] handing out cigarettes ain't handing out
[26:56] marijuana joints and you know needles to
[26:59] shoot in your arms but to hand out gifts
[27:02] by the handfuls why cuz he knows
[27:04] everybody don't want whiskey everybody
[27:07] don't want marijuana Millions times
[27:09] millions of people want religion so he's
[27:12] got to have something to be able to give
[27:14] them that looks like God now the sign of
[27:17] the Wonder come to pass whereof he spake
[27:19] unto the saying let us go after other
[27:23] gods which thou Hast not known and let
[27:27] us ser them now this is what we're
[27:29] supposed to do according to the Old
[27:31] Testament Thou shalt not hearken unto
[27:34] the
[27:35] words of that
[27:37] Prophet or that dreamer of dreams for
[27:41] the Lord your God I want you to listen
[27:43] why this will happen now this blows some
[27:45] people's minds for the Lord your God
[27:50] proveth
[27:52] you you mean God would actually allow
[27:55] somebody to come in our ranks or come
[27:58] around sa in our
[28:00] church and they would have an anointing
[28:03] on them and they would actually start
[28:06] saying things and trying to pull people
[28:08] away from the message and away from the
[28:11] truth and God would allow that according
[28:15] to the Bible he will why to try you to
[28:20] try you you you and you to see will you
[28:24] stay with the word or will you you
[28:28] follow a a feeling a sensation or
[28:31] emotion a gift even though somebody can
[28:34] show you now what that man saying is not
[28:36] right it's not according to the
[28:38] scripture it's not according to the
[28:39] message of the hour you say oh but wait
[28:41] a minute wait a minute wait a minute
[28:42] that oh my goodness that that that
[28:43] actually happen sure sure there are
[28:46] things that can happen you don't judge
[28:48] them by the gifts you judge them by the
[28:51] word and the young people said amen now
[28:54] know this this is your Bible now the
[28:56] dreamer of dreams for the the Lord your
[28:58] God proveth you to know whether you love
[29:02] the Lord your God with all your heart
[29:06] and all your soul you shall walk after
[29:09] the Lord your God and fear Him and keep
[29:10] his Commandments and obey his voice and
[29:12] you shall serve him and cleave unto him
[29:16] and that Prophet or that dreamer of
[29:21] Dreams shall be put to
[29:25] death now if brother Brenham was a false
[29:29] Prophet according to almighty
[29:32] God God should have never let him live
[29:36] for
[29:37] decades God should have took his
[29:42] life according to the Bible God said
[29:45] they're not supposed to live so this man
[29:48] which many people say was the worst man
[29:51] that ever lived on the earth the
[29:53] greatest false prophet I just find it a
[29:56] Marvel that people would think the
[29:58] greatest Prophet outside the Lord Jesus
[30:01] that ever lived on the Earth was a false
[30:03] one you mean God is going to be outdone
[30:08] by the devil God is God is going to be
[30:11] outdone by Satan and Satan is going to
[30:13] have a prophet that's going to be so
[30:15] great and have so many miracles and so
[30:17] many signs and wonders and God will
[30:20] never be able to go above that oh sounds
[30:24] like to me we're serving a puny God
[30:26] don't it you
[30:28] wow and that Prophet or that dreamer of
[30:31] Dreams shall be put to death because he
[30:34] hath spoken to turn you away from the
[30:37] Lord your
[30:40] God which brought you out of the land of
[30:42] Egypt and redeemed you out of the house
[30:44] of bondage to thrust thee out of the way
[30:47] which the Lord thy God commanded thee to
[30:49] walk in so Thou shalt put evil from away
[30:54] from the midst of thee now let's watch
[30:56] this come to pass and Jeremiah
[31:00] 2815 a Prophet by the name of
[31:04] hananiah Jeremiah
[31:06] 28:15 then said the Prophet
[31:10] Jeremiah unto
[31:13] hananiah the
[31:15] prophet so we got Jeremiah the prophet
[31:19] and we got hananiah the prophet so
[31:23] Jeremiah is saying one thing and
[31:26] hananiah another another Prophet is
[31:29] saying another thing
[31:31] altoe and yet both of them are called
[31:35] prophets wow so what would we have done
[31:38] as Word of Life if we were living in
[31:41] that day and Jeremiah said you're going
[31:44] to
[31:45] Babylon he comes in with a
[31:48] Yol he's got his arms in it he takes two
[31:51] big beams of wood they put it around his
[31:54] neck cut it in half slide it together
[31:56] put it around his neck he's got his
[31:58] hands up in it like this he's got chains
[32:01] on him thus saith the Lord You're Going
[32:04] to Babylon Nebuchadnezzar will rule over
[32:08] you hananiah comes in another prophet
[32:13] and picks up a tool and takes that off
[32:16] of Jeremiah and busts that yoke all two
[32:19] pieces and said thus saith the Lord
[32:22] you'll come back in two
[32:25] years so here's one prophet saying
[32:28] you'll be down there 70 years another
[32:32] Prophet now not a witch not a sser not
[32:36] somebody that works at a circus but a
[32:40] prophet H you see this is why I said it
[32:43] many many years
[32:44] ago if something like this ever arises
[32:48] in and around the message it'd be
[32:51] amazing the effect that it'll have on us
[32:54] because people don't know how to judge
[32:56] by the word they don't do it by the word
[32:59] so you can show them the word I've dealt
[33:00] with many people around the world and
[33:02] you show them try to warn them off from
[33:03] a false prophet and you try to give them
[33:06] words scriptures and message quotes and
[33:08] scriptures and message quotes and they
[33:10] go right on following it it's already
[33:12] happening Among Us in reality now watch
[33:15] this then the Prophet Jeremiah said unto
[33:17] haniah the prophet here now
[33:21] hananiah the
[33:23] Lord ha not sent thee but thou May make
[33:28] us this people to
[33:31] trust in a
[33:34] lie so here was the
[33:36] king and what hananiah was saying
[33:39] blessings and good things why the lord
[33:41] loves you why God's not going to send
[33:44] you down there to Babylon why that old
[33:47] terrible place you're the children of
[33:49] God he loves you so much oh he knows you
[33:53] make mistakes and stuff like that that
[33:55] old Jeremiah he's just so mean
[33:58] and so hateful and so
[34:01] contrary and hananiah was more of a
[34:04] people type of a guy so which do you
[34:08] think most of the people would follow
[34:10] they're not going to follow Jeremiah
[34:12] they're going to follow hanon but now
[34:15] listen at what God's going to do God's
[34:17] going to fulfill the very word that he
[34:19] said in the book of Deuteronomy
[34:21] therefore thus saith the Lord behold I
[34:26] will cast thee off the face of the
[34:28] Earths this
[34:30] year Thou shalt
[34:35] die that's what God said that's what God
[34:41] does because thou has taught
[34:44] Rebellion against the Lord wow so
[34:49] hananiah the prophet died the same
[34:54] year in the seventh month so if God
[34:58] would do that to
[34:59] hananiah because hananiah was trying to
[35:02] lead the people
[35:03] astray and God let brother brandham live
[35:06] for
[35:08] decades and according to a lot of the
[35:10] people that have left the message go
[35:12] right on deceiving people and deceiving
[35:16] and lying and this and that and the
[35:18] other and God let him
[35:21] live for decades and
[35:25] decades and let his message live on why
[35:28] didn't God cause some type of
[35:30] supernatural phenomena to where all them
[35:33] tapes would be automatically
[35:37] erased so it would stop deceiving
[35:41] people but instead of stopping it it's
[35:44] went around the
[35:46] world why is God not treating him the
[35:50] way he did
[35:52] hania well the answer is quite simple
[35:55] cuz God don't feel about him the way he
[35:58] did
[36:00] ananiah Deuteronomy
[36:03] 18:20 but the prophet which shall
[36:06] presume to speak a word in my name which
[36:10] I have not commanded him to speak or
[36:13] that shall speak in the name of other
[36:16] gods even that
[36:19] Prophet say it with
[36:23] me
[36:25] what shall die
[36:29] you all believe God is a god of truth
[36:31] right oh why didn't God kill brother
[36:35] Bron why didn't God kill Paul now you
[36:38] see Paul was faced with the same thing
[36:40] in his day the galatian the judaizers in
[36:44] galatia come in after Paul founded the
[36:46] church and they started uh you know the
[36:49] devil is never the original missionary
[36:51] but he always comes in after other men
[36:53] of God go in and then do all the labor
[36:56] that he comes in trying to seal in their
[36:58] sheep so you watch who's the first one
[37:00] that goes out that's always the way
[37:02] Satan does it so he do the same thing in
[37:05] galatia trying to pull them Galatians
[37:08] and Paul said at one time you all would
[37:10] have pulled out your eyes because after
[37:13] you met the pillar of fire it affected
[37:15] his eyesight the rest of his life and
[37:17] the people would look at him and they
[37:19] felt so sorry for him because his eyes
[37:22] would water and he couldn't see
[37:24] sometimes you imagine a man praying for
[37:26] the sick and yet he himself can't hardly
[37:29] see sometimes and he wrote with large
[37:32] letters not a big letter as far as a
[37:34] book with many pages but he would have
[37:36] to write his Epistles in large letters
[37:39] and God heal the sick and rais the dead
[37:41] and cast out Devils through this man and
[37:44] he himself suffering this Affliction in
[37:46] his eyes and the Galatians looked at him
[37:48] and said oh I wish I could give him one
[37:51] of my eyes I wish I could Paul said at
[37:53] one time you would have given me your
[37:55] eyes you considered me as an angel of
[37:57] God even as Jesus Christ but have I now
[38:01] become your enemy because I've told you
[38:04] the truth so it was the judaizers from
[38:07] Jerusalem that now they started
[38:09] following in Paul's steps and they
[38:12] started following in missionary journey
[38:14] after he did to try to point them back
[38:18] to Judaism and where is that Judaism
[38:21] today where are those galatian followers
[38:26] dead
[38:28] where are the true followers of Paul
[38:32] here's
[38:32] one why God did not let his die come on
[38:36] children you understand where I'm going
[38:37] with this now watch and if Thou shalt
[38:40] say in thine heart how shall we know the
[38:43] word which the Lord has not spoken when
[38:47] a prophet speaketh in the name of the
[38:49] Lord if a thing follow not nor come to
[38:54] pass that is the thing which the Lord
[38:58] has not
[38:59] spoken but the prophet hath spoken it
[39:03] presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid
[39:07] of
[39:08] him now why would God phrase this in
[39:11] this
[39:13] terminology that you're not to fear a
[39:16] false prophet well I'm not very smart
[39:19] but that would lead me to believe I'm
[39:22] not to fear a false one but I am to fear
[39:26] a true one right
[39:28] because that man has the word of the
[39:30] Lord that make sense to you so a false
[39:33] prophet nah we don't fear them but now
[39:36] keep in mind that a prophet can say
[39:39] something and it may not even come to
[39:41] pass in his lifetime you imagine Isaiah
[39:46] saying the Lord himself shall give you a
[39:49] sign a virgin shall conceive and bring
[39:53] forth a child Isaiah 7:41 Isaiah 9 and6
[39:56] unto us a child is born a son is given
[39:58] the Mighty God the government be upon
[40:00] his shoulders
[40:03] 72 years after he said it it finally
[40:07] come to pass I wonder how many people in
[40:09] his generation said that man was a false
[40:15] prophet so you see we got to be very
[40:18] careful when we're weighing the words of
[40:19] a prophet there's words that Moses said
[40:24] over 2,000 years ago 3,000 years ago
[40:27] that still have not come to pass those
[40:30] words that Zachariah said which have not
[40:34] yet come to pass words that Malachi said
[40:39] that have not yet come to pass so we're
[40:40] going to wait till Malachi's words come
[40:43] to pass and then retrospect we will look
[40:46] back and say well now I can believe that
[40:48] Malachi was a
[40:50] prophet no God gives us enough
[40:54] Vindication for present tense then that
[40:58] gives us confidence to know the future
[41:01] tense will also come to pass you
[41:05] understand now how are we going to judge
[41:06] brother brandom we'll judge him the same
[41:08] way that God told us to in his word this
[41:12] is the pattern that God gave to judge
[41:14] prophets in the bible and it has never
[41:17] changed so you know a true Prophet we
[41:20] have no problem in judging him by the
[41:21] word now notice in Amos 3:
[41:25] 6 sh a trumpet be blown in the city and
[41:28] the people not be afraid shall there be
[41:31] evil in the city and the Lord has not
[41:34] done it
[41:36] surely the Lord God will do
[41:40] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[41:44] his
[41:45] servants the
[41:47] prophets so the Lord God will not do
[41:51] anything until he Reveals His secret to
[41:55] his servants the proph prophets now this
[41:58] is God's pattern the line hath roared
[42:01] who will not fear the lord God has
[42:03] spoken who can but
[42:07] prophesy now remember that many of the
[42:10] Patriarchs of the Old Testament as well
[42:12] as the uh founding fathers of the 12
[42:16] original
[42:18] tribes they live their lives without an
[42:22] Unwritten word as you've heard me say
[42:25] that the New Testament Church went for
[42:28] many many years 25 to 28 years something
[42:32] like that depending on the span of
[42:33] history that you look at before they
[42:36] actually had a new testament so they
[42:38] never had Matthew Mark Luke and John but
[42:41] they had the word which had been handed
[42:43] down to them and they also had the Old
[42:46] Testament prophets now I realize many
[42:49] the denominational people look at us
[42:51] they oh the Old Testament is fulfilled
[42:53] it's done done no it shows they don't
[42:55] even know their Bible because as a said
[42:57] there are some Old Testament scriptures
[42:58] that to this day have not yet come to
[43:00] pass read Isaiah 65 what is that
[43:03] pertaining to the Millennium Isaiah 66
[43:06] 8th day Zechariah 14 Ezekiel 38 Ezekiel
[43:10] 381 all the way down through that whole
[43:12] chapter that what is speaking about the
[43:14] Millennium Temple not even come to pass
[43:16] yet Ezekiel 39 40 41 42 even over
[43:20] through chapter 44 so it's the seventh
[43:22] day which is the Millennium and also the
[43:24] eighth day which is eternity so those
[43:27] words of God that Ezekiel said when he
[43:29] was alive was a Vindication to prove to
[43:32] the people of that day this man is a
[43:35] prophet so you can trust when he speaks
[43:38] thus sayeth the Lord now what's this in
[43:41] Genesis
[43:42] 15:1 this is what makes a prophet so
[43:46] unique and so different in the day of
[43:49] gospel preaching now many of the Old
[43:51] Testament prophets never actually stood
[43:54] up and preached so they wouldn't get
[43:57] behind a pull pit and take a text and
[43:59] say preach 45 minutes or an hour or
[44:02] something like that but this is the way
[44:03] they operated the spirit of God needed a
[44:07] a voice of humanity by which he would
[44:10] project by Vision a word from God now
[44:14] prophets are made different than you and
[44:16] I whenever we have dreams we actually go
[44:20] out of our conscience State when we
[44:22] enter into that stage of dreaming
[44:25] whenever we go out of conscience and our
[44:27] heart rate and all that course still
[44:28] operating by the subconscious and we go
[44:30] into a a a sphere or a realm to where
[44:33] that we dream but yet there's a part of
[44:36] us that when we wake up we will remember
[44:40] you've had dreams and you've dreamed
[44:41] that remember you wake up maybe you've
[44:43] had dreams and you've had them years ago
[44:45] and yet you can dream it and yet there's
[44:47] other times you know you had a dream but
[44:49] it's weird and strange and you can't
[44:50] remember hard nothing about it well can
[44:52] you imagine then you're standing here
[44:55] right now and all of a sudden it's like
[44:57] you would have a dream your W your eyes
[45:01] are wide open yet I would go into the
[45:03] realm of dreams and I would dream as I
[45:07] did several years ago before Carol and I
[45:11] were going to Delaware on a
[45:13] trip couple of days before we went we
[45:17] owned a black 98 o
[45:19] mobile and a few days before we left for
[45:22] that trip I had this dream and I saw
[45:26] Carol
[45:27] sitting on the side of the road in this
[45:31] car the driver's side fender had been
[45:34] hit a little bit of the grill had been
[45:37] hit I saw Carol I saw our preacher
[45:42] friend wife with her so it really
[45:45] troubled me I couldn't I couldn't get it
[45:47] off of my mind I I just couldn't get get
[45:50] over so I finally told Carol I said
[45:52] Carol you know just just be careful so
[45:55] her and Debbie was her name was going
[45:57] going to go out so I I decided to tell
[45:59] her I said just careful she said should
[46:01] I not go I said no no I I didn't say
[46:03] that but I said I just had this dream I
[46:05] just had this dream I just want you to
[46:07] be careful so her and and Debbie went
[46:10] out and sure enough she had a wreck um
[46:14] they called us uh whenever I walked up
[46:17] to the car it was exactly the way I saw
[46:21] it in a dream now that dream did not
[46:24] need to be interpreted it was plain
[46:27] there was no symbols there was no
[46:29] figures there was no you know this and
[46:31] that and the other it was just a plain
[46:33] dream the way God the angel of God told
[46:36] Joseph fear not to take into thee marry
[46:38] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[46:39] her is of the Holy Ghost now the prophet
[46:41] said the reason that God did that was
[46:44] there was no Prophet alive in that day
[46:46] to interpret that dream so God didn't
[46:49] give it to him in the form of symbols
[46:51] now you can imagine the feeling that I
[46:53] had when I walked up there of course
[46:56] first of all I Gra Carol I wasn't
[46:57] worried about the car you didn't replace
[46:58] the car I couldn't replace her so I
[47:00] grabbed her and she's tore all to pieces
[47:02] and Debbie was tore up and there it was
[47:06] that dream had materialized now say I
[47:09] would stand here tonight and all of a
[47:11] sudden I would go out of this first
[47:13] conscience yet My Eyes Are Open I'm
[47:15] still talking and I would be able to
[47:17] have another dream except this time it
[47:19] would be a 2020 black Equinox setting I
[47:22] here and I would see Carol driving it
[47:24] tomorrow the next day and I'm I'm still
[47:27] talking about that and yet before my
[47:29] eyes I'm seeing that happen well that's
[47:32] the way a vision would come to a prophet
[47:36] so a prophet would have that in him I
[47:39] have to go to sleep to have a dream
[47:42] y'all go to sleep right so you go out
[47:44] you enter into that them gamble waves or
[47:47] what they call and go out of that then
[47:48] your brain gets that where it relaxes
[47:50] your blood pressure goes down heart rate
[47:51] and so on and then you get into that
[47:53] realm to where that you can start start
[47:56] dreaming but what is it your eyes are
[47:58] open and yet you can have a dream that's
[48:00] so real you might wake up out of that
[48:02] dream ah you ever had a dream like that
[48:04] maybe you're ringing wet with sweat or
[48:06] you're scared or whatever I've had I've
[48:08] had one crazy dream I've had it for
[48:10] years of my life same dream it'll be
[48:13] different you know a little bit
[48:14] different but same dream all the time
[48:16] and the dream is this that I'm smoking a
[48:19] cigarette and I wake
[48:21] up ain't that crazy man whenever I wake
[48:24] up I wake up in a cold sweat I've never
[48:27] smoked in my life it's just got to be a
[48:29] tormented devil but yet a dream can be
[48:32] so real and when I come out of that
[48:34] dream I'll have sweat on my face sweat
[48:36] on my hands and I'll be tore all two
[48:39] pieces but a prophet now would be able
[48:42] to stand there and he's looking right at
[48:44] you and yet you appear before him at the
[48:48] age of 12 years old and now you're
[48:51] 30 and he would see you I see you I see
[48:56] you coming home from school you're
[48:59] wearing a yellow checkered
[49:01] dress a dog gets after
[49:04] you and I see you run in on the porch
[49:08] and you open the door the screen door to
[49:10] go like through the porch so here he's
[49:12] it's like him seeing a video or a movie
[49:15] of this years and years ago and then it
[49:19] would fast forward and go from
[49:21] there like this and it scared you
[49:24] bothered you your whole life but now
[49:26] you're delivered it will not bother he
[49:28] could see people with cancer see people
[49:30] with all kinds of things and one of the
[49:32] reasons he would know that they were
[49:34] well was it would turn light over them
[49:37] and many times if they stand there a
[49:39] 30-y old man he'd see them as a 65 or 70
[49:43] year old man and say go your way you're
[49:45] healed it'll never bother you again how
[49:48] was it Vision so it could go backwards
[49:51] in time it could bring him to the
[49:53] present and it could also fast forward
[49:56] and so what now you imagine a vision
[49:58] that a prophet would see and John on the
[50:00] aisle of patmas and he'd see all these
[50:02] symbols and all these things my goodness
[50:05] what in the world would all that mean he
[50:07] was seeing our day he saw his day he saw
[50:10] Wesley's day of course and he saw our
[50:12] day he's even saw Plum over into
[50:15] eternity sitting right there with his
[50:18] eyes wide open just like this it must
[50:21] have been very scary in one sense of the
[50:24] word to be around these men now watch in
[50:28] Genesis 15:1 Abraham was such a man
[50:32] after these things the word of the
[50:35] Lord came unto
[50:38] Abram in a
[50:40] vision the
[50:42] word of the Lord now we have the word of
[50:46] the Lord in a Bible but remember they
[50:50] didn't have one they did not have a
[50:53] Bible but God had something
[50:57] he wanted to
[50:59] say well how's God going to say it well
[51:02] he's got people on the Earth that are
[51:06] receivers now you to see me every time I
[51:08] get ready to come out or any the rest of
[51:09] these ministers or Brother
[51:11] Louie we've got this microphone now this
[51:14] is called the body
[51:15] pack it's a it's it works off of
[51:20] Wireless it has the ability to be able
[51:22] to change the signal inside this part
[51:25] then there's a reciprocate part right up
[51:27] here and this is the body pack and the
[51:30] receiver is up there now if I go in here
[51:32] with a little tiny screwdriver and I'm
[51:35] able to adjust the frequency on this
[51:37] body pack unless I adjust that one I can
[51:41] talk and scream and holler and it will
[51:44] not work at all this and that has to be
[51:48] on the same frequency now sometimes we
[51:51] will have bleed overs and there will be
[51:54] because we got so many microphones we'll
[51:56] have to set the range so we've had to
[51:58] expand our wireless capability so that
[52:01] there will not be bleed overs to where
[52:04] you can control it separately now that's
[52:06] the way God does with a prophet to where
[52:10] that a prophet has a direct frequency so
[52:13] he is has the body pack what is that
[52:15] it's his ability to go into a
[52:19] trance he's just sitting there with his
[52:21] eyes wide
[52:24] open Abram
[52:27] Abram
[52:29] Abram it must be very bizarre to see
[52:33] them as as they would do that because
[52:34] they're there they're alive they're
[52:36] they're well but in one sense of the
[52:38] word they can't communicate with you
[52:41] because the body pack is so in tune with
[52:45] God that God is projecting his word
[52:50] right down through them praise the
[52:53] Lord after these things the word of the
[52:56] Lord came unto Abram in a vision
[53:00] saying so the word of the Lord came to
[53:03] Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram
[53:09] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[53:14] reward now listen carefully to me when
[53:18] these things are
[53:19] spoken they are
[53:24] infallable they are perfect
[53:28] now the problem
[53:30] is if these prophets would stay in this
[53:33] realm right here every time they opened
[53:36] their mouths then every word they said
[53:41] would be thus sayith the
[53:42] Lord but the difference is when you have
[53:46] preaching
[53:48] prophets now remember all prophets in
[53:50] the Old Testament were not preaching
[53:52] prophets so when you have prophets that
[53:55] would also be called
[53:57] to do the work of an
[54:00] evangelist then the word of the Lord
[54:02] through the vision is absolutely
[54:06] perfect but remember when they preach
[54:08] they're going to be like any other
[54:10] man they're going to preach according to
[54:12] their understanding level does that make
[54:15] sense to you that's why in the message
[54:17] and I know I've been hated and ridiculed
[54:19] and criticized through the years because
[54:22] of showing people in the message itself
[54:25] that brother Brandon was a man and that
[54:28] brother brandham told us himself that he
[54:31] believed this way and that way and he
[54:33] had to change it
[54:35] later people already think I've crossed
[54:38] the line and there's no hope for me they
[54:41] actually feel so sorry for you all they
[54:43] do they pity you all because you're
[54:45] still coming to church here because they
[54:48] think I've crossed the line I blast them
[54:50] the Holy Ghost I think my goodness how
[54:52] in the work could I do that when I was
[54:54] proven my point by quotes right I mean
[54:57] how can I do that if that's true then
[54:58] brother brandom crossed the line you
[55:00] understand I hope she help said hope she
[55:02] helps you understand now watch whenever
[55:05] this would happen it's phenomenal
[55:08] whenever it would happen this is
[55:11] absolutely infallable now let me tell
[55:13] you give you an example when brother Ram
[55:16] preached in
[55:17] 1963 and he mentions about Martin Luther
[55:20] King in the Sunday morning service and
[55:23] he says Martin Luther King is going to
[55:25] lead a million of them people to their
[55:29] deaths brother and sister
[55:32] Humes met brother brandham after service
[55:35] on Sunday morning at the grocery
[55:39] store so they went to him they saw him
[55:41] in the grocery store and they asked him
[55:43] brother brandom was that thus sayith the
[55:46] Lord people are tore up they're so tore
[55:48] up was that he said no I I didn't say
[55:51] that was thus sayeth the Lord he said
[55:54] ask me that question to not brother
[55:57] Brenham got a pen out of his pocket and
[56:00] wrote it on the palm of his hand so when
[56:04] they come back to service that night
[56:07] brother and sister Humes said brother
[56:09] brandham was that thus sayeth the Lord
[56:11] or were you just making an announcement
[56:15] now they did this at his bidding so the
[56:17] question is laid there brother brandham
[56:19] reads that question and then he gives
[56:23] them this answer which a lot of people
[56:25] that make him in
[56:26] will not quote this quote though they
[56:29] say they believe every word he said was
[56:31] thus sayith the Lord but don't make a
[56:32] lot of sense to me now I've told you be
[56:38] careful to what you're listening to
[56:41] because when something is being said or
[56:43] going forth it will always say thus
[56:46] sayeth the Lord so if every word brother
[56:48] R said was thus sayeth the Lord would
[56:51] somebody please explain to me why I
[56:53] would have to say thus sayith the Lord
[56:55] at certain
[56:56] times right I mean maybe I ain't too
[57:00] smart I didn't graduate from college
[57:01] like some of you smart kids did but if
[57:03] every word is thus sayith the Lord why
[57:05] would you in particular have to say thus
[57:08] sayith the Lord at certain times and why
[57:10] would you have to come back and say I
[57:12] used to believe the Virgin births I I I
[57:15] used to believe that Mary produced the
[57:18] egg I used to believe that epilepsy and
[57:22] I used to believe this and do a study
[57:24] sometime and you'll find a whole bunch
[57:25] of changes why brother Brandon was
[57:28] preaching from the best of his
[57:30] understanding at the time now this is
[57:32] why some of the people have left the
[57:33] message because they believed they
[57:37] believed the wrong thing about a prophet
[57:41] they had a prophet of their own
[57:45] imagination now you
[57:48] imagine Abram a prophet of God
[57:54] lying and saying that Sarah was his
[57:58] sister you imagine Sarah lying yeah
[58:01] that's right that's right we're just
[58:02] we're just brother and sister that's
[58:05] right that's what we are and not telling
[58:07] the truth could you IM imagine a man
[58:10] being so afraid of his own hide that he
[58:14] would put his wife brother Tim would you
[58:17] do that to your wife put your wife at
[58:20] risk of some man taking
[58:23] her because you're so afraid
[58:27] now was that thus sayth the
[58:30] Lord was it thus saith the Lord whenever
[58:33] Elisha did what he did oh there's
[58:35] hundreds and hundreds of examples of
[58:37] course it was not the prophet said when
[58:39] Elisha called the two she Bears out of
[58:41] the Wilderness to kill them 42 kids he
[58:44] said that was not God it was the anger
[58:48] of the Prophet was it thus sayith the
[58:50] Lord when Elijah said unto the juniper
[58:52] tree and said Lord I'm the only one left
[58:57] God didn't agree with him but God said
[58:59] I've got 7,000 and that's never bowed
[59:01] the knee to
[59:02] bail is that right so you see when them
[59:05] prophets would move out from under that
[59:08] Supernatural realm of vision then what
[59:10] you do you go back to their Humanity
[59:12] imagine a man that stood up against some
[59:15] prophets of Baal killed every one of
[59:16] them I mean killed them to the blood run
[59:19] down over the hill Caroline I stood
[59:20] there a few years ago where he come out
[59:22] of his cave and stood there and they've
[59:23] got a big gigantic statue uh it's just a
[59:26] phenomenal amazing thing to see and
[59:29] knowing that he killed them right down
[59:30] there in the valley he goes down through
[59:32] there and say you want more of it glory
[59:33] to God he come out to her looking for
[59:35] him you want some of it too come on come
[59:37] on you want some of it and then the
[59:39] anointing leaves him and Jezebel said
[59:41] I'll do the same to you and he takes off
[59:44] Running Scared like a little rabbit
[59:47] looking and hiding for looking for a
[59:50] hole to hide into that same man that
[59:52] stood there with the anointing on him
[59:54] like that my
[59:57] goodness
[59:59] wow watch how these prophets did now 2
[1:00:03] Samuel chapter 7 verse4 and it came to
[1:00:06] pass that night that the word of the
[1:00:10] Lord
[1:00:12] came unto Nathan saying for when David
[1:00:16] was up in the morning the word of the
[1:00:18] Lord came unto the prophet Gad David
[1:00:22] sear
[1:00:24] saying watch how the word come now so it
[1:00:27] came to Nathan then in 2 Samuel 24:11
[1:00:32] the word came to Gad David sear again
[1:00:36] First Kings 18:1 and it came to pass
[1:00:39] after many days that the word of the
[1:00:41] Lord came to Elijah I want you to notice
[1:00:45] it wasn't like that every day these men
[1:00:49] had words from god notice how the author
[1:00:52] said that it came to pass after many
[1:00:56] days I wonder how long they went from
[1:01:01] one word to another one and sometimes we
[1:01:05] feel
[1:01:06] alone they didn't have nothing written
[1:01:10] to go back to many of them it must have
[1:01:13] been a lonely
[1:01:16] Journey it came to pass after many days
[1:01:20] that the word of the Lord came to Elijah
[1:01:22] so wonder what they went on in the those
[1:01:26] dry
[1:01:27] spells probably like you and I do well I
[1:01:30] I think I I wonder I I don't know wonder
[1:01:33] what's going on I I don't know I I don't
[1:01:35] have nothing from the Lord I I I don't
[1:01:36] know what to make of it where are we at
[1:01:38] what are we going
[1:01:39] through in the third year saying go show
[1:01:42] thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain
[1:01:46] upon the Earth 2 Kings 20 and4 and it
[1:01:48] came to pass before
[1:01:51] Isaiah was gone out into the middle
[1:01:53] court that the word of the Lord Lord
[1:01:56] came unto him saying now this is after
[1:02:01] Isaiah has told the king set a house in
[1:02:05] order you're going to
[1:02:08] die he turns his face to the wall and
[1:02:11] prays and God turns him right around and
[1:02:15] sends him right back in and said forget
[1:02:18] that Li thus sayith the
[1:02:20] Lord this one's
[1:02:24] fresher now you on imagine well you say
[1:02:27] which one was right they were both right
[1:02:29] for the
[1:02:30] time but God heard this man's prayer and
[1:02:34] sent this Prophet so the word come in to
[1:02:38] this Prophet watch's Jeremiah chapter 1
[1:02:42] verse 11 the words of Jeremiah the son
[1:02:44] of hilaya of the priest that were in
[1:02:47] anios in the land of
[1:02:51] Benjamin to whom the word of the Lord
[1:02:55] came in the days of Josiah the son of
[1:02:59] Ammon king of Judah in the 13th year of
[1:03:03] his Reign now you watch how that God
[1:03:06] would always have a prophet or a Seer as
[1:03:10] it would call the reason they called it
[1:03:12] a Seer was because he could see
[1:03:17] Visions now remember these men were not
[1:03:21] pastors per se like we would say okay
[1:03:23] well they meet they have counsel they
[1:03:25] have young people's question answers and
[1:03:27] then they meet with the older people and
[1:03:29] then they preach on Sundays and they
[1:03:31] preach on Wednesdays and then they
[1:03:32] preach special meetings that wasn't the
[1:03:34] way they done it they would come down
[1:03:36] with a word from the Lord and then
[1:03:39] they'd disappear they'd just be gone you
[1:03:41] wouldn't know where they at you wouldn't
[1:03:43] know where they lived M they might be
[1:03:45] gone disappeared for months at a time
[1:03:47] they were just waiting on
[1:03:49] God so this is the way God dealt with
[1:03:52] the Kings this is what he wanted them to
[1:03:54] have a sear God never made a king
[1:03:59] Prophet priest king that's reserved for
[1:04:05] himself never in the Bible do you find
[1:04:08] that Ezekiel 3:16 and it came to pass at
[1:04:13] the end of seven days that the word of
[1:04:15] the Lord came unto me saying Ezekiel
[1:04:19] 13:1 and the word of the Lord came unto
[1:04:22] me saying so how did these Prophets get
[1:04:26] this by the realm of vision when this
[1:04:30] comes it's
[1:04:32] totally absolutely without
[1:04:36] error completely infallible now you see
[1:04:41] when brother Brandon would have those
[1:04:42] words from God like that that's why he
[1:04:45] would say this kind of a statement that
[1:04:48] if God told him or showed him a vision
[1:04:51] that George Washington was going to be
[1:04:54] raised from the dead
[1:04:57] he would call the world to come and see
[1:05:00] it and he said I'd say somebody get him
[1:05:03] a chair because when he gets up he's
[1:05:04] going to little bit be a little bit
[1:05:06] tired he can sit down in that chair but
[1:05:09] now when it would come to him praying
[1:05:12] for people let me give you an example of
[1:05:14] that so A man had had got injured and
[1:05:18] bruised and his bows bust out of his
[1:05:21] side it was terrible terrible
[1:05:23] situation and there calling for brother
[1:05:25] to come and pray for the man but he
[1:05:28] didn't have no word from the Lord so he
[1:05:31] he was talking to Sister me he said now
[1:05:33] oh me he said oh if the Lord Jesus was
[1:05:36] here he could walk in there at that
[1:05:38] hospital and he he could lay his hands
[1:05:41] on that man and he'd say be
[1:05:43] healed and he said I and yeah and he
[1:05:45] said you know what well if the Lord
[1:05:47] would show me a vision he said then I
[1:05:49] got to thinking shame on you why even if
[1:05:53] he showed me a vision it be them same
[1:05:55] same dirty hands he said that would lay
[1:05:58] on that young
[1:05:59] man so in one sense of the word now
[1:06:02] don't misunderstand me brother Bram and
[1:06:04] having those Visions was an
[1:06:07] advantage over you and I taking the
[1:06:10] written
[1:06:11] word because he had all the same
[1:06:13] scriptures we do lay hands on the sick
[1:06:16] they shall recover they shall cast out
[1:06:18] Devils they shall do this but when he
[1:06:20] had a vision a word from the Lord it was
[1:06:23] like oh my a Dynamo on top of that
[1:06:27] promise you understand but it also got
[1:06:29] him so dependent on that that he felt
[1:06:33] sort of afraid kind of like I
[1:06:37] do kind of like you do you see what I'm
[1:06:42] saying he said then I thought well it
[1:06:44] would be the same dirty hands if I went
[1:06:46] in there with the vision or without he
[1:06:49] walks into the hospital lays his hand on
[1:06:52] that man but they wouldn't even given
[1:06:53] him no chance to even live the man
[1:06:55] showed up in the meeting that that night
[1:06:58] what was it God didn't want him to have
[1:07:00] a vision for that God wanted his own
[1:07:02] face in the promise of his commission
[1:07:06] this is why brother bam goes there two
[1:07:07] or three times in the phase of his
[1:07:09] ministry in 1959 he talks about in 1961
[1:07:12] apologizes to the people he said I
[1:07:14] pointed too much to the sign I've got to
[1:07:18] lead you to the the face and the
[1:07:21] promised word of God so you can imagine
[1:07:23] what a prophet would have this he'd say
[1:07:25] oh my my it it's going to happen there
[1:07:27] ain't no question about it it's
[1:07:28] definitely going to happen in one sense
[1:07:32] of the word young people your faith in
[1:07:36] following the Lord Jesus and his word
[1:07:38] believing it every day without this
[1:07:42] Vision Without this Vision you know the
[1:07:46] thing with Erica my daughter we we were
[1:07:49] claiming the promise God never showed me
[1:07:53] God never one time told me
[1:07:56] she was going to be healed and God
[1:07:59] supernaturally spoke to us many many
[1:08:02] times and our family prayer time with
[1:08:05] them but God not one time ever said she
[1:08:09] was going to be healed not one time
[1:08:12] there were other people that said the
[1:08:14] Lord told them this and this and this
[1:08:16] which did not
[1:08:19] happen but we were believing God's
[1:08:22] promise and we were taking God at his
[1:08:24] word and you say well brother Donnie
[1:08:27] wasn't it a mistake absolutely not it
[1:08:29] was not a mistake we were doing
[1:08:31] everything we were told to do that's
[1:08:34] that's general orders that's what we do
[1:08:37] you know what and I I believe it's all
[1:08:39] of my heart more people coming up with
[1:08:41] the same thing and every one of them
[1:08:42] that comes up with a diagnosis of cancer
[1:08:45] whatever I tell them this don't you look
[1:08:47] at Erica and say well y'all prayed for
[1:08:50] her what good did it do it was God's
[1:08:53] will to take her that don't mean it's
[1:08:55] God's will to take you so you look at it
[1:08:58] as an individual God what do you want
[1:09:01] for my life those people praying for her
[1:09:04] all over the world there was enough
[1:09:05] Faith prayed for that young and bless
[1:09:07] her heart that oh my that the graveyards
[1:09:10] could have been emptied out with all the
[1:09:11] people that was believing God you
[1:09:13] believe that I know you do so believing
[1:09:16] and living in that Realm of the word is
[1:09:18] a great compliment to your faith Jesus
[1:09:22] told Thomas Thomas you're you're blessed
[1:09:25] because you've seen but how much more
[1:09:27] blessed are those who have never seen
[1:09:31] and yet they believe any y'all here ever
[1:09:34] had a
[1:09:36] vision anybody ever had a
[1:09:39] vision and yet you believe God's word
[1:09:43] you believe God's word even without the
[1:09:45] vision you take God's promise don't you
[1:09:49] understand your Fai answers back to God
[1:09:52] and that's what draws his attention we
[1:09:55] believe his promise even sometimes when
[1:09:59] he won't say
[1:10:01] anything let me go on a few more minutes
[1:10:03] Canon notice this in Ezekiel 13:2 son of
[1:10:07] man prophesy against the
[1:10:10] prophets of
[1:10:12] Israel wow you talking about a battle
[1:10:16] these these were true prophets it wasn't
[1:10:19] just the soothsayers out there they had
[1:10:21] to deal with but they had to have false
[1:10:24] prophets among their own
[1:10:27] move Son of Man prophesy against the
[1:10:30] prophets of Israel that prophesy and say
[1:10:33] thou unto them that prophesy out of
[1:10:36] their own Hearts hear ye the word of the
[1:10:42] Lord now this is why when the people the
[1:10:45] true people of God would hear this they
[1:10:48] say Hey you can Bank your soul on it
[1:10:50] write it down it will come to pass but
[1:10:53] there were other Israelites that heard
[1:10:56] Ezekiel prophesy and they chose the
[1:11:00] other prophets because they were
[1:11:02] smoother you see Satan's always had it
[1:11:05] he had a Han and I back there he had a
[1:11:08] you know different ones down through
[1:11:09] time and he's got them in this day
[1:11:12] Daniel chapter 9:2 in the first year of
[1:11:15] his Reign I Daniel
[1:11:19] understood now listen this I love this
[1:11:23] by books
[1:11:28] wow so here is Daniel now he's went down
[1:11:32] to the land of Babylon him and his three
[1:11:36] friends you remember them you know them
[1:11:38] by Shadrach mesach and
[1:11:41] Abednego So Daniel had been reading some
[1:11:46] message
[1:11:49] books but it wasn't by our prophet of
[1:11:52] our day it was by his Prophet that had
[1:11:57] Liv before him anybody know what his
[1:11:59] name was
[1:12:01] Jeremiah so God had
[1:12:05] baroo which was a
[1:12:08] scribe that followed Jeremiah around
[1:12:10] Jeremiah didn't write but Baro
[1:12:14] wrote the books of Jeremiah and also the
[1:12:19] Lamentations of
[1:12:21] Jeremiah I find it so amazing because a
[1:12:24] few years ago
[1:12:26] they found in digging around the
[1:12:28] artifacts in in Israel they found down
[1:12:32] in some steps that had fallen down and
[1:12:35] laid there and they also found Timbers
[1:12:38] that dated back to
[1:12:40] 557
[1:12:42] BC when the temple was actually
[1:12:45] burned and they found the signant ring
[1:12:49] so they wore their seal on a ring and
[1:12:53] they found the ring King Of
[1:12:57] baroo The
[1:12:59] Scribe of Jeremiah now that don't make
[1:13:02] me believe it anymore but I love to
[1:13:05] Scorch the devil with them sort of
[1:13:06] things you know you just think wow it's
[1:13:09] been laying there for all of those years
[1:13:13] and somebody down there just digging
[1:13:15] around and they found it now the word
[1:13:19] had been written now this is kind of a
[1:13:21] little bit different time frame than it
[1:13:23] was for Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all
[1:13:24] them
[1:13:25] So Daniel is down there in Babylon
[1:13:27] remember God said they going to be there
[1:13:28] for 70 years in the first year of his
[1:13:31] Reign I Daniel understood by books the
[1:13:34] number of the years now Daniel is also a
[1:13:38] prophet so he thinks now wait a minute
[1:13:41] isn't it about time for an exodus or
[1:13:45] what we would say a
[1:13:47] Rapture so isn't it about time that
[1:13:51] we're supposed to be leaving Babylon so
[1:13:54] you know what he does he gets the books
[1:13:58] of
[1:14:00] Jeremiah and he said I begin to
[1:14:02] understood by books the number of the
[1:14:07] years whereof the word of the
[1:14:11] Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that
[1:14:15] he would
[1:14:16] accomplish 70 years in the
[1:14:20] desolations of Jerusalem so they had
[1:14:24] these readings or writings rather of the
[1:14:27] books the books of Jeremiah and they was
[1:14:30] reading the prophet's books which a lot
[1:14:33] of people probably in that day would
[1:14:35] have said you mean you're still reading
[1:14:37] the books of that man that died years
[1:14:40] ago well didn't he die back in
[1:14:43] 1965 well that's what they'd say in our
[1:14:46] day so you can imagine you're was Daniel
[1:14:49] a prophet of God but now God has written
[1:14:53] word so notice how God is going to deal
[1:14:56] with this Prophet with vision but also
[1:15:00] direct him through that which is written
[1:15:03] now God could have spoke to to Daniel
[1:15:05] and just said now look the time is n but
[1:15:08] God's going to bring both together
[1:15:10] because the prophecy of Jeremiah and the
[1:15:13] prophecy of Daniel will merge right
[1:15:15] exactly together that's why brother
[1:15:17] brandham was not afraid to read the New
[1:15:20] Testament the Old Testament and preach
[1:15:22] from it because he was not a false false
[1:15:25] prophet his prophecy coincided perfectly
[1:15:28] with the prophets before him Hosea 1
[1:15:33] verse one the word of the Lord that came
[1:15:36] unto Hosea the son of birod in the days
[1:15:40] of Uzziah josam ahaz and Hezekiah Kings
[1:15:45] of Judah now
[1:15:47] watch Once Israel and Judah
[1:15:51] divided God sent prophets to to Israel
[1:15:56] and he sent prophets to Judah but I want
[1:16:00] you to notice under the administration
[1:16:02] of
[1:16:03] Hosea that he was over several different
[1:16:07] Kings and their monarchy the word of the
[1:16:10] Lord that came un Hosea the son of bir
[1:16:13] in the days of Uzziah which was a king
[1:16:16] josam which was a king ahaz which was a
[1:16:20] king and Hezekiah which was a king but
[1:16:24] notice where he prophesied
[1:16:26] to
[1:16:27] Judah so he never went to Israel oh my
[1:16:33] you're talking about adoption and
[1:16:35] predestination and finding your spot
[1:16:39] it's amazing because the prophets of
[1:16:41] Israel never prophesied over to Judah
[1:16:46] and the ones of Judah never prophesied
[1:16:49] over there but they stayed in their
[1:16:52] ranks where God placed them and they
[1:16:55] functioned right there let me read one
[1:16:57] more scripture Canon then we'll stand
[1:17:00] the word of the Lord that came to Joel
[1:17:04] the son of
[1:17:06] pthu let's stand together I've got way
[1:17:10] too much more for us to go
[1:17:12] on now that's just enough to give you a
[1:17:14] little bit of a foundation then we'll
[1:17:15] pick it up again do you understand from
[1:17:19] the Old Testament why God used prophets
[1:17:23] how many understands let me see your
[1:17:24] hand you understand then why we why we
[1:17:28] see the
[1:17:30] value of God if he sent a prophet in
[1:17:33] this day the value not only of the thus
[1:17:38] sayith the
[1:17:39] Lords but of the teaching of that
[1:17:42] Prophet you see when Paul was here Paul
[1:17:45] would say I've received this from the
[1:17:47] Lord I got this from the Lord and then
[1:17:50] Paul would also say as one who has had
[1:17:53] the spirit of God this is not the Lord
[1:17:57] but this is I and I do believe I have
[1:18:01] the spirit of God so many people would
[1:18:04] say well brother Ram didn't say thus
[1:18:05] sayith the Lord I ain't taking it well
[1:18:08] that also means as part of the New
[1:18:09] Testament you wouldn't be able to take
[1:18:11] because the Bible also mentions about
[1:18:13] the traditions of the elders in the
[1:18:16] church so God chooses men to be able to
[1:18:21] write his word and speak it
[1:18:26] aren't you glad God loved us so much
[1:18:29] that he sent us a prophet we didn't just
[1:18:32] need a new pastor we didn't need a fiery
[1:18:36] evangelist or we didn't need a
[1:18:39] missionary that' be able to go and go
[1:18:41] around the world and tell people the
[1:18:44] same gospel that's been told for years
[1:18:46] and years but we needed a prophet to
[1:18:50] whom the word of the Lord can come to
[1:18:55] well brother Donnie can't God speak to
[1:18:57] you yes and he does God speaks to me
[1:19:01] there's very few weeks in my life that
[1:19:04] almighty God does not speak to me but
[1:19:08] God does not come to me in the form of
[1:19:12] the word the way he would to a prophet
[1:19:15] he would not come to me and give me
[1:19:17] something in the way that he would Hosea
[1:19:20] or Amos or Zachariah or Malachi or even
[1:19:23] brother brandom our prophet it might be
[1:19:25] something you know that he would speak
[1:19:27] to me to preach or I'll I'll give you an
[1:19:29] example I was down in the basement some
[1:19:31] time ago
[1:19:33] and I used to send Erica songs that I
[1:19:36] thought would be an encouragement to her
[1:19:37] and a help to her and it was from a
[1:19:39] playlist that I have on on iTunes and uh
[1:19:43] a song come up on there and it was one
[1:19:46] of her favorites that that I that I
[1:19:49] sinner several times actually and as I
[1:19:52] started listening to it I just become so
[1:19:56] overwhelmed with
[1:19:58] grief and I just broke down and started
[1:20:01] crying just
[1:20:03] uncontrollably and I said God you're
[1:20:06] perfect you make no mistakes I'm not
[1:20:09] questioning your wisdom I'm not
[1:20:12] questioning what you
[1:20:13] did but I just miss
[1:20:16] her so
[1:20:19] much and he let me say my
[1:20:23] peace and whenever I stop cuz I've
[1:20:26] learned through the years don't do all
[1:20:28] the Talking say what you need to say and
[1:20:32] let him
[1:20:34] respond and whenever I said that I
[1:20:37] paused and I stopped and he spoke back
[1:20:40] to me and said this if
[1:20:44] you could only see her
[1:20:48] now now that was his voice that was his
[1:20:52] presence but it was not a word for the
[1:20:54] this age it was not a word to get us
[1:20:58] ready for the Rapture it was not a word
[1:21:01] doctrinally that all the members of the
[1:21:03] Bride
[1:21:04] need it was something for
[1:21:07] me of course I shared it with Carol and
[1:21:10] some of my family
[1:21:11] members cuz I've been waiting for so
[1:21:15] long to hear him say something to me
[1:21:17] about the
[1:21:19] situation and I don't know why that he
[1:21:21] waited
[1:21:25] but I'm just so glad that I heard from
[1:21:27] him I love those times when he speaks to
[1:21:31] me but I don't have the gift like these
[1:21:35] men that we've read about tonight and
[1:21:37] the word of the Lord come to brother
[1:21:38] Daryl and the word of the Lord come to
[1:21:40] brother Ron Spencer and the word of the
[1:21:42] Lord come to brother Tim no that cannot
[1:21:45] happen it only happens to a
[1:21:49] prophet and God loved you so much and
[1:21:52] not only loved you but he saw our need
[1:21:55] for one you see it wasn't that God gave
[1:21:58] us just a little bit more decoration for
[1:21:59] this age or just you know I just want to
[1:22:01] add a little something extra to you all
[1:22:04] he knew he would be in such horrible
[1:22:06] shape and the Darkness of the world in
[1:22:08] religion would be so dark look out here
[1:22:11] you rub shoulders with them every day
[1:22:13] look at what what we we know and people
[1:22:15] that are religious you work with them
[1:22:17] you go to you go to school with them and
[1:22:19] what every more work with them and my
[1:22:20] this place is a very religious place is
[1:22:22] it not very religious but there's a
[1:22:25] great difference in religion and having
[1:22:27] the truth and God knew there would need
[1:22:30] to be a prophet that would come and
[1:22:32] restore the original Faith back to what
[1:22:36] the apostolic fathers
[1:22:38] had let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank
[1:22:42] you tonight father for your
[1:22:45] word I want to say to you
[1:22:48] again how I appreciate the message of
[1:22:51] the
[1:22:53] hour we know know that the
[1:22:55] message did not come to replace our
[1:23:00] Bible you never sent a prophet in this
[1:23:04] day to replace us going to church
[1:23:08] letting our light shine witnessing to
[1:23:11] people letting people know that you're
[1:23:15] alive and you're the same yesterday
[1:23:17] today and
[1:23:18] forever but Lord what we needed was one
[1:23:22] that could catch the word for this day
[1:23:26] and it would not replace our Bibles or
[1:23:29] do away with them Lord I love my Bible
[1:23:33] now more than I've ever loved it as a
[1:23:36] matter of
[1:23:37] fact all we looked at tonight was
[1:23:41] scripture and there's a whole lot more
[1:23:43] where that come
[1:23:44] from but father we're so
[1:23:47] thankful that with this message comes
[1:23:51] light so when we read the Bible now we

[1:27:18] tonight I can't wait to to hear the rest
[1:27:20] of that I I know I don't know why
[1:27:24] um today I was reading some some quotes
[1:27:27] today and kind of kind of coincidence or
[1:27:32] ironic whatever you want to call it but
[1:27:34] was brother Brandon was talking in the
[1:27:35] church ages and we talked about the
[1:27:38] Ephesian Church age he said that
[1:27:40] Paul was the pattern that God set for
[1:27:43] all true Ministers of God he said Paul's
[1:27:47] manner of ministering was the pattern
[1:27:51] that every true minister of God
[1:27:54] you know and you look at this age and
[1:27:56] God continued that pattern all the way
[1:27:57] down through the church ages and then we
[1:28:00] get to this church age they decid it's
[1:28:01] got to be
[1:28:03] different they get away from that true
[1:28:05] pattern that God said put him aside and
[1:28:07] they put a mechanical machine in that
[1:28:10] place to the very ones that said they
[1:28:13] believe exactly what he said he said the
[1:28:15] true pattern is a
[1:28:17] minister so you know when you look at
[1:28:19] that brother Brandon believed that CU
[1:28:22] whenever he said he won't Bey on the
[1:28:23] curtain of time and they and he said are
[1:28:25] all them millions of people that he
[1:28:28] saw he said are these brandom he said no
[1:28:31] these These are you the ones that you've
[1:28:32] led to the Lord and and they he said
[1:28:35] will Paul be
[1:28:38] there they said he'll be there with his
[1:28:41] group they said well if Paul will be
[1:28:43] there I will be there because I preached
[1:28:45] what he preached he continued that
[1:28:48] pattern that God gave him you know when
[1:28:50] you listen to brother brother Donny was
[1:28:52] talking about how God comes to the
[1:28:53] prophet
[1:28:54] when he comes up prophets to bring a
[1:28:55] message to the
[1:28:57] prophet when you come in here Sunday and
[1:29:00] Wednesday and Thursday night that's
[1:29:02] God's same way of speaking to you what
[1:29:04] he's given to the prophet and then he
[1:29:06] gives it to you you have to receive it
[1:29:07] in the same spirit that Prophet did
[1:29:10] because it's God's
[1:29:11] word so it's so wonderful I I I really
[1:29:14] enjoyed that and and and whoever asked a
[1:29:16] question I know it's hard to explain to
[1:29:20] somebody why do you believe in brother
[1:29:23] brandom I was with a buddy sometime this
[1:29:26] past fall this past spring and somebody
[1:29:29] asked us that he goes it's pretty simple
[1:29:33] the Bible said a word comes to the
[1:29:34] prophet first the guy was a Baptist
[1:29:38] guy said I can see that word comes to
[1:29:41] the prophet first God never changed his
[1:29:44] pattern you know he he you know we
[1:29:46] didn't get down to Le odyssea and God
[1:29:48] said I'm going to do something different
[1:29:50] still the same and and I'm so thankful
[1:29:52] for that so you know you
[1:29:54] know written Epistles read of all men
[1:29:56] you're going to preach Christ until they
[1:29:58] ask you about the messenger so you're
[1:30:00] not going to shove the messenger down
[1:30:01] their throat so preach Christ subject of
[1:30:05] the Messenger will come up promise you
[1:30:07] that so God bless you um thank you all
