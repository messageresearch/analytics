[44:28] Millions times millions of them will go
[44:32] to singing worshiping and praising
[44:37] him nobody with tired hands or tired
[44:41] voices or sore throats we just worship
[44:44] and
[44:46] praise and the angels of God will have
[44:48] to go off and circle the Earth while
[44:52] we're singing and this Anthem is coming
[44:54] up and they're singing w
[44:57] wow they've sung to him for
[45:01] Millennia they've sung to him for
[45:03] ages but they can't sing this
[45:06] song because they haven't been
[45:09] redeemed we're blessed today aren't
[45:13] we lord Jesus we love you so
[45:17] much we thank you for what you mean to
[45:20] us today
[45:22] Father we're so grateful that you loved
[45:24] us so much you came to this wicked sin
[45:27] evil
[45:28] world to be able to purchase our
[45:32] salvation and a privilege Lord that we
[45:34] could not only be saved but then in turn
[45:38] become your instrumentality on the earth
[45:42] that you could use us to help
[45:45] others and that Paul would said that not
[45:48] only have we been reconciled but we have
[45:51] the ministry of
[45:54] reconciliation then he said be you
[45:56] therefore or reconciled to
[45:59] God lord Jesus we've gathered here today
[46:02] that we could sing that we could pray
[46:04] that we could praise and
[46:07] worship now it comes a portion of the
[46:09] word and I pray that you'd help me Lord
[46:13] help me to be able to get out of the way
[46:15] Lord shut my mouth to anything that
[46:17] would displease
[46:18] you may things of Eternal value Lord be
[46:22] accomplished out of this service
[46:25] today no doubt there's folks F that are
[46:27] sick we pray for their healing Lord some
[46:30] that may be weary some that may be
[46:32] indifferent Lord we know brother Randy
[46:35] and his family are certainly still need
[46:38] in prayer for sister tresa's crossing
[46:41] over and we Rejoice for her today but
[46:45] it's just that empty spot that it leaves
[46:47] in our hearts so we pray that you'd help
[46:50] them not only them but others that have
[46:52] lost loved ones how we're waiting for
[46:55] that time to be gathered together Lord
[46:56] Lord take the service today we pray in
[47:00] the name of
[47:01] Jesus thank you Lord and the saint said
[47:05] amen praise the Lord praise the
[47:09] lord we worship you
[47:13] Jesus we worship you Lord
[47:17] Jesus thank you
[47:19] Father
[47:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[47:25] hallelujah we worship Worship You Lord
[47:27] God
[47:29] than thank you Lord
[47:32] Jesus
[47:34] hallelujah praise the
[47:37] Lord praise the
[47:40] Lord turn wisdom if you would to Second
[47:43] Peter chapter 1 verse
[47:45] 2 we greet you today in the name of the
[47:48] Lord Jesus happy to see each one of you
[47:50] trust that you're doing well by the
[47:52] grace of God glad to see some of you
[47:54] back that's been sick and went able to
[47:57] be here we thank the Lord that you've
[47:59] recovered and still others that are sick
[48:02] flu and covid and different things like
[48:05] that so we certainly want to remember
[48:06] our brothers and sisters in prayer the
[48:09] Lord will just be with them and
[48:11] strengthen them and help
[48:13] them second Peter chapter 1 verse
[48:17] 2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto
[48:21] you through the knowledge of God and of
[48:25] Jesus our
[48:27] Lord according as his divine
[48:32] power ha given unto us all things that
[48:37] pertain unto life I want you to notice
[48:41] Peter doesn't say that pertains to
[48:44] death but that pertains to
[48:47] life and godliness through the knowledge
[48:51] of him that has called us to glory and
[48:55] virtue now remember this is what we're
[48:57] called to glory and virtue not division
[49:01] contention troublemaking all that sort
[49:05] of stuff that's not who we are called us
[49:08] unto glory and virtue whereby are given
[49:12] unto us exceeding great I love the
[49:15] adjectives that he used to describe
[49:18] these exceeding which means Moun
[49:20] beautiful and abounding exceeding great
[49:25] and precious great great and precious
[49:29] promises that by these ye might be
[49:33] partakers of the divine nature having
[49:37] escaped the corruption that is in the
[49:40] world through
[49:43] lust and beside this so after you've
[49:46] come to that part and beside this giving
[49:50] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[49:55] let's look at this word again add
[49:57] meaning is so so beneficial for us I
[50:00] think add is Minister nourishment to
[50:04] supply or furnish ministered unto or
[50:11] assisted so beside this giving all
[50:14] diligence then assist add to minister to
[50:20] your faith virtue so in the Greek it's
[50:23] it says it like this in The Possession
[50:26] of your faith Minister
[50:30] virtue and then in verse six and to
[50:33] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[50:35] patience and to patience godliness and
[50:39] to Godliness brotherly
[50:42] kindness and even though it doesn't say
[50:44] sisterly it's sisterly
[50:47] too so don't your sisters get to
[50:50] thinking praise God brother Donnie sure
[50:52] preached on them brothers today no no
[50:55] it's for you too
[50:57] and to brotherly
[50:59] kindness oh my and to brotherly kindness
[51:04] charity so then each Grace each virture
[51:08] that starts and takes root and begins to
[51:10] grow then each one of those being
[51:13] assumed they become the stepping stone
[51:16] for the next one and then the latter in
[51:19] turn caps off the whole thing so Faith
[51:24] leads faith
[51:27] leads and love caps off am amen may the
[51:32] Lord bless his word you may be
[51:36] seated how many can say already it's
[51:39] good to be in the house of the Lord
[51:45] sorry to some people these things might
[51:49] be as if though they would be
[51:51] impossible for a human being to ever
[51:54] attain to such a thing but we know that
[51:57] God never says anything in his word
[52:00] especially for his people to try to
[52:03] achieve to and then set an impossibility
[52:06] before them and them never be able to
[52:08] get to it and I know I'm looking at
[52:11] people today that have been through a
[52:12] lot of hard things in life a lot of you
[52:15] have been betrayed you've been forsaken
[52:18] by family friends maybe you felt
[52:21] isolated because of different things
[52:24] about you no doubt more than likely
[52:27] every one of us here today probably have
[52:29] at least one complex I mean
[52:34] 100 and some of you's got 200 uh we've
[52:38] got fears we've got phobias right uh I
[52:43] mean there's so many fears and phobias
[52:45] this week I was reading about a new one
[52:47] that they just diagnosed not long ago
[52:50] and it was the fear of catchup and I
[52:52] thought I feel so sorry for those poor
[52:54] people I mean t just wouldn't be ters
[52:57] without ketchup right but you think of
[53:01] all that Satan has done to the
[53:04] generation that we live in that
[53:06] everywhere they look they have all types
[53:09] of fears and phobias people are afraid
[53:12] of sunlight some are afraid of Starlight
[53:16] some are afraid of moonlight some are
[53:19] afraid of people some are afraid of
[53:21] animals some are afraid of this and that
[53:22] and the other and you realize that Satan
[53:25] is working almost like it's overtime to
[53:28] bring people under such oppression of
[53:32] demonic power and we know that the
[53:35] floodgates if I can say it that way or
[53:37] of Hell have been opened in this last
[53:41] day and in the midst of all of that God
[53:44] has designated a time that he would
[53:47] bring certain passages of scripture to
[53:51] fruition and demand that they be met by
[53:55] a group of of human beings on the face
[53:58] of the Earth so instead of making
[54:00] excuses for our phobias and our fears
[54:04] and making excuses well let me alone
[54:06] I've got this trauma and I've got that
[54:09] trauma and I've got this and that and
[54:10] the other and I'll never be no different
[54:13] I I don't think we have to live
[54:15] underneath the control of those things
[54:17] is that right for the Bible tells us God
[54:20] has not given to us the spirit of fear
[54:23] but of love and of power and of a sound
[54:29] mind not a confused mind not a mind that
[54:32] is so tore up that it doesn't even know
[54:36] what is right and wrong and then we know
[54:39] that that being before us that God makes
[54:42] a way by which we're able to attain to
[54:46] these virtues that Peter wrote about
[54:49] 2,000 years ago now we believe that in
[54:52] that Beginning church that they had
[54:54] these things in full manifestation
[54:57] though the the major focus of the virtue
[55:01] that God started off the foundation of
[55:03] that church was Faith but it was not
[55:07] faith alone that they had now the word
[55:10] faith comes from the Greek word pistus p
[55:13] i s t i s so it is a conviction that
[55:18] something is real a conviction that
[55:22] something is real but then Paul wrote
[55:25] about also in the Book of Romans that it
[55:28] would be from Faith to Faith so it's not
[55:33] like that you get Fai and then you
[55:35] believe there's a cross you believe
[55:37] there's a heaven you believe there's a
[55:39] hell you believe there's a God and you
[55:41] believe Jesus came to save you from
[55:43] going to hell and then you stop that's
[55:45] where many people do stop but there is
[55:49] also a face to another face to another
[55:53] face to another face until it Le leads
[55:56] us into that place to where we as
[55:59] individuals will be capped off at the
[56:02] very top of our life with what charity
[56:06] which is the personal presence of the
[56:09] Lord Jesus himself now we can't read
[56:12] ourself into it we cannot have all kinds
[56:15] of self-help books and go to this
[56:18] therapist and that therapist and you
[56:20] know go to this psychologist and this
[56:23] psychiatrist and this individual we get
[56:25] this for this and this mad for that I'm
[56:28] not against people getting meds for this
[56:30] and that and the other but I don't think
[56:31] any medication will ever take place of
[56:33] the Holy
[56:34] Ghost as a matter of fact Satan leads us
[56:37] around that medication Tree of Life I'm
[56:40] afraid many times that tree of knowledge
[56:42] rather then it it we we get a
[56:44] replacement for what God actually wants
[56:46] us to have which is that deep peace
[56:48] settled down inside of our soul but
[56:51] people you know the sad thing about it
[56:53] is that there's many Christians in the
[56:55] day and and hour that we live and they
[56:57] will never attain to this that we just
[57:00] read even though it was given 2,000
[57:03] years ago and people have not focused on
[57:06] it because it's like well they don't
[57:07] really understand it maybe or they don't
[57:10] see it as the building blocks that God
[57:12] has given for his church and if you
[57:15] don't understand that God reveals
[57:17] himself to his church in a progressive
[57:20] way then once people come to him and
[57:23] they get saved and they think what more
[57:25] do I need what more do I need so if your
[57:28] child would take that same attitude
[57:31] whenever it was a newborn and then your
[57:34] baby grows and it grows and and you know
[57:36] physically it grows into a a young boy
[57:39] or a young girl but yet it never talks
[57:42] it never walks and is still taking a
[57:45] bottle here it is 8 years old taking a
[57:48] bottle sucking on a pacifier and it
[57:50] don't know how to crawl it don't know
[57:52] how to walk you mean it's a parent you
[57:55] would be okay with that you would be
[57:57] fine with that 5-year-old child of yours
[58:00] and it just lays on its belly like it
[58:02] did when it was 6 months old and it R
[58:05] rolls over on its back every now and
[58:07] then and then it'll kick and it's 5
[58:09] years old and it's still wearing a
[58:11] diaper it's 5 years old it's never
[58:14] learned how to say mama daddy it's never
[58:16] learned how to say anything you parents
[58:19] would be okay with that you would be
[58:22] okay with that 5-year-old boy going into
[58:24] an eight-year-old boy and then a
[58:26] 10-year-old boy and then you send him to
[58:29] school and he don't know how to spell he
[58:31] don't even know how to speak he don't
[58:33] know how to write anything because you
[58:36] were satisfied with him being that baby
[58:40] why of course you wouldn't whenever you
[58:42] take that child to the doctor and the
[58:45] doctor would say well how is he so this
[58:47] is his first year checkup second year
[58:49] third year fourth year is he talking up
[58:52] no I can't say anything he's still
[58:53] laying on his back he's saying wait a
[58:55] minute something something yours wrong
[58:57] that this is not right he should be
[58:59] doing this and doing that why because
[59:02] they have a chart by which they go by
[59:04] well God also has one for Christianity
[59:08] it's called his
[59:10] Bible God has a chart now the sad thing
[59:12] about it is there are many Christians
[59:14] that have been saved for decades they're
[59:17] 20 25 30 35 40y Old Christians and they
[59:22] can't talk Faith talk they can't talk
[59:25] the Deep ER things of God and they're
[59:28] still just goo gooing and Jesus died on
[59:31] the cross and I love Jesus and Jesus
[59:34] loves me and don't tell me nothing about
[59:36] deep things of God I'm just a baby goo
[59:39] goo goo and it's time for you to get
[59:41] that pacifier out of your mouths and
[59:44] grow
[59:45] up praise the Lord now this is the way
[59:48] God has built his church and it's the
[59:51] way that he's building his individuals
[59:53] so it's more than just getting saved and
[59:56] but that is the start and it's a great
[59:58] start of course and salvation transforms
[1:00:01] our life and makes us such a different
[1:00:04] person and for many people you can see
[1:00:07] why that it done such a great thing in
[1:00:10] them they think why do I need anymore
[1:00:14] because it so changed me I I I saw
[1:00:17] carollyn I saw a documentary the other
[1:00:19] night and it was of an Iranian guy from
[1:00:22] Iran and he was taught since a little
[1:00:25] bitty Bor to hate Israel so he went
[1:00:28] through a little bit of his life and he
[1:00:30] was talking about that in school that
[1:00:32] every day in school they would teach
[1:00:35] them to hate Jews and to he hate Israel
[1:00:39] and oh my I mean from a little bitty guy
[1:00:42] he started growing up growing up and he
[1:00:45] hated them absolutely hated them but
[1:00:48] something began to happen and he began
[1:00:50] to change and one day the spirit of God
[1:00:54] found this younger man
[1:00:56] and he began to deal with him and he
[1:00:58] began to read in a Bible and quite an
[1:01:00] amazing phenomenal story of what the
[1:01:03] Lord had done for this man and you could
[1:01:05] hear from him talking that he didn't
[1:01:08] really understand a lot about the latter
[1:01:10] day and the latter time and all that but
[1:01:13] I was so amazed just at what salvation
[1:01:17] had done for this man now he's a pastor
[1:01:20] and he's got a church and he's trying to
[1:01:22] help others and he moved from Aran to
[1:01:25] Israel
[1:01:26] and now he's going about helping the
[1:01:28] Jews can you imagine an Iranian going
[1:01:32] about helping Jews fixing meals for them
[1:01:35] so during the time of this war he's been
[1:01:37] going around helping the wounded helping
[1:01:39] the sick and the people are looking at
[1:01:41] him like he's a spy of course not
[1:01:44] knowing what in the world has happened
[1:01:46] and I thought what a great thing that
[1:01:48] salvation is to be able to get a man
[1:01:51] that was hated from being a child to
[1:01:55] love a people and he said as he begin to
[1:01:57] read the Bible he realized that the
[1:02:20] muhammadislam and the men will remove
[1:02:22] their shirts and they will take their
[1:02:24] hands and they will take whips and they
[1:02:27] hit themsel as thousands times them
[1:02:30] thousands go around the Black Box the
[1:02:32] holy sacred side of Islam and I saw them
[1:02:36] in this documentary and their backs were
[1:02:38] nearly bleeding and their chest and
[1:02:41] their face and their heads because
[1:02:43] they're beating themselves and they're
[1:02:45] trying to make peace and trying to find
[1:02:49] something I don't have to beat myself he
[1:02:52] was beaten for me you don't have to beat
[1:02:56] yourself he was beaten for you as well
[1:02:58] is that right but yet look now this man
[1:03:01] more than likely by his speech and the
[1:03:04] way he was talking he knew nothing about
[1:03:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he knew
[1:03:08] nothing about the evening light and what
[1:03:11] God has done but yet salvation was so
[1:03:15] powerful to that man and I was alarmed
[1:03:17] by what he went on to say he said in
[1:03:21] Iran there are millions of Iranians and
[1:03:25] remember Iran is actually Persian it is
[1:03:29] Persia it is not Saudi Arabia it is not
[1:03:33] cutter it is not any of the rest of them
[1:03:36] they are Persians and this man said that
[1:03:39] he began to read his Old Testament and
[1:03:42] remember it was Cyrus which was a
[1:03:45] Persian it was actually xeres that
[1:03:49] married Esther the Persians have a great
[1:03:52] tie to the Jews and it was like once
[1:03:55] this man started reading his Bible and
[1:03:57] finding out that Iran actually was
[1:04:01] Persia and finding scriptures in
[1:04:03] Jeremiah that prophesied about Persia
[1:04:06] being returned back to the Lord in the
[1:04:09] last day and this man witnessing to
[1:04:12] others and telling them we are not
[1:04:15] Iranians but we are Persians and I
[1:04:17] thought my goodness just with salvation
[1:04:20] with the power of the Cross and the
[1:04:23] power of the blood helping them to find
[1:04:25] a national identity that they are not
[1:04:29] Iranians now the Iranians went in and
[1:04:31] they took it over and the imams and ayas
[1:04:34] and all that those of you in case you
[1:04:36] don't know it whenever you will see an
[1:04:37] Ayatollah and he has a black turban
[1:04:40] around his head that means he's a direct
[1:04:43] descendant supposedly from Muhammad
[1:04:46] those who wear the white ones they are
[1:04:48] not direct descendants from Muhammad and
[1:04:51] yet they trying to change the identity
[1:04:53] of this whole nation but he said I can
[1:04:55] tell you they are getting fed up with it
[1:04:58] and he said Christianity is exploding in
[1:05:01] Iran and according to this man now he
[1:05:04] said there are millions of them that
[1:05:07] have already turned from Islam and are
[1:05:11] turning to Christianity I thought Lord
[1:05:13] are we that close to the coming of the
[1:05:15] Lord could this be part of the last call
[1:05:19] that people I'd already heard that even
[1:05:22] in Gaza that Jesus has been appearing to
[1:05:26] some of the Muslims there in the form of
[1:05:29] dreams and the form of different things
[1:05:32] and even in Gaza while the war has been
[1:05:35] going on they've been giving their heart
[1:05:38] to Jesus Christ listen Word of Life we
[1:05:41] better wake
[1:05:42] up come on somebody we need to be ready
[1:05:46] to leave this world in a moment in a
[1:05:49] twinkling of an eye by the power of God
[1:05:53] now will many of these people ever go on
[1:05:55] on to be of what the bride the elect
[1:05:58] part will be well there may be an
[1:06:00] element of them that are there I know
[1:06:02] there's some Works in Iran there are
[1:06:04] some Works in Egypt there are some Works
[1:06:07] in different parts of the world and we
[1:06:10] thank God for every one of them that are
[1:06:11] there but remember there is another work
[1:06:14] also which is in the kingdom of God and
[1:06:18] that is the work of the Cry of the
[1:06:20] foolish virgin and they will get many of
[1:06:24] them will get saved sa D but because
[1:06:27] they are not elected remember whenever
[1:06:29] Rebecca came out of the land of her
[1:06:33] father and her mother and her people and
[1:06:35] she left the land that it was not just
[1:06:38] Rebecca alone that came out but the
[1:06:40] Bible tells us her Maids came out with
[1:06:43] her they heard the same stories that
[1:06:46] elaser told Rebecca they drank from the
[1:06:50] same water and they ate from the same
[1:06:52] stored up food but when they got to work
[1:06:55] Isaac was not a one of them Maids ever
[1:06:59] married Isaac only Rebecca got Isaac
[1:07:03] well come on now now I know it makes it
[1:07:05] hard for people but remember God has a
[1:07:09] multifaceted aspect by which the kingdom
[1:07:12] of God will take in all types of people
[1:07:16] and the kingdom of heaven was liken unto
[1:07:18] a man that went out to throw a n a net
[1:07:21] into the sea and Jesus told us about the
[1:07:24] parable of the sea and the parable of
[1:07:26] the fish and they're all drawn together
[1:07:29] so is it in the kingdom of God that
[1:07:32] there is wise virgin there is foolish
[1:07:35] virgin there is 144,000 there are those
[1:07:39] that will live outside the city so if
[1:07:41] we're not careful we'll get tunnel
[1:07:43] vision and focus on us and our family
[1:07:45] and think well that's all God's
[1:07:47] interested in God is interested in every
[1:07:50] human being that can be saved on the
[1:07:53] face of the Earth
[1:07:56] well you know what if God is I am what
[1:07:58] about you so what we want to focus on
[1:08:02] today by the help of the Lord is us in
[1:08:04] our position wherever you are ordained
[1:08:07] of God to walk and the light that God
[1:08:10] has called you in for myself I can never
[1:08:13] be satisfied just being a saved person I
[1:08:16] can never be satisfied just being a
[1:08:18] person that you know reads your Bible on
[1:08:21] occasion I go to church on the occasion
[1:08:24] and I live for God whenever want to and
[1:08:26] what I don't want to well I don't live
[1:08:27] for it that that's not who I am I I can
[1:08:30] never be satisfied doing that now I've
[1:08:33] given my heart to the Lord as you know
[1:08:34] whenever I was just a young boy been
[1:08:36] preaching for over 50 years now so I
[1:08:38] have no desire somebody asked me not
[1:08:40] long ago if I was going to retire I
[1:08:42] thought what in the world would I do if
[1:08:43] I retired I'd go absolutely nuts now
[1:08:46] they ain't no way I'm at the age of
[1:08:47] retirement brother Donnie you're 68
[1:08:49] almost 69 well don't tell me Tell God
[1:08:52] I've still got my right mind so far I've
[1:08:54] still got a lot lot of energy and as
[1:08:56] long as I have I'm going to keep on
[1:08:57] going so to me it's no time age limit
[1:09:01] has nothing to do with it I I told you
[1:09:04] the other day I've got a friend of mine
[1:09:05] up in New Brunswick brother Ivan Carr
[1:09:07] his son-in-law just sent me a picture of
[1:09:09] him this last week 95 years old at his
[1:09:12] 95th birthday and he still preaches
[1:09:14] twice a week and he's like a little fire
[1:09:16] brand well I tell you what I think we
[1:09:18] ought to do everything we can do as long
[1:09:21] God gives us the strength and the
[1:09:22] ability to do it well if that brother
[1:09:25] can do that at 95 what about some of you
[1:09:27] young men that's 25 or 18 or 17 we ought
[1:09:30] to be doing what God has called us to do
[1:09:34] and the church said now watch this is
[1:09:37] where many people you know they just get
[1:09:39] started and they never go any farther
[1:09:42] but watch how the prophet when he lays
[1:09:43] this out he said now a lot of people go
[1:09:45] up to the Altar and pray and say Lord
[1:09:47] forgive me and a great experience of
[1:09:49] sanctification come upon them and then
[1:09:52] things you have a great time you get up
[1:09:54] at the altar couting now look at what it
[1:09:56] can do a person gets saved they get
[1:09:59] Sanctified my boy them them old things a
[1:10:02] lot of them evil wicked things it just
[1:10:04] goes away from them and they feel like
[1:10:06] such a new person that they think why do
[1:10:08] I need anything else and that's where
[1:10:10] Satan deceives them and they saying I I
[1:10:13] I don't have to go any farther you're
[1:10:15] just getting
[1:10:16] started now what's in you have a great
[1:10:18] time up the altar shout and you go back
[1:10:20] and say bless God I got it no you just
[1:10:23] started to a place where you you can
[1:10:25] grow you ain't done nothing yet see the
[1:10:29] only thing you've done is just laid the
[1:10:31] foundation now what is the foundation
[1:10:33] that Peter talked about faith so the
[1:10:35] foundation is If any man will come to
[1:10:38] God he must first believe that he is and
[1:10:40] that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:10:42] diligently seek Him for by grace through
[1:10:45] faith are you saved not of yourselves
[1:10:48] lest any man should boast but it is a
[1:10:51] gift of God Paul goes on to say that God
[1:10:54] has given to every every man The Measure
[1:10:57] of Faith so here is this small Measure
[1:10:59] of Faith by which people are given as
[1:11:02] sinners now think about it if God had
[1:11:04] not given that to the unconverted heart
[1:11:07] they wouldn't even have the capability
[1:11:09] to receive him as their savior
[1:11:12] supernaturally God started moving in you
[1:11:15] before you come to that place of
[1:11:17] repentance and you start say I'm sorry
[1:11:19] for this I'm sorry for that I'm sorry
[1:11:21] for that God offered you the measure of
[1:11:24] faith that measure of faith is a very
[1:11:27] tiny small measure but it's just enough
[1:11:30] to get you saved then after you get
[1:11:32] saved if you will allow God God will
[1:11:35] continue to let Faith grow and faith
[1:11:39] will grow until it reaches and covers
[1:11:42] the first level of everything you need
[1:11:44] the getting saved faith is not enough
[1:11:47] Faith to lead you to Virtue then getting
[1:11:50] virtue on just the beginning
[1:11:52] introduction of virtue is not enough to
[1:11:55] lead you to Godly knowledge but faith
[1:11:57] wants to grow wants to start out in this
[1:12:00] small small measure and then what will
[1:12:02] it will do set like this it'll start out
[1:12:04] in the middle of the base of the pyramid
[1:12:06] and you believe oh thank you Lord I'm
[1:12:08] saved praise God God saved me I believe
[1:12:11] there's a God I believe with all of my
[1:12:12] heart there's a god well don't try to
[1:12:14] start getting for virtue yet but let
[1:12:17] your faith grow out and expand over the
[1:12:20] whole First Foundation level and then it
[1:12:23] will cover not only shall ation but
[1:12:25] healing Deliverance peace power
[1:12:28] Revelation you're laying your whole
[1:12:30] foundation with faith so your faith
[1:12:33] grows grows grows grows grows until it
[1:12:36] goes from one side of the foundation to
[1:12:38] the other your entire first layer is
[1:12:41] engulfed with faith so it grows from the
[1:12:44] tiny start out measure till it's
[1:12:46] complete coverage you understand now a
[1:12:49] lot of people they stop there so they
[1:12:51] get enough Faith to believe God they got
[1:12:53] their whole CER oh my they're just so
[1:12:55] happy they're so in love with God and
[1:12:58] the first battle comes and they say well
[1:13:00] what happened I I don't understand I
[1:13:02] felt so good for the first week I felt
[1:13:05] so wonderful now I don't understand
[1:13:08] their faith is being
[1:13:10] tried and if they'll allow it God will
[1:13:13] try their faith and let their faith
[1:13:15] expand from side to side then that faith
[1:13:19] will cover everything that they need in
[1:13:22] The Measure of Faith itself and the
[1:13:24] church said amen now watch he said it
[1:13:27] laid the foundation but you're going to
[1:13:29] build a house you pour the foundation
[1:13:31] and say boy I got her yeah you've got
[1:13:34] the foundation to build your house on
[1:13:36] but you've got to build the house now
[1:13:39] that's where the thing comes in this
[1:13:40] morning we're going to talk about a
[1:13:42] house this Foundation First what is the
[1:13:44] foundation of Christianity he says faith
[1:13:47] in the word of God that's your
[1:13:49] foundation then you begin to grow then
[1:13:52] you start so you begin to add to this
[1:13:56] Foundation now building a house you
[1:13:59] might put up your uprights which is your
[1:14:00] walls your tube floors and so on and
[1:14:03] everything else brother wood some of the
[1:14:05] other Carpenters or contractors could
[1:14:06] tell you how to build your house but I'm
[1:14:09] going to tell you how to build your
[1:14:11] spiritual house where God can dwell now
[1:14:15] this is what we're interested in right
[1:14:17] let me tell you you know y'all ought to
[1:14:19] be really really glad that I was not the
[1:14:22] contractor on this new church here you
[1:14:24] ought to be really really glad that I
[1:14:27] was not the one that built up these
[1:14:29] frames and these side walls and I'm the
[1:14:31] one who calls all this up here you ought
[1:14:33] to be so happy today cuz every time you
[1:14:36] come in here if I was in charge of it
[1:14:38] all I can tell you you'd be nervous and
[1:14:40] you know who'd be more nervous than you
[1:14:42] I would because I don't know the first
[1:14:45] thing about how to do that now I can
[1:14:47] finish wood I can lay stone there's
[1:14:49] certain things I can do but there's
[1:14:51] things I've got enough sense to know
[1:14:54] it's beyond my capability and that's
[1:14:56] what we need to learn ourselves about
[1:14:58] salvation we don't know how to get saved
[1:15:01] we don't know how to please God within
[1:15:03] ourself we need to commit that part to
[1:15:06] him and then let him teach us how to do
[1:15:09] what we can do ourselves and the church
[1:15:12] said so once that happens and we begin
[1:15:15] to add to the foundation now it goes on
[1:15:17] to say here you are seven Church ages
[1:15:20] seven steps God building his church like
[1:15:23] one person into an individual into
[1:15:27] himself the glory the power of God
[1:15:30] coming down through this welding This
[1:15:33] Together therefore the Pentecostal
[1:15:36] people has let out the Lutheran and the
[1:15:39] wesli and things and doesn't know what
[1:15:41] they're talking about you see they lived
[1:15:43] in this part of the temple that's why
[1:15:45] we're waiting for the resurrection
[1:15:47] Luther's age is waiting on us the
[1:15:51] Pentecostal age is waiting on us arenus
[1:15:55] Paul Columba they are waiting on us God
[1:15:59] having provided some better thing for us
[1:16:02] but there's a genuine part of that that
[1:16:05] keeps making that building come on I
[1:16:07] will restore saith the Lord in the
[1:16:10] evening time it shall be light that's
[1:16:13] when listen this comes Christ the Holy
[1:16:16] Spirit Jesus comes down and sets himself
[1:16:21] at the head of the church then he will
[1:16:24] res resurrect this church being his own
[1:16:29] body in there the body the way God is
[1:16:33] expecting us as an individual now this
[1:16:36] is what God wants for every man woman
[1:16:39] boy and girl and this is what he's
[1:16:41] requiring to be in the church agent
[1:16:44] brother Donnie will everybody in our
[1:16:45] church get it I hope they do God's the
[1:16:48] only one that knows if they will or they
[1:16:49] won't but no doubt there's been people
[1:16:52] among us that have set Among Us and 's
[1:16:54] gone by
[1:16:55] and they may be there and they may not
[1:16:57] and there will be people that have set
[1:16:58] in churches all down through time but
[1:17:01] remember there is no such thing as a
[1:17:04] Holy Ghost Church by that I mean that
[1:17:08] you go to this one church and you say
[1:17:10] everybody there Saints everybody there
[1:17:14] is elect everybody there's got the Holy
[1:17:16] Ghost the prophet tells us there is no
[1:17:18] such a thing there is no such a thing
[1:17:20] and yet that's what organization tries
[1:17:22] to do they want to make everybody then
[1:17:25] that's a part of that move then that's
[1:17:27] them you know if we're not careful we do
[1:17:29] the exact same thing so everybody then
[1:17:31] that believes our ideology and our
[1:17:33] doctrine that makes them bride ain't
[1:17:35] none of us can make nobody bride God is
[1:17:37] the one who does that and God
[1:17:40] Alone now remember in this place today
[1:17:43] are people with the Holy Ghost in This
[1:17:45] Place today are people who ain't got the
[1:17:47] Holy Ghost in This Place today may be
[1:17:50] people that don't even believe in the
[1:17:51] Holy Ghost so everybody here or you say
[1:17:54] a word Word of Life Church is a Holy
[1:17:56] Ghost Church no it's not there's people
[1:17:58] in Word of Life Church who believe in
[1:18:00] the Holy Ghost and who have the Holy
[1:18:03] Ghost but just because you come here
[1:18:05] does not mean that you have the Holy
[1:18:08] Ghost you've got to be in Christ Jesus
[1:18:12] yourself you have got to have an
[1:18:14] experience young people you have got to
[1:18:16] have an experience older people that you
[1:18:19] are born again that you know that you
[1:18:23] know that you know amen amen now watch
[1:18:26] then he will bring the individuals
[1:18:29] together and we are baptized
[1:18:32] individually in to make this Collective
[1:18:35] body watch again he said see these
[1:18:37] fellas wasn't required what these fellas
[1:18:40] was now remember he's got the pyramid
[1:18:42] there and he's got the names of the
[1:18:44] church ages the names of The Messengers
[1:18:46] and then the virtues so he's he's
[1:18:48] pointing out that what was required of
[1:18:51] one wasn't required of the other but it
[1:18:53] just so happens you're living at the
[1:18:54] very tough guess what's required of you
[1:18:57] everything amen everything you say I
[1:19:00] can't do it I know you can't and I can't
[1:19:04] either I've done come to the spot I've
[1:19:06] quit trying on my own the thing ain't me
[1:19:09] trying to do this and trying to do that
[1:19:11] it's me get out of the way and surrender
[1:19:14] and let the spirit of God help you say
[1:19:16] Brother Don it's too hard I know it is
[1:19:18] he made it that way he made it that way
[1:19:21] so it would absolutely oh my deny deny
[1:19:25] us of the capability of bringing to pass
[1:19:29] God's word in our life you say it's too
[1:19:31] hard it's too hard for me too but he
[1:19:34] don't want you and I trying to be this
[1:19:36] and trying to be that he wants to commit
[1:19:39] us himself and live his own life out of
[1:19:43] us oh my that's where too many people
[1:19:46] have failed and that's What Hurts The
[1:19:48] Gospel is people seeing people that they
[1:19:51] tried to do right and wind up being a
[1:19:53] hypocrite and say well my good I know
[1:19:55] that person and they go to church you
[1:19:57] ought to see them they do this and that
[1:19:59] and the other and they lie and they
[1:20:00] cheat and they steal Don't Judge Me by
[1:20:03] somebody like that I don't lie cheat and
[1:20:05] steal neither does the body of Christ
[1:20:07] come on somebody but yet people are
[1:20:09] trying to do it and it's one of the
[1:20:12] greatest stumbling blocks that people
[1:20:14] see is somebody who goes to church that
[1:20:16] lives like a devil
[1:20:18] am woo come on Lord say Amen church amen
[1:20:22] now watch what's the requirement of us
[1:20:25] was not required in the days of arenus
[1:20:29] now he brought his church up the same
[1:20:31] way the same way then Peter says first
[1:20:34] these seven things Faith virtue see
[1:20:36] coming up knowledge Temperance patience
[1:20:39] godliness brotherly love and brotherly
[1:20:42] kindness and then the love of God Christ
[1:20:44] in the person of the Holy Ghost comes
[1:20:48] upon you in the true
[1:20:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:55] and you got all these virtues sealed in
[1:20:57] you oh my then God lives in a tabernacle
[1:21:01] called the building the living
[1:21:04] Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling
[1:21:08] Place when a man
[1:21:11] possesses these kind of things then the
[1:21:14] Holy Ghost comes upon him
[1:21:19] listen when you and I grow into this
[1:21:22] full stature
[1:21:24] the same holy ghost that burst us will
[1:21:29] cap or
[1:21:31] finish us and when it caps us he'll cap
[1:21:36] off the
[1:21:38] ages thank you Lord
[1:21:40] God you might speak with tongues you
[1:21:43] might impersonate any gift that God's
[1:21:45] Got You might do that but until these
[1:21:49] virtues here go into you you're still
[1:21:54] off the real true foundation of faith we
[1:21:57] believe in speaking in tongues Here We
[1:22:00] Believe signs wonders Miracles yep we
[1:22:03] believe the supernatural power of God my
[1:22:05] goodness friend we've seen God do so
[1:22:07] many things oh it it would be it would
[1:22:10] be devastating if we didn't believe he
[1:22:11] could do such stuff we do believe that
[1:22:14] but we also want to focus not on that
[1:22:18] but focus on this being inside of us now
[1:22:22] notice when these virtues grow in as you
[1:22:25] added to that then you are a living
[1:22:28] Monument you are a living moving Idol
[1:22:33] but when we not an imaginary way proster
[1:22:36] ourselves before Living God a living
[1:22:39] virtue a living knowledge a living
[1:22:42] patience a living godliness a living
[1:22:45] power coming by the Living God makes a
[1:22:49] living man a living image
[1:22:54] the statue of God see how these virtues
[1:22:57] these building materials typed in with
[1:23:00] the church
[1:23:01] Messengers with the church
[1:23:05] ages so a living faith a living virtue a
[1:23:09] living knowledge how is it living
[1:23:12] actually because it comes from the
[1:23:14] living presence of the Living God now we
[1:23:17] put the blood of Jesus Christ in that
[1:23:20] brings the
[1:23:22] faith of Jesus Christ
[1:23:25] I don't just want my
[1:23:28] face I don't just want my
[1:23:31] virtue I have to have more than my own
[1:23:36] virtue I'm called to minister to so many
[1:23:40] people from around the
[1:23:42] world my virtue will run out before
[1:23:47] Sunday
[1:23:48] evening and today is Sunday
[1:23:51] evening yours will run out but I need a
[1:23:56] virtue that is
[1:23:58] unlimited I need a virtue when I feel
[1:24:01] like I don't have enough strengths to
[1:24:04] answer another phone call or answer
[1:24:06] another email or have another interview
[1:24:10] and I think God I can't do it my throat
[1:24:11] is so sore Lord I'm so weak from talking
[1:24:15] to people you know what it's like when
[1:24:17] you talk to people and they pulled and
[1:24:18] pulled and Pull and and you're talking
[1:24:21] to them and the spirit of God comes down
[1:24:22] in the office there and you're
[1:24:24] ministering to people in strength is
[1:24:26] leaving you don't think that Christian's
[1:24:28] only place to give out is sh in the
[1:24:30] church many of you are called not only
[1:24:33] to give out virtue and and in church
[1:24:36] alone but on your job in the place where
[1:24:39] you're at maybe to people who do not
[1:24:41] know and understand what you know and
[1:24:44] God will allow you to minister or you
[1:24:46] say you mean we're supposed to have
[1:24:47] virtue to people beyond our own belief
[1:24:50] God's Prophet said the entire world
[1:24:54] amen praise be to God hallelujah
[1:25:00] hallelujah so when you put the blood of
[1:25:02] Jesus Christ in that brings the
[1:25:06] faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of
[1:25:11] Jesus Christ the
[1:25:15] knowledge well then how can I add the
[1:25:17] faith of Jesus Christ how can I add the
[1:25:20] virtue of Jesus how can I add the
[1:25:22] knowledge of Jesus
[1:25:26] how can I add
[1:25:27] it all I can do is submit and see my
[1:25:31] need first of all and open my being and
[1:25:35] say God please please let your virtue
[1:25:39] flow out of me let your faith have you
[1:25:42] ever got to a spot that it seemed like
[1:25:44] your faith just wouldn't meet the
[1:25:46] challenge of the hour and all of a
[1:25:48] sudden something from somewhere come and
[1:25:51] your faith is just like your faith got
[1:25:53] muscles don't you understand that wasn't
[1:25:55] your faith Jesus put his own muscles on
[1:25:57] your little old puny Faith Oh Glory to
[1:25:59] God and the spirit of God was Able by
[1:26:02] that Faith to meet that need that you
[1:26:04] Haden it's the same with the knowledge
[1:26:07] of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus
[1:26:09] Christ the patience of Jesus Christ oh
[1:26:12] my the godliness of Jesus Christ the
[1:26:15] brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and
[1:26:18] the love of God which is Jesus
[1:26:22] Christ and so I'm I'm just fed up with
[1:26:25] people I I I've had so much deal with
[1:26:27] people I just can't take it no
[1:26:29] more my brotherly kindness is run
[1:26:34] out
[1:26:37] on you need
[1:26:40] his anybody honest enough here today to
[1:26:43] say mine's run out with people before
[1:26:46] you ever get tired of fooding with
[1:26:47] people I mean just say that's it I'm
[1:26:50] just going to start fellowshipping with
[1:26:51] Hogs and dogs and jack rabbits and you
[1:26:54] know know uh ostriches and elephants and
[1:26:56] all that sort of thing I'm fed up with
[1:26:58] people I'm just tired of people people
[1:27:00] just churchy people lie people do this
[1:27:02] people do that and the other but
[1:27:04] remember it ain't that jack rabbit out
[1:27:06] there that you're sent to convert it
[1:27:08] ain't that ostrich it ain't that
[1:27:09] elephant it ain't this and that it's not
[1:27:11] that it's Humanity it's Humanity they're
[1:27:14] the ones that need light they're the
[1:27:17] ones that need forgiveness you can't
[1:27:19] forgive a jack rabbit my goodness you
[1:27:20] can't forgive an ostrich you've got to
[1:27:22] be able to let God man EST himself
[1:27:25] through you who you say I can't do it's
[1:27:27] totally impossible exactly right it's
[1:27:29] totally impossible for me too but it
[1:27:32] ain't totally impossible for my Jesus if
[1:27:35] my faith runs out there's been times my
[1:27:37] faith felt like I had no more
[1:27:41] left but all of a sudden I felt a surge
[1:27:44] run through me like I don't know what
[1:27:46] what was it the faith of Jesus
[1:27:48] Christ and my virtue Brothers y see like
[1:27:51] it was totally gone oh my and all of us
[1:27:54] sudden a surge don't you understand
[1:27:55] that's what wears a minister out when
[1:27:57] he's praying for people hundreds and
[1:27:59] hundreds of people you imagine brother
[1:28:01] David's holl was over I think it was IND
[1:28:03] here not long ago and had a prayer line
[1:28:05] 12500 people one man of God running
[1:28:08] through a prayer line how in the world
[1:28:10] is that even physically possible y'all
[1:28:12] know how Brother David prays M when he
[1:28:14] prays for people he gives everything
[1:28:16] he's got it's like there ain't nobody
[1:28:17] else in that pray line but that first
[1:28:19] person and he prays with everything how
[1:28:21] was he able to continue so the face of
[1:28:24] Jesus Christ led to the virtue of Jesus
[1:28:27] Christ amen oh thank you Lord thank you
[1:28:31] Lord there is the
[1:28:35] perfect man of
[1:28:38] God when he
[1:28:43] possesses these
[1:28:46] virtues he still working on me
[1:28:54] Amen to make
[1:28:56] you what you ought to be some of you
[1:28:59] won't say it for you but I'll say it for
[1:29:03] you now let's go back again to Second
[1:29:05] Peter chapter 1 verse5 and beside this
[1:29:09] giving all diligence add to your Faith's
[1:29:14] virtue now when the prophet preaches
[1:29:16] this he starts out and he said now the
[1:29:18] first thing that you must be born again
[1:29:21] and when you're born again you can't be
[1:29:22] born again without having faith
[1:29:25] and you've got to be born again and it
[1:29:26] produces faith and after you get Faith
[1:29:30] this right here he spells it out Faith
[1:29:32] then you're just in position of
[1:29:38] growing and
[1:29:40] remember as we go in God we grow in our
[1:29:46] understanding Peter didn't understand at
[1:29:49] all when he first got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:50] neither to James nor Paul neither will
[1:29:53] you and I on neither did the
[1:29:58] prophets now whenever we look at the new
[1:30:01] births still confusing really to a lot
[1:30:03] of people it's
[1:30:05] sad but many teach and believe that the
[1:30:09] new births is one a sinner will come up
[1:30:11] to the Altar and they'll give their
[1:30:12] heart to God and Lord I'm sorry please
[1:30:15] save me and they say I got born
[1:30:18] again but does that match the
[1:30:21] pattern the first person to preach the
[1:30:23] do of the new births being born again
[1:30:26] under those terms born again was the
[1:30:28] Lord Jesus to Nicodemus and he preached
[1:30:31] it to him man as far as we know that
[1:30:32] never experienced it so he got to
[1:30:35] theology but never had the experience to
[1:30:37] match it so Jesus told him he must to be
[1:30:40] born again and he said how in the world
[1:30:41] me an old man can I enter the second
[1:30:43] time into my mother's woman be born
[1:30:45] again he said if I told you these
[1:30:46] Natural Things of the Earth how can I
[1:30:48] speak to you the spiritual things he
[1:30:49] said except you be born of water and of
[1:30:52] spirit you can not see or understand the
[1:30:55] kingdom of God so Jesus introduced this
[1:30:59] very odd and peculiar Doctrine in the
[1:31:02] New Testament now even the disciples as
[1:31:05] they were there and they have cast out
[1:31:07] Devils they've healed the sick they've
[1:31:08] raised the dead but they were not yet
[1:31:11] converted right According To Jesus Jesus
[1:31:15] told Peter when you are converted
[1:31:18] strengthen your
[1:31:20] brethren so they had cast out Devils
[1:31:22] heal the sick preach the gospel El as
[1:31:24] far as they knew it and all kinds of
[1:31:26] great works that they had done but they
[1:31:27] were not yet born again and they didn't
[1:31:30] get born again until the upper room
[1:31:33] experience now remember where the
[1:31:35] Prophet is during this time frame in
[1:31:38] 1962 when he preaches this that he's at
[1:31:41] that spot of thinking believing
[1:31:44] preaching it as well that the new birth
[1:31:46] is when you accept Christ as your savior
[1:31:49] but let me show you here in sort in the
[1:31:51] token in 63 when this token is on you
[1:31:54] and God has sealed you now we want to
[1:31:56] check ourselves for just a moment when
[1:31:58] God has G you the true baptism of the
[1:32:01] Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus
[1:32:05] Christ is within you now that's true
[1:32:08] every Theologian will have to admit that
[1:32:10] to be true yes sir it's the new
[1:32:17] birth now you can see why that many
[1:32:20] people are LED astray in the age we're
[1:32:21] living in and millions believe they're
[1:32:24] born again when they're not that's right
[1:32:28] they gave the Lord Jesus their heart God
[1:32:30] did something for them as I mentioned
[1:32:31] about the Iranian man a while ago and
[1:32:33] and God really did something for him
[1:32:35] you're not going to tell him that he
[1:32:36] didn't I'm not going to try to tell him
[1:32:38] that he didn't because it certainly
[1:32:39] seemed like a life a life has been
[1:32:41] changed by the power of God but they're
[1:32:43] still not born again until they get the
[1:32:46] Holy
[1:32:48] Ghost amen now what so the true baptism
[1:32:52] of the Holy Spirit then the life of
[1:32:54] Jesus Christ comes within you now that's
[1:32:56] every Theologian have to admit that to
[1:32:58] be true it's the new birth you're born a
[1:33:00] new of the Holy Ghost so there was three
[1:33:04] elements that came out of the body of
[1:33:07] Jesus water blood spirit yes now a
[1:33:13] person believes on the
[1:33:15] blood that's only one of them
[1:33:19] elements so by faith they believe they
[1:33:21] accepted their remittance of of sins by
[1:33:24] the blood of the Lord Jesus and I said
[1:33:26] glory to God I'm born again but now wait
[1:33:29] a minute you just nodded your head that
[1:33:31] there was three
[1:33:33] elements blood water
[1:33:36] spirit so where is the other in the new
[1:33:39] birth right of the confessions that are
[1:33:42] made around the world I came to Christ I
[1:33:44] gave Christ my life you've only entered
[1:33:47] in in even in that in a knowledge part
[1:33:50] that you've accepted the
[1:33:52] blood what about the spirit that went
[1:33:55] out of him yes what about the water in
[1:33:58] tight by the washing of the water of the
[1:33:59] word and Jesus told Nicodemus and tying
[1:34:02] the the two scriptures together that a
[1:34:04] man must be born of water and of
[1:34:07] spirit praise the
[1:34:10] Lord now think whenever people are being
[1:34:14] taught this this is one reason why they
[1:34:16] go no
[1:34:18] farther what's this in question aners I
[1:34:21] love this analogy it is so so simple yet
[1:34:24] so profound if the natural birth
[1:34:27] requires water blood and spirit does not
[1:34:29] the spiritual birth require all three
[1:34:32] stages of grace before the person is
[1:34:35] truly born again that's right oh
[1:34:39] my I love this one word
[1:34:41] reply
[1:34:44] absolutely but thank God it didn't stop
[1:34:46] there I just explained that this morning
[1:34:49] on the same thing you've got to have all
[1:34:51] stages you're begotten of the spirit
[1:34:54] just like a baby's begotten in the womb
[1:34:56] of a mother but not born until they
[1:35:00] receive the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:35:03] you're not born then you're not
[1:35:05] converted you're in the
[1:35:07] procession of being converted until that
[1:35:11] time friends this is I I've told you for
[1:35:14] years and years this is a great
[1:35:16] shortcoming Even in our own
[1:35:18] ranks that people get a life that has
[1:35:20] been changed and this drops off of them
[1:35:23] and that drop off of it if you ever get
[1:35:25] sealed by the holy ghost in your soul
[1:35:27] you'll never backslide again oh I got
[1:35:30] saved and then I went back out I got
[1:35:32] saved again how many times do you get
[1:35:33] saved my goodness we got saved and
[1:35:35] resaved and re resaved and re re re re
[1:35:39] resaved no if you ever get it once and
[1:35:41] get it in the right spot you're saved
[1:35:44] forever that's the kind of eternal
[1:35:46] security the Bible teaches that's right
[1:35:49] now watch you're born then you're not
[1:35:52] converted you're in the process that's
[1:35:54] the reason that all these great
[1:35:55] Mysteries could not be given to Luther
[1:35:58] not be given to Wes it could not be
[1:36:00] given to the age of just passed by us
[1:36:02] the Pentecostal age why it wasn't time
[1:36:05] they were
[1:36:11] begotten now in reality friends the
[1:36:14] Luther ages never produce the new
[1:36:18] birth of
[1:36:21] Ephesus Wesley never PR prod the new
[1:36:25] birth of what Acts 2 did it was a
[1:36:28] portion of the spirit like the Iranian
[1:36:30] man that got a real experience with
[1:36:35] God but it would leave Luther in that
[1:36:38] stage where he could still drink beer
[1:36:41] smoke his pipe feel no
[1:36:45] conviction you think Paul smoked the
[1:36:47] pipe wonder what wonder what brand Paul
[1:36:49] smoked
[1:36:53] their experience would have never
[1:36:55] allowed them to do such was it a portion
[1:36:58] of the spirit of God
[1:37:00] yes but did it convert their
[1:37:05] souls
[1:37:08] no you see were it not for the message
[1:37:11] of God for the day they lived in there
[1:37:15] wouldn't even be a
[1:37:17] body from Ephesus to Omega
[1:37:23] don't you understand the grace of God if
[1:37:28] only the true born again through the
[1:37:30] church Ages were allocated to being the
[1:37:34] bride there would only be that Remnant
[1:37:37] in the first age and that Remnant in the
[1:37:42] last but the life was moving up through
[1:37:44] the
[1:37:45] cornstock the life was moving up to them
[1:37:48] they had all they could get in that day
[1:37:51] remember when he preaches about the
[1:37:52] seals and he said now I'll set this box
[1:37:55] here and that'll represent the anointing
[1:37:58] that they had to work under that's all
[1:38:00] that God released in the days of Luther
[1:38:04] that's all God released in the days of
[1:38:06] Wesley that's all God released oh my to
[1:38:10] the Le to see and Pentecostal age but in
[1:38:13] the last days he's released more praise
[1:38:18] be to God that's why we will never be
[1:38:20] able to go in under the concept of what
[1:38:23] they had wow we'll be held accountable
[1:38:26] for more there's more here now there's
[1:38:29] more here word of life than just going
[1:38:32] to church and being a pretty good member
[1:38:34] that won't work
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:38] today oh
[1:38:41] my Lord
[1:38:43] Jesus they were
[1:38:47] begotten listen at the
[1:38:49] difference now the person of Christ him
[1:38:55] himself the son of
[1:38:58] man you
[1:39:02] understand revealing himself in human
[1:39:07] flesh it could not have
[1:39:11] come till
[1:39:16] now we have arrived
[1:39:21] amen praise God
[1:39:29] watch if in the Samaran Church days I
[1:39:31] want to tell you exactly he talking
[1:39:33] about him making the alar calls out in
[1:39:35] his meetings and whenever he would
[1:39:37] invite the Sinners to come and he would
[1:39:39] invite them to come and receive the Holy
[1:39:41] Ghost and just to save a little bit of
[1:39:43] time he said that the Pentecostal people
[1:39:46] would think he was inviting them to come
[1:39:47] and speak in tongues and all that but
[1:39:50] notice what he said I want to tell you
[1:39:51] exactly what I mean I mean for this
[1:39:53] sinner to come forward and be born again
[1:39:56] which is to be baptized into the body of
[1:39:59] Christ by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:40:01] exactly what took place at Pentecost
[1:40:03] when the church was launched in other
[1:40:06] words to be born of the spirit is to be
[1:40:09] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is
[1:40:14] one and the
[1:40:17] same to receive Christ is to receive his
[1:40:20] Spirit to receive his spirit is to be
[1:40:23] born born again to receive his spirit is
[1:40:25] to be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:31] amen question answers again if you're
[1:40:34] born a
[1:40:36] normal human being I listen this great
[1:40:39] Theologian that graduated from Harvard
[1:40:43] and from the minat University and from
[1:40:45] the Church of God University and listen
[1:40:47] how he's going to express this deep
[1:40:49] theology
[1:40:50] now if you're born a normal human being
[1:40:54] you will actually do the things a normal
[1:40:57] human being would
[1:41:00] do yes sir which lets me know a lot of
[1:41:03] the folks that apparently born in this
[1:41:05] day ain't normal human
[1:41:09] beings they ain't
[1:41:11] normal they're not doing things normal
[1:41:13] human beings
[1:41:17] do men Carol went to eat lunch yesterday
[1:41:20] and we saw this thing
[1:41:25] in the restaurant waiting on
[1:41:27] people it was born a
[1:41:30] boy but it wanted to be a
[1:41:33] girl it had long
[1:41:36] fingernails had a big old throw all
[1:41:38] stuck out
[1:41:40] everywhere acting like a girl talking
[1:41:44] like a
[1:41:45] girl but Carol said I want you to notice
[1:41:48] it said if that was a real
[1:41:51] girl it wouldn't have to put put it
[1:41:55] on I mean it was so over top trying to
[1:41:59] be a girl it's over the top trying to be
[1:42:02] a girl let you know it wasn't a
[1:42:05] girl cuz you see a girl would have just
[1:42:08] acted like an
[1:42:10] elephant no a girl would have acted like
[1:42:14] a dog a girl would have a real girl
[1:42:17] would have acted like a girl but this
[1:42:19] wanted to be a girl but it wasn't a girl
[1:42:21] but it wanted to be a girl feel bad and
[1:42:24] as I sat there and looked at it I
[1:42:26] thought yeah that's the way it is with
[1:42:28] with the many so-called Christians they
[1:42:30] try to act like one so bad they're
[1:42:33] trying to act like they're spiritual
[1:42:35] trying to act like they're holy you know
[1:42:37] what if you're a normal human being
[1:42:40] you're going to act like a normal human
[1:42:42] being you're not going to eat SLO out of
[1:42:45] the pig trough you're not going to climb
[1:42:47] a tree like a monkey and beat your chest
[1:42:50] and scream on a grape vine like tars and
[1:42:52] I did when I was a younger but only
[1:42:54] because of the influence of Television
[1:42:56] but you're going to act like a normal
[1:42:58] human being you're going to talk like
[1:43:00] one you're going to sleep like one and
[1:43:02] you're going to marry like a human
[1:43:11] being when you're born a human the
[1:43:13] natural traits of a human being will
[1:43:15] follow
[1:43:16] you you won't live in a
[1:43:21] tree and try TR to fly with your wings
[1:43:24] like a
[1:43:26] bird that isn't wouldn't be normal human
[1:43:29] being the normal actions of a human
[1:43:31] being the normal action of a human being
[1:43:34] would be to
[1:43:36] work
[1:43:38] marry have
[1:43:41] family and if you marri the right gender
[1:43:43] you can
[1:43:45] procreate of course if two men get
[1:43:47] married they can't do that or two women
[1:43:49] oh brother Donnie you're going to get a
[1:43:51] skill praise God Bring It On I say
[1:43:53] you're looking at a man today that's not
[1:43:55] called to compromise I'm not called to
[1:43:58] compromise the Le AA I'm trying to get
[1:44:00] you all out of here I'm trying to get
[1:44:02] you out of here we don't fit in this
[1:44:05] world this world is not our home I'm
[1:44:09] sick of it oh my and the Darkness is
[1:44:11] moving upon the Earth it may move upon
[1:44:14] the Earth but it ain't going to move
[1:44:15] inside the walls of this church it ain't
[1:44:18] going to move inside our lives and our
[1:44:20] homes
[1:44:30] that's natural normal human beings
[1:44:34] because you're born that now look at
[1:44:36] that all that spread of the
[1:44:38] analogy then when you're a born a
[1:44:43] Christian born of the spirit of God you
[1:44:48] naturally take up the
[1:44:51] attributes of
[1:44:56] ofr well why is it we found so much
[1:45:00] struggle why is it that people act like
[1:45:03] Christianity it's just nearly
[1:45:06] impossible is it impossible for you to
[1:45:09] eat human food I mean certain food I
[1:45:11] understand broccoli God never made that
[1:45:13] stff to eat by a human that's pig food
[1:45:15] or
[1:45:19] something it's normal y'all going to go
[1:45:22] out at your you going to eat you're
[1:45:23] going to stop at the nearest hog
[1:45:27] trough there some squirrels at my house
[1:45:29] this morning there out digging around
[1:45:31] you know you're going to do that you you
[1:45:33] humans going to dig up for a few ACR
[1:45:35] that you buried in the
[1:45:36] fall you're going to eat human food it's
[1:45:40] that hard when you get in the car oh
[1:45:42] this is so hard this is so stressful we
[1:45:45] got to go to a restaurant to eat oh no
[1:45:48] I'm about to freak out oh this is so
[1:45:50] awful
[1:45:56] you go in and you start and you look
[1:45:58] over at her and say where you want to
[1:46:01] go and she looks back at you and say
[1:46:04] where do you want to
[1:46:06] go and you look back and say it don't
[1:46:09] matter where do you want to
[1:46:11] go and then she looks back and said it
[1:46:13] don't matter and then you say what about
[1:46:15] this you know I don't like
[1:46:18] that so it does matter after all quit
[1:46:21] lying
[1:46:28] what is that normal human
[1:46:31] behavior you want me to tell you what
[1:46:33] Godly behavior is if you're filled with
[1:46:36] the Holy Ghost and people hurt you and
[1:46:39] they let you down and they disappoint
[1:46:40] you and they lie on
[1:46:43] you just as normal as it is for you to
[1:46:46] get in your car and go to a restaurant
[1:46:48] to eat as a child of God born by the
[1:46:52] Breath of God
[1:46:53] it can be just that easy for you to say
[1:46:57] father forgive
[1:47:06] them now guess the reality check is this
[1:47:10] why is it we struggle so hard with
[1:47:13] Christ
[1:47:14] attributes when human attributes are
[1:47:16] just as easy as they can
[1:47:18] be I mean it's just just like falling
[1:47:21] out of bed I mean you get up and you
[1:47:24] just fall right out well I'm a human
[1:47:25] today wow I was a tater yesterday as a
[1:47:27] carrot the day before today I'm I'm a
[1:47:29] human wow so you just do what humans do
[1:47:33] you go where humans go you like what
[1:47:35] humans
[1:47:39] like so if a man woman boy or girl is
[1:47:42] born by the breath of almighty
[1:47:46] God you see in the Book of John when
[1:47:48] Jesus had gathered there together after
[1:47:52] his resurrection
[1:47:55] and the Bible
[1:47:57] says he breathed on
[1:48:02] them and said receive
[1:48:06] ye the Holy
[1:48:12] Ghost I find that absolutely
[1:48:15] overwhelming because he breathed and he
[1:48:18] said it but it didn't happen for several
[1:48:21] weeks later
[1:48:23] yes so the Breath of God was
[1:48:26] circumvented by the present
[1:48:29] circumstances cuz they was in no
[1:48:31] condition to receive the Breath of God
[1:48:34] yet so they go to the upper room and
[1:48:37] there they stay and they stay and they
[1:48:38] stay and all of a sudden there came a
[1:48:41] sound as of a rushing Mighty
[1:48:43] Wind am from Heaven what was it same
[1:48:47] breath of God that breathed on them
[1:48:48] weeks before don't you understand Church
[1:48:51] the Breath of God has been breathing
[1:48:52] brething on some of you all for years
[1:48:55] the Breath of God you've come here
[1:48:56] service after service and the Breath of
[1:48:58] God has been BR Hallelujah the Breath of
[1:49:01] God has been breathing on you receive my
[1:49:04] life let me f you let me seal you let me
[1:49:07] come into you and take over let me give
[1:49:11] you my attributes and you'll no longer
[1:49:16] struggle at the end of the service you
[1:49:19] kind of hold on a little bit lord I
[1:49:20] can't let that go I can't let that go I
[1:49:23] can't let that go and the Breath of God
[1:49:28] just goes right over you amen oh Lord
[1:49:35] God I wonder what could happen in this
[1:49:37] place
[1:49:40] today if every person who does not have
[1:49:43] the Holy
[1:49:44] Ghost but yet is ordain to receive it
[1:49:56] and the Breath of God is here oh yeah
[1:49:59] he's
[1:50:01] here if it comes by your seat
[1:50:05] today will you be able to open your
[1:50:08] soul and be a
[1:50:11] recipient of the Breath of
[1:50:16] God then when you are born of the spirit
[1:50:19] of
[1:50:21] God as you were with you were born a
[1:50:23] human and you had all these traits and
[1:50:26] characteristics for those of you that
[1:50:27] had children and grandchildren and you
[1:50:29] start watching them you can see many of
[1:50:31] them they were little bitty T90
[1:50:34] things I remember my children my
[1:50:36] grandchildren different things about
[1:50:38] them how that they growed up I remember
[1:50:40] little Leah she used to be the biggest
[1:50:42] powder to be so little you ever seen in
[1:50:44] your life boy she didn't get what she
[1:50:47] want we had a foot stool in the living
[1:50:49] room and she'd come in like this and
[1:50:51] she'd laid down right
[1:50:57] like she'd pout and pout I mean she
[1:50:59] never throw temper fits or nothing like
[1:51:01] that there's something in her there
[1:51:04] coming out little Ash when she was a
[1:51:06] little bitty old Curly top boy she was
[1:51:09] so Brazen and bold and she was over at
[1:51:11] our house one time and she her and
[1:51:13] Grammy was coming upstairs and I had
[1:51:15] Taxidermy mounts places you know everywh
[1:51:17] and she come up there and she said
[1:51:18] Grammy I'm not afraid of nothing
[1:51:23] and I thought I'm going to fix
[1:51:27] that so I hid and whenever I hid her and
[1:51:31] Grammy come up to the tops of the step
[1:51:33] and I jumped out of there and yell like
[1:51:35] a screaming Heathen and I said to the
[1:51:38] top of her voice but there was something
[1:51:41] in her as a little child something in
[1:51:44] you as a little child and whenever we're
[1:51:46] born of the Breath of God it's not like
[1:51:48] we're immediately full born and full
[1:51:51] grown we're just in the stage of our
[1:51:53] uprights being put up and growing and
[1:51:56] formed and oh my taking on the image of
[1:51:59] God aren't you glad he's patient with us
[1:52:02] as his children some of you sitting here
[1:52:05] you've had the Holy Ghost for years and
[1:52:06] years and you know within yourself you
[1:52:09] need more of these virtues in your life
[1:52:11] is that right and that's what you want
[1:52:14] but don't let you let the devil tell you
[1:52:17] that you ain't got it and you'll never
[1:52:18] have it you need to stand your ground
[1:52:20] and say Satan you're alive fire the same
[1:52:23] God that gave me the Holy Ghost will
[1:52:26] bring me to this stature of a perfect
[1:52:29] man but you've got mistakes yes I've got
[1:52:32] them but I've also got faith and I've
[1:52:34] got virtue and I've got knowledge I've
[1:52:36] got faults but I've got promises I've
[1:52:40] got Redemption I've got forgiveness
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:58] hallelujah oh my you know your
[1:53:02] faith really it's allotted to you by the
[1:53:04] predestination of God but know the
[1:53:06] finished measure that you'll have but it
[1:53:09] really depends on how much faith is
[1:53:10] allotted to you how how high you'll be
[1:53:13] able to rise in the gospel one the nine
[1:53:17] gifts of the Spirit of course is the
[1:53:19] gift of faith I've told you before I
[1:53:21] believe myself brother Daryl that's what
[1:53:23] he has in his in his ministry I mean he
[1:53:25] prays for people and just it's just
[1:53:28] Absolut remarkable you he don't sh that
[1:53:30] much with you he don't he don't tell you
[1:53:32] really all that happens but believe me
[1:53:35] we are blessed to have such a servant of
[1:53:37] God with us and it ain't him we know
[1:53:39] that it's God sure go ahead and thank
[1:53:41] the Lord for it
[1:53:49] amen but for me I went back back to it
[1:53:52] for years the prayer and souls that are
[1:53:56] in prison
[1:53:57] now
[1:53:59] father I pray for every man woman boy
[1:54:03] and
[1:54:04] girl that should help them today to
[1:54:07] understand in the
[1:54:10] capacity that they're ordained to
[1:54:13] understand
[1:54:15] in so I have a capacity and you
[1:54:19] do and I don't want to compare myself to
[1:54:22] you or you to me or you to this one that
[1:54:24] one to that one what I want to do is
[1:54:26] compare myself according to the chart of
[1:54:29] God for my
[1:54:31] life you understand that way I can get a
[1:54:34] better perspective of where I am and
[1:54:37] where I need to be you compare lot you
[1:54:41] look in the New Testament the Bible
[1:54:42] calls rot a righteous man righteous
[1:54:45] compared to
[1:54:47] who not compared to
[1:54:51] Abraham compared to who
[1:54:55] Sodom many Christians have gathered
[1:54:57] around the Tri Cities today compare them
[1:55:00] to Sodom good
[1:55:03] people compared to the
[1:55:10] bride so you and I want to let our lives
[1:55:14] be measured by God's
[1:55:16] chart for
[1:55:19] Donnie what do you want me to be
[1:55:25] Carol told me the other day she said
[1:55:27] Donnie you're called to go through
[1:55:30] things that a lot of people will never
[1:55:32] have to go
[1:55:34] through she said I watched it for lot
[1:55:36] for years you're called to suffer you're
[1:55:40] called to have to deal with
[1:55:43] things a lot of people don't have to
[1:55:45] deal with you think is that
[1:55:50] fair people think well life ain't Fair
[1:55:53] I didn't know we was playing the game
[1:55:54] fair who designed that game called Fair
[1:55:58] anyway and maybe you're called to go
[1:56:00] through things that I'll never go
[1:56:02] through brother friend you're called to
[1:56:03] go through things that I'll never go
[1:56:05] through so if we're constant comparing
[1:56:07] ourselves to this that the other forget
[1:56:10] that God what do you want me to
[1:56:17] be I want my face to be what you've
[1:56:20] called it to be my
[1:56:22] virtue my
[1:56:25] strength when I go
[1:56:27] out Carol I go to the grocery store we
[1:56:30] go to Walmart on the occasion when we
[1:56:32] have
[1:56:35] to whenever I make my yearly visit to
[1:56:38] the
[1:56:40] mall and for the for you people that

[1:57:02] to go up to and say can I pray for
[1:57:07] you I don't do it all the time of course
[1:57:10] but there's just something in my heart I
[1:57:12] can't see
[1:57:14] that I see somebody crying I see them in
[1:57:16] the hospital all the time see somebody
[1:57:18] crying and they've had bad news or

[1:57:33] something that comes with a great
[1:57:36] price it keeps you tore all two
[1:57:39] pieces cuz everywhere you look there's
[1:57:42] hurting people everywhere that's right
[1:57:44] do I wish I wasn't that way no I'm not
[1:57:48] going to say that cuz my father chose me
[1:57:50] for that
[1:57:52] humanly do I wish it was
[1:57:55] less
[1:57:57] yeah let me be honest and
[1:57:59] straightforward with you today I wish I
[1:58:01] was still the
[1:58:04] pastor of the Church of brother Luther's
[1:58:08] Pastor I didn't want to come here years
[1:58:10] ago it was not my desire to come here
[1:58:12] years
[1:58:13] ago and if God would have showed me this
[1:58:16] place right here I'd have probably got a
[1:58:18] butcher knife and cut my throat
[1:58:22] I said there ain't no way there no if
[1:58:24] somebody prophesied that to me I said
[1:58:26] you're anointed of the devil that's a
[1:58:28] lying Spirit on
[1:58:30] you if you would have told me a little
[1:58:35] ignoramus Kentucky
[1:58:37] hillbilly would fly all over the world
[1:58:40] and preach the
[1:58:42] gospel I'd probably said you're
[1:58:45] lying do I like it do I want to go NOP I
[1:58:50] got more invitations in the month of
[1:58:52] January for the year of 25 on over into
[1:58:56] 26 that I've had in years of my
[1:58:59] life come here come there preach here
[1:59:01] preach here come here come there and you
[1:59:03] know where I want to go
[1:59:08] nowhere I like preaching to you all I
[1:59:11] like staying right here I don't want to
[1:59:14] go
[1:59:15] nowhere but then I've got this something
[1:59:18] that I think but Lord do you want me to
[1:59:26] so what and you think oh my everything
[1:59:29] is so easy it's just so easy no I'm
[1:59:31] called to do things I don't want to do
[1:59:34] that's right is that ringing true to the
[1:59:36] rest of you all you all are going to be
[1:59:39] called to have to do things for God yes
[1:59:42] sir that you don't want to do life is
[1:59:45] not filled with pleasures and all of our
[1:59:48] choices and all the things that we want
[1:59:50] to do true yes it's not the way God
[1:59:53] makes his bread amen some are chosen by
[1:59:57] God that he will take their heart and
[2:00:00] break
[2:00:03] it he will break their
[2:00:08] heart and give them strength to endure
[2:00:11] it and they look at other Christians and
[2:00:14] they think how do they get by so
[2:00:17] easy so what do we want to be today Word
[2:00:20] of Life
[2:00:22] Brother Don what do I need to do to come
[2:00:23] here to church what what do I need to
[2:00:24] get a membership who do I see to put my
[2:00:26] name on the book we ain't got no
[2:00:30] book who do I need to talk to how to
[2:00:32] join you can talk to me I can tell you
[2:00:34] it's easy we don't join we're born
[2:00:37] in that's what we
[2:00:41] want and brother Donnie what's the
[2:00:43] ultimate what's the ultimate goal that
[2:00:44] you're trying to get us to reach every
[2:00:46] church has a has a vision I can tell you
[2:00:49] that my vision for for you and for
[2:00:53] myself is to be a house that almighty
[2:00:58] God can live in oh
[2:01:01] yeah and that people can still see God
[2:01:04] as a
[2:01:05] forgiver because not only do they they
[2:01:07] experience it of their sins but they see
[2:01:10] him forgiving through
[2:01:12] me and forgiving through
[2:01:15] you and ministering and
[2:01:19] loving how many he wants that with all
[2:01:21] your heart to do
[2:01:24] come and bow our
[2:01:27] heads God bless you Sint to love you so
[2:01:34] much heavenly father as
[2:01:37] we have our heads bowed today Lord to
[2:01:40] the dust of the Earth from whence we
[2:01:41] were
[2:01:43] taken I pray Lord Jesus that you would
[2:01:47] just move across this place with your
[2:01:49] presence
[2:01:52] Lord as I see myself and I'm getting
[2:01:56] older I see different traits of my
[2:01:58] mama of my
[2:02:00] daddy I'll watch Harry and certain ways
[2:02:04] that he does and I'm sure he watches me
[2:02:06] the same
[2:02:07] way when I get to see my other siblings
[2:02:10] and I look at them and I see traits that
[2:02:13] they're picking up like our family
[2:02:15] members acting like talking like or
[2:02:18] whatever it
[2:02:19] is we don't have to study we don't have
[2:02:22] to get up every
[2:02:24] day I don't know that I've ever seen it
[2:02:26] so pronounced in a family as it is the
[2:02:29] Arnold family brother Homer Arnold's
[2:02:32] Family been around several different
[2:02:34] ones of them and just to see from one to
[2:02:36] the other his brothers and different
[2:02:37] ones and just certain things you'd see
[2:02:40] about them and think just exactly like
[2:02:42] brother Homer
[2:02:44] was do they have to study to become
[2:02:48] that do they have to take 15 years of uh
[2:02:52] education on this and that and the other
[2:02:54] it's embedded in them
[2:02:57] somehow Lord God May these things that
[2:03:00] we're talking about may they become so
[2:03:03] real to us it's a second nature for us
[2:03:07] to
[2:03:08] forgive and we know what always deal
[2:03:10] with our
[2:03:11] flesh and the thing will be which one
[2:03:14] pulls the trigger
[2:03:16] first even though we're a new creature
[2:03:19] we're still a new creation in the same
[2:03:22] old Temple and when we're faced with
[2:03:24] opposition and we're being tried which
[2:03:26] one will pull the trigger
[2:03:28] first and the flesh will always try to
[2:03:33] jump ahead of the
[2:03:35] soul and the flesh will be the one
[2:03:37] that'll want to respond
[2:03:40] first so somebody says something does
[2:03:43] something to us the flesh wants to beat
[2:03:47] the
[2:03:49] soul and the thing you're wanting us to
[2:03:51] do is
[2:03:52] let you from the soul live out of
[2:03:56] us let you
[2:03:58] Reign you to
[2:04:01] rule that's what I want
[2:04:03] Jesus I have to be honest before you and
[2:04:06] these people today I've not always done
[2:04:09] that
[2:04:10] Lord and I feel I could say for most of
[2:04:13] them they've not always done that
[2:04:16] either they've let the body the flesh
[2:04:19] the senses react and sit of waiting or
[2:04:23] some of them wear that little uh
[2:04:25] silicone bracelet on their arm wwjc or
[2:04:30] JD or what would Jesus do what would
[2:04:33] Jesus see and how would Jesus
[2:04:36] react I don't want something like got
[2:04:38] just on my arm I want it embedded in my
[2:04:43] soul oh granny to us today Lord
[2:04:48] Jesus we worship you father
[2:04:51] how many here with me today like to
[2:04:54] raise your hand say God remember me be
[2:04:58] mindful of me
[2:05:00] Lord let me have your faith your virtue
[2:05:03] your knowledge your
[2:05:04] forgiveness and I know friends been your
[2:05:07] pastor I know many of you you've you've
[2:05:08] suffered terrible things at the hand of
[2:05:11] people and you may always remember what
[2:05:13] they've done but the phenomenal thing
[2:05:16] about it is you can forgive them from
[2:05:17] your
[2:05:18] heart and yet your mind still remember
[2:05:21] this ter terrible thing that they did or
[2:05:23] said or whatever it was to
[2:05:25] you oh
[2:05:27] Hallelujah I wonder if it'd be asking
[2:05:30] too much for the choir to come back up
[2:05:33] and sing that song that they sang for us
[2:05:35] a while AG go while we're while we're
[2:05:37] praying could youall do that for
[2:05:40] us let's just raise our hands before God
[2:05:43] by doing that you're signifying God I
[2:05:45] have needs
[2:05:46] today I have needs today Lord maybe some
[2:05:50] of you sick
[2:05:52] some of you maybe need the Holy Ghost
[2:05:54] some of you are burdened about a son a
[2:05:55] daughter whatever it is some of you
[2:05:58] needing those
[2:05:59] virtues some of you may have an
[2:06:01] unforgiving spirit because people have
[2:06:04] abused you people have taken advantage
[2:06:06] of you in your
[2:06:08] life and you think I could never forgive
[2:06:10] them well maybe you can't you may be
[2:06:11] telling the truth but I believe Jesus in
[2:06:14] you
[2:06:15] can would you mind if we just take her
[2:06:18] hand lay over on the shoulder of the
[2:06:19] individual Val you there
[2:06:22] let's just offer prayer for each other
[2:06:26] today hallelujah
[2:06:31] hallelujah thank you Lord
[2:06:34] Jesus father I think we've come to
[2:06:36] recognize
[2:06:39] that we're not leaving this world as a
[2:06:43] whole until every
[2:06:45] member of the bride of Christ is inner
[2:06:49] position that with the in will be a
[2:06:52] great
[2:06:53] miracle for all over the world you have
[2:06:56] got your people
[2:06:57] spread and not only will the people here
[2:07:00] the elect of God in this assembly arrive
[2:07:03] at that
[2:07:04] spot where faith will be from edge to
[2:07:08] edge in the First Foundation virtue from
[2:07:12] edge to edge on up on up on
[2:07:16] up and then the Dynamics of that church
[2:07:19] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:23] the prophet likened it to a
[2:07:26] tube that instead of having an old coal
[2:07:29] patch put on top of it that it's
[2:07:34] vulcanized and then you and the tube
[2:07:37] become
[2:07:39] one I read that quote the other day Lord
[2:07:42] and I typed it in as a note underneath
[2:07:45] that quote the original YouTube
[2:07:51] that's exactly what you want us to
[2:07:54] be that we become so
[2:07:58] vulcanized by the spirit of
[2:08:01] God that your own love and mercy and
[2:08:04] virtues is manifesting itself to
[2:08:07] us and we know Lord hearing these things
[2:08:11] we're going to be
[2:08:13] tried some already are
[2:08:17] being we know that we'll be tried when
[2:08:19] we hear it and we make up our mind we
[2:08:21] want this to be in our life and it's our
[2:08:23] possession our inheritance we'll be
[2:08:26] tried but let us not be alarmed and
[2:08:30] surprised Lord God let it grow in us let
[2:08:34] it mature in
[2:08:36] us maybe not be walking Miracles just
[2:08:39] because of quit cursing and quit
[2:08:40] drinking and quit running around with
[2:08:42] somebody else's wife but because we love
[2:08:45] like
