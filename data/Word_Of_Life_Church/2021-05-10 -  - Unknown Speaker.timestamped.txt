[0:00] second corinthians 13 11 finally
[0:02] brethren farewell
[0:04] be perfect be of good comfort be of one
[0:07] mind
[0:08] live in peace
[0:11] and the god of love and peace
[0:15] shall be with you how many needs the god
[0:18] of peace
[0:20] that leaves the devil out right now the
[0:23] devil is a liar
[0:24] and he's a troublemaker and there's only
[0:26] one god of peace
[0:27] and it's not buddha it's not shintoism
[0:30] it's not male-ism it's not any other
[0:32] it's not
[0:33] muslim we can see that they certainly
[0:34] don't believe in peace there's only one
[0:36] god of peace and who was that the lord
[0:39] jesus christ
[0:40] come down in a human form in order to
[0:43] bear the veil
[0:44] of the reconciliation in his own body
[0:47] to make peace between us and god
[0:51] because we were enemies against god when
[0:54] we were lost
[0:55] and if you're here today and you don't
[0:56] know the lord jesus you are an
[0:58] enemy against god and god is an enemy
[1:01] against you
[1:02] but in the veil of the flesh of the lord
[1:05] jesus
[1:05] all my mercy and grace kissed together
[1:09] and we were caught right in the middle
[1:10] of that heavenly kiss
[1:12] and it brought redemption and now we're
[1:14] at peace with god
[1:16] [Applause]
[1:19] praise the lord philippians 4 7
[1:22] and the peace of god which
[1:25] passes all understanding
[1:29] shall keep your hearts
[1:32] and minds through christ jesus
[1:36] [Music]
[1:37] wow look at the power of peace is it any
[1:41] wonder
[1:42] that satan would want to rob us of our
[1:44] peace
[1:45] well if this is what's going to help
[1:48] keep our minds and our hearts
[1:51] what if you was the devil wouldn't you
[1:53] try to rob every child of god you could
[1:56] from peace why peace will keep their
[1:59] minds
[2:01] and their hearts through christ jesus
[2:03] colossians 3 15
[2:05] and let in other words allow
[2:08] and let the peace of god
[2:12] rule rule
[2:15] in your hearts i love this word
[2:19] rule you can see the greek word there it
[2:21] means
[2:22] to be an umpire
[2:34] strike
[2:49] like it ain't what you feel mama what do
[2:52] you
[2:52] say well that ain't no strike that's a
[2:54] ball mama said it was a ball
[2:57] but the umpire said strike
[3:03] lord of god children when you allow
[3:06] peace to move into that sphere
[3:11] of your life and satan throws it out
[3:13] yeah
[3:14] the empire said he's not out i'm the one
[3:17] who makes this cause here
[3:19] and the devil remembering this game is
[3:22] the picture
[3:43] don't you lose your concentration
[3:48] the bases are loaded
[3:51] it's up to you little bride to knock
[3:54] them all home
[4:00] it's up to us brother john it's up to
[4:02] our saints of god
[4:03] the bases are loaded the dispensations
[4:06] are almost full
[4:08] the changes are consummated
[4:15] he's doing everything he can concentrate
[4:20] concentrate on
[4:23] here comes that guy can throw about 95
[4:26] miles an hour oh my
[4:27] oh think concentrate
[4:32] but what if he don't lie on me it don't
[4:34] matter what if he calls it a shot
[4:36] it don't matter what he says it matters
[4:38] what the umpire says
[4:42] now i know the devil's going to say this
[4:43] is a bought out game
[4:46] because the owner of our team is also
[4:49] the umpire
[4:53] all glory to god that will not work in
[4:56] national baseball
[4:58] it won't work himself all but it works
[5:00] in this devil
[5:02] and if you don't like it get out
[5:05] but the owner of our team and he
[5:08] is the umpire and when you feel like
[5:11] i've struck out
[5:12] i'm out he says
[5:17] lord of god you're not out
[5:21] oh i can't i can't you're not out
[5:31] let the peace of god
[5:34] on power in your hearts
[5:39] anybody beside me just ever gets
[5:40] stressed out with life
[5:42] ready three or four of you five six
[5:46] oh i want something the rest of you that
[5:47] didn't raise your hands come up and rub
[5:49] on me after church
[5:50] please
[5:54] just life itself so much sickness so
[5:58] much trouble so much going on
[6:01] i need an empire
[6:04] that's fred i need an empire in my life
[6:07] all those are doing is speaking in
[6:09] tongues i love that
[6:10] that's not the empire i love to feel him
[6:14] feelings is not the umpire emotion
[6:17] is not the umpire but one of the weakest
[6:22] gifts that seemingly god would give to
[6:24] his people
[6:26] peace
[6:30] just peace and god says peace you be the
[6:33] umpire
[6:34] dynamics you're on first base
[6:40] energeo energy you're on second
[6:44] eternal life you're on third and wow
[6:47] who's going to be the umpire
[6:49] peace we say miracle supernatural
[6:54] no when miracles don't come as soon as
[6:57] you think they should
[6:59] if peace is there
[7:02] if peace is there praise speak to god
[7:07] oh i know the devil says it ain't fair
[7:09] it ain't fair because here i am
[7:11] batten and the picture's against me

[7:17] my team

[7:21] don't know much about baseball but i
[7:22] don't got this game figured out

[7:34] i'm on your side
[7:39] so you imagine that i'm standing i'm so
[7:41] nervous i'm so tall
[7:43] but my umpire which is on my side i've
[7:45] got you covered
[7:47] i've got you covered but what if i make
[7:50] a mistake
[7:51] i've got your cover i don't even
[7:54] see it but i've struck out so many times
