you but I'm not going to let a rock crowd for me like it or not I want to praise him with all that I have and all it is do it in me if I hold back then I'm I'm just a hypocrite I want to be what I am in got in Christ we sung this last night help me sing it again what a beautiful name it is what a beautiful name the name of Jesus Christ he is Mikey what a beautiful name there's nothing compares to this what a beautiful name in the name of you you didn't want heaven without me Jesus he rode heaven down my sin was great your love was greater what could separate us now what a wonderful name what a wonderful name a Hyundai Jesus because my what a long name nothing water wonderful name it in the name [Music] death could not hold you the bail Tobin for you your silence no bows our sin and grace the heavens are or in the pay's of your glory or you have raised to life again and what a powerful name five power honey a my what a powerful name and again palpable Sunday what a power they [Music] Maji what a beautiful name praise your name Lord Jesus we worship your Lord [Music] thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah amen don't you just love that wonderful name I know some of you were shocked last night whenever I mentioned that there are some of these poor message people that don't worship Jesus no more it's almost more than our minds can comprehend but never thought in this great message which was brought back to the truth that there would be such heresy and lies it's just a lack of understanding and revelation I love the name of Jesus oh you say your simple call me Oh Thomas if you will Thomas bowed down before him and said my lord and my god [Applause] [Music] is not no second person of the Godhead or the third person he is the person we still love him Varun here as long as I'm going to be here as the pastor we're going to praise him with a magnifying we're going to exalt him and lift him higher than the heavens I find it strange I just her brother been said this week that God exalted him so high and gave him such a name that everything in heaven is called a his name man made him so low on the earth and the lowest man in the city had to look down on him Zacchaeus in the tree but he said when God raised him up he has to look down to be able to even see heaven from the Angels that's the way I believe it Amen god bless it has turned today if you would the Song of Solomon again chapter 4 verse 12 both God and Satan know the power of words the power of being able to persuade and being able to convince by visual things and also verbal things Solomon of course knew this as well I don't believe that Solomon was actually fabricating this he's going to tell us today but I believe he he saw it in in this Shulamite he says a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shutter a fountain sealed that plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits campfire with spikenard spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all chief spices a fountain of gardens a fountain of gardens peculiar statement a fountain of gardens so it's a fountain with many gardens that comes out of it of mountain of gardens a whale of living waters as in plural and streams from Lebanon she is so overwhelmed and so convinced that what he is told her this is her response bang awake o north wind and come down south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out notice the direction she wants it to go toward now that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits dispersed together Lord Jesus we love you so much today thank you our loving Heavenly Father for being so mindful of us in this hour of darkness and trouble we truly are in a wedding night Lord and as well as any other time of natural even looking at it in the earth when darkness strikes the earth and nighttime comes around things become more scary a noise that we would hear during the day seems to be magnified during the night the unseen is always more difficult to deal with so I pray that should help us and our wedding night Lord as we are facing the greatest darkness that the world has ever known may the light of God shine in our hearts we pray today in Jesus name Amen god bless us and you may be seated truly there is a great parallel between what was going on here in the Song of Solomon and where we are today being quite different of course as we mentioned last night that was her and him they were in in the bridal chamber and the basically the outside noises all the people around them on the outside were totally away from them and they were enjoying each other's presence they were being caught up by each other the attributes that that's so fallen in love with they get no and out at the same time there was all types of revelry and all types of things that was going on on the outside same it is today for those that are in Christ Jesus sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost our soul sail on the presence of God the world is shut out in our soul but certainly not in our flesh and in the spirit realm we are naturally affected by those things which are around us Satan learned it many many many many years ago by watching God and also seeing the first human beings that were placed upon the earth that humans have the potential of being greatly affected by the things which are was out and different from themselves they can be affected by words that can be affected by mannerisms that can be affected by behavior they can be affected even before there was television they could be affected by visual effects and things around them we know that in the Garden of Eden there was no TV there was no radio no newspaper no Facebook no cell phones any of that sort of thing but yet still II was affected by something that was apart from herself and it was something that was able to create a question in her mind about the validity of God's Word and about if God was honest and just or not to see if God was really true and to see if God was just by keeping them away from something that this other being was telling them that they should really per take of and should be able to enjoy Satan found it out then remember that's his first battle with the human being had fought with angels but he never fought was humans before so he didn't really know how to do it so it's as if though he's learning it as he goes now we know of course in this day that we live our mind our spirit is under a constant onslaught of things every day that we live what about social media whether by programs sort of by music whether by videos whatever it is newspaper people can be so politically effective we've heard so much about Russia's collusion and all that they've tried to do in our and our elections and all that and people are trying to prove that they effected this and that did they well you know they probably did as no doubt we probably try to do the same thing to theirs because they have spies over here and we have spies over there and we just found one another and that's that sad because that's the hour that we're living in and but we know that people are certainly affected by that you know the Vietcong they used it it was a great thing propaganda Titus used it has been used for centuries in order to be able to propagate what they want you to affect the congregation or the minds of the people and get them to believe what they wanted to believe how in the work at six million Jews much less to polish all the others that were killed during World War two how would they be able to do that in the world set back and hold their peace the propaganda of the Third Reich of the regime by which they were able to be able to project it to the people around the world pick selected pictures pick selected films and so on project that to what they were doing and the world set by and let them on Isle eight millions of people is alright how was it able to be done manipulate the minds of the people as things was trickling out under the reign of the Third Reich if people send they're killing people they're they're burning them and they're putting them gas chambers and they're creating their bodies in the world said no no there's no way this is going on it can't be going on this is the twentieth century how could that be happening so habits are able to do it you're some end goal of course one of the great propagandist of the Third Reich was able to pick the certain videos and the certain things and be able to put it and pull the wool over the entire world's eyes or you say that'll never happen again no it won't happen quiet again like that next time it's going to be even worse I said next time it's going to be even worse it's not going to be so much against the Jews but it's going to be against those who miss the rapture and those who wind up in the tribulation period the church let me just tell you this morning friends that will be the foolish virgin that do not assume the mark of the beast that will also be message people who've sent around in Point Church some of you that attend this church if you don't get on fire with God and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going straight for the tribulation as sure as there's a God in heaven you're not going to go on the rapture just because you say you believe God sent a prophet you're not going in the rapture because you attend happy on the occasion you're going to have to go in the rapture because you are filled with the Holy Ghost and born-again that's the only way you're going I don't have a ticket to be able to hand out to each one of you to give you a token in the rapture you're going because you're born of the Spirit of God there will be thousands no doubt a message people that will wake up one day and realize they have played Church to me they will be the worst category when the morning finally arrives and it dawns on them that they had missed the rapture whenever they look around the pastor's gone and Mama's gone and this one's gone and that one's gone and they go to child and tell them the people the world nugger think they're absolutely nuts they're not going to believe the raptures taking place because their preachers still here and the denominational people how long will it take before some of the message people are able to convince these others a week a month six months of the raptures finally come and they have missed it I don't know because I don't plan on being around I want to be filled with the Holy Ghost right now and they taste some this morning friend I'm not waiting for the Eclipse it's going to come in August I'm not waiting for the solar pattern to come on September the 21st and strike over two roots um I'm ready right now this morning not only that but let me go on and say I live ready every day of my life how many here's with me you live ray you don't have to wait to come to Sunday to get right with God you stay right every day and if you make a mistake and you do something wrong you simply repent of it and ask God to take it out of your life because if you are filled with the Holy Ghost you know it can be at any moment it could be at any time oh brother Donny I'm waiting for this sign and that son you'll never catch it the bride does not live by such a way the bride lives by love not by looking for signs not my reading of newspaper looking for a new website that prophetically tells you when he's coming nobody knows what is coming the Spirit of God here nurse will keep us aware and ready and alone maybe you believe it oh well wants to try to rock us to sleep and get us to where we're complacent and cold and indifferent and like delay the sins but for myself I refuse to be cold in this hour I refuse to be lukewarm I'm going to be on fire Wow because I can't be I can't be I don't need a boat I don't need an approval I don't need none of your approval and you don't need mine if I want to be on file with God I can be on fire with God if I want to be in love with Jesus Christ I can be and so I just take a wheel well glory can I just say how will there again you see that comes from the approach of your mind what you think you can be or what you want to be if you desire to be lukewarm certainly your desires your option to be so if you want to be complacent you can be so if you desire if you can desire to be our desire not to that's just as simple as that now much of what we are is affected of course by the things that are around us and as we look at the wedding not you with a song of solomon and the Shulamite we see he is creating by his love for her and the words that he's saying to her words that will help pull her into an environment that will be conducive for that which is leading up to and this is the wedding night so he must use his words of faithfully truthfully but they must be created I remember this man was a man of very great wisdom and understanding and he had ability to be able to talk and think in a way that most mortals just don't do you can tell by his words and by his parallels and things that he looked at a lot he was a man of such great understanding yet you can see through this in the act of condescension that he was talking to her in a way that she could relate it wouldn't do any good to try to talk to her in a way of being a scientist or some kind of archaeologists or something that she didn't understand so he talked to her a way that would be able to help her to see what he saw in her now as you look at it life's not the way they looked in the Old Testament even the New Testament for many hundreds of years in a mirror was that the mirror was not glass like we have today so they were take advice as Paul said there in 2nd Corinthians that we behold the glory of the Lord and as we behold the glory of the Lord we are changed into the same image I was using the symbolism of a mirror that would have been common era during this time for century and B in the Common Era and it would have been a piece of burnished metal if he said it been polished real bright and as the Sun would come down and hit that mirror then the mirror would actually bend the light or refract the light and as it would come back it would shine upon the face of the person that was holding it now you're appalled takes the same thing and says as we behold the Lord and we look at the glory of the Lord then it is bent and comes right back and shines upon us this is a real believer this is a real Christian it's not something that we try to make ourselves I'm trying to make myself a saint you might as well give up on it cuz you'll never do it I'm trying to make myself bride that won't work either you just had to be born again and that the glory of God shocked a mirror and it shines upon your face it is the radiance from His resurrection that he parts with his bride now in this of course the power of God is what brings this and makes it possible because we certainly could do it on our own solomon wants to do the very same thing to her and helping her to see her position and his love that he has for no doubt she's still nervous she's still jittery how in the world could she be married to the greatest King on the earth at this time and we think the same thing how could God have chosen us certainly not because of our looks our money our wealth our ability to do this and that but we were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world I like to remind the devil of that every now and then I like to remind the devil that he had a birthday I like to let the devil know that there was a day that he was created everything that had a beginning will have him in and because the birth the devil had a birthday he's got a doomsday coming there a man that was created perfect from the day that I created thee until iniquity was found in thee I'm not sure exactly how the devil is I wish I could give him a burst birthday cake on his birthday because I would be celebrating with him that he is a creature of time he is a creature of time oh let me remind him and remind you this morning those of you that are born again you are not creatures of time you have stepped down from eternity into a body called time but you're fixing to move back up again into that loop a man and in the last leg is right now in the final phase where we're going back into eternity again with our Blessed Lord now what difference does that make is that important for us to think on it is certainly it is my friends are Paul tells us in Philippians whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good whatsoever the faithful think on these things why it does something to your fro Neil which is one of the Greek words used for mine it is the way you look at things it shapes the things about you it shapes the way you will notice again Paul says in Ephesians 4:22 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind notice this in verse 24 that you put on the new man now notice between verse 22 and verse 24 the old man is verse 22 verse 24 is a new man but verse 23 is what brings this to pass be renewed in the spirit of your mind Philippians chapter 2 verse 2 he goes on to say fulfill you my joy that you'd be like and it had in the same love I love the word that he uses for this the light-minded it is thinking the same of each other and not thinking that you are better than someone else oh my I'm having a low esteem of yourself so in other words you don't look at yourself and you're a greater singer you're a greater preacher you're a greater you know whatever more you're more holy you're more this had the other but to be like-minded well praise the Lord having the same love being of one Accord of one mind phony 1:9 again he says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mine again he brings it into the same thing that we do not look at ourselves that we are something superior to others who are of the same character and quality now that's very hard because some people that are more gifted in the natural sense they tend to elevate themselves in a spiritual sense that they are better just because a person has a lot of natural talent doesn't make them one bit better spiritually as a matter of fact I've seen a lot of folks with a lot of natural talent they couldn't even live right because they so exalted their natural talent well praise the Lord I remembered in Pentecost I thought I'd passed them days but you come in as a message of relased it's the same thing many times you find talented singers and talented musicians and timely preachers that some of the hardest ones to ever get them to really get live right because they have so much to offer God in the world and everybody so they're so high-minded in themselves it's as if though they feel they are exempt from stringent requirements that God requires of all the rest of us but let me remind you this morning sweetie 5 you are required to same thing as the rest of us not his you required the same thing as those of us that are not near as gifted as you are your gift don't make you more holy your ability to preach don't make you no more closer to God that makes you more responsible for something gods give you hey ma'am notice he says but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves oh now realize a lot of folks are I'm no good I'm worthless I armor why don't you shut your line mouth most people they carry on like that don't believe that a bit more than nothing you don't believe it and you ain't going to convince us good morning a man let each esteem others better better better [Applause] than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you now this is what's important let this mind be in you what might this man I just read to you now now this is totally opposite of what Laodicea projects Laodicea projects self this is an age of self self-love self magnification whatever you want to do do it if it feels good do it forget about your wife forget about your mom and daddy just do whatever you want to do this is an age of self I'm glad it is because out of this age of self God is calling a self denying bride we are the contrast servant we are the contrast to the age of self oh my thank you Lord Jesus cost in chapter 1 verse 21 and you that were sometime alienated enemies in your mind by wicked works now notice you were aiding in the word a ladies is lacking the intimate position with God so you were alienated and enemies we're not just in your soul not just in your body but you were enemies in your mind now let me tell you something for it if were enemies in our mind against God originally if you're not careful that's where Satan will try to come and make you back in the enemy against God now well God done this and I don't understand it God let my mama die I don't understand it be careful what you allowing your mind Satan will try to alienate you by making you an enemy I don't understand this about the message and I don't understand that and you better be careful and watch what he's trying to do he will try to alienate you in your mind and you said write down the church pew oh my yet now happy reconcile notice again Constance 2:18 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he has not yet seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind again Colossians 3:12 but on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowls of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering again humbleness am i bringing yourself down bringing yourself down that you're not so super spiritual above everybody else most I'm so for spiritual ones that I've dealt with ain't nothing but troublemakers they know more the pastor does they know more than the citizens there they bout no more God does well thank you Jesus hallelujah 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind both you've got a sound mind in this age you're blessed your pockets may look like that but you're blessed you may not have a nickel in your pocket today but if you've got a sound mind you're a miracle we're living in an age of crazies we're living in an age of absolute insanity and it wonderful to get here do they have a sound mind just be in your right mind and closed notice how Peter relates to this and remember Peter was an ignorant unlearned man couldn't even write some got ahold of him though I forgot the Holy Ghost and they made him able to not only read but also write and use some pretty persuasive words in writing is that word for gird up the loins of your mind now this seems like a very peculiar and strange statement but to the Hebrews the loins was appropriated power in the man's body and from there of course come the ability for him to be able to reproduce himself but Peter likens this that like the mind itself is now the crew procreative ability of the individuals walk with God notice he said wherefore gird up the loins of your mind now this is a very strange statement to us because we don't Gerda no more but in this timeframe remember they would have wore the long robes most men and women and if the men or the women was wanting to run especially the men and had to do hard laborious work outside they would take either a belt or a rope and they would take and pull the long part of their garment up and they would girded up high with the belt or a rope that would free them up and their limbs or they could run where they can move a lot faster and your Peter is using the symbolism of our mind how that our mind must also be girded up so what do we do we take up the excess thoughts the thoughts that don't really we don't need to even think that way anyway and we gird up the loins of our mind now you hear of course they would bring it and then bring it around this part of the body so he's likening the intelligence or the mind I said having the ability no he don't say the Holy Ghost to do this he don't say the possible to it but he tells you as individuals your mama can't do this for your boyfriend your husband came do it for everybody's going to gird up the launch of your mind it's going to be you now from your mind comes a pro creative ability to be able to procreate your spiritual walk with God the loins of your mind wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ oh my now why does the mind them need to be renewed now this is what Solomon is doing of course of the Shulamite he is actually changing her mind now this is a very delicate thing I've had to do it many times as being a pastor when you go to talking to people about things that they think is wrong things it's just tradition basically they were handed down to from the church they went to from their mother father whoever more and it's a very delicate saying when you walk into someone's conscience and you are manipulating what they think is right and wrong that's very delicate and it must be done but sometimes you got to break into their conscience and you have to take out that traditional something that's almost like a conscience surgery you've got to go into their conscience and pull out that traditional thing that they feel like is wrong yet they have nothing in the word that says so but momma grandpas and my grandma said it was and you had to go in there and be able to remove that part from their conscience and replace that part with a truth from the Word of God now the delicate part about it is not only why you're in there during the surgery but then after you leave and sew them up then they will go home and then go to thinking of the other parts of the access of their conscience or what about this is this wrong is that wrong is this wrong I don't even know what's right and wrong anymore now the power of that lays was in us when we go to sorting it through why does our minds need to be renewed because they are constantly under an all salt every day that we live in Satan sees so the mind is programmed listen to me now the mind is programmed by our parents by our family by their education by our mentors by the teachers or the preacher by the people to go to church well by the people with fellowship with so our beliefs are all of these things that are in us they come from somewhere many of them are not the Word of God come on church our thoughts our ideas our opinions about this and that and the other and we hold them many times we hold it because of a family member we hold it because of an association or score in our life but it's buried so deep we just know that it's got to be the truth not necessarily it may be very deep very deep in your conscience but that don't mean that it's right and that's why when you go to operating on people in a very surgical type of way and to removing those things they'll clamp up on you ain't getting that away from me bless God my grandma told me and my grandpa go ahead if you want to keep that brain tumor go ahead and keep it I'm trying to help you here today with a little bit of spiritual serger if you'll let me [Applause] now even prejudices and opinions and things that we have they are molded I come on say so tighten up on me you know folks live in the south if I have a racial issue I'll tell you what they need to do they need to get saving it's old it goes any white man that don't love a black man's not born again any white man that don't love an American Indian or a Korean or Japanese or whatever more and he looks at himself and thinks that he's superior race get rid of that old Hepler spirit all for you hey how did he go the other way a black man or a black woman that don't love a white man they need the Holy Ghost as well that's right what Mo's all this it's prejudices and these things that maybe happen and there's no question about it many of the black people have suffered awful terrible things at the hand of the white people there's no question about it but you realize friends my goodness my great great great great great grandfather mother than subjects on it but I never I never inside no black man or no Indian or nobody else and I have no plan on going south but what is it they see a certain color that prejudice raises up within there and they be looking at a person that is totally innocent that would never do them any harm but it is embedded in their conscience it is a president why why am I going this way it is a prejudice that is buried within there's the leverage here this morning for you my goodness whoa sir I mean you just let us have it today now these things come from our parents our grandparents or things that have happened to us naturally of course no doubt their social and I couldn't keep from having a process about a king being a rich man a man that was a wealthy man a man that was Updike so whatever more they called them and that day we have our slang form today people that live in a certain style of house and God a certain type of car and all that we would have our certain little slang words that we would use for those people and if you're not careful the poor can have just as much prejudice toward the rich as the risk and towards the poor well friends i'ma go and preach this morning I don't know or than anything that makes us whether it's on like Christ God wants to help us to get rid of and those things that for me in us that's what makes it so difficult then when they go to sorting through now you'd imagine maybe she had some sort of a prejudice toward a person of renown personal well a person like a kid what's he trying to do help her to get rid of that by bringing himself down on her level to be able to help her oh my hallelujah kind of go on thank you now remember you asked me to do it when two German universities join forces to investigate social networking researchers discovered that discovered that one in three people

tolerance this term is used to describe the desperate behavior of a facebook addict they spend an increasing amount of time on the site coming to a stage where they need it in order to obtain sass or on the other extreme it has had a detrimental effect on them as a person and their life for the family members and friends who think they are dealing with an addict don't nobody look don't nobody move or roll your eyes everybody look straight this way so nobody won't suspicion a sign to look out for our multiple mason facebook windows open three or four more confirms that they are indeed suffering from this condition withdrawal symptoms they become obvious when one is restricted from using facebook because i had to participate in normal everyday activities like we all used to do you know just stuff that we all used to do you ever watch folks in the restroom you sitting there eating father's on his phone mothers on her all 14 kids got a cell phone all 14 of them's on their own phone your

Tommy and Carol not long ago that they are dealing with it in the medical field because people are losing the ability to be able to converse young people have lost the ability many of them to even apply properly on a resume to be able to get a job because everything is abbreviated text language they can't even speak English no more they can't even go all boy we're going to keep right on going

gift into gossip we're addicted to all kinds of so I would to God some of us would get addicted to the Holy Ghost get addicted also going to the house of God get addicted to prayer meetings get addicted to reading our Bible we've got these smartphones and we got the Bible on them do even read them anymore do even care anymore are always so wound up in the social media all children let us get ready for the rapture [Applause] common signs are anxiety distress they need to talk about Facebook and what might have been posted on the wall in their absence okay this is all Greek to me alright I

droid I'll tell you what I hate shopping but it don't affect you this Oh children if we pine for God that way the data we long home forgotten if we hunger for God that way 304 to get back in church on widget idly man alive so we have to dismiss on Sunday that means when we'll have church on Monday won't have Church on QC and we gotta wait all day long before we get to go back or get away to back to the house of God ort way you can miss a whimsy you can miss a week you can miss to and it don't bother you at all why you got your priorities wrong brand you're addicted to Facebook you're addicted to your telephone here it gets into the things of the world and you have not got a good Holy Ghost addiction to the power of God you got to change around if you're going to leave this world in Iraq [Applause] kids I notice going to bend this hard today how would we come to church reduction of normal social / recreational activities someone suffering from fad will reduce the time spent catching up with friends playing sport or whatever it is they used to enjoy doing to simply spend time on Facebook instead of catching up with a friend for coffee they will send a Facebook message a dinner plate will be substituted with a messenger chat boy hound dog in the henhouse look all over his church this morning in extreme cases a person will even stop answering their parents phone calls instead insisting they use Facebook to contact them fake friends if 8 out of 10 people shown on their Facebook page are complete strangers it is undeniable they have a serious case of fad oh we better call 9-1-1 right now longer I go the worse it's getting in here fevers high blood pressure passing out is his passing out coming over the congregation right now or children complete addiction when they meet new people they say their name followed by I'll talk to you on Facebook or those who are extremely bad I'll see you in Facebook what is it it is a world that is unreal but to them they are so addicted they will see them in Facebook don't you see there's a parallel to this when we can get that addiction to Jesus Christ and we tell him I'll see you in Happy Valley on Sunday morning Lord I know you're going to be there I know your presence is going to be there I'm going to bring you with through the Lord I know I'm going to meet you there their pets have Facebook pages now that's something I want to say a dog on Facebook and I'm sure there's a lot to like it was on how much I'm poor leg again can't you just see a Doberman Pinscher sitting there now do we have what it is they do on Facebook the pets are Facebook pages and any notifications wall posts in boxes or friend requests that they receive give them a high listen children then when they are canta I'm trauma dadich's it actually releases to them an endorsement from the brain that produces it lifts them it helps them maybe they're down there feeling low and ever chirp or beef or whatever more it actually gives them a surge it's only momentarily but it's a high a temporary high one which can be compared to the gambling addicts that get from the pokies or the roulette table studying the brains of Facebook addicts they found the same part of the brain that reacts now they took those individuals and put them through MRIs but their phones in there they couldn't access it but they could hear the chirps they could hear their whatever them signals are whatever the you y'all understand what I'm talking about whatever it was and they would watch the brain of this person they could not even see it but they would flash before them Facebook symbols and flash before them certain things and age time they would do it their brain would react but the difficult part about it was it was the same part of the brain that reacts to a heroin addict [Applause] [Music] hey smart very beneficial in some ways is having detrimental effect on the everyday behaviors of people around the world when an individual's online life becomes more important than the real one we know that there is a serious problem that needs to be addressed now why does our mind then need to be renewed because we've got all this stuff out there there's so many ways that we can be contacted and there's so many ways that we can't on Beggs it's amazing me we can contact the same people 13 or 14 different ways 20 over quota mark Latimer and then Facebook them in the message Amanda why do you need all the things for the very same person I mean maybe I'm dance or something I don't know but there isn't one enough of the very same one unless you've got a girlfriend on the side why would I want to tweet by the skipping jinjin touch by the up and call by the skip and video message by the skip and be able to do all that to the same person I truly don't think I'm not sinless as nuts as I am so what in the world's going on is to fill up our lives and our mind with all of this other chatter of the world to break our divine fellowship with Almighty God notice Solomon in proverbs 23:7 said bur as a man thinketh in his heart so is he Philippians 4:8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are oh my are the just and of a pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things Romans 12:2 be not conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove OMA that you may prove this is the same word used for medals and being able to prove the strength the density of medals that you may prove what is that good and perfect and acceptable will of God is this more important than the things that you're the world if mothered are you said I'm wrong to have Facebook I'm not saying it at all I'm saying it's how you use it or let me rephrase it how it uses you Risa's I know there's going to be a whole line of people stand up on the outside it won't take me for lunch today after this tremendous wonderful sweet farm and well no they won't take us out honey for five years brother Kenneth used to say after this I'm work you said the Sims is that a renewed mind is absolutely essential to finding the will of God how can a person who has a mind and their spirit all filled with all these things of the world out here and ever find the will of God for the life especially if you're posted on Facebook that you're finding trying to find the will of God for this at another get ready for a deluge it's amazing to me how people can always tell you and I to find the will of God main had it in forty seven years but they can tell you how to find it for your a lot they can pay in five seconds a perfect will of God for your alive No thank you I'll just stick it out between me and God myself a heart would love a heart that is pulled away from the things of the world can you use these things of course we can can we be able to use the internet we can you know there's some brothers in the message that preach the Internet is the mark of the beast yeah an India body that has the Internet in their home house the mark of the beast well I'll preach the same thing as you can summon with the Bible or the prophet of God said such a thing come on now it is a means by which were able to use it the very first quote on message faces the Simpsons 1947 our brothers he said I've got some new recording machines the very first quote in the entire message that is recorded is brother Branham attributing to the Advancement of science and what they've been able to do to make the messages more available are you glad for the tape recorder in this day it was not an invention of the Holy Ghost it was an invention by man ordained to be used for the saints of God are you glad when you cannot be a church if you're able to stream if you say home and shame and you could be a church altar streamer blows a hole in your sheetrock god never intended for you to stay home and you'd be the house of God but it can be used in the right way aren't you glad for yourself aren't you glad for those things that can be used in the right way but God wants us to use and a sane sensible people I [Applause] think all clothes [Music] I got about 29 more pages of quotes and scriptures but will resume in next week I mean that is a I still have a job the feel you don't need hire and Betty oh my friends don't you want to be what God what she's thinking I listen to you on every may god help us to me it'll be a greater age to overcome that in the age of 17 can you imagine Peter and Paul and first century Christians been able to step out of that age as they could have down the curtain of time and in a mortal body step into this room and look and see what we have to deal with every day that is overwhelmed can you imagine your grandmother your great-grandmother being able to stand up and look and see think how do you all do it when you all ever have time for prayer of course they plowed the fields from Sun up to Sun Sun said they milk the cows they cleaned out the bar and say they had a whole lot more to do at least if they had time left over to pray and seek God most of you may be working on eight hour a day I saw the mother eyes what you feel with some winds and things mama can we hear in this morning as he is pulling us up close to him wanting to take his words and reshape our thinking young girls young men be careful who what friends you making them chat rooms Amen there young ladies every week that are killed because they meet some renegade and a chatroom and go off some word meeting they slit sore throat don't try to set stuff go off to meet somebody never even met before what's wrong with people what do you suppose it's insanity do you understand that insanity is creeping in our churches people are doing things they wouldn't even thought of doing years ago why they're becoming desensitized this is a friend on my chat wall this is really how do you know and your parents would let them do it I'll have hell to pay for this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] more excuses this is parents again if you would have on your father I know this has been difficult today but I absolutely refuse to bring reproach upon you your spirit and what you've led me to say by apologizing I am NOT going to do it I pray Lord that should deal with every heart here today I know many of them don't have facebook they're not involved in in the addiction part of it and all that some of them use in the right way they use it with restraints but Lord may this be a warning to those who do that Lord than others of us that don't even have facebook maybe realize just because we don't have that domain it weren't not being unarmed salt from other avenues sometimes it's living with a friend is living with a adulterer mother that's constantly feeding us constant negativity constant negative things reshaping our mind help us Lord Jesus we know Lord living in your presence feeding on your word you will shape us into that image as the light of the Sun shines upon the burnished mirror the brighter a chance the more of its glory can shine upon us truly this is our desire today each of us have so many mistakes and so many faults were faulty people forgive us Lord forgive us of our shortcomings help us father to use all these things off the tree of knowledge of good and evil sameness sensibly praise God lord I thank you for many of them they have been such a tremendous blessing Lord I remember years ago remember brother Neal Holland's under the earlier pioneers that was going to put the message and make it available where we could search it seemed like a dream back years years ago yet Lord Saints right here on this church Saints up in the church in Lima in different places were able to listen and type down or to put all the message to be able to put it in a software now I surround the world in a moment of time that can type in a few words it's on our phones I use it almost daily sending quotes to brothers to encouragement what a blessing but that same phone of mine to be able to look at all kinds of fills and all kinds of nonsense meme fit wasn't sexual sinful stuff in that way it could be all kinds of negativity and running people down and whatever more Lord I've got enough to deal with I would have feed on things that are pure whole in just that my mind can be renewed I can't go to Lowe's a Walmart father hardly a time without seeing or hearing something that is adverse to the kingdom of God Lord Jesus I pray you'd help each of us to know that being born again is a one-time thing renewing our mind is a daily constant ongoing process Paul mentioned that we changed from glory to glory we know that that is gradual it is progressive as we are changed and washed and our minds are renewed so we move from glory to glory maybe that people look today and see may they ask themselves am I really growing in God am i excelling in God if I moved in glory since five years or have a regret no doubt no doubt if they answer they're not where they used to be or they're not where they need to be no doubt if they would look at their mind and see what they're thinking on they will find a connection Lord Jesus help us let this mind that was in you being us who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God Minister to your people today father the visible audience invisible audience or Dino the effects of this will around the world made a Spirit of God help each of us to hear it in the right spirit and attitude that it was given in Lord there's anyone guilty here today no doubt there must be some somewhere you never put it on the heart that I pray that you would help them help them to break that addiction use it Lord as these things off the tree of knowledge of good and evil can be used as we go to hospitals and we use glasses and contacts and medication and AIDS and this and that and the other that's been given to us but we use them sensibly they we use these tools that Satan is so injected into this age the same way if the Saints would use Facebook in the proper way for prayer requests and testimonies and good things like that it could be a great thing the Lord had heard the other day of a church not near us but a church in another state and the members of that church was fussing back and forth back and forth on Facebook about things that was born on inside the church and even sinners respond in San I thought you all were Christians I thought you all were saved so instead of handling them problems as they ought to in the backyard they pulled it right on the front yard and put it right there before them unbelievers help us Lord Jesus to realize we will be held accountable for such things those believers in that church will be held accountable for bringing the reproach upon that pastor in that church help us Lord Jesus I pray we love your father with all of our hearts a madam thank you Lord don't you love him today children oh and God so good to us then is so good now souls will Alleluia soldier be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God praise the Lord praise the Lord Jesus the day's Swanson would you come and sing a song for us it

so much to us actually I got to crying last night forgive me for take just a second I got to crying last night but there's only talk about the name the name was Jesus they don't worship Jesus anymore remember my little son Dallas when he was little autistic he had to wear glasses when he was real little just would put contact with him couldn't keep him glasses in him own him contacts and so forth and we knew something was wrong with him but then they told us that he was deaf it'd be dead and I never forget I hear my I see my lovely wife she cry she says how I just broke her heart she'll never hear the name of Jesus if he's deaf but then I found out later he wasn't deaf but just to think he would never hear the name of Jesus because they thought it was deaf brother that's the greatest name I know us aimée Heavenly Father I'm so thankful Lord not only that I have the natural hearing to be able to hear the name of Jesus but Lord I have the spiritual hearing to be able to hear the endtime message and Jesus restored back the truth the revelation of Christ Christ the mystery of God revealed we're so thankful Lord for what you brought to us this morning bless your server for giving it to
