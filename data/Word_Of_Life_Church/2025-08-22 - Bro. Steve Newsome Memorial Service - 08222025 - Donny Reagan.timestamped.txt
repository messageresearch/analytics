[20:17] God bless you. Appreciate each of you
[20:21] taking the time this evening to come out
[20:22] and uh pay our respects to brother Steve
[20:25] Newsome and to his family. And we trust
[20:28] that uh
[20:30] your presence of being here will bring
[20:31] comfort to their hearts. Let's just bow
[20:35] our heads.
[20:39] Father, we are gathered here this
[20:40] evening
[20:42] to honor a great man of faith, our
[20:45] brother Steve Nuome,
[20:47] to offer words of encouragement and
[20:49] condolences to his family.
[20:52] We ask God that you comfort the family
[20:53] as only you can do now and in the days
[20:56] ahead.
[20:58] We ask your blessings upon this service
[21:00] and may all that's done be for your
[21:01] glory.
[21:03] May your presence be felt among us. And
[21:06] may the peace of knowing you have
[21:07] everything in your control bring
[21:09] strength to the family in the days that
[21:11] are to come be my prayer.
[21:13] Fill the void that's left in our hearts
[21:16] from the pastor, brother Steve, with
[21:17] your love, mercy, and your grace.
[21:21] And may we cherish the mereness we have
[21:24] until we meet him again
[21:26] in Jesus name.
[21:30] Steven Allan Newsome, 51, Hampton,
[21:33] Tennessee, went home to be with the Lord
[21:35] Monday, August the 18th, 2025
[21:38] in the Sycamore Shows Hospital with his
[21:40] family by his side.
[21:43] He was a native of Gallup, Ohio, and was
[21:46] a son of Wanita Adams and Dennis
[21:48] Newsome. Steve was a faithful member of
[21:51] the Word of Life Church in Johnson City.
[21:54] Brother Steve was a dedicated Christian
[21:56] husband and father who loved God in his
[21:59] family above all else.
[22:02] He was a kind man who had a heart for
[22:04] others and a special ministry that
[22:06] touched lives of many that he came
[22:08] across in his life's journey. He had a
[22:11] great appreciation for nature and love
[22:13] playing his many guitars and truck
[22:16] driving.
[22:17] Brother Steve was preceded in death by a
[22:20] brother Randy Nuome, his adopted parents
[22:22] Bennett and Judy Fout Newsome. In
[22:24] addition to his parents, survivors
[22:26] include his loving wife Jennifer Elkins
[22:29] Newsome, four children Derek Alan Mills
[22:31] and his wife Adessa, Caleb Joshua Nuome,
[22:34] Rachel Elizabeth Nuome, and Brianda
[22:37] Michelle Nuome. his siblings, Chuck,
[22:41] Deborah, Carla, Rick, Stacy, Brooke,
[22:45] Brian, Chrissy, Samantha,
[22:51] Brandy, Rhonda, Sarah, and Judy, and
[22:54] also several nieces and nephews,
[22:57] a loving church family, and many special
[22:59] friends.
[23:01] It's written in God's word, I have
[23:02] fought a good fight. I have finished my
[23:04] course. I have kept the faith.
[23:06] Henceforth there is laid up for me a
[23:08] crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
[23:11] the righteous judge, shall give me at
[23:12] that day, and not to me only, but unto
[23:15] all them also that love his appearing.
[23:18] 2 Timothy 4:7 and 8.
[23:21] In the book of the Song of Solomon, it
[23:23] talks about the tower that David built
[23:25] for an army where on there hang a
[23:26] thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
[23:28] men.
[23:30] No doubt this was built to honor men who
[23:32] had done great things in David's army
[23:34] where others could go to this tower and
[23:36] see these shields and it would inspire
[23:38] them to do great things like a museum to
[23:41] honor great men. And I believe if
[23:43] brother Steve had lived in David's day,
[23:45] no doubt his buckler and his shield
[23:47] would have been hanging in his tower.
[23:49] For brother Steve was a great warrior of
[23:51] faith, never wavering, never backing
[23:54] down, never giving room for defeat.
[23:59] When I last saw brother Steve in the
[24:00] hospital, he was telling me that God has
[24:02] it all in control and he had placed his
[24:05] life in his hands. His faith was resting
[24:08] on that. His life was a testament of the
[24:11] power of a believer who trusted in their
[24:13] God. Even when faced with uncurable
[24:16] odds, his faith grew stronger and his
[24:18] commitment to God never wavered.
[24:22] He was and is an inspiration to us all.
[24:25] And I say tonight, Brother Steve, go
[24:27] rest I till we meet again. May God's
[24:31] blessings rest upon each of you. Be my
[24:33] prayer.
[24:47] God bless you family. I've been asked to
[24:49] sing this.
[24:57] this place that I'm going to sing about.
[25:03] I can only imagine right now, Brother
[25:05] Steve, and what he's doing
[25:08] and how he is and how the other saints
[25:10] that are there are.
[25:13] And funerals we think are supposed to be
[25:15] sad, but when they're homegoing
[25:16] celebrations, there should be a little
[25:19] pep in our step, a little excitement in
[25:22] our voice somewhere. That's what I want
[25:24] to sing about. May it be a blessing.
[25:31] Won't it be a time?
[25:38] Oh, won't it be a time?
[25:43] [Music]
[25:45] Oh, won't it be a time
[25:50] talking with the angels?
[25:53] Won't it be a time?
[25:58] Oh, won't it be a time?
[26:05] Oh, won't it be a time?
[26:12] Oh, won't it be a time
[26:17] talking with the angels?
[26:21] Won't it be a time? See, when he gets
[26:25] there, begin to walk across those
[26:27] streets of gold. He won't look frail
[26:29] like he does now. He won't look sick. He
[26:32] won't look like he he he he needs
[26:34] another day. He's got eternity to praise
[26:37] and worship the Lord. He will look at
[26:40] his hands and his hands, they are new.
[26:45] When he looked at his feet, you know
[26:50] they did too. He looked all around him
[26:56] and all around
[26:58] him shine. He said, "I'm going to have a
[27:03] time
[27:05] and time."
[27:08] Oh, would it be a time?
[27:15] Oh, would it be a time
[27:19] talking with the angels?
[27:23] Would it be a time?
[27:27] Oh, I looked at my hands and you know
[27:32] they look new.
[27:35] I looked at my feet and they did too. I
[27:43] looked all around my new home and my new
[27:48] home did shine. I said, "I'm going to
[27:52] have a time. Might as well while we're
[27:54] there." Oh,
[27:58] won't it be a time?
[28:04] Oh, won't it be a time
[28:09] talking with the angels?
[28:12] Would it be a time? Y'all saints, help
[28:16] me sing. Oh, would it be a time?
[28:22] Yeah. Amen. Time. Oh, won't it be a
[28:27] time?
[28:31] Oh, won't it be a time
[28:36] talking with the angels?
[28:40] Won't it be a time, brother Steve? I'll
[28:43] be there soon. And then we're going to
[28:46] have a time.
[28:51] Oh, I'll help you have a good time.
[28:58] Oh, we're going to have a time
[29:03] talking with the angels.
[29:07] Won't it be a time? One more time. Oh,
[29:12] won't it be a mighty mighty mighty
[29:16] mighty mighty good time? Would it be a
[29:21] time?
[29:25] Oh, would it be a time
[29:30] talking with the angels?
[29:34] Would it be a time?
[29:39] [Music]
[29:40] Hallelujah.
[29:42] Amen.
[29:44] [Music]
[29:46] Praise the Lord.
[29:48] Hallelujah.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; My name is Paul Phillips.
[29:58] I'm a truck driver.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Close friend Steve Newsome.
[30:10] We spent many hours on the phone
[30:12] together talking.
[30:17] You know, I'd give him a call and I
[30:19] could still hear his voice saying,
[30:21] "Hello."
[30:23] And I'd say, "Hey, brother Steve, how
[30:25] you doing?" Then he'd say, "Gotcha.
[30:29] Leave a message after the tone." I can
[30:31] tell some of you have got that message
[30:33] before. He had a sense of humor.
[30:37] Sister Jennifer,
[30:40] Derek, Cadessa,
[30:42] Caleb,
[30:44] Rachel, Briana.
[30:48] Your dad's
[30:51] life as a truck driver. He wasn't just a
[30:53] truck driver.
[30:56] Truck driving isn't
[30:59] an easy one.
[31:03] You have many miles that you drive, many
[31:06] times away from the family, time you
[31:08] want to spend,
[31:10] having to stay up trying to stay awake.
[31:13] Thankfully, he helped me do that many
[31:15] times.
[31:17] We talked for hours.
[31:20] You know, you fight fatigue and other
[31:22] drivers, difficulty with shippers and
[31:24] receivers and different things
[31:27] and all carrying all that in the public
[31:29] eye. Everybody's seeing what you're
[31:31] doing out there while you're working.
[31:35] Steve wasn't just any old truck driver.
[31:37] He was extremely compassionate.
[31:41] He was the kind of man that would always
[31:43] look after others. He saw another driver
[31:46] in need, he wouldn't hesitate to stop
[31:49] and help them. Or another person, didn't
[31:52] have to be a driver, a car on the side
[31:53] of the road.
[31:56] I remember when several times I'd call
[31:58] him up
[32:00] and yeah I'd get gotcha and then a
[32:04] little bit later I'd get a call and he
[32:06] said sorry I didn't get your call
[32:08] I was on the side of the road helping
[32:10] somebody that needed a hand and end up
[32:14] leading them to Christ praying with them
[32:17] talking to them that was Steve he never
[32:21] hesitated to take an opportunity
[32:25] It wasn't his opportunity. It was God's
[32:27] opportunity that he took
[32:30] to help somebody not only on this side,
[32:34] but to make it over there. Every one of
[32:36] you that known him knows that's the
[32:38] truth. He wasn't a preachy kind of
[32:41] individual, but he knew just what you
[32:43] needed at every time, the scripture and
[32:46] different things.
[32:49] He lived his life out boldly every day.
[32:52] His face wasn't something that he kept
[32:55] quiet.
[32:58] He let everybody hear it that would
[33:01] hear.
[33:03] You know, if you were in distress and
[33:04] had a difficult day and were struggling
[33:07] and maybe somebody had rubbed you the
[33:10] wrong way, he'd always have a scripture,
[33:14] a prayer, something there for you that
[33:17] would lift you up.
[33:19] I remember one day that I was having
[33:21] some difficulty and he gave me this
[33:24] scripture, Isaiah 54:17.
[33:27] He says, "No weapon that is formed
[33:29] against thee shall prosper,
[33:32] and every tongue that shall rise against
[33:34] thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn.
[33:38] This is the heritage of the servants of
[33:39] the Lord, and the righteousness is of
[33:41] me, saith the Lord."
[33:45] That was Steve. Always ready to remind
[33:47] you of God's promises, always pointing
[33:49] back to the faith, no matter what you
[33:52] were going through.
[33:56] And when Steve would call, your
[33:59] conversations always turned to something
[34:01] that he was studying on that God was
[34:03] working with.
[34:06] And he didn't just read the Bible, he
[34:08] dug deep into it.
[34:11] Not just
[34:12] the rema but he listened to the logos
[34:15] the God himself talking
[34:19] one of the most powerful things he ever
[34:21] shared with me in studies we spent
[34:24] months and hours and hours Bible on our
[34:27] passenger seat while we're driving down
[34:28] the road flipping through it going
[34:33] through message of the hour brother
[34:34] Brandham's messages and different ones
[34:37] different things but was on the
[34:39] Gethsemane experience
[34:42] He said, "Everyone has to come to your
[34:44] Gethsemane experience." And I know,
[34:46] sister, I'm sure he's talked this to you
[34:48] many of times.
[34:52] And if he was standing here, he'd
[34:53] encourage every one of you to study
[34:55] these things that he brought out. And
[34:57] I'm going to just highlight a couple
[34:58] little things here. I'm not going to go
[35:01] anywhere on it, but he brought out about
[35:05] in Gethsemane. It was at the foot of
[35:07] Mount Olives.
[35:11] And on the other side was the Kiddran
[35:13] Valley.
[35:15] And then just beyond that was Goltha.
[35:19] And how that when Jesus came in on Palm
[35:21] Sunday, he came in through Mount Olives.
[35:26] He had to go to Gethsemane on his way to
[35:29] Goltham, but he had to cross that
[35:31] Kiddran Valley. And if you'll study each
[35:34] of those things, you'll find out Kiddran
[35:36] Valley
[35:38] stands for cleansing and judgment and
[35:40] many of other things in the Bible
[35:44] on Gatha and then he went back to Mount
[35:46] Olives and that's where he ascended.
[35:53] He said every single person has to come
[35:55] to your own Gethsemane sometime in your
[35:57] life.
[35:59] Steve encouraged everyone he knew to see
[36:02] their hardships
[36:04] and everything through the lens of the
[36:05] Bible and and lift you up and lift other
[36:08] people up.
[36:10] Steve Love talked about God. If you
[36:13] called him, you'd find out real quickly
[36:15] he wasn't one to talk about sports,
[36:18] talk about other things, but buddy, if
[36:21] you started talking about the Bible, you
[36:23] had two or three hours there and you'd
[36:25] talk.
[36:27] He lived and breathed his faith, loved
[36:29] sharing it with everyone he listened to.
[36:35] Steve leg Steve's legacy is not only the
[36:38] miles he drove, but in the countless
[36:40] lives he touched along the way. He
[36:42] showed us what it looks like to serve
[36:44] others, to live with compassion, and
[36:48] keep God at the center of everything.
[36:52] And the though the road feels much
[36:55] emptier out there without him, his
[36:57] example and prayers will continue to
[36:59] guide each and every one of us.
[37:03] I'm going to miss those phone calls.
[37:05] Caleb, I need you to be my buddy then.
[37:09] Need you to call me.
[37:11] I need somebody. If you could do that
[37:14] and fill that spot, I'd appreciate it.
[37:19] I'm going to miss miss Steve and miss
[37:21] those calls.
[37:24] Appreciate y'all. God bless you.
[37:50] [Music]
[38:04] I know your life
[38:09] on earth was trouble.
[38:15] Only you
[38:19] could know
[38:21] the pain.
[38:24] You weren't afraid
[38:26] [Music]
[38:28] to face
[38:30] the devil.
[38:33] You were no stranger
[38:38] to
[38:40] the rain.

[38:48] on that mountain.

[38:57] on earth is done.

[39:12] love for the father
[39:16] [Music]
[39:17] and the son.

[39:27] the day you left us.
[39:32] We gathered around
[39:36] your grave
[39:38] decree.
[39:41] Wish I could see
[39:46] the angels
[39:48] faces
[39:49] [Music]

[39:55] your sweet
[39:58] voice.

[47:16] [Music]
[47:36] certainly wish to extend our
[47:38] deepest condolences to family and
[47:42] friends of our departed brother.
[47:45] with a man like this. Um, we could be
[47:48] here till midnight talking about what a
[47:51] great guy he was,
[47:53] a life that he lived, people that he
[47:56] affected and influenced.
[47:59] I really, as far as a preacher, you
[48:02] don't dread services like this. As far
[48:05] as for the man himself, of course, for
[48:07] the hurt, for the family, you do. Um
[48:10] he's the type of individual that gives
[48:14] uh preachers and the friends who knew
[48:16] him
[48:18] very adequate information to be able to
[48:21] talk about him. Believe me, I've
[48:24] preached lots of funerals
[48:26] and some people only give you a little
[48:29] bit.
[48:31] And that's so sad to live decades of
[48:33] your life. And then the people that's
[48:36] standing here, whether they're a
[48:37] preacher or whoever they are, they're
[48:39] stuttering and stammering and trying to
[48:41] find something to say.
[48:44] I hope that my life, if I go by the way
[48:48] of the grave, whoever takes my service,
[48:51] I hope they have encyclopedias
[48:55] and encyclopedias
[48:57] and encyclopedias.
[48:59] Don't you? Would you rather it be that
[49:02] way or a post-it note about like that?
[49:07] You said this is the type of man that
[49:09] we're talking about this evening. I want
[49:12] to read to you from Hebrews chap 11
[49:14] verse 32 just to speak to you for a
[49:16] little bit. And no, I'm not going to
[49:18] midnight. I'll give you my word on that.
[49:21] But I just want to speak to you for just
[49:23] just a little bit on another hero of
[49:27] faith
[49:28] goes home.
[49:30] Another hero of faith goes home.
[49:34] Hebrews 11:32.
[49:36] What shall I more say? For the time
[49:39] would fail me to tell of Gideon and of
[49:43] Barack and of Samson and of Jeepa, of
[49:48] David also,
[49:50] and Samuel and of the prophets, who
[49:54] through faith subdued kingdoms,
[49:58] wrought righteousness,
[50:00] obtained promises,
[50:02] stopped the mouths of lions, quench the
[50:07] violence of fire, escaped the edge of
[50:10] the sword. Out of weakness were made
[50:12] strong, waxed valiant
[50:16] in fight,
[50:18] turned to flight. The armies of the
[50:22] aliens, women received their dead raised
[50:26] to life again, and others were tortured.
[50:32] So now here we change,
[50:35] but we're still talking about Hebrews.
[50:38] You see, most Christians would much
[50:40] rather fulfill these first four verses
[50:44] that I read to where they would come
[50:47] right up to death's door or possibly
[50:50] even die
[50:52] and God would raise them from the dead.
[50:55] Or you say, "God, don't do that." Oh,
[50:57] but he does. Actually, we saw it right
[50:59] here in our church right back there some
[51:02] months ago. God does that. What a great
[51:05] testimony it is. It's an awesome thing
[51:07] whenever he does it. But you see, these
[51:10] verses are just as essential and
[51:13] necessary. Now, some of the women, of
[51:15] course, referred to in the New
[51:16] Testament, they received their dead
[51:19] raised back to life again. Some of them
[51:22] stopped the mouths of lions.
[51:24] But was that all of them? No. As a
[51:27] matter of fact, some of them were eaten
[51:31] by lions.
[51:33] Now you see for the mind that tries to
[51:36] understand God just from the concept of
[51:39] the psyche the mind the mental attitude
[51:42] they look at and think it's unfair God
[51:45] should never do this God should never do
[51:47] that and why would people pray and
[51:49] believe and God will not answer it that
[51:52] way but you see God is the only one who
[51:54] knows how to take certain lives and make
[51:58] them fit in these portions of scripture.
[52:01] Now notice how Paul changes when he said
[52:02] women receive their dead raised to life
[52:05] again and others
[52:08] you see brother Steve happened to be one
[52:11] of the others.
[52:13] It's not everybody that God can allow to
[52:17] be tested the way this man was that
[52:20] never serve him.
[52:22] If God let them go through tremendous
[52:24] trials, they'd turn their back on him
[52:27] and go the other way. If a great story
[52:30] can be written about their life and they
[52:32] had cancer and God healed them, oh yes,
[52:35] yes, let that be my life. Let that be my
[52:37] story. But God also has to have heroes
[52:41] like this.
[52:43] Notice Paul says that otherwise others
[52:46] were tortured not accepting deliverance
[52:49] that they might obtain a better
[52:52] resurrection and others.
[52:55] Isn't it amazing that for some of these
[52:58] people, he mentions them by name, but
[53:01] categorically he puts these that were so
[53:04] tested and so tried under a subheading
[53:08] and simply calls them others. And I can
[53:12] assure you there are more others
[53:15] than there are Gideonss. There are more
[53:18] others than there were Jeepa.
[53:23] Are they not heroes?
[53:26] Are they not people of great faith? Even
[53:30] when God would say no.
[53:34] I know for brother Steve and sister
[53:38] Jennifer, I was there with him whenever
[53:41] he was first put in the hospital and
[53:43] they were doing scans and diagnosis and
[53:47] this and that and the other. And I went
[53:50] to the hospital there with them. And
[53:53] both of them so strong in faith,
[53:56] trusting and believing God.
[53:59] And I was with them at the same
[54:01] hospital, just in a different room the
[54:05] very day that brother Steve passed.
[54:08] Now all this time, all this suffering,
[54:11] all the difficulty that they had faced,
[54:14] and you know what? instead of being
[54:17] weaker
[54:19] and instead of being subdued and I don't
[54:23] understand I don't understand why would
[54:26] God do this why would God do that
[54:29] instead of being that way they were
[54:32] stronger in faith
[54:34] than they were when they made the
[54:36] initial visit to the hospital
[54:39] &gt;&gt; and still waiting for answers.
[54:42] That's why I can stand here tonight and
[54:44] tell you another hero
[54:47] &gt;&gt; has made it home.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, everybody couldn't walk
[54:52] where brother Steve walked. I I trust
[54:54] that if God would allow me to have to go
[54:57] that way, that my faith would be as
[55:00] strong and as persistent, not only mine,
[55:03] but also my wife and my children. For
[55:08] the caregivers that watch their loved
[55:10] one and they see their emaciated body,
[55:14] they see them losing their strength
[55:17] losing so much. And and Brother Steve
[55:20] was a man's man.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; He was a man's man. And I know it it
[55:25] broke his heart. It killed him to have
[55:29] to receive help. People in our church
[55:32] help them. And different people help
[55:35] them. And I know him well enough to know
[55:38] he didn't want to receive that at all.
[55:40] It was humiliating.
[55:42] It was embarrassing for people to have
[55:45] to take care of him. But the way he
[55:47] looked at it, if God somehow would get
[55:50] some glory out of it, if God needed
[55:54] somebody a witness, I was thinking about
[55:57] it today that we all Bible readers who
[56:02] love to share great stories about King
[56:05] David and talk about David killing the
[56:08] lion and the bear and the Philistine.
[56:12] But do you know how many lions David
[56:14] killed? Yes, sir.
[56:17] You know how many bears he killed?
[56:21] Know how many giants he killed?
[56:26] &gt;&gt; But that made his legacy.
[56:29] I've killed one line and two bears,
[56:33] but I didn't do it with a slingshot.
[56:37] So, does that make me a hero? It
[56:40] doesn't.
[56:42] It doesn't. No. Because I did not have a
[56:45] piece of leather with a couple of
[56:46] strings on the side of it and the rock
[56:48] in the middle and fling that thing
[56:50] around so fast and let it knock him out.
[56:53] No. And the bear's eyes up in a tree
[56:56] stand about 25 ft high, way out of
[56:58] reach.
[57:00] That's the way a lot of Christians want
[57:01] to be. They want to go to heaven. They
[57:03] don't want to be lost. They don't want
[57:05] to go to hell. But God, treat me like a
[57:08] pansy. Treat me like a baby. I'm I'm I'm
[57:11] God. I can't be handled rough now and
[57:14] remember me. I'm I'm a wee little tiny
[57:16] bitty baby. So don't try me. That's not
[57:19] the kind of man this one here was.
[57:23] He was a real hero. Listen. Paul said
[57:26] others had trial
[57:28] of cruel
[57:31] mockings
[57:32] and scourgings.
[57:35] Yay. Moreover, of bonds
[57:39] and imprisonment.
[57:41] They were stoned.
[57:43] They were sown aunderder.
[57:48] Almighty God would let some of his
[57:51] children go through that. Yeah, we know
[57:53] one of them by name. Isaiah the prophet
[57:57] put him in a hollow log
[58:00] and the heathen sought him in two while
[58:03] he's screaming for mercy.
[58:07] But you see, the carnal mind tries to
[58:09] process all that and say, "I don't
[58:11] understand. I don't understand. A mighty
[58:14] God somehow that would bring him glory."
[58:17] Oh, yes it does. Because he can take the
[58:21] life of that individual and point right
[58:23] to Satan and say, "Look here. I've got a
[58:26] son that'll trust me with his whole
[58:30] life." Anybody
[58:32] can serve God when God says yes to every
[58:35] prayer you pray.
[58:37] I want this. There you go. I want that.
[58:40] There you go. There you go. How's that?
[58:43] Is that soon enough? How you like this?
[58:45] You want it wrapped up in a purple
[58:47] package with pink polka dots. How do you
[58:49] want a child? How do you want it? But
[58:51] God wants some children that they pray
[58:53] and he says, "No,
[58:56] it's not my will.
[58:59] I've got another program for your life.
[59:03] And when God even says no, they say,
[59:07] "You know what, Lord?
[59:09] I trust you so much.
[59:12] And I know your ways are perfect. I
[59:14] don't understand them." And he doesn't
[59:16] ask us to. He asked us to trust him. But
[59:20] can you imagine what it's going to be
[59:23] like one day? our brother. Our brother
[59:27] as I sat in the hospital about two weeks
[59:30] ago and he or I were talking about this
[59:32] scripture here in Hebrews,
[59:35] the spirit of God come down where we was
[59:37] and where we were sitting there talking
[59:39] together
[59:41] and the Lord
[59:44] give me this thought for our brother's
[59:46] funeral.
[59:48] So I knew it wouldn't be long and I went
[59:49] home and told Carol I said the Lord give
[59:52] me his funeral message. She said, "Oh,
[59:54] no." I said, "Yep, he sure did."
[59:58] But as I sat there and looked at him, I
[1:00:00] realized he was the same caliber of man
[1:00:05] as these here. They were stoned. They
[1:00:07] were sown aunderder, were tempted, were
[1:00:10] slain with the sword. They wandered
[1:00:13] about in sheep skins and goat skins
[1:00:18] being destitute,
[1:00:20] afflicted,
[1:00:23] tormented.
[1:00:25] Well, that don't sound like a modern
[1:00:26] Christian, does it? If they ain't got
[1:00:29] new cars and new clothes and the best
[1:00:31] house in the neighborhood and the
[1:00:33] highest end of the culde-sac, they ain't
[1:00:36] serving God.
[1:00:38] But listen to what God's heroes are.
[1:00:41] Remember David as great a man as he was.
[1:00:44] But if you're very familiar with the
[1:00:46] Psalms of David, you'll find out every
[1:00:49] day in the life of a believer is not a
[1:00:52] giant killing day.
[1:00:55] As a matter of fact, there's many more
[1:00:58] non miraculous days than there are
[1:01:02] miraculous ones.
[1:01:04] You may get one line killing day out of
[1:01:08] four or five years, 10 maybe. one bear
[1:01:11] killing day, one Goliath killing day out
[1:01:15] of 85 or 90 years of your life. And the
[1:01:19] rest of it is spent
[1:01:21] sometimes in loneliness and sadness
[1:01:25] seeking God while you're persecuted,
[1:01:28] hated, run down. That was also the
[1:01:32] psalmist David.
[1:01:34] But notice how Paul goes on to describe
[1:01:37] them. of whom the world
[1:01:41] was not worthy.
[1:01:43] They wandered in deserts and in
[1:01:45] mountains and in dens and caves
[1:01:50] of the earth.
[1:01:52] God's heroes.
[1:01:56] They wandered in deserts and in
[1:01:59] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:02:01] earth. And these all having obtained a
[1:02:06] good report through faith
[1:02:09] received not the promise.
[1:02:13] Wow. So they believed and trusted and
[1:02:15] believed and yet God didn't give them
[1:02:18] what they was expecting for it to
[1:02:21] happen.
[1:02:23] You see that's a category of heroes that
[1:02:26] the modernday church knows very little
[1:02:28] about.
[1:02:32] But I pray that God will help some of
[1:02:35] you tonight under the sound of my voice
[1:02:38] to have such a desire to serve the Lord
[1:02:41] Jesus if he needs another man, a woman,
[1:02:44] a boy, a girl. And God was stoop,
[1:02:51] can I trust you?
[1:02:55] Can I trust you when you ask me and I
[1:02:58] say no?
[1:03:00] Will you still love me?
[1:03:05] God having provided some better thing
[1:03:08] for us
[1:03:10] that they with us without us
[1:03:14] are not made perfect.
[1:03:17] The word hero means this.
[1:03:20] A hero is a person or character who
[1:03:24] performs
[1:03:26] great deeds
[1:03:28] or selfless acts
[1:03:31] in the face of danger
[1:03:35] or adversity.
[1:03:38] We know that our military and there's
[1:03:40] people in our church that have received
[1:03:42] different
[1:03:44] military awards,
[1:03:46] the bronze star, the silver star,
[1:03:49] different things that they can get them
[1:03:51] and it's a great honor. Many of them
[1:03:54] give the ultimate sacrifice and they're
[1:03:57] not there to receive that honor. So,
[1:03:59] it's a crying mother leaning on a father
[1:04:04] and someone will receive that honor for
[1:04:07] them.
[1:04:08] But let me just give you a briefing
[1:04:10] before I stop.
[1:04:14] As our brother laid there in the
[1:04:16] hospital and his time came,
[1:04:23] his respiration getting low, his blood
[1:04:25] pressure
[1:04:28] already in his body. It hadn't eaten for
[1:04:31] many days, drank.
[1:04:35] His body no longer needed food and
[1:04:37] water.
[1:04:39] When I was there with him, I kept
[1:04:41] watching him and watching his eyes
[1:04:45] because I've been with many Christians
[1:04:48] when they died.
[1:04:50] And I watch their eyes
[1:04:53] to see what they're looking for. And
[1:04:56] they go to looking around the room
[1:05:01] because they're looking
[1:05:03] for people.
[1:05:07] You see, the Bible says about Abraham
[1:05:09] that Abraham was gathered with his
[1:05:12] people.
[1:05:15] That's what happened to brother Steve.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He was gathered with his people. Now,
[1:05:20] the question is, who is his people? Now,
[1:05:24] those of you that are kin to him by
[1:05:25] flesh, you'll not be gathered in heaven
[1:05:28] just because they were you were kin to
[1:05:31] him by blood, but you have to be kin to
[1:05:34] him by the same new birth.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. that he had.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; So I watched his eyes and I would as I
[1:05:42] stood at the foot of his bed and rubbed
[1:05:44] his feet and then I would go sit on the
[1:05:46] by the chair in the chair and and rub
[1:05:48] his arm and talk to him and I'd watch
[1:05:51] his eyes as he'd roll around and look
[1:05:54] cuz he was looking for things. You see,
[1:05:56] when a believer gets ready to cross,
[1:05:59] they're getting in line to receive their
[1:06:03] award.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; It's not a bronze star. It's not a
[1:06:07] silver one. But the scripture that was
[1:06:10] posted there with our brother's picture
[1:06:12] was I've fought a good fight. I've kept
[1:06:15] the faith. Which of course comes from
[1:06:17] Paul's writings in Timothy. Paul is
[1:06:20] describing it and he said the time of my
[1:06:23] departure is at hand. He was describing
[1:06:27] a ship which he had boarded many times
[1:06:31] to be able to go on a missionary trip.
[1:06:34] the time of my departure. So he would
[1:06:37] walk up and he would be able to see as
[1:06:40] the ship was tied by ropes along the
[1:06:43] moorings, big tall posts that were
[1:06:45] anchored down in the muck of the sea
[1:06:47] there. And they would have it tied and
[1:06:50] they'd have a plank across through
[1:06:52] there. So they're boarding all the
[1:06:54] lading and all the different things that
[1:06:56] they would have. And Paul would get up
[1:06:57] many times and show them his ticket. And
[1:07:00] he said, "That's all death is. That's
[1:07:04] all it is. I'm getting ready to step up
[1:07:08] on the ship of Zion,
[1:07:11] and before I can even realize what's
[1:07:13] happened, it will transport me to the
[1:07:16] other side."
[1:07:18] That's all death is.
[1:07:21] So he could say, "Grave,
[1:07:24] where are you going to make me fear?
[1:07:26] Death, where is your victory? Oh grave,
[1:07:29] where can you be able to make me tremble
[1:07:31] and shake? But he looked at it and said,
[1:07:34] "You are not my master,
[1:07:38] but I'm yours.
[1:07:40] All you are is a vehicle
[1:07:43] to transport me." You imagine a man
[1:07:45] being a Roman citizen. He knows there's
[1:07:47] one death penalty for a Roman citizen.
[1:07:50] They're going to lay his head down in a
[1:07:52] piece of wood which has been shaped out
[1:07:54] like this. And a strong man with a
[1:07:57] double-edged axe is going to remove his
[1:08:00] head in a matter of seconds.
[1:08:03] Imagine him laying it down and looking
[1:08:05] up at that old boy, and say, "Go ahead.
[1:08:09] I'm ready."
[1:08:12] Maybe couldn't hear Sister Jennifer no
[1:08:14] more, his children,
[1:08:17] but he was getting ready
[1:08:19] as he walked up into the ship of Zion.
[1:08:24] breath left his body. But the man that
[1:08:27] we've heard described today and the man
[1:08:29] that touched your life, was it just this
[1:08:32] man here? Was it just this body that you
[1:08:36] see is withered and emaciated
[1:08:40] finding this cancer?
[1:08:42] Was that the end? That wasn't the real
[1:08:45] man anyway.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; All that was was an old coat.
[1:08:51] So what happened to the real man? He
[1:08:54] changed coats.
[1:08:56] He changed coats. So the real Steve
[1:09:01] whenever he went out of this coat.
[1:09:05] So it'd be like this.
[1:09:08] Me slipping it off.
[1:09:11] The coat is laying in the bed.
[1:09:16] Sister Jennifer, the children, the close
[1:09:18] friends gather around him,
[1:09:22] no breath.
[1:09:24] In a few minutes, his fingernails start
[1:09:26] turning. The blue starts working up his
[1:09:28] arms and they think, "Oh no. Oh no."
[1:09:33] But if they could have seen him,
[1:09:36] he'd have been looking back down and
[1:09:37] say, "Don't cry for me. I have put on
[1:09:43] a new coat.
[1:09:47] Why? He made reservations
[1:09:51] years and years ago
[1:09:54] to change coats.
[1:09:57] You imagine that quick the ship of Zion
[1:10:01] took him across
[1:10:03] and he stepped out into the blue grass
[1:10:07] and started raking his hands through the
[1:10:10] grass as the gentle breeze is blowing
[1:10:12] across.
[1:10:14] Here come maybe brother Daniel Nunley.
[1:10:16] Here come brother Calvin Ward. Here come
[1:10:18] this brother, grandfather, an aunt, an
[1:10:21] uncle, whoever was. And they were
[1:10:23] screaming, "Our precious brother.
[1:10:27] Our precious brother."
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And he looked down at himself and his
[1:10:34] hands look new.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; He looked down at his feet
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; and they were new, too.
[1:10:42] And he could reach up to his face and
[1:10:44] his face was not all sunk in.
[1:10:49] Hallelujah.
[1:10:52] Hallelujah. He could look at his hands.
[1:10:54] They were brand new. And here they come
[1:10:58] running and screaming.
[1:11:00] What was it? It was the military parade.
[1:11:06] Don't you see? He was receiving part of
[1:11:10] his military honors.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; What was it? A star? No, it wasn't a
[1:11:16] star or a badge. It was a new body.
[1:11:21] Didn't Jesus said, "Let not your heart
[1:11:24] be troubled."
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; You believe in God, believe also in me.
[1:11:28] For in my father's house are many
[1:11:30] mansions or tabernacles.
[1:11:34] If it were not so, I would have told
[1:11:36] you.
[1:11:37] I go away to prepare a place for you.
[1:11:39] And if I go away, I'll come again and
[1:11:41] receive you unto myself, that where I
[1:11:43] am, there you may be also.
[1:11:48] I guess my question to you is, have you
[1:11:51] made reservations
[1:11:53] to change coats?
[1:11:56] Well, he's been there just a few days in
[1:11:58] the way that we count time, but it's not
[1:12:01] even been seconds if they could count
[1:12:05] time. And he's waiting, waiting. They're
[1:12:09] not going anywhere. Nobody there has a
[1:12:12] watch. Nobody there has a doctor's
[1:12:15] appointment, dentist appointment, car
[1:12:17] appointment. No more appointments.
[1:12:21] And they're waiting for the
[1:12:24] resurrection.
[1:12:27] rest, my brother.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Thank God for a life like this that's
[1:12:34] lived among us. And even though God
[1:12:37] chose not to bring healing and
[1:12:39] manifested in my brother's body, God had
[1:12:44] another plan.
[1:12:46] Let me close. But God also is mindful
[1:12:49] tonight of your broken hearts.
[1:12:54] I know that feeling too.
[1:12:56] But I also can testify that Jesus can
[1:12:59] come and comfort the hearts.
[1:13:03] Can we bow our heads together?
[1:13:08] Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads to
[1:13:11] the dust of the earth,
[1:13:14] we're grateful, Lord Jesus, for the life
[1:13:16] of our precious brother.
[1:13:20] Oh God, I thank you for giving me the
[1:13:24] honor to be able to pastor him. Known
[1:13:28] him and his family now for decades,
[1:13:31] Lord. And I used to travel around and go
[1:13:34] up in Ohio and different places and
[1:13:37] they'd come and visit the services
[1:13:39] before they moved here. And then you put
[1:13:43] it on his heart to come down this way.
[1:13:46] And we're so grateful. Our church has
[1:13:50] been blessed. Father,
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; thank you for a life that's lived among
[1:13:54] us. You don't just want preachers
[1:13:57] that'll be faithful, but you want men,
[1:14:00] women, boys, and girls.
[1:14:04] Another one of your heroes
[1:14:07] has come home. Dear God, we pray for his
[1:14:10] wife, his children. Lord God, his
[1:14:13] mother, his sisters, and in-laws, and
[1:14:17] Lord, for the church family. As a church
[1:14:20] family, we are one weaker now. But we're
[1:14:23] looking for the day, Father, when we'll
[1:14:25] all be gathered together.
[1:14:27] Comfort them, Lord Jesus, as only you
[1:14:30] can do.
[1:14:32] We know as the days go by, they'll go
[1:14:34] through different cycles of of loss. And
[1:14:37] there may be days they'll cry. And other
[1:14:40] days they may even surprisingly feel a
[1:14:44] little bit of anger, maybe a little bit
[1:14:46] of questions. And that's all part of the
[1:14:49] healing process.
[1:14:51] But we know a life like this in reality,
[1:14:55] they'll never get over him. But we pray
[1:14:57] that you'll give them strength to be
[1:14:59] able to deal with that loss. Would you
[1:15:02] Lord Jesus?
[1:15:03] We give you praise, Father.
[1:15:06] Amen.
[1:15:18] You know, Steve and I were real good
[1:15:21] friends.
[1:15:23] First time I met him, we just
[1:15:27] he been listening to my music and
[1:15:31] he was a very special guy.
[1:15:34] One thing we had in common was the
[1:15:35] guitar.
[1:15:39] He would tell me how he loved to hear me
[1:15:41] play and I had no idea who I was talking
[1:15:44] to because I first time I heard him man
[1:15:47] I wanted to hide somewhere but
[1:15:52] there contact with
[1:15:55] people and you they cross your path and
[1:16:00] first time you meet him there's
[1:16:01] something special about him and that was
[1:16:04] Steve.
[1:16:06] He traveled with me some and
[1:16:09] learned to love him and love his spirit.
[1:16:12] How he
[1:16:14] how he knew God.
[1:16:19] So Jennifer asked me to sing this song.
[1:16:24] I was
[1:16:26] on the front porch of my house and it
[1:16:29] was late September
[1:16:33] and uh
[1:16:35] the wind was cool and I looked up in the
[1:16:38] oak tree and had turned the leaves had
[1:16:42] turned red and gold is starting to turn.
[1:16:46] I just across the street and a flower
[1:16:48] had bowed its head to the wind
[1:16:52] and I said, "You know, in a few days
[1:16:57] those leaves all fall,
[1:17:00] the ground will be covered with them.
[1:17:02] They'll be turned brown.
[1:17:04] That flower across the street and my
[1:17:06] neighbor's yard will die."
[1:17:09] That's when
[1:17:11] inspiration spoke to me.
[1:17:14] He said, "Yes,
[1:17:16] but there will be another spring."
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:21] In the spring of my life,
[1:17:28] everything was blooming pure and quiet.
[1:17:34] I run play through fields of green
[1:17:41] listening to the robin sing.
[1:17:46] Then came the summer of my life.
[1:17:54] Lazy days,
[1:17:56] starry nights.
[1:18:00] I thought those days would never end.
[1:18:06] I felt that cold September wind.
[1:18:14] Now I've reached autumn.
[1:18:16] Nights are getting cold.
[1:18:21] Trees are turning red gold.
[1:18:28] It's hard for me to realize
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:35] that I'm getting old.
[1:18:40] Seemed like only yesterday
[1:18:47] my hair wasn't great.
[1:18:54] I'm not going to worry about these
[1:18:56] things.
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:00] There's going to be another spring.
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:06] Oh, there'll be another spring.
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:13] I'll be young again
[1:19:19] cuz I believe the truth.
[1:19:26] I'll have eternal you.
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] Oh, there'll be another spring.
[1:19:38] I'll run again. I'll laugh and sing.
[1:19:44] In a place where time won't mean a
[1:19:47] thing,
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:51] there will be another
[1:19:55] spring.
[1:19:57] [Music]
