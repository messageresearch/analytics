[44:46] can't explain
[44:47] but the lord loves us so much he sent us
[44:50] his little rain
[44:50] and i got these mansanas from the field
[44:52] where i work for my familia
[44:54] and is what a treat what a treat
[44:57] how many love the lord
[45:01] you know sometimes i start to think
[45:05] about his love
[45:06] and i wonder i wonder a lot of things
[45:09] but this specific thing that i wondered
[45:11] i wonder how sometimes god is going to
[45:13] get through people
[45:14] do you know some people that are just a
[45:16] little you know
[45:18] you know what i'm talking about you know

[45:24] lord told me a secret brother miguel
[45:27] the lord told me his secret system the
[45:29] lord is going to reach them
[45:31] through you the lord wants to reach them
[45:36] through you the lord wants to use your
[45:38] hands and your feet
[45:40] your manus and your patas without your
[45:44] mouth how can god speak
[45:47] so that's how it is with our family and
[45:49] that's what i'm learning that god loves
[45:51] them so much
[45:52] that he wants me to show them his love
[45:57] sometimes it's hard but then i remember
[45:59] his great amour
[46:00] that he would come down from his throne
[46:02] of glory
[46:03] and fill us with his holy spirit
[46:07] that's why i sing pores
[46:23] here's an apple
[46:34] [Music]
[46:35] [Applause]
[46:40] um
[46:46] [Music]
[47:00] [Music]
[47:03] we're all sinners but he loved us
[47:06] and that's why we must press on and love
[47:09] one another
[47:10] because there's no other way they can be
[47:12] reached but through a member
[47:14] of the body of jesus christ

[1:02:46] i've got the living life in me
[1:02:49] let me ask a question to you okay and he
[1:02:52] said have you been baptized
[1:02:55] and i thought i was a baby
[1:02:59] you know they threw
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:15] i was better he said that's not correct
[1:03:18] i said what you talking about tell me
[1:03:22] so then he said you must be baptized in
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:26] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:03:31] so i said i want what you have if you
[1:03:33] didn't have any grapes
[1:03:35] so he took me to his church and he
[1:03:38] baptized me in the name of the lord
[1:03:42] jesus christ
[1:03:44] submerged in water not one toe was
[1:03:47] sticking out
[1:03:49] and then a couple of years later
[1:03:52] you married
[1:04:00] amen he was awesome easy
[1:04:03] as awesome and that's why henry's
[1:04:05] handsome too
[1:04:06] i am i yes he was i look just like him
[1:04:10] oh
[1:04:10] teensy but more important than looking
[1:04:13] like him he instills something in me
[1:04:16] so important that i'll never forget he
[1:04:18] instilled
[1:04:20] a love and an understanding of how
[1:04:23] god's channel operates here on earth
[1:04:26] because god can reach anybody him
[1:04:28] sitting on his throne in heaven
[1:04:30] he had to send his spirit miho to come
[1:04:33] and dwell
[1:04:34] in human flesh in members of though did
[1:04:36] you feel that you felt those cheeks up
[1:04:38] in your food
[1:04:41] let me tell you where it all started oh
[1:04:44] the lord jesus christ
[1:04:45] when he died and he was buried and he
[1:04:48] resurrected he told his disciples go on
[1:04:52] terry in jerusalem
[1:04:54] and the holy spirit will come and fill
[1:04:56] you with power
[1:04:57] so so they were obedient and they went
[1:05:01] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:05:03] come fire came down
[1:05:04] fire came and baptized baptized
[1:05:07] everybody in that room
[1:05:09] and when they were baptized they were
[1:05:11] speaking in tongues and they were
[1:05:12] dancing
[1:05:13] and being filled with the holy ghost the
[1:05:15] people looked around and said these are
[1:05:17] locos
[1:05:18] they're crazy but i understand what
[1:05:21] they're saying people from mesopotamia
[1:05:23] from this place from that place they
[1:05:24] understood what they were saying in
[1:05:26] different languages
[1:05:29] and then peter came out
[1:05:32] bold and full of the holy ghost
[1:05:36] and they asked him what can we do to
[1:05:39] receive
[1:05:40] such power and he said repent
[1:05:44] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:05:47] christ
[1:05:48] for the forgiveness and remission of
[1:05:49] your sins and you shall receive
[1:05:51] the gift of the holy ghost amen
[1:05:55] and he said this is a promise for you
[1:05:58] and unto your children
[1:05:59] and until your children's children and
[1:06:01] to as many as the lord your
[1:06:04] god shall call thank you jesus
[1:06:08] i love it oh it was so amazing
[1:06:12] and then after that guess what
[1:06:15] 3 000 souls were brought to jesus
[1:06:19] i came with you yes and peter went back
[1:06:22] there so he can baptize them
[1:06:25] because there was a lot of work to do
[1:06:27] yes a lot of work three thousand people
[1:06:30] three 000. why didn't god just send an
[1:06:34] angel
[1:06:35] why did he have to use peter good
[1:06:37] question because he needs
[1:06:39] a member of the body
[1:06:42] it's like this radio this is
[1:06:48] it's just a box but if it's tuned into
[1:06:51] the right channel
[1:06:54] and the current and the radio signals
[1:06:58] reach the box
[1:07:00] we can hear music we can hear news
[1:07:04] we can hear different things from all
[1:07:06] over the world but it
[1:07:07] there's nothing really special about the
[1:07:09] radio it's the information and the music
[1:07:11] that we want to hear
[1:07:13] and it's like me and you we're just
[1:07:15] radio
[1:07:16] we need to tune ourselves to the right
[1:07:18] station
[1:07:20] can i get it amen amen tune ourselves
[1:07:23] into the right station
[1:07:25] and then the lord can speak to his
[1:07:27] people
[1:07:28] he needs hands and feet me look let me
[1:07:30] tell you come here see this young
[1:07:32] strapping
[1:07:33] a dinosaur let's say this is felipe
[1:07:37] i love felipe not garcia but this
[1:07:41] philippe c
[1:07:42] we love felipe garcia where's my bible
[1:07:44] amiha bring me my bible
[1:07:46] my bible i'm gonna tell you the story of
[1:07:48] philip
[1:07:49] so philip was a nice little man just
[1:07:52] like you
[1:07:52] okay we're gonna go to the book of acts
[1:07:56] here we are okay and the book of acts it
[1:07:58] talks about felipe
[1:08:00] and the angel came to philip and he said
[1:08:04] philip go to the desert
[1:08:07] and you will find something there i need
[1:08:08] you to do so the angel sent philip to
[1:08:11] the desert
[1:08:12] and when he got there there was an
[1:08:15] ethiopian eunuch
[1:08:17] now i want you to understand this eunuch
[1:08:19] he was in charge of
[1:08:20] all the money of the queen of sheba's
[1:08:22] treasury
[1:08:23] and when he got there he was reading the
[1:08:25] book of isaiah in the bible
[1:08:29] and philip looked at him and said oh
[1:08:31] okay this is what the angel wanted me to
[1:08:33] do
[1:08:34] so he said hey eunick do you know what
[1:08:38] you're reading
[1:08:39] and then he said well how can i unless a
[1:08:42] man
[1:08:43] explains it to me the eunuch had more
[1:08:45] revelation than most of us
[1:08:47] he said a man needs to explain so he
[1:08:49] invited him on his chariot
[1:08:52] so he can sit with him and explain the
[1:08:54] word of god
[1:08:55] now listen listen listen it's so
[1:08:56] important he was in charge of all the
[1:08:59] money from the queen of sheba
[1:09:01] he was the treasury so it would be like
[1:09:03] the treasurer from the white house
[1:09:07] our president's treasurer in charge of
[1:09:08] all the money in fort knox in the united
[1:09:10] states of america
[1:09:12] talking to you or to you or to you and
[1:09:14] saying hey
[1:09:15] step into my helicopter and talk to me
[1:09:17] about the bible
[1:09:20] that's how amazing it was and when he
[1:09:22] talked to him the eunuch
[1:09:23] was burning in his chorus
[1:09:26] i'm sorry mijito that i scare you and he
[1:09:29] said
[1:09:30] look look i need to be baptized and
[1:09:33] felipe said
[1:09:34] well if you believe with all your heart
[1:09:35] i believe he said there's water right
[1:09:38] there baptize me
[1:09:39] and so felipe took him into the water
[1:09:42] and in the name of who
[1:09:43] the lord jesus christ he baptized them
[1:09:47] and he was filled with the holy ghost
[1:09:54] why did god have descendants why didn't
[1:09:56] god send an
[1:09:57] angel to the eunuch to translate for him
[1:10:00] oh why
[1:10:02] why did the angel not go to the eunuch
[1:10:04] why did the angel go to felipe
[1:10:07] because god needs a member
[1:10:10] of the body
[1:10:13] he has to use hands and feet human lips
[1:10:16] flesh and bones mija oh
[1:10:20] that's how he works
[1:10:26] very good job my life what's the next
[1:10:28] story that we were talking about
[1:10:29] i think cornelius i love this one
[1:10:33] he was a roman soldier almost as handsy
[1:10:36] as you're apparent
[1:10:37] almost as handsome as europa i said
[1:10:41] almost he was a good man
[1:10:46] this roman soldier was a good man and he
[1:10:49] would pray to the lord
[1:10:50] and he would give offering to the poor
[1:10:53] and
[1:10:53] they loved him so much because he had a
[1:10:55] good heart and he would pray to the lord
[1:10:58] and one day in a vision the angel of the
[1:11:02] lord
[1:11:02] appeared to this gentile
[1:11:06] and the angel told him cornelius
[1:11:11] the lord has heard your prayers and the
[1:11:14] lord has seen all the arms and the
[1:11:16] offerings and the things you donate to
[1:11:17] the poor people
[1:11:19] you are a good man and all those things
[1:11:21] have built up a monument
[1:11:22] a memorial in heaven before the throne
[1:11:25] of god
[1:11:26] that means every good deed you do
[1:11:28] michael is building up a memorial in
[1:11:31] heaven even when it hurts
[1:11:34] even when you don't want to give it but
[1:11:36] if you give it with a pure heart you're
[1:11:38] building up a memorial before the throne
[1:11:41] of
[1:11:41] god so that god can remember
[1:11:44] you and remember you and remember
[1:11:47] you and you and you and he told them god
[1:11:50] will answer your prayer
[1:11:52] but you have to go
[1:11:55] look for peter he's going to be in such
[1:11:59] and such a house
[1:12:00] in such a such a town with such and such
[1:12:02] a man next to the ocean
[1:12:04] go find him and he'll tell you what to
[1:12:05] do
[1:12:07] why didn't the angel just tell him
[1:12:10] himself yes
[1:12:11] i was asking myself he had a vision of
[1:12:14] the angel
[1:12:15] why didn't god tell him how to get the
[1:12:17] holy ghost in his vision
[1:12:19] because god member
[1:12:23] of the body and when the two soldiers
[1:12:26] went to get
[1:12:27] peter peter came back to the casa of
[1:12:29] cornelius
[1:12:30] and when they were in the house of
[1:12:32] cornelius
[1:12:34] cornelius brought his nana and his tata
[1:12:36] and his theo and his friends and his
[1:12:38] cousins and his uncles and his neighbors
[1:12:39] and the people that were in the army
[1:12:41] anybody he can fit in his house
[1:12:42] and when peter got there he said pedro
[1:12:46] i've been waiting a long time anything
[1:12:48] that you say
[1:12:49] we're gonna believe that it's god's
[1:12:51] message to us
[1:12:52] amen amen what faith
[1:12:55] with faith he'd never met the man but
[1:12:57] the angel told him to go find him
[1:12:59] and god needs a member
[1:13:02] of the body so peter preached to him
[1:13:06] opened up his lips
[1:13:07] and the holy ghost came down and
[1:13:10] baptized everyone
[1:13:12] they were all filled with the holy ghost
[1:13:14] these gentiles
[1:13:15] filled with that fire so peter said well
[1:13:18] if they receive the holy ghost like me
[1:13:20] and you
[1:13:21] i guess we can't deny them our to get
[1:13:23] baptized
[1:13:24] so they baptize them in water why
[1:13:26] because that's god's provided way
[1:13:28] acts 2
[1:13:31] repent and be baptized
[1:13:35] in the name of jesus and you shall
[1:13:36] receive the gift of the
[1:13:39] holy ghost hey man you're getting it
[1:13:41] you're getting it
[1:13:42] oh my god
[1:13:49] it's so simple where's my peter
[1:13:52] mija you have a family here filled with
[1:13:55] the holy ghost that loves you
[1:13:57] if you want to have that experience with
[1:13:59] the lord
[1:14:00] all you have to sing is
[1:14:04] lord my heart

[1:17:22] [Music]
[1:17:29] he can come inside and change your life
[1:17:32] because he's the high priest of our
[1:17:35] confession you'll confess it
[1:17:39] and it's yours but an angel couldn't
[1:17:42] come and reveal that to you
[1:17:45] god had to use a man god had to use a
[1:17:47] woman
[1:17:49] god had to use a body willing to be used
[1:17:51] by the holy spirit
[1:17:55] because it's just an angel
[1:17:58] but what if it wasn't just an angel
[1:18:02] what if it was jesus christ himself in a
[1:18:05] spirit form
[1:18:07] he sent his holy spirit but let me give
[1:18:09] you this
[1:18:11] there was a man named saul of tarsus oh
[1:18:14] my favorite
[1:18:16] and he was attacking all the cristianos
[1:18:20] and he had a paper that said he was
[1:18:23] allowed to put them in jail
[1:18:24] and to imprison them and to kill them
[1:18:28] he did not like the christians and he
[1:18:30] was doing everything he can to put them
[1:18:31] away
[1:18:32] and one day he was going to the road to
[1:18:34] damascus
[1:18:36] and on that road to damascus nana
[1:18:40] what happens next okay
[1:18:44] that's a good one he was on the road to
[1:18:46] damascus
[1:18:48] and the pillar of fire jesus christ
[1:18:51] himself he
[1:18:52] came and took him off of his high horse
[1:18:56] and he said soul of thor's saul why do
[1:18:59] you persecute me
[1:19:00] and saul said i said jesus christ who
[1:19:03] are you lord
[1:19:04] and he said my name is jesus who you
[1:19:06] persecute
[1:19:08] and he said oh lord what do you want me
[1:19:10] to do lord and the light was so bright
[1:19:13] that it blinded his eyes
[1:19:15] and he could not see and the lord said
[1:19:18] go to this role down the road called
[1:19:22] straight and my servant ananias is going
[1:19:24] to lay his hands on you
[1:19:27] and you'll receive your sight and you'll
[1:19:29] get the holy ghost you'll be baptized in
[1:19:31] my name
[1:19:32] and you'll receive your commission but
[1:19:34] my question is this
[1:19:36] when he was there in the room all by
[1:19:38] himself
[1:19:39] i wonder if he knew god's plan when
[1:19:42] ananias walked in the room
[1:19:44] ananias laid his hands on him
[1:19:48] and he received the holy ghost and his
[1:19:50] eyes were
[1:19:51] open and he could see again and then he
[1:19:54] got
[1:19:55] baptized and i wonder when he got
[1:19:58] baptized
[1:19:59] and he was under the water praising the
[1:20:03] lord being
[1:20:04] filled with the spirit if he knew that
[1:20:06] he was going to be the apostle paul
[1:20:10] who was going to write the scripture
[1:20:12] that we have today
[1:20:14] see god needed a man but why didn't
[1:20:18] jesus on the road to damascus
[1:20:20] open his eyes give him the commission
[1:20:22] and fill him with the holy ghost
[1:20:25] because he needs a member of the
[1:20:31] do you body it yes not even jesus who's
[1:20:34] able to open up his eyes of course he
[1:20:36] could he's god almighty
[1:20:38] but he didn't even when jesus was
[1:20:40] raising lazarus from the dead
[1:20:42] he had the power of resurrection but he
[1:20:44] said
[1:20:45] maria marta move the stone
[1:20:49] we all have a part to play it's not like
[1:20:51] he could have just exploded the stone
[1:20:53] and rose lazarus from the dead
[1:20:55] we all have a part to play because
[1:20:58] even
[1:21:05] yes don't say no you're not just a
[1:21:07] little kid
[1:21:08] even you mama yes sir we all are part
[1:21:12] of that body oh can i get a amen

[1:21:51] same holy spirit brought a baptism
