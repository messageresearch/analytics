this morning I'm going to read in uh Revelation chapter 10 it's going to be this seventh verse but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophet amen amen we can be seated I'm greeting you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm saying that I'm greeting you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen my name is brother Jo I'm from South Africa I know that those that were with us this the morning on Sunday Pho we were with you you guys over there in Phoenix Tabernacle Phoenix I thank all the associate pastor and all the committee to once again give me the opportunity to speak to you this morning I know it is a great responsibility to open a ceremony like this one year really we do wait upon the Lord because the Bible says those that wait upon the Lord they will renew their strength for the [Applause] Lord and I believe that the Lord is going to renew our strengths the subject of this morning you want to know who is the messenger the angel in the Revelation 7 who is the seventh angel of Revelation 107 apyp I'm going to tell you something brother sister that is really a great privilege to know the days in which you're living in to know the angels that the Lord has sent us today and to know the the message that the angel has brought to us because this is what is Grace because Grace is to know the message of your day and the angel that the Lord has sent us as you're reading in Revelation 10 from the first verse to the seventh verse you'll see that there is two angels there is a Celestial angel that descends that is gathered with a cloud around him and descend with an open book and cries with a loud voice and the Bible says that he cries like a loud lion [Music] yeah and in verse seven there is another angel that is the seventh this is what they say at the voice of the seventh angel count when is going to H the Trump you see there is two Angels Heavenly Angel and an angel of [Music] Earth and the the Heavenly Angel is the Lord Jesus Christ is the mighty angel is the one that descends with the open book and the Earthly angel that is the seventh [Music] angel of Revelation 107 do not confuse themy the angel of Revelation 11:15 because Revelation the angel of Revelation 11:15 speaks as well of the seventh angel that sounds the trumpet and this is not the angel that concern [Music] us because the prophet says the trumpets is for [Music] Israel but the seals is for the Gentiles and we got to make difference of those the angel of of Revelation 11:15 does not concern to us now who is the angel of Revelation 10:7 brother says said that the word angel means [Music] messenger when we see that the word angel means messenger it can be an Heavenly messenger or it can be a Earthly messenger and the angel of Revelation chapter 107 is an Earthly messenger it's a man it's a brother it's a me it's a it's a messenger that has been sent to the church it's a messenger that has been sent to the seven Church age we know that there is seven Church ages and at each age there has been a messenger for each one of them Ephesus at his messenger at his m his Messenger as his Messenger as well as his Messenger as well Philadelphia his Messenger as well also as [Music] messenger can we say Amen [Applause] we know that the me the message ofus is Paul for SM isus foram is Philadelphia that is Wesley but we had to know as well the messenger that has been sent for laia and I cannot you my words to say [Music] that that the message of Revelation 107 is the same of the one in Revelation 3:14 and Revelation 3:14 it says to the Church of Leia I'm writing to the Church of Leia I'm writing right to the age of lodia [Music] [Music] right and we see that the angel of Revelation 10:7 is the same one in [Music] 3:14 is the same is among the the the angel of the churches now notice the difference between the others the difference between Luther the difference between Wesley is not a reform [Music] reformator he's not a reformer but he is a re Revelator he is a [Music] Seer he is a prophet because God says in Amos 37 that does God does nothing before revealing [Music] it his secrets to his servants the prophets and Revelation 10:7 says that the day of the seventh angel as it shall begin to s the Trump the mystery of God will be accomplished as he has promised to his servants the prophets so Revelation 10:7 and Amos 37 is the same thing it's the same thing we can't listen to what the prophet says in the church ages at page there are 316 in French the sixth angel that will sound the Trump is a Celestial is found in Revelation 9913 and the seventh of these angels is found in Revelation 11:15 the one that we have here in Revelation 17th is the messenger of the seventh age is a man is the messenger of the seventh age he must bring a word he must bring a message from from on behalf of God and this in his message in his ministry will will finish the mystery of God as he has announced it to his servants the prophets god with treat this God with treat this last one as a prophet because he is a Prophet this is what Paul was in the first age and in the last age there was also going to be one in Amos 3 3 to 7 [Music] do we sound the trumpet in the in the in the city without the people being in the [Music] trouble with in the city happen some Misfortune uh without God being the author without God being the author because the Lord the Lord does nothing before revealing it to His prophets so this messenger is a prophet and where is this promise and his promised in Malachi 456 I will send you Elijah the Prophet this is his promise Malachi 4 he comes to restore the faith of the children to the father he came to restore and what did he restore the baptism in the L of the Lord Jesus the of the of God communion all the thing that has been Disturbed throughout the ages and he came with the spirit of Elijah upon him because because is Elijah sent for the age of the Gentiles because you're going to notice you're going to notice that the age in which we living in the the condition of this age are the same of the the condition of the age of aab and it was a that time that God has sent elah it's the time of Rus that God has send John the Baptist and in this age God also sent us the spirit of Elijah and this message of of Revelation 10 verse 7 is the same of the one in Malachi 4 is the same person it's the same promise Revelation 10 Revelation 3:14 and Malachi 3:4 Mal 4 yeah Mal 4 it's the same person he comes to reveal the secret that has been hiden throughout the ages we're going to go through the message Bridge 28 so we see the seventh angel the seventh angel must necessar be a prophet so that the word of God must come to him sorry not not not not a priest not a pope no nobody else cannot receive it the way the word does not come to those ones the word of God only comes to prophets always always promised one and when it will come he would take the mystery of God as the church would be in total confusion with all those denominations he bring back the faith of the bring back the Fai of the child the children to the Fai of the children to the fathers then then judgment going to Smith the [Music] world and the world going to be burned then judgment going to be upon the mean ones during the Millennium the prophet says that he is a prophet he's come to reveal the word and this message going to bring us back to the faith of the father before the coming of before the the the start of the millennium [Music] and the Jud going to walk upon those mean ones it is to the seventh angel that the mystery of God has been given and he will finish all the Mysteries that have been left in suspense all along of the ages of denomination reveal the word it will bring us back to the faith of the [Applause] father will bring he will bring back everything that has been left out in suspense the first seal in page 192 paragraph paragraph Okay notice notice notice not so [Music] notice this last message of the last Church age is not a a reformer it's a prophet not a reformer the others were reformers but they were not Prophets if there were the word of God come to the prophets it's for such reason they kept baptizing using father son Holy Spirit and all those things that means that there were reformers and not prophets but in the last days there will it will be most important a prophet to take the mysteries of God and restore them because the Mysteries as been known only by the prophets then this man must must come now you know what I mean to say canot be a [Music] reformer must be a prophet because it must be someone that has this gift that is here it must be there it must be there and then understands the word God had to send us a prophet according to Mal 4 according to Revelation 107 he must come to reveal the Mysteries everything that has not been touched by the reformers as the angel of Revelation 10:7 comes the prophet said that he comes to do two things the first one it will bring back the faith of the children to the faith of the fathers is the restoration it must restore the word and the second thing it must reveal the [Music] Mysteries has been hidden in the seven Thunders and brother Bram said that those Mysteries [Music] there that will literally give us the faith of the Rapture because we have to have a faith that must change us must transform us that's the faith of rapture and that faith of rapture will come with the message of the seventh angel by the revelation of the seven Thunders that's where the faith of the Rapture is hidden me and is this messenger that comes to reveal Thunders is the messenger is The Messer that comes to reveal the seven Thunders you know in the Bible it is said when he cried the seven Thunder other that [Music] voice but when the seven had othered that voice Bible said that John was about to [Music] write but the voice told him John you know right what the seven Thunders said seal all what the seven Thunders had said but at the day of the seventh [Music] angel will shout of the trumpet the mystery of God will be revealed as he announced it to his servant Prophets The Mystery of God must have been been declared at the opening of [Music] theeven The Mystery of God had to be finished to the message of the seventh angel when he was proclaiming the message the mystery of God was finished and the prophet says not at the beginning of his ministry one is going to be proclaiming the message and what is that message is the opening of the [Music] seals the revelation of the seven Thunders when he will begin to Proclaim them the mystery of God will be [Music] finished the prophet said what is the mystery a mystery is a is a is the true it's a Bible it's a Bible truth that has been divinely revealed but despite the [Music] Revelation that contains a supernatural [Music] element you always have a supernatural element of Jesus Christ baptism in the name of Jesus Christ SE the revelation of Babylon the grand the reation of Babylon great Bon the mystery of rapture the mystery of [Music] predestination the mystery of marriage and divorce The Mystery of the the the Bride of the [Music] Gentiles that is composed of both the Jews and the Gentiles The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Spirit without Sensations those are Mysteries the returning of the Holy Spirit of the of the pillow of fire the returning of the pillow of fire it is a mystery those were mystery that had to be revealed by the seventh angel he had to reveal them during the proclamation of his message not at the beginning of his ministry but look at Jesus Christ Jesus at the beginning of his ministry it was healing were Miracles there was multiplying bread and people were acclaiming to that Jesus of Nazareth a great prophet the the man of Galilee that's where the people used to like but one day when it start to say to know the the the thought of their hearts the others were starting to back away from him they were starting to abandon him at the end it was s if you eat my flesh and if you did not drink of my blood not have life in yourself the prophet when when he said those words everybody start abandoning him they were starting saying this man here he want us to eat his flesh he want us to be cannibals he want us to to to drink his blood that it was not a good Prophet The Prophet says that Jesus never explained that he never explained that he even said to Peter and the [Music] others but you why do you why do you still why do you still stay here go away as the others go away I not need you go away and said Lord Lord to whom do we go to whom we will go to whom we will go it's you and only you that has the word of the of the eternal life if you have found that this message eternal life will say said will I where will I go [Music] Lord here the eternal life they have given us a prophet you have sent us a message nowhere else to go listen in the message that are in prison we are going towards the end I know that there is another servant of God that must come notice it is the message of the seventh angel that had to reveal the seventh the seventh seals Revelation 107 that's where you will find them see you seen that that angel there was descending man that set his foot upon the Water upon the sea and upon the Earth it was Christ he had a rainow above his header him you'll finding in Revelation one with the r above his head he had the the aspect he has the aspect of the the stone of and S the stone of Jasper and sardam and so forth he came he said a fo on the sea upon the Seas and fruit upon the upon the Earth and raised up his hand he had R above his head [Music] and there was showing an allance a covenant it was the angel of the Covenant and that was Christ that sorry and that has become uh inferior to the angels so it can suffer so that he can accept to suffer so he can accept to suffer and at the message of the seventh angel that is the Earthly messenger the messenger that is on Earth as the less and seventh Church age at the beginning of his ministry and at the beginning of this one year on Earth at that moment there the mystery of God of his had to be devolved and there was a that time that the mystery of God had to be revealed he come to reveal the Mysteries he want to restore everything he want to restore the faith of the children to bring us back to the faith of the father you know brother R says when he went to the sixth Dimension and that the people the saint were coming to hug him he asked the question and said will Paul be judged and said if those of Paul will enter mine as well will [Music] enter are we saying amen if those of Paul enter in we as well will enter in yes brother it must not be the of Paul enter as well you must get in he as well must get in because we have received the faith of the fathers the faith of the Apostles and and above that Paul did not preach the Seven Seals Paul did not preach the seven Thunders Paul did not preach the third pool Paul did not preach God within the flesh but we do have all of that so we can say that we have more than what Paul and Paul said without us you couldn't you could achieve Perfection that means Perfection of Paul we're depending upon you the Perfection of Peter depending on you and my brother so without us they could not achieve [Music] Perfection how to how to recognize this messenger how to recognize this seventh messenger how will we recognize him when God sends a messenger or when he wants to send a messenger he never says I will send Emanuel Fernando no no God does not do it that way God gives a promise God gives the word when the messenger comes it does not he does not be himself upon the chest I'm the one that God has sent it does not do that [Applause] way because God works in Simplicity when when the messenger comes he presents the word he presents the word they said what this is what God Said what says take Moses for instance God never said to Abraham that I will send Moses but he said to him that your people will be in the in the in a in a in the strange in the Str Strange Land but I will bring them out after 400 years and I will judge the country in in the land in which they are and when Moses encounters the pillow of fire he just went there and he delivered the promise and the people had to see Moses and see that he is the [Music] one and follow Moses and John's Baptist comes and the the Pharisees send people to ask him are you the Christ are you El elah who are you and the answer of the people were it was not saying well I'm the one who who comes before no no no he said I am the voice that cry in the desert he had presented the word Esau 40 3 Jesus himself and never said that it was me but he said the Lord your God said that will bring a prophet see a virgin will bring bring birth and was starting to show them the word the word the word the word and when Luther come he said to the Catholics that the just will live by faith that was ab4 then for our age for this time here when when the messenger of the seventh Church comes us Revelation 10:7 Revelation 3:14 Mali 5-6 46 Hebrews 13 Luke Luke 1730 apyp Revelation 181 and bring us back to the time of Genesis Genesis 18 it shows that what happened in the time of lot will also happen at the the of the coming of the Lord coming of the son of of the son of man and we are and we are as at the time of L this morning we have the same condition of Sodom and gorra see how people are living today there must be a prophet in the camp the same condition of Jezebel and are the same here on Earth today there must be a prophet here on the earth and who is that Prophet who is that angel what is that message and that messenger there without hiding to you my brothers without it's the prophet William Mar he is the messenger of this [Music] time is the angel that God has [Music] sent receive him for your blessings receive him the grace that God has sent us if you have never heard of it my brother I'm telling you this morning for your [Music] rapture believe in the mess of William Bram God has said to Israel that Israel trust in the Lord you will you for you'll be fortified to this prophet and you will succeed even to have success in this age here for the bride you must trust Mal you must be in trust with William Bram William is the seventh is the last one there is not another [Music] messenger there will not be another Prophet because at the right hand of God there was only seven there were set Messengers there were seven candles there were seven stars there was not eight there were not six there were not 10 there were not 10 there were only seven and the seventh is William Maran Bram this is why the Bible says that at the day of the seventh angel at the voice of the seventh angel not at the time of the eighth one not at the day of the ninth one but at the at the day of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the M trumpet the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets the seventh age is here the seventh angel has come God has sent us to sent us to us and we have his message [Music] take the message eat the message eat the message eat the message and become one with the message because the Rapture is not is not far [Music] away the Rapture is no longer far away the Rapture is closed at the door if you never heard that there word a seventh angel I'm telling you that God has sent has sent us a seventh [Music] angel receive his message prepare you for the Rapture and you'll be a candidate for heaven may the Lord bless [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you we thank the Lord for our brother brother Joel would you please [Music] stand we have a another Minister that'll be speaking this morning it's our brother Pedro pinetta Chavez Pedro petta Chavez from Durango Mexico Durango Mexico amen only believe as he is being welcome man oh be oh be all things are possible oh [Music] only [Music] take your may take your place we're going to continue but he was mentioning that a mystery is a truth that has been divinely revealed but also Revelations 10:7 that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God will be revealed and that that scripture goes with uh Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God shall do nothing unless he reveal it his secret to the Servants of prophets because a mystery is equivalent to a to a secret and according to God's word according to the Bible in Isaiah 4515 or 14 more or less truly you are the god that covers himself and to cover means to hide you are the god that hides that's why the word of God the Bible in Isaiah I believe 28 he said this is how the word of God would be just a little bit here a little bit there or they're a little they're a little it's like putting together a puzzle one Prophet mentioned one thing another Prophet mentioned another that's why the Lord Jesus Christ said I worship you father who hid these things from the wise and the learned and you've revealed it you've revealed it to your your children or babes so truly this Bible is a mystery we are in the days of the voice of the seventh angel every time that I open a book every time I grab a message book a tape and I hear and I listen to the voice of the seventh declaring the Mysteries because the voice of the seventh angel came to declare the Mysteries so then every message that we read spoken by God's Prophet will is a mystery being known every message because all of the Mysteries all of the Loose Ends were going to be declared for for as simple as a message may appear to be it is mystery being revealed or declared it doesn't matter which message as simple as it may appear a mystery being declared and we need it that's why the Apostle Paul said speaking to Timothy all scripture is inspired of God and is Meek or for teaching to correct and to encourage to the end of the God's man to be perfect and wholly prepared for All Good Deed so all scripture in its time and moment we need it there are occasions where you might say c i I love a certain subject that's because that's what you're needing at that moment there were things that did not call my attention but with time I I love them because the time came when I needed them I want to read you something from God's prophet and says I'm taking this from the message of Grace because we know this is a message of Grace I I I don't think I have a dollar bill in my pocket oh yeah here do I have a dollar forgive me on the back side of this dollar you'll see the Seal of the United States on the left side right amen the Seal of the United States we are in a great country brothers and it's not only great because it produces dollars it's great and it's Holy Ground because God's Prophet set foot here America is parallel to Isel America was founded upon the the foundation of theost prophet that's why God could raise up a prophet here because the bases replac for America kept the fillment God spoke in the English language in our time it's a great country it is a privilege to be in the United States amen amen the easi you here food is very inexpensive if you go to a buffet here you might spend what you probably earned in just a couple and eat at a buffet if we if we put that in equivalent if someone in Mexico goes to a they're not going to spend what they work what they earned in two hours they're going to spend what they earned all day that's the equivalent the the food is inexpensive where it's expensive is when you buy a home in here once brother Paul Garcia j mentioned Paul G Garcia Jr he said it's easier for you in mexo to to obtain a home house than it is for us in the United States I was living here for seven years and he said he spoke a great truth but as far as the basic things it's very inexpensive and that's why we understand why so many people want to come here that's the attraction but if they only knew that there is a greater attraction here here stood 100 Angels bringing all of the Mysteries seven angels I was born in Mexico and I want to say something with all of my Mexican Pride even though we have citizenship of Heaven I want to say that in the old times Arizona New Mexico they belong to Mexico but they are better off with the United States because with Mexico they would have been Catholic but I have that little PR if you look at it that way the seven angels they came down in [Applause] Mexico and in Mexico we have a shield of an eagle eating up a [Applause] snake that's why we as Mexicans hearing our brother ber Garcia he says I used to hate Mexico I didn't want anything to do with it but God sent him to Mexico and if there's a Ministry that's been helped by the ministry of brother it's us Mexicans and we appreciate God greatly for this the prophet of God in he spoke about the Hispanic he said oh to Hispanic you you are humble you you you are satisfied with just the crumbs blessed be the Lord God bless and I congratulate all those speak because they have something very precious privilege very special we that are hard-headed we we we hear Brother Bernie G Garcia and you read brother Bron's messages and it helps you to appreciate that Ministry if it had not been for God's prophet this would be a closed book that's why there's been so many denominations because it's a closed book but through brother BR message this book has been opened amen brothers and through the ministry of brother who who opens up to so you you understand brother Brandon better now I'm speaking about my experience now I'm going to tell you as brother Bram say he said do it as I do he says if I'm eating a cherry pie I I separate the pits that I come AC and I keep eating the cherry pie so if brother ped P gives you a little pit just set it aside and keep on eating Brown goes on saying behind the seal you see the Great Seal of the United States now remember that United States America is in the prophecy said there is the eagle there is the shield and other things but this side on the right side for me you see the pyramid if you notice here above the pyramid is The Headstone and beneath it it says the Great Seal it says it there in English the Great Seal how tremendous that the seal to Crown right here at the United States now in our coins we have to recognize that no sinner can uh end Christianity every time that you put uh you put a a there they type our the the birth of our Lord every calendar everything speaks of him and even in our money the head The Headstone that is Christ because Christ revealed himself here through a man named William Mariam Bram blessed be the Lord but now according to prophecy The Headstone will come the message of of the hour and I want you to notice that when that headstone comes the prince that will declare the message will Proclaim Grace Grace because it's by that we are saved so that no one shall will will Bram was such a humble man because he knew that it was by Grace we are saved by grace that is by faith not by works but the works have their place The Works show that you're saved but what saves you is God's Grace Grace saves you Grace is what God does for you and works is what you do for God to show your appreciation for what God's done for you so then the works that I do is to thank him for what he's already done thank you for saving me because I was lost so I can't do enough to appreciate or thank you for what you've done for me the prophet of God keeps going on here Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 if I spoke with human or Angelic Tong tongues though I had discernment though I had gifts if I took all of my gifts for all my goods to feed the poor if I had Faith to move mountains if I had the knowledge to understand all things I am nothing until until the love comes down which is Grace love because God's love is God and he's given by Grace he gave himself to us by Grace it's all Grace blessed be the name of the Lord when brother Brandon speaks on Abraham's life we know that Abraham is the father of faith and the church in the spiritual follows the steps that Abraham went through Abraham went out when God told him to come out and the church comes out when God tells them so we know Abraham's Life by all the things that Abraham went through how it is that God even when he had mistakes he saw him through brother Brown says remember Abraham was not saved by works he was saved by grace Abraham was saved through faith by faith which is is is Grace faith is Grace love is Grace the headone is Grace when we speak about faith says the faith is the foundation of all things it's the it's the base of all to believe it's the base of foundation Faith covered by hearing hearing the word of God so when we speak about faith we're talking about the foundation we're talking about the feet when we speak about the head we're speaking about the head brother Brown says this we are Grace from our feet to our head or head to toe so then what have I done what have I done what do I do if it's if it's from toes to head then what Happ so what we understand that we believe him and that takes care of everything else because even the word is his and we have the faith through the word so then what did we do of ourselves what do I have what do I have nothing nothing I was an unbeliever but God's grace visited my life and I believed him that's all I needed was to believe him and he takes care of the rest blessed be the name of the Lord when God's prophet we know that when the Lord Jesus Christ came he didn't know all things uh speaking as an individual because Jesus came as individual he didn't know all things when they asked him if he would restore the Kingdom of Israel at that time hey this is not your to know the things of God has placed sign and the prophet says it's because Jesus didn't know he didn't know look Jesus received the Revelation that's why when the Book of Revelations when we didn't know the message of the hour we knew it as the Book of Revelation but when the seventh angel came to our lives he told us that the book of Revelations is the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave so who gave it to Jesus the Holy Spirit he gave him the Revelation he didn't know either he gave him the Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave him to manifest to a servant in other words through all all of us throughout the ages the things that were to happen soon in other words the future and declared it sending it through his seventh angel so now we have it the Revelation that that Jesus had that God gave when brother Brandon began to preach on the revelation of Jesus Christ he preached it in 1960 and so I want to read to you something that that he says before he begins to speak on it it's in the chapter one it's Revelations chapter 1 the reason for this special time is that we the holy spirit has placed upon my heart this conviction or warning that the church in this day should have this message speaking on the church ages because I believe that they are the most outstanding messages of the Bible because they reveal Christ in his church at that time it reveals how Christ was going to be at every because that is the most important thing see how he moved throughout every age every time in other words that if the scripture has revealed Christ to us and the condition of the times that it would behoove us it would behoove us to search it out it it does US good to search us out search it out it helps us it would behoove us to search it out and come to find out where we are [Music] at and this has never manifested so much in my heart until the last election and then I saw where we were at that was 196 what he was referring to that it was when President John Kennedy was elected he said when he was elected that hit my it's time for people to know these things and the Holy Spirit began to reveal to me to warn the people and to preach this and because of those same times along those same times he preached the Third Exodus and about that time President Kennedy died but he preached these things I'm going to read to you before we can find out what this Exodus means I'm going to type today's Exodus with that Exodus of back then and see if they don't go exactly parallel one of them is natural an exodus is a way out the message came says come out of her my people it's an exit and the same thing he did in the natural he's typing it once more an antitype in the spiritual an exod a spiritual Exodus notice how how God made this Exodus watch what preparations did he make and study it for just a moment and then see today notice that before this Exodus a pho was raised up that did not know Joseph now the people of Israel was beloved it was loved and grew in abundance in Egypt they grew in abundance and they were loved because of everything that happened through Joseph there but when seti the Pharaoh died which was the one who knew Joseph and in his place came R who did not know Joseph and when Ramis saw the people he saw them as a threat he said there's too many there's too many if there's a war they're going to join the enemy it's it's looks like something cruel but in reality God had told Abra that his people was going to were going to be in another land blessed but that after 400 years he was going to bring them out of that Nation because even though they were blessed in egyp their inheritance was that's why God allowed that didn't know Joseph to make their life uncomfortable so they can go out to their land to the promised land where God could bless them because God cannot bless man when he is outside of his position there was a pharaoh that was raised up that did not know Joseph and that was the beginning of the beginning that was the beginning of the Exodus so in 1960 the beginning of the Exodus started amen and you know what that cus it it brought a crying out a clamor the people began to cry out more they squeeze us the more we CED out and God heard the because God hears listen the prophet says he says I have de he told the prophet what made me descend was that I heard I heard the Cry of my people and that cry out is is not just anything it it's a shout and I have descended to free them and when that thing began to form itself under a political power God began to prepare himself I believe that if any man be a spiritual man he could see what is happening now we're receiving a pharaoh that does not know the the freedom of religion amen it was the beginning of the exod it was the beginning to go out it was a blessing when the people of Israel left they were they were chased or followed all over the world the prophet of God said it was the the kind hand of God so that they could return to Palestine to wait on their Messiah it was the hand of God because God is the one who allows it he's the one that has control when something happens it's because there is a blessing on its way that's time to cry out so that that blessing may come what a great thing to type the natural church with the spiritual church God working or dealing with Israel in the natural as he does it with the church nowadays under justification they left egpt there are three stages in their Journey there are three stages of Grace to get home please stand I'm about to finish I'm going to close notice while he was speaking and preparing himself 400 years had gone by and God was just on time with his word now we noticed later that after 40 more years so in other words it was 400 years but they had to remain another 40 years additional years and I could stop here just to say now you canite because I know it's being recorded in the because I know I believe that we the coming of the Lord Jesus it is already overdue I believe it went overdue long ago but this is for the church it's not ready to meet up with him now if he noticed he said as it was in the times of Noah Before the Flood that's how it would be and God didn't want one anyone to perish but for everyone to come to a repentance so he had patience the age of the flood was overdue wow it was very overdue the destruction and the and the coming out of also very overdue 40 years overdue past the written time and that's the reason I say if the church doesn't make herself ready that is its duty to be ready the bride has made herself ready the the the garments have been paid for ready but you have to be ready to wear those garments blessed be the Lord let's pray let's pray to the Lord and give thanks beloved Heavenly Father full of love Grace goodness and mercy thank you for the voice of the seventh angel when we repeat what he spoke the voice of the seventh angel keeps resounding help us to be in that preparation and be able to see what is happening around us and we can say time is overd but you're waiting yet for the last one you're waiting for the last one because none shall be lost your beloved Son said of those that you've
