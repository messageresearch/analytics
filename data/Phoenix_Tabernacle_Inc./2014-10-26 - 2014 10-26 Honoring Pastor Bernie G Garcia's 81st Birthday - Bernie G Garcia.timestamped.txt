[1:07:56] Mexico on October the
[1:07:58] 26th
[1:08:02] 1933 two days after he was

[1:08:09] Saturday evening's
[1:08:16] post if they're able to show that that'd
[1:08:19] be
[1:08:21] great it's an eagle that

[1:08:33] 1933 brother Bram said that the the next

[1:08:43] eagle he says that on the wings of a
[1:08:45] dove preached in
[1:08:50] 1965 we know that the dove is the Holy
[1:08:52] Spirit
[1:08:56] Pastor Garcia a holy ghost filled
[1:09:01] man a man that was called to the desert
[1:09:03] of Phoenix
[1:09:05] Arizona Phoenix also known as the Valley
[1:09:08] of the Sun
[1:09:11] Su and the Valley of the s o
[1:09:16] n brother Bernie a man that was
[1:09:22] ordained by brother
[1:09:25] Bram yes I I say
[1:09:28] ordained it has to be a spiritual
[1:09:32] Revelation when he was in maridan
[1:09:35] Mississippi Mississippi he would
[1:09:37] interpret for his daddy Pablo
[1:09:41] Garcia brother Bram where the same
[1:09:44] seventh angel
[1:09:47] messenger the prophet of malakiah
[1:09:51] 45 the prophet of Revelation 10
[1:09:56] would look into my daddy's
[1:09:59] eyes and say
[1:10:02] son he didn't say my
[1:10:05] brother friend he said
[1:10:08] Son you have to understand
[1:10:12] adoption son you started because you
[1:10:14] were called to the
[1:10:18] ministry yes part of the fivefold
[1:10:21] ministry and we know that the word come
[1:10:24] to the
[1:10:26] prophet as the scripture says Amos
[1:10:30] 37 surely the Lord God reveal will do
[1:10:33] nothing but he reveal his Secrets until
[1:10:35] his servants the
[1:10:41] prophets I hope you caught that this
[1:10:44] morning I need you put on your spiritual
[1:10:46] caps this
[1:10:49] morning yes our
[1:10:51] pastor was one of
[1:10:54] many
[1:10:56] secrets that would be revealed to
[1:10:58] brother
[1:11:00] Bram you are called to the
[1:11:03] ministry and there he was being ordained
[1:11:06] by the prophet of
[1:11:09] God you know the word ordained it's a
[1:11:14] verb it means to
[1:11:19] enact or establish by
[1:11:22] law to Destin or
[1:11:27] predestined predestine is to Destin in
[1:11:34] advance
[1:11:41] forain Destin means to predetermine to
[1:11:48] ordain brother Bron prophesied when he
[1:11:52] said you stutter because you called to
[1:11:55] the
[1:11:57] ministry see being a prophet he had the
[1:11:59] ability to go in the past and the
[1:12:04] future you have to notice that brother
[1:12:06] Bernie G Garcia was
[1:12:10] not before the seventh Angel's
[1:12:12] Messengers
[1:12:17] commission he was not called after the
[1:12:20] seventh Angel's Messengers
[1:12:22] Commission
[1:12:24] Hallelujah but he was called
[1:12:27] during the commission of the seventh
[1:12:29] angel
[1:12:32] message his life
[1:12:37] intercepted the Apostle of
[1:12:41] God with the prophet of
[1:12:44] God it was the time of going
[1:12:47] in the time of
[1:12:49] inheritance the time of the
[1:12:52] adoption the time of the open
[1:12:55] door that's when his life
[1:12:59] intersected with the prophet of this
[1:13:02] age and he was also given a
[1:13:06] commission oh it makes me think how when
[1:13:08] the son of man Jesus
[1:13:12] Christ the word came into
[1:13:16] Peter and told him
[1:13:18] Peter what you bind on
[1:13:21] Earth I will bind in heaven
[1:13:24] what you lose on
[1:13:25] Earth I will lose in
[1:13:28] heaven Jesus Christ the prophet of
[1:13:31] prophets the son of man gave the keys to
[1:13:36] Peter and he had the
[1:13:39] authority he said Peter you got the keys
[1:13:42] on your
[1:13:43] side and what you bind on Earth I will
[1:13:46] bind in
[1:13:48] heaven what you lose on Earth I will
[1:13:50] lose in
[1:13:52] heaven
[1:13:54] they told Peter what was what must we do
[1:13:56] to be
[1:13:58] saved pet said repent and be
[1:14:02] baptized remission of your
[1:14:04] sins you shall receive the gift of the
[1:14:06] Holy
[1:14:08] Ghost what he was saying is deny
[1:14:10] yourself and pick up the
[1:14:13] cross and I believe Joseph Garcia that
[1:14:18] in married in Mississippi Missippi a son
[1:14:21] of man which refers to a prophet
[1:14:24] or if I could say one like to the son of
[1:14:28] man gave the mighty
[1:14:33] Apostle the keys and put it on his side
[1:14:38] and said you're to help the Mexican
[1:14:41] people bring them a
[1:14:44] message and that's what he did he
[1:14:47] brought him a message beak to Beak he
[1:14:49] fed
[1:14:51] them amen you know it's no wonder that
[1:14:54] our
[1:14:56] pastor did not hesitate to heed his
[1:15:01] call to help the Latin
[1:15:04] Nation Peru Brazil bra Chile Chile colia
[1:15:10] Guatemala Guatemala salvad Ecuador
[1:15:14] Puerto Rico Puerto Rico United States of
[1:15:18] America sir and let's not forget the
[1:15:22] Beloved Mexico
[1:15:25] the very same man who by faith went into
[1:15:29] Mexico and South America with $20 in his
[1:15:33] pocket let me see you do that
[1:15:37] today but he went
[1:15:40] nevertheless even when some of the
[1:15:44] congregation said if you go to
[1:15:48] Mexico we will stop paying
[1:15:52] TI but that did not stop him for he
[1:15:56] could not he could not bear to have to
[1:15:59] stand in front of the white Throne
[1:16:02] judgment only to hear God tell
[1:16:06] him why did you not hearken to my
[1:16:09] prophet's
[1:16:11] voice why did you not obey my
[1:16:14] Prophet but instead he will he hear the
[1:16:17] sweet voice of
[1:16:20] Jesus enter in my true and faithful
[1:16:25] servant that has obeyed the voice of my
[1:16:29] Prophet that thou has done
[1:16:31] wow enter into the joys of the
[1:16:35] Lord do you believe that this
[1:16:39] morning but look at him
[1:16:43] now and today the scripture is once
[1:16:46] again
[1:16:48] fulfilled there is no
[1:16:51] Beauty we should desire to look upon
[1:16:55] him he's a little
[1:16:57] frail stooped
[1:16:59] over cons
[1:17:03] side but yet he's he's saying
[1:17:07] Lord have mercy on my children have
[1:17:10] mercy on my
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:14] people he still intercessors for us
[1:17:20] today my daddy Who Loved all his
[1:17:22] children
[1:17:25] the daddy who told his
[1:17:27] congregation if you love me love my
[1:17:31] children if you love me love my
[1:17:38] children I want to speak of one of the
[1:17:40] memories of my
[1:17:43] father I was probably maybe 10 years old
[1:17:46] 11 years
[1:17:49] old sister the Sharon Johnson came to
[1:17:51] our house
[1:17:53] Johnson she came to pick me
[1:17:56] up I was friends with Micah and Matthew
[1:18:02] Johnson Matthew Mel John Mel Johnson and
[1:18:06] when she came to pick us
[1:18:08] up she brought her daughter
[1:18:12] Joy because she had
[1:18:17] laryngitis and she had she wasn't
[1:18:18] speaking for a couple
[1:18:21] days so Joy was telling my
[1:18:25] dad out in the parking
[1:18:28] lot my mom would like for you to pray
[1:18:30] for her brother
[1:18:34] Bernie and it was just a simple
[1:18:38] prayer I I wanted to go have fun and
[1:18:40] jump in
[1:18:46] trampoline so my dad said a little
[1:18:49] prayer it lasted probably about 30
[1:18:52] seconds
[1:18:54] this was the first miracle I've ever
[1:18:58] seen she did not take more than three
[1:19:02] steps when she turned around and told
[1:19:05] and told
[1:19:07] joy joy and an audible
[1:19:11] voice go tell brother Bernie that the
[1:19:14] Lord has heard his
[1:19:17] prayer isn't it awesome when the Lord
[1:19:19] hears your
[1:19:21] prayer
[1:19:23] right there I knew that God was
[1:19:26] real I knew he was
[1:19:29] real because the life that I saw my
[1:19:32] father
[1:19:34] Liv I thought everyone lived the same
[1:19:42] life I can say today that I'm so
[1:19:46] glad that brother Bernie he his his
[1:19:49] commission
[1:19:51] his and he was obedient to the voice of
[1:19:54] the
[1:19:56] Prophet why do you say that Brother
[1:19:58] Joseph because he's your
[1:20:01] dad no because that would be the
[1:20:05] apostle that would lead me to the feet
[1:20:07] of Jesus
[1:20:11] Christ I can never forget one last thing
[1:20:14] I want to say before
[1:20:17] I one time in our
[1:20:21] house brother Bernie he was walking to
[1:20:24] his
[1:20:26] room I was walking to my
[1:20:30] room and he turned and and told
[1:20:34] me son don't you ever forget that you
[1:20:38] are predestinated into eternal
[1:20:43] life I did not understand it
[1:20:48] then and one time at the table he told
[1:20:51] me
[1:20:53] he said
[1:20:54] Joseph our
[1:20:56] Prophet I'm glad he said our
[1:21:00] prophet and not my Prophet you see he
[1:21:03] included me in
[1:21:05] that and I include you this
[1:21:08] morning he said our Prophet was
[1:21:13] sent a
[1:21:16] Joseph and I also have been sent a
[1:21:20] Joseph that might not tickle your f this
[1:21:25] morning but that's what he
[1:21:27] said and I believe
[1:21:30] it I want to say happy birthday to my
[1:21:35] daddy I love you with all my
[1:21:38] heart brother Bernie an apostle of
[1:21:42] man not of
[1:21:45] man neither by
[1:21:47] man but by Jesus Christ and God the
[1:21:51] Father
[1:21:53] who raised him from the
[1:21:55] dead what an example he's left us this
[1:21:59] morning if we can just love each
[1:22:07] other amen God bless you this
[1:22:16] morning
[1:22:21] okay
[1:22:51] for
[1:22:53] amen thank you
[1:22:55] brother that's a cool man under
[1:23:00] pressure
[1:23:02] amen I believe uh we've heard some
[1:23:04] tremendous words from my
[1:23:07] brother words that we can take to our
[1:23:12] heart I don't think any of us could have
[1:23:14] done a better job than
[1:23:18] that you know we could almost have a
[1:23:20] prayer line right now
[1:23:24] and miracles would take
[1:23:27] place I was thinking as my brother
[1:23:29] Joseph was talking about how he uh the
[1:23:31] things that he saw with my dad with
[1:23:33] sister
[1:23:37] Johnson took me back to a Time in Mexico
[1:23:42] City I must have been 15 years
[1:23:46] old tight this up a little more son and
[1:23:50] uh we were at a at a ministers meeting
[1:23:54] and there at that meeting uh they they
[1:23:57] my dad
[1:23:59] spoke and uh people started to to go to
[1:24:02] the
[1:24:05] Altar and I was sitting there he had
[1:24:07] allowed me to go to the
[1:24:10] meeting and it was getting hot and
[1:24:13] heavy and I was
[1:24:16] praying and I thought I heard my
[1:24:19] name and I looked up and my dad was
[1:24:23] staring right at
[1:24:25] me and he he went like
[1:24:28] this and and I looked
[1:24:31] over and everything seemed normal to
[1:24:35] me and he went like that
[1:24:38] again and I I said
[1:24:41] what he he said put your hands on that
[1:24:46] man so I looked over and brother Jose
[1:24:49] Hernandez was
[1:24:51] there brother Enoch his son is right
[1:24:55] here I looked at my
[1:24:58] father and had my hand up and I put my
[1:25:01] hand on brother
[1:25:03] Jose when I did that a light shot out
[1:25:06] from my
[1:25:09] dad came through my
[1:25:11] hand went through the brother
[1:25:14] Jose and he received the a holy ghost
[1:25:17] baptism at that
[1:25:20] instant amen I remember
[1:25:23] thinking I I thought my dad was a
[1:25:28] minister but what kind of man is
[1:25:35] this when you think of the ministry of
[1:25:37] brother
[1:25:40] Garcia it's
[1:25:44] singular maybe some people might think
[1:25:46] they know a better
[1:25:50] Minister other Maybe follow a lesser
[1:25:55] Minister be that as it may but there's
[1:25:58] nobody like
[1:26:01] him amen God broke the mold when after
[1:26:04] he made
[1:26:08] him when I first started traveling with
[1:26:11] my
[1:26:13] father you may have heard this story
[1:26:15] before but telling on his
[1:26:19] birthday he sat me down in
[1:26:25] and he said
[1:26:26] son said I'm supposed to go to a wedding
[1:26:29] in Mexico
[1:26:32] City but I can't
[1:26:34] go so I'm going to send you in my
[1:26:39] stad he said when you go an hour at the
[1:26:45] wedding one of the pastors is going to
[1:26:47] approach you and he's going to ask you
[1:26:49] to speak at this
[1:26:51] church
[1:26:55] you tell him
[1:26:57] yes he said and Sunday
[1:27:01] morning when you
[1:27:03] speak he said just speak anything that
[1:27:05] the Lord puts on your
[1:27:08] heart for about 20
[1:27:12] minutes and then turn the service
[1:27:16] over then you're just going to stand
[1:27:21] there
[1:27:22] somebody is going to come to the Altar
[1:27:24] for you to pray for
[1:27:28] them when you start to pray for that
[1:27:32] person everybody's going to want to be
[1:27:34] prayed
[1:27:37] for you just begin to pray for
[1:27:42] them said and I will be there with
[1:27:47] you and my ministry will come over
[1:27:51] you
[1:27:54] you just need to
[1:27:57] surrender now I thought those are nice
[1:28:02] words and I went to Mexico
[1:28:07] City and I was sitting there at the
[1:28:09] wedding watching The Wedding take
[1:28:13] place and brother Monto came up to me
[1:28:16] and he said brother
[1:28:19] Garcia if you're not scheduled anywhere
[1:28:21] I would like for you to speak at my
[1:28:26] church I said yes sir I'll speak at your
[1:28:30] church that night I I thought to
[1:28:35] myself what am I I have no
[1:28:37] interpreter I'm going to have to speak
[1:28:39] in
[1:28:40] Spanish Lord uh would you please give me
[1:28:43] the inspiration right
[1:28:47] now so that I can uh write it
[1:28:50] down and translated to
[1:28:53] Spanish and the Holy Spirit came into
[1:28:56] the
[1:28:57] room gave me the message to
[1:29:00] speak how many of you remember when
[1:29:03] Jesus sat his disciples
[1:29:06] down and he gave them
[1:29:09] instructions and he sent them out into
[1:29:11] the missionary
[1:29:13] Feld that was the message that the lord
[1:29:15] gave
[1:29:16] me and he told me when your father sat
[1:29:21] you down
[1:29:23] and instructed you what to
[1:29:26] do that was the same thing that Jesus
[1:29:31] did see we make it really
[1:29:34] complicated it's not
[1:29:37] complicated God is very
[1:29:40] simple I
[1:29:42] understood that he had gave me the
[1:29:44] instructions to do on that
[1:29:48] missionary now when I got to the service
[1:29:52] I looked over my
[1:29:54] notes and they had Brother Juan Pon was
[1:29:58] speaking and I was going to be the
[1:30:00] second
[1:30:01] speaker when I looked over my notes I
[1:30:03] thought I I can't speak about
[1:30:07] this people will think I'm speaking
[1:30:09] about
[1:30:11] myself I don't think it goes
[1:30:14] right and I began to search uh for
[1:30:16] another
[1:30:18] scripture that it doesn't take a lot
[1:30:22] usually I only need 15 or 20 seconds to
[1:30:24] find something else to speak
[1:30:28] on I know I know it's not what I have
[1:30:33] prepared but I know it's whatever the
[1:30:35] Lord wants to
[1:30:37] speak so as I began to search for a
[1:30:40] scripture brother John who had been
[1:30:42] speaking about companionship and
[1:30:45] brotherly
[1:30:48] love he said to to close before I turn
[1:30:50] it over to brother Bernie we're going to
[1:30:52] read one last
[1:30:58] scripture he said and he read the
[1:31:00] scriptures how can we see the works of
[1:31:02] the
[1:31:05] father he says believe on him whom the
[1:31:07] father has
[1:31:10] sent I I closed my
[1:31:13] Bible I knew that the Lord had given me
[1:31:15] the right uh message for that
[1:31:20] day and I preached on being instructed
[1:31:24] as you
[1:31:26] go I preached about 20
[1:31:29] minutes and I and I went towards the
[1:31:34] back and I just stood there the brother
[1:31:37] began to sing a
[1:31:39] song and I I opened my eyes and there
[1:31:41] was a lady standing to be prayed
[1:31:45] for I went as I remembered the words of
[1:31:48] my
[1:31:49] father I went to pray for that lady
[1:31:53] when I finished praying for the
[1:31:55] lady I looked
[1:31:57] up and just as my father had told me a
[1:32:00] week
[1:32:03] earlier there was a line of people to be
[1:32:05] prayed for they went out the
[1:32:10] door and I began to pray on the third
[1:32:14] person that I was praying
[1:32:16] for she said brother
[1:32:18] Bernie I want you to pray for me there's
[1:32:22] an evil spirit that is attacking
[1:32:25] me I try to pray and a and a scary face
[1:32:29] approaches
[1:32:33] me but it looks real I can see
[1:32:36] it when she
[1:32:39] spoke something came
[1:32:42] down and I sense the presence of my
[1:32:48] father and I began to hear myself speak
[1:32:51] but it wasn't me
[1:32:54] speaking and I heard him say that's not
[1:32:57] the
[1:32:59] truth what happens is when you begin to
[1:33:03] pray a white light approaches
[1:33:07] you that's Jesus Christ wants to have
[1:33:11] fellowship with
[1:33:12] you but because you do not know what
[1:33:15] that light
[1:33:16] is you begin to become
[1:33:19] afraid the minute that fear enters
[1:33:23] in the light goes away and the face
[1:33:28] appears and she begin to cry she said
[1:33:31] that's exactly the
[1:33:33] truth she was delivered that day and it
[1:33:37] went like that person after
[1:33:41] person I knew that it was not my
[1:33:45] Ministry I had never operated in that
[1:33:48] type of a way
[1:33:50] before and after
[1:33:52] service I asked myself
[1:33:55] again what manner of man is
[1:34:01] this the scripture when Jesus tells his
[1:34:06] disciples so soon the world will see me
[1:34:09] no
[1:34:11] more but you shall see
[1:34:14] me probably with you even in you till
[1:34:19] the end of the
[1:34:20] world that those words mean different to
[1:34:22] me
[1:34:24] now I think if a man of Flesh and
[1:34:28] Blood my own flesh and blood my own
[1:34:32] daddy if he could send his ministry upon
[1:34:37] me how much more our Lord and Savior
[1:34:40] Jesus
[1:34:42] Christ I remember I shared that
[1:34:44] testimony with my aunt
[1:34:47] Nati and she was uh she was visiting me
[1:34:50] in California
[1:34:52] and I was recording some of her
[1:34:55] testimonies and she began to clap her
[1:34:58] hands and she began to praise
[1:35:01] God and then she began to speak in that
[1:35:04] voice and she said
[1:35:06] Bernie said that will never leave
[1:35:08] you God doesn't give and take
[1:35:11] away that will be with you
[1:35:15] always and I've seen throughout the the
[1:35:18] years that my aunt naew was right
[1:35:22] you know our our
[1:35:24] pastor loves the people he give his life
[1:35:28] in his heart for
[1:35:31] you he's had some rough
[1:35:34] patches but we're here to tell you today
[1:35:36] that he's
[1:35:39] well he's
[1:35:42] good he's
[1:35:44] healthy as much as a 81y old man could
[1:35:49] be he's a strong is as strong as can
[1:35:54] be now everybody gets
[1:35:58] tired but when he's
[1:36:03] rested I would have no other one be but
[1:36:06] him somebody said the other day he's
[1:36:09] he's
[1:36:11] incapacitated and I I heard my brother
[1:36:13] say the same thing I I tell
[1:36:16] him I said yeah he might only be 10 or
[1:36:19] 15% of what he was
[1:36:25] maybe but if that 10 and
[1:36:28] 15% he's still three times the man I
[1:36:33] am and I'd rather have that 10% than
[1:36:35] anybody else is
[1:36:40] 100% on that
[1:36:42] note we had a meeting with him the other
[1:36:46] day and he expressed that he was
[1:36:50] ready
[1:36:52] and and and wanting
[1:36:55] willing to resume the roles as president
[1:36:58] of the voice of
[1:37:01] restoration and so we've we've uh made
[1:37:04] those
[1:37:06] changes he will be resuming the office
[1:37:09] of President of voice of
[1:37:13] restoration I think that deserves an
[1:37:17] Applause
[1:37:20] amen
[1:37:33] amen along with brother Garcia being the
[1:37:38] president he's asked me to stay on as
[1:37:43] co-president and brother James Garcia as
[1:37:46] vice president
[1:37:48] jcia now we we've asked for the James
[1:37:53] and he has
[1:37:55] accepted and uh my dad asked us
[1:37:59] to read a statement from
[1:38:09] him there's a white box in the
[1:38:14] office and we thought it would be uh
[1:38:16] good to read the
[1:38:20] statement
[1:38:22] but uh then we after thinking of it we
[1:38:25] thought it would be good to have brother
[1:38:26] Jimmy in his own
[1:38:31] words to to do
[1:38:35] so I'm looking for a white speaker it's
[1:38:39] a bluetoo speaker
[1:38:50] son
[1:39:13] how many you love the
[1:39:16] Lord connected I remember the first time
[1:39:19] uh just I don't know why it came to my
[1:39:20] mind the first first
[1:39:23] time that I
[1:39:25] remember my dad giving me a
[1:39:29] whooping now according to my
[1:39:34] sisters they were far and rare in
[1:39:38] between that's
[1:39:43] right and I kind of have to admit that
[1:39:46] is
[1:39:48] true because I do remember Billy and Jo
[1:39:51] getting a lot more
[1:39:56] weapons but I'll tell you the weapons
[1:39:59] that my dad didn't give
[1:40:02] me my sister Debbie made up for
[1:40:09] him and the scares that my sister Joanna
[1:40:12] gave
[1:40:14] me were worse than any weapons I ever
[1:40:19] got
[1:40:23] who has your brother stand in the street
[1:40:25] with a
[1:40:30] suitcase telling you that the police are
[1:40:32] going to pick you up because you've been
[1:40:33] a bad
[1:40:37] boy on
[1:40:41] Roosevelt right next to the county
[1:40:44] [Laughter]
[1:40:46] hospital where the ambulance are going
[1:40:48] by every five minutes
[1:40:53] we were at crossing the border in
[1:40:56] Mexico and I he taught us to be still be
[1:40:59] careful I was running around I almost
[1:41:03] got hit by a
[1:41:04] car I wish to God that car would have
[1:41:06] hit
[1:41:08] me CU then he would have been concerned
[1:41:10] for
[1:41:12] me instead he was concerned but he took
[1:41:14] it out on a
[1:41:17] hooping and I realized then how much he
[1:41:20] must love me
[1:41:23] to give me a such a
[1:41:26] whooping just because he was afraid I
[1:41:28] was going to get
[1:41:32] hurt amen amen
[1:41:41] okay Jo the voice of restoration as its
[1:41:43] vice president it is without reservation
[1:41:46] that I immediately felt a confirming
[1:41:48] glow of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:52] and I knew that I have been prepared for
[1:41:54] such a time as this it is a particular
[1:41:56] honor to be named the vice president of
[1:41:59] the voice of restoration the name itself
[1:42:02] is an name so lofty exceptionally humbly
[1:42:06] to be even be considered part of its
[1:42:08] past and even more daunting to be
[1:42:11] recruited to affect its future and
[1:42:13] legacy's defines the voice as a sound or
[1:42:17] sounds uttered through the mouth of
[1:42:19] living creatures especially human beings
[1:42:22] in speaking shouting and singing the
[1:42:25] pioneer of the voice of restoration
[1:42:27] brother
[1:42:49] B
[1:43:18] weer Etc
[1:43:28] tool that we call the voice of
[1:43:30] restoration taught me at the
[1:43:33] impressionable age of 17 that there was
[1:43:36] only one voice in our
[1:43:49] day fallible expression of God's
[1:43:53] thoughts and that voice which expressed
[1:43:56] that word of God was masked behind a
[1:43:58] Kentucky hillbilly accent and an
[1:44:01] ungrammatical profundity that would
[1:44:03] restore not only homes marriages and
[1:44:06] hearts but entire families if
[1:44:19] they
[1:44:38] in their own language brother Garcia's
[1:44:40] fundamental belief and his god-given
[1:44:43] calling was the Genesis of what became
[1:44:46] known as the ministry of the voice of
[1:44:48] restoration
[1:44:49] most
[1:45:04] have been called to be part of this
[1:45:05] ministry had no choice for had we
[1:45:08] adhered to our own Wills we would have
[1:45:11] chosen The Wider path of ease
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:19] not
[1:45:30] for who have been settled upon by the
[1:45:33] holy spirit with the gift of a burden it
[1:45:35] is my sincere desire to carry the torch
[1:45:38] of this message upon the shoulders of
[1:45:40] those giants of heart who have gone
[1:45:43] before us and shoulder to shoulder with
[1:45:46] those who by predominate counsel have
[1:45:48] likewise been thrust into to the host
[1:45:51] who fight fervently to take this message
[1:45:54] with fear and trembling fear and
[1:45:56] trembling not born of cowardice but of a
[1:45:59] humbling veneration of the Creator who
[1:46:03] thought so much of his bride that he
[1:46:06] would dresser with such a perfect
[1:46:08] message garment for every word I'm
[1:46:11] excited to join the young but God fill
[1:46:14] team at burn it brother burning is put
[1:46:17] together in place to carry the voice of
[1:46:19] restoration into the the future Bernie
[1:46:21] Jr Billy and Joseph have proven
[1:46:24] throughout the years that they are
[1:46:25] willing to put their personal lives on
[1:46:28] hold to do whatever it takes to bless
[1:46:31] the people I can see their father's love
[1:46:34] and passion for the gospel work has been
[1:46:37] instilled in each one of them on that
[1:46:39] note I am reminded of that
[1:46:41] transformative period of time that will
[1:46:44] ever be anchored in my heart in the
[1:46:47] deepest chambers of my heart the great
[1:46:49] love for this message and the ministry I
[1:46:53] call it my schooling at the feet of the
[1:47:19] apostle
[1:47:49] G
[1:47:51] Bernie J Billy
[1:48:19] Joseph
[1:48:29] my most cherished blessings to have
[1:48:31] traveled as a young man into Mexico and
[1:48:34] Canada with brother Bernie little did I
[1:48:37] know then that those selfless acts act I
[1:48:41] saw in him and the loving and sometimes
[1:48:44] Stern advice and particularly his
[1:48:46] instruction which were in all actuality
[1:48:49] on the the job training brother Garcia's
[1:48:51] training helped form my Ministry and
[1:48:55] uniquely PR prepared me for going
[1:48:57] forward this is why I believe and know
[1:49:01] his heart and vision for the future of

[1:52:44] to the intimate moments of a man in love
[1:52:48] first with God's word and then with
[1:52:50] God's people without his help many years
[1:52:53] ago I would not have learned the
[1:52:55] importance of God's order of things and
[1:52:58] that having a tough skin in the midst of
[1:53:01] the prey was a victory the voice of
[1:53:03] restoration would not humbly command the
[1:53:05] respect that it does had it not been for
[1:53:08] the leadership that has carried the
[1:53:09] gospel torch thus far and without the
[1:53:12] thousands of Prayer Warriors and pastors
[1:53:15] and dedicated volunteers who spread the
[1:53:18] Glorious gospel of the end time message

[1:58:07] the caresses of
[1:58:11] love more than any one of
[1:58:15] them and my sister joined in that
[1:58:19] c
[1:58:21] times because she was the one in reality
[1:58:24] that kind of raised
[1:58:29] us you know so sometimes uh um when I
[1:58:33] was in my
[1:58:38] worst you know when I was
[1:58:41] very
[1:58:46] bitter uh my sister uh got a hold of
[1:58:51] me and she grabbed
[1:58:55] me like that looked me in the eye and
[1:59:00] told me you must
[1:59:04] remember that your father does not know
[1:59:08] how to be a
[1:59:11] father and she began to talk to
[1:59:14] me and that is one of the moments that
[1:59:17] has helped me yes
[1:59:22] I haven't given my testimony
[1:59:25] here I know many maybe have heard
[1:59:30] it but um my father is is is a very
[1:59:36] different
[1:59:38] man we've seen many
[1:59:42] things we've seen the
[1:59:45] results of his
[1:59:48] ministry we've heard many
[1:59:53] testimonies of all the
[1:59:55] Miracles and of all the things that God
[1:59:59] has done through his
[2:00:02] ministry because it wasn't
[2:00:05] him that's something that that we must
[2:00:08] remember wasn't brother
[2:00:11] Bernie but it was God through the man it
[2:00:16] was God doing the work
[2:00:21] and it comes it comes in every person's
[2:00:26] life when God uses
[2:00:29] you but then when you come to the
[2:00:33] realization when God has finished using
[2:00:38] you to do what he has called you to
[2:00:43] do that is when you find
[2:00:46] out who are your friends
[2:00:49] who is your
[2:00:51] family because when everything has left
[2:00:55] you then you find out who is standing
[2:00:58] around about
[2:01:01] you then you can
[2:01:04] say I truly have known the
[2:01:09] Lord and those that are around
[2:01:13] me I can feel God's love around
[2:01:18] me because when it's all said and
[2:01:21] done there's only one thing that will
[2:01:23] allow us to enter
[2:01:27] in and that is perfect
[2:01:30] love without that perfect
[2:01:33] love we will never ever be able to make
[2:01:39] it now people do not understand what
[2:01:41] that
[2:01:43] is I I've come to realize
[2:01:47] that and as I began to to study the
[2:01:51] message now now brother Ernie
[2:01:55] Bera he's he's he's it's his
[2:01:58] fault I'm G tell you right now it's his
[2:02:01] fault because he he pricked my
[2:02:07] mind he pricked me to begin to study
[2:02:13] more as he began to teach the message
[2:02:15] birth
[2:02:17] pains
[2:02:19] now I don't know how many has gone and
[2:02:23] study brother ER thank you very
[2:02:25] much but I began to to read that
[2:02:30] message and in that
[2:02:33] message as brother Bernie as brother
[2:02:35] Ernie
[2:02:36] said repeated what brother brandham
[2:02:39] said he said that there is he go You
[2:02:42] Must
[2:02:44] Die the old must
[2:02:47] die so that a new birth can come
[2:02:51] in the old must die so that the new can
[2:02:54] come
[2:02:57] in and as you begin to read further
[2:03:01] on brother Brandon begins to tell you
[2:03:03] about law and
[2:03:08] Grace and he tells you that both cannot
[2:03:14] exist at the same
[2:03:17] time and when you real realiz
[2:03:19] that that there is a law and there is a
[2:03:24] Grace one of those
[2:03:27] things one of those
[2:03:29] laws is governing you right
[2:03:34] now is either
[2:03:37] law or it's
[2:03:40] Grace as I was sitting there in Mexico
[2:03:44] City in this last
[2:03:47] services the Lord came
[2:03:51] down and told me pay
[2:03:55] attention listen to what's being
[2:04:00] preached he says they're
[2:04:04] preaching and talking about
[2:04:07] love he goes but what they're really
[2:04:11] giving is love is
[2:04:17] l w the prophet tells
[2:04:20] us he
[2:04:22] said he is to
[2:04:25] us as
[2:04:27] ministers it doesn't matter if my
[2:04:29] brother has committed
[2:04:32] adultery if he has murdered
[2:04:35] someone or if he has
[2:04:38] lied or if he has done
[2:04:42] drugs put whatever it is that you
[2:04:44] want or if she is a
[2:04:47] prostitute he said that's not my
[2:04:51] business he says I am not a
[2:04:54] reformer I'm here to give
[2:04:57] Grace he says we have
[2:05:00] law to take care of
[2:05:03] that he goes but we give
[2:05:07] Grace We're
[2:05:09] called to give life to give grace to the
[2:05:14] people that is our
[2:05:17] ministry not to
[2:05:19] judge not to
[2:05:21] condemn but to
[2:05:23] say that Jesus Christ is the same
[2:05:28] yesterday today and forever and that
[2:05:32] same
[2:05:33] Grace is for you it's for me no matter
[2:05:38] what I have
[2:05:39] done no matter where I have
[2:05:42] been the grace of God is still here
[2:05:47] present
[2:05:50] Hallelujah that's
[2:05:53] right but when we
[2:05:56] preach and we say we
[2:06:00] know that there's children of the evil
[2:06:04] one that's his law because when I read
[2:06:07] the
[2:06:08] scripture and I hear Brother Bram
[2:06:11] speak brother bam said that the blood of
[2:06:15] Jesus covers the whole world
[2:06:20] it covers the whole
[2:06:21] world so there is no
[2:06:24] law at this time but there will be a
[2:06:28] day when that blood will be taken
[2:06:32] away but right
[2:06:34] now the blood is still
[2:06:38] there and we find out that we need the
[2:06:43] life that's inside the
[2:06:46] blood inside of us
[2:07:00] now one time I'm
[2:07:04] sorry I don't like to
[2:07:07] preach I'm honest with you I don't like
[2:07:09] to
[2:07:11] preach but I got no notes
[2:07:16] here when the Lord comes down you don't
[2:07:18] need no
[2:07:21] not I I walked
[2:07:24] in my the house of my
[2:07:28] parents
[2:07:31] and my dad was sitting down it was just
[2:07:34] my mom and
[2:07:36] dad he was sitting on his
[2:07:40] chair and he was
[2:07:45] crying and I got close to him
[2:07:49] I felt the
[2:07:51] presence of the Angel of the
[2:07:53] Lord I knew that he would had been
[2:07:57] there and I I asked Dad I said what's
[2:08:04] wrong you know as a son you know I was
[2:08:07] preoccupied with him I was
[2:08:11] worried and he he he's
[2:08:13] crying and he tells me he says the
[2:08:18] people people
[2:08:20] think that God doesn't talk to me
[2:08:24] anymore if they would only
[2:08:29] know they think that there's no more
[2:08:31] great
[2:08:34] Mysteries because but if they would just
[2:08:36] only
[2:08:38] knew how much the Lord talks to me every
[2:08:43] day I knew that was true I knew that was
[2:08:47] true CU I knew that the presence of the
[2:08:50] Angel of the Lord was
[2:08:53] there you cannot do nothing but be
[2:08:57] reverent you know I I walked in at
[2:09:00] another
[2:09:02] time to kind of change the the
[2:09:06] atmosphere that um I uh told I walked in
[2:09:11] and my mom and dad were
[2:09:14] there my dad was
[2:09:17] laughing I mean he was really
[2:09:21] laughing almost out of
[2:09:24] control and my
[2:09:27] mom was walking towards the
[2:09:30] kitchen and was telling me your dad is
[2:09:35] crazy and she throws her Castillo eyes
[2:09:39] you know you know how you roll
[2:09:42] them you know how the castillos you know
[2:09:45] they they just roll their eyes right
[2:09:49] the way the castill know how to do
[2:09:52] it that way my mom was doing that while
[2:09:56] she was saying your dad is
[2:09:59] crazy he needs help I go I just walked
[2:10:04] in you see I'm on my way to work but I
[2:10:05] just stopped by and say
[2:10:08] hi then I go I go I go what what's going
[2:10:11] on here he goes I don't know because
[2:10:13] your dad is
[2:10:15] crazy I said well explain to me what
[2:10:17] happened
[2:10:19] he he said he was sitting down
[2:10:21] there and he called me over because he
[2:10:23] wanted to talk to
[2:10:26] me and he began to preach to
[2:10:29] me and as he began to preach to
[2:10:33] me I started looking
[2:10:35] around and I saw it was just him and
[2:10:38] me and he begins to preach I mean he's
[2:10:41] preaching you know how my dad preaches
[2:10:45] right and during mid service of his
[2:10:47] preaching to my
[2:10:50] mom he says let's give the Lord a clap
[2:10:55] offering and my dad begins to
[2:10:58] clap he begins to
[2:11:01] clap my mom begins to
[2:11:03] clap then she realized they're by
[2:11:06] themselves and she says this man is
[2:11:10] crazy and she walked
[2:11:13] off that was the scene that I
[2:11:16] interrupted I thought that was
[2:11:19] awesome I mean we might think he's
[2:11:23] over or yeah he he's
[2:11:26] finished you know he he he doesn't have
[2:11:28] very much patience I'll tell you he
[2:11:29] doesn't have very much
[2:11:31] patience he doesn't have patience for
[2:11:33] the
[2:11:36] T for the dumb things yeah he doesn't
[2:11:39] have patience for for the little trivial
[2:11:43] things he do have patience for
[2:11:47] that but if you want to sit to him and
[2:11:49] talk about the
[2:11:52] word oh he'll talk to
[2:11:54] you he'll talk your ear
[2:11:58] out he that's just the way he is that's
[2:12:01] his
[2:12:02] life so those are some of the things
[2:12:06] that we we have experienced there's a
[2:12:12] lot dad I love
[2:12:16] you we've gone gone through a lot of
[2:12:18] things
[2:12:21] together we've gone through
[2:12:24] hell my relationship with him has gone
[2:12:26] through
[2:12:29] hell the Lord knows he
[2:12:31] knows I remember after losing respect to
[2:12:36] him and as things got worse
[2:12:40] life I told him some things
[2:12:44] that that basically as a son
[2:12:50] when he when he he told me one
[2:12:52] time I won't say everything I
[2:12:55] said but he told me why don't you
[2:12:57] respect me as your
[2:13:00] father I turned to
[2:13:02] him and I said when have you ever been
[2:13:05] my
[2:13:06] father you're my bi biological
[2:13:10] father but when have you been my
[2:13:13] father and I said some other
[2:13:16] things and
[2:13:19] you know not very many people would say
[2:13:20] that to my
[2:13:23] dad God made me a certain
[2:13:27] way
[2:13:29] and when God brought me back to
[2:13:33] church many of you saw me how I
[2:13:36] was I colored my
[2:13:39] hair blonde hair I did a lot of
[2:13:43] things but we won't get into
[2:13:46] that I I remember one
[2:13:50] time that after I came back I was his
[2:13:52] chauffer for about a year year and a
[2:13:57] half I turned to
[2:13:59] him I said
[2:14:02] dad do you remember
[2:14:04] that I didn't get to finish my my
[2:14:10] phrase he knew what I was talking he
[2:14:12] said
[2:14:15] yes I said forgive me
[2:14:19] I was wrong you're
[2:14:21] right it seems a lot of times in my
[2:14:25] life I've had to apologize that I was
[2:14:28] wrong you were
[2:14:32] right you know if I have offended
[2:14:36] anyone I'm
[2:14:38] sorry that's hasn't been my
[2:14:41] intention whether it was willingly or
[2:14:46] unwillingly because we're
[2:14:50] called to give a message of
[2:14:54] Grace to give a message of
[2:14:58] love as brother bam says this is there
[2:15:00] will be a Ministry in this end
[2:15:04] time but it'll say only what The
[2:15:07] Headstone
[2:15:10] say and they say grace yes gra Grace gra
[2:15:16] Grace gra that's why we want for each
[2:15:18] and every one of
[2:15:21] you that's what we want for Our
[2:15:24] Lives May the Lord richly bless
[2:15:28] you we love you and may He recompense
[2:15:32] your love to our
[2:15:36] pastor God bless you
[2:15:46] amen
[2:15:49] good
[2:15:50] morning I greet you in the name of the
[2:15:52] Lord Jesus
[2:15:53] Christ and it is an honor to be here in
[2:15:56] the house of the Lord this
[2:15:59] morning I want to I want to thank Bernie
[2:16:02] Billy and
[2:16:03] Joseph Bernie bil for their
[2:16:07] comments uh I I truly believe
[2:16:10] that what they say they
[2:16:14] said brother Bernie if you love brother
[2:16:16] Bernie
[2:16:18] you have to love his
[2:16:19] children how many you love his
[2:16:22] children I raise my hand
[2:16:24] too I can identify myself with
[2:16:28] that
[2:16:30] so uh without further
[2:16:33] delay it's almost time to
[2:16:36] dismiss you know like Billy says he's uh
[2:16:41] a little
[2:16:42] strange I think I am too a little
[2:16:45] strange and I I wanted to just comment
[2:16:47] of just a few little things here before
[2:16:51] we I have a recording
[2:16:54] here it it was this
[2:16:57] recording I I took it I took the liberty
[2:17:00] on
[2:17:01] myself that I went and it was it was in
[2:17:07] church and I took this thing to to
[2:17:09] church with
[2:17:11] me and I'll tell you exactly the date
[2:17:13] that it
[2:17:15] was uh March 26
[2:17:19] 1982 I'm not going to play
[2:17:21] it but anybody wants to hear it I'll let
[2:17:25] you hear
[2:17:26] it and during that
[2:17:30] service uh a prophecy came
[2:17:33] forth and a prophecy is it says
[2:17:36] something like this is not word by word
[2:17:39] now it says I'm going to have to go to
[2:17:42] some in Spanish because it came in
[2:17:46] Spanish
[2:17:48] is keep going keep
[2:17:52] on I'm going to
[2:17:54] continue
[2:17:55] blessing my servant gcia ber
[2:18:01] Garcia and then it repeats it again and
[2:18:05] then he
[2:18:06] says to
[2:18:09] him that goes against my servant
[2:18:13] I referring to God I will
[2:18:19] turn against
[2:18:21] him I'm going to say it
[2:18:23] again they says keep on keep on
[2:18:32] going he that goes against my servant
[2:18:35] Bern
[2:18:37] Garcia he said whoever turns against
[2:18:41] Bern I shall turn against
[2:18:46] him
[2:18:49] well you can say well it's it's only a
[2:18:52] prophecy God Vindicated in many
[2:18:56] ways his ministry
[2:19:02] Vindicated the people could see the love
[2:19:04] that brother Bernie has his
[2:19:07] life his
[2:19:12] testimony the many many
[2:19:16] prophecies
[2:19:17] that would say this is my beloved
[2:19:21] Apostle so then for for many different
[2:19:24] Avenues he was
[2:19:29] Vindicated what brother Bram told him
[2:19:31] son called him
[2:19:35] son we believe without a doubt that he's
[2:19:38] a servant of
[2:19:39] God and he is an apostle amen he still
[2:19:45] is and you want me to tell you something
[2:19:49] something you're going to think that I'm
[2:19:52] crazy on the other side of the
[2:19:54] curtain he's still going to be an
[2:19:57] apostle that's what I
[2:20:00] believe
[2:20:04] now notice I'm going to explain to you
[2:20:06] just a little bit how brother Bernie is
[2:20:08] somebody already spilled the
[2:20:14] beans please forgive me my wife
[2:20:19] I tell my
[2:20:20] wife it's been years years and years
[2:20:26] ago I said it's going to be our
[2:20:29] anniversary you don't want me to make an
[2:20:31] announcement in
[2:20:32] church my wife said for

[2:24:43] that and instead of
[2:24:45] saying to the people
[2:24:50] today is my
[2:24:54] birthday instead of brother Bernie
[2:24:56] saying today is my birthday today is my
[2:24:58] birthday brother
[2:25:01] Bernie instead of telling all the
[2:25:04] people he didn't say a word and the
[2:25:07] reason he did not say
[2:25:09] that because he wanted everything
[2:25:13] focused he wanted all the
[2:25:15] attention on
[2:25:18] me and my
[2:25:20] wife what a man huh and he didn't say
[2:25:24] anything that it was his
[2:25:26] birthday because then they it would have
[2:25:28] lost we would have lost maybe the people
[2:25:30] would have
[2:25:33] gone but he didn't say so I remember I
[2:25:36] love brother Bernie
[2:25:37] and from him a real man of
[2:25:42] God God I don't know what you believe
[2:25:45] but that's what I believe
[2:25:47] he he was my pastor when I was 10 12
[2:25:49] years
[2:25:51] old I remember him speaking in tongues
[2:25:56] and I remember that one day the light
[2:25:58] came into the into the service and
[2:26:00] struck the pulpit
[2:26:05] here I have never seen
[2:26:08] anybody speak in tongues like brother
[2:26:11] Bernie have you seen this things they
[2:26:13] put on the street where they put this
[2:26:14] blower thing on it and they they they uh
[2:26:17] they use them for
[2:26:21] advertisement and they go like
[2:26:25] this you know what I'm talking
[2:26:28] about the air is going in them and then
[2:26:31] when they let the air down they

[2:31:12] much uh it's pretty hard to compare any
[2:31:15] person to that to him
[2:31:18] but most important thing that he taught
[2:31:22] me was love love for the
[2:31:26] people he always told
[2:31:28] me when you see a church in
[2:31:32] trouble it's not the people it's the big
[2:31:36] boys you always when we go to Mexico we

[2:51:31] our Lord Jesus
[2:51:35] Christ the reason being behind this
[2:51:42] Pulpit is that we're going to pray for
[2:51:44] our monthly missionary
[2:51:49] offering we all know that at the end of
[2:51:51] every month uh an offering is
[2:51:55] collected for the support of the
[2:51:57] missionary
[2:52:01] [Music]
[2:52:05] field before praying I would like to say
[2:52:08] some um uh personal
[2:52:13] words
[2:52:16] and it's for me that this uh this
[2:52:18] personal for me this
[2:52:23] service it's a perfect
[2:52:27] service how many of you are with
[2:52:30] me I believe all all of
[2:52:32] [Music]
[2:52:40] youel that reminds me of that occasion
[2:52:42] when brother brandham spoke to us about
[2:52:43] Michel Angelo
[2:52:47] that great
[2:52:53] sculptor that he finally got to finish
[2:52:55] his Great Masterpiece
[2:52:59] Moses and he was so
[2:53:01] excited that he took the
[2:53:04] hammer and he he hit the the
[2:53:07] image he struck the image and he said
[2:53:11] speak and well brother Bram says
[2:53:17] that Mark he left on that
[2:53:19] image in that
[2:53:22] sculpture is what made him the
[2:53:27] Masterpiece the same way when the Lord
[2:53:30] Jesus Christ was
[2:53:32] hurt that's what made him the
[2:53:37] Masterpiece and forgive me for being so
[2:53:42] daring this precious and perfect
[2:53:47] message this service that's so
[2:53:50] perfect the fault had to
[2:53:54] come in the of
[2:53:56] [Music]
[2:54:01] brother there's some words that I've
[2:54:03] never gotten tired of
[2:54:13] saying
[2:54:15] I I was reminded by the when brother
[2:54:18] Bernie was telling us his
[2:54:22] story he says God called
[2:54:25] me for two
[2:54:28] things to help the the Latin American
[2:54:32] [Music]
[2:54:34] people the Hispanic
[2:54:38] people to help the
[2:54:42] youth whether married or not
[2:54:47] if you haven't heard it I recommend you
[2:54:49] listen to
[2:54:53] it so I identify myself as a
[2:54:58] Hispanic I don't identify myself as a
[2:55:01] Mexican I identify myself as a
[2:55:05] Hispanic and being
[2:55:09] so I I dare to say that God granted me
[2:55:12] this inspiration
[2:55:16] now many more years back
[2:55:21] now and I've never grown tired of saying
[2:55:23] it so I must say
[2:55:34] something Bern Gonzalez
