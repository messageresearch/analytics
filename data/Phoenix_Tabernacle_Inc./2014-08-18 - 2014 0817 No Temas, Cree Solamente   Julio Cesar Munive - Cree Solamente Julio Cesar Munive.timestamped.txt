[44:59] God bless you Brethren good
[45:03] morning we you in the precious name of
[45:06] the Lord Jesus
[45:10] Christ we're thankful to God for the
[45:12] opportunity that he grants
[45:15] us that we have the life and the
[45:19] health that we can still draw nigh unto
[45:22] him this
[45:25] morning like to thank the ministry the
[45:31] musicians and especially our pastor
[45:33] who's watching
[45:35] us please receive a greeting on his
[45:41] behalf we're happy to be able to be here
[45:44] before
[45:47] you I would like to tell you that we are
[45:49] not any greater than
[45:52] you the same blood that purchased me
[45:58] also purchase your
[46:01] soul the same blood that paid for the
[46:03] price for the
[46:06] prophets is the same blood for
[46:09] us that same
[46:11] blood is the one that cleanses
[46:14] us the one that purifies
[46:19] us this morning we want to submerge
[46:22] ourselves under and beneath that
[46:25] blood
[46:28] we desire that that blood might truly be
[46:31] applied in our
[46:36] lives because truly it's not the blood
[46:38] but the life that's in the
[46:42] blood that's what we desire this
[46:45] morning the life is in him he is
[46:50] life and he has given us
[46:53] life how many can say
[46:55] Amen
[46:57] are you thankful with
[47:00] God are you happy with the life that
[47:02] he's given
[47:07] you are you happy in the way that God
[47:10] made
[47:15] you my brother was laughing
[47:18] and that captures
[47:23] me at times we have to accept ourselves
[47:25] just as we are
[47:29] when I look at myself in the mirror on
[47:31] certain
[47:33] occasions I feel
[47:35] like like slapping
[47:38] myself but I have to accept myself just
[47:41] the way God made
[47:43] me but I ask the Lord please change me
[47:47] help
[47:49] me don't allow me to separate myself
[47:54] from because that is what man
[47:57] does they always run away from
[48:01] God but it's God that searches out his
[48:05] people God was the one that found you
[48:08] brother it was not your father or your
[48:12] mother God found
[48:14] you you must
[48:17] recognize that God was the one that
[48:19] called
[48:21] you God personally called
[48:24] you and he called you by your
[48:28] name and he placed something in your
[48:32] hands and with that that you have in
[48:34] your
[48:35] hand it's
[48:38] sufficient so that you can
[48:40] live through this
[48:42] journey can you believe
[48:46] that I believe that that is
[48:51] sufficient thank you we also want to
[48:53] greet our
[48:54] pastor God bless you
[48:57] and thank you for loving
[49:00] us I believe that our pastor loves
[49:03] us because he's a man that has given his
[49:07] life for the love that he has for the
[49:10] souls the souls don't pertain to
[49:14] man the souls pertain to
[49:18] God and we that have
[49:23] God should manifest that same love unto
[49:26] to man am amen
[49:28] [Music]
[49:31] Breen but at times it's it's difficult
[49:33] to
[49:35] love especially when we're
[49:39] hurt but at times we have to deny our
[49:42] own
[49:43] selves and place ourselves to one
[49:48] side and cast out all those things that
[49:51] do no good to our
[49:53] heart all that root of bitterness
[49:58] and even so be able to love our own
[50:03] enemy thanks be to God for his
[50:08] love we are in Great
[50:14] Expectations young people we're going to
[50:16] be going to that camp
[50:18] meeting please don't don't
[50:23] laugh I know I don't have hair anymore
[50:25] but I still want to be a young man
[50:29] but we're going to go up onto the
[50:30] mountain with the young people we're
[50:33] going to go to a camp
[50:35] meeting this is the 10th
[50:42] anniversary that we celebrate these
[50:45] festivities if we can call it like
[50:47] that where God has done many great
[50:52] things people have been
[50:55] reached God has manifested his mighty
[50:59] [Music]
[51:01] power we've seen God's gifts in
[51:08] operation Above All
[51:13] Things is that God allows us to be able
[51:15] to draw nigh onto
[51:20] himna I'd like to honor our brother
[51:22] Junior Ree and sister
[51:25] Johanna because they're the ones that
[51:28] began with that camp
[51:30] meeting they they deserve all of our
[51:33] respects all of our
[51:37] love for everything that they have done
[51:39] throughout all those many
[51:53] years
[51:55] amen graas
[52:01] thanks be to God also for the presidents
[52:03] that have had those youth
[52:07] governments because it's a lot of work
[52:09] to be done to be able to do those
[52:12] things don't think it's just go and you
[52:15] just get
[52:20] there it's been three years now that the
[52:22] pastor asked us to be able to help in
[52:25] this William Garcia alongside our
[52:28] brother William
[52:30] Garcia and we try to walk in
[52:34] agreement because it's difficult if
[52:36] you're not in
[52:39] agreement the Bible says can two walk if
[52:42] they're not in one
[52:45] Accord so we have to place God
[52:48] first it's not his
[52:51] leadership it's not my
[52:54] leadership but it's the leadership of
[52:57] the Holy
[52:58] Spirit guiding us through our
[53:02] pastor but Allowing God to be in all
[53:06] things number one or
[53:08] first I believe in being Guided by the
[53:11] Holy
[53:12] Spirit at times I have done
[53:17] things that truly I don't even realize
[53:20] that it's God that's leading
[53:23] me because at times we're just so busy
[53:27] that we lose that
[53:31] sensitivity that God is the one
[53:35] speaking or that God is the one leading
[53:38] us but how many believe that God takes
[53:41] care of his
[53:43] children God takes care of his
[53:47] children now what we have to
[53:50] do is take care of God also amen
[53:55] amen because it's it's like a a love
[54:01] relationship man takes care of his
[54:05] wife the wife also takes care of her
[54:10] husband if we lose that
[54:13] [Music]
[54:14] Focus it's time to go
[54:18] back and to be able to take
[54:21] God and tell him forgive
[54:24] me I haven't taken care of you
[54:29] I left you there in the deepest part of
[54:30] the
[54:32] garage but from today on I'm going to
[54:35] take you out of
[54:36] there and I want to place you
[54:41] first I don't want to take a decision on
[54:44] a decision just by
[54:46] myself I want you to decide for
[54:50] me I cannot guide
[54:53] myself I need you to guide me
[54:57] how many are willing to do that
[55:02] amen at times it's difficult to obey
[55:05] that
[55:06] right but it's the
[55:10] best God knows what is the best thing
[55:12] for
[55:14] you if God knows that something's going
[55:16] to kill
[55:18] you he's going to take care of you and
[55:21] and lead you somewhere
[55:24] else but he waits for you to allow
[55:27] yourself to be
[55:28] led is that
[55:32] righten God in the beginning to that
[55:35] first couple he gave him his
[55:37] word and he gave them the
[55:41] warning that the day that you shall eat
[55:45] thereof that day that you touch it that
[55:49] day you shall surely
[55:51] die and that does not change
[55:54] brother continues being the same thing
[55:57] up until
[55:58] today God is faithful to his own word he
[56:02] cannot break
[56:05] it if we let go of all or disobey just
[56:08] one
[56:10] word just as it was there in the
[56:13] beginning God has to come and
[56:17] judge if one day God is going to judge
[56:20] the
[56:21] world in what Manner shall shall he
[56:24] judge it
[56:26] through what church shall he judge
[56:29] it there's no
[56:32] church it has to be through his
[56:35] word that's why it's the
[56:39] word we have to take care of that
[56:42] word if we let go of that word we
[56:47] die but if we get grab a hold of that
[56:50] word we live am
[56:55] amen
[56:58] so then at the end of the month we'll be
[56:59] over there at the camp
[57:03] meeting and our thought for this year is
[57:07] Pentecost as and as a subtitle subth
[57:13] thought as the eagle that stirs her
[57:19] nest that's going to be our thought or
[57:21] our theme this
[57:24] year I'm here and I'd like to talk about
[57:29] that but I'm going to stay still on
[57:34] that this morning we're going to speak
[57:36] on the word of
[57:38] God that's what we've come here
[57:40] for to hear the word of God
[57:45] Amen don't see my
[57:49] mistakes consider that I'm also a human
[57:52] just like
[57:54] you and I make mistakes just like you
[57:57] do but God has placed me
[58:01] here so that I might speak his
[58:04] word and I do it with fear and
[58:08] trembling knowing that there's nothing
[58:10] under my
[58:13] sleeves knowing that there's not a new
[58:16] message that I might be able to
[58:20] bring but only to repeat that which has
[58:22] already been told or said unto
[58:25] us before I
[58:27] [Music]
[58:29] begin I'd like to present a certain
[58:31] person to
[58:35] you it's uh my my
[58:41] sister-in-law my wife had not seen her
[58:43] sister in 14
[58:45] years she is the eldest of the girls of
[58:49] her
[58:50] home she comes from the capital of
[58:54] Mexico the first time she's been here
[58:56] amongst
[58:59] us my wife has been very very happy all
[59:02] these
[59:04] days almost that I get home every
[59:07] day and I find herself
[59:10] crying I say what you're going to make a
[59:12] flood here in the
[59:16] house but she's crying because she's
[59:18] taking advantage of that
[59:22] time talking about many
[59:25] things
[59:26] but I always find them both
[59:29] crying said we've already ran out of
[59:32] handkerchiefs please don't cry
[59:40] anymore to
[59:55] stand
[59:57] believe that every human
[1:00:01] being has the right to hear the word of
[1:00:03] God at least one time amen
[1:00:08] amen we must give Grace of the grace
[1:00:11] that we have
[1:00:14] received let us please
[1:00:17] stand we're going to pray to
[1:00:24] God
[1:00:26] beloved God we thank you this
[1:00:29] morning report for service
[1:00:33] Lord we ask you for your
[1:00:35] leading and your
[1:00:39] help help us in the little things in
[1:00:44] life Lord because those are the ones
[1:00:46] that are going to help
[1:00:49] us don't allow us to for forget the
[1:00:52] little
[1:00:54] things Lord in those little
[1:00:58] things are found the great
[1:01:01] things in that smallest
[1:01:04] flower we can find you
[1:01:07] Lord in those little
[1:01:10] things we can find you
[1:01:14] lord lord what the world calls
[1:01:18] craziness you call it
[1:01:21] saying
[1:01:24] Lord
[1:01:27] we come before you this in this
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:33] moment we've been reached by your
[1:01:37] preaching
[1:01:39] Lord Lord and we ask you to place
[1:01:42] us in our
[1:01:47] position Lord that you might be able to

[1:02:16] Lord help
[1:02:18] us bless our
[1:02:21] pastor and each person that is here
[1:02:24] present in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ we pray amen
[1:02:32] amen God bless his
[1:02:36] word we're going to be
[1:02:44] reading I have a a small
[1:02:52] thought it's difficult to to find that
[1:02:55] would God wants for the
[1:02:58] people it's easy to speak on
[1:03:02] anything but for me it's difficult to
[1:03:04] find or search
[1:03:07] out what it is that God wants one to
[1:03:10] speak
[1:03:12] on and when I see that which what he
[1:03:15] brings
[1:03:17] us the first one that it helps is is
[1:03:21] myself and I wait on God that God might
[1:03:24] help you through his
[1:03:27] word there's no other way that God can
[1:03:30] help
[1:03:31] you but through his word
[1:03:38] amen this morning our thought is fear
[1:03:40] not only
[1:03:43] believe we live in a
[1:03:46] day where mankind is is
[1:03:51] fearful they're they're they're fearful
[1:03:53] of
[1:03:54] anything
[1:03:56] a man break
[1:03:59] down hearts are
[1:04:02] broken the nervousness of
[1:04:05] mankind being broken
[1:04:08] up the nations are
[1:04:12] confused the churches are
[1:04:15] confused everything is
[1:04:18] insecurity today you're
[1:04:20] healed tomorrow you're
[1:04:23] sick today you have
[1:04:26] wherewith
[1:04:28] all tomorrow you don't have
[1:04:31] anything today you have
[1:04:34] everything and you can even lose your
[1:04:36] own life
[1:04:37] tomorrow but what is the only thing
[1:04:40] that's a
[1:04:41] constant the only thing that
[1:04:44] continues is the word of
[1:04:47] God he is faithful to his word he
[1:04:50] doesn't
[1:04:51] move he does not change his
[1:04:54] way he continues being the same he says
[1:04:59] something and he fulfills
[1:05:03] it you can be so kind to open up your
[1:05:09] scriptures we're only going to read
[1:05:11] three verses and you may be
[1:05:15] seated in the Book of Job 23 verse
[1:05:24] 1
[1:05:27] then job answered and
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:34] said even today is my complaint bitter
[1:05:37] my stroke is heavier than my
[1:05:44] groaning oh that I knew where I might
[1:05:46] find him that I might come even to his
[1:05:51] seat you may be
[1:05:54] seated
[1:05:57] thank you
[1:05:58] Brethren very kind of
[1:06:08] you truly you are the reason why God has
[1:06:11] done all these
[1:06:14] things you are the reason why Jesus
[1:06:16] Christ came onto this Earth and he paid
[1:06:19] that
[1:06:20] price and he took on him the
[1:06:24] burden you're the most beautiful thing
[1:06:27] of God's
[1:06:29] creation the highest life
[1:06:32] form that God places
[1:06:35] man His
[1:06:39] Image you are the reason for God's
[1:06:43] love you are part of that love of God
[1:06:46] can you say
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:51] Amen but when those difficult things of
[1:06:54] Life come upon us
[1:06:58] when those tough Trials come
[1:07:01] on or those tough
[1:07:04] Temptations or whenever we fall or
[1:07:10] stumble or when God wants to truly prove
[1:07:13] our
[1:07:15] character and to know what we are truly
[1:07:18] made
[1:07:21] of to know if he can truly trust in US
[1:07:27] because did you know that God is looking
[1:07:29] out for people that he can
[1:07:32] trust I know that there have been men
[1:07:34] that God has lifted
[1:07:36] up I know that God sent a
[1:07:40] messenger but we're still here
[1:07:42] brother God still searching
[1:07:45] out still searching out for that
[1:07:49] Soul be willing to take him at his own
[1:07:54] word here's job and we all know his
[1:07:58] story we all know what happened in his
[1:08:00] life he had
[1:08:03] everything and from one day to the next
[1:08:05] he lost
[1:08:08] it not only did he lose everything but
[1:08:11] he also lost his loved
[1:08:14] ones can you imagine the condition of
[1:08:18] such a
[1:08:22] man willing to stay still and accept
[1:08:25] that what he was living
[1:08:29] in the day came that that he he just
[1:08:33] cursed the day he was
[1:08:34] born he didn't curse
[1:08:38] God he cursed the day that he was
[1:08:43] born but he never cursed against
[1:08:47] God but here the scripture
[1:08:51] reads I can imagine that he would have a
[1:08:53] conversation with god
[1:08:56] thinking on all these
[1:09:00] things so then job begins to say
[1:09:07] this he says even today is my complaint
[1:09:10] bitter my stroke is heavier than my
[1:09:14] groaning oh that I might know where I
[1:09:16] might find
[1:09:18] him that I might even come come even to
[1:09:21] his
[1:09:24] seat
[1:09:25] for example if they told you God is in a
[1:09:27] certain place if you knew where to find
[1:09:30] him tell me if you wouldn't go to that
[1:09:34] place what is it that you would do if
[1:09:36] you had that
[1:09:38] opportunity so then job
[1:09:41] says says I would order my cause before
[1:09:45] him and fill my mouth with
[1:09:51] arguments I would know the words which
[1:09:54] he would answer me and understand that
[1:09:57] he would say unto
[1:10:00] me says will he plead against me with
[1:10:03] his great power no
[1:10:07] no but he would put strength in
[1:10:14] me that there the righteous might
[1:10:16] dispute with him so should I be
[1:10:18] delivered forever from my
[1:10:21] judge he is our judge
[1:10:24] brethren
[1:10:28] but see if at times it's not that
[1:10:29] attitude that mankind takes unto
[1:10:34] God we fill our mouths with
[1:10:38] argument instead of taking God at his
[1:10:40] own
[1:10:42] word and fill our mouth with his
[1:10:49] word there's only one way that we can
[1:10:51] speak his
[1:10:54] word
[1:10:55] and it's that that word be truly in our
[1:10:58] hearts because the Bible
[1:11:02] teaches that our mouth speak our lips
[1:11:06] speak what is in our
[1:11:08] hearts yes or no
[1:11:11] brother you can hear a
[1:11:14] person when you hear that person
[1:11:17] speak what that person is
[1:11:20] speaking that's what's in their
[1:11:24] heart
[1:11:27] and job was a faithful man God has
[1:11:30] called
[1:11:31] us to take him at his
[1:11:34] word but at times the trials and
[1:11:37] tribulations those bitter
[1:11:40] moments we begin to fight or
[1:11:43] argue we begin to
[1:11:46] question and what the one that we
[1:11:48] question is
[1:11:50] God you don't question God he is
[1:11:54] sovereign he knows what he
[1:11:58] does even when he takes our loved ones
[1:12:00] from
[1:12:01] us he knows what he is doing he is
[1:12:06] God you can't teach him
[1:12:09] anything he is the Fountain of all
[1:12:13] knowledge how is it that man can go
[1:12:15] before God and question him and go and
[1:12:19] argue
[1:12:20] with but why is it that this I go
[1:12:22] through this why is it that you allow
[1:12:24] this to happen
[1:12:25] why is that with my
[1:12:27] son why is that with my
[1:12:29] wife we fill our mouths with
[1:12:32] arguments and we begin to speak against
[1:12:35] God
[1:12:39] Amen but if we take on his
[1:12:42] word and if we say Lord I don't
[1:12:46] understand I know that you are in all
[1:12:50] things Lord everything is falling
[1:12:53] apart Lord everything is just falling
[1:12:56] apart everything is
[1:12:59] failing but I know that you are faithful
[1:13:02] to your
[1:13:03] word I want to stay faithful to your
[1:13:07] word it doesn't matter where you might
[1:13:09] take
[1:13:11] me the Valley of the shadow of
[1:13:15] death I know that with you I am in
[1:13:20] security because your rod and your staff
[1:13:23] they comfort me they Comfort Me
[1:13:28] Lord Brethren just as children of
[1:13:31] God let us not argue with
[1:13:35] God accept God's
[1:13:39] will accept what God wants for our
[1:13:43] lives because God has a purpose for
[1:13:47] us and the only way to fulfill our
[1:13:51] purpose taking God at his word
[1:13:57] because any person that takes God's
[1:14:01] word live the reproach of the
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:06] word so let us not fill our mouths with
[1:14:09] arguments let us not blame
[1:14:15] God because we are truly the ones that
[1:14:17] find our own
[1:14:19] Mist we are the ones that fail
[1:14:22] God God never fails us
[1:14:26] man that fails
[1:14:27] God but if I'm
[1:14:31] failing if I feel like I feel burdensome
[1:14:34] for
[1:14:35] faing there's a hope for
[1:14:38] us Mercy for
[1:14:41] [Applause]
[1:14:42] us even through our right there might
[1:14:45] fall a
[1:14:46] thousand 10,000 to our
[1:14:49] left God is
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:52] Faith and he can maintain us faith
[1:14:56] if we can grab a hold of that
[1:14:59] word why
[1:15:02] reason I've realized that that or I've
[1:15:05] realized that if we
[1:15:06] reason if I
[1:15:08] reason I'm
[1:15:11] wrong if I complain I'm
[1:15:16] wrong if I shout and kick I'm
[1:15:21] wrong it's me that's
[1:15:23] wrong God is fa
[1:15:27] he wants to see that I might be
[1:15:29] still you see that those words up
[1:15:33] there still and know that I am
[1:15:37] God how is it that God can work through
[1:15:41] us if we don't stay still sufficient
[1:15:44] time if we begin to
[1:15:46] reason if we begin to
[1:15:50] question and if we fill our mouths with
[1:15:53] arguments God places to one side he
[1:15:56] doesn't even hear
[1:15:59] us we have to draw an eye unto God in
[1:16:02] the correct
[1:16:06] manner 40 verse
[1:16:13] one moreover the Lord answered job and
[1:16:20] said shall he that contendeth with the
[1:16:23] almighty instruct him
[1:16:28] he that reproveth God let him answer
[1:16:33] it then job answered the Lord and
[1:16:37] said behold I am
[1:16:40] vile what shall I answer
[1:16:47] Thee I will lay my hand upon my
[1:16:51] mouth once have I spoken but I will not
[1:16:54] answer
[1:16:57] y twice but I will proceed no
[1:17:04] further who how how shall he instruct
[1:17:08] the
[1:17:10] almighty where is our
[1:17:12] life whom does our life depend
[1:17:16] upon isn't it in God's
[1:17:18] hands isn't it in God's
[1:17:23] will
[1:17:25] he is here teaching
[1:17:29] us he that argues with God answer
[1:17:33] this so it's it's not the wise and
[1:17:36] prudent
[1:17:38] too it's better to stay
[1:17:41] still and not say a
[1:17:43] word can you say
[1:17:46] Amen that is the
[1:17:48] wise to stay
[1:17:52] quiet even though in family familial
[1:17:57] situations someone is beating on the
[1:17:59] other the other
[1:18:01] one better to stay
[1:18:04] still let the the Wrath
[1:18:09] pass and then at the right
[1:18:12] time to be able to
[1:18:18] speak what is
[1:18:20] this then answered the Lord unto job out
[1:18:23] of the Whirlwind and said
[1:18:27] G up thy loins now like a
[1:18:31] man I will demand of thee and declare
[1:18:34] thou unto me he's asking
[1:18:37] him will that also disel my my
[1:18:42] judgment will thou condemn me that thou
[1:18:44] mayest be
[1:18:46] righteous hast thou an arm like
[1:18:50] God or can thou Thunder with a voice
[1:18:53] like him
[1:18:57] who can answer
[1:19:00] that there no man that can answer
[1:19:05] that God has descended with a mighty
[1:19:09] arm just as when he sent
[1:19:14] Moses I've descended unto you
[1:19:17] Moses to free my people with a mighty
[1:19:21] hand but I have sent you in the same
[1:19:27] manner God has sent us even a
[1:19:31] messenger to free us from death and
[1:19:36] sin that daily beats
[1:19:41] us but
[1:19:43] no we prefer to
[1:19:46] argue one with another or against
[1:19:51] God we blame him for our mistakes
[1:19:58] we blame him for what happens to
[1:20:03] us to be able to justify
[1:20:07] ourselves you know that our own
[1:20:11] righteousness are just as filthy
[1:20:14] rags can you say
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:18] Amen there's not a way that we can
[1:20:21] justify
[1:20:23] ourselves there's no way that we can
[1:20:25] save our own
[1:20:26] selves he already saved
[1:20:29] us he already Justified
[1:20:32] us if we can just take him at his
[1:20:35] word for me his word is
[1:20:39] sufficient it's more than able to
[1:20:41] justify
[1:20:43] me it's able to forgive
[1:20:46] me if I recognize my
[1:20:48] mistake if I recognize my
[1:20:51] sin if I come before God lord judge me
[1:20:56] forgive
[1:20:57] me God is
[1:21:01] just he takes AJ
[1:21:04] Jud he doesn't take sides one with the
[1:21:08] other he stays firm in his
[1:21:12] judgment how tremendous is
[1:21:16] God that even our human mind cannot even
[1:21:22] understand that our human mind can even
[1:21:25] fathom the the understanding that God
[1:21:30] has today we live in a day that
[1:21:33] everybody claims to have
[1:21:37] God everybody claims to have the
[1:21:40] message but my question is what does the
[1:21:44] message
[1:21:48] produce who has the
[1:21:53] message
[1:22:03] what is the
[1:22:11] message do you believe that this message
[1:22:14] produces
[1:22:16] humility help me this
[1:22:20] morning when I mention the word humility
[1:22:25] you think on the opposite of
[1:22:29] humility for example I'm only giving an
[1:22:33] example humility what is the opposite of
[1:22:38] humility
[1:22:42] arrogance we're understanding ourselves
[1:22:44] right help me in
[1:22:48] that what is the
[1:22:51] message well the message has been given
[1:22:54] to us
[1:22:56] because the same
[1:22:57] Lord with
[1:22:59] Shout with voice of
[1:23:02] Archangel and with Trumpet Of God he'll
[1:23:05] descend of
[1:23:08] heaven but he doesn't touch the
[1:23:11] Earth we reach him in the
[1:23:14] air but we're
[1:23:17] taught he is the one that does these
[1:23:20] three
[1:23:21] things through a mighty prophet
[1:23:26] but what's the
[1:23:28] message is a is a a desperation
[1:23:31] shout it's it's an
[1:23:34] acclamation to wake people
[1:23:37] up wake
[1:23:40] up because you're on your way to
[1:23:43] hell but there's an escape
[1:23:46] valve that God has
[1:23:50] provided that you might run through
[1:23:53] it and your soul can be
[1:23:57] sure and secure from the from the hands
[1:23:59] or the claws of sat that is the
[1:24:03] message and we have the
[1:24:06] message the message is still
[1:24:09] spoken God is still patient with
[1:24:12] us waiting for us to wake
[1:24:16] up from our our our sleep of
[1:24:20] death that has invaded us
[1:24:23] brethren
[1:24:26] we're not activated to God's
[1:24:28] things we have them as little
[1:24:32] things for us it's more important other
[1:24:35] things than the message of
[1:24:38] God oh brother why do you say
[1:24:41] this but just look at your own
[1:24:44] condition just as you see your condition
[1:24:48] I can see my
[1:24:50] condition and I myself have to pinch
[1:24:53] myself and ask
[1:24:56] myself what is it that I'm
[1:24:58] doing with the
[1:25:00] message that God gave me in my
[1:25:03] hand oh I already read it oh I already
[1:25:07] heard
[1:25:09] it oh there's nothing
[1:25:13] else it's just everybody's repeating
[1:25:16] it you know why people are repeating it
[1:25:19] because we don't wake
[1:25:23] up
[1:25:24] I've had the opportunity to go out into
[1:25:26] the mission
[1:25:28] field and I've heard
[1:25:32] this today you don't need anything you
[1:25:34] have the
[1:25:36] message here's
[1:25:38] everything
[1:25:41] well I I stay thinking well that's
[1:25:44] good you don't even need to congregate
[1:25:48] brother you don't need a
[1:25:50] pastor you have the
[1:25:52] message brother
[1:25:56] if you have the
[1:25:58] message the message tells you that you
[1:26:00] must
[1:26:03] congregate the message tells you that
[1:26:04] you must choose a
[1:26:06] pastor by
[1:26:09] Revelation and not only
[1:26:12] that God placed a
[1:26:17] foundation this building has a
[1:26:20] foundation can you see the
[1:26:23] foundation no
[1:26:26] no we see the beauty of the
[1:26:29] building but where's the
[1:26:32] foundation I can't see it brother
[1:26:34] Jonathan but I know that there is a
[1:26:37] foundation and in that
[1:26:40] Foundation there's a foundation that God
[1:26:43] plac it's built
[1:26:45] upon of Apostles and
[1:26:49] Prophets and I'm not happy that
[1:26:53] God
[1:26:54] that sent an an angel of
[1:26:56] Mercy to the Hispanic
[1:27:00] people an angel is one that
[1:27:03] sent don't don't get fanatical about
[1:27:06] it don't think that I'm talking about
[1:27:08] great
[1:27:09] things an angel is one that
[1:27:12] sent that's why I say that I'm
[1:27:16] happy an angel of
[1:27:19] Mercy for the Hispanic
[1:27:23] people
[1:27:24] just as God sent an angel of Mercy for
[1:27:27] the Hispanic
[1:27:29] people he is
[1:27:31] obligated to
[1:27:34] send
[1:27:37] Apostles to those
[1:27:39] continents and and
[1:27:42] edified upon the
[1:27:44] foundation of Apostles and
[1:27:48] Prophets not only is it
[1:27:51] prophets can you understand that brother
[1:27:55] you have to get on the center of
[1:27:57] things because I've got got to places
[1:27:59] like
[1:28:01] that one time I got to T
[1:28:05] chapas it's there next to the Border
[1:28:07] there with
[1:28:10] Guatemala and there was a man there that
[1:28:12] was painted
[1:28:16] there we don't believe in doctrines of
[1:28:19] Apostles and this and
[1:28:21] that we got there
[1:28:24] we already
[1:28:26] there and the attack
[1:28:30] began is good
[1:28:34] brother but his wife was Ill at
[1:28:39] home had been two or three years that
[1:28:41] she had been in
[1:28:46] bed and God moved us on us to be able to
[1:28:49] make contact with the sister to be able
[1:28:51] to speak with
[1:28:53] her sister what
[1:28:57] happened while that brother was arguing
[1:28:59] over
[1:29:05] there others here where we're talking to
[1:29:08] sister and she was saying that something
[1:29:09] happened to her
[1:29:12] foot and the thing I missed the most is
[1:29:14] to be able to go to the
[1:29:18] services and we asked her sister do you
[1:29:20] believe God is faithful to heal
[1:29:22] you she said I believe he
[1:29:26] is you believe that if we pray unto God
[1:29:29] he can heal
[1:29:31] you literally that which was on her
[1:29:34] foot was was
[1:29:37] worms I saw
[1:29:40] them she says I believe that God can
[1:29:42] heal me
[1:29:44] brother I said sister and if God heals
[1:29:47] you what are you going to
[1:29:51] do I promise to go to church the rest of
[1:29:54] the days that I have of my
[1:29:56] life to honor God and His
[1:30:00] word sister according to his
[1:30:04] word and God that knows our hearts we're
[1:30:08] going to
[1:30:10] pray a very simple
[1:30:14] prayer so that God could bring a double
[1:30:16] healing unto
[1:30:18] her brother God is my
[1:30:20] witness at that exact moment
[1:30:25] that Sister Rose
[1:30:27] up we took her by the
[1:30:30] arms began to walk
[1:30:35] slowly Don't Be Afraid sister don't be
[1:30:38] afraid my my legs just don't answer
[1:30:41] don't be afraid everything is
[1:30:43] done God heard your
[1:30:46] prayer all of a sudden we let her
[1:30:48] go and the sister began to worship
[1:30:52] God
[1:30:55] what is
[1:30:57] that that's God's
[1:31:00] power it's God the
[1:31:02] Healer vindicating his
[1:31:06] word and truly
[1:31:09] today we're still in an Apostolic
[1:31:12] age the people of God is is an Apostolic
[1:31:16] people we believe in the Holy
[1:31:18] Spirit we believe in Divine
[1:31:22] Healing we believe in that promise of
[1:31:25] Pentecost for us
[1:31:28] today is it for you

[1:31:35] with this and
[1:31:37] that's you must be edified upon the
[1:31:39] correct manner is that

[1:37:22] unity this message is
[1:37:25] peace what does this message
[1:37:28] produce what do this message
[1:37:30] produce is
[1:37:32] a for the Lord Jesus
[1:37:36] Christ and
[1:37:39] she does not have her own
[1:37:42] particular she's
[1:37:44] willing to reflect what he
[1:37:49] is she's not reflecting
[1:37:52] that and she is not the
[1:37:55] bride because the
[1:37:57] bride has to
[1:38:00] reflect
[1:38:02] exactly the light of the
[1:38:05] sun has to
[1:38:07] reflect the same
[1:38:10] message one day Jesus
[1:38:15] arrived after having healed that woman
[1:38:17] with the
[1:38:19] bloodish after
[1:38:22] asking who touched
[1:38:24] me everyone was touching
[1:38:28] him how is it that you can ask who
[1:38:30] touched you someone
[1:38:33] touched because virtue went out of
[1:38:36] me search out that
[1:38:38] person and he connects himself with
[1:38:41] her he sees her
[1:38:44] with and that person comes unto him the
[1:38:47] bible
[1:38:48] say that she arrived there with fear and
[1:38:51] tremble placing herself at at his
[1:38:54] feet and he told her she told him all
[1:38:57] the
[1:38:58] truth that's the problem with us that we
[1:39:01] want
[1:39:03] God but we want our own
[1:39:06] way behind
[1:39:10] us we don't come unto him telling him
[1:39:13] all but you can't hide to God everything
[1:39:16] that you're
[1:39:18] doing you
[1:39:20] can't deceive God thank you amen
[1:39:24] you begin to
[1:39:26] walk and there's a
[1:39:30] man and and he says to her your daughter
[1:39:33] has
[1:39:39] died
[1:39:51] okay and as soon as Jesus heard the word
[1:39:53] word was spoken he said unto the ruler
[1:39:55] of the
[1:39:57] synagogue he was the ruler of the
[1:40:02] synagogue he wasn't just any old
[1:40:06] man and Jesus heard what had
[1:40:10] happened and Jesus said Be not
[1:40:13] Afraid only
[1:40:20] believe and he suffered no man to follow
[1:40:22] him saved Peter and James and John the
[1:40:24] brother of
[1:40:27] James and he came to the house of the
[1:40:29] ruler of the
[1:40:30] synagogue and seeth the
[1:40:34] tumult and them that wept and wailed
[1:40:38] greatly and when he come in he said unto
[1:40:42] them why make ye this
[1:40:46] ad the damsel is not dead but
[1:40:49] sleepeth tell me at times that that's
[1:40:51] not our own situation

[1:42:19] purpose so that we might
[1:42:22] mature
[1:42:24] so that we might grab a
[1:42:26] hold we might grab a hold of God's word
[1:42:29] and take him at his
[1:42:30] word and the people laughed at him to
[1:42:34] scorn but when he had put them all
[1:42:37] out get to one side unbeliever
[1:42:40] unbeliever let God
[1:42:44] Work look if you're going to be there
[1:42:46] with your

[1:43:00] continues being the
[1:43:02] same do you believe that the word of God
[1:43:04] is working amen

[1:44:19] years and they were astonished with a
[1:44:21] great astonishment
[1:44:25] and he charged them straightly that no
