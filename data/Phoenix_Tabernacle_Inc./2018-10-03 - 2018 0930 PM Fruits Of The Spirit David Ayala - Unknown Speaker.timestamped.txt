[59:28] well as bit that comes from Christians

[59:57] let's go to slide 5 I like into bump-ty
[1:00:00] yeah nice we're gonna talk about joy
[1:00:03] mama said let available so do you know
[1:00:05] what joy joy joy joy joy down in my
[1:00:09] hi that's a good song that's a really
[1:00:12] good songs and when you know why do you
[1:00:14] think that why do you think you sing
[1:00:15] that por qué piensas que lo campus
[1:00:19] because I'm happy
[1:00:21] okay that's so very happy that's what
[1:00:24] the song says that's really good um
[1:00:26] let's let's turn to first John one for
[1:00:30] from another cuando cuatro
[1:00:39] and any reason I kiss ladies Amanita and
[1:00:42] these things write we unto you that your
[1:00:46] joy may be filled its us cause us all
[1:00:49] scribbles but I came West Robbo so sir
[1:00:51] complete oh so so so this means is too
[1:00:55] significant that the Bible was actually
[1:00:57] written he lobelia irrelevant if we
[1:01:00] script to bring us joy for a try no
[1:01:02] salvo so ok now Lazarus as Christians
[1:01:05] our last Roman Christian knows we
[1:01:07] believe that the Bible trio mas que la
[1:01:10] vía is God is dios okay and and if this
[1:01:15] is God you see Esther Wow so that book
[1:01:18] is actually God
[1:01:19] yeah yeah so so once we understand that
[1:01:23] this is God
[1:01:23] yeah : tenemos que estés Dios and the
[1:01:26] Bible was written to give us joy 11f
[1:01:29] excreta para dar no salvo so then we
[1:01:31] should probably read our Bible until
[1:01:33] tomorrow after the video was a little a
[1:01:35] baby so that way we can get joy caught
[1:01:38] up with it obtain it and also I'm not
[1:01:39] worthy
[1:01:41] you can trash no you can read your Bible
[1:01:44] is it's there for you
[1:01:46] I said Lavinia particular layer that's a
[1:01:48] big book well it might be pretty big
[1:01:51] he saw system poco gravity but that
[1:01:53] means that there's a bunch of Joy's in
[1:01:56] here but else isn't it because little
[1:01:58] wool so I II but I must experiment you
[1:02:01] so so if we can read our Bibles he put
[1:02:04] them on the Aaron assertivv as
[1:02:05] Christians will learn comic Luciano's I
[1:02:08] bring the rim of the Rose Bowl so that
[1:02:10] God has for it if you see any para
[1:02:12] nosotros okay so let's go to slide six
[1:02:14] and let's say that was the second fruit
[1:02:17] okay for it Segundo fruit now the third
[1:02:19] fruit we're gonna say about peace I'm
[1:02:22] ready almost a pass what do you what do
[1:02:24] you think about when I say Gibbons is
[1:02:26] called illegal box
[1:02:27] piece of pizza one time me and brother
[1:02:32] Chris got in a fight oh no and sister
[1:02:36] Patricia made us have a peace treaty oh
[1:02:38] okay that's actually really good because
[1:02:41] some we being I have a restraining order
[1:02:43] on me that's good I beat him in a pillow
[1:02:48] fight he's weak don't don't say that I
[1:02:51] mean peace
[1:02:52] when sister Patricia peace okay so so
[1:02:56] that's one way of peace
[1:02:58] it's a Sunnah for mandalas another way
[1:03:01] otra manera is a peaceful feeling that
[1:03:03] we have in our hearts as soon as as soon
[1:03:05] a passive listener for a song so in the
[1:03:09] beginning of our Bible alchemy and
[1:03:11] Susanna Sara Vivian it talks about how
[1:03:13] God created I've read commodious creo
[1:03:16] all things to a las casas okay and it
[1:03:19] was good
[1:03:20] if I win oh okay so God created
[1:03:23] everything that you see here and this do
[1:03:26] so creo todo lo que si Becky everything
[1:03:28] everything everything toe toe toe toe
[1:03:30] toe okay you can stop looking cuz he
[1:03:32] created everything bro just trust me
[1:03:34] yeah they kind of meet up and there was
[1:03:39] a there was a relationship
[1:03:42] una realization had kale - whoa between
[1:03:45] man and the lumbering and himself he'll
[1:03:47] miss me and and it was good right so a
[1:03:51] little boy know Adam and Eve Danny ever
[1:03:54] they felt peace right Cynthia don't bus
[1:03:57] so when they disobeyed God although this
[1:04:02] over this year another you that
[1:04:03] relationship broke is a relation for
[1:04:06] rota and that means that there was in
[1:04:09] peace after that significant okay this
[1:04:11] place - no be a bus so so what do you
[1:04:14] think happened - what what do you think
[1:04:16] there was he being systematically or qué
[1:04:18] piensas kissed about this oh you mean
[1:04:20] God actually came down and talked to
[1:04:22] Adam yeah yeah yeah he had a
[1:04:24] relationship with him then you look at
[1:04:27] the oil and then the piece was broken
[1:04:30] yeah yeah because they disobeyed God
[1:04:32] poor kids over the Sierra not you know
[1:04:35] but that doesn't mean that there's war
[1:04:38] right now no kami because I killed I get
[1:04:41] because porque
[1:04:43] God wanted to restore that relationship
[1:04:45] dos caras of Radisson unless you thank
[1:04:48] God
[1:04:48] yeah he sent his son olimpio su hijo
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ is so Kristin to bridge
[1:04:54] that relationship they our car is a
[1:04:57] relation that was broken que estaba rota
[1:04:59] so so God wanted a secure vo skiddy - he
[1:05:03] knew
[1:05:04] that the relationship was broken in
[1:05:06] Sevilla wasn't peace Lala Hsu nest or
[1:05:09] rotten or via bus but he wanted peace
[1:05:11] but I will carry a bus right so as a
[1:05:14] Christian we should como Cristiano we
[1:05:18] should learn and know the vemos Zeppelin
[1:05:21] air is aware that Jesus cries kissu
[1:05:24] Chris was sent for enviado to bring us
[1:05:27] peace for a triad nosepass Oh Oh light
[1:05:30] bulb I just made a connection that's why
[1:05:34] Jesus is the Prince of Peace right
[1:05:37] that's exactly what we call them the
[1:05:39] praetorium all my successor principe de
[1:05:42] la Paz
[1:05:42] so remember okay as as a Christian we
[1:05:46] understand that Jesus Christ
[1:05:48] como Christian tenemos que su Cristo
[1:05:50] cane be known to restore us but at least
[1:05:53] our our nose okay
[1:05:55] he loved us so much was a more detailed
[1:05:57] manera that he came to to make that
[1:06:01] relationship right with us be Nikora
[1:06:03] here Sara Lysenko nosotros so so we need
[1:06:06] to live test animals KBB by the spirit
[1:06:09] por el espíritu and and what is the holy
[1:06:12] spirit you can sell Espiritu Santo the
[1:06:19] cement in the photos alright so we're
[1:06:21] gonna go to the next one
[1:06:22] thank you I can't wait to see the next
[1:06:24] free well we're gonna get into patience
[1:06:27] so you might have to wait a little
[1:06:29] longer to develop and scientist testing
[1:06:31] a crisp in order to give me patience
[1:06:33] will give it to me now so I learned to
[1:06:36] do openly that patients can paciencia
[1:06:40] it's too way is esperar in God's place
[1:06:43] and in lieu our videos or at God pace or
[1:06:46] El Paso
[1:06:47] videos well that's tough it's tough but
[1:06:52] let's let's read Psalms 135 to says if

[1:13:39] only good internet must keep yourself
[1:13:41] saloon cookies windows so true Jesus I'm
[1:13:45] good

[1:13:52] Quatro Quatro it says that everything
[1:13:54] God created is good
[1:13:56] que todo lo que Dios creo es bueno so so
[1:13:59] if we can remember that if we live by
[1:14:03] the spirit simple AmeriCorps de que

[1:14:07] all to God's standard podemos serve way
[1:14:11] knows as Elliston darlin or Medeiros
[1:14:13] because because God created us for Kady
[1:14:16] Ausmus creo right so that means that at
[1:14:18] our core significant Ostrow Centro
[1:14:21] Nostrum nucleo we're we're good
[1:14:23] someone's born of God intended for us to
[1:14:26] be good my intention adios is the que
[1:14:28] voy a most boy knows but but remember
[1:14:30] that there there there was a
[1:14:31] disobedience so required avianna
[1:14:33] disobedience here we need that bridge
[1:14:35] this is the most disappointing who who
[1:14:38] is that bridge Val Venis is a pointless
[1:14:40] oh Jesus so that's right exactly so
[1:14:43] without Jesus Christ to see mr. Bristo
[1:14:46] you're not you're not up to standard
[1:14:48] you're not good no digas a su note but
[1:14:50] with him you're you're good no it is
[1:14:53] bueno para poner it is bueno so John 15
[1:14:57] for this one Quinta cuatro it says abide
[1:15:03] in me a beat on me and I in you in yo
[1:15:07] and vosotros as the branch cannot bear
[1:15:09] fruit of itself
