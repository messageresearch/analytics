[Music] god bless you once again it's an honor here and a privilege to be able to bring to you that the next in this series of sequential excerpts in this series of books supernatural the life of William Branham we're in book three the man in his commissioned 1946 to 1950 written by Owen Jorgensen we're so thankful for this work this next chapter is entitled homecoming shock if you remember when we finished the last reading brother Brandon had finished a series our campaign in Jonesboro Arkansas which left them physically and even mentally exhausted he returned to Jeffersonville and as we will see in the chapter some things had changed as as far as the atmosphere of the neighborhood fact that was not lost on sister Mina however later in the chapter and we thank the Lord for for imparting the revelation to our prophet we marry Brandon when he needed it the most and you'll see that that particular situation on foam so we're in chapter 34 the year is still 1946 this will be the last chapter for this year of 1946 in Jonesborough during the fall of 1946 william branham stayed on the platform for eight straight days and nights praying for a steady stream of sick and needy he ate his meals on the platform and nap behind the pulpit while those in the prayer line stood patiently waiting for him to wake up and resume his work by the end of the week bills for head throbbed with weariness the backs of his hands were raw where he had pulled out the hairs trying to keep himself awake still he did not want to stop he wanted to stay there until he had prayed for every sick person who came through the doors but he couldn't the news of the healings and miracles was like a magnet drawing thousands more to Jonesboro throughout the week when bill finally did quit on the eighth night of that Jonesboro healing campaign the prayer line was longer than it was when he started bill felt exhausted physically and mentally pastor Reid put him to bed but bill felt so jittery he couldn't fall asleep he thrashed back and forth under the covers for hours at last rather than fighted he decided to drive home to just from Ville and collapse in his own bed where hopefully he could sleep for days undisturbed after a few hours of driving bill had trouble keeping his eyelids open to keep himself from falling asleep behind the steering wheel he beat his leg against the door until the paneling dented out of shape once he did doze off a blaring horn jerked him awake giving him just enough time to swerve back to his side of the road shaken he pulled the car over and stopped so he could get himself together made it was still asleep in the backseat bill got out hoping that a walk would refresh him somewhere he lost himself to exhaustion when he finally came back to his senses he found himself standing in the cow pasture with his hand stretched out mumbling only believe sister that's all you have to do just believe he shook his head fiercely thinking what is the matter with me I seem to be coming apart reaching Jeffersonville late in the evening they stopped at Maeda's parents house to pick up their children Rebecca was now five months old bill had not seen her for three months so it was not surprising that she didn't recognize him when he tried to hold her she cried and struggled to get back to her mother that hurt she doesn't know me he complained call me Rebecca with the swing of her body made a nodded at a picture of bill propped up on an end table I've got that same picture of you sitting on our dresser every day I pointed to it and told her that is your daddy bill looked at the picture then at his face in the hall mirror no wonder she doesn't recognize me I've lost 20 pounds I've lost some hair and my shoulders stoop I don't look the same at all another shock awaited him or them when they drove up to their own house cars lined both sides of the street for several blocks and there were nearly 200 people waiting for him in his yard what's this all about me to ask bill blushed everywhere I went I gave out our address and told people to stop by if they were ever near Jeffersonville and needed prayer I didn't think they would come this soon late into the night bill prayed for the crowd in his front yard finally the last person drove away May to help Bill get into bed it was 2:00 a.m. he lay there quietly drifting into a limbo of half sleep suddenly he jerked awake his legs cramped made a setup bill do you know what you were doing I thought I was sleeping you had your arm around your pillow and you were mumbling who is next now if you'll just believe because the angel told me if I could get people to people to believe Bill I'm worried about you outside a car drove up it sounded like an old car the engine idle roughly causing the fenders to rattle from the vibrations someone knocked on the front door made a touch Bill's eyelids with her fingers and gently pulled them shut she said I'll tell them come back tomorrow you go to sleep dear bill heard a man's voice in the kitchen saying our baby has been sick for a long time it won't stop crying cries day and night the doctor can't figure out why Bill heard the baby making a strange noise sort of a wheezing sound like it was trying to cry but had no energy left to do it the noise didn't even sound human bill heard made us say well I just got built to sleep so I don't want to wake him right now then bill heard another woman say we came from northern Ohio we've traveled all day and all night to get here bill thought how can I sleep with that poor baby suffering in the next room when maybe a prayer could help it he staggered out dressed in his pajamas a 10 week old baby lay on the kitchen table wrapped in a blanket its little face twisted as it feebly tried to cry bill asked everyone to kneel and together they turned their voices to the one who had the power to deliver that suffering child Jesus Christ the baby stopped crying its face relaxed by the time the couple left ten minutes later the baby was cooing and smiling before bill had time to crawl back into bed another car drove bill heard footsteps running toward the house someone pounded on the front door bill without led an excited young man into the kitchen the young man said brother branham my sister has appendicitis she's in bad shape she's scheduled for an operation in Louisville later this morning but now our condition is so bad dad doesn't think she can make the trip to the hospital it's a mountain road real rough we live about 35 miles west of here near mill town we know what God did for Georgy Carter so Dan sent me to see if you would come pray for my sister will you come without a second of hesitation bill said yes let me change into my clothes real quick and then I'll follow you into my car Mayda started to cry honey you'll fall asleep somewhere no I'll be all right sweetheart bill reassured her his confidence sagged after a dozen miles his eyelids felt as heavy as lead sinkers sometimes he pinched himself to keep his senses sometimes he bit his finger he even spit on his fingers and wiped the spittle into his eyes trying to ward off sleep the young man was right about the terrible condition of the roads especially the last few miles were the road narrowed into two tire tracks between fences and snake back and forth up the mountainside at least now he didn't have to worry about falling asleep since the road jerked him smartly every time his tire hit a rock were dropped into a Rudd the two cars parked outside a farmhouse after meeting the father and mother Bill followed them to the bedside of a girl about 18 years old her pale skin glistened with beads of sweat or on her temples she showed bill her swollen side the girl's father said she hasn't eaten in three days today she couldn't even hold water down she's supposed to be operated on later this morning an ambulance is supposed to come in a few hours to get her but she's gotten so much worse tonight that now I'm afraid she can't make the trip bill understood appendicitis having watched his friend Sam Adair operate on patients several times this girl's appendix if it was about to rupture and it certainly looked like it was then she went most likely not survived the 40 mile trip to New Albany those first few miles alone would murder her nervously the girl asked old brother branham do you think I'll live choosing his words carefully bill answered I believe you will if you have enough faith do you believe that Jesus Christ can heal you her answer rushed out in a jittery burst oh yes I believe my church says the days of miracles are past but I don't care what my church says I believe Georgy Carter got well I'll get well too I'm scared of the operation having seen thousands of healings and miracles over the past six months bill saw through the girls nervous confession of faith to doubt to the doubt and fear that lay underneath sister I do not mean to hurt your feelings but you do not believe ordinarily there would be enough time for me to let you take what little faith you've got and let you try to believe for your healing but this is an emergency you've got to believe right now or I'll be honest with you you'll not live to see the hospital neither the girl nor her parents appreciated his frankness but bill couldn't help that the situation was urgent he decided he had to try something radical in order to for her to catch the idea bill sat on one side of the girls bed decide nearest to the center of the room her parents and a few friends stood on the other side of her bed the side nearest to the wall in the center of the ceiling glowed an electric light a string hung down from the light cover suspending a red and white bracelet halfway between the ceiling and the floor bill didn't know why this bracelet was hanging there unless perhaps it was used to amuse the baby that was in the house now he figured this bracelet would serve his purpose well Bilson all your adults need to turn around and face the wall then he said to the girl how far away do you think that bracelet is about 15 feet wide you're telling me that you have faith to believe for all things I want to prove I want you to prove it to me I want you to look at that bracelet and I want you to make it swing around and around on the string then I want you to make it swing back and forth then stop it still if you can do that then I'll know you have faith enough for a miracle the girl surprised mingled with her disappointment oh brother branham my why would you ask me to do something like that no one can do that oh yes bill said anyone can that believes jesus said all things are possible if you believe she still remains skeptical but Jesus was talking about spiritual things this is material could you do it yes ma'am could I see it done if you desire just keep your eyes on that bracelet bill fastened his own eyes on the object and concentrated his faith by now he had seen God performed so many miracles that he knew all things were indeed possible through faith in a moment the bracelet began to circle on the end of the string then begin to swing back and forth like a pendulum then it stopped the girl gasped brother branham that spiritualism I thought you might say something like that no it's not spiritualism it's faith now spiritualist used that many times to play pranks bust glasses bend spoons and so forth but it is still just faith the girl could not grasp what he was saying I belong to the Church of Christ we speak where the Bible speaks and were silent where the Bible is silent and there is nothing like that in the Bible sure it's in the Bible bill said remember one morning how Jesus went up to a fig tree looking for some fruit when he didn't find any he put a curse on it the tree began to will when he came back in by in the evening the tree had withered to death Peter remarked how quickly it had happened in jesus answered by saying that not only could you do what he did to the fig tree but if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart by and by it would come to pass didn't he say it sure he did I know your pastors just trying to justify his unbelief by saying that was a mountain of sin that Jesus was talking about but it was the Mount of Olives he said it just took faith as a grain of a mustard seed now if that little bit of pure faith can move a mountain how much smaller faith would you need to move that bracelet the girl lay contemplating each labor breath made her wince bill decided to try another approach look sister an angel came to me five months ago and told me that before I was born I was four ordained by God to take a gift of the vine healing to the people I stood face to face with a supernatural being and he told me if I could get two people to believe me and be sincere when I pray nothing would stand before the prayer if you will believe with all your heart that's what will move God your faith will save you not what you've worked up in your mind but what you really believe the girl answered brother Branham I know that there is something above where I have reached God have mercy on me I will try with all my heart to believe in him taking hold of her right hand bill watched his own left hand swell read to the pounding of unseen vibrations he a touch appendicitis before and was familiar with the pattern of white welts that formed on the back of his hand by the intensity of the vibrations alone he could tell that this case was severe as he asked the Lord Jesus to intervene throbbing the throbbing in the left arm diminished and then disappeared his left hand returned to normal bill said god bless you sister your faith has saved you amidst the joy and relief that passed through the room bill sat down and instantly fell asleep a few hours later he woke up with sunshine in his face the father said good morning in enthusiastically shook bills and things I called the ambulance and told them that there was no need for them to come since my daughter is completely healed the girl was out of bed now sitting at a kitchen table eating ice cream I feel great brother branham the swelling is all gone from my side and there's not a bit of pain left and I'm so hungry god

verses one through three and if you have it you can say Amen and I'm gonna be asking questions and I have prizes to give after church if you answer it right or wrong you're still gonna get a prize so so do I have a brave soul who can read the scriptures for a prize got some good prizes anybody okay I'll read the verse in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim's each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly now this third verse is the verse that i want you guys to really pay attention to and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory amen you guys can have a seat now the first question that I'm going to ask is what was the chapter and verses that I just read an ayah I like it you're still gonna get a prize does anybody else want to answer what was it the chapter the book of the Bible in verse that I just read go ahead what was that which book of the Bible chapter verses one through three perfect alright so you get a prize so after church you can come out and then we'll be handing your prizes to you okay so if you guys can greet your neighbor smile at them say god bless you let's loosen up a little bit because we are brothers and sisters in Christ the person on your right is not your enemy the person on your left is not your enemy I'm not your enemy I'm your brother in Christ I'll pray for me pray pray for each other amen so again the verse is holy holy holy is the Lord I want to talk about what is holiness God is holy here we have in the scriptures the angels saying God is holy holy holy or what does that mean as we can see here God is walking down the aisle God is holy he is not like you he has set apart he is perfect he is clean he is without sin I'm gonna read a quote from brother Branham God requires perfect holiness no one can stand in his image with one little speck of sin just one little speck of sin whether it was you told a little lie you stole the car whatever it is one little speck of sin you cannot stand in the presence of God Jim Jesus witnessed the same and said be perfect just like God in heaven is perfect now this message is going to be a simple message it's nothing complicated the message is going to be the gospel of Jesus Christ which anybody can understand from the youngest one to the oldest one because really we're all children of God we're all we're all show of God and we need we all need to hear the gospel we need to share the gospel and the big question that I have is when I was younger was when people say Jesus died for your sins Jesus died for your sins amen amen everyone's crying but what does that mean what does Jesus Christ died for your sins you know what does that mean when you think about it what does that mean is you know people say gospel is the good news okay Jesus Christ died for my sins it's good news what does that mean it took me a little bit of my testimony 26 years to understand what that meant and for the little ones for the oldest one when I understood it when it clicked my whole life changed okay I was a crate I was crazy in the mind I remember driving past who and this is good because before you know for the little kids I never used to cry and ever used to do anything but God changed my life when I would drive past the the mental institution I told myself I belong in there but nobody knows that's what I and that's the truth I would drive on McDowell and you know the the mental to to Shania and I knew I belonged in there in my mind and I know there might be somebody here who's going crazy right here you might look pretty and perfect but you we need God we need Jesus Christ we need the gospel so God is holy kind of a question that I hear somebody speak about was what's closer to God a worm or an angel the answer is neither because God is so different he is so set apart from everything else he's the creator of the universe he's everything he a worm an angel can't even compare they are so different but when you compare it to God there is no comparison God is holy so right now we're gonna have two sinners come up our first sinner right here right in the back he has a lot of sin you can see he's wearing he's tattered up it looks like he's stole from his mom's wallet last night he disobeyed his mom he told lies he's done a lot of bad things a lot of bad things he yelled back at his mom he took the name of the Lord he took God's name in vain I have another question for a prize who can tell me one of the Ten Commandments just one Hanna perfect good job good job round of applause for Hanna for being brave so this first dinner right here he's done a lot of bad things you can tell again he's yelled at his parents he's disobeyed he's lied he's done a lot of bad things in a life and let's see what the Word of God says about people who have done things like this if you can turn your scriptures to first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9 through 11 right now let's see let's see if he can stand in the presence of God with all this sin can he stand in the presence of God so 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9 through 11 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God so do do we think that he can stand in the presence of God be in his kingdom no right amen amen I like that got some answers it's good now let's look at this guy he's wearing he it's a nice clean robe whoa he's song led last Friday he actually song lit well not okay well well scratch that so he did all he's done a lot of good things he's fed the poor he's obeyed his parents she's grown up in the message do you guys think he can stand in the presence of God or live with him for all eternity well okay well let's see him let's see him you know make a case I mean he looks pretty clean to me to doing the works that you commanded me to I've fed some poor I've gone and prayed for some sick people visited them I try to comfort those that need a comfort and I've lived a good and good life can I join you now let's read the scripture and let's see you know let's see what the scripture says about everybody so Romans you can turn to Romans 3:23 and then we'll be turning to Romans 3:10 but Romans 3:23 does anybody have or does anybody want to read the scripture a brave soul at anion okay glory amen that's that's two prizes for him thank you out a night thank you we're all have fallen short and fault yeah for all have fallen short of the glory of God Romans 3:10 says that no one is righteous there is no one that does good and I like this at the end of that verse you can hear somebody coming in and saying wait this guy he did this you fed the poor he preached she song lead he did all these good things it anticipates that one person who comes in and says but look at this guy then the scripture says no there's no one there's no one that doeth good nobody nobody does good and it's so simple once you get that you're good but anyways there's no one that does good Psalms 51 5 if we can turn to Psalms 51 5 I could just read it behold and sin was a shapen and in my man in iniquity let me pull it up [Music] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me so as we heard been hearing in the messages on Wednesday but how pastor Bernie says when were you condemned before you were born so just for everyone to get that thought just when were you condemned before you were born for the kids if everyone can repeat after me when were you condemned before I was even born when after you were born amen just to get that in your head before we were born we were already condemned we were guilty we had sinned and do you see that little stain right there at that black stain that's where he was born with you couldn't do anything about it everybody was born with that you you me I was born with that that stain right there we were all born in a quote from brother Branham and the Bible declares that we are all born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies in the presence of God right here he says the archbishop but you can put in anybody you can put in your daddy your pastor or the ministers whoever you want to put in that you think is good brother I'll me anybody right here says the archbishop but put in anybody you want to the archbishop borned in this world was as guilty as the lowest barfly in the city so we're all on the same boat so let's all pray for each other you pray for me you pray for your little ones amen so say is that does that sound like good news or bad news bad news very bad news very bad news because no one can live with God for all eternity we all fall short of the glory of God we have all the evidence right here in the scripture saying we're not worthy we're guilty you know if you stand in front the judge and you've done a crime okay I you know say you stole something and the judge looks at you and you plead oh can i I did all these good things judges even say okay yeah maybe you did but you still committed this crime you have to pay the price for this crime and that's bad news right because if there's two sides of the coin there's a heads and a tails there's a heaven and there's a and I think sometimes we're too scared to talk about you know the latter about it's all having everybody's going heaven but I think we do have to preach the whole truth because a lie is 99% the the truth and 1% why so we have to talk about the other side especially for the little ones as well so we can understand what did god save me from he say really as we can see here he saved me and we're gonna see what God did but he saved us from himself because he's a judge and we're gonna stand before the judge one day that's what he saved us from from himself now if we can put up the YouTube video of the Old Testament sacrifice they can get it up there you can turn the audio low I'm just gonna read a quote from brother Branham kind of describing the situation alright so under the Old Testament the law was when a man sinned he brought the lamb to the altar say if he transgressed any of the commandments she brought the lamb and he laid it on the altar he laid his hands upon the lamb and he confessed his sins that he was wronged and knowed he was guilty the law requires death and he brought the lamb in his stead the throat of the little lamb was cut and it began begin to kick its little feet and bleeding right here you can see what brother branham's talking about the little lamb took his place that spotless lamb that clean lamb took his place and don't worry it won't show anything so don't have to close your eyes the sinner recognized that's way for this part to come just so you can really get it in so the sinner recognized that this little lamb died in his place something had to die but when man walked away he still had the same sinful desires so now we're gonna see what God did you know we have the the lamb being slain but something happened after all those sacrifices used to be done but something happened it happened after God he came down if you guys can turn to John 1:1 in the States in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God this is God right and the Word was God glory and now John 1:14 you go down to John 1:14 and the word which is God became flesh he became flesh like me like angel but like brother Mike brother Bernie he became flesh and he dwelt among us amen so God he came down he became flesh and what did he do let's see what he did now if we can turn to Hebrews 10:17 like I mentioned in the quote before why you guys turned to the Scriptures at the end of the brother bambuco when I was talking about the video that man he still had the same desires so when he walked away from the lamb nothing changed he still wanted to steal to have that thoughts you still wanted to lie to his parents to be disobedient he still wanted to you know do all these good things and still live a double life do whatever you wanted to do he still walked away with the same desires but Hebrews 10:17 in the Hebrews chapter 10 kind of give a summary but I'll read the verse verse and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more so this verse right here this is the verse where it clicked for me brother Caleb was here Caleb do-don I was struggling for so long I had done something wrong it was small but in God's eyes you can see even if you stumble in one offense you're guilty of everything and I couldn't I was going through something that I had done and I was going crazy and crazy and crazy for one little thing just I want you guys to realize that that one little thing maybe you did it when you're right now ten twelve years old they can follow you your whole life and then God brings it back brings you to a point of depression anxiety and craziness you realize what he did for you right here in your sins everything bad you've done and iniquities will I remember no more and he will give you a new heart a flat of a heart of a fleshly heart he'll take away the evil desires all the things you want to do you know nowadays you we have it's it's just taught you know you got to do good things you got to do good things you got a you know all these you know motivational speeches and you know all the kids are on YouTube you know they see people talking about yeah if you you know if you run five miles a day your life will be forever changed nothing is going to change you nothing is gonna change you eventually you're gonna crack under the pressure only Jesus Christ can take can change you and right here his scripture says God doesn't even remember them so right now anything that the devil is just telling you you did this you remember we do this you're not worthy enough you just quote the word go read your Bible you know kids you know Muslim kids when they're six seven years old they memorized the whole Quran the whole Quran and we you know as you know sometimes we struggle just to memorize a few verses a day it's the Word of God it's life we spend so much time on YouTube Facebook I'm guilty I'm not talking about anybody here but me when I could be studying the word growing as a Christian getting revelation being happy like the song that my brother angels saying Oh what needless pain we bear Oh what needless you know our little ones go through a lot we don't realize it but the world right now when I go to the mom I gotta go with the bag over my head these kids they go through a lot in school so let's pray for them let's get them in the word so what is Jesus Christ doing right here Jesus Christ he came down in the flesh he took away the sins of the world John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever shall believe in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life you see he took away he took away his sin do you see that little black mark on him he's gone now now now let's see where he takes him that's all of our burden all your depression all of your lies everything all your anxiety your just everything that's bothering you all your worries are all your worries like oh how am I gonna pay this how am I gonna pay this or or or my son or my or my my daughter there goes it's it see it's so simple anybody can get it oh why did you just Christ died for your sins I'll tell you why because he took your sins oh he's going to take your sins away that's why he's going away with your sins alright question where where are are you where are your sins at I like you know what I like that how brother BAM talked about he he took him back to the accuser that's three prizes for a denial amen so Ken can you see any sin up here no sin and your sins and iniquities will I remember no more so isn't that good news that's good news right now look at this now Jesus Christ is coming and he's gonna he's putting his righteousness on him let's turn to Isaiah chapter 61 verse 10 glory so isaiah 61:10 reads this i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he had covered me with the robe of righteousness who as a bridegroom dekha themself with ornaments and as a bride adorned it herself with her jewels look at jesus christ he rose from the dead he died with all of our sins he came back and I was clothing us with righteousness now do we think these two people who were sinners do you think they can live with God eternally now Amen I like the enthusiasm Adonai thank you now look at Jesus Christ he died for the whole world I like a brother was telling me in the back God for God so loved the world not the message church not people who grew up with brother Branham he loved everybody you know the person at work when you walk by them you're like or at school you're like man they are not gonna go to heaven that's who we died for remember that kids that's what we tied for that's who you have to love not just just be in a little group you know it's not it's it's he came for everybody and when you realize that when you when you realize that then you can truly love everybody when when Jesus Christ comes and you realize that these guys didn't have to do anything did they have to do anything there is one thing who said it I heard it I think she wants surprise believe Wratten amen so that is the one thing that we have to do is believe if we turn to John chapter 3 verse 18 now I you know I'm sorry if if it seems like I'm reading a lot of the word but that is okay because when we you know you know like John 1:1 says for everybody for the kids this is you know we think of all the superheroes Ironman and this and that we think of all I superman whatever it may be this is the real superhero he's the he's the crew he's the creator of the universe and this is him speaking right here so this is what we should be spending our time in I remember I don't have anybody in my mind just myself if you want just all your cares all your worries spend time with God and you realized oh wait I don't have to worry I don't have to care oh wait I can depend on God all this needless pain I bear I don't see it on Jesus anymore I don't see I don't see it on him it's back with the accuser like my brother Ananias says so John 3:18 does anybody want to read it my brother amen thank you thank you for that brother so let's read it again he that believeth on him so he that believeth on who Jesus Christ right is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already so I'm sure we all know the story but sometimes we have to hear something because I'm sure I heard the gospel thousands of time times but I didn't get it tossed 26 so sometimes with the hear it over and over and over until it's like boom it clicks in your head yes yes until it clicks in your head so the story of the soldier back in the times of Abraham Lincoln when he retreated because he was scared they sent him to prison because it was a crime so he was sentenced to die what happened he had a friend who didn't want him to die so he he went to Abraham Lincoln said hey this is the situation this is what happening he was scared he's a young man and just you know you know not you know not to get sidetracked but it doesn't matter how young they are whether you're five six seven eight they understand and they can really comprehend things you know back in World War two that we're sending kids who were well very young your people would sign up illegally but people kids were doing amazing things in the scriptures you look at King David you look at all the young ones what did they do strength is in the youth the you know the the the children so we have the friend he went to Abraham Lincoln Abraham you know Lincoln he saw the situation okay he signed ok he's released and the friend goes back he goes back and say hey look at Abraham Lincoln signed your pardon you're free to go cuz he was sentenced to die the next day by a firing squad pretty much being shot by multiple people that's what a firing squad is okay and his friend came and say look your partner you free dude and the guy was like Lincoln sometimes we just can't grasp that the creator of the universe the one who made everything he put the Stars in place he he did he gave me breath of lie he gave me breath he gave me children he he took on my worry he he said I'm free yeah that's it no no no and that's that and that's what I did for a long time of my life and I think that's what a lot of us have done with you have to realize that Christianity is the only true Christianity there's a lot of denominations out there true Christianity for all the young ones and everyone is the only religion to where you don't have to do anything to live with God eternally the Muslims the Mormons the Catholic it's all you have to do do do do do in order to live with God now that's a spirit and obviously it has affected a lot of people of okay yeah I came to church you know on time and I need to come to church on time but you know you know we I have to do this I have to do this I have to do that when you just realize that Abraham Lincoln signed you free that Jesus Christ said you know what all your sins are gone there with the accuser I I don't see them and I can't repeat this enough but it's so important because that's how I was when I came to the revelation because Jesus Christ he already died he don't have to die again he doesn't have to die again he's already dead so once you realize that everything went goes away depression and why I mentioned depression because I was depressed I wanted to kill myself you know how many young people young kids I know this is children's church but do you know how many young kids like talk about suicide and kill themselves and if we don't talk about it then they suppress that and then they see everybody at church oh they're so good good I used to think that oh I'm not gonna be you save the time 60 years old like brother you don't like brother Johnny or brother Michael brother Ernie like I I'm gonna make it but thing we need to hear that those things are real the kids need to hear that those things are real and Jesus Christ took him away and they don't need pills or anything because I'm telling you where I was in my mind I was cray z yeah I don't know some of you don't believe me but I'm telling you I would be driving and I want to just run into the rail but you know I was taught my mom would die you know my parents would that they wouldn't live that's the truth but Jesus Christ when I when I just had it wasn't Oh jumping and shouting when he just realized oh my sin and iniquity are gone and that's why I felt it wasn't like it was just revelation but wherever it came from me being in the word trying to study no I was studying the word to prove Mormons wrong hey you can't work your way to heaven and the word was talking to me so amen so that's the gospel that is the good news that's why Jesus had to die for us because if he didn't as you saw this young fine gentleman he was born in sin he was born in saying all of us were born in sin your pastor was born in sin even brother Branham was born in sin because he needed a savior right brother Branham needed a savior brother so Jesus died for everybody we're all born in sin if you guys can stand up with me and if we can shake your neighbors hand one more time just realizing oh Jesus died for my neighbor Jesus died for him that for Berney Garcia oh brother Jeff sister Maria all the young ones he died for everybody amen and again what what do you have to do is you just only believe that was the theme song of brother branham's ministry only believe if we can sing that song actually if you guys can sing with me that would be awesome amen only really whoa [Music] [Music] so tomorrow if you feel a tug in the winner young tomorrow or I want to start a relationship I want your righteousness and you realize all he gave me his righteousness [Music] Oh Oh [Music] possible [Music] why don't we give the Lord Jesus a clap offering here man so
