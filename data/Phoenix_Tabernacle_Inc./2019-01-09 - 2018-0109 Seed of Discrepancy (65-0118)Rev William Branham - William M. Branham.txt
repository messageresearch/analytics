Matthews the 13th chapter and beginning with the 24th verse of the 13th chapter of Saint Matthew listen close to the reading of the word my words will fail but his will not another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while he slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade's was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the terriers also so the servant of the householder came and said unto Him sir did a sound not so good see to not feel from which then has it Terriers and he said unto them an enemy has done this and the servant said unto Him wilt thou then that we go gather them up but he said nay that's why you gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them let them both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest I will send forth the Reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind damaged bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into the garner did you notice gather the Terriers first and bundle land now reading this there was something strange come to me while we're setting up on top of the Catalina Mountains the other night and prayer and then I thought where could I gather a word that I could use for this that I wanted to speak on tonight and I went down and found a word of discrepancy so I got the dictionary look what the word discrepancy means and it means it's a sewing discard are are being contrary as Webster says sowing a discord something different are be contrary to what's already been so I thought text tonight I call it the seed of discrepancy and trust that the Lord will bless his word now as we approach him and we also know he interpreted in verse 36 and and 243 how that this seed matured and while we're at it let's just read that also verse 36 now unto 43 and when Jesus had sent the multitude away he went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man and the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the terriers are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sought them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a far the fired and there shall be weeping be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their father who has an ear let him hear that's Jesus given the interpretation of the parable himself therefore we know then what the interpretation means and now as we have approached this of this sowing of the seed and the reaping now he interprets it and then believed that Jesus was speaking this parable in his day but was meaning it to be at the end of the world or the end of the age which is this day and I believe this little text tonight is a very appropriate for the hour that we're living in because Jesus distinctly said here that the gathering would be at the end of this world that that's when the in would be the gathering of the wheat and also the gathering of the terriers and burning them and to take in the wheat into the kingdom and I believe it was this wave and another scripture leads me to believe this way I have written down here is Matthew 24:24 where it said that talked about this the seat the seat of discrepancy Jesus said that the two would be so close together two it would deceive the very elect it if it were possible almost exactly the same another place in the scripture where it's written that the rain falls on the just and the unjust I remember my first experience of ever coming amongst the Pentecostal people as at Mishawaka Indiana and I was at a great convention hall about like this where the north and the south had come together because of them days of the segregation they had to meet up there they were too great orders of the Pentecostal brethren I had never heard of them are met them before the first time I ever heard speaking in and at the end of the row of the condition me being not a member among them is the young Baptist minister I set way back in the bank and I remember the first time I heard anyone speaking tones I didn't even know what what was all about and then these two men mainly set up in the front one would speak in tongues and the other would interpret what the man said well I just started studying my Bible as hard as I could there then and found out that that was scriptural that's exactly what the scripture the Holy Spirit would do well about a day after that that night my heart was so stirred a step in the corn field I didn't have enough money to get a bed so I just had enough money to get home on and I got me some doughnuts couple days older rolls it was and for my breakfast I was welcome to eat with him but I didn't have no money to put in and M days that was in the depression 19 and 33 so ISM it was pretty hard going and so I thought well I don't want to eat with them but I want to know what they've got they've got something in I haven't so that morning us they asked me all ministers comes the platform is just identify yourself who you are where you're from well I'm I just said william branham evangelist jefferson they'll sit down well at that time I was a youngest minister on the platform and the next day they called me to the platform to speak and then after I spoke father we had a great time and then I begin to meet different people inviting me to their churches then actually after that one I thought if I could only get word these two main man was that spoke in tongues and interpreted that was burning me up in my heart I wanted it so bad well as I've told you at the beginning a little gift that you pull over your gifts and callings are without repentance you had more your life that you're born with them if there are gifts of God so always that's a little bitty baby it always happen to me people who knows me all my life they're all that's true well if I thought I didn't know what it was then I call it I just didn't know what it was I thought if I could ever talk to them well and the spirit was in the building felt like this really the Spirit of God so I doctors talked to one of him and I asked him a few questions and he was a real genuine Christian there was no doubt about that that man was a real believer and the next man when I talked to him if I ever met a hypocrite that was one of them that man was actually he his wife was a blond-headed woman and he had children by two children by a black headed woman and I thought well now what here it is I'm all mixed up I'm a fundamentalist it must be the word or it it isn't right and here's that spirit one rang out partying all on door genuine the other was no good at all in the spirit poor little both of them now how can that be I had me puzzled two years later I've been praying in a cave where I'd go to pray got dusty in the cave and one afternoon I walked out laid my Bible on the log and the wind floated open to Hebrews the sixth chapter which said that in the last days how it would be if we fell away from the truth and renewed ourselves again unto repentance there was no more sacrifice for sin and how the thorns and thistles which is 9/2 rejection whose end is to be burned but the rain come up the falling off earth often to water it to dress it but the thorns and thistles would be rejected but the week would be gathered but well it just a win had to blow that open well I just laid the Bible down again and I thought well now I'll just and here come the wind and blown it open that happened three times and I thought well now that's strange then I was raised up I thought Lord why would you open that Bible for me to read that when I get down to that were thorns and thistles which is 90 rejection in the study burn although why would you open that to be there and as looking out across now these real visions come without pulling into any gear that's this God see and I looked and I seen her earth that was turning out in front of me and I seen it was all disked up there was a man dressed in white went around sowing wheat and entering he went around the curvature of the earth around come a man looked horrible he was dressed in black and he was throwing a we seats all over they both come up together and when they did they both was thirsty because of rain was needed and each one look like was praying with his little head bent over lord send the rain Centuri the great clouds come up and the rain fell upon both of them when it did the little wheat jumped up and begin to say praise the Lord praise the Lord and the little wheat jumped up rise the same side and said praise the Lord praise the Lord then the vision was interpreted the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoice in and hypocrites Christians and all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits they are known that's the only way it can ever be known then you see that now since Wild Oats while we eat greens sometimes it person eights a genuine a domestic green so close that it would deceive the very elect 'add I think we're living in a timely age well these things should be a preach tone and talked about notice in verse 41 the two also very close so close to the last day still he didn't do he could not dis depend on some certain church to separate them say the Methodists or the Baptist's of the Pentecostals to separate him he said he sends his angels separate an angel is coming to bring the separation the segregation between the right and the wrong and no one can do that but the angel of the Lord he's the one that it's going to tell which is right which is wrong God said he will send His angels at the last time not angels down to here but angels at the last time and would gather together we know that this is the coming harvest time now Donny Joe is actually interpreted a messenger and we see that there are seven angels of the seven churches and now Noah through the church ages notice who he said that the sores were and also what the seed was one the sort was he the son of God he went for sowing seed and an enemy came behind him which was the devil and sowed the seed of discrepancy behind the sowing of the right seed now friends that has happened through every age since we've had a world exactly all the way from the beginning it started the very same thing now he said the seed of God the Word of God Jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seed and ever seed will bring forth of its kind and now if the Christian the children of God the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the age that they're living in or the promised seed of that age God gave his word at the beginning in each age has had it see it's time this promises now when Noah came on the scene and he was the seed of God the Word of God for that age when Moses came he could not come with Noah's message it wouldn't work because he was a seed of God at that time then when Christ come he could not come with Noah or Moses age it was his time for a virgin to conceive and to bring forth a son and he would be the Messiah now we've lived through Luther's age Wesley's age mentally staged all down through the ages in the Pentecostal age in each age has given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifests that promise word is the seed of that age according what Jesus said right here they are the children of the kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seed of the kingdom at that age notice the carriers was the one the enemy Satan who sowed discord are the the Sita of discrepancy he was the one guilty of doing this horrible thing Satan sold his seed from the beginning when God placed his first harvest of human upon the earth Adam of course as yet knew that there was a a knowledge of truth right wrong and he had never come to that as yet but we find out God gave his children his word for their defense that we have no other defense than the Word of God that is our defense there's no bombs no shelters no hiding places though Arizona's or California's or wherever it is there's only one defense we have and that is the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us which is Christ Jesus he is our only defense being in him we are safe not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer did you know that he this born of God does not commit sin he cannot see him it's not even in few different while David said blessed it is a man who God will not impute sin when you are in Christ you have no desire to sting the worshiper once purge has no more consciousness in you don't desire not to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not because you're in Christ how can you be in the center when you're in the sinless one and God only sees him who you are in now this harvest time at the beginning when God SODIS seat upon the earth and gave it in the hearts of his children his family to keep that word that was her only defense keep that word here come the enemy in and broke that barrier by sowing the seed of discrepancy contrary to the Word of God if that was discrepancy in the beginning it's still anything that will add anything to the Word of God is still the seed of discrepancy I don't care what comes from if it's from organization it is from military sources if it's from political powers anything that's contrary to the Word of God is the seed of discrepancy when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and says that the days of miracles is fast that's the seed of discrepancy when a man stands and says that he's the minister a pastor of a church of somewhere and he does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body same yesterday today forever that's a scene of discrepancy when he says that miracles and Apostolic age past that seed of discrepancy when they say there's no such a thing is divine healing that seed of discrepancy then the world is full of it this crowds out and chokes out the week we notice that the first store of the seat of discrepancy was branded the devil and we know it was and Genesis 1 that we find out over here in in the book of Matthew the 13th chapter Jesus still Brants any discrepancy to his word as being the devil and this 1956 anything that source discrepancy contrary to the written word of God or puts any private interpretation to it it is a seed of discrepancy God will not honor he can't it won't mix it certainly will not it's like mustard seed it won't mix with anything else you came to table read it it's got to be the genuine thing seed of discrepancy now we find when God told his seed in the Garden of Eden we find out that it brought forth unable but when Satan sold his seed of discrepancy it brought forth a Cain one brought forth a righteous one one brought forth an unrighteous one because that Eve listen to the word of discrepancy contrary to the Word of God and to start of the ball of sin rolling right there's Road ever since and we'll never get it all out until the angels comes and saturates the thing and God takes his children to the kingdom and the terrors will be burned notice those two vines if we just had more time on this subject but just to hit the hot spots so you're right into praying for the sick in the next few minutes notice there seeds crew together just exactly like God said over here also in the thirteenth chapter of our text tonight of Matthew let them grow together now Cain went to the Land of Nod found himself a wife and married and Abel was fluent and God raised up saith to take his place and the generation started moving on between right Rome now we notice they've gathered each one of them time after time and God had to it got so wicked - God had to destroy but they finally came forth until both of those seeds the seed of discrepancy and the seed of God put forth third genuine heads and that wound up in Judas is a carrot and in Jesus Christ or he was the seed of God he was the beginning of the creation of God he was nothing less than God and judas iscariot was born the son of perdition come from hell return to hell Jesus Christ was the son of God the Word of God made manifest Judas Iscariot and his discrepancy was the seed of the devil come to the world and for deceit just like he was at the beginning King his former father Judas only played Church he wasn't really sincere he didn't actually have faith he didn't ever betray Jesus but he sold that seat of discrepancy he thought that he can make friends with the world Mammon and also had friends ship with Jesus but it was too late for him to do anything about it when the dead our team when he did this evil thing he crossed the separating line between going forward and returning back he had to go on in the way that he went as a deceiver he sold the seat of discrepancy he tried to find favor with those great organizations of that day with the Pharisees and Sadducees and thought he make yourself a piece of money and would be popular among the people if that doesn't cost so many people that get in that the scrap time to find favor with man let's find favor with God not with man but that's what Judas done when this discrepancies headed up in him and we know that Jesus was the word st. John wants it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt here among us then the word is deceived and the seed become flesh and dwelt among us if Judas was the seed of the enemy and the discrepancy it also become flesh and dwelt among us in the person of Judas Iscariot he never had no real real faith he hadn't of what he thought was a faith there's such a thing as having faith and a make-believe faith and a genuine faith of God will believe in God and God is the word it'll never add nothing to it the Bible tells us if we add one word or take one word away our part will be taken from the book of life revelation 22:18 the last posing chapter in the first beginning the first book of the Bible God told them not to break one word or that every word must be kept famous live in that word Jesus in the middle of the book come along and said that in his age and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that it it comes out and out of God in the closing age of Revelations foretold to us and whosoever shall take one word out of the book or add one word to it his part will be taken from the book of life therefore there can be nothing shadowy just a genuine unadulterated Word of God that's sons of God daughters of God who's not born for the will of man or by shaking a hand of son form of baptism but born in the Spirit of God by the Holy Ghost and the word manifesting itself through them that's genuine seat of God the enemy John's Church and becomes very Orthodox in a creed or something but that's not that's discrepancy anything that interferes with that a string of genuine truth of God's Word how do we know we say well the of you got a right to interpret it no sir no man has a right to interpret God's Word he's his own interpreter he promises there's any dozen that's the interpretation there are when he promised it then he fulfills it that's the Terr petition of it he think contrary to God's Word is the discrepancy absolutely now as I said Judas has no real faith he had a make-believe faith the era of faith that he thought that that was the son of God but he didn't know that was the son of God he wouldn't have done it in a manual compromise on this Word of God being the truth he's got a make-believe faith kanya one shriveled God hang on that word unites to go up certain minister of Arizona of a great famous school here in this city came to me and said I want to straight me out on something I said when you get a chance I said this is the best chance I know of come on over and so he came over he said mister randomly do you're trying so big you're sincere in your honest but you're trying to introduce to a world at the Stalag doctrine and said the Apostolic age ceased with the Apostles I said the first thing I'd like to ask you my brother do you believe it every word of God is inspired he said yes sir I certainly do I said then would you show me in the word were the Apostolic age ceased now you show me where it is I believe with you now said the rider of the apostolic the one that had the keys to the kingdom on the day of Pentecost when the Apostolic age wasn't introduced they said many brother what can we do to be saved he said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost further promises into you into your children and the famous farro even as many as the Lord our God shall call now how can the word contradict itself a man said I have an awful cold announcer hustling so to the now you tell me is God still calling if God's still calling then the Apostolic age is still in existence certainly as many as the Lord our God shall call ever called ever will call as many as he shall call it will still be the Apostolic age or Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever how we find today at this discrepancy has been sowed through every age if it was possible to get it in the next 10 or 15 minutes I would do it but you can't down through the ages we are all most all of us read the Bible and now like when Jesus come and he found that discrepancy contrary he was the Word made manifest he was God's interpretation of the word because he said search the Scriptures for you then you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me there you are he he was the interpretation of the word and every part again son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word your ripped epistles read of all man yes notice he said in vain they do worship Me teaching discrepancy for doctrine in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the discrepancy doctoring a man Creed's a man teaching that to be the Word of God when it has nothing to do with the Word of God look each age for do such a crop every age has did it and ours is no excuse we had the same thing and a greater age of it than all the other ages put together or this is the ending of world's history this is a great discrepancy that's ever been upon the earth is on the face of the earth today discrepancy in other ages pulled him away from the true and living God two idols today Jesus said in Matthew 24:24 that it would be so close to when the scenes are very elected if it was possibly talk about discrepancy or is so cunning Satan is among the people and just such a theologian such a Doctor of Divinity can teach that word almost perfect Jesus said so but just watching there'll be some where he said well now that wasn't for this oh yes it is too because God said it was look what it did them same discrepancy bought the God's wrath upon the days of Noah when God sent His Prophet out and preached as a flaming fire call repentance to the people and the discrepancy ground it out then what does Satan do come right behind and ham and started sowed it again the doctor I'd long Campos is the great prophet to bring the children of Israel up out of the wilderness what happened Moses the great prophet of God breaking them the absolutely truth indicated truth you'd met God God through that he admitting how those people back there those priests in there had the religions the rituals our rites and everything but Moses stood as a vindication of the interpretation of the word don't forget that Moses was God's interpretation of his promise he said a good God's interpretation what happened the church just got started out of Egypt on his feet a few days what happened Satan come along with his discrepancy in the person the second Cain which was Balaam and he's so discrepancy amongst them we know that giant that Balaam the teaching of Balaam that we were all the same we've served the same God you do fundamentally he was right because he offered us sacrifice that God offered seven Rams seven books on seven altars and prayed to the same God just as perfect as Moses did down into orders just exactly the same but there were not the same before shouting to us what would come to pass there was again Cain manifested in the person of Balaam and there was God manifested in the person of Moses and Terpening his words to a human be making yourself known his province through a human being and the discrepancy raised up solely to do it in the time of Judas there he come with his discrepancy and remember this sin that those people believe that we're all the same we worship the same God we shall all come to the same church we should be the same people that sin was never forgiven Israel jesus said himself they all are dead they perish all the three of them that was the ones who helped own and believed the promise when the Weakland said we cannot take the land is too much for us and so forth Caleb and Joshua still the people said we're more than able to take it because God promised it to us I don't care what the opposition is and we still can provide that is another holy garden and still have a power of Bob the separators God said so Apostolic age has never ceased that it will not see it goes on so we find the same old sort of discrepancy and remember that sin was never forgiven how brother if it was never forgiven then what about now when the the real seed of all the ages is coming together notice this great thing that Balaam did it went on and all and it finally ended in the coming of Judas insecurity and Jesus what was it Judas and Jesus was just exactly a figure of Cain and Abel for as Judas was religious so was Cain religious Cain build an altar he made a sacrifice he worshiped God he was just as sincere in it as the other and was but you see he didn't have the revelation of what the word was he thought it was Adam and Eve and eat some apples are some fruit and table by revelation no that was wrong it was a flood that brought about any offer to lament God testified his offering was right then he got jealous and tried to kill his brethren and as he killed his brother upon the same order that his sacrifice died on the lamb died upon the altar so did Judas is a carrot betray Jesus Christ upon the altar of God and killed him just as Cain killed Abel because Cain was the seed of discrepancy and soul was Balaam the hireling prophet a man who were ought to know better and God warned in two signs and wonders and even a huge speaking in unknown tongues and still he went that all just to save he was born to be a sort of a discrepancy and if Jesus predicted this age to end up in the greatest discrepancy that ever was the lady of see a church age lukewarm that put him out of the church how could it be anything else but that discrepancy certainly it is it ends in that age and it was Cain and Abel again on Calvary now I noticed as ever as soon as Jesus went away went into heaven the Holy Spirit was set back that was the seed the life giver unto the word as we spoke last night it's the one that quickens the word quickening springs to life the genuine Holy Spirit only brings to life the word that it is it won't bring your Creed to life it can't because it's nothing out of the cream it is the life of the Word of God for it is gone and quickens that body now notice as they did they did the Bible said it's and John spoke to the children and said little children you have heard of the Antichrist which was to come into the world said which already is in the world and it working in the children of disobedience now that was long about three years after the coming of the Holy Ghost we find when the Holy Ghost come the real seat real life giver to the seed then here comes that discrepancy in again and notice all it was in it the real word have been vindicated them puppets of all had vindicated the Word of God to be the truth as they went down if anybody ever read the Gnostic Council or the pre na city council than fifteen days of bloody politics well then a bunch of Romans down there wanted to bring in and make a denomination how that church prophets came in wrapped his sheep skinny herbs and stood for that word what did it do it had to be like chained it had to be like able one had to die certainly it did and the word lost its influence amongst the people and they all voted out the true word and took in dog was the discrepancy of the early Catholic Church they added a pope dad and a bishop they added this that the other they've taken away the real true meaning of period of a Marian and all the rest of and made idols and made nothing but just a pagan ceremony out of so-called Christian religion what was it seed of discrepancy and organized organized for the first time owner a church what was it that's steeped of discrepancy which started sewing something added to taken away who ever heard in the Bible not eat meat on Friday whoever you heard in the Bible of anything is frankly instead of baptizing his mercy whoever heard of those things the Hail Mary or something whoever her son this rotten tommyrot of these promises to take all Kittel greasy right just guilty the least is guilty the home who ever heard of God ever dealing in an organization show me one time it won't ever organized and ever stayed alive they died on me today and never did rise again huh if something takes place it's time for God to move it kill the influence amongst the people same things been done today they kill the influence at all that bunch of holy rollers there's nothing to you on this watch this fancy beat the word face-to-face and see what is see if God interprets his own word gods day for these stones to rise children Abraham a word have been thoroughly vindicated by them early Christians how God delivered them from everything in diseases and they had prophets and they spoke in tongues interpreting gave messages that's proved to be exactly the truth every time but in the face of all that vindicated words the people voted it out and voted a denomination that's the mother of all organizations both are fully mature down they started Seaton again it died out but it bloomed again in the days of Luther as we know from the former message shown the morning of the breakfast bloom down in the day of Luther now what did they do on these the epic great man died they did an organization it bloomed out and again in the days of John Wesley when I'm angle is with all their eternal securities and everything had founded up into a place what almost universalism and what happened God raised up a man named John Wesley's laid the whole thing and as soon as he died him and as burying them what happened they organized and now you got all kinds of Methodist then along comes one of the other Alexander Campbell John Smith one more Bonnie all broke the Pentecost coming out of all of it what happened then they did run well what did he injure you you went right back in the st. but you come out of right back in the same slop went back to discrepancy in to make organizations you had to compromise on the word and every time God has sent something new you could they receive it right discrepancy again and notice as I said of the day that first little husk and come forth from this root comes up into the LEAs up into the fossil then back into the stock again it comes out that little husk a wheat almost look like the green itself and we thought it was but when you open up there's no grain there at all it's only the supporter for the green to grow by and it dies also on the knife goes right out of it goes into the green notice so they call the churches as sowed we find out today that our so-called churches even our Pentecostals we went out we couldn't be satisfied we had to make groups of our own everything come up we had to have this we have this we had to have another group this fellow raised up said he's coming to wipe out those ah he's come with a white horse aren't we makes you groups see what is it sewing up discrepancy when he comes whatever it is he'll interpret his own word when he comes let's wait till that time gets to talking about that you don't even get the message of the day always part of what God's gonna do or what he has done and ignored what he's doing that's the way we get discrepancies in it how we noticed that today our churches or all of our churches has sold to the winds and are reaping the whirlwind we don't have the prayer meetings we don't have the service service who used to have what's the matter we fled on the bars on everything so keeping our Pentecostal churches setting full of Bob Harrod women that use not be permitted painted faces wearing fingernail polish is all kind of stuff you know man out here with like Ricky's and so forth Mary three or four times and deacons oh what a discrepancy its Bell how do they do it not wouldn't have in his church they have to go to an organization to get into it somebody afraid to say something that cause to be kicked out of the organization God give us man who's not connecting with nothing but God and His Word that'll tell the truth about it exactly what we need what have we done so discrepancy we so do the winds and now we're reaping the whirlwind notice that they're now being gathered together for the Bernie did you notice Jesus said first gather them together Bunim then put all the bundles in one pile now Birnam there's a little bundle called Methodist Baptist Presbyterian loser they're all gathered together in the World Council of Churches what is it forget it a.m. first father knew young did you notice he gathers the carriers first gets him away from the wheat separates him shelter them together and burn them they're all to be burned but the judgments of God Saur discrepancy among the people things that say having a form of godliness into nine of power thereof denying the word just to hold up some religious rights or some dogma that somebody's injected in trying to put in the Word of God it won't work it's a discrepancy I screamed today as it wasn't the great prophet of longer door Amos when he comes down in that city said I'm not a prophet or son of a prophet but if the lion roars who can be fear is that when God speaks who can the prophesy he predicted judgment upon that generation said the very God that you claim to serve will destroy you you put this it's on tape you remember the very doubt that these people now that's gathering all this great big harvest of of World Council of Churches and you're going to have to go into Church can't stay out of it you're either going to be in officially get out of it or you're going into it ain't gonna be no middle ground they'll be the mark of the beast no man can buy or sell except he that has the mark or Scott the discrepancy now stay out of it get out of it play it stay away from it the God that they claim they're serving will destroy him the Great God of love who won't set far jesus prayed that we should all be one then he also said how can you walk together to all killers to be agreed he said for one like he and the father are one and the father was the word and he was the word made manifest he was one with the father because he was the manifestation of God's promised word and so is it today or any other day yes sir the God is what he wants us to be one how can this be one this the denying the virgin birth and this doctor and I divine healing and this that all of a mess like that some other people don't even even God maybe was the son of God leave as the son of Joseph called the son of God certainly the twin brother to the Luther and swinglish lead that that he was absolutely just a good man the Christian Science said he was a prophet just an ordinary man he wasn't divine what he wasn't embodies our greatest deceiver the world ever had he was gone or he was nothing he was defined he was deity himself a spatula sterling that's what he was now we see the discrepancy has come in we know that it's shared nobody can deny oh my just notice he will destroy that group that clean they're serving God you watch it God planted his seed I'm close he calls this time to start the prayer life God plated his seat and his seed is Christ I'm gonna preach on that dip unite or God decided to put his name Lord putting a bit one of the breakfast is when I have a little more time look he is the only way of escape here's the only true potentate he's the only true God none other besides he I am God and God alone he's dead jesus said this is the command here your Israel I'm the Lord your God just one God I am he what do you look for another another will come I come in my father's name and you receive me not but another no comedies own name and him you will receive and they did it at Nicaea are you a Christian I'm Baptist are you Christian on Pentecost are you Christian on method it's another name but when it comes to that name of Jesus Christ and walked is this far from it as a can they don't want nothing to do with it or he is the word the word declares itself notice the only way of escape he is the Rose of Sharon the Bible said he was every title in the Bible of God belongs to Jesus Christ he was Alpha Omega the beginning and the end he that was which is and shall come the Routan offspring of David both root and offspring of David the Morningstar the Rose of Sharon the lilies of Valley the Alpha Omega father son Holy Ghost all in Jesus Christ he was the full manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh to dwell among us exactly what he was he was the Rose of Sharon what did they do with the rolls of Sharon they squeezed it out mashed it out to get the perfume out a beautiful rolls has to be squeezed down to get the perfume from the rose that was a beautiful life and there was a life lived like it but it had to be squeezed out on Calvary Dena took the anointing of the rolls of Sharon and put it up Aaron he had to be anointed with that or to go in before the Lord in the Holy Place and the holy pail he had to be anointed with the Rose of Sharon to going to sprinkle of mercy see each year and that anointing must be up on him a sweet-smelling Savior unto the Lord packing the blood of the Lamb before him action also been sprinkled by the land pomegranates that bells around his garments yet to walk a certain step playing holy holy holy unto the Lord notice he is that Rose of Sharon that sweet-smelling Savior the anointing upon his people it cannot come before you but then he create any other thing but anointed with that Rose of Sharon the word he also is the lily of the valley now how do you get opium you get opium when you take a lily and squeeze it out you get the opium doctors used it in their laboratories take a man just nervous and frustrated our woman she feels like she's gonna go crazy she's walking the floor and screaming she's in hysterics a doctor will take a little office Lily opium and push it into her arm or vein somewhere his and they fightin down all over for a while but just as soon as that opium dies out here they come again worse than they ever was but I'll tell you friends that's only a type of the genuine opium from the lily of the valley that I know he is the lily of the valley he was squeezed out on Calvary he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were here in that that squeezing out of the flowers he was the flower he's the greatest flower that ever grown was this Lily LaValley and this great Rose of Sharon now he hangs tonight span in between heavens and earth I believe he was that time rather to to take away the sin of the world and to bring healing back to the world in the Bible said that he's the same yesterday today and forever random when God told Moses in the wilderness which was a type of him to lift up a brass Serpent and brass represents sin judge the serpent represents a brass serpent represents sin already judged as brass is divine judgment like the brazing altar where the sacrifices laid all Alijah looked up and he said the sky was like brass divine judgement upon an unbelieving nation and a back slid for God brass represents judgment divine judgment and the serpent represented sin already judged and Jesus was that serpent made sin for us and took the judgments of God upon him he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace upon him and with His stripes we are healed Oh God's got his cabinet full of opium tonight for you Christian friends your sick and suffering oh you're weary is just too hard for you you can't stand it much longer your boat while in this modern day that we're living did you just hear lifeline tonight not what they said it that Russia says in 55 if they'll absolutely take full control of the whole world before that can happen the rapture has to come so I'm not closed is it friend it's right here close now at hand won't you seeking tonight with all your heart he is the lily of the valley and he's the same yesterday today and forever he shared tonight to lift himself up among his people just like Moses lifted up this the sin sign judge and not only stand but sickness remember Jesus said as Moses lifted up the brass serpent so much the Son of Man be lifted up what it Moses lifted up for force in unbelief and for sickness Jesus has lifted up also for sin sickness and unbelief he was the same thing now tonight in the days when we got this great discrepancy Jesus Christ promised in Luke that in the days of the before the coming of the Lord would be like it was in the days of Sodom and when the son of man would reveal himself like the Son of man revealed himself to Abraham down there Elohim God made flesh among people and dwelt there with Abraham and surety told him what Sarah was thinking of setting behind him in the tent that he had never seen told her what she had called her named Sarah Abraham not his not his name Abram he started out with but Abraham not Sarah sa RA but sa RA H where is thy wife Sarah said she's in the pits on she said I'm go to visit you according to the time of eyghon she lives he said why did she laugh now Jesus said just before this great discrepancy is gathered and burned that the Son of Man will redeem himself in the same manner as he did fan and that's what is it it's a lifting up of trash before you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever here believe it hey Dennis power head stand for prayer dear God we love you your work is so so food for with us Lord we just love it we live by it Lord it seems that our capacity is never sufficient we just love to sit at your table around your word and enjoy the blessings Lord when we come together like yours brothers and sisters whose been blood fought for the Son of God who is the purchase of your blood and we come here tonight Lord we've dedicated these nights or praying for the sick and according to the Scriptures you said that by the stripes we worry it isn't necessary to pray them only confess our sins for by your stripes we were past tense healed oh what a day of salvation what a what a promise by Emanuel that is certainly true you said a little while in the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me or I the personal pronoun of I I will be with you even in you to the end of the world it at the end of the time this great consummation you said just before it happened so be just like before the fire fell in Sodom and burn up the Gentile world that there would come a revelation again of the Son of Man just like it was at Sodom father me that people not miss it not pray God is a crude little thing if I said wrong forgive me pull it into a gear I love them Lord I pray that they won't miss it that just be one of the great they ever sick flicked it blind whatever it is in here Lord be healed tonight may ever sinner be saved right in their hearts now if they are unbeliever may they accept Christ at this moment granted father it's all in your hand we commit ourselves to you to see you come among us and you said in Saint John 14:12 he that believeth the need that works that I do shall he do also how we know that you made yourself known to the people for you was that prophet that Moses said that would raise up they hadn't had prophets for hundreds of years discrepancy was on ever hand but yet the Word of God had to be fulfilled so the word become flesh and so did the discrepancy and father we see it again today the discrepancy becoming one great big bundle and we see the word coming in the same way blessed us tonight father we commit ourselves to you with your word whatever you have need for us to do do with us Lord in Jesus name [Music] maybe you want to tell us something so [Applause] [Applause] did you ever picture or the enemy was coming and they were all gathered together and they the enemy was such a great force and the Spirit of God fell upon a man and told him it he prophesied instead were to go and lay and wait and then destroy their enemy there it comes again there's the place to destroy your enemy see take the hand of God the hand of God is Christ of course the word so take that in your hearts tonight while we call the prayer line I'll be Billy give

this is closed if I can touch that men's garments I'll be made well honey no it's a story alright and what did she do she touched him and went over and stood down and Jesus turned around he knew where she was that is that right he knew water trouble was is that right II knew water trouble us so he told her what trouble of and she felt in her body that the blood issue had stopped is that right because why she had touched him now how many Christians here tonight that know according to Hebrews the book of Hebrews that Jesus right now is a high priest the high priest that could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities dizzy alright if he is the same high priest the same office high priest how would he act then he'd act just the same as he did then do you me that he would act just the same as he did then if you can believe that all right how many believe that raise after himself a believer all right before they form the prayer line let's have a prayer line out there I know you sure

of knowing what you are who you are or you come from what you want nothing about it I'm just a manga that's right this same picture from one time in the Bible Saint John the 4th chapter I said what you do brother Bram just and a while ago just pulled over that little gear see I don't know see he has to do it I don't know how did that woman out there I never seen that woman in my life she's a total stranger to me I believe it was a woman who is a person's heel just now that they're the audience we are we're strangers to one another that's right wave your hand like this I never seen the woman but she was sitting there believing she touched something did she it wouldn't do no good to touch me but I can't you see that the Bible is exactly the Word of God he's the same yesterday today and forever we become Tabernacles of that Holy Spirit which is Christ see that's the real seat then of that real Holy Spirit gets into the real seat of the word not and just won't take part of it because the devil uses that you've got to take it all every word of it cause he's not half God he's all gone and that's what takes place now yours a woman I've never seen her Jesus found a woman like this one time maybe not the same condition I don't know and he's setting out it well he hadn't need to go down to Samaria and we find out - Samaria was under the hill and he's going to Jericho rather he went around bout Samaria and come to a city of psychic and he sat down on the well and sent his disciples away for food how many races of people are they in a world three ham Shem and Japheth people we all come from Noah the rest the world was destroyed at that time only three races people that Jew Gentile and Samaritans which was half Jew and Gentile that's all the races in the world just three everything in God is perfect in three like these treatment I was talking of tonight three stages of discrepancies three stages of word made flesh so forth now anything he had talked to the Jews told Philip when he brought Nathanael up that where he was that I seen him when he was our the tree its host Andrew it brought Peter up he said your name is Simon and you shall be called Peter for now and said you're the son of Jonas see now that was all Jews but here he goes to a Gentile not a Gentile but a Samaritan now is the Gentiles time he never performed that one time to Gentiles search the scriptures never but he promised to Luke 22 that he would do it just before the company but he sat down there and here come a half Jew is gentile out a woman and he said to her woman uh bring me a drink she said why you shouldn't ask that so much we are there's a segregation here you're June and I'm a Samaritan he said but if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink what was he doing I'm down here as soon as he found water trouble us well he told hurt took hold in her husband she said she didn't have any he said that's right you've had five now look when the pharisees seen him do that right that discrepancy right amongst the word what did they say they said this man's Beelzebub a fortune-teller and Jesus said whoever spoke that on the Holy Ghost when they come to do the same would never be forgiven there's your discrepancy but he said he would the reason Deana samosa mochi god bless you in this evening okay cool so mean Sokka didn't know struggles to profit honest a
