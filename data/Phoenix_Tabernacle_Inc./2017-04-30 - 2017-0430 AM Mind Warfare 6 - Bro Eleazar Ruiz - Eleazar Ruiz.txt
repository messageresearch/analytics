got to say this so if you want to blame somebody for taking too much time is brother Betto Romero okay okay here it goes so we presented the baby we're presented the baby this morning brother Betto says I prefer to use the word dedication it's it's actually the same thing but when you really get down to it it's got a little bit more teeth so what we're doing this morning we're presenting the baby and guess what we're also dedicating it but the dedication is to the parents now they got to dedicate time to the baby to raise them up in the admonition to a Divine being that's God to the Lord

only ones that would maintain their sanity would be the bride of Christ the question is are you in that number amen that's the real question while we read our scripture I'm going to ask Sister Sarah Rosco to come to the piano I I asked her to sing this song now just in case if you're wondering what the message is going to be this morning I started preaching and if you didn't write that down well brother Bram said you've already missed it we've already started preaching even in this the song that's going to be sung is part of the preaching now I know you didn't come to see me but you came to hear from God the title is mind Warfare number six I never meant it to be a series cuz trust me I'm not that smart I'm not that smart to say I'm going to preach a series and just I started a message and never finished and so we just went to number three and number four how many remember brother Bernie putting well this morning it's a supplement to mind Warfare number six so let's go ahead and uh open up our Bibles to Proverbs 23:7 proverbi and that'll be slide number four brother Eli would you stand to honor the word brother brandham said we stand to say Pledge of Allegiance we can stand to pledge allegiance to the Lord Proverbs 23:7 uh for as a man thinketh in his heart so is [Music] he Heavenly Father come and anoint your word father come and anoint my mouth my tongue my heart and may

Jesus amen thank you sister Sarah graas you know brother bradam said what's good what's a bouquet of flowers do me when I'm dead says give them to me while we're alive amen so I I want to give Sister Sarah a little B uh she's she's a daughter of a pastor in Colombia in colia and uh she has a tremendous music Ministry and uh they call her the Joanna because she has stood through thick and thin with her father and in his ministry and uh sister I just want to tell you I admire you very very much you know the funny thing about it is that they're both Sagittarius and I'll tell you this whole this last couple of weeks it's been crazy just looking at them when one of them doesn't do something the other one does I might as well tell I'm going to tell on her is that okay so we were at a restaurant and we were just talking and Sister Sarah grabs her Burger slips right through her hands and land on her and it's a mess but it's okay because that's what happens amen amen so this morning's message it's a supplement to mind Warfare number six the subtitle is the soul of man and I I want to focus on this little uh thing that brother Bram calls the inside of the inside now I dedicate this message to all the men in Phoenix tabernac tabernac Phoenix thank you you're welcome brother amen amen I dedicate this message to all the men at Phoenix Tabernacle is that your mother that's your mother isn't it welcome sister it's it's good to see you yeah that's ch's mother-in-law amen amen the inside of the inside I finally understood brother it's also good to see you I saw you here a month ago and I didn't I meant to say I just I love every single one of you okay here I'm going to open up my mind to you I'm in my living room of my home and I'm sipping a cup of coffee and that's where I'm at right now and it's good to have every single one of you in the living room of my father's house welcome let's just Fellowship around the word I finally understood what brother Bernie was trying to do with us I finally understood what brother Bernie was trying to do with us men you know what he was trying to make every single one of us pastors that was his whole motive that every single one of us could get to a point to a level of maturity where we could be pastors and the first sheep or lamb that we were going to have in our flock to be Shepherds of was ourselves think about that for a little bit you were supposed to be the shepherd of your own self and then after you had done a good enough job this the next person that you were supposed to shepher was your wife and then together we were supposed to Shepherd our family that's it I I was I was out of town last week and got a chance to talk to some brothers and I finally understood what my problem was I was trying to fix the church I'm talking about Phoenix Tabernacle phoen I was trying to fix the associate pastor I was even trying to fix the pastor and the Lord finally revealed to me that the only person I need to fix is me remember this is a supplement and it's dedicated to the men of this church the only person that we need to fix is ourselves not our wife not our children not brother last year I quoted my Uncle Paul he used to say we need to update our files you come to church you see a brother that had backslid had gone out and then all of a sudden you see him in church and you're like what's he doing here I saw him do this this and I heard him say this this and that he said you don't know that perhaps that brother is already full of the Holy Ghost he's already asked for forgiveness God has forgiven him and he's been delivered set free but you got an old file on them this Uncle Paul used to say this this is what Uncle Paul used to tell us he said it's time to update your fil so I got listen I think it would be better if we burnt our files here here's what I saw I saw me with a bunch of filing cabinets and I had a file on every single one of you I'm going to church I'm I'm going to be delivered hallelujah hallelujah that's why there is no deliverance and then I thought Lord is it just me and then I turned around looked at you and every single one of you got filing cabinets on your back amen let's not update our files let's burn them brother I burnt your file I have nothing on you yeah I got nothing on you brother Ben I burnt your file I don't remember nothing because when God forgave you he absolutely forgot he forgot completely so when you go next time and you ask the Lord for forgiveness and you truly accept your forgiveness do God a favor don't go back and ask him for forgiveness for the same thing stop it because if you ask him for forgiveness for the same thing over and over again he's going to tell you what he told me what are you talking about that's what he told me what are you talking I have no idea what you're talking about so John chapter 3 verse 17 says for God didn't send Jesus Christ to the world to condemn it but that through him they might be saved wait a minute you didn't send Jesus Christ your son to condemn it then why are we condemning one another so how many are willing to burn your your file on me thank you awesome who said that they said what file that's the mind of Christ amen that's the mind of Christ what F let's go to um brother Eli in the back let's go to slide 41 I got three messages today and I guess we're going to start right here slide 41 questions and answers is that on there no it's not conduct Doctrine they ask brother brandham this question I'll wait slide 41 you all let me know when it's there okay remember this is a message for the men there is it awesome this is a message for the men God our pastor wanted to make you pastors for us to learn be patient and and and with ourselves I'm sorry lead guide us guide us gu us this is the question that they asked brother brandham said brother brandham BR I lived many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother brandom I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored whole again please help me brother brandom I have a devil in me help me will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again brother brandom says now now there is a question I never noticed it when I read it a while ago there is a question now if that person is present let me read it to you I have lived many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother brandham I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored whole again the next slide this is Brother bram's answer yes yes you can be restored whole again you have not sinned my friend so far in God but what you could be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you would never want to be restored amen how many have sinned here how many have thought that you cannot be restored again but deep in your heart you want to be restored but the Devil comes and he tells you you're too far gone you've tried one too many times as long as there's something there're dealing in your heart you're still in line of restoration guilty of the least is guilty of the whole this is Brother Brown now saying brother BR says I have sinned many times every day one of us do things that we don't want to do it's in our heart you don't want to be that way or you wouldn't ask this question the question itself is proof that God is still dealing with [Applause] you you're probably got nervous probably Satan telling you that you can't be restored he's lying he certainly is because look if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to that call if there is a hunger for something it's that something's got to be somewhere or you would have no hunger for it now as long as you're wanting and hungering to get back to God there's a God somewhere calling to you or you wouldn't hungry there's a Creator now there's a place that you can cross where you can't get back oh we'll just stop right there there is a place where you can cross where you won't be able to come back brother Bram says that there's a line of Mercy that you cross one of these days he's going to call you for the last time and if you don't listen you will have crossed that line of Mercy if you got your notebooks write it down it's Hebrews chapter 6 verse4 for it is impossible shall we go there let's let's just do that amen Hebrews chapter 6 ver4 it's not on the screen when you have it say Amen so I know you got for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift amen and were made partakers tasters of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall Fall Away it will be impossible go ahead sorry no no just say what I say okay if they shall fall away it will be impossible to renew them again unto repentance do you know that that's what it says that's what it says starting from verse four for it is impossible verse six if they shall fall away to renew them again un repentance seeing They Crucified themselves as Son of God a fresh and put him to an open shame they tasted brother they tasted of the word of God amen but didn't obey now brother bam says backsliding is not lost how many backslid how many backslid Christians do we have here listen every one of your hands should be up but I want to tell you something brother brandham says that just because you backslide doesn't mean you're lost I want somebody to tell me where backsliding is lost he says and prove it to prove it to the Bible backslider is not lost he's just out of Fellowship wow wow come back to the fellowship fellowship with the word Israel backslid but they never lost their C they lost their praises and joy David lost the joy of his salvation when he took be Sheba uriah's wife but he never lost his salvation he never said restor to me my salvation he said restor to me the joy of my salvation amen you know what this tells me that you might have been saved at one time you might have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and you got baptized in Christian baptis and you backslid but that doesn't mean you're lost now the devil will want to tell you you're lost that you're not even Worthy but you're not lost you're just out of Fellowship come back to the fellowship next slide then how about a big eagle he says he's a Heavenly bird he lives way in Above the Clouds that's where he goes over morning ways so high nothing can follow him no other bird can follow him he' disintegrate in the air if he tried to follow him this Eagle he's a special made bird I want you to say this with me I am a special made bird I am a special made bird and then somebody had caught him in a man-made trap they caught this big eagle and put him in this cage and this poor old fellow I looked at him and then my heart just burns he looked at that side like that he didn't know how to get out of that cage he'd get across there and he and he'd want to take off and he' start trying to flop his wings and here he go and he was banging his head up against the bars and he beat the feathers out of his wings he beat the feathers out of his [Applause] head till he was bleeding he hit that bar so hard and knock Plum back on his back and he'd lay there and roll them weary looking eyes looking up towards heav that's where I belong that's my home that's where I was born for but looking between me is this cage the only thing I know is I got to put my mind to it and here I go again bang and there he go right back on his back again oh it made me feel so bad that poor Big Bird there beating on his feathers I thought that's the most horrible sight I've ever seen no I take it back the most horrible sight I've ever seen is a man born to be a Son of God and then pinned up in sin and he looks up there and sees a God that he really wants to serve but he just can't do it they won't let him do it they've got him pinned up that's a horrible thing yes yes sister brother sister Eagle agila brother Eagle agila yes see ever who wrote this question if you have fallen down here that don't mean you're lost you're just an eagle's gotten to a pen that's all you're caged up down here in sin again you don't want to be there and that's the reason you're looking up there you are yes oh brother Bram I once lived up there is there a way back here yes reminds me one day I was walking around behind the farm and somebody had tied an Old Crow to keep him out of the Corn and that poor old fellow was just about starved to death I couldn't be that mean to do that while they tied the old crow by the foot and the old F the old fellow had nothing had eat everything that was around him and he couldn't get nothing else the farmer just left him and he was so poor he couldn't even get up and the other brothers in church would fly over him and say come on brother Johnny come on Sister Jenny

don't stay there in the pit of the devil 49 brother brandham reads the question now will you lay hands upon me and free me from that I love this part sister dear sister dear or brother dear I'd lay hands on you but that wouldn't free you that's the remember mind Warfare I'd lay hands on you but that wouldn't this is the prophet of God that's right if he were lay his hands upon you that wouldn't free you what will free you is that you understand that you're already been set free God you're already untied you don't have to worry about being you're already free Jesus made you free be not again entangled in the Yoke of bondage you are free as you can be how free do you want to be amen you want to be half free or maybe a little free or you don't or you don't want to be free or do you want to be free [Applause] it's up to you right it's your choice what thought you're going to choose it's your choice you send yourself to Hell by the choices that you make and and you send yourself to heaven with the choices that you make your choice is God's Gift To You Right the world that you live in today has been created by your choices that's right you can create Heaven on Earth with the choices that you make he says now laying my hands on you is just a tradition we might do that why I could do that but that still wouldn't set you free until you accept what he's done for you until you accept AC what he's done for you brother Mano it's it's one thing to accept right but it's another thing to receive right amen well you just lay your hands by faith upon him and say Lord I believe it and up will come he says you lay your hands on him that's what he's saying Put Your Hands of Faith on God and say I believe and here I come glory amen that's right confess your sins he that hides his sins will not Prosper covers his sins but he that will confess his sins that's where you get freedom and justification when you're willing to say I've sinned I'm wrong that's what you said here I have fallen and I sinned and I'm dead wrong is there a chance for me to be whole again absolutely the minute that you desired it that shows that God drops the lifeline right there down on you to pick you up again how many have a desire to be restored again how many have a desire to be restored again God just dropped the lifeline he's dropping the lifeline right now to restore you and pick you up [Music] again so just rise up on his Lifeline of faith move right on up into the rest of the the Eagles like that and go flopping your wings go to slide 24 this is what we call the domino effect are you ready it's it's easy getting extraordinary results is all about creating a domino effect in your life every great change starts like a falling Domino it's still not there let let me tell you this the first place that Satan will attack us is where that's the first Domino if Satan can manage to knock over the first one all the other dominoes will fall that's why brother Bram said that the first place he'll attack you is in your mind amen see the last Domino Falls in Hell on Earth in drug addiction in alcoholism in divorce yes in sin on Earth he wants to destroy you his last Domino is absolute destruction but he's not going to go after the last Domino he's not going to try to go after every single Domino all he's got to do is knock over the first one just knock over that first Dom but Satan is just an imitator he he looked at what God was doing oh that's how you do it thank [Applause] you out of the M of babes go to the next slide oh my goodness you got no no no slide 25 I gave him a hard time poor Eli he's just doing the best he can back there cuz there's like two messages in one and I didn't know where I was going to start slide 25 me I know you'll get it you'll get it this is what they say topping dominoes is pretty straightforward you line the up and you tip over the first one in the real world it's a little bit more complicated we're talking about life dominoes of Life The Challenge is that life does not line everything up for us and say Here's what you should do this is where you need to start highly successful people know this so every day they line up their priorities a new they find the lead Domino and work away at it until it falls because extraordinary success is sequential not simultaneous my last Domino is to be sealed with the Seal of God but there's a lot of dominoes in front of that one if I can manage to knock over the first [Music] one I can walk away and know it's going to fall where is your first Domino why why why do we not have the success spiritual success that we should have you can apply this principle for business for your marriage life for your children's and for your spiritual life amen go to slide 28 remember this is a supplement hopefully we'll come back and we'll preach on mind Warfare but I'm opening my mind to you I want you to see the war in action not just talk about it but see how it works 28 okay let's try 29 you know I'm getting nervous because our time's almost up oh here here we go this is a nice illustration what's your first Domino yeah see remember all you got to do is push push over that first one Lauren Lauren you just need to push that first one but you got to find it and I'm going to show you my first Domino go to the next slide you see this this is a row of dominoes that they set up you would never think that the first Domino which is so tiny would knock over that big one that's the Seal of the Holy Ghost right there that that big Domino for me for 48 years I've been pushing on that one until I understood that all I needed to do was knock over that first one in September of 2015 I came up here to the platform I asked brother Johnny for 10 minutes I said I want to I want to talk to the church would you give me permission he said yes and as you know I had left the ministry am I resigned completely from every office in this church but you know there's something about a Son of God he's got a chain on your ankle and he'll only let you go so far that's right that's why do you think you're here so my first Domino I made a decision we're on slide 30 I made a decision to ask God for forgiveness that was my first Domino just and I didn't have to do anything else I'm here today by the grace of God so September 2015 the second Domino was this slide 30 son please I came up and I said this good morning God bless you brothers and sisters fathers and mothers local Ministry and governing body after going through four years of spiritual and physical depression misunderstandings spiritual and moral sins against God my family my wife my children and against myself I want to confess that I have sinned against everyone and everything that I hold dear and holy to me I have sinned against my heavenly father and have brought reproach upon his word and against my testimony I am ashamed of my public behavior and actions and I take full responsibility for my actions I have repented of all my sins and have asked my wife and children for forgiveness acknowledging that I failed them as a husband and father I feel a deep and contrite need to ask you my spiritual family for forgiveness I have made a decision I've made a choice to serve the Lord Jesus Christ father with all my heart and soul as long as I live I left him when I left the word and I have found him exactly where I left him when I left his word I'm tired of running I will have no peace in my heart until I know that youve forgiven me for running in the face of adversity through the struggles of the last four years I now understood the words of my father in The Gospel of St Mark for whosoever will save his life shall lose it stop trying to save your life you're going to lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it I make no claims and have no rights other than on God's grace and mercy forgiveness and righteousness I read in 1 John 1 ver9 that if I confess my sins he is faithful and just to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me from all unrighteousness I stand before you as a repented sinner the words of the prodigal son I'm not even worthy to be called your son but I have realized that only one step from the finish line refuse am we're one step away we're one step away God I know the ship has been battered I know that the SS are torn but we're one step away you going to give off now take courage yes take courage we're going to make it we're going to make it I pray that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me and not judge me I pray that I pray that you'll pray for me and not condemn me I pray that you will love me and not I I plead for your prayers as I begin to finish my journey if you want to come to the piano I just want to be at peace with my conscience and since I ask for forgiveness my conscience became my best friend we're buddies now seriously my conscience me and my conscience we're best buds whereas before we were our worst enemies he was accusing me day and night but now me and my conscience we're best friends thank you I'm at peace I knocked over the first Domino and the dominoes are continuing to fall I didn't have to do anything I realized that I was already free you're already free you know there was a man took his son to the circus one day and uh they were feeding the elephants and the Elephant had a little tiny rope tied to his back foot and they had just a little skinny Branch just hammered into the ground and this huge elephant they had laid up some hay in front of him and and he had finished eating all the hay that he could reach with his trunk but there was some Eternal hay over here there was there was some Heavenly [Music] Mana but his trunk couldn't reach it could he had this little tiny string this rope tied around his foot and every time he felt that little tug he quit so the man saw this and he went to the trainer and he said why is this doesn't the elepant know how powerful he [Music] is he said oh no no he said what you don't know is when we caught them in the wild we tied a big heavy chain around a big heavy post and that poor little elephant struggled and struggled and struggled and he'd go to the bar and he would struggle and he would struggle and he would struggle and struggle some more he said until his foot was bleeding and it hurt so much to struggle that he finally accepted in his mind that he would never be free and he quit struggling he said and when they quit struggling we take the chain off and we put a little tiny rope and he says and as soon as they feel the slightest resistance they give [Music] up he said here's what it is he said the physical chain became a mental chain mind Warfare it's no longer physical [Music] change you're already free you're already [Music] free we're already free but what's holding us back it's the mental change do yourself a favor knock over the first [Music] Domino and say father by faith I'm going to put my hands on you and I'm going to accept my Liberty I accept my Liberty this morning I promise to follow you and only you all the days of my life father I promise I give you my word that I will fight the battle of the mind and only accept your mind in my mind in the name of Jesus Christ would you stand bow your [Music] heads you don't need nobody lay hands on you you know why you're afraid to commit because
