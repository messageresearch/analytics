[11:35] Lord it's it's an astonish and it's
[11:39] astonishment to read the
[11:42] scripture if you once you start reading
[11:45] this
[11:47] Bible now I you kind of have to watch
[11:50] what you
[11:52] say because sometimes as people hear
[11:56] you you say when when you read this
[11:58] Bible
[12:01] and it's they're they're thinking about
[12:02] this specific
[12:05] Bible but you have your own
[12:08] Bible and you know that's what I'm
[12:10] talking
[12:11] about and you are a Bible and you're an
[12:16] epistle and God is reading
[12:19] you and God knows all about
[12:23] you for a little bit of a moment I was
[12:27] asked by my grandson
[12:31] why
[12:32] that so I told him I got to take you
[12:36] back before anything happened there in
[12:38] the Garden of
[12:41] Eden before you and
[12:47] I now if this sounds
[12:51] rare that's okay okay I at least I'll
[12:54] get your
[12:56] attention before you or I
[13:01] any of
[13:02] you before even Jesus was here on
[13:09] Earth okay did you did you hear what I
[13:12] just
[13:15] said he knew
[13:20] you and He sent Jesus for one
[13:27] purpose I know that Jesus is
[13:29] multifaceted I know that God is
[13:31] multifaceted I know that but for right
[13:33] now I'm saying that God came for one
[13:41] purpose that came to
[13:43] Die For The
[13:45] Sinner he came to die for you and
[13:49] I he came to die for the
[13:53] bride he came to die for the foolish
[13:57] virgin he came to die for for each and
[14:00] every one of
[14:02] us whether you're a
[14:04] Believer whether you're an
[14:06] unbeliever a make believer whatever kind
[14:09] of believer you
[14:11] are nevertheless God being a merciful
[14:18] judge he did the right thing and he sent
[14:22] his
[14:23] advocate he sent his
[14:25] attorney he sent his only begotten son
[14:28] Jesus Christ
[14:35] brother Bram said that before any of you
[14:39] came even before
[14:41] Jesus but he when he came he
[14:44] died he came back so he and he
[14:48] [Applause]
[14:49] resurrected to give us the Holy
[14:52] Ghost to bring us
[14:56] back wow amen and then Jeremiah the
[15:00] prophet the
[15:03] prophet I believe that the
[15:08] Harvest I know I'm not I'm not going to
[15:10] be able to
[15:13] finish the Harvest is
[15:16] passed I'm sorry it's not
[15:20] finished I read that wrong the Harvest
[15:23] is
[15:23] [Music]
[15:25] passed the summer has
[15:27] ended and we're not
[15:30] saved I believe that the Bride of Jesus
[15:34] Christ presently looking at
[15:38] herself she's looking and she's saying
[15:41] where have I gone
[15:43] wrong I need to wake
[15:46] up I need to start
[15:50] gleaning I need to this bit
[15:55] here this little bit here and find what
[15:59] he said over
[16:00] here and what he said over here I got to
[16:03] make
[16:04] sure because the lovely Ruth
[16:10] that she
[16:12] gleaned The Book of Ruth is in the eth
[16:17] book yes
[16:20] see okay okay sorry about
[16:26] that okay how many of you read your
[16:28] Bible
[16:30] okay you know I I I I love the
[16:34] Bible I sometimes have a hard time
[16:37] understanding what I
[16:41] read but so I go to my
[16:44] dictionary and then I start finding
[16:48] out uh what what the words
[16:53] mean you know Jeremiah
[16:56] himself he he asked the question
[16:59] and there is an answer you know Jeremiah
[17:03] said is there no Bal in
[17:06] Gilead you know where bomb comes
[17:09] from I check check the the
[17:13] dictionaries and bomb is actually is a
[17:17] res that
[17:19] derived from the evergreen
[17:23] tree did you hear what I just said it
[17:25] comes from the evergreen
[17:27] tree
[17:29] it doesn't come from a
[17:31] flower doesn't come from the lily of the
[17:34] valley doesn't come from a rose it comes
[17:37] from the evergreen
[17:39] tree there's only one evergreen tree
[17:42] that I know
[17:44] of that is Jesus
[17:46] Christ it's mentioned there back in
[17:48] Genesis three times and in the Book of
[17:51] Revelation it's mentioned three
[17:55] [Music]
[17:57] times it's the Tree of
[18:01] Life bom is derived from that tree of
[18:04] life Jesus
[18:06] Christ Jesus Christ is our
[18:09] medicine this is our
[18:12] medicine the hardest thing for us is to
[18:15] actually apply
[18:20] it amen how many of you were with me so
[18:22] far very simple is
[18:24] it okay you know I was wondering this is
[18:29] really something you
[18:31] know so I I looked and it says what in
[18:34] order to to get a a health to get
[18:39] healthy and and and most of the doctors
[18:41] I think they'll agree with
[18:44] me and agree with the
[18:46] Bible you need a remedy sometimes to to
[18:50] to help
[18:52] you so we go back to our dictionary we
[18:55] find out and we find that that remedy
[18:59] you take the
[19:00] word the word
[19:03] remedy is a
[19:05] noun a noun is a
[19:09] person it's a person place or
[19:14] thing okay something that cures or
[19:17] relieves a disease or bodily
[19:24] order a healing
[19:27] medicine now I'm going to not read the
[19:31] rest of the
[19:34] definitions but I'm just going to uh
[19:36] stick with this right
[19:38] here a healing
[19:41] medicine is a remedy how many of you
[19:44] agree with that okay it could be a pill
[19:48] it could be an injection it could be a
[19:51] bomb it could be anything like that but
[19:54] it's a a
[19:55] remedy now this remedy it's no good at
[20:00] all unless you apply
[20:03] it you have to apply it now my son if I
[20:08] am sick if I'm very sick and and I don't
[20:12] know what to do the doctor says you know
[20:15] Alex you got to take this
[20:17] medicine and you're G to be well and and
[20:20] if he takes the medicine for
[20:22] me am I going to get well no absolutely
[20:26] no because the medicine was made for me
[20:30] this medicine this Bible is meant for
[20:32] you and
[20:34] me it'll save
[20:36] you it'll heal
[20:39] you
[20:41] amen
[20:44] wow but you have to apply
[20:49] it okay now this other word it's going
[20:52] to get kind of I'll use the word
[20:57] dicey
[21:01] a remedy is a healing
[21:06] medicine it's an
[21:08] application or
[21:14] treatment you notice what I do I I'm
[21:18] sorry but I got kind of used to this in
[21:19] the
[21:20] prison sorry about that guys okay
[21:27] forgive now I'm going to treat this sick
[21:30] person here he just came off the
[21:33] street okay he just came off the street
[21:36] ad he's
[21:39] lost and but but he this day
[21:42] he Bo he looks he looks like he could
[21:44] passor a maybe a movie star or hman or
[21:47] something like
[21:50] that and if I go to him and I
[21:54] go good to have you here in church
[21:57] today
[22:01] okay so I just gave him a
[22:03] treatment I treated
[22:05] him how many understood
[22:10] that
[22:12] okay another
[22:15] scenario here he is poor drug addict you
[22:18] know he's all strung
[22:21] out I'm sorry guys but look I'm not
[22:24] playing
[22:25] games okay I'm not playing games this

[22:30] brothers
[22:34] here brother Alex is all over the
[22:38] place except where there's
[22:42] money but anyway he's all over the place
[22:45] he sees
[22:48] everything he's strung
[22:50] out he was strung out he was strung
[22:53] out and I'm sure one of the sisters saw
[22:55] her and I'm not going to go
[22:57] into
[22:58] but instead of be telling hey man what's
[23:00] wrong with
[23:02] you so I just tell him let's see if can
[23:06] let's see if you can they can find you a
[23:09] place kind of right now but let's see if
[23:11] they can find you a
[23:14] place so what I did I gave him baling
[23:19] Gilead I I gave him a
[23:23] treatment okay you and I have to
[23:27] give
[23:30] a
[23:31] treatment but before you can give
[23:33] somebody a
[23:35] treatment you have to give yourself
[23:37] first a
[23:40] treatment you have to feed
[23:43] yourself with
[23:45] food to be able to have strength to get
[23:48] up and fight them maggots out
[23:51] there fight those bad people out
[23:54] there fight the devil to fight the
[23:57] whatever
[23:59] but you have to feed yourself first of
[24:03] nourishment you have to eat
[24:05] something and then after you do that you
[24:07] have to eat this kind of
[24:10] medicine and then you can
[24:14] apply the
[24:16] treatment the
[24:17] remedy and then you can
[24:21] treat
[24:22] now guess where you have to
[24:27] start
[24:29] anybody here care care to
[24:31] uh I'm start with the
[24:34] brother where would we start
[24:39] brother it's not a trick question
[24:48] no okay I'll give you the
[24:51] answer I'm I'm just trying to get you to
[24:55] understand the treatment when you become
[24:57] a doctor

[25:07] apply the right
[25:09] medicine you're a doctor maybe not a
[25:12] doctor of
[25:14] medicine but for a
[25:17] doctor here we go the first time when
[25:21] your eyes become
[25:23] open when you eat the right
[25:27] medicine when you are born
[25:29] again when you have a new
[25:33] understanding when the holy spirit opens
[25:36] your
[25:37] understanding that you go and you say I
[25:40] did not know
[25:41] that you made my
[25:45] family I have to start with my family oh
[25:47] I I you I
[25:51] answer but before you go with your
[25:57] family
