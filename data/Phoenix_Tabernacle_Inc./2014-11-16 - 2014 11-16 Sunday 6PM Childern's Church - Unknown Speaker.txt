feel like singing [Music] oh amen God bless you tonight wasn't that beautiful you know we're really privileged to be able to hear the gifts being displayed and be able to experience that firsthand um I thank the Lord every time I'm sitting up here and listening to anything that touches my heart like that did well tonight we have a very special exert for you tonight in the second book of Supernatural the life of William Brandon which we just started with the last exert and the the chapters un numbered sequentially this particular chapter has a title which I will not give it this time only because I want this to be [Music] received in such a manner that it would should the Lord permit it would touch your heart I think it speaks for itself pardon the phrase but tonight I ask you to put your spiritual seat belts on as we are so honored and privileged to go into another part of her life of our Prophet William Aaron brandham chapter 13 1933 it was June 11th 1933 by 2:00 in the afternoon a thousand people gathered on the banks of the Ohio river at the end of Spring Street to watch these baptisms the Earth baked under cloudless Sky not even the slightest Breeze moved to cool the crowd as they sang on Jordan's stormy Banks I stand and cast a Wishful eye toward canaan's fair and Happy Land where my possessions lie I am Bound for the promised land when Billy reached the shoreline he saw a young woman he knew named Margie sitting in a rowboat close to the spot where the baptisms needed to be Margie was scantly dressed in a bathing suit feeling that Margie's bathing suit was indecent and inappropriate Billy asked her politely if she would leave she answered indignantly I don't have to leave that's right Margie you don't have to but if I were you I'd have enough respect for the gospel to leave where I'm baptizing don't talk to me about respecting the gospel I'm a Sunday school teacher I don't believe in baptizing and I don't have to leave Margie snickered as Billy turned away Billy waited into the river along with the first candidate for baptism the two stood waste Deep in water while the current moved sluggishly around them the surface of the river was so smooth it looked like molten glass Under The Naked Sun heat waves blurred the trees on the opposite Shore Bill asked do you believe you have met Jesus Christ at this revival the man answered yes have you repented of your sins yes do you believe Jesus Christ has forgiven you and that now you are saved from your sins yes then let us pray together they bowed their heads Bill prayed Heavenly Father we are here because you have ordained us to go into all nations making disciples out of them baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost amen then bu raised his head turned to the candidate and said upon the confession of your sin I baptize you my beloved brother in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the candidate held his nose as Bill dipped him back into the turbid waters while the first baptized person waited toward Shore and the second candidate waited out Bill exhorted a crowd why did Jesus tell us to be baptized well for one thing it is symbolic of death death to the world World symbolically the old man is going into the grave so that the new man can come forth and live a new life in Jesus Christ but remember baptism baptism does not change you it's only the outward sign of an inward work the believer is witnessing to the world that Jesus Christ has already changed him inside one by one bill baptized the candidates in similar fashion the 17th person to wait into the river was Edward koven a boy not too much younger than Bill himself as the two stood waste deep in the current bill asked Edward do you believe you were regenerated at the Revival meetings yes the boy answered Bill raised his voice to reach the crowd on the shore everyone bow your heads when they complied Bill closed his own eyes and bowed his head and prayed aloud heavenly father just when he heard a voice say look up he opened his eyes and looked at Edward who was waiting patiently with his head bowed and his eyes closed the words had not come from him Bill did not know where they came from puzzled he again bowed his head closed his eyes and continued his prayer heavenly father as I baptize this boy with water you baptize him with the Holy Spirit again he heard a voice say look up opening his eyes he looked around Edward opened his eyes too curious of the delay well brother Bill did you hear that hear what for the third time Bill Heard a Voice say look up this time he looked into the sky and gasped dropping out of the heavens came a fireball from the distance it resembled a star oscillating between yellowish green and Amber as it fell closer it looked like a Milling circle of fire roaring spinning throwing off Sparks and Flames Bill held his breath in Terror as the star came right at him but it stopped short and hung directly overhead the waters around Bill churned sending up a fine Mist that refracted a little Rainbow over the star suddenly Bill heard a voice speaking to him it was not the melodious Bas voice that so often spoke to him in Visions this voice was tenor familiar it said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ so are you sent with a message to forerun his second coming on the River Bank the people still had their heads bowed in prayer but Margie was watching from her rowboat when she saw the light she screamed hysterically before She fainted pitching forward into the bow of the boat that scream jerked up heads in seconds pandemonium broke loose as the crowd looked up to see a swirling ball of fire hanging above Billy bram's head when women screamed men grabbed one another some panicked and ran a few fainted most just trembled not everyone who saw the star heard the voice but one particular 14-year-old girl heard it she had kept her eyes closed and her head bowed even during the crowd's frenzy because her pastor had told her to Bow her head and she tried to always do what her Pastor said this girl did hear the voice heard every word distinctly and because she heard something powerful sank deep into her soul as though an anchor had buried itself in the accumulated silt of her experience her name was ma Bry and she was destined to play an important role in Bill's future the ball of fire hung above Bill's head for less than a minute then it shot back into the heavens from where it came the choppy water smooth again under a windless Blue Sky Billy spoke to the the crowd until they all calmed down then he continued baptizing until he finished immersing all 200 candidates in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as he sosed to the shore a group of Jeffersonville businessmen surrounded him and asked anxiously what did that light mean Bill answered honestly I don't know I am a believer it might have been a sign for the unbeliever I can't tell you the next morning the local newspaper ran an article about this incident caption quote unquote mysterious star appears over Minister while baptizing for everyone else it was just another curious bit of news to talk about on the day the paper came out but to William brandham it was much more he had stood beneath that pulsing amber light and squinted from its brightness he had seen the waters turn choppy around him he had heard clearly that voice declared as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Jesus Christ so are you sent with a message to forun his second coming no this was not something to be dismissed lightly and because it seemed so outlandish and difficult to understand Bill considered it a supernatural sign that demanded an explanation and if this sign did come from God then he believed the explanation of it would have to come out of the pages of God's word with fervor Bill read his Bible searching for Clues he kept a notebook and pencil nearby so he could jot down whichever scriptures seemed to apply to his surprise he discovered many God bless you amen how tremendous to be able to hear that testimony of our Prophet you know we're such privileged people to be living in this last Church age and to be to have a prophet like we [Music] have we're just blessed we want to welcome you this evening if you could please stand stand again stret out a little bit you

God you know we live in in in in in in in in a time uh where where uh there's a lot of [Music] stress does everybody do you guys know what stress is when we you know when we think a lot and we worry sometimes we don't even think about things but we're still worried because in the back of our minds there's things that are processing all the time and and and and and and you know something that's very common today is to see young people that have gray hair or they start getting gray hair it's just too stressful nowadays you know we have to worry about this about that about school about how we're going to look about how you know what we're going to eat about that boy that picks some in school or this how many of you worry a little bit amen we all have stress amen well tonight we're going to talk about the number one stress reliever of all time if you if you could take everything that bothers you that stresses you out and just give it to somebody and say here can you take this from me and can you just get rid of it can you fix it would you do it raise your hand if you would well do you know that we have somebody that's very very very special that's better than a superhero that died for us and that took the victory for us and we can give him all of these things now the children are pretty smart right now who can tell me who that is who is it me that's right Jesus right were you going to say Jesus too I saw you that's right it is Jesus so tonight we're going to talk a little bit about trusting in God putting our trust in God trusting Jesus for our lives you know all through the Bible Jesus tells us how to be very very successful through our lives he gives us all of the secrets all of the superpowers in his word did you know that that's right that's why he left it for us you know when Jesus when the devil and I think the devil was back there somewhere roaming around back there Jesus he was back there roaming around and when the devil came to Jesus and he tried to tempt Jesus yeah he tried to tempt Jesus Jesus used the word against him and eventually he told them get behind me Satan amen amen So today we're going to talk talk a little bit so so how many of you have ever been scared right I was when I was a little guy and even as an adult I get scared right you know sometimes we say man I'm a big tough guy you know I can do anything and then maybe we get really really sick and then we're oh oh Jesus I'm not that can you help me can you make me better Lord amen right thank you Jesus and then he heals you and you say thank you Jesus so the scripture tells us there in Psalms 56 so Psalms is an awesome book right it has all these awesome little sayings amen amen and I always like to go there and read because it it gives me strength right so Psalms 56 all right let's read can you guys read with me everybody together okay I'm going to read first and then you read what time I am afraid what time I am afraid I will trust in thee I will trust in thee in God I will praise His word in God I will praise His word in God I have put my trust in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me wow those are like do you feel stronger now I know I do so there's nothing I just took all the fears that I had you know those bad dreams the the bullies at [Music] school or or or or things that are difficult in my life that I don't understand and I said I will put all my trust and I will not fear for God is on my side and I am not afraid amen amen all right so remember this is this is like you know like if you were a superhero cuz you guys are better let me tell you a secret you guys are better than [Music] superheroes and you're like oh brother Mike you're just trying to be funny right really you are Sons and Daughters of the Living God God man what do you think Jesus woo that's pretty powerful amen all right so let's let's so what I was saying it's like having this this this this this super belt and and and fear comes upon you and you say wait a minute fear I will not fear in you because when I have fear when you have fear give it to God when you don't understand something give it to God amen amen so maybe at school somebody need one of your friends at school that maybe doesn't come to church or for or or for or for the brothers and sisters that are like my age you see somebody at work or somebody you know and they're scared maybe they're sick you tell them don't fear I'll pray with you and God will make it better amen amen because remember you're better than a superhero and a good superhero helps people right and each and every one of you are the light of the world reflecting Jesus all right so let's go to our next one very simple stuff but very powerful okay we're going to ask one of these young men to come up here and read it for us come on up everybody let's see for thou art My Hope oh Lord God Thou Art my trust from my youth the word of God tells us we can trust him when we are young and old can we ask Jesus a question amen amen Jesus can I trust you when I'm young like the kids here absolutely what about when I'm older like brother Mike of course brother Mike thank you Jesus Jesus you guys want to ask him a question does anybody want to ask Jesus a question no no anybody okay we'll we we we'll save the questions for later Jesus thank you so he is our hope man you ever have hope about something inside your heart and you say man I hope that happens oh man I hope my mom and dad do that oh I hope something comes oh something good and I hope that that situation at school you know that boy that's always hitting me in the arm or those kids that are always making fun of me oh I have hope but we want to put our hope in Jesus and how do we put our hope in him by putting all of of those things that we hope for and saying Jesus we can take him by the hand just like that and say Lord I put all of these things into your hands oh and I I'm just hoping and trusting for the best Lord that's right praise the Lord and he he he will come if you pray to him if you get on your knees in your room in a in a private place and you say Lord Lord he comes down as a peaceful spirit and then you can feel him and then you can ask him and then you're just like I can rest there's nothing he can't do thank you Jesus so let's see what else he has for us so since our youth are you are you young how many young people do I have in here tonight amen see everybody is amen Lord all right next one Judah you want to help us read that come on up commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass so if we trust and believe in him don't trust and believe in brother Mike but if you trust and believe in the Lord and if it's something that's good for you to make you a strong Christian or something that you need and you give it to him he will bring it to pass so we have to exercise our faith we have to exercise how we believe in Jesus and ask him and and become stronger and stronger until man we're his power all of his power is fulfilled in US and what did he tell us that we could do all things would we be able to do the same works that you did Jesus yes amen The Works that I do shall you do also more and so what kind of works did Jesus do anybody can anybody tell me come on up come on up he died on the cross that's right he died on the cross and and he not only died on the cross but he also resurrected on the third day and he brought what did he bring for us anybody salvation salvation Salvation how many of you have ever been sick too what does he bring bring good health or bad Health good health does he bring blessings or no blessings good good blessings thank you all right you can be seated amen let's give Jesus an Applause you know it seems it seems very simple right it seems like a children story right but that is how simple our God is if we seek him with a pure heart and we believe in him there is nothing he cannot bring to pass there is no sickness there is no devil there is nothing that can stand before and as young children believe it and become strong in your belief because as you get as you get older in your age life becomes more difficult see the more we know the more we understand the more we need Jesus we need him to help explain all of the difficult things in our life through his word and he gives us those keys the the the the the power of Prayer amen amen amen I see I see sister ampo sitting over there with sister Bonnie and I can't help but think of brother oo what an amazing Warrior of God he he is yes he is because he is not amongst us anymore but he is alive and better than ever and through his faith in God he did a lot of Miracles praying for people giving people medicine in the form of tapes books so we're thankful for our Warriors aren't we Jesus like brother o right oh yes praise the Lord so let's see let's go to the next one okay here we go let's see is that the last one yeah that's Psalm 71 do I get a volunteer that wants to read Psalm 71 for us come on up here bu come on up here what's your name uh Ezra praise the Lord know is Ezra say hi Jesus hi Jesus hug all right all right so let's read it okay oh Lord my God is the I but my save me from all them that rescued my and Deliver Me am amen praise the Lord wasn't that special Jesus amen let me tell you this this scripture here is something that I try to just recite every morning when I go into the corporate world to go to work I put my trust in him in all things and I say Jesus can you please protect me from those that want to harm me at work from those that want to say wrong things about me or that want to trick me so that they can make me look bad but I also tell them help me be honest Lord Jesus and have integrity Lord Jesus and let me treat people like a Christian Lord Jesus see and you can do that if you wake up in the morning before you go to school and you know that you have bad days at school because school you know in school there's all sorts of different people right we're not going to say anything bad about them but there's different people if we say oh Lord my God as my mommy and daddy are taking me to work in you I put my trust save me from all of those that want to persecute me and Deliver Me amen amen he'll do it he will do it amen amen do you believe that all right let's give him an Applause then than so amazing just amazing amazing little scriptures in Jesus in the word Jesus brought us that can help us in our everyday life so today we talked about what scripture in Sunday school can somebody help me those that were in my class that's right John 14 1-6 correct and what did the scripture tell us can somebody else tell me okay you want right I'm the way the truth the life the door that's right that's right amen that's part of what he told us but he tells us he says let your heart not be troubled uh uh 141 St John that's right just look it up it's right here M here right here no let your heart not be troubled so Jesus he doesn't want us to worry he doesn't want our heart to be troubled he wants us to put all of our trust in him and he wants to live in our heart that's right and he wants to give us peace Joy salvation happiness health blessings oh thank you Jesus amen so why don't why doesn't my uh the children stand really quick and repeat after me okay he says let your heart not be troubled uh believe in God believe in God believe also in me and listen listen to the promises what he tells us where he goes and what's there he says in my father's house are many mansions let's repeat it again okay in my father's house in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you now point to yourself and prepare a place for you he went to prepare a place for [Music] you in a house where there's many mansions it says and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again will and receive you unto myself reive that where I am am there ye may also be there ye may and whether I go ye know and the way you know than you may be seated so Jesus Is Telling Jesus was telling his disciples where he was going and what he was going to go do because he was going to be leaving the scene and they kept asking him Jesus can I go where are you going H how do how are we supposed to know where's the father they just kept asking him all these questions and he finally told them but those words are for all of us so when we ask where's Jesus what is the scripture tells us that he went to prepare a place for us do you trust him so if you trust him enough if you trust him enough to go and prepare a place for you why can't we trust him enough to give him all of our worries all of our sickness all of our needs everything right it's easy to say man what a you know as children it's easy to put your head down nobody loves me my life is a mess I need help I never get help but it's much more easier to say Jesus I trust you Jesus help me Jesus I give everything to you Jesus and now he's walking with you all all along why are you so happy Jesus is with me man that guy's always happy why is he always smiling what they don't see is Jesus right and then they'll ask you hey why are you so happy Jesus what do you mean Jesus well because Jesus is with me he brings joy in my heart oh but you know what you're in a wheelchair that's okay because he he's going to either heal me here on this Earth he got another body for me waiting for me but nevertheless I'm going to put my trust in him no matter what so how many of you are going to put your trust in Jesus amen so let us all stand and let's pray can we pray all right we're GNA have Jesus pray okay oh heavenly father thank you so much for this simple message Lord bless brother Mike and everyone who helps him in the children's church ministry all the faithful children who come Sunday after Sunday they are standing for me father and I want to stand for them so I send them blessings in the name above all names the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ and that they may always know that I am with them even in them until the ends of the Earth in the
