[23:39] and Uncle Billy brought a guitar that he
[23:41] had and my grandpa was sitting there and
[23:44] he asked well can you play something and
[23:47] so I started playing the guitar and and
[23:49] we were singing in English and there was
[23:51] this one particular song that he really
[23:53] really loved and he made us sing it over
[23:56] and over amen those of you that were

[42:35] question we hear it
[42:40] daily do you believe that Jesus Christ
[42:42] is the
[42:43] same yesterday today and
[42:50] forever many times we
[42:52] doubt the
[42:54] present we believe in the the
[42:59] past and many times we forget about the
[43:02] future but if we believe
[43:06] that there lies are the answer to of our
[43:10] if we believe with all our
[43:12] hearts that the Lord Jesus
[43:16] Christ was the same one who paid the
[43:18] price on
[43:20] Calvary for every sickness every
[43:25] need he is the same present
[43:29] today to give us the
[43:33] solution with all your
[43:35] heart if you have a
[43:38] need and want to indicate it by raising
[43:41] your
[43:42] hand
[43:44] truly and
[43:47] today today is the true father because
[43:51] every
[43:52] day is a Father's Day
[43:57] it's the day that we should honor our
[43:59] heavenly
[44:00] father why don't we give him that
[44:03] honor to our Heavenly
[44:06] Father to believe him with all our
[44:09] hearts and tell him
[44:12] Lord you are my
[44:14] father I may not have a physical
[44:17] father but your promise
[44:20] said that you will never abandon
[44:23] us you will never leave us or
[44:27] that tells us that we have a
[44:29] father and that is the father of
[44:31] fathers the one who answers our
[44:34] needs if you pleased by
[44:36] your as we pray for these
[44:39] petitions and for every petition that
[44:41] you have all you need to do is believe
[44:45] our heavenly
[44:47] father and for offerings and
[44:50] [Music]
[44:54] tithings let's bow our heads and
[45:00] [Music]
[45:04] pray let's take our time to clear our
[45:15] [Music]
[45:17] thoughts so we can recognize where we're

[1:18:21] us it's the same thing with Christ when
[1:18:23] you decid to give him a
[1:18:25] vote he is your
[1:18:31] husband and he is to come back for his
[1:18:34] beloved uh
[1:18:38] bride and saying so they are now
[1:18:42] married because they gave each other
[1:18:44] their vows or their
[1:18:46] word but then the ceremony
[1:18:50] comes they have to wait till the
[1:18:52] ceremony
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:56] and there is where the bride takes the
[1:18:58] last name of her
[1:19:02] husband so then she won't have her
[1:19:06] own that's the reason why
[1:19:10] [Music]

[1:19:15] Christ has called

[1:19:42] help may they be prepared for the day of
[1:19:45] their
[1:19:47] ceremony and after the

[1:33:47] the congregation wishing each one of you
[1:33:49] a happy Father's Day
[1:33:57] uh today being Father's
[1:34:00] Day I found uh thoughts of fathers
[1:34:03] moving in my
[1:34:07] heart I was a little surprised because I
[1:34:09] I've had a thought that's been on my
[1:34:12] heart for many
[1:34:16] months and I haven't quite everywhere I
[1:34:18] go I haven't quite been able to not
[1:34:20] preach about it
[1:34:24] I think in Prescott we have probably 17
[1:34:26] messages on the subject Faith as a
[1:34:28] mustard
[1:34:34] seed but uh as the Lord began to move on
[1:34:37] my heart about
[1:34:41] fathers but in particular I was thinking
[1:34:44] of the founding fathers of our great
[1:34:50] nation
[1:34:52] the United States of
[1:34:54] America uh which reminds
[1:34:56] me just so that you know I I I full
[1:35:02] disclosure uh the other day somebody
[1:35:04] said brother
[1:35:05] Bernie said are you growing a
[1:35:09] mustache it's funny because if I grow a
[1:35:11] beard nobody says
[1:35:14] anything but if I shave the beard and
[1:35:16] leave the
[1:35:19] mustache they they they want to know if
[1:35:21] I'm a
[1:35:23] mustache and um I said yes
[1:35:27] Brothers I have to grow a mustache
[1:35:31] now why brother I said because last
[1:35:36] Thursday my dad took me to the Mexican
[1:35:40] culate and he signed the papers so I can
[1:35:43] become a Mexican
[1:35:46] national and you can't be a Mexican and
[1:35:49] not have a
[1:35:50] mustache
[1:35:52] so I um so I'm going to mustache now
[1:35:55] just so that you know in case you're
[1:35:56] curious why does brother Bernie have a
[1:35:58] mustache
[1:36:02] now so um so my this area is Mexican and
[1:36:06] the rest of is
[1:36:08] American
[1:36:11] amen so we have a great nation
[1:36:14] here United States of
[1:36:17] America and uh while we in America we
[1:36:20] look at our founding
[1:36:23] fathers I would invite you on in the
[1:36:28] internet whatever country that you are
[1:36:32] in to think about the founding fathers
[1:36:35] of your
[1:36:37] nation the great man that made your
[1:36:41] nation able to
[1:36:48] start those uh great man that formed the
[1:36:50] Constitution
[1:36:54] to help stabilize your your situations
[1:37:01] there uh the founding fathers of of our
[1:37:05] nation
[1:37:08] uh are the ones I'm going to talk about
[1:37:10] today of the United States of
[1:37:14] America and I like I said don't mean any
[1:37:17] disrespect to any other country I'm sure
[1:37:18] that you have your founding fathers also
[1:37:26] but I don't want to talk about them in a
[1:37:28] historical
[1:37:31] context but more in a in a religious
[1:37:36] context and really maybe only just kind
[1:37:38] of skimming through
[1:37:41] it and uh taking some thoughts what
[1:37:45] brother brandham
[1:37:48] said and then tying those into some
[1:37:50] areas
[1:37:51] that might be relevant to our
[1:37:55] life to our personal
[1:37:59] history uh both our
[1:38:01] present our future our
[1:38:04] past and just kind of see where the Lord
[1:38:07] takes
[1:38:09] us I um I was telling the brothers I'm a
[1:38:11] little
[1:38:13] nervous uh don't not usually nervous
[1:38:15] when I
[1:38:17] speak but I had this thought that the
[1:38:20] Lord put in me and I and I I started
[1:38:22] trying to write it down so I wouldn't
[1:38:27] forget and I ran that a little bit out
[1:38:29] of
[1:38:30] time so I don't have it all written down
[1:38:32] like I usually would like to have it
[1:38:33] written
[1:38:37] down so when we get to the end of the
[1:38:41] book I'll be as interested to see how
[1:38:43] the ending is as as maybe you will
[1:38:48] be and speaking about the our fathers we
[1:38:51] think of our then the word would be our
[1:38:57] forefathers which means that they
[1:38:59] they're they're not our immediate
[1:39:00] fathers
[1:39:03] right they were before our
[1:39:06] fathers and yet our fathers have somehow
[1:39:09] maintained the teachings of those
[1:39:10] fathers
[1:39:15] alive or or the tradition at least has
[1:39:18] been kept
[1:39:20] going
[1:39:22] so we have some kind of a knowledge of
[1:39:24] who those who those who our ancestry
[1:39:29] is where where we came
[1:39:32] from okay so brother Braham says in the
[1:39:35] message be certain of
[1:39:39] God he says he's preached in h January
[1:39:42] the 25th of
[1:39:46] 1959 says we've got to the place to
[1:39:49] think that the because we're resting
[1:39:52] upon what our forefathers
[1:39:59] did or what Upon Our great
[1:40:04] founders of our
[1:40:10] churches what their great sacrifice was
[1:40:13] to
[1:40:16] God which is all
[1:40:18] right and so much appreci
[1:40:23] so the the first thing that draws my
[1:40:25] attention with what brother Bram is
[1:40:28] saying is that when we think of the
[1:40:32] forefathers we're actually thinking
[1:40:34] about the
[1:40:36] founders it could be the founder of a
[1:40:40] Nation uh the founder of a
[1:40:42] tribe the founder of a village or of a
[1:40:46] town so the founders are considered to
[1:40:49] be our forefathers
[1:40:53] so you might move into a
[1:40:56] town let just say
[1:40:59] Johnsonville Johnsonville was founded by
[1:41:02] a man named
[1:41:04] Johnson and if you begin to immerse in
[1:41:06] the the in the culture of
[1:41:10] Johnsonville Johson and to ingrain
[1:41:13] yourself into that uh
[1:41:17] Community you might find yourself
[1:41:19] talking about Johnsonville to
[1:41:24] somebody you might say something like
[1:41:27] our
[1:41:29] founder established our city in
[1:41:34] 1830 or you might be saying when our
[1:41:37] forefathers lifted up the city
[1:41:44] hall so you can see that that this term
[1:41:48] of forefathers or founders
[1:41:54] doesn't necessarily have to do with
[1:41:56] where you grew up
[1:41:59] in or what your lineage
[1:42:02] is but rather has to do with the degree
[1:42:05] with which you are willing to identify
[1:42:08] with the community in which you are
[1:42:15] living I mean you might have come from
[1:42:18] Waka but you're identified with
[1:42:22] Johnsonville and you would say our
[1:42:25] founder what do you mean your
[1:42:27] founder you're from Waka oh but I live
[1:42:30] in Johnsonville Johnsonville it's a it's
[1:42:33] a matter of
[1:42:36] identifying and brother Brown is talking
[1:42:38] about how that we identify with our
[1:42:43] Founders and our forefathers and what
[1:42:46] they
[1:42:48] did but he said we get to a
[1:42:52] point that we think now he hasn't told
[1:42:55] us yet what we
[1:42:57] think but we think that
[1:43:01] because we are
[1:43:05] standing or
[1:43:07] resting upon what those Founders or
[1:43:10] forefathers have
[1:43:14] done they're thinking
[1:43:17] something and their thoughts are based
[1:43:19] upon the fact
[1:43:22] are resting on their for
[1:43:27] Founders what their great sacrifice was
[1:43:31] to
[1:43:33] God which is all
[1:43:35] right how many of you appreciate what
[1:43:38] your father has done for
[1:43:40] you I appreciate the things that my
[1:43:43] father has done for
[1:43:45] me I appreciate the things that I have
[1:43:47] seen him do for
[1:43:49] others
[1:43:51] you know I was telling the brothers in
[1:43:53] in in uh in
[1:43:56] Genoa we sat down at a table having
[1:44:00] fellowship and the brothers had just
[1:44:02] arrived from New
[1:44:04] Mexico and two brothers sat
[1:44:07] down and they've known me all my
[1:44:10] life and I've seen them almost all my
[1:44:13] life I've SE him in all the
[1:44:15] conventions I see him when we go visit
[1:44:17] the church over
[1:44:19] there I see when they come here they
[1:44:22] they they're very active in their
[1:44:24] travel and so we sat down to
[1:44:27] talk and it was the first time in my
[1:44:31] life that I had sat down and had a
[1:44:34] conversation with these two
[1:44:37] brothers I had knew them but I didn't
[1:44:41] know
[1:44:43] them and so they they asked me a very
[1:44:45] strange
[1:44:47] question it really blew my mind
[1:44:51] they said Bernie Bernie brother Bernie
[1:44:54] Bernie how did your dad come into the
[1:44:59] message I mean I couldn't I it blew my
[1:45:04] mind how how could these
[1:45:06] brothers good friends of ours and not
[1:45:10] know how my dad came into the
[1:45:13] message so I began to explain to them
[1:45:15] how that my dad came into the
[1:45:19] message how he grew up how he met
[1:45:22] brother
[1:45:23] Bram how that he ran away from
[1:45:26] home how that he was in the he was doing
[1:45:29] a drug
[1:45:32] run he was crossing
[1:45:35] Mexico bito Mexico to pick up some
[1:45:40] drugs across the
[1:45:42] states when the Holy Spirit came
[1:45:47] down and said Son don't take these drugs
[1:45:52] across the
[1:45:54] border they've ratted you
[1:45:56] out how many of you have heard the
[1:45:59] story oh not everybody okay I was going
[1:46:03] to skip it but I guess maybe I'll tell
[1:46:05] it it's Father's Day so let's let's
[1:46:07] uncover a little bit of my Dad's life
[1:46:11] okay he said he said Son do not take the
[1:46:15] drugs across the
[1:46:16] border they're going to be waiting for
[1:46:18] you at the border
[1:46:21] now this is the holy spirit talking to
[1:46:23] my
[1:46:24] dad a drug
[1:46:29] dealer he's a drug
[1:46:31] dealer and the Holy Spirit is talking to
[1:46:36] him gifts and calling are without
[1:46:41] what without
[1:46:43] repentance if he was an apostle
[1:46:47] once he always was an apostle
[1:46:51] if God was with him once he always was
[1:46:53] with
[1:46:55] him don't be
[1:46:58] fooled into thinking that God found
[1:47:02] you but you might have discovered that
[1:47:04] God was interested in
[1:47:07] you you might have thought you found
[1:47:11] God but God has always had you in his
[1:47:15] hand but Jesus said all that the father
[1:47:18] have given me
[1:47:21] are in my
[1:47:22] hands and the father will not lose one
[1:47:26] of them so here was the drug
[1:47:30] dealer about to take drugs across the
[1:47:34] border and God sends his
[1:47:38] Spirit to speak to that
[1:47:41] gift and say son do not take the drugs
[1:47:45] across the
[1:47:47] border you say well why are you making
[1:47:49] so much emphasis on that
[1:47:52] because that's okay it's the next thing
[1:47:55] that blows my
[1:47:57] mind He says Dad say so well what do I
[1:48:03] do and the spirit tells him throw it
[1:48:07] across the
[1:48:08] fence and go back and pick it up from
[1:48:11] the other
[1:48:13] [Laughter]
[1:48:18] side wow
[1:48:21] wow so he threw the drugs across the
[1:48:26] border there's a long road that you go
[1:48:28] across the border when you go into the
[1:48:32] line and there's desert on the other
[1:48:34] side they threw it across the
[1:48:37] border they continued on to the
[1:48:40] line and as soon as they got into the
[1:48:43] into the where the booth Booth booths
[1:48:45] were
[1:48:48] at there came like
[1:48:52] flies on
[1:48:55] honey and there's my dad and all his
[1:48:59] buddies all high all Mar all drugged
[1:49:03] up laughing their heads off at these
[1:49:07] poor guys they knew they weren't going
[1:49:11] to find
[1:49:12] nothing cuz they had already been warned
[1:49:14] to throw it across the
[1:49:18] border they tore the car
[1:49:21] apart they brought the
[1:49:23] dogs they could smell the
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:26] marijuana but there was nothing to be
[1:49:29] found and my dad's laughing his head off
[1:49:32] at them the whole
[1:49:35] time they crossed the
[1:49:38] border they take a drive it took 20 30
[1:49:41] minutes to drive to the spot that across
[1:49:43] where they had throwing the drugs
[1:49:47] over but says I'll be back boys
[1:49:51] he gets
[1:49:53] out and he goes and walks and pick up
[1:49:55] the
[1:49:58] drugs he picks up the
[1:50:00] drugs he's walking
[1:50:03] back and all of a sudden there's the
[1:50:08] Migra how do you say Migra in
[1:50:11] English well now you would call it ice
[1:50:14] right the bar border patrol
[1:50:17] right the home front the Border border
[1:50:20] control people home
[1:50:23] security homeand Security Homeland
[1:50:27] Security all around him and there's my
[1:50:31] dad tall guy six
[1:50:33] foot about 96
[1:50:37] PB he's crouched down by a
[1:50:41] bush now you think why did God tell him
[1:50:45] and advise
[1:50:49] him
[1:50:50] not to take the drugs
[1:50:54] across and to throw it across the
[1:50:57] fence and to pick it up
[1:51:00] later you think maybe God might have had
[1:51:02] a
[1:51:03] plan I think God had a plan so there he
[1:51:07] is and he's he's there crouching by that
[1:51:12] bush all around him are the border
[1:51:15] patrol and think oh God I'm in a I'm I'm
[1:51:19] I'm in it now
[1:51:23] and all of the
[1:51:25] scriptures that his
[1:51:27] father had taught him and made him learn
[1:51:30] when he was a we
[1:51:34] boy began to come back to
[1:51:37] him as the Holy
[1:51:40] Spirit began to speak to his
[1:51:43] gift and give him the words of eternal
[1:51:48] life that seed
[1:51:50] that Daddy had planted in my in my dad's
[1:51:57] heart 12 or 13 years
[1:52:01] before that had seemed
[1:52:03] dormant that weren't doing
[1:52:06] anything but that seed was still
[1:52:09] there and when the Holy Spirit came to
[1:52:12] brood upon
[1:52:15] it and begin to strike those words of
[1:52:19] Promise of eternal
[1:52:22] life my dad
[1:52:26] realized I'm
[1:52:28] lost everything my dad taught
[1:52:30] me the word everything that the word of
[1:52:32] God
[1:52:33] says but now now it's too late now I'm
[1:52:37] I'm busted
[1:52:38] here so crouched down by that
[1:52:42] bush he said
[1:52:45] Lord if you'll take me out of this one
[1:52:48] how many of you have said that before
[1:52:52] God if you'll take me out of this
[1:52:56] one I'll serve
[1:52:59] you if you give me a job
[1:53:01] Lord I promise this time I'll pay my
[1:53:05] ti I I promise I I'll give some offering
[1:53:09] Lord if you help me don't lose my
[1:53:13] house if you help me get out of this
[1:53:15] problem we always we like we like to
[1:53:18] bargain with God
[1:53:20] we bargue with him with our
[1:53:22] time with our money with our
[1:53:26] careers but those things aren't worth
[1:53:28] anything to
[1:53:29] God he doesn't move on the scene for
[1:53:31] those
[1:53:33] things and my dad when he bargained with
[1:53:38] God he bargained with his soul in his
[1:53:42] hand he said if you get me out of this
[1:53:45] one I promise I'll serve you all the
[1:53:49] days of my
[1:53:53] amen amen well they passed all around
[1:53:57] him I said Dad how did they not see
[1:54:00] you he said son I don't know how they
[1:54:02] didn't see
[1:54:04] me they were right there upon me all
[1:54:07] around me looking for me and they could
[1:54:12] not find
[1:54:14] me said when they gave
[1:54:17] up I walked
[1:54:20] back to the
[1:54:21] car got in the car and we drove
[1:54:24] off he said I still had that big old bag
[1:54:27] of drugs with
[1:54:30] me and he was kind of he kind of laughed
[1:54:33] when he said this
[1:54:35] part I said you know how it is
[1:54:38] son we remember those things that are
[1:54:40] convenient to
[1:54:44] us so he says
[1:54:47] Lord my good daddy taught me not to
[1:54:50] waste
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:54:56] anything so he had a big
[1:55:00] party about two weeks
[1:55:03] party finishing those drugs up because
[1:55:05] you couldn't going to waste
[1:55:07] them couldn't sell
[1:55:10] them right so he he consumed
[1:55:13] them when he got to the end of that two
[1:55:17] weeks then the Holy Spirit came and
[1:55:20] reminded
[1:55:22] him of his
[1:55:24] promise and he got
[1:55:26] up and he was
[1:55:29] high and they went to the
[1:55:33] church went to the pastor's house I
[1:55:36] won't tell that story but he went to the
[1:55:38] pastor's house and anyways the pastor
[1:55:39] baptized
[1:55:43] him he got up out of the baptismal
[1:55:46] Waters his friends took him home
[1:55:50] he fell
[1:55:51] asleep totally drugged
[1:55:54] out he woke up the next
[1:55:57] morning and as was his
[1:56:02] habit reached over to grab his
[1:56:07] joint they said they used to make them
[1:56:09] really big not these little small ones
[1:56:11] that they
[1:56:12] make big
[1:56:15] joints everything my dad did he did it
[1:56:17] full
[1:56:18] blast
[1:56:21] so he reached over to grab his
[1:56:23] joint and as he was going to
[1:56:25] light he thought he thought that he
[1:56:29] remembered that he had got baptized the
[1:56:31] night
[1:56:33] before so he called his
[1:56:36] buddies they came into the
[1:56:38] room he said hey uh did I dream it or
[1:56:41] did I get baptized last
[1:56:43] night oh they started laughing yeah you
[1:56:46] got
[1:56:47] baptized it was crazy
[1:56:52] he got up started to put his clothes
[1:56:55] on I said what are you
[1:56:58] doing he said I'm going to
[1:57:01] church what do you mean you're going to
[1:57:03] church it's the morning he said I got to
[1:57:06] go get the Holy
[1:57:08] Ghost he was taught when he was a young
[1:57:11] boy he he went to the church they were
[1:57:15] having a prayer
[1:57:16] service and he walked in there
[1:57:20] knelt
[1:57:21] down and he said Lord your scriptures I
[1:57:25] learned from my daddy your
[1:57:28] scriptures says that if I repent and be
[1:57:31] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:57:32] Christ I shall receive the gift of the
[1:57:34] Holy
[1:57:37] Ghost I've
[1:57:39] repented I was baptized and now I know
[1:57:43] that for me to be able to live a
[1:57:45] Christian
[1:57:47] Life I can't do it
[1:57:50] I need for you to give me your
[1:57:54] spirit amen I fulfilled all the
[1:57:57] requirements I'm here for you to fill me
[1:58:00] with the Holy
[1:58:01] Ghost and right there God filled him
[1:58:04] with the Holy
[1:58:07] Ghost AM he was
[1:58:10] committed he was committed he was
[1:58:12] surrendered he wasn't holding anything
[1:58:15] back and he had the scripture to back up
[1:58:18] his petition
[1:58:24] amen and from that
[1:58:26] moment he never touched
[1:58:29] drug women
[1:58:32] alcohol do the things of the
[1:58:34] world from that moment that he received
[1:58:36] the Holy Ghost he began to serve
[1:58:40] God what a
[1:58:42] great Foundation I say it that
[1:58:47] way the founder of our church has laid
[1:58:50] for
[1:58:53] us what a foundation for us to be able
[1:58:55] to build
[1:58:58] upon and to be able to say if if he can
[1:59:01] do
[1:59:03] it then I can do
[1:59:06] it because he admitted freely he
[1:59:08] admitted
[1:59:12] freely God there's no
[1:59:15] way that I can live a Christian Life
[1:59:20] unless you come and give me the Holy
[1:59:23] Ghost and that's what we need to
[1:59:26] understand more than anything it doesn't
[1:59:29] matter how hard you try to live a a
[1:59:32] certain type of a
[1:59:35] life there has to be a fundamental
[1:59:40] change of your
[1:59:42] nature God has to come in and put his
[1:59:46] spirit inside of
[1:59:48] you you must be born
[1:59:51] again and at the beginning of his
[1:59:55] walk he understood this from the
[1:59:57] scriptures that his fathers had taught
[2:00:01] him the scriptures that my forefather
[2:00:04] taught
[2:00:07] him amen
[2:00:12] amen we cannot brother bram's continuing
[2:00:16] we appreciate their great sacrifice
[2:00:20] but we cannot draw salvation from what
[2:00:24] they
[2:00:26] did salvation is an individual
[2:00:30] Affair between every person and
[2:00:35] God not with our
[2:00:37] nation not with our
[2:00:40] church but with
[2:00:42] ourselves before God amen
[2:00:48] amen
[2:00:49] in the message of the
[2:00:52] breach brother brah says our our
[2:00:54] national
[2:00:57] Spirit Frolic Frolic having
[2:01:01] fun we always want to be
[2:01:05] playing
[2:01:07] jokes you know
[2:01:09] why we were founded upon the doctrine of
[2:01:13] the
[2:01:17] Apostles we were founding upon
[2:01:19] leadership of Great
[2:01:22] Men like Washington Washington Lincoln
[2:01:26] Lincoln but we have moved off that
[2:01:30] foundation and we know that we've got it
[2:01:36] coming so so here now now he's talking
[2:01:39] about our
[2:01:42] founding and he's TI it with the
[2:01:44] doctrines of the
[2:01:47] Apostles so in my my mind when I hear
[2:01:50] this I think
[2:01:53] fathers
[2:01:55] forefathers
[2:01:57] Founders Apostles to me they're like
[2:02:02] cinnamons when you talk about an
[2:02:04] apostle about a
[2:02:07] Founder talking about an
[2:02:09] apostle somebody who has placed it in
[2:02:13] order like the Apostle Paul said I like
[2:02:16] a Chief
[2:02:17] Architect
[2:02:21] have laid down the
[2:02:23] foundation he he's the
[2:02:26] founder he put the foundation down he
[2:02:30] started the
[2:02:31] work
[2:02:38] amen
[2:02:42] okay now when
[2:02:44] Abram was 99 years
[2:02:47] old the Lord appeared unto
[2:02:51] him and he said I am almighty
[2:02:57] God God wasn't
[2:03:00] shy he went right to
[2:03:03] Abram he
[2:03:05] said I'm almighty
[2:03:09] God now ABR didn't have a reference
[2:03:15] point Abraham was the is called the
[2:03:17] father of our
[2:03:20] faith the originator of our
[2:03:24] faith point
[2:03:27] zero God didn't really have a
[2:03:31] relationship with
[2:03:33] anybody before
[2:03:37] Abram Noah found Grace in his
[2:03:41] eyes
[2:03:45] Noah Enoch pleased him so much that he
[2:03:47] walked away with him
[2:03:51] but other than
[2:03:52] that there's no
[2:03:55] relationship God is not really shown as
[2:03:58] a a God who will have a personal
[2:04:00] relationship with
[2:04:06] somebody but he goes to
[2:04:08] Abraham say I am almighty
[2:04:12] God Amen walk with
[2:04:17] me I'll make a
[2:04:19] Covenant between thee between me and
[2:04:24] thee leave your family leave your
[2:04:29] paren leave your
[2:04:32] identification leave who you're
[2:04:33] associated
[2:04:35] with let's make a different Association
[2:04:38] now you have your fathers you have your
[2:04:42] forefathers I'm going to show you a
[2:04:44] different
[2:04:46] path you're going to be the father of
[2:04:48] many nations
[2:04:50] you're going to be the
[2:04:53] forefather me and you let's get together
[2:04:56] now let's make a
[2:04:58] p amen I will multiply the
[2:05:06] exceedingly and Abraham 99 years old he
[2:05:10] had already left his
[2:05:13] Kindred God had already spoken to him
[2:05:16] and now God's approaching him again
[2:05:20] you can say God's about to confirm his
[2:05:22] pact with
[2:05:25] Abraham maybe Abraham thought it was
[2:05:27] already
[2:05:29] completed maybe is was already
[2:05:32] born and he thought it's all it's it's
[2:05:35] done God's
[2:05:37] good so at 99 years
[2:05:40] old Abraham's probably getting ready to
[2:05:42] to die now he's going home in
[2:05:46] peace God comes to him and says okay
[2:05:51] Abraham let's make this
[2:05:55] deal Abraham Falls before his
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:05:59] face and here we are in Genesis
[2:06:02] 17 verse
[2:06:04] 4 and God speaking to Abraham
[2:06:07] says as for
[2:06:10] me
[2:06:11] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[2:06:16] shalt be a father of many nations
[2:06:25] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[2:06:26] Abraham but thy name shall be Abraham
[2:06:30] for a father of many nations have I made
[2:06:39] thee many
[2:06:41] nations I want you to notice that God
[2:06:45] made
[2:06:46] Abraham the father
[2:06:49] of many
[2:06:53] nations you got people all over the
[2:06:57] world oh yeah Father
[2:06:59] Abraham oh yeah my father Abraham we're
[2:07:01] we're fathers of
[2:07:03] Abraham and they're all at war with each
[2:07:08] other amen they're all trying to kill
[2:07:11] each other
[2:07:15] off but the angel told Abraham
[2:07:19] the seed of your woman of your of Sarah
[2:07:23] the seed of the
[2:07:26] woman the free
[2:07:28] woman shall not inherit with the seed of
[2:07:32] the bonds
[2:07:36] woman everywhere I go sometimes it
[2:07:39] seems everybody's telling
[2:07:42] me your dad's my
[2:07:44] pastor your dad's my
[2:07:47] pastor all right your dad's my
[2:07:51] father but they don't do the things that
[2:07:53] he
[2:07:54] did I got to I used to
[2:07:57] wonder how is it that they say he's
[2:08:00] their spiritual father and they don't do
[2:08:02] the things he
[2:08:06] did amen when I begin to read the
[2:08:09] scripture I begin to
[2:08:12] see no wonder I can't go against
[2:08:17] them can it's
[2:08:20] impossible seed doesn't persecute
[2:08:24] seed but yet they will persecute
[2:08:28] me because they can't help
[2:08:30] it they don't have the same mother that
[2:08:33] I
[2:08:37] have
[2:08:38] amen you'll be a father of many
[2:08:43] nations now this is a great promise that
[2:08:46] God gave
[2:08:47] Abraham
[2:08:49] to your children to your children's
[2:08:53] children as long as you go down the
[2:08:56] line I will bless you and multiply
[2:09:00] you the angel of the Lord appeared to
[2:09:03] the
[2:09:06] Egyptian and told
[2:09:08] her go back s
[2:09:11] Sarah I'm going to bless your
[2:09:13] son he gave her water out of the
[2:09:17] Rock
[2:09:19] bless the son in her
[2:09:23] womb it's a blessed
[2:09:26] Nation they're rich God has given them
[2:09:30] riches but they don't have an
[2:09:33] inheritance with
[2:09:35] Israel it's
[2:09:37] different
[2:09:40] amen man God Appears to
[2:09:46] Isaac in chapter 26
[2:09:49] of
[2:09:50] Genesis and he walks up to
[2:09:53] Isaac the Lord does he walks up to
[2:09:56] Isaac and he tells
[2:09:58] Isaac
[2:10:01] Isaac who are
[2:10:05] you so no I think that would be us that
[2:10:08] would be us I
[2:10:10] think I think if God came up to you and
[2:10:13] talk to
[2:10:14] you most of you would

[2:27:03] eye Joseph gets swn into
[2:27:06] slavery we all know what happened in
[2:27:07] Egypt
[2:27:08] right he became Pharaoh's right hand
[2:27:13] man now now here in Genesis
[2:27:17] 45 Joseph is going to reveal
[2:27:21] himself to his
[2:27:24] brothers the ones that sold him into
[2:27:27] slavery who threw them down threw him
[2:27:29] down the
[2:27:31] tomb it's going to reveal himself to
[2:27:34] them and Joseph said unto his
[2:27:37] Brethren come near to me I pray thee
[2:27:40] verse four
[2:27:42] MH and they came near M and he said I am
[2:27:47] Joseph your brother whom you sold into
[2:27:59] slavery now therefore be not
[2:28:04] grieved nor angry with
[2:28:07] yourselves that you sold me
[2:28:10] hither for God did send me before
[2:28:15] you to preserve
[2:28:19] life hallelujah
[2:28:22] amen for these two years has the famine
[2:28:26] been in the
[2:28:29] land and yet there are five more years
[2:28:31] to
[2:28:34] come in which there will never be
[2:28:36] earring nor
[2:28:39] Harvest and God sent
[2:28:42] me before you to preserve a posterity in
[2:28:47] the
[2:28:48] earth and to save your life by a great
[2:28:54] Deliverance so now it was not
[2:28:57] you that sent me
[2:28:59] away but
[2:29:01] God and he hath made
[2:29:06] me a
[2:29:08] father to
[2:29:10] Pharaoh amen
[2:29:14] amen my goodness mhm
[2:29:17] he didn't assimilate to Pharaoh's
[2:29:23] culture Pharaoh assimilated into his
[2:29:27] culture Pharaoh didn't become his
[2:29:31] daddy he became Pharaoh's
[2:29:38] Daddy and he's made me a
[2:29:41] Lord of all of his
[2:29:45] house
[2:29:47] throughout all of the land of
[2:29:50] Egypt and he sends for his
[2:29:54] daddy I want you to I want you to watch
[2:30:00] this Joseph stands for his
[2:30:05] papa bring him over
[2:30:07] here oh Dad he's not going to want to
[2:30:09] come tell him I'm alive he's old he's he
[2:30:14] can't make the
[2:30:15] journey bring
[2:30:17] him so he didn't want to
[2:30:20] come he didn't believe
[2:30:23] them so what
[2:30:25] happens God had to come down
[2:30:29] again and talk to
[2:30:32] Israel and tell
[2:30:34] Israel hey hey it's okay I'm going to be
[2:30:38] with you you can make the
[2:30:40] journey up to where Joseph
[2:30:42] is but I want you to
[2:30:45] notice how how he addresses
[2:30:49] him Genesis chapter 46 and we're going
[2:30:52] to close with
[2:30:54] this verse
[2:30:56] two and God spake unto Israel in the
[2:31:01] visions of the
[2:31:04] night and he
[2:31:07] said can you read it with me what did he
[2:31:11] say Jacob
[2:31:15] Jacob
[2:31:22] God told
[2:31:24] Jacob your name shall not be called
[2:31:26] Israel no
[2:31:28] more shall not be called Jacob no more
[2:31:31] it shall be called Israel you are the
[2:31:35] prince you're the
[2:31:39] ruler but now he comes to the same
[2:31:43] man the Bible says he spoke unto to
[2:31:50] Israel and he said
[2:31:52] Jacob
[2:31:54] Jacob here am
[2:31:57] I he said here am I he knew who was
[2:32:01] talking to
[2:32:02] him and he answered he didn't say oh
[2:32:06] excuse me
[2:32:07] sir but I'm not Jacob anymore I'm
[2:32:12] Israel he
[2:32:14] answered here I am
[2:32:19] he said I am
[2:32:21] God the god of thy
[2:32:24] father fear not to go into
[2:32:27] Egypt for I will
[2:32:29] there make thee a great
[2:32:33] nation and as you go down the
[2:32:36] line he tells him what he has done with
[2:32:41] Joseph he calls him
[2:32:44] Jacob because the leadership
[2:32:47] has gone from
[2:32:51] Israel
[2:32:53] wow wow let us
[2:33:02] stand yet a little
[2:33:05] while and the world will see me no
[2:33:09] more he shall see
[2:33:11] me PR shall be with you even in you the
