[28:42] reading the scripture you may be seated
[28:45] reading the scripture there's only one
[28:47] word i could really
[28:48] sum this up to and that is
[28:51] one word a conference
[28:54] conference that's what god was calling
[28:56] and he was calling for a conference
[28:58] a conference is usually when he wants to
[29:00] settle things
[29:01] he wants to get it over with let's get
[29:03] the punches over with let's get what's
[29:05] holding you back and let's move on
[29:08] let's settle things let's serve god and
[29:10] let's move on
[29:12] so
[29:13] i took this extract from
[29:16] brother branham
[29:18] we're going to read
[29:22] and then god has held some great
[29:24] conferences there come a time in
[29:26] god's great economy where here had
[29:29] where there had to be a conference held
[29:32] let's talk about the very first one that
[29:33] was held in the garden of eden
[29:36] and the first one was called
[29:39] good call of the earth was in the garden
[29:41] of eden when the angels of god come home
[29:43] weeping saying your child has fallen he
[29:46] sinned and he's broken your commandments
[29:48] something had to be done
[29:50] the creature of god had fallen from
[29:52] grace
[29:53] and was a subject unto eternal
[29:55] separation from presence of his god and
[29:58] his maker
[29:59] it was a crucial moment for the king
[30:02] of heaven
[30:04] had said
[30:05] the day you eat thereof the day you
[30:07] shall surely die
[30:09] and putting his trust into his son his
[30:11] son had broke his commandment there had
[30:14] to be something done it was his creation
[30:19] it was the work of his own hand
[30:22] it was
[30:23] a love of his heart
[30:26] the apple of his high
[30:28] wow
[30:29] today if you don't know that you're the
[30:31] love of his heart
[30:33] the apple of his eye
[30:35] i pray that the lord reveal it to you
[30:39] something must be done so there had to
[30:41] be a conference called
[30:46] there was a conference called
[30:49] at the red sea
[30:50] there's way too many conferences through
[30:52] the scriptures and through the bible and
[30:54] to to actually condense it right now in
[30:55] the time that i have so if i jump around
[30:57] you'll understand
[31:00] there was a conference called at the red
[31:01] sea
[31:02] israel was trapped with no escape
[31:05] they stopped that's the worst mistake
[31:07] that the church of god can ever do
[31:13] do you know that the enemy
[31:15] is right behind you always at your heels
[31:20] you know we had a camp
[31:23] we've had a camp
[31:24] kids are on fire
[31:26] children are on fire they receive the
[31:28] holy ghost
[31:34] you know what happened
[31:36] they stopped
[31:38] they stopped
[31:42] we must understand that the devil
[31:44] is always right behind them
[31:46] always right behind us
[31:48] when i ex
[31:50] when i
[31:51] received my experience i went home
[31:54] when i went home

[32:00] and showing me how much of how much

[32:03] there's not
[32:04] the devil's always ready there to test
[32:06] your experience
[32:08] and he's gonna test everybody
[32:11] that's what's
[32:12] happening i'm sorry
[32:15] but black is black white is white

[32:23] they were his people when he left
[32:26] they became his church

[38:46] come to the red sea and they had to call
[38:48] it halt
[38:49] they couldn't
[38:51] so you don't know it's just a step one
[38:53] this is the prophet's words
[38:56] okay you call him the liar
[38:58] you tell him to shut up but you can't
[39:00] tell him because it's already been
[39:01] spoken

[47:10] nothing

[47:27] saints the future and everybody on his
[47:31] soul and his soul was being pressed that

[47:36] holy spirit it pushed it pressed the
[47:39] holy spirit away
[47:45] he had to die a man

[47:55] body isn't made that way i was shot i

[48:53] nothing died the kind of death but him
[48:56] and
[48:56] at the conference such a decision was
[48:58] made into the blood
[49:00] dropped from his brow and he was under a
[49:03] strain the sins of the world upon him
[49:07] and then he looked
[49:09] into the face of dove
[49:12] because they were communicating at the
[49:13] rock
[49:18] not i will father
[49:21] he asked him three times in a prayer
[49:23] father
[49:24] abba father that's like
[49:26] telling your dad a nickname
[49:28] father

[49:32] but thy will
[49:33] the man jesus was crying out take it but
[49:36] i was sent for a mission

[49:53] jesus christ
[49:54] entered jesus christ left jesus a dead
[49:58] man walking he died to himself
[50:02] that shows we should die to ourselves
[50:04] because he died to himself he carried it
[50:07] on he was beaten all night long
[50:10] beards ripped from his face
[50:12] spit on
[50:14] i know how it is to be spit on
[50:16] i was in the gutter
[50:18] i was actually spit on
[50:23] i roamed the streets with no shirt and
[50:25] shoes because i was just
[50:28] beside myself
[50:30] all i could worry about was just another
[50:32] fix because i couldn't take what i've
[50:34] been through i couldn't take it because
[50:35] all the sins that i was carrying i knew
[50:37] i was wrong
[50:39] but i didn't want to answer the
[50:40] conference call
[50:42] god was calling me all through that time
[50:48] maybe you're a sinner
[50:51] i'm out of time
[50:56] you could come to the piano
[51:01] maybe you're a sinner
[51:04] and i have done so much sin this is
[51:05] brother branham this a step one
[51:09] maybe you smoke till you can't smoke no
[51:11] more and can't quit it maybe if you've
[51:14] drank till you can't drink no more and
[51:16] you can't quit it maybe you come to the
[51:19] place where you're so full of sin and
[51:21] lust
[51:22] that you look at any other woman and
[51:24] have to have 30 thoughts of her
[51:29] maybe you come to a place
[51:33] where you just can't take it
[51:35] there's many people today that have come
[51:37] onto the press there's a press right now
[51:41] there's a press right now
[51:43] and it's through the fourth dimension
[51:45] where the battle is going on and satan
[51:47] is sending this press down to your earth
[51:51] where it's falling upon us
[51:53] and many of us who went like this
[51:58] close the bible
[52:01] because of the press and the trials and
[52:03] tribulations that they're having in
[52:04] their family
[52:06] if anybody had a reason to quit
[52:09] it was jesus
[52:12] he had the right to quit
[52:14] he wanted a life
[52:16] he was beautiful brother brown said he
[52:18] had a choice he could have had a wife he
[52:21] could have had a family he couldn't live
[52:23] but he forfeited
[52:26] he was a normal man
[52:28] but god was in
[52:30] him to the forest he could speak
[52:34] things into existence
[52:36] crush the tree and he wouldn't bear
[52:38] fruit
[52:49] maybe if you come to a block
[52:52] or maybe you've been perverted your own
