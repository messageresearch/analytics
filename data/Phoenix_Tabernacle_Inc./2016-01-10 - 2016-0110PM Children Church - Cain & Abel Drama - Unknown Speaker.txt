that it be a blessing to you in the year 1846 a group of 89 immigrants embarked on a journey from Springfield Illinois to travel West the hope of a shorter route through California granted a promising Journey as they were traveling through the Sierra Nevada mountains they became blocked in by a heavy snowfall their bodies frozen stiff fingers and toes ridden with frostbite their stomachs shrinking and hunger they began to eat the saddle and the leather of their belts in order to survive they eventually resorted to cannibalism only 45 of the original 89 survived D our Prophet is said that when people are hungry they will eat from anywhere when people are hungry they will scr through back alley dumpsters for cold leftovers when people are hungry they will drag the rotting carcass of a cat or dog or coyote from the side of the road and pick its crushed bones clean when people are hungry they will push shove pull kill for the small smallest of crumbs and crumbs will only satisfy the soul of the spiritually starved for so long before you become all gunte eyed and Bloated belly again believe me I know before you become knees unwilling to bend in prayer believe me I know before you become feet running to cunning smiles and empty words to cold arms and even colder Hearts to bottoms of bottles and Sky Highs to acceptance from everyone but the very God who has seen your every fault and fall and fall and fall and still loves you believe me I know when people are hungry they will eat from anywhere stop searching in all the voids in all of that empty stretch out your bony fingers and remember Psalm 8110 for I the Lord am your God who brought you up from the land of Egypt open wide your mouth and I will fill it [Applause] God bless you tonight we'll continue a series of exerts sequential exerts in the series Supernatural the life of William brandham uh as it might it's been a bit of time since we did the last exert so I'll just catch you up on where we are um brother Brandon had returned back home with from the Mishawaka uh visit and he was so excited and wanted to heed the Lord's call to continue his campaign uh and start uh visiting the churches he had gotten invitations to and he listened to his mother-in-law's pleading not to do so so we're going to pick up the second half of chapter 19 a black curtain Falls a glen of sunlight flashed across Bill's life when his daughter was born on October 27th 1936 they named her Sharon Rose an inversion of the rose of cheron one of the poetic titles of Jesus Christ Sharon Rose was a beautiful baby and Bill loved her more than he loved the warm sun on a clear fall day he didn't know that Sharon's birth would be the last Ray of Happiness to touch him for many years the dark clouds began to gather in November first Bill's sister-in-law died then one of his brothers was killed 17-year-old Charles Edward Branham Jr one one Sunday night Charles hitched a ride on the running board outside of a car driven by a drunk the car sideswiped a power pole scraping Charlie off breaking his neck bill was preaching in the church at the at the time another one of his brothers brought him the news immediately Bill dismissed the service but by the time he reached the hospital his brother Charlie was already dead young Charlie's death powerfully affected Bill's father still broken in health and desperately poor Charles brandham senior reflected on his life both his past and his future one morning Bill saw him sitting on the v-neck of a plow crying Bill asked what's the matter dad you won't understand Billy but someday you will I want to see the old home place again I'm 52 years old and I haven't been back there for almost 25 years if you want to go back there Dad I'll give you the money to go for one last time Charles visited the place near burkville Kentucky where he was born when he returned to Jeffersonville he sat in a in a saloon thinking about how he had sabotaged his life with alcohol a man offered to buy him a drink feeling guilty but unable to stop himself he accepted as the light brown liquid filled the glass Charles said look fell I got a boy standing over there in a Pulpit tonight that boy's right and I'm wrong don't let this drink effect on my reflect on my boy when he bought brought the shot glass to his lips his hand shook so hard that most of the whiskey spilled on his chin the men teased him Charles broke down and cried picking up his hat he walked out 2 weeks later on November 30th 193 6 Charles brandham suffered a massive heart attack he was still alive when Bill reached his bedside Bill cradled his father's head in his arms those curly black locks were just beginning to turn gray at the temples Bill thought I helped put those gray hairs there how many heartaches have I caused him he looked at his father's hand missing a finger from a shredder accident and he thought of how hard this man had worked to rais his 10 children Bill didn't care what anyone else thought about Charles Branham this man was his father and he loved him Charles looked up into his oldest son's eyes Billy he whispered I've been wrong Daddy it's not too late to change right there by his father's deathbed Bill led him to the Lord of all life Jesus Christ within an hour Charles Branham went to meet his maker at that moment Bill saw white robed angel standing in front of him through his grief bill at least knew his father's Soul was Secure in Christ the next Misfortune began a week before Christmas when both of Bill's children came down with colds soon hoped sniffed and coughed along with them the temperature outside dropped below zero hope laid blankets at the base of the doors and towels along the window sills to cut down dri drafts it helped a little but because the home had so little insulation the kitchen stove had trouble keeping the two rooms warm in 1936 Christmas fell on a Friday the day before Christmas Hope went with a friend across the river to Louisville Kentucky to buy some last minute presents for the children Bill reported to work as usual on his noon break he opened a savings account for Sharon Rose putting in 80 cents his Christmas present for his two-month-old daughter next he dropped a Christmas present off at the office of his Boyhood buddy Sam madir who had just recently returned from medical school to open a private practice in Jeffersonville later that afternoon Bill got an urgent call while shopping in Louisville hope had fainted on the street now she was at home in bed desperately in need of his attention Bill rushed over and found Hope tightly bundled in blankets shivering uncontrollably he touched her forehead head her skin felt like it was on fire bill called Sam Adair who came right over Dr Adair slipped a thermometer under Hope's tongue putting his stethoscope against her chest he listened and frowned then he checked on the on the Mercury level oh my she's got a fever of 105° Bill this is serious she's got pneumonia you need to give her orange juice all night long make her drink at least two gallons tonight to break that f Bill Sat by Hope's bed throughout the night giving her a sip of orange juice every few minutes by Christmas morning her fever had dropped a few degrees Mrs brumbach stopped by to see her daughter and was appalled by the cool drafty room William this house is not equipped with heat enough to keep hope warm I'm going to take her to my house Bill said I'd rather ask Dr Adair if we should move her Adair I wouldn't ask him anything that boy doesn't have sense enough to come in out of the rain I'll get Dr Lawrence to look at her she left bill called Dr Adair who advised him Bill don't you move her if you take hope out in this freezing weather right now it will kill her but doctor her mother is going to do it anyhow then I'll get off the case bill I love you as a brother you know that but I can't be responsible for Hope under those conditions I'll have to turn hope over to Dr Lawrence well doc you know where my feelings are with his thoughts and turmoil Bill walked over to the church knelt and prayed Lord I love my wife please have mercy on her and heal her will you Lord Bill saw a black sheet falling in front of him like the curtain that ends a theatrical performance he gasp in horror at the vision then as he watched slate gray clouds blocked out the sun torrential rains pounded the countryside causing the Ohio River to swell until finally the dyes protecting Jeffersonville caved in flooding the lower parts of the city he saw a man come down from the sky with a ruler in his hand and a measure of water over Spring Street at 22 feet deep division troubled bill so far every Glimpse he had seen of the future had come true he shared the vision around T Town hoping that people would take notice he prepared and therefore lives could be saved those people he told either snickered chuckled or outright galed even some people in his own congregation were skeptical like elderly Jim weart who said Billy the worst flood we ever had was in 1884 and then there was only about 6 in of water over Spring Street Bill repeated division I saw a man come down from the skies take a ruler stick it there on Spring Street and say 22 ft Jim weart scoffed Oh Billy you're just excited I'm not excited it is thus saith the Lord and what is more the same God that told me there will be a flood showed me a black curtain that has come between him and me something has separated us he doesn't hear me when I pray for my wife I'm worried that she might never come out of this God bless [Applause] you amen good evening God bless you all how many are happy to be here in the house of the Lord amen there's many other places that we

you remember it honey remember it boys are you ready to hear a story yes yeah all right yay so in the beginning hey guys God created the heavens and the Earth you see every fireball out there guys you see him hanging in the sky he picked them and named them one by one you know what Earth before it was empty it was lifeless but then God created the Sun and the Moon he made everything everything he made the Roaring oceans he made the Big Trees he he carved every single Mountain but you know what God wasn't he wasn't satisfied so he handcrafted Every Little Creature from the biggest sea monster and the pterodactyl to even the tiniest creepy crawly creatures the tiniest of them but you know what God wasn't satisfied so you want to know what he did next hey Kane do you guys want to know what he did next well I'mma tell you so God he grabed some dust oo and he create he started creating a masterpiece to arm Kane oh sorry your guys' conversation was so boring I fell asleep Kane just kidding anyways so he started creating this masterpiece two arms beautiful eyes beautiful nose awesome hair oh man it was beautiful and that Masterpiece was mean but I was still dirt I was nothing until God our father he blew the breath of life into me and then I became the man D [Applause] daddy well the man was all alone and lonely until God made something that he knew was best for him is that not right honey that's right well story's not almost it's not done yet boy so God knew I was lonely he knew I was so sad I was all alone there's no one here beside me so what he did he put me into a deep sleep so he pulled he then do you know what he did next he pulled out a rib and he made the woman oh you're beautiful mom the Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone oo see how beautiful she is boys do you see that oh come on come on get a drip it was like it was yesterday boys stop it hey boys it was like it was yesterday oh I I swallow my own barf hey it was we were in Perfect Harmony oh in the Garden of Eden hey do you guys know what the lion would actually sleep with the lamb and he wouldn't want to hurt him he didn't want to eat them and also the smell all the flowers were beautiful and the smell of the flowers were like honeycomb on a rainy day take a sniff boys you know what she boy over here can use some of that flower fragments that you're talking about W kane hey I'm just saying nobody want smelly armpit in here K and there were also no quels we didn't bicker with each other the lion didn't eat the lamb don't forget that everyone got along it was such a beautiful place beautiful man I just I think about it and I wish I could go to Eden r on a bear that would be so awesome dad is this what your saying I mean um if you loved Eden so much then why did you leave it in the first place yeah well son that's um that's a good question um that's a very good question how about here come on boys let's have a seat come on let's have a seat so life was good obviously in Eden it was perfect the waterfalls the mountains and God even he even told us we could eat from any tree any plant that we wanted to but there was one tree the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and we could not eat from that tree but well well boys pretty much we we disobeyed God's word when he told us to not eat it and we did we ate of that fruit it's it's a hard story to tell children um you see the serpent was so wise and I just started listening to him and what he had to say and he told me that the fruit would make me wise and I started to listen to what the serpent had to say and didn't listen to what God had to say because that was what was going to protect me his word and I didn't believe God I believed The Serpent and I ate the fruit and everything changed and God should have killed me right in that moment and daddy didn't want another Eve cuz God could have made another Eve and he also ate the fruit and we both disobeyed God's word yeah boy so when we disobeyed God's word when we ate that fruit we felt naked we felt ashamed you know we we were scared we didn't know what to do and God you know God already knew what we had done and he became angry at us he he didn't want to talk to us he didn't want to fellowship with us but because we were we became dirty we became filthy and he he he couldn't he couldn't fellowship with us cuz if he did we would have died but he loved us so what he did he found a spotless lamb beautiful little baby lamb hadn't done anything wrong beautiful lamb white as snow he sacrificed that lamb that little lamb that perfect sacrifice so he killed the little lamb and he covered us with the skin of the Lamb so now God was able to fellowship with us now because now he didn't see us he saw the white lamb covering us beautiful lamb cuz God is Holy boys holy and we're dirty so if he came into contact with us something so holy holy holy holy we would die but he loved us so he covered us with the lamb skin and now he can fellowship with us because of that skin that spotless skin boys and that's pretty much you know that's why we got kicked out because we disobeyed God's word we need to obey his word every word boys you understand mhm got it well boy boys I think it's getting late um I think you guys need to get some sleep now okay can I get a glass of milk yes can can get glass of milk yes sheep I need sorry wait R

they need to come to the Altar and make a decision they need they need to lay down their sacrifice and honey we need to pray that Cain and Abel that they receive the correct Revelation on how to please Our Father our god look eigor oh look at K he's building an altar oh I forgot to click my invisibility button so then he can't see us now you can't see us Abel he's he's building an alar too this is a very important part of the story see brother branam explains that when these two young men were building their altar Abel had a revelation in his heart that it had to be a lamb because God used the lamb the skin of the Lamb to cover his parents in the Garden of Eden after they fell so so he brought a couple sticks and made a simple little altar cuz God hides in Simplicity remember that repeat after me God hides in in Simplicity Simplicity but k he was so hyped up about making his altar look gorgeous and beautiful look he's got all the flowers from all his hard work and all the fruits of his labor and the stones he worked really really really hard in the field he was proud of that work so he spent hours and days and weeks and months putting together his altar to make it look gorgeous as beautiful as possible the final piece to my altar woo yes oops got to put this on yes finally done I worked so hard for this it nearly took me about months and days and weeks in order to

them so Lord I hope you take my offering man can that Al looks great it must have took you a lot of work yeah I took longer than you but you only did that about 30 seconds hey at least I hope God can accept it yeah right not dear Lord I know that my parents have told me Lord that when they were in the Garden of Eden Lord they didn't want the they didn't want to obey you Lord they disobeyed your word Lord I know that you had to cover them Lord cuz they didn't look they look shameful Lord please Lord accept this lamb and its blood Lord please Lord help help this little lamb as it gives his life for you Lord thank you Lord little lamb you've been my favorite little lamb and I have to say it was great meeting you great knowing you I have to sacrifice you to God cuz he's really more important than you so I have to do this for God so please can you lay down okay just lay down just go to sleep scar just pretend Lord I do this in your honor and your [Music] name is he dead don't hurt me thank you Lord looky God the Lord accepted his sacrifice he accepted it he didn't accept K's what just happened look at that how can this be that I worked really hard for this I worked too hard I worked too long this is this is not fair this this here this here Alters [Music] unacceptable I had to do everything in order to do here so angry I feel I could smash his head [Music] open uh I mean um I'll just talk to him you guys didn't hear anything hey Abel you had a nice altar a you are dead oh see that's what jealousy can drive us to do to hurt our brother oh okay see the Bible says that God cursed him cuz he harmed his brother how many of us want to harm our brothers how many of us get jealous sometimes I mean we know James did cuz he beat you up but James isn't the only one sometimes I get jealous but I have to remember that Jesus died for me too and he died for you and nobody's perfect amen I mean I'm pretty close yeah we got it going on don't leave me hanging but we had to work hard for that I'm just kidding we're not perfect look at me I got a long way to go my hair's all messed up but look who's talking yeah there's plenty of Barbers here but they don't know how to give me the right fade they take off all my gray but anyways that's besides the point Jesus loves us and the same lamb that they sacrificed here by rep by by by Revelation for us today is the sacrifice of who the Lord Jesus Christ see we could work as hard as we want to make our sacrifice and our altars and our offering to God beautiful and precious I mean we can have a big old waterfall in the front of the church we can have golden pews and hardwood floor a and a platinum piano and just make this whole place look all beautiful and decorative and have a chandelier right here and have our pastor come in in like a big old like what's it called convertible car and just be all fancy and be like I'm the pastor God bless you and Welcome to our church but but but no we're we're simple because God doesn't require all the flowers and glitter see brother brandom says he doesn't want the flowers on your altar the best thing on the altar is you your heart put yourself on the Altar and sacrifice it to God how many are willing to to be nailed with Jesus a and be the sacrifice oh isn't that so beautiful Igor I love it I love it that we have young people that are willing to just give
