overwhelmed [Music] myself that she is my daughter I've spoken to all my kids about this first step it's very important and you know I'm overwhelmed because I know in heaven there there's a if you could say like the teenagers do they they got a party you know because because the soul decided to follow the lord as a parent that's what we want as a Christian parent so we're here and we're going to baptize H Vargas in Christian baptism just like his word says and it's a privilege for me as his father as her father to baptize her now I'm going to ask her a couple of questions for anyone who might have any doubts I will ask her did anyone tell you to get baptized no did your mother tell you you better get baptized no so you did this on your own yes amen so even though she's she's young and and 13 she's already knows what's uh good and bad so from here on she was walking as I talked to her this way and since the tugging in her heart started and that's the Lord speaking to her so now she's going to turn around and Walk This Way that that's what we have learned throughout the years so we're going to baptize her in Christian baptism so if you bow your heads and for a word of Prayer Lord Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and you Lord as our father and we are your children Here I Am Lord representing Lord that as she decided to ask her father to baptize her I'm just is doing your will Lord and Obey so I baptized during Christian baptism and I ask that you help her in her Christian walk and may she continue Lord with all the steps that need to be taken and knowing that you will be there all she has to do is ask that you come and give her what she needs until she reaches that step where she is adopted so we ask you Lord that you help her and also bless her parents Lord that wherever she may be may they continue telling her what she needs to do Lord but ultimately Lord she has to take the decision upon herself to continue in your ways we ask you to bless her in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hania Verdugo Vargas hania varas I baptized you in Christian baptism for the remission of your sins and may the Lord give you the gift of the Holy Spirit In The

years old Lord and I had to stay in that hospital for over eight months in the ICU unit never been in the hospital in my whole life prior to that and it was then that you begin to reveal to me that you were Jehovah Rafa that you were Jehovah Gyra and the years have passed Lord but I still remember those days [Music] but I look back and I know that it was you that sometimes it's in the valleys sometimes it's at the cross but it's always been you w to take us each and every one of us to that place that you have predestinated for us we thank you for that Lord we ask that you be with us this morning come that you would come and speak to us Lord that you would make your presence more real to us it's our desire Lord that you would come into our midst you would speak to us through your word the way that the prophet taught us Lord we're not the prophet but we are the product Lord we are the ones that that that the word of the Lord would be revealed to the word of the Lord didn't come to us but the Revelation did Lord we thank you for that we pray that you would make yourself present this morning bless the Brethren Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I'd like to greet you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ it's a privilege to be here this morning beautiful June summer weather normally we we would say that and kind of chuckle to ourselves but truly we've been blessed with with some good weather if you would like to turn with me to Genesis chapter 6 we're going to take our text our subject from from those series of scriptures there and it reads like this and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and the daughters and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his days shall be 120 years and I want to insert into here that in verse three brother brandham says that that's when God put in the clutch when a clutch is put in that means there's going to be a change of a gear verse four and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men they bare children of them the same became became Mighty Men which were of old men of renown and God God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and they grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and creepy thing and the creepy thing and the fowls of the air for it repented me that I made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings through the reading of the word I want to take a a a text out of those verses and I want to call it when the Sun of God saw the daughters of men verse one says that it came to pass when men began to multiply upon the face of the Earth that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were Fair there was a change something changed there this sentence is declaring to us about a specific instance when something took place when the attention of the sons of God was drawn to the daughters of of of men amen there was an a CH there was a change in their appearance and the change came the Bible says when the multiplication or the population increased in those now everyone knows that Jesus declared these things to us and we know that one of those characteristics is with us today and I think uh I think there's seven billion people on the Earth today and brother brandom tells us it's possible that they had more people back in those days so the they began to multiply rapidly but what I want to talk about today is that change that thing that that caused them that caused the sons of God to take note of the daughters of men the prophet calls calls this change Junctions in time changes in time or it can be looked at as a change of dispensation a a crossroad at these Crossroads or changes of dispensation that's when the two opposing Spirits they make themselves known here in the earth it's a time of turmoil chaos when they make themselves manifest it's at these Junctions that that takes place the changes in dispensation now I have here on on the on the PowerPoint some of the major changes in dispensation when these things took place they're very significant but this morning I want to just I just want to draw your attention to that one time in the days of Noah the sons of God looked upon the daughters of men whenever God sends his word to the Earth Satan comes and attacks the word the message tells us distinctly that that it's that it's the word that Satan attacks he wants to get us to doubt the word amen a contest is a test of strength and that's what this is these powers in these changes of dispensation in these Junctions they like to show their powers God likes to show his power and so to his sons amen the change in dispensation the change was an enemy attacked it was a front line assault when this took place when when the when when the population began to to multiply and when the sons of God noticed those Daughters of of man it was an attack an attack is an aggressive aggression a aggressive action it's something that that a special forces group or an army comes against another Army Jesus warned the church as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man so we know the prophetic words of the master that there would come a time in the future that the world order the cosmos would be similar to the days of Noah and we know that there that there is going to be a junction change a change in dispensation as it was in the days of Noah the battle of the two Spirits remember the prophet said in the message the greatest battle ever fought when Satan was kicked out of heaven and he was cast down to the Earth he he said that now that battle that started in heaven would be brought down to the Earth and that's what we're talking about and there was a change that happened there was a the time in instance in time when something came that caused these men to notice these women the two forces always meet in these changing of Junctions what's it all mean what's it coming to we know that it started in heaven but where is it going to end we've seen the different Junctions and we know that if the final showdown is going to be the battle of Armageddon but but for today I just want to focus on that change and if God willing we can get into that in another at other times I would love to get into that so that we could see where where we're headed to that's the whole prophetic Bible because God wanted a certain group of people he wanted us to know know what was going to come in the future and more importantly what was going to take place in our age so that the elect of that age so that when they would see those conditions in time when they would see their surroundings they would be able to notice or detect in the scriptures positionally where they were at and then they could place themselves and the prophetic word and then see what was coming in the future because that's what we want to know we want to know where we are positionally in a specific time all the ages that that deception has come to the Earth this present age that we live in is the most deceitful of all of them that's that's a a a tremendous thing to say but it's but it's a reality to us this the most deceptive age is the age that we live in now in the 20th at the beginning of the 20th century we know that the characteristics of the anti luian time the characteristics of the days of Noah became be began to manifest themselves in the 20th century things began began to change rapidly excuse me things began to change slowly it started it started gradually and then it became faster and faster and faster until we find ourselves in the stage that we're in right now as many ministers have said before at the beginning of the 20th century if somebody would have gave you a glimpse of what we see every day it would have shocked you the change that you would have seen from back then to now would have shocked you you know back in the day when you hear Brother brandom speaking the message in the 50s and the 60s it tells us about that that the people it was common it was common that that people would have mental breakdown a nervous breakdown they would say where is sister so and so where's brother so and so he had a nervous breakdown you don't hear that today is that right but back then you would hear that as if someone had a bad flu or something they had a a nervous breakdown they would say if I would say today how many have had a nervous breakdown [Laughter] we've had them brother yes sir we just classify them in a different uh stage now there's things that are shocking that go on today that can cause people to have a nervous breakdown but we've become so accustomed to these things become dull to them that once in a while something will shock us but it has come so gradually that we just have accustom ourselves to but he said it would be as it was in the days of Noah and this change that we that we're talking about it affected All Phases of Life the politics religion transportation technology the beautification of women all began at the beginning of the 20th century one of the key things that happened in the beginning was the Russian Max Factor he migrated to the United States he moved to Los Angeles californ in 1902 and Satan moved his headquarters from Paris France to California isn't that right all at the beginning of the 20th century so but it became be but it began to come slowly until it's just becoming so rapid that time has gone so rapidly that it appears as though someone or some mechanism is advancing the time quicker and quicker until we can't even understand it anymore one day it's Sunday the next day we find it's Friday back to Monday and and before we know it it's the time has slipped from us why time is a very important commodity today it it's important with what we do with our time how we utilize it how we manage it that's why I don't understand that people waste their time on things that are meaningless the only thing that has meaning to us today is the word of the Lord Jesus told us that heaven and earth will pass away but the word of God would not pass away it's the only thing that has substance I want to relate to you how I received this message I I think it's important to know how the Lord works with people you already know how he works with you but he deals with each one individually in the fall of 202 12 this scripture kept coming to my thinking when the sons of God saw the daughters of men and so then I began to to study it I began to ponder it and it seemed like I would understand what was what was written and then it would come again to me and this happened over months and I couldn't seem to understand why it would keep coming back to me until finally one day I was able to grasp the context now watch and listen listen the context brother brandham calls the context reading in between the lines or you could be or I've heard him say it was the algebra so it's just like he teaches us in Revelation chapter 5 now listen in Revelation chapter 5 brother Bram tells us that it's the scene the context of the opening of just it's the scene before the opening of the seven that's the algebra the context the definition is it's a circumstances that form the setting for an event a statement or an ideal so that it can be understood the scene the context in between the lines there's a context in between the lines but brother random also said when you go in between the lines you have to come back up to the line that's what many people fail to do they're good at going in between the lines they go like almost underwater and come up somewhere else but you have to come up back to the line amen amen so was the context of when the sons of God saw the daughters of man the line tells us that but there's a context there's a condition of the time that we that we that we need to understand the thing that caused that change in the Feast of the trumpets brother Brandon makes this statement he said the Bible is read between the lines to make the picture appear the context the algebra the revelation God hides his meage his message in between the lines and he reveals it to whomever he pleases that ability cannot be taught it is a spiritual instruction only given by the father isn't that right you know I wish I could just get up here and and get into that and just really get into that profoundly and show how those principles can be applied Genesis to Revelation the message teaches us that but it's not taught to everyone the Jesus said himself that that would be taught to his church correct I think we need to say that more often sometimes so so what we want to do or what I want to do this morning is make a relation a relationship between the time of Noah and what we see happening today because I believe we've had another change everyone here today knows that there has been a change isn't that right but we're not sure really what it is see that's why we have to find it in the in the road map in the blueprint in the scriptures and in the message so that we could know exactly where we're at and how we should act in this time because God wants us to know what the battle is and how to fight it you don't want to pull out a spear in this in this day when we're talking about Atomic weapons we have advanced the Warfare is at another level you can't pull out a slingshot today spiritually speaking you understand what I mean because I would take the sling of David any day but I'm talking about something else amen so we need to understand that Jesus the word is in our midst but also that the presence of the wicked one the Antichrist spirit is in our midst we need to know that and we need to know how to act when we see that how to respond how to protect ourselves and then how to combat that brother Bram teaches us in the message Shalom that the word sounds forth as music that that the word sounds forth as music from a great Symphony and the changes in the Rhythm that only the composer knows and he knows what it really means it's the composer who knows what it means the one who wrote the music he knows when the changes are coming and he likes to forewarn the orchestra when these changes are coming so that the violins can sound out not the drums not the trumpets but it's the violins that to change in the Junctions and he reveals it this Sheep music to who whoever is interested in knowing it that's what he teaches us in the message shalom shalom now when when Adam fell from eternity to time one of God's judgments was that God said I will put enity between thee and the woman between thy seed the serpent seed and her seed it was God who put the enity what does enity mean he wanted them separate not together but he put something in them that there would be a separation it was God that did that the author of the book the one who wrote the script that there would be a separation between those two seeds what a great thing that that is that that makes me Ponder when I when I think of such a thing that the author of the book the one who wrote the script plac those things in there and as one of the brothers said he created a powerful enemy and he wrote in there that there would be com ination between these two Powers but it was he the one it was God that wrote it he wrote it in the script and he knows the end from the beginning he has everything in his control Satan is not pulling anything over on God God is not worried about Satan one bit he wrote the script that's right that's right when the sons of God married those pretty Daughters of men God never forgave them for that it seems like such a simple thing especially when you go back and in each dispensation that we showed it got greater and greater and greater more deceiving more deceptive until we find ourselves in this day the purpose of the attraction was to cause an illegal Union between the daughters of Cain and the sons of Seth it was it caused a a a a degreg in humankind it degraded the human race everything that Jesus was notice this everything that Jesus was the second Adam he proved what the first first Adam was like and where he fell from the scriptures declare to us that if we look at everything that Jesus was we get a glimpse of the first Adam in Isaiah 96 it reads like this it says his name speaking of the second Adam his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace that doesn't sound like a junior God to me that's the way some people try to present Jesus today but he was the Everlasting father the Mighty God showing us what what what was the first Adam like what were the characteristics and what what caused this this downgrading of the human race now we're going to get into the great turmoil and brother brandham is going to tell us what was it that caused the sons of God to notice the daughters of men let's read it follow me notice and another thing that he did back there in the days of Noah we noticed that during that time in the change of dispensation when men began to multiply that during that time of this great turmoil when men's heart began to wax cold and away from God women became such an idol when the sons of God seen the daughters of men that they were fair and they became a sexual order look at it today what we're living in not speaking against honorable women sir no sir they're God's instrument but those who cared not for themselves there's so many on the opposite side just going about marrying and giving in marriage God said so in the Bible Jesus said before Noah's time that they would be married but he said they became a sexual order so when the women became Fair brother brandham says sexual order that they became fair and they looked because they had became a sexual order and what is sexual order the state of of the women became sexual in nature that's a change change that wasn't there was a time then that it wasn't like that but then there was an instant in time there was a change in dispensation that that happened let's keep on reading how the great turmoil in this world today realize that one thing that or and we realize the one thing that caused that now he's going to tell us what was the thing that caused the Bible said that the spirits the great spirits came down evil spirits and got into those people and then the those things so there was a instance time when those great powerful demons came down a change in dispensation the time when those two forces would meet each other on the Earth and they would make themselves manifest for a battle that started in heaven but that would end here in the earth and that was the change that was one of the first changes in a dispensation when this battle would be brought down to the Earth do you see what type of battle it was notice the the the Weaponry that they used but the objective the purpose was to get that false Union so they could so that they could degrade the sons of God and that battle is still on today we're still in the same same quote and we see the same evil spirits working in our day and and and notice not only that when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose also that's what people forget that there's two spirits and they both manifest themselves at the same time but there's two of them and sometimes we focus only on the evil spirit but at the same time the holy spirit is moving too and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against and these two forces have always showed themselves at The Junction in the end time so we're at a junction in the end time and we see the same thing we' seen that those evil spirits have came down today and they're everywhere they're in our midst I want to insert a principle at this time and the scripture teaches us that Spirits don't die men that's possessed of these evil spirits they die but the spirits don't die Jesus told the Pharisees in in John 8 verse 43 he says this you know I wish I would have been able to stand there and and watch him as he said this he said why don't you understand my speech even because you cannot hear my words I would like to say that right something like that but I would have liked to have seen his the way he said it how he maybe moved his hands maybe as he stood there maybe he pointed at them I don't know how what he did but he said why is it that you don't understand my speech today o why is is it that most people can't understand our speech because we speak another language it's a Heavenly language and not all understand and that's why they say that's why the rumor is what was he talking about I didn't understand anything that he said that would that would uh uh startle me brotheru but he said why don't you understand my speech can't you hear my words he goes you are of your father the devil my goodness I'm sorry I'm sorry for laughing I just wish I would have seen him he would said you're of your father the devil that's why you can't understand me my goodness by there was Noah in his time here's Israel in their time he's talking about the different Junctions here's Abraham at the next Junction between the the natural world and the supernatural World Angels Came Down like men now I wish I could change subjects right now and go into the stages of Abraham remember when the Angels Came Down that was just after Abraham's name was changed and he received the Seal of the of circumcision you know 1 2 3 4 5 6 down comes the seal the Angels appear you understand amen and they stood by Abraham the prophet and told him Abra Abraham God will perform the supernatural about this time next year according to the time of life watch this and apply it to the message I'll visit you your wife is 100 years old and you'll bring forth a child I'll show you my power of Divine Healing can you see the message then your wife is old but you're going to bring forth a child there will be a bride she will be transformed she will bring forth the promised child and I'm going to show you Divine Healing I'll change you and change you and Turn you back to a young man and I'll change Sarah and make her a different person I'm the miraculous theot now we're going to close with this and I knew this was going to happen but that's okay I'll show you my power Abraham we're at the junction time the evil spirits are down there in Sodom my my goodness they're working among the world down there the evil spirits they're down there in Sodom and where was Abraham he was hidden he was out by himself he had separated himself and God had given him the Seal of circumcision and he had the name changed and that's when the Angels appeared that's when the message was revealed to him that's when God showed him the algebra stand to your feet let's bow our heads and pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this time that you've given us when the sons of God saw the daughters of men at The Junction at the change in dispensation what a Time Lord but not only did those evil spirits come down but angels of God came down and likewise said Jesus so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed amen why should we fear Lord when you're the one who wrote the script and we see our part and we have been anointed to act in that part good or bad we thank you Lord for your word for what you've done for us pray that you will help us Lord throughout the week we thank you for all things in the
