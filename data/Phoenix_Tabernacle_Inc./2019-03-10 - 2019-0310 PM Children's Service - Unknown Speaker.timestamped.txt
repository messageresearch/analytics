[1:16:32] break down walls they break down walls
[1:16:35] so we have another story really quick
[1:16:38] it's about a man called Paul and this
[1:16:41] man called Paul I imagine he had a great
[1:16:43] smile cuz he broke down walls and he had
[1:16:48] this powerful earth of a story in the
[1:16:51] Bible where he's in prison and he's
[1:16:54] praying and he's praising and walls came
[1:16:59] crumbling down so we just want to
[1:17:02] dramatize this for you so simply and so
[1:17:05] quickly I'm gonna invite my prison walls
[1:17:07] to come out here and if I invited the
[1:17:10] pretty gonna go out that door we'll
[1:17:12] bring out the prison walls did we give a
[1:17:16] round of applause for our prison walls

[1:17:23] come out here you can come over here
[1:17:28] brother you can come right here and then
[1:17:30] we'll have the prisoners right there on
[1:17:31] the stairs you see this strong prison
[1:17:36] this is strong prison made out of the
[1:17:39] best styrofoam you can get at Home Depot
[1:17:42] and held up by the best supports we have
[1:17:47] for that I'll go over here and brother
[1:17:48] yeah and can we give them a round of
[1:17:50] applause they're gonna be our prison
[1:17:55] so here we have a prison and just a
[1:17:58] bunch of prisoners go ahead
[1:18:00] prisoners let's let's see we have this
[1:18:09] prison back in the Bible days and these
[1:18:12] prisoners were crying cuz cuz they were
[1:18:16] in prison they did some bad things so
[1:18:24] here they are just suffering in prison
[1:18:27] but there was a man there was a man and
[1:18:30] I'm gonna be that man his name was Saul
[1:18:33] and he was Paul his name was Saul and
[1:18:36] when he met God God changed his name to
[1:18:39] Paul and then Paul first he was beating
[1:18:43] up Christians and throwing the
[1:18:44] Christians in general but then he became
[1:18:47] a Christian and he started preaching
[1:18:49] high god bless you do you know Jesus
[1:18:50] Christ hi hi god bless you did you know
[1:18:53] there's a god he wants to live inside
[1:18:54] your heart
[1:18:55] alright god bless you come let's break
[1:18:57] some bread you can have a couple of
[1:18:59] guests ideas and I'll tell you all about
[1:19:00] Jesus so that's what Paul was doing he
[1:19:04] was out preaching and then the Romans
[1:19:08] didn't like it everybody say boo the
[1:19:11] Romans didn't like it
[1:19:13] so they got Paul and they got his bloody
[1:19:15] Silas where's my Roman guard where's the
[1:19:19] Roman guard came and he got Paul in
[1:19:21] Silas they take ATEC Angelo take it easy
[1:19:26] huh and he threw Paul and Silas in the
[1:19:31] prison
[1:19:38] we are quiet so all the other prisoners
[1:19:47] were crying right but Paul and Silas
[1:19:51] they had faith in God so Paul and Silas
[1:19:54] came and the Bible says they were
[1:19:57] praying and singing praises and this
[1:20:03] prison was unlike any other prison
[1:20:05] because they had the best piano player
[1:20:06] playing in the prison cell next door the
[1:20:12] best cattle player in Phoenix can you
[1:20:14] give her a round of applause but they
[1:20:19] know nothing about that but Paul and
[1:20:24] Silas will doubted they were prayed and
[1:20:26] these clowns were making fun of them
[1:20:38] dying of hunger prison on Mexican I was
[1:20:47] literally no ganas just now and they're
[1:20:49] trying to cross over and out here but
[1:20:53] the free brothers let me tell you why
[1:20:56] we're praying I'll tell you what we're
[1:20:58] praying because my circumstance doesn't
[1:21:00] determine my praise Emmett are you
[1:21:03] something my circumstance does not
[1:21:06] determine my praise it doesn't matter if
[1:21:10] I'm in a prison or if I'm on the beach
[1:21:13] hanging out with my friends I could be
[1:21:16] in paradise or I could be in the abyss
[1:21:19] right here in this prison I'm going to
[1:21:22] praise the Lord
[1:21:26] it's saying Silas let us sing praises
[1:21:32] you know why because
[1:21:35] when you combine your prayer with praise
[1:21:40] something happens we can pray we can
[1:21:43] pray all you want lord help me I'm such
[1:21:46] a horrible prison I'm in this condition
[1:21:48] I'm in that condition lord help my
[1:21:52] sister Lord she's a cheese emulsify on
[1:21:54] the weekend we can pray all kinds of
[1:21:57] stuff lord help my brother Lord because
[1:22:00] he always talks bad about me we can pray
[1:22:02] all kinds of stuff but is that kind of
[1:22:05] prayer the prayers that a Christian
[1:22:07] should pray no a pray if you can't pray
[1:22:12] giving praise out of your lips then we
[1:22:15] gotta go back to practice praying so
[1:22:17] we're gonna pray a prayer and we're
[1:22:19] gonna praise God at the same time
[1:22:21] because he already freed us so that's
[1:22:24] why we're praying just in case you
[1:22:27] didn't know but where is this God I
[1:22:29] don't even see him oh you're gonna fill
[1:22:32] him and you're gonna see him because
[1:22:34] he's real he lives within me he is with
[1:22:38] us even in us until the end of the world
[1:22:41] also we're gonna praise we're gonna
[1:22:43] praise coming let's praise Him
[1:22:45] let's praising amen you
[1:22:51] Oh his name is called and then the angel
[1:22:58] started singing can you be the Angels
[1:23:00] for us
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:04] they're just crazy that we don't care
[1:23:06] the word a prison he's gone with Revere
[1:23:17] in
[1:23:21] revealing us even in this prison Lord
[1:23:24] his name is Paul
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:32] man
[1:23:34] you Oh silence I'm so excited I can feel
[1:23:40] the Spirit of the Lord
[1:23:42] let's keep singing my brother Oh amen
[1:23:47] you
[1:23:49] Oh can you see with us
[1:23:57] whoa his name is called
[1:24:03] this ball
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:06] man you were a man
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:12] Oh
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:27] Oh
[1:24:35] Oh Emanuele
[1:24:42] and as Pauline Cyrus Silas were there
[1:24:46] praising God the Bible says the walls
[1:24:49] started to shake and tremble until they
[1:24:55] came down and all the doors just flung
[1:24:58] open from the prison what I don't
[1:25:03] believe this what what is what's going
[1:25:06] on and I have moments the prison guard
[1:25:13] was fearful because he thought oh my
[1:25:16] bosses don't kill me
[1:25:18] Oh so he went to go take the sword and
[1:25:28] Paul said no don't hurt yourself
[1:25:32] we're all here we haven't left but this
[1:25:36] was done so that you can see that there
[1:25:38] is a living God and the Roman soldier he
[1:25:47] came and he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:25:50] and him and all his family believed in
[1:25:56] God and that's what we're called to do
[1:26:00] today we're called to take our little
[1:26:03] prayers and our praise and combined them
[1:26:07] so that no matter where you are no
[1:26:09] matter what prison you find in front of
[1:26:11] you no matter what bully is there or
[1:26:14] what thing that you've faced or what
[1:26:17] nightmares it might be if you're afraid
[1:26:19] of dark anything that you struggle with
[1:26:21] if you're sick you just call me you
[1:26:25] bring your praise and you bring your
[1:26:27] prayer and those walls will crumble down
[1:26:30] and anyone that sees you will come and
[1:26:34] believe in a Living God just because of
[1:26:37] your praise and your attitude how many
[1:26:40] want to have that kind of attitude this
[1:26:42] evening or can you give the Lord a head
[1:26:45] of praise can we praise the Lord
[1:26:49] and can we give them a round of applause
[1:26:52] please
[1:26:53] and can you lift your voice one more
[1:26:55] time as we see Immanuel Immanuel can you
