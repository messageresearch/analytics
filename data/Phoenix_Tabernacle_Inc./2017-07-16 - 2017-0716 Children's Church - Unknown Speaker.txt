scripture he was telling me a very interesting story yes as a matter of fact today I was reading my Bible and I came across a very very interesting story I was reading about a valley of Bones really what tell me more I want to know about more about that well there was a valley of dry bones that there was a very special man he was a man of God have anybody heard a story for I will I don't know yeah my best friend you're already not a story right who was a special man November yes yes that's right so we're gonna be reading from The Book of Ezekiel chapter 37 verse 3 yes glory do you have it are you ready yes all right so it means like this and I love this story this is my favorite story so far and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answer oh no God thou knowest and I can't he said unto me prophesy unto this bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto his bones behold I will cast bread to enter unto you and ye shall live and I shall be serious upon you and I will bring upon flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord it is such a

that I tell you how the song came would that be okay so I had a dream brother Ernie I had a dream that I was walking into church and brother Beto prometo a song leading and while he was thinking I thought oh he's thinking one of my songs and a voice came to me and said you haven't written this song yet and I thought how do i how does he know a song that I haven't written yet and the voice said listen and write it down so I woke up singing this song and I wanted to share it with you would that be okay and we want to sing it together so we can make it a congregational song the song is called the rock and if we can get the words up it would be awesome [Music] so this song ties in perfectly with the scripture that our puppet friend read today talking about the valley of dry bones so this song is written from the perspective of one of the pile of bones that was down in the valley okay so here's the song it goes like this it goes when I was down in the dark the Sun rose high and it

us from the supernatural life of brother Brandon would you please make him feel welcome amen god bless you brother Bernie the third and I think we've been we can all testify that we were a witness to those tremendous specials we will remember that there not many of us here but we heard something that the Lord shared with our brother and that's always special tonight we will continue our series of sequential excerpts from the series of books called supernatural the life of William Branham we're in book 2 the young man in this desperation 1933 to 1946 written by our precious brother Owen Jorgensen we are in chapter 13 we're starting the final chapter of book 2 as we know we're in the year 1946 and if you remember from the last reading brother Branham had been visited by an angel in the cave angel the Lord he was testifying to that very experience at a church service at the Brenham tabernacle and there were quite a few people there that night and after his testimony there may have been some that may not have believed what he shared with them but we know that was one believer his name was Charlie McDowell he was a welder by profession he had had a welding accident where his eyes had been flashed my welding gun and brother Brandon had prayed for him prior to that after that experience the doctors had told him it would take eight to ten days for his eyes to return to normal but he was actually healed the day after brother Benton pray for him by the Lord and we're so thankful for that he also had a wife that was very sick her her name was Maggie McDowell and she had been diagnosed by the actors with cancer and she had been given virtually no hope to survive it well Charlie learned from his experience that you trust in the Lord in all things he came to brother Brendan and asked him to pray for her and brother Brennan prayed for her and she had been arrested nurse for twenty-one years the cancer had gotten so bad that they said from her midsection down her body was ravaged with it she was in the hospital and she was able to go home I do believe in just about a week or so after that after brother Brendan prayed for is the Lord healed her miraculously she returned to work and worked quite a few more years and then retired so based on those events 19:46 had even more in store for brother Branham as we see this was a fundamental step in his ministry it was going from a local ministry to a regional and international ministry and and eventually international and it did it in a very short period of time we're at the threshold of that and tonight we're gonna read the first little more than a third of chapter 30 prisoners set free news of Margie Morgan's healing followed the grapevine from friend to neighbor twisting and winding in its own mysterious way until it crossed the Mississippi River soon william branham received a telegram from st. louis missouri reverend robert dougherty wanted bill to come pray for his daughter Betty who suffer from an unknown illness recognizing the hand of the Lord in this bill told his church and he would go as soon as he could save up enough money for the journey his congregation also felt this was the will of God pooling their resources they immediately collected the eleven dollars needed to buy the round-trip train ticket bill borrowed a suit of clothes from one of his brothers and took a night train bound for Missouri when the train pulled in the st. Louis the next morning Robert Dougherty was waiting at the station he looked weary brother branham have you heard anything from the Lord no brother Dougherty how's your little girl his shoulders sagged and his voice sounded flat with the junction she's real bad come on I'll take you to see her on the way home he explained my daughter has been suffering with this for three months the doctors are stumped her constant shaking makes him think it could be Saint Vitus dance but she has other symptoms that don't fit that diagnosis nothing that doctors have tried has helped I prayed and prayed for her my family has prayed my congregation has prayed and other ministers in the city have fasted and prayed for her but she's still no better reaching their home bill met mrs. dougherty she looked wilted the edges of her eyes and the corners of her mouth drooped week after week this mother had sat by the bedside of her sick daughter as her little curly-headed betty dougherty she was suffering incessantly she looks so pitiful her lower lip was swollen in bright red from bleeding where she had chewed on it in her pain she tossed constantly back and forth on her bedsheets the poor child had whined and screamed so much that she didn't have any voice left yet she still tried to cry kneeling beside the bed bill took the girl's right hand in his own left it surprised them that they were no vibrations the angel had said he would feel the disease in his left hand and that was exactly what happened with Margie Morgan why couldn't he feel it here then bill remembered the angel said he would only feel vibrations in his hand if the affliction came from a demonic life such as a germ that man Betty Doherty did not have a disease what then was afflicting her bill prayed for the suffering girl with no immediate results not knowing what else to do bill suggested that he and Reverend Doherty go down to his church to continue their appeal to God there in the quiet sanctuary these two men labored in prayer for three hours entreating Almighty God to have mercy on Betty Doherty before they stopped bill prayed Heavenly Father if you will let that poor girl get well I promise you I will move out into the ministry the you have called me too I promise you again that I will continue on the field as long as you provide my needs because I don't ever want to beg two people for money when they returned to the house Betty Dougherty was unchanged bill sat on a living-room couch praying quietly people were coming and going constantly after several hours bill went outside to stretch his legs continuing to pray while he walked block after block grandfather Dougherty met him on the porch when he returned asking has the Lord showed you anything yet brother Branham sadly bill replied not yet he went back inside and sat down on the couch as he looked out of the window the room changed he saw the girls Ben saw people gathered around it saw himself doing something to the child what was it before he could tell the vision abruptly vanished and he found himself back in the living room sitting on the couch then bill realized what had happened the grandfather had come back into the house ending the vision too soon the grandfather asked can I get you anything brother branham no thanks bill stood and went to the front door excuse me but I need to be alone for a while he walked outside in satin Robert Daugherty's car asking God to let the vision return soon his ears caught the rhythmic whipping sound of a whirlwind looking up he saw the same pillar of fire that had pulsed above the angel in the cave now it was spinning around a few feet above the hood of the car the vision came in a rush bill saw a little girl outside the dirty house playing on a sloping cellar door saw her jumping up and down on the highest part of the door saw her slip and land in an awkward heap then bill saw her trouble and saw what he must do to help her flinging open the car door he strode up the driveway and into the house brother dougherty have you got confidence in me as God's servant yes brother branham I have thus sayeth the Lord for your daughter but you must do exactly what I tell you to do first I want everybody out of the house except the family after the numerous friends had left bill said to the mother sister Daugherty two days ago you bought a white bucket and put it under the sink in your pantry you have not yet put water in it brother branham that's true how did you know go get it fill it with water and bring in here along with a white cloth when she returned bill knelt by the child's bed and said I want the grandfather to kneel on one side of me and the father to kneel on the other as I repeat the Lord's Prayer I want the mother to wet that cloth wring it out and wipe it across the child's face then across her hands then across her feet just as I finished bill bowed his head and began our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven as soon as he finished the model prayer he said with authority thus saith the Lord Betty Dougherty will be healed she fell off the cellar door and knocked a bone out of place in her back push that bone back in place and she will get well Robert Dougherty turned his daughter over her stomach and fell along to curvature her spine sure enough one vertebra bulged excessively with strong hands he gave a quick firm push on that spot and the vertebra slipped back into place immediately Betty stop moaning and thrashing soon she was sitting up in bed smiling later that day bill and Betty walked down to the local soda fountain and shared a malted milkshake several weeks later bill was sitting on his front porch late in the afternoon when the Dougherty family drove up Betty jumped out of the car first her blonde curls bounced as she ran up to Bill and gave him a hug Robert Dougherty sat down on the porch and asked bill if he would consider returning to st. Louis for a weekend for a week-long healing revival bill did not have to spend very long considering the offer he thought about the vision he had seen in March where he was standing in the West dispensing a great mountain of the bread of life st. Louis was west of Jeffersonville perhaps this revival would for build that vision but even if it wasn't bill felt he must now keep his promise to God and move out full-time into his new ministry god bless god bless you once again we want to thank the Garcia family for that beautiful special the Garcia boys where I think brother Holly for the reading it was very very helpful very beautiful for

helping to be able to portray a little small drama and hopefully you enjoy it we hope that the Holy Spirit anoints it and that we are all touched this evening amen amen now the scripture scripture goes at like this now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus feet and heard his word but Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said O Lord does thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me and jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary had chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her well we just read the word so we're gonna pray okay Lord Heavenly Father we love you Lord Jesus we read your word Lord Jesus we've songs sung some beautiful songs to you Lord and in a worshipping you Lord father and spirit we've heard some beautiful specials and we've heard a little bit of the life story of your of our prophet that you sent to us in this last days Lord Father by brother Holly and we're - we're at this part now Lord Jesus we pray that you would anoint your word Lord Jesus annoying these scriptures or father annoying thei that drama actors that are gonna be here helping our Father on this scene or father so that each one of us will be able to leave with a little message in our heart Lord Jesus maybe you Lord father that touches us and the name of the Lord Jesus crying at Christ we pray amen amen you may take your seats so well we have in a couple of helpers here on who's Martha okay hi Martha how are you doing and I'm a believer I'm believing this is Mary right here okay and this is Jesus okay we know we know who are actors and our actresses and actors are although it's a it this really happened in the Bible you know we we just read what happened and it's a it's a beautiful story as I was reading this with my children the other day my wife brought it to our attention it was a very interesting story something that I probably had passed up many times in the Bible but it had a very good point to it and we're here to share with you this evening and so many may the Lord which he blesses for that you know did you know that in real life sometimes our our conversations that in the in the Bible some there were some people who actually had the opportunity to have real life conversations with Jesus and those people were really really blessed not everybody was able to have Jesus over for lunch or dinner or or anything like that um we know also of another story where Jesus wasn't invited by Simon I believe the Pharisee he went over to their house and we know that Jesus didn't get treated he didn't get treated very well over there well here's another story of how there was a lady by the name of Martha and she was doing all her best to try to treat her guests and the best way possible Martha I'm assuming was was you know getting the frijoles ready and and maybe cooking up something really really good and maybe she was getting some some glasses ready for water or or cleaning up and she just wanted to have the place look really really good for for Jesus you know and so she was doing really good things you know so as as we in this situation she was a privileged person her and Mary to be able to have Jesus come over to their house and visit them and so as when Jesus came to visit Mary and Martha she started doing her chores and she started getting things ready and she was cooking food and and because Jesus was the guest of their house and there were so much to do all the while one of the sisters Mary was doing nothing she was just sitting there quietly and I would imagine that after a little while you know Martha noticed this and and it started to get to her and she just was it was her inside her thoughts you know it she started to think about how she was taught as a young child you know I had her memory started to kick in my mom taught me that you need to be busy and that's a good thing you know you know that as women we were supposed to do clean and cook and this and that and and those are good things but she probably had all kinds of thoughts going on in her mind and as she saw her sister doing nothing she probably took a good look at her and scratched her head and said what is she doing does she not know who's here I mean this is the son of the Living God Jesus Christ he's our guest of honor at her home and here goes Mary doing nothing so as she started thinking these things in her mind that there were so much things to do and that Mary was just sitting there she couldn't believe it so after a while Mary Martha just had enough she just started complaining to Jesus about the unfairness and I would imagine that she maybe says something like this hello Jesus I'm cleaning and I'm doing all the work around here you know as she grabbed and she complained to Jesus but my sister Mary over here she's just being lazy and although Martha was doing good things she didn't get the answer that she expected you know Martha thought Jesus was going to correct her and and and tell Mary Mary now you're marked your sister Martha is doing a very good thing she's cooking and cleaning and and yeah I believe you should help her out I'm Jesus I know what's good you know I saw Martha thought I know what Jesus gonna say something I heard but then she didn't receive that answer that she was expecting no she thought that Jesus was going to correct her and tell her to get to work instead Jesus corrected of Martha and gently he helped her see that even though taking care of guests was a good thing he wanted her to be like Mary he wanted her to be a pain attention to him he wanted to be for Martha to be paying attention to Jesus that's all Mary was trying to do she probably had a million things going in her mind like man I should be helping but but we had this tremendous guest here and Jesus and I just want to see he's gonna say something or or do something or or maybe tell me something that's gonna change my life and and as Mary was thinking as she just couldn't help but just stay still and and meanwhile that was just she was cleaning and and cooking and doing all these good things but what Jesus wanted to Martha to know was that she just wanted her to just pay attention like like Mary so that is a very strange theme you know we can as human beings we can be doing good things you know doing lots of things but Jesus has different things on his mind you know it can be easy to get caught up in complaining about others and our prayers but Jesus is more concerned with what is in our hearts amen you may not be right or know best but it's okay to vent your frustrations to God you know that's a good thing but expect Jesus to tell you what you're missing and this is what happened to to Martha she was expecting a different answer she thought doing good things you know having good works and and getting involved and and and and and being here and being there and and just you know her works her actions she thought it was a good thing but sometimes Jesus just wants you to just settle down and realize that the guest of honor is in your presence and that he just wants your attention I'm sorry that I'm not able to be a great storyteller and I hope the kids are understanding this but to me this is a tremendous thing I know as a son I have a father and I remember and you can have a seat for the Bernie and thank you sister sister joy thank your brother Oscar I my father taught me to work a lot that's what my father well one of the things that he taught me and I really used to like to work I was there all the time and not realizing that there's some important things that Jesus wants us to be taking care of sometimes those things are at home with your family sometimes it's could be spending more time with brothers and sisters and and fellowshipping and and being part of the congregation as a real active member someone who who really engages and someone who participates in but sometimes we get really caught up in our work and but Jesus wants us to pay attention you know there are different things that we can suffer by you know our memory our reasoning our conscience our imagination our affections and we can let those take control of our daily lives sometimes we don't understand that we have to put those things to the side and focus to what's really needed and what what Jesus really wants from us you know to pay attention to what's going on you know sometimes as Christians as sons and daughters of God we can get hit and may be pushed around maybe even slapped around or whatnot by fellow members brothers or sisters and it just knocks us out of noxus out of in spanish is no soccer the key CEO you know it just takes us out of who we really are you know maybe we lose a loved one or maybe a loved one hurt us or something you know maybe a friend or something but in those moments Jesus wants us to focus on what really the bigger picture is you know in times like that if the love of God cannot be portrayed in our everyday lives and our everyday actions we can be slaves and enslaved to things that come to our memories things that come to our reasoning things that come to our conscience things that come into our imagination things that come in our affection we can become slaves to think things like that you know and that moment that Martha was cleaning and cooking and who knows what she was thinking but her actions showed what she was thinking in their mind her actions just proved that that's what she wanted to do she thought that was the correct thing to do for Jesus but really it as we see here in the word as we just read here that Jesus wanted something just a little bit more in reality he wanted a little less less of us doing something less of us trying to be someone less of us trying to prove that we're someone or that we can do something but to just be still and know that He is God you know there's a beautiful story that brother Branham talks about it just so happens to be the great-great great-grandfather of Sam here and Dante they had a great grandfather great-great great-grandfather and his name was Sam Bo I don't know if anyone's ever heard of the story before but back in the days when they had slavery there was this man by the name of and he worked on the plantation and on this plantation he would pick cotton every single day and there was many other workers that were there on the plantation and every once in a while they would get together as slaves and they would have a little Bible studying maybe sing some songs to try to pass the time because slavery is hard whether you're a slave to the master of the seat or whether you're a slave to Christ slavery is hard and as this man was partaking and one of these services I'm assuming that the Holy Spirit came down one time and it came not just upon his flesh it went through that body with these five senses of the hearing and scene and the feeling and the touching and the tasting it went past that it went deeper than that even further than the next area of what we called a triangle beam it went past the memories and it went past the imagination and their consciousness and the affections and the reasoning it went past that dimension and it reached his soul and when the Holy Spirit came and entered into his soul their faith was born in his heart he became a new man and assemble there on the plantation as a slave with all the other slave members around him he must have screamed out I'm free the Lord Jesus has made me free and I'm sure one of his fellow slave brothers or sisters might have said Shh don't say that too loud the slave owner might hear you but brother I'm free you don't know how I used to be before you don't know what kind of a man I was before today I'm free because the King of Kings the Prince of Peace has made me a free man and as the days went by that's all that he could say I'm free I'm free at last thank God I am free at last well rumor had it that it starts spreading around until it finally got to the slave owner and the slave owner I had heard this rumor he said that can't be true [Music] cannot be saying those things he knows that he's a slave and that I've been a good slave owner to him I must call him up and call to his attention attention in and to bring him in and talk to him so he probably called into his office or his house his room and started conversating with him and said sambal you know that I know that you're a good man he must have said yes master yes well the rumor is is that you've been telling everybody here and everybody knows it now because it's finally gotten to me that you're a free man you know you're a slave yes a master I I'm never gonna leave here oh I'll work for you always but the truth is master I am a free man because Jesus has made me free what I once was I am NOT now because Jesus has made me free so he must have asked him again assemble assemble you can't possibly believe that Oh master but it's true I'm sorry I don't mean to disrespect you but I am a free man because Jesus has said me free he said sample do you really believe that he said yes master he goes okay here you go and he gave him his freedom papers and as he walked away from the office or that house for that room he walked away not only a free man in this heart but legally on paper he was now a free man well that brother went on to be a preacher and he saved many souls in that village why black brown whoever wanted some saving he was there to preach to them you know sometimes as Christians hard-working Christians brothers and sisters in his gospel we can be slaves sometimes slaves to the thoughts and the imaginations to what we really believe in what we think in our heart is the right thing to do but when the Lord Jesus Christ comes into your heart not just over your body to where you and I see this as a living testimonial to where we just come to church and slave to those types of actions to where we maybe play the drums like the way I used to play and just show up to church or maybe song lead or or to go here and to go there but not really having that true experience in the heart because that's what Jesus wants he wants us to be able to take off those shackles those shackles of slavery to our imaginations to our senses of the body our senses of the spirits and he wants to go into the deepness of our hearts to wear a real change comes into where we become slaves of love so then when a brother comes and maybe he scolds you he says brother you know this and this should be this and that's the Bible says so and in your heart you say thank you brother and I love you thank you sister I love you it's very hard sometimes to look at the big picture as Mary did but if we can just be still and know that He is God and that he just wants to have domain of all our senses physically mentally spiritually to where he dwells in her heart would you stand with me please I hope this wasn't too serious of a topic and the Lord knows all things but as we close our eyes and we pray to the Lord if there's anyone here child adult uncle auntie brother sister grandpa or grandma that would ask that the Lord would come and make them a love slave slave to their word that you would raise up your hand and say Lord I accept you Lord Jesus I've been enslaved too long to the things of the world Lord Father the master of the seat has been a good adversary and he's lied to me long enough but I want to cry out in my heart I'm free I'm
