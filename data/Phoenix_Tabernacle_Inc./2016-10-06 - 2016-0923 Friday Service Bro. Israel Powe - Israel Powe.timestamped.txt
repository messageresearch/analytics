[44:54] promise but the Lord Jesus made the
[44:58] promise he said he would be with you all
[45:01] the way to the end and when We Gather in
[45:04] his
[45:05] name he said he would be
[45:07] there and so we want to uh bow our head
[45:11] for a word of prayer just for a
[45:15] moment and invite him to go deeper into
[45:19] our service
[45:23] tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father
[45:27] Just Want to Thank You
[45:29] Lord because your love never
[45:33] fails it is the reason that we're here
[45:37] tonight is because you loved
[45:39] us and your love constrained
[45:43] you to die for our
[45:47] sins and you made a way Lord
[45:50] Jesus for us to be here
[45:53] tonight speak to our hearts
[45:56] speak to the young and
[45:59] old every home that's
[46:02] here speak
[46:04] Lord touch their hearts we
[46:07] pray we commit this service into your
[46:11] hands we commit our tired bodies into
[46:14] your
[46:17] hands we commit all of our faults and
[46:19] our failures into your
[46:24] hands it's in your hands
[46:26] Lord whatever you want to do
[46:30] tonight may you have your
[46:33] way and we commit ourselves to
[46:37] you in Jesus
[46:39] name amen amen God bless you I'd like
[46:43] you to stand for the reading of God's
[46:47] word in Hebrews chapter
[46:54] 3
[46:57] and we don't want to hold you
[47:00] long um we we'll probably take about 59
[47:06] minutes all
[47:09] right Hebrews chapter
[47:12] 3 and verse
[47:14] one wherefore holy Brethren partakers of
[47:17] the Heavenly calling consider the
[47:19] Apostle and high priest of our
[47:23] profession Christ Jesus
[47:33] now he's the high
[47:35] priest of our
[47:37] profession and that word profession
[47:41] means a
[47:45] confession the profession and the
[47:50] confession um one more scripture in
[47:52] Romans uh chapter
[47:54] 10
[47:57] R and verse number
[48:02] eight and I like to say I like to say
[48:05] this to the young
[48:08] people and any
[48:12] saint I believe you should bring your
[48:14] Bible to every
[48:18] service and a piece of paper and maybe a
[48:23] pencil because maybe
[48:26] just
[48:27] maybe the Lord might speak to
[48:31] you and you need to write that
[48:34] down and then you can take that
[48:36] home and read it
[48:38] again and I believe that's
[48:41] important so that's that's my little
[48:44] encouragement for all of you young
[48:46] people that didn't bring your Bible
[48:50] tonight I'll say it like this shame
[48:52] shame
[48:54] shame
[48:56] okay but next
[48:57] time bring your Bible bring a little
[49:02] notepad and write the dates
[49:04] down and what the Lord shared with
[49:09] you because you might need that later on
[49:11] in your life later this
[49:14] week is that all right in Romans chapter
[49:20] 10 and verse
[49:23] number8 but what sayith that the word is
[49:26] nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy
[49:29] heart that is the word of faith which we
[49:40] preach that if Thou shalt confess with
[49:43] thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall
[49:45] Believe in thy heart that God hath
[49:47] raised him from the dead thou sht be
[49:54] saved
[49:59] for with the heart man believeth unto
[50:01] righteousness and with the mouth
[50:03] confession is made unto
[50:10] salvation and for our final scripture in
[50:13] Mark
[50:16] 11 verse
[50:18] 22 and
[50:21] 23 Jesus
[50:24] said have faith
[50:26] God
[50:27] the amen this is Mark
[50:31] 11 verse
[50:33] 23 for verily I say unto you that
[50:36] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[50:38] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[50:42] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[50:46] but shall believe that those things
[50:49] which he saith shall come to pass he
[50:53] shall have whatsoever he saith
[51:08] dear Lord
[51:09] Jesus bless your word
[51:12] tonight bless your
[51:14] people in Jesus
[51:16] name amen amen I bless you you may be
[51:20] seated now for a title
[51:23] tonight the title of the message
[51:27] here is spoken
[51:30] words that defeat
[51:33] Satan spoken words that defeat
[51:38] Satan now the songs that we
[51:42] sing um the prayers that we
[51:46] pray they are just mere
[51:50] words but it's with the
[51:53] words that come out of our our
[51:56] mouth that is very very important to
[52:01] God and the devil will fool
[52:05] you and make you
[52:07] believe that anything coming out of your
[52:11] mouth you won't have to give an account
[52:14] for
[52:15] it but that's not
[52:17] true the Bible says we will give an
[52:21] account for every word
[52:24] spoken this is why this is
[52:28] why uh we don't joke and joke all the
[52:33] time the Bible warns us of
[52:36] that the Bible is always trying to
[52:39] encourage
[52:41] us to keep our words
[52:44] pure because our words mean
[52:48] something we want to go into this just a
[52:50] little
[52:51] bit to help you if the Lord be
[52:56] willing to to take the words of
[53:00] God that will defeat
[53:03] Satan now first
[53:06] off we want to say this
[53:08] here that a True
[53:11] Believer if he's standing behind the
[53:16] word head to
[53:18] head in a match against
[53:22] Satan Satan cannot touch the
[53:27] believer I don't care how powerful he
[53:30] is and all the Demonic forces that he
[53:34] has the weakest of
[53:37] Christians can defeat
[53:40] Satan
[53:42] anywhere any place any time under any
[53:48] circumstance and and you got to know
[53:51] that you have to believe that in your
[53:54] heart that head-to-head in a
[53:57] battle a True
[54:00] Believer will defeat Satan every
[54:04] time but how do we defeat
[54:07] him we defeat him by staying with our
[54:11] original
[54:14] artillery
[54:16] now now uh I will not
[54:20] say that we have more power than
[54:23] Satan in our Own
[54:26] Strength I cannot say that we know more
[54:30] than
[54:31] Satan and our own
[54:33] intellect but if we stay with God's
[54:37] word and stay behind his
[54:40] word Satan cannot win
[54:43] us he cannot win now this uh spoken
[54:49] word that defeats
[54:52] Satan many times at the at the end of
[54:55] brother bram's
[54:57] meeting I have a few prayers here that
[55:00] I'm going to read for
[55:02] you that that at the end of the
[55:05] meeting he he tells the
[55:08] people to repeat after
[55:11] him to repeat this prayer after
[55:14] me so it's not just brother brandom
[55:17] praying for
[55:19] me but you got to pray for
[55:23] yourself so the words have to come out
[55:26] of your
[55:28] mouth and we don't defeat the
[55:32] Devil by thinking good
[55:35] thoughts that's not the only way to
[55:37] defeat
[55:38] him it starts with good thoughts but we
[55:42] we don't defeat him by our good
[55:45] thoughts and we don't defeat the
[55:48] Devil by getting mad at him he don't
[55:52] care how mad you
[55:54] get
[55:55] he doesn't care that he uh that that he
[55:58] didn't play by the
[56:00] rules it doesn't matter to him you can
[56:03] cry you can get mad stop your
[56:08] feet and say it's not
[56:10] fair we don't defeat the the devil that
[56:14] way but there is a way to defeat
[56:17] him and God put it so plain in his
[56:22] word now as a believer the word of God
[56:27] is our weapon it is our
[56:30] strength it has to be consumed by the
[56:34] believer so we hear the word of
[56:38] God it comes in through our
[56:41] ears down into our
[56:43] spirit and then from our
[56:46] heart to our mind we meditate on the
[56:49] word of the Lord and we place that word
[56:52] down in our hearts and and as the word
[56:56] is taken
[56:58] in we we read it we hear it it comes
[57:03] into our
[57:04] spirit and we still have to do something
[57:07] to defeat the
[57:11] Devil just hearing it is not
[57:14] enough you hear it
[57:17] yes you read it yes but now to defeat
[57:22] him you've got to take the word that's
[57:24] in your
[57:26] heart in your mind that comes from the
[57:30] Bible then speak it
[57:33] out speak it and when you speak it
[57:38] believe what you said in your
[57:40] heart and you will have what you
[57:44] ask praise the
[57:46] lord it's got to
[57:49] work it has to work it's the only thing
[57:52] that will defeat Satan
[57:55] by the written word of
[57:57] God now brother brandom tells
[58:00] us that the Lord when he met
[58:04] Satan Matthew chapter
[58:06] 4 in The
[58:09] Temptations and Jesus defeated
[58:13] Satan with just taking the spoken
[58:16] word and brother random said he had many
[58:20] fine
[58:23] gifts that he could used on
[58:26] Satan but he didn't use any of his fine
[58:31] gifts he took the word he went into
[58:34] Deuteronomy
[58:36] 6 he took the words of
[58:39] Moses he said it's
[58:41] written and then Satan said well it's
[58:44] written
[58:45] also Jesus said it's
[58:48] written it's
[58:50] written and with the pure word of God
[58:55] spoken from his
[58:57] mouth he didn't use a supernatural
[59:00] power he didn't zap lightning upon his
[59:05] head he didn't turn him upside down and
[59:07] Shake
[59:08] him he just said it's
[59:11] written written it's written and he
[59:14] defeated Sat by Amen brother brandom
[59:18] said what Jesus was
[59:20] doing he was
[59:23] showing Jesus was
[59:25] showing us that the weakest
[59:29] Christian can defeat
[59:32] Satan with just the spoken
[59:35] word can you say
[59:37] amen amen amen yes sir now let's go a
[59:40] little bit further
[59:41] here all right let me read a quote for
[59:44] you here here the prophet of God says
[59:47] this
[59:48] here and the message Ministry
[59:53] explained he says when he met
[59:57] Satan or Satan met
[59:59] him he did not use any of his fine
[1:00:04] gifts which I believe that in him dwelt
[1:00:07] all the powers of
[1:00:12] heaven was in him but he never used any
[1:00:15] of them to defeat the
[1:00:19] enemy see when he met
[1:00:22] Satan Satan tempted
[1:00:25] him he said it's written man shall not
[1:00:28] live by bread
[1:00:30] alone then upon The Pinacle the
[1:00:34] temple he met him again with the
[1:00:37] word okay brother bam continues
[1:00:40] on and the message my
[1:00:43] angel shall go before thee he says this
[1:00:47] here he never used any of those
[1:00:52] gifts just to be your
[1:00:56] example he brought it to where the very
[1:00:59] weakest
[1:01:02] Christian now he had the
[1:01:06] power right then to rebuke
[1:01:10] Satan and send him
[1:01:12] away but what he
[1:01:14] did he never referred to any of his
[1:01:19] power he said if thou be the Son of
[1:01:22] God see Jesus said it's
[1:01:26] written it's the father's
[1:01:29] word so Jesus did that he had all the
[1:01:33] gifts in
[1:01:34] him all of Heaven dwelt in
[1:01:38] him and when he met Satan face the
[1:01:41] face he didn't use any
[1:01:45] power any Supernatural
[1:01:48] power and sometimes we
[1:01:52] think we need somebody
[1:01:55] to have a vision of us or interpret a
[1:01:58] dream to me or Lord let me see an
[1:02:02] angel or send me a
[1:02:04] visitation but Jesus didn't use any of
[1:02:07] that now we appreciate the
[1:02:10] gift we appreciate the
[1:02:13] visitation we appreciate the
[1:02:16] anointing but when he met
[1:02:19] Satan for your
[1:02:22] example for the weakest
[1:02:25] Christian he simply took the word and he
[1:02:28] said it's written it's written it's
[1:02:33] written that's right praise the Lord
[1:02:36] amen praise the Lord how many's ever
[1:02:40] been in a battle with
[1:02:44] Satan yes sir just half of
[1:02:47] you if you're a
[1:02:49] Christian I'm in a battle right
[1:02:52] now I going tell you the truth right now
[1:02:56] this is the nicest it'll ever get for
[1:03:00] us come on church say Amen we get to
[1:03:03] hear the
[1:03:04] singing we get to sit next to people we
[1:03:08] trust we don't have to worry about
[1:03:09] nobody still in our
[1:03:12] purse we can we can just relax we can
[1:03:15] even go to sleep in
[1:03:17] church we get so
[1:03:20] comfortable and this is the best that it
[1:03:22] can get for us we can sing praises to
[1:03:26] Him the anointing comes down we can say
[1:03:30] Amen to his
[1:03:32] word thank God for setting me
[1:03:35] free but then when I leave out there I
[1:03:38] know the devil he got a gun trained on
[1:03:43] me he wants to catch me he wants to get
[1:03:46] me to fall he wants to ruin my
[1:03:50] testimony he got I got a Target on my
[1:03:53] back brother Brandon said when you say
[1:03:58] that you received the Holy Ghost he said
[1:04:01] a big Target is put on your
[1:04:03] back and all of
[1:04:07] hell has got his guns trained white
[1:04:11] on that's right
[1:04:14] right so I'm in a
[1:04:17] battle you're in the
[1:04:19] battle my battle is not your battle your
[1:04:23] battle
[1:04:24] is not my battle but the battle is the
[1:04:29] Lord It's the Lord's battle and if I
[1:04:32] stay on his
[1:04:34] word he'll win every
[1:04:38] battle now so what
[1:04:40] happens what happens when a spirit
[1:04:43] attacks us when a demon power comes
[1:04:47] against
[1:04:48] us whether it's
[1:04:51] music if it's
[1:04:53] l
[1:04:55] if it's anger or
[1:04:57] temper how do I overcome that brother
[1:05:00] Israel do I think about doing
[1:05:04] good that's part of it that's part of it
[1:05:09] you think good
[1:05:10] thoughts as a man thinketh in his
[1:05:14] heart so e he this is why we take the
[1:05:18] word of the
[1:05:19] lord we place it in our
[1:05:22] heart we place it in our mind
[1:05:25] we place it in our spirit so when we
[1:05:27] come against the
[1:05:29] devil come on now when we come against
[1:05:33] the
[1:05:34] devil we can take this word right
[1:05:37] here and serve notice on
[1:05:42] him amen yes sir praise the
[1:05:46] Lord so
[1:05:50] see he did that thank you my brother
[1:05:54] he did that to show the weakest
[1:06:00] Christian how to do
[1:06:02] it now look at this quote
[1:06:05] here brother random tells this message
[1:06:07] here
[1:06:10] 1952 I want you to listen to this
[1:06:14] closely he
[1:06:17] says when one comes to the
[1:06:20] platform with an ounce of faith
[1:06:25] you hear another one out there screaming
[1:06:28] for
[1:06:31] help the one standing here on the
[1:06:34] platform maybe is dying with
[1:06:38] cancer another one sitting up there with
[1:06:42] cancer and this
[1:06:44] cancer knowing that he's facing down
[1:06:49] here if the woman would only
[1:06:52] believe you see she'll be
[1:06:55] healed then to throw that woman's Faith
[1:07:00] off the other demon scream down to
[1:07:05] her and I catch in between
[1:07:09] them and I say there both of you
[1:07:12] believe so here brother BR is talking
[1:07:14] about in the prayer
[1:07:17] line he said many times he'll be praying
[1:07:20] for someone with
[1:07:22] cancer can and then a demon out there
[1:07:25] with
[1:07:27] cancer will scream to this
[1:07:30] demon cancer and what they're screaming
[1:07:33] for is
[1:07:35] help help why are they screaming for
[1:07:39] help because on the
[1:07:42] platform if there is an ounce of
[1:07:45] faith I'm not talking about a pound of
[1:07:48] Faith come on church I'm talking about
[1:07:51] an ounce of faith if the devil
[1:07:55] recognizes that there's an ounce of
[1:07:58] Faith he starts screaming for
[1:08:01] help because he
[1:08:03] knows faith will defeat him by the word
[1:08:07] of
[1:08:08] God praise the
[1:08:10] Lord all right all right praise the Lord
[1:08:14] amen yes sir can I go a little bit
[1:08:16] further
[1:08:17] here here here the prophet of God says
[1:08:21] here quickly now
[1:08:24] all right here the prophet says this
[1:08:27] here he says see them demons are
[1:08:30] screaming one to the other you
[1:08:33] see for
[1:08:35] pity for
[1:08:37] Mercy they're
[1:08:39] calling and the angels of God are
[1:08:43] calling the battle is
[1:08:45] here now your Fai will determine which
[1:08:50] way it
[1:08:51] go so uh uh just to save a little bit of
[1:08:55] time brother bam says it uh several
[1:08:59] times and this message what is in thy
[1:09:01] hand
[1:09:05] 1955 he says if them demons out there
[1:09:08] are screaming here for
[1:09:12] help if it has to leave here it's
[1:09:17] defeated and out there
[1:09:19] too because the demons know one
[1:09:22] another And when they see Faith they've
[1:09:26] got to move they don't have to move
[1:09:30] because you got mad they don't have to
[1:09:33] move because you're crying that's not
[1:09:36] going to move no devil stomping and
[1:09:38] shouting that's not going to move them
[1:09:41] but when you have faith and you have
[1:09:44] faith in the word of God oh yes he's got
[1:09:48] to go he's got to go he must go because
[1:09:54] the
[1:09:57] word the word said
[1:09:59] so can you say
[1:10:02] Amen all right let's get let's get into
[1:10:05] the word now let's get
[1:10:07] into all right if you are a
[1:10:10] Believer I asked you if you were a
[1:10:14] Christian most of the hands went
[1:10:16] up if you are a
[1:10:19] Believer you
[1:10:21] must put this into practice
[1:10:25] if you want to keep the
[1:10:27] victory now the devil doesn't care if
[1:10:30] you come to
[1:10:31] church and don't have the
[1:10:34] victory but if you got the victory
[1:10:37] there's a way that you keep the
[1:10:39] victory this is why so many
[1:10:42] times during the special
[1:10:44] meetings the meetings are
[1:10:48] high there's a lot of special
[1:10:51] singing there's a special
[1:10:54] atmosphere the word is
[1:10:56] preached people that don't normally sing
[1:10:59] they'll
[1:11:00] sing people that are normally don't
[1:11:02] raise their hand they'll raise their
[1:11:05] hand that's during a special
[1:11:07] meeting and then a week or so
[1:11:10] later you go find those
[1:11:13] people you wonder where they
[1:11:16] at why they sto
[1:11:18] singing why they stopped coming to
[1:11:21] church how did they lose the victory
[1:11:24] they lost the victory because they
[1:11:27] didn't put this in
[1:11:29] practice see you've got to tell the
[1:11:33] devil to
[1:11:35] leave to leave you've got to tell him
[1:11:39] don't ask him don't wish him to go it's
[1:11:44] got to come out of your

[1:13:34] prayer do you think the devil already

[1:13:47] Calvary he heard it
[1:13:50] before you know the devil has to be cast

[1:14:14] doing
[1:14:15] that you'll be doing that for the rest
[1:14:19] of your
[1:14:21] life so
[1:14:24] Bram would take a portion of his
[1:14:27] prayer and direct it right to
[1:14:32] Satan can I read one for you can I yes
[1:14:35] sir
[1:14:37] yes I have 17 more
[1:14:43] minutes all
[1:14:45] right God bless you we won't hold you
[1:14:48] long let me read
[1:14:52] one all right all right here the prophet
[1:14:56] of God says this
[1:14:59] here he's reading this this is the
[1:15:01] message in
[1:15:06] Veil he's ending up a
[1:15:09] prayer and he says this now God I
[1:15:13] believe that you hear what I ask
[1:15:17] for and I believe that Jesus words are
[1:15:22] true whatever I would ask I would
[1:15:26] receive therefore
[1:15:29] now I I thank you for
[1:15:32] it now this is his prayer now he's
[1:15:36] quoting the scriptures back to
[1:15:40] God and he said I thank you for
[1:15:43] it and I turned to the
[1:15:48] adversary so he turns to the
[1:15:51] adversary Satan
[1:15:54] and I say Satan we stand as a
[1:15:58] representative of
[1:16:01] God we stand as a bloody cross goes
[1:16:05] before
[1:16:09] us representing the Son of
[1:16:12] God who died there for your
[1:16:17] defeat and you're nothing but a
[1:16:20] bluff there he was wounded for our
[1:16:24] transgressions with his stripes we are
[1:16:28] healed and you are only a
[1:16:32] blood trying to Bluff the
[1:16:35] people but your bluff has been called
[1:16:39] now you can't hold them no
[1:16:42] longer I adure you by the Living
[1:16:46] God the Lord Jesus
[1:16:48] Christ that you depart from
[1:16:52] them
[1:16:54] and bother them no
[1:16:56] more so who who was he talking
[1:17:03] to say it again in Spanish maybe they
[1:17:06] didn't hear me I asked
[1:17:08] question he was talking to
[1:17:12] Satan he told him we got a bloody cross
[1:17:15] before
[1:17:16] us stand his
[1:17:20] representative and then he tells him
[1:17:24] you have no power you're nothing but a
[1:17:29] blood
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:36] am all right
[1:17:38] now so the prophet of
[1:17:41] God takes a portion of his
[1:17:44] prayer directs it to
[1:17:46] Satan and what he's telling
[1:17:49] him oh you've been so bad to so many
[1:17:52] people and I'm so mad at you
[1:17:57] no no he talking about nothing about
[1:17:59] being
[1:18:00] mad took my money made me
[1:18:05] broke gave me a flat last
[1:18:08] week lose my
[1:18:11] job they ain't doing
[1:18:13] nothing you when you when you complain
[1:18:16] like
[1:18:17] that I
[1:18:19] suspect that the devil loves to hear
[1:18:21] that like
[1:18:23] what else did I do what else did I
[1:18:28] do keep praising me yeah yeah I
[1:18:33] did every time you complain like
[1:18:37] yeah but that's not that's not what the
[1:18:39] prophet's prayer
[1:18:41] was he talked about the
[1:18:43] blood and the cross and the power of
[1:18:50] Jesus amen amen yes sir
[1:18:54] okay let's go a little bit
[1:18:56] further I have at least two prayers or

[1:26:20] prayers where brother
[1:26:23] brandham identifies the
[1:26:27] words that defeat
[1:26:29] Satan he says you repeat after
[1:26:32] me I'll say it but you pray
[1:26:37] it from a sincere

[1:26:43] place it must
[1:26:46] happen amen yes
[1:26:49] sir as I prepare to close
[1:26:53] with all of these
[1:26:56] prayers just about every one of
[1:26:59] them the first thing that brother
[1:27:01] brandham
[1:27:02] does is he addresses the almighty
[1:27:07] God it's like Jesus says our uh uh
[1:27:11] what's the Lord's Prayer it says
[1:27:14] um Lord's
[1:27:16] Prayer our
[1:27:18] father so when you don't call everybody
[1:27:20] your father
[1:27:23] to call him
[1:27:25] father that means you got to be his son
[1:27:27] or his
[1:27:29] daughter so it set it said so no Jesus
[1:27:32] said Jesus taught him how to
[1:27:35] pray When you pray say
[1:27:38] this Our Father Glory who are in
[1:27:44] heaven holy is your
[1:27:47] name thy kingdom
[1:27:49] come thy will be done
[1:27:53] and in every one of these
[1:27:55] prayers brother brandom
[1:27:59] addresses the almighty
[1:28:02] God who is the
[1:28:05] author of all good
[1:28:08] gifts he is the
[1:28:10] author of everlasting life he is the
[1:28:15] author of everything I
[1:28:18] need he's the
[1:28:21] author
[1:28:22] and he addresses the
[1:28:24] author of everlasting life that can't be
[1:28:28] nobody else only one can hold that
[1:28:33] position of everlasting life Giver Giver
[1:28:40] of every good
[1:28:42] gift so he addresses his prayer just
[1:28:45] like
[1:28:46] that the next thing he does in these
[1:28:51] prayers
[1:28:52] is he always confesses faith in his
[1:28:59] word in every one of
[1:29:03] them and when he asks for the
[1:29:07] blessing this is the third
[1:29:09] thing he always
[1:29:13] ask for a present tense
[1:29:18] blessing in other words he says right
[1:29:23] now I believe you're going to feel
[1:29:26] me right now you're going to heal my
[1:29:30] body
[1:29:32] tonight this
[1:29:34] morning right now it's going to happen

[1:29:42] wait till the special meetings
[1:29:45] come wait until
[1:29:47] Sunday wait until next week but in every
[1:29:51] one of these prayers

[1:29:57] the
[1:29:59] road he's calling on

[1:30:24] almighty he confesses faith in the
[1:30:27] promised
[1:30:30] word and then he calls God to do it
