him cause i will praise him and i is i will praise him is hallelujah hallelujah god bless you once again it's an honor to be here tonight to share a glimpse of our prophet's life william mary and branham taken from the book supernatural the life of william branham this is coming from chapter 10 and book one uh the boy and his deprivation something i would like to share in advance of the reading of this excerpt there are moments in everyone's life including the life of our prophet where his faith is being shaped and formed i feel very strongly that this was certainly touching on more than one of those it has something in it for both the young and old our young people and our adults and our young at heart i ask each one of you to pay close attention to those moments and as i'm reading this also for the very young people there are many times the devil will come at you with a trap and try to ensnare you asking you to prove things that have already been done by our lord jesus christ he's already done the work in this particular excerpt pay very close attention keep your faith strong believe on him and everything will be fine at the time at the beginning of this excerpt brother brannon to set the scene had just met hope brumbach he had just started attending the missionary baptist church and had developed a relationship with its pastor dr roy davis a christian relationship it starts off billy admitted that the reason he chose the missionary baptist church over any other church in town was simply because hope brumback went there however he soon developed a deep respect for its pastor dr roy davis preached that god was no better than his word and that a christian was no better than the faith in the word of god a saying which struck billy as the absolute truth dr davis constantly exhorted his congregation to believe the word of god with all their hearts and to put that word into practice in their daily lives what is more the this pastor seemed to live what he preached one morning in church dr davis told a story of how when he was a young man there had been a certain infidel crisscrossing the land standing up in church after church and challenging the christian faith to a severe test dr davis heard him at a large meeting in memphis tennessee the man read from mark chapter 16 where jesus said and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they will cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover then the infidel set a bottle of sulfuric acid on the podium and challenge the audience any of you people here who are supposed to be christians jesus said if you believe you could drink any deadly thing it would not harm you now if that's the inspired word of god then drink this sulfuric acid he repeated his challenge several times criticizing the christians for their lack of faith and mocking the very idea of god young dr davis said to an old methodist bishop sitting next to him if that infidel makes that challenge one more time i'm going to go up there and drink it the bishop tried to dissuade him the man's just popping his own brain let him alone son the bible says thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god but davis was determined no i won't let him alone and if i die in my shoes i'll go to heaven believing god's word the infidel laughed at the christians as the christians squirmed in their seats what about some of you guys out there that believe god is so real try this sulfuric acid test dr davis strode up to the podium turned and spoke to the audience of around 3 000 people i'm 25 years old i'm a minister of the gospel i know that my god is able to deliver me from that sulfuric acid but nevertheless if he does not i'll never let this infidel stand here in china's god word like this he grabbed the sulfuric acid and drank the bottle empty without suffering so much as a twinge of ill effect then he preached the gospel with such conviction that 1500 people rededicated their lives to jesus christ as billy listened to this story he thought that the methodist bishop had shown more sense than young dr davis why should anyone have to prove god hadn't jesus said about those unbelieving pharisees let them alone if the blind lead the blind they'll both fall in a ditch but even though billy didn't agree with what dr davis had done he still admired his pastor's faith being exposed to a man of such deep conviction inspired billy to pay close attention to the word of god the first chorus billy learned in church went to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him all through life's journey from earth to glory i only ask to be like him that became the constant prayer in billy's heart jesus helped me to be like you after reading through the new testament for the second time billy realized he needed to be baptized he read in matthew 28 where jesus told peter and the other disciples to teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost then brother brennan read in acts chapter 2 where several weeks later peter commanded the people to be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ it seemed to bill that if anyone knew what jesus meant when he gave his great commission it must have been peter and the rest of the disciples so billy asked dr davis to baptize him in the same way the apostles baptized in the book of acts even though this ran contrary to the doctrine of the missionary baptist church dr davis obliged and billy was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ god bless hey man good evening hey man when i started this amen if you don't mind standing how many of you uh enjoyed that little reading amen that god is tremendous amen amen he showed that uh you can't tempt you can't tempt god because he's always gonna come through no matter what amen amen how many have a petition or thanksgiving tonight man i know i do yo la tengo we have a rim petition here please brothers pray for my son's fast recovery and traveling mercies okay amen well we'll keep them in our hearts a man and anyone else traveling amen how many of you are needy once again amen well he's giving god we all know yes but we should keep fighting and just keep asking for it he'll give it to us hey man it seems hard at times but that's when it's just starting to get to get better and then it's at the at the tip it hits the peak and then it's going to go down and get better but lord gracious heavenly father senor padre celestial we come before you lord asking you for the brother and sister honestly lord and any of your children who have their hands lifted up here tonight you

gets me straight from day to day it will never lose it's one more time sing the chorus with all your heart to the lord please god bless you all this evening now i'm going to keep you standing for just a little bit and if you would would you go to the scripture that the brother was reading today uh before we came out uh psalms 91. thank you thanks sister thank you brothers and sisters for the music um it's psalms 91 i just want to take three verses from there not five six and seven and uh we'll we'll get to that on the screen in a little bit uh but first uh i wanna talk to you about uh uh let's see if i can work this right i want to talk to you about the uh what we're going to be well i want to introduce the subject tonight okay and the title is bulletproof washington you know i was thinking about what artie brother art gained juniors preached last sunday and he spoke to us about you know you know he showed some of these heroes right amen and like iron man i call him metal man iron man whatever it is and uh and i wanted to bring something that was complementary to that and it it okay what came to my mind was uh a subject that i want to speak to the older folks about some day and it's about um washington george washington and then take a little talk on abraham lincoln and i i'm i'm going to be asking you children now your parents don't get mad at me okay what we're going to be having today is a little class and everybody for brother daniel over here to sister margarita and for brother sister oh there's brother jose back there fascia all the way down to here to brother al everybody's in our classroom tonight is that okay a little lesson they're gonna be helping us that okay with you guys girls is that all right and uh we're gonna be talking about and tonight look what i'm doing i'm asking uh why don't you kids really read with me a lot of tonight's everybody you guys are with me and show them how we do choral reading in school you know how to do coral reading right okay so let's do coral reading a lot of tonight's talk comes from this book ask your parents to buy it don't tell them i told you that don't get mad it's not very it doesn't cost very much okay it's less than a couple of starbucks or something okay so and look let's read the title together uh see if i can point to it the bulletproof george the bulletproof george washington and that's the guy who wrote it that's what a lot of it's going to be coming from that so let's read the scripture uh i think that's on the next slide possibly yeah before we read the scripture let us pray besides the lord to help us heavenly father lord help us to make good use of time lord and may your children leave here uh knowing a little bit of what brother branham talked to us about that it's not this is not fairy tales this is we're not talking about fairy tales though it sounds like it lord to the reason to the rational worldly mind it sounds like fairy tales lord but this is not these are not fairy tales these are real things that happen in history they've been documented that are being taken away from us little by little lord and a lot of things are being taken away from us a lot faster but some of these things are just being taken away from us little by little and as long as we can present to you your children lord the truth and then let them research it on their own that's that's all i'm trying to do lord in the name of lord jesus christ i pray amen as i said in my prayers some of these things are going away some of things are being taken away from us this one here this part that i'm going to be speaking about tonight it was taken away from us 80 years ago since 1934 if i do my math correctly it's about 80 years ago so let's read the scripture you shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness nor for the destruction that wastes at noon day a thousand shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand but it shall not come near you thank you you may be seated now our prophet tells us the following in the and uh he says we had godly men like washington lincoln they had great godly men comparing to israel as david and sulfur then they got an ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct him so have we that's when i talked to the adults and understand that you guys are getting the little children's version of the adult version that i'll be speaking to the adults about and that's called jezebel religion and the first couple of times i'm going to be talking about just washington and then abraham lincoln if the lord gives me time to do so and i've been getting ready since since since last year um when i had my operation i've been doing some studying on different topics and just getting ready for when the lord provides a time and then this is a note for for you parents this is directly to the people are in the back rosa okay um many scholars the children may not understand that but you can explain to them scholars just means people that study a lot okay many scholars are re-evaluating and really rewriting it how many have heard that before from me say that you know they're rewriting our history books and and are asking very in-depth questions such as was george washington a christian or a deist this just means that you know like god makes a watch very detailed very makes all the universe he puts it there just walks away and forgets about it you know let the loss take care of itself he's doing enough something other stuff you know that's also disbelief kind of sort of very simplistic but your children in school are being asked these moronic questions that's the nicest thing i can see from the platform they're stupid idiotic questions and i'm not bashing the educational system sister it's that somebody's in charge of the educational system they're being told what to teach um and so so so these are some of the things that that are that are um but according to but according to the prophet of god who was george washington and what was he okay raise your hand children you have you have never heard of george washington you never heard you never heard george washington can you raise your hand he never heard our president in washington see we've all we've all heard about him right he's seen our dollar bill is that is he in our dollar bill i don't have a wall anyway my wallet's over here but it's it has different kinds of green paper in it uh here's what brother bam says about george washington he says george washington here at valley that's that's that's him right there crossing the delaware let's see if i get the right i'm going backwards huh okay here we go george washington here at valley forge before he crossed the delaware praying all night imagine that praying all night he was wet wet plain plump to his waist kneeling in snow so he's kneeling in snow and he's um i'm gonna get if i go down i mean i have to get up brother you might have to help me i'm okay he's kneeling in snow and he's wet all the way up to his waist i just was in chicago last january i got my feet wet just a little bit and i got a really bad cold is that right nana i got a really bad cold kind of like a boy kind of sort of but this guy was he's praying wow wet plumped his waist kneeling and so and the next morning when the americans started across there's only about 20 percent of them had shoes to wear the american army but they had a principle yeah there we go they had something that they had to fight for they didn't care what come or when the farmers come and stop this plow and took out his ox got his rifle and went out to fight for what he know it was freedom this is what the this is children what they call the men and men they got to be have to be ready in a minute right that's why they call them a minute men and men paul river comes hey the british are coming the red coats are coming they have to right there there's the alarm he sounded the alarm from every middlesex farm and listen to my children you shall hear the midnight ride of paul revere put so in the morning in april 75 hardly a man is not alive is that right sister is that wiggles i can remember that day or year he said to his friend in the british march they used to have to make they used to make us memorize things we don't do that in school anymore with our children not that much except for multiplication tables but that's a good poem for you guys to learn and uh the farmers come and stop this plow and they fight for what they knew was freedom and the next day i believe it was four or five bullet holes musket bullets went through his coat and had and never touched him okay so that's what brother branham says so we're going to get into somebody say oh that's a bunch of that's just a legend that's just fairy tales no it's it's it's history okay one of the things that was told to uh i don't know i'm not sure which way it is okay got the shortened version here what one of his uh daughters instead is it's like well there's a diff unusual relationship there but uh i'll just read it like this this year his step granddaughter also put in quotation marks um said this about him george washington his life his writings proved that he was a christian people that knew him knew he was the christian he didn't go around bragging about it okay that's what historians say he never talked about jesus you know well he lived it you know talk about it he was not one of those who act or pray that they may be seen a man he communed with with his god in secret many times people would say can i see that can i go can i see the general can i see mr washington and they come in and see washington they kind of pick in this door and be kneeling down praying and so he's busy right now uh can you wait can you wait and then he'd come out when he was ready you know imagine my dad a little bit another one is this is uh this comes from the the internet the story of the of of god's divine protection and the washington's open gratitude could you read me guys you guys can read that girls can you read that with me i want the people parents to know that you're learning how to read in school choral reading okay let's read that the story of god's divine protection and of washington's open gratitude could be found in virtually all school textbooks until 1934. washington okay now few americans have read it washington often recall this dramatic event that helped shape his character and confirm god's call on his life okay now here's here's what they're talking about read this with me kids conflict the battle of manonga sounds like a password in one of those uh danny k uh stories right here to know the right saying but here it happened on july 9th it's important to get to know what has happened um oh that way okay july 9 19 1755 during the french and indian war 17 something to say 17 something okay this is during the french and indian war europe they call it the seven years war because the last seven years and this is what happened this is uh this is the monongahela there are two armies fighting each other the british against the french and the indians just look at the numbers kids who's going to win there's 1300 men against 891 who's going to win british right in spanish they say pancomedo right this it's a done deal portuguese makanja chicken soup it's there's no way there there's no way these boneheads here knockerheads here are gonna win there's no way right they're gonna lose but what happens after casualties or what's killed or wounded the british casualties they lost almost 900 men and wounded or dead and their gender was killed and then and the french casualties out of 900 almost 900 only 30 of them got wounded or killed what's going on there well the british you know how they are very arrogant right and how are the french fighting and the british just thought they were cowards stand up and fight like a man no that's not the way they fought in the new world devil's sneaky gotta fight fire with fire they say right gotta be wise like a serpent harmless like a duck and these guys uh let's look let's go to the next one see the so anyway percentage-wise i did the math for you guys percentage-wise the british lost in casualties and dead uh over a little over two-thirds and the french and the indians they only lost three percent of their of their their men and the following information i'm gonna take and i gotta hurry the following information is taken from this book daniel what are you gonna do when you get home is your mom here yeah what are you gonna do what are you gonna do when you get home i ask your mom to buy the book what are you gonna do when you get

is going to be with this book this is awesome let's get to see what it says in there now start reading and uh this is kind of reading stuff okay washington wrote to his mother about this battle during this time um george washington is in his 20s 20 years old 20s he's in his early 20s and i'll read this july 18 1755 about monongahela he's writing to his mom the virginia troops showed bravery and were nearly all killed the general was wounded died three days after i luckily escaped without a wound though i had four bullets through my coat and two horses shot under me isn't that awesome same day he writes his brother and some because he writes a little bit different to his brother historian said well he wasn't too sure if it was god or not because he tells the mothers luckily i escaped and here to his brother he says the following he says by the miraculous why don't you read with me so i'm excited no you're following me by the miraculous care of providence that's heaven god i have been protected beyond all human probability or expectation for i had four bullets through my coat and two horses shot under me yet escaped unhurt although death was leveling my companions on every side of me a thousand on your right side or ten thousand on the left side doesn't matter they he they were falling on he's running back and forth on his horse he's not hiding he's going back and forth telling him hi man hi get fine cover and those that were listening to him found cover and the rest were just like kill look get what would you would you listen to your boss and hide hide for for cover head for cover whatever the expression is would you just stand there waiting for letting them shoot you well let's see what george washington does later too it's awesome he every side of him they were they were following they were dying they were getting killed one indian chief listen let's see now let's see what one indian chief that was in that battle this was let's see what he says this is all documented history guys this is all okay read with me one indian chief wrote about george washington regarding the battle of monongahela washington was never born to be killed by a bullet i had 17 fair fires at him with my rifle and after all could not bring him to the ground can you say praise the lord thank you god hallelujah amen whatever i'm not that should make you excited this is this is uh his enemies said that when they saw him saying i shouted him 17 times that i couldn't get him one one of the woman this is a woman that was a was a prisoner by the french and the indians she was over here and some of the trappers indian trappers and others that talk about this battle and they heard one some this one uh some trappers mentioning this guy red hawk one of the indian chiefs there says red hawk and then she this is the latest testimony red hawk indian chief told of shooting 11 different times at washington without hitting him there wasn't just one guy shooting at him you know okay king zx you only you only you can shoot at me and only you can shoot at me no it wasn't like that you know this is everybody he was right he was running back and forth on his horse being shot at 80 years later after the battle they find a seal and i think a seal is one of like the epileps epaulets or whatever they call it on the shoulder here 80 years later they found it on the battleground his family still has it as a memento keeps sick they knew that god protected now what brother branham's message was not in the corner and i'm going to tell you kids something i'm not a prophet i'm i do not consider myself a prophet i'm not a prophet i i'm not a prophet that's it boom i'm who i am i'm already burunda okay but we were talking about let's see 1980 something um when was that no no about 1980 something when uh diane and charles or whoever he is uh they had their first baby and they were they were they were guessing what are they gonna name and what are they gonna name him what are they gonna name him remember that how many remember that some of the older folks remember that yeah 1981 1982 something like that and i said to one of the guys at work i said if i was kind of stern with guys at work i said if that family remembers what god did for them they're going to name that baby william what are you talking about i said yeah he knows his grandfather was healed of meningitis or parkinson's i forget what disease it was sister he says yeah god healed him our my prophet our prophet i told him pray for that man you god healed them but he died sure we all die right is that right didn't nazer was didn't lazarus get raised up from the from the dead did he die again yeah is he going to rise up again yeah he's going to rise up again so what died buried rose up dies again rise up again beautiful but i told him i said he's going to be named william if they remember if they have any respect for god and they named him what charlie for after his dad and then william so anyway um people respect respect god where are we at now never missed i'll read that red hawk didn't you total shooting 11 times at washington without hitting his gun never had never before missed its mark can you imagine that imagine how frustrated this guy is it's like you guys when you're playing your little weaning these ducks couldn't get away from me but imagine after a while it gets a little bit out of alignment and then you go you get frustrated right imagine 11 missing missing him 11 times in a row 11 times never missed before and all of a sudden he's shooting at one guy i'm going to get that buzzard right there and shooting at an eagle though this time i'm gonna get that guy and and he shoots any any misses he ceased and and he missed its mark he ceased or stopped firing at him really that part with me i love i want more people reading with me this part right here he sees firing at him convinced that the great spirit protected him i love that you know anyway in 1770 this is uh 15 years after the battle now in 1770 george washington returned to the same pennsylvania woods a respected indian chief traveled a long way to meet the to meet him he sat down with washington face to face over a council fire and the chief told washington the following this is all this is history ladies and gentlemen can you say history with me okay thank you not fairy tales this is history i am and the indian chief says this and he's prophesized notice how i have up there i say prophesy you see that road right there prophesy i am a chief and ruler over my tribes my influence extends to the waters of the great lakes and to the far blue mountains i have traveled a long and weary path that i may might see the young warrior of the great battle it was on that day that i first beheld this chief indicating washington i called to my young man and said mark yeah mark john tall and daring warrior you see that in other words do you see that tall daring warrior he's not of the red coat tribe he has an indian's wisdom and his warriors fight as we do hiding you know said he was telling his guys hi guys don't stand up there like a just you're shooting like this i have to say it in english in spanish because i don't know how it says in english because i've memorized this kind of scripture in spanish forgive me it says is that right brother junior something like that a wise man sees danger and he flees doesn't stand there looking at her train i'm faster than you know come on train i'm come on he is not a vertical tribe he has indians with indians wisdom and his warriors fight as we do himself alone exposed he was he was telling everybody hi and he was running back and forth on his horse i know i'm repeating myself i'm sorry i just get excited i can't i'm in the moment right there i'm with him right now you understand brother man said ah when george washington did this i was with him when he crossed the dollar where i was right there with him when noah was in the ark i was there with him when jesus was on the cross i was there with him you understand you gotta you gotta put yourself in the moment put yourself in that spot like this morning god damn calvary brother man says until you can feel that spit running down your face you're not there yet you're not in that moment you got to be there you got to feel that to understand what jesus went through to know what he did for you it's not just read it no it's pretty nice look at that oh bullet miss him george raise your hand we were shot at once did it feel really nice you're you're carrying victoria right it's not until you're there not until you're there that you go you're right i thought you got hit in the face or something not until you're there can you actually experience this god i gotta move quick he says let your aim be certain and he dies our rifles were leveled rifles which but for you knew not how to miss toast all in vain a power mightier farther than we sh than we shielded you seeing you were under the seeing you were under the special guardianship of the great spirit we immediately ceased to fire at you i am old and shall soon be gathered to the great council of my father's in the land of the shades but before i go there is something that bids me commands me asks me drives me pushes me to speak in the voice of everybody say that word with me prophecy listen the great spirit protects that man indicating washington and guides his destiny he will become the chief of nations and a people yet unborn will hail him as a founder of a mighty empire i am come to pay homage to the man who is the particular favorite of heaven and who can never die in battle more divine protection this is from the book he was not he was not even wounded in that and that or any of the numerous battles in which he fought british major patrick ferguson was a renowned rifle shot and head of british sharpshooters we call them snipers you understand young man you understand sharpshooters snipers you know what a sniper is right move his men around in the forest as professional snipers on one occasion he identified an american target and and he and three of his best sharpshooters drew down on him just before ferguson ordered them to fire he experienced a surprising impulse and declared that the idea of shooting that particular american suddenly disgusted him the american officer in point-blank range range right it was right there they were hiding and they were they we got who got you buddy and point blank range turned and looked directly at ferguson locking eyes with him over the sides the officer slowly turned his back to ferguson okay okay well i won't yeah i'll just read it to you he looked directly at the guy who's going to shoot him right in the end she's on his horse looks at him then calmly just turned his horse around and he doesn't take off come on go ahead come on rc move turn his back slow officer slowly turns back to ferguson and then calmly cantered away let ferguson later discover from other british officers that it had been washington whom he had allowed to live ferguson lamented i'm sorry that i that i did not know at that time who it was it wouldn't matter anyway bullets what i got like in cartoons right god god was protecting him early historian george bancroft the father of american history because he wrote a lot about history reported other occasions of miraculous interventions in in washington's behalf we don't we don't read those words in our history book do we now anyway whatever including in 1777 when americans faced off against the british in battle of princeton washington this is a quotation this is a historian writing the father of american history writes this he says washington from his desire to animate his truth by example wrote in the very danger in front of danger and when he was less than 30 yards away this this evening i was going to paste it off brother i don't know how many paces from that wall to that wall over there i don't know that's that's a good 20 yards 25 yards something like that maybe that distance from the door to right here something like that what does he do he wrote in the very danger uh in front of danger and within and when within less than 30 yards of the british he reigned his horse with its head hello we go to the next slide brother i can't i lost the battery maybe the battery's gone from here or something is it under attack's ticking brother well i know what it is the time ran out and they they took the battery out they didn't want me to talk anymore that's what it is yeah you take this i like that strategy is that we i'll keep i'll shut him that'll shut him up wrong my wife has been doing that to me for many years and she hasn't found the right remote yet either okay course with his head towards them as both parties were about to fire can you imagine that he's the general he's the number one guy and he rides his horse out there in front of those guys from here to the wall and he says come on guys let's take them and they both level out like this let's see what it says seeming to tell his faltering forces they were faltering they were you know falling apart that they must stand firm or leave him to confront the enemy alone the two sides gave a volley at the same moment when the smoke cleared away it was thought a miracle that washington was untouched bancroft reports a similar outcome at the battle of trenton where's what's a battle of trenton the battle of trenton is the battle that takes place after right after he crosses the delaware okay so even though brother branham uh yeah that's the that's the one picture of the battle of trenton he's uh 28 battles never wounded in any of them brother ma'am tells us we had great men like
