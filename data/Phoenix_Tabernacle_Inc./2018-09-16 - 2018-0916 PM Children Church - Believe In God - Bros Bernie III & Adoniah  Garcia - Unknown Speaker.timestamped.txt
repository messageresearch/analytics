[21:37] god bless you my my that's a beautiful
[21:41] song every time we sing it I get these
[21:46] visions and it's so amazingly beautiful
[21:49] and we have other songs that we sing
[21:52] other hymns that give me that impression
[21:55] and I got to tell you it leaves an
[21:59] impression on me
[22:00] that's heavenly tonight it is it is my
[22:05] honor distinct honor that I'm not worthy
[22:09] of but to bring you the next half of the
[22:12] chapter chapter 35 of the book
[22:14] supernatural the life of William Branham
[22:16] we're in book three the man and his
[22:18] commission from 1946 to 1950 written by
[22:22] Owen Jorgensen and if you remember in
[22:25] the first half of this chapter last
[22:28] reading there was a very historic series
[22:31] of services a campaign in Phoenix
[22:33] Arizona to brother Ernie was sharing
[22:35] some information about me about that
[22:36] about that group of services to me and
[22:39] and very amazing just a very amazing
[22:45] thing happened there are many miracles
[22:46] happened here in Phoenix right here in
[22:48] Phoenix Arizona in 1947 February it was
[22:52] and brother Brandon played prayed for
[22:57] 2,500 people in a prayer line in one
[23:00] night that's an almost inconceivable
[23:03] number and a testament to his his
[23:07] willpower to serve the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:10] tonight we will read the second half of
[23:13] the chapter entitled refusing a check
[23:15] for 1 million five hundred thousand
[23:17] dollars now we did the math on it last
[23:21] time brother Ernie and using the average
[23:23] inflation of three and a half percent
[23:25] per year since 1947 and twenty eighteen
[23:28] dollars it's over seventeen million
[23:30] dollars so to share that with you but
[23:35] brother Brandon had to come to a
[23:36] decision point he was also presented a
[23:39] very similar moment back in 1937 and if
[23:43] brother Brandon was here today I know in
[23:44] my heart he he wouldn't make the same to
[23:49] sue
[23:49] but this time I'm so thankful that he
[23:52] made the decision he did and and the
[23:56] Lord was guiding him I mentioned last
[23:58] time you know there's the world economy
[24:01] and then there's God's economy brother
[24:03] Brennan and operated in God's economy
[24:04] and he proved that to the Lord when he
[24:08] made that that decision so we'll get
[24:11] started here he has now moved to
[24:13] California
[24:14] his next series of campaigns in March of
[24:17] 1947 bill worked his way up to
[24:19] California coast his first meeting Los
[24:22] Angeles overflowed a large Church in
[24:24] Monterey Park prompting the cooperating
[24:27] churches to move the meetings to the
[24:28] Municipal Auditorium in Long Beach
[24:30] California on the second night of the
[24:32] campaign three men and a young woman
[24:35] came through the prayer line carrying an
[24:37] unconscious woman on a stretcher bill
[24:39] grasped the patient's limp right hand
[24:42] and felt a familiar vibration it's
[24:44] cancer he said the young woman said yes
[24:48] her name is Malik Ian this is her doctor
[24:53] and I'm her daughter recently she went
[24:56] to st. Louis and had both her breasts
[24:57] removed trying to stop it spread but it
[25:00] didn't help now God is her only hope
[25:03] lowering his head bill asked God for a
[25:06] miracle the vibrations in his hand
[25:08] ceased he was about to pronounce her
[25:11] healed when a strange feeling came over
[25:13] him and he said without thinking thus
[25:16] saith the Lord in three days this woman
[25:19] will be shopping in the street markets
[25:21] her doctor who had evidently come along
[25:24] to oblige de family huffed indignantly
[25:27] the very idea Reverend Branham this
[25:29] woman is obviously dying how can you
[25:32] give her people false hopes like that
[25:34] calmly bill returned doctor if that
[25:38] woman isn't well and walking on the
[25:39] street in three days you can put a sign
[25:41] on my back that says I'm a false prophet
[25:44] and you can drive me around town on the
[25:46] hood of your car towards the end of the
[25:48] week bill roused from his exhausted
[25:50] sleep to the sound of heavy knocking on
[25:52] his hotel room door in the hallway stood
[25:55] a church official whose job was to guard
[25:58] Bill's privacy but high hymns too to
[26:01] well-dressed strangers
[26:02] I'm sorry to bother you brother branham
[26:05] but these two men need to see you I know
[26:07] you have to get some rest but their
[26:09] business is so extraordinary I thought
[26:11] come on in what can I do for you
[26:14] the two men stepped inside in the
[26:16] spokesman got right to his point we are
[26:19] agents of mr. Malik Ian Malik Ian bill
[26:23] repeated the name trying to remember
[26:24] where he had heard it before miss
[26:27] Morelli ken runs the Mission Bell winery
[26:29] his wife was healed of cancer in your
[26:31] meetings earlier this week now bill
[26:33] remember down conscious woman on the
[26:35] stretcher how is she doing mr. Branum
[26:38] her recovery has astonished everyone
[26:40] especially her doctor the day after you
[26:42] prayed for her she regained
[26:44] consciousness and sat up in bed on the
[26:47] third day she went shopping with her
[26:49] daughter just like you said she would
[26:51] mr. Milliken is so grateful to you that
[26:54] he sent us here to give you this check
[26:56] for $1,500,000 the man held out the
[27:01] check bill did not move the man said mr.
[27:05] Branum this is no joke it's a perfectly
[27:08] good check and it's made out to your
[27:10] name he extended the slip of paper bill
[27:14] still did not take the check he thought
[27:17] about his family living in a two-room
[27:18] shanty in Jeffersonville Indiana thought
[27:21] about his wife carrying water for half a
[27:23] city block to the house then carrying
[27:26] the dirty dishwater outside again
[27:28] because the house didn't have indoor
[27:30] plumbing he thought about how cold in
[27:32] traffic the house was in the winter and
[27:34] how maida stuffed rags around the doors
[27:37] and windows to keep out the wind it
[27:40] would be wonderful to give his family
[27:41] something better but for so many years
[27:47] bill had struggled to understand his
[27:49] calling in the Lord when he stepped out
[27:51] of the will of God in 1937 he suffered
[27:54] so terribly that now even $1,500,000
[27:58] could tempt him to stray from his
[28:01] convictions he had not healed miss
[28:04] Maliki enough cancer the Lord Jesus
[28:06] Christ that healed her so how could he
[28:09] accept any recompense for something he
[28:12] had not done even beyond this building
[28:15] noted three
[28:16] Falls had often wrecked men who started
[28:18] out to live for God money popularity and
[28:22] women any Minister her flirted with
[28:25] these dangerous risks slipping and
[28:26] falling bill determined long ago to stay
[28:29] clear of all three regardless of what
[28:31] had cost him
[28:32] gentlemen he said firmly I don't even
[28:35] want to look at that check tell mr.
[28:37] Maliki and I appreciate the thought but
[28:39] I cannot accept his money after his last
[28:44] prayer line in Long Beach California
[28:46] which ended at 2:00 in the morning
[28:47] bill staggered numb and senseless to a
[28:49] waiting car Jack Moore and young brown
[28:52] drove him around town for an hour
[28:54] talking to him trying to get him to
[28:55] respond they rolled down his window to
[28:58] let the rain splatter in his face
[29:00] finally bill came back to himself enough
[29:03] to want to go to bed they drove him to
[29:05] his hotel when they stepped out of the
[29:08] elevator into a small waiting room a
[29:10] number of people crowded forward calling
[29:12] bills name wanting to talk to him more
[29:14] and brown were pushing him through the
[29:16] group when a woman fell on the floor in
[29:18] front of bill clutching the leg of his
[29:20] trousers Jack Moore reached down to pull
[29:22] her off but bill waved him away saying
[29:25] let's at least hear her story even with
[29:28] that assurance the woman would not let
[29:30] go of Bill's pant leg her eyes revealed
[29:32] her desperation brother branham I'm mrs.
[29:36] Kay my husband and I attended your
[29:38] meetings in Phoenix when you prayed for
[29:40] that epileptic child my husband refused
[29:43] to bow his head the next day he got a
[29:45] funny feeling all over his body he
[29:48] thought it was just his imagination
[29:49] playing tricks on him two days later two
[29:52] police found him wandering amyl too
[29:53] around downtown Phoenix his mind has
[29:56] snapped he doesn't know who he is or
[29:58] what he's doing now bill noticed a man
[30:01] standing back from the group his eyes
[30:02] were hollow his face gaunt his hair and
[30:05] closed his shovel his cheeks covered a
[30:07] scraggly beard is that your husband bill
[30:10] asked yes brother branham mrs. Kay
[30:13] wailed
[30:13] I've tried every night to get him into
[30:16] the prayer line but I never could do it
[30:18] now I'm desperate something has got to
[30:21] be done he won't eat I even have to pour
[30:24] water down him she dropped her forehead
[30:26] on bill shoe
[30:27] turning to Jack more bill said take mr.
[30:30] K into my room so we can have some
[30:32] privacy
[30:33] Jack more took mr. Kay's hand and led
[30:36] him as easily as if he were a mindless
[30:39] child bill tried to follow but mrs. K
[30:42] would not let go of his leg nor what
[30:45] could she be persuaded to loosen her
[30:46] grip
[30:47] finally more and brown picked bill up
[30:49] and carried him to his room dragging
[30:52] mrs. K along behind after locking the
[30:55] door they at last persuaded her to let
[30:57] go of Bill's leg sister bill said about
[31:00] a year ago an angel of the Lord met me
[31:02] and told me that I was to take a gift of
[31:05] healing to the peoples of the world he
[31:07] told me that if I would be sincere and
[31:09] could get the people to believe me then
[31:12] nothing would stand before my prayer I
[31:13] have found that to be true there is no
[31:16] affliction no matter how bad it is but
[31:19] what it would be healed if I took long
[31:21] enough praying for that person do you
[31:24] believe me yes brother Branham I do mrs.
[31:29] K stood very still not even blinking his
[31:32] eyes were fixed in the vacuous stare
[31:34] when bill approached him he shrank back
[31:37] and growled like an animal for safety's
[31:39] sake more an Brown held mr. Kay's arms
[31:41] while bill laid his hands on the man and
[31:44] prayed victory did not come easily for
[31:47] 45 minutes bill wrestled with that demon
[31:49] of insanity finally mr. kay blinked and
[31:52] looked around the room with the demeanor
[31:54] of a man who had just awakened in an
[31:56] unexpected place and was wondering where
[31:58] he was and why after his wife explained
[32:01] mr. kay threw his arms around Bill's
[32:04] neck and hugged him like a long-lost
[32:06] brother he left a hotel with his mind as
[32:09] sharp as ever although now quite
[32:11] sympathetic to the gospel of Jesus
[32:14] Christ god bless you
