prideful and I feel a little lucky um today because apart from just being able to listen to you sing this um this afternoon I have had the privilege of having another experience that many people in the church don't have see her baby her grandson John helps me out at the barber shop a lot and he's so spoiled she comes and drops off homemade banana nut bread all the time and when he's not looking I'm stealing that banana no bread but I confess to sister Sharon and she's such a Christian she says that's John's problem that's not mine so I I'm pretty sure that her her banana in the bread is so delicious I could I could only imagine how much a song sung under anointing so can you please welcome her one more time with a round of applause [Applause] [Music] pleas the name William randam some called in never more home oh man was born and on that beautiful ail born in a humble little cabin in a crw small bed a light Shone through the window and hung over his head his first visitation came a voice from a tree saying keep yourself holy with the I'll be he had so many hard trials in his life lost his daughter Sharon and hold his wife the things he went through would have made most turn back but courage and Faith this man did not lack his ministry started with Healing The Sick The Crow s gathered for it some said it's a trick hundreds and thousands from every land were anxious to be prayed for by the soft sporen men they wanted the blessings they knew they'd receive but the word he brought forth they were unwilling to he they were willing to be prayed for by this humble little man but said leave the preaching in our capable hands but that word was like music to some people's ears it vanished all our doubts and it shed all our fears God's word in those messes he did hide only to be caught by God's Chen bright I'm so thankful like you are for God's gracious Mercy that he would open our eyes and permit us to see this prophet of God had the truth for our day and we will stand for every word of it come what made yes we will stand for every word of it come what way [Applause] [Music] there are many voices in this world calling out today voices to confuse us to lead our souls astray there is the voice of the church saying we're the only way but there is just one voice today that we must oy and I heard that voice call onto me that voice spoke life and Liberty it broke my chains and set me [Music] free William bram's voice is God's voice to me there are those who say that voice is gone we're called to carry on the work that he set out to do our voice will lead you home for we must have fresh Mana those tapes are from the past but for the bride this St of food is all that will [Music] last and I heard that voice call unto me that voice for [Music] why and Liberty it broke my chains and set me [Music] free William Brandon's voice is God's voice to [Music] me if God chose that voice to speak through then that's the [Music] voice I choose to listen [Music] [Applause] to amen let's just give the Lord another round of applause and sister [Applause] Sharon Sharon amen good evening welcome to the house of the Lord amen our house amen amen how many

have a little uh a little testimony it's not my testimony but just a little Thanksgiving that I I want to thank the Lord for um on the way from Camp because we came back from Camp last Sunday we got a call that my grandpa was getting taken to the emergency and he's actually here in the back if he could raise his hand just so everyone knows who he is amen that's my grandpa so they had told us that he was getting taken to the emergency and uh we had heard this the the last service and it was going to be time for us to come back amen and it just so happens that the title of Camp was actually let me rephrase that it didn't just so happen it was God who made the camp theme faith is our Victory amen man and it just so happens and not even just so happens a week or two weeks before before that I had preached on a Friday night and the lord gave me the title faces my victory in my life isn't he wonderful so my grandpa's getting taken to the emergency he's in the emergency room and they figured out that it was a heart attack and me me being me I don't know what that's like but I can only imagine the fear the fear of dying you know and I just want to read something here in the message faith is our Victory by brother brandom it reads like this uh but when you see your sins as God sees them in the light of his Bible when you see you'll repent or perish something will take place you'll get to business he says walk out of here in a smothering around your heart the doctor back there maybe will rise up and come up and look and tell you it's a heart attack he says you'll get to business and then he says that's when you get to business and he says and that and the woman is sitting here looking at me now and my grandpa's here looking at me now I believe we serve a living God the same God that healed this sister of her heart attack healed my grandpa of his heart attack amen they didn't find anything wrong with his heart or his brain and I know he's thankful I'm thankful and I just had to say that to you guys because our brother Mario told me told us on Friday night Friday night this past Friday he said that God likes to hear it from your mouth he likes to hear of his his doings in your life but from your mouth he likes when he likes when you talk about him with one another he rejoices up in heaven I believe when he heals his children talking about how grateful they are to be here to be alive to take another breath amen and I'm just thankful for that amen now if you just don't mind bowing your heads and if there's anything that you need from the [Music] Lord I've learned

[Applause] God footsteps of the prophet behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse Malachi 4: 5-6 crash the lightning struck just outside Junior's window mama mama Junior was shaking and trembling with fear he pulled the blanket over his eyes because he just couldn't bear to look out the window I'm so afraid of the storm he said to himself and it's getting closer and closer to our house suddenly another crash Mama come quickly yes Junior what is it honey come on up here and and sleep with me Mama Junior nothing is going to bother you that lightning can't hurt you but Mama come up here and sleep with me Junior begged Junior my little son mother wants to tell you something we are a Christian family we believe in God and we believe that he protects Us in storms so don't be scared son God is with us mama I believe that too but when that lightning is so close to the window I feel like a god with skin on it Mama could only smile at her little boy when she heard his desperate words honey would you like me to read you a book yes Mama yes all right son I want to read you the book footsteps of the Prophet but this time as I read it I want you to really pay attention then you'll understand why we don't need to be afraid of the storm anymore okay mama that's one of my favorite books read it read it okay Junior but remember I want you to listen very closely because this isn't just a story book all these things are true these are things that actually happened in brother bram's life yes Mama I'll listen close okay son do you remember where the story starts in the Log Cabin it All Began on April 6th 1909 in a little Log Cabin way back in the hills of Kentucky inside the cabin Charles and Ella Branham were admiring their new baby boy Charles looked at his firstborn son and said we will call his name William it was a little dark out inside so they opened the window to get a better look at the baby what happened next is so incredible that some people don't believe it happened but it did happen and when the window opened a bright light came into the room and rested over the baby wow Mama the light came into the room with them yes Junior do you remember the story about Moses and the burning bush the light that Moses saw was the same light that came into the cabin that morning even when brother Bram was just a baby God was proving that he would be a prophet like Moses what's a prophet Mama a prophet is a very special person that God sends to help his people now let's keep reading when brother branam was a boy he helped his daddy by carrying buckets of water from a well and one day he was on his way home and he saw a very strange Whirlwind in a tree it stayed in the tree and would not move well then a voice came out of the world Wing saying never smoke drink or defile your body in any way there's a work for you to do when you get older well brother brandham had a dog named Fritz that love to go hunting and Fritz loved to chase AP possums and raccoons but knew better than to chase a smelly skunk but if he patted him and said sicken boy he would run after the skunks anyways he said that good dogs like Fritz will be with us in heaven one day wait wait wait a minute Mama there will be animals in heaven yes Junior do you remember the story of Elijah when the horses and Chariot came from Heaven to pick him up the Bible also says that Jesus will come riding from Heaven on a white horse I think heaven will be a good place don't you Mama I certainly do junior it will be wonderful there and when he got older brother Branham really wanted to become a Christian he wanted to tell God that he was sorry for all his mistakes but he didn't know how to pray so he wrote a letter to God and tacked it to a tree he knew that God lived in nature and would walk by there someday well do you think Jesus ever got his letter Mama yes I do junior did you know that Jesus got his letter before he wrote it the Bible teaches us that God knows what you are going to do even before you do it let's keep reading now this next story is your favorite as a Young Man brother Branham wanted to travel out west to be a cowboy he wanted to show everyone how he could ride the meanest bucking horse in the world and one horse in Arizona called the Kansas Outlaw was especially mean and after seeing all the Cowboys get bucked off he decided that he really didn't want to ride that horse so brother brandham love the West so much he wrote this poem I am Lonesome oh so lonesome for that far away Southwest where the Shadows Fall the deepest Over the Mountain Crest I can see a lurking coyote All Around The Purple Haze I can hear a lowo hollering down with a long horns graze and somewhere up the canyon I can hear a lion wine in that far off Catalina mountains at the araona line one night in Indiana brother was praying in a field for his daddyy because his daddy was not living for Jesus and while he was praying he looked up and saw the Lord Jesus standing close to him Jesus was a small man he was wearing a white robe and looked very peaceful brother brandham said Jesus then Jesus turned to him and raised his arms out mama if we say his name will he hear hear us like he heard brother Branham he certainly will honey he is with us right now and he is always ready to listen to us well I'm not afraid of the storm anymore but I want to hear more of the story junior said brother bunny do you want to come up and be a bit interactive and act like brother Brandon for me please thank you and after brother Bram became a minister he baptized many people in the Ohio River one day a bright light came down from the sky a voice thundered from Heaven saying as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second coming of Christ and many years later he went to a cabin to pray late that night he saw a light shining on the floor and then an angel came walking into the light and said fear not brother brandham was scared until he heard that voice as soon as he heard it he knew it was the same voice that had spoken to him in the Whirlwind when he was a little boy the angel told him that he would go around the world and pray for Kings monarchs and other great men but not to fear because he would always be with him the angel also told brother Brandon the people would believe him because he would know the secrets in their hearts so one morning brother brandham was fishing with friends a little fish they had caught died and was floating near the bank the Lord told him to stand up and say little fishy I give you your life in the name of Jesus Christ and when he did the fish immediately came back to life and swam away one of brother branham's favorite things to do was squirrel hunt so one day he was hunting when it was very windy squirrels don't like wind so there were none to be found he asked Jesus for some squirrels to hunt and Jesus created three of them for brother Branham while walking through a field one day on his way to pray for a sick man brother brandham accidentally walked right up to a mean killer bull the bull was really really mad and stood up ready to charge but instead of running away brother brandham had loveed for the bull and told him that he was sorry for disturbing him then he said in the name of Jesus Christ go lay down the bull looked at him and was suddenly calm and then laid back down why Mama did that big old bull go and lay down well Junior the Bible teaches us that the most powerful thing in the world World Is Love brother branam loved the bull and that's why he laid down even big mean animals know when you love them amen so the Lord promised brother branam that he would shoot a big Silver Tip grizzly bear so he was out hunting and told all his friends about God's promise they couldn't understand because they had never seen one in that area before but they believed God anyway just before the hunt ended they saw him it was a large Silver Tip Grizzly pow the gun fired and down went the bear the Lord kept his promise amen see brother Branham loved to go to the mountains so one time a huge blizzard came and started blowing snow and the Lord told him to speak to the storm and it would go away he said storm go to your place stop and son you shine normally for 4 days within a moment the Sun was shining and the clouds had disappeared mama he talked to the storm and said for it to go away yes do you remember when Joshua told the son to stand still and Moses parted theed Red Sea when we have a need we can ask anything and God will do it see on another trip on the back side of the desert the Lord sent a huge Whirlwind That Shook the ground where brother branam was standing the Rocks exploded from the side of the mountain because the worldwind was so strong and brother branham's friends were trying to get to safety from the flying rocks they didn't know what the blast meant until brother brandham told them it was God speaking to him in the Whirlwind he said it was a sign that God would judge the west coast and lastly brother Branham had a dream that he had to go on a trip in his dream he needed to store up cabbage turnips and other foods for us to eat while he was gone later brother brandham explained that the dream meant for him to record his voice on tapes so we can listen to them now amen today brother Bram sermons are translated into different languages and are sent around the world when people listen to the tapes many of them want to become Christians they learn that the happiest people in the world are people who love and serve the Lord Jesus Junior all through brother bram's life he proved that we don't need to be afraid of anything he showed us how Jesus will protect us it doesn't matter if it's a killer bull or a fierce storm God is always watching over us the same God that was with brother brandham will always protect you even during this storm night we are all children of God and through the message that brother brandham brought us God is guiding us every step of the [Applause] way amen God bless you did you enjoy that truly we are privileged people amen they were so important to God he sent Elijah the prophet in the form of our brother brandham all of those manifestations there are Supernatural things confirming the prophet of this seventh age can you please stand with us please truly we're very thankful with God because he's been with us that the book uh if you please this book has an inscription inside samman this book belongs to our sister Samra Guzman Sharon and sister Sharon she felt in her heart it'd be good to share it with the children and it came and that's how the inspiration came and that way we can all be blessed for me
