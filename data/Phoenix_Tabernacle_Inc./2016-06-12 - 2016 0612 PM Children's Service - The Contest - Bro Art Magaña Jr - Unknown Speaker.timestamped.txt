[24:23] to be up here to be able to present to
[24:25] you the next and the sequential series
[24:28] of exerts from the Books supernatural
[24:31] the Life of William branam we're in Book
[24:34] two the young Man in his desperation
[24:36] we're starting chapter 23 we're Going To
[24:38] we're going to actually read The first
[24:41] part of that chapter Tonight before gets
[24:44] started um just a quick comment um This
[24:49] chapter is entitled struggling Back it
[24:52] covers the years of 1937 to
[24:56] 1939 and as
[24:59] have we've been as we've been taught in
[25:01] the message each and Every One of Us
[25:02] have a purpose God has a purpose for
[25:05] Us and at some Point in Our Life It's
[25:09] revealed to Us What Our specific Place
[25:11] is in god's
[25:13] Kingdom brother brannon was discovering
[25:17] this as he was recovering as You
[25:19] remember from The Last of the tragedies
[25:22] That Had befallen him he struggled to
[25:25] find meaning in it and like many of Us
[25:28] the best Place to turn When we're in
[25:30] those types of Times in Our Life is to
[25:33] scripture and brother Brandon did Just
[25:38] that before we get started I also want
[25:41] to um Let everyone know um this
[25:46] particular
[25:49] chapter does include some scripture
[25:51] Which I find very um
[25:54] uplifting and after the recent chapters
[25:57] we've been through in this Book and at
[25:59] this Point in brother brennon Life He's
[26:01] closing in on 30 years
[26:03] old so those of Us young and young at
[26:06] Heart Take Heart in
[26:08] this that your purpose for in your life
[26:12] that God has for
[26:15] you It's a progressive
[26:19] revelation and so without further do
[26:22] we'll get
[26:25] started River Had indeed measured 20
[26:29] Spring stre during the 1937 flood
[26:32] exactly as the Angel Had shown William
[26:34] branom it would brandom tabernacle Which
[26:37] was not Far from Spring Street Had also
[26:39] received a baptism Rising flood water
[26:42] Had Broken out the Windows floating
[26:44] Everything inside that was not fastened
[26:46] down including the pulpit and pews When
[26:50] The muddy River Finally receded the pew
[26:52] came down crisscross and topsy turvy but
[26:55] the pulpit settled down in Almost ex
[26:58] spot Where it belonged Still upright and
[27:02] Still facing The
[27:03] congregation the Night before the flood
[27:06] Bill Had left his Bible lying open on
[27:08] top of the pulpet when he Finally got
[27:11] Back to survey the damage he Found that
[27:13] his Bible was right Where he Had left it
[27:16] Still Open to the same page Bill took
[27:19] this as a Sign from God even though the
[27:22] outer circumstances of his Life were in
[27:25] disarray the word of God that he preach
[27:28] remained Ever true and
[27:31] stable that Was encouraging and Bill
[27:33] needed Every ounce of encouragement he
[27:35] could get to help him endure his Life he
[27:38] Just could not get over losing his wife
[27:40] and his daughter he felt like he was
[27:42] serving a Prison sentence with no hope
[27:44] of parole sadness ped him in like the
[27:47] Bars of a cell loneliness watched him
[27:50] like a Prison guard and hopelessness
[27:53] like a stern warden seemed to regulate
[27:56] his Every move the seemed Almost too
[27:59] heavy to Bear sometimes he squeezed
[28:02] comfort from his Dream of hope and
[28:04] Sharon in heaven he knew It was a Dream
[28:07] Because he Had fallen asleep visions
[28:10] happened when he was wide awake but it
[28:13] Had been such a memorable Dream so vivid
[28:16] down to the grain of the Wood on the
[28:18] Prairie schooner and the footprints left
[28:20] by his boots in the Sand although it
[28:23] seemed to be so full of meaning as
[28:25] though God Had Wanted to Tell him many
[28:27] Things some Point seemed obvious the
[28:30] Broken Wagon Wheel surely represented
[28:32] his Broken family and It was true that
[28:35] hope and Sharon were Now in a better
[28:37] Place than Earth but other symbols were
[28:40] not so Clear Why Was the Dream set in
[28:43] the West was there Any significance in
[28:46] the setting sun most puzzling of all
[28:48] What did hope mean when She said he was
[28:51] wearing himself out praying for the sick
[28:54] for these questions he could find no
[28:56] suitable answers Bill drew his greatest
[28:59] strength from the Bible he read in
[29:01] romans
[29:02] 828 Where the apostle Paul said and We
[29:06] know that all things work Together for
[29:08] The Good to them that Love God to them
[29:11] Who are called according to his purpose
[29:14] Bill struggled to believe that but It
[29:17] was so hard to see What possible good
[29:20] could come from losing his wife and
[29:22] daughter he marked John 14 Where Jesus
[29:26] said Let not your Heart be troubled You
[29:29] believe in God and believe also in me in
[29:33] my father's house are many manions I go
[29:37] to prepare a Place for you I will come
[29:39] Again and receive you unto Myself Let
[29:43] not Your Heart be troubled neither Let
[29:46] It Be
[29:47] afraid Bill tried to practice this
[29:49] advice but his Heart was often troubled
[29:51] Just the same although he continued to
[29:54] preach in his Church he Had Lost much of
[29:56] his former Energy and Drive he cared
[30:00] Just as much about the people but
[30:02] somehow he did not feel right with the
[30:04] lord whenever he prayed he could Never
[30:06] quite Touch the throne of God the way he
[30:08] Had previously he felt miserable his
[30:12] mother Still lived just a few blocks
[30:14] away from him after the Death of Charles
[30:16] senor She Had turned her home into a
[30:19] boarding House Which produced a steady
[30:21] though modest means of Support each day
[30:23] ella would Cook Breakfast and supper for
[30:25] her patrons Bill frequently by in the
[30:28] Evening for supper One night While he
[30:31] helped his mother Clear dirty J from the
[30:33] table ella asked him What he thought
[30:35] about the new Bridge they were building
[30:37] Over The H River between Louisville
[30:39] Kentucky and jeffersonville Indiana
[30:42] doesn't it strike you as familiar She
[30:44] ask ella
[30:47] nodded strange but somehow it does
[30:50] Almost like I remember it from somewhere
[30:52] ella nodded One Day years ago you came
[30:55] running into the house all exciting
[30:57] babbling about seeing a
[31:01] Bridge Where there was no Bridge at
[31:04] First I thought It was all malarkey but
[31:06] then I got to wondering so I wrote It
[31:09] Down and tucked it away She handed him a
[31:11] folded Piece of Yellow paper Bill knew
[31:14] what it said before he read it his
[31:16] boyhood Memory came rushing back he
[31:19] remembered the Apple Tree The Game of
[31:21] marbles the peculiar feeling that came
[31:23] over him he recalled How The River Had
[31:26] suddenly seemed closer and How the
[31:28] Bridge Had rapidly formed Over The water
[31:31] going Together Piece by Piece until that
[31:33] One girder High in the middle broke free
[31:36] and came crashing down he opened The Old
[31:39] scrap of paper and read his mother's
[31:42] scroll then he thought about the new
[31:44] Bridge Under construction there It was
[31:47] it Had happened Just the way he Had seen
[31:49] it when he was a boy mama What do you
[31:52] think it means She shrugged How should I
[31:56] know but Billy Over The years I've often
[31:58] wondered if you were born for a special
[32:00] purpose in Life I Still think that might
[32:03] be
[32:04] so remembering that boyhood Vision his
[32:07] First Vision and Now realizing it Had
[32:10] been fulfilled Bill wondered the same
[32:13] Thing could his Life be really moving
[32:15] toward some Unique purpose currently his
[32:18] Life felt so Dry so empty so devoid of
[32:21] meaning that It was hard to Imagine How
[32:23] God could use him for anything special
[32:25] but he could Never forget that s Boy
[32:28] listening in terror as a Deep voice
[32:30] spoke to him out of a whirlwind in a
[32:32] tree telling him Don't ever drink or
[32:35] Smoke or defile your body in Any way
[32:38] there Will be a work for you to do when
[32:39] you get
[32:40] older is that Why God would not Let him
[32:43] Die yet was there Still something more
[32:46] For him To accomplish a Tiny flame of
[32:49] hope flickered within his
[32:53] breast on september 1 1939 adolf Hitler
[32:57] ordered his troops to invade poland two
[33:00] days later France and Great Britain
[33:02] declared War on Germany the french
[33:04] immediately attacked Across the rine
[33:06] River along their common Border with
[33:08] Germany but Had difficulty penetrating
[33:10] the stiff German defenses meanwhile
[33:12] poland's caly Core were hopelessly
[33:15] outmatched by germany's mechanicz
[33:17] divisions after Mere 18 days of
[33:20] disastrous fighting poland's government
[33:22] and Military command fled to bordering
[33:24] romania from that Point polish collaps
[33:28] rapidly allowing Germany to concentrate
[33:30] her Energy on the french invasion
[33:33] although France Had hasly retreated from
[33:35] German soil it seemed obvious to most
[33:37] political analyzers that War in europe
[33:39] instead of Being over was Just
[33:42] beginning like everyone Else Who Had
[33:45] access to a radio or newspapers William
[33:47] branam followed this european drama with
[33:49] serious attention however his interest
[33:52] in the War sprang from a completely
[33:54] different
[33:55] perspective this was What he Had seen in
[33:58] june of 1933 when he fell into a trance
[34:01] and watched Seven events roll out before
[34:03] him in a panoramic Vision of the future
[34:06] It was uncanny What kind of Power
[34:09] allowed him to see events before they
[34:11] happened and For what purpose there was
[34:14] that Word Again
[34:16] purpose Maybe God really did have a
[34:19] significant purpose plan for his life If
[34:22] so Why didn't it manifest itself more
[34:26] clearly at this in his thoughts bill's
[34:29] Mind would inevitably drift back to his
[34:31] encounter with the Pentecostal people at
[34:33] mishawaka Indiana two years earlier Bill
[34:36] knew he Had missed god's plan for his
[34:38] life when he Had turned down Those
[34:40] invitations from Pentecostal ministers
[34:42] to evangelize out among their
[34:44] churches How could he get Back into the
[34:47] Will of God Of course he could simply
[34:49] Start visiting Pentecostal churches in
[34:51] hope that some might ask him to preach
[34:54] for them but there was Still One nagging
[34:57] question
[34:58] like a Road block that kept him from
[35:00] following such a Direct rout the
[35:02] question about the gifts of the Holy
[35:04] Spirit specifically the question about
[35:07] Tong and interpretation of
[35:09] Tong by Now Bill felt convinced that
[35:12] tongs and the interpretation of tongs
[35:14] were both genuine gifts of the Spirit of
[35:16] God the Bible seemed Clear Enough on
[35:18] that Point What troubled Bill was his
[35:21] experience at mishawaka with Those two
[35:23] men Who Had been especially active in
[35:25] expressing the gifts of Tong in their
[35:28] interpretations both men Had
[35:30] demonstrated the same powerful
[35:32] manifestations of the Spirit of God in
[35:34] the church service but later When Bill
[35:37] Had talked to each Man Alone he Had seen
[35:40] Straight into their personal lives
[35:42] although One of the men was altogether a
[35:44] dedicated Christian the other Man was
[35:47] absolutely a hypocrite bill knew It was
[35:50] the Truth divisions Never Lied This is
[35:53] What bothered him about the whole
[35:54] Pentecostal idea of allowing gifts of
[35:57] the Spirit
[35:59] to operate openly in Church meetings If
[36:03] that was really the Spirit of God
[36:04] falling in that Pentecostal meeting at
[36:06] mishawaka How could the Spirit of God
[36:09] bless that flagrant hypocrite it did not
[36:12] seem likely but could the Spirit of
[36:15] satan produce the works of God that also
[36:17] seemed doubtful then It was possible
[36:20] that both Spirits could be at work in
[36:22] the same
[36:23] meeting such an idea presented
[36:26] difficulties If Spirit of God and the
[36:28] Spirit of satan produced the same
[36:30] results How can anyone Ever know what
[36:32] was true this puzzle Had troubled him
[36:35] many Times Over The Last two years but
[36:38] now after seeing his Vision of War in
[36:40] europe become a reality Bill felt a
[36:42] renewed urgency to find an answer so
[36:45] that he could put his mistake behind him
[36:47] and Start Again down the path toward
[36:50] Whatever Destiny God Had in Mind God
[36:53] bless you

[54:54] nuestros pensamientos
[54:58] y algo muy importante que les Quiero
[55:02] compartir él no es nuestro
[55:05] amigo él está en contra de
[55:08] nosotros él es nuestro
[55:12] enemigo les quiero dar otra
[55:15] situación el viernes cuando hablé a los
[55:19] jóvenes me gusta usar muchos
[55:25] ejemplos Entonces esta práctica va a ser
[55:27] nada más que
[55:29] ejemplos le voy a pedir a
[55:33] alguien cuando yo les de esta
[55:36] pregunta si serían lo suficiente
[55:39] valiente venir acá y
[55:42] responderme entonces voy a dejar que uno
[55:44] los niños lo
[55:46] haga aquí está la pregunta y la
[55:49] situación estamos aquí en la
[55:52] iglesia yed está caminando allí afuera
[55:57] y y lo vamos a hacer muy
[55:59] interesante usted ve en el
[56:04] piso un
[56:06] iPad un
[56:08] IP está bien no más Usted lo
[56:12] ve Ahora usted lo
[56:15] levanta y ahora aquí está la
[56:18] pregunta qué es lo que usted hace con
[56:22] eso y hay alguien que se quiere levantar
[56:24] y quiere compartir
[56:27] es lo que harían con
[56:31] ell creo que acá tenemos alguien
[56:38] queos prender este
[56:47] micrófono es lo que
[56:51] haces Yo preguntar de
[56:55] es algo
[56:57] más buena
[57:01] respuesta y tengo una segunda parte de
[57:03] esa
[57:04] pregunta esa
[57:08] respuesta es la cosa correcta de hacer
[57:11] una buena cosa de
[57:13] hacer recuerda el juego del
[57:17] opuesto tenemos la cosa buena de
[57:20] hacer pero cuando hay un
[57:23] arriba hay un debajo
[57:26] cuando hay un Bueno hay
[57:31] mal ahora que estás aquí Te quiero
[57:36] preguntar qué sería la cosa equivocada
[57:38] de
[57:40] hacer de quedarse con
[57:42] ella de esconderlo muy rápido ponerlo en
[57:46] tu bolsillo si quedaría en tu bolsillo

[57:51] casa y luego después mirarlo verdad
[57:56] Muchas gracias por su
[57:57] [Aplausos]
[58:04] ayuda ahora la pregunta
[58:08] es de dónde vino ese mal
[58:13] pensamiento dónde vino esa idea
[58:16] equivocada de de
[58:20] esconderla y llevándola por ti mismo
[58:23] estar solo con ello
[58:27] hermanos y
[58:28] hermanas eso es de Satanás
[58:31] eso es del
[58:34] y eso lo que queremos llamar en
[58:36] esta
[58:38] tarde la
[58:40] contienda y la
[58:43] contienda sucede en cada uno de los que
[58:46] estamos
[58:48] aquí en este edici
[58:58] ha cuando Ed vi
[59:01] correctamente el hermano
[59:05] dice más de estos problemas son
[59:08] dirigidos en su
[59:11] camino esto es de cada
[59:14] cristiano que tiene esta
[59:17] batalla y es una
[59:20] escogencia la decisi de hacer cosa
[59:23] correa
[59:26] incorrecta Pero por
[59:29] supuesto tenemos buenos
[59:32] padres padres que atienden a sus niños y
[59:36] que son
[59:37] amorosos que nos traen a la escuela
[59:40] dominical al servicio de los
[59:45] niños de aprender Y siempre hacer las
[59:48] cosas correctas y
[59:50] sabed cuando mayor
[59:56] va olvar de estas
[59:58] cosas usted nunca se va a olvidar de
[1:00:00] estas cosas la
[1:00:04] contienda también el hermano brs dice
[1:00:07] que en este día es
[1:00:11] maligno más que en cualquier otro
[1:00:15] tiempo y los poderes de Satanás
[1:00:18] son difíciles de pelear en contra de ell
[1:00:26] esas decisiones
[1:00:28] correctas y como un
[1:00:30] cristiano yo me he preguntado a m
[1:00:36] mismo Cómo es que me defiendo en contra
[1:00:39] de estos
[1:00:40] pensamientos en contra de estas
[1:00:43] potestades las
[1:00:45] tentaciones las malas
[1:00:47] ideas los pensamientos
[1:00:52] errados y a veces cuando estamos fuera
[1:00:54] de la iglesia
[1:00:58] oyos cosas diferentes de lo que oimos en
[1:01:01] aquí de cuál manera
[1:01:05] voy voy de la manera que me dicen mis
[1:01:08] amigos de lo que oigo en la
[1:01:13] escuela voy a ir con lo que oigo los
[1:01:17] domingos qué Estoy escuchando de mis
[1:01:20] padres
[1:01:31] y para ver si estoy en la misma página
[1:01:33] con todos los
[1:01:34] demás Hay un
[1:01:38] niño un hombre joven una niña le
[1:01:42] gustaría
[1:01:43] subir
[1:01:49] yc es la manera que usted sei en contra
[1:01:52] de estos pensamientos
[1:01:55] encantaría escuchar
[1:01:57] eso Si alguien le gustaría
[1:02:00] venir Si no seguiros
[1:02:05] adelante está
[1:02:08] bien Aquí tengo unas cosas unas
[1:02:16] prendas y dentro de esa
[1:02:20] bolsa yo tengo unas armas
[1:02:27] y aquí está
[1:02:28] una está
[1:02:30] bien y para qué se usan las
[1:02:35] armas para protegerte para la
[1:02:39] defensa a m me gusta sacar esta por
[1:02:42] primero porque
[1:02:45] esta sabemos que le pertenece a a una
[1:02:49] niña y estas niñas se necesitan
[1:02:52] protegerse a sí mismas
[1:02:56] y a veces son más valientes que nosotros
[1:02:58] los
[1:03:00] muchachos está
[1:03:02] bien pero es Es la
[1:03:05] verdad necesitamos armas para
[1:03:07] defendernos
[1:03:08] cuando estamos en
[1:03:11] problemas y voy a sacar más armas y Lu
[1:03:14] voy a hacer la
[1:03:16] pregunta si usted me
[1:03:19] diría Qué tipo de persona usa Estas
[1:03:22] armas está bien
[1:03:30] Aquí está otra
[1:03:31] arma quién usaría esta
[1:03:36] arma
[1:03:44] cualquiera usar esta
[1:03:47] ara Un indio
[1:03:49] verdad para cazar su comida proteger su
[1:03:53] familia
[1:03:56] una arma que un indio
[1:03:58] usaría los vaqueros y los
[1:04:01] indios un poco más
[1:04:04] moderno no el nombre de la
[1:04:10] muchacha era arma
[1:04:12] que ahora voy a intentar
[1:04:19] otra usara este tipo de arma
[1:04:29] a veo
[1:04:32] Sam ya s que le parezco una espada de
[1:04:37] ninja tal de un caballero é usa una
[1:04:41] espada uno de los Caballeros de la mesa
[1:04:44] del Rey
[1:04:46] Arturo para defenderte una arma ahora
[1:04:49] una vez una otra
[1:05:00] Pero quién usaría este esta
[1:05:07] arma una arma que un J usa para
[1:05:10] defenderse
[1:05:17] bueno sabe usted que como
[1:05:21] cristianos nosotros tenemos armas
[1:05:27] nosotros tenemos armas que usamos para
[1:05:28] defendernos en contra del enemigo Y
[1:05:31] quién es nuestro
[1:05:35] enemigo es nuestro hermano y hermana que
[1:05:37] está a nuestro lado no es Satanás
[1:05:41] esos diablos esos
[1:05:45] pensamientos Entonces como un
[1:05:48] cristiano Dios nos está dando
[1:05:51] armas para defendernos en contra de
[1:05:54] ellos
[1:05:59] y yo no quiero mencionar tres cosas
[1:06:04] que armas más
[1:06:07] grandes en el
[1:06:10] mundo que Dios ha puesto en nuestras
[1:06:14] manos
[1:06:16] de la
[1:06:24] oración Biblia la palabra de Dios sus
[1:06:30] promesas y hemos escuchado de estas
[1:06:34] verdad Pero usted pensado de estas como
[1:06:39] armas son
[1:06:42] armas y Dios nos las ha
[1:06:45] dado y con esas tres armas nuestro
[1:06:50] gran y gran
[1:06:53] conquistador derrotó a Satanás
[1:06:57] y todos sus
[1:06:58] poderes y están en nuestras
[1:07:02] manos y quién es nuestro gran y poderoso
[1:07:07] conquistador el señor
[1:07:10] Jesucristo y yo tengo una tarea para
[1:07:13] cada uno de
[1:07:15] ustedes y lamento que también se voy a
[1:07:18] dar a los
[1:07:20] padres
[1:07:24] sied
[1:07:26] Jesucristo derrotó a Satanás
[1:07:28] con esas tres
[1:07:32] armas Yo pienso que usted debería ir con
[1:07:34] sus padres y
[1:07:36] preguntarles Cómo es que el señor
[1:07:39] Jesucristo derrotó a Satanás
[1:07:41] con esas tres
[1:07:46] armas Yo pienso que sería una buena
[1:07:49] conversación de
[1:07:50] tener bien
[1:07:57] Yo sé que en la
[1:07:59] Ramada hay un
[1:08:02] una una una cadena de
[1:08:05] tiempo del hermano
[1:08:07] bram y como dije está en la
[1:08:10] Ramada dibujos
[1:08:12] maravillosos fotos
[1:08:16] maravillosas de las diferentes etapas de
[1:08:19] la vida del hermano
[1:08:20] bran y la escuela
[1:08:24] dominical loer en el campamento de la
[1:08:27] juventud y son muy
[1:08:30] interesantes yo disfruté de verlas
[1:08:32] Cuando la vi la semana
[1:08:34] [Música]
[1:08:36] pasada y usted si le gustaría yo le
[1:08:39] sugiero que vaya después de servicio las
[1:08:41] vea y luego el hermano
[1:08:47] Hol el trabajo maravilloso que él hace
[1:08:49] de hablar del hermano branam a
[1:08:52] nosotros de la historia de su vida
[1:08:56] en los libros
[1:08:59] sobrenaturales Entonces yo no más quiero
[1:09:01] dar unos cuantos
[1:09:04] ejemplos del amor siendo
[1:09:06] desplegado por el hermano
[1:09:10] branam recuerde es una de las armas más
[1:09:14] grandiosas que tenemos en nuestras
[1:09:17] manos Ahora yo no puedo contar no puedo
[1:09:20] decir un cuento como el hermano
[1:09:22] bran Entonces vamos a dejar que él lo
[1:09:24] diga
[1:09:25] Pero antes de hacer eso le quiero dar la
[1:09:29] escena y la primera parte
[1:09:32] es que él brevemente habla de su
[1:09:37] experiencia con un hombre que quería
[1:09:39] atacarlo a
[1:09:40] él que quería matar el hermano
[1:09:44] branam é continúa en la
[1:09:49] historia de un testimonio que él estaba
[1:09:52] en el patio de atrás cortando su pasto
[1:09:55] y él pegó una
[1:09:56] caja y dentro de esta
[1:09:59] caja era muchas
[1:10:02] abejas y se empezaron a
[1:10:06] emocionar y la siguiente
[1:10:10] parte es cuando el hermano branam tiene
[1:10:12] el encuentro con el
[1:10:15] toro y es cuando voy a dejar que hermano
[1:10:18] bram diga la
[1:10:21] historia si pueden prender este
[1:10:23] micrófono

[1:14:06] todo mi alrededor y en vez de estar
[1:14:08] asustado yo tuve amor por esas abispas
[1:14:11] ahora Eso suena ridículo pero es la
[1:14:13] verdad algo sucedió y yo pensé
[1:14:16] Pobrecitos tal vez estaban tomando una
[1:14:19] siesta y yo fui y los disturb y les
[1:14:22] pegué así y ellos En verdad estaban en
[1:14:25] serio ellos estaban al todo mi alrededor
[1:14:27] y yo detuve mi máquina de cortar el
[1:14:29] pasto y dije lo lamento mis pequeños

[1:15:28] tráiganme hasta 20 ent Ah dejen que se
[1:15:31] alíen ahí si es que desean hasta el 20
[1:15:34] ahora note el gran toro corrió en el en
[1:15:38] el campo un día para quitarme la vida y
[1:15:40] ahí yo estaba y no había manera de que
[1:15:44] yo me podía escapar de él y en vez de
[1:15:46] asustarme me dio lástima por el animal y
[1:15:49] él corrió hacia unos pies enfrente de mí
[1:15:52] él acaba de matar un hombre de color
[1:15:54] allá en el rancho de berks hace dos
[1:15:57] meses y yo dije tu creador es mi amoroso
[1:16:01] Salvador y yo no te estoy molestando Yo
[1:16:04] estoy en una misión de cruzar este campo
[1:16:06] y ahora en el nombre de nuestro creador
[1:16:08] el Señor Jesús tu ve allá y acuéstate
[1:16:11] debajo de ese árbol y él corrió hasta
[1:16:15] llegar cinco pies enfrente de mí se
[1:16:17] detuvo mi se miró tan cansado y exhausto
[1:16:23] él miró hacia la derecha la izquierda
[1:16:24] ierda se dio La media vuelta y caminó y
[1:16:28] se acostó debajo del árbol Eso es
[1:16:30] correcto me dio lástima por él y le amé
[1:16:33] eso es exactamente correcto ahora Eso
[1:16:36] suena ridículo pero déjame decirle
[1:16:39] hermano que cuando San Pablo el apóstol
[1:16:42] cuando la serpiente lo agarró y lo
[1:16:44] mordió en la mano él lo pudo decir Oh
[1:16:47] Agárrame la la idona o la
[1:16:50] medicina eso Tal vez le había dolido
[1:16:53] Pero él esta tan cargado con el espíritu
[1:16:55] santo que él no más lo miró sin estar
[1:16:58] asustado Y no más lo sacudió hasta que
[1:17:02] fue echado al fuego y
[1:17:13] siguió la razón que compartí esa
[1:17:18] parte yo creo que o yo siento que el
[1:17:22] hermano branam es nuestro ejemplo
[1:17:24] aquí en la
[1:17:26] tierra él hizo esas cosas
[1:17:29] imposibles pero no era el hombre pero
[1:17:32] sino Dios en el
[1:17:34] hombre y
[1:17:36] él es hijo del
[1:17:39] rey y nosotros somos hijos del
[1:17:44] rey y nosotros tenemos esa misma
[1:17:46] habilidad como el hermano
[1:17:51] branam de hacer algo tan loco así como
[1:17:54] lo dijo
[1:17:57] é para disculparse con una con un montón
[1:18:00] de abejas
[1:18:02] enojadas decirle lo
[1:18:06] siento y ellos Sencillamente no más
[1:18:08] regresaron a lo que estaban haciendo
[1:18:10] antes qué tan loco es eso verdad Pero
[1:18:14] sucedió él es nuestro
[1:18:18] ejemplo y yo creo que el mismo Espíritu
[1:18:20] Santo en ese
[1:18:22] hombre está en nosotros
[1:18:25] y nosotros tenemos eso
[1:18:28] también la victoria a través del señor
[1:18:33] Jesucristo una más y
[1:18:37] cerraré quiero hablar sobre la
[1:18:39] oración el poder de la
[1:18:44] oración her atrás
[1:18:58] me recuerdo trabajando con con hera y
[1:19:01] hermana
[1:19:02] Romero gente
[1:19:04] maravillosa
[1:19:09] cristianos y era un honor para m para
[1:19:11] estar con
[1:19:13] ellos y no s si ustedes
[1:19:17] sepan pero el hermano estaba muy
[1:19:21] enfermo el lo tenía
[1:19:26] que no lo
[1:19:31] soltaba la fuerza de nuestro señor
[1:19:35] Jesús y no solamente esa fuerza del
[1:19:37] espíritu santo pero la
[1:19:40] oración de su
[1:19:43] mamá de esta iglesia de nuestros
[1:19:48] Santos esos Guerreros de la oración que
[1:19:50] tenemos
[1:19:55] viéndolo
[1:19:59] ahí es exactamente la misma cosa que
[1:20:02] oimos del hermano
[1:20:05] br tal vez pensamos que esto es un
[1:20:07] cuento de
[1:20:09] historia Esto aconteció hace 60 50 años
[1:20:14] y lo siempre lo
[1:20:17] oyos el señor Jesucristo mismo Ayer hoy
[1:20:20] por todos los
[1:20:22] siglos ahora est
[1:20:26] el hermano l estaba enfermo el año
[1:20:29] pasado este
[1:20:32] año estamos viviendo en la
[1:20:35] presencia El poder del señor Aún es el
[1:20:38] mismo tenemos la fe y
[1:20:42] sabemos que es más
[1:20:44] fuerte que el espíritu que está en el
[1:20:47] mundo eso es lo que nos dice la palabra
[1:20:51] la tercera parte nos da la fuerza esa
[1:20:55] fuerza para seguir
[1:20:58] adelante y nosotros no sabemos cómo es
[1:21:01] que vamos a
[1:21:04] continuar usted sabe lo que traerá
[1:21:06] mañana no tenemos
[1:21:10] idea hablé con de esto a los jóvenes el
[1:21:13] viernes
[1:21:14] También los niños en el mar rojo ellos
[1:21:18] estaban fuera de
[1:21:19] Egipto estaban cara a cara con el mar
[1:21:23] rojo y detrás de ellos los egipcios
[1:21:27] estaban viniendo a
[1:21:29] matarlos y suena un poco como hoy
[1:21:33] no tenemos cosas difíciles delante de
[1:21:36] nosotros que tenemos que
[1:21:39] encarar el testimonio del él lo tenía
[1:21:43] que
[1:21:43] encarar Y cómo es que iba a salir de
[1:21:50] eso ent cuando eso sucedió con los hijos
[1:21:53] de Israel el hermano Brown dice todo lo
[1:21:56] que todo lo que ellos hicieron y dice
[1:21:59] Señor yo creo en
[1:22:02] ti no sé cómo me vas a sacar de
[1:22:05] esto y saben qué Qué
[1:22:09] sucedió él abrió el mar
[1:22:12] rojo Cómo es que lo hizo saben
[1:22:16] qué no es para que entendamos
[1:22:19] nosotros no es para que
[1:22:22] sepamos es el negocio de Dios
[1:22:25] de abrir el mar
[1:22:27] rojo Qué difícil es eso de abrir Ese
[1:22:32] mar el hermano me dio un ejemplo allí
[1:22:37] atrás pudiera levantar a todos los
[1:22:40] millones arriba del mar Pero la palabra
[1:22:44] nos
[1:22:45] dice de seguir caminando
