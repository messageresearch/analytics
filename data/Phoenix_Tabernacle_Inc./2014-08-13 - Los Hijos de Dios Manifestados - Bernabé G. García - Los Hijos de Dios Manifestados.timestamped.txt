[3:26] this message is a bilingual message
[3:28] interpreted by brother james garcia
[3:32] you may be seated
[3:58] god
[4:39] we realize that this is the most
[4:41] precious precious time that has ever
[4:43] been in mankind
[4:48] all those men of times past have waited
[4:50] for this day
[4:54] and even you yourself
[5:22] in the name of our
[5:36] the first chapter which is three to five
[5:43] we welcome each and every one of you
[5:44] this morning
[5:49] i believe that you've come to honor
[6:05] ephesians chapter one verses three to
[6:18] five
[6:20] blessed be the god and father of our
[6:23] lord jesus christ
[6:24] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[6:27] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[6:46] that we should be holy and without blame
[6:49] before him in love
[7:31] this morning i'm going to entitle our
[7:33] message
[7:34] manifested sons of god
[8:18] like the most privileged people that
[8:20] should ever walk the face of the earth
[8:34] when we see that his son the lord jesus
[8:37] christ
[8:37] gave his life went to calvary shed his
[8:40] blood
[8:41] so that we might be partakers of the
[8:43] lord jesus christ
[8:52] and we see that the blood of jesus
[8:53] christ his son
[8:55] cleanses us from all sin
[9:06] we see and know that the blood of jesus
[9:08] christ
[9:09] which he was of his son jesus christ who
[9:12] she said was necessary
[9:14] so that we might be presented blameless
[9:16] and accessible before him
[9:30] we also see and know that it is not the
[9:34] blood
[10:01] even before anything or anything at all
[10:05] ever came into manifestation
[10:10] god chose us to be his children
[10:16] even before
[10:41] drop of blood
[11:07] no wonder the apostles said we are saved
[11:11] by grace
[11:54] our position
[12:05] then can adoption comes
[12:21] who he is
[13:16] but it's something that god has done for
[13:18] your
[13:45] and we think maybe we
[15:10] um
[15:52] having made known unto us the mystery of
[15:55] his will
[16:01] according to his good pleasure which he
[16:05] has purposed in himself
[16:46] it's a mystery
[17:02] might not
[17:13] because we are all part of one body
[17:57] am i searching
[18:01] where are my glasses oh here they are
[18:05] where do we search
[18:09] in the world do we search in the
[18:12] denomination
[18:26] for
[18:43] now tell me my brother tell me my sister
[18:46] when
[18:46] was the time that the sons of god was
[18:49] ever to be manifested outside of this
[18:51] time
[18:58] when was there ever a time in history
[19:01] when
[19:01] they were that that manifest time to
[19:04] deliver
[19:05] all nature
[19:34] jesus christ died for us
[20:17] and the holy ghost hadn't been
[20:31] you are a child of god
[20:39] in the time of lutheran foreign
[21:12] the coming of the lord
[21:25] just waiting for the church to
[21:28] positionally
[21:40] but how many believe that the head has
[21:42] already come
[22:09] you put a body on it
[22:22] our part of that body
[23:15] the body automatically moves
[23:18] with the head is that right all
[23:32] when that thought of god was expressed
[23:48] is
[24:29] that's what the manifestation
[24:42] i know that's the way you want me to do
[24:44] it that's your divine
[24:46] will yes it's your
[24:49] order that's the order of the day
[24:58] in quebec
[25:03] is to let the people positionally find
[25:05] their place and be ready for the hour of
[25:07] battle
[25:09] for the people to fight
[25:54] whatever we're
[26:08] each and
[26:22] his father

[31:14] this church has a pastor is that right
[31:45] to ask him is that right
[31:49] how do you do you look at it
[31:54] he came by the saxophone player
[32:12] we're going to
[32:52] the son of god

[33:44] well i'm gonna go on whether you tell me
[33:47] to stop or not
[34:04] for the father that is
[34:07] almost equal with you we serve the
[34:09] father if we understand that we are
[34:10] children of god
[34:14] let's look at ephesians one night
[34:46] of the fullness of times he might gather
[34:49] together
[34:49] in one all things in christ both which
[34:52] are in heaven
[34:53] and which are on earth even in him
[34:58] see he purposes the
[35:42] what is it
[36:10] how will
[36:52] whose body my friend is here can someone
[36:55] tell me
[37:00] already judged everything with you
[37:03] he took our judgment and told us
[37:34] you heard
[38:17] also we have obtained an inheritance
[38:21] being predestinated according to the
[38:22] purpose of him who work us
[38:24] all things after the council of his own
[38:26] will
[38:30] tremendously
[39:10] and put your name on the lamb's book of
[39:40] we've obtained
[39:54] this is tremendous
[40:36] he had a more
[40:48] jesus christ
[41:59] but through the blood of jesus christ
[42:26] and put your name there too i probably
[43:10] foreign
[43:37] they're going to realize
[44:29] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[44:31] worship him
[44:33] whose names are not written in the book
[44:36] of life
[44:37] of the lamb flame from the foundation of
[44:39] the world
[44:41] the prophet says
[44:45] jesus never left us and inherited
[45:02] and he brought
[45:13] from before the foundation of the world
[45:45] for 15 years
[45:49] but when i saw that the book is the land
[45:55] the lamb didn't give me my inheritance
[45:58] who gave me
[46:26] is
[47:22] this is an
[47:33] you you put yourself into
[47:50] is
[48:46] is
[49:14] foreign
[49:28] foreign
[49:41] i understand that
[50:09] for he has not received the spirit of
[50:12] bondage again
[50:13] to fear but he have received a spirit of
[50:15] adoption whereby
[50:16] we cry
[50:23] i don't know what to do because
[50:38] the
[51:06] there are people that
[51:32] which is
[51:47] many people come here
[52:16] my father
[52:30] who
[52:42] you are a son of god
[52:58] with our spirit that we are the children
[53:00] of god he's the ego
[53:02] and his children
[53:06] heirs of god are the children of god
[53:24] heirs of god
[53:41] together
[53:50] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[53:53] present time
[53:54] are not worthy to be compared with the
[53:56] glory which shall be revealed in him
[54:05] for the earnest expectation of the
[54:08] creature
[54:08] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[54:11] of god

[55:22] that he might be the first
[55:23] born among many brothers

[56:58] predestinated according to
[57:00] the purpose of him who worketh all
[57:02] things after the counsel of his own will
[57:10] wishes that we should be to the praise
[57:13] of his glory
