chapter 20 i'm sorry 16. john 16 verses 20 and 21 we're going to continue and finish off today with birth pains okay this will be number three the third time i speak on it i can't go any further on it and just if i don't finish that's okay we just need to we'll go to something else but while you're finding that um and i'm speaking these comments uh we're going to be praying in just a little bit so john 16 verse 20 okay let us pray heavenly father lord we come before you you lord humbly asking you to be with us this morning lord may what we say and what we do lord be pleasing unto you our time is limited here on earth lord and our time is limited here we're we're in a rat race lord and you know that already and there's no need for us to tell you you know the condition of the world what we ask you lord is like the song says to be like jesus whatever you know that we're lacking lord just add it to us a little bit more and more and more father we just let us stay humble before you so you can add to what we need to add lord as peter said when we have this add this to that and add that to that whatever we're lacking lord you know our situation lord we all we do is surrender ourselves to you lord and you help us we ask you in the name of the lord jesus christ did you bless each person here this morning may they understand just a little bit of the word we ask you these things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen before i read the scripture i want to make just one quick comment and that is that as i said to you last time my focus from now on in my ministry is not to try to bring anything new nothing outstanding is just to be provoke each one like the scripture says encourage one another with these words for you to go into the message and study the message more that's all that's that's my from now now it's going to be my entire goal and i'm going to be focusing on the young people and because of one one main reason i hate what satan is doing to the young people educationally right now they're they're stealing our books their uh sister how many of you teachers here no they're taking things out of our history books raise your hand you teachers raise your hand there's a teacher back there any other teachers we have here this morning yes thank you you know you know they're taking things from our history we're gonna we're gonna see that uh we saw that sunday night those of you that were here since 1934 they're no longer talk about the miraculous savings uh how god miraculously saved how many were here sunday night raise your hand say amen if you learned a little bit something about george washington yeah we we learned that since 1934 they no longer put that part in there where those bullets went through him that's been taken out 1934 80 years ago they took that out of there so i'm angry at satan and i'm angry at his bride you know who she is right if i say it i'm going to start saying some bad words to some of you and you're going to be scandalized and i don't want to say that i'm angry at the rcc because she is satan's agent on earth and she's been attacking the united states in 1770 something and actually we want to look at it since 1620 that scripture told brother man told us last week or the first the sec second birth pains number two when we talked about the compound fulfillment of the scripture how many remember that that she fled to the wilderness was with she had twins of an eagle so when did the pilgrims come to america 1620 and in the sardis age god did a little maneuvering under satan's nose but she's been after them since since then that's another study altogether which we'll get to that maybe next year on jezebel religion and you'll understand why i'm angry at that and i'll give you just two little pointers one of them is they're attacking george washington that that he is not a christian in our history books and number two they're starting to call it and this i hope i don't lose it because i love that man love my heart abraham lincoln now they're saying in their history books that he was a homosexual that's what they're teaching your children brothers and sisters parents open up your eyes and your ears for the scripture says he that has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit speaks unto the church now brother ernie it's right there in our message i'm angry at what they're doing to america i'm angry for those that hate america because israel america the united states parallels israel and when you hate america god's country i'll say it like that you are hating israel it's parallel i wasn't going to say all this i need to shut my mouth because i'm limited on time so let's just get to this see we have i wanted to finish birth pains in one setting one talk i said wow i can't do that i need two nope need three i can't go any further so i'm going to go into read the scripture and i'm going to go through the this is going to be a sunday school lesson let's read the scripture and then you can see you may be seated i apologize for keeping you standing and thank you for the music or we're done thank you very much i love that song to be like jesus if you can forget about your job forget about your car forget about your whatever forget about your this that forget about everything uh brother branham said this and in god's power to transform in prescott arizona he said the most important thing in life is to get ready to meet god that's the most important thing in in life get ready to meet god he will not accept anything i accept the blood of the lord jesus christ i want to be under the blood i don't care what's happening around me i want to be under the blood praise god verily verily i say to you that you shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned to into joy thank you lord a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man or child is born into the world you may be seated jesus here brother baby tells us speaking here as he said you will have sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned to joy speaking of his disciples here knowing that the birth of christianity was coming into existence and now the old has to die in order that the newest born have anything that gives birth has to have pains of distress now we have i want like i said i wanted to do talk bring it into three group into three talks introduction and and the work pains that the world goes through number two the birth pains that israel had to produce the lord jesus christ eventually and the church ages that the church ages had in order to eventually produce the son of man and then this age and the individual this age has birth pains and then the church the the bride itself has birth pains to produce the bride itself the lord jesus christ in each and every one of the believers even with each member of the bride then the individual will have birth pains as it transitions from this old stinky filthy pest house into its new body woo that is beautiful now uh see that was your three goals now the first in birth pain is number one we learned the following as far as the world producing a new world there will be a new avenue a new a new heaven and new earth that it has to go through birth pains and it's going to hit has to go through birth pains just to be able to clean up the earth a little bit for the millennium to take place does that make sense then it has to go through another birth pains and burning up for it for for it to be a fit place as brother man said for heaven to come down here on earth for the new jerusalem to come down okay and uh so the birth pain number one was world war one you can see it reverse the world war ii was another birth pain that's what we learned the first time and then the brother man said it cannot take a third birth pain it'll throw it out into space he said can't take it it's the third world war is what's going to bring things to a battle uh conclusion and one of them that's horrible is just a battle of armageddon i don't have a brother theologian brother of mine that's he talks about the war of armageddon yeah it is the war of armageddon and there's a con there's a battle of armageddon and there's a war of megiddo tapped off by the battle of megiddo does this make sense to you kind of sort of if not then you can go back and listen to you don't want to listen to me listen to what the pope says listen to these other guys they're saying hey it sounds like world war three is already started is that right how many of you heard them say that already so so um anyway so that's that's what we learned in the world in birth pain number one birth pain number two we learned the following that every scripture and prophecy most all of it has a compound or multiple meaning israel and then brother also we learned that number two last time is that israel had seven church ages two and typed exactly not almost not kind of sort of exactly with these it's it's history repeating itself and we found out that in thyatira if you want to go to what i'm saying these comments go to go to revelations chapter 2 verse 20. i think it is somewhere in there we learned in that in thyatira god raised up a virgin just just starting to eat just talking just very lit very very simply and comparing jezebel and that's the next study i want to get into when i talk about abraham lincoln and and george washington it's the title of the study is going to be just about religion okay and i don't want to get into that because it's we'll be losing time here but i just showed that that in the time of elijah they had a jezebel and an ahab on the throne is that right and she was the really run she really was the one that ran the show that's what brother brown said she was the one that was the head behind the head so to speak and uh but at that time over there in in in israel over here in the ant the antitype is the church you have a jezebel on the throne also during tyra is that right how many of you studied that some church agents can say amen to they know that's true some of you know that that's good all right and so here's what we're in tyra let's let let's look at that together you can look up here read with me it's silent if you want if you want to read our lives you can if you want to and thyatira god raised up a virgin a prophetess to fight the great harlot that's jezebel the false prophetess the maiden was joan of ark now let's look at the scripture i'll read it from the scripture maybe a little bit different than what's there because i'm reading from the um the newer king james what it's called easy reading something like that easy reading king james it says that and he's uh revelation 22 20 says the following notwithstanding i have a few things against you because you permit that woman jezebel which calls herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eating sacrifice to idols isn't that incredible not beautiful they type exactly these and we're going to see that a little bit i can talk about that later and and and just for you to understand and you can't see it here because of the uh the way it's blowing up here on this on the screen i have these these uh the scripture that's my fault huh yes it is it's my fault you we see here that uh thyatira which read the scripture the thyatira brother brahm tells us in the exposition of seven church churches that thyatira means dominating female and when he preaches the seven church ages in the revelation jesus christ book he says that thyatira means laxed loose or hazy like you know you can't make it out it's really kind of diatoma also means odor of affliction that's the strongest concordance and then other theologians say it means semi-ramas and if it doesn't mean anything to you then all you have to do is go read the title of how many raise your hand have you ever heard brother brad mentioned his slaps two babylons raise your hand nice and high okay in there brother branham says that the uh in his slop dr histop entitles it to babylons or the subtitle is uh the papacy proven to be the worship of nimrod and his wife and what was his wife's name sammy ramis she was both his mother and his wife that's perversion brother ernie yeah that's what it is that's what the papacy is brother ernie aren't you ashamed too afraid to speak like that behind the pulpit no what can they do is shoot me so let him shoot me i'd love that my brother man i'd love to be standing behind the pope and i'd love to go in the pulpit but one of the one of these theologians on the on the internet they bring all these things out they said no what it really means tyra really means is semiramis the wife of nimrod i go yes thank you it's all tied together okay now you say out of brother ernie i don't understand a word you're saying well that's what i'm encouraging you to do go study go read his slops two babylons brother benue said read islam's two babylonians you'll get great light that's what he said read his love's too bad i'm not mad at you i'm not mad i'm gonna take the stops i cool down i'm not mad at you i'm just saying what he said he said re i'll say it calmly like he said it read his steps to babylon's you'll get great light so if you want to get great light go read histograms is it going to be overnight reading no it's going to take you a few weeks to get through it maybe a couple months okay now let's let's get into um i'm not sure how we got that far but let's let's go back to uh i have to look around for this because this is seems like something's out of border out of sequence well i'm looking for scissors there's three stages of journey let's go there not sure brother you can help me back there there's a there's a slide on my numbering um well we just read that let's go back to that scripture i'll do it i'll do it from here brother you're getting a good uh review of what i'm i'm here we go um on the next slide you're gonna see that we have we learned we're still get we're still barely uh reviewing let's go to the next one we're really now barely reviewing let's go to the four foundations brother i think we're fighting each other right now okay we we learned last bp two on birth pains number two we also those of you that were here remember that brother bam said that there were four foundations remember that that was when he was building the the masterpiece it's not my title that's another message you need to go study the masterpiece can't say everything in one time just in three minutes one minute but when when when brother madam is when the lord jesus christ when god is starting off with israel to produce the great masterpiece which is the head stone jesus christ he has to start off with the foundation for his great masterpiece and brother bravo said that that every masterpiece is just set up on on a foundation and he said that the foundation were the patriarchs and these are the four patriarchs abraham was faith brotherhood said isaac was love jacob was grace joseph was perfection now if you want to look at it from another point of view also remember brother ban said every prophecy every scripture has a compound fulfillment if you want to look at it from the standpoint of when god appears to moses god appears to moses and he said who are you and he says i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob you want to stay just with that he said i am the god of faith love and grace okay but let's look at it from this other perspective let's look it from jesus's first doctrine okay jesus first doctrine was the new birth is that right so he's saying i am the god of justification sanctification and then your birth and then the perfection doesn't mention joseph he says i'm just god of the i am the god of the new birth you want to look at it like that okay but it has to be a foundation and there's a foundation that he that he sets up then the next thing we see is uh the foundation this is the mask this is the masterpiece god's building through seven church ages to israel say israel so okay thank you so he's building up israel through uh seven church ages is that right israel has seven churches raise your hand if you remember we said that that brother bradley said that okay he has seven churches so they haven't said they have seven church ages but he has to have a foundation for that masterpiece for the head jesus to come down you can see how beautiful it is in a little bit it's just they they type perfectly okay so that's the the masterpiece and today's goal i want you i want you i want to do it over here on this side today's goal if i can do it this way today's goal is to finish number two because we didn't finish number two last time and talk about the birth page that israel has and the seven church ages had then we're going to get into the birth pains number three this age and the individual and i can say here today's goal finished two and three this is our last talk on bp3 if i don't finish number three sorry i'm sorry well i'll lose i'll let loose some things here and there next year remember i spoke on birth pains this is another part of that and if it fits okay but that's our goal okay um and so now we come up to here that if you remember in the in the pyramid you just saw there's the foundation exactly is that correct uh four patriarchs you have abraham isaac and jacob and joseph jacob and joseph go to is to egypt is that correct yes or no this is joseph is in charge he's a big he's he's the big guy in charge of and he brings jacob to him right and then he tells him hey guys when you leave here make sure you take my mummy with you you know take me with you i want to i want to be buried over there in palestine where the resurrection is going to be where the rapture is going to be you know and so uh here's here's so so you can see that israel also had a foundation foundation of the apostle of the patriarchs then they have their justification sanctification and new birth also all right so let's read that right now let's read read along with me please there's there's three stages to their journey of their journey they left egypt justification believe in the word they separated themselves from the egyptians and came and come out they cross the red sea that's the blood and kill the things behind me which was sanctification through the blood that kills all human desires of evil the second stage of the journey but the third stage was when they crossed jordan isn't that beautiful what is jordan it's death is that right i don't want to appreciate it but that's death is that right when did it cross it when it was the most impossible it was in april which is a new year yes or no this shall be the new month of years to you nissan april brother man said it was just flooded over snow is melting up at mount hermon the top how mount hermann the jordan river starts to flow and this southerly flow but then where does it go it starts christmas being heads to the galilee in galilee then then the flood goes then it fills the red sea it can't go any further south it can't go any further south the dead sea is its mouth the dead sea is a smile you wanna you want a confirmation that jordan is death where does the flow hoarders that eventually end up in the dead sea it's the lowest river in the world i sang that song but i'm not complaining brothers i sang that song the lord gave it to me very few people understood it okay but the third stage when they cross jordan into the promised land in to the promised land this is the promised land the land flowing with milk and honey the holy spirit here on earth then the holy spirit comes down and encapsulates that it caps it off now as far as like i said before here's the masterpiece everybody agree with me this is what brother branham how brother banham said preached it he said they had the foundations of the patriarchs is that correct and then he said that the body and that message the masterpiece says the body comprise or make up the the body of this masterpiece was made up by the prophets the body but then what was the head the lord jesus christ okay which is a beautiful thing but in here right in here you got justification sanctification and and the new birth taking you into here's where now you're in the new the new land canaan land the land of promise where their inheritance laid if i that's what it says they go into the promised land where their inheritance laid some of you say dog brother and you got it all turned around no israel is born as a as a church when it comes out of egypt ecclesia called out is that correct how many you know brother man said church means called out raise your hand church means called out when were they called out when they were called out of egypt what did they become a church a wandering church i was going to sing a special they might as well sing it to you the the chorus anyway the bride is going to their heavenly home never more to like pilgrims roam that's what they were doing pilgrims roaming over this way enough let's go this way pillar fire go there good 40 years in the wilderness because of their disobedience they could have done it in 30 days or something like that that's that's where we're at so that's the that's the masterpiece now i'd like to say this brother says i'd like to say this that this is beautiful it starts it starts getting gooder and gooder this is i'd like to say this that this book of ephesians perfectly parallels the old testament joshua ephesians the book of ephesians now if you look at the new the new uh what it called the new title everybody read with me here what is the title here adoption number one what was its original title ephesians parallels joshua that beautiful those of you that are that are comparing already in your mind the the two church ate the two pyramids israel seminar changes and if you're there and the seven church ages for the gentile church if you're already paralleling them in your mind that that's what i'm talking to right now and if you're not start thinking about that start keeping the two in your mind okay another thing he says about about joshua in ephesians this is in paradox 1965 he says i think this book of joshua did i read the other one entirely let me go back to that so i can read it at least i'd like to say this that this book of ephesians perfectly parallels the old testament joshua ephesians the book of ephesians and then in 65 that's in 1960. in 1965 brother man says i think this book of joshua fits a fitting word for it would be the book of ephesians of the old testament the book of ephesians of the old testament would be a good thing to title this book of joshua because it's certainly fitting to this to what okay let's see what he says continue so ephesians back to adoption number one so ephesians here sets up like joshua positionally you notice joshua after crossing the jordan he divided the land each of those hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study simeon simeone oh simeon what hearing you heard me god you heard my cry and you gave me another child i don't know if it's dan or one of them said oh man oh this is a hard one feels like an army i feel like i'm giving birth to an army so she names him that name uh not dan that means judgment but i think maybe dan i don't know which one it is one of them is like an army the names each name meant something okay it's oh she said uh let's finish reading that she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study so i present it to you study it out study what the names of the twelve patriarchs are studying for a brother basis bro i could take you right for joseph he says i could take you joseph and show you exactly where it is in the united states wow i i've looked i can't find it yet i'll find this on me if the lord if it's in the message i'll find i gotta find the rebel tim is there he says in ephraim i think it's ephraim where he has his feet dipped in oil all you have to do is find out where ephraim is start drinking drink drilling there except they're you know they're giving away land for peace is that right what a horrible evil demon satan is it's a good adversary though it's taken away the land where they can even can't even drill foil they give away land for peace do they get peace no pieces of missiles coming at them but they don't get any peace sheesh it's a great study now so far we've talked about uh the the positioning of of of the the the um of the patriarchs in in the the land of israel okay let's look at israel and her birth pains okay and i'm going to start just reading as much as fast as i can and that's all i want to do is read from now on israel had birth pains under every prophet that came to the earth she had birth pains at his message for what did it do the prophet had the word so therefore when god sent a prophet the church itself went into birth pains because the prophet the word of the lord comes to the prophet him only he she had birth pains why she she's bringing a little bit more of the word what are they trying to produce finally the messiah the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us they knew he was coming behold the virgin shall conceive is that right this is this is not gonna happen until shino comes they're all reporting looking i just gotta shut up i've just gotta read because i'm not running out of time now the she that's israel brought forth this complete word which was made flesh under birth pains of the prophet that blasted out he's a coming he's a coming pointing to that just i should have read it instead of saying commented till finally who's the seventh messenger to israel to their layuri saiyan naked miserable wretched church age who was there elijah who was their seventh church's message messenger i just gave it away say it to me nice and loud elijah call william branham no call what john the baptist is john the baptist center as a forgotten it's like brother bernie was saying when i was sitting last wednesday night he says i've only got one door left to me open said brother branham that's phoenix arizona is that right god said to him what is that to thee follow about me don't worry about it but john the baptist is out there baptizing on the jordan river he says you know what guys i got a secret for you i'm going to introduce to you the messiah i just baptized you with water but this is a guy coming he's going to baptize you with holy ghost and fire i'm not even worthy to loosen his shoelace well if he's not he's not worthy to loosen the shoelaces why did that prostitute do that why did that prostitute wash his feet why she's not he's not worthy why should she do that because he's speaking like a prophet and you got to hear how prophet speaks because when a prophet when he the prophet knew that when the messiah would come when boaz would come he would take off his shoe he's on latching shoelace as the work of the redeemer and he would throw the shoe at the guy is that right so he wasn't talking about the literal shoe the work of the redeemer i'm not even worthy to take part in that redemption work you don't know what i'm talking about go to psalms 49 10. i gotta be quiet and the church now this this that was that was israel is that right yes or no that was israel going through her birth pains and for confirmation here we go now let's place one thing at least does does brother brown said that joshua should be called the ephesians of the old testament this is not my doctrine i'm just saying what brother brown said and if it isn't that way then i'm wrong and that's okay i'll keep looking like the brother said sigelei but you can see how that joshua is holy spirit is that correct the holy spirit is now starting to place down here things in order yes so joshua is now this is the the the paul of his church age is that correct not going to talk about the in the other ones because i i i have to study them in detail myself brother and sister i'll tell you but in their dark ages what do they have in their dark ages over here jezebel yes or no and who confronts jezebel elijah wait a minute are you going to tell me that elijah has two comings with the jews yeah he actually has three comes with the jews he's got elijah then elisha is that right then elijah over there john the baptist then to us we get elijah over here yes or no don't forget it's elijah all the way through really you want to look at it that way those of you that know that brother said this i'd like for you to say amen so the other know that we're know what we're talking about 1965 november time frame brother bam says i forget that it thinks in november i forget the exact message but he says the elijah of our age is the lord jesus christ but here what i really love about it right here sorry i meant stuff but i love it right here is that god pulls a wool over their eyes and he sends a little girl 16 year old girl riding horse farm girl never never rode a horse before all of a sudden she's riding a horse down never let her never let an army before she's a farm girl illiterate now she's now she's riding a horse now she's close to the king the future king he says god sent me to you for me to break the siege of orleans they're all going where is your pedigree what college did you go to what college did you go to what's your name all she would call herself was i am joan the maid or joan the virgin contrasted to jezebel the harlot you get the idea and it's during that during that age what did that tyrone church age when god sends joan of arc we already talked about her before right races are dead prays for the sick miracles left and right and now let's go to now let's go to the church this our church is now this is this you see it here because here you have elijah john the baptist when he's going to bat when he's going to baptize jesus he says behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world amen amen thank you brother and then our elijah's going to say to us some people i know some people say he had already took place in a comp and us fulfillment one of the compound fulfillments of it behold the lamb of god coming in glory brother brandon brother bernie already preached about that yes yeah that's a compound fulfillment but one day he's really coming back and he'll be here he's here and it's on tape they say say what the tapes say say what the tape say okay i'll say what the tapes say just don't call me a liar because i say what the tapes say someday he says he'll point the people to a word-born bride then he'll point the bride to the skies and his appearing saying behold the lamb of god coming in glory will come forth from his lips that's a literal fulfillment that's the rapture and where will it take place we heard wednesday night in jerusalem and now i gotta continue now the church is going through some birthdays it had to go through birth pains before it could give each one of the prophets now we're talking about new testament prophets you get the idea now when paul if paul martin paola arenas martin columba martin columba luther wesley elijah got it seven did i count them right something like that they're all reformers but brother man comes from prophet salsa new testament a new testament preacher didn't brother branstad new testament preachers a prophet that's right and each in each one of those prophets when they came to the world there was a birth pain to the church and i keep reading remember birth pain is not easy it hurts she the church had birth pains under luther now we know that there's seven church ages and seven messengers to them church ages according to revelations now when luther had to come forth it certainly threw the church into birth pain but it brought forth a luther that's right after that it got in trouble again so it got it brought forth a wesley that's right got forth again and brought forth a pentecost pentecost had birth pains too and it brought the ministry of the son of man is that correct and they all said who's crazy you know what i'm talking about if you don't know what i'm talking about it's just not a man i'm not talking about brother bannon but i am but i'm not you're confusing me brother ernie it's compound fulfillment brother brandon was brother brown a son of man said i'm just the son of man revealing this this the son of man but son of man he says means prophet and when the lord jesus christ was in brother branham saying you're from uh such and such 28 24 west banker street your name is such and such you got such a such melody that wasn't brother bob speaking that was the jesus christ and brother branham manifesting the ministry of the son of man the whole 40 is a 50 song you can't have one you can't have one without the other i guess they have they made a campbell soup commercial now something i don't know there we go don't you see how those messages has come with birth pain but the live left right out of there to go to the next message the life went right out of luther into wesley's message right out of western's message into the pentecost message now it's time to leave the shock what's the matter there's nature in every form declaring that's the truth so the church really is in birth pains tonight for the deliverance of the sun what it was already born over there i don't understand real ernie revelation 12 again you see what i'm talking about compound fulfillment it's orthodox jew church yes it is it's the church yes it is it's the u.s yes it is sometimes i say things before i shut my mouth but that's okay i said it so we are in birth pain i'll go to the middle so we are in birth pain a message from god always throws the church into heavier pain but after a while she's going to be delivered of a bride that will bring forth jesus christ to the bride what that's double talk no it isn't just read it and study and you'll see what it is that's the great mystery go to colossians 1 18-25 that mystery which of which i have made a minister of paul says that great ministry that has been hid through the ages which is it's going to come he's going to come in this day this month this year that's not the mystery what is the ministry he says so simply he says christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery what is the mystery of god reveal christ in you the hope of glory christ being born in you paul said i travail in birth until christ be formed in you escalations i think four i had it to read but too much not enough time god has said some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world how they groan and cry under labor pains oh oh but then they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost has said in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastor some evangelist and he says the apostles of when he sent the apostles right after the prophet left people rejected that fivefold ministry oh oh no i'm just staying with a prophet what about the apostles god set him in the church i'm staying with the prophet's tapes then he sends teachers i'm staying with the apostle only amen pastors oh i'm staying home listen to tapes i don't need a pastor evangelist so right now everybody that wants to be an apostle or an evangelist it's easier they're none what's the word they're not non-controversials what can't speak bad about that because he's an evangelist what about the prophets minor prophets pastors they're here pastor here master your pastor your pastor there pastor everywhere pastor pastor pastor the teacher they go i'll tell you one thing i ain't no teacher i'm myself i'm a stupid institute teacher my wife doesn't want me to say that but i said it i'm sorry i said it so here we go it's water i gotta finish it's water this is not the end that was the church now here's you individual you got to go through justification by faith i'm going to just skip through here justification by faith sanctification of the spirit and then the holy spirit comes in and gives new birth part one and fills that vessel part two didn't brother batman say that sometimes when you receive the holy ghost you have a little temper tantrum brother tim i know i have them sometimes what the brother man said does the holy spirit leave you no it says that rest over there in the gable end of the building i guess always conspiring to use that means like the end of the roof or something like that at the gable end of the building what's a gable alex gable is like a vegan truss sends it at the gable end of the building waiting for your goaty nature to turn back into a lamb again then it can come back to you how long does it take for me sometimes weeks months year sometimes brother bernie one day he preached see the spiritual and i was think i think i was sitting right here and he comes up to here and he starts preaching starts saying like this is he's preaching to you guys looks like i'm preaching to you guys right but he's standing right here right there raise your hand if you think that's that's the truth that was the truth he was preaching to me that because i came back from brazil brother sick when i saw the ministry the turmoil and the ministry that would sometimes sit up in my bed raise your hand if it's true i know you don't like doing that wait wait sometimes awake waking up in the middle from a dead sleep waking up just screaming my heart off torture birth pains and i saw that and i said man that was an 81 was it honey it was 181 i said if the ministry is like that no wonder the people are in the shape they're in amen and it happened again in 88 and it happened again in 2000 and this is not about me this is about birthdays you have to have the new you have to it's this is you and then building this is this is just one thing for you to study out how many of how many you have ever read the message statue of a perfect man raise your hand or heard about it raise your hand i've heard about it but i've never read that message yet i'm teasing you because this is what brother ban really entitled it re everybody they can see it please read it with me building the living everybody building the living tabernacle building the building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place the perfect man the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells that's the title of stature of a perfect man but can they put that in the book that's the sound this morning i want to speak on this subject it says building the living tabernacle just go ahead and read that read that message again and you'll see that it's that is that's what that's what is that's what it says and i'm going to go very fast through the next few slides so you can see what i'm talking about brother ben said now you got to be born again and born again produces faith all right then after you've got faith that's right f-a-i-t-h then you're in just a position of growing you're just on here the foundation what is the foundation now go forward forward i'm going backwards forward forward i turn my finger forward and it goes backwards that's okay you're in a position of growing here's what i'm referring to this foundation is in your birth that's what our pastor taught to us right you justified sanctified born again then you're right here barely right here then you can start growing is that right that's what our pastor taught us you see how it's all tied in together with bird pains and stuff like that and and then people go to the altar have a great uh uh experience of sanctification come upon them then you have a great time get up for the altar shot i got it i got it no you just started to a place where you can grow you ain't done nothing yet the only thing you've done is just lay the foundation you built you're going to build the house for the foundation right brother alex boy i got her yeah no you just laid the foundation now you got to build a house now there's fir where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about all right this house it's this foundation what is the foundation of christianity faith when you're born again you have faith god has given to every man a measure of faith but we talked about in our bible lessons remember i'm going to show you faith right now brother enoch would you please stand thank you would you please sit down that was faith in action he believed not because i spoke he believed he could stand up right he stood up i said go ahead and sit down he believed he could sit down i'm going to walk over there on the side not unless i get struck by lightning or something happens i'm going to walk to brother fred shake his hand and then come back here to stand here it's like starting your car brother bam said that's a baby a childlike faith that's how simple it is that's how simple this faith is right here that i'm going to show you right now your life your birth pains are coming on this is that's to do with the when you kind of you're born again this is how my experience came from i can't i don't have time for that now running out of time it must be an absolute absolute birth and here we've skipped through the quotes where brother ben talks about you're yearning some there's something inside your yearning you don't you don't like being here more that's you yearning for your other body you're sick and tired of this place something says it's a little bird called your soul seeking that other body and you're gonna have to go through birth pains for that would you please stand if she's here i'm gonna ask your sister samara to come forward so you can pray for her time is over now if anybody else would like a prayer by the elders you can come forward but the only one we have officially here's sister stomata she's asking for procedure medical procedures she's standing in place with someone else come forward sister the elders who come forward right now laid hands on you it's a solemn moment you sisters know better than we men we know it from a conceptual standpoint but your sisters know what birth pains are all about those of you that are mothers you know it's not an easy thing so just remind your husbands about the time that we're living in right now the world is going through birth pains the religious chur the religious world is going through birth pains in the message there are things going many churches are going through birth pains this church is going through birth pains you're you as an individual are going through birth pits so their birth pains left and right we just have to just yield to god and just read it in jeremiah chapter 4 i think it is 31 maybe verse it talks about the daughter of zion brother battle said that's always the bride so that's a new another key for when you study the messages in isaiah another place where you see talk to a daughter of zion daughter or zion daughter resign they go they walk down the street tinkling as they go and so forth that's the daughter of zion it's it's crept into in the bride so uh the elders of the other elders would like to join us please come forward let us bow our heads so we can pray and then our brother who will be singing will be coming up in just a moment after the prayer heavenly father we thank you lord for the few words we were able to get out to this morning lord like i said it was not an overall completely comprehensive or talk or whatever people want to call it on birth pains it was just to get the people to study a little bit more there's so so so much more on the topic that i'd never covered never even touched but i ask you that you help each one that has an interest in it to go study it and right now lord as we address you in prayer for her sister samoda you know her just you know you know her request lord it doesn't have to be read out loud i already mentioned it you know what it is lord you know her desire and that of her loved one all we're asking is for you to come on and on the scene and may they when they receive their answer lord they come back and say thank you lord give a testimony saying lord you are true to your word that's what we ask you lord well your word says that those that overcame the dragon which still was the compound fulfillment they overcame the dragon by the by their testimony and the blood of the lamb so it is the blood of the lord jesus christ we overcome our testimony we say thank you god for what you did for us publicly tell the people say look what god did for me we sing it but we forget to say look what jesus did for me but we're just singing we should say it lord jesus write it down bring it up here so it can be read from the platform so sister brother such as such thanks god for healing them of tuberculosis from cancer from whatever it is lord and we that's what we wanted helps us increases our faith lord helps us to see that you are in our midst that you are the same yesterday today and forever then it becomes not just something like brother alex says something academic it becomes a reality in our midst lord god not just a saying so lord jesus christ i place these people here that are in the line here being prayed for by the elders may you answer each one according to your perfect will lord may they know that you have done something for the lord we ask you these things lord in the name of the lord jesus christ and as our prophet said to give you thanks for the answer with thanksgiving and praises may they sing the praises of god to you lord may you scream honestly thank you lord for what you've done in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and we thank you for everything that you've done for us amen i feel the time of hands so kind and tender they're leading me in the path that i must try i'll have no fear i'll have no fear yes lord for jesus wants besides me foreign turn in the arms of god they don't worry with me the arms of god soon i shall hear the calmness come home my sweet heavens this morning is with me me with me hallelujah oh is is know god bless brother ernie this morning how many enjoyed the message this morning when i think of the goodness of jesus oh is of jesus for me hallelujah the prophet says that the yoke shall be destroyed because the anointing left jesus yes oh is oh oh you oh my hallelujah first of all on behalf of my mom and the rest of the family we would like to thank you for your prayers and those that went to the hospital to visit my dad oh i'm up here just to set the record straight it's taking off there's one sister here i won't mention her name that my mom spoke to me that she may have understood misunderstood what my mom was telling her about my dad okay anybody else uh might have been misinformed but i want you to know peroquito we would like you to know on behalf of the garcia family that my doc my dad did not have a stroke he went to the doctor they wanted to run some tests on him and uh my mom chose to admit him to the hospital they said that it was either go to the hospital and get everything done all at one time or go to several locations throughout the week and have everything done on outpatient basis and so it would be easier and better for her she chose to have him admitted to the hospital hospital and uh please forgive me if this offends you and this is coming from me this is not from my mom yes um if you guys hear anything see please don't start any rumors uh there was one sister that called me and she knows who she is i spoke to her she was told that my dad did have a stroke yes she called me i didn't answer so i called her back and to me that's the way it should be done if you hear something whether it's for for my father or anybody else don't go running off and and uh saying things that you don't even know if they're true no yes yes because to me this is what happened with brother bernie people started posting that he had a stroke or whatever happened to him so i called one of his daughters and she didn't even know and she said that was not true on something like this and not only for my family you know so that'd be familiar but for yours also sino para las you say estambien if you hear anything see you can call me you can call my my one of my sisters or my sister or my brother if you can't get a hold of us at the time uh leave a message we will get back to you and i'm sure like anybody else and uh but the reason that's the reason i'm here this morning to let you know that my dad did not have a stroke if you continue to keep them in your prayers see man he's doing good in the movie he's he's getting a lot better he's it's just hard for him to come to service right now so luke is deficient but he is watching via the internet and those of you that went to the hospital to see him you know what i'm talking about concerning his condition so please keep him in your prayers along with our pastor junta mention i believe with all my heart that their greatest desire que el de ceomas grandeus would be here with us and unfortunately they can't so i hope you all understand and if you heard from somebody on the alien the condition of my dad and unless it comes from the family or any part of the family doesn't have to be my immediate family no no and they give you guys a message and let you know the condition or if anything wherever it happened to my dad then you know that it's the truth the only reason we didn't say anything which you know i can say we could take responsibility for leo problem tomorrow to have some blood work and some x-rays done simply and that was it yes but you know a lot of times we is human you know especially we hear that somebody's in the hospital hospital and we think the worst i pensamolo but once again we thank you for your prayers and for those that have gone to visit him and that are still continuing to see him at home he along with my mom they appreciate it very much so i thank you for your time let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for the word that we've received today truly it helps to strengthen us and polish up the old armor and go back out to battle lord satan's waiting for us lord he doesn't take sundays off we can't take sundays off either lord we just charge our batteries and go we thank you because you said that you would be with us and even in us lord trusting in this lord we we go about our day and we just ask you to take everyone home safely lord until we come and meet again and lord we thank you for the garcia family and i just feel with my heart to just continue to ask to pray for brother paul bless brother paul he is a great example to me and i'm sure to everyone here we love him lord and we love you lord and let's go with joy in our hearts trusting that everything is in your hands in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen take the name of jesus with you o child of sorrow and of war it will joy and comfort give you take it then wherever you go o precious name o how sweet a hope of earth and joy of heaven
