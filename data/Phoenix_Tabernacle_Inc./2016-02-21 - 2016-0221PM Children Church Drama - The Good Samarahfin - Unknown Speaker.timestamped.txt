[5:58] greeting God bless you well
[6:03] [Music]
[6:11] bless and before we get started uh I'd
[6:14] like to read uh um a passage from Psalms
[6:20] 1-6 Psalms 1 1-6
[6:32] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[6:34] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[6:37] in the way of Sinners nor sth in the
[6:40] Seal of the scornful but his Delight is
[6:43] in the law of the
[6:46] Lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[6:50] and night
[7:06] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[7:09] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[7:11] his fruit in his season his Leaf shall
[7:15] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[7:18] doeth shall prosper
[7:30] the ungodly are not so but are like the
[7:33] chaff which the
[7:35] wind driven
[7:37] away therefore the ungodly shall not
[7:41] stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the
[7:43] congregation of the
[7:56] right for the Lord knoweth the way of
[7:59] the righteous but the way of the ungodly
[8:02] Shall
[8:09] Perish if everyone would please
[8:17] stand and we will have our opening
[8:27] prayer dear heavenly father

[31:00] [Music]
[31:01] Jesus they're they are there maybe it

[32:07] Jesus and we trust in in in thy word
[32:09] Lord
[32:10] Jesus Lord as Moses was in the desert
[32:13] Lord
[32:15] father he had a medicine
[32:18] [Music]
[32:19] bag all those millions of people that
[32:22] were in the
[32:24] desert not not one person got sick
[32:29] not not one person was
[32:31] feeble because he reached into that
[32:35] bag and in that bag that medicine bag
[32:40] was the promise of your
[32:41] word that said I am the Lord that Health
[32:45] thy
[32:48] disease so we we trust in that Lord
[32:51] father that we can go to that medicine
[32:56] bag as Moses did Lord father and you can

[33:14] things
[33:15] Lord not understanding that it's not
[33:18] what we need Lord
[33:20] Jesus so we just ask you for those
[33:23] things that we need Lord
[33:25] father trusting in thee Lord
[33:28] father because we as children

[34:07] peace
[34:08] Mercy Grace as according to thy
[34:13] measure that if we just ask Lord

[52:47] bit look how beautiful the turtles
[52:51] look so then now I was telling you the
[52:55] story of the Good Samaritan right
[52:57] right there was two types of fish there
[53:01] were the
[53:02] jewfish and also they were the
[53:07] Samaritans now they did not like each
[53:09] other they were always bicker they will
[53:13] fight whenever they will see each other
[53:15] in the sea they will try to avoid each
[53:20] other fishy it's okay don't be shy
[53:26] what's going
[53:29] on oh they're chasing the poor poor
[53:32] little SE Sam oh no they're being mean
[53:35] they don't like her oh
[53:38] wow how little samarin how many think
[53:41] that's okay how many you think is
[53:43] bullying someone it's okay no no you
[53:46] think it's okay to bully someone because
[53:48] you don't like them or because they're
[53:50] smaller no you think that's okay no no
[53:54] that's good to hear now now also the
[53:58] little fishes will swim around in the
[54:00] sea but there was also bigger fish in
[54:04] the
[54:05] sea they were the mean
[54:12] ones not so much bad but a little mean
[54:16] just a little they were bullies
[54:21] oh no so I would imagine that just like
[54:24] on a normal day in the ocean the little
[54:26] fishes were out come on out and they're
[54:28] swimming look at the little sea urant
[54:31] the Yellow Sea

[54:49] crabs but what happened wasn't it
[54:51] dangerous in the ocean Jesus that's
[54:53] right they were all so dangerous fish
[54:56] bigger fish with big sharp
[55:01] teeth have you guys heard this uh I
[55:04] don't know this song have you heard this
