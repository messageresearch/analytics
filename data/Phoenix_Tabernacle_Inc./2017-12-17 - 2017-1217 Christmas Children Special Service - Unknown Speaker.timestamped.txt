[32:16] ready he can come out
[32:31] I want to take you guys back to explain
[32:35] to you why we even have a Christmas -
[32:41] the reason we have a Christmas is
[32:42] because God knew that we needed
[32:48] salvation so I want you to understand
[32:53] 700 years before before Jesus came to
[32:59] the scene we had a prophet by the name
[33:02] of Isaiah he gave Isaiah around the
[33:06] Laplace here we have prophet Isaiah here
[33:13] he is with his candles and his books and
[33:16] he's reading out of the scripture and
[33:19] all of a sudden he falls into a prophecy
[33:24] he fought what and then will get Adam
[33:28] and Eve go ahead and come out here he
[33:30] falls into a vision he falls into this
[33:33] vision and he gets transported to the
[33:34] Garden of Eden boom there he is he's in
[33:38] the garden and then all of a sudden the
[33:43] piano music speeds away and then we hear
[33:47] this sound effect because he's in the
[33:51] jungle he's in the Garden of Eden so he
[33:55] takes the seat what isn't that I had my
[33:57] little buddy in this all because the
[34:03] vision is so overwhelming peace where am
[34:06] I
[34:07] what's going on and then all of a sudden
[34:09] our trusty trees
[34:21] and then we see there's all this rumble
[34:24] in the forest there and because Adam and
[34:27] Eve are running Adam and Eve are running
[34:32] in the garden why are they running
[34:34] because they touched and they ate from
[34:38] the first babying tree in the garden and
[34:42] even some things what does that have to
[34:44] do with Christmas let's just wait they
[34:46] ate come on Adam and Eve run run out of
[34:50] a need run come over here
[34:52] run over here run run run run they're
[34:55] running through the garden
[34:57] go hide hide where's run Adam right give
[35:01] them a round of applause as they're
[35:03] running they need a high hurry go get on
[35:06] out of here and all of a sudden the
[35:09] garden of eden hears this voice where
[35:15] are you at all God is looking for his
[35:19] son where do they go they're hiding
[35:21] behind the piano Lord Oh Did you touch
[35:24] the tree don't tell me that you ate from
[35:27] the tree is going on what's happening
[35:33] and God says because you ate from the
[35:37] tree I have to cover you and these
[35:40] leaves they're not good enough to cover
[35:42] you I have to kill a lamb so what Jesus
[35:47] did is what God did to kill the lamb he
[35:50] covered them with the skin of that lamb
[35:55] because nothing else can cover sin but a
[35:59] bloody laugh but jeez God knew that her
[36:04] little lamb wasn't gonna be good enough
[36:05] for us and for all the future and for
[36:08] all the sins of the world needed a
[36:10] different type of man he himself we need
[36:16] to calm down in the form of a baby
[36:20] not conceived to sin and give a Lamb of
[36:25] God to go to Calvary and die to cover
[36:31] all the sins of the world
[36:34] so right there
[36:36] after the Prophet I say I realized he
[36:40] uttered his what was of this prophecy
[36:42] and he said behold a virgin shall
[36:45] conceive and you'll call his name
[36:51] Emmanuel and Emmanuel means God with us
[36:58] today I said mama can you give this
[37:00] prophet a round of applause can you give
[37:05] these trees a wave yeah thank you trees
[37:09] can you take your branches to the back
[37:11] go ahead and take your branches to the
[37:13] back
[37:14] so then 700 years later we are taken
[37:22] here and the Virgin Mary is a walk-in to
[37:30] the well
[37:36] the Virgin Mary was just an ordinary
[37:37] girl simple little girl probably out 14
[37:42] years old here she comes
[37:44] go ahead and welcome here with the one
[37:45] with the warm clap so she's walking and
[37:52] all of a sudden she stopped by an angel
[37:56] I'll be the angels okay can I be the
[37:59] angel I don't have any wings
[38:00] I don't Mary do not be afraid for you
[38:08] are favored amongst women God has chosen
[38:11] you Mary you will bear a son and you
[38:14] will call his name Jesus and he will be
[38:20] the savior of the world and Mary said
[38:24] how is this possible i I've never knew
[38:27] man the angel says don't worry the baby
[38:32] that you're gonna have is not gonna be
[38:34] from a man it's gonna come from the Holy
[38:36] Spirit God's gonna come and overshadow
[38:40] you and and don't worry nothing is
[38:43] impossible for God because even your
[38:46] cousin Elizabeth who's already an old
[38:50] and older age you know what I need
[38:54] Elizabeth Rachael would you mind being
[38:56] Elizabeth for me
[38:58] Rachel can you go to the back please
[39:00] Thanks you're not old you're I promise
[39:04] you're not so even a little bit she's
[39:07] pregnant and she's gonna have a baby so
[39:10] nothing is impossible be in unto me as
[39:16] his word yes she said be it unto me
[39:19] according to your word isn't it so
[39:22] beautiful when we hear the word of God
[39:24] that's what we want to say you say okay
[39:26] Lord may it be unto me however you say
[39:30] and she had this awesome man who was
[39:35] gonna be her husband but men marry she
[39:41] probably struggled with a couple of
[39:42] thoughts she said well I'm opposed to
[39:44] have a baby how am I supposed to tell
[39:45] this guy that I mean
[39:46] I'm gonna have a baby and it's not his
[39:49] but are you gonna do what are your
[39:52] parents going to be oh my god I don't
[40:04] know how I'm gonna tell my mom he lost a
[40:08] leg oh yeah Jose Joseph what am I gonna
[40:16] tell Joseph he's gonna think hi Senora
[40:23] you owe me the melons pilaris he is the
[40:29] only kind of policy so she contemplated
[40:45] and contemplated and prayed and trusted
[40:50] and walked to the piano and began to
[40:53] play a song but just knowing just
[40:58] knowing what the angel said gave her
[41:01] comfort and the Holy Spirit started
[41:04] comforting her
[41:10] and as and as Mary comforted herself but
[41:17] Sunday school kids came up to sing their
[41:19] special
[41:20] [Music]
[41:25] and Phoenix Tabernacle gave them a round
[41:29] of applause see how you're all taking
[41:35] part in this plan of salvation you're

[42:51] [Music]
[43:53] [Music]
[45:22] [Music]
[45:30] [Music]
[45:42] [Music]
[46:28] [Music]
[47:14] [Music]
[47:28] [Music]
[48:18] [Music]
[48:26] [Applause]
[48:32] [Applause]
[48:33] [Music]
[48:57] can you would you give them just another
[49:01] round of applause for that isn't that
[49:02] beautiful
[49:03] I love it look at our baby yes so there
[49:12] Mary was and she she would get comforted
[49:15] by the Holy Spirit but there was so much
[49:18] she's me so many people talking about
[49:21] about her cuz like this girl she's not
[49:23] even really married yet and she's
[49:25] already gonna be she got a little baby
[49:27] bump and what is going on so you know
[49:30] what she went to go visit her cousin
[49:33] Elizabeth because the angel told her
[49:38] that she was gonna have a baby too so
[49:40] Mary wanted to see that so Elizabeth was
[49:43] outside her house she was probably
[49:45] folding laundry you know she was just
[49:48] pretty depressed because Mary I'll tell
[49:51] you when to come in right all right
[49:54] freeze right there perfect she was a
[49:56] little depressed though because even
[49:59] though she was pregnant she hadn't felt
[50:02] the baby move at all
[50:10] the Lord has found favor with me he's
[50:14] taken away the disgrace amongst the
[50:16] people I know that he's giving me this
[50:19] baby that I something's not right
[50:25] and then I can't even talk to my husband
[50:30] can't even talk back that's annoying who
[50:42] do I talk to what's going on so the
[50:48] reason I love this scene cuz this shows
[50:51] the power of our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:54] before he was even born so the Bible
[51:00] says that Lizabeth was there and Mary
[51:04] walked over and just simply at her
[51:09] greeting when she greeted her aloud
[51:12] saying hands of it mmm the baby inside
[51:19] her jumped with life Oh My blessed are
[51:26] you amongst all women and blessed is the
[51:29] child that you will bear for when you
[51:34] just greeted me my baby leaped for joy
[51:40] why have you come to visit me why has
[51:42] the God favored me so blessed are you
[51:46] that you believed God and you believed
[51:49] that he would do what he promised he
[51:50] would well I have news for you
[51:56] I had an angel spoke to me and told me
[51:59] that I was going to bear a son named
[52:01] Jesus and it was going to be a sign by
[52:06] the Holy Spirit
[52:12] and so that's how powerful Jesus is that
[52:17] even before he was born on this earth
[52:20] the mere presence of him being there
[52:23] inside his mother's womb brought a dead
[52:26] baby to life and that baby as they go
[52:31] ahead and walk offstage they go back
[52:32] inside for a cup of tea and some total
[52:34] puss that baby grew up to be John the
[52:38] Baptist the Elijah that will forerun the
[52:40] first coming of Jesus so the back back
[52:46] over in a in Mary's hometown her young
[52:50] strapping husband come on come on over
[52:53] here you don't talk about you staring at
[52:55] me he's in his water he's he's in his
[52:59] workshop work it away he was a carpenter
[53:03] so he's making sure the stage is nice
[53:05] and intact making sure everything is
[53:09] even and he's but he's kind of upset
[53:12] because he heard the news he saw that
[53:17] Mary was pregnant how did I make you
[53:20] feel buddy ol pal do you want to know
[53:26] No we could only imagine but he was such
[53:32] a good man he was such a godly man that
[53:36] he refused to put her away publicly to
[53:38] embarrass her so he just decided to do
[53:41] it in secret because he loved her but as
[53:45] he slept he fell asleep an angel came to
[53:50] him in a dream and told him Joseph
[53:55] Joseph don't be afraid the baby that
[53:59] marries caring is of the Holy Spirit
[54:02] she's a good girl
[54:04] [Music]
[54:05] that baby is of the Holy Spirit and you
[54:09] will call his name Jesus and he'll be
[54:12] the Messiah the savior of the world so
[54:15] he took that and he jumped up and he
[54:17] said well so he went to go find Mary and
[54:27] he brought her back out and he told her
[54:34] Mary the angel came to me
[54:41] [Music]
[54:59] praise God that we have men that listen
[55:02] to the Word of God and Trust give him a
[55:04] round of applause please
[55:10] so as they were rejoicing they got news
[55:13] a couple of Roman soldiers came out they
[55:19] came out and they gave an announcement
[55:23] they look at the whole town and they
[55:25] said listen up over here where everybody

[56:24] were walking through dangerous
[56:27] territories and there they go their
[56:30] journey and they have to go all the way

[56:34] pregnant so she was really slow and she
[56:37] was on a boudreaux she was on a board or
[56:40] guys that they were going go into harsh

[57:10] sudden it got dark in the church but
[57:13] there was a lot of noise because
[57:15] everybody was talking so kind of whisper
[57:17] where you are cuz everybody was there
[57:21] they came from all over the place
[57:23] because the soldiers told them they had
[57:25] to go to the town of their birth so then
[57:29] they went up and down the aisles
[57:30] knocking ask him if there was room
[57:32] anywhere to stay they needed a room to
[57:39] stay just at that moment the audience
[57:51] kind of quieted down and Mary and Joseph
[57:54] walked over here and they had one last
[57:58] hope because the light was on right
[58:01] about here so they thought there might
[58:02] be something open and the innkeeper came
[58:06] out and they asked him they asked him do
[58:09] you have any room but his wife said tell
[58:13] him there's no room here and then she
[58:16] sat down give her a round of applause to
