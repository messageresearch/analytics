[22:25] well to this evening service this
[22:28] presentation of Miriam's Jubilee god
[22:31] bless you before we get the presentation
[22:36] started there's just a few words that I
[22:37] would like to say the way this got
[22:41] started the way God brought this
[22:43] inspiration well sister Tonya Leyva
[22:47] thoughtless is she she came to me and
[22:51] she said I have this drama that the Lord
[22:55] inspired me to do and I said okay
[22:58] awesome mom's give me the script and
[23:00] we'll see we'll see what happens and a
[23:02] couple years passed by and nothing
[23:05] nothing really happened she I guess she
[23:08] was chewing on the inspiration until she
[23:10] came back from a pine Rock camp right
[23:12] where the Lord the second time well the
[23:14] Lord really really put her put that
[23:17] inspiration hard on her till finally she
[23:19] got the script done and she emailed it
[23:21] to me and when I saw it those a few
[23:23] songs in there that or from some other
[23:27] artists and I thought you know what if
[23:29] we're gonna do something let's do it all
[23:33] original let's see what the Lord
[23:35] inspires for the whole thing so we took
[23:37] that and she asked me she's are you
[23:39] gonna be able to write songs there's
[23:40] we're a month away you're gonna be able
[23:42] to write the music and her husband kind
[23:45] of put it in and he said Tonya that's
[23:47] the gift that the Lord gave him he can
[23:48] write a song in five minutes and I
[23:51] thought speak for yourself
[23:54] like are you are you serious you don't
[23:56] just write a song in five minutes and
[23:58] but his sincerity and his heart really
[24:00] really touched me the faith that he had
[24:02] he was sincere and if the Lord gives me
[24:06] the songs if the Lord will give them to
[24:08] me then yes I believe we can have the
[24:10] songs that we need for the presentation
[24:13] and I got home and wouldn't you know
[24:16] within five minutes of me grabbing the
[24:18] guitar and opening up the pages of the
[24:21] Bible and the book
[24:22] Exodus God gave us the first song and
[24:24] then thanked phrase God praise God and
[24:32] then after that he the rest of the songs
[24:35] for the presentation came so in my heart
[24:38] I know we it's been a bumpy road but the
[24:42] whole entire time God has just been
[24:44] confirming until this moment of when we
[24:46] did it on Friday the Holy Ghost fell
[24:49] down and it was such a blessing for us
[24:50] and we're just praying for the same
[24:52] downpour or harder tonight because it's
[24:57] a different crowd and even if a lot of
[24:58] us have seen this seen it on Friday well
[25:02] we come with different desires every day
[25:05] right and His mercies are new every
[25:07] morning so there's always fresh manna
[25:10] for us and if you come with that desire
[25:13] to receive something from the Lord I
[25:15] pray that you don't go disappointed I
[25:18] also want to just make a quick statement
[25:21] and just apologize beforehand for our
[25:24] unique style in presenting the gospel
[25:27] and how I feel that the Lord has
[25:28] inspired me is not my intention or any
[25:31] of our intentions to offend anybody
[25:33] but we want to present to this
[25:35] generation a story of deliverance in a
[25:39] way that will capture you so you can see
[25:42] that the same God from Moses's time
[25:45] isn't asleep he's the same God yesterday
[25:49] today and forever and he's still opening
[25:53] up barriers opening up red seas for
[25:55] people's life and Pharaohs and
[25:57] taskmasters that would keep us bound
[26:00] spiritually are under the sea defeated
[26:05] and today that red sea is the blood of
[26:08] Jesus Christ so god bless you I hope
[26:12] this is a blessing without any further
[26:15] ado I present to you

[57:36] God of Jacob I have indeed seen the
[57:40] misery of my people in Egypt I have
[57:43] heard them cried out because of their
[57:46] slave drivers and I am concerned about
[57:49] this suffering so I have come down to
[57:53] rescue them from the hand of the
[57:55] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[57:58] that land into a good and spacious land
[58:02] a land flowing with milk and honey
[58:07] and now the cry of the Israelites has
[58:11] reached me and I have seen the way the
[58:14] Egyptians are oppressing them so now

[58:22] bring my people the Israelites out of
[58:26] Egypt
[58:32] Who am I Who am I that that you would
[58:36] send me I will be with you and this will
[58:43] be the sign to you that it is I who have
[58:47] sent you suppose I could go up to there
[58:54] and they asked me who is this one that
[58:58] appeared on to you but what is his name

[59:27] say to them the Lord the God of your
[59:31] father's the God of Abraham Isaac and
[59:35] Jacob appeared to me and said I have
[59:38] watched over you and have seen what has
[59:41] been done to you in Egypt and I have
[59:44] promised to bring you up out of your
[59:47] misery in Egypt into a land flowing with
[59:51] milk and honey the Lord maybe at one
[59:58] time they believed I was a liver but now
[1:00:02] they would never believe me if I go to
