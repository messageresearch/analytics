[0:00] through ear phones may the Lord richly
[0:01] bless you through his word amen
[0:17] amen now
[0:20] father as we're in the moment that we're
[0:22] about to go into your word we ask that
[0:25] you bless it Lord that through it we may
[0:27] be able to receive what we need
[0:31] and when all things finished we'll give
[0:33] you the honor and the glory in the name
[0:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:39] amen open up your Bible Brothers to the
[0:42] Book of Mark
[0:45] 11 verse
[0:48] 11 verse 23 reads like this and in the
[0:52] morning as they passed by and they saw
[0:54] the victory dyed up from the
[0:57] roots and Peter calling
[1:00] to remembrance said unto him
[1:05] Master
[1:07] behold the Fig Tree which thou curs is
[1:10] withered away and Jesus answering said
[1:13] unto them have faith in God for verily I
[1:17] say unto you that whosoever shall say
[1:19] unto this mountain be thou moved and be
[1:22] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[1:23] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:26] that those things which he said shall
[1:28] come to pass he shall have have
[1:30] whatsoever said amen you may be seated
[1:33] Brothers this evening I greet each one
[1:35] of
[1:36] you in the precious name of our Lord
[1:39] Jesus
[1:40] Christ we welcome all those brothers
[1:45] that have been able to get here this
[1:49] afternoon Where We Gather to praise the
[1:53] Lord at the same time to hear his
[1:56] word which is the one that gives us what
[2:00] we
[2:01] need that we can
[2:03] survive in this tremendous day which
[2:06] we're living
[2:07] in only God's
[2:10] word is the one that can give us the
[2:14] necessary light that we need to walk for
[2:16] every moment I'm going to start reading
[2:19] where I left off last
[2:21] Sunday and it's that I'm done with the
[2:24] message now titled God's power to
[2:28] transform and I want to see if I can get
[2:30] ahead and further on the subject which
[2:33] I'm taking adoption and we found some
[2:36] small things there it so happens that
[2:40] brother
[2:41] Spooner he asked me a question on
[2:46] Monday and the question he asked me is
[2:50] concerning it's in regards to those
[2:52] things that we've been
[2:54] studying and as he asked me what he
[2:57] needed to ask me I told him brother I
[2:59] must tell you that I don't I truly don't
[3:03] know because he asked me in regards to a
[3:07] character in The Bible in regards to
[3:10] what he represented and I told him I
[3:12] didn't
[3:13] know but I've continue upon a study on
[3:16] that and I believe I've come to find an
[3:20] answer in that matter but I don't know
[3:23] when that time will arrive or the
[3:25] appropriate time to
[3:26] speak and that's more question that the
[3:29] brother as which has taken us to a
[3:32] tremendous thing and you know the
[3:35] prophet in the Bible teaches
[3:37] us that the worker is should always be
[3:40] studying right and meditating in God and
[3:44] when there's a small thing that gets
[3:47] there and he doesn't know that it's
[3:49] better for him to say that he doesn't
[3:50] know it and the prophet says if there's
[3:53] a question then there's an answer to
[3:55] that and we've been
[3:57] studying the message adoption and this
[4:00] is number
[4:01] 28 last Sunday we got to the part where
[4:05] how is it that the men lost the Earth
[4:10] think that the man was the god of the
[4:14] earth and how is it that that small
[4:17] thing is the
[4:19] inheritance that men receive from God's
[4:23] behalf and naturally as him being a wise
[4:27] God he gave him also the title deed that
[4:33] property and then we
[4:35] mention that when men
[4:38] sin the Earth or it was returned to
[4:43] Satan hence because man sold it or he
[4:48] forfeited as brother brandham says in
[4:50] English forfeited but being that
[4:54] Satan he made himself the owner of the
[4:59] Earth and he claims to be the owner but
[5:02] here we see that the title deed did not
[5:05] remain in s hence but that the title
[5:08] deed returned to the hands of God which
[5:10] is the original owner and if you follow
[5:13] me I believe that when we get to that
[5:17] small
[5:18] portion of that title deep
[5:23] transaction then we're going to be able
[5:26] to
[5:28] understand one of the more things that
[5:32] has created more discussion amongst the
[5:36] message of
[5:38] Malachi and it seems that in the small
[5:41] things it's where the human being hits
[5:45] bumps and it seems that he can't
[5:47] conceive or be able to catch that small
[5:50] thing but if we're humble towards God
[5:52] and we believe what the prophet has left
[5:54] us without adding or taking away in its
[5:58] due season God's going to help us to
[6:01] place those pieces which we at times
[6:05] haven't been able to position or place
[6:09] correctly even though we say a small
[6:11] thing or people might say in question
[6:15] well how can that be well we answer
[6:17] that's what the prophet said but even
[6:20] further on in our journey the Lord gives
[6:23] us the answer to that question which
[6:27] people ask us you see
[6:30] then the key is to believe all the word
[6:33] that has come out of the mouth of God
[6:36] and when we get to this small part in
[6:38] chapter five of
[6:41] Revelation to
[6:44] speak of the return of the tit of deed
[6:48] remember that next Sun that last Sunday
[6:51] I mentioned that in this 20th
[6:54] century the Lord Jesus
[6:58] Christ gave the title D to William
[7:01] brandham right it seems that at first it
[7:05] seems a incredible thing a
[7:08] paradox but the prophet that's how he
[7:11] says it further on we're going to prove
[7:14] it where is it that the prophet says it
[7:18] not only does the prophet say that
[7:22] God gave him the title deed to the
[7:25] seventh
[7:26] angel or William Bram
[7:30] but he also gave him the right to
[7:32] eternal life because remember when Adam
[7:36] lost the title deed to Earth he also
[7:40] lost the title deed or the the right to
[7:44] eternal life I
[7:48] believe that that is where people in
[7:51] this
[7:52] [Music]
[7:53] message have
[7:55] stumbled they've stumbled and they've
[7:58] gone out
[8:00] with different
[8:03] interpretations so happens you know that
[8:06] there's a a
[8:09] angel and truly they have the right to
[8:11] say this because everyone is under free
[8:15] moral agency but there must be a reason
[8:19] why people get confused it's not a
[8:22] coincidence but then we
[8:25] see how some believe that William
[8:28] brandham
[8:30] gave the
[8:31] Baton
[8:33] or G gave the command to someone
[8:36] else be that he gave it to an an
[8:39] individual or another
[8:40] individual and most people believe this
[8:44] and they follow this but all this stinks
[8:49] there must be a reason why people
[8:52] believe this I believe that in this
[8:54] message of adoption and where we're at
[8:57] now that the man that that says to this
[9:00] mount a man fully surrendered to God
[9:05] because he's the only one that's going
[9:07] to be a partaker of the Resurrection he
[9:10] that is fully surrendered to God that he
[9:14] be a prisoner and that the title deed
[9:18] has
[9:19] passed to the hands of William brandham
[9:22] notice keep that on mind we're going to
[9:24] begin to read there in the book of the
[9:26] seal page 69 67 Spanish forgiving and 83
[9:32] in
[9:33] English the prophet says like this Adam
[9:37] lost his inheritance the Earth and we
[9:42] see right away that the Earth is an
[9:45] inheritance to Adam now the Earth passed
[9:49] from his hands to the one that he sold
[9:54] out to Satan see right away we see and
[9:59] he tells us that Satan sold
[10:04] himself he sold out to Satan and I was
[10:07] reading here a
[10:10] scripture which my dad me mentioned to
[10:13] me on Monday there in Romans
[10:18] 7:14 the scripture reads like this for
[10:22] we know that the law is spiritual but I
[10:26] am carnal sold under
[10:30] sin so then we
[10:32] see that not only Adam sold himself out
[10:37] but he sold the entire human race out
[10:40] and as he sold himself he was selling
[10:42] out the earth and the prophet
[10:46] says that the Earth went to Satan H and
[10:52] says that Adam it went from his hands to
[10:56] Satan's hands the Earth
[11:00] and there shouldn't be a confusion
[11:01] correct we all understand that the
[11:04] Earth stayed or remain in Saint hands
[11:08] and that's the reason why the prophet
[11:10] says that the devil is the God of this
[11:14] evil age or if
[11:17] this evil world or of this 20th century
[11:20] so you can understand me better so let
[11:22] us go see where that title deed remain
[11:26] page 69 of of the book of seals and page
[11:32] in English it's page 86 I want to make a
[11:35] reference to this page before reading it
[11:37] to
[11:39] you and it's because I'm going to be
[11:42] reading in Span to Spanish and that one
[11:44] that hears mean the tape or those that
[11:47] will go back and check the
[11:50] Spanish you're going to find out that
[11:53] I'm not reading it word for word how it
[11:55] is in the book because I I am correcting
[11:58] it
[12:00] where I believe that in his in he makes
[12:02] a great importance and it seems that we
[12:05] take a lot of time correcting the
[12:06] Spanish
[12:07] books but when we're going to speak on
[12:10] small things that have great
[12:13] importance I believe it is necessary to
[12:15] correct where the mistake is at because
[12:18] the people wants the word that came out
[12:21] of the mouth of God which is the prophet
[12:23] William Mar brandom can you say Amen to
[12:25] this brother and the the prophet says
[12:28] like this page 69 in
[12:31] Spanish the title D now remember one
[12:36] thing is the property and the other
[12:38] thing is the title brother
[12:42] borunda sometime he purchased a
[12:45] vehicle
[12:47] 768 76 he bought a
[12:50] 76 dson right and he purchased it I
[12:55] believe he financed it through the bank
[12:57] right and he doesn't have the title but
[13:00] the the the real owner is the is the
[13:03] bank until he finishes paying off the
[13:06] car then they give him the title when he
[13:08] has the title then no one can take that
[13:10] car away from him but as long as if he
[13:13] doesn't pay the car then they're going
[13:15] to repossess the vehicle my niece was
[13:18] telling me that she had a car and that
[13:21] she hadn't done the car payment for 2
[13:23] months and all of a sudden the car went
[13:25] missing in front of her house and she
[13:27] says that she called the police and said
[13:30] police officer they've stolen my vehicle
[13:32] and he said no we have here in our
[13:35] records the notice that the bank has the
[13:37] one that you owe your payments to
[13:39] they've repossessed the vehicle because
[13:41] you haven't paid your two payments and
[13:44] they have the right because they have
[13:45] the title brother Ernie knows that if he
[13:47] doesn't pay make the car payments then
[13:49] they're going to take repo his vehicle
[13:51] and he can't do anything because the
[13:53] real owner is the one that has the title
[13:56] so one thing is the property and other
[13:59] thing is a tital deed now let us
[14:02] notice the title deed that had been lost
[14:06] is now in the hands of the original
[14:10] owner almighty
[14:13] God when Adam lost the title deed to the
[14:17] Earth and to eternal life I want you to
[14:23] notice it's not only the title or the
[14:26] Earth but it's also the title to to
[14:29] eternal life very
[14:33] well Satan's dirty hands could not
[14:37] takeen so since they were dirty hands of
[14:42] Satan he couldn't hold on to or take a
[14:45] hold of the
[14:47] title of Earth
[14:50] or eternal life that's why Satan offers
[14:54] life but yes he offers life but the life
[14:57] that he offers s life is death because
[15:00] it's a perversion of Life see so then
[15:04] the prophet
[15:06] says Satan's dirty hands could not take
[15:09] it so it went back to its original owner
[15:14] God himself now and who's god
[15:18] brother God is spirit is that so
[15:21] Brothers now remember
[15:23] this we're going to see this things next
[15:27] because
[15:32] there he sits on the throne with his
[15:34] hand with the title deed this is another
[15:37] thing that I want you to think on
[15:39] because I don't know if I'm going to
[15:40] have time to hit on the small things
[15:42] when Adam had the title deed it couldn't
[15:46] go to the dirty hands of Satan but it
[15:50] went to God's hand now the Bible
[15:54] says that at his right
[15:57] hand there's seven stars and truly there
[16:01] is a tremendous message the hand of God
[16:04] and the prophet says that this makes me
[16:07] feel
[16:08] religious the title de to eternal
[16:13] life as title deed to eternal life when
[16:17] Adam forfeited that when he forfeited
[16:21] for wisdom in of
[16:25] Faith which he wanted more then it went
[16:28] back to to the hands of the owner he
[16:31] didn't even have one a stop for a second
[16:34] there with say no directly went to the
[16:36] owner the hand God Almighty what a great
[16:40] thing because if Satan was able to
[16:43] remain with the title for a bit
[16:44] everything would have been
[16:46] lost but as soon as he lost the title he
[16:49] sold it and there satans they're just
[16:52] wanting and trying to take a hold of the
[16:55] earth and he lost the title deed direct
[16:58] w
[16:59] to the original owner God
[17:02] Almighty what a tremendous thing the
[17:05] prophet says so what's taking place here
[17:09] he begins to go into a drama and look
[17:11] how how how beautiful this
[17:14] is title deed is in God's hand waiting
[17:18] to be claimed through
[17:22] Redemption
[17:24] remember brother Spooner if you can
[17:26] follow me as best as you can
[17:30] Spanish
[17:32] remember that the claiming period is
[17:35] this this is when the Redeemer
[17:39] claims is
[17:42] subject in the right to claiming is
[17:47] through
[17:48] Redemption redemption or
[17:51] restoration they
[17:53] go hand in hand and the prophet
[17:56] says there's a way to redemp
[17:59] the way to come
[18:01] back the way back and someday the
[18:04] Redeemer is to take it back you see
[18:08] where we're getting to
[18:12] now watch this fellow sitting up on the
[18:16] throne all right waiting for
[18:19] Redemption claims its
[18:22] Redemption and I want to call your
[18:25] attention to when the prophet he spoke
[18:28] this message that we're reading on when
[18:31] he spoke on the Gap getting ready to go
[18:35] into the church ages he took chapter 5
[18:38] of
[18:39] Revelation so then we see that he
[18:41] seated we see that he's seting on the
[18:45] throne and he has the book in his
[18:49] hand and he's
[18:53] waiting for uh Redemption claim it's
[18:57] Redemption
[18:59] so I go in in original English the
[19:02] prophet says what is this book of
[19:05] redemption this title deed Abstract
[19:09] title
[19:10] deed I might not say it very well in
[19:13] Spanish but the prophet
[19:16] says this title deed Abstract
[19:21] title this title deed Abstract title
[19:25] deed that's the reason why I go in
[19:28] English because in Spanish this is not
[19:30] found so what's the D of redemption what
[19:34] is this book of redemption this title
[19:37] deed
[19:38] abstract forgive me
[19:41] Brothers what you say abstract what does
[19:44] an abstract mean means it's search all
[19:48] the way back to its
[19:49] beginning so it means not only does he
[19:51] have the title de but it's an
[19:55] abstract what's taking place on the
[19:59] title and then he answers what does an
[20:03] abstract
[20:06] mean it means it's search all the way
[20:10] back to its beginning and I went to the
[20:13] dictionary and says like this
[20:16] abstract which means a
[20:19] quality with exclusion of a subject as
[20:24] white so it means that there is no
[20:26] complaint
[20:28] on that deed there's no
[20:32] debt when the prophet speaks to us
[20:35] further on that when man sinned he lost
[20:39] he sold out the earth and the property
[20:43] rights to eternal life and the title
[20:46] went to God's
[20:49] hand but Adam could not claim the Earth
[20:53] because there was a debt he had sold
[20:56] himself out
[20:59] and when something has been sold
[21:02] back there possibly like when a brother
[21:05] there has mortgaged a home and he has a
[21:08] title and he has full right to that home
[21:12] but due to so and so reason he seems
[21:16] obligated there to
[21:18] mortgage or there to pond so you can
[21:21] understand me that
[21:22] property then that title is their stay
[21:29] and he cannot that home cannot be sold
[21:32] unless otherwise you first pay off their
[21:37] on the on that dead and when Adam did
[21:40] this that title went back to God's
[21:43] hands but there was a Deb
[21:47] against that
[21:50] property but here where the Prophet is
[21:54] speaking to
[21:55] us he says that it's an AB
[21:59] title saying that there was no Deb so
[22:03] then in order for us to get to where the
[22:05] Prophet is calling our attention is that
[22:08] the price has already been paid for and
[22:11] when he goes into this drama and when he
[22:14] goes into this
[22:16] act
[22:18] there our spiritual s must open up
[22:22] because here is where the prophet's
[22:24] saying he says you be very alert because
[22:28] if you can't understand the small things
[22:32] when the other things come by they're
[22:34] going to go over your
[22:36] head and here the prophet is speaking to
[22:39] us on the small part where we must catch
[22:44] it and it is that this is a title
[22:48] de that an abstract has taken place and
[22:52] not only an abstract has taken place but
[22:55] it's something that has been examined
[22:57] all the way back to the
[22:59] beginning it's been examined so it means
[23:02] that it has a
[23:04] beginning so let's say you want to
[23:07] research on a property here in Phoenix
[23:09] you can go to the court and there where
[23:12] they have the archives there all the
[23:14] legal documents you can find out from
[23:18] the very first owner throughout all the
[23:21] other owners up to today and that is
[23:24] what an abstract is there had only in
[23:28] one original owner and that is God so
[23:32] then God had given it to Adam man and he
[23:36] forfeited and when he forfeited he
[23:39] sold Satan did not keep that title deed
[23:42] no but like God got it and he said this
[23:46] belongs to me and I've inherited to my
[23:51] son and I purposed in my heart knowing
[23:55] that men will fall and that he will
[23:57] forfeit this I purpose a
[24:01] substitute that will come and pay the
[24:04] price and will redeem that property so
[24:08] then I cannot allow this title to be
[24:11] tarnished by dirty hands as Saints hands
[24:16] and when we get here to this
[24:18] scene the title deed is clean and there
[24:22] is no dead against that property are you
[24:25] following me
[24:26] Brothers very well allow me to keep
[24:30] reading I'm trying to remain as simple
[24:33] as possible so you can follow me the
[24:36] prophet says and he gives us an
[24:38] example it's is the example as we gave
[24:42] this morning of that small ink drop and
[24:47] remember I'm reading from English it say
[24:49] the example that we saw this morning of
[24:53] that ink and drop it when that drop fell
[24:57] in in the
[24:59] bleach it went back to its origin and
[25:03] you don't find no more
[25:06] ink then you you try it one day take
[25:10] some ink and and drop it in in the
[25:12] bleach and he'll go back to its origin
[25:15] and take that ink
[25:17] drop from the bleach and try to ride
[25:20] with it you won't be able to ride with
[25:22] it because it went back to its origin
[25:24] now here's the key brother and when sin
[25:28] has been
[25:30] confessed it's fallen in the blood of
[25:33] the Lord Jesus Christ oh Brothers
[25:36] there's given an abstract I want you to
[25:39] notice here in Spanish it says abstract
[25:42] but that's not correct because that's
[25:45] not how English says it he doesn't say
[25:47] he gives him an abstract title that's
[25:50] why people get mistaken and I want to
[25:52] remain there even though I just stay
[25:54] there brother I want to make it clear
[25:56] and I want to get it right because I
[25:58] want to prove it through the Bible and
[26:00] through the message that the title is
[26:03] in William bram's hands and how am I
[26:06] going to receive the title no no
[26:10] no I have now the faculty to give and
[26:15] receive eternal
[26:17] life but notice he's given an
[26:21] abstract and goes back to the
[26:25] Creator in other words you
[26:29] get to be a Son of God see when there's
[26:32] not a stain against
[26:36] earning then an abstract is given to him
[26:39] there's no there's no drop so then he
[26:42] gives back to the Creator to be before
[26:46] the presence of the Creator he's a Son
[26:48] of God he's
[26:50] omnipotent that's why he has the word
[26:53] and the power to create because he's
[26:56] been able to go back Direct L where that
[26:59] title deed is at because the title
[27:02] deed is what gives you the
[27:06] right to what you possess or what you
[27:10] have and if man was the owner of the
[27:14] earth and when Jesus Christ paid the
[27:17] price at Calvary for that stain or Deb
[27:21] that was there left and he send it to
[27:24] that seventh angel messenger the seventh
[27:26] angel messenger brought us the
[27:27] revelation and we catch this and then we
[27:31] see that it's not because of our merits
[27:35] because the prophet is giving us three
[27:38] stages unto
[27:39] Perfection and he's
[27:42] always he's giving us number 13 the
[27:45] first
[27:47] thing that man has to understand that he
[27:51] is a
[27:52] [Music]
[27:54] sinner and that the Lord is calling him
[27:57] through a gospel and when he recognizes
[28:01] that he is a sinner he must confess his
[28:04] sins and as soon as he confesses sin the
[28:08] prophet says that sin falls on the blood
[28:15] of Jesus Christ and when the sin falls
[28:18] on the blood of Jesus Christ it takes
[28:20] him back directly to takes you directly
[28:24] to the Creator and sin goes back to
[28:28] Satan and Satan is responsible for that
[28:33] sin that you committed but the
[28:37] key is that you must confess that sin
[28:42] the Bible says that if you believe with
[28:44] your heart that Jesus ra that God raised
[28:48] Jesus Christ from the dead and you
[28:51] confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus
[28:54] Christ right that then there must be a
[29:01] confession that's the reason when I was
[29:03] speaking with brother Thomas this day I
[29:07] tell them I find out of the fault that
[29:10] has been amongst the people and the
[29:13] reason why the prophet speaks that the
[29:16] Virgin foolish virgin did not have oil
[29:20] and you follow the prophet that every
[29:24] time he says that when they came and
[29:27] asked for oil or
[29:31] there
[29:32] white said you go and and and buy some
[29:36] because man needs to come before God and
[29:40] confess his
[29:41] sins he that confesses his sins shall
[29:46] prosper but he that hides sin cannot
[29:50] receive a blessing because
[29:54] sin remains on the shoulders of that man
[29:58] but when he confesses sin then sin falls
[30:02] on the blood of Jesus Christ and goes
[30:06] back to the individual to the presence
[30:09] of the Creator and he is a Son of God
[30:12] and what he ask God
[30:15] answers because all Heaven backs God's
[30:19] word now I understand why the prophet
[30:23] says come quickly and let us reason
[30:27] together
[30:29] oh brother see it's so easy just to go
[30:34] there as we've done we go there to the
[30:36] furniture so and so and we ask for
[30:39] credit and we only go and we go and ask
[30:42] for something buy something and sign it
[30:43] and they give us the material but all of
[30:46] a sudden the owner is going to ask come
[30:49] quickly and let and let us pay every
[30:52] cent and every dollar that we
[30:55] purchase but here the Lord's calling
[31:00] us because man has taken on so much dead
[31:03] and we find ourselves now bankrupt
[31:06] brother
[31:08] aosta now if our sins be as Scarlet Red
[31:12] they shall be as white as s the brother
[31:15] Bram or the Bible says if they were like
[31:18] Scarlet Scarlet Scarlet's a collar a red
[31:22] colar that's no wonder the prophet said
[31:24] that when they become when you put red
[31:27] on red
[31:28] you get white and when your sin is red
[31:32] as Scarlet but then you confess it and
[31:36] as you confess it it falls on the blood
[31:40] of Jesus Christ that's Scarlet Red and
[31:44] then it becomes white it's an abstract
[31:47] there's no de there's that's the reason
[31:50] why many people can't they can't
[31:52] Brothers barely barely they can walk why
[31:55] you know why because they carry their
[31:58] sin but then get rid of the sin confess
[32:02] your sin surrender to God's hand and say
[32:06] my God I'm a sinner I've done this and
[32:09] immediately you fall it falls on the
[32:12] blood of Jesus Christ and it takes you
[32:14] back to God's presence let us read
[32:18] psalms
[32:20] 517 versus that way
[32:22] read every time read them but it's
[32:26] something is sayah
[32:29] forgive me Psalms
[32:32] 517 Psalms
[32:36] 517 and the psalm of David reads like
[32:39] this purge me with his and I shall be
[32:42] clean the prophet says that his was a
[32:46] common Earth that represented faith and
[32:50] Purify Me with faith and Faith cometh by
[32:54] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[32:58] how shall they believe the Bible says of
[33:01] him who they've not
[33:03] heard and how shall they hear if there's
[33:06] no one to preach to
[33:09] them P Purge me with faith give me the
[33:12] Revelation
[33:14] father doesn't matter how my sin be
[33:18] black but that I only confess it and
[33:21] that it fall on the blood of Jesus
[33:23] Christ Purify Me with his
[33:28] even though I wash with so and so even
[33:32] though I go to so and so Church even
[33:35] though I recite so so creen it doesn't
[33:38] matter it doesn't help me but Purge me
[33:42] with his give me the Revelation oh
[33:46] father that way sin can
[33:49] fall on a blood cleanse me wash me and I
[33:54] shall be
[33:55] wider there will be in abstract the
[33:58] blood of Jesus has paid the price for
[34:03] Humanity sin what you and I need is the
[34:10] Revelation Purge me with his let us go
[34:13] see if there's more more more Bible for
[34:15] this forgive me Exodus

[34:28] Methodist Church or so and so
[34:32] Church Purge me with
[34:36] his 12 21 then Moses called for all the
[34:39] Elders of Israel and said unto them draw
[34:43] out and take you a lamb according to
[34:46] your families and kill the
[34:49] Passover and ye shall take a bunch of
[34:51] his and dip it in the blood that is in
[34:56] the Bas
[34:58] and strike the Lin and the two side PO
[35:01] with the blood that is in the Basin and
[35:04] none of you shall go out at that door of

[37:11] and you know who's the one that sound
[37:14] the trumpet it was a certain sound not a
[37:19] uncertain but through the seventh angel
[37:22] messenger the Apostolic Church never
[37:24] gave me this sound they would tell me if
[37:28] I had a sin after getting baptized I was
[37:31] completely condemned but the certain
[37:34] sound told me take a handful of his up
