[51:08] we are his doctors what do we do no yeah
[51:13] we praise Him because we're brave
[51:15] we're soldiers and we take on the full
[51:19] armor boys his armor he's gonna go into
[51:31] the scary place without armor oh
[51:34] hopefully before the surface is over he
[51:36] puts on his armor so the first thing we
[51:40] want to do is show you an example of
[51:43] someone in the Bible who took the armor
[51:46] of God and conquered his name is Joshua
[51:50] and he fought the Battle of Jericho once
[51:56] upon a time the wall came out on stage
[52:01] [Music]
[52:04] and that's wha
[52:06] was a strombel wall cuz they used ping
[52:11] ters tang and painters are strong so
[52:20] this one's gonna go down a couple steps
[52:22] because our actors are shirt stuff right
[52:28] there so we'll let it go all the way
[52:30] down to the floor
[52:32] are you guys ready pick up your puppets
[52:34] so behind this wall was the people of
[52:39] Jericho handsome group of kids aren't
[52:43] they but God told Joshua Joshua right
[52:51] there you're gonna pick Joshua everyone
[52:53] say hi Joshua
[52:56] so go lead your armies I saw you clean
[52:59] up a path okay
[53:04] so God toy Joshua take your soldiers
[53:09] march around the wall below your horns
[53:14] and shout and I will deliver them into
[53:20] your hand just what your soldiers are
[53:24] following you man oh my gosh this is a
[53:28] sad excuse for an army but you know what
[53:31] God chooses who you least expect
[53:35] he doesn't need a big strong soldier he
[53:38] wants to use you to show his glory so
[53:42] they marched it on the wall so much
[53:45] around the church that way igor go march
[53:47] around can we all seem justified the
[53:49] Battle of Jericho
[53:58] - Afonso that's on us
[54:12] - upon Samantha
[54:20] bottle of gin
[54:26] Josh
[54:34] so they marched around and on the common
[54:38] three maybe all that chocolate and
[54:39] everybody screamed
[54:44] and nothing happened so they went the
[54:47] next day
[54:55] the back
[55:02] just about
[55:04] go
[55:13] Oh
[55:24] Josh
[55:42] so Joshua said I believe God
[56:32] Josh
[56:47] so on the last day after the trumpet
[56:51] sounded the children of Israel shouted
[56:55] out a big shots so the soldiers stopped
[56:59] I don't know a soldier stopped by the
[57:02] wall everybody the wall kids
