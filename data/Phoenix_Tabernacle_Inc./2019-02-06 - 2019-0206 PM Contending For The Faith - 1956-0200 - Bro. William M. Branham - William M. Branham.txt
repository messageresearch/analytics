ministry in an address we've had a mighty fine services in Louisville Kentucky with doctor cobbles it's always a pleasure to get to having in the meetings any other ministers here also up to Folsom from the local churches and other non may not know you but I'm happy new year here and anticipate in this little time of fellowship together it's time for quick notice I didn't know so they before yesterday I believe it was an honors coming down and a better organ bodger one of your boys here from the local goodbye you know hi you're gonna starve a moment just resist very seems to leave him why he starts moving recently I was or some six or eight months ago I was sitting home one day and I just didn't fix him to go to Denver Colorado the convention and this little fella moved into the house he said brother branham I have a great revelation from the Lord I said yes sir he said the Lord cutting Zurich Switzerland on my heart to go over said yoga with me that's well I thought one night over Denver then I go to another meeting I was not too important why no I thought of it I've seem to be that the father would rather I've been writing a revelation for something it was good they come from God and we went to Switzerland and the Lord giveth fifty thousand souls once and there at the Karlsruhe Germany and a driller fifty thousand more about amid a hundred thousand souls and that little campaigning how he blessed listen and now we're planning this summer or early this autumn to go back into African Switzerland in da main tours around the country I own at the Minneapolis Minnesota up there some arena for the next service and then down Sioux Falls over into ol Mexico down below Mexico City and arena they're coming back going to the East Coast and then janessa Anchorage Alaska then we have some American meetings we got some new tips coming sitting several thousand people and some vans and so forth for a few American meetings before going back overseas we certainly still lists the prayers a few people around here this was holdin focus in order to being back home again and we're certainly appreciate your prayers and as we come into these little you know evangelical services we don't come to represent any and he's a nomination any special groups of people we only come because we love Jesus and notice you loving to you and we come into these places for autonomous fellowships a fellowship around his word and around his comments blessing and I'm that's the only mortgage that we had is for these meetings and we're a bad denied to have a brother Tommy Nicholson with us here that I'm sure he's been introduced by better Oregon back which is the the editor for the Christian man fourth internationally a grouper man that I'm proud to belong to them it's a it's Christian businessman who has formed the organization and speak um a international affair they sponsor me most of my meetings around the world and he's the editor of the Christians man's voice and so we've been at the very fitting some testimonies all tasty to see where the divine healing rafts are hot we went on to mrs. Carter I hope they're here tonight Georgian mrs. Carter and George is one of the cases that repealed I believe around fourteen fifteen years ago I won your local man here mr. Hall which is one of the conference for the middle harm Baptist Church for Easter pastor and he was here here a few years ago of cancer given up in Louisville by the doctors around the country and well here tonight healthy and Hardy a team that incredible and we're over the place for the age of the Lord came down and told me what to do my Christian friends on this point we come to this saying we do not claim that we can do anything as our ministers ministry doesn't feature that I believe that we believe in divine healing because it's the gospel and no man can hear of anyone healing doesn't lay and the power of man really made in the power of God and doctors and good man power to heal god only gave Christ the Commission that come to earth to die in our state for our sins and our stupid the scripture said he was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were where is the past hence we were healed and we believe that upon our confession of failure the Jesus our high priest has died and rose again to take away sin from the world and they're sitting at the right hand of God the Father they're making intercessions upon our confession and when he died for our sins he could not die for sins without dying for sickness sickness or the arts of youth have seen momma's you haven't sinned as what causes should be stricken but if there's a cause of sin in the first place that brought sickness to the world they say have you ever had anything we have no sickness but when sickness came in sin is an attribute and now you try not deal with sin in any way without dealing with sickness our ever attribute that sin produced see when we do with sin we deal with faith when we deal in sickness is that the first phase of a I'm sick this takes your body in a night like this one moon gathering two days notice for you people to come out and gather in the building tonight it would be hard to try to go into detail when we were then the campaign's were relaxing for weeks and weeks to explain what insignia or does he come from there is nothing for what there's a reason far and there's a call and you say find the tour until you find a call I was saying there not long ago if I went to a doctor I'm certainly not against doctors surgeons operations hospitals there are God's plans but if I went to a doctor and told him I've had a persistent you give me a aspirin say now run along Billy this would be all right now that man is brushing me off the old a real doctor would diagnose not taste and see what was wrong with me then he's with you the bottom we're safe and then start working from there well now that's the way we have to work and and divine me our salvation to the soul the man comes and says that he's disturbed great really bodies this salvation the first thing to do you Minister do you go right down the line do you find back here or inside after what happened from there you bring it up that's the same thing it isn't in divine healing which did I mean there is not some power that God has given to a man and he Leela is alone in the atonement I want to ask you something called on orders ministers year from the different churches and how would you preach salvation for the soul the only things you could not say we say well harvest converted brother branham I would say two years ago I would say 20 years ago no that's a mistake you're looking at 30 10 or 20 years ago but you were say nineteen hundred years ago when Jesus died Calvary he settlements in question forever there this really made the supreme price made the greatest sacrifice the true ruler of Calvary then we have right to salvation the price is paid so it isn't what you do it's what he done and your personal things are successful brings your salvation and now that he was brutal for our transmission with described River he know they've I've asked to make this statement that's just written a super not by any means if a certain or some animal Eddie's paw in my side and was cutting into my side and killing it there's no need to be trying to cut it all Kenny heard the feels a whole body that's where this was divided him when Jesus bell for thickness of Santa Calvary he had to deal with the heard of it which was sin and during Sonia he dealt with sickness with it good night to cut off the fall he just feel her head and took her Loretta so Jesus come to bridge the human really everything dirty and admiration was see him destroyed and the Garden of Eden and now we are the owners of our eternal salvation as we accept Christ as our Savior our crisis our healer we have both earnest money of our entire rejection when he comes with all of us out of this thing there's no man I've seen every dirty City also he had to dive dirty and if we service in heaven then the Bible says and they got to live and we could not do that so we're tenderly and it's truly God's grace facilities and we spend our own god bless you forgiven and your your confession as long as it holds build your salvation is perfect same as it was divine healing with your personal faith and a resurrected Lord Jesus so tonight I thought I would just and the heaviness little time of fellowship with in this moisture will hold churches and this little group of people can just read it together here the little city of Georgetown and we personally want to be faithful to the weather art and right and those who made this possible we want to thank this letting us have this gym room tonight for this service and I want to thank every Minister the chair and every member of any Church whether it is Protestant Catholic whether it is Orthodox Jew whatever it may be we're grateful for you to be here and want you to know that we've got no strings or no attachments on any one religion whatever you believe as long as you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and he's your Savior you're my brother and sister and so that's the way we believe it and now we have his blessed words here before us now these any man that's able to to pull that back of his fingers that open it this way but there's no man can open the world to understand except Christ himself the Bible was written by inspiration shall we just saw it heard the moment to speak to the author before we open his book our kind Heavenly Father we have gathered here in the name of God eleven son the Lord Jesus who died freely for our sins and trespasses he died that he might save us from a life of sin and would take us home to heaven some glorious day at his coming he died our soul that by stripes that we might be healed of our sickness and he was wounded for our transgressions is bruised for our iniquity the chastening our pieces up on him and with His stripes we were healed saith the prophet now we pray the Heavenly Father to be merciful to us and that we just have this one night of gathering here in this city we pray this you of Bristol's who has made this possible for the gathering and also those who have gathered with us to fellowship around the word and we pray father that you bless everyone that's in divine presence also and they doin I shall all be remembered may it be a night like the apostolic gathering of days when people gather together little groups one night rather Saint Paul was preaching way into the night a young man were taught fell from the upper storey and his life was taken from him and Paul laid his body over the boy carpathian back his life we're thankful to have the same gospel tonight to preach to the people that God still is ring he heals the sick he forgives all of our sins and father we pray tonight it's your breasteses of people and now that is said in our humble word this if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it and we believe that what we ask we receive because it's according to his word and when we leave here tonight different groups in going to our different homes when you visit us in such a way that we'll have a testimony in our heart and our conversation as we leave here will be like those who came from Emmaus on the first resurrection when they had met the resurrected Lord Jesus for the first time they said do not our hearts burn within us when he talked to us by the way may you talk to every heart tonight or we ask in the name of God the loving son the Lord Jesus amen opening to the gospel of Saint Jude in the Bible which is only one book one chapter then the third verse of this chapter I wish to read for just a little text to get a context from it for what I'd like to speak off for the next few moments then we will pray for this safety the letter I gave our observances to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith once delivered unto the Saints may the Lord that is blessings to his word this was wrote from 33 years as you did the day of Pentecost I said that pouring out of the Holy Spirit on the early Saints Judith calls herself a servant and brother to Jesus Christ and he wrote this book to the church and told them that they should earnestly contend the only taste of the sacred writings that's ever told us to contend because we're not supposed to have contentions among us but the earnestly contend a purpose that was once delivered unto the Saints and such we're not to contend and we're not trying to contend but we're wanting to see if I should ask tonight how many Methodist is in the crowd how many baptisms in the crowd how many Nazarenes pilgrim holiness tackling but the hands grow up and even if little group of people here tonight there would be many hands full and each one of us and our German denominations would walk to save our church was confusing for that person that was once delivered to the Saints I want to sit and about the Baptist Church Cemetery want to say it about the Methodist Church someone else about the Catholic Church and some other in about it would be that way into little groups of people I have to believe that they are contending for that page I believe that everyone is contending for the best of to the face but in this means so many different denominations there's got to be something right and something wrong now that's what I've tried to be my brother's sister that you've never seen a male's drunk and sober at the same time you never see the bright white bird there's no such a thing and there's no right all mixed together it's either right or it's wrong and that's the way that I believe God if I believe the same job that live in the days of Moses he wasn't the same job to fulfill every promise that he made that accurate healthy to expecting now there's only that's very sensible and reasonable the things that separate wouldn't do us tonight you're not here just to be seen you wouldn't come out in this rain each other in a little place like this just to be seen you're here for one purpose let's find something good I pray that God will give each one of you something real good that you never forget which one of you Christians they need really sure a charge of him the cars you disturbing better than you've ever serving and all your life now that hope would it do to save a bog observe Moses a God that loves to serve and if he were from the same table today that good for to do to serve a historical God if he's know if his tireless and gone and very elated I want to answer that question you were part of it maybe a time if I think sure the god that's a living in Rogers presence to help me when I have needs so much use a certain time if he knows regard but he is a God now was about a power he's got the power now there something weakened about that dollar isn't a tree right now we want to reason together there's something wrong with his person as he was and he hears it now then there's something wrong with God if God doesn't agree mighty warrior and battle and he was a great healer of diseases and he was aggrieved in all this attributes and the days go by and then he lost all of his power and he nurses the same division Jeffers verbs therapy or thing today wrong if you do the very same thing to our ages until they come again is undisputable in the Bible he Brewster 813 a 13-8 letter says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's the same in principle the same entire the same in resurrection the famous automatic sailing omnipresent the same and all he's just the same as he wasn't everything that he what's wrong he is today the scripture says that's true all things all in is the same Wow so if we each want to believe that but what limited to accrete well if there are bills to the Baptist Church I'll say bad just because that's the church I was ordained Ian they are the Baptist civil I freeze dried the Methodist was their friend right but if we learn that means I have nothing against it that's alright but if we limit the odds of that tree when we limit dollars and we try to say this you can walk this far maybe we don't have the face surreal for Amy did when he took a little walk with God one afternoon my home with you without there and in the very sort of Joshua way who must warm the Rose of Jericho thirteen pounds and and shot as we arrived and the welfare down we may not have the food to shot down wall we may not have faced the world homeless God but let's not say that somebody's where he drive has that faith if sight the definitely with our feet and they had moved on and please serve the Lord bless you my brother and the auto regardless the rapture she longs do that makes no difference as long as he's a Christian and believer and you know Christian friend that's not the repeatability I landed in Bombay India where the largest crowd of 500,000 people are as the crowd ever preached to at one time in my life was in Bombay what I met that I become the bishop of the Methodist Church and many great churches reverently Archbishop a Hindu into his church there and many other the great outstanding churches they met me out there where thousands of people come to the airport and when they come and they thought you have to the Taj Mahal Hotel and they met in a room or similar to this at all so ever through the city in the Ray jaws and everything the Bishop of the Methodist Church he said brother Roman we don't accept you as a missionary he said because we don't want to hear every word missionary prayer because few people in the world with your Western education does not understand the scripture in the life of an oriental book and that's true for all of our theology if you ever go to Jerusalem are to the eastern country where this Bible is this a brand-new book - yes all Western ideas are far from the eastern range unit can understand the parables and so forth of teaching until you go there you see those same custom lived observation and many people say I have repeated senators and students and monasteries and so forth but all of that northern Oh God it's only know one Catechism and so forth like that Tamera God is to know the person Christ himself and to know here is life not to know the text refer to know your creases ordinary catechism his life is to know Christ the person is life eternal and that's what we wish to know now this was suddenly he said everything of theology that we had the Bible a thousand seven hundred years before you of the nation's that's right st. Thomas went down is a suit of the church and preach for st. Thomas the original church that he established in India when he went down from Jerusalem to India and established the church and he said we read the Bible ever since and and we heard Christianity since then but it's a lower order than India I said we have heard of dr. Reid head the man that came to you which is a the president of the great pseudo emissions the greatest the world who came to me and he said brother Branham there are brought of that degrees diverse parallel with them after the anagen I bachelor's degree and all kinds of the Greeks I was about eight years old when he said Bella Bella were realized in all of it he said has the teachers in all after the teachers hasn't been wrong sir you'll never know Christ our theology your presentation you've got to know Christ I've personal experience of being formed again marvelous spirit that comes by changes your - don't you a new creature in Christ Jesus that's right very different that's what makes the difference in our view now that's reason we have so many different denominations in series there are that the real thing Jesus Christ the Son of God said in st. John the Gospel of st. John the 3rd chapter or 3rd chapter for me the Nicodemus except a man be born again of water and spirit we will know never into the kingdom no matter what church you go to but Jesus Christ all words now to be born means to be delivered from now unless you are delivered by the Holy Spirit in your life to a new life in Christ that our preservation are no good but they're good they're all right they're more teachings and so forth which happens but the real personal Christ Jesus that made the meetings what it has been to do and swept around the world is because by the grace of God to introduce to the larger small crowds are resurrected Lord Jesus right now president and he same pilot level of them we don't have suggested it he said brother branham we had to lose we had to divert the bishop said and easier but there's that we're interested in with natural theology so that we're interested in hold jobs versus you Yankees with a spirit oil gifts that can make this Bible written so we know the virus and since after review just admit if we dismiss after the oil and I said that's the main thing is that that's what we want to know how do you say for nothing jobs and make these divine promises that he's made that I've used faith in us and make some realities I said by the grace of God Garfield and that's every nor was entertained by seventeen different religious that denied Christianity some of worship match and some of horses and some powder and some Buddha and muharram perfect and they all have a theology very good everything was works some but you have to do do this do that all routes no grace through it all and that you out for you there's just a rebounding huh I hope not the hurdle that guy here the thread remember Lord Jesus came on the scene there except the resolves over the pillars and so forth and it was over two dollars getting into the ride up to hillary convicted speaker stand and when the Lord Jesus came up and told a man that was totally blind to twenty years the revision over he the nervous will be near our charters every autumn become real the man first assess field that I read Jesus Billy's Emanuel Celler five or ten thousands and thousands came to Christ at one time there are creams would there is always more wrong but will reproduce the Lord Jesus and his promise it's another got your fries and I try to be just as Creepers up laughter can you get the heart started cause it's new bleep and you people work as illicit cereal the textures tonight we love it I do that rib just to write unto you of the common salvation this estate shoes huh writing to the church 33 years after typical and exactly you that you should service recent winters be pleased that anything these things that was once delivered unto the Saints now each one of us in our churches are fired and and I want to be with your church and support your church and heaven for the glory of God let's go back and find out all those subsidies something with whom he said earnestly contend every faith that was once the river to the state now let's go back in the Bible I think that would be logical and proof enough your additives if we wear back and see whether Saints wife had a face they had and if we were example to earnestly contend for this base we found out that gonna face the head when we artisan bread for that thing right now resigned out that it was the theory whatever cause Saints in the Bible there was a new tenant John the Baptist come between the law and Christ which was a death of the key stone that locks the two dispensations together and we have to begin this crisis or he'll talk about Christian service because he is the beginning of Christian Saint John 3 John the Baptist preached in the wilderness of Judea and he never got more medical never done anything but he does confirm the churches and condemned the priests in the red eyes and tell you I was coming on he saw Jesus coming with the right qualities and he said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell the original translation says in whom I am pleased to dwell a me which God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was God in flesh now let's notice reptile writes that he did not ask you something what he was saying we should because that's the face that he introduced to the world that ought to be the face that we should content or not is that right it should be all right I remember too soon as these faggot-ass in ministry he had wished in the and he should come see who I found Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and he said for any good thing come out of Nazareth the sender said he said son please I think that's the best answer that any persons to give it any time is before criticizing anything that's right they might have had a thing back to that ever save the religion of Jesus Christ as men [Music] see and you're not all the world when you become a Christian you are a different person from the world we know that Jesus said I pray father that they might be other little so the scripture says that so you take that to master Jesus mercy Jesus said that to st. Matthew the fifth chapter they'd serve the God in the war at the same time you've got to be one or the other people in this nation and profess to be Christians unbelievable that's such a whole time to make up his mind is because he sees people as part of that system live no difference in the rest of the world that's pretty great but that's true we got the face truth there's probably many waiters sitting here I'll never see again or I'll see you at suggestion and I've got to be truthful and honest because I've got to face the judgment and meet my words again at the judgment I have to be truthful about it now we've ever said that Philip as soon as he found nathanael he said come see we are found and the favors with a righteous man of the men he said to there be any good thing come out of Nazareth Nazareth ravine wicked City very bad at all gangsters and so forth raised up and and bands in those days that came out of masses various fire city he said but anything good come out of Nazareth he said come and see my dream is to do for church [Music] 21st chapter says that he will do that at least second chapter other otherwise for survival he said if anybody join now when he found Nathanael and he said come see so he's already October man Jesus was rather defying Jesus tonight if we went for a bioterrorist Jesus Christ resident Georgetown Indiana but then he was in human flesh like we are tonight that type of a person would we want to find out this may be shocking for me dress just like other man there's no difference in this dress we come to be heard in the street when we come to find a man that was a [Music] [Music] don't even believe in our church and they wear the church of the day well you see you take that church you've got to go by just raise your hand up brother I want you to heal me done that's right this about general everywhere how many Christians believe that they see your hand that's fine then be sure and leave the same Lord Jesus the father surely and the father sending in the life I do know this first lady's been here and I don't know now whether I know you honest or not I've seen that lady about seven has heard from the back or up here but I've seen that I'd respect about the only ones that are that on or off and that's about the only ones that I know all right not at the start hit the moment prepare Heavenly Father this is the moment I have the best of my knowledge about you now our dear Lord Jesus I pray that your help means I know that I know nothing about these people sometimes I know who they are I don't know their troubles romulus you can say anything you wish and I humble myself and submit myself to these that's a great Holy Spirit will come tonight and take this poor unworthy man where the glory of God and anoint and don't let them speak my own lips but let the Holy Spirit speak and do the works that Jesus Christ the Son of God so that he wouldn't do through his people who ever age greatest-looking in Jesus Christ now I'm going to ask you one thing if you'll spend reverently be humble don't doubt leave with all your heart and the Lord God of heaven and little doubt leave your body and make you well it's your thing it's not see by this religious I here center lady I believe I know who the woman is I'm not sure but I believe that I know who she is and I I don't I know you ladies I believe I know who you are now if you'd come here as knowing your name not knowing you is your name shut up there's something I said no oh you were I believe didn't I know you and I used to work for the public service company and something that's right I've seen your face somewhere I know what it I thought your name is set up but set up as your sister is that right and your name is Wilson yes well I'm glad to see you again sister our Lord bless you now I as your brother in Christ you know that I don't know what you're here for do i I don't know no ma'am it's a it's a mystery to me that I do not know not if the Lord Jesus will let me know what you are here for and what you want of him if he will make himself so positive that and he'll declare what you want then will you accept it as coming from him you will all right how the audience is touching her board and you see the recorders going that's right are you watching ah your peace speech anything to tell this woman but she's here for we're not if he the same spirit that spoke to the woman at the well that know where her trouble was would that be right her faith in what is being done will determine her healing not to you in the audience that doesn't have prayer card believes with all your heart that Jesus Christ into here they heal you if you believe with all your heart you won't have to be in this prayer life you certainly want one thing you have to do have faith in God now I would ask you then if there is epileptic present and anybody's been in the meetings knows what epilepsy does it sometimes carries on when I just be reverent yes that's still another up takes place you said still and just leaving the Lord Jesus and praise that's the Heavenly Father to be kind but not if you are an unbeliever I would not stay see so now this is our plain church this is facts we're facing things I just only had a few moments longer or another night that I could explain to you what these things are that you can see what they really are about scriptural terms they give medical name but what they really are in the side of the Bible and sister here is standing before me ah it's not a telepathy no sir I feel you're not you you couldn't hide your life now if you had to see his spirit easier now how many ever seen the picture of it where they took it to some Washington DC the only supernatural beings ever photographs can be proved in the world they
