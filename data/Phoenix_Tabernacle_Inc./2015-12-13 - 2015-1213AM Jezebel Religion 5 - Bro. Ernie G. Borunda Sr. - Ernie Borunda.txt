mind made up amen are you decided to follow Christ amen amen forgive me um it's uh kind of difficult to stay calm everyone knows that I'm a bit shooked up um I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for me it's a great privilege I find myself very happy and thankful with God to be able to be part of this engagement the the young man that we have before us here is brother Daniel Michael mun Dan Miguel and uh uh are your parents here he um he he's he's a very good good man I uh you know I'm I'm a I I can't wait for them to get married they want to wait till November and I told my daughter I said what what do you to wait so long for was well we want to make something nice for the church something nice for for you know our wedding ceremony don't don't worry about that even if you give us sandwiches and a piece of cake that's it and the reason why I can't wait for them to get married we're a missionary family brother Bernie has asked us 15 16 years ago to be on the missionary field and my family and I have always been together and I can't wait to take this young man with me brother Alex trained him out there he trained them in the field so I'm excited this morning I'm very happy and as you all know this pretty girl that we have before around so they can see you this pretty girl is Anna Ruth Romero fio Anna Ruth Romero for those of you who didn't know this she also comes from the lineage of the fio family and I believe that's very awesome I believe the fio family is a very special family brother Francisco fio one of the best ministers that we have known in this message I I have a lot of respect for him and his family so for for for for for her to be AIO that really means a lot and so I'm very proud that uh she's my daughter she's very gifted when it comes to music as you all know she plays the organ the guitar the bass the drums the violin and and I I I truly is how you call it girl and as you know she's a very good pianist I believe she's one of the best pianist in this message and I wouldn't expect anything less than that because she's been watching one of the best pianists that we all know which is my sister Joan and you all know she's good and so I'm very happy and I besides I'm I'm I'm getting very close to 50 she's uh and I can say this because she's my daughter she she's already 25 years old so she's not 18 or 19 or 20 she's 25 so she better get married I I love going to Disneyland and I can't wait for her to have her children so I can have fun with them in Disneyland before I turn 60 [Music] I uh I I I I want to thank them first for honoring our pastor the reason why I'm I'm I'm speaking in English is because he doesn't speak in Spanish so I can't wait to get on his case for that too he's going to have to learn Spanish and uh I I I respect both of them for for for honoring brother Bernie our pastor for honoring this church and for honoring their parents uh they went to see brother Bernie last Thursday and I'm not going to tell you what he told them but if you want to know you can come and talk to them he approved of this and he also prayed for them and I really I really appreciate that they did that and so uh uh I just want to thank all of you who who who who really love my daughter I I know almost all of you here love my daughters and I really want to thank the uh Theo family and I know that have different last names now are andr others are Dominguez some are and and Dominguez last names but you know who I mean when I say the kto family Theon family the Garcia family sister Joan I I I really appreciate that she have and there's there's ministers who have shown their love to me for my daughter brother Alexa has been one of brother Ernie and there's some of you that I just can't thank you enough and so uh we uh we want to make sure that even though our brother Bernie who is our pastor and for those who think that brother Bernie is not our pastor let me let me make it clear to you brother Bernie is our pastor this is our church and I don't know that I I know the devil doesn't like to hear this we're not going nowhere this is our church and this is where we are going to stay so we better begin to pray for each other love one another and fight together till the end so even though our pastor already prayed for them privately we we we want to make it known publicly we really appreciate you just just like brother Bernie told you you are a good boy I'm very happy very proud to to have you as a part of our family um and I really mean that let me just ask them a couple of questions I want to I want to ask Daniel first as as you look at Anna is is this the the girl that you that you love and and have chosen to ask for marriage is is she the one no doubt okay we just want to make sure that when I came to brother Paul to ask if I could marry my my wife ask one question let me ask you just one question I go yes sir he goes uh can you live without her and I said why do you think I brought her to you I can't live without her I think that explains why I married so soon and so we just want to make sure that he knows there way in the world that you can live without her and that's the main thing Anna is this the the man that you have chosen to promise yourself to get married to they've known each other for about two years so so this is not something that just started yesterday they uh they've been knowing each other for for for for a few a few for some time so do you have a token that you have with you so we can seal this engagement brother R will you please come [Music] forward I am I thought I wasn't going to cry and I'm so excited right now that grateful with God for this like I said brother ber I already pray for them but we want to do it publicly now there's a there's a minister here an elder of the church brother AR mag who I know know he loves my daughter very much and I I just felt inspired by the Lord to ask him to pray for them we want to make sure that they understand that this is not a wedding ceremony so you still must respect each other I'm not just a a minister and I'm not even though I don't have the title here but I'm I'm an elder of this church so as an elder and Minister I'm asking you till the day that you come before God's people you come before God and before God's minister to to then be married okay and so brother AR will you please pray for [Music] them [Music] let's bow our heads and [Music] pray father we come before you Lord this is a very solemn moment for a very special couple for a very special family Lord what a great privilege it is to find ourselves to to find ourselves in this scene here what a beautiful thing Lord it seems like just a few days ago that brother betho was going to get married he and his wife we we were young then Lord the days have passed much water has went under the bridge many situations many hard times a lot of good times many blessings from the Lord and here stands his daughter today before us with the man that she has chosen a beautiful couple Lord with a with as as brother Betto has said that they went and and stood before our pastor and that he he blessed them Lord he prayed for them he gave the brother or the the the uniting his seal of approval Maybe to some that's not that's not significant but to us it's very significant those of us who have been married for a long time how important it is to to be married to the right person your whole future will depend on it that's how we succeed getting strength from one another encouraging one another when when someone is down or things are not going right then you can turn to your partner to your strength giver and they can encourage you to do even things that you have not even imagined [Music] so we want to come this morning Lord and Echo the words of your servant brother Bernie we want to present this couple here publicly and we ask as a Congregation of the Living God that you would bless them Lord that you would give them happiness through their marriage life Lord and that you would give them those things that make them happy without saying a lot that's a lot that you would grant them the knowledge of the mystery of of marriage that you would bless them Lord with with uh children and may they be a blessing to the their grandparents bless them richly Lord we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen don't don't don't kiss her but just give her a little hug okay that's good God bless you you can go can we give him an Applause before going I just want to say one thing uh they

morning and God bless you youd like be so kind as to open up your Bibles to the Old Testament just go to the first part of the not the about first quarter of the Old Testament or so from Kings chapter I greet you everyone in the name every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you God we're going to be praying right now and then get into to the reading of the scripture Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for everything that you have done for us for we are truly one of them Lord God there are those that are one of them Lord one of those that are one of those one of [Music] so we thank you Lord that we are one of them those for For Whom the blood was shed those names were were put on the Li's Book of Life one of them and we thank you for that Lord we had nothing to do with with that yet we do have something to do with it now because it's our attitude and our choice that we make we've heard the brothers lately the last few Services say that that when one of those one one of those that come back down with the Lord Jesus Christ to Earth riding on white horses they're there because they're one of them that by their own choosing by their attitude that they took toward word of God they be are one of them and we trust that we are those one of them Lord we cannot thank you enough for that Lord Jesus Christ for the continuous revelation of the word that you have given to us it continues coming to us Lord we thank you Lord for we know you're communing to us through your word bless the reading of the word this morning children this morning may you help them to understand what I'm trying to get to Lord understand that I I am I have fought that demon that has tried to attack me as I've been studying on this topic that Pharisee Spirit Lord that legal legalistic spirit it's not it's this is not brought in that manner Lord not brought in a denominational Spirit Lord is brought through because it comes from my heart and I love the people Lord God I don't care what the devil says I know that I love the people and God knows that so we thank you Lord for everything that you've done for us may we each leave a that well this is easy Lord God thank you God and this is so so so so easy to ask you Lord because we know you're going to do it that each one will leave here with exactly what they came for Lord because that is your word that's what will happen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray first First Kings 16 just two quick verses and then you may you'll be you you may be seated after the reading and Ahab son of omry did evil in the side of the Lord God of the Lord above all that were before him okay now verse 31 says and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took as a wife Jezebel the daughter of ethal King of the zidonians and went and served Baal and worshiped him you may be seated this morning we're going to be continuing on the on the the study that we have taken up a few quite a few months ago on jeel religion those some may think that my focus is to attack the the sisters it's not that how many of you remember that I said that you you would notice the change in my Ministry that it would be different that I would be uh it would be different like for example I I don't have to preach to brother uh Emilio brother's generation you know and other brothers that I see here brother art but those that that have been us had been with us since Filmore that those over here when brother Bernie preached uh Dogma number four remember that he got he got attacked for back there with a little baskets so to have the sister the ring whatever had and remember he got but many of the younger people do not have that historical perspective they they really don't know what we're about they don't know that brother Bernie unless you heard it a few a couple months ago number four when he preached pretty hard that's what talked about Fashions he said I have haven't even touched three% of what I wanted to say so if he would able if you were if time would have allowed he would have preached 33 messages 3 33 * 3 is 9% right yes or yes are you nervous you I don't know what I'm going to say so I know what I going to read but I don't know what I'm GNA say PR for me so he would have pre he would had to preach 33 messages to complete out the I'm going to finish off with the fascist today my target audience I told the brother is not the older generation it's those that are around 35 to 40 That's the max Maxim all the way down to about what what are the ones that come over from Sunday school 16 gradu that's what I'm talking to so many of you say yeah I already I already I already knew that I already I knew that that's okay this you're supposed to know that but those that don't know it brother Bernie told me when you go somewhere so I have more I I think I have more of an approval from him to bring a teaching here in Phish tabern phoen and uh so um I I ain't a teacher because I I retired as a teacher yeah I don't get paid as a teacher anymore yeah I'm not a teacher but uh we're going to be talking about Jezebel's Fashions so we talked about the shoes two times before that we talked about Washington and then Abraham remember that they talked about two times on the shoes we didn't I didn't even finish it CU I only touched a little bit about it remember I'm attacking Jezebel not the sisters because the word of God says come out of her my people come out of that Harlot Jezebel system she's got to come out of us too I catch myself thinking like that jeze with that Jezebel logic because we're that's what we're taught say that again that's the way we are taught try to be a little bit more specific in my pronunciation because I kind of Mumble a little bit that's fine our children are taught in that system they all inclusive oh we're all just one big sweet group now didn't brother say that we're all one great sweet group now but Satan won't let it stay that way in the last just the last seven years seven years seven years we have one of the greatest presidents greatest that has kept his word and I respect him for that I respect the office but I I don't respect that man but I respect one thing about him that he said that we he said we are going to transform America fundamentally we going to fundamentally transform America now those of you that that uh hate America I know there are some maybe here there are some of you there on the internet that are in the message like I said I didn't know I was going to say you can at least be happy for him giving America what she deserves don't tell me that that spirit is here I already feel it cuz already attacking my legs here think about what he's done he has kept his word Satan said I will Ascend above the Stars stars and be I'll be like the most high God in the house of God be as like as God right promise given promise fulfilled Obama promise given promise fulfilled why doesn't he do this it just he's got to do that he ain't going to do it because stubbornness is as witchcraft how many of you know that that scripture only three or four of you read Samuel Saul why didn't you kill all those things you know that's another message al together talking about fascist attacking Jezebel yeah does it hurt about when we talk about Fashions yes when we see that we're affected by it hurts oh then you then you want to Kill the Messenger for because of the message got a baby in the bathtub the B baby in the bathtub right Wasing the baby then you say oh that that Dove soap whatever it is a 994 99444 99 4 400% pure soap it's not 100% so I'm going to throw it out in the tub and you and there goes the baby going in other words there is an expression say you throw you throw the baby out with the bath water that's why I like to read you don't like what I say and I know some of you don't that's okay I just want to quote what brother BR said then you can rationalize with him okay I'm not being mean either right now we already talked about uh us paralleling Israel we talked about twice finish off from F fashist today brother sisters it's going to get gooder and good when we get when we start talking about the the the woman next time you're going to see how she's all around her she's uh we're going to talk about her religion then and it's going to get like a almost like a PG message PG-13 16 here because I'm have to say some things that are pretty harsh it's all around us and we think it's okay then we're going to get into religion then because you won't understand the religion now you you won't know what to be looking for now unless you know what she was back then then when you see what she was back then and then you look over here you're going to say like me oh my God I didn't know it was there there it is I ain't angry either smile half a smile her religion then the modern system like I was talking to a uh uh someone the other day and you might call call it a disagreement and I said I know we disagree but isn't it beautiful that all the Pastors in the valley are just one great sweet group one great big sweet [Music] family think about it and then when we finally get to it Jezebel the witch you saw a young lady presented this morning those of you that want to study everything brother Bram said about the preview of the Bride and when that church from Asia and other countries Europe and when it got to the one in America a whole filthy Bunch was by a a witch so let's move quickly because we have to do I I didn't mean to get into that but that's okay I didn't want to but the Lord wanted me to say that okay so let's let's uh that's what we're going to be uh talking about brother Bram now I know most of you have already done so and I trust that I'm not being sarcastic when I and I'll say like this I know that most of you that are following the message and following what brother bam has said what brother bam has told you hey you have already read or heard and as there's a I would recommend uh 1956 for you to read paint to face Jezebel it's a pretty hard hitting message from there I will be re reading a few things um don't forget these little words coming out of here this just a transference over from things happen like this I have to say this because I who I am sorry these things happen they should be down here but follow but when they when they convert from one system to the other point to other system I guess it's worship or something like that I'm not sure what uh those things come out of there so I try to make it pretty for you but that's what matters is the word Jezebel was a pagan she hated Jehovah Jehovah God she hated him she hated him she married into Israel think about that who who God was Jehovah she married into Israel but she got baptized right she got Sanctified s sanitized purified all glorified came was a born again Christian is that right no she brought her old filthy old gods right with her now I'll give you a little preview of what's coming out you know what she brought with her the gods of sex you don't believe me study the message study what brother BR said she brought the gods of Sex Over did she get conver like that quickly she hated god Jehovah she hated God's people that hatred that sin in her heart her attitude and her character made her what she was click click all right I just move on we go to the next one brother that's so fine if not I I'll like this thing's not clicking anymore and we brother says we take the same attitudes towards God and so forth we'll get the either the same reward we either going to be one of them or one of those so when you're thinking I'm one of them I'm one of them you are one of them it's your character your attitude all these things identify as you're really one of them or one of them those forgive me I was raised in the message brother bam 19 years on up so 1965 roughly when we started hearing tapes brother Brown and just to relax relax a little bit you can't translate this but do the best you can okay brother man says don't pay no attention to those [Music] isms because there's soon going to be WMS heard brother say that right brother I'm going to transl incorrectly forgive meos don't forget don't don't worry about those isms Sonos someday they'll be wassam that's how brother brandham spoke with a play on words but what he would say it wasn't to make fun but it was for us to think about just there's only one is is or an I am because God said I am the I am what was God doing millions and trillions an Infinity of years before that he was he was something what was he doing that would make me go crazy yes brother and I am I am crazy but I'm not violent those times [Music] Brethren is part of the Jezebel reasoning it's part of the instruction and education from Jezebel a long time ago that that that never existed that time never existed time is a creation it's a dimension that was created and one day I'm going to say it like this when Elijah the Elijah of our day is is the Lord Jesus Christ say that again oh so that way you don't get get Scandal I'm going to say the Lord Jesus Christ he's gonna bring these loose ends together that's the way eternity was before it was a circle see is that right that's why the bride when when she gets engaged they give her a diamond right sister Debbie correct de a rock right I want my my stone was that what I call it a stone or Rock what they call I want my rock I got my rock I want my gold now but sooner or later it it it reflects the seven colors right Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godl kindness at the end it's pure gold that's a seal right that's when the adoption comes down that's what we're waiting for not just the Rock same blessings same penalties okay brother bam said the following in the message Jezebel religion he said it's like this I can't I can't I can't even begin to say how he says it but I'll say something like this talking ining and he says something like he's talking then he say then he says something like this may you never forget this afternoon isn't that awesome isn't that a good message to listen to because it's not just on the surface oh I heard it already one time 25 30 times and it just it's like there's more there may you never forget this afternoon never forget this afternoon never forget this afternoon okay brother Bernie said Bible or Dogma number four didn't even go over 3% brother BR says you have to get angry with the devil faith is our Victory and then in paint the brother man says then you can see why I'm so angry not with you with the things the devil that's making you do that if you go out and clean up just because I said that you're still wrong that's what he said you're still wrong so brother what what if you had lived with Jezebel what if you had lived in the Days of Elijah and Jezebel the 2500 years ago how long ago00 years ago Hollywood was starting Hollywood Hol wood uh Hollywood look into what Holly and wood means what's your last name brother not not because of him H look for the word Holly and look for the word wood was starting with all of her pain and fashion got all the daughters of Israel doing the same thing and when one old man standing there up there and battering against it Israel entered into a Decay after the fall of Solomon after Solomon's death I'm going to need some help from some strong brothers because we got to break through that break that kind of heavy right now those of you know that this is the word of God that I'm saying just say Amen to the word how many of you know that when Solomon died Israel entered and broke up into is Judah and Israel say Amen amen then it got worse and worse and worse and worse until finally the 10 tribes were just lost then the last two tribes they were carried away into Babylon that's why I love the word zerubabel that's why study it and you'll see that it refers zerubabel the great Prince before God the prophet of God told us that he's a type he's a figure of the seven Church H messenger and zerubabel means born in B Inon where was our Prophet born in Babylon in Babylonia in church age to Catholic parents you know well you know we don't have time to if we could preach this beautiful you know one old man standing up long time ago Hollywood start a long time ago that Spirit hasn't gotten weaker and weaker it's gone stronger strong I hope you believe that this is brother Brandon preaching canans in 1956 a real Born Again child of God loves the word and stays with the word and with the Bible God help you Canadians don't never let that American pollution get in here 1956 60 years ago don't never let that American pollution get in here and that's right

Jezebel daughter of Hell the wife of nimrod nimrod the pope how many know that's true those of you that have read at least the title at least read the title if you're not going to read hop to Babylon the brother to at least read the title the papacy oh His Two Babylons title Two Babylons and then the author Alexander Reverend Alexander hisop rendo aleandro genius which the pope has said that the fundamentalist ask brother Tim perz God bless him for sending me that quote so we don't have any room for fundamentalists thank you think about that the same one that was coming from Brazil that was like this on the airplane and was asked your Holiness um are you going to stop homosexual priests from men from coming into the priesthood if a man feels the call of God whom am I to judge is got room for K uh weirdos of homosexuals but he doesn't have space for you fundamentalist you look up you look up his UPS to Babylons and you'll say and they'll say it is not a scholarly work M lie m he didn't know too much about the ancient the old languages lie number two and today it's only sought or read by fundamentalists well less and less I guess because you know we we need to get going people I'm talking to the old you're 35 40 or above or above I'm not talking to you we had our chance to read that book already we wanted to but you still have a chance to read it but I'm I'm highly I'm highly inspiring your to read the book brother says brother Alex says read the book but in there it says the title is his love two Bab Reverend Alexander aleandro and the subtitle is the the papacy proved to be the worship Nimrod to Nimrod and his wife yes we've heard it before but don't you dare I'm currently Canadians don't get that American pollution over here going be getting it from America America getting is getting it from Hollywood Hollywood is getting it from the daughter of Hell Jezebel where's it at well here's what has stripped our women it's made immoral everywhere The Whole World's

bless you Brothers the Lord bless you um uh brother Betto came up here and he said you couldn't come up here without saying something and I come up here and I feel like I can't say anything I'm up here to thank everyone that helped in the 2015 convention your off um your efforts and your offerings uh your time uh I understand that every department has its battles um and we have to move or translate ourselves to a different place to have our conventions that means to disarm our machines or dismantle dismantle our machines um put them in a different spot and uh put them back in place once more and when the convention is over we have to dismantle them once again and put them back here at home and everything has to be done without the problems being seen all this cause causes stress and [Music] anxiety I'm referring to the office the department of deacons the system sound the musicians they have to prepare themselves weeks before just to sing one song the department uh Department of recording [Music] uh the kitchen Department of Children it's a lot of work not not one man can do it we have to do it in a team and that's why I come to thank you um [Music] speaking on the department of recording and sound system I just want to let you know since we began I say broadcasting span since we began to put our services in the internet then we have 3.3 million minutes watched if someone sees the service for 10 minutes or the complete service accumulates a 3.3 million this is worldwide uh this convention we almost doubled the quantity of people that were watching the conventions it's because of the effort that you do and we're so grateful as you know I get involved in the department of the kitchen and even in still in that department there's other departments um well there's some brothers who say the only thing I can do is clean but without them just imagine the trash there's a brother who says I'm only the one who gives the water water boy the water boy uh but I answer without water there's no life um there's some brothers who all they do is wash dishes and uh other ones that all they do is serve and others just cook and there's one that gives orders uh and sometimes we speak a bit rough and we want to [Music] apologize when you're working the stress and the anxiety Show Your Colors and first of all we want to apologize if we did something wrong because it takes about 45 minutes to serve everyone and when someone comes to ask for a second plate they get us when we're stressed and we want to apologize for that we're not perfect but we're going to Perfection um I've done it for a while from what I was to what I am night and day and now I see the brothers that are beginning in the kitchen and in 10 years they'll see that it's different all this is preparation more or less two uh months before the convention begins we're already uh speaking I'm speaking about all the Departments um and what are we going to feed them the menu has to be tried when you go and buy cups uh napkins each meal we have to buy the right things and then the other day I was watching a documentary of the Queen of England and she was going to give a a dinner a feast and I was umed amazed that everything every meal everything had to be tried and and I thought well that's what we do but we just uh serve in plastic plates because as you know there different things that happen um and before I forget I would like to thank the youth because in this year they helped served and I'm very grateful for their help um they also gave a big donation and at the end of this year we could return more than $1,000 to the funds of the church and this is the first year and this is a year where we have spent less than any other year and looks like we had more variety in the food so after convention ends the the work does not finish we still have to get rid of the trash clean to return the tables and chairs and many things so we return to work to be able to rest say that I want to thank all the brothers and sisters that borrowed us their refrigerator what the refrigerators the refrigerators and there are machines so we could cook so then thank you we'll be praying to dismiss blessed God heavenly father I want to thank you Lord for how good you are without your presence we couldn't do anything we wouldn't have a good cheer [Music] Lord we have we have served you from our hearts and I ask Lord that you accept our offerings of sacrifice Lord we ask a blessing on those brothers who came to be with us only for a few moments and I ask that the impression that they left with may it be for the honor and Glory of your name now Lord we'll be dismissing from this place and we ask that you walk with us that you be with us in our vehicles and Lord our children we place them in your hands Lord without you without your presence we're not [Music] comfortable we know the Lord that we need you at our jobs we need you here and over there and Lord our um family members we ask for them may your mercy reach them Lord touch [Music] them because time is short what the brother has spoken it's in our face and we can't see it and Lord permit that your
