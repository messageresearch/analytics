[1:13:49] I saw a world it was revolving out in
[1:13:52] the air in the air I saw like a rainbow
[1:13:56] around her said this is the
[1:13:58] blood and every sinner in the world
[1:14:01] would be condemned and God would take
[1:14:03] your life this very minute if it wasn't
[1:14:05] for the blood of Jesus holding the wrath
[1:14:07] of God off of you then I noticed I draw
[1:14:10] a little closer and I've seen someone
[1:14:12] standing there with persperation and
[1:14:14] tears and blood mixing coming down it
[1:14:17] was the Lord Jesus I've seen the mockery
[1:14:19] spit all over his face I saw the blood
[1:14:22] on his brow and his precious hands
[1:14:25] bleeding I see him dodging like
[1:14:28] that I said my Lord what makes you dodge
[1:14:32] he said my blood has acted as a bumper
[1:14:34] to your sins all these
[1:14:37] years how has my sins did that lord said
