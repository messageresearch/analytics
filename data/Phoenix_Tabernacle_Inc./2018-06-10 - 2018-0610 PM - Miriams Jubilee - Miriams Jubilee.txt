[Applause] [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] well to this evening service this presentation of Miriam's Jubilee god bless you before we get the presentation started there's just a few words that I would like to say the way this got started the way God brought this inspiration well sister Tonya Leyva thoughtless is she she came to me and she said I have this drama that the Lord inspired me to do and I said okay awesome mom's give me the script and we'll see we'll see what happens and a couple years passed by and nothing nothing really happened she I guess she was chewing on the inspiration until she came back from a pine Rock camp right where the Lord the second time well the Lord really really put her put that inspiration hard on her till finally she got the script done and she emailed it to me and when I saw it those a few songs in there that or from some other artists and I thought you know what if we're gonna do something let's do it all original let's see what the Lord inspires for the whole thing so we took that and she asked me she's are you gonna be able to write songs there's we're a month away you're gonna be able to write the music and her husband kind of put it in and he said Tonya that's the gift that the Lord gave him he can write a song in five minutes and I thought speak for yourself like are you are you serious you don't just write a song in five minutes and but his sincerity and his heart really really touched me the faith that he had he was sincere and if the Lord gives me the songs if the Lord will give them to me then yes I believe we can have the songs that we need for the presentation and I got home and wouldn't you know within five minutes of me grabbing the guitar and opening up the pages of the Bible and the book Exodus God gave us the first song and then thanked phrase God praise God and then after that he the rest of the songs for the presentation came so in my heart I know we it's been a bumpy road but the whole entire time God has just been confirming until this moment of when we did it on Friday the Holy Ghost fell down and it was such a blessing for us and we're just praying for the same downpour or harder tonight because it's a different crowd and even if a lot of us have seen this seen it on Friday well we come with different desires every day right and His mercies are new every morning so there's always fresh manna for us and if you come with that desire to receive something from the Lord I pray that you don't go disappointed I also want to just make a quick statement and just apologize beforehand for our unique style in presenting the gospel and how I feel that the Lord has inspired me is not my intention or any of our intentions to offend anybody but we want to present to this generation a story of deliverance in a way that will capture you so you can see that the same God from Moses's time isn't asleep he's the same God yesterday today and forever and he's still opening up barriers opening up red seas for people's life and Pharaohs and taskmasters that would keep us bound spiritually are under the sea defeated and today that red sea is the blood of Jesus Christ so god bless you I hope this is a blessing without any further ado I present to you Miriam's Jubilee [Music] [Music] [Music] this new Pharaoh did not know of Joseph when he
