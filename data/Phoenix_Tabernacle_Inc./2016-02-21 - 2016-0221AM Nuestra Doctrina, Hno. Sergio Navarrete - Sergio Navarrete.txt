fair trade Lord I just want a little bit of Faith Like job to look past my circumstances and symptoms and anchor myself in those three little words God said so that's right and Lord I admit that

children are not baptized they are presented before the Lord Jesus that's why I would like to read the scripture if you want to join me it's in Mark 10:13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuke those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and he said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child you shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them so we will be taking this young one my grandson and for me it is a big privilege Brethren Heavenly [Music] Father Here we have Lord this little one that you have brought us Lord

audience because I can't see them but they can see us among them is included our brother Bernie Garcia God bless you brother Bernie I'm never trying to get any points with him he he knows me he knows what he just knows me I almost never send out greetings when it's time for me to come ad Minister the word but today I feel kind of inspired first I would like to give thanks to my daughter Melissa who just sang that special for those who didn't know that little short girl that was up here right now that's my daughter but I didn't create cre her by myself I still don't have that creative word yet I needed the help of my wife din it's the only one I have but I just wanted you to know her name the mind starts flying a bunch of places greetings to our brotheri from Peru Domingo brail our brother Domingo gav from Brazil [Music] Pao our brother Pablo from guara and one of our old friends our brother fleno martinz from Brother us to call it and I greet once more every one of you look how quick that was this morning we'd like to speak a little bit on on a small uh thought that we believe God placed it in our hearts when I refer to God having placed it in my heart I always try to illustrate it in a certain way me just like you I hear the word of God and that word of God makes contact with an internal being that internal being starts meditating and that's when those uh thoughts become un unroll rolled that's the way I can describe it first up there on the screen we have the scripture which we're going to be reading if you could please stand just for a few moments because maybe later on during the service you're going to be sitting the scripture says in 2 Timothy verse 4 or chapter 4 verse 1 I charge ye therefore before God God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his [Music] [Music] kingdom when you pass 40 it's a little no preach the word be instant in season out of season rep reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they shall Heap into themselves teachers having itching ears you may be seated those are scriptures that I believe are are well known and I remember when us ministers used to get together those are scriptures that in that uh that uh that with that group of people they're very well known he that Paul is talk speaking to Timothy and he's letting them know in advance what's going to happen amen amen in our times a great message came a powerful man sent by God and he came and he told us this I preach the same as the Apostle Paul amen is that right actually I know that the things that we're going to speak be speaking on this morning morning truly aren't new and for that reason because they're not new they kind of bore us a little bit don't tell me they don't because it's the truth while the services was going on here we were patiently waiting in the back room right here and our brother Johnny alv he was talking speaking with us how many of us remember uh last Sunday what a wonderful message he brought well he who knows a little bit about the message can understand and what level he was speaking on or let's put it this way in which manner the Holy Spirit was speaking through a servant of God amen amen I know that we're not all on the same level I know that well I make this small comment because if he was speaking in this level today we're going to be speaking on this level but it has to do with the same he made a comment that really grabbed my attention he said us the old we can't throw the young to the side no because we need the young amen amen that takes effect when we apply it to our spiritual life am another little thing that I heard is that he made a comment and that's something that we're going over in the back right now he was commenting on it and I feel led to comment it because it goes along with what we're going to speak today how it was that Moses the people were circumcised once and then when the Great uh Warrior Joshua came they had to circumcise again a little weak it's okay I'm just saying what we're listening to so it's very important the circumcision amen amen now we want to speak a little bit on our Doctrine that's our small thought this morning our Doctrine me when I'm listening to the message when I'm here in this place and I'm sitting there listening to the minister I'm very hard of learning but I do get the small simple things for example our brother Ernie Bruna Senor I'm be trying to be sure to say his name correctly because many years ago it was his turn to preach I saw his smile and in that time I was the director of I was the song [Music] leader he knows what I'm talking about brother Ser was the director of the songs and you know I I was s and I was like no you know brothers and I started going on and you know how sometimes we're little and when I said his name Al I said brother Alex barunda Jr you guys know we we make but I'm pretty sure that one of the times that he he ministered he commented about the import of our name amen amen he said that the the prophet said the sweetest thing that me and you can hear is your own name amen amen so he made mention of when the Lord Jesus Christ hears his name that there he's sitting down well he gets emotional he he likes it well wait what do you mean a Christian isn't supposed to get all emotional let's speak clearly let's be sincere he likes he pleases him and actually it seems that his name is being taken out of our worship I'm not critiquing in the incorrect way because there's good critiques and incorrect critiques we're trying to be right down the middle so then how important is it that he hears his name because neither you nor I can make contact with God if we don't go through the name which he gave us to if you go to God in the name of William maram Brandon he will not listen to you you heard me right right if you go to go ask something of God now God is an object of worship you go you get on your knees Lord I need this in the name of William Mari and Bram he's not listening to you actually he doesn't see us is the first disadvantage we have in front of God he doesn't see us the prophet says that if he would see us he would have destroyed us already the only thing he sees is that precious blood that covers the whole earth brother I thought it just covered me no sir it covers every human being that exists because every person has the opportunity to accept the sacrifice so then if we come there and whatever Idol that may exist whatever name that might exist if you go before God and you ask something in the name of that Idol he won't answer imagine if he doesn't answer you if you use the name of William Mari and Brandon well from there go on down the list whoever you want to place the idol that you want to place there won't answer be sure of that so then he came and he told us brother Bram came and he told us I understand that he's the angel I understand that to him was given the Mysteries I understand that there's no more Mysteries if there's a mystery there that I don't understand is because of because I don't understand but the mystery has been revealed all the Mysteries have been revealed now our Doctrine to speak about our Doctrine we need to know what is a Doctrine well the dictionary says there's many many different definitions but the dictionary says set of ideas teachings or principles defended by a religious movement also It also says that Doctrine a belief or set of beliefs held and Tau by a church political party or any other group in other words a Doctrine it's a teaching it brings instructions it tells you how to function that Doctrine is to learn it or to teach it and there's many kinds of doctrines the the dictionary tells us that says that there's Christian doctrine watch how they place it there's Christian doctrine there's church doctrine and H astrology there's astrology Doctrine there's different kinds of Doctrine it's a belief amen amen that's what the dictionary says now a question for you please don't answer what is our belief it's to meditate right well if you know the message you're going to say the same thing that the messenger said here he's speaking in church order it's in the year 1958 also in 63 he went back to order of the church now for that one yes I cut that I know that from 1963 when those seven angels came it's a new order amen I know that I'm not speaking on that remember what I told you we're on this level right here right here on the earth because when you make contact with the earth look I'm going to give you an example in the morning wake up early don't put any shoes on go outside and make contact with the Earth let's see what you feel you're going to feel a contact a physical contact and that's going to help you throughout the whole day because your body since this it makes contact with the dirt and since we're like trees something happens to us that's why the majority of people are all sick they don't make contact with nature and the spiritual is the same thing we have to make contact spiritual contact with God and you don't got to go anywhere God already has you ready and he's inside of you now that's to debate I understand that too but let's go see what brother brandham says now watch right now that I mentioned brother Brandon's name this thought comes to [Music] me just like our songs brother Ernie as you mentioned I've mentioned it as well a couple of us have mentioned it but God gives us a little bit more and this thought came to me that way the same way like our our our our songs no longer contain so much of the name Jesus watch the Ministers of the message 100 times they'll say the name of William Mari and Bram and once or twice Jesus Christ's name that's wrong because he didn't save us the one that paid the price was God himself in a human body that had the name the Lord Jesus Christ because that that's why that the heir of this Holy Spirit doesn't make contact with the believer because there is Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost but also there's the Antichrist in form of a spirit and we like humans we're so human that we look like Adam first thing did he went went and he hid in between the trees he knew he was naked and he covered himself that's why the Christian can't have the victory because he's only covered with religion did you know that religion is of Satan it's started in the Tower of [Music] Babel but there's Christians not not religion but to be a Son of God or a daughter of God or a chrisan starts inside of you inside of me that's why we're always defeated I'm waiting on God this is me okay and say what I say please forgive my expression here's brother said oh oh God come to me id idiot I'm inside of you and you haven't realized it the messenger says when you're born there's a spirit that's around you that's the spirit of Satan because you because you already have that representation inside of you the problem the problem is that we have to discover it the only the only that didn't have soul was the serpent think about that he didn't have a soul he had a spirit but he didn't have a soul the soul is the nature of the spirit Adam when he sinned when he sinned he sinned and we were never able to be like him amen amen because we were already born with a Fall Fallen nature but it's nature it's a nature listen to me it's a nature and that's God's nature how brother if you have to repent you have to be justified you have to be cleaned by the word be Sanctified and then comes the baptism of the Holy Ghost and many times the the minister didn't even say it right because the message the future home of the Bride brother Bram says that he's coming that the Holy Ghost is coming in fire in fire it's to clean out all our impurities that's the new birth and brother what is the new birth re is a personal revelation is the personal revelation of Jesus Christ in you a revelation it's something that you can see but it doesn't mean that it isn't there it's right there but you need to be able to see it that's why the scripture says faith cometh by hearing the prophet says just a moment but hearing isn't Faith did you hear me hearing isn't faith faith is already in you it has to sprout it has to sprout inside of you inside of you there's a soul and that soul is Fallen it's dirty but inside of that soul is God's soul and when you hear the word little by little it starts cleaning it starts [Music] cleaning so then why are we waiting why haven't we been penetrated impregnated by man's dogmas they have taught us that everything comes from the outside in to have control over the Sons and Daughters of God God wants to have control of you and of me and for him to have control of you and me it's because he's in you he's always been in you oh brother bham says when your people know who they are when your bride knows who she is and there we are in the avocado tree waiting for the avocado to fall it's inside of you and inside of when have you ever seen that Satan was first where Lucifer was created Lucifer was created by God and when he found that you're not that he wasn't perfect he became then he started going down and he came into Satan and Satan is like a good adversary and then he started AC like the devil Father of Lies that is Satan that is Lucifer but the Son of God you you've always been a child of God if you're sick you've already been healed what you need to do is accept it accept it the brother put such a precious example there was the blind man the brother prayed for him and he started testifying I can see I can see that's how brother I can see I can see I can see I can see I can see I can see and one day this miserable one is going to be able to [Applause] see we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching the apostolic blessings for people of this day we believe in the Full Gospel that means if he's saying that we believe in the Full Gospel it means that somewhere there there's an incomplete gospel which one are you listening to and which one am I listening to We Believe in an Apostolic Church what's that brother Sergio read your Bible go to acts look how the first apostles acted brother Sergio but you should give all the information who told you that who told you that lie I'm speaking from my heart like a Son of God your responsibility as son or daughter of God is to do the same thing I did go and dig through the scriptures because there you will find eternal life that's just a courtesy because the Son of God more than all the minister should consider the people and recognize that God has placed a gift in him and not like God is learning and come and say brother oh or son since I like you here's a gift here goes another gift brother no let's keep [Music] reading and believe that all the signs and wonders that was spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returned do we believe that Brothers in The Invisible audience do we believe that I can't hear it brother but when I see you your acts will prove it to me my Works will show it to you my Works will demonstrate to all of you Brothers you know my life and if you know me you know that when I commit an error I try to fix it but I don't stay right there the ground that's what I did out in the world I would I would roll around not like you but I would get all rolled over but when I came to the understanding of who I am something inside of me I don't have the quote but brother bam says when you have the Holy Ghost that's another thing we're going to get into it Jesus Christ himself is inside of you and everything that's not correct it starts getting thrown out oh I believe I thought I thought that first I have to be real good be born again so that Jesus Christ can be inside of me who told you that lie when the Holy Ghost is in you which is the Lord Jesus Christ everything that is not correct everything that is incorrect he starts throwing it [Applause] out that's the God that I serve that works inside of me to throw everything out of me not to grab something and put it on and be a saint that's garbage that's religion that's of the devil God doesn't learn brother and sisters we learn we believe in those things and believe they are to be set in order that the church has its Order each church has its Doctrine and Order and [Music] discipline we believe in the water baptism by IM Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic teaching of the Bible we believe ination by faith you didn't know there it's in the Bible Romans 51 we believe that after a person being justified by faith has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ here's the clue but it's possible that this same person could have the habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh we already know that right amen correct amen but can we swallow that or should we continue with that religious covering I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance amen that when we are born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god so that is not just for me or for the minister that's right here behind the or around the world it's for every son and daughter of God then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that's we believe in sanctification and we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified unclean habits have gone from the person he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ you remember brother Bernie would sometimes tell us don't you believe that acts let's just say just for example acts one or acts two then acts four no no no the Bible has its correct sequence and we take that you see justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost it's correct but watch how we apply it we believe then that he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy go Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer that's where we might start disagreeing we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service brother Bram says in early spiritual experiences that constitutes the new birth three elements amen amen water blood spirit go to that message he's speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ and those three elements applied to the believer give you the new new birth but where does it start everything that God created everything that God created he created it through faith yes or yes faith is revelation and he spoke the word and he had faith in what he spoke and there it was without god without faith it's impossible to please God you you have to have faith you have to have Revelation you have to find that Revelation inside of you because inside of you is the representation of God when you can see that is when you hear the word the word of God is the original seed that word makes contact with that internal person and from there Sprouts life from there Sprouts life from where from inside of you because you have a soul you're not a descendant of the serpent you are God's seed you think that God Is Gonna Come and it's gonna say mo you ready there's the seed you think that meditate meditate you believe that that God is jumping from person to person seing the the farmer has already se he already put the good seed the one that fell on good dirt one gave 30 a 70 another gave a 100 but why do we want someone to give if they're only going to give 30 huh that's scripture this is where I wanted to get to brother Bernie preached minimum 28 messages of the three stages of GRA is that right for those who have heard who haven't well let's listen hear it three stages of Grace and here brother Bram says the holy spirit is not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer where does it fill him from if the Lord Jesus Christ says that when you come to him rivers of Living Water rivers of living water come from you from your soul don't look outside look [Applause] inside the Deep isn't up it's down it's down it's down it's down down down the more you dig inside of you inside of you you're going to find that which I'm speaking to you of one time brother Ernie uh commented I don't know if it was in Brazil and brother BR says it all has said it all he said the seed the the the seed has the power inside of itself it has everything it has everything what is to be perfect is to have need of nothing to be complete that's what it is to be perfect the Son and Daughter of god is perfect because God is in them please stand like always we never get to finish the messages that we prepared we go over here we go over there but God I'm sure that God is speaking to your heart our objective is that you like me that we may be able to find that button that we may touch it and this dirty body corrupted may turn into a uncorruptible [Music] body I'm not waiting on anyone the only one I'm waiting on is in me how important when you when you're sure you're you're mature that there's a God that exists then you start to do this can you come here [Music] let's say I'm very mature and brother Bram used this phrase very often come up here come up here don't be a participant isn't that right he who knows the message is going to understand and whoever doesn't go ask around brother come up here we're in the time like I said one my my job isn't to get into the seventh uh seals but I do know that we're in time of the scene and we're actors not just to speak what does it help me to tell you you're naked you're hungry if I don't give you something to if I don't give you food so you can what good does it do me to tell you come up here if I don't this come up here come up here come up here come up here that's what we need to do don't me Don't Preach me a message look at me a [Music] message the old needs the Young The Young needs the [Music] old help me help me it's it's mutual let's do it by [Music] works one time I commented to brother Alex Bruna Jr I said brother our children limit us and he stayed looking at me I don't know if he's here but it's the truth but I was speaking about myself when I realized that my children need to be born again forgive the expression what business do I got being over there preaching street light outside Darkness at home and my children are losing I believe they're children of God I have to be with them I to pray with them I know everything has its place Moses that's why the things happen in the Bible Moses was ready he was ready to go take the people out of Egypt ready he was ready and the angel of the Lord appeared to kill him what he was going to do over there he hadn't done it in his home because the most important it was the circumcision and there he wanted to go to show off when he had forgot to circumcise his son how many of us are in that same situation that our children haven't been circumcised the minister is not going to do it's your responsibility like a mother and a father it's my responsibility and there came a good woman zi and all the message brother Bram when he speaks of zippa he always speaks good of her oh I wish we had a zippa zippa is a woman type of the church and sometimes the church has to stand in front of the minister and tell them what's up with you you know what I'm talking [Music] about you know what I'm talking about and why you speak brother Sergio because there's inside of my heart and if I don't speak what's in my heart I'm a [Music] hypocrite I'm speaking secondhand religion and he wants Originals right now we're in the time of the person personifications I know I went over my time is one of the few times but I can't hold this back this brother he said that before converting he used to be a gang part of a g be part of a gang and they were called the pitos and if one of them walked like that the other one also walked like that if one of them walked like this the other one also walk brother bham say the majority of the people they don't get full of the the Holy Ghost because first off they don't know where it is they get full of the spirit full of the pastor and I know what I'm talking about well because I'll say because is my brother he loves me and he knows I'll never say something to but I'm going to say do it like him let's say that the church no I'm not saying it happens that they see him how he walks how he moves the head then everybody wants to do the same they all want to be little [Music] scavis I'm not scared to say what I'm going to say because I know who I am and I know that he knows me but we're under the ministry of brother Bernie and we all want to be little Beres did you know that he hates that but now I don't want to use others but if they don't get offended Tommy but if you loved how brother Tommy Paris was another little Tommy and I know them even how they move their hand how they walk how they pretend that GI one thing is to pretend and another thing is to have [Applause] it and if you don't know what you have find your [Music] [Applause] place they all want to be if you hear brother huh Pablo Rees Franco Pablo Rees Franco not that he does it they're examples and I'm using them because I believe with all my heart that they're mure men everybody wants to be a little Paul Franco a little Paul re Franco whatever Idol you have Place him right there the idol that you have place them right there and look it look it if your idol is William Mar and brandham put him right there it's not going to have any effect because you and I we have to be like Jesus [Music] Christ the people they act like that they see how brother Bram used to do come on now CC yes yes that's cowardness that's religious that's of the devil let's respect reality God wants you how you are let us pray Lord Heavenly Father we give you thanks for this opportunity your Doctrine father we haven't even touched the surface [Music] we haven't done it Lord but what we want to do is to to to to pinch our [Music] conscience now it's not to get my brothers and sisters scared because I know that a Son of God a daughter of God neither one of the not not anyone's going to be lost and that's [Music] assured I speak not to to get the people scared but to motivate my brothers and sisters to look inside of them that Holy Ghost that's all that's you Lord and you're already inside of them bless my brothers in the name in Precious name of the Lord
