had couple of several disciples following him and they were uh they were displeased they didn't like this because the babies wanted to touch Jesus and and be around Jesus and the disciples said no no no that's that's that's not right so so Jesus says no forbid them not and this is why you read the scripture so I'm going to I'm going to get off of here and then um I'm going to just touch her don't

in the sound of my voice in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as thank you and as I greet you if you would open your scriptures your Bibles to Hebrews 30 I'm not Hebrews excuse me Proverbs chapter 31 we're going to be getting right into the message this morning as soon as we greet you and pray we're going to be reading these two verses that are on the screen now if uh you've been a good student of history of this Tabernacle you know that this uh scripture should remind you of one of our precious ministers brothers that has gone to be with the Lord Brother Paul how many of you know that remember identify this scripture brother a few of you thank you let us pray Heavenly Father we ask a special blessing this morning on the mothers that are here potential mothers those that are mothers at heart those that are there in the Sunday School Lord attending to our children the heart the heart of a mother we thank you for them for everyone that's here this morning Lord ask you to bless them Father just our Prophet say it's the greatest thing you can say to somebody God bless you so we thank you for your presence with us so far up to now like eer the L up to now the Lord has been with us we know Lord that uh the other one the other word aabad is being written Across the Nation Lord the glory of the Lord has departed but we thank you that you are with us right now help us to concentrate on the reading of the word this morning in this Sunday school lesson we ask you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ um I'd like for you to Brothers in the back if you could fix that uh changing number thing on on the there that that' be that would be nice of you okay um let's get into the scriptural reading uh proverbs 31 verse uh verse 10 first and then 28 who can find The Virtuous Woman for her price is far above rues in verse 28 says her children rise rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he Praises her this is a uh if you look on their this is what a ruby is on on your left hand side this one's already been cut in you may be seated thank on on the right hand side is uh it's a a brutish one and it's a rough it's a rough it's just R before it's been cut and Ruby varies in color from like light light red to a very dark blood darker than blood red we we are told uh by the scientists and so forth um you can go to the next one brother I can read it from here but that's okay uh the it's uh it's from the kandum family just for this is for the young people who like to research this stuff and um it's it's the second hardest mineral there is second only to the diamond okay and so that's what the in English that's what it's the word is Ruby Spanish I think it just say a precious precious stone right precious a gem a gem gem would be the same thing okay and uh so that's what and U if you could those of you that have your scriptures just go to Isaiah the you pray for me so that I can uh just stay reading like in a Sunday school lesson because if I lose it then I'll lose it what I mean not get lost if I lose control and I just go with what the Lord would have me say and preach it like I'd like to preach it I we' be here for two hours so all I'm doing is presenting to you these topics if you're not paying attention if you follow the line of thought you'll understand if you're just listening and then hearing and then just hearing and then then go back to listening you're going to compare what you were listening to what you were listening and it's not going to make any sense yet you were hearing it all the time that make sense a little bit Okay Mother's Day uh message God bless God bless every mother that's here this morning in Isaiah 4915 and 16 it says the following it says um so I will to some of you uh as I start reading right now I say God bless you shake hands out there I know that I've will lose some of you as soon as I start reading and uh that that is not a slam on any on anybody that is natural that's normal human that's normal human behavior brother bernish has said it brother Paul has said it that as soon as you start reading some people go click is that right brother Paul used to say that click um just give you a contrast to Brazil when I was in Brazil and they would get a book of brother BR they may be 50% listening as soon soon as he would say the prophet and then every 90% 95% of the people just tune in and many times here in the United States like brother Paul and brother Bernie have said I'm going to read to you yeah people turn off their listening device that's okay but that's why I say I'm not being sarcastic when I say I'm just saying goodbye to those that are so go ahead tune out I'm not you're not going to hurt my feelings the only person that hurt my feelings was last Sunday he's not here right now so I guess I can talk about him be a nice American and talk about him and that's brother Emilio perz because you know I told him outside you we have a good sense of humor we have a good report with each other and I said to him you hurt my feelings you know I was singing and you you walked out he says as soon as I got up and started walking out I knew you you know I knew that I knew you I knew you might think that and that's so that's something that um I learned from Brother green I many heard brother green say that he says if I'm preaching and you walk out I don't care like brother Brown said that just shows your ignorance brother green said but if you walk out when I'm singing then you hurt my feelings so I as long as you're sitting there you're not going to hurt my feelings if you turn off okay so let's get a reading because I'm just gonna I'm going to try to read only and if I do that the if the Lord help me do that we'll have a successful Sunday school lesson this morning I'll get off my hands I've had for about three weeks now last night I was asked are you nervous I could hardly wait till today because I want to hear what this I want to hear this also Isaiah 49:15 can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet will I not forget you behold I have Graven you upon the palms of my hands your walls are continually before me that's beautiful scripture now Psalms chapter 8 scripture my dad used to read a lot and my grandpa Garcia verses three and four says when I consider your Heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have ordained what is man that you are mindful of him and the son of man that you visit him our talk our title this morning is we are in Jehovah's hands we are in Jehovah's hands you were you were in his mind sh I'll just say like this maybe I'll summarize everything I wish I could preach but that God that created the heavens and the Earth these are products of his fingers he took you a little part from the feminine side from the masculine side and he United him together and then he started knitting him I know that's not that's not science scientific the way they said but the Bible says covered me in Psalms there 139 I think I'm not sure but it's knitting it's a mystery how God in the womb the prophet of God said why he says the natural birth is more mysterious than the Virgin birth can you imagine out of the millions and the millions and millions and the millions after millions and the millions millions finally waiting for the right one in a million or a billion or trillion to get the right combination to unite him and then place he in the womb yes and then he watch over [Music] it that's why mother is the first one that that's that senses you feels you well I think it's I think it's in the quotes I almost lost it so thank you for pray I Psalms 191 the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament shows his handiwork you want to you want young people I'm just going to be throwing out some quotes messages you might want to listen to never heard it y yall to hear it why I am a Holy Roller right here on there uh uh 1953 I think or 54 preach in Chicago talks about the creation questions and answers on Genesis talks about the creation and then compare them to these scriptures this handiwork work of his fingers God bless brother Dr ber I really appreciate his prayer this morning now let's get let's keep praying let's keep reading please and Mother's Day in 1959 brother bam says follow s may she realize that The Offspring or children from her Union with her husband has been sacred Little Gems see you're a Jem you're a Jem Stone and then from you come Little Gems got to read Ernie that God has placed under her care then God will hold her responsible is that right makes her responsible makes respons makes you resp hold you responsible respons for the rearing of those children and as the scripture says that the good woman and the mother that she is that her children will call her blessed we going to follow that word if you're still listening follow that word blessed okay morning okay while everyone thinks about their mother say you know I think mother the true mother is the fifth go Gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John mother mother gets them first that's the one who brings them up F first his mother that's why I said I appreciate brother Dr verdusco he he mentioned that in his prayer if you rem that say Amen him saying that about the Fifth Gospel so and then the next thing is uh to you little mothers here this morning notice the date brother Johnny brought this to my attention I noticed it and then he brought it to my attention and I knew it was Mother's Day and I thought and then he brought it to my attention and I said that's right it was Mother's Day look at the look at the message Mother's Day message brother B preached in 1954 years ago the invasion of the United States to you little mothers this morning that's been real mothers and I know there's many of you I think every one of you let me tell you something God bless you you're the fifth gospel I think remember when Moses was a little boy it was the mother who gave him his instruction we know written of four gospels four gospels that are written Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's mother she gets them before Matthew Mark looking John teaching gets them so you know mama has got them at home till they're 5 years old right or in here in in Sunday school then they go to Sunday school and then of course they go to the other school too that's run by Jezebel but we're not here to talk about Jezebel religion that's another mother talking about real mothers okay so the responsibility is placed upon you mothers and you fathers to raise these children to for the kingdom of God and I'm sure that's your heart's desire now the first step you've probably ever taken in your life how many have made a step see in English we say take and in Spanish we say give take a step yeah that's just a little how many of you how many of you are interpretator here raise your hand there's one back there thank you brother you're all interpreters interpret amen God is his own interpreter but you interpret the word by the life that you live because your works is your faith expressed and what you believe is what you do so you interpret with your life what you understand the word to say but I'm talking about verbal interpretation how many how many oral interpretation we have here how many everybody up here come on if if you've been up here to interpret raise your hand you've been up here to interpret thank you brother we got a few more so that's just a little tidbit there give and take about taking a step giv a step I have I say that to relax because I'm I see myself getting into it a little bit and and now the first step you ever taken in your life speaking of leadership is probably the hands of some kind old mother them hands may be still tonight out there in some Cemetery still motionless they they may be still tonight out there in some Cemetery my mom's not here out there's but that was the hand that H you to make your first step and you're thinking to give his first step thank you all right now let's go to John chapter 10 hope you're writing these scriptures down it's it's a scripture that many ministers call the the the good she the Good Shepherd chapter he he Jesus does say that I I'm the Good Shepherd my sheep hear my voice and they follow me he says that first we're going to be reading two verses from that chapter read that entire chapter it'll bless your heart your heart heart already has blood in it but it's going to bless your heart you got to understand that what I said there a little bit later on and his the sheep that he's talking about and I give unto them eternal life and I and and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand that beautiful my verse 29 My Father which gave them me wow he's not an Indian giver he doesn't give and then take away you know gives Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand which hand is oh what hand is it he's talking about his hand or his hand or the father's hand then he says the next verse he say the father and I are one to clarify things okay let's go oh it's getting good now starts warming up already I cannot read this scripture in Portuguese without crying glad I'm going to read it I'm glad I'm going to read it in English put handkerchief here just I going go back to it later and verse 22 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak to Aaron and to his son saying on this wise you shall bless the children of Israel saying to them would you read that with me please if I please read this with me the Lord bless you and keep you the Lord bless you and keep you just let's do a Coral reading at the same time so there be no delay the Lord bless you and keep you the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace and they shall put my name is that awesome and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them in Spanish please I have in Spanish so let's sequential there Let's do let's him okay that is a promise W let's go to where I believe I believe you don't have to believe what I believe but this is where I believe that God the Lord Jesus Christ we are in Jehovah's hands is that true yes or no Jehovah of the Old Testament is a Jesus of the new amen amen got to calm down God is not ining give you how does he how did he tell Moses to bless the people he told God told Moses tell Aaron and his children the priesthood the ministers this is how I want you to bless my people and then that's they that's he said how they supposed to do it let's look how beautiful this is just before the Lord Jesus Christ is caught up to The Mercy Seat can't I just have to read he and he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands just imagine for a moment that the Lord Jesus Christ is standing next to me right now and he's lifting up his hands like this what is what are you seeing what he showing you he's showing you first of all him yourself you because you're engraved in his myself to wake myself up I gotta get reading he lifted up his hands bless them I can picture him the Lord Jesus Christ blessing them and he's saying the Lord bless you and keep you you understand what I'm saying because he told the ministry bless them this way I like saying it like this this way the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to [Applause] you amen and he's looking at them that's right his face was shining upon them in other words already and he saying the Lord his face sh upon you and he's doing it I'll be quiet and it came to pass while he blessed them departed from them and carried up into heaven Lord have mercy help me Lord our thought of this morning is and I want him to say it exactly in English but he can interpret it I want to say in English first and I want you to repeat after me one of our thoughts this morning is God bless you God bless you praise God can you all say God bless you God bless you thank you graas thank you very much if you've never if you've been here for years and youve never you don't like speaking English that's okay I forgive you but I would like love for you to at least learn how to say these three words and say them in English especially after you understand what they mean God bless you let's find out what that means brother BR says the following so many things I could say but I say God bless you all I think that's the greatest word can be if God will bless me that's all I want is that right if God will bless me that's enough that's all I care for what's the greatest word that one man could say to another God Bless you that's it if God will bless me that's the best thing I can have that's all I want God to bless me the rest of it it's all right so God bless you is the best thing that I can say and I'm sure if he will do that we'll all meet again someday see somebody told me one time maybe that's a tertiary or four or five levels down of understanding of what he said here because I've looked for it I haven't found it yet but I was told that brother bam said that God bless God bless you man I'll see you in the resurrection maybe he said that to somebody not tape but I can see that it's that context I'll see you in the resurrection right there because if God God if God blesses you God truly if God truly blesses you we'll get to that what does it really mean bless if God really blesses you you'll be in the resurrection I'll be in the resurrection If He blesses me and then we'll see each other so let's continue with our Sunday school lesson thank you he's talking to the to the church thank you for your kindness for the offerings and for all you've done and I don't know how to say any more than God bless you and to me that's the greatest word there is God will bless me everything else will be all right as long as God blesses me says wife and I and the children want to tell thanks so much it's so little but I'll say this this is the greatest word that I think anyone could say there nothing could be any greater so brother randam in summary and and said the following God bless you say God bless you God bless you thank you it's the greatest word the greatest word there is the best thing that I can say this is the greatest word I think anyone could say God bless you God bless you God bless you WHat does bless mean bless that that is that a good question I mean the kids are saying right you gonna go I'm GNA go would you tell the rest of the people what it means brother how many know what I means it out all right all right see somebody comes up with a word a word all every word has an orig or origin we're g to find out where bless comes from how many now say Bye by you're just saying be ye the letter b and y e or U or not but but it used to be God and good were written the same in English so they would write good good good good g o d good good b b e e b with Ye Ye how many of you wonder why by is written with a Y sometimes and sometimes a y e and it's then as we naturally humans get a little lazy people start writing in the letters b apostrophe apostrophe apost AP uh w w aphe good good finally they just started writing good we got lazy and then they started pronouncing it differently goodbye goodbye that's where we get go goodbye goodbye and that's something else that's how boring my classes were if you heard a thumb back there somebody bump in their head then I would ask him I said how many of you kids think that that sounds so religious right some are religious right sounds so religious right yes or yes I said but we have an equivalent in English except we don't know that so I would teach him English too and I take that long boring lecture that you just heard right now but every word every I was going to say stinking word yeah it is because it comes from Babylon right confusion language it's not a Heavenly it's not a Heavenly language we speak this is this is Babylon confusion of languages yes or yes but bless bless starts off somewhere and that's what I think we should we want to look at it God bless you what does what does bless WHat does bless mean bless well it comes from because English is a Germanic language and it's the old English bless blessed blesson blon it means to consecrate make holy give thanks but originally from the early Germanic the the Primitive one the earlier one that word blood bless are you starting to see blood in there now and and it mean it meant to to mark with blood from its root blood thumb blood originally a blood sprinkling on Pagan altars but where did they get it from I'm not going to ask you for an amen just raise your hand how many have heard our pastor referring to brother bram's message or in the message of brother Bram where brother brandham says that Abel died on the same altar that he sacrificed his lamb a few of you thank you that's what he said so it all goes back to Genesis is that beautiful that beautiful the way our Bible starts off the beginning the Genesis the gene that's the first one and then it ends with the unveiling the Revelation I love this book love the Bible is it awesome and that transition between the New Testament and the Old Testament he kind of yells at you and he says behold will send you the prophet there the very middle right there when heop beautiful book read it I suggested I know you do I Christians read the Bible and pray every day so bless bless or God bless you oh God bless you you're really saying to somebody may God consecrate you wow amen we could just see if a few songs go home God bless you may God make you holy may God Hollow you with blood may God Mark you with blood yes I know it's not the blood anymore BL chemistry of the blood anymore that was in the blood but we're talking about the word bless bless and all that goes along that goes along with it the life that was in the blood so let's say like that may God put the life that was in the blood in you that's what you're saying when you're saying godess bless you I think anyway I think that's what it means so you can study young people study what the word best means that's awesome Jus as Bethy and then when he did he lifted up his hands and he blessed them wow and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and I think it's a great coronation of the Full Gospel is the resurrection I'm not bragging but I really never paid attention to Mother's Day to the message of brother BR preached I've heard maybe eight or 12 times I recommend it to young people I was shocked con Mother's Day that's got to be wrong anyway with the resurrection anyway the great coronation of the full of the Full Gospel is the resurrection and it Divine promises and the consolation that it gives those who are trusting in it for it promises the great Union of our uniting together again why sure it's the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no matter what he did he did not raise again from the dead all it was in vain to me it to me proves that he was God proves every claim he made the resurrection and it's also the place of the resting of the Soul it's the starting point it's the crowning of our consolation wow and the next uh the same one okay I think I may have put two slides in I apologize for that but in the likeness here's the same message in the likeness and beauty of the Resurrection he's talking about the the the mother's your mother raises from the dead they'll stand in the likeness of Christ their celestial bodies beautiful forever sir that's the rest read everybody read this with me in English please if you can that's everybody that's the mother's day that I'm waiting for that's the mother's day that I'm waiting for coronation not the Carnation on the laal some of you may have a carnation wear a carnation today my mistake honey I sorry apologize not the coronation of the Lael but the coronation of the Soul God has changed her wow I don't have time for this but I'm going to say it anyway they a fellow asked brother Bram and if he tells if he would have told me what he told Brother Bram I would then go away go sit down somewhere erase yourself how you heard that expression have heard that yourself I what I would have said to them but brother BR did say that I tell you what he said and you know when he would I would have said it something else brother Bram in the resurrection will I recognize my mother yes you you'll recognize uh your mother and you'll recognize every mother oh brother Ram that's ridiculous wow brother said no no no no uh Peter James and John ped San and Transfiguration they had never seen Moses and Elijah but when they saw them they recognized him wow said under that under that inspiration they recognize him so I'll be able to say in that day Paul Pao Enoch the real [Laughter] ones the first judge C the first judge right no wasn't he or second first Moes Moses you got it you see where I'm going but if anybody out I'm sorry I can't think of anyone else but you know what I'm saying he no no you recognize you you'll recognize everybody I mean what discerns Hebrews 412 for the word of God is a discerner of the heart just like brother said well you're you're Mrs Stones Mrs Jones and you live such such it was the word yes or yes so when you become the word have to tell you that's Paul this is awesome Daniel anybody any Daniels here one of my favorite prophets they're all favorite that's mother day I'm waiting for yeah they may forget remember that's in Isaiah 49 they they they may forget but I will not forget thee behold I have Graven thee on the palms of my hands how did that happen let's read a mother brother man say this in the message love says a mother may forget her string child but never can I forget you your names are engraved on the palms of my hands that was Jehovah saying that in the Old Testament I can't talk too much already your hand your names are engraved on the PS of my hand sure by a Roman Spike God so loved the world that he gave his son it is written something like this could a mother forget her suckling babe I can never forget youed on the palms of my hands the nails that engraved our names how did that how did that happen show me scientifically how that happen I I don't got to all I don't have to I just said repeat what he says what say say the nails that engraved our names we know that you remember us Lord It Was Written in the Bible rather can a mother forget her suckling baby she might say she might do that but I can't forget you your names are engraved on the palms of my hands they are nail prince in His Hands by nail prince in his hands we are in Jehovah's hands his whole creation when he blew Stars moons planets World his hands not incredible he descended down from a Elohim self exist by himself he [Applause] was down to take on the Father the role of father to the son then that logos became called the Son of God or Jehovah God that appeared to Moses fire Paul as a pillar of fire that later Came Upon inside Mary in the form of the body then on the day when he was baptized he came out of the water Pillar of Fire down inside him and he said I and the father are one nobody can take you out of my hand take you out of my hands nobody can take you out of a father's hands and then he says you know you're the word you become the word how do you become the word perfect Faith young children in the beginning of the message perfect faith the prophet of God tells us he said he says you become the word become the word you receive the word yes you can have the Holy Ghost yes I want the Holy Ghost but not just in my flesh because it is a promise I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh everybody here everybody here has received the Holy Ghost one form or one time or another you have sensed him I know you have some of you have even sensed him in the spirit in your imagination your imagin memory your you have felt him he anointed you in them then some of us some of us here I received the baptism of of the that's what we want for that to become real to us we are in God we are in Jehovah God can't even look at his hands without seeing you so when you say God bless you God bless you that's what you're really saying so that's the greatest thing that you can say to somebody God bless you God bless you that's what our Prophet told us that's why it had to be in a special language amen yes it's corrupted but he that's what that's the language God chose to use for Elijah even there sunset Mountain Sao Canyon
