chains father father every evil [Music] thought Lord if there's any barriers here this morning tear them down break the chains Lord I'm here just to help your people Lord we ask you these things father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's open our scriptures to Ephesians chapter 4 can you say Amen this morning it is isn't it good to be a Christian this morning and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measures of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen let's turn to John chapter 15 I love this verse ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you should ask of the father in my name he may give it to you may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated thank the musicians if I can give a small title to this little small sermon I want to name it God's choosing subtitled this Discerning the Lord's body and this morning I would like to pay homage and respect and I want to dedicate this small little talk to my pastor my dad Papa my pastor and my friend amig amen as you all know today is his birthday he's 81 years old could we give him a clap offer amen Bernie G Garcia gcia pastor and Apostle of God by the grace of God called not by man but by God born in Sita New Mexico on October the 26th 1933 two days after he was born this would be the cover of the Saturday evening's post if they're able to show that that'd be great it's an eagle that getting ready to land there say October the 28th 1933 brother Bram said that the the next message that would come forth would be the dove leading the eagle he says that on the wings of a dove preached in 1965 we know that the dove is the Holy Spirit Pastor Garcia a holy ghost filled man a man that was called to the desert of Phoenix Arizona Phoenix also known as the Valley of the Sun Su and the Valley of the s o n brother Bernie a man that was ordained by brother Bram yes I I say ordained it has to be a spiritual Revelation when he was in maridan Mississippi Mississippi he would interpret for his daddy Pablo Garcia brother Bram where the same seventh angel messenger the prophet of malakiah 45 the prophet of Revelation 10 would look into my daddy's eyes and say son he didn't say my brother friend he said Son you have to understand adoption son you started because you were called to the ministry yes part of the fivefold ministry and we know that the word come to the prophet as the scripture says Amos 37 surely the Lord God reveal will do nothing but he reveal his Secrets until his servants the prophets I hope you caught that this morning I need you put on your spiritual caps this morning yes our pastor was one of many secrets that would be revealed to brother Bram you are called to the ministry and there he was being ordained by the prophet of God you know the word ordained it's a verb it means to enact or establish by law to Destin or predestined predestine is to Destin in advance forain Destin means to predetermine to ordain brother Bron prophesied when he said you stutter because you called to the ministry see being a prophet he had the ability to go in the past and the future you have to notice that brother Bernie G Garcia was not before the seventh Angel's Messengers commission he was not called after the seventh Angel's Messengers Commission Hallelujah but he was called during the commission of the seventh angel message his life intercepted the Apostle of God with the prophet of God it was the time of going in the time of inheritance the time of the adoption the time of the open door that's when his life intersected with the prophet of this age and he was also given a commission oh it makes me think how when the son of man Jesus Christ the word came into Peter and told him Peter what you bind on Earth I will bind in heaven what you lose on Earth I will lose in heaven Jesus Christ the prophet of prophets the son of man gave the keys to Peter and he had the authority he said Peter you got the keys on your side and what you bind on Earth I will bind in heaven what you lose on Earth I will lose in heaven they told Peter what was what must we do to be saved pet said repent and be baptized remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what he was saying is deny yourself and pick up the cross and I believe Joseph Garcia that in married in Mississippi Missippi a son of man which refers to a prophet or if I could say one like to the son of man gave the mighty Apostle the keys and put it on his side and said you're to help the Mexican people bring them a message and that's what he did he brought him a message beak to Beak he fed them amen you know it's no wonder that our pastor did not hesitate to heed his call to help the Latin Nation Peru Brazil bra Chile Chile colia Guatemala Guatemala salvad Ecuador Puerto Rico Puerto Rico United States of America sir and let's not forget the Beloved Mexico the very same man who by faith went into Mexico and South America with $20 in his pocket let me see you do that today but he went nevertheless even when some of the congregation said if you go to Mexico we will stop paying TI but that did not stop him for he could not he could not bear to have to stand in front of the white Throne judgment only to hear God tell him why did you not hearken to my prophet's voice why did you not obey my Prophet but instead he will he hear the sweet voice of Jesus enter in my true and faithful servant that has obeyed the voice of my Prophet that thou has done wow enter into the joys of the Lord do you believe that this morning but look at him now and today the scripture is once again fulfilled there is no Beauty we should desire to look upon him he's a little frail stooped over cons side but yet he's he's saying Lord have mercy on my children have mercy on my [Applause] people he still intercessors for us today my daddy Who Loved all his children the daddy who told his congregation if you love me love my children if you love me love my children I want to speak of one of the memories of my father I was probably maybe 10 years old 11 years old sister the Sharon Johnson came to our house Johnson she came to pick me up I was friends with Micah and Matthew Johnson Matthew Mel John Mel Johnson and when she came to pick us up she brought her daughter Joy because she had laryngitis and she had she wasn't speaking for a couple days so Joy was telling my dad out in the parking lot my mom would like for you to pray for her brother Bernie and it was just a simple prayer I I wanted to go have fun and jump in trampoline so my dad said a little prayer it lasted probably about 30 seconds this was the first miracle I've ever seen she did not take more than three steps when she turned around and told and told joy joy and an audible voice go tell brother Bernie that the Lord has heard his prayer isn't it awesome when the Lord hears your prayer right there I knew that God was real I knew he was real because the life that I saw my father Liv I thought everyone lived the same life I can say today that I'm so glad that brother Bernie he his his commission his and he was obedient to the voice of the Prophet why do you say that Brother Joseph because he's your dad no because that would be the apostle that would lead me to the feet of Jesus Christ I can never forget one last thing I want to say before I one time in our house brother Bernie he was walking to his room I was walking to my room and he turned and and told me son don't you ever forget that you are predestinated into eternal life I did not understand it then and one time at the table he told me he said Joseph our Prophet I'm glad he said our prophet and not my Prophet you see he included me in that and I include you this morning he said our Prophet was sent a Joseph and I also have been sent a Joseph that might not tickle your f this morning but that's what he said and I believe it I want to say happy birthday to my daddy I love you with all my heart brother Bernie an apostle of man not of man neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead what an example he's left us this morning if we can just love each other amen God bless you this morning okay for amen thank you brother that's a cool man under pressure amen I believe uh we've heard some tremendous words from my brother words that we can take to our heart I don't think any of us could have done a better job than that you know we could almost have a prayer line right now and miracles would take place I was thinking as my brother Joseph was talking about how he uh the things that he saw with my dad with sister Johnson took me back to a Time in Mexico City I must have been 15 years old tight this up a little more son and uh we were at a at a ministers meeting and there at that meeting uh they they my dad spoke and uh people started to to go to the Altar and I was sitting there he had allowed me to go to the meeting and it was getting hot and heavy and I was praying and I thought I heard my name and I looked up and my dad was staring right at me and he he went like this and and I looked over and everything seemed normal to me and he went like that again and I I said what he he said put your hands on that man so I looked over and brother Jose Hernandez was there brother Enoch his son is right here I looked at my father and had my hand up and I put my hand on brother Jose when I did that a light shot out from my dad came through my hand went through the brother Jose and he received the a holy ghost baptism at that instant amen I remember thinking I I thought my dad was a minister but what kind of man is this when you think of the ministry of brother Garcia it's singular maybe some people might think they know a better Minister other Maybe follow a lesser Minister be that as it may but there's nobody like him amen God broke the mold when after he made him when I first started traveling with my father you may have heard this story before but telling on his birthday he sat me down in and he said son said I'm supposed to go to a wedding in Mexico City but I can't go so I'm going to send you in my stad he said when you go an hour at the wedding one of the pastors is going to approach you and he's going to ask you to speak at this church you tell him yes he said and Sunday morning when you speak he said just speak anything that the Lord puts on your heart for about 20 minutes and then turn the service over then you're just going to stand there somebody is going to come to the Altar for you to pray for them when you start to pray for that person everybody's going to want to be prayed for you just begin to pray for them said and I will be there with you and my ministry will come over you you just need to surrender now I thought those are nice words and I went to Mexico City and I was sitting there at the wedding watching The Wedding take place and brother Monto came up to me and he said brother Garcia if you're not scheduled anywhere I would like for you to speak at my church I said yes sir I'll speak at your church that night I I thought to myself what am I I have no interpreter I'm going to have to speak in Spanish Lord uh would you please give me the inspiration right now so that I can uh write it down and translated to Spanish and the Holy Spirit came into the room gave me the message to speak how many of you remember when Jesus sat his disciples down and he gave them instructions and he sent them out into the missionary Feld that was the message that the lord gave me and he told me when your father sat you down and instructed you what to do that was the same thing that Jesus did see we make it really complicated it's not complicated God is very simple I understood that he had gave me the instructions to do on that missionary now when I got to the service I looked over my notes and they had Brother Juan Pon was speaking and I was going to be the second speaker when I looked over my notes I thought I I can't speak about this people will think I'm speaking about myself I don't think it goes right and I began to search uh for another scripture that it doesn't take a lot usually I only need 15 or 20 seconds to find something else to speak on I know I know it's not what I have prepared but I know it's whatever the Lord wants to speak so as I began to search for a scripture brother John who had been speaking about companionship and brotherly love he said to to close before I turn it over to brother Bernie we're going to read one last scripture he said and he read the scriptures how can we see the works of the father he says believe on him whom the father has sent I I closed my Bible I knew that the Lord had given me the right uh message for that day and I preached on being instructed as you go I preached about 20 minutes and I and I went towards the back and I just stood there the brother began to sing a song and I I opened my eyes and there was a lady standing to be prayed for I went as I remembered the words of my father I went to pray for that lady when I finished praying for the lady I looked up and just as my father had told me a week earlier there was a line of people to be prayed for they went out the door and I began to pray on the third person that I was praying for she said brother Bernie I want you to pray for me there's an evil spirit that is attacking me I try to pray and a and a scary face approaches me but it looks real I can see it when she spoke something came down and I sense the presence of my father and I began to hear myself speak but it wasn't me speaking and I heard him say that's not the truth what happens is when you begin to pray a white light approaches you that's Jesus Christ wants to have fellowship with you but because you do not know what that light is you begin to become afraid the minute that fear enters in the light goes away and the face appears and she begin to cry she said that's exactly the truth she was delivered that day and it went like that person after person I knew that it was not my Ministry I had never operated in that type of a way before and after service I asked myself again what manner of man is this the scripture when Jesus tells his disciples so soon the world will see me no more but you shall see me probably with you even in you till the end of the world that those words mean different to me now I think if a man of Flesh and Blood my own flesh and blood my own daddy if he could send his ministry upon me how much more our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I remember I shared that testimony with my aunt Nati and she was uh she was visiting me in California and I was recording some of her testimonies and she began to clap her hands and she began to praise God and then she began to speak in that voice and she said Bernie said that will never leave you God doesn't give and take away that will be with you always and I've seen throughout the the years that my aunt naew was right you know our our pastor loves the people he give his life in his heart for you he's had some rough patches but we're here to tell you today that he's well he's good he's healthy as much as a 81y old man could be he's a strong is as strong as can be now everybody gets tired but when he's rested I would have no other one be but him somebody said the other day he's he's incapacitated and I I heard my brother say the same thing I I tell him I said yeah he might only be 10 or 15% of what he was maybe but if that 10 and 15% he's still three times the man I am and I'd rather have that 10% than anybody else is 100% on that note we had a meeting with him the other day and he expressed that he was ready and and and wanting willing to resume the roles as president of the voice of restoration and so we've we've uh made those changes he will be resuming the office of President of voice of restoration I think that deserves an Applause amen amen along with brother Garcia being the president he's asked me to stay on as co-president and brother James Garcia as vice president jcia now we we've asked for the James and he has accepted and uh my dad asked us to read a statement from him there's a white box in the office and we thought it would be uh good to read the statement but uh then we after thinking of it we thought it would be good to have brother Jimmy in his own words to to do so I'm looking for a white speaker it's a bluetoo speaker son how many you love the Lord connected I remember the first time uh just I don't know why it came to my mind the first first time that I remember my dad giving me a whooping now according to my sisters they were far and rare in between that's right and I kind of have to admit that is true because I do remember Billy and Jo getting a lot more weapons but I'll tell you the weapons that my dad didn't give me my sister Debbie made up for him and the scares that my sister Joanna gave me were worse than any weapons I ever got who has your brother stand in the street with a suitcase telling you that the police are going to pick you up because you've been a bad boy on Roosevelt right next to the county [Laughter] hospital where the ambulance are going by every five minutes we were at crossing the border in Mexico and I he taught us to be still be careful I was running around I almost got hit by a car I wish to God that car would have hit me CU then he would have been concerned for me instead he was concerned but he took it out on a hooping and I realized then how much he must love me to give me a such a whooping just because he was afraid I was going to get hurt amen amen okay Jo the voice of restoration as its vice president it is without reservation that I immediately felt a confirming glow of the Holy Spirit and I knew that I have been prepared for such a time as this it is a particular honor to be named the vice president of the voice of restoration the name itself is an name so lofty exceptionally humbly to be even be considered part of its past and even more daunting to be recruited to affect its future and legacy's defines the voice as a sound or sounds uttered through the mouth of living creatures especially human beings in speaking shouting and singing the pioneer of the voice of restoration brother B weer Etc tool that we call the voice of restoration taught me at the impressionable age of 17 that there was only one voice in our day fallible expression of God's thoughts and that voice which expressed that word of God was masked behind a Kentucky hillbilly accent and an ungrammatical profundity that would restore not only homes marriages and hearts but entire families if they in their own language brother Garcia's fundamental belief and his god-given calling was the Genesis of what became known as the ministry of the voice of restoration most have been called to be part of this ministry had no choice for had we adhered to our own Wills we would have chosen The Wider path of ease [Music] not for who have been settled upon by the holy spirit with the gift of a burden it is my sincere desire to carry the torch of this message upon the shoulders of those giants of heart who have gone before us and shoulder to shoulder with those who by predominate counsel have likewise been thrust into to the host who fight fervently to take this message with fear and trembling fear and trembling not born of cowardice but of a humbling veneration of the Creator who thought so much of his bride that he would dresser with such a perfect message garment for every word I'm excited to join the young but God fill team at burn it brother burning is put together in place to carry the voice of restoration into the the future Bernie Jr Billy and Joseph have proven throughout the years that they are willing to put their personal lives on hold to do whatever it takes to bless the people I can see their father's love and passion for the gospel work has been instilled in each one of them on that note I am reminded of that transformative period of time that will ever be anchored in my heart in the deepest chambers of my heart the great love for this message and the ministry I call it my schooling at the feet of the apostle G Bernie J Billy Joseph my most cherished blessings to have traveled as a young man into Mexico and Canada with brother Bernie little did I know then that those selfless acts act I saw in him and the loving and sometimes Stern advice and particularly his instruction which were in all actuality on the the job training brother Garcia's training helped form my Ministry and uniquely PR prepared me for going forward this is why I believe and know his heart and vision for the future of Lis restoration it is a distinguished honor to have been his disciple and your brother friend and coworker throughout these years just can to all those who stand year after year waiting and groaning for our release thank you for your faith sacrifice the frail tree of words cannot possibly describe the incredible crown of your reward I join my heart with you and can reiterate the prayer of God's word prophet of the age and plead that it can truly be my own and I've tried with all of my heart Lord to live for you to do the thing no matter what the cross is or how scornful it seems to be I love you dear Jesus you've broken my heart over and over but I love you you for it and I pray God that you will keep me to fulfill the commission that you have given and that you might finish and that I might finish my course with joy and someday when life's ended and the Treads that I'm walking on now the Someday My Soul has got to turn back Yonder Stand By Me Oh Morning Star at this time I could not turn this new Corner in my life fr Al William Mary and BR work responsibility without acknowledging the Friendship guidance and patience of brother Paul G Garcia Jr toward me and who without his mentorship and life I would never have been privy to the intimate moments of a man in love first with God's word and then with God's people without his help many years ago I would not have learned the importance of God's order of things and that having a tough skin in the midst of the prey was a victory the voice of restoration would not humbly command the respect that it does had it not been for the leadership that has carried the gospel torch thus far and without the thousands of Prayer Warriors and pastors and dedicated volunteers who spread the Glorious gospel of the end time message from the American southwest to the furthest reaches of indigenous Peru my special thanks for this opportunity to serve thank you Rosalie for you are my rock and the love of my life and without your strength I do not think I would be even be alive today much less have the Vigor and courage this important stage of my Ministry in closing I am compelled to invite each and every one of you to take up your cross whatever G gift the Lord has placed in your hand and journey with us to the uttermost parts of the earth and join and share the voice of restoration whosoever will for IND for Jes J on behalf of of my brothers Joseph and Billy my father and the board of directors of voice restoration we welcome brother Bernie G Garcia back as the president of the voice and brother James Garcia jimy gcia as the vice president God bless [Applause] you I forgot my suitcase with all my quotes so I'm just kidding I'm sorry um God bless you it's been a while um the Lord is good I I love my brothers as I told you know we have 50 minutes to an hour I told him don't leave me more than five minutes that's about all I get um as you know I'm I'm very different you know we're all different but I'm my daughter tells me I'm exactly and she says I'm special I'm weird but um I can say without a doubt that according to what my brother Bernie said Bernie that my father loves me more than all the children because I'm the one that got the caresses of love more than any one of them and my sister joined in that c times because she was the one in reality that kind of raised us you know so sometimes uh um when I was in my worst you know when I was very bitter uh my sister uh got a hold of me and she grabbed me like that looked me in the eye and told me you must remember that your father does not know how to be a father and she began to talk to me and that is one of the moments that has helped me yes I haven't given my testimony here I know many maybe have heard it but um my father is is is a very different man we've seen many things we've seen the results of his ministry we've heard many testimonies of all the Miracles and of all the things that God has done through his ministry because it wasn't him that's something that that we must remember wasn't brother Bernie but it was God through the man it was God doing the work and it comes it comes in every person's life when God uses you but then when you come to the realization when God has finished using you to do what he has called you to do that is when you find out who are your friends who is your family because when everything has left you then you find out who is standing around about you then you can say I truly have known the Lord and those that are around me I can feel God's love around me because when it's all said and done there's only one thing that will allow us to enter in and that is perfect love without that perfect love we will never ever be able to make it now people do not understand what that is I I've come to realize that and as I began to to study the message now now brother Ernie Bera he's he's he's it's his fault I'm G tell you right now it's his fault because he he pricked my mind he pricked me to begin to study more as he began to teach the message birth pains now I don't know how many has gone and study brother ER thank you very much but I began to to read that message and in that message as brother Bernie as brother Ernie said repeated what brother brandham said he said that there is he go You Must Die the old must die so that a new birth can come in the old must die so that the new can come in and as you begin to read further on brother Brandon begins to tell you about law and Grace and he tells you that both cannot exist at the same time and when you real realiz that that there is a law and there is a Grace one of those things one of those laws is governing you right now is either law or it's Grace as I was sitting there in Mexico City in this last services the Lord came down and told me pay attention listen to what's being preached he says they're preaching and talking about love he goes but what they're really giving is love is l w the prophet tells us he said he is to us as ministers it doesn't matter if my brother has committed adultery if he has murdered someone or if he has lied or if he has done drugs put whatever it is that you want or if she is a prostitute he said that's not my business he says I am not a reformer I'm here to give Grace he says we have law to take care of that he goes but we give Grace We're called to give life to give grace to the people that is our ministry not to judge not to condemn but to say that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that same Grace is for you it's for me no matter what I have done no matter where I have been the grace of God is still here present Hallelujah that's right but when we preach and we say we know that there's children of the evil one that's his law because when I read the scripture and I hear Brother Bram speak brother bam said that the blood of Jesus covers the whole world it covers the whole world so there is no law at this time but there will be a day when that blood will be taken away but right now the blood is still there and we find out that we need the life that's inside the blood inside of us now one time I'm sorry I don't like to preach I'm honest with you I don't like to preach but I got no notes here when the Lord comes down you don't need no not I I walked in my the house of my parents and my dad was sitting down it was just my mom and dad he was sitting on his chair and he was crying and I got close to him I felt the presence of the Angel of the Lord I knew that he would had been there and I I asked Dad I said what's wrong you know as a son you know I was preoccupied with him I was worried and he he he's crying and he tells me he says the people people think that God doesn't talk to me anymore if they would only know they think that there's no more great Mysteries because but if they would just only knew how much the Lord talks to me every day I knew that was true I knew that was true CU I knew that the presence of the Angel of the Lord was there you cannot do nothing but be reverent you know I I walked in at another time to kind of change the the atmosphere that um I uh told I walked in and my mom and dad were there my dad was laughing I mean he was really laughing almost out of control and my mom was walking towards the kitchen and was telling me your dad is crazy and she throws her Castillo eyes you know you know how you roll them you know how the castillos you know they they just roll their eyes right the way the castill know how to do it that way my mom was doing that while she was saying your dad is crazy he needs help I go I just walked in you see I'm on my way to work but I just stopped by and say hi then I go I go I go what what's going on here he goes I don't know because your dad is crazy I said well explain to me what happened he he said he was sitting down there and he called me over because he wanted to talk to me and he began to preach to me and as he began to preach to me I started looking around and I saw it was just him and me and he begins to preach I mean he's preaching you know how my dad preaches right and during mid service of his preaching to my mom he says let's give the Lord a clap offering and my dad begins to clap he begins to clap my mom begins to clap then she realized they're by themselves and she says this man is crazy and she walked off that was the scene that I interrupted I thought that was awesome I mean we might think he's over or yeah he he's finished you know he he he doesn't have very much patience I'll tell you he doesn't have very much patience he doesn't have patience for the T for the dumb things yeah he doesn't have patience for for the little trivial things he do have patience for that but if you want to sit to him and talk about the word oh he'll talk to you he'll talk your ear out he that's just the way he is that's his life so those are some of the things that we we have experienced there's a lot dad I love you we've gone gone through a lot of things together we've gone through hell my relationship with him has gone through hell the Lord knows he knows I remember after losing respect to him and as things got worse life I told him some things that that basically as a son when he when he he told me one time I won't say everything I said but he told me why don't you respect me as your father I turned to him and I said when have you ever been my father you're my bi biological father but when have you been my father and I said some other things and you know not very many people would say that to my dad God made me a certain way and when God brought me back to church many of you saw me how I was I colored my hair blonde hair I did a lot of things but we won't get into that I I remember one time that after I came back I was his chauffer for about a year year and a half I turned to him I said dad do you remember that I didn't get to finish my my phrase he knew what I was talking he said yes I said forgive me I was wrong you're right it seems a lot of times in my life I've had to apologize that I was wrong you were right you know if I have offended anyone I'm sorry that's hasn't been my intention whether it was willingly or unwillingly because we're called to give a message of Grace to give a message of love as brother bam says this is there will be a Ministry in this end time but it'll say only what The Headstone say and they say grace yes gra Grace gra Grace gra that's why we want for each and every one of you that's what we want for Our Lives May the Lord richly bless you we love you and may He recompense your love to our pastor God bless you amen good morning I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it is an honor to be here in the house of the Lord this morning I want to I want to thank Bernie Billy and Joseph Bernie bil for their comments uh I I truly believe that what they say they said brother Bernie if you love brother Bernie you have to love his children how many you love his children I raise my hand too I can identify myself with that so uh without further delay it's almost time to dismiss you know like Billy says he's uh a little strange I think I am too a little strange and I I wanted to just comment of just a few little things here before we I have a recording here it it was this recording I I took it I took the liberty on myself that I went and it was it was in church and I took this thing to to church with me and I'll tell you exactly the date that it was uh March 26 1982 I'm not going to play it but anybody wants to hear it I'll let you hear it and during that service uh a prophecy came forth and a prophecy is it says something like this is not word by word now it says I'm going to have to go to some in Spanish because it came in Spanish is keep going keep on I'm going to continue blessing my servant gcia ber Garcia and then it repeats it again and then he says to him that goes against my servant I referring to God I will turn against him I'm going to say it again they says keep on keep on going he that goes against my servant Bern Garcia he said whoever turns against Bern I shall turn against him well you can say well it's it's only a prophecy God Vindicated in many ways his ministry Vindicated the people could see the love that brother Bernie has his life his testimony the many many prophecies that would say this is my beloved Apostle so then for for many different Avenues he was Vindicated what brother Bram told him son called him son we believe without a doubt that he's a servant of God and he is an apostle amen he still is and you want me to tell you something something you're going to think that I'm crazy on the other side of the curtain he's still going to be an apostle that's what I believe now notice I'm going to explain to you just a little bit how brother Bernie is somebody already spilled the beans please forgive me my wife I tell my wife it's been years years and years ago I said it's going to be our anniversary you don't want me to make an announcement in church my wife said for what what the people they have to know that we there's no need for it my my wife is a very strange she strange but wasn't it good that the people know that we're going to be married for 40 years there's no need for it what for so I didn't put that that we're 40 years anniversary maybe one of our one of our children did you know that we don't have control over our children oh see or do we do you have control upon over the thoughts of your son or daughter no sir my mom and dad they would control my body but they couldn't control what I was thinking it couldn't control my mind you understood me right I I found out that we've been married for 40 years with my precious lady my wife Lupita alv no no no I don't want to be rude I didn't do that for that purpose for me I would like for you to hear one day message that the brother brother preached upon I would like for you to hear just hear it and then you can say whatever you want you understood me I'm almost done after all the things that have happened explain this to you quickly uh in 1974 and October the 26 I went to Mexico accompanying brother Bernie gar as many times he took me when I was really young I think if I didn't go at least 40 times to mexo if I didn't go 40 times I didn't go do you understand me accompanying brother Bernie on that occasion on 26th of October I brother and that's the day that that my wife and I chose to get married I want you to notice how brother Bernie is in at that time we were in t where brother fail was the pastor there would be about 800 to a thousand people that would gather there and I I got married during a convention or services Debbie and Sunday the one the ones that can help me is Debbie and Jo Joanna what was it Sunday okay now notice brother Bernie was was before all that and instead of saying to the people today is my birthday instead of brother Bernie saying today is my birthday today is my birthday brother Bernie instead of telling all the people he didn't say a word and the reason he did not say that because he wanted everything focused he wanted all the attention on me and my wife what a man huh and he didn't say anything that it was his birthday because then they it would have lost we would have lost maybe the people would have gone but he didn't say so I remember I love brother Bernie and from him a real man of God God I don't know what you believe but that's what I believe he he was my pastor when I was 10 12 years old I remember him speaking in tongues and I remember that one day the light came into the into the service and struck the pulpit here I have never seen anybody speak in tongues like brother Bernie have you seen this things they put on the street where they put this blower thing on it and they they they uh they use them for advertisement and they go like this you know what I'm talking about the air is going in them and then when they let the air down they go well that's way brother Bernie used to speak in tongues one time inly remember him like this go down like this like that speaking in tongues wow that man had the Holy Ghost already and not only that my grandma was speaking tongues and my mother was speaking tongues and I was what 12 13 14 one more thing brother sisters can you forgive me for what I'm going to do now you know it's not right for a woman to step in the Pulpit right so I'm going to I respect and I honor that but we've come here today we've get we let the boys speak we come here to honor Jesus Christ is that right and we've come here to honor his servant brother Bernie Garcia for his birthday amen and I think it's only right we let them speak now let's let's hear just for a minute or two they don't know what I'm doing but I have a surprise if you give me a little bit oford here we've heard Bernie Billy and Joseph right Bernie Billy Joseph well guess who's next she doesn't know I'm doing this I'll give you a few second think yes say something at least say happy birthday

he's my my mentor he was my first boyfriend um but most of all I worked hand inand with him all my life he sent me to college to learn how to type and uh work on the computer so I could help him in the office I've been his sidekick forever longer longer than Bernie Billy and Joseph so um I feel like he's my heart I feel him I know what he's thinking before he says it I know what I know what he likes I know what he doesn't like I was I was second in command after my mom no my mom was the pretty one and I was the worker but I I love him I love him I believe he has uh one a Ministry that is out of this world and I know he still has it uh I respect him so much uh it's pretty hard to compare any person to that to him but most important thing that he taught me was love love for the people he always told me when you see a church in trouble it's not the people it's the big boys you always when we go to Mexico we go to Brazil to colia I traveled all over the world with him and um he was an example to me and I'm grateful for that I always remembered um I had many sisters and many brothers because he was a dad to all and we shared him and um I'm grateful for that I learned a lot I just I love him I love my mom and I I love you all and um I hope we have a good time with them too and we get some cake God bless you you can agree with me uh I think we all have one thing in common and

perfect service how many of you are with me I believe all all of [Music] youel that reminds me of that occasion when brother brandham spoke to us about Michel Angelo that great sculptor that he finally got to finish his Great Masterpiece Moses and he was so excited that he took the hammer and he he hit the the image he struck the image and he said speak and well brother Bram says that Mark he left on that image in that sculpture is what made him the Masterpiece the same way when the Lord Jesus Christ was hurt that's what made him the Masterpiece and forgive me for being so daring this precious and perfect message this service that's so perfect the fault had to come in the of [Music] brother there's some words that I've never gotten tired of saying I I was reminded by the when brother Bernie was telling us his story he says God called me for two things to help the the Latin American [Music] people the Hispanic people to help the youth whether married or not if you haven't heard it I recommend you listen to it so I identify myself as a Hispanic I don't identify myself as a Mexican I identify myself as a Hispanic and being so I I dare to say that God granted me this
