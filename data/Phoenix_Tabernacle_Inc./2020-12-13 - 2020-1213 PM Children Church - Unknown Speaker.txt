way to the end and then you forget all the answers so we're gonna give you a chance to win a prize is that okay okay awesome before we start let bow our heads please lord jesus as we present your children to you and we present the reading of the gospel we pray that in this simple way for children that they understand it so they can take a grasp and an understanding of the plan of salvation for their lives i pray that you help them learn and that it stick in their brain and in their heart so they can win a gift card in the name of the lord jesus christ and everybody said praise the lord let's get started let's have a round of applause for brother luke amen this comes from the first chapter of the book of luke verse 5 to 25. there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughter of aaron and her name was elizabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless that means they were very good people believed in god praise god and they had no child because that elizabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years which means they were really old and they could not have a child because they were so old but what is my favorite saying who knows what my favorite saying is amen with god all things are possible give him a round of applause that's right and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before god in the ordinance of his course according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord so who are we talking about what's his name zacharias and what was he doing amen and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of the incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zachariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john wow and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb praise god and many of the children of israel shall be turned to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am old i'm an old man and my wife is well stricken in years so did he believe his angel he questioned the angel he doubted the angel how could this be because i'm so old and my wife is so old it's impossible but guess what with god all things are possible thank you can you all say that with god things are possible amen and the angel answered answering said unto him i am gabriel that standeth in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believeth not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season so what does that mean if somebody is dumb that you will be dumb what does that mean yes in the grace what's it my and the people waited for zacharias and marvel that he tarried so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his administration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and hurt and hid herself five months saying thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my approach reproach among men amen can you give him a round of applause please okay so we need four brave children that we're paying attention and there'll be plenty of opportunities like where's the four i say okay one there's one hand right there is that jocelyn come on jocelyn with your fashionable mask i don't know you want to come up anybody else come on chloe and one more boy oh let's do kitty and that's fine come on okay let's get the questions up there please can you children say hello to brother luke hello hello say hello to the audience

zachariah's job and what was he burning who knows that you know it okay what was zechariah's job and what can you read the answer um he was a priest and he was burning incense is that right [Applause] okay next question number two who appeared to zachariah gabriel the angel was that right amen [Applause] i would have picked angel labor what did the angel tell zechariah what did the angel tell zachariah you wanna look do you know what that tonight here that he was gonna have a son and his name was gonna be john is that right hey man [Applause] next question next question is why did the angel cause zechariah not to speak can you read the options please because he was being rude and kept interrupting him because the angel liked bullying him no because he didn't like zechariah no or because the angel did it by accident [Laughter] difficulties whoever types these questions accidentally wrote the drunkens so you tell me how come the angel said zachariah you're going to be not able to talk did zechariah believe the angel when he told him that he was going to have a baby [Music] give her a round of applause that is right okay so chloe you get to choose one of these dairy queen or in and out is this that's very quick and that's it yay can you give them a round of applause please [Applause] i heard a ah did something happen and i missed it and then i you gave your gift card to tata oh you're a sweetheart wow give him a round of applause it is better to give than to receive because he knows he has better chances of tata taking him to in-n-out than daddy so he's smart very good ready sir let's continue we're going to be reading from luke 1 26-38 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent to god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came unto her and said hail thou thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said to her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth his son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how should this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god the son of god praise the lord and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible praise the lord and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word wow so she kind of had like a different attitude than zechariah yes zechariah didn't believe it he's like nah nah i'm old man what are you talking about and mary even though she was a little troubled yes right the bible said she was troubled she said well i don't know how it can happen because i've never known a man but be it unto me according to your word isn't that awesome amen oh man that's cool and the angel departed from her amen amen that's it brother that's it so can we get four more kids four

i'm a big fan thank you your son is like the best i appreciate it thank you all right so chapter 39 says and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost so was the baby not moving before that no the baby was not moving at all so they thought that the baby wasn't alive and then when mary went and greeted elizabeth then the baby just jumped yes what imagine being a pregnant woman and not feeling your baby move and then the baby is just like as soon as you walk in wow i think there was another gospel where it says that at the name of jesus right as soon as you mentioned the name of jesus even a dead baby could come alive in the mama's stomach oh what would that do to a born again christian let's see let's see like you know how like the hyenas one is like whenever they heard mufasa they're like well this is way better than that well i'm gonna say jesus so we're gonna see how christians shout let's see i'm testing you jesus jesus jesus give jesus a round of applause okay so so so john kicked and came alive in his mama's tummy and then the bible says he what he got filled with the holy ghost how many wants the holy ghost but you think i'm too small to get the holy ghost well insee teensy winsy baby wavy got the holy ghost in his mama's belly so you can get it too go ahead read it and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord amen and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior and so you remember this right because you were there yes i was there so as you're reading it kind of kind of say it the way you said it that day because i'm sure you were so anointed because after knowing the baby came to life this is where you actually praise the lord right yes so go ahead show it should read it and show us how you praise them as you read it and mary said my soul do magnify the lord and my spirit has rejoiced in god my savior hallelujah amen for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty has done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation and he has showed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away he has opened his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy and he has spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed forever and marry adobe with her about three months and

happened saying the name of jesus a it brought great joy and revival be i made the family disappointed and sad see it caused the dead baby to be alive and filled it with the holy ghost or d it made the baby jump from great joy and so did the mother ooh it could be tricky but what are the two things we mentioned here it made them they're dreamt from the gray drawer and the baby as well the mother probably jumped too but there was another thing first before the baby leaped for joy the baby came to life yes with the holy spirit what did mary do after the baby came back to life a she got scared
