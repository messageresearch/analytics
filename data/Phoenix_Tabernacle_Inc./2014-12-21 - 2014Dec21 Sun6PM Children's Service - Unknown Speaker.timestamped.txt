[55:06] [Music]
[55:07] seated amen as as the piano continues to
[55:10] play
[55:13] softly I
[55:16] imagine what a journey it must have
[55:21] been that poor little
[55:23] donkey I'm not calling brother mik a
[55:26] donkey
[55:28] Mary and Joseph on their
[55:31] Journey Through the
[55:34] river over the
[55:38] mountains and they probably saw coyotes
[55:41] and wolves and D
[55:45] creatures but the whole
[55:49] time Mary
[55:52] knew she had something special inside of
[55:54] her
[55:57] now I ask myself how many Christians
[56:00] Born Again know that they have something
[56:03] special inside of
[56:07] [Music]
[56:10] them I'm sure Mary had lots of doubts
[56:13] [Music]
[56:15] brother it's so
[56:18] cold or it's so
[56:20] hot this journey is so
[56:23] hard we should have stayed back at home
[56:28] but that still small
[56:30] [Music]
[56:31] voice oh my daughter remember what the
[56:34] angel
[56:37] said now how many here remember what
[56:40] your angel
[56:44] said you have life inside of
[56:47] [Music]
[56:48] you the life that's inside of you is not
[56:52] your
[56:55] own he was carrying the very life of
[57:01] God when you're born
[57:04] again something's different about
[57:08] you something's different inside of
[57:12] you you don't want to do the same things
[57:15] anymore Mary had to put away her
[57:19] toys she couldn't waste her time of of
[57:22] Facebooking
[57:24] anything Facebook she had Jesus inside
[57:28] of
[57:31] her so she finally got to the city
[57:37] Bethlehem and she realizes I don't fit
[57:41] [Music]
[57:44] in everywhere I go I'm being
[57:47] [Music]
[57:50] rejected excuse me

[58:22] know what
[58:26] I have a I have a room in the
[58:30] stable
[58:33] St it's nothing much but at least you're
[58:36] not going to be out in the
[58:39] cold how many of us would have been
[58:44] offended at the sight of that
[58:49] stable
[58:51] cows maybe a goat or two
[58:56] it probably smelled like 10,000
[59:02] goats they took their first step in the
[59:07] stable that was probably uh animal um
[59:12] fees on the
[59:17] floor it l like a potty like the animals

[1:00:21] Mary what a Christian the angel said she
[1:00:24] was favored amongst all all
[1:00:30] women she wasn't a mean
[1:00:35] girl she probably said Joseph is
[1:00:42] perfect it just needs a a feminine
[1:00:47] touch she probably took off her her
[1:00:49] little
[1:00:51] Shaw covered the window like a curtain
[1:00:57] she probably tried to move the hay
[1:01:00] stack to make a couch a hay
[1:01:04] stack and Joseph said let me move that
[1:01:06] darling let
[1:01:08] me they rearranged the the the the tools
