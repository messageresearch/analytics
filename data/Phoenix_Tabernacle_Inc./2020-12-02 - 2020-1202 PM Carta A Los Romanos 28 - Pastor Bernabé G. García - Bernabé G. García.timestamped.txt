[5:28] 17
[5:58] for
[6:07] after six days Jesus Takes Peter James
[6:09] and John his brother and bringeth them
[6:12] up into a high mountain theart was
[6:14] transfigured before them and his face
[6:15] shine as the sun and his rment was white
[6:18] as the light and behold there appeared
[6:20] unto them Moses and Elias talking with
[6:22] him then answered Peter and said unto
[6:24] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[6:26] if thou wil let us make here three
[6:28] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[6:30] one for Elias while he yet spake Behold
[6:33] a bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[6:34] behold the voice out of the cloud which
[6:36] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[6:39] well pleased hear ye
[6:42] himy now Revelation
[6:58] 41
[7:02] after this I looked and behold a door
[7:04] was opened in heaven and the first voice
[7:06] which I heard as it were of a trumpet
[7:09] talking with me which said come up
[7:11] hither and I will show you the things
[7:13] which must be
[7:16] Hereafter let us
[7:23] PR father I present each person here
[7:26] along with us in your
[7:28] hands
[7:31] that you might be the one that takes
[7:33] control of
[7:37] everything and as your servant I take
[7:39] control over every spirit this
[7:45] morning and that you might permit that
[7:47] the word flow freely just as you have
[7:49] given it to
[7:51] me that which you have given to me of
[7:54] this message of the
[7:58] hour what is the benefit the placing in
[8:01] the growth of each one of your
[8:04] children we ask it in the name of the
[8:06] Lord Jesus Christ amen once again I want
[8:09] to recognize everyone visiting us this
[8:22] morning want to say that being that
[8:24] we're have a series that I'm speaking on
[8:26] it's hard for you to understand
[8:28] me
[8:34] I've been noting something ever since I
[8:37] started this series I've been pointing
[8:39] towards something since I
[8:43] started the Lord permits I want to get
[8:46] to it
[8:51] today I want to say this that I'm not
[8:53] saying it for to about anyone
[8:58] individual
[9:00] but I want to do it because that's what
[9:02] God has given
[9:07] us the message that has been given to us
[9:10] is a beautiful
[9:17] message brother bam has taught us you
[9:19] can't preach any higher than what you
[9:26] live I believe we have lived or we're
[9:28] going to be speaking on this
[9:32] morning how many were here last Sunday
[9:34] would you raise your
[9:37] hand you should understand very
[9:41] well we're going to be putting on a
[9:43] transparency
[9:45] here that of the
[9:55] pyramid pyramid along with the Caps
[9:57] pyramid itself has seven part to is
[9:59] seven steps going
[10:04] up and the eighth part is a is a pyramid
[10:07] to
[10:11] itself it's a headstone that's placed
[10:13] upon every
[10:17] pyramid we have proven through the
[10:19] message and the and the
[10:23] Bible that the pyramid is a Church of
[10:26] the Living
[10:28] God
[10:30] and at the same time it's each
[10:37] individual the church has to have the
[10:39] headstone in order to be
[10:44] sealed and each individual needs a
[10:46] headstone to be
[10:50] sealed we've seen that the fifth
[10:56] age the age to which Martin Luther was a
[10:58] messenger
[11:03] that's the beginning of the return again
[11:05] of the wheat
[11:09] plant that's the age that produced the
[11:14] stock that's the fifth
[11:19] agey then the sixth age Wesley's
[11:23] Age We proved that that was the age that
[11:26] produced the
[11:28] tassel then the seventh
[11:31] age is thean church
[11:34] age
[11:36] that's that produces the
[11:39] shook then the fourth
[11:43] step which brings the seed the
[11:50] grain we prove that that grain is formed
[11:53] outside of the three
[11:55] [Music]
[11:57] steps it's separate from the three three
[11:59] steps is not part of
[12:01] it it's outside of the three
[12:05] steps that's the eighth
[12:10] step or just to return back to the
[12:12] beginning
[12:14] again that's what I want to be speaking
[12:15] on a little
[12:17] bit about The
[12:21] Headstone that's the age that we're
[12:23] present
[12:25] in you can write all these things down
[12:29] if you so
[12:31] desire even though we already mentioned
[12:33] it last
[12:35] Sunday it's the head age headstone
[12:39] age it's the age of the
[12:42] eye it's a bride
[12:45] age it's the wheat
[12:48] age it's the age of the
[12:51] grain it's the word
[12:54] Age It's a Great Seal
[12:57] age it's Ephesians once
[13:01] again and in order for you to understand
[13:03] what an Ephesians
[13:06] is Ephesians parallels
[13:12] Joshua the Book of Joshua is the placing
[13:14] of the people of Israel in their
[13:17] Homeland so we're now in this
[13:22] age in the time of the placing of God's
[13:26] children if you understand so far say
[13:28] Amen
[13:31] for benefit of those who don't know
[13:35] me when I ask you do you understand me
[13:37] I'm not asking if you
[13:40] believe just trying to see if you
[13:42] understand what I'm trying to
[13:46] say there's no benefit to teach
[13:48] something if it's not being
[13:52] understood so let's repeat all together
[13:54] as a
[13:58] class
[14:00] the fifth age is of which part of the
[14:02] wheat
[14:04] plant the young men
[14:06] here don't anyone answer just those in
[14:09] the
[14:10] front I think they should know the
[14:16] message can't benefit if we're not a
[14:18] part of the
[14:20] [Laughter]
[14:25] matter W AG which is the sixth part what
[14:27] part of the is it
[14:30] to they say is that
[14:33] right are they
[14:36] right you have to take part in it
[14:40] too Church
[14:44] age is what part of the pl wheat plant
[14:47] number
[14:49] three what is the third
[14:52] part it's a
[14:56] shock besides this age out Beyond these
[15:02] age is that what the fourth part forms
[15:06] which is the wheat it's a grain it's the
[15:11] word it's
[15:13] outside now this is a
[15:16] question please don't
[15:19] answer just ask ask to
[15:23] yourself the
[15:26] head is a a head part of the body
[15:31] just for you to think about
[15:34] it of course the head is part of the
[15:38] body that's the top
[15:41] part where the brain
[15:44] is which that which moves the
[15:49] body that's the age we're in
[15:55] now this is the wheat
[15:57] plant
[16:00] first part was the
[16:03] stock second part was the
[16:06] tassel third was a
[16:09] shock now the question is
[16:14] this those that form part of this plan
[16:17] those genuine lutherans methodists
[16:22] Pentecostals will they go in the Rapture
[16:25] or no yes or no amen amen
[16:31] and then the fourth
[16:32] part is the
[16:35] grain the
[16:38] word adoption
[16:43] time we're living in adoption
[16:47] time for there to be
[16:51] adoption in order to have be an adoption
[16:53] there must be a
[16:55] maturity a rip a growing and a ripening
[17:00] there must be an
[17:04] approval once the thing reaches its
[17:08] spot then comes a placing of a
[17:11] son then
[17:12] [Music]
[17:14] actually we're in a placing
[17:17] time that's plac locating placing God's
[17:26] Sons actually we're living in a very
[17:28] beautiful time
[17:32] and we've read these three
[17:34] scriptures we've spoken up to what we
[17:36] said so
[17:37] far if you understand say
[17:45] Amen here we are with the pyramid a
[17:52] mountain we've seen how Jesus God was
[17:54] take Jesus Took uh was taken by God up
[17:57] to a great high mountain
[18:01] and Jesus Took along with him three
[18:04] disciples this is called the mount
[18:08] Transfiguration that is a
[18:11] changing from one form to another
[18:15] form we've spoken that how when this
[18:17] took
[18:18] place we see how
[18:22] Peter one of three Tabernacles to be
[18:26] built to that Revelation that had been
[18:32] given Tabernacle for Moses another one
[18:35] for Elijah then another one for
[18:37] Jesus when this
[18:41] happened there was came a cloud that
[18:43] overshadowed
[18:44] them and when that cloud covered
[18:50] them the father took a couple of
[18:52] backward
[18:55] steps said this is my beloved Son here
[18:58] ye
[19:00] him in other words he's the one that's
[19:05] speaking in itself this begins to a a
[19:09] new
[19:11] age pointing to
[19:14] actually what is the day of the the son
[19:19] day because actually the office of a
[19:22] son is not
[19:24] Eternal being that God
[19:27] father
[19:29] being god father he took the form of a
[19:31] man took the body of a man and lived as
[19:34] a
[19:35] son to redeem a
[19:38] son to
[19:40] bring to bring a day a call they call a
[19:43] son
[19:45] day that calls it Christ Christ
[19:50] day when the son will be
[19:52] glorified that's how when
[19:56] Jesus he answered them what he answered
[20:01] when the wise men came to see
[20:05] Jesus these Greeks said we we would see
[20:09] Jesus we would see him we want to know
[20:11] who he is he said to
[20:15] them he said to him except a grain of
[20:18] sweat die the
[20:20] die it abides
[20:25] alone abides
[20:27] alone
[20:31] but you know if it falls and it dies and
[20:33] it falls into the ground it'll bring
[20:34] forth much
[20:35] fruit right
[20:38] there that's when a thunder
[20:42] came he said father glorify thy
[20:45] son glorify your
[20:48] name the voice came down and said I have
[20:52] both glorified
[20:53] it and are glorify it again the prophet
[20:57] said
[20:59] if he glorified him
[21:01] then notice how there was a thunder
[21:06] there what about when the church is
[21:10] glorified because the B will also have
[21:12] to be
[21:15] glorified because actually that's the
[21:17] sun
[21:20] day the prophet said that Jesus
[21:23] Victory or God's
[21:25] Victory actually we are his victory
[21:30] when actually when he is
[21:32] glorified so this time that we're living
[21:36] in we have seen tremendous
[21:39] things for example
[21:42] 1963 the cloud came down there were
[21:45] seven
[21:46] angels when the Seven Angels Came
[21:49] Down they came from
[21:52] eternity and in itself they
[21:54] formed what is called the pillar of
[21:56] cloud the pillar of Fire
[22:00] the Rock of
[22:02] Ages and up into this
[22:05] rock man called William was picked up
[22:08] into
[22:09] it we see how how how this man was
[22:13] placed in the scriptures placed as a
[22:18] great and that before Joshua would be
[22:20] placed a
[22:22] stone so that no one could miss
[22:25] it that the great Joshua that the
[22:27] Bible's talking about
[22:30] that the Holy Spirit would
[22:33] use as a vessel to bring the
[22:36] message that he would Place God's
[22:39] people for nothing less
[22:42] than man called
[22:45] William so so that no one could miss
[22:48] that so that's the message of the
[22:52] hour with that's the message been placed
[22:54] in our hands can you say
[22:57] Amen
[22:59] so I'd like to start to
[23:01] read a few
[23:08] quotes to prove what we're trying to say
[23:11] to
[23:11] you are you
[23:14] happy do you love the
[23:17] Lord do you want all the
[23:21] word I'm going to start
[23:24] reading from the message Blasphemous
[23:27] names
[23:29] page
[23:33] 23 I'd like to clear up that I'm not
[23:36] going to be referring too much of what
[23:37] I'm
[23:38] reading until I get way to the end of
[23:40] the
[23:42] message and the reason is because time
[23:44] does not
[23:46] permit but I want to let it recorded on
[23:49] table the
[23:52] message so those that want to study can
[23:55] go
[23:56] study Blasphemous names
[24:03] the Holy Spirit seals you in with
[24:08] Christ then you become
[24:10] one you become
[24:16] one see you and Christ live
[24:23] together at that day you'll know that I
[24:26] in the Father the father in me
[24:30] I in you you and you in
[24:31] [Music]
[24:35] me see then that's a sealed unit of the
[24:39] Lord
[24:44] God now and then they are Vindicated and
[24:49] placed when that takes
[24:54] place they become Vindicated Sons and
[24:57] Daughters of God
[24:59] page 23 24
[25:03] see a family a
[25:07] family when and a son is born into it
[25:10] it's a son
[25:13] [Music]
[25:15] then but that son had tutors to raise
[25:19] [Applause]
[25:22] it and if that son never did come to be
[25:24] the right kind of a
[25:27] son
[25:28] he never become
[25:36] Heir but if he was the right son and the
[25:38] son that would obey his
[25:41] father then that son was
[25:44] [Music]
[25:45] adopted or placed
[25:51] positionally he become air of what the
[25:54] father had page
[25:57] 24
[26:18] and that's what God was doing on Mount
[26:19] Transfiguration when he took his own son
[26:22] after he had been proven to be the right
[26:24] son see and had stood all Temptations He
[26:27] took him up on M Transfiguration and
[26:30] overshadowed
[26:47] him you know in the Old Testament they
[26:50] took a son dressed him in in a nice
[26:52] pretty garment and set him out before
[26:54] the public and they had a ceremony of
[26:56] placing or we call it a
[27:04] adopting Now by placing a son in other
[27:07] words the son was a son when he was
[27:15] born there's where our Pentecostal
[27:17] people made their
[27:20] [Laughter]
[27:27] mistake
[27:31] being born into the family by the Holy
[27:33] Ghost that's right but then we must be
[27:35] the right kind of children tutored by
[27:37] the right
[27:39] tutor page
[27:51] 25 now when Jesus had been obedient
[27:54] Jesus to God God placed him positionally
[27:57] this is he this is
[28:00] [Laughter]
[28:01] [Music]
[28:08] [Music]
[28:10] [Laughter]
[28:27] him
[28:28] he now when the member is born by the
[28:31] Holy Ghost into the family of God and
[28:33] has proven to have these this virtues in
[28:36] him then God can see virtue knowledge
[28:38] Temperance patience brotherly kindness
[28:40] and godliness in him then God seals him
[28:43] or places him and there that's when you
[28:45] see the Sons and Daughters of God
[28:51] Amen brother man says that's where the
[28:53] Pentecostals make their
[28:55] mistake I'd like to call your attention
[28:57] to that
[28:59] I've been now 17
[29:01] years been preaching this
[29:05] message and I'm still preaching the same
[29:07] thing I preached 17 years ago I want you
[29:09] to
[29:11] notice one thing is to be
[29:14] born when you're placed now here in
[29:18] faith you've already been born is that
[29:22] right now
[29:24] notice take
[29:27] note
[29:28] make a not of that and check it
[29:31] out remember you are
[29:33] responsible to check me
[29:36] out and that's the biggest disgrace The
[29:39] Misfortune that has come to
[29:41] me that the people don't check out what
[29:43] I
[29:44] say and then any kind of new fight comes
[29:47] along and he moves
[29:49] you someone thinks
[29:50] [Music]
[29:52] he I given you enough material for you
[29:55] to go check it
[29:57] out for you to make sure that it's the
[29:59] message that it's God's
[30:01] mouth that has spoken what I'm
[30:03] repeating the prophet
[30:06] says this is not page
[30:08] 25 of Blasphemous
[30:11] names now when a member is
[30:14] born by the the Holy Ghost into the
[30:18] family the family of
[30:20] God and has
[30:23] proven to have this virtues in
[30:26] him then God can see
[30:31] virtue
[30:32] knowledge Temperance
[30:36] patience brotherly
[30:39] kindness and
[30:41] godliness so where is
[30:44] Faith why didn't he Place Faith
[30:47] there did he forget
[30:50] Faith because when he's born when a
[30:53] child is born he's automatically he's
[30:56] got
[30:56] faith
[30:58] he's been placed in the
[31:00] foundation he's already gone through
[31:01] three steps justification
[31:05] sanctification New Birth by the Holy
[31:09] Ghost not the Seal of the Holy not the
[31:12] Seal of the Holy Ghost the birth of a

[31:19] right that's where I've been fought and
[31:22] they're still fighting
[31:23] me and they're going to fight me till
[31:25] the end but one day they're going to to
[31:28] find
[31:29] out that is one thing is to be
[31:32] born and the other thing is to be placed
[31:36] positionally as a son and that son that
[31:40] daughter God
[31:43] vindicates those are God's
[31:45] children so

[32:09] 17 is when God places the
[32:13] son it's not
[32:16] Transfiguration when God raises to the

[46:23] andere and seere is somebody who can see
[46:27] is that right I I I showed you in the
[46:30] message that I
[46:32] preached that when the Fulfillment of of
[46:36] the
[46:37] scripture when God spoke through the
[46:39] mouth of
[46:41] Moses I will raise a prophet like unto
[46:46] thee I told you that that was the Lord
[46:49] Jesus
[46:50] Christ is that correct I showed you that
[46:54] it is
[46:55] Jesus speaking in this day because it
[46:59] was Jesus who brought the
[47:01] child who brought the word and the word
[47:04] comes to the
[47:06] prophets is that right I told that we
[47:09] were
[47:10] prophets
[47:12] here someone who can
[47:15] see somebody who's got prophetical
[47:20] protic see the high
[47:23] things
[47:25] prophesied but even though they can
[47:27] see someone over
[47:30] them and the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost put
[47:35] an
[47:36] overseer over
[47:38] them just stay there brother okay until
[47:41] I finish
[47:45] okay the Holy Ghost has made him o
[47:50] overseer and You' got to respect them in
[47:53] that
[47:55] manner and no matter what the pastor has
[48:02] done if you if you respect him in your
[48:05] heart as God
[48:08] servant God will respect you for doing
[48:12] it he that receives me receives him that
[48:15] sent me Jesus
[48:19] said God demands respect for his
[48:23] servants then as you respect that
[48:25] servant respect
[48:28] God you don't respect his servant you do
[48:31] not respect
[48:32] God you don't respect
[48:35] God doesn't respect
[48:38] you the
[48:42] Lord now the revelation of Jesus Christ
[48:44] to tie it
[48:46] together page
[48:50] 157 you got a pastor that really tells
[48:52] you the
[48:54] truth you ought to honor God
[48:59] and stay in the spirit Mark me down
[49:01] there stay in the
[49:06] spirit you got a pastor that really
[49:08] tells you the
[49:10] truth you ought to honor
[49:13] God and stay in the spirit and worship
[49:22] God realizing that you're going to be
[49:24] lost if you don't you're lost L you do
[49:29] it now this is Brother bham speaking
[49:31] this is not brother Bernie
[49:35] speaking he says you have to honor God
[49:40] and stay in the
[49:41] spirit what does that mean brother to
[49:43] stay in the
[49:44] spirit you can't stay in the spirit if
[49:47] you don't honor
[49:49] him because it was the Holy Ghost that
[49:51] plac him as supervisor of over
[49:55] overlooking the you get out of the
[49:58] spirit and you don't honor
[50:02] God when you don't honor God's servant
[50:09] okay over
[50:13] Das what
[50:15] is an
[50:25] overseer
[50:27] a friend selected to manage the Pastoral
[50:30] work of a congregation to which he
[50:34] belongs that's one of the
[50:35] [Music]
[50:37] reasons why I have not placed
[50:40] pastors I could have placed pastors
[50:42] throughout Latin
[50:44] America we would have had Latin America
[50:47] controlled but I never did it never done
[50:51] it because I don't believe
[50:54] such I believe that one should raise up
[50:56] from a
[50:58] from the
[50:59] congregation a
[51:01] friend and that
[51:04] friend is
[51:06] selected to
[51:08] manage the Pastoral work of a
[51:12] congregation manager it's a
[51:17] manager but you know that the natural
[51:19] types of
[51:21] spiritual they throw the temper over
[51:23] here and the fits over there man the
[51:26] manager
[51:27] says you play Third Base now forget it
[51:31] Third Base
[51:33] nothing ball game
[51:35] comes and John do didn't show up have
[51:39] you noticed that this
[51:41] day
[51:44] because they want to have the manager as
[51:46] a
[51:48] puppet but the manager's place to manage
[51:51] the team amen is that right amen amen
[51:58] now overseer okay overseer
[52:03] overseer is a
[52:07] superintendent he's a
[52:10] supervisor one that
[52:18] supervises such a person having
[52:20] Authority delegated by an
[52:23] employer to
[52:25] hire transf
[52:27] ER
[52:29] suspend
[52:31] recall
[52:32] promote
[52:37] assign or to discharge another
[52:42] employee or to recommend such action I
[52:45] want you to Mark me down these words
[52:46] okay and and I haven't got time I'm not
[52:49] even halfway to my message I haven't got
[52:51] time to finish my message but I want you
[52:53] to mark this
[52:54] down okay a supervisor
[52:57] supervisor has the
[52:59] authority number one to
[53:02] hire number two to to
[53:06] transfer to
[53:09] suspend to
[53:11] recall are you okay after
[53:14] now recall
[53:20] promote
[53:22] assign or
[53:25] discharge man that's that's rough
[53:29] huh no wonder that people don't want to
[53:31] have a
[53:33] pastor look it up in the dictionary
[53:39] now what does the word revoke mean
[53:43] call if someone you place in a
[53:46] job for example mayor of the
[53:50] city and then he's
[53:52] recalled take away his
[53:55] office
[54:00] isn't it true that more sometime more
[54:01] than four walk around with the head cast
[54:02] down it's kicking
[54:06] around I was this and
[54:09] they they put me off to one
[54:12] side the
[54:13] supervisor the
[54:15] superintendent is a
[54:19] pastor he has the
[54:21] authority authorization to
[54:24] hire transfer
[54:27] suspend recall promote
[54:32] assign or
[54:34] discharge any other
[54:38] employee employed by the same boss is
[54:41] that
[54:42] right so then the
[54:46] pastor he's a
[54:51] trustee a trustee is one to whom
[54:54] something is entrusted
[54:57] and the Holy
[55:00] Ghost has entrusted the
[55:04] pastor The Souls of all of
[55:08] those have been purchased by the blood
[55:10] of
[55:11] Christ then he entrusts the pastor gives
[55:14] trust to the
[55:15] pastor these
[55:19] sheep almost all the smiles are
[55:22] gone I'm going to take a little bit
