once was Lost but now Found was bl but now I [Música] see was Blind but [Música] now [Música] [Aplausos] [Música] I God bless you wasn't that beautiful Tonight We have a special Treat in Store for you as we enter into the Second Book of the series of supernatural the Life of William Branham the young Man in his desperation covering the years of 1933 to 1946 in the chapter numbers we in chapter 12 Which Just happens to be the First chapter of the Second Book And I just comment that Uh I thank the lord for bringing Our prophet along and through the early spiritual wilderness That he Found himself in as bewildering as It was What Faith he Had inside remained Alive and the lord Had brought him to a Point in his Life Where he was 24 years old the year is 1933 as we Start [Música] William bram's newfound Faith was not a sideline to him not something extra like butter and Jelly to spread on his Bread It was his Bread for 24 years he Had wandered aimlessly through his own spiritual wilderness hungry to the point of starvation in a spiritual sense eating bark leaves and grass to Stay Alive and Now for the First time in his Life he was eating real Food packed with spiritual nutrition feeding on Jesus Christ the Bread of Life Who came down from Heaven to give eternal Life to a dying man Bill felt his spiritual strength growing week by week suddenly the world held more meaning than Just sweat and blisters rejection and confusion Now Billy Had hope And Love and a purpose that was everlasting his Faith in Jesus Christ quickly became the center of his existence the pivot around Which all his thoughts and activities revolved Billy heard his pastor preach that The Reason almighty God sketched his thoughts in the Bible was so that Every Christian could know the Will of the lord for his or her own Life all It took was to read the Bible and pray that saying made sense to Bill and he read his Bible viciously eager to increase his knowledge of the word so that he could put it to use Daily to to him the Bible seemed like a House Full of treasures that he Had suddenly inherited he Wanted to go into Every room Pull out the drawers open the cupboards and searched through the closets to see exactly What It was he now owned he Had not read many Books since he finished the seventh grade 10 years before so his Reading skills were rusty and Slow he followed the general meaning well Enough but he could not pronounce Those difficult old testament names like ara zeres neb jaz zer Babel and bah and he often struggled with the odd syntax of King James english so Far removed from his own Kentucky dialect when he preached his First sermon at the beginning of 1933 Bill did not Trust his tongue to read the Bible aloud instead he persuaded hope to Sit on the platform behind him and read his text for him whenever he gave her a Signal his subject Was the Grace and care of God in the tumultuous Life of Samson hope read bill's text Out Of The book of judges and Bill started to expound soon he Wanted to read the to the congregation What Jesus said in John 14 he nodded to hope and She began Let not not Your Heart be troubled Bill broke in you heard what it said Don't let yourself be troubled he nodded Again in hope and She She continued Reading ye Believe in God Believe also in Me Again Bill interrupted do you do it do you really believe and so continued his First fumbling attempts at preaching awkward and choppy Yes but redeemed by an intense sincerity that Made him eloquent listening In The audience ella Branham considered her son's words carefully the dramatic change in billy's Life as well as his miraculous healing Had awakened something spiritual Deep within her own Soul She responded by committing her Life to Jesus in her 39th year overflowing with happiness Bill baptized his mother in the name of the lord Jesus Christ encouraged by his mother's response Billy began pressing his Father To Come To Church Charles Branham refused and in spite of all bill's efforts could not be budg in that Direction that bothered Billy he couldn't Shake his concern for The Lost based on that hor experience during his operation at age 14 when he Had seemingly sank down into the region of Lost and drifting souls Now Bill prayed often Dear God Don't let my Daddy go to a Place like that please Let him see your Grace and accept your pardon One night after most of the family Had gone to Bed Billy lay on a Pet in the Front room praying for his Father Who was drinking at a local tavern While Billy prayed he Had an impression as If a voice was saying Rise up he stood up and walked out of the door not knowing Why but feeling like he was Being drawn toward something behind the house a footpath crossed several vacant Lots overgrown with broom sage which is a reddish knee-high grass common to that Area Billy followed The path by starlight when he reached the center of the Field he knelt bowed his Head folded his hands and continued praying for his Father suddenly he opened his eyes and was startled to see a man standing 10 Feet in front of him a most unusual Man short and slight of build with hair down to his shoulders a Close trim beard and a white robe that stood out clearly Under the Stars The man was standing sideways to Bill Looking toward the East he was a peaceful figure his hands were folded and his Feet were staggered One Foot slightly ahead of the other Bill looked a Second Time at Those Feet incredibly they were not touching the ground Now wait a minute bill thought as he bit his own knuckle hard Enough to hurt I'm not asleep no I was in There praying for Dad and something said come out here and here stands this Man it all seemed very real the same breeze that tugged at the tall grass caused this man's White robe to ripple Bill snapped off a Piece of broom sage and stuck like a toothpick he thought that looks like the lord Jesus I wonder If It is stepping off theth Bill moved himself so he could see a little more of the man's face he cleared his throat The man did not move Bill thought I believe I'll call him out loud he said Jesus The man turned and H out his Arms that Was the last Thing Billy remembered he Lost consciousness Forward but not before that Face was stamped forever in his Memory a Face so Rich in character no artist in the world could Ever Paint it It was a Face stern with Authority he looked like If he would speak The World would end and yet his eyes radiated such kindness and compassion And Love at daybreak Bill came to himself Still in the broom sage Field shivering from the Cold night Air and from his wet pajama shirt evidently soaked by his own Tears he walked home dressed then bubbling with excitement he headed Straight to for his pastor's House to ask his opinion God bless [Aplausos] you c you [Música] [Música] this Life is a Journey we Walk by Faith as We overcome the mountains in Our way so right here in this moment May Our strength be renewed as we look Back and we recall How we've seen him move and If there's anybody here That's Found him faithful anybody here that knows He's a say amen and If there's anybody here who's seen his Power anybody here brought Through The Fire say amen anybody here Found Joy in the middle of sorrow Just say amen [Música] sometimes through the darkness It's hard to see so Just be brave and follow Where he le greater is the one who's in Us than he who's in the world Child of God remember the Battle is lord and If there's anybody here who's Found him faithful anybody here that knows He's a say amen and If there's anybody here who's seen his Power anybody here brought Through The Fire say amen [Música] anybody here Found Joy in the midle of sorrow Peace in the Storm hope for tomorrow and seen him Time and Time Again Just say amen even in the valy of the Shadow when you feel alone in the unknown Just say amen Just say amen and even When the storms are ring Stand Know You're Not For Just say amen say [Música] amen anybody here say amen and there's anybody here who's seen his Power anybody here brought Through The Fire Come on and say amen anybody here Found Joy in the midle of

me conocen mi nombre eso estoy aquí para dar un pequeño testimonio sobre lo que Dios ha hecho y mostrado en mi vida Bueno entonces comienza casi como dos meses antes del campamento y bueno Estaba en la escuela y ustedes saben que las pruebas las batallas en la escuela son difíciles yo veo hermanos y hermanas de en Cristo que van a la escuela también ahí y yo Yo sé que es muy difícil para ellos mi gente sabe que yo soy un cristiano me preguntan Oye quieres salir los domingos y les tengo que decir no di Ah bueno tiene la iglesia verdad le dije sí yo tengo que ir a la iglesia y me dicen Pues vas a la iglesia mucho me dicen no necesitas que ir a la iglesia tanto entonces continuamos a hablar y le hablé de ello que eso continuaba a pasar y yo no tenía interés yo no tenía interés de venir a la iglesia seguido y pensé que me estaba alejando un poco más y bueno saben está el campamento que que estaba en camino y todos andan hablando sobre el campamento Cómo va a estar tan emocionante y verdaderamente este año yo no me sentía tan emocionado decía era el campamento y ya este año estaba tan emocionado me prefería yo antes ir con mis amigos y quizás ir al juego de fútbol americano en la escuela Y entonces mis amigos seguían hablando y de eso entonces dije Bueno iré como voy cada año y sem Med semanas antes del campamento mi tío el hermano Álvaro regresé a la casa de práctica estaba ahí me iba a dar un corte de cabello es porque estaba muy tarde en la noche entonces estaba en la casa cortándome el cabello y comenzamos a hablar habla del campamento y me dice estás preparado para el campamento y le contest honestamente no estaba tan emocionado sobre y dije que me pongo casi un poco nervioso como saben los sábados en el campamento todos están como con el espíritu santo no y tengo tenía un poco de miedo y me dice sabes por qué te pones de miedo es porque sabes lo que es no sabe lo que es dice que si no sabes lo que algo es es porque no lo quieres aceptar that sense to me was y yo dije ah sí eso se ya se sonó mejor y dijo eso ya da sentido y me pregunta entonces tú sabes que es el espíritu santo quieres recibirlo y le dije Sí me dice solo tiene que ir al campamento expectativa no solo llegar ahí y tienes que quedarte ahí hasta que recibas algo y comencé a pensar sobre ello Y pensé de qué más tengo que perder sentía que estaba pujando mucho a Dios Entonces necesitaba que pensaba que necesitaba hacer esto entonces vino el campamento llegamos el viernes por la noche y pues nos acomodamos y llegamos al servicio y yo me dije si mismo yo vengo con expectativa y una semana antes del campamento yo en realidad intent en Ora intenté leer la palabra y quedarme en oración entonces vino el viernes por la noche y vine ahí en expectativa de algo y yo creo que esa noche vieron dos ministros yo creo el hermano Alberto fue el que estuvo hablando esa noche y estaba hablando sobre sus pruebas que tuvo que pasar y tuvo su llamada responder algo est hablando con un pequeño y explicó él que Dios sí lo ama hay alguien que sí lo y qui salvó su vida entonces eso me subió el interés en lo que él estaba hablando y me dijo él dijo entonces estado usted aquí en este campamento estuvieron por 10 años seguidos y en mi mente Yo sí estuve pensando tengo que hacer algo porque he venido aquí por un tiempo y dijo ha venido por 10 años y si no ha recibido ahora algo entonces ahora es el tiempo y dijo quizás no haya otra oportunidad Y entonces comencé a orar y orar y la gente comenzó a venir hacia el altar yo vine hacia el altar y comencé a llorar estaba pidiendo por perdón y seguía pido y orando al Señor por favor perdóname por todas las cosas que he hecho y seguía pidiendo y pidiendo y luego un hermano llegó y levantaba mis manos yo y me la agarró y me dice Dios ya te ha perdonado y dio la respuesta a lo que yo estaba diciendo dice Dios ya te ya te ha perdonado ahora recíbelo entonces yo ahí quebré en lágrimas y Sentí algo muy tremendo y mientras estaba allí derramando abriendo mi corazón hermano Álvaro viene hacia m también agarró mi mano y me dice te acuerdas ese espíritu santo que te hablé dice Ese es el espíritu santo y de ese momento ya me había ido y me dice solo sigue adorándole al Señor Dale toda la gloria el señor é abrá puertas para [Música] ustedes por su tiempo y que Dios les [Aplausos] bendiga bueno es algo verdaderamente asombroso cuando vamos al campamento es experi maravillosa y mismo Tengo 23 años de edad siempre pens que mi primer campamento fue en el 2006 pero antes de ir al campamento estaba viendo a través de las fotos haciendo memorias hablá a la a través estas cosas me doy cuenta que mi primer campamento en realidad fue en el 200 entonces hermano Junior solo perd un año y estuve ahí todos los 10 años no estuve ahí pero se siente como Y como dice Hero aoas ao campamento con expectativa de tener ese encuentro ese encuentro con Dios de verle cara a cara de poder conocerle más descubrir que si a Dios le gusta jugar al fútbol Cómo sé que Dios le gusta jugar al fútbol porque puedo ver todos estos jovencitos jugar el fútbol Yo sé que a veces le gusta usted quedarse más tarde Cómo sabe porque yo siento su presencia en la fogata a veces a las do o TR de la mañana aún cantando a veces Apenas puedo cantar pero aún estoy ahí alabándolo unos 10 años maravillosos y estoy en expectativa para el siguiente y ustedes jovencitos niños Espero que algún día en realidad estoy esperando mejor el siguiente campamento Esa será mi oración para ustedes ustedes niños y niñas que puedan ir con nosotros y caminar con nosotros a nuestro lado porque estamos caminando con Dios como Pablo dijo sea un ejemplo de mí como soy ejemplo de Dios es así [Música] hermano des como seguidor deo her Pero espero que lo pueda ver a usted espero verlos ustedes cuatro niños princesas Espero verlas ahí también jovencitas eso verlas ahí porque yo estar ahí y amamos [Música] y como pueden ver hoy tengo mi camiseta del campamento tengo con orgullo porque me encanta estar ahí Yo siempre estoy mirando ha delante para estar ahí cada año real les est dejando con una pregunta espero que sí los esté dejando con una pregunta porque quiero que ustedes puedan ir allá y descubrirlo por s mismos que Dios le [Aplausos] bendiga que Dios le bendiga nuestro Mario y Caleb Solo tengo una Biblia aquí porque yo pienso que es correcto tener la Biblia aquí pero tengo mi escritura pero todo lo que ellos dicen es verdad y estoy seguro que algunos de ustedes mis hermanos jóvenes y más ancianos Ustedes han tenido experiencia con el la presencia del Señor aunque sea el campamento en la iglesia orando dentro de su armario orando antes de una prueba en la escuela Dios ha manifestado de alguna manera en cada una de sus vidas pero yo soy un testigo y yo sé que Dios hace milagros en el campamento aú no sé si el campamento tiene un significado especial pero Soy Testigo de los milagros que ocurren en el campo solo quiero compartir un testimonio corto sobre mi sanidad en el campamento este campamento pasado antes del campamento Yo comencé a tener unos síntomas de casi una gripe y los síntomas comenzon a empeorar cuando turn de dirigir sent muir dirir lado del púlpito el arpa para elom y sentía aliviado después de que David le tocara y le dije a Dios Yo en mi propia mente le dije Señor por favor déjame ser David en esta noche déjame cantar estos cantos para ti para la sanidad comrar dentro de m Entonces fui allá subí Y di todo allí arriba y ven cuando ustedes le den servicio a Dios Tienen que darle sus todo aunque usted orando lo que sea por su libertad si usted va a orar ore con todo su corazón si va a danzar en el espíritu por Dios que sea con todo su corazón y dele su todo y sigió el campamento entonces y pasó eso y ya me sentí un poco mejor pero sabe como el es él no quiere que usted sea libre entonces me dio una doble porción Entonces yo me acordé de mi hermano Pepe é tomó mi temperatura y mi temperatura fue 109 gr Y eso es muy malo no soy un doctor Pero yo sé que es malo verdaderamente no me sentía muy bien en esa noche noche tuvimos compañerismo en la fogata y fue el tiempo para que yo y Pepe fuéramos al área y preparar todo y entonces hicimos todo el trabajo de preparación y yo no me quería ir porque yo sé cómo se pone en la fogata y pero me habían pedido por faor a desc entonces Fu así moviendo mis pies así hacia mi cabaña y me fui a dormir la siguiente mañana la misma cosa no me sentía bien para nada pero llegó el domingo por la noche y el servicio estuvo tremendo los actividades y fue una bendición grande hubieron gente que hicieron videos otros grupos que hicieron dramas y noticias y habían diferentes actividades Pero mis síntomas no me dejaban ser libre y tenía una sudadera pesada encima de mí porque estaba muy frío yo pero después de que el segundo equipo subió estaba hablando yo en mi cabeza Y usted cree que es libre Él me dijo eso yo le dije Sí yo lo creo y luego é me dijo Pruébalo entonces Y entonces ese pensamiento se fue y dije Bueno entonces cómo puedo probar yo que soy libre Cómo puedo probar que he sido sanado entonces la primera cosa que hice es que me quité esa chaqueta esa sudadera pesada y hermano munive me preguntó estás bien te sientes bien y en mi mente decía bueno tienes todos los síntomas pero desde mi corazón Yo le decía Sí estoy bien estaré bien el señor conoce todas las cosas Ese fue mi respuesta para el hermano mun y unos hermanos más vinieron hacia mí porque no me veía tamban bien yo pero yo me quedé con mi bendición porque Dios me dio mi bendición esa ese viernes por la noche me dio mi sanidad el viernes por la noche pero el no quería que yo lo aceptara entonces después de que después de que antes de que el servicio iba a cerrar fue mi turno de subir de nuevo a dirigir y yo quería cantar un canto que con el cual yo me identifico mucho y aquellos que estuvieron ahí el domingo por la noche supieron lo que pasó el espíritu santo solo derramó usted podía ver la gente la gente brincar hacia arriba de sus sillas gente en el altar y los músicos y fue un jubileo allí adentro y de repente Yo comencé a cantar la fiesta de los vencedores comencé a cantar la fiesta de los vencedores y es ese canto tocó mi corazón y comencé a cantar y alabar al Señor y cantamos yo creo ese canto por unos 45 minutos derecho pero no podíamos parar no me podía detener de alabarle a Pero cuando menos me lo esperaba todos los síntomas ya se habían ido yo no sabía lo que pasó pero pasó no sé có Dios sacó todo fuera de mí pero si ocurrió pero después de que el servicio fue despedido fuimos hacia la fogata pero en ese momento no me había dado cuenta que ya fui sanado no fue hasta que llegué hacia la fogata y al hermano mun y él me preguntó de nuevo estás bien te ves diferente y él me dijo tú recibiste tu sanidad all adentro y en ese momento así me pegó no me di cuenta porque Dios es tan grande ni podemos rasgar el lugar de cu grande él es pero un milagro grande ocurrió en mi vida en esa noche nunca había tenido experiencia yo de sanidad divina en mí mismo y aunque los síntomas me pegaron yo creo que mi fe en Dios fue lo cual echó fuera todos esos síntomas y la gente se dio cuenta la gente que me vio antes del campamento me habían visto con esos síntomas y se dieron cuenta grande pudo ser esa enfermedad pero al lado de todo eso yo estaba ahí en la brecha solo haciendo la obra que Dios necesitaba que fuera hecha y estoy gozoso que no me di por vencido Porque después del campamento tú ves todas las bendiciones yo me acuerdo nuestra hermana samera se bautizó si pequeñitos pueden tener experiencia con Dios ustedes les pueden Hablar a mi hermana porque ella sabe experiencia con el señor pero yo los animo Como dijo mi hermano de ir al campamento y es una bendición noy haciendo promoción lo que sea fuado para sereso de los milagrosos milagros ocurren en el campamento ustedes se pueden poner de pie ya hemos terminado esta noche espero que cualquier cosa que le traemos a ustedes en esta noche que fue una bendición yo s que no es mucho pero sabemos que Dios conoce todas las cosas si pudieran inclinar sus rostros por favor Vamos a orar nuestro padre lleno de Gracia estamos aquí Señor y Y tus hijos parándonos por ti señor siendo testigos de los milagros que has hecho en nuestras vidas señor estuvimos aquí para dar testimonio de ti y esperamos y creemos que algo de lo que hablamos en esta noche señor que fue ayuda para alguien que no estuvo aquí alguien necesitaba Escuchar esto seor que tú puedas seguir bendiciendo a esta juventud padre que le puedas bendecir a sus parientes para guiarlos en el camino correcto y te pedimos todas estas cosas el precioso nombre nuestro Señor y Salvador Jesucristo [Aplausos] amill Canes Espíritu Santo es el señor Jesucristo y el señor Jesucristo es tan bueno nosotros que desde el tiempo que que eres un bebé Él está cuidando de ti protegiéndote en tu inocencia en su inocencias cuando no sabes DIF de bueno y malo usted sabe como un bebé va a la mesa y tumba la leche no sabe que es malo pero hay
