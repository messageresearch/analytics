[0:00] Let's
[0:05] pray. Divine Father once again
[0:10] prescious
[0:12] [Music]
[0:25] day
[0:26] [Music]
[0:28] and you give us Lord now
[0:31] thy word to us
[0:35] Lord Jesus. Jesus Christ. Amen.
[0:39] You may be seated, brother. I greet each
[0:41] and every one of you.
[0:43] This morning
[0:45] of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[0:50] all of you.
[0:55] Thank you for your cooperation
[0:58] these days of transition that we have
[1:01] before us. I trust that you will
[1:04] cooperate with us.
[1:06] keeping as still as possible.
[1:08] You all know that God
[1:11] should be given the best
[1:14] and understanding that during this
[1:16] transition
[1:18] we lack room or space. However, God will
[1:22] give us the necessary space.
[1:25] We are finishing up and we are asking
[1:29] you to pray so God helps us with the
[1:30] construction. We would like to welcome
[1:33] brother Thomas Perez this morning
[1:36] along with his wife,
[1:39] his family
[1:40] that have just arrived. Would you stand
[1:43] brother Thomas along with your family
[1:45] with your wife and I believe your
[1:47] children are there in the back. This is
[1:49] brother Thomas. Thank you. Purpose it
[1:52] brings
[1:53] brother Thomas to this place
[1:56] though we have explained it already
[1:59] for the benefit of all. Once again he's
[2:02] coming to help us minister the word
[2:06] and also in whatever is needed he comes
[2:10] to dedicate himself
[2:13] to hold services that we are going to
[2:15] have in England. Therefore,
[2:18] it's going to be a brother that is in
[2:20] charge of the English services which has
[2:22] been something that we have needed for a
[2:25] long time and the people not
[2:28] understanding that
[2:30] doesn't the local assembly but it also
[2:34] covers the Latin people worldwide.
[2:37] I was in a straight a tight place that I
[2:41] was about to leave the work of the Latin
[2:43] people
[2:44] to dedicate myself more in English if
[2:47] brother Thomas wouldn't have come. But
[2:49] he has come.
[2:51] He will be helping us in English so that
[2:54] I can continue in Spanish.
[2:57] Therefore, pray to God for him and also
[3:00] for me and for the brothers that help us
[3:02] here so that the transition can operate
[3:06] in an adequate manner.
[3:08] I'm happy that my father is here with us
[3:11] this morning.
[3:13] It had been a few days since he came
[3:15] last, but we're happy for all of you who
[3:18] are visiting us. Brother Candelio,
[3:21] brother Ree that are visiting from
[3:23] California.
[3:25] Well, uh, they're they are from Phoenix,
[3:28] but they leave during the week. The
[3:30] brothers from Flagstaff.
[3:32] When I see them, it looks like they're
[3:33] visitors, but we're happy that they're
[3:36] with us, each one of you.
[3:39] Can we stand to read the word, brothers?
[3:42] Brother Casada is also in our midst in
[3:44] between these trips from New Mexico and
[3:46] California.
[3:49] We're happy that you are all with us
[3:50] this,
[3:53] brothers. Open your Bibles to Mark 11
[3:56] verse 20 through the 23rd.
[4:00] This is a scripture that we have been
[4:02] reading
[4:03] during these last messages. This is the
[4:05] message number 27 of the series in
[4:08] adoption. It reads as follows. And in
[4:11] the morning as they passed by, they saw
[4:13] the fig tree dried up from the roots.
[4:18] And Peter calling to remembrance saith
[4:21] unto him, Master, behold the fig tree
[4:26] which thou cursest is withered away. And
[4:30] Jesus answering saith unto him, have
[4:33] faith in God to you, that whosoever
[4:37] shall say unto this mountain, Be thou
[4:40] removed, and be thou cast into the sea,
[4:43] and shall not doubt in his heart, but
[4:46] shall believe that those things which he
[4:48] saith shall come to pass, he shall have
[4:51] whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say
[4:54] unto you, what things soever ye desire
[4:58] when you pray, believe that you receive
[5:00] them, and ye shall have them. You may be
[5:02] seated, brothers.
[5:06] We have been, we have stayed for some
[5:08] time now on the thought that uh ye are
[5:11] gods. I believe if I remember correctly
[5:15] that we have around a dozen messages on
[5:17] this thought but we've been but we have
[5:20] begun to turn the corner on this thought
[5:25] that a man completely surrendered to God
[5:30] is omnipotent.
[5:33] We read quite a bit through the
[5:34] scriptures on this thought.
[5:37] Last Sunday, I began to read
[5:41] what brother Brham speaks to us
[5:43] concerning this subject in order to tie
[5:47] or weave the scriptures together and
[5:50] also along with what our prophet has
[5:52] left for us. I sincerely believe that
[5:55] everything the prophet spoke is
[5:57] scriptural
[5:59] and it ties together because a prophet
[6:02] cannot speak different from what another
[6:04] prophet has spoken before him. That's
[6:08] the reason why after taking the
[6:11] scripture we began last Sunday to read
[6:15] on the seals page 66 in Spanish and in
[6:18] English page 82
[6:22] and I didn't finish. I only read five
[6:24] little things that the prophet was
[6:26] telling us there. Therefore this morning
[6:28] I will begin to read of the sixth thing
[6:32] so that we will pick up once again the
[6:35] teaching. A man completely surrendered
[6:38] to God is omnipotent. I would like to
[6:42] say that brother Samuel Estraa, brother
[6:45] Ernesto, brother David
[6:47] Candelario, brother Paul Okampo and each
[6:50] one of you
[6:54] that knows and recognizes how to
[6:56] surrender himself to God becomes
[6:59] omnipotent. Now I know that the prophet
[7:01] left us the example, but the prophet
[7:04] followed the example of Jesus Christ.
[7:06] And Jesus Christ having surrendered as a
[7:09] man displayed the omnipotence that was
[7:13] in him when he stopped the storm. When
[7:18] the Lord Jesus Christ did all these
[7:20] things,
[7:22] he set the example to show that in him
[7:26] was the omnipotence. He manifested that
[7:29] omnipotence
[7:31] through the vessel as a man. And this is
[7:35] where it has been difficult to close
[7:39] that gap
[7:41] by placing a bridge so that the people
[7:44] can understand this. But a prophet came
[7:46] in this 20th century called William
[7:48] Brham. He stood in the gap and preached
[7:53] a message entitled standing in the gap.
[7:56] and the gap was made. Now the prophet
[8:00] being there standing in that place, he
[8:03] also stopped the storm. When he was in
[8:06] Colorado, the Lord told him, "Speak the
[8:09] word." And the storm abaded. On other
[8:12] occasions, he created squirrels. He
[8:14] spoke the word. He spoke the word and
[8:16] squirrels came into existence.
[8:18] And so many other things that were the
[8:21] five identifications of that third pool
[8:24] which the prophet did. And we believe
[8:27] them. Is that right brothers? But the
[8:30] difficulty is to bring it down to the
[8:32] people so they can understand that we
[8:36] also should follow the same footprints
[8:38] and then we become omnipotent. But it
[8:41] has to be a man that is completely
[8:43] surrendered to God. When he is uh
[8:47] totally surrendered to God, he becomes
[8:49] as Paul said a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[8:52] It is no longer the mind of so and so or
[8:55] so and so but rather it is the mind of
[8:57] Christ in the man speaking the words of
[8:59] God inspired by the Holy Spirit and God
[9:03] has to back that man's word because his
[9:07] word he backs up his word. The prophet
[9:10] says that uh that a man is as good as
[9:14] good as he keeps or fulfills his
[9:16] promise. If a man gives a promise,
[9:21] that man should keep or fulfill his
[9:22] promise. And if that man does not keep
[9:24] his word, then that man is worthless.
[9:28] The Bible says that let God be true, but
[9:30] every man a liar. Therefore, when God
[9:34] speaks a word, he keeps that word. And
[9:38] when a man is completely surrendered to
[9:40] God, what else can he speak but the word
[9:43] of God? Then God backs up that word.
[9:47] But there are processes.
[9:50] There are requirements
[9:53] requirements
[9:55] that are needed to be able to become
[9:57] omnipotent
[9:59] or to be completely surrendered to God.
[10:03] And that's what we are speaking on. I'm
[10:06] going to begin to read page 66 of the
[10:08] seals in Spanish. In English, it's page
[10:11] 82 and 83. It's on the breach.
[10:15] Brother Brandham says, "Now when Adam
[10:17] sinned
[10:20] by heeding his wife's reasoning instead
[10:23] of holding to God's word, that's what
[10:26] made Adam sin. His wife reasoned with
[10:30] Satan and then produced the product to
[10:33] Adam and Adam turned loose the word and
[10:38] sold out." What a tremendous thing,
[10:41] right? He put himself for sale. Said,
[10:43] "I'm for sale. I'm offering myself that
[10:46] is if I understand Spanish correctly
[10:48] right in English said it says sold
[10:50] himself out therefore what are you
[10:52] selling brothers beans soup clothing car
[10:56] what are you selling uh I'm selling
[10:59] myself brother Adam you see when a man
[11:03] turns himself loose of the word what he
[11:05] is doing is he's selling himself out and
[11:07] he's telling him Satan come and buy me
[11:09] I'm right here you see the man surreners
[11:12] himself
[11:15] The prophet says that Adam sold himself.
[11:18] No one sold him. He himself sold
[11:20] himself. You see, brother Brandham
[11:21] continues, he lost also his inheritance
[11:24] when he lost his fellowship. Do you
[11:26] remember some time ago when I mentioned
[11:27] that little thing and some of you choked
[11:29] when I mentioned it?
[11:32] Because isn't it true that the people on
[11:36] certain occasions they don't notice when
[11:38] I mentioned that the inheritance was not
[11:41] left to us by Jesus Christ. And when I
[11:43] said this, it seemed like some of you
[11:45] choked. The inheritance was left to us
[11:48] by God. Now Jesus Christ came to pay the
[11:51] price for that inheritance because the
[11:53] Bible speaks that we are co-airs with
[11:55] Christ Jesus. And how can we be co-airs
[12:00] with God being that God is above all
[12:03] things. Therefore, we should understand
[12:05] deity and how it comes descending. Now
[12:10] when Adam did this, he sold himself out.
[12:14] He lost his inheritance. The inheritance
[12:17] that God had given him. Jesus Christ in
[12:21] flesh had not come yet. But God is the
[12:26] self-existing one. Therefore, God had
[12:30] given an inheritance to man. And what
[12:32] was it that he had given him? He had
[12:35] given him the earth. He told him, "Look,
[12:38] I have created you in my image. You are
[12:40] so much like me that I want to share
[12:44] with you,
[12:45] and I'm going to leave this to you. This
[12:48] is your inheritance. But you need to
[12:52] walk in fellowship with me. And in order
[12:55] to be able to walk in fellowship with
[12:57] me, you need to follow my word." Because
[13:00] we cannot have fellowship with God
[13:02] except
[13:04] through his word.
[13:07] When we stop being led or guided by the
[13:10] word of God, that is where we lose our
[13:13] fellowship. You see, if you, my brother,
[13:16] want to have fellowship with me
[13:19] around the word, it can only be around
[13:22] that which has been written, around that
[13:25] which the prophet has brought us. That
[13:28] is then that true fellowship. Now I can
[13:31] have fellowship with brother Jimmy as a
[13:32] friend
[13:34] at our place of employment in whatever
[13:37] profession we have or in family matters.
[13:40] But in order for that fellowship
[13:42] to be an eternal fellowship or an
[13:46] intimate dear deep fellowship, it must
[13:49] be with God being inviting God as our
[13:52] companion.
[13:54] And let it be a union of oneness and
[13:56] that can only happen following the word
[13:59] of God. Now notice what the prophet
[14:01] says. He lost also his inheritance when
[14:04] he lost his fellowship.
[14:07] A man when he loses his inheritance, he
[14:11] loses it when he loses his fellowship.
[14:14] Therefore, I can understand by this that
[14:16] if in us there is no omnipotence, it's
[14:19] because there is no fellowship,
[14:22] no intimate fellowship with God, we are
[14:24] missing something somewhere. You see, so
[14:26] that you may understand me a little
[14:28] easier, let's say that perhaps a woman
[14:30] cuts her hair. Then when she asks God,
[14:33] "My God, my God, hear me. Look upon me,
[14:36] oh God. How can she want or expect to
[14:38] have fellowship with God when she has no
[14:40] fellowship? She loses in her her
[14:42] inheritance. How can she receive or
[14:44] obtain these things if she is not
[14:46] obeying the word? You see, therefore,
[14:50] in order to have the inheritance, we
[14:52] need to have fellowship. We need to
[14:54] follow the word. Whatever God says,
[14:57] that's what's right.
[15:01] The prophet teaches us that we need to
[15:03] go back to the place where we left Jesus
[15:07] and Jesus he is the word when we leave
[15:11] Jesus or when we stop obeying the word
[15:14] that's where fellowship is broken or
[15:16] torn there is no longer any fellowship
[15:19] and the only way is that you as an
[15:21] individual must return go back to where
[15:25] you left Jesus and once again be with
[15:28] him and give him your hands so that he
[15:30] be the one that guides you when you are
[15:32] in fellowship with him he's taking you
[15:34] by the hand and in taking you by the
[15:36] hand in perfect fellowship with him.
[15:39] Whatsoever ye shall ask him, he shall
[15:42] answer you.
[15:44] As soon as you stop walking
[15:48] according to the word, fellowship is
[15:50] lost. Once fellowship is lost, your
[15:54] inheritance is lost. You can scream, you
[15:56] can cry, you can pray, you can ask and
[15:59] there is no answer. Nothing. There is no
[16:02] answer. Therefore, when there is no
[16:04] answer to our petition or to our prayer,
[16:08] we should stop. We should begin to
[16:10] examine ourselves to see where did I
[16:14] fail you, Lord? Where have I left you?
[16:16] Where did I leave you? Because if we are
[16:19] in perfect fellowship with God, he
[16:22] answers our petitions.
[16:25] This also includes the woman, okay? Not
[16:28] just man. I will continue reading. He
[16:31] lost also his inheritance when he lost
[16:33] his fellowship
[16:36] and right to eternal life. Remember
[16:39] what God told him. The day you eat
[16:42] thereof,
[16:43] that day you die. And when he lost his
[16:46] life, he also lost his inheritance in
[16:51] life because he had completely supreme
[16:54] control of the earth. He was a god
[16:59] of the earth. How difficult, right? What
[17:02] a tremendous thing. Correct. Do you
[17:05] believe that a man can go in the rapture
[17:07] without having complete and supreme
[17:11] control of the earth? The Bible says
[17:13] that he can't. Therefore, we need to be
[17:16] trained, right? We need to train
[17:18] ourselves. We need to go and examine,
[17:22] check our lives because a time is coming
[17:24] in which we need to have complete and
[17:26] supreme control of the earth. The man
[17:29] was the god of the earth. I want you to
[17:32] notice it's the man. Isn't it true that
[17:35] we have explained clearly that it's not
[17:37] only the prophet
[17:40] that does this because that is where we
[17:42] struggle in rightly dividing the word
[17:43] and the people want to put the prophet
[17:45] way over there in a separate place and
[17:47] place you far away from him. You brother
[17:50] Leva need to be God. You need to be a
[17:53] man completely surrendered to God. And
[17:57] when you achieve that then you are a God
[18:01] of the earth. That is the that is the
[18:04] reason why brother Romero in his way of
[18:06] explaining things uh brother Favila
[18:08] perhaps didn't understand him too well
[18:11] or perhaps he just didn't understand him
[18:14] when brother Favila was mentioning
[18:15] something to him and brother Romero told
[18:17] him said look brother Favila you see all
[18:20] of that all of that belongs to us all of
[18:24] this is mine the only thing is that I
[18:26] have to wait my time a little while
[18:28] longer
[18:30] they thought it was a little humorous
[18:31] This is something to laugh at, right?
[18:33] Somewhat of a joke, but brother Romero
[18:35] was saying it because he had heard the
[18:37] prophet mention it and he believed it.
[18:40] You see, you should believe the word.
[18:43] When we begin to speak of these things,
[18:44] you should receive them and believe them
[18:47] and begin because faith cometh by
[18:50] hearing and hearing of the word of God.
[18:53] Now, as you hear the word, you begin to
[18:55] believe it and that begins to form
[18:58] within you the necessary strength to be
[19:02] able to overcome the evil one for he is
[19:04] overcome by the word. Then Satan comes
[19:07] and tells you, "No, look, uh, you have
[19:09] no power. You don't have anything.
[19:11] You're just a sinner." That's right. We
[19:15] are sinners. Isn't that right? We are
[19:18] all born in sin. But the blood of Jesus
[19:20] Christ came to intercede for us. There
[19:24] are people upon which Satan climbs on
[19:26] their shoulder and he tells them, "Look,
[19:28] you don't have anything, man. Who do you
[19:30] think you are? And they answer him, "Oh,
[19:32] that's right, Satan. That's true. I I'm
[19:34] a nobody, but do what the prophet did."
[19:38] Satan told him, "William Brandham, you
[19:41] have nothing." The prophet answered,
[19:43] "Well, stay right here with me. Don't
[19:46] leave. Stay right here." Notice now look
[19:49] what he told him. Now, don't leave so
[19:52] that you can hear me glorify God.
[19:55] You see, as soon as he began to glorify
[19:58] God, Satan began to run. For Satan
[20:00] cannot stand when you glorify God. But
[20:04] you, you stay mute, silent, you just
[20:06] stay there listening. You see, you stay
[20:08] right there. And that's the same thing
[20:09] Eve did. She began to reason when Satan
[20:11] told her, "Look at this." The woman
[20:13] answered, "Wow, let's see. Tell me more.
[20:16] That's exactly what we are doing when
[20:17] Satan tells us. You people are nothing.
[20:20] Wow. Look here, Satan. Tell me more." It
[20:23] seems like we almost pat him on the
[20:24] back. But tell him, "Satan, I might be a
[20:27] nobody, but stay right here and watch me
[20:29] glorify the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:30] Christ, who paid the price for my
[20:33] redemption,
[20:35] and being redeemed, I have surrendered
[20:37] to God, and I have power
[20:41] even over you." The Bible states, isn't
[20:44] it true that the Bible says they shall
[20:45] cast out devils? That's the reason why
[20:47] many people no longer want to cast out
[20:49] devils
[20:51] because what happened to them back there
[20:53] happens to them, right? Uh Paul we know
[20:57] and Jesus we know. But you who are you?
[21:01] There you are one day with the
[21:02] cigarette. The next day with your tongue
[21:04] wagging. The next day you're all greedy
[21:07] and stingy. The following day you're a
[21:09] liar and the next moment saying in the
[21:11] name of Jesus Christ, come out demon.
[21:13] Well Jesus we know. But who are you?
[21:16] But God, but man was the God of the
[21:19] earth. Do you believe it, brothers?
[21:21] The prophet says,
[21:22] "God is the God of the universe
[21:26] everywhere and of everything." Aha, this
[21:30] is so tremendous. Therefore, God is also
[21:32] God of the earth. Is that right,
[21:34] brothers? Well, now, how can it be that
[21:37] the prophet says that man is the God of
[21:40] the earth? Are there two gods? Now
[21:42] notice, God made the heavens and the
[21:46] earth, the supreme God. Then once he had
[21:49] put man here, he gave him an
[21:51] inheritance. He says, "I'm leaving this
[21:53] to you, my dear son, as long as you are
[21:56] obedient." When the man isn't obedient,
[21:58] when the son is not obedient, how is it
[22:00] that you want to own the things of your
[22:01] father? Is that right? There are many
[22:03] children that are so disobedient, but
[22:06] when it comes to claim rights, they want
[22:08] all the rights. Look, father, look at
[22:10] Jimmy. He gets to drive his car. He has
[22:13] his own car. He can go to Flagstaff to
[22:15] work. Father answers, "Well, behave like
[22:18] Jimmy and you shall have the same rights
[22:20] as Jimmy." Are you understanding me,
[22:21] brothers? A wise son
[22:25] maketh a glad father, but a foolish son
[22:28] is the heaviness of his mother. You see?
[22:31] Now, therefore, there must be obedience
[22:35] in the earthly children.
[22:38] For if they are not obedient in earthly
[22:40] things, how can they be obedient in the
[22:42] spiritual things?
[22:44] Oh, I want I want for God to bless me.
[22:47] At the same time, I turn to my father.
[22:49] Huh? Who's this old man? Then I go with
[22:51] my heavenly father and say, "Father,
[22:53] help me, heavenly father." Heavenly
[22:55] father answers, "Huh? If you can't even
[22:57] respect your earthly father, how is it
[22:59] that you want heavenly things?" I look
[23:00] at my mother. Huh? Ah, she's just an old
[23:02] lady. She She's nurtured me for years,
[23:04] and what can she give me now? Anyways, I
[23:07] already have my wife and she's much
[23:09] younger. You see her and you run over
[23:11] her. Then I go with my heavenly father.
[23:13] Father, help me. The Bible says, "Honor
[23:15] thy father and thy mother that thy days
[23:18] may be long upon the land." Now, we're
[23:20] speaking of earthly fathers, brothers.
[23:22] You see, we need to understand the Lord
[23:24] Jesus Christ said, "For he that loveth
[23:28] not his brother whom he has seen, how
[23:30] can he love God whom he has not seen?"
[23:33] If you can't be obedient to your father
[23:35] and to your mother that are on earth,
[23:38] how can you be obedient to our heavenly
[23:41] father? Now a man completely surrendered
[23:44] to God is omnipotent.
[23:48] These are just in the little things
[23:49] brothers. It's very sad and pitiful
[23:52] right to see the day we are living in
[23:56] William Brham came to return us. Did
[23:59] William Brandham come to return us to
[24:00] the original faith brothers? I remember
[24:03] I remember when I would come to service,
[24:05] I was tremendous. I was terrible. I
[24:07] believe there's no one as terrible as I
[24:08] was. I'd sit there with my mother's side
[24:11] and she I look like an angel, but I was
[24:14] a devil. But sitting there with her, I
[24:16] was an angel. My father would call me.
[24:19] He'd say, "Bernie, yes, sir." My mother
[24:22] would tell me something. Yes, ma'am. But
[24:24] today, daughter, what
[24:27] son? Hey, don't yell at me. Don't even
[24:30] talk to me. and we claim that he came to
[24:33] restore us. Imagine if he hadn't
[24:35] restored us and then we want God's
[24:37] blessings. There are occasions that we
[24:39] go to a house and it seems like we're in
[24:41] Africa. You got one kid jumping up and
[24:44] down, another one screaming over there.
[24:45] The only thing it seems like we're
[24:46] missing is the music. Oh, but the music,
[24:50] the children make the music. Oh, there's
[24:51] no respect. And then we want to come and
[24:54] say, "Oh, I like to hear the prophet.
[24:56] What are you listening to him for?" Make
[24:58] your heart right first.
[25:01] It says that the judgment must begin at
[25:03] the house of God. Is that right? Begin
[25:05] at the house of God and at our local
[25:07] house also. You see last night or on
[25:10] Friday when brother Ernie sang
[25:14] don't forget the family prayer
[25:20] or at home the family praying. You see,
[25:22] that is what we need, brothers, that the
[25:24] children, even those that are grown,
[25:26] like Pamela, like like Joanna, Jimmy,
[25:28] Jonathan, Marcus, Joel, may they have a
[25:32] little bit of respect towards their
[25:34] parents. For it matters not what they
[25:36] are. If father were to be in prison, he
[25:40] is still your father. And the Bible
[25:43] states, honor your father and your
[25:44] mother. You see, do you understand?
[25:47] These little things are the ones that
[25:48] are helping us to grow. It's not the big
[25:50] things that help us grow or climb up.
[25:51] It's the little things you see restore a
[25:55] total restoration. Now, God,
[25:58] he is the God of the universe. He made
[26:00] the earth. He is the God of the earth.
[26:02] He's the God of everything. But once he
[26:04] had seen that his son was very obedient,
[26:06] he told him, "Adam, take this. This is
[26:09] your inheritance. This belongs to you.
[26:12] You can sign your check whenever you
[26:14] want." And Adam would sign his check.
[26:17] What did Adam sign? Let this mountain be
[26:19] moved to the east.
[26:22] It was in the west. Be thou moved to the
[26:24] east. The mountain would move. How
[26:27] tremendous, right?
[26:29] He saw a tree around there, a tree that
[26:31] uh he wasn't really pleased with. He
[26:33] said, I'm no longer pleased with where
[26:34] that tree is at. He said, I want it
[26:36] placed right here in front of me where I
[26:38] lay every day. Tree move. The tree would
[26:42] move. And there the man was really
[26:44] happy. He would stay contemplating what
[26:48] a tremendous thing. What an inheritance
[26:50] my father has left me. He left it to me.
[26:52] It's mine. No one can take it from me.
[26:55] But when his woman
[26:57] reasoned with Satan and was seduced, she
[27:01] then came and presented the product to
[27:02] Adam. Adam said, "If I don't take her
[27:05] with me, I will no longer be able to
[27:08] live with her. I have to rescue her." He
[27:10] said, "How can I do this?" Satan told
[27:11] him, "Sell out. Sell yourself out." He
[27:15] sold himself out. And since then, Satan
[27:18] is the god of this earth. Amen,
[27:21] brothers.
[27:23] But there's a little thing around there
[27:25] that if God will help me, I want to
[27:26] reach it. Satan, he is the God of the
[27:29] earth. But you know, some little thing
[27:31] that uh we have forgotten
[27:34] is that when God gave man
[27:39] the earth, he gave him an inheritance.
[27:41] He signed a paper and said, "I
[27:45] Elohim, the supreme God that has created
[27:49] the heavens and the earth, do hereby
[27:51] sign this document stating that I'm
[27:54] giving my son the earth." And he signed
[27:58] it. Take this, my son. Take the title
[28:00] deed that you may be able to prove that
[28:02] you are a god. Now, but when Satan came,
[28:06] he made a deal with Adam
[28:08] because a deal was made. The first
[28:10] businessman was Satan and he's
[28:12] tremendous at negotiating. Is that
[28:14] right? Therefore, he began to negotiate
[28:16] with him and he told him, he told him,
[28:18] "As soon as you give me the earth, you
[28:20] have to surrender the title deed to me
[28:22] also." Adam answered, "I'm selling out.
[28:24] I'm forfeiting everything." The prophet
[28:27] said that Adam forfeited.
[28:29] Therefore, once man had sold himself
[28:33] out, he surrendered the title deed. And
[28:35] there was Satan's filthy, dirty hands
[28:37] ready to take the title deed.
[28:40] But since his hands were filthy, the
[28:42] title deed could not stay in the filthy
[28:44] hands of Satan. That document just
[28:47] slipped right off. It just slipped off
[28:49] his hands and it went directly back to
[28:51] the original owner
[28:54] because it was an inheritance that I had
[28:56] left to my son. Therefore, Satan can
[28:59] scream and shout. He can bluff his way.
[29:02] He can do whatever it is that he wants
[29:04] to do. And he tells me, "Hey, Adam sold
[29:08] this to me, this earth is mine, and he
[29:12] is the God of this 20th century. He has
[29:14] even sat in the temple passing himself
[29:16] off, pretending to be God." And he
[29:19] shouts it at me and he preaches it to me
[29:22] with a Bible under his hand
[29:25] and he tells me, "You have absolutely no
[29:27] rights." And I answer him, "Show me,
[29:30] Satan. Show me the title deed. You don't
[29:33] have the title deed. that title deed
[29:35] returned back to its original owner
[29:40] and on that basis is why I don't fear
[29:44] Satan for what does it profit what does
[29:46] it profit if brother Pantoa is living in
[29:49] my house and he tells me brother Garcia
[29:52] now try to kick me out you can't evict
[29:54] me but there amongst his things my
[29:57] father has the title deed of the house
[29:59] and he tells me don't worry Bernabby I
[30:01] have the title deed so then I tell the
[30:03] brother Brother Pantoa, you will vacate
[30:05] my house now or I'm going to call my
[30:08] agent, the Holy Spirit. He is the agent.
[30:11] He's the one that authorizes the claim.
[30:13] I'm going to call him. Well, I'm not
[30:15] giving you anything. You see, this is
[30:17] what happens on many occasions. We don't
[30:19] file our claim.
[30:22] We don't take our position
[30:25] because the title deed is not in the
[30:28] hands of brother Pantoa. The title deed
[30:30] is in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
[30:35] So then I tell him, "Well, brother, you
[30:37] don't want to listen." Referring to the
[30:39] earthly things. Soon someone knocks at
[30:41] the door.
[30:43] This is a court-ordered eviction notice.
[30:45] Leave this house now. No, he says, "No,
[30:47] I I won't do it."
[30:49] He barricades himself in and pulls out a
[30:51] shotgun. Well, even if he pulls out a
[30:53] shotgun, in a few minutes, 20 or 30
[30:55] police officers arrive along with guards
[30:57] with the army.
[30:59] And if he still won't come out, they
[31:01] launch some tear gas grenades. Pretty
[31:03] soon, here he comes coughing. That's
[31:07] right. Get out of here because this is
[31:09] my house. And that's what we need to do,
[31:11] brothers. We need to file our claim and
[31:13] enforce it. Satan has to come out. He
[31:15] has no right of possession over those
[31:18] things that belong to us. Yes, he takes
[31:20] possession like a big bluffer, and he's
[31:22] a number one bluffer, for there is no
[31:23] greater bluffer than Satan. But the
[31:25] blood of Jesus Christ paid the price so
[31:29] that we
[31:31] as his children can take our position.
[31:34] The only thing that William Brandham
[31:35] did, he's our advocate in this 20th
[31:37] century. It sounds kind of bad, right?
[31:41] It is Jesus Christ, our God who is our
[31:43] attorney. But Jesus Christ showed the
[31:46] prophet. I'm going to prove it further
[31:48] up ahead. I'm going to prove it. My
[31:49] time's running out. I'm going to prove
[31:50] where no one could take the book. No one
[31:53] except Jesus Christ the lamb. Therefore,
[31:57] he the lamb took the book, the title
[32:00] deed book of property, the title deed,
[32:04] and he took the title deed. And when he
[32:06] took it, he opened it and he handed it,
[32:10] gave it to the seventh angel, saying,
[32:11] "Seventh angel, William Brandham, here's
[32:13] the title deed." When William Brandon
[32:15] began to examine the title deed, he
[32:17] said, "Glory to God, it's ours. Oh,
[32:20] Satan, you bluffer. Where will you end
[32:22] up? Nothing here belongs to you. Look
[32:26] from the first seal until the last seal.
[32:27] He said this belongs to the people of
[32:30] the Lord. The Bible in the message say
[32:32] that
[32:34] an abstract deed means that ownership
[32:37] has gone or been tra traced back all the
[32:39] way back to the beginning. So he went
[32:41] looking for the original owner. You know
[32:44] that when he when a title deed has gone
[32:47] through the abstract process, it means
[32:48] that there are no leans, no incumbrances
[32:50] or debts against that property. For even
[32:53] though you have the title deed, if
[32:54] there's a debt against it, you cannot
[32:56] receive a clean title deed because
[32:59] there's a debt or lean against it. And
[33:01] there was a tremendous debt full of sins
[33:03] of worldliness of unbelief.
[33:06] But then when that seventh angel was
[33:09] given that title deed, he could see that
[33:14] everything was clean and there was no
[33:16] debts against it. Why? That's the reason
[33:18] why the Bible states that there was a
[33:21] cry made, who is worthy? Even John began
[33:24] to weep for no one had been found worthy
[33:28] because there was a lean or a debt
[33:30] against that title.
[33:32] There was a spot against that title.
[33:36] But when he began to weep,
[33:40] it was told unto John, "Look, John, weep
[33:43] not. The lion of the tribe of Judah has
[33:45] prevailed and overcome." But when he
[33:48] turned to see, he saw a lamb that came.
[33:50] A lamb came and took the book, saying,
[33:53] "Everything that was against this
[33:54] property, I have paid the price. My
[33:57] blood was shed
[33:59] over 2,000 years ago. I went to Calvary.
[34:03] I purchased what man had sold. What Adam
[34:08] had forfeited,
[34:10] Adam surrendered it. But when Adam gave
[34:13] it up, the title returned back to its
[34:15] original owner, back to the father, back
[34:18] to the spirit. Therefore, it is he that
[34:21] has been sitting on the throne since
[34:23] then because he has the title. But then
[34:26] who's going to redeem it? That's when
[34:28] that bloody lamb as it had been slain
[34:31] said, I have paid the price, give me the
[34:34] title. The title is clean. There are no
[34:38] spots against that title. There are no
[34:40] debts or leans against that title. And
[34:43] not not only has the title been
[34:44] redeemed, but the time has come to claim
[34:47] the possession of the children of God.
[34:50] And I have to deliver this clean title
[34:53] deed to a man on earth. William Brham,
[34:56] come here. He raises William Brham in
[34:59] the midst of seven angels
[35:02] and he hands him the title deed. Preach
[35:04] the word. Instruct the people. Show
[35:07] teach them what belongs to them that
[35:09] they may be able to begin to claim what
[35:11] rightfully belongs to them. Oh people of
[35:13] the living God, believers of the evening
[35:16] time message, it is time for you to rise
[35:19] up with faith, believing and lifting up
[35:22] the standard of where God has raised us
[35:25] up to. Claiming that which is ours, not
[35:29] allowing Satan to bluff us. Claim what
[35:33] rightfully belongs to you. I'm going to
[35:35] continue reading later on. I'll prove
[35:37] it. I'll prove these things that I'm
[35:38] saying. The prophet says,
[35:42] "But his son had this earth under his
[35:45] own control. He could speak.
[35:49] He could name. He could say, he could
[35:52] stop nature. He could do anything he
[35:54] wanted to see. But when he did that, he
[35:58] lost his inheritance."
[36:01] Do you know what has begun to happen? It
[36:04] began some time ago in changing the
[36:08] temperature worldwide began to change
[36:11] global warming. Many people do not
[36:13] understand that it was by the word of a
[36:16] prophet. You see people get all shook up
[36:18] and say for example uh they ask why is
[36:21] California all flooded?
[36:24] I would tell you one thing I'd say that
[36:27] if someone uh wants to go to California,
[36:30] they better think about it twice. They
[36:33] better be sure that it is God that is
[36:34] sending you there. Since 1963 or 64, the
[36:38] prophet took a rock and tossed it up in
[36:40] the air. When he did that, there were
[36:43] three ter terrific blasts and the
[36:46] prophet said, "Judgment is striking the
[36:49] west coast on the Pacific." The prophet
[36:52] said the dragon only moved his tail a
[36:56] little bit. He did not move his head.
[36:58] The head stayed quiet. Just his tail
[37:01] moved. He said, "And Alaska almost
[37:04] sunk." When he tossed that little rock
[37:07] into the air, it brought forth a
[37:10] whirlwind. Look, brothers, did you know,
[37:12] I don't know what they call it in
[37:14] Spanish or in English, but you read that
[37:16] the winds were going about 60 miles an
[37:19] hour in Los Angeles, and in certain
[37:20] places they reached 90 miles an hour.
[37:23] And along with the rain, they say that
[37:24] the rain caused more damage than the
[37:27] damage it would have been that would
[37:29] have been caused by an earthquake of 7
[37:31] plus on the RTOR scale because he caused
[37:33] and he made it almost like a whirlwind.
[37:35] When he tossed the rock into the air,
[37:36] here comes a whirlwind and it tore off
[37:38] the rocks from the tops of the
[37:40] mountains. You see, it is the word of a
[37:42] little man. But that's the way man was.
[37:45] He had power over nature. He tossed that
[37:48] rock into the air. For there must always
[37:50] be a symbol to show what is coming. And
[37:54] he's showing us, brothers, that this man
[37:58] even had control over nature.
[38:01] The prophet says he could speak, he
[38:05] could name, he could say, he could stop
[38:07] nature, he could do anything he wanted
[38:09] to. See, but when he did that, he lost
[38:12] his inter his inheritance.
[38:14] Now, Adam could say, "Let this mountain
[38:17] here be moved over there," and it would
[38:19] do it.
[38:21] Adam could say, "Let this tree here be
[38:24] plucked up and planted over there." It
[38:26] would do it. For he had complete supreme
[38:29] control
[38:30] as a minor god under God
[38:35] our father because he was a son of God.
[38:38] I only want to bring a small thing to
[38:39] finish up. What does the word redeem
[38:41] mean? To buy back that which was sold.
[38:43] Is that right? So to buy in buying back
[38:47] man through his blood man can be
[38:50] restored to his original condition. Is
[38:52] that right? And the higher the highest
[38:55] thing that a man can do you and I is to
[38:57] be a minor god
[39:00] under God our father. You see what
[39:04] happens with many is that they have a
[39:06] fear to claim their place and others are
[39:08] trying to go above a little higher than
[39:10] what they should. For example, sister uh
[39:13] uh sister Oralia's neighbor, she ponded
[39:16] uh a 21 jewel watch and then uh when she
[39:21] goes to redeem it what she had pawned,
[39:24] she goes and she pays her $30 and then
[39:26] they give her the watch and then she
[39:30] picks up a purse, a a bracelet. Uh well,
[39:34] I I already got what I pawned. No,
[39:35] they'll take her to jail because she
[39:36] can't take the the the the the bracelet
[39:39] because she had only pawned a watch. So
[39:41] when you try to go up higher than what
[39:44] God has received you, you are entering
[39:48] into territory that even angels fear to
[39:50] tread because we can't be higher than
[39:53] the God, the supreme God, the God our
[39:57] father. But we but we do have the right
[40:00] to claim our position
[40:02] and get to be as a minor god under God
[40:05] our father. The prophet says because he
[40:09] was a son of God.
[40:12] [Music]
[40:13] Wouldn't it be possible just to stop
[40:15] here and preach a tremendous message and
[40:16] now the blood has cleansed us and has
[40:20] redeemed us again. What about today? Has
[40:22] the blood redeemed us? Has it cleansed
[40:24] us?
[40:25] Very well. Notice
[40:28] because notice what the son of God did,
[40:30] the second Adam did. I'm going to read
[40:32] it again. Notice now, brother Adam.
[40:35] Look, look at what the son of God, the
[40:38] second Adam did, and said, "The works
[40:40] that I do shall you also do." See, Adam
[40:47] lost his inheritance, the earth. Now it
[40:49] passed from his hand to the one he sold
[40:52] out to, Satan. The inheritance
[40:58] went to Satan's hands. But the title did
[41:01] not stay with Satan. It went directly
[41:04] back to God because he came and he put a
[41:09] substitute for us shedding his blood. If
[41:14] you and I brothers could understand just
[41:16] this little thing, brothers, we could
[41:18] stay there before God so that his word
[41:21] would wash us, would cleanse us of all
[41:23] spots of all unbelief, so that we could
[41:26] believe the word and begin to claim that
[41:29] which belongs to us. If brother
[41:31] Candelario could receive this, an
[41:33] example, if brother Joseco could receive
[41:36] this, he would go with God and he'd say,
[41:39] "Lord, you
[41:42] already have paid the price. I'm here
[41:45] and I'm serving you now. God, Lord, help
[41:47] me to have the faith to claim all of
[41:50] those that are in my family. begin to
[41:52] pray and begin to pray and begin to pray
[41:54] and begin to live the life and begin to
[41:57] live all of the word that has come out
[41:59] of the mouth of God. Pray, believe,
[42:01] pray, pray, pray, pray, pray. You
[42:04] couldn't help it. One of the two either
[42:06] they would come in or they would leave
[42:07] you all alone because they would not be
[42:09] able to take that spiritual atmosphere.
[42:12] You see, because a devil cannot be where
[42:16] there is a son of God, brothers. But if
[42:18] the son of God needs to begin to claim,
[42:21] he needs to believe, brothers. That's
[42:23] what we need. It's to believe and begin
[42:26] to claim our families, our wives, our
[42:29] husbands, our children. We must begin to
[42:31] pray and believe and create a spiritual
[42:34] atmosphere. The devil will have to come
[42:36] out of there
[42:39] and leave and let the children of God to
[42:42] be loosed, free, delivered, surrendered
[42:44] to God, and then we shall have victory
[42:47] because we are gods, minor gods under
[42:50] God our father. I'm going to pray.
[42:53] Divine Father, I thank you
[42:56] for these few words that you've allowed
[42:59] Lord to express
[43:03] to put Lord that second link,
[43:08] that second step
[43:12] for the place that we want to reach.
[43:14] Father, when I see this in your word,
[43:18] it makes me think and to tremble
[43:22] into seeing how far your people
[43:28] go from that which belongs to them.
[43:31] Lord,
[43:33] if we can't show anything else but these
[43:35] little things so that your people can
[43:38] return, Lord,
[43:40] to their place, not only to return, but
[43:44] that they would begin to claim what
[43:47] belongs to them. I remember what your
[43:49] prophet has told us when he explained
[43:50] the scripture. Adam lost the
[43:54] inheritance, then went to the hands of
[43:57] Satan, and he has enjoyed and exploited
[44:00] the earth. He's even sat as god of this
[44:03] 20th century. But the title did return
[44:07] to you, oh father, who are a spirit. But
[44:11] one day you came from your throne, your
[44:14] sublime throne of glory, and you took
[44:17] our likeness to be able to live like
[44:21] man, suffer like man, get tired like
[44:24] man, Lord. And even our prophet teaches
[44:28] us that You even suffered
[44:33] sickness as man, headaches.
[44:37] You attempted as a man.
[44:41] But even then, you were being in the
[44:44] form of man, thought it not robbery to
[44:47] be equal with God. Instead, you stripped
[44:49] yourself and were obedient
[44:52] to be able to purchase
[44:54] back for man the position that he was
[44:57] once in. Lord, one day on the cross you
[45:01] cried out, "It is finished." Lord, the
[45:05] stinger was stung into you by Satan, but
[45:08] you went to the lowest parts of the
[45:10] earth. For three days, you traveled
[45:14] there in your theophony while your body
[45:18] which had the sting in them in him was
[45:22] in the grave. You went down. You took
[45:24] the keys from the devil and you told
[45:26] him,
[45:30] "There is now an abstract deed. I have
[45:33] paid the price. Give me the keys." You
[45:36] passed through paradise to show us the
[45:38] first fruits. You took out those
[45:41] patriarchs, patriarchs that were waiting
[45:43] on you. And they presented themselves
[45:45] alive for around 40 days to many of the
[45:48] Old Testament saints. Then the heavens
[45:50] of the doors and the doors of the heaven
[45:53] were opened and you went in as king of
[45:56] the glory. You left there your body at
[46:00] the altar and then you sent your holy
[46:02] spirit.
[46:04] It parted Lord as tongues, cloven
[46:08] tongues of fire that sat upon each and
[46:11] every one of those that were waiting
[46:12] there in that upper room. And then you
[46:15] came working in that manner through
[46:17] seven ages. But in this 20th century in
[46:21] a unity, in a union, in a oneness, you
[46:24] rested upon the little crib of a man. At
[46:27] the same time, when the church
[46:31] was born under the birth of Pentecost,
[46:34] the man was also born upon which you
[46:37] would reveal yourself as the son of man.
[46:40] The church began to grow
[46:43] and your prophet also began to grow
[46:46] until the time came when he came out.
[46:50] And one day on Mount Sunset,
[46:54] you came down from on high. You lifted
[46:57] this man up and you gave him the title
[47:02] deed. Oh Christ, the prophet William
[47:05] Brham has showed us this title. Even
[47:09] science has photographed the face of
[47:12] Jesus Christ. There's nothing that can
[47:15] hold your people. If they could only
[47:16] receive this revelation,
[47:20] the lamb opened up the seals. He brought
[47:24] it through William Brham and William
[47:26] Brham has explained it to us and has
[47:28] explained to us what belongs to us. you
[47:31] using him as a great advocate in this
[47:33] time. And he has showed us that anything
[47:37] whatsoever
[47:39] that we have lost
[47:42] even as that ve even as that car that
[47:44] that son of yours was stolen from the
[47:47] prophet knelt down and he sent the agent
[47:51] the Holy Spirit so that that vehicle
[47:54] would return.
[47:55] Oh father,
[47:57] help us apply the blood to our house and
[48:03] that the agent, the Holy Spirit, come
[48:05] out after those children of your
[48:09] children that are wavered.
[48:13] Oh lamb of God
[48:15] that takes and erases the sins of the
[48:19] world. Give us the revelation. Give us
[48:22] the faith the faith of this Lord so that
[48:25] no devil can come and stand against any
[48:28] of your children. It is not by our
[48:31] merits. It is not by our lives.
[48:35] But it's because of your life and by
[48:38] your merits. If there's someone here
[48:40] this morning that is found bound, Lord,
[48:45] loosen him at this moment in the name of
[48:48] Jesus Christ.
[48:50] Tear the chains. Deliver those that are
[48:53] oppressed. Heal the sick, Lord,
[48:58] through your sacrifice already finished.
[49:02] Tear the prisons, Lord. Lord, those that
[49:06] can receive the necessary faith, may
[49:09] they rise up, Lord, in your name and
[49:12] claim a total deliverance, Lord, because
[49:16] you have already paid the price and the
[49:18] title is clean. Satan, you have no part
[49:22] or place with the children of God. I
[49:24] conjure you in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:27] that you come out of them. Loosen the
[49:31] property of God. Just like the prophet
[49:34] of God said, denominations, loose them
[49:37] because they're still going to come
[49:38] anyhow. I also tell you, let them go
[49:41] because they have been purchased. Now,
[49:43] you have no partner place with them. In
[49:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[49:49] we accept it, Lord.
[49:52] We believe it, Lord. Amen.
[49:54] Amen.
[49:55] Amen.
[49:56] And amen.
