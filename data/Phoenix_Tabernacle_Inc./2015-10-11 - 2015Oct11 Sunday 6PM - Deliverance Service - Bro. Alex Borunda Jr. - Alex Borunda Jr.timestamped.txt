[29:12] okay um first of all I had a feeling he
[29:15] was going to do
[29:18] that he didn't warn me about
[29:21] this so I was just thinking to
[29:25] myself what what
[29:27] should I
[29:29] give um he well God gave me a little
[29:33] bit I mean a lot of you heard my
[29:35] testimony
[29:37] before I'm just gonna just give a tiny
[29:40] bit of that and then say what God is
[29:42] doing for
[29:46] me it's it's been about nine
[29:50] years um since uh God has touched my
[29:55] life um I have to two
[29:58] kids and uh during that time um after
[30:01] you know I got
[30:03] baptized um it's been
[30:06] rough
[30:08] um but um God is very
[30:12] faithful
[30:15] um sometimes I don't know
[30:19] um why I'm still
[30:24] standing um but it's by the grace of God
[30:29] um I prayed for my
[30:31] kids
[30:33] um and God has shown me that's that's my
[30:39] mission he's given me
[30:41] everything and I I pray for my kids that
[30:45] they receive the same steps that I've
[30:48] gone
[30:49] [Music]
[30:52] through I don't want them to receive
[30:54] anything
[30:56] less
[30:58] um through this
[31:00] time I know it's it's been a
[31:03] battle but God but through God's grace
[31:06] and
[31:07] mercy I'm still standing
[31:10] here um I'm free from
[31:14] drugs I don't I don't do any of that
[31:16] stuff anymore
[31:19] alcohol I I thank God for that and I'm
[31:25] trusting and standing on his
[31:29] word that God is going to
[31:31] fulfill his promises in my kids'
[31:36] lives um that is my
[31:40] desire and that's the restoration that I
[31:45] know that I'm waiting
[31:47] for I thank God for
[31:50] that one more minute use it one more
[31:56] minute
[32:05] I'll pick up the slack for
[32:08] her she downplays her her
[32:13] testimony and before the Lord touched
[32:17] me he touched her and then she began to
[32:22] pray for
[32:23] me and she turned to her mama and she
[32:25] goes don't worry about a step
[32:30] I said God's going to get
[32:32] him and and sure
[32:35] enough when I was out in the
[32:38] streets um at this time I was already
[32:41] I've been a drug guy for 15
[32:46] years
[32:48] um first uh just like any of you
[32:52] guys any of the kids those that remember
[32:56] me I used to carry my dad's
[32:59] briefcase I used to take
[33:02] notes I was y
[33:04] High and and As I
[33:06] Grew I took a wrong
[33:09] turn and you know one thing led to
[33:13] another you know 15 years
[33:16] later um I'm Downing
[33:19] out I'm a gang
[33:22] member you know in search of things that
[33:25] that I could could not quench
[33:30] they didn't understand why I made these
[33:34] turns but I made
[33:36] them and I and when I look down in my
[33:40] life uh I used to wonder if there was a
[33:43] way
[33:46] back and uh while when when started
[33:49] praying for
[33:51] me I didn't know she was praying for
[33:54] me but when things started to happen
[33:59] as I began to go to these these drug
[34:04] houses uh and when they used to start
[34:06] seeing me
[34:10] come they would look at me Shut the
[34:14] doors or turn a different direction and
[34:16] take off
[34:19] running and I was wondering why they
[34:21] would start to do
[34:24] that and then one day I met with Wanita
[34:28] she had an experience here in
[34:32] church God made her a real
[34:36] lady made her a real
[34:44] lady is the same power to transform
[34:49] me and and I went to her and I said
[34:53] Wanita the doctor say I need to take
[34:55] medication
[34:58] uh I had post-traumatic
[35:01] syndrome I was I I didn't want to
[35:04] diagnos myself but I'm sure I was pretty
[35:10] insane you know I was left to die in a
[35:13] parking lot shot and bleeding
[35:18] out and God used
[35:20] Satan to put me on my
[35:23] back he broke my leg severed
[35:29] arteries and and all along what he was
[35:34] doing was to do
[35:37] that to put me on my
[35:41] back I could look
[35:44] nowhere and I couldn't
[35:46] run so the only way I could look was
[35:48] look
[35:52] up and I didn't understand God was
[35:54] calling
[35:55] me uh a lot of us ignore our
[36:00] call but when I went to
[36:03] Wanita I said Wanita I've been smoking
[36:06] cigarettes for 15
[36:09] years I smoke camel Palo menal every
[36:13] brand you could think
[36:16] of tried to calm my nerves tried to get

[44:44] out if you don't understand what I'm
[44:46] talking about what I'm talking
[44:50] about we live as
[44:53] Christians but with reservations
[44:57] like a big chief Indian
[45:00] reservations we have our plot we have
[45:04] our
[45:06] land this
[45:08] is this is our
[45:12] reservation people get angry I'm
[45:15] sorry but you know I'm Indian
[45:19] too but
[45:22] we and this is what happened the very
[45:24] next day
[45:26] I turned the computer
[45:28] on
[45:29] [Music]
[45:32] CPU my central processing
[45:37] unit which you
[45:39] have
[45:41] go you
[45:43] hypocrite oh man you you think you're
[45:45] real smart Alex you you were right you
[45:47] were
[45:48] right yeah they patronized you yeah but
[45:52] there's a clip side to
[45:54] this you did it
[45:56] with
[45:59] reservation what are you talking
[46:02] about
[46:08] you so to those brothers that are
[46:10] hearing me in the
[46:13] internet ibly apologize to
[46:16] you and I'm
[46:18] sorry and and I don't blame if you don't
[46:21] like
[46:22] me and and uh I don't like
[46:27] myself yeah but uh but uh and I
[46:30] understand that we have to love
[46:31] ourselves I understand all
[46:33] that but the things what what I'm trying
[46:35] to say I'm confessing to
[46:38] you and
[46:41] uh and that's something
[46:44] sometimes we get in the
[46:47] way we the
[46:49] ministry we the people in the
[46:53] benches the Deacons
[46:56] we get in the
[46:59] way we
[47:01] impede the holy ghost from working on a
[47:04] sinner
[47:06] person okay now the thing is is we have
[47:11] to live
[47:13] Godly and and we we have to get rid of
[47:15] our
[47:18] garbage brother brother Mike I'm pecking
[47:21] back in what brother Mike preached
[47:22] yesterday last
[47:24] Sunday
[47:27] and he he had a
[47:29] backpack and then he'd call it sins and
[47:31] he he put it over
[47:36] there and and it was so
[47:39] good you know we need to leave our
[47:41] burdens
[47:43] down our
[47:46] baggage what think negative thoughts of
[47:50] our
[47:54] brother we need to empty
[47:57] out the Lord told
[48:00] me yes you said the right
[48:03] thing do you understand what I just said
[48:06] you discern the right thing you know the
[48:09] right
[48:11] thing
[48:13] wrong yeah and you do it with
[48:23] reservations a reservation and my
[48:26] definition
[48:27] is it's something that you're keeping
[48:31] back with
[48:33] withholding a setting
[48:36] apart it's keeping keeping
[48:39] back making an
[48:41] exception or
[48:46] qualification an
[48:48] exception with
[48:51] tact to accept
[48:54] something
[48:56] but with inner
[48:59] reservations so brother Alex so brother
[49:02] Alex is not a real nice
[49:04] guy so I made my
[49:07] confession would you forgive
[49:09] me if I thought about if I have thought
[49:12] that about you at one time or
[49:18] another Revelation 15 we
[49:23] read and brother Bram said
[49:26] the Bible the Bible reads we read the
[49:28] scripture right SC okay brother Bram
[49:31] said in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:34] in paragraph
[49:40] 232 the word
[49:44] washed they're actually
[49:47] actually in the Greek means
[49:53] loose I was going to take my belt but I
[49:55] don't think that's a very good
[49:58] idea but you you you
[50:02] lose do you understand loose I have my
[50:05] shoelaces and I can untie
[50:07] them and they will become
[50:11] loose now brother Ram

[50:24] sin
[50:27] okay very good very good our sin
[50:33] one
[50:34] okay we couldn't
[50:37] see we couldn't hear had no
[50:43] conception of Heaven Or

[50:50] down cut the
[50:53] line and we got got loose we got
[50:57] loose this is a Deliverance

[51:05] doubt you are loose from every bad thing
[51:08] that you've ever
[51:14] done if that isn't
