life of William Branham the man in his commission 1946 to 1950 written by Owen Jorgensen what a tremendous work we're starting chapter 35 the titled the chapters refusing a check for 1 million five hundred thousand dollars now I know that's a lot of money and it would be a lot of money to anyone I would that I know if you're curious converting that to the value of dollars in 2018 using very basic calculation of three and a half percent inflation per year brother Ernie I know you know about that math it comes out to just under seventeen point two million dollars today having said that we have a profit that operated not in the world me although he was subject to it he operated in God's economy and we're so thankful for that the moment in the chapter that the title refers to happens in part 2 of the chapter tonight we're doing part 1 and so let's get started now that William Branham had returned home to Jeffersonville he discovered he had acquired a new set of responsibilities letters funneled in from all over the United States in Canada at first bill and made us struggled to answer this mail by themselves every day the mailman dropped another giant bag full of letters on the porch and soon bill realized this job was too much for him he rented a small office and hired mr. and mrs. Cox members of his congregation as secretaries with their help bill separated the mail into two piles the first and the largest group of letters came from people describing their troubles and needs and asking him to pray for them bill considered these requests as just another part of his Commission and he prayed earnestly over each one the second pile of letters came from the minister's inviting him to come and hold healing campaigns in their localities Bill's set these invitations aside and prayed about where God wanted him to go next eventually he arranged night in ireri that would keep him busy through the middle of 1947 first while the northern states were snow bound he would travel in the south beginning in Louisiana and moving westward to Texas Arizona in California later in the spring he would spend several months near to home before heading north into Saskatchewan in Alberta Canada although not fully recovered from his exhaustion bill felt impatient to get back to the work for which the Lord had called him for he began in Shreveport Louisiana where he was scheduled to hold five services for Reverend Jack Moore pastor of an independent Pentecostal Church known as Life tabernacle when Reverend Moore took Bill over to his church for the first service Moore was astonished to find his large tabernacle so crowded with strangers that he and his guests had difficulty getting inside mere word-of-mouth advertising had drawn families from all over Louisiana and Arkansas more decided they needed more room so for the second night here in into High School Auditorium however after only two services in this auditorium he decided to move his meetings back to life Tabernacle because the people were showing up so early at the high school that they were disrupting the school day this was a week like Jack Moore had never seen before five nights filled with milk miracles and wonders later he would write about it saying the people were left humbled and tendered because they knew that Jesus of Nazareth had passed our way in his servant yes Bible days were here again here was a man who practiced what we preached I say this not to exalt any human but only to emphasize that our deep appreciation for our brother William Branham stem from the fact that his ministry seemed to bring our lover Lord Jesus closer to us and to better acquaint us with his living works his personality and his deity than anything had before feeling he had to know more about this phenomenal ministry Jack Moore left his church in the hands of an associate pastor so that he could travel with William Branham through the rest of the year after Louisiana bill flew the Texas holding meetings in Houston for 15 straight nights before moving on to Texarkana in San Antonio during his first night in San Antonio something happened that shook bill to the heart of his spirit the service began the song leader announced bill to the audience the crowd waited reverently and with expectation as bill walked across the platform toward the pulpit a man sitting on the platform stood and spoke in an unknown language the unintelligible words firing loud and rapidly like a machine gun when he finished the audience remained quiet another man stood in the back of the auditorium and bellowed thus saith the Lord the man that is walking across the platform is going forward with the ministry that was ordained by Almighty God as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of jesus christ so is this man sent to forerun his second coming the old felt lightheaded and weak enough to have his knees buckle he grabbed the pulpit to support himself has he spoken to the microphone sir you and the back who just gave a prophesy do you know this man here on the platform who spoke in tongues demands standing in the back look like a cowboy no sir I do not do you know anything about me I've never heard of you before today how did you come to be here tonight the people I work for were coming to the meetings and they asked me to come along so I came turning to the man behind him on the platform who had spoken with tongues bill asked do you know that man who gave the prophecy no I don't what are you doing here tonight I'm a local merchant I read in the paper about a divine healer so I came to see what it was all about having studying first Corinthians 12 through 14 bill knew that the interpretation of tongues was listed as a gift of the Holy Spirit however bill had long suspected that much of what the Pentecostal people called tongues was nothing more than excitement fanaticism and carnality this interpretation did not fit into any of those three categories this one sounded genuine because this stranger had repeated what Bill had heard that day in 1933 when he had stood baptizing in the Ohio River and that star had appeared overhead that was 14 years ago at this time bill marvel wondering if there would be more to his ministry than just praying for the sick after Texas bill traveled to Phoenix Arizona stress continued to tear him down it felt like more than just long hours of standing in too little sleep when bill prayed for the sick he actually felt that demonic forces he battled it tired him as much as digging a ditch in rocky ground with a shovel and pick whenever bill took a patient's right hand in his left and allowed the disease to vibrate up his arm to his heart he felt some of his own energy crumble away energy that did not come back after a night's sleep he learned about demons by matching what he read in the Bible with what he experienced while praying for the sick he read in the New Testament how demons cast out of one person look for another host he watched the same phenomenon in his meetings as a patient on the platform was deliver from insanity it was possible down an irreverent unbeliever in the audience could receive the same disease he remembered a group of people who were disrespectful in jonesboro jeering and making cat calls at a time when bill was praying for a man thrashing on the floor with an epileptic seizure epileptic people who came near the angel of the Lord always had seizures after bill prayed the young man returned to normal but that whole group of irreverence skeptics fell into epileptic fits later he learned it was a minister and 28 people from his congregation who contracted the epilepsy that night from that experience bill learned caution now whenever he sense a stubborn case he asked the audience to bow their heads and pray with him he learned that even unbelievers would be safe in his meetings if they acted respectfully one night in Phoenix a child came through the prayer line bill took the girl's hand and felt the tell-tale vibrations of epilepsy the child jerked into a seizure falling to the platform and thrashing uncontrollably the audience gasped bill remain calm and ask everyone to bow their heads when he bowed his own head to pray he sensed a break in the flow of faith looking again over the crowd he spotted a man who had not lowered his head bill sent into the microphone there is a man to my right with his head up sir even if you don't believe please bow your head and be reverent these demon powers can go from one to another the man did not bow his head one of the ushers walked over and talked to him then came up onto the platform and told bill it's mr. kay one of Phoenix's public officials he says there isn't anything to this stuff but a good case of psychology he insists he doesn't have to put his head down bill spoke again into the microphone sir I asked you that's all I can do he turned back to the child who ribs on the floor making low guttural noises bill prayed God don't let this innocent child suffer because of that man's unbelief press blessed the child and deliver her the girl calmed and soon opened her eyes her guardian rushed forward to help her up and together they walked off the platform praising God mr. K smiled defiantly as though he had proved his point he did not have to bow his head unfortunately it would be a short-lived victory on bills last night in Phoenix he promised the crowd that he would try to pray for everyone in the building who wanted prayer that would have been impossible to do if he had to take hold of every person's hand so that the vibrations could reveal each disease tonight he tried something different he called it a fast prayer line people on the prayer line kept moving at a slow steady pace while bill just laid his hand on their shoulders as they passed asking the Lord Jesus to heal them many miracles happened that night although perhaps the most amazing is the one that happened to had a Waldorf a woman dying from cancer of the heart liver and colon her doctors had given up on her now she was trying desperately to reach this man who claimed an angel stood next to him when he prayed for the sick Haddie's husband in an intern from the hospital carried her into the meeting on a stretcher as they waited in the prayer line she felt her life fading away she told her husband even if I die take me through anyway they were a long way back as the line slowly inched forward she lapsed into unconsciousness soon her chest quit moving the intern felt had poor had his pulse and could not detect it so he pulled the blanket over her face mr. Waldorf with grim determination kept our place in line it took an hour for mr. worf to get his wife to the front of the line someone told bill there was a corpse coming through bill stop the line so he could pray longer for this case the woman felt cold to his touch when Bill asked God to give Hattie water of her life again not only did breath flow back into her lungs but soon she sat up and later that evening she actually walked out of the building on her own strength that long prayer line in Phoenix abounded with healings and miracles even though bill kept his prayer short it still took him until 3 o'clock in the morning to touch all the sick who passed by according to Jack Mohr's estimate on that one night in February of 1947 bill prayed for 2,500 people God bless you a man how many
