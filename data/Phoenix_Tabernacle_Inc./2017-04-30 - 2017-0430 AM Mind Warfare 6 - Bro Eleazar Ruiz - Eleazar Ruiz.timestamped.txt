[1:03:45] thing but when you really get down to it
[1:03:48] it's got a little bit more
[1:03:51] teeth so what we're doing this morning
[1:03:53] we're presenting the baby
[1:03:57] and guess what we're also dedicating
[1:04:00] it but the dedication is to the
[1:04:04] parents now they got to dedicate time to
[1:04:06] the
[1:04:07] baby to raise them up in the

[1:33:06] word I finally understood what brother
[1:33:12] Bernie was trying to do with
[1:33:18] us I finally
[1:33:21] understood what brother Bernie was
[1:33:23] trying to
[1:33:26] do with us
[1:33:30] men you know what he was trying
[1:33:34] to make every single one of us
[1:33:47] pastors that was his whole
[1:33:51] motive that every single one of us
[1:33:56] could get to a
[1:33:59] point to a level of
[1:34:02] maturity where we could be
[1:34:07] pastors and the
[1:34:09] first sheep or
[1:34:13] lamb that we were going to have in our
[1:34:18] flock to be Shepherds
[1:34:21] of was ourselves
[1:34:34] think about that for a little
[1:34:37] bit you were supposed
[1:34:41] to be the
[1:34:44] shepherd of your own
[1:34:47] self and
[1:34:50] then after you had done a good enough
[1:34:53] job this
[1:34:57] the next person that you were supposed
[1:34:58] to
[1:35:01] shepher was your
[1:35:10] wife and then
[1:35:13] together we were supposed to Shepherd
[1:35:16] our
[1:35:22] family
[1:35:25] that's
[1:35:32] it I I was I was out of town last
[1:35:38] week and got a chance to talk to some
[1:35:42] brothers and I finally understood what
[1:35:44] my problem
[1:35:47] was I was trying to fix the
[1:35:51] church I'm talking about Phoenix
[1:35:53] Tabernacle
[1:35:54] phoen I was trying to fix the associate
[1:35:58] pastor I was even trying to fix the
[1:36:05] pastor and the Lord finally revealed to
[1:36:08] me that the only person I need to
[1:36:13] fix is
[1:36:22] me
[1:36:26] remember this is a
[1:36:28] supplement and it's dedicated to the men
[1:36:30] of this
[1:36:33] church the only
[1:36:35] person that we need to
[1:36:38] fix is
[1:36:40] ourselves not our
[1:36:42] wife not our
[1:36:44] children not
[1:36:52] brother
[1:36:56] last year I quoted my Uncle
[1:37:01] Paul he used to
[1:37:03] say we need to update our
[1:37:08] files you come to
[1:37:11] church you see a
[1:37:13] brother that had
[1:37:17] backslid had gone
[1:37:19] out and then all of a sudden you see him
[1:37:21] in
[1:37:22] church
[1:37:24] and you're like what's he doing
[1:37:26] here I saw him do this this
[1:37:30] and I heard him say this this and
[1:37:35] that he said you don't
[1:37:38] know that perhaps that
[1:37:41] brother is already full of the Holy
[1:37:45] Ghost he's already asked for
[1:37:48] forgiveness God has forgiven
[1:37:51] him and he's been delivered set
[1:37:57] free but you got an old file on
[1:38:03] them this Uncle Paul used to say
[1:38:05] this this is what Uncle Paul used to
[1:38:07] tell us he said it's time to update your
[1:38:13] fil so I
[1:38:15] got
[1:38:19] listen I think it would be
[1:38:22] better if we burnt our
[1:38:30] files here here's what I
[1:38:34] saw I saw
[1:38:37] me with a bunch of filing
[1:38:41] cabinets and I had a file on every
[1:38:43] single one of
[1:38:49] you I'm going to
[1:38:52] church I'm I'm going to be
[1:38:55] delivered hallelujah
[1:39:02] hallelujah that's why there is no
[1:39:08] deliverance and then I thought Lord is
[1:39:10] it just
[1:39:13] me and then I turned around looked at
[1:39:17] you and every single one of you got
[1:39:20] filing cabinets on your
[1:39:22] back
[1:39:25] amen let's not update our
[1:39:29] files let's burn
[1:39:33] them
[1:39:35] brother I burnt your
[1:39:38] file I have nothing on
[1:39:43] you yeah I got nothing on you brother
[1:39:47] Ben I burnt your
[1:39:49] file I don't remember
[1:39:51] nothing because when God forgave
[1:39:55] you he absolutely
[1:40:10] forgot he
[1:40:12] forgot
[1:40:15] completely so when you go next
[1:40:18] time and you ask the Lord for
[1:40:22] forgiveness and you truly accept your
[1:40:26] forgiveness do God a
[1:40:29] favor don't go back and ask him for
[1:40:31] forgiveness for the same
[1:40:37] thing stop
[1:40:39] it because if you ask him for
[1:40:42] forgiveness for the same thing over and
[1:40:44] over
[1:40:48] again he's going to tell you what he
[1:40:50] told
[1:40:52] me what are you talking
[1:40:57] about that's what he told me what are
[1:40:59] you
[1:41:02] talking I have no idea what you're
[1:41:04] talking
[1:41:08] about so John chapter
[1:41:11] 3 verse 17
[1:41:14] says for
[1:41:17] God didn't send Jesus
[1:41:20] Christ to the world to condemn
[1:41:25] it but that through
[1:41:28] him they might be
[1:41:32] saved wait a minute you didn't send
[1:41:34] Jesus Christ your son to condemn
[1:41:39] it then why are we condemning one
[1:41:49] another
[1:41:51] so how many are willing to burn your
[1:41:53] your file on
[1:41:56] me thank
[1:41:58] you awesome who said that they said what
[1:42:09] file that's the
[1:42:13] mind of

[1:44:35] me help me will you lay your hands upon
[1:44:39] me and restore me
[1:44:44] again brother brandom says now now there
[1:44:47] is a
[1:44:48] question I never noticed it when I read
[1:44:51] it a while ago there is a question
[1:44:56] now if that person is present let me
[1:44:58] read it to
[1:45:02] you I have lived many years in sin until
[1:45:05] I found the
[1:45:09] Lord please brother
[1:45:11] brandham I have sinned
[1:45:13] again and I'm not worthy to come before
[1:45:16] you in this holy
[1:45:19] place please tell me if I can be
[1:45:21] restored whole again
[1:45:29] the next
[1:45:31] slide this is Brother bram's
[1:45:34] answer
[1:45:40] yes yes you can be restored whole
[1:45:45] again you have not sinned my
[1:45:48] friend so far in
[1:45:51] God but what you could be
[1:45:54] restored if you had sinned so far that
[1:45:57] you could not be
[1:46:02] restored you would never want to be
[1:46:08] restored
[1:46:15] amen how many have sinned
[1:46:17] here how many have
[1:46:20] thought that you cannot be restored
[1:46:22] again
[1:46:24] but deep in your
[1:46:27] heart you want to be
[1:46:31] restored but the Devil comes and he
[1:46:33] tells
[1:46:35] you you're too far
[1:46:38] gone you've tried one too many
[1:46:42] times as long as there's something
[1:46:44] there're dealing in your
[1:46:48] heart you're still in line of
[1:46:51] restoration
[1:46:55] guilty of the least is guilty of the
[1:46:59] whole this is Brother Brown now saying
[1:47:02] brother BR says I have sinned many
[1:47:05] times every day one of us do things that
[1:47:08] we don't want to
[1:47:11] do it's in our heart you don't want to
[1:47:15] be that
[1:47:16] way or you wouldn't ask this
[1:47:20] question the question itself is proof
[1:47:25] that God is still dealing with
[1:47:28] [Applause]
[1:47:30] you you're probably got
[1:47:33] nervous probably Satan telling you that
[1:47:36] you can't be
[1:47:38] restored he's
[1:47:40] lying he certainly
[1:47:43] is because look if there's a deep
[1:47:48] calling there's got to be a deep to
[1:47:51] respond to that call
[1:47:54] if there is a hunger for
[1:47:57] something it's that something's got to
[1:47:59] be
[1:48:02] somewhere or you would have no hunger
[1:48:05] for
[1:48:07] it now as long as you're wanting and
[1:48:10] hungering to get back to
[1:48:14] God there's a God somewhere calling to
[1:48:21] you or you wouldn't
[1:48:24] hungry there's a
[1:48:26] Creator now there's a place that you can
[1:48:29] cross where you can't get
[1:48:34] back oh we'll just stop right
[1:48:37] there there is a place where you can
[1:48:42] cross where you won't be able to come
[1:48:46] back brother Bram says that there's a
[1:48:48] line of
[1:48:51] Mercy that you
[1:48:57] cross one of these days he's going to
[1:49:01] call you for the last
[1:49:04] time and if you don't
[1:49:07] listen you will have crossed that line
[1:49:10] of
[1:49:13] Mercy if you got your notebooks write it
[1:49:17] down it's Hebrews chapter 6
[1:49:21] verse4 for it is
[1:49:24] impossible shall we go there let's let's
[1:49:28] just do that amen Hebrews chapter 6 ver4
[1:49:32] it's not on the
[1:49:38] screen when you have it say Amen so I
[1:49:40] know you
[1:49:42] got for it is impossible for those who
[1:49:45] were once enlightened and have
[1:49:50] tasted of the Heavenly gift amen and
[1:49:53] were made
[1:49:55] partakers tasters of the Holy
[1:50:09] Ghost and have
[1:50:12] tasted the good word of
[1:50:15] God and the powers of the world to
[1:50:19] come if they shall Fall
[1:50:24] Away it will be
[1:50:30] impossible go ahead sorry no no just say
[1:50:32] what I say okay if they shall fall
[1:50:37] away it will be
[1:50:40] impossible to renew them again unto
[1:50:47] repentance do you know that that's what
[1:50:49] it
[1:50:50] says that's what it says starting from
[1:50:53] verse
[1:50:55] four for it is
[1:50:58] impossible verse six if they shall fall
[1:51:01] away to renew them again un
[1:51:05] repentance seeing They Crucified
[1:51:07] themselves as Son of God a fresh and put
[1:51:08] him to an open
[1:51:14] shame they tasted
[1:51:17] brother they
[1:51:19] tasted of the word of
[1:51:21] God
[1:51:25] amen but didn't
[1:51:29] obey now brother bam

[1:51:45] should be
[1:51:50] up but I want to tell you
[1:51:53] something brother brandham
[1:51:55] says that just because you
[1:51:59] backslide doesn't mean you're
[1:52:02] lost I want somebody to tell me where
[1:52:04] backsliding is lost he says and prove it
[1:52:06] to prove it to the
[1:52:12] Bible backslider is not
[1:52:15] lost he's just out of
[1:52:20] Fellowship wow wow come back to the
[1:52:26] fellowship fellowship with the
[1:52:33] word Israel

[1:52:49] joy David lost the joy of his salvation
[1:52:55] when he took be Sheba uriah's
[1:52:59] wife but he never lost his
[1:53:04] salvation he never said restor to me my
[1:53:09] salvation he said restor to me the
[1:53:13] joy of my
[1:53:16] salvation amen you know what this tells
[1:53:20] me that you might have been saved at one
[1:53:25] time you might have accepted the Lord
[1:53:27] Jesus Christ as your personal
[1:53:31] Savior and you got baptized in Christian
[1:53:36] baptis and you
[1:53:39] backslid but that doesn't mean you're
[1:53:44] lost now the devil will want to tell you
[1:53:46] you're
[1:53:50] lost that you're not even Worthy
[1:53:55] but you're not
[1:53:57] lost you're just out of
[1:54:00] Fellowship come back to the
[1:54:09] fellowship next slide then how about a
[1:54:12] big eagle he
[1:54:14] says he's a Heavenly
[1:54:17] bird he lives way in Above the
[1:54:21] Clouds that's where he goes over morning
[1:54:23] ways so high nothing can follow
[1:54:27] him no other bird can follow

[1:54:53] caught him in a man-made
[1:54:58] trap they caught this big eagle and put
[1:55:00] him in this
[1:55:02] cage and this poor old fellow I looked
[1:55:05] at him and then my heart just
[1:55:09] burns he looked at that side like
[1:55:13] that he didn't know how to get out of
[1:55:16] that
[1:55:17] cage he'd get across
[1:55:20] there and he and he'd want to take
[1:55:24] off and he' start trying to flop his
[1:55:28] wings and here he go and he was banging
[1:55:31] his head up against the

[1:55:46] bleeding he hit that bar so hard and
[1:55:48] knock Plum back on his
[1:55:51] back

[2:09:03] 24 this is what we call the domino
[2:09:16] effect are you ready it's it's
[2:09:20] easy
[2:09:22] getting extraordinary results is all
[2:09:24] about creating a domino effect in your
[2:09:31] life every great change
[2:09:36] starts like a falling
[2:09:40] Domino it's still not there let let me
[2:09:44] tell you
[2:09:45] this the first place that Satan will
[2:09:47] attack us is
[2:09:50] where that's the first
[2:09:55] Domino if Satan can
[2:09:58] manage to knock over the first
[2:10:02] one all the other dominoes will
[2:10:10] fall that's why brother Bram
[2:10:14] said that the first place he'll attack
[2:10:18] you is in your
[2:10:20] mind amen see the last
[2:10:24] Domino Falls in
[2:10:27] Hell on Earth in drug addiction in
[2:10:32] alcoholism in
[2:10:34] divorce yes in sin on Earth he wants to
[2:10:40] destroy
[2:10:41] you his last
[2:10:44] Domino is absolute
[2:10:47] destruction but he's not going to go
[2:10:49] after the last Domino
[2:10:52] he's not going to try to go after every
[2:10:54] single
[2:10:56] Domino all he's got to do is knock over
[2:10:58] the first
[2:11:04] one just knock over that first
[2:11:12] Dom but
[2:11:14] Satan is just an
[2:11:20] imitator he he looked at what God was
[2:11:24] doing oh that's how you do
[2:11:30] it thank
[2:11:33] [Applause]
[2:11:35] you out of the M of
[2:11:49] babes go to the next slide
[2:11:53] oh my goodness you got no no no slide
[2:11:58] 25 I gave him a hard time poor Eli he's
[2:12:00] just doing the best he can back there
[2:12:03] cuz there's like two messages in one and
[2:12:05] I didn't know where I was going to
[2:12:08] start slide 25 me I know you'll get it
[2:12:11] you'll get
[2:12:12] it this is what they say topping
[2:12:16] dominoes is pretty
[2:12:19] straightforward you line the
[2:12:21] up and you tip over the first
[2:12:25] one in the real
[2:12:28] world it's a little bit more
[2:12:31] complicated we're talking about life
[2:12:33] dominoes of Life The Challenge is that
[2:12:36] life does not line everything up for
[2:12:41] us and say Here's what you should
[2:12:44] do this is where you need to
[2:12:47] start highly successful people know this
[2:12:53] so every
[2:12:54] day they line up their priorities a
[2:12:58] new they find the lead
[2:13:02] Domino and work away at it until it
[2:13:08] falls because extraordinary
[2:13:13] success is
[2:13:16] sequential not
[2:13:20] simultaneous my last
[2:13:22] Domino is to be
[2:13:25] sealed with the Seal of
[2:13:33] God but there's a lot of dominoes in
[2:13:35] front of that
[2:13:37] one if I can manage to knock over the
[2:13:41] first
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:43] one I can walk
[2:13:46] away and know it's going to
[2:13:50] fall
[2:13:53] where is your first
[2:13:57] Domino why
[2:14:00] why why do we not have the
[2:14:05] success spiritual
[2:14:07] success that we should
[2:14:10] have you can apply this
[2:14:14] principle for
[2:14:17] business for your marriage
[2:14:19] life for your children's
[2:14:23] and for your spiritual
[2:14:29] life
[2:14:38] amen go to slide
[2:14:41] 28
[2:14:43] remember this is a
[2:14:46] supplement hopefully we'll come back and
[2:14:48] we'll preach on mind Warfare
[2:14:53] but I'm opening my mind to
[2:14:57] you I want you to see the
[2:15:01] war in
[2:15:03] action not just talk about
[2:15:06] it but see how it
[2:15:11] works

[2:15:19] 29
[2:15:22] you know I'm getting nervous because our
[2:15:24] time's almost

[2:15:30] illustration what's your first
[2:15:35] Domino

[2:15:41] push push over that first
[2:15:44] one Lauren Lauren you just need to push
[2:15:47] that first
[2:15:48] one but you got to find it
[2:15:53] and I'm going to show you my first
[2:15:58] Domino go to the next
[2:16:01] slide you see this this is a row of
[2:16:03] dominoes that they set
[2:16:07] up you would never
[2:16:10] think that the first
[2:16:13] Domino which is so
[2:16:16] tiny would knock over that big
[2:16:19] one
[2:16:22] that's the Seal of the Holy Ghost right
[2:16:24] there that that big Domino for
[2:16:28] me for 48
[2:16:32] years I've been pushing on that
[2:16:41] one until I
[2:16:43] understood that all I needed to do was
[2:16:45] knock over that first
[2:16:49] one in September of
[2:16:54] 2015 I came up here to the platform I
[2:16:58] asked brother Johnny for 10
[2:17:01] minutes I said I want to I want to talk
[2:17:03] to the
[2:17:04] church would you give me permission he
[2:17:06] said
[2:17:10] yes and as you
[2:17:14] know I had
[2:17:16] left the
[2:17:18] ministry am I resigned
[2:17:22] completely from every office in this
[2:17:26] church but you know there's something
[2:17:28] about a Son of
[2:17:30] God he's got a chain on your
[2:17:35] ankle and he'll only let you go so
[2:17:40] far that's
[2:17:43] right
[2:17:46] that's why do you think you're
[2:17:49] here
[2:17:56] so my first
[2:17:59] Domino I made a
[2:18:01] decision we're on slide
[2:18:04] 30 I made a
[2:18:10] decision to ask God for
[2:18:15] forgiveness that was my first
[2:18:19] Domino just
[2:18:22] and I didn't have to do anything
[2:18:25] else I'm here
[2:18:28] today by the grace of
[2:18:30] God
[2:18:32] so September

[2:18:52] Ministry and governing
[2:18:54] body after going through four years of
[2:18:57] spiritual and physical
[2:19:02] depression
[2:19:04] misunderstandings spiritual and moral
[2:19:09] sins against God my family my wife my
[2:19:14] children and against myself I want to
[2:19:17] confess that I have sinned against
[2:19:19] everyone and everything that I hold dear
[2:19:21] and holy to
[2:19:27] me I have sinned against my heavenly
[2:19:31] father and have brought reproach upon
[2:19:33] his
[2:19:35] word and against my
[2:19:37] testimony I am ashamed of my public
[2:19:39] behavior and
[2:19:42] actions and I take full responsibility
[2:19:45] for my
[2:19:46] actions I have repented of all my
[2:19:49] sins and have asked my wife and children
[2:19:52] for
[2:19:54] forgiveness acknowledging that I failed
[2:19:56] them as a husband and
[2:20:00] father I feel a deep and contrite need
[2:20:02] to ask you my spiritual
[2:20:07] family for forgiveness I have made a
[2:20:12] decision I've made a
[2:20:14] choice to serve the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:20:18] father with all my heart and soul as
[2:20:22] long as I
[2:20:24] live I left him when I left the
[2:20:28] word and I have found him exactly where
[2:20:32] I left
[2:20:34] him when I left his
[2:20:36] word I'm tired of
[2:20:41] running I will have no peace in my heart
[2:20:43] until I know that youve forgiven
[2:20:47] me for running in the face of adversity
[2:20:53] through the struggles of the last four
[2:20:54] years I now understood the words of my
[2:21:00] father in The Gospel of St
[2:21:04] Mark for whosoever will save his life
[2:21:06] shall lose
[2:21:14] it stop trying to save your
[2:21:18] life you're going to lose it
[2:21:24] and whosoever will lose his
[2:21:27] life for my sake shall find
[2:21:32] it I make no
[2:21:34] claims and have no
[2:21:36] rights other than on God's grace and
[2:21:40] mercy forgiveness and
[2:21:43] righteousness I read in 1 John 1
[2:21:47] ver9 that if I confess my sins
[2:21:51] he is faithful and just to forgive me of
[2:21:53] my
[2:21:55] sins and to cleanse me from all
[2:22:00] unrighteousness I stand before you as a
[2:22:02] repented
[2:22:05] sinner the words of the prodigal son I'm
[2:22:08] not even worthy to be called your
[2:22:12] son but I have realized that only one
[2:22:16] step from the finish
[2:22:19] line
[2:22:24] refuse
[2:22:26] am we're one step
[2:22:29] away we're one step
[2:22:34] away God I know the ship has been

[2:22:57] courage we're going to make it we're
[2:23:00] going to make
[2:23:05] it I pray that you can find it in your
[2:23:07] hearts to forgive

[2:23:15] that you'll pray for me and not condemn
[2:23:17] me I pray that you will love me and not

[2:23:40] conscience and since I ask for
[2:23:45] forgiveness my conscience became my best

[2:23:56] conscience we're best
[2:24:00] buds whereas
[2:24:03] before we were our worst
[2:24:06] enemies he was accusing me day and
[2:24:11] night but now me and my conscience we're
[2:24:15] best friends thank
[2:24:19] you
[2:24:21] I'm at
[2:24:22] peace I knocked over the first
[2:24:26] Domino and the dominoes are continuing
[2:24:29] to
[2:24:30] fall I didn't have to do
[2:24:33] anything I realized that I was already
[2:24:39] free you're already
[2:24:43] free you know there was a
[2:24:46] man took his son to the circus one day
[2:24:51] and
[2:24:53] uh they were feeding the
[2:24:58] elephants and the Elephant had a little
[2:25:00] tiny rope tied to his back
[2:25:04] foot and they had just a little skinny
[2:25:06] Branch just hammered into the
[2:25:11] ground and this huge elephant they had
[2:25:13] laid up some hay in front of
[2:25:18] him and and he had finished eating all
[2:25:21] the hay that he could reach with his
[2:25:25] trunk but there was some Eternal hay
[2:25:27] over
[2:25:31] here there was there was some Heavenly
[2:25:35] [Music]
[2:25:38] Mana but his trunk couldn't reach
[2:25:42] it could he had this little tiny string
[2:25:44] this rope tied around his
[2:25:47] foot and every time he felt that little
[2:25:49] tug
[2:25:53] he
[2:25:55] quit so the man saw this
[2:25:58] and he went to the
[2:26:01] trainer and he said why is
[2:26:04] this doesn't the elepant
[2:26:08] know how powerful he
[2:26:13] [Music]
[2:26:14] is he said oh no no he said what you
[2:26:17] don't
[2:26:18] know is when we caught them in the
[2:26:23] wild we tied a big heavy
[2:26:27] chain around a big heavy
[2:26:32] post and that poor little elephant
[2:26:36] struggled and
[2:26:38] struggled and struggled and he'd go to
[2:26:41] the bar and he would
[2:26:43] struggle and he would struggle and he
[2:26:46] would struggle and struggle some
[2:26:49] more
[2:26:51] he said
[2:26:53] until his foot was
[2:26:57] bleeding and it hurt so much to
[2:27:01] struggle that he finally accepted in his
[2:27:06] mind that he would never be
[2:27:10] free and he quit
[2:27:14] struggling he said and when they quit
[2:27:17] struggling we take the chain off and we
[2:27:20] put a little tiny
[2:27:22] rope and he says and as soon as they
[2:27:24] feel the slightest
[2:27:30] resistance they give
[2:27:31] [Music]
[2:27:33] up he
[2:27:35] said here's what it
[2:27:37] is he said the physical
[2:27:41] chain became a mental
[2:27:47] chain mind Warfare
[2:27:53] it's no longer physical
[2:27:54] [Music]
[2:27:57] change you're already
[2:28:03] free you're already
[2:28:07] [Music]
[2:28:13] free we're already
[2:28:19] free but what's holding us
