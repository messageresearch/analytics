[18:08] [Music]
[18:38] [Music]
[18:42] [Applause]
[18:45] [Music]
[18:49] [Applause]
[18:52] [Music]
[19:08] [Music]
[19:16] [Applause]
[19:18] [Music]
[19:25] [Music]
[19:33] [Music]
[19:47] [Music]
[20:16] [Music]
[20:22] [Music]
[20:24] [Applause]
[20:25] [Music]
[20:41] [Music]
[20:48] [Applause]
[20:49] [Music]
[20:57] [Applause]
[20:58] [Music]
[21:12] so we have a new song that we're gonna
[21:14] teach you and this song is really
[21:18] special to me so oh is it okay that I
[21:21] tell you how the song came would that be
[21:24] okay so I had a dream brother Ernie I
[21:28] had a dream that I was walking into
[21:30] church and brother Beto prometo a song
[21:32] leading and while he was thinking I
[21:35] thought oh he's thinking one of my songs
[21:38] and a voice came to me and said you
[21:40] haven't written this song yet and I
[21:42] thought how do i how does he know a song
[21:45] that I haven't written yet and the voice
[21:47] said listen and write it down so I woke
[21:51] up singing this song and I wanted to
[21:57] share it with you would that be okay and
[22:00] we want to sing it together so we can
[22:02] make it a congregational song the song
[22:03] is called the rock and if we can get the
[22:05] words up it would be awesome
[22:21] [Music]
[22:40] so this song ties in perfectly with the
[22:43] scripture that our puppet friend read
[22:45] today
[22:46] talking about the valley of dry bones so
[22:49] this song is written from the
[22:50] perspective of one of the pile of bones
[22:53] that was down in the valley okay so
[22:56] here's the song it goes like this it
[22:57] goes when I was down in the dark the Sun
[23:02] rose high and it called me out in the
[23:10] shade of the rock the rock

[31:57] amen god bless you brother Bernie the
[32:03] third and I think we've been we can all
[32:06] testify that we were a witness to those
[32:08] tremendous specials we will remember
[32:11] that there not many of us here but we
[32:14] heard something that the Lord shared
[32:16] with our brother and that's always
[32:18] special tonight we will continue our
[32:22] series of sequential excerpts from the
[32:24] series of books called supernatural the
[32:26] life of William Branham we're in book 2
[32:29] the young man in this desperation 1933
[32:31] to 1946 written by our precious brother
[32:34] Owen Jorgensen we are in chapter 13
[32:37] we're starting the final chapter of book
[32:38] 2 as we know we're in the year 1946 and
[32:42] if you remember from the last reading
[32:44] brother Branham had been visited by an
[32:46] angel in the cave angel the Lord he was
[32:50] testifying to that very experience at a
[32:53] church service at the Brenham tabernacle
[32:55] and there were quite a few people there
[32:58] that night and after his testimony there
[33:01] may have been some that may not have
[33:02] believed what he shared with them but we
[33:05] know that was one believer his name was
[33:07] Charlie McDowell he was a welder by
[33:10] profession he had had a welding accident
[33:13] where his eyes had been flashed my
[33:14] welding gun and brother Brandon had
[33:17] prayed for him prior to that after that
[33:19] experience the doctors had told him it
[33:21] would take eight to ten days for his
[33:23] eyes to return to normal but he was
[33:25] actually healed the day after brother
[33:27] Benton pray for him by the Lord and
[33:29] we're so thankful for that he also had a
[33:33] wife that was very sick her her name was
[33:37] Maggie McDowell and she had been
[33:40] diagnosed by the
[33:41] actors with cancer and she had been
[33:43] given virtually no hope to survive it
[33:46] well Charlie learned from his experience
[33:50] that you trust in the Lord in all things
[33:52] he came to brother Brendan and asked him
[33:54] to pray for her and brother Brennan
[33:58] prayed for her and she had been arrested
[34:00] nurse for twenty-one years the cancer
[34:03] had gotten so bad that they said from
[34:05] her midsection down her body was ravaged
[34:07] with it she was in the hospital and she
[34:12] was able to go home I do believe in just
[34:14] about a week or so after that after
[34:16] brother Brendan prayed for is the Lord
[34:18] healed her miraculously she returned to
[34:20] work and worked quite a few more years
[34:22] and then retired so based on those
[34:25] events 19:46 had even more in store for
[34:29] brother Branham as we see this was a
[34:31] fundamental step in his ministry it was
[34:34] going from a local ministry to a
[34:36] regional and international ministry and
[34:38] and eventually international and it did
[34:40] it in a very short period of time we're
[34:42] at the threshold of that and tonight
[34:44] we're gonna read the first little more
[34:45] than a third of chapter 30 prisoners set
[34:49] free news of Margie Morgan's healing
[34:59] followed the grapevine from friend to
[35:01] neighbor twisting and winding in its own
[35:03] mysterious way until it crossed the
[35:05] Mississippi River soon william branham
[35:08] received a telegram from st. louis
[35:10] missouri reverend robert dougherty
[35:13] wanted bill to come pray for his
[35:14] daughter Betty who suffer from an
[35:16] unknown illness recognizing the hand of
[35:20] the Lord in this bill told his church
[35:21] and he would go as soon as he could save
[35:23] up enough money for the journey his
[35:26] congregation also felt this was the will
[35:28] of God pooling their resources they
[35:31] immediately collected the eleven dollars
[35:32] needed to buy the round-trip train
[35:34] ticket bill borrowed a suit of clothes
[35:36] from one of his brothers and took a
[35:38] night train bound for Missouri when the
[35:41] train pulled in the st. Louis the next
[35:43] morning Robert Dougherty was waiting at
[35:45] the station he looked weary brother
[35:48] branham have you heard anything from the
[35:50] Lord no brother Dougherty how's your
[35:52] little girl his shoulders sagged and
[35:55] his voice sounded flat with the junction
[35:57] she's real bad come on I'll take you to
[36:00] see her on the way home he explained my
[36:03] daughter has been suffering with this
[36:04] for three months the doctors are stumped
[36:07] her constant shaking makes him think it
[36:10] could be Saint Vitus dance but she has
[36:13] other symptoms that don't fit that
[36:14] diagnosis nothing that doctors have
[36:17] tried has helped I prayed and prayed for
[36:20] her my family has prayed my congregation
[36:22] has prayed and other ministers in the
[36:27] city have fasted and prayed for her but
[36:29] she's still no better reaching their
[36:31] home bill met mrs. dougherty
[36:33] she looked wilted the edges of her eyes
[36:36] and the corners of her mouth drooped
[36:38] week after week this mother had sat by
[36:40] the bedside of her sick daughter as her
[36:43] little curly-headed betty dougherty she
[36:46] was suffering incessantly
[36:47] she looks so pitiful her lower lip was
[36:50] swollen in bright red from bleeding
[36:52] where she had chewed on it in her pain
[36:54] she tossed constantly back and forth on
[36:56] her bedsheets
[36:58] the poor child had whined and screamed
[37:00] so much that she didn't have any voice
[37:02] left yet she still tried to cry kneeling
[37:06] beside the bed bill took the girl's
[37:07] right hand in his own left it surprised
[37:10] them that they were no vibrations the
[37:13] angel had said he would feel the disease
[37:15] in his left hand and that was exactly
[37:18] what happened with Margie Morgan why
[37:21] couldn't he feel it here then bill
[37:24] remembered the angel said he would only
[37:27] feel vibrations in his hand
[37:28] if the affliction came from a demonic
[37:30] life such as a germ that man Betty
[37:33] Doherty did not have a disease what then
[37:36] was afflicting her bill prayed for the
[37:40] suffering girl with no immediate results
[37:42] not knowing what else to do bill
[37:44] suggested that he and Reverend Doherty
[37:46] go down to his church to continue their
[37:49] appeal to God there in the quiet
[37:51] sanctuary these two men labored in
[37:53] prayer for three hours entreating
[37:56] Almighty God to have mercy on Betty
[37:58] Doherty before they stopped bill prayed
[38:00] Heavenly Father if you will let that
[38:03] poor girl get well I promise you I will
[38:06] move out into the ministry the
[38:07] you have called me too I promise you
[38:11] again that I will continue on the field
[38:13] as long as you provide my needs because
[38:16] I don't ever want to beg two people for
[38:18] money when they returned to the house
[38:21] Betty Dougherty was unchanged bill sat
[38:23] on a living-room couch praying quietly
[38:25] people were coming and going constantly
[38:28] after several hours bill went outside to
[38:30] stretch his legs continuing to pray
[38:32] while he walked block after block
[38:35] grandfather Dougherty met him on the
[38:37] porch when he returned asking has the
[38:40] Lord showed you anything yet brother
[38:41] Branham sadly bill replied not yet he
[38:46] went back inside and sat down on the
[38:48] couch as he looked out of the window the
[38:51] room changed
[38:52] he saw the girls Ben saw people gathered
[38:55] around it saw himself doing something to
[38:57] the child what was it before he could
[39:00] tell the vision abruptly vanished and he
[39:02] found himself back in the living room
[39:04] sitting on the couch then bill realized
[39:07] what had happened the grandfather had
[39:10] come back into the house ending the
[39:12] vision too soon
[39:13] the grandfather asked can I get you
[39:15] anything brother branham no thanks bill
[39:18] stood and went to the front door excuse
[39:21] me but I need to be alone for a while he
[39:24] walked outside in satin Robert
[39:25] Daugherty's car asking God to let the
[39:28] vision return soon his ears caught the
[39:31] rhythmic whipping sound of a whirlwind
[39:33] looking up he saw the same pillar of
[39:36] fire that had pulsed above the angel in
[39:38] the cave now it was spinning around a
[39:41] few feet above the hood of the car the
[39:43] vision came in a rush bill saw a little
[39:46] girl outside the dirty house playing on
[39:49] a sloping cellar door saw her jumping up
[39:52] and down on the highest part of the door
[39:54] saw her slip and land in an awkward heap
[39:57] then bill saw her trouble and saw what
[40:00] he must do to help her flinging open the
[40:03] car door he strode up the driveway and
[40:05] into the house
[40:06] brother dougherty have you got
[40:08] confidence in me as God's servant yes
[40:10] brother branham I have thus sayeth the
[40:14] Lord for your daughter but you must do
[40:17] exactly what I tell you to do first I
[40:19] want everybody out of the house
[40:21] except the family after the numerous
[40:24] friends had left bill said to the mother
[40:26] sister Daugherty two days ago you bought
[40:29] a white bucket and put it under the sink
[40:31] in your pantry you have not yet put
[40:34] water in it
[40:35] brother branham that's true how did you
[40:38] know go get it fill it with water and
[40:43] bring in here along with a white cloth
[40:46] when she returned bill knelt by the
[40:49] child's bed and said I want the
[40:51] grandfather to kneel on one side of me
[40:53] and the father to kneel on the other as
[40:55] I repeat the Lord's Prayer I want the
[40:57] mother to wet that cloth wring it out
[40:59] and wipe it across the child's face then
[41:03] across her hands then across her feet
[41:05] just as I finished
[41:06] bill bowed his head and began our Father
[41:10] who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[41:13] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[41:16] earth as it is in heaven as soon as he
[41:19] finished the model prayer he said with
[41:22] authority thus saith the Lord
[41:24] Betty Dougherty will be healed she fell
[41:27] off the cellar door and knocked a bone
[41:29] out of place in her back push that bone
[41:31] back in place and she will get well
[41:34] Robert Dougherty turned his daughter
[41:36] over her stomach and fell along to
[41:38] curvature her spine sure enough one
[41:41] vertebra bulged excessively with strong
[41:43] hands he gave a quick firm push on that
[41:45] spot and the vertebra slipped back into
[41:48] place immediately Betty stop moaning and
[41:51] thrashing soon she was sitting up in bed
[41:53] smiling later that day bill and Betty
[41:55] walked down to the local soda fountain
[41:57] and shared a malted milkshake several
[42:01] weeks later bill was sitting on his
[42:03] front porch late in the afternoon when
[42:04] the Dougherty family drove up Betty
[42:06] jumped out of the car first her blonde
[42:08] curls bounced as she ran up to Bill and
[42:10] gave him a hug
[42:11] Robert Dougherty sat down on the porch
[42:13] and asked bill if he would consider
[42:14] returning to st. Louis for a weekend for
[42:17] a week-long healing revival bill did not
[42:20] have to spend very long considering the
[42:22] offer he thought about the vision he had
[42:24] seen in March where he was standing in
[42:26] the West dispensing a great mountain of
[42:29] the bread of life st. Louis was west of
[42:32] Jeffersonville perhaps this revival
[42:34] would for
[42:35] build that vision but even if it wasn't
[42:37] bill felt he must now keep his promise
[42:40] to God and move out full-time into his
[42:43] new ministry
[42:43] god bless god bless you once again we

[52:44] now the scripture scripture goes at like
[52:47] this now it came to pass as they went
[52:52] that he entered into a certain village
[52:55] and a certain woman named Martha
[52:59] received him into her house and she had
[53:06] a sister called Mary which also sat at
[53:11] Jesus feet and heard his word but Martha
[53:19] was cumbered about much serving and came
[53:24] to him and said O Lord does thou not
[53:29] care that my sister has left me to serve
[53:33] alone bid her therefore that she help me
[53:39] and jesus answered and said unto her
[53:43] Martha Martha
[53:46] thou art careful and troubled about many
[53:51] things
[53:53] but one thing is needful and Mary had
[53:57] chosen that good part which shall not be
[54:01] taken away from her well we just read
[54:05] the word so we're gonna pray okay Lord
[54:07] Heavenly Father we love you Lord Jesus

[55:06] your seats so well we have in a couple
[55:13] of helpers here on who's Martha okay hi
[55:19] Martha how are you doing and I'm a
[55:22] believer I'm believing this is Mary
[55:23] right here okay and this is Jesus okay
[55:26] we know we know who are actors and our
[55:29] actresses and actors are although it's a
[55:32] it this really happened in the Bible you
[55:35] know we we just read what happened and
[55:37] it's a it's a beautiful story
[55:40] as I was reading this with my children
[55:43] the other day
[55:45] my wife brought it to our attention
[55:48] it was a very interesting story
[55:50] something that I probably had passed up
[55:53] many times in the Bible but it had a
[55:55] very good point to it and we're here to
[55:59] share with you this evening and so many
[56:01] may the Lord which he blesses for that
[56:04] you know did you know that in real life
[56:08] sometimes our our conversations that in
[56:16] the in the Bible some there were some
[56:18] people who actually had the opportunity
[56:21] to have real life conversations
[56:24] with Jesus and those people were really
[56:28] really blessed not everybody was able to
[56:32] have Jesus over for lunch or dinner or
[56:35] or anything like that
[56:38] um we know also of another story where
[56:40] Jesus wasn't invited by Simon I believe
[56:43] the Pharisee he went over to their house
[56:46] and we know that Jesus didn't get
[56:50] treated he didn't get treated very well
[56:52] over there well here's another story of
[56:55] how there was a lady by the name of
[56:59] Martha and she was doing all her best to
[57:04] try to treat her guests and the best way
[57:08] possible Martha I'm assuming was was you
[57:14] know getting the frijoles ready and and
[57:18] maybe cooking up something really really
[57:21] good and maybe she was getting some some
[57:26] glasses ready for water or or cleaning
[57:29] up and she just wanted to have the place
[57:32] look really really good for for Jesus
[57:36] you know and so she was doing really
[57:39] good things you know so as as we in this
[57:44] situation she was a privileged person
[57:47] her and Mary to be able to have Jesus
[57:50] come over to their house and visit them
[57:53] and so as when Jesus came to
[57:57] visit Mary and Martha she started doing
[58:02] her chores and she started getting
[58:03] things ready and she was cooking food
[58:06] and and because Jesus was the guest of
[58:10] their house and there were so much to do
[58:13] all the while one of the sisters Mary
[58:19] was doing nothing she was just sitting
[58:24] there quietly and I would imagine that
[58:29] after a little while you know Martha
[58:33] noticed this and and it started to get
[58:35] to her and she just was it was her
[58:39] inside her thoughts you know it she
[58:42] started to think about how she was
[58:44] taught as a young child you know I had
[58:46] her memory started to kick in my mom
[58:51] taught me that you need to be busy and
[58:53] that's a good thing you know you know
[58:57] that as women we were supposed to do
[59:00] clean and cook and this and that and and
[59:03] those are good things but she probably
[59:06] had all kinds of thoughts going on in
[59:08] her mind and as she saw her sister doing
[59:11] nothing she probably took a good look at
[59:15] her and scratched her head and said what
[59:20] is she doing does she not know who's
[59:25] here I mean this is the son of the
[59:29] Living God Jesus Christ he's our guest
[59:34] of honor at her home and here goes Mary
[59:37] doing nothing so as she started thinking
[59:42] these things in her mind that there were
[59:46] so much things to do and that Mary was
[59:50] just sitting there she couldn't believe
[59:52] it so after a while Mary Martha just had
[59:57] enough she just started complaining to
[1:00:02] Jesus about the unfairness and I would
[1:00:06] imagine that she maybe says something
[1:00:08] like this
[1:00:09] hello Jesus
[1:00:13] I'm cleaning and I'm doing all the work
[1:00:17] around here you know as she grabbed and
[1:00:20] she complained to Jesus but my sister
[1:00:23] Mary over here
[1:00:25] she's just being lazy and although
[1:00:30] Martha was doing good things she didn't
[1:00:34] get the answer that she expected you
[1:00:36] know Martha thought Jesus was going to
[1:00:39] correct her and and and tell Mary Mary
[1:00:43] now you're marked your sister Martha is
[1:00:48] doing a very good thing she's cooking
[1:00:50] and cleaning and and yeah I believe you
[1:00:54] should help her out I'm Jesus I know
[1:00:58] what's good
[1:00:59] you know I saw Martha thought I know
[1:01:03] what Jesus gonna say something I heard
[1:01:05] but then she didn't receive that answer
[1:01:10] that she was expecting no she thought
[1:01:15] that Jesus was going to correct her and
[1:01:17] tell her to get to work instead Jesus
[1:01:23] corrected of Martha and gently he helped
[1:01:30] her see that even though taking care of
[1:01:34] guests was a good thing he wanted her to
[1:01:38] be like Mary he wanted her to be a pain
[1:01:43] attention to him he wanted to be for
[1:01:49] Martha to be paying attention to Jesus
[1:01:52] that's all Mary was trying to do she
[1:01:56] probably had a million things going in
[1:01:58] her mind like man I should be helping
[1:02:01] but but we had this tremendous guest
[1:02:04] here and Jesus and I just want to see
[1:02:07] he's gonna say something or or do
[1:02:10] something or or maybe tell me something
[1:02:13] that's gonna change my life and and as
[1:02:16] Mary was thinking as she just couldn't
[1:02:19] help but just stay still and and
[1:02:21] meanwhile
[1:02:23] that was just she was cleaning and and
[1:02:25] cooking and doing all these good things
[1:02:28] but what Jesus wanted to Martha to know
[1:02:34] was that she just wanted her to just pay
[1:02:38] attention like like Mary so that is a
[1:02:44] very strange theme you know we can as
[1:02:47] human beings we can be doing good things
[1:02:52] you know doing lots of things but Jesus
[1:02:59] has different things on his mind
[1:03:01] you know it can be easy to get caught up
[1:03:05] in complaining about others and our
[1:03:07] prayers but Jesus is more concerned with
[1:03:13] what is in our hearts amen you may not
[1:03:19] be right or know best but it's okay to
[1:03:24] vent your frustrations to God you know
[1:03:26] that's a good thing but expect Jesus to
[1:03:30] tell you what you're missing and this is
[1:03:33] what happened to to Martha she was
[1:03:38] expecting a different answer she thought
[1:03:41] doing good things you know having good
[1:03:43] works and and getting involved and and
[1:03:46] and and and being here and being there
[1:03:49] and and just you know her works her
[1:03:51] actions she thought it was a good thing
[1:03:53] but sometimes Jesus just wants you to
[1:03:55] just settle down and realize that the
[1:03:59] guest of honor is in your presence and
[1:04:04] that he just wants your attention I'm
[1:04:09] sorry that I'm not able to be a great
[1:04:14] storyteller and I hope the kids are
[1:04:17] understanding this but to me this is a
[1:04:23] tremendous thing I know as a son I have
[1:04:29] a father and I remember
[1:04:32] and you can have a seat for the Bernie
[1:04:34] and thank you sister sister joy thank
[1:04:40] your brother Oscar I my father taught me
[1:04:44] to work a lot that's what my father well
[1:04:48] one of the things that he taught me and
[1:04:50] I really used to like to work I was
[1:04:57] there all the time
[1:04:59] and not realizing that there's some
[1:05:02] important things that Jesus wants us to
[1:05:06] be taking care of sometimes those things
[1:05:09] are at home with your family
[1:05:11] sometimes it's could be spending more
[1:05:16] time with brothers and sisters and and
[1:05:18] fellowshipping and and being part of the
[1:05:22] congregation as a real active member
[1:05:25] someone who who really engages and
[1:05:30] someone who participates in but
[1:05:34] sometimes we get really caught up in our
[1:05:36] work and but Jesus wants us to pay
[1:05:40] attention you know there are different
[1:05:48] things that we can suffer by you know
[1:05:51] our memory our reasoning our conscience
[1:05:55] our imagination our affections and we
[1:05:58] can let those take control of our daily
[1:06:04] lives sometimes we don't understand that
[1:06:10] we have to put those things to the side
[1:06:12] and focus to what's really needed and
[1:06:17] what what Jesus really wants from us you
[1:06:21] know to pay attention to what's going on
[1:06:23] you know sometimes as Christians as sons
[1:06:28] and daughters of God we can get hit and
[1:06:33] may be pushed around maybe even slapped
[1:06:39] around or whatnot by fellow members
[1:06:42] brothers or sisters
[1:06:44] and it just knocks us out of noxus out
[1:06:52] of in spanish is no soccer the key CEO
[1:06:55] you know it just takes us out of who we
[1:06:58] really are you know maybe we lose a
[1:07:05] loved one or maybe a loved one hurt us
[1:07:10] or something
[1:07:12] you know maybe a friend or something but
[1:07:17] in those moments Jesus wants us to focus
[1:07:23] on what really the bigger picture is you
[1:07:29] know in times like that
[1:07:32] if the love of God cannot be portrayed
[1:07:37] in our everyday lives and our everyday
[1:07:40] actions we can be slaves and enslaved to
[1:07:50] things that come to our memories things
[1:07:55] that come to our reasoning things that
[1:07:58] come to our conscience things that come
[1:08:02] into our imagination
[1:08:05] things that come in our affection we can
[1:08:10] become slaves to think things like that
[1:08:14] you know and that moment that Martha was
[1:08:18] cleaning and cooking and who knows what
[1:08:25] she was thinking but her actions showed
[1:08:28] what she was thinking in their mind her
[1:08:32] actions just proved that that's what she
[1:08:36] wanted to do she thought that was the
[1:08:38] correct thing to do for Jesus but really
[1:08:42] it as we see here in the word as we just
[1:08:46] read here that Jesus wanted something
[1:08:49] just a little bit more in reality he
[1:08:53] wanted a little
[1:08:54] less less of us doing something less of
[1:08:59] us trying to be someone less of us
[1:09:03] trying to prove that we're someone or
[1:09:08] that we can do something but to just be
[1:09:12] still and know that He is God you know
[1:09:17] there's a beautiful story that brother
[1:09:21] Branham talks about it just so happens
[1:09:25] to be the great-great great-grandfather
[1:09:29] of Sam here and Dante they had a great
[1:09:32] grandfather great-great
[1:09:34] great-grandfather and his name was Sam
[1:09:36] Bo I don't know if anyone's ever heard
[1:09:40] of the story before but back in the days
[1:09:45] when they had slavery there was this man
[1:09:50] by the name of and he worked on
[1:09:53] the plantation and on this plantation he
[1:09:57] would pick cotton every single day and
[1:10:01] there was many other workers that were
[1:10:04] there on the plantation and every once
[1:10:10] in a while they would get together as
[1:10:12] slaves and they would have a little
[1:10:15] Bible studying maybe sing some songs to
[1:10:20] try to pass the time because slavery is
[1:10:23] hard whether you're a slave to the
[1:10:29] master of the seat or whether you're a
[1:10:32] slave to Christ
[1:10:33] slavery is hard and as this man was
[1:10:43] partaking and one of these services I'm
[1:10:48] assuming that the Holy Spirit came down
[1:10:50] one time and it came not just upon his
[1:10:57] flesh
[1:10:59] it went through that body with these
[1:11:03] five senses of the hearing and scene and
[1:11:09] the feeling and the touching and the
[1:11:12] tasting it went past that it went deeper
[1:11:18] than that
[1:11:19] even further than the next area of what
[1:11:25] we called a triangle beam it went past
[1:11:28] the memories and it went past the
[1:11:31] imagination and their consciousness and
[1:11:34] the affections and the reasoning it went
[1:11:39] past that dimension and it reached his
[1:11:47] soul and when the Holy Spirit came and
[1:11:53] entered into his soul their faith was
[1:11:58] born in his heart he became a new man
[1:12:03] and assemble there on the plantation as
[1:12:08] a slave with all the other slave members
[1:12:13] around him he must have screamed out I'm
[1:12:19] free the Lord Jesus has made me free and
[1:12:28] I'm sure one of his fellow slave
[1:12:30] brothers or sisters might have said Shh
[1:12:33] don't say that too loud the slave owner
[1:12:41] might hear you but brother I'm free you
[1:12:46] don't know how I used to be before you
[1:12:51] don't know what kind of a man I was
[1:12:56] before today I'm free because the King
[1:13:02] of Kings the Prince of Peace has made me
[1:13:07] a free man
[1:13:10] and as the days went by that's all that
[1:13:15] he could say I'm free I'm free at last
[1:13:19] thank God I am free at last
[1:13:26] well rumor had it that it starts
[1:13:31] spreading around until it finally got to
[1:13:34] the slave owner and the slave owner
[1:13:39] I had heard this rumor he said that
[1:13:42] can't be true
[1:13:43] [Music]
[1:13:44] cannot be saying those things he
[1:13:49] knows that he's a slave and that I've
[1:13:53] been a good slave owner to him I must
[1:13:57] call him up and call to his attention
[1:14:00] attention in and to bring him in and
[1:14:03] talk to him so he probably called
[1:14:07] into his office or his house his room
[1:14:11] and started conversating with him and
[1:14:16] said sambal you know that I know that
[1:14:20] you're a good man he must have said yes
[1:14:24] master
[1:14:26] yes well the rumor is is that you've
[1:14:30] been telling everybody here and
[1:14:32] everybody knows it now because it's
[1:14:34] finally gotten to me that you're a free
[1:14:38] man
[1:14:39] you know you're a slave yes a
[1:14:43] master I I'm never gonna leave here oh
[1:14:46] I'll work for you always but the truth
[1:14:50] is master I am a free man because Jesus
[1:14:55] has made me free what I once was I am
[1:14:59] NOT now because Jesus has made me free
[1:15:05] so he must have asked him again assemble
[1:15:09] assemble you can't possibly believe that
[1:15:13] Oh master but it's true I'm sorry I
[1:15:18] don't mean to disrespect you
[1:15:21] but I am a free man because Jesus has
[1:15:26] said me free
[1:15:28] he said sample do you really believe
[1:15:31] that he said yes master he goes okay
[1:15:39] here you go
[1:15:40] and he gave him his freedom papers and
[1:15:46] as he walked away from the office or
[1:15:48] that house for that room he walked away
[1:15:53] not only a free man in this heart but
[1:15:58] legally on paper he was now a free man
[1:16:03] well that brother went on to be a
[1:16:05] preacher and he saved many souls in that
[1:16:09] village why black brown whoever wanted
[1:16:15] some saving he was there to preach to
[1:16:17] them you know sometimes as Christians
[1:16:24] hard-working Christians brothers and
[1:16:28] sisters in his gospel we can be slaves
[1:16:35] sometimes slaves to the thoughts and the
[1:16:39] imaginations to what we really believe
[1:16:42] in what we think in our heart is the
[1:16:45] right thing to do but when the Lord
[1:16:48] Jesus Christ comes into your heart not
[1:16:55] just over your body to where you and I
[1:16:59] see this as a living testimonial to
[1:17:03] where we just come to church and slave
[1:17:06] to those types of actions to where we
[1:17:11] maybe play the drums like the way I used
[1:17:14] to play and just show up to church or
[1:17:17] maybe song lead or or to go here and to
[1:17:21] go there but not really having that true
[1:17:25] experience in the heart because that's
[1:17:30] what Jesus wants
[1:17:32] he wants us to be able to take off those
[1:17:36] shackles those shackles of slavery to
[1:17:42] our imaginations to our senses of the
[1:17:47] body our senses of the spirits and he
[1:17:53] wants to go into the deepness of our
[1:17:57] hearts to wear a real change comes into
[1:18:05] where we become slaves of love so then
[1:18:11] when a brother comes and maybe he scolds
[1:18:15] you he says brother you know this and
[1:18:20] this should be this and that's the Bible
[1:18:23] says so and in your heart you say thank
[1:18:28] you brother and I love you thank you
[1:18:33] sister I love you
[1:18:37] it's very hard sometimes to look at the
[1:18:41] big picture as Mary did but if we can
[1:18:48] just be still and know that He is God
[1:18:52] and that he just wants to have domain of
[1:18:58] all our senses physically mentally
[1:19:03] spiritually
[1:19:05] to where he dwells in her heart would
[1:19:13] you stand with me please I hope this
[1:19:18] wasn't too serious of a topic and the
[1:19:24] Lord knows all things but as we close
[1:19:29] our eyes and we pray to the Lord
[1:19:35] if there's anyone here child adult
[1:19:43] uncle auntie brother sister grandpa or
[1:19:50] grandma that would ask that the Lord
[1:19:55] would come and make them a love slave
[1:20:01] slave to their word that you would raise
[1:20:05] up your hand and say Lord I accept you
[1:20:10] Lord Jesus
[1:20:11] I've been enslaved too long to the
[1:20:17] things of the world Lord Father the
[1:20:21] master of the seat has been a good
[1:20:27] adversary and he's lied to me long
[1:20:30] enough but I want to cry out in my heart
[1:20:35] I'm free I'm free thank God I am free so
[1:20:44] those things of the world to that type
[1:20:46] of slavery we asked Lord Jesus that you
[1:20:50] would make us slaves to you Lord father
[1:20:54] so that don't matter what your word said
[1:20:58] to do what your Holy Spirit directed us
[1:21:01] to going to be likened to act like
[1:21:06] regardless of their hurt or it didn't
[1:21:10] hurt Lord Jesus that we would just be
[1:21:13] still Lord Father except your word and
[1:21:17] our horse
[1:21:19] for we wish to be your slave Lord Jesus
[1:21:23] we want to be your prisoners Lord Father
[1:21:26] those that had lived there enhances
[1:21:29] evening Lord Jesus may you reward them
[1:21:33] Lord Jesus foot for what they're asking
[1:21:38] for lower father and the precious name
[1:21:41] of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you
[1:21:44] Amen can you give brother Benji a round
[1:21:47] of applause please
