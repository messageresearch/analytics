[1:12:05] preach
[1:12:08] it I we' be here for two
[1:12:11] hours so all I'm doing is presenting to
[1:12:13] you these
[1:12:17] topics if you're not paying
[1:12:20] attention if you follow the line of
[1:12:22] thought
[1:12:26] you'll
[1:12:27] understand if you're just listening and
[1:12:30] then
[1:12:33] hearing and then just hearing and then
[1:12:36] then go back to
[1:12:39] listening you're going to compare what
[1:12:41] you were listening to what you were
[1:12:45] listening and it's not going to make any
[1:12:48] sense yet you were hearing it all the
[1:12:52] time
[1:12:54] that make sense a little
[1:12:56] bit Okay Mother's Day uh
[1:13:00] message God bless God bless every mother
[1:13:04] that's here this
[1:13:08] morning in Isaiah 4915 and 16 it says
[1:13:12] the following it says
[1:13:14] um so I will to some of
[1:13:18] you uh as I start reading right
[1:13:21] now I say God bless you shake hands out
[1:13:26] there I know that I've will lose some of
[1:13:29] you as soon as I start
[1:13:33] reading and uh that that is not a slam
[1:13:36] on any on
[1:13:38] anybody that is natural that's normal
[1:13:41] human that's normal human
[1:13:44] behavior brother bernish has said it
[1:13:46] brother Paul has said
[1:13:48] it that as soon as you start
[1:13:51] reading some people go
[1:13:54] click is that right brother
[1:13:57] Paul used to say that
[1:14:01] click um just give you a
[1:14:06] contrast to
[1:14:08] Brazil when I was in
[1:14:10] Brazil and they would get a book of
[1:14:12] brother
[1:14:15] BR they may be 50%
[1:14:19] listening as soon soon as he would
[1:14:22] say the
[1:14:25] prophet and then every 90% 95% of the
[1:14:29] people
[1:14:31] just tune
[1:14:34] in and many times here in the United
[1:14:40] States like brother Paul and brother
[1:14:42] Bernie have
[1:14:43] said I'm going to read to
[1:14:47] you yeah people turn off their listening
[1:14:50] device that's okay but that's why I say
[1:14:52] I'm not being sarcastic when I
[1:14:54] say I'm just saying goodbye to those
[1:14:56] that
[1:14:59] are so go ahead tune out I'm not you're
[1:15:02] not going to hurt my
[1:15:06] feelings the only person that hurt my
[1:15:08] feelings was last
[1:15:12] Sunday he's not here right
[1:15:14] now so I guess I can talk about
[1:15:17] him be a nice American and talk about
[1:15:21] him and that's brother Emilio
[1:15:25] perz because you know I told him outside
[1:15:29] you we have a good sense of humor we
[1:15:31] have a good report with each
[1:15:33] other and I said to him you hurt my
[1:15:36] feelings you
[1:15:38] know I was singing and you you walked
[1:15:42] out he says as soon as I got up and
[1:15:44] started walking out I knew you you know
[1:15:46] I knew that I knew you I knew you might
[1:15:48] think
[1:15:52] that and that's so that's something that
[1:15:55] um I learned from Brother
[1:15:58] green I many heard brother green say
[1:16:00] that he says if I'm preaching and you
[1:16:03] walk out I don't
[1:16:07] care like brother Brown said that just
[1:16:09] shows your
[1:16:12] ignorance brother green said but if you
[1:16:15] walk out when I'm
[1:16:18] singing then you hurt my
[1:16:21] feelings so I as long as you're sitting
[1:16:25] there you're not going to hurt my
[1:16:26] feelings if you turn
[1:16:29] off okay so let's get a reading because
[1:16:32] I'm just gonna I'm going to try to read
[1:16:35] only and if I do that the if the Lord
[1:16:38] help me do that we'll have a successful
[1:16:41] Sunday school lesson this
[1:16:44] morning I'll get off my
[1:16:47] hands I've had for about three weeks
[1:16:52] now
[1:16:54] last night I was asked are you
[1:16:57] nervous I could hardly wait till
[1:17:02] today because I want to hear what this I
[1:17:05] want to hear this
[1:17:09] also Isaiah
[1:17:11] 49:15 can a woman forget her sucking
[1:17:13] child that she should not have
[1:17:16] compassion on the son of her womb yay
[1:17:18] they may forget yet will I not forget
[1:17:22] you
[1:17:32] behold I have Graven you upon the palms
[1:17:35] of my hands your walls are continually
[1:17:38] before
[1:17:45] me that's beautiful scripture now Psalms
[1:17:48] chapter
[1:17:50] 8 scripture my dad used to read a lot
[1:17:54] and my grandpa
[1:17:56] Garcia verses three and four says when I
[1:17:59] consider your Heavens the work of your
[1:18:03] fingers the moon and the stars which you
[1:18:06] have
[1:18:14] ordained what is man that you are
[1:18:16] mindful of him and the son of man that
[1:18:19] you visit
[1:18:21] him
[1:18:27] our talk our title this
[1:18:30] morning is we are in Jehovah's
[1:18:35] hands we are in Jehovah's
[1:18:39] hands you were you were in his
[1:18:43] mind
[1:18:46] sh I'll just say like
[1:18:49] this maybe I'll summarize everything I
[1:18:51] wish I could preach
[1:18:54] but that
[1:18:55] God that created the heavens and the
[1:18:59] Earth these are products of his
[1:19:04] fingers he took
[1:19:07] you a little part from the feminine
[1:19:11] side from the masculine
[1:19:15] side and he United him
[1:19:17] together and then he started knitting
[1:19:21] him
[1:19:24] I know that's not that's not science
[1:19:27] scientific the way they said but the
[1:19:28] Bible says covered
[1:19:32] me in Psalms there 139 I think I'm not
[1:19:37] sure but it's
[1:19:41] knitting it's a mystery how God in the

[1:35:34] them and he's saying the Lord bless you
[1:35:37] and keep
[1:35:40] you you understand what I'm saying
[1:35:43] because he told the

[1:36:27] it I'll be
[1:36:29] quiet and it came to
[1:36:31] pass while he blessed
[1:36:34] them departed from them and carried up
[1:36:37] into
[1:36:43] heaven Lord have
[1:36:48] mercy help me
[1:36:50] Lord our thought of this morning
[1:36:54] is and I want him to say it exactly in
[1:36:59] English but he can interpret it I want
[1:37:02] to say in English
[1:37:03] first and I want you to repeat after
[1:37:06] me one of our thoughts this
[1:37:10] morning is God bless you God bless
[1:37:16] you praise God can you all say God bless
[1:37:19] you God bless you
[1:37:22] thank you
[1:37:24] graas thank you very
[1:37:29] much if you've never if you've been here
[1:37:32] for
[1:37:34] years and youve never you don't like
[1:37:36] speaking English that's okay I forgive
[1:37:40] you but I would like love for
[1:37:45] you to at least learn how to say these
[1:37:49] three
[1:37:50] words
[1:37:53] and say them in
[1:37:56] English especially after you understand
[1:37:58] what they
[1:38:01] mean God bless
[1:38:04] you let's find out what that
[1:38:10] means brother BR says the following so
[1:38:13] many things I could say but I say God
[1:38:15] bless you
[1:38:18] all I think that's the greatest word can
[1:38:20] be
[1:38:25] if God will bless me that's all I
[1:38:28] want is that right if God will bless
[1:38:33] me that's
[1:38:35] enough that's all I care
[1:38:40] for what's the greatest word that one
[1:38:42] man could say to
[1:38:47] another God Bless
[1:38:49] you that's it if God will bless me
[1:38:53] that's the best thing I can
[1:38:55] have that's all I
[1:38:57] want God to bless
[1:39:00] me the rest of it it's all
[1:39:05] right so God bless
[1:39:08] you is the best thing that I can
[1:39:12] say and I'm sure if he will do
[1:39:17] that we'll all meet
[1:39:20] again
[1:39:23] someday see somebody told me one
[1:39:26] time maybe that's a tertiary or four or
[1:39:30] five levels down of
[1:39:36] understanding of what he said
[1:39:39] here because I've looked for it I
[1:39:40] haven't found it
[1:39:42] yet but I was told that brother bam
[1:39:46] said that God bless God bless
[1:39:49] you man I'll see you in the
[1:39:53] resurrection maybe he said that to
[1:39:55] somebody not
[1:39:58] tape but I can see that it's that
[1:40:02] context I'll see you in the
[1:40:06] resurrection right there because if God
[1:40:09] God if God blesses
[1:40:11] you God
[1:40:15] truly if
[1:40:17] God
[1:40:19] truly blesses you
[1:40:23] we'll get to that what does it really
[1:40:25] mean
[1:40:27] bless if God really blesses
[1:40:30] you you'll be in the
[1:40:34] resurrection I'll be in the
[1:40:36] resurrection If He blesses
[1:40:38] me and then we'll see each
[1:40:46] other so let's continue with our Sunday
[1:40:48] school
[1:40:49] lesson thank you he's talking to the to
[1:40:52] the
[1:40:53] church thank you for your
[1:40:55] kindness for the offerings and for all
[1:40:58] you've
[1:41:00] done and I don't know how to say any
[1:41:02] more than God bless
[1:41:06] you and to me that's the greatest word
[1:41:08] there
[1:41:10] is God will bless
[1:41:12] me everything else will be all
[1:41:15] right as long as God blesses
[1:41:19] me says wife and I and the children want
[1:41:22] to
[1:41:24] tell thanks so much it's so little but
[1:41:28] I'll say
[1:41:30] this this is the greatest word that I
[1:41:32] think anyone could
[1:41:36] say there nothing could be any
[1:41:41] greater so brother randam in summary and
[1:41:46] and said the
[1:41:49] following God bless you
[1:41:52] say God bless you God bless you thank
[1:41:56] you it's the greatest
[1:41:58] word the greatest word there
[1:42:01] is the best thing that I can
[1:42:04] say this is the greatest word I think
[1:42:07] anyone could
[1:42:12] say God bless
[1:42:17] you God bless you God bless you WHat
[1:42:21] does bless mean
[1:42:24] bless that that is that a good
[1:42:28] question I mean the kids are saying
[1:42:31] right you gonna go I'm GNA
[1:42:37] go would you tell the rest of the people
[1:42:39] what it means
[1:42:44] brother how many know what I
[1:42:47] means it out all right all
[1:42:51] right see somebody comes up with a word
[1:42:54] a
[1:42:55] word all every word has an orig or
[1:43:00] origin we're g to find out where bless
[1:43:02] comes
[1:43:05] from how many now say
[1:43:08] Bye
[1:43:11] by you're just saying be ye the letter b
[1:43:15] and y e or
[1:43:19] U
[1:43:23] or not
[1:43:26] but but it used to
[1:43:29] be God and good were written the
[1:43:34] same in English so they would write
[1:43:39] good good good good g o d good good b b
[1:43:45] e e
[1:43:48] b with
[1:43:51] Ye
[1:43:53] Ye how many of you wonder why by is
[1:43:55] written with a Y sometimes and sometimes
[1:43:57] a y e and
[1:44:03] it's then as we naturally humans get a
[1:44:07] little
[1:44:11] lazy people start writing in the
[1:44:16] letters b
[1:44:19] apostrophe apostrophe apost
[1:44:24] AP uh w w
[1:44:28] aphe
[1:44:30] good
[1:44:34] good finally they just started writing
[1:44:41] good we got
[1:44:45] lazy and then they started pronouncing
[1:44:47] it
[1:44:49] differently
[1:44:52] goodbye
[1:44:55] goodbye that's where we get go
[1:44:58] goodbye
[1:45:02] goodbye and that's something else that's
[1:45:05] how boring my classes
[1:45:09] were if you heard a thumb back there
[1:45:11] somebody bump in their head
[1:45:15] then I would ask him I said how many of
[1:45:17] you kids think that that sounds so
[1:45:20] religious right some are religious
[1:45:26] right sounds so religious
[1:45:29] right yes or
[1:45:32] yes I said but we have an
[1:45:36] equivalent in English except we don't
[1:45:39] know that so I would teach him English
[1:45:42] too and I take that long boring lecture
[1:45:47] that you just heard right
[1:45:49] now but every word every I was going to
[1:45:54] say stinking
[1:45:57] word yeah it is because it comes from
[1:45:59] Babylon right
[1:46:01] confusion
[1:46:04] language it's not a Heavenly it's not a
[1:46:06] Heavenly language we
[1:46:08] speak this is this is
[1:46:11] Babylon confusion of
[1:46:15] languages yes or
[1:46:18] yes but bless
[1:46:21] bless starts off
[1:46:24] somewhere and that's what I think we
[1:46:26] should we want to look at
[1:46:28] it God bless
[1:46:31] you what does what does bless WHat does
[1:46:34] bless mean bless well it comes from
[1:46:37] because English is a Germanic
[1:46:40] language and it's the old
[1:46:43] English bless blessed blesson blon it
[1:46:48] means to consecrate make holy give
[1:46:50] thanks
[1:46:53] but
[1:46:54] originally from the early
[1:46:59] Germanic the the Primitive one the
[1:47:03] earlier
[1:47:05] one that word blood
[1:47:11] bless are you starting to see blood in
[1:47:13] there
[1:47:17] now and and it mean it meant
[1:47:26] to to mark with
[1:47:31] blood from its root blood thumb
[1:47:36] blood originally a blood sprinkling on
[1:47:39] Pagan
[1:47:44] altars but where did they get it
[1:47:47] from I'm not going to ask you for an
[1:47:48] amen just raise your hand how many have
[1:47:51] heard our pastor referring to brother
[1:47:54] bram's message or in the message of
[1:47:56] brother
[1:47:58] Bram where brother brandham says that
[1:48:02] Abel
[1:48:03] died on the same
[1:48:06] altar that he sacrificed his
[1:48:10] lamb a few of you thank you that's what
[1:48:13] he said so it all goes back to
[1:48:18] Genesis is that beautiful
[1:48:21] that beautiful the way our Bible starts
[1:48:25] off the
[1:48:27] beginning the
[1:48:29] Genesis the
[1:48:31] gene that's the first
[1:48:34] one and then it ends
[1:48:37] with the
[1:48:40] unveiling the
[1:48:43] Revelation I love this book love the
[1:48:47] Bible is it awesome
[1:48:52] and that transition between the New
[1:48:53] Testament and the Old
[1:48:57] Testament he kind of yells at you and he
[1:48:59] says behold will send you the
[1:49:03] prophet there the very middle right
[1:49:05] there when
[1:49:08] heop beautiful
[1:49:12] book read
[1:49:14] it I
[1:49:17] suggested I know you
[1:49:19] do I Christians read the Bible and pray
[1:49:22] every
[1:49:27] day
[1:49:29] so
[1:49:31] bless
[1:49:33] bless or God bless you oh God bless you
[1:49:37] you're really saying to
[1:49:40] somebody may God consecrate
[1:49:46] you wow amen we could just see if a few
[1:49:50] songs go
[1:49:53] home God bless
[1:49:55] you may God make you
[1:50:05] holy may God Hollow you with
[1:50:13] blood may God Mark you with
[1:50:19] blood
[1:50:20] yes I know it's not the blood
[1:50:22] anymore
[1:50:24] BL chemistry of the blood
[1:50:27] anymore that was in the
[1:50:31] blood but we're talking about the word
[1:50:35] bless
[1:50:39] bless and all that goes along that goes
[1:50:42] along with
[1:50:44] it the life that was in the
[1:50:48] blood so let's say like
[1:50:51] that may
[1:50:54] God put the life that was in the
[1:50:58] blood in
[1:51:00] you that's what you're saying when
[1:51:02] you're saying
[1:51:05] godess bless
[1:51:07] you I think anyway I think that's what
[1:51:11] it
[1:51:13] means
[1:51:16] so you can study young people study what
[1:51:19] the word best means that's
[1:51:21] awesome
[1:51:23] Jus as
[1:51:26] Bethy and then when he did he lifted up
[1:51:29] his
[1:51:32] hands and he blessed
[1:51:35] them
[1:51:37] wow and it came to pass while he blessed
[1:51:40] them he was parted from them and carried
[1:51:42] up into
[1:51:47] heaven and I think it's a great
[1:51:49] coronation
[1:51:51] of the Full
[1:51:52] Gospel is the
[1:51:54] resurrection I'm not
[1:51:57] bragging but I really never paid
[1:51:59] attention to Mother's
[1:52:01] Day to the message of brother BR
[1:52:04] preached I've heard maybe eight or 12
[1:52:08] times I recommend it to young
[1:52:11] people I was
[1:52:13] shocked
[1:52:15] con Mother's
[1:52:17] Day that's got to be wrong
[1:52:20] anyway with the
[1:52:22] resurrection
[1:52:25] anyway the great coronation of the full
[1:52:28] of the Full Gospel is the
[1:52:32] resurrection and it Divine
[1:52:34] promises and the consolation that it
[1:52:36] gives those who are trusting in
[1:52:39] it for it promises the great Union of
[1:52:42] our uniting together
[1:52:48] again why
[1:52:50] sure it's the Cardinal resting place of
[1:52:54] the
[1:52:58] Gospel no matter what he
[1:53:00] did he did not raise again from the
[1:53:04] dead all it was in vain to me it to me
[1:53:09] proves that he was
[1:53:12] God proves every claim he
[1:53:16] made the
[1:53:18] resurrection and it's also the place of
[1:53:20] the resting of the
[1:53:22] Soul it's the starting
[1:53:25] point it's the
[1:53:27] crowning of our
[1:53:30] consolation
[1:53:33] wow and the next uh the same one okay I
[1:53:38] think I may have put two slides in I
[1:53:39] apologize for that but in the likeness
[1:53:41] here's the same message in the likeness
[1:53:44] and beauty of the
[1:53:46] Resurrection he's talking about the the
[1:53:48] the mother's
[1:53:50] your mother raises from the
[1:53:52] dead they'll stand in the likeness of
[1:53:56] Christ their celestial
[1:53:59] bodies beautiful
[1:54:02] forever sir that's the
[1:54:05] rest read everybody read this with me in
