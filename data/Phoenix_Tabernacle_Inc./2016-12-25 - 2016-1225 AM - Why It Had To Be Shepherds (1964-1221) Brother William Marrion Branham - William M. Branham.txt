world today you are God's wrapped gift for this age now is my honor and my privilege [Music] to introduce to you God's Prophet seventh angel messenger God's voice to us in this age malakiah 45 and6 it reads like this behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great Dreadful day of the [Music] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse the Bible here tells us if he wouldn't send Elijah that he would Smite the Earth with a curse but thank God he sent Elijah Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 and is my honor and my privilege to introduce to you the speaker for today is God's Prophet for our time William Mar and Bram William Mar and Bram I believe the this speaker that we're have today the last speaker for this [Music] year I believe with all my heart he is the greatest speaker we've had all year I I'm not making any less the other brothers but this is the greatest speaker known to us he said he said I am God's mouthpiece to this generation I leave you with Brother Bram the message why it had to be Shepherds preached by William Ari and brandham brember 1st 1964 may the Lord richly bless you today I guess kind of a long winded uh preacher and without education I I guess I don't sound much like a preacher to some people and I I don't even claim to be a preacher I just kind of a spare tire but I feel that I have a message from God that in my way that only way I had to present it I'm trying to present it to the world and if I didn't stay with that message I'd be a traitor to God and a hypocrite to you a person that will say one thing and believe another it's hypocrisy we must always speak the truth from our heart that when people look upon us even though they disagree with us we want to be hon men and women that we speak from our heart that which is true in our hearts last year or year before last I had the privilege of speaking a a Christian or pardon me a Christmas message here at the Remar and I believe I spoke on the subject they here our Phoenix on a why little Bethlehem and I believe then it was sure last year I spoke on we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him and you know we you read the Bible and we wonder those wi and tonight I thought if you would bear with me a while and pray with me I would try to give you my Christmas message God only knows where we'll be next Christmas if there is a next Christmas after this so being that this might be the last Christmas we sit together until we sit at another table it will not be one of this type but it will be when we eat and drink the communion a new with him in the father's Kingdom at the end of the road and then let us approach it tonight as if this was the last Christmas me message we'd ever set together in in the deepness of sincerity I want to speak tonight on an unusual subject but sometimes you find God in the unusual things he does things in an unusual way not the usual way it's the unusual way unusual times unusual seems he unusual and I want this Lord willing on to speak on the subject of why it had to be Shepherd and now just before we approach the word which I believe that is God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us I said last week a week before last at Phoenix it's proven that there is subjects of this Earth people passing through this building now television proves that it's in another dimension our natural eyes and our five senses cannot pick that up it isn't that television manufactures anything it only channels you cannot make a move with your finger you cannot bat your eye but it's proven to be recorded forever I might be standing or a man in Australia would have a a television screen here not only that but the the man could speak move his finger bat his eye or even the color clothing that he's wearing would be projected here on the wall and he in Africa Australia around the world see there is a cycle of ether waves I cannot explain it but I know it's there I don't think anyone could really explain it so this television can pull this in and make it a reality by some instruments that they can reflect it on the wall now that same thing was here when Adam was here television was here when when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel it was here when Martin Luther that young priest soow the communion on the floor and said it's kosha and the just shall live of faith it was share then but we are just now finding it and it's also so that in our presence tonight is God angels supernatural beings that's unseen to our natural sense of sight but someday it'll be a reality just as television is now and just as common now that's why I believe the word Jesus said whosoever shall add one word to this Bible or take one word out of it his part will be taken out of the book of life so let us bow our heads then before we even read it so solemn any man that's got physical strength could turn back the page but only God can reveal and with our heads bowed now towards the dust from which we were taken and someday shall return I wondering in this solemn moment as we're approaching Christmas if there is some here that really feel unworthy and would like to be remembered in this prayer would you with without raising your head just raise your hands to God and say Remember Me Lord this Christmas God bless you most holy and gracious heavenly father almighty God he that was from the beginning before there was a star or a atom or a molecule you made all things by Jesus Christ your son and has given us all things freely in him we thank thee tonight Lord for this opportunity that you have given us to assemble ourselves together to be warned and taught by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit takes your words and reveals them to us for Jesus said when he the spirit of Truth has come he will remind you of these things that I have said and also show you things to come God there is not one in our midst neither is there one upon the Earth who is worthy to try to interpret your word for it is written that the word of God is of no private interpretation therefore Lord we pray that the holy spirit will give to us tonight each and every one the potion that we need to satisfy that hunger that's in our heart heart for a closer walk with thee we are unfit unclean unworthy let the child that was born in Bethlehem that lived the most perfect life and was the only perfect man up on the earth and gave himself a ransom that he might cleanse us unclean Sinners and to bring us into relationship with the father Grant tonight that his holy spirit through the preaching of the word will do that for us Lord God there is many sick in the land today in the face of the best medicine that we ever doctored with and the best medicine and the best hospitals and yet in all of our great scientific discoveries yet there is more sickness in the world every because there's more sin in unb belief in the world ever need help us tonight great physici and heal the sick that's in our midst and give us the spirit the true Spirit of Christmas when today that when Pagan ceremonies Christmas trees worship fiction stories of a a man named Santa Claus and of our Easter rabbits and the different fashions that the commercial world has capitalized on may it be laid aside God let us enter into Christ the word for we asked it in his name and for his glory amen if you will turn with me for a reading in the Holy RIT St Luke the 2 chapter can you hear me all right is there any transposition in the microphones can you hear me in the back all right if you can raise your hand thank you the second chapter of The Gospel According to St Luke and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar austa that all the world should be taxed and this tax was first made known it was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed every one to his own country and Joseph also went up From Galilee into the city of Nazareth into Judea the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while she was there the days of her accomplishment that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in the manger because there was no room for them in the end and there was in the same country Shepherd abiding in the fields keeping watch over their flocks By Night Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring Good Tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in wadling clothes laying in a manger and suddenly there was yeah and suddenly there with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace good well toward man and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us go now even even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord has made known unto us and they came in haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in the manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pounded them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen as it was told unto them may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word now it's uh why this great even event was revealed to Shepherds that would be kind of an astounding thing for us I have some scriptures written here and a few notes that I will try to run over to explain to you why to the best of my knowledge and maybe then after this that the Lord with his grace tonight will take the wise away from us but did most all of us I suppose at one time or other has wondered why that this greatest event of all times was revealed to Shepherds why was it revealed to Shepherds and not to the theologians of that day they were the one were trained to hear it and why did it come and bypass the rich and come to the poor also why did it bypass the learned and wise and come to the humble and unlearned there is a few questions of why in this and another reason I might say notice the babe was born in Bethlehem which Bethlehem in the Hebrew interpretation as we had a couple years ago here Beth hem means the house of God's bread and we proved in the scriptures he could not come any other place Bethlehem was founded by Rahab and her uh her husband Rahab was a harlot that a general courted from the the uh Israelite Army after they had taken uh Jericho and by faith she believed the message of God in her condition and she was saved and from there when Joshua divided up the lands of where each one would be and there's a great lesson that sometime I hope to be able to bring a Tucson of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies when she graned at the birth pain of the baby she called the name of the baby and that positionally placed it in the promised land its tribe a great thing all the word of God fits right together if doesn't fit together it's not God's word is Misfit it's your thought is misfitting to the word it all fits together so then he was the bread of life as we taught last week in Phoenix or week before last and being the bread of life he could come no place else but the house of God's bread and that was the why now here Jesus is born in Bethlehem and in Bethlehem there was Sy God great religious leaders lived in Bethlehem David the great king shepherd was born in Bethlehem his father Jess was born in Bethlehem his grandfather oit was born in Bethlehem also all the way back he came from Bethlehem and here Jesus the son of David is born in Bethlehem right under the shadows of the great Cathedrals then if those people are trained and have been looking for the Messiah for all these years 4,000 years the Messiah had been prophesied to come and then if the Messiah be born in the shadow of the cathedral why did they have to go plum back up mountains to a bunch of unlearned un to bring the great me Shepherds not the wise and it's a strange thing is but there's got to be a white somewhere there is a why now there's got to be an answer why and no man knows the answer save God he's the one that knows the answer now remember the Messiah was already in the city BN in the city in a stable right by the great Cathedrals where the and the theologians and the wise trained all was there waiting for the Messiah and there he was right in their [Music] midst but why then did they go to the out on the hills of Judea to unlearned untrained uncultured poorest of all look like the most unfit person for such a task to reveal the message and send them out to bring the message you know my opinion it might not Mount to very much but I want to pass my opinion I believe it's because of the wisdom of God that he knew they wouldn't receive such a message the way it come it wasn't in the taste of their learning it was different it wasn't what they had been trained to believe he would be like it was contrary to their theological understanding all their training all their learning was bypassed become not I believe it was the wisdom of God that knew that they would receive such a message so the Messiah was here and there must be somebody recognizing and he knew those who hadn't been mixed up and such stuff as that he would be more able to get his message to an unlearned group than he would be to a mixed up group that was so set in their ways that nothing could turn them not even the word of God and now Christian friends let me ask this question With all sincerity and love I just wonder if he would make the same act tonight and send to us in this generation the promis word that's promised for this generation I wonder if our theologians and Educators and wise wouldn't turn the message down just the same as they did then man doesn't change amen neither does God's word change he's the unchanging God he doesn't change notice Angels coming and H Angels coming and giving their message to man of such low a state when there were a man there much more Earthly thought of qualified in these poor illiterate Shepherds the shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody he didn't need to know nothing but just about his sheep he didn't need to know mathematics he didn't need to know how to to split an atom he didn't need no scholarship he just had to know his sheep that's all that he needed to know and God the great wisdom and the fountain and resource of all wisdom would choose such a person as that persons rather as that and bypass all the well Tred Scholars that's trained to know that it speaks one thing that they were trained in the wrong field passing up all the Imp important of the Land There were important people great teachers keas is the high priest many other great men all Israel's Mighty learned all the denominations and all the boasting theologians God bypassed every one of them am uh that's God's wisdom notice the highest Heavens Hasting to honor Earth's most humble and unlearned the highest of Heavens came down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make yourself known the common herdsman coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message Of All Times there had been many great Messengers we' think of the Noah's day and the prophets and and the great priest and so forth they been in the Days Gone By the Great learned man Kings potent takes monarchs but here he comes with the greatest of all the messages what was the message Messiah is here now and to make that known he bypassed all the train to make it known to Humble Shepherds think of it all all of the clergymen all of the churchmen all of the teachers all of the the theological training all the money had been spent all the churches and the doctrines and the denominations was all bypassed all the learning if they had spent on all the all the missionaries and all the priting all the membership and everything that they had thought they had done honor to God yet the key message of all of it was bypassed from them strange why see and notice not only that but the most unlikely place for such an event the sh message was in the most unlikely Jesus I wonder if it would be in an unlik a a high cultured world in the church to a bunch of of oh Heretics I wonder if that wouldn't be where we'd find him the most unlikely place and to the most unqualified speakers Shepherds know nothing about speaking only calling sheep but maybe that's why it comes but it was a promised word notice it could do that again it bypassed all the Nobles of the land it bypassed all the Nobles and was revealed to the no bodies all the Nobles that were decorated with with great doctors Divinity and and psychology and and highly uh educations and great Cathedrals and things it was all bypassed and revealed to no bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of almighty God did it to make known to them the greatest message ever was the Messiah is now on Earth what a wisdom could only come from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom and all of the schooling and everything was now laid to waste and byass by the great wisdom of God I keep repeating that because I want it to go down deep all laid the waste it was of no good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom have the right away that God takes the nothings to make the something we could stop here and speak of John we could stop and speak of Elijah nobody knows where Elijah come from all you know he just appeared on the scene the prophets they were nobody but God CH them and bypass the ethics of the church to make sure that he is God he takes something that's nothing to do something with it he shows his wisdom and his godhead by doing so that he takes the nothings when he first made a man he just took a ball of clay and made a man out of it where it was nothing but clay but he made a man God takes the nothing's now to do the something's with and as long as we think we're something and we cannot be used in the hand of God we must forsake all we ever knew or learn pardon me like the great St Paul he said he had to forget all he ever learned that he might know Christ all their schooling all their teachings and so forth was working out to the worst for them it finally denied him the very schooling that they had had for him to believe him turned around and become his most critical enemy and crucified him do you know that history repeats itself ever so often it's a noted fact it could happen again right by the side of us or you say if I live then well if you want to know what you'd have done then look at your present State now and you can see what you'd have done then because it certainly is revealing train to believe his word and then when his word was Vindicated before their very eyes they denied the word that was made Vindication am when God proved what he would do and said what he would do and proved what he would do then they turned around and called this man an evil spirit which cursed them all amen think of what taking place think of what caus them their training caus them not to recognize the very word made flesh for their day the very training that they had in their schools with the very best of teachers and you say well we wouldn't do that today their teachers were far Supreme to our today Superior to our teachers and they failed they didn't have 996 different organizations as we have today they had about three and in the Three Bottle down to three and none of the three recognized it this goes to show that What man does is foolishness to God now they fail to recognize it now and they do the same thing again man intention is good it always is good and man never changes his posture he never changes his ways much I'm talking to the man of the world man is always praising God religious man for what he done and always pointing people to what he's going to do and then ignoring what he's doing see that's just man he's made that way he's always been that way and you Bible readers tonight know that that's according to the word right they're always praising God for what he has done saying what he will do and ignoring what he's doing that's just the habit of man the reason that they had did this the teachers to my opinion now they had interpreted the word because they all believed in a coming Messiah all Israel believed it they do yet today but the reason that they didn't recognized him his message wasn't according to their ecclesiastical fit they uh the the interpretation that they had of the word the Messiah never manifested himself in the way that they had interpreted that he would do it so and therefore they did not recognize him because it didn't fit their interpretation as I've said before and say again God doesn't need anybody to interpret his word he is his own interpreter now the Bible says let me prove to you now that that is the truth Isaiah the prophet 715 years before this happened Isaiah the prophet said a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a child there's no doubt that everyone in that age thought their daughter would be that woman because Isaiah said it but you see it was 700 years later but when God didn't need anybody to interpret his word when he'll do it or how he would do it he said he would do it and he did it amen God promised that he over in Isaiah also I'll read the 28th chapter about the 18th verse and also in Joel 228 that in the last days the last 2,000 years he had pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh he said your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young man shall see Visions your old man shall dream dreams and the things that he would do Isaiah said with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest but they wouldn't hear it they waged their heads and walked by it he said all the tables of God would become full of vomit and there would be nothing clean and if that isn't a picture of Jerusalem and the Church of that day at the coming Messiah it's a picture today the same it's just repeating itself now when God says he'll do a thing he did it regardless of what anybody else thinks about it what anybody says when God speaks to something he's Duty bound to interpret that word himself and his in Vindication of the word is his own interpretation notice vindicating his messiah's message he promised what the Messiah would do when he come and when he came even when the wise men in the East had looked down south Westward from where they were at in Babylon and they saw a Majestic Star did you know there's not a speck of History nowhere that any Observatory where they even kept the the uh the time by stars great man who studied these Stars there's not no history says that any of them seen that star at all why it wasn't given to them they wasn't looking for such but these wise men know that there would be a star of Jacob rise amen and they were looking for it and it passed from the time that Jesus was born in Bethlehem now I know our Christian Traditions it's just like our churches it has things Topsy turby you go out here and you see wise men coming to worship a baby there's not such a thing in the scripture two years later they got there coming down through the Plains and across the Tigers River they never come to worship an infant but a young child amen about about 2 years old why was it at the same time Herod slew all the children from 2 years old under that he might catch the Messiah you see they God had Vindicated by his word and when these wise men came to Jerusalem the star LED them to the religious capital of the world Jerusalem and as soon as they entered those Gates that star the supernatural that had led them refused to show them anymore up and down the streets these fine man rich man with fine great camels and so forth up and down the street saying where is this Barn King of the Jews we saw a star in the east and that great religious Capital after two years of the shepherd's message still didn't have the answer and know nothing about it the head of all the denominations amen didn't have the answer so it Disturbed the Sanhedrin and they called for the scribes to come read and they read Micah's story The Prophet which said thou Bethlehem art thou not the least of all the princes of Judah the least but out of the shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel and after the scriptures being read and still being Vindicated Before Their Eyes they still didn't accept it though the scripture said so I doubt very much they would today if the scriptures that's promised for this day would be made manifest I may never preach to you again but I want you to get this still they wouldn't believe the great wisdom of the father makes man's Wisdom so foolish that he belittles the man he actually comes to the place the work makes man feel so ashamed of him self and he's not rather proves that is true and he's doing just what he through in every age still does it see how whole matter was now what down to speak to herdsman coming to speak to Shepherd I wonder of of talking with a Shepherd like to say it because of my uh remark I'm fixing to say after a while but the Shepherd stays with the Sheep so much until he even laughs like the Sheep blatant he talks like the sheep and he smells like the Sheep that's right because he's with the Sheep that's all he knows is his sheep now the vindictive word of Truth when these Shepherds humble uneducated man what a honor how fitting it is to a Shepherd to receive a message of a newborn Sheep amen it could come to nothing else but a Shepherd that's why he was born in a stable and not in a house sheep or not born in a house or in a pink decorated hospital room see they are born in the barn in in the fields that's the reason he was led to Calvary you can't not make a sheep Walk The Gang way to the slaughter did you know that in the slaughter yards they have a goat that leads the sheep and when he gets up to where the killing place is he jumps out and lets the Sheep go on a sheep has to be led he can't lead himself so therefore it had to be the shepherd coming for the his sheep when they found the god baby exactly where the messenger said he would be and when they found this mess message of the messenger in the manger exactly where the angel said it would be now I heard people say an angel spoke to me he said thus and thus how ridiculous sometime I've heard people say that an angel spoke to him and told him thus and thus which was absolutely contrary to the word now How Could An Angel do that it just couldn't be and if God told you a certain certain thing would happen you say he told you that and it doesn't happen then it wasn't God speaking to you just remember that's right God doesn't lie he's not found in a lie when they found the baby what a joy it must have been to them because the angel that gave them the message they found it just exactly the way the angel said it would be and just in the place where the angel said it would be what a thing that must have been to him in a Manger why see how at ease these herdsman was in the stable amen why do you think a theologian would have been in there he a put a pin over his nose and said get me out of this place he would have been so out of place he' been in misery but you see it was just at home to the shepherd prise the Lord God knows where to send his message just exactly right and this state the Shepherds was in them in their stable with their lamb a vindicat at message that they had heard how beautiful in the presence of the Messiah Vindicated word of their message when the Shepherds heard that the Messiah was on Earth and came into his presence right in their own environment and found the message to be true was Vindicated there how that must have made those men feel to find that God had done this great thing for them why Scholars would have been so out of place there under such circumstances they had all left right quick why the messengers coming to Common herdsman maybe they could have not even these some of these herdsmen might not have even been able to have sign their own name very doubtful you know the herdsman that Jesus chose when he was here on Earth the herd his sheep lovest thou me Peter more than these yay Lord thou knowest I love the feed my sheep and the Bible said that Peter was an ignorant and unlearned man still choosing Shepherd the church members of those past days and priest well trained Society in that day would have been so out of place in a stable now I'm not quite sure that many of you could understand maybe you City people what a judian stable smelt like what it look like as the animals in that stable and what it would have been why some of these Classics of the day would be so out of place there they they wouldn't even enter the door amen but it pleased God am by his infinite wisdom to reveal it to such as would receive it the scholars and wise men of that day would certainly would not have received it they had been so humiliated to be caught in such a place why the first place if they would have went back to their church and would have witnessed that they tended such a meeting and believed a bunch of uneducated Shepherds bringing such a phenomena they had have been excommunicated from their church amen they' have been thrown out of the Society of Bethlehem if they have been caught listening to such an unlearned bunch of people as these Shepherds was humiliated they certainly would have been if they had have been associated with such common people and being accepting such heresies as to believe that God would bring his message to an uneducated bunch of shepherds when they had everything all prepared for it they would have lost their affiliation that have had to give in their papers and would not have been able to have been uh uh recognized among the Society of their groups of that day because they had associated with such a thing and not with a better mind how dare you the priest would have said You Come Into My Sanctuary here with such a heresy with such a foolish that's some unlearned Bushman out there that doesn't didn't go to through the prer and would believe such a message that an angel come down and spoke to him but what if the man would said I saw his message Vindicated amen he had said let me quickly give you your papers and get out of this Society amen times change but people don't it would have probably happened again today they would have been thr out other their churches but the Shepherds felt completely at ease in that place with God's lamb and any good shepherd does the same thing when a Good Shepherd over the sheep can see the word of God made plain and Vindicated of what he promised to do that Shepherd's right at home I don't care what anybody else says there's God promised it and God did it they say the days of Miracles is passed there's no such a thing as the baptism of the spirit there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was for the apostles but let a true Shepherd of the word preach it in the power of the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Peter said on the day of Pentecost the promises unto you and your children and to them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call wherever he calls a promise in the same blessing is true and let a genuine word feeding Shepherd see that big indicated all the theologians in the world can't take it away from him because he know God said so and it happened that's all it's just God's word always his word was made flesh and was dwelling among them and they knew it not he promised the same thing in this day I wonder if we would recognize it the proud and wise had never received such a thing as that and they believed if there was such a thing as the Messiah on Earth it would certainly have to come to their denomination amen it would be their group would receive it or it wasn't right now just think right hard if it ain't in their group then did you notice then God never never chose any out of their group am but he chose that who wasn't connected with any of it because one group had said you see what we did and they do the same today but God chooses the nobody that's the reason he chose the shepherd the Shepherds was completely at home with the god lamb in their midst his word made flesh among them the proud and wise never received it pass by we could say as much for today or in any age it was the same things in the days of Martin Luther same thing in the days of John Wesley is the same things in the days of the Pentecostals but God stops for No Man's organization he moves his Spirit right on to vindicate his word what I have to be and come in the class to their own Council or they wouldn't receive it as they're so h wrong today all the churches that they're going to do such and such and unite all the churches together if they're looking for a messenger now who can unite all the Protestants Catholics and Orthodox everything together and make one great church my brethren I've had the privilege of preaching to hundreds of different religions and there's good man in all of them but now you remember I am prophesying every organization will have to accept this or not be an organization it's forcing it did you read the Tucson paper today or a Catholic priest help ordaining in the paper ordain in Missouri uh Protestant clergymen and who was recognized in it Presbyterians Baptists Lutheran and Assemblies of God it's in the Tucson paper today oh it's shocking it's not the man in there it's them ecclesiastical governmental heads that twist the thing in there the system that throws you into it whether you'll want to or not you can no longer be an organization and escape this wrath that's coming upon the Earth and you see if that isn't right I may be gone when it happens look back on one of these tapes then if it wasn't I'm a false witness if it was I've told the truth they would have called it some kind of a working of an evil spirit against their positive thinking you so much there about positive thinking and just put your mind on anything and think positive on it the devil can do that there's only one thing that's rules over all and that's God's word if you're thinking contrary to the word forget your thinking think on the word Messiah they thought would not be found in such a place a mess as that could you imagine a fine great high priest or clergyman all Polished in theology would come down to a stable full of manure and accept the message of a poor humble Shepherd that had no education and would come say see I can prove it to you this is the baby this is the messenger and you know what them people have said the man is honest he's very sincere in what he's saying but he's absolutely wrong I've seen people live such good lives until people wouldn't believe couldn't say nothing about them but they say he's sincerely wrong he just doesn't know what he's talking about God he wouldn't do such a thing as that but here they had the evidence and after the evidence go up there at the stable and see if that baby isn't laying there am they' say you've been Bewitched but some evil spirit that's caused you to say such yet it was according to the word of God and they were too blind to see it because they're theology had blinded him what a tragedy caught in such a place and such a mess as this was in a stable when they had a beautiful place for him to come they had everything fixed for him to come and then to think that he would come down and go and not bring their teachers the message and would give it to a bunch of unlearned Shepherds and then bring his own son and have him born in a a stable a common Livery stable well in in a Manger of hay why it couldn't be so they wouldn't believe it because it was so humble and it's so simple that's how the wise always overlooks it it's so simple it confounds them they look for a god way out there when he's right here they're looking for something way Yonder when it's right here with them now Christ RIS from the dead the same yesterday today and forever all their great things was bypassed but it sure was the truth that there was a messiah we know it today we believe it today we accept it today but then if God promised something for this Christmas promise something for this day and proves that it's so and we still walk away from it we're just in the same class same was back there at that day that bypassed because it don't does not come in our denominational taste that's why we're in such a mess this Christmas Jesus Christ is not dead he's alive he's here today amen the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever he said in St John 14:12 he that believeth on me not he that makes believe he that says he believes he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and More Than This shall he do because I go to the father and I've seen him in my own life do more of the same works that he did then that's written in the pages of this Bible and he goes over the top of the head and the wise today and revealed to babes such as will learn that Jesus prayed for it is true he's done more than he I've seen in my day of my 33 years of ministry I've seen him do more than I have read of him doing in the Bible more of the same thing now no matter what he did then do you think the sanadrin believed him well they said you're Bewitched but find out where they made their mistakes was to find out and finding out not what their Creed said but what the word said Messiah would do in their day there's where we make the mistake today not searching the scriptures Jesus told him search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me they tell you who I am notice God forne they would do this that's just the why he had to take it to Shepherds he knew they wouldn't do it they wouldn't receive it now do you see why it had to be Shepherd why Shepherds theologians wouldn't receive it why Shepherds again but contrary to his word no they were shepherds they know sheep and that's what he was born a sheep a lamb notice he was the lamb they were they were the only kind that would accept him a Shepherd was the only thing would accept the lamb they know how to take care of it and so is it today when we get the Lamb's message now the Striking the most humblest uneducated man adoring Emmanuel in a stable amen the most and there were people out there at the same days teaching their theology great crowds drawing everywhere from all over the land they come to sacrifices which Jehovah said was a stench in his nostrils and here was humble Shepherds in a stable adoring Emmanuel will God himself made flesh and laying in a stable see how we with our great learnings and our head sticking back like we know something and God bypasses the whole thing he does what he promises to do and he always does that but think of these lowly Shepherds out there now adoring a Emmanuel in a stable it's most striking sure is then out after they had adored him and realized that the message that they had been preaching was Vindicated there they are were out praising God with the most incredible message of an Angel I'll compare that with today just stop a minute and think man out adoring God and praising him for what they had seen what they had heard what they knew was the truth with a message that was incredible to the intellectual mind it was contrary to all ecclesiastical thinking and yet it was the truth it's the truth they believe it and now how foolish can the wisdom a man be then saying that an angel chir sang to them the first noil could you imagine that that a Shepherd That Couldn't Write his name smelling like a sheep pin walking down the street Hing glory to God in the highest we know that he's on Earth the priest said that man's out of his mind look up on the books and see if he's a member of our congregation he certainly embarrasses Us by his unethical teachings get him away from us we will not be embarrassed amongst the people well you can be embarrassed amongst the people and glorified in the sight of God or take your Cho because remember the ecclesiastical Taste of the day don't fit God's word there's not no 969 different tastes of it it's one taste one word one God that's all saying that Angels sang The First Noel to him and also that uh they got a message from an angel an angel appeared to him give them a message and they went and found out that message was truth and say besides that the angel sing the first noil to us could you imagine they said that poor fell they never had anything like that to happen among them you know so it was kind of strange Doctrine to them that's the reason they couldn't find it in the Scriptures it wasn't for them to find it incredible to the wise no such experience had ever happened to them unbelievable but still it was the truth it's the truth we know it's the truth think Christ's first Converse and first congregation was Sheep Man not clergy man Sheep Man herders why Shepherds notice out praising and glorifying God for what they had seen and heard heard Angels Sing for their first time to a human being angels have never sang to a human being before and look at the choirs how they had stood and trained and trained those voices they had sing at the birth of the Messiah and they were all bypassed and Angels came down and sang to Common Sheep Man not with clergy clothes on and look got the first message and where it was given not in the cathedrals but in the wilderness out in the wilderness where the angel of the Lord came not in the church in the wilderness he wasn't even welcome in the church they thought he was they thought they had it but God proved that it was wrong he's able these stones to rise children to Abraham that's right the first time Angels ever sing at a celebration it was in heaven if you look in job 38:7 as to see some of you taking notes when God first planned on making his first creation the Earth job was a great smart man and he had all kinds of wisdom he said when I go up to the markets the young princes they all bow before me in just want a moment of my wisdom and he couldn't figure out why he had to be treated the way he was and so God asked him said g yourself up like a man because I'm coming down to talk to you and when God came down in a horor wind he said job where was you before I laid the foundations of the Earth when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you then job and he was deflated at that time where was you see the first time Angels ever sing at a celebration was in heaven but the first time the ever sing on Earth was the Shepherds at the birth of God Emmanuel on Earth first human beings ever heard an angel sing was humble Shepherds when we take our painted fa women bobbed hair wearing shorts and swing some kind of a church robe around them and stand up and sing like something and then we think if God has to listen to that he's got Angels back on who can entertain him son before he ever made a human being get out and live and wear clothes that's an Abomination to God and how can you expect that to be of God you say well I belong to where was you when I laid the foundations of the Earth tell me where I fasten them to where is the axle that they turn on where were you then you think God has to ask us for some of our wisdom our wisdom is only foolish to him he does what he says he will do now notice God is fixing to make another creation the creating mortal Earth mortal life Angels sing in heaven but here he's creating a new life eternal life for man and he sing to his subjects through Angels on the earth not in heaven amen Heaven had eternal life see and he sang they sang to the heavens when the Mortal creation come in and here the immortal creation is coming in and now they're singing to Earthly people the first time the Shepherds striking isn't it he had started in New Creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could respect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ remember there is always singing at the birth of a king how many know that of course you did well now do you think if this king would have been born down there a a woman would have come run into the cathedral somewhere and said make a bed ready right quick and get the doctors because I'm going to bring Emanuel to the earth a poor woman out of Nazareth the lest City meaner than Tucson or any the rest of them and yet this little woman comes running up there to the great high priest and said I'm fixing to give birth to Emanuel that throw her in jail you sure would they certainly was such a hares is that to be brought amongst his people he wouldn't have stood part NE would he today but just the same is happening just the same notice there has to be singing Kings would he wouldn't have been sang Too the people wouldn't have sing to him because they didn't believe him that's your reason here it comes you might as well get it that's the reason today the people's ashamed to praise God they're ashamed of Christ amen the great Cathedrals won't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're so set in their ecclesiastical way that they will not receive it God's going to find somebody that he can get praised through He's Able of the stones to rise children to Abraham as I quote John again notice his subjects must sang to him and his subjects then was his angels and they sang to his Shepherds which was to take his message who should hear what a beautiful message this morning amen could we just give the seventh angel messenger at hand this morning amen let's just sing some some songs this morning oh Lord my God when I in aome [Music] Wonder the world
