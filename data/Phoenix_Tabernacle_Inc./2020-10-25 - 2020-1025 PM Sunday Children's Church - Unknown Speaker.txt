yes you feel like we take your brother's side yes i feel like you guys take my brother's side because he's the cute little baby with the puppy eyes you're cute too we love all our children thank you look i understand come here come here come here they used to make fun of me when i was at school too seriously people at my church still make fun of me they laughing see but it's okay see when i was at school and i used to pray for my lunch the kids would make fun of me but no matter what they do no matter how they laugh i always knew that there was something in my heart because i invited jesus to be in my heart hey remember you invited jesus to be in your heart too yes why did you invite him to be in your heart because i wanted to be another a better kid you wanted to be a better kid you're an awesome kid seriously yes you're an incredible kid you're an incredible dad oh thank you that wasn't even in the script i loved you're so amazing hey you know sometimes people are mean sometimes people say mean things but you know what god gave us something very special to put on and he said it in his bibles in ephesians do you remember what was it the armor of god the armor of god can you tell me you remind me of a couple of pieces of the armor shoes of peace uh-huh helmet of salvation sword of the spirit yes righteousness and the belt of truth that's right did i say i don't know did you say helmet of salvation i don't think so did you say she said yes okay so i think you did but you know what some people that i know that i've met because you know we have the time machine yeah so i've had the opportunity to meet these people who gave their life no matter who made fun of them even if their little brothers made fun of them even if the people at the school made fun of them if everybody made fun of them they knew that jesus was in their heart and it was more important for them to get to heaven than to feel comfortable or good here on earth because they had an experience really really would you like to know yeah so there's this book it's called fox's book of martyrs brother branham this is one of the books that he told his congregation to read he said every christian should read fox's book of martyrs because it's encouraging how encouraging because i heard you praying right now and so there's something in you that wants to be a warrior and you want to fight and punch and and protect yourself but you know what god wants to fight your battles question how are you going to meet some people with a book good question see i reprogrammed and added an algorithm to the book there was just a couple of repetiti it will transport the people here you don't believe are you ready to see yeah maestro lights porfa please porfa please here we go and the first martyr his name was stephen are you ready to meet these people let's go let's go my name is stephen and it all started on the day of pentecost where we prayed and we waited and we were able to receive the baptism of the holy ghost but we didn't want to just stay there we decided to go out and preach the gospel to every man and creature and let them know of this great and almighty gift and as people began to receive they decided to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ one after another and after another receiving the power of the almighty god in the form of the holy ghost but as the pharisees saw this they didn't like it too much so as i began to run with the gospel i was tied up and put to trial because i was called a blasphemer believing that the son of man was the very son of the almighty god and as he pulled me to trial and threw me out on the street each of them started picking up stones stones of persecution and began to cast them upon me telling me to renounce my belief and my faith in the son of man and as it began to take my last breath of life i look up to my right hand side and i was able to see the almighty god and the son of man standing at his right hand side and i knew that my redeemer liveth and i asked the lord jesus christ forgive them lord for they know not what they do as i took my last breath of life i'm here today to tell you that if you stand for the lord jesus christ today he will stand for you in that great day [Applause] [Music] spaced he was so brave he let them stone him see how does that make you feel sometimes i get my feelings hurt when people say mean things but the real christian filled with the holy ghost he can even take rocks being thrown at him here let me introduce you to my next friend his name was ignacios [Music] ignacios [Music] but he was definitely not the last i am ignatius just like stephen i received the holy ghost as a child some say i was a child in matthew 19. it wasn't difficult for my persecutors to see that i was a man of god but that didn't stop me i was i was tortured [Music] thrown in jail and even thrown into the wild beast the lions as i was fed to the lions i said my last words i am wheat of god and i be grounded by the teeth of these wild beasts that i may be found pure bread of god persecuted and beat but did you notice his attitude yes his attitude he said let them grind me because when you make bread you have to take the wheat and you grind it and even though it's painful for the wheat it becomes bread and you can feed people and be a blessing sometimes the lord is going to grind us and mold our little character but you know i want you to know character you know kindness and love and being friendly all those things you can't be born with them you have to learn them the prophet teaches us the character is not a gift it's a victory so you little soldier with the full armor of god keep pressing on if someone says something mean you just pray for them [Music] do you hear that yes let's meet our next friend are you ready yeah what what what's her what's his name the next friend his name is called polycarp come on escape imagine what it was like for an 86 year old man to have to choose between god and just being burned alive before a crowd well my name is polycarp and i was a disciple of the apostle john after receiving the holy ghost i became bishop and endured persecution with many christians in my day just for refusing to worship other gods and the roman emperor they broke into my home as if i was a savage prisoner but they were soon surprised when i welcomed them in as if they were my friends i said please friend sit down there is only love here eat with me i will freely go with you but i make one request that you gave me an hour to pray and i prayed for two hours as i entered into that heavenly realm with the angels so i was brought into this arena and the pro council pled with me curse christ and i will release you but i replied 86 years i have served him he had never done me wrong how can i blaspheme my king who has saved me surprisingly the proconsul offered to spare my life saying do this old man just swear by the spirit of the emperor and that will be sufficient but i stood firm and the proconsul threatened me with the wild beast and i told him to bring them forth now his patience was gone and he told me that i would be burned alive but i declared you threatened fire that burned for an hour and is over but the judgment on the ungodly is forever so the fire was prepared as i lifted my eyes to heaven and prayed father i bless you that you have deemed me worthy of this day and hour that i might take a portion of the martyrs in the cup of christ among these may i today be welcomed before thy face as a rich and acceptable sacrifice father and as that fire tried to engulf my body i noticed i wasn't being consumed the fire formed an ark around me and and it would not touch me my persecutors were so confused they didn't know what to do but instead of repenting and accepting the one true god who kept me from that flame the soldier took a dagger and stabbed me to death and as my blood put out the fire i took my last breath and was finally united with my lord my favorite part was that the fire formed an ark around here the fire didn't touch him sadly the soldiers didn't use their heads and be baptized in the name of the holy ghost they decided to stab him i think if i would have seen that i would have repented and worshiped that god too wouldn't you yeah i would i would probably worship you i don't know no you have to worship the lord i know but it's just crazy right but if i was i probably would have wanted to worship polycarp too i would have thought he's some god or some scenes the fire won't even touch but remember son it's never the man it's never the man that we look at we follow because there's god in that man she's the children of israel they followed moses but moses followed the pillar of fire yeah oh it's so exciting what's another one so the next one her name is margaret yes it's a girl even girls can stand up for the lord yes wasn't she in 1862 i don't remember what year she was but let's find out okay come on i know as you can tell persecution is the state of being harassed bullied and even killed due to political and in my case religious beliefs i am 18 year old margaret wilson and my story takes place in a dreadful time where a wicked king forced his people to pledge allegiance to him his storts and his church out of fear most men complied afraid of being persecuted my life forever changed when i met sister margaret mclachlan who introduced me to the one true king i can never describe the joy i felt when not only me but my younger sister and brother also accepted the lord jesus christ when i received the holy ghost i did not care who or what would persecute me i know this life is temporary and i'm gonna live it serving the lord my father was a prosperous farmer and out of fear of the king he complied to the law and worshiped how the king demanded how miserable it must be to never truly be free my siblings and i would hide away at sister margaret's home to worship the one true god the officials at my father's church began to notice him attending sunday service without his children and they used fear intimidation and threats to scare us my brother ran away to the mountains while my sister and i gladly pressed on with sister margaret because every single time we were together we felt the presence of the lord we were then betrayed by neighbors arrested and then imprisoned in april we were held in trial and the court demanded we swear oath to the king how can i swear oath to a tyrant who served empty gods desperate my father raised enough money to buy the freedom of my youngest sister sister margaret and i were condemned to be drowned at sea tied to a stake on may 11th they took me and sister margaret to the ocean to meet our fates they position positioned her farthest in the ocean so i could see her drown as it broke my heart seeing my beloved sister in christ's lung fill with water i knew the fear they tried to instill in me couldn't compare to the joy that was coming she passed away i was there awaiting my watery death and the sea rose covering my face and when i was about to enter into heaven a guard pulled me out giving me one last chance to swear oath to the king they do not understand that death will bring me closer to christ at 18 years old i understood this i then turned to the guard and i told him may god save the king if he will i died singing of how good my god was despite my trials despite my problems despite my current situation and despite my persecution [Music] what did you notice i noticed that every martyr was talking about being baptized and receiving the holy ghost that's right that's where we get the courage that's where we can get the courage to stand in the face of people laughing speeding hitting and making fun of you the baptism of the holy ghost changes lives son it'll change your life would you like that yes let's let's go to one more okay one more one more this one is called oh let's go a little more recent [Music] he's a filipino friend oh filipino come on let's go see stefan ignatius polycarp the margarets they all have one thing in common we all had a genuine experience with our god almighty and encounter that forever left a mark a conviction we knew who we were my god gave me a new heart to love he gave me new strength to overcome and to overcome all the sadness all the pain my god broke the chains of bondage he gave me the new birth he made me free my name is clarito de la cruz and i am one of the many martyrs who stood for the word of god i have a wife her name is lauedel and she is pregnant i also have a son three years of age wherever wherever i went i always always always preach the gospel i share the goodness of christ to his people but on july 26 2011 a beautiful muslim couple pretending to be husband and wife they hired me they wanted me to drive them to a village near the town of now we drove and we drove for miles and miles and miles seemed like the road was just getting longer and as soon as we arrived the most unexpected thing happened they revealed themselves as muslim extremists and they attacked me they beat me and they hit me and they tied my they had tied my hands with wires their demand it was that i converted to islam and i was given chance after chance after chance to renounce my faith and no matter how bad they hurt me how bad they caught me or caused me pain i stood strong for my god and i was given one final chance with a gun pointed at my head so i denied them one last time saying pull the trigger i know where i'm going when i die do you know where you're going [Music] that they were so brave they let everybody kill them that's i want that i want that you want that i don't you want that courage that courage oh when we have that see not everyone has to suffer like them see our persecution here looks a little different because god has been so merciful see the ones that attack us is our anger our jealousy our fear depression our anxiety all those things are frustration see our disobedience those are all the things that keep us from being the boy and girl that jesus wants us to be those are the people those are the real enemy see but we can overcome them we can overcome them but the only thing that can overcome the real enemy is love son would you like the love of god because did you know the love of god has a name is the name the love of god no no no the love of god has a name the holy spirit has a name freedom has a name victory has a name love has a name and that name is jesus christ now we can pray if you would like the holy ghost of course see the bible gives us a recipe or how to receive the holy ghost and that's in acts 2 38 see the apostle peter was preaching when the holy ghost came down they were sitting in the room and where they were sitting the holy ghost filled up the entire room and everybody had fire burning in them and they were speaking in different languages and tongues and then somebody jumped up and said men how can we get what you have and peter said repent oh he was anointed with the holy ghost and he said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost see they didn't have to be standing they didn't have to do cartwheels and jump and shouted the bible says they were sitting you can sit down and receive the holy ghost right where you are and then once you receive the holy ghost then it's gonna put a fire on you to jump up and shout and do something for the lord so would you like that yes would you like that yes then pray with me myself can you close your eyes it's so simple all you have to do son when i said repent i want you to know repent isn't some fancy thing all it means is just feel bad for what you did it doesn't even mean ask for forgiveness if you look into the dictionary the definition says a deep remorse something a deep feeling to make you never want to do it again okay and then when you have the holy ghost the lord will put on your heart to go make right with people and ask for forgiveness but the first step is to feel bad for the things you did now you don't want to talk back to mommy do you you don't want to punch your brother in the nose do you you don't want to rip up your science project and your homework and tell your teacher that the dog ate it even though you don't have a dog do you so do you feel bad for those things yes do you feel bad for being embarrassed of the lord sometimes we don't want to pray at school yes so then all you have to do is say lord i repent of those things lord i replent of those things i don't want to do that again i don't want to do that again i'll turn away from that i'll turn away from that oh hallelujah and then the apostle said be baptized in his name so all you have to do is confess it with your lips believe it in your heart and say it loud so that everybody can hear you so you can show you're not ashamed now when you confess like that the lord will come and fill you with the holy ghost you go ahead go ahead sir lord i am sorry for all that they've done i'm sorry name lord jesus christ i pray i'm sorry for all my scenes fill me with the holy ghost [Music] hallelujah now we just wait on the lord amen now come on let's go and have dinner man were you as blessed as i was it is truly to let and they were surprised when the answer was so simple yes professor theo explained it perfectly el profesorteo los plico perfectamente i know that most of our children yoseki muchos and ostrosicos have been touched in their hearts in our services time and time again if i was to ask them children raise up your hands and tell me have you felt god in the service touch your heart amen amen and not just the little children the big children amen amen god is faithful see his word will never fail wherever two or three are gathered he is there and he

[Music] oh lord if we could just see it lord but it's your will father then we go into the baptismal waters just to show people that we believe in jesus christ and then he makes us a promise and that promises to give you the holy ghost he'll never fail see those murders what was special about them is that they had that very life escaped that holy ghost el espiritu santo inside of them dentro de elios and that holy ghost yes espirito santo could not stop testifying about god's goodness and tonight he is here for us lord i'm gonna pray lord senor [Music] and if you want the holy ghost with all
