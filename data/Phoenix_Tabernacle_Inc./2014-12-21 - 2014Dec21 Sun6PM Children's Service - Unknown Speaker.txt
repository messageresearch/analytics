and say Jesus was born look to your neighbor say the Savior was [Music] born look to your look to the person behind you say hosana praise God how many say glory to God you may be [Music] seated amen as as the piano continues to play softly I imagine what a journey it must have been that poor little donkey I'm not calling brother mik a donkey Mary and Joseph on their Journey Through the river over the mountains and they probably saw coyotes and wolves and D creatures but the whole time Mary knew she had something special inside of her now I ask myself how many Christians Born Again know that they have something special inside of [Music] them I'm sure Mary had lots of doubts [Music] brother it's so cold or it's so hot this journey is so hard we should have stayed back at home but that still small [Music] voice oh my daughter remember what the angel said now how many here remember what your angel said you have life inside of [Music] you the life that's inside of you is not your own he was carrying the very life of God when you're born again something's different about you something's different inside of you you don't want to do the same things anymore Mary had to put away her toys she couldn't waste her time of of Facebooking anything Facebook she had Jesus inside of her so she finally got to the city Bethlehem and she realizes I don't fit [Music] in everywhere I go I'm being [Music] rejected excuse me sir do you have any more room in the in the in I know it's late sorry you should have made reservations excuse me sir do you have any more room in your hotel sorry you should have went to [Music] priceline.com no there's no room sorry she didn't fit in anywhere so finally somebody said you know what I have a I have a room in the stable St it's nothing much but at least you're not going to be out in the cold how many of us would have been offended at the sight of that stable cows maybe a goat or two it probably smelled like 10,000 goats they took their first step in the stable that was probably uh animal um fees on the floor it l like a potty like the animals went potty in [Music] there he's like but imagine that would you sleep there would would you take that [Music] room would you say you know what fine this is this is fine this is perfect for me and my family I would have been like excuse me [Music] bro I appreciate it you see my wife is pregnant this isn't her backpack back worn backwards okay she's she's pregnant okay I can't sleep here I'm going to throw up it's so gross see how many would take that kind of attitude you know what I'm going to go to the next town but Mary what a Christian the angel said she was favored amongst all all women she wasn't a mean girl she probably said Joseph is perfect it just needs a a feminine touch she probably took off her her little Shaw covered the window like a curtain she probably tried to move the hay stack to make a couch a hay stack and Joseph said let me move that darling let me they rearranged the the the the tools a little bit kicked out the [Music] cow and made it home now I want you to think about something our hearts are a nasty old stable filled with [Music] animals and trash and and [Music] poop and every uncomfortable nasty thing you can think of [Music] and God Almighty said this heart is perfect I want to make this heart my home now tonight is there a room in your [Music] stable is there room in your stable I come for the Lord Jesus to come and rearrange the mess and make your heart his home God bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
