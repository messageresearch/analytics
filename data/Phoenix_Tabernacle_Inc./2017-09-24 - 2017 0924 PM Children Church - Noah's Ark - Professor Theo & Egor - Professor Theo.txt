old shirt man but it was so cute because he looked just like his daddy no so one thing Noah was all working in this neighborhood walking around town and the Lord stopped him so the yes the Lord stopped him several times and he didn't know what to do and the Lord said no over here who is that it's the Lord go and built a great Ark for there's gonna be a terrible flood upon this wicked world go and bring all who believe in you and two of each animal of the earth and go and stand upon the belt of truth for I will be with you always yes sir what am I gonna tell them the flood is coming warn them and tell them the truth yes sir Noah did as the LORD commanded and Noah would build that Ark he started working night and day he got all his safety scissors and and glue sticks and cardboard and tape and everything that he could to work as hard as he could so I have a question who built the ark Noah no who built the ark Oh baby art Oh baby I know who they are [Music] [Music] who [Music] he worked hard in the 1450 art and while he was building some Mimi's decided to tease him everybody say boo Mimi's not cool it's never gonna rain no I what's wrong with you it never rains here huh again yes that is gonna rain God told me have you ever seen the rain oh yes I have don't blame it on the rain oh wow I saw in a vision what vision the Lord gave it to me he's never gonna rain only monsoon season I believe the Lord he is the truth I don't care what anyone says well see you know I okay let's see about that didn't care he kept on building and even though the black dude tried to think he was cool Prophet Noah said I don't care I believe God if you believe God on Thursday ya know where's rain Noah it's coming right now I don't see it anywhere it's hot out here if you believe you can come into the ark a few but a newbie sees only a few believe keep working I don't knowa so there we went day after day year after year preaching and they just laughed at him how I was never gonna rain oh ha ha ha ha but he's a wife believed in him don't run away no he didn't like to show public affection so the wife had to go back into la cocina so there he went until the arc was done [Applause]

take us to the rapture is the same Holy Spirit that's going to convince everyone who does not be so they save water that save Noah is the same water that made everybody drown and for 40 days they're with the Ark [Music] until finally the water stopped and it stopped raining and Noah he was looking looking out the window and he sent a raven out ah and then he sent the thought out and he did it several times until the dog came back with the leaf some represent peace and that there was land and so they rejoiced they rejoiced and rejoiced because God had kept them safe and not and not only did
