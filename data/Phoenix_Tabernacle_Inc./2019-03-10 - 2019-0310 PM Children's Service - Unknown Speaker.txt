love you and I'm explain to you why we do that we do that because we want everybody to feel like we're loved we're blessed and we want to train the kids did you see shake hands it's simply shake your hands and we greet each other with a smile like this god bless you what's more powerful than a smile man smiles are so powerful they break down walls they break down walls so we have another story really quick it's about a man called Paul and this man called Paul I imagine he had a great smile cuz he broke down walls and he had this powerful earth of a story in the Bible where he's in prison and he's praying and he's praising and walls came crumbling down so we just want to dramatize this for you so simply and so quickly I'm gonna invite my prison walls to come out here and if I invited the pretty gonna go out that door we'll bring out the prison walls did we give a round of applause for our prison walls [Music] and we're gonna invite our prisoners to come out here you can come over here brother you can come right here and then we'll have the prisoners right there on the stairs you see this strong prison this is strong prison made out of the best styrofoam you can get at Home Depot and held up by the best supports we have for that I'll go over here and brother yeah and can we give them a round of applause they're gonna be our prison so here we have a prison and just a bunch of prisoners go ahead prisoners let's let's see we have this prison back in the Bible days and these prisoners were crying cuz cuz they were in prison they did some bad things so here they are just suffering in prison but there was a man there was a man and I'm gonna be that man his name was Saul and he was Paul his name was Saul and when he met God God changed his name to Paul and then Paul first he was beating up Christians and throwing the Christians in general but then he became a Christian and he started preaching high god bless you do you know Jesus Christ hi hi god bless you did you know there's a god he wants to live inside your heart alright god bless you come let's break some bread you can have a couple of guests ideas and I'll tell you all about Jesus so that's what Paul was doing he was out preaching and then the Romans didn't like it everybody say boo the Romans didn't like it so they got Paul and they got his bloody Silas where's my Roman guard where's the Roman guard came and he got Paul in Silas they take ATEC Angelo take it easy huh and he threw Paul and Silas in the prison we are quiet so all the other prisoners were crying right but Paul and Silas they had faith in God so Paul and Silas came and the Bible says they were praying and singing praises and this prison was unlike any other prison because they had the best piano player playing in the prison cell next door the best cattle player in Phoenix can you give her a round of applause but they know nothing about that but Paul and Silas will doubted they were prayed and these clowns were making fun of them dying of hunger prison on Mexican I was literally no ganas just now and they're trying to cross over and out here but the free brothers let me tell you why we're praying I'll tell you what we're praying because my circumstance doesn't determine my praise Emmett are you something my circumstance does not determine my praise it doesn't matter if I'm in a prison or if I'm on the beach hanging out with my friends I could be in paradise or I could be in the abyss right here in this prison I'm going to praise the Lord it's saying Silas let us sing praises you know why because when you combine your prayer with praise something happens we can pray we can pray all you want lord help me I'm such a horrible prison I'm in this condition I'm in that condition lord help my sister Lord she's a cheese emulsify on the weekend we can pray all kinds of stuff lord help my brother Lord because he always talks bad about me we can pray all kinds of stuff but is that kind of prayer the prayers that a Christian should pray no a pray if you can't pray giving praise out of your lips then we gotta go back to practice praying so we're gonna pray a prayer and we're gonna praise God at the same time because he already freed us so that's why we're praying just in case you didn't know but where is this God I don't even see him oh you're gonna fill him and you're gonna see him because he's real he lives within me he is with us even in us until the end of the world also we're gonna praise we're gonna praise coming let's praise Him let's praising amen you Oh his name is called and then the angel started singing can you be the Angels for us [Music] they're just crazy that we don't care the word a prison he's gone with Revere in revealing us even in this prison Lord his name is Paul [Music] man you Oh silence I'm so excited I can feel the Spirit of the Lord let's keep singing my brother Oh amen you Oh can you see with us whoa his name is called this ball [Music] man you were a man [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Oh Emanuele and as Pauline Cyrus Silas were there praising God the Bible says the walls started to shake and tremble until they came down and all the doors just flung open from the prison what I don't believe this what what is what's going on and I have moments the prison guard was fearful because he thought oh my bosses don't kill me Oh so he went to go take the sword and Paul said no don't hurt yourself we're all here we haven't left but this was done so that you can see that there is a living God and the Roman soldier he came and he gave his heart to the Lord and him and all his family believed in God and that's what we're called to do today we're called to take our little prayers and our praise and combined them so that no matter where you are no matter what prison you find in front of you no matter what bully is there or what thing that you've faced or what nightmares it might be if you're afraid of dark anything that you struggle with if you're sick you just call me you bring your praise and you bring your prayer and those walls will crumble down and anyone that sees you will come and believe in a Living God just because of your praise and your attitude how many want to have that kind of attitude this evening or can you give the Lord a head of praise can we praise the Lord and can we give them a round of applause please and can you lift your voice one more time as we see Immanuel Immanuel can you stand with me please [Music] and you were [Music] or his name is called this call emmanuel him [Music] Oh rebuilding [Music] Amen would you bow
