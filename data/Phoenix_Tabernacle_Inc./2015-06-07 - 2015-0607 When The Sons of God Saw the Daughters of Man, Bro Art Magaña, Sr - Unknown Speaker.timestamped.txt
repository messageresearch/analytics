[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:05] myself that she is my
[1:01:20] daughter I've spoken to all my
[1:01:23] kids
[1:01:26] about this first
[1:01:28] step it's very
[1:01:32] important
[1:01:34] and you know I'm
[1:01:39] overwhelmed because I know in
[1:01:42] heaven there there's
[1:01:45] a if you could say like the teenagers
[1:01:49] do they they got a
[1:01:52] party you know because because the soul
[1:01:55] decided to follow the
[1:01:58] lord as a parent that's what we
[1:02:01] want as a Christian
[1:02:04] parent so we're here and we're going to
[1:02:09] baptize H
[1:02:15] Vargas in Christian
[1:02:18] baptism just like his word
[1:02:21] says and it's a privilege for me as his
[1:02:24] father as her
[1:02:26] father to baptize
[1:02:29] her now I'm going to ask her a couple of
[1:02:32] questions for anyone who might have any
[1:02:39] doubts I will ask her did anyone tell
[1:02:42] you to get
[1:02:47] baptized no did your mother tell you you
[1:02:51] better get
[1:02:53] baptized
[1:02:56] no so you did this on your
[1:03:00] own yes amen so even though she's she's
[1:03:04] young and and
[1:03:08] 13 she's already knows
[1:03:10] what's uh good and
[1:03:14] bad
[1:03:16] so from here on she was walking as I
[1:03:20] talked to her this
[1:03:23] way
[1:03:26] and since the tugging in her heart
[1:03:27] started and that's the Lord speaking to
[1:03:32] her so now she's going to turn around
[1:03:34] and Walk This
[1:03:37] Way that that's what we have learned
[1:03:40] throughout the
[1:03:42] years so we're going to baptize
[1:03:45] her in Christian
[1:03:48] baptism so if you bow your heads and for
[1:03:51] a word of
[1:03:53] Prayer
[1:03:56] Lord Heavenly
[1:03:58] Father we come before you
[1:04:01] Lord
[1:04:03] and you Lord as our
[1:04:07] father and we are your
[1:04:10] children Here I Am Lord
[1:04:14] representing Lord that as she decided to
[1:04:18] ask her father to baptize
[1:04:22] her I'm just is doing your will
[1:04:26] Lord and
[1:04:28] Obey so I baptized during Christian
[1:04:32] baptism and I ask that you help her in
[1:04:35] her Christian
[1:04:38] walk and may she continue Lord with all
[1:04:41] the steps that need to be
[1:04:45] taken and knowing that you will be
[1:04:49] there all she has to
[1:04:51] do is ask that you come and give her
[1:04:55] what she
[1:04:57] needs until she reaches that step where
[1:05:01] she is
[1:05:04] adopted so we ask you Lord that you help
[1:05:09] her and also bless her parents
[1:05:13] Lord that wherever she may be may they
[1:05:16] continue telling her what she needs to
[1:05:18] do
[1:05:22] Lord but ultimately Lord she has to take
[1:05:24] the decision upon
[1:05:28] herself to continue in your
[1:05:32] ways we ask you to bless
[1:05:35] her in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ amen
[1:05:50] amen hania Verdugo Vargas hania varas I

[1:16:01] time I was 42 years old

[1:16:11] for over eight
[1:16:15] months in the ICU
[1:16:18] unit never been in the hospital in my

[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:17:06] but I look
[1:17:09] back and I
[1:17:11] know that it was
[1:17:16] you that sometimes it's in the
[1:17:22] valleys sometimes it's at the
[1:17:26] cross but it's always been
[1:17:29] you w to take us each and every one of
[1:17:35] us to that place that you have

[1:18:04] Lord that you would come into our
[1:18:08] midst you would speak to us through your
[1:18:12] word the way that the prophet taught us
[1:18:18] Lord we're not the
[1:18:21] prophet but we are the product
[1:18:25] Lord we are the ones that that that the
[1:18:28] word of the Lord would be revealed
[1:18:33] to the word of the Lord didn't come to
[1:18:38] us but the Revelation did

[1:18:51] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:56] Christ amen amen I'd like to greet you
[1:18:59] this morning in the name of Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ it's a privilege to be here this
[1:19:08] morning beautiful June summer
[1:19:13] weather normally we we would say that
[1:19:16] and kind of chuckle to
[1:19:20] ourselves but truly we've been blessed
[1:19:22] with with some good
[1:19:26] weather if you would like to turn with
[1:19:28] me to Genesis chapter
[1:19:33] 6 we're going to take our text our
[1:19:36] subject
[1:19:38] from from those series of scriptures
[1:19:51] there
[1:19:56] and it reads like
[1:19:58] this and it came to pass when men began
[1:20:02] to multiply on the face of the earth and
[1:20:05] the daughters and daughters were born
[1:20:07] unto
[1:20:14] them that the sons of God saw the
[1:20:17] daughters of men that they were fair and
[1:20:20] they took them wives of all which they
[1:20:22] chose
[1:20:33] and the Lord said my spirit shall not
[1:20:36] always strive with man for that he is
[1:20:39] also flesh yet his days shall be 120
[1:20:51] years
[1:20:55] and I want to insert into
[1:20:57] here that in verse
[1:21:00] three brother brandham says that that's
[1:21:03] when God put in the
[1:21:09] clutch when a clutch is put
[1:21:12] in that means there's going to be a
[1:21:14] change of a
[1:21:17] gear verse four and there were giants in
[1:21:21] the earth in those days and also after
[1:21:23] that when the sons of God came unto the
[1:21:26] daughters of men they bare children of
[1:21:29] them the same became became Mighty Men
[1:21:32] which were of old men of
[1:21:51] renown and God God saw that the
[1:21:53] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[1:21:56] and that every imagination of the
[1:21:58] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:22:12] continually and it repented the Lord
[1:22:14] that he had made man on the earth and
[1:22:16] they grieved him at his
[1:22:21] heart
[1:22:25] and the Lord said I will destroy man
[1:22:28] whom I have created from the face of the
[1:22:30] Earth both man and Beast and creepy
[1:22:33] thing and the creepy thing and the fowls
[1:22:36] of the air for it repented me that I
[1:22:39] made
[1:22:51] them
[1:22:56] but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[1:23:02] Lord you may be
[1:23:04] seated may the Lord add His blessings
[1:23:06] through the reading of the
[1:23:11] word I want to take
[1:23:13] a a a text out of those
[1:23:19] verses and I want to call it when the
[1:23:22] Sun of God saw the daughters of
[1:23:31] men verse one says that it came to pass
[1:23:34] when men began to multiply upon the face
[1:23:37] of the
[1:23:45] Earth that the sons of God saw the
[1:23:47] daughters of men that they were
[1:23:51] Fair
[1:23:54] there was a
[1:23:56] change something changed
[1:23:59] there this sentence is declaring to
[1:24:04] us about a specific
[1:24:08] instance when something took
[1:24:11] place when the attention of the sons of
[1:24:16] God was drawn to the daughters of of of
[1:24:21] men
[1:24:24] amen there was an a CH there was a
[1:24:26] change in their
[1:24:29] appearance and the change came the Bible
[1:24:34] says when the multiplication or the
[1:24:36] population increased in
[1:24:41] those now everyone knows that Jesus
[1:24:44] declared these things to
[1:24:47] us and we know that one of those
[1:24:50] characteristics is with us today
[1:24:56] and I think uh I think there's seven
[1:24:58] billion people on the Earth
[1:25:04] today and brother brandom tells us it's
[1:25:07] possible that they had more people back
[1:25:10] in those
[1:25:15] days so the they began to multiply
[1:25:21] rapidly
[1:25:23] but what I want to talk about
[1:25:26] today is that
[1:25:28] change that thing that that caused
[1:25:32] them that caused the sons of
[1:25:35] God to take
[1:25:38] note of the daughters of
[1:25:46] men the prophet calls calls this change
[1:25:54] Junctions in
[1:25:56] time changes in
[1:25:59] time or it can be looked at as a change
[1:26:02] of
[1:26:06] dispensation a a
[1:26:18] crossroad at these
[1:26:21] Crossroads
[1:26:22] or changes of
[1:26:25] dispensation that's when the two
[1:26:27] opposing
[1:26:30] Spirits they make themselves known here
[1:26:32] in the
[1:26:35] earth it's a time of
[1:26:39] turmoil
[1:26:41] chaos when they make themselves
[1:26:45] manifest it's at these Junctions that
[1:26:47] that takes
[1:26:49] place the changes in dispensation
[1:26:54] now I have here on on the on the
[1:26:58] PowerPoint some of the major changes in
[1:27:02] dispensation when these things took
[1:27:06] place they're very
[1:27:08] significant but this morning I want to
[1:27:12] just I just want to draw your attention
[1:27:14] to that one
[1:27:18] time in the days of
[1:27:21] Noah the sons of God looked upon the
[1:27:24] daughters of
[1:27:28] men whenever God sends his word to the
[1:27:33] Earth Satan comes and attacks the
[1:27:37] word the message tells us
[1:27:41] distinctly that that it's that it's the
[1:27:45] word that Satan
[1:27:48] attacks he wants to get us to doubt the
[1:27:51] word
[1:27:55] amen a contest is a test of
[1:28:01] strength and that's what this
[1:28:03] is these powers in these changes of
[1:28:09] dispensation in these
[1:28:12] Junctions they like to show their
[1:28:16] powers God likes to show his
[1:28:19] power and so to his sons
[1:28:24] amen the change in
[1:28:27] dispensation the change was an enemy
[1:28:33] attacked it was a front line
[1:28:37] assault when this took
[1:28:40] place when when the when when the
[1:28:43] population began to to
[1:28:47] multiply and when the sons of God
[1:28:51] noticed those Daughters of of
[1:28:54] man it was an
[1:28:57] attack an attack is an aggressive
[1:29:00] aggression a aggressive
[1:29:04] action it's something that that a
[1:29:07] special forces
[1:29:10] group or an
[1:29:13] army comes against another
[1:29:17] Army Jesus warned the
[1:29:20] church as it was in the days of
[1:29:23] Noah so shall it be in the days of the
[1:29:25] son of
[1:29:27] man so we know the prophetic words of
[1:29:30] the
[1:29:33] master that there would come a time in
[1:29:35] the
[1:29:37] future that the world
[1:29:40] order the cosmos would be similar to the
[1:29:44] days of
[1:29:47] Noah and we know that there that there
[1:29:49] is going to be a junction change
[1:29:54] a change in
[1:29:56] dispensation as it was in the days of
[1:29:59] Noah the battle of the two
[1:30:03] Spirits remember the prophet said in the
[1:30:05] message the greatest battle ever
[1:30:10] fought when Satan was kicked out of
[1:30:15] heaven and he was cast down to the
[1:30:18] Earth he he said that now that battle
[1:30:21] that started in
[1:30:24] heaven would be brought down to the
[1:30:27] Earth and that's what we're talking
[1:30:30] about and there was a change that
[1:30:34] happened there was a the time in
[1:30:36] instance in
[1:30:40] time when something
[1:30:42] came that caused these
[1:30:45] men to notice these
[1:30:50] women the two forces always meet in
[1:30:53] these changing of
[1:30:57] Junctions what's it all
[1:31:00] mean what's it coming to we know that it
[1:31:03] started in
[1:31:05] heaven but where is it going to
[1:31:08] end we've seen the different
[1:31:11] Junctions and we know that if the final
[1:31:15] showdown is going to be the battle of
[1:31:19] Armageddon but but for today
[1:31:22] I just want to focus on that
[1:31:26] change and if God
[1:31:28] willing we can get into that in another
[1:31:31] at other
[1:31:33] times I would love to get into
[1:31:35] that so that we could see where where
[1:31:38] we're headed
[1:31:40] to that's the whole prophetic
[1:31:44] Bible because God wanted a certain group
[1:31:47] of
[1:31:49] people he wanted us to know
[1:31:52] know what was going to come in the
[1:31:55] future and more importantly what was
[1:31:58] going to take place in our
[1:32:02] age so that the elect of that
[1:32:06] age so that when they would see those
[1:32:09] conditions in
[1:32:12] time when they would see their
[1:32:15] surroundings they would be able to
[1:32:18] notice or detect in the scriptures
[1:32:23] positionally where they were
[1:32:26] at and then they could place
[1:32:29] themselves and the prophetic
[1:32:32] word and then see what was coming in the
[1:32:36] future because that's what we want to
[1:32:39] know we want to know where we are
[1:32:44] positionally in a specific
[1:32:50] time
[1:32:53] all the
[1:32:56] ages that that deception has come to the
[1:33:00] Earth this present age that we live
[1:33:05] in is the most deceitful of all of
[1:33:10] them that's that's a a a tremendous
[1:33:13] thing to
[1:33:15] say but it's but it's a reality to
[1:33:20] us this the most deceptive
[1:33:24] age is the age that we live in
[1:33:28] now in the 20th at the beginning of the
[1:33:31] 20th
[1:33:33] century we know that the characteristics
[1:33:36] of the anti luian
[1:33:40] time the characteristics of the days of
[1:33:44] Noah became be began to manifest
[1:33:47] themselves in the 20th
[1:33:50] century things began began to change
[1:33:56] rapidly excuse me things began to change
[1:34:01] slowly it started it started
[1:34:05] gradually and then it became
[1:34:08] faster and faster and faster until we
[1:34:13] find ourselves in the stage that we're
[1:34:15] in right
[1:34:17] now as many ministers have said before
[1:34:22] at the beginning of the 20th
[1:34:25] century if somebody would have gave you
[1:34:27] a glimpse of what we see every
[1:34:33] day it would have shocked
[1:34:36] you the change that you would have seen
[1:34:39] from back then to
[1:34:43] now would have shocked you you know back
[1:34:47] in the day when you hear Brother brandom
[1:34:49] speaking the
[1:34:50] message
[1:34:53] in the 50s and the
[1:34:55] 60s it tells us about that that the
[1:34:59] people it was
[1:35:02] common it was common that that people
[1:35:06] would have mental
[1:35:10] breakdown a nervous breakdown they would
[1:35:14] say where is sister so and
[1:35:17] so where's brother so and so he had a
[1:35:20] nervous
[1:35:23] breakdown you don't hear that
[1:35:26] today is that
[1:35:29] right but back
[1:35:31] then you would hear that as if someone
[1:35:35] had a bad flu or
[1:35:37] something they had a a nervous breakdown
[1:35:40] they would
[1:35:42] say if I would say
[1:35:45] today how many have had a nervous
[1:35:50] breakdown
[1:35:52] [Laughter]
[1:35:55] we've had them brother yes sir we just
[1:35:59] classify them in a different uh stage
[1:36:04] now there's things that are shocking
[1:36:06] that go on
[1:36:09] today that can cause people to have a
[1:36:12] nervous
[1:36:14] breakdown but we've become so accustomed
[1:36:17] to these
[1:36:20] things become dull to
[1:36:24] them that once in a
[1:36:26] while something will shock
[1:36:29] us but it has come so
[1:36:32] gradually that we just have accustom
[1:36:36] ourselves
[1:36:38] to but he said it would
[1:36:41] be as it was in the days of
[1:36:45] Noah and this change that we that we're
[1:36:48] talking
[1:36:50] about it affected All Phases of
[1:36:55] Life the politics religion
[1:36:59] transportation
[1:37:02] technology the beautification of
[1:37:08] women all
[1:37:10] began at the beginning of the 20th
[1:37:13] century one of the key things that
[1:37:16] happened in the
[1:37:18] beginning was the Russian Max Factor
[1:37:23] he migrated to the United
[1:37:26] States he moved to Los Angeles
[1:37:32] californ in
[1:37:34] 1902 and
[1:37:36] Satan moved his
[1:37:39] headquarters from Paris
[1:37:42] France to
[1:37:44] California isn't that
[1:37:46] right all at the
[1:37:49] beginning of the 20th century
[1:37:52] so but it became be but it began to come
[1:37:56] slowly until it's just becoming so
[1:38:01] rapid that time has gone so
[1:38:04] rapidly that it appears as though
[1:38:08] someone or some
[1:38:11] mechanism is advancing the time quicker
[1:38:13] and
[1:38:16] quicker until we can't even understand
[1:38:19] it
[1:38:20] anymore
[1:38:22] one day it's Sunday the next day we find
[1:38:25] it's
[1:38:26] Friday back to
[1:38:28] Monday and and before we know
[1:38:31] it it's the time has slipped from
[1:38:34] us why time is a very important
[1:38:37] commodity
[1:38:40] today it it's important with what we do
[1:38:42] with our
[1:38:44] time how we utilize it how we manage it
[1:38:50] that's why I don't understand that
[1:38:51] people waste their
[1:38:54] time on things that are
[1:38:58] meaningless the only thing that has
[1:39:00] meaning to us
[1:39:02] today is the word of the
[1:39:05] Lord Jesus told us that heaven and earth
[1:39:09] will pass
[1:39:11] away but the word of God would not pass
[1:39:15] away it's the only thing that has
[1:39:20] substance
[1:39:23] I want to relate to
[1:39:25] you how I received this
[1:39:28] message I I think it's important to
[1:39:32] know how the Lord works with
[1:39:37] people you already know how he works
[1:39:39] with
[1:39:41] you but he deals with each one
[1:39:48] individually in the fall of 202
[1:39:53] 12 this scripture kept coming to my
[1:39:59] thinking when the sons of
[1:40:01] God saw the daughters of
[1:40:06] men and so then I began to to study
[1:40:10] it I began to ponder
[1:40:14] it and it seemed like I would understand
[1:40:17] what was what was
[1:40:19] written
[1:40:22] and then it would come again to
[1:40:24] me and this happened over
[1:40:27] months and I couldn't seem to
[1:40:31] understand why it would keep coming back
[1:40:33] to
[1:40:36] me until finally one
[1:40:39] day I was able to grasp the
[1:40:47] context now
[1:40:49] watch and listen
[1:40:52] listen the
[1:40:56] context brother brandham calls the
[1:41:01] context reading in between the
[1:41:07] lines or you could be or I've heard him
[1:41:09] say it was the
[1:41:19] algebra
[1:41:24] so it's just
[1:41:28] like he teaches us in Revelation chapter
[1:41:32] 5 now
[1:41:34] listen in Revelation chapter
[1:41:38] 5 brother Bram tells us that it's the
[1:41:42] scene the
[1:41:45] context of the opening of just it's the
[1:41:48] scene before the opening of the seven
[1:41:58] that's the
[1:42:03] algebra the
[1:42:06] context the definition is it's a
[1:42:11] circumstances that form the setting for
[1:42:13] an
[1:42:18] event a statement or an ideal
[1:42:22] so that it can be
[1:42:25] understood the scene the
[1:42:29] context in between the
[1:42:31] lines there's a
[1:42:34] context in between the lines but brother
[1:42:37] random also
[1:42:39] said when you go in between the
[1:42:42] lines you have to come back up to the
[1:42:47] line that's what many people fail to do
[1:42:52] they're good at going in between the
[1:42:55] lines they go like almost underwater and
[1:42:57] come up somewhere
[1:42:59] else but you have to come
[1:43:02] up back to the
[1:43:04] line amen
[1:43:08] amen so
[1:43:10] was the
[1:43:13] context of when the sons of
[1:43:17] God saw the daughters of man
[1:43:21] the line tells us
[1:43:24] that but there's a
[1:43:27] context there's a condition of the
[1:43:30] time that we that we that we need to
[1:43:35] understand the thing that caused that
[1:43:40] change in the Feast of the trumpets
[1:43:42] brother Brandon makes this
[1:43:46] statement he said the Bible is read
[1:43:49] between the lines
[1:43:52] to make the picture
[1:43:56] appear the
[1:43:58] context the algebra the
[1:44:02] revelation God hides his meage his
[1:44:05] message in between the
[1:44:09] lines and he reveals it to
[1:44:13] whomever he
[1:44:16] pleases that ability cannot be taught
[1:44:22] it is a spiritual
[1:44:25] instruction only
[1:44:28] given by the
[1:44:31] father isn't that right you know I wish
[1:44:34] I could just get up here and and get
[1:44:36] into
[1:44:38] that and just really get into that
[1:44:42] profoundly and show how those
[1:44:46] principles can be
[1:44:49] applied Genesis to
[1:44:52] Revelation the message teaches us that
[1:44:56] but it's not taught to
[1:45:00] everyone the Jesus said
[1:45:04] himself that that would be taught to his
[1:45:10] church
[1:45:15] correct I think we need to say that more
[1:45:18] often sometimes
[1:45:28] so so what we want to
[1:45:31] do or what I want to do this
[1:45:34] morning is make a
[1:45:37] relation a relationship between the time
[1:45:39] of
[1:45:41] Noah and what we see happening
[1:45:45] today because I believe we've had
[1:45:47] another
[1:45:49] change
[1:45:53] everyone here
[1:45:55] today
[1:45:57] knows that there has been a
[1:46:01] change isn't that
[1:46:03] right but we're not sure really what it
[1:46:07] is see that's why we have to find
[1:46:11] it in the in the road
[1:46:14] map in the
[1:46:17] blueprint in the
[1:46:19] scriptures and in the message so that we
[1:46:22] could know
[1:46:25] exactly where we're
[1:46:28] at and how we should act in this
[1:46:32] time because God wants us to
[1:46:36] know what the battle
[1:46:39] is and how to fight it you don't want to
[1:46:43] pull out a spear in this in this
[1:46:48] day when we're talking about Atomic
[1:46:54] weapons we have
[1:46:56] advanced the Warfare is at another
[1:47:01] level you can't pull out a slingshot
[1:47:06] today spiritually
[1:47:08] speaking you understand what I
[1:47:11] mean because I would take the sling of
[1:47:13] David any
[1:47:15] day but I'm talking about something
[1:47:19] else
[1:47:28] amen so we need to
[1:47:32] understand that Jesus the
[1:47:35] word is in our
[1:47:37] midst but also that the presence of the
[1:47:41] wicked
[1:47:43] one the Antichrist
[1:47:46] spirit is in our
[1:47:49] midst we need to know
[1:47:51] that and we need to know how to act when
[1:47:55] we see
[1:47:57] that how to
[1:48:00] respond how to protect
[1:48:03] ourselves and then how to combat
[1:48:08] that brother Bram teaches us in the
[1:48:10] message
[1:48:13] Shalom that the word sounds forth as
[1:48:18] music that that the word sounds forth as
[1:48:21] music from a great
[1:48:25] Symphony and the changes in the
[1:48:28] Rhythm that only the composer
[1:48:32] knows and he knows what it really
[1:48:37] means it's the composer who knows what
[1:48:40] it
[1:48:42] means the one who wrote the
[1:48:45] music he knows when the changes are
[1:48:49] coming and he likes to forewarn the
[1:48:54] orchestra when these changes are
[1:48:57] coming so that the violins can sound
[1:49:01] out not the
[1:49:04] drums not the trumpets but it's the
[1:49:07] violins that to
[1:49:10] change in the
[1:49:13] Junctions and he reveals
[1:49:15] it this Sheep
[1:49:17] music to who whoever is
[1:49:21] interested in knowing
[1:49:23] it that's what he teaches
[1:49:26] us in the message shalom
[1:49:39] shalom now when when Adam fell from
[1:49:42] eternity to
[1:49:46] time one of God's judgments
[1:49:51] was that God
[1:49:53] said I will put enity between thee and
[1:49:56] the
[1:49:59] woman between thy
[1:50:01] seed the serpent
[1:50:04] seed and her
[1:50:06] seed it was God who put the
[1:50:10] enity what does enity
[1:50:15] mean he wanted them
[1:50:19] separate not together but he put
[1:50:23] something in
[1:50:25] them that there would be a
[1:50:28] separation it was God that did
[1:50:34] that the author of the
[1:50:37] book the one who wrote the
[1:50:40] script that there would be a
[1:50:44] separation between those two
[1:50:48] seeds what a great thing that that
[1:50:51] is that that makes me Ponder when I when
[1:50:54] I think of such a
[1:50:58] thing that the author of the
[1:51:01] book the one who wrote the
[1:51:05] script plac those things in
[1:51:08] there and as one of the brothers
[1:51:11] said he created a powerful
[1:51:17] enemy and he wrote in there that there
[1:51:19] would be com
[1:51:22] ination between these two
[1:51:25] Powers but it was he the one it was God
[1:51:29] that wrote
[1:51:31] it he wrote it in the
[1:51:34] script and he knows the end from the
[1:51:38] beginning he has everything in his
[1:51:42] control Satan is not pulling anything
[1:51:45] over on
[1:51:47] God God is not worried about
[1:51:51] Satan one
[1:51:53] bit he wrote the
[1:51:57] script that's right that's
[1:52:05] right when the sons of
[1:52:08] God married those pretty Daughters of
[1:52:13] men God never forgave them for
[1:52:18] that
[1:52:23] it seems like such
[1:52:26] a simple
[1:52:31] thing especially when you go
[1:52:34] back and in each dispensation that we
[1:52:38] showed it got
[1:52:41] greater and greater and greater more
[1:52:45] deceiving more
[1:52:48] deceptive until we find ourselves in
[1:52:50] this
[1:52:57] day the purpose of the
[1:53:01] attraction was to cause an illegal
[1:53:05] Union between the daughters of
[1:53:08] Cain and the sons of
[1:53:12] Seth it was it caused a a a a
[1:53:18] degreg
[1:53:21] in
[1:53:22] humankind it
[1:53:25] degraded the human
[1:53:35] race everything that Jesus
[1:53:39] was notice
[1:53:41] this everything that Jesus
[1:53:44] was the second Adam he proved what the
[1:53:49] first first Adam was
[1:53:51] like and where he fell
[1:53:55] from the scriptures declare to
[1:53:59] us that if we look at everything that
[1:54:02] Jesus
[1:54:04] was we get a glimpse of the first
[1:54:09] Adam in Isaiah
[1:54:12] 96 it reads like this it says his name
[1:54:16] speaking of the second
[1:54:18] Adam his name Shall be Called
[1:54:23] wonderful
[1:54:24] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[1:54:29] father the Prince of
[1:54:31] Peace that doesn't sound like a junior
[1:54:34] God to
[1:54:36] me that's the way some people try to
[1:54:38] present Jesus
[1:54:41] today but he was the Everlasting
[1:54:45] father the Mighty
[1:54:48] God showing us
[1:54:50] what what what was the first Adam like
[1:54:53] what were the
[1:54:55] characteristics and what what caused
[1:54:58] this this downgrading of the human
[1:55:11] race now we're going to get into the
[1:55:14] great
[1:55:16] turmoil and brother brandham is going to
[1:55:18] tell us
[1:55:22] what was
[1:55:23] it that caused the sons of
[1:55:27] God to
[1:55:30] notice the daughters of
[1:55:33] men let's read it follow
[1:55:38] me notice and another thing that he did
[1:55:41] back
[1:55:44] there in the days of
[1:55:46] Noah we noticed that during that
[1:55:51] time in the change of
[1:55:54] dispensation when men began to
[1:55:58] multiply that during that time of this
[1:56:02] great
[1:56:03] turmoil when men's heart began to wax
[1:56:08] cold and away from God women became such
[1:56:13] an
[1:56:16] idol when the sons of God seen the
[1:56:18] daughters of men
[1:56:22] that they were
[1:56:24] fair and they became a sexual
[1:56:31] order look at it
[1:56:33] today what we're living in not speaking
[1:56:37] against honorable
[1:56:39] women sir no sir they're God's
[1:56:43] instrument but those who cared not for
[1:56:48] themselves there's so many on the
[1:56:50] opposite
[1:56:52] side just going about marrying and
[1:56:55] giving in
[1:56:58] marriage God said so in the
[1:57:01] Bible Jesus said before Noah's
[1:57:07] time that they would be
[1:57:09] married but he said they became a sexual
[1:57:16] order so when the women became Fair
[1:57:22] brother brandham says sexual
[1:57:24] order that they became
[1:57:28] fair and they looked because they had
[1:57:31] became a sexual
[1:57:35] order and what is sexual
[1:57:38] order the state of of the
[1:57:41] women became
[1:57:44] sexual in
[1:57:47] nature that's a change change that
[1:57:51] wasn't there was a time
[1:57:54] then that it wasn't like
[1:57:56] that but then there was an instant in
[1:58:01] time there was a change in
[1:58:05] dispensation that that
[1:58:08] happened let's keep on
[1:58:11] reading how the great turmoil in this
[1:58:14] world
[1:58:17] today realize that one thing
[1:58:21] that or and we
[1:58:24] realize the one thing that caused
[1:58:27] that now he's going to tell us what was
[1:58:30] the thing that
[1:58:34] caused the Bible said that the
[1:58:38] spirits the great spirits came
[1:58:42] down evil
[1:58:44] spirits and got into those
[1:58:47] people and then the those
[1:58:54] things so there was a instance
[1:59:00] time when those great powerful demons
[1:59:03] came
[1:59:06] down a change in
[1:59:09] dispensation the time when those two
[1:59:13] forces would meet each other on the
[1:59:18] Earth
[1:59:19] and they would make themselves
[1:59:22] manifest for a battle that started in
[1:59:26] heaven but that would end here in the
[1:59:29] earth and that was the
[1:59:31] change that was one of the first changes
[1:59:34] in a
[1:59:36] dispensation when this battle would be
[1:59:39] brought down to the
[1:59:42] Earth do you see what type of battle it
[1:59:46] was notice the the the Weaponry that
[1:59:50] they
[1:59:53] used but the
[1:59:55] objective the
[1:59:57] purpose was to get that false
[2:00:01] Union so they could so that they could
[2:00:06] degrade the sons of
[2:00:11] God and that
[2:00:13] battle is still on
[2:00:18] today
[2:00:21] we're still in the
[2:00:23] same same
[2:00:29] quote and we see the same evil spirits
[2:00:34] working in our
[2:00:38] day and and and
[2:00:40] notice not only
[2:00:42] that when all hell turns
[2:00:46] loose all Heaven turns loose also
[2:00:50] that's what people
[2:00:53] forget that there's two
[2:00:55] spirits and they both manifest
[2:00:59] themselves at the same
[2:01:01] time but there's two of them and
[2:01:04] sometimes we focus only on the evil
[2:01:08] spirit but at the same
[2:01:10] time the holy
[2:01:12] spirit is moving
[2:01:15] too and when the enemy comes in like a
[2:01:18] flood
[2:01:22] the spirit of God raises up a standard
[2:01:25] against and these two
[2:01:27] forces have always showed
[2:01:30] themselves at The Junction in the end
[2:01:34] time so we're at a junction in the end
[2:01:40] time and we see the same
[2:01:43] thing we' seen that those evil spirits
[2:01:45] have came down
[2:01:48] today
[2:01:50] and they're
[2:01:52] everywhere they're in our
[2:01:59] midst I want to insert a principle at
[2:02:02] this
[2:02:12] time and the scripture teaches
[2:02:15] us that Spirits don't
[2:02:17] die
[2:02:20] men that's possessed of these evil
[2:02:25] spirits they die but the spirits don't
[2:02:31] die Jesus told the Pharisees in in John
[2:02:38] 8 verse
[2:02:40] 43 he says this you know I wish I would
[2:02:44] have been able to stand there and and
[2:02:46] watch
[2:02:47] him
[2:02:49] as he said
[2:02:51] this he said why don't you understand my
[2:02:57] speech even because you cannot hear my
[2:03:03] words I would like to say that right
[2:03:05] something like
[2:03:06] that but I would have liked to have seen
[2:03:09] his the way he said
[2:03:15] it how he maybe moved his
[2:03:20] hands maybe as he stood
[2:03:24] there maybe he pointed at
[2:03:27] them I don't know how what he
[2:03:30] did but he said why is it that you don't
[2:03:33] understand my
[2:03:44] speech today
[2:03:47] o why is is
[2:03:50] it that most people can't understand our
[2:03:56] speech because we speak another
[2:03:59] language it's a Heavenly
[2:04:03] language and not all
[2:04:06] understand and that's why they say
[2:04:09] that's why the rumor
[2:04:10] is what was he talking
[2:04:13] about I didn't understand anything that
[2:04:15] he
[2:04:17] said
[2:04:21] that would that would uh uh startle me
[2:04:28] brotheru but he said why don't you
[2:04:30] understand my
[2:04:32] speech can't you hear my
[2:04:36] words he goes you are of your
[2:04:40] father the
[2:04:43] devil my
[2:04:46] goodness I'm sorry I'm sorry for
[2:04:49] laughing I just wish I would have seen
[2:04:52] him he would
[2:04:54] said you're of your father the
[2:04:57] devil that's why you can't understand
[2:05:02] me my goodness
[2:05:14] by there was Noah in his
[2:05:17] time here's Israel in their
[2:05:20] time he's talking about the different
[2:05:27] Junctions here's Abraham at the next
[2:05:33] Junction between the the natural
[2:05:38] world and the supernatural
[2:05:41] World Angels Came Down like
[2:05:47] men
[2:05:51] now I wish I could change subjects right
[2:05:55] now and go into the stages of
[2:06:00] Abraham remember when the Angels Came
[2:06:04] Down that was just
[2:06:08] after Abraham's name was
[2:06:11] changed and he received the Seal of the
[2:06:14] of
[2:06:17] circumcision
[2:06:20] you know 1 2 3 4 5
[2:06:26] 6 down comes the
[2:06:29] seal the Angels
[2:06:31] appear you
[2:06:35] understand
[2:06:40] amen and they stood by Abraham the
[2:06:46] prophet and told him Abra
[2:06:49] Abraham God will perform the
[2:06:54] supernatural about this time next
[2:06:57] year according to the time of
[2:07:03] life watch
[2:07:07] this and apply it to the
[2:07:12] message I'll visit

[2:07:56] transformed she will bring
[2:07:58] forth the promised

[2:08:29] and I knew this was going to
[2:08:32] happen but that's okay I'll show you my
[2:08:36] power
[2:08:38] Abraham we're at the junction
[2:08:42] time the evil spirits are down there in
[2:08:47] Sodom my my
[2:08:51] goodness they're working among the world

[2:08:56] there the evil
[2:08:58] spirits they're down there in
[2:09:00] Sodom and where was
[2:09:03] Abraham he was
[2:09:05] hidden he was out by
[2:09:08] himself he had separated
[2:09:11] himself and God had given him the Seal
[2:09:14] of
[2:09:16] circumcision and he had the name
[2:09:20] changed and that's when the Angels
[2:09:23] appeared that's when the message was
[2:09:25] revealed to
[2:09:27] him that's when God showed him the
[2:09:31] algebra stand to your
