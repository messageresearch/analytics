TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] okay god bless your brothers and sisters tonight we're going to continue our series of readings to start the children's service we're in book three of the series of books called supernatural life of William Branham the man and his commission 1946 to 1950 by Owen Jorgensen we finished the first chapter and our last reading this chapter is chapter 32 in the entire series counting the chapters from book 1 to now challenging insanity it's from 1946 and before we get started just a few comments to let you know that the we're going to read the first portion of chapter 32 and this is not only a tremendous chapter but I believe that this is getting into the fundamentals of the gift that William Mary and Branham was given by the Lord we're gonna hear some details revealed in this chapter that will carry forward and brother branham's life so the rest of his life and the Holy Spirit which carries it forward today to us so if you ever paid close attention to what we're going to share in this series I would wholeheartedly and sincerely recommend tonight listening closely and that goes for our children who are here tonight our young people as well as our children young at heart so as we get started after Kendon william branham held a week on healing campaign in Pine Bluff Arkansas and then moved on to Little Rock the state's capital Reverend Brown had rented a large auditorium not far from the Capitol building by now Bill's reputation had spread so far through word-of-mouth that the crowds attending the Little Rock meetings were larger than they were at Camden the auditorium quickly filled to capacity with many people left standing outside on the first night bill explained to angels Commission and told about the miracles he saw in Camden and Pine Bluff then he asked for all those who wanted prayer to form a line to his right hundreds of people rose to their feet at once and gradually with a great deal confusion formed a line over and over the organist played the tune to only believe while these people came forward one at a time for prayer when a person stood before him bill would graphs the patient's right hand with his own left hand if that person had a disease bill would instantly feel vibrations pulsing up his arm like a low-voltage electric current then in his left hand it would swell up red like it was infected in a series of white bumps would appear across the back of his hand from the pattern of these welts bill could tell what disease the person had speaking into the microphone so the audience could hear he would identify the problem ulcers tuberculosis cancer and so on his diagnosis was always correct then he would pray rebut condemned ins in the name of Jesus Christ as soon as the demons left the patient Bill's hand would return to its normal size and color then he would pronounce the patient healed and turned to receive the next person in line at this point a spontaneous murmur of amazement often escaped the lips of those watching these men and women had never seen anything like this before here was visible evidence of God in their midst and inspired many to weep reverent tears bill was as amazed by his gift as was everyone else before his commission it had never occurred to him that germs vibrated with life now he could not only feel the vibrations he could watch the physical reactions they caused it in his left hand both the red swelling and the white bumps which formed a pattern according to each disease the more bill used this gift the more he learned about the ways of demons for example by now he knew the reason these welts moved on the back of his hand was because the demon life of the disease that could become excited by the presence of the angel the spiritual significance of these germ or virus induced vibrations was also becoming more clear in his spare time between services bill read and reread the New Testament trying to understand the healing ministries of Jesus Peter and Paul and therefore to understand his own putting together two scriptures with his own thoughts about modern medicine it seemed to him that diseases have two sides one physical in the other spiritual the physical level was the actual germ or virus that a medical scientist could see through a microscope but from where did those germs or viruses come certainly not from God germs and viruses drew their life from the god-given life of the person they invaded in reading the biblical accounts of Jesus's own healing ministry bill recognized that germs and viruses are the physical signs of demonic powers just as any living creature has a physical and spiritual side to its life so does every disease medical doctors concerned themselves with the physiology of an illness whereas bill was dealing with the demonology the sign in his hand picked up their vibrations of that demonic life which was attacking the god-given life of a human being bill knew that the swelling of his hand couldn't heal anyone but it could build faith seeing a disease supernaturally revealed could raise a person's faith to the point where he or she could believe God was healing jesus said if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth it was Jesus doing the healing both then in that of course not every person's trouble needed a supernatural sign to disclose it some problems were obvious one man had a large red goiter protruding from his neck as soon as bill asked Jesus for the man's healing the goiter turned white dropped to the floor and rolled between Bill's feet a newspaper reporter flashed his camera and the next day a picture of this miracle appeared on the front page one crippled old man who had hobbled around on crutches for years was healed in the sight of everyone and walked off the platform carrying his crutches over his head while he shouted praises to Jesus Christ the next evening when the service began this man sat near the front with a sign on his back that read Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever as bill came out to the podium this man stood up and hollered say preacher I want to ask you something they'll acknowledge the man what is it dad I'm a Nazarene and when I first heard you preach I thought you were a Nazarene - then I saw how many Pentecostal people are in the meetings I thought sure you must be a Pentecostal then I heard you say you were a Baptist I don't get it that's easy dad bill we're pride I'm a Pentecostal Nazarene Baptist after the crowd quit laughing at his little joke bill said seriously I just represent the Lord Jesus Christ in His mercy the scripture says that by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and become one people Jesus is not going to ask us if we're Methodists or Baptists he's going to judge us but what is in our hearts night after night hundreds of people streamed forward for prayer taxing as it was on Bill's body he continued to pray for the sick and suffering until one two and sometimes three o'clock in the morning then Reverend Brown would lead him numb in in a haze of exhaustion to his hotel room where he would catch a half-dozen hours of fitful sleep one morning Reverend Brown woke him up to an emergency there's a mr. Kinney downstairs from Memphis Tennessee it seems his friend mr. D I want to break from the text here to explain that the letter D is used as a choice by brother Owen Jorgensen because brother Brennan did not disclose the name of the person so it is a generic identifier who is a postmaster there in Memphis he's dying with asthmatic pneumonia mr. Kinney flew up here to ask you to come pray for mr. D mr. Kinney had already booked you as seat on the plane to fly you over to Memphis this morning you should be able to get back by the time the meeting starts tonight I'll go downstairs and bring him up bill dressed and had him put on his coat while he heard the sound of a strong wind he assumed it was outside and he thought my it's awful windy today then he saw that supernatural light in his room hanging in the air rotating and pulsating with energy bill knelt by the bed soon he heard the voice of that angel say do not go there his time has come then the light vanished bill got up and took off his coat a few minutes later Reverend Brown returned with a man who looked stressed and anxious brother Branham my name is Kenny my friend mr. D is unconscious now but I've got faith that God can bill interrupted him sir the Holy Spirit just met me a few minutes ago and warned me not to go with you for thus saith the Lord the man is going to die you mean there's no hope he might be dead and when you return but I'll keep praying for him until I hear from you call me in the morning and let me know his condition never mind call me tonight because I'll be in the service until three o'clock at two or three o'clock in the morning that night after several hours of constant prayer for the sick Reverend Brown said brother Branham let me know when you need a little breather I want you to show I want to show you something in the basement of the auditorium it's a case like you've never seen before god bless you [Applause] god bless you Lisbon would you please stand to pray to begin the service supporting the VA para poder comenzar con su servicio Lauri Heavenly Father senior Padre celestial we're so grateful for the opportunity to be here before you presence once again mr.

inner Bibles what do you say well this is church this is children's church we read our Bible here we like the Bible what do you guys say we hear a Bible story thumbs up thumbs down let's give them a round of applause if you think that's a good idea okay Lilly go ahead guys take it away tell us the true story that happened in the Bible okay let's see sure let's see what's our story should I tell all right Daniel in the daunt Lions Den it is okay let's see it starts out when King Darius decided he needed some help to rule the people of Babylon Daniel had been the highest ruler in the kingdom under the previous king so of course because Daniel does such a good job Daniel did King Darius asked Daniel and two other man to rule under him oh what a great Kingdom we have for it is rich and prosperous with many people living in it well yes King Darius is under your protection I need help to reign over this land for I cannot do this all by myself I will put you Daniel and two other governors as rulers to help me reign this kingdom all right King Darius I will assist you but Daniel you are going to be my top adviser and ruler over the entire kingdom Thank You King I appreciate it when the two other rulers heard the news they got really upset because Daniel was so honest hard-working and faithful so they were jealous of him and wanted to do something about him can you believe King Darius I know promoting Daniel as his top ruler over all the kingdom why does King Darius find favor to him over us it's not right it's because he sees Daniel as a goody two-shoes we must develop a plan to dethrone his rule his role as top ruler we should but how I have an idea we need to find some charge against him concerning this kingdom what kind of charge Daniel is so faithful he has no faults we might not find any charge against Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God let's go commencing King Darius about a new decree to extract over his kingdom that's certainly to get rid of Daniel two advisers went to King Darius and explained your idea to him nice to see you rulers again why do it why do you rush to my place so quickly is there an urgent news about my kingdom yes sir we are discussing with the other councillors and rulers to build you a real statue to make a firm decree in order to increase loyalty in your kingdom you should extract a law that orders everyone to pray to you and forbids people from praying to other gods if they pray to another God they should be thrown into the Lions Den the law is written here sorry guys you kind of messed up I hold on okay [Applause] now when Daniel heard about the new decree he went home to his room and with the windows open he nailed down on his knees and prayed and gave thanks to God three times a day as he would always do every day he did not change his habit oh god I thank you every day Lord help my people Lord thank you for every day of my life Lord and I will serve you with all my heart why do you come to why do you come to rush to me so quickly it's about Daniel he prayed to his God last night and broke the law about praying to another God except you Daniel he's a good man I can't throw them into the lion's den your laws can not change and you can't overlook this one instant throw him into the Lions Den bring Daniel and cast him to the lines then for he has broken a law under my decree the two wicked jealous rulers who despised Daniel quickly rushed to tell King Darius about Daniel's crime Oh Daniel I'm sorry for this your God for whom you serve continually he will deliver you it's a right King I understand but I have them haven't done no wrong but I'll accept my mistake as Daniel went cast into the line stand overnight King Darius was devastated that Daniel had to be thrown into the Lions stance the king could not eat or sleep all night at dawn he ran to the line stand to check on Daniel [Music] Daniel has your God protect you from the dangerous lions as King Darius look into the lion's den he said he saw Daniel was alive and the Lions had not threatened Daniel the whole time he was there for God had protected him that night and Daniel replied to the king my god I said the angel and shut the mouth of the Lions they have no they haven't heard me because I found anything in his side no I have ever done any wrong before you King oh great joy I have for God has protected you in the lion's den now those rulers who have accused you for breaking the law I will command that they get thrown in the line stand with their families for you are innocent for I will make a decree that everyone in this kingdom fears and trembles and follows the god of Daniel for he is a living God amen god bless you all [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if the musicians could come on out let's have the puppet stick their little heads out so we can see the puppets along with the family I think this is uh this is beautiful then we get together and as soon as they pop out I think I want to give everybody a round of applause again please see Daniel would not stop praying no matter what they did puppets ki just stay out here please while I talk about you Daniel would not stop praying how many of us would dare to stop praying if they told us that we're gonna throw us in the lion's den ooh sometimes we don't even pray at school cuz they're looking at us when we're gonna pray for our food and there's no Alliance there's not even detention for that but how many say Lord I wanna be like Daniel I want to be brave so I want to show you a song I know we have the lyrics up there it's called even if he doesn't and that means even if God doesn't save you are you still gonna give in I like I know God can save me from the Lions Den that's what Daniel said I know God can save me from the Lions Den but even if he doesn't I'm still gonna keep praying like the children of Israel when they got thrown into the fiery furnace my God can deliver us from that fiery furnace but even if he does since I will not bow down to the idol so this is how the song goes you ready well you can throw my body in the fire if you want yeah you can turn the heater up a little
