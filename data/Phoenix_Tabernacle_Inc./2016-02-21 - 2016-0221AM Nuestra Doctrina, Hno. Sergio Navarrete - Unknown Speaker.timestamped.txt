[24:20] the Bible is more than just a book and
[24:23] what I grew up hearing as a child was

[24:31] Glory oh Lord take me into that most
[24:34] inner
[24:35] Veil father I want a hidden life if a
[24:39] demon possessed man has two three times
[24:41] his strength then how much more strength
[24:43] should a born again son and daughter God
[24:45] have who've been given the Holy Spirit
[24:47] of Jesus
[24:48] Christ to break through those chains of
[24:51] addiction alcoholism depression to break
[24:54] through that holier than now religious
[24:57] spirit to strength to lay your burdens
[24:59] down upon the feet of Jesus Christ were
[25:02] my burdens laid and I laid them down
[25:04] just to piig up pick up a big old wooden
[25:06] cross and I'm glad to say that's a
[25:08] pretty fair
[25:10] trade Lord I just want a little bit of
[25:12] Faith Like job to look past my
[25:14] circumstances and symptoms and anchor
[25:16] myself in those three little words God
[25:19] said
[25:19] so that's right and Lord I admit that
[25:23] sometimes when I kneel down and pray I
[25:25] feel like I'm talking to a brick wall
[25:26] but at Thy word Lord standing on your
[25:29] word is where I'll stay
[25:32] am oh Lord Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross

[48:45] here this morning to present my
[48:52] grandson let me just share a little bit
[48:54] with
[48:55] you
[49:00] [Music]
[49:04] for 10 years my children weren't able to
[49:06] have children of their
[49:14] own but seeing in the scriptures that
[49:17] God always give to the women that are
[49:19] not who are
[49:23] sterile I grabbed on to his word and I
[49:26] began to
[49:29] pray and then after 10 years the first
[49:33] came and then the second one
[49:36] came and then the third one
[49:39] comes now it's the fourth
[49:49] one and my son has a barber shop of his
[49:52] own so you know I told him you have six
[49:53] chairs you you have both you and your
[49:55] wife who are bar and now you're going to
[49:57] have your four children who could be
[49:58] there one
[50:01] day and but then he says then I need a I
[50:04] need to uh somebody on the cash
[50:08] register and then I well that's up to
[50:14] you the name of this young
[50:20] one yoseph Adriel Korea Valencia his
[50:24] name is Joseph Adriel Korea Valencia
[50:29] children are not
[50:33] baptized they are presented before the
[50:35] Lord
[50:39] Jesus that's
[50:42] why I would like to read the scripture
[50:45] if you want to join me it's in Mark
[50:55] 10:13
[51:01] and they brought young children to him
[51:02] that he should touch them and his
[51:04] disciples rebuke those that brought
[51:14] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[51:17] displeased and he said unto them suffer
[51:19] the little children to come unto me and
[51:21] forbid them not for of such is the
[51:23] kingdom of
[51:25] God
[51:31] verily I say unto you whoever shall not
[51:33] receive the kingdom of God as a little
[51:35] child you shall not enter
[51:41] therein and he took them up in his arms
[51:44] put his hands upon them and blessed
[51:49] them so we will be taking this young
[51:52] one my

[1:19:05] morning we'd like to speak a little bit
[1:19:10] on on a small uh
[1:19:14] thought that we believe God placed it in
[1:19:17] our
[1:19:21] hearts when I refer to God having placed
[1:19:24] it in my heart
[1:19:29] I always try to illustrate it in a
[1:19:31] certain
[1:19:33] way me just like
[1:19:36] you I hear the word of
[1:19:39] God and that word of
[1:19:42] God makes contact with an internal
[1:19:45] being that internal
[1:19:48] being starts
[1:19:52] meditating and that's when those
[1:19:55] uh thoughts become un unroll
[1:20:00] rolled that's the way I can describe
[1:20:08] it first up there on the screen we have
[1:20:10] the scripture which we're going to be
[1:20:13] reading if you could please stand just
[1:20:15] for a few
[1:20:20] moments because maybe later on during
[1:20:22] the service you're going to be
[1:20:23] sitting
[1:20:31] the scripture says in 2 Timothy verse 4
[1:20:35] or chapter 4 verse
[1:20:51] 1 I charge ye therefore before God God
[1:20:55] and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:20:56] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:20:59] appearing and his
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:12] [Music]
[1:21:17] kingdom when you pass 40 it's a
[1:21:23] little no
[1:21:39] preach the word be instant in season out
[1:21:42] of season rep reprove rebuke exhort with
[1:21:46] all longsuffering and
[1:21:53] Doctrine
[1:22:06] for the time will come when they will
[1:22:07] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[1:22:10] their own lust they shall Heap into
[1:22:12] themselves teachers having itching
[1:22:16] ears you may be
[1:22:23] seated
[1:22:26] those are scriptures that I believe are
[1:22:27] are well
[1:22:35] known and I remember when us ministers
[1:22:38] used to get
[1:22:44] together those are scriptures that in
[1:22:46] that uh that uh that with that group of
[1:22:49] people they're very well
[1:22:53] known
[1:22:57] he that Paul is talk speaking to
[1:23:04] Timothy and he's letting them know in
[1:23:07] advance what's going to happen amen
[1:23:14] amen in our
[1:23:19] times a great message
[1:23:23] came
[1:23:25] a powerful man sent by
[1:23:29] God and he
[1:23:33] came and he told us
[1:23:39] this I preach the same as the Apostle
[1:23:42] Paul amen is that
[1:23:46] right actually I
[1:23:51] know that the things that we're going to
[1:23:53] speak be speaking on this morning
[1:23:55] morning truly aren't
[1:23:59] new and for that reason because they're
[1:24:01] not
[1:24:03] new they kind of bore us a little
[1:24:07] bit don't tell me they
[1:24:10] don't because it's the
[1:24:14] truth while the services was going on
[1:24:20] here we were patiently waiting in the
[1:24:22] back room right here
[1:24:26] and our brother Johnny
[1:24:28] alv he was talking speaking with
[1:24:35] us how many of us remember uh last
[1:24:38] Sunday what a wonderful message he
[1:24:42] brought well he who knows a little bit
[1:24:44] about the
[1:24:46] message can
[1:24:49] understand and what level he was
[1:24:51] speaking
[1:24:53] on or let's put it this
[1:24:58] way in which manner the Holy Spirit was
[1:25:03] speaking through a servant of God amen
[1:25:09] amen I know that we're not all on the
[1:25:12] same
[1:25:13] level I know
[1:25:16] that well I make this small
[1:25:23] comment because if he was speaking in
[1:25:25] this
[1:25:28] level today we're going to be speaking
[1:25:29] on this
[1:25:32] level but it has to do with the
[1:25:38] same he made a comment that really
[1:25:40] grabbed my
[1:25:43] attention he said us the
[1:25:47] old we can't throw the young to the
[1:25:53] side
[1:25:54] no because we need the young amen
[1:26:02] amen that takes
[1:26:06] effect when we apply it to our spiritual
[1:26:09] life
[1:26:13] am another little thing that I
[1:26:17] heard is that he made a
[1:26:23] comment and that's something that we're
[1:26:25] going over in the back right
[1:26:27] now he was commenting on
[1:26:31] it and I feel led to comment
[1:26:36] it because it goes along with what we're
[1:26:38] going to speak
[1:26:39] today how it was that
[1:26:44] Moses the people were circumcised
[1:26:47] once and
[1:26:51] then when the Great uh Warrior Joshua
[1:26:56] came they had to circumcise
[1:27:02] again a little weak it's
[1:27:07] okay I'm just saying what we're
[1:27:09] listening
[1:27:10] to so it's very
[1:27:13] important the
[1:27:14] circumcision amen
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:24] now we want to speak a little bit on our
[1:27:32] Doctrine that's our small thought this
[1:27:37] morning our
[1:27:43] Doctrine me when I'm listening to the
[1:27:48] message when I'm here in this
[1:27:50] place and I'm sitting
[1:27:52] there listening to the
[1:27:56] minister I'm very hard of
[1:28:00] learning but I do get the small simple
[1:28:07] things for example our brother Ernie
[1:28:10] Bruna
[1:28:13] Senor I'm be trying to be sure to say
[1:28:15] his name
[1:28:16] correctly because many years
[1:28:19] ago it was his turn to
[1:28:22] preach I saw his smile
[1:28:27] and in that time I was the director of I
[1:28:29] was the song
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:33] leader he knows what I'm talking
[1:28:38] about brother Ser was the director of
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:51] songs and you know I I was s and I was
[1:28:54] like no you know brothers and I started
[1:28:56] going on and you know how sometimes
[1:28:58] we're
[1:29:00] little and when I said his
[1:29:03] name
[1:29:05] Al I said brother Alex barunda
[1:29:09] Jr you guys know we we
[1:29:15] make but I'm pretty sure that one of the
[1:29:17] times that he he
[1:29:20] ministered he
[1:29:22] commented about the import
[1:29:25] of our name amen
[1:29:31] amen he said that the the prophet said
[1:29:33] the sweetest thing that me and you can
[1:29:37] hear is your own name amen
[1:29:44] amen so he made mention of when the Lord
[1:29:47] Jesus Christ hears his
[1:29:49] name that there he's sitting
[1:29:53] down
[1:29:55] well he gets emotional he he likes
[1:29:59] it well wait what do you mean a
[1:30:01] Christian isn't supposed to get all
[1:30:03] emotional let's speak
[1:30:08] clearly let's be
[1:30:12] sincere he
[1:30:16] likes he pleases
[1:30:20] him and
[1:30:22] actually
[1:30:28] it seems that his name is being taken
[1:30:30] out of our
[1:30:34] worship I'm not critiquing in the
[1:30:37] incorrect
[1:30:39] way because there's good
[1:30:42] critiques and incorrect
[1:30:45] critiques we're trying to be right down
[1:30:47] the
[1:30:49] middle so then how
[1:30:52] important is it that he hears his
[1:30:56] name because neither you nor
[1:30:59] I can make contact with
[1:31:06] God if we don't go through the name
[1:31:09] which he gave us
[1:31:10] to if you go to God in the
[1:31:15] name of William maram
[1:31:18] Brandon he will not listen to
[1:31:22] you you heard me right
[1:31:24] right if you
[1:31:27] go to go ask something of
[1:31:31] God now God is an object of
[1:31:34] worship you go you get on your
[1:31:39] knees Lord I need
[1:31:42] this in the name of William Mari and
[1:31:46] Bram he's not listening to
[1:31:49] you actually he doesn't see
[1:31:52] us
[1:31:54] is the first disadvantage we have in
[1:31:56] front of God he doesn't see us the
[1:32:00] prophet says that if he would see
[1:32:03] us he would have destroyed us
[1:32:06] already the only thing he
[1:32:08] sees is that precious
[1:32:12] blood that covers the whole
[1:32:17] earth brother I thought it just covered
[1:32:19] me no
[1:32:22] sir
[1:32:24] it covers every human being that
[1:32:27] exists because every
[1:32:29] person
[1:32:31] has the
[1:32:34] opportunity to accept the
[1:32:37] sacrifice so
[1:32:39] then if we come
[1:32:41] there
[1:32:46] and whatever Idol that may
[1:32:49] exist whatever name that might
[1:32:52] exist
[1:32:55] if you go before God and you ask
[1:32:59] something in the name of that
[1:33:01] Idol he won't
[1:33:05] answer
[1:33:07] imagine if he doesn't answer
[1:33:10] you if you use the name of William Mari
[1:33:12] and
[1:33:13] Brandon well from there go on down the
[1:33:16] list whoever you want to
[1:33:19] place the idol that you want to place
[1:33:22] there won't
[1:33:25] answer be sure of
[1:33:28] that so
[1:33:31] then he came and he told
[1:33:33] us brother Bram came and he told
[1:33:37] us I understand that he's the
[1:33:41] angel I understand that to him was given
[1:33:43] the
[1:33:45] Mysteries I understand that there's no
[1:33:47] more
[1:33:49] Mysteries if there's a mystery there
[1:33:51] that I don't understand is because of
[1:33:55] because I don't
[1:33:57] understand but the mystery has been
[1:34:00] revealed all the
[1:34:01] Mysteries have been
[1:34:04] revealed
[1:34:07] now our
[1:34:11] Doctrine to speak about our
[1:34:15] Doctrine we need to know what is a
[1:34:19] Doctrine well the dictionary
[1:34:22] says there's many many different
[1:34:26] definitions but the dictionary
[1:34:36] says set of ideas teachings or
[1:34:39] principles defended by a religious
[1:34:43] movement
[1:34:46] also It also says that
[1:34:52] Doctrine
[1:34:59] a belief or set of beliefs held and Tau
[1:35:02] by a church political party or any other
[1:35:06] group in other
[1:35:08] words a
[1:35:10] Doctrine it's a
[1:35:13] teaching it brings
[1:35:16] instructions it tells you how to
[1:35:21] function that Doctrine is to learn
[1:35:24] it or to teach
[1:35:26] it and there's many kinds of
[1:35:30] doctrines the the dictionary tells us
[1:35:34] that says that there's Christian
[1:35:36] doctrine watch how they place it there's
[1:35:40] Christian
[1:35:41] doctrine there's church
[1:35:47] doctrine and
[1:35:52] H
[1:36:02] astrology there's astrology
[1:36:07] Doctrine there's different kinds of
[1:36:10] Doctrine it's a belief amen
[1:36:14] amen that's what the dictionary
[1:36:21] says now a question for you please don't
[1:36:25] answer what is our
[1:36:30] belief it's to meditate
[1:36:33] right well if you know the
[1:36:39] message you're going to say the same
[1:36:40] thing that the messenger
[1:36:44] said here he's speaking in church
[1:36:49] order it's in the year
[1:36:52] 1958
[1:36:57] also in 63 he went back to order of the
[1:37:01] church now for that one yes I cut
[1:37:06] that I know that from
[1:37:09] 1963 when those seven angels
[1:37:12] came it's a new
[1:37:14] order amen I know
[1:37:16] that I'm not speaking on
[1:37:19] that remember what I told
[1:37:21] you we're on this level right here right
[1:37:25] here on the
[1:37:29] earth because when you make contact with
[1:37:32] the
[1:37:33] earth look I'm going to give you an
[1:37:36] example in the morning wake up
[1:37:39] early don't put any shoes on go
[1:37:44] outside and make contact with the
[1:37:47] Earth let's see what you
[1:37:50] feel you're going to feel a contact a
[1:37:53] physical
[1:37:56] contact and that's going to help you
[1:37:58] throughout the whole
[1:38:00] day because your body since
[1:38:03] this it makes contact with the
[1:38:07] dirt and since we're like
[1:38:10] trees something happens to
[1:38:15] us that's why the majority of people are
[1:38:17] all
[1:38:19] sick they don't make contact with
[1:38:22] nature
[1:38:24] and the spiritual is the same
[1:38:29] thing we have to make contact spiritual
[1:38:32] contact with
[1:38:34] God and you don't got to go
[1:38:38] anywhere God already has you
[1:38:41] ready and he's inside of
[1:38:44] you now that's to
[1:38:46] debate I understand that
[1:38:49] too but let's go see what brother
[1:38:51] brandham
[1:38:52] says now
[1:38:56] watch right now that I mentioned brother
[1:38:58] Brandon's
[1:38:59] name this thought comes to
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:06] me just like our songs brother Ernie as
[1:39:08] you
[1:39:09] mentioned I've mentioned it as well a
[1:39:12] couple of us have mentioned
[1:39:14] it but God gives us a little bit
[1:39:17] more and this thought came to
[1:39:19] me that
[1:39:22] way
[1:39:30] the same way like our our our our songs
[1:39:32] no longer contain so much of the name
[1:39:38] Jesus watch the Ministers of the
[1:39:44] message 100 times they'll say the name
[1:39:46] of William Mari and
[1:39:48] Bram and once or twice Jesus Christ's
[1:39:51] name that's wrong
[1:39:55] because he didn't save
[1:39:57] us the one that paid the
[1:39:59] price was God
[1:40:02] himself in a human
[1:40:05] body that had the
[1:40:08] name the Lord Jesus
[1:40:15] Christ because that that's why that the
[1:40:18] heir of this Holy
[1:40:21] Spirit doesn't make contact with the
[1:40:25] believer because there is Jesus
[1:40:28] Christ in the form of the Holy
[1:40:32] Ghost but also there's the
[1:40:36] Antichrist in form of a
[1:40:41] spirit and
[1:40:43] we like
[1:40:45] humans we're so
[1:40:48] human that we look like
[1:40:51] Adam first thing
[1:40:55] did he went went and he hid in between
[1:40:58] the
[1:41:00] trees he knew he was
[1:41:03] naked and he covered
[1:41:06] himself that's why the
[1:41:09] Christian can't have the
[1:41:13] victory because he's only covered with
[1:41:16] religion did you
[1:41:19] know that religion is of
[1:41:22] Satan
[1:41:25] it's started in the Tower of
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:28] Babel but there's
[1:41:32] Christians not not
[1:41:36] religion but to be a Son of God or a
[1:41:38] daughter of God or a
[1:41:39] chrisan starts inside of
[1:41:42] you inside of
[1:41:47] me that's why we're always
[1:41:50] defeated I'm waiting on God this is me
[1:41:55] okay and say what I say
[1:41:57] please forgive my
[1:42:00] expression here's brother said oh oh
[1:42:04] God come to me
[1:42:09] id
[1:42:12] idiot I'm inside of
[1:42:15] you and you haven't realized
[1:42:20] it the messenger
[1:42:22] says
[1:42:24] when you're
[1:42:26] born there's a spirit that's around
[1:42:31] you that's the spirit of
[1:42:33] Satan because
[1:42:37] you because you already have that
[1:42:39] representation inside of
[1:42:41] you the
[1:42:43] problem the problem
[1:42:47] is that we have to discover
[1:42:51] it the only
[1:42:54] the
[1:42:56] only that didn't have
[1:42:59] soul was the
[1:43:04] serpent think about
[1:43:07] that he didn't have a
[1:43:10] soul he had a
[1:43:13] spirit but he didn't have a soul the
[1:43:18] soul is the nature of the
[1:43:21] spirit Adam when he
[1:43:24] sinned when he
[1:43:31] sinned he sinned and we were never able
[1:43:35] to be like him amen
[1:43:38] amen because we were already
[1:43:42] born with a Fall Fallen
[1:43:46] nature but it's
[1:43:49] nature it's a
[1:43:52] nature listen to
[1:43:54] me it's a
[1:43:57] nature and that's God's
[1:44:00] nature how
[1:44:03] brother if you have to
[1:44:06] repent you have to be
[1:44:09] justified you have to be cleaned by the
[1:44:11] word be
[1:44:15] Sanctified and then comes the baptism of
[1:44:17] the Holy
[1:44:19] Ghost and many times the the minister
[1:44:21] didn't even say it right
[1:44:25] because the message the future home of
[1:44:26] the Bride brother Bram
[1:44:30] says that he's
[1:44:32] coming that the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:35] coming in
[1:44:37] fire in
[1:44:41] fire it's to clean out all our
[1:44:45] impurities that's the new
[1:44:48] birth and brother what is the new birth
[1:44:53] re is a personal
[1:44:58] revelation is the personal
[1:45:01] revelation of Jesus
[1:45:03] Christ in
[1:45:06] you a
[1:45:09] revelation it's something that you can
[1:45:12] see but it doesn't
[1:45:14] mean that it isn't
[1:45:17] there it's right
[1:45:19] there but you need to be able to see it
[1:45:23] that's why the scripture
[1:45:26] says faith cometh by
[1:45:28] hearing the prophet says just a
[1:45:32] moment but
[1:45:35] hearing isn't Faith did you hear me
[1:45:40] hearing isn't
[1:45:43] faith faith is already in you it has to
[1:45:49] sprout it has to sprout inside of you
[1:45:53] inside of you there's a
[1:45:55] soul and that soul is
[1:45:57] Fallen it's
[1:46:00] dirty but inside of that
[1:46:04] soul is God's
[1:46:07] soul and when you hear the
[1:46:09] word little by little it starts cleaning
[1:46:14] it starts
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:19] cleaning so then why are we waiting
[1:46:24] why haven't we been
[1:46:26] penetrated
[1:46:30] impregnated by man's
[1:46:32] dogmas they have taught
[1:46:35] us that everything comes from the
[1:46:37] outside
[1:46:39] in to have control over the Sons and
[1:46:42] Daughters of
[1:46:45] God God wants to have control of you and
[1:46:47] of
[1:46:49] me and for him to have control of you
[1:46:51] and me
[1:46:54] it's because he's in
[1:46:56] you he's always been in
[1:46:59] you oh brother bham
[1:47:04] says when your people know who they
[1:47:08] are when your bride knows who she
[1:47:13] is and there we are in the avocado
[1:47:17] tree waiting for the avocado to
[1:47:20] fall it's inside of you and inside of
[1:47:26] when have you ever seen that Satan was
[1:47:28] first
[1:47:31] where Lucifer was
[1:47:35] created Lucifer was created by
[1:47:38] God and when he
[1:47:42] found that you're
[1:47:44] not that he wasn't
[1:47:50] perfect he became then he started going
[1:47:52] down and he came into
[1:47:55] Satan and Satan is like a good
[1:47:59] adversary and then he started AC like
[1:48:01] the
[1:48:01] devil Father of
[1:48:05] Lies that is Satan that is
[1:48:09] Lucifer but the Son of
[1:48:14] God
[1:48:17] you you've always been a child of
[1:48:21] God
[1:48:25] if you're
[1:48:26] sick you've already been
[1:48:30] healed what you need to do is accept
[1:48:33] it accept
[1:48:36] it the brother put such a precious
[1:48:40] example there was the blind
[1:48:42] man the brother prayed for
[1:48:45] him and he started testifying I can see
[1:48:49] I can
[1:48:51] see that's how
[1:48:54] brother I can see I can see I can see I
[1:49:00] can see I can see I can see and one
[1:49:06] day this miserable
[1:49:09] one is going to be able to
[1:49:12] [Applause]
[1:49:16] see we believe in an Apostolic
[1:49:21] Church
[1:49:24] teaching the apostolic
[1:49:27] blessings for people of this
[1:49:32] day we
[1:49:35] believe in the Full
[1:49:37] Gospel that
[1:49:40] means if he's
[1:49:43] saying that we believe in the Full
[1:49:45] Gospel it means that somewhere
[1:49:48] there there's an incomplete
[1:49:51] gospel
[1:49:54] which one are you listening
[1:49:56] to and which one am I listening
[1:50:03] to We Believe in an Apostolic
[1:50:06] Church what's that brother Sergio read
[1:50:09] your
[1:50:10] Bible go to
[1:50:13] acts look how the first apostles
[1:50:18] acted brother Sergio but you should give
[1:50:20] all the
[1:50:21] information who told you
[1:50:24] that who told you that
[1:50:26] lie I'm speaking from my heart like a
[1:50:30] Son of
[1:50:33] God your responsibility as son or
[1:50:35] daughter of
[1:50:36] God is to do the same thing I
[1:50:40] did go and dig through the
[1:50:44] scriptures because
[1:50:47] there you will find eternal
[1:50:51] life
[1:50:56] that's just a
[1:50:59] courtesy because the Son of
[1:51:02] God more than all the
[1:51:05] minister should consider the
[1:51:09] people and recognize that God has placed
[1:51:12] a gift in
[1:51:14] him and not like God is
[1:51:18] learning and come and
[1:51:21] say brother oh or
[1:51:24] son since I like you here's a
[1:51:29] gift here goes another gift brother
[1:51:33] no let's keep
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:47] reading and believe that all the signs
[1:51:49] and wonders that was spoken by our Lord
[1:51:51] Jesus Christ would accompany his church
[1:51:53] until he
[1:51:55] returned do we believe
[1:51:59] that Brothers in The Invisible audience
[1:52:02] do we believe
[1:52:03] that I can't hear it
[1:52:06] brother but when I see
[1:52:09] you your acts will prove it to
[1:52:12] me my Works will show it to
[1:52:16] you my Works will demonstrate to all of
[1:52:18] you Brothers you know my
[1:52:20] life and if you know me
[1:52:24] you know that when I commit an error I
[1:52:27] try to fix
[1:52:28] it but I don't stay right there the
[1:52:32] ground that's what I did out in the
[1:52:35] world I
[1:52:38] would I would roll
[1:52:42] around not like
[1:52:45] you but I would get all rolled
[1:52:48] over but when I
[1:52:50] came to the understanding
[1:52:54] of who I
[1:52:55] am something inside of
[1:52:58] me I don't have the
[1:53:00] quote but brother bam
[1:53:03] says when you have the Holy
[1:53:06] Ghost that's another thing we're going
[1:53:07] to get into
[1:53:08] it Jesus Christ
[1:53:10] himself is inside of
[1:53:14] you and everything that's not
[1:53:17] correct it starts getting thrown
[1:53:20] out oh I believe I
[1:53:24] thought I thought that first I have to
[1:53:26] be real
[1:53:27] good be born
[1:53:30] again so that Jesus Christ can be inside
[1:53:32] of
[1:53:33] me who told you that
[1:53:37] lie when the Holy Ghost is in
[1:53:41] you which is the Lord Jesus
[1:53:45] Christ everything that is not
[1:53:48] correct everything that is
[1:53:51] incorrect he starts throwing it
[1:53:54] [Applause]
[1:53:55] out that's the God that I
[1:53:59] serve that works inside of
[1:54:02] me to throw everything out of
[1:54:06] me not to grab something and put it on
[1:54:11] and be a
[1:54:12] saint that's garbage that's
[1:54:15] religion that's of the
[1:54:21] devil
[1:54:23] God doesn't learn brother and
[1:54:25] sisters we
[1:54:30] learn we believe in those
[1:54:33] things and
[1:54:36] believe they are to be set in
[1:54:39] order that the church has its
[1:54:42] Order each church has its Doctrine and
[1:54:46] Order and
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:51] discipline
[1:54:58] we believe in the water
[1:54:59] baptism by IM
[1:55:02] Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[1:55:06] Christ which is the apostolic teaching
[1:55:09] of the
[1:55:14] Bible we believe ination by
[1:55:21] faith you didn't know there it's in the
[1:55:23] Bible Romans
[1:55:29] 51 we believe that after a person being
[1:55:31] justified by faith has peace with the
[1:55:34] Lord Jesus
[1:55:36] Christ here's the
[1:55:45] clue but it's possible that this same
[1:55:48] person could have the habits such as
[1:55:49] drinking smoking doing things that he
[1:55:51] should not do filthy habits of the
[1:55:55] flesh we already know that right amen
[1:55:57] correct
[1:55:59] amen but can we swallow
[1:56:04] that or should we continue with that
[1:56:07] religious
[1:56:14] covering I believe that the scripture
[1:56:19] teaches that gifts and callings are
[1:56:21] without repentance
[1:56:28] amen that when we are born in this world
[1:56:31] we are sent here by one purpose that is
[1:56:33] of
[1:56:35] god so that is not just for
[1:56:38] me or for the minister that's right here
[1:56:40] behind the or around the
[1:56:43] world it's for every son and daughter of
[1:56:51] God
[1:56:56] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:56:57] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:56:59] service of the
[1:57:02] Lord and that's we believe in
[1:57:10] sanctification and we also
[1:57:14] believe that after the person has been
[1:57:18] Sanctified unclean habits have gone from
[1:57:21] the person
[1:57:24] he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus
[1:57:28] Christ you remember brother Bernie would
[1:57:30] sometimes tell
[1:57:36] us don't you believe that acts let's
[1:57:39] just say just for example acts one or
[1:57:41] acts
[1:57:42] two then acts four no no
[1:57:47] no the Bible has its correct
[1:57:51] sequence
[1:57:53] and we take
[1:57:56] that you see justification
[1:57:59] sanctification baptism Holy
[1:58:02] Ghost it's
[1:58:05] correct but watch how we apply
[1:58:11] it we believe then that he is a
[1:58:14] candidate for the baptism of the Holy go
[1:58:17] Spirit which comes as a filling of the
[1:58:21] believer
[1:58:24] that's where we might start
[1:58:37] disagreeing we believe that the holy
[1:58:39] spirit is putting the same vessel in
[1:58:48] service brother Bram says in early
[1:58:50] spiritual experiences
[1:58:55] that constitutes the new
[1:58:57] birth three elements amen
[1:59:00] amen
[1:59:02] water blood
[1:59:05] spirit go to that
[1:59:08] message he's speaking about the Lord
[1:59:10] Jesus
[1:59:11] Christ and those three
[1:59:14] elements applied to the
[1:59:17] believer give you the new new
[1:59:20] birth but where does it start
[1:59:23] everything that God
[1:59:25] created everything that God
[1:59:27] created he created it through faith yes
[1:59:30] or
[1:59:32] yes faith is
[1:59:34] revelation and he spoke the
[1:59:37] word and he had faith in what he
[1:59:40] spoke and there it
[1:59:43] was without god without
[1:59:47] faith it's impossible to please
[1:59:50] God you you have to have
[1:59:54] faith you have to have
[1:59:59] Revelation you have to find that
[2:00:02] Revelation inside of
[2:00:05] you because inside of
[2:00:09] you is the representation of
[2:00:12] God when you can see
[2:00:15] that is when you hear the
[2:00:18] word the word of
[2:00:20] God is the original
[2:00:23] seed that
[2:00:26] word makes
[2:00:28] contact with that internal
[2:00:31] person and from there Sprouts
[2:00:38] life from there Sprouts life from
[2:00:43] where from inside of
[2:00:46] you because you have a
[2:00:49] soul you're not a descendant
[2:00:53] of the
[2:00:55] serpent you are God's
[2:00:57] seed you think that God Is Gonna Come
[2:01:02] and it's gonna
[2:01:06] say mo you ready there's the
[2:01:10] seed you think
[2:01:12] that
[2:01:15] meditate
[2:01:18] meditate you believe
[2:01:20] that
[2:01:22] that God is jumping from person to
[2:01:24] person
[2:01:27] seing the the farmer has already
[2:01:30] se he already put the good
[2:01:33] seed the one that fell on good
[2:01:36] dirt one gave 30 a
[2:01:39] 70 another gave a
[2:01:43] 100 but why do we want someone to
[2:01:46] give if they're only going to give
[2:01:48] 30
[2:01:50] huh that's
[2:01:59] scripture this is where I wanted to get
[2:02:03] to brother Bernie preached
[2:02:08] minimum 28
[2:02:11] messages of the three stages of GRA is
[2:02:14] that
[2:02:15] right for those who have heard who
[2:02:19] haven't well let's listen hear
[2:02:22] it three stages of
[2:02:25] Grace and here brother Bram
[2:02:27] says the holy
[2:02:31] spirit is not another step of
[2:02:38] Grace but more of the same Grace that
[2:02:40] fills the
[2:02:42] believer where does it fill him
[2:02:44] from if the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:02:47] says that when you come to
[2:02:50] him rivers of Living
[2:02:54] Water rivers of living
[2:02:56] water come from you from your
[2:03:04] soul don't look
[2:03:06] outside look
[2:03:08] [Applause]
[2:03:10] inside the Deep isn't
[2:03:12] up it's down it's down it's
[2:03:18] down it's
[2:03:20] down down
[2:03:24] down the more you dig inside of you
[2:03:28] inside of
[2:03:30] you you're going to
[2:03:32] find that which I'm speaking to you
[2:03:38] of one time brother Ernie uh commented I
[2:03:42] don't know if it was in
[2:03:44] Brazil and brother BR says it all has
[2:03:46] said it
[2:03:48] all he said the seed the the the
[2:03:54] seed has the power inside of
[2:03:57] itself it has
[2:04:02] everything it has
[2:04:05] everything what is to be
[2:04:08] perfect is to have need of
[2:04:11] nothing to be
[2:04:14] complete that's what it is to be
[2:04:17] perfect the Son and Daughter of
[2:04:19] god is perfect
[2:04:23] because God is in
[2:04:25] them please
[2:04:33] stand like always we never get to finish
[2:04:36] the messages that we
[2:04:38] prepared we go over here we go over
[2:04:43] there but God I'm
[2:04:47] sure that God is speaking to your
[2:04:50] heart our
[2:04:52] objective is that you like
[2:04:57] me that we may be able to find that
[2:05:02] button that we may touch
[2:05:05] it and this dirty
[2:05:08] body
[2:05:12] corrupted may turn into a uncorruptible
[2:05:15] [Music]
[2:05:18] body I'm not waiting on anyone
[2:05:23] the only one I'm waiting on is in
[2:05:29] me how
[2:05:32] important when
[2:05:34] you when you're sure you're you're
[2:05:39] mature that there's a God that
[2:05:42] exists then you start to do
[2:05:46] this can you come
[2:05:50] here
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:06:00] let's say I'm very
[2:06:04] mature and brother Bram used this phrase
[2:06:07] very
[2:06:08] often come up here come up here don't be
[2:06:12] a
[2:06:13] participant isn't that
[2:06:15] right he who knows the message is going

[2:06:28] time like I said one my my job isn't to

[2:06:37] know that we're in time of the
[2:06:40] scene and we're
[2:06:43] actors not just to

[2:07:35] message look at me a
[2:07:38] [Music]

[2:07:45] [Music]
[2:07:47] old help me help me
[2:07:52] it's it's
[2:07:54] mutual let's do it by
[2:07:56] [Music]
[2:07:58] works one time I commented to brother
[2:08:00] Alex Bruna Jr I said
[2:08:04] brother our children limit
[2:08:07] us and he stayed looking at me I don't
[2:08:11] know if he's here but it's the truth but
[2:08:13] I was speaking about myself when I
[2:08:18] realized that my children need to be
[2:08:20] born again
[2:08:22] forgive the
[2:08:25] expression what business do I got being
[2:08:27] over there
[2:08:32] preaching street light outside Darkness
[2:08:34] at
[2:08:35] home and my children are
[2:08:38] losing I believe they're children of
[2:08:42] God I have to be with
[2:08:45] them I to pray with
[2:08:50] them I know everything has its
[2:08:55] place Moses that's why the things happen
[2:08:57] in the Bible Moses was
[2:09:04] ready he was ready to go take the people
[2:09:06] out of Egypt
[2:09:09] ready he was
[2:09:14] ready and the angel of the Lord appeared
[2:09:17] to kill
[2:09:18] him what he was going to do over there
[2:09:22] he hadn't done it in his
[2:09:25] home because the most
[2:09:27] important it was the
[2:09:31] circumcision and there he wanted to go
[2:09:33] to show
[2:09:35] off when he had
[2:09:37] forgot to circumcise his
[2:09:41] son how many of us are in that same
[2:09:45] situation that our children haven't been
[2:09:49] circumcised the minister is not going to
[2:09:51] do
[2:09:52] it's your
[2:09:54] responsibility like a mother and a
[2:09:57] father it's my
[2:10:00] responsibility and there came a good
[2:10:02] woman
[2:10:05] zi and all the
[2:10:07] message brother
[2:10:09] Bram when he speaks of
[2:10:12] zippa he always speaks good of
[2:10:16] her oh I wish we had a
[2:10:19] zippa zippa is a woman
[2:10:22] type of the
[2:10:25] church and sometimes the church has to
[2:10:27] stand in front of the
[2:10:30] minister and tell them what's up with
[2:10:33] you you know what I'm talking
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:40] about you know what I'm talking
[2:10:45] about and why you speak brother
[2:10:49] Sergio because there's inside of my
[2:10:53] heart and if I don't speak what's in my
[2:10:55] heart I'm a
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:10:59] hypocrite I'm speaking secondhand
[2:11:03] religion and he wants
[2:11:06] Originals right now we're in the
[2:11:08] time of the person
[2:11:11] personifications I know I went over my
[2:11:14] time is one of the few
[2:11:17] times but I can't hold this back this
[2:11:20] brother
[2:11:23] he said that before
[2:11:24] converting he used to be a gang part of
[2:11:26] a g be part of a
[2:11:28] gang and they were called the
[2:11:31] pitos and if one of them walked like
[2:11:34] that the other one also walked like
[2:11:37] that if one of them walked like
[2:11:40] this the other one also walk brother
[2:11:43] bham
[2:11:46] say the majority of the
[2:11:49] people they don't get full of the the
[2:11:51] Holy
[2:11:53] Ghost because first off they don't know
[2:11:55] where it
[2:11:57] is they get full of the spirit full of
[2:12:00] the
[2:12:01] pastor and I know what I'm talking
[2:12:07] about well because I'll say because is
[2:12:10] my brother he loves
[2:12:13] me and he knows I'll never say something
[2:12:16] to but I'm going to say do it like
[2:12:20] him
[2:12:22] let's say that the church no I'm not
[2:12:23] saying it
[2:12:25] happens that they see him how he
[2:12:27] walks how he moves the
[2:12:30] head then everybody wants to do the
[2:12:34] same they all want to be little
[2:12:37] [Music]
[2:12:40] scavis I'm not scared to say what I'm
[2:12:42] going to say because I know who I am and
[2:12:46] I know that he knows
[2:12:49] me but we're under the ministry of
[2:12:51] brother
[2:12:53] Bernie and we all want to be little
[2:12:56] Beres did you know that he hates
[2:13:03] that but now I don't want to use others
[2:13:05] but if they don't get
[2:13:09] offended Tommy but if you loved how
[2:13:11] brother Tommy Paris
[2:13:13] was another little
[2:13:15] Tommy and I know
[2:13:17] them even how they move their hand how
[2:13:20] they walk
[2:13:23] how they pretend that
[2:13:24] GI one thing is to
[2:13:27] pretend and another thing is to have
[2:13:29] [Applause]
[2:13:30] it and if you don't know what you
[2:13:33] have find your
[2:13:37] [Music]
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:41] place they all want to be if you hear
[2:13:45] brother huh Pablo Rees Franco Pablo Rees
[2:13:49] Franco not that he does it
