[29:00] but you know what some people
[29:04] that i know that i've met because you
[29:07] know we have the time machine
[29:08] yeah so i've had the opportunity to meet
[29:11] these people
[29:12] who gave their life no matter who made
[29:14] fun of them
[29:15] even if their little brothers made fun
[29:17] of them even if the people at the school
[29:19] made fun of them
[29:20] if everybody made fun of them they knew
[29:23] that jesus was in their heart
[29:25] and it was more important for them to
[29:27] get to heaven
[29:28] than to feel comfortable or good here on
[29:31] earth
[29:32] because they had an experience really
[29:35] really
[29:36] would you like to know yeah so there's
[29:38] this book it's called fox's book of
[29:40] martyrs
[29:41] brother branham this is one of the books
[29:43] that he told
[29:44] his congregation to read he said every
[29:47] christian should read fox's book of
[29:49] martyrs
[29:50] because it's encouraging how encouraging
[29:53] because i heard you praying right now
[29:55] and so there's something in you that
[29:57] wants to be a warrior and you want to
[29:59] fight and punch and
[30:00] and protect yourself but you know what
[30:02] god wants to fight your battles
[30:05] question how are you going to meet some
[30:07] people with a book
[30:09] good question see i reprogrammed and
[30:13] added an algorithm to the book there was
[30:15] just a couple of repetiti
[30:17] it will transport the people here you
[30:19] don't believe
[30:21] are you ready to see yeah maestro lights
[30:24] porfa please
[30:25] porfa please here we go
[30:29] and the first martyr
[30:33] his name was stephen are you ready to
[30:36] meet these people
[30:37] let's go let's go
[30:52] my name is stephen and it all started
[30:56] on the day of pentecost where we prayed
[30:59] and we waited and we were able to
[31:01] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[31:04] but we didn't want to just stay there we
[31:06] decided to go out and preach the gospel
[31:08] to every man and creature and let them
[31:10] know
[31:11] of this great and almighty gift and as
[31:14] people began to receive
[31:15] they decided to be baptized in the name
[31:18] of the lord jesus christ
[31:19] one after another and after another
[31:22] receiving the power
[31:24] of the almighty god in the form of the
[31:25] holy ghost
[31:27] but as the pharisees saw this they
[31:28] didn't like it too much so as i began to
[31:31] run with the gospel
[31:32] i was tied up and put to trial because i
[31:35] was called a blasphemer
[31:37] believing that the son of man was the
[31:40] very son of the almighty god
[31:43] and as he pulled me to trial and threw
[31:44] me out on the street each of them
[31:46] started picking up stones
[31:48] stones of persecution and began to cast
[31:51] them upon me
[31:52] telling me to renounce my belief and my
[31:54] faith in the son of man
[31:57] and as it began to take my last breath
[31:58] of life i look up to my right hand side
[32:01] and i was able to see the almighty god
[32:04] and the son of man standing at his right
[32:07] hand side
[32:08] and i knew that my redeemer liveth and i
[32:11] asked the lord jesus christ
[32:13] forgive them lord for they know not what
[32:15] they do
[32:16] as i took my last breath of life i'm
[32:18] here today to tell you
[32:20] that if you stand for the lord jesus
[32:21] christ today he will stand for you
[32:24] in that great day
[32:29] [Applause]
[32:33] [Music]
[32:41] spaced he was so brave he let them stone
[32:43] him
[32:44] see how does that make you feel
[32:46] sometimes
[32:47] i get my feelings hurt when people say
[32:49] mean things but the real christian
[32:51] filled with the holy ghost
[32:53] he can even take rocks being thrown at
[32:55] him
[32:57] here let me introduce you to my next
[33:00] friend
[33:00] his name was ignacios
[33:06] [Music]
[33:08] ignacios
[33:09] [Music]
[33:11] but he was definitely not the last
[33:14] i am ignatius just like stephen i
[33:18] received the holy ghost as a child
[33:20] some say i was a child in matthew 19. it
[33:24] wasn't difficult for my persecutors to
[33:26] see that i was a man of god
[33:28] but that didn't stop me i was
[33:33] i was tortured
[33:34] [Music]
[33:36] thrown in jail and even thrown into the
[33:39] wild beast
[33:40] the lions as i was fed to the lions
[33:45] i said my last words i am wheat
[33:49] of god and i be grounded by the teeth of
[33:52] these wild beasts
[33:53] that i may be found pure bread of god
[34:06] persecuted and beat but did you notice
[34:08] his attitude
[34:10] yes his attitude he said let them grind
[34:13] me
[34:13] because when you make bread you have to
[34:15] take the wheat
[34:16] and you grind it and even though it's
[34:18] painful for the wheat
[34:20] it becomes bread and you can feed
[34:23] people and be a blessing sometimes
[34:26] the lord is going to grind us and mold
[34:29] our little character
[34:31] but you know i want you to know
[34:33] character
[34:34] you know kindness and love and being
[34:36] friendly
[34:37] all those things you can't be born with
[34:40] them you have to learn
[34:40] them the prophet teaches us the
[34:43] character
[34:44] is not a gift it's a victory
[34:48] so you little soldier with the full
[34:50] armor of god
[34:51] keep pressing on if someone says
[34:53] something mean
[34:54] you just pray for them
[34:56] [Music]
[34:58] do you hear that yes let's meet our next
[35:00] friend are you ready yeah what
[35:02] what what's her what's his name the next
[35:04] friend his name
[35:06] is called polycarp
[35:09] come on escape
[35:13] imagine what it was like for an 86 year
[35:15] old man
[35:16] to have to choose between god and just
[35:19] being burned alive before a crowd
[35:22] well my name is polycarp and i was a
[35:25] disciple
[35:26] of the apostle john after receiving the
[35:29] holy ghost
[35:30] i became bishop and endured persecution
[35:32] with many christians in my day
[35:34] just for refusing to worship other gods
[35:36] and the roman emperor
[35:38] they broke into my home as if i was a
[35:41] savage prisoner
[35:43] but they were soon surprised when i
[35:44] welcomed them in as if they were my
[35:46] friends
[35:47] i said please friend sit down there is
[35:50] only love here
[35:51] eat with me i will freely go with you
[35:54] but i make
[35:55] one request that you gave me an hour to
[35:58] pray
[35:59] and i prayed for two hours as i entered
[36:03] into that heavenly realm
[36:05] with the angels so
[36:08] i was brought into this arena and the
[36:11] pro council pled with me
[36:13] curse christ and i will release you
[36:16] but i replied 86 years i have served him
[36:20] he had never done me wrong how can i
[36:23] blaspheme my king who has saved me
[36:26] surprisingly the proconsul offered to
[36:29] spare my life saying
[36:31] do this old man just swear by the spirit
[36:33] of the emperor
[36:34] and that will be sufficient but i stood
[36:37] firm
[36:38] and the proconsul threatened me with the
[36:40] wild beast
[36:41] and i told him to bring them forth now
[36:44] his patience was gone
[36:46] and he told me that i would be burned
[36:48] alive
[36:50] but i declared you threatened fire that
[36:52] burned for an hour
[36:54] and is over but the judgment on the
[36:55] ungodly is forever
[36:58] so the fire was prepared as i lifted my
[37:01] eyes to heaven and prayed
[37:03] father i bless you that you have deemed
[37:05] me worthy of this day and hour
[37:08] that i might take a portion of the
[37:09] martyrs in the cup of christ
[37:12] among these may i today be welcomed
[37:14] before thy face as a rich
[37:16] and acceptable sacrifice father
[37:19] and as that fire tried to engulf my body
[37:22] i noticed
[37:23] i wasn't being consumed the fire formed
[37:25] an ark around me and
[37:27] and it would not touch me my persecutors
[37:30] were so confused they didn't know what
[37:32] to do
[37:33] but instead of repenting and accepting
[37:35] the one true god who kept me from that
[37:37] flame
[37:38] the soldier took a dagger and stabbed me
[37:41] to death
[37:42] and as my blood put out the fire i took
[37:46] my last breath
[37:47] and was finally united with my lord
[37:55] my favorite part was that the fire
[37:58] formed an ark around here the fire
[38:00] didn't touch him
[38:02] sadly the soldiers didn't use their
[38:04] heads and be baptized in the name of the
[38:06] holy ghost they decided to stab him
[38:09] i think if i would have seen that i
[38:10] would have repented and worshiped that
[38:12] god too
[38:13] wouldn't you yeah i would i would
[38:15] probably worship you i don't know
[38:18] no you have to worship the lord i know
[38:21] but
[38:22] it's just crazy right but if i was i
[38:24] probably would have wanted to worship
[38:26] polycarp too
[38:27] i would have thought he's some god or
[38:28] some scenes the fire won't even touch
[38:31] but remember son it's never the man
[38:34] it's never the man that we look at we
[38:37] follow
[38:38] because there's god in that man
[38:41] she's the children of israel they
[38:43] followed moses but moses
[38:45] followed the pillar of fire yeah oh
[38:48] it's so exciting what's another one so
[38:51] the next one
[38:53] her name is margaret yes it's a girl
[38:57] even girls can stand up for the lord yes
[39:00] wasn't she in 1862 i don't remember what
[39:04] year she was but let's find out okay
[39:06] come on i know
[39:10] as you can tell persecution is the state
[39:14] of being harassed bullied and even
[39:16] killed
[39:17] due to political and in my case
[39:20] religious
[39:21] beliefs i am 18 year old margaret wilson
[39:25] and my story takes place in a dreadful
[39:28] time
[39:29] where a wicked king forced his people to
[39:31] pledge allegiance
[39:32] to him his storts and his church
[39:37] out of fear most men complied afraid of
[39:40] being persecuted
[39:42] my life forever changed when i met
[39:44] sister margaret mclachlan
[39:46] who introduced me to the one true king
[39:50] i can never describe the joy i felt when
[39:53] not only me
[39:54] but my younger sister and brother also
[39:56] accepted the lord jesus christ
[39:59] when i received the holy ghost i did not
[40:01] care who or what would persecute me
[40:05] i know this life is temporary and i'm
[40:07] gonna live it serving the lord
[40:10] my father was a prosperous farmer
[40:13] and out of fear of the king he complied
[40:15] to the law and worshiped how
[40:17] the king demanded how miserable it must
[40:20] be to never
[40:21] truly be free my siblings and i would
[40:25] hide away at sister margaret's home to
[40:27] worship the one true god
[40:29] the officials at my father's church
[40:31] began to notice
[40:33] him attending sunday service without his
[40:35] children
[40:36] and they used fear intimidation
[40:39] and threats to scare us my brother ran
[40:42] away to the mountains
[40:43] while my sister and i gladly pressed on
[40:46] with sister margaret because
[40:47] every single time we were together we
[40:50] felt the presence of the lord
[40:53] we were then betrayed by neighbors
[40:55] arrested
[40:56] and then imprisoned in april
[41:00] we were held in trial and the court
[41:02] demanded we swear oath to the king
[41:05] how can i swear oath to a tyrant who
[41:07] served empty gods
[41:09] desperate my father raised enough money
[41:11] to buy the freedom of my youngest sister
[41:15] sister margaret and i were condemned to
[41:17] be drowned at sea
[41:19] tied to a stake on may 11th they took me
[41:22] and sister margaret to the ocean to meet
[41:25] our fates
[41:26] they position positioned her farthest in
[41:29] the ocean so i could see her drown
[41:32] as it broke my heart seeing my beloved
[41:34] sister in christ's lung
[41:36] fill with water i knew the fear they
[41:39] tried to
[41:39] instill in me couldn't compare to the
[41:41] joy that was coming
[41:44] she passed away i was there awaiting my
[41:47] watery death
[41:49] and the sea rose covering my face and
[41:52] when i was about to enter into heaven
[41:54] a guard pulled me out giving me one last
[41:56] chance
[41:57] to swear oath to the king they do not
[42:01] understand that
[42:02] death will bring me closer to christ at
[42:05] 18 years old i
[42:06] understood this i then turned to the
[42:10] guard
[42:11] and i told him may god
[42:14] save the king if he will
[42:18] i died singing of how good my god was
[42:20] despite
[42:21] my trials despite my problems despite my
[42:24] current situation
[42:26] and despite my persecution
[42:31] [Music]
[42:49] what did you notice i noticed that every
[42:52] martyr was talking about
[42:53] being baptized and receiving the holy
[42:56] ghost
[42:56] that's right that's where we get the
[42:59] courage
[43:00] that's where we can get the courage to
[43:02] stand in the face of people laughing
[43:04] speeding hitting and making fun of you
[43:07] the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:09] changes lives son it'll change
[43:12] your life would you like that
[43:15] yes let's let's go to one more okay one
[43:18] more one more this one is called oh
[43:22] let's go a little more recent
[43:24] [Music]
[43:34] he's a filipino friend oh filipino come
[43:37] on let's go see
[43:43] stefan ignatius polycarp the margarets
[43:47] they all have one thing in common we all
[43:50] had a genuine experience with our god
[43:52] almighty
[43:52] and encounter that forever left a mark a
[43:55] conviction
[43:56] we knew who we were my god gave me a new
[43:59] heart to love
[44:00] he gave me new strength to overcome and
[44:02] to overcome all the sadness all the pain
[44:04] my god broke the chains of bondage
[44:08] he gave me the new birth
[44:11] he made me free my name is clarito de la
[44:15] cruz
[44:16] and i am one of the many martyrs who
[44:18] stood for the word of god
[44:20] i have a wife her name is lauedel
[44:24] and she is pregnant i also have a son
[44:28] three years of age wherever wherever i
[44:31] went
[44:32] i always always always preach the gospel
[44:35] i share the goodness of christ to his
[44:37] people but on july 26 2011
[44:40] a beautiful muslim couple pretending to
[44:42] be husband and wife
[44:44] they hired me they wanted me to drive
[44:46] them to a village near
[44:48] the town of now we drove
[44:51] and we drove for miles and miles
[44:54] and miles seemed like the road was just
[44:57] getting longer
[45:00] and as soon as we arrived the most
[45:02] unexpected thing happened
[45:04] they revealed themselves as muslim
[45:05] extremists and they attacked me
[45:08] they beat me and they hit me and they
[45:09] tied my they had tied my hands with
[45:11] wires
[45:13] their demand it was that i converted to
[45:15] islam
[45:17] and i was given chance after chance
[45:19] after chance
[45:20] to renounce my faith and no matter how
[45:23] bad they hurt me
[45:24] how bad they caught me or caused me pain
[45:26] i stood strong for my god
[45:30] and i was given one final chance with a
[45:32] gun pointed at my head
[45:34] so i denied them one last time saying
[45:37] pull the trigger
[45:38] i know where i'm going when i die do you
[45:40] know where you're going
[45:48] [Music]
[45:51] that they were so brave they let
[45:54] everybody kill them
[45:57] that's i want that i want that you want
[45:59] that
[46:00] i don't you want that courage that
[46:02] courage
[46:03] oh when we have that see not everyone
[46:06] has to suffer like them
[46:08] see our persecution here looks a little
[46:10] different because god has been so
[46:12] merciful
[46:13] see the ones that attack us is our anger
[46:16] our jealousy our fear depression
[46:20] our anxiety all those things are
[46:23] frustration
[46:25] see our disobedience those are all the
[46:28] things that keep us from being
[46:30] the boy and girl that jesus wants us to
[46:32] be
[46:35] those are the people those are the real
[46:37] enemy
[46:38] see but we can overcome them
[46:42] we can overcome them but the only thing
[46:46] that can overcome the real enemy is love
[46:49] son
[46:51] would you like the love of god because
[46:54] did you know the love of god has
[46:56] a name is the name the love of god
[46:59] no no no the love of god has a name the
[47:02] holy spirit
[47:03] has a name freedom has a name
[47:07] victory has a name love
[47:10] has a name and that name is jesus christ
[47:14] now we can pray if you would like the
[47:17] holy ghost
[47:18] of course see the bible gives us a
[47:20] recipe or how to receive the holy ghost
[47:24] and that's in acts 2 38
[47:27] see the apostle peter was preaching when
[47:31] the holy ghost came
[47:32] down they were sitting in the room and
[47:35] where they were sitting the holy ghost
[47:37] filled up
[47:37] the entire room and everybody had fire
[47:41] burning in them and they were speaking
[47:42] in different languages and tongues
[47:45] and then somebody jumped up and said men
[47:48] how can we
[47:49] get what you have and peter said repent
[47:52] oh he was anointed with the holy ghost
[47:54] and he said repent
[47:56] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[47:58] jesus christ
[47:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[48:01] holy ghost
[48:03] see they didn't have to be standing they
[48:06] didn't have to do cartwheels and jump
[48:07] and shouted
[48:08] the bible says they were sitting you can
[48:11] sit down and receive the holy ghost
[48:13] right where you are
[48:15] and then once you receive the holy ghost
[48:16] then it's gonna put a fire on you to
[48:18] jump
[48:18] up and shout and do something for the
[48:21] lord
[48:22] so would you like that yes
[48:25] would you like that yes then pray with
[48:28] me myself can you close your eyes
[48:31] it's so simple all you have to do son
[48:36] when i said repent i want you to know
[48:39] repent isn't some fancy thing
[48:42] all it means is just feel bad for what
[48:44] you did
[48:46] it doesn't even mean ask for forgiveness
[48:48] if you look
[48:49] into the dictionary the definition says
[48:52] a
[48:53] deep remorse something a deep
[48:56] feeling to make you never want to do it
[48:58] again
[49:00] okay and then when you have the holy
[49:02] ghost the lord will put on your heart to
[49:04] go make right with people and ask for
[49:05] forgiveness
[49:06] but the first step is to feel bad for
[49:09] the things you did
[49:11] now you don't want to talk back to mommy
[49:14] do you
[49:16] you don't want to punch your brother in
[49:17] the nose do you
[49:20] you don't want to rip up your science
[49:22] project and your homework and tell your
[49:23] teacher that
[49:24] the dog ate it even though you don't
[49:26] have a dog
[49:27] do you so do you feel bad for those
[49:31] things
[49:32] yes do you feel bad for being
[49:34] embarrassed of the lord
[49:36] sometimes we don't want to pray at
[49:37] school yes so then all you have to do
[49:41] is say lord i repent of those things
[49:43] lord i replent of those things
[49:45] i don't want to do that again i don't
[49:47] want to do that again i'll turn away
[49:49] from that i'll turn away from that
[49:51] oh hallelujah and then the apostle said
[49:54] be baptized in his name
[49:56] so all you have to do is confess it with
[49:58] your lips
[49:59] believe it in your heart and say it loud
[50:03] so that everybody can hear you so you
[50:05] can show you're not ashamed now when you
[50:07] confess like that
[50:08] the lord will come and fill you with the
[50:10] holy ghost
[50:12] you go ahead go ahead sir lord i am
[50:16] sorry for all that they've done
[50:19] i'm sorry
