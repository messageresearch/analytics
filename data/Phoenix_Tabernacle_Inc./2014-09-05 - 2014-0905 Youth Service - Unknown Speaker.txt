the word are you ready to hear the word you're in the spirit because that's where we should be in the spirit you ready to hear the word says we must be in the right mental attitude you might be here right now but where's your mind at where's your spirit at you think thinking about the TV show you still at the movie movie theater you must be right here you may open your scripture in the Book of Judges in the sixth chapter in the seventh verse the bad thing here about Arizona brother Bill my mouth is always dry over there in Texas very humid so we get used to it judges the 6th chapter verse 7 and if you can bow your heads today tonight you want to make a short prayer de Heavenly Father Lord we love you so much for everything that you've given us and everything that you have taken away from us Lord we love you so much and that's the reason why we're here today that's the reason why we're here listening to the word because we're hungry for you we want to have fellowship with you I really don't come to see my brother in the way I do but I want to see you and all that matters is that you just descend tonight and might have another experience with you give us an oldfashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost Liberate the minds and they're captured by the enemy may they be delivered and any anything or any that they're asking for that your children are looking or asking you may granted as your word is being spoken faith comes by he hearing the word of God thank you Lord help me and help my interpreter and bless the reading of your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen it reads like this and it came to pass when the children of Israel cried on to the Lord because of the meites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus say the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from the from before you and gave them their their land oh and I said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was an ala and pertain onto Josh the appi as right and his son Gideon trashed Wheat by the trashed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the mandes and the angel of the Lord appeared onto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou might th Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all all this befallen us and where be all these Miracles which our father told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us unto the hands of the maites and the Lord looked upon him and said go on this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the manad ites have not sent thee I bless the one of his word you may be seated if I can put a text to my message tonight I like to like brother brand entitles this if God be with us then where is all the Miracles I think that's a tremendous question that every person has every single one of us has questions so many questions and as a youth how many questions is is is in the mind but brother Bram says when there's a question there's an answer when there's a Biblical question in the scriptures there must be the answer in the scriptures don't look anywhere else look to the word we have so many questions if God be with us then where is all the Miracles we read the scripture here in judges a Mighty Man by the name of Gideon and he he was he was oppressed that's what brother Bram says the devil likes to oppress you and that's what happened brother Bram says Israel got away from the word they they they got away from God and the spirit left them and so what happened with this little what this man did he worked in the fields he work in the field so what he so what that's what he that that was his job and that was his food he will he will he will he will put plant the seed and he would get his Harvest but the problem was that the amorites and all these different nation was will come and take all of his Harvest imagine that you were all year you're throwing the water and you work so hard and here comes here comes the here comes the enemy and he takes everything how many of you work that's good you need to pay your cell phone bills but imagine you you work you work for for the ones for the ones who work you better you understand me a lot better you work all week so hard I'm tired and finally here comes Friday it's time for payday and you come and pick up your paycheck and they say no they already took it for you imagine how that feels they already took my paycheck you you work for that money you work for it and somebody else takes it it's time for us to do something brother brand says the devil can't set a foot on you and hurt you until you get away from God my goodness brother brandom says check your life check your faith and remember that the devil cannot harm you unless you're in Christ brother I'm reading from the quote a messages brother brandom that God be with us his miracles and then that angel appeared onto Gideon cuz he he he came a little thought to him he said you know what you know what Dad this what we're going to do this is what we're going to do I'm I'm I'm starting to see the schedule of these this enemies every single year they come and take it we're going to we going to we're going to we're going to reap and S before time before SE before they come so we can have our food and then the angel of the Lord descended he said the Lord is with you the Mighty Man of Valor tremendous the the angel of the Lord descended you're tremendous a mighty man of Valor that you thought to PL at before time before the enemy came wow you're tremendous and he says God is with thee he said oh no no no this what do you mean God with me and why have we bef Fallen where are where are those stories that I hear that my mom us to tell me that they were a Prophet by the name of Moses and he took out my ancestors and he opened the Red Sea what happened to those stories if God is with me where are those stories brother brandom says the prophet Divine interpreter of the word of God and brothers and sisters brother Bram says look what you are right now look how you are right now in the condition and that's what you would have been back then brother brand said many people say if there were 13 if it was in the time of Jesus there would have been 13 disciples and there was in the time of Noah there would have been nine in the ark but what are you doing right now what are you right now think about it you backstab your brother you talk bad about your brother and that's what you would have been back then and the attitude in the position that you are right now would have been back a prophet brother Bram always SP with the biblical patterns he did not leave Jesus Christ in the grave he did not leave them in the pages of the Bible he always brought it present tense right here present where the shoe fits brother Brown says when I think about Samson I think about the church he always brings it present and that's what a prophet does was thinking about the past oh I heard about Egypt and Moses and Elijah and the Miracles and he said what about right now the Lord is with you Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he does not stay in the past present when he told Moses Moes said what should I tell them who sent me said not that I was not that I might be not that I probably will be he said that I am present right now brothers and sisters we always think about the past we always think of the future what about right now Brothers if God is with us and where are his miracles he says isn't that a good picture of the church today but brother it's time for Action I like how brother BR preaches I like how he preaches and he says that's that's the same now now you see he brings a present the time has come for Action the time has come that we need to stop playing [Applause] church it's time for that to come to a halt there's no more playing church we must get down to business and I trust the same God will plac that upon this upon our hearts tonight to have to put a halt and playing Church playing religious playing righteous and now it's time for action oh Brothers I feel good you feel good you feel good can I take this off is it all right all right Bros I'm from Texas I'm sorry sorry you're can wear it it's very hot out here but when we makes it hot is that the presence of the Lord in this place all right and he says now we find that when God's people gets in trouble he sends a prophet with the word he sends the prophet oh but then he said a prophet at this time now let's see this Gideon the angel lord said all right come on stay present he said I sent you to go deliver them I'm a poor man I'm nothing that's what God likes to use those nobodies those people that are stutters that look ugly that people forsake that's the people that God wants to use and he wants to use you and no one loves me I don't do anything brothers and sisters that's a lie of the devil all right you feel good brother brand says he says you poor deliberate backsliding plucked by The Roots how are you going to see a miracle until you become one brother random says I'm GNA cover the microphone says Glory a miracle of God's grace to take an unbelieving doubter and fill him with the Holy Ghost Bram says look yourself in the mirror and you you will see a miracle thank you Lord oh Brothers no one loves me everybody hates me brothers and sisters how many youth are committing suicide right now how many are in a spirit have the spirit of depression I'm hitting the I'm hitting the nail how many are battling with that right now don't raise your hand many of you have want to commit suicide brother BR says look yourself in the mirror look yourself in the mirror and you will seal a miracle you want the Holy Ghost all you need to do is to forget about everything you need to die and you need to rot like an old potato brother Bram says as having nothing but possessing thank you Amen brother brand like to speak about that old colored woman you know how that shite woman in the second Kings you know her baby died and I think she I think he hit his head and now the prophet at the time was [Music] elishah and this woman said I'm going to go and find him he went to Mont carel and I believe his husband said what are you going there for what you theart for it's not the new moon it's not Sabbath it's not a holid why you going he said don't worry about it he went over there and Elijah said how is everything how's your husband how are you how your child how is your child remembered her child died her child died and how many of you parents would have been in that attitude oh my God oh my God oh my God and she said everything is well she went to the prophet said how is everything how's your husband how's your child how are you all is well brother brandham said that even though her child was dead that she could see her child running around doing mischievous things even though he was physically dead that attitude that was in all is well what would you do if the angel Lord ascended what would you say everything's a mess everything's a chaos there's no problems and how many of you would say all is well how many can say that look what's going on in your home right now look what's happening in your life right now look at everything and how many you can say all is well brother brandham I remember brother brandom never put the brother brandham always brings a present tense he doesn't leave them in he doesn't leave them in the scriptures he brought it present tense brother brandham said he was flying over Arkansas the Natural State and brother brandham say suddenly the plane had to stop he said brother what's going on what's wrong with the plane and he said we sorry sir we just got to to lay the plane for a while flight stop in Arkansas that's what was going on and the Holy Spirit ascended and he told Brother Bram get out of the airport Walk This Way walk amen Street turn on hway Hallelujah Avenue and turn on Hebrews 138 and take another left on on John 36 brother Bram said he said where you taking me he said he was singing to the Lord he said oh if they call me a holy Ro R ER oh and if they call me a Holy Roller say were you taking me Lord and it kept on going the spirit of the Lord was leading him and then suddenly he was walking and there was a color woman sitting right there leaning on the gate with tears running down her cheeks and said you're person person and he said you talking to me he said yeah you he how do you know I was a person I don't know he said I don't know he said you've heard about my meetings I don't know but I was praying to the Lord that he may send me a send me someone and he told me that he was going to send you brother R said oh this this woman is a woman of virtue and he said I have I have I have a dying kid you know that that's just that little that little little lady the child that was dying I was that type of woman I asked for the Lord to give me a baby and I was going to give her to the Lord but he he he he done something wrong but Brandon said this he was hanging with wrong company brothers and sisters I'm not standing behind the pulpit and I'm saying stuff that I have not lived you must get out of the back company of bad friends that's the reason what that colored boy was unconscience and almost dead and the doctors gave up on him and B Bram said the reason why he was like that he was hanging with bad friends if you don't believe me go and search the word so get out of that get out God wants separation he wants you to separate the less that there's of you the less of you the less there's the world in you the more there can be of God that's what Elijah told je hoset that's what Elijah told jeos make this Valley full of ditches the more you dig the more water you have the more you can get out of the world the more Holy Spirit you can have that's the answer to your question and brother brandham said right let's go and brother sister was crying and brother Bram said he went to a little small home and an a door mat it said God bless he opened the he opened the door he went inside he said a buy he said a little bible in the table I'm not sure if

cute you want have a picture of brother Billy there or brother you might have a picture of me that doesn't matter you can have the Virgin Mary there and the little crucifix brother say that doesn't
