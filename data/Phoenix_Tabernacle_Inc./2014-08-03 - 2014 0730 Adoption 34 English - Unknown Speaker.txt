TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Watchtower is the ordain that is what it's placed not by man but by my will I raise who I I please and I raise who I love I raise who pleases me I raise no one can can raise I order and I raise and that's how the Watchtower is that's how my word is that's how I say it or how the Lord says it I'm going to read to pray and read the word divine father this glorious morning here we are Lord with hearts in in our heads bow to the dust of the Earth for where our bodies made up from but deep within us you exist Lord and that is what entrust us for us to come before your throne of mercy and Grace and I beg you for that Redemptive Grace that you make yourself present through your word that be her our our help and Lord I give you thanks for this precious morning in this city father that's so amazing Phoenix Lord where this small remnant gathers itself so to be fed to not allow for something contrary to your word come out but the appropriate food into its Due Time Lord I beg you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ open up your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 12 verse 5 to 11 then I'm going to make this try to make a brief and that we hope that God helps us in Hebrews 12:5 reades like this and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as it Sons my son do not despite the Chast chastening of the Lord nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by him for whom the Lord loves he chastises discourages every son whom he receives if you and endure chastising God deals with you as with sons for what son is there whom the father does not chasten but if you are without chastening of which all have become partakers then you are illegitimate and not Sons furthermore we had human fathers who corrected us and we PID them respect shall we not much more readily being subjection to the father of the spirits and live you may be seated Brothers this morning I'm going to be speaking on the same subject that we've been taking on Sunday mornings but more more than anything I'm going to be oh I'll be dedicating this message to the mothers especially to the mothers that now have 60 years or more amongst them that I'm for sure it's sister L and and my mother and I don't know who else might have that age but I reading this scripture which we've been meditating for many days I was considering that on May 10th in Mexico it celebrated Mother's Day and here in the United States it's on the 14 or today present and possibly some people are not well documented on the thing that our Prophet that he spoke to us regarding it some time ago I uh translated a message from English to Spanish preached by our Prophet our brother a precious brother William brandham and he entitled it Mother's Day and I have it recorded there for the benefit to that one that doesn't know English but there's something that being in in a trip with a brother Domingos from Brazil that he accompanies me I was there in the evening in my room studying on the subject of adoption and something there that Drew my attention and it's which I want to refer to for the following 45 5 minutes or remain and that is that a mother in order for her to be a mother needs to have children when we study the interpretation of the scripture which speaks the the Apostle St Paul speaks to us speaking to Timothy speaking of how the woman shall be saved um giving birth to to to children and it comes as a teaching in a vulgar uh worldwide that a woman shall be saved in giving birth to to children but the the prophet gives us the interpretation and says Paul there is speaking to the woman that is already in the faith for he says she shall be saved if she remains in the faith and then if we go to the scripture we see there that when a woman is she single she has the time in order to dedicate her own life or her body to the Lord and possibly she the time goes on and then she falls in love of a young man and she marries him then they begin or or so many problems begin to Surge because the Bible cannot counter say itself because the Bible says that the young man is takes care of the things that are pertaining to the lore but the woman takes care of how she is to please her husband that's why Paul repeats there she will be saved if she remains in the faith because the women's labor comes twice because she not only has to take care of herself but she has to make the preparations for her husband when she arise from work when he arise from work sorry then God gives him one or two children and then as much more children come then the labor multiplies itself and it's much easier for a woman to complain just like job spoke to her wife after job going through a suffering that was very harsh and saying that the critics surrounded Jo and that every man began to speak as as they were fools and this inspired as well W the woman then job said woman you've spoken as any other W ignorant woman because when the pressure increases everything comes to home and then when the man goes to work and he comes very fatigued and says the prophet of the age there that's where that women waits for him at the door and receives him with with a hug and receives him with a kiss and she receives him very very well dressed and combed and if that man came and arrive from work tired she takes that fatigu this away and the woman has a great part and when he receives that problem at work then the man brings that problem at home but that woman's there daily with her kind tender hands that caresses that child that God gave to them and she takes care of of the baby and she loses sleep for him and even though she gives and feeds that baby that God gave through her body even that takes that that child and even though that the husband comes and it's tired when she but when she remains in the Fate she recognizes that the head has just arrived to the home and when the body recognizes where the head is they always give all the honor and the glory to that head and that's one of the reasons why people stumble because they don't give honor to where the honor belongs to and God says I honor those that honor me and they see find me those that seek me in morning that's the reason why in parenthesis the prophet said that people in this time that will be lazy don't take care we're in a time where people fall asleep and the prophet said I I'm a early riser oh when your baby cries they don't hold back she doesn't think on anything else she's ready to go and help her child and we know that and we know as children of the lord we should be thankful with our heavenly father and as while he's watching and taking care of us we see then that a mother in order to be a mother she needs to have or bear bear children and truly in itself it doesn't mean according to what the scripture tells us that a mother is a woman that that bears a child because in bearing a child it only brought a being to existence it's transformed or has become a procreator uniting itself to the word of God and then gives gives birth to that trial that came through the holy matron but that's not all it's only the beginning so then the the raising begins that's the reason why many men in the world presently they don't give honor to their MO natural mother but they honor that woman that created them if you notice Moses he was created by the daughter of pharaoh and the Bible says that he refused to be called a son of the daughter of pharaoh he could have been called because he was the woman that that raised them but then all the good needs are inherited by the good care and the prophet gives us a very small thing there he says when a a sheep begins there to wand off says that the pastor possibly might break that little leg that small leg of that small lamb but that way he can care for for for that little lamb and take him in his arms and place him in his shoulders in order to have en closer in order to speak and and make czes to it because that's what makes fall in love and that's what the word of God speaks to us because there's times that there's no not not that family contact and the family begins to wander aside because the father and the mother are not sufficiently wise to unite their family to have a personal contact talk with them instruct the child give them to eat give them um and let me tell you that it's what unites a family a a mother's not just a mother because she gives birth a father is not just a father because he he he bears but their fathers when they raise when they H blessed be the name of the Lord no wonder the prophet said that he doesn't allow for a man to be a deacon except he has been married because as a young man he does not know these things there's many young men that do not appreciate what they have because they are young but one day they will be father others and then they will be sadden or they shall regret the time that they rejected from their parents because now they are are are parents but the word of God teaches the instruction we we shouldn't have that mistake because we have the word of God and it should be wise and seeing that it's Mother's Day and we dedicate it to them I instead of speaking of of the mother I want to speak of the children and this is what I I was meditating uh being absent from home and I just wrote down some small scriptures taken as a Bays as adopted children so then the only way that we can be adopted the prophet says is for us to be faithful to God and the time come that he brings us so then he does a public ceremony and says this is my my my my child he pleases me and here is Paul was speaking to the Hebrews and he's speaking there to the children and and he says do not reject it's because we want to reach the Perfection and we want to get to be part of the Bride we want to be there in in the resurrection but we win everything except we don't want to uh suffer the chastisement the Bible says said do not dismay in other words do not lose the enthusiasm do not lose your strength because when the rebuke has come then he just wants to dismay but he says do not be discouraged when you are rebuked by him for whom the Lord loves he chastens and discourages now when I say it's three distinct words one from the other and that's where at times we as parents miss it the Bible says scourage chastan and Scourge in the third thing and we know what Scourge means when our children misbehave the only thing that we know is is to scorge and right away when they misbehave we take out the belt and we're good to to throw blows but before a a child Scorch he needs to be instructed and there's times that times kids now when they begin to grow you go and visit your relativ reles or your brothers and then you you're ashamed because that son that you you have he throws everything but that child's not ever going to know how to respect what's not his except he receives the instruction and when and when the child receives the instruction then what follows it's to is the rebuke but at times right away we jump to to to what it is to Scourge and we don't know other thing and and and as fiercly wild bees we we attack them but you need to be instructed into a church there's at times people do things that they shouldn't do the Bible says it's because lack of Doctrine lack of teaching that's why the prophet or the Apostle says that the olders should teach the youngest when they gather you know that our fellowship that that our fellowship should be completely around the word but at times they gather as the Elders of the almanacs the prophet says and those say you can't find them in the Bible possibly you might find them in Almanac of the mothers giving to understand that they gather not to have Fellowship on the things that the prophet teaches us but an elder woman should help out the youngest and the elder man or the mature man should instruct the young man blessed be the name of God allow me to tell you a small thing that the people should be impotent and a people should be Mighty it's the people which presently today is serving God under the message of the prophet and it's not impotent for the by emotion it's not impotent because his mind tells him to but through the instruction the bible say that there's no science the the people perishes and science comes through the doctrine and the instruction of the word amen blessed be the name of the Lord are you following me right it's a mother's day but then we see first of all the the rebuken this comes and the prophet doesn't miss it and I don't take the honor because the honor belongs to God and to the one that God used the prophet said when a man misses and the Bible says if you see your brother uh fell and he goes and help he save he saved the soul from sin and cover multitude of sins so the Bible says you should go and speak to that man if he doesn't listen then refuse to any other man before two or three so then the first opportunity T we have we we want to right away Scourge him and we should give the man 30 days for him to make it right if not give give him to the devil but see what we do in our homes we want to make in our church and the prophet says how to you you raise a child and he says the training of the child is at home but being that we are home we want to be just like the tumble weed you know how the tumble weed was the tumble weed was was that like like those those weeds that are here in Arizona when those those trees and and the field they wanted a king and they went to the Fig Tree and they told the Fig Tree you'll be our King he said no because I'm a fig and when people eat the Fig they they praise me and they praise God and then they went to and then they he said no I mean because when they drink wine they praise me and and they praise God and then they went to the tumble weed that weed or or that tumble weed that does not give no shade and they say we we want you to be our King and he said very well but I demand one thing that every tree come and make shade on my shade but Fire come from the tumble we and consumes them and that's how at times we are see brother forgive me but the reason why there's so many children that are bad or that are are fools it's because they have not received the the teaching and I don't know Spanish but you're going to help me but here we have the husband of our sister esta right that now she's no longer esta but notice he can help us says oh what a misbehaved child and truly saying foolish of me how I Mis raised him my son he's so badly raised and and she's just hitting her head because they want to be responsible for raising them the fathers see but we need to receive the instruction from the word when we instruct the child and if he doesn't listen so then we rebuke him oh when you tell your son oh seems son that you're doing pretty good always says thank you Daddy thank you Dad but you just tell him hey what's going on what I told you to do why didn't you do it oh the joy just left and you bringing out to the spiritual it seems that at times there's oh that Bright's leaving I'm going to go to heaven and there's days that I don't even want to raise my head and and it seems that it's just a tornado of goats and they're just ready to hit their heads and that's how we are and we see the son there he's just on the corner just very upset he doesn't even want to speak and why are you doing son they ask how you doing are you mad and yes because I rebuked them but see first of which repen according to the scripture then the chastisement comes and when people hear about chastisement they think right away of the the discouragement but it's it's differently than the other but forgive me Brothers we've been we we've created a generation a very ungrateful generation the reason why we've become accustomed to to that and I don't refer to everyone but I refer worldwide Daddy I Need a Dollar uh a dollar son here five Daddy I need a bike here son even though you take six months paying off that bike Daddy I need this and Daddy I need that and Dad gives him everything and as soon as he doesn't give what he wants then he gets upset and then there's some they write and they say Mr or Mrs or so and so I already have 15 years and my daddy still has not bought me a a a car he doesn't let me drive the car and there that old man goes to go buy him a car then right after he misbehaved so bad and then we say what happened but if we began to chastise a little you don't need to Scourge but if the son does not learn to obey of what's asked from his right and then the same way you bring it to the spiritual there's men that they don't even want to sweep the floor they don't even want to know now and they don't even want to do anything in the temple or for the work of God but they want to be the first to stand behind a Pulpit allow me to tell you that first of all you should re restrict the Privileges and and chastising so they can understand that we are a people we're a family in Christ Jesus our lord they try to try to do it with your son right and then you shouldn't have so badly raised kids and ungrateful kids and then the other day they're telling me well brother consider what you're saying but we the fathers are the ones that are responsible and he do he has not reached to my level and I don't think he will but look my brother first of all he needs to be rebuked and then chastised and there's many other ways to chastise a son I remember when I went to school and at times possibly I misbehaved a bit and the teacher there the professor would sit me in a corner there in a high chair and they will place me a hat there little hat and everyone will see me I remember that when my father at my father's church when a child was speaking there in the temple I was going out and in and out and in the deacons would get him and would bring them all the way to the Altar and will KNE them right there just for a bit and they all knew that that child misbehaved but the but the the the deacons didn't didn't just take him and Scorch him but they chastise him but the chastisement should begin a home of each family and a child should not learn discouragement but you should sit him there and there and you're not going to get up from there until I tell you to and if you do get up then the discouragement comes then you take out the bell and so he may know that you are want you are meaning to say what you're saying but many of the of the mothers say oh don't you move because I'm going to chastise you and then now in our people is oh well listen because I'm going to hate you because the children know when one wants to say one thing or not that's the reason why at times people when they see me since they get so frighten because allow me to tell you that I go with you wherever you want to you want to go up to the hill all the way on top and and laugh and do whatever you want to do Run and Jump I'll run and jump and I'll play with you but when it's about the word the sacr word when it's about the things of the Lord I have no father mother grandfather father or grandmother and that's the gold there's the Golden Rule which is the word of the Lord now there's mothers there needs to be children that's the reason why turn other way up it's it's a little more hotter here behind the pulp and that's that's why I wanted all the young people here I'm going to begin to read your sentence if your sentence has never been read to you I'm going to read it this morning that's what happened with man did you know the prophet speaks to us and say that there's three steps to to the new birth and which is justification right and so on and then even though God calls you even though you're in that clay and even though that my play is all the way up there and even there God extends his hand to that myy clay to take you out but then he demands from you sanctification and then the Holy Ghost which is the new birth right then really the third thing is the Holy Ghost and in order for you to be born the person needs to die and that's what happens with many of us then when they come to the message and they've never been given the sentence I'm gonna give you the sentence I'mma sentence you to death to the young man to the ladies and if there's a man there elder or that's not on the on the line they is well I apply to to you the sentence you want to hear it Brothers Deuteronomy 8:5 it's like the you should know in your heart that is a man chasten his son so the Lord your God chasten you that's the reason why many people don't want to follow the message and the first thing they tell me it's oh brother I don't believe that I'm from God because I go through this that the other you should praise God because God is chastising you how do you see that if the prophet says that if our child's there by the Freeway and there the cars are coming real quick and we tell our child oh child God bless you there where you're at no no no we don't love him very much right we have to shout to them and bring them back and instruct them and then rebuke him and tell them you don't do that because you're going to die and just like the man chastise his son so the Lord your God Chas you but you need to recognize this in your heart the only way that you accept the chastised man that you first of all recognize in your heart that God chasten man allow me to prove it real quick the young man goes that it's been instructed that's been instructed I remember here is my older brother and he's been the most obedient one than than most of us I told you that I was the most terrible one but at times a man would go by about 40 years 50 years and I had a cigarette in my hand and I can even just Puff The Smoke in his face but I would see that that hey here comes the chief I was even capable of swallowing the that cigarette even though I might burn my tongue because I recognized that that was my chief and that's how we should recognize in our hearts because if not we're not going to receive the rep the rebuken of our heavenly father he exorts us he rebukes us he instructs us and we reject the instruction and we laugh of the government of the pastor of the deacons and of the brothers and of our mother and of our father and not knowing that we are rejecting the word of God we need to recognize in our hearts that he is our father Revelation 3:19 don't you love God brother if you love him you have to love me it's like this I rebuke and chasten and as many as I love Oh Daddy it's because on Saturday evenings all the young people we accustomed to get together daddy and brother Garcia called the young men to get together but the father says son the whole week you misbehave you woke up at 11:00 in the morning screaming to your mom M to fix you up some tortillas and you she didn't make them the way you like them and you got mad you didn't clean the the backyard and you didn't wash the car and you didn't work during the week you didn't bring nothing to the house and you're so oh and I'm going to chastise you and I'm going to keep you at home oh but the pastor and right away they want to cover themselves with religion the prophet said that the religion is a covering we don't want religion we want the word of God one tells me brother Garcia you said this no sir I've never superseded a family you tell me one family that I've superseded a man and a wife never when have I superseded a couple or a man or a woman in the I know never I've preached the word and at home the parents are are the ones that are in charge but you know what happens nowadays forgive me the the young young people you're going to have to forgive me but I'm going to have to give you the sentence what happens is that in the world and of the world comes to the church the man there of the world comes out of comes out of school with his long hair he gets home just lays to sleep and gets up and says mom can you give me some dinner and then goes the whole evening and have some fun and it's not like later on that was the party in the weekend now the part is on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday and Sunday all everything's just a party in the world now you bring it to the church and you want a party and you want a party and whatever you want to call it Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday but when you come to church oh he's just falling asleep because he's so tired the prophet spoke again those these things can the young people say amen amen and the young ladies can say amen and you know the favorite word here in the United States they say my daddy and my mom are a bunch of Party Poopers interpreters it's because it's it's it's it's it's because my dad is so old it's because oh he's just so old and she's so we let go of brother berunda and he'll possibly He he'll he he'll beat four young four or five people hadot dance he might be old from the outside but he's Young from the inside and I told uh a beloved young man and I believe that he's example and I'm going to name him by by by name it's his brother Jimmy but I had to SC him Yer we arrived yesterday from from our trip right away to his room and he was right there laying on the floor just like he was dying I said no no brother Domingos we pray for him he got up in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there it is but I rebuked them and I said the prophet in the Bible who teaches us that we should take care of our bodies get up at 4: in the morning work the whole day until 3:00 in the morning and in the afternoon and then come to the temple without not having dinner and work here till 9:30 in the morning and in the evening day after day just other day there was a a party and I wanted brother muo to be here his brother muo here there was a party that party took me a step further to the gr It produced some gray hairs on me that the the young people were having a party and when I got to this party I saw certain spirits and certain individuals and I told Brother Maro and brother Maro said no brother it's not what you think no I say I don't miss it and I'm sure as I'm standing here that I don't miss it without nobody toing me anything I came to the church and Jimmy was here all the way until 11: in the night no nobody helping him out but everybody complaining like a child or a a child that's badly raised and I need to give you sentence to the to the youth no want take lightly your youth but be example to the faithful ones and I say it shouldn't be like that that's the reason why mother that's why you suffer you have daughters 15 16 17 years old and they still don't even know how to make tortillas they don't know how to make food and prepare food cuz that way the the the father would not get in trouble they do everything before I was going to get married and in my in-law's home very very nicely he he had clothing all around all around the house it was her clothes she learned how to eat meat in my home she was a servant he was a servant of God they were poor but when I got there called her daddy and oh so you love this young man let me see make him some some dinner make the T tortillas make the tortillas ready see first of all you teach then you rebuke you don't tell them make me tortillas make it this way and you don't tell them make it this way you don't know but you teach them sister Gloria when she got married prepare a tremendous dish to brother arando place the the the beans and they look so beautiful and they look so tasty but when brother Armando since he loved her so much he didn't say anything but our sons and daughters should be instructed right Brothers the Bible says in here our rebuke and chastise now if a young lady and you teach her and you teach her and you teach her and you teach her and then she doesn't want to learn invite me over to her house and then that she before me make the food and even though it might it might not be well cooked I'll still eat it but she still be rebuked and she'll then know that it's better to learn what she's alone but if she never if you never do it she's that woman's never going to be good for nothing Brothers we we are responsible to raise our children according to the word of the Lord oh people say oh now the children are not how they used to be forgive me the parents are not how they used to be they go into the church and I'll sit there next to my mom's side and I'll move just a bit like if I had some ants and then I would just turn quarter and I would turn a bit and then she'll give me half place and then if I I didn't listen she'll pinch me all the way 360° then I wouldn't move without crying without moving without getting excited and nobody would even find out only I because I was the one receiving the pinch but noway know we should learn that we need to rebuke and chastise and if the the son misbehaves when we get home hey I'm going to play some ball no sir you sit there and sit him down and you sit him there and then that poor child stays there later on he begins to just nod and then later on he falls asleep and thinks oh how bad my dad is but when he grows up he says blessed be my father and my mother but when know they themselves talk back to their dad and you left me you left me why didn't you corrected me I don't want no one to say that of me spiritual look Brothers tell me the the young the young people you answer amen yes or no the normal there is if there's a son needs to be a father right there had needs to be a mother there is that right amen you have a brother a mother brother Morales or Andrade you have a mother and a father you Brother David say I know you don't have a mother but you had a mother and know a father right and your sister you there's no way right so then the normal is that there needs to be a father and a mother right then then what are we doing what do we do with the young people and the young ladies that the ones that are in the back that don't they have here in Phoenix a father and a mother it's not normal they need to have a father a young man a young lady the the fat one there even brother foxy are the ones here that his father and and mother's not here he needs to have a man that needs to be his father here in Phoenix brother Samuel brother Danielle this lady here they shouldn't be and they themselves should be governing themselves there needs to be an order in the home and of the Lord because if not later on we're just going to have a bunch of young people here and a young of ladies over there just running and all night bringing up a wrong testimony and then you don't give him the message no sir that's not the message those are children and and and and girls that have not received the instruction of the word they want even do you even one more sentence can you say Amen Brothers then if I get out of the word Brothers I need to be corrected Proverbs 22:6 what time did I put the the the clock when I begin to speak 11 11:30 10:30 train out by child in the way he should go and when he's old he would not depart from it receive it instruct them so now I have in this congregation that are have been baptized and I want you to receive this instruction that you were not called to be just free instead of going to many parties you should remain there at home studying the message and praying to God you have so much time there just to to waste then come to my house I'll put you to pain and clean I'll put you to do a small job and and if you finish then we'll send you to the homes of those poor Elders there my mother I believe sister L she's blessed by her daughter because she has a daughter that's special Sister Sister Maria sister her name is Sister Maria and she doesn't claim to be of the message there's times that the Bible says we should have the elders all in in in high esteem and they're running so much around and why don't you clean the the backyard to of my mom and why don't you go and help clean the the the backyard over sister Florencia and sister anas if you have so much vitamins the Bible says of that Brothers says that you don't be curious from here and over there but everyone remain in their place the young man takes care of the things of the Lord and how to please the Lord why don't you write your name down for that but oh some fighting here and another one's just complaining jimy here over there the key and the key and the key but you stand here oh I want to die how do you want to die brother the word is the one that kills you it's the one that senten you instructs you it takes away all those filthy habits do you understand my Spanish I got an English over there it's being taped I want each one of you to hear this there's many young people that do not understand it Spanish very good but the the the tape is recorded over there and I want you to listen to this train up a trial in in the way forgive me Brothers Brothers forgive me but I have to say it I remember when I was young I was about 13 years old and I would do the the labor of a man and you can even ask my brother there he's there he can tell you that I was able to do the labor of a man but many of these people young men they're 20 30 years old and they still don't know how to do anything and we should even instruct them how to even work or even Jesus his father that claimed to be his father but he wasn't his father because God was his his father he took him up and said look this is how you take up the the hammer and this is how you take out the saw and this how you take the nail and then he hit the nail with the hammer and then Jesus would hit a bit crooked and and he he didn't scream he said no son like this like this but we never instruct our children never know how to do anything we never instruct their daughter they should know on what to work they get married and they have no profession oh I wish I was a carpenter

I do it help me but they feel so much pride and they're just 30 years old and they're just about almost like a camel Oh Daddy forget it Daddy forget it son forget it um I'm going to be that I'm going to be this and he comes down from the cam and it comes to reality pin your conscience brother the prophet taught us you live plan as if you're going to live 100 years but live as if Christ comes today the people say oh if we were like that church that church has cheat metal workers they have men who are painters they have painters they have Carpenters they have plumbers and we just dishwashers oh how is that the disgrace is upon us oh the disgrace upon us we need instruction brothers and pray to God instead that he gives us a spirit of wisdom and to begin to train ourselves in the things are for here to to be workers no but we want to run day and night we should instruct our young people for them to learn an office for them to learn how to work for they may be able to help for something in the work of the Lord may they take themselves up so they can advance to grow don't get mad at me Brothers I'm going to finish now that's the trouble in this message everyone wants to take the Baton carry the ball and none of them are chief and even at times they don't even become Indians I'm I'm going to use brother compo forgive me brother compo as an example ever since he arrived I told Brother Campo use the talent that you have as a painter seek out some jobs have I I told you that brother come well I haven't repeated to him out outside in my home about five or six times I told him practice what you know this young man don't even know nothing they should get with some someone that knows brother help me teach me I don't have the opportunity to learn to play uh blogs but help me there brother candelario at times brother alen and brother Pablo the brothers they're working there that's a time when to learn we have brother alejandrito there he can teach many of you but the first thing that they ask how much how much how much how much are you going to pay Jimmy how much time did you go to school or barber in school 8 months he went to school8 months how much did they pay you they didn't pay you anything and this they still don't go a day and they want not know how much oh brother there's something wrong there the other day I'm going to go on to the next scripture Exodus 2012 brother I'm going to take five more months uh five minutes reading the scripture and if the brother can get get get your song Ready honor your father and your mother that your days may be long up in the land which the Lord your God has given you you need to honor your father and your mother let me see let me read well honor your father and that is a pastor and your mother that's a Christian is that how it reads honor your father whoever he may be your father and your mother honor your mother whoever it may be your mother Ephesians 613 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor your father and your mother which is the first commandment with promise not the second but the first that would that he may be well with you and he may live long on the earth they say around there that there was a young girl there I've never spoken with anybody like this they say that there was a a girl there and she asked permission to to her father and that she wanted to go there to the dance and they didn't let her go and she took off and somewhere around there she began to dance with a very good-looking man and then she went out of of of of the ballroom and then he took her there to a trip and then she was dying they had burned her she died with whom did she dance and why did that happen to her because she honored her her father and mother right that I may be well with you and you may live long on the earth I want you to listen real good I'm going to finish anybody that's young that doesn't have a father or any young lady that doesn't have a mother that you might not have that you possibly might be fatherless or you have your your father thousands or hundreds of miles away from here you shouldn't do anything first of all until you first of all you tell me and you don't go and tell anybody else and cover yourself with religion I don't want those young people that around 1 or 2: in the morning they're running around that's not what the word of God the message teaches us that's contrary to the word of God I'm going to bring a scripture once more Proverbs 10:1 and why son makes a glad father foolish a wise son makes a father glad but a foolish man despises his mother Proverbs one my son hear the instruction of your father and do not forsake the law of your mother for there will be a graceful ornament on your head and chains about your neck and these people say oh how good son and how a young good lady that's so pleasing a crown right they should be into your head people saying oh how beautiful how beautiful because they are obeying but her father and her mother have instructed them now here it is verse 10 my son if Sinners entice you to not consent the prophet said the only sin is unbelief the attributes of sin is to smoke but that's not a sin so then this sinner it's not the Sinners that are are drinking or smoking the Sinners that are in the church if they want to entice you you don't consent oh let's go let's go brother Garcia is still sleep he won't even know well where are we going or we're going to Yuma and then they call us brother Bernie and so and so well I don't know brother there's somewhere around Yuma don't don't don't be frighten I have this since before getting here yesterday don't leave yet don't you know that the parents of yours they knowing your Phoenix they're not aware they say brother Garcia is watching for them to be well and everyone wants to pull their own way because they work and they're their man now brother I'm going to give you the last scripture that way you don't think that I'm Antichrist that is why it is written man shall live his father and his mother I don't care what you or somebody else told me that son is subjected to a a a government at home until he gets married and he has to be according to the scripture children obeying the Lord now if the father tells you something that's against the word but you need to give the respect to the father and the mother until the last day that you go out to get married and if you're not here with your father other than your mom you need to be in respect I am responsible for you you understand me those ladies up there I'm responsible and if you cut your hair and your dad doesn't tell you anything he's responsible but if you cut your hair and you don't have a dad here I'm going to call you and if you don't listen I'm going to present you before the church that way people can know that we're not in agreement for the women to cut her hair nor she to use pants or the the young men be just flirting with the ladies or be going around with the ladies you don't have no right for that by your head Divine father this A Mother's Day which people celebrate Lord I have not more to give them to this mothers but to help them to place the discipline of the word you know that I love my mother with all my heart before coming here Lord there's two women that I had in my mind that was my mother and sister L elderly woman that truly Lord they should be placed in a special place according to your word that's the reason why when I see H Lord being a young man without getting married and that he seeks Out Sister Lord I say Blessed Be You Lord because I remember of of of Timothy Lord when Paul speak to him and say of that faith without pretending which was first of all was en Loa her grandmother and then Eunice her mother and I'm sure father that in you he can be found but Lord what bad thing can one of this young people receive like Joel being with sister K that shows to me much l tell me who you're with and I'll tell you what you're looking for oh Lord possibly I possibly hit so hard to this ladies and this young man but the prophet came to restore us to the original Faith father and we can't be raised up without first of all we be shaken of all the things and of the habits that are contrary to your word Lord Heal these young people and these ladies you know quite well father that I do it because they're obligated I'm obligated not as the grand mothers Lord that possibly I take out some candy just some treats like the people the young people call them just to entertain them and possibly I don't want to take out some candy to this people want to take some candy and take them away from me father but at the end of the race they will know that I did it for love for them Lord not because I I was born with that love but that love is from your word it's you yourself Lord speaking through your vessel help them out Lord take them to Perfection bless them Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for e oh oh PR
