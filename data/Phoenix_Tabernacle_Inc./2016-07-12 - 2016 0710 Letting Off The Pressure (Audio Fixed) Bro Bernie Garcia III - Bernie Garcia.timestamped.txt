[43:42] be
[43:44] only
[43:47] be all things are
[43:54] possible only
[43:57] [Music]
[43:59] and I went down and prayed for the
[44:01] little fell and asked our Lord to be
[44:03] merciful to him and the lady taking the
[44:06] little fellow home that night and the
[44:09] next morning when she rose up to her
[44:12] surprise to look at the little fell the
[44:14] big veins was gone the head was
[44:16] practically normal
[44:19] [Music]
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:25] [Music]
[44:28] [Applause]
[44:30] so she rushed it over to the doctor
[44:34] right away and the doctor was so amazed
[44:37] and he said it he checked its blood or
[44:40] whatever they had to do for this shot
[44:42] well I said it doesn't need it anymore
[44:45] and it made quite a stir around through
[44:47] the country just another testimony to
[44:50] the glory of God and know that he he
[44:53] answers prayer when the hearts are
[44:55] sincere and want to believe on him
[44:58] there's nothing too great for him to do
[45:00] and I believe that he just loves to do
[45:02] that for his
[45:04] [Music]
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:24] people believe
[45:27] things are possible amen
[45:40] [Music]
[46:06] [Applause]

[46:43] northwest of fishing and I had a trout
[46:48] line of many you fisherman Brethren here
[46:50] and I was packed out on my back with a
[46:53] little pup ENT and i' W back up into the
[46:56] mountains and
[46:57] I had a little pup tent and some you
[46:59] know equipment and I was catching trout
[47:02] and I just catch enough for what I eat
[47:04] and turn the rest of them loose and I
[47:05] just love to fish for those little
[47:13] [Music]
[47:18] Brook and um I had a moose Willa behind

[47:27] those moose willas off so my little
[47:29] Coachman wouldn't catch in the in the
[47:35] [Applause]
[47:41] Willow and I left the tent went out and
[47:44] chopped it down and had my little axe
[47:46] and caught my fish and come back and an
[47:48] old mother bear in her Cubs that got my
[47:51] tent
[47:53] [Music]
[48:07] [Applause]
[48:12] [Music]
[48:25] and they just tore it all the pieces
[48:29] and so a bear it's just like uh you know
[48:32] you heard of a bear in a China closet
[48:33] it's not what they destroy not what they
[48:35] eat it's what they destroy had a little
[48:37] stove pipe and she just smashed out all
[48:39] the pieces just to hear it
[48:41] Rattle and so uh I noticed and I I do
[48:46] love I anybody here from Kentucky I love
[48:50] Flapjacks you know that you call them
[48:51] pancakes shly and so um and I I like to
[48:55] put m on them and um and I um I I'm not
[49:01] I don't sprinkle I baptize so I really
[49:03] pour it on your plenty plenty molasses
[49:07] and and strange thing when I come up the
[49:10] old mother bear run away over to one
[49:13] side and she CED to the Cubs and one
[49:15] little Cub run off with her the other
[49:17] Little Cub just sat there had his back
[49:19] turned little bitty fellas in springtime
[49:22] and I know better than to approach too
[49:24] close to that little fell because mother
[49:26] might scratch
[49:29] me so um uh she kept coing to it I
[49:33] noticed what's the matter with the
[49:34] little fell and I looked around and he
[49:36] had his head all down like this you know
[49:37] he's moving his hand up and down I
[49:39] thought what's he got I walked around
[49:41] keeping a tree always in
[49:44] [Music]
[49:47] mine so to get up the tree before she
[49:50] could get to me and I walked around and
[49:53] this little fell had got my molassy
[49:55] bucket
[49:59] [Music]
[50:05] and he got the his uh the lid off of it
[50:08] and he didn't know of course how to
[50:09] drink it and he just stick his little
[50:11] paw down like this and lick it up over
[50:13] his face like and they love sweet stuff
[50:16] and he was molasses from the top of his
[50:19] head to the bottom of his feet and he
[50:22] would lick it and I holler get away from
[50:24] there
[50:27] [Music]
[50:33] he didn't pay a bit attention to him and
[50:35] his mother call him he still didn't pay
[50:37] any attention to him I thought well he's
[50:38] found something awful
[50:41] [Laughter]
[50:43] [Music]
[50:52] good so when he looked around he
[50:54] couldn't open his eyes just sticking
[50:56] pull masses know funniest looking little
[50:59] fell I thought yeah there's no
[51:02] condemnation to them it's in the patch
[51:04] that's one than sure I thought just like
[51:07] a real old Pentecostal meeting right
[51:09] this morning got her hands down a
[51:11] molassy Jes as far as it can licking you
[51:14] know the thing of it was when he finally
[51:16] dropped the bucket and run off to them
[51:18] that was scared to come up there and get
[51:19] it the rest of them licking
[51:24] [Music]
[51:31] licking the my lasses off so that's L
[51:34] what we've been doing this morning look
[51:36] at my lashes from these testimonies
[51:39] [Music]
[52:00] [Music]
[52:17] [Music]
[52:22] [Applause]
[52:26] love y amen
[52:36] [Music]
[52:58] back
[53:31] [Music]
[53:38] [Music]
[53:44] [Applause]
[53:56] okay
[54:15] over in the book of Isaiah I just like
[54:18] to quote from one just for a just a few
[54:21] moments uh Isaiah
[54:24] 32:2 and um
[54:27] the name of the Lord is a mighty
[54:30] tower he's a rock in a weary
[54:33] land a shelter in the time of storm I
[54:37] would like to think of that The Rock in
[54:39] a weary land not seeing this group kind
[54:42] of brings something to my memory that is
[54:46] I'd like to State this or text this to
[54:48] say this letting off the
[54:52] pressure I think that's what's happened
[54:54] this morning you know the world is built
[54:57] up under
[54:59] pressure everything is going at a break
[55:02] neck speed and they don't know where
[55:03] they're going they go down the road at
[55:06] 90 M an hour to stop in a Tavern and
[55:09] drink 2 hours before they get home and
[55:11] it just seems to be such a pressure
[55:14] everybody irritable pushing shoving and
[55:18] I I just wonder what the Cure is
[55:27] then I remember a few days ago our
[55:30] pastor I'd come in and I was late with
[55:33] my calls and people gathering in you
[55:35] know internationally around there and
[55:37] sit in the hotels and motel and things
[55:39] waiting and then the pastor was worn out
[55:43] he couldn't make some of his calls and
[55:44] some of them were emergency so I tooked
[55:47] some of his and went to one the the city
[55:50] hospital and the a
[55:52] room 331 I believe was the number I was
[55:55] to go to a woman facing uh an operation
[55:59] and I went down to 3:31 and the woman
[56:02] wasn't there so I went back up and a
[56:05] nurse was standing there patting her
[56:07] foot and I said how do you do I said
[56:11] could you tell me where Miss such a name
[56:14] is I said she's supposed to be in 331
[56:16] she said well if she's supposed to be in
[56:18] 331 she is I thought oh
[56:21] my thank you I went back to 331 again
[56:25] and they said well maybe it's 3:32
[56:27] across the hall no said she isn't here
[56:30] it might have been 2:31 so I went down
[56:33] the stairs and there was a little doctor
[56:35] sitting there at the desk Little Man the
[56:38] first one I ever seen was as broad as he
[56:40] was H so he was sitting there at the
[56:43] switchboard and I passed by and I said
[56:45] how do you do he just looked at me kind
[56:47] of strange I thought uh I don't want to
[56:49] ask him so went on down the room and
[56:51] there was a lady coming from the
[56:53] operation room a lady with a mask over
[56:55] her face and and U the nurse there at
[56:58] the floor she went over to the desk and
[57:00] I said lady I'm a bit confused I said I
[57:04] went upstairs to see a lady at 3:31 and
[57:07] she wasn't there and I couldn't find
[57:09] they said maybe she's at at 2:31 she
[57:13] said well then looking 231 I said well
[57:16] thank
[57:17] you
[57:19] my I couldn't find 231 so I went start
[57:24] down the hall and the little doctor was
[57:25] walking along with the steros Scopes in
[57:27] his hand twist them around like this I
[57:29] said good evening sir I said I'm looking
[57:32] for 231 could you tell me said this way
[57:34] and that way I said thank you for your
[57:38] information what is it I went back and
[57:41] there was another lady sitting over to
[57:43] the desk and I thought she looked pretty
[57:44] calm so I said lady could you tell me
[57:48] told her my story I said I'm a bit
[57:50] confused I'm a minister I'm here to make
[57:52] a call she said just a moment sir she
[57:54] went over looked on the book said yes go
[57:56] right around the corner she's and she's
[57:59] in two part1 so I thought well praise
[58:03] God somebody had the pressure off see
[58:05] it's just the buil up pressure it's the
[58:09] age that we're living in an neurotic age
[58:12] where people don't know what to do where
[58:15] they're going and the doctors don't have
[58:17] the answer for it that's right because
[58:19] the psychiatrist is being doctored by
[58:22] the psychiatrist so they have not the
[58:24] answer
[58:26] but there's some answer surely
[58:29] somewhere we could deal on it for hours
[58:33] but I was just thinking that God has the
[58:36] answer if they could just set in a place
[58:39] like this takes off the pressure
[58:43] amen with people who are are entered
[58:47] into eternity we are not going into it
[58:51] we're already in it right
[58:57] TR God lay out the pr
[59:01] [Applause]
[59:12] [Music]
[59:27] [Applause]
[59:42] [Applause]
[59:51] Glory if the colored people are here
[59:53] excuse this expression but the color
[59:56] lady who gave the testimony at the
[59:57] convention one time she said got up and
[1:00:00] gave her testimony she said Wells I want
[1:00:02] to say this she said I ain't what I
[1:00:04] ought to be and I ain't what I want to
[1:00:06] be and then again I know I ain't what I
[1:00:08] used to be
[1:00:10] so that was it so we know that we have
[1:00:13] passed from Death un life because we are
[1:00:15] alive we're not what we used to be oh
[1:00:18] it's wonderful to know that the pressure
[1:00:20] can be let off that's all the name of
[1:00:24] the Lord is a mighty tower that the
[1:00:26] righteous run into and he is a rock in a
[1:00:29] weary land that's right a rock in a
[1:00:32] weary
[1:00:36] land the Lord of my
[1:00:40] life he has
[1:00:42] never
[1:00:45] fail on my own glory to God I could
[1:00:50] never succeed
[1:00:56] this one I came to
[1:00:59] know there is so much I
[1:01:03] owe and I
[1:01:07] cannot
[1:01:09] fail the Lord I was reading some time
[1:01:12] ago of a great Eagles I preached once in
[1:01:16] the convention of Eagle because the only
[1:01:20] way I know how to speak is watch nature
[1:01:22] and God lives in nature watching the
[1:01:25] eagle seeing its traits and up at the
[1:01:28] temple up here preaching on the lamb and
[1:01:30] the dove the nature of them and see all
[1:01:33] them things are just God speaking to us
[1:01:36] and there's one type of Eagle there's 40
[1:01:38] different kinds of them means a ripper
[1:01:40] with the beak and this Eagle as he gets
[1:01:43] old there's a crust comes over his head
[1:01:46] and um he gets old he goes blind almost
[1:01:49] and he can't hardly get around finally
[1:01:52] when he gets weary and all of these
[1:01:54] feathers are getting loose so he cannot
[1:01:56] fly very high anymore then he goes till
[1:02:00] he goes High into the mountains till he
[1:02:03] finds a certain
[1:02:05] Rock there he sets at that rock now the
[1:02:08] job is that he's got to beat his head
[1:02:11] against that rock until all that crust
[1:02:14] flies off I
[1:02:17] cannot
[1:02:18] fail the
[1:02:21] Lord I cannot
[1:02:26] fail oh
[1:02:30] Lord he has never failed me
[1:02:34] yet every problem he has
[1:02:39] met and I
[1:02:43] cannot fail the
[1:02:47] Lord and they say he'll beat and beat
[1:02:50] until his head will bleed he'll almost
[1:02:53] knock himself out he'll come back and
[1:02:56] beat again until all the crust is gone
[1:03:00] when all that crust goes off his head
[1:03:02] though he's bleeding and wounded he's
[1:03:05] got the Assurance he'll raise up and
[1:03:07] flop what feathers he's got and scream
[1:03:09] out he lets off the pressure why he
[1:03:13] knows as soon as all that crust is gone
[1:03:16] he's going to renew his life again he
[1:03:18] gets renewed again new life is sure to
[1:03:20] come when all the crust is gone then
[1:03:24] sings my soul
[1:03:27] Oh My Savior God to
[1:03:34] thee How Great Thou
[1:03:40] Art how great
[1:03:44] th then sings my
[1:03:49] soul my savior God to thee
[1:03:57] How Great Thou
[1:04:01] Art how
[1:04:04] great
[1:04:08] th and why think what how great a God is
[1:04:12] to be mindful of his Eagle to give that
[1:04:15] eagle a way to renew his life when he's
[1:04:18] old only thing he has to do is beat the
[1:04:20] crust off that's a great thing but oh I
[1:04:23] know another rock
[1:04:26] and I shall that a man can beat the
[1:04:29] crust of the world off there until every
[1:04:32] unbelief has dropped and every shatter
[1:04:34] and ever fet has gone until he has got
[1:04:38] all the world beat out of him all the
[1:04:40] unbelief beat out of him all the pride
[1:04:42] beat out of him all the starch beat out
[1:04:44] of him then new life is sure to come
[1:04:46] then you can let off the Steam and just
[1:04:48] start rejoicing because new life is sure
[1:04:52] to come as long as you can beat the UN
[1:04:55] belie out of you take things and not
[1:04:58] take some uh Dogma some Creed or
[1:05:02] something as some man has made of just
