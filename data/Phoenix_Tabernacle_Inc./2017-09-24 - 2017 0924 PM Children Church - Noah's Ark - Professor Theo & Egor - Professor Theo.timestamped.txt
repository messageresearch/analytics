[52:24] about the belt of truth is Jesus because

[53:28] give very hard spankings either no
[53:29] touching the truth hurts but the belt of
[53:32] truth will set you free
[53:34] okay but Igor you gotta tighten that
[53:36] belt of truth tighten it up because if
[53:38] you don't have your belt on then your
[53:40] pants can fall down and you look
[53:41] ridiculous
[53:42] so it's like when we lie we look
[53:44] ridiculous if you lie you look
[53:47] ridiculous just like if your pants fell
[53:48] down like yeah we don't want that no no
[53:51] no no no so tightly about the truth
[53:55] it's it the belt of truth is invisible
[53:58] put your belt away equal the path of

[1:23:13] believe Prophet Noah but the rain came

[1:23:19] learned that the rainbow
[1:23:22] the only reason there's a rainbow that
[1:23:24] exists is because of the promise that
[1:23:26] God made that he wouldn't destroy the
[1:23:28] world with water so the rainbow doesn't
[1:23:32] mean anything else but the promise that
[1:23:36] God gave
