bless you you may be seated yes depending upon the masses our cientos you all look very beautiful this evening those meat annoy the most honest that badly I just like to share a small a small little testimony with you must get a compartir don't testimony oppa Kenya I think it's about seeing the Lord and all things that we do part Anessa de red el Senor es todos que somos it's really simple is moisten see you so so Saturday sabalo so on Saturday we went hiking and we were up at 24th Street in South Mountain how many of you like to go hiking anybody a man right you get some exercise in there I don't I don't like to go hiking but I do it anywhere hey so we were going hiking and I had my son Ethan with me and my wife sister Eunice and sister Brenda were also with me and we let sister Eunice and sister Brenda go go ahead of us and me and Ethan where were trailing behind and I used the excuse well you know I'll hang out with Ethan and that way he's not by himself because he he goes a little bit slower right but it's really me right so as so as we started hiking you know this trail it's a trail that starts off like the first 20 feet it's it's easy but after that everything is uphill through rocks and it's it's not very far it's about a mile up and a mile down but it's so steep that it really gets your heart pumping I mean to an extreme right you go from let's say 75 beats a minute to a hundred and fifty beats a minute right Riley sided without i watch that my children bought me and I was talking with Ethan and thinking thinking I said you know this is this is a good time to to talk to my son about about how God is in all things and as I started as I started to meditate on on us going up the trail I noticed one thing that there was a provided way for us right a provided way for us to go up the trail safely so I I began to share with my son how when we follow Jesus Jesus provides a way for us and it's the easiest way to victory that's possible right and and the simplicity of that is is amazing right because you know we say to ourselves or we say towards those children well how do I follow Jesus we just have to follow Jesus so as we're going up the trail I noticed that that that getting there was the easy part but there was it was still tough right you're sitting at home on a Saturday and you have to make a decision kind of like sometimes we have to do with choosing to do the right things we're sitting there sometimes and the right thing is right in front of us and maybe it's not the easiest thing to do maybe it's gonna take some effort maybe it's going to make us uncomfortable but if we do it then we understand that we're following God's provided way so that's how the hike started out so as we started hiking like I said it was it was pretty hard huh we got about a third of a mile up and we stopped to drink water and we're like oh man this is pretty tough alright so I started to tell you that I said you know I said as Christians when we're following Jesus it's not the easiest thing to do and sometimes we get tired and sometimes we want to quit right we're like man why don't we turn around right and just head down right we can even run down you know but you know I told you that no we got a we got to continue to go so as we continue to go up the trail and I was telling you that said you know Ethan I said it's so amazing that God provides us a way to follow I said and it's not easy and it's not hard and sometimes we get tired and sometimes we want to stop and maybe we want to turn around because we think it's easier to go back to where we came from than to continue up following Jesus I said that we just have to keep going so so we would drink a little bit water we stop and we we look around and we see the beautiful view we say okay let's go so once we got up a little bit farther probably about halfway up I told I was telling and said Ethan you know there's a lot of ways up here that appeared to be little trails where we think that we may be able to go off into one of these little shortcuts I said did you know though that these little shortcuts as you start going through these places that aren't trails you're gonna trip on a rock and possibly hurt your foot you're going to get cut by the bushes or or or or the trees that are out there and if you're not careful you can even maybe disturb a rattlesnake and get bit by a snake which is pretty as I was tying the Sunday School class this morning when brother al you get bit by a rattlesnake there's a good chance that you might not make it right yeah Bradl snakes are very poisonous I said so if you so as I started thinking as I was telling this teeth and I said man I said isn't it amazing how God is in everything he is here teaching us about following him as were hiking up and moong and he's telling us to stay on God's provided path and what is God's provided path it's his word the simplicity of that right well you know you have all these questions well maybe I should do this maybe I should do that or maybe I should go this where maybe I should go that way stay on God's provided way right and sometimes that's not the easiest thing to do but if we go off the path then we run into danger and we run into things that are unknown and that's for every aspect no matter how young you are or how old you are there's always a way that seems right but maybe it's not we just gotta follow God's Way and as we were talking we eventually made it to the top right and it was tough and it was tough but we felt really good about it and then I saw and then I began to share with him I said you know did you know that God talks to us if we listen he said what do you mean dad I said well close your eyes son I said listen listen to what he's saying to you and I shared this with the Sunday School class again today I said did you know that God talks to you already as a young person and a lot of them looked at me like man oh really for the mic I said really I said you know that little voice that warns you when there's danger or that tells you not to do something because it's bad for you or you're gonna get yourself in trouble you're gonna do this I said that's the Lord talking to you but you know what we just choose to ignore it sometimes and again it follows us from the time when we're maybe at an ice age through the time when we're eatin sage through my life and on it's that same voice that talks to us and the voice gets louder if we follow the path and if we're obedient to the path right because I started thinking man did did our Lord really make it that difficult for us to serve him know he provided a way we make it difficult because we choose to go off of his path and could you imagine all that I didn't want to go hiking and I learned all of that when I went hiking now I understood a little bit I told you now I understand a little bit Ethan why brother branham used to love to go out where there was nature right he would go out in the wilderness and he would see God in everything that he did so remember boys young ladies got to stay on that path it's not the easiest thing to do sometimes way if you don't understand it and I'm done if you don't understand it what's the safest thing to do stay on the path and the path will take you to where that path was designed to go right and if if our Lord's path to salvation was designed to save us from these horrible times that we live in we just have to stay on the past excuse me on the path and we have to trust him amen so anyway just a little testimony god bless you all would you please stand and join us as we stretch our arms worship the Lord and sing father Abraham so we have our little dancers over here they're gonna show us how to dance father Abraham you don't need a microphone sir you are going to wiggle your arms and your feet and sing father Abraham what does is that okay but this time you guys know how I like to sing it the arm you move or the feet that you move as soon as we start moving it you have to move it for the entire song okay can you do that so soon you say right arm that doesn't stop moving ready to go Oh father [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how do you know that you can have fun and be a Christian to a man now the best part of children's church has come and that's what we receive the Word of God how many children know how important the Word of God is children's church this is like a training church for you guys you could learn how to receive the Word of God and that's so important because in our everyday lives we learned that we can't make it without the Word of God like you go to school so you can get some education so you can get smart so you can live in this world because there are certain things you need to know how to do in order to live in this world like read and write and do math and have social interactions with people your age well if we come to church because there are certain things we need to survive spiritually we need patience we need to learn how to pray we need to learn how to hear God's voice so how many kids are ready to hear God's voice this evening amen so we're gonna go ahead and we're going to welcome brother Artie Guzman I'm sorry Magana where's Artie Magana coming in over the RT Magana amen we're going to go ahead and stand as we sing standing on the promises did you know that in the Bible there are so many promises for us kids out of the kids right here how many knew that there was promises in the Bible for us amen so we're gonna sing that song standing on the promises [Music] while standing on the promises of Christ my team eternal ages let these praises free glory in the highest I will shout [Music] or standing on the promises the price might [Music] [Music] [Music] now by [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank You musicians Thank You congregation god bless you I greet you this evening and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated we're gonna do things a little different this evening and I don't have an interpreter up here with me but that's okay I feel that the Holy Spirit is with me here inside so I do have somebody standing right next to me appreciate the brothers back here also I'll give me support good evening and God bless you once again children it's a pleasure to be before you this evening to speak with you a little while over the Word of God and also to the parents it's a pleasure to be before you this evening now I feel really good today and I wanted to say something but I didn't want it to be sacrilegious maybe as brother Branham says but I feel really good today and I hope that there's another young person out there that feels as good as I do because I want to invite someone that has their Bible that has enough courage to come up here and read a few verses out loud for us is there anybody that one of the young children maybe a boy young girl one or two maybe just one anybody if not I'll read them it's okay okay I'll go ahead and read them so if you don't mind I'm going to ask you to stand one more time as we read the word we're gonna be reading in a few scriptures Matthew 7:7 through 8 and I'll give you a moment to turn in your Bibles the Word of God reads like this Matthew 7:7 through 8 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened one more scripture I would like to read mark 11:24 and the Word of God reads therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them we could just bow our heads and we can pray brief prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful to you this evening Lord for allowing us to gather here and your house Lord of worship we come Lord and expecting to hear from you Lord and I I expect to hear from you as well Lord just want you to take control of the service take control of your humble servant Lord that the word would just be brought forth and it's pureness and in its truth and we ask all this father and the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so we know that these scriptures are Jesus is Jesus speaking to us and we know that these words are not only the words of Jesus but they're the words of God because inside of Jesus was the fullness of God amen we also know that these words just going over some basics that these words can be found in the Bible correct now just a question how many of you have your Bibles this evening with you that's great wonderful I don't see everybody with the Bible but maybe next time because the Bible is very very important to the Christian it's the textbook for the Christian and I know we have students here that go to school you get textbooks for English you get textbook for math for history for whatever subject now you go to that textbook and you read it you study from it you learning new things you're giving homework assignments that you need to look for in that textbook because you're gonna have the homework assignment like I said you're gonna have a quiz maybe once a month then you'll have the big test probably once a year or so right it's the same way with the Bible the Bible you pick it up you read it you learn from it you're studying it and it gives you the answers to your questions that you might have also when you're an adult you get those adult homeworks you get those adult quizzes and tests to where you need to look in here for the answers you need to know and find you need to know study this read it so that you can find that answer that you're looking for this book also is very important to where it tells you where you came from it tells you where you're going most importantly it tells you who you are this Bible is the very thoughts of God before the foundation of the world he thought them the the words came to the prophets the prophets wrote them down for us so that we can read them so that we could study this Bible that we could listen we could we could study it and we could learn from it these words as I mentioned they're God Almighty Himself for God is his word there's another wonderful feature about this Bible and but before we go there I want to ask how many love promises we love promises Pienaar like if your parent tells you we're going to go have your favorite food after service mmm that's a wonderful promise right maybe if your parents tells you we're going to take you to do and once a year every year what a promising men what about if it was that new gaming system that you really really want or it just came out a promise right but that promise doesn't mean anything if you don't trust the person that's telling you the promise so if parents if you Primus promised your child something you know they're expecting you to fulfill that promise I remember one time I was with my niece and I just had said what do you want to eat french fries yeah french fries and I said well how about spaghetti spaghetti and I couldn't change her mind from spaghetti I learned a big lesson right there make sure I fulfill what I promised I like to look at promises like Christmas gifts like birthday gifts we all love birthday gifts we all love Christmas gifts amen before when brother when brother Bernie was up here he mentioned did we know that the Bible is full of promises that's exactly what I would like to speak about today this Bible is full of promises their gifts their promises but they're not just from anybody they're from our Heavenly Father God Almighty Himself written down for us to study the text book to read them now I want to ask a question these gifts are they just for your mom and your dad good they're not are they just for the Sunday school teacher what about the funny looking guy that stands behind the pulpit sometimes not so much right it's not just for him the promises are not just for him they are for whosoever will believe the promises and not only that but who's telling you the promise you have to believe that God keeps his word for these promises to take effect last week brother Alex was at the Lighthouse and he said a tremendous statement that I loved this book is good for nothing wait for the punchline okay this book is good for nothing if you don't believe it it's not it's good for nothing and I love that greatly whether Branham gives a scenario of because i used the word whosoever he gives a scenario that it's better for whosoever than to have the name william branham in the bible how many have heard that what about if it said art Magana what if it said sister Marguerite Ocampo well there could be two William branham's there could be two Mariotti throw compost how would we know which one that that gift that blessing that promise applied to while it was the two of them how do you know but when brother Branham says it's whosoever will believe that included him that included you that included me amen by a show of hands we where do we believe the word of God amen this Bible we believe it to be God's Word there's a writer who read through the Bible counted all the blessings he wrote down and counted about eight thousand blessings in the Bible so we just called these promises gifts imagine now you opening eight thousand gifts just for you eight thousand gifts that's what this Bible is we said that we believe the promises that are in there am i right so what is that Bernie that's eight thousand gifts for you that's eight thousand gifts for your son that's 8,000 gifts for brother Ernie for sister Hannah eight thousand gifts isn't that tremendous what's more tremendous let's say that we were going to use those eight thousand gifts twice that's sixteen thousand gifts what if we were going to use them ten times 80,000 gifts let's say that we were gonna use them eight thousand times 64 million gifts what a blessing right it's a blessing for us I believe we deserve to give the Lord I had a praise for that [Applause] my point with all this is that it's it's just not a one and done type blessing it's not a one and done type gift or promise now you might ask yourself brother Hart how do you know that anybody asks yourself though well if not I'm glad you're asking I want to go to Ephesians 3:8 now you have to forgive me because I didn't use the Kings James Version on this I used the New Living Translation verse that I thought that was really really hitting the point of what I was trying to trying to get across that these gifts you can use them once you can use them twice or eight thousand times so it's Ephesians 3:8 and I said this is the new translation version though I am the least deserving of all God's people he graciously gave me the pleasure of telling the Gentiles about the endless treasures available to them that believed in Christ amen isn't that beautiful that's the Apostle Paul who wrote that in Ephesians the endless treasures available to them in Christ now we're gonna take this a little bit farther okay I appreciate you guys working with me without an interpreter I have a quoted sentence here that kind of made my seem a little bit more narrow and if you don't remember anything tonight please remember this this is the one thing I asked that you remember it's a quoted sentence from the message perfection that was preached in 1956 and it states if God promised it God has to take care of his promise now I want you to repeat that with me because I don't want you to forget remember after me if God promised it God has to take care of his promise now what does that mean you want to come up here and try cool what does that mean it means God cannot lie whatever is written in this Bible is 100% the truth you can count on it done you don't need to buy the warranty on it for that for it not lasting its shelf life or it malfunctioning or anything like that no warranty needed this is guaranteed 100% gonna happen but why because God promised it he's gonna promise it to come through that's as simple as it is I I've been under the teaching of the message in my parents for over 35 years and I can think about brother or anyone he says how simple the messages and I think back over my life and I hear the the certain quotes and the certain phrases that we say all the time that we take for granted like the song standing on the promises what does that mean we sing about it all the time that's what that means standing on the promises I shall not be moved from the promises from the Word of God I'm not going to be shaken hold to God's unchanging hand he never lies the word will come true because he said so because God promised it brother Branham tells us how could God ever take back one of his words this is awesome it would be easier for all the stars to vanish in the sky the Sun the Moon the earth but God's Word will never pass away cannot ever fail it's eternal it's forever amen now I want to give you some Bible examples where I believe that the people from the Bible of the characters use this sentence use this phrase so in Noah's time we know that God visited Noah and that it was gonna rain that there was gonna be a flood so Noah didn't keep that to himself he told the people and the people would tell him what's wrong with you it's gonna rain it's gonna flood how is that gonna happen what didn't know what did Noah tell him God promised it God has to take care of his promise same thing with Abraham I'm 100 years old my wife is 90 years old he had a conversation with God he just didn't keep it to himself and the promise was he was gonna have a son he told the people I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna have a son what did how did Abraham reply back to them God promised it God has to take care of his promise now you might be thinking okay brother arts okay we heard about know already we've already heard about a brown how long ago was that what about me today in 2018 how can I use this today in 2018 have you asked yourself that question yes sir if we believe this word to be the truth believe it to be God there is a simple verse in the Bible again that we hear all the time Hebrews 13:8 Amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but we have five senses in our body five senses in our spirit but only one inside the soul it either beliefs or it disbeliefs it doubts it doubts this so if we can take that word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever apply it inside our heart that word is just as powerful just as great today as it ever was if we have Christians sitting here today that believed the word as that the gifts the promises that are here become manifested in our day 2018 let see if this works okay in 2018 is there anybody that's ever been sick a broken bone backache headaches there's a lot of hands that are going up everybody's head should go up we've had something or along the lines of that we just learned that inside this book inside this textbook of the christian's there's promises now we're going to look inside now and see if we could find actually a promise that applies to I'm sick I'm not feeling well I have a headache we're gonna turn into Psalms 103 verses 2 & 3 I don't read it for you if you don't you don't have it there bless the Lord O my soul forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases now that one is not just the single that one's a double you made it the second base on that one closer to closer to home because he forgiveth all your iniquities and he'll athough your diseases let's try another one here how many have you ever been scared or afraid worried or stressed I remember I was thinking and I wasn't as I was meditating I was thinking I used to share a room with my brother when we were younger and we would go home and I would tell him oh I'm so afraid to die Josh I'm so afraid to die and I thought about it eyes were in the world did I get that that I was gonna die probably from the minister or something that's Sunday when I was hiding underneath the bench they were telling me you're gonna die you're gonna die oh my god no I don't want to die Lord I was afraid I was scared I thought I would I thought I would die so I have let's see if we can find a promise inside the word that helps us with that if we're ever afraid if we're ever scared for ever scared at any point I'm gonna look through Psalms 46 one I find one there and that one is God is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble take the promise if you believe this word take that promise it works today in 2018 there's one more proverbs 30 35 proverbs 35 every word of God is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him isn't that beautiful and so simple just like when you believe your mom or your dad or somebody that tells you we're going to Disneyland you're already packing right put your trust in him he will be your shield he will heal you from your diseases he will forgive you from your iniquities working today in 2018 and I know that there's many that can come up here and testify of that this evening I'm not the only one one more okay then we'll take too much more time I have a lot of complexes I like to think at not a lot I like to think I have a lot of complexes but and a lot of the times I'm guilty of saying I can't do that I can't do that I'm not gonna be able to do that coming in and understanding and my eyes being open I know that I need the textbook there's been a lot of times where I say that to myself I can't I can't if there's anybody that has that has ever happened to there's a promise for you there Philippians 4:13 I would like to turn there and that reads I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and I want to read one more in that regards mark 9:23 Jesus said unto them if thou canst believe all things are possible to them that believeth now that's the icing on the cake we're talking about we need healing of our body for sick if we're scared but here Jesus is telling me it doesn't matter what you need because all things that are in your hand in your hand if you can just believe I think that's beautiful I think we we all sometimes overlook how good God truly is to us and the one thing I've always had a trouble with is why are all these promises to me why are all these promises to you it's another simple reason because you're a child of the king isn't that wonderful you're a son or daughter of God now I would this is where I've always had trouble so I would love for you boys to repeat after me man brothers repeat after me I am a son of God sisters I am a daughter of God you could never say that enough you could never think that enough that that those words are so powerful they've been so powerful to me just the mere thoughts of it I like the the ability to say them because I feel that I'm not worthy but God makes you worthy it's hard to accept it though but I'm here to tell you this evening that this Bible God Almighty is real he his word is truth it never will fail you give it a shot one time give it a shot be courageous take one of these scriptures take it or wherever you go just repeat it in your head all the time if there's something that you need I can guarantee you that God's Word will not fail you these are God's given privileges to each and every one of us the Son of God the daughter of God whoever will believe in him now there was a there's a phrase that brother Branham always says and it always impacted me when I was since I was young stir and I always remember seeing it in text and it's always capitalized throughout the message and I wonder why was it always capitalized what is what is so striking about that the phrase is thus saith the Lord now those words still have an impact on me now but when I was younger it stood out to me and I didn't know why and so I started to think about it a little bit more and what was amazing to me is that there's no other ground that we can stand on no other motion that makes us move forward then thus saith the Lord where do we see the saith the Lord brother Branham always had it when he was saying a vision to heal a certain person that was right there in front of him that was his thus saith the Lord the vision where is our vision in 2018 right here this Bible is thus saith the Lord let me talk let me show you what I mean thus saith the Lord with His stripes I am healed thus saith the Lord he is my shield thus saith the Lord resist the devil and he will flee thus saith the Lord draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you thus saith the Lord God will supply all my needs according to his riches in glory thus saith the Lord cast all your cares on him because he cares for you thus saith the Lord greater is He that's in you than he is in the world thus saith the Lord I will always be with you even until the end of the world see how powerful that is not this is see how powerful this is we just said that these were the words of Jesus these were the Word of God it's dust saith the Lord you have thus saith the Lord right here to you in closing I've heard my pastor in many ministers share this many times that you have to identify yourself here in the Bible as I mentioned it's been hard for me to do that to put my name in somewhere here that were I can get a blessing from it that's been hard for me I'm going to admit that to you so there's been a few times where I've asked God Lord I need you right now I need an answer right now I've had it I've had a message at on my phone I just hit it and something would come to me was the answer to my question the the need that I needed so it wasn't a week or two after my dad had passed away that I needed to get back into the root the routine of things going to work taking care of the house doing the normal things that you know everyday life needed to continue and my dad always taught us continue with those things don't ever stop continue you got to keep moving forward but this was my dad and you know he just passed away so I'm thinking how in the world am I gonna continue forward Who am I gonna talk to Who am I gonna go to my dad was the example of Jesus Christ in our household he was the example to me so anything that I needed I always could go to him but it was gone where would I go so I had a CD just playing I don't think I press play it just automatically went on and it was the the mighty war the great warrior Joshua the very beginning of the tape he reads brother Branham reads Joshua three seven now this is a testimony that this word works in this day 2018 I heard that tape God is my witness because this is what happened this is the way I think about it brother Branham was what had a person here in front of them telling them what their needs were deserting their heart that was God in motion and it was being recorded for us to hear that's a supernatural event being recorded for us to hear I believe that that tape those words if it's on mp3 if it's on a reel-to-reel it doesn't matter what it's on supernatural power is you hear that it's a blessing so the Lord spoke to me do that do that tape and it was just a little verse Joshua three seven and it's at the end of it and I was just going about my normal and thinking like I told you how am I gonna do this how is this gonna work what's gonna happen so I heard the tape as I was with your dad so shall I be with thee working in 2018 I was so so thankful to God so humbled but then I thought to myself that's not just for me that's where
