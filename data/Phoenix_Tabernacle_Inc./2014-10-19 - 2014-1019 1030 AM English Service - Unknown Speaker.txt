Sanchez and family of Robert Castillo who lost a loved one are going through a very difficult time so this morning we're going to be praying for them so the Lord give him that confidence the comfort that they need this morning because I know it's a very rough time we live on a rough time this morning this day but with God everything's possible with God everything everything there's nothing impossible for the Lord Jesus Christ because he already did it back then he keeps doing it today and he will do it tomorrow he's the same yes yesterday today and forever we won't forget that because

our offering our ties this morning and think about each and and everyone think about your brother your sister sitting next to you and let's pray one another if you don't have nothing on your heart you don't need nothing that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but pray for the person next to you or a family member I know I need prayer I need prayer every day do I pray every day no I'll be a liar

amen amen good morning uh it is an honor and a privilege to be in the house of the Lord and I feel like something's missing uh I told a brother back there there I go there's something missing here and uh I still feel that and you all know what it is right um where's The Interpreter you get so used to doing something you know becomes a habit you know and it just becomes something you don't even think about it just automatic so I I feel like there's something missing there you know but I I believe God going to help us this morning amen and everything we do and we say how many are happy to be here in the house of the Lord how many can say that you're happy to be a Christian how many are happy to say that you're a message believer Are you ashamed of this message no Are you ashamed of the messenger no I'm not right so whatever he said we want to say we only want to repeat what he said and it's not easy though you know because you will become the minority instead of the majority and as time goes on it just seems like it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and less less people are believe in this message this message is a hard message you know that right you know a lot of people sympathize with it but they can't live it you know and some people believe it but they just can't live it that's the hard part is to live it isn't that right and the only way you can do that or accomplish that is that the Holy Spirit has to come to you and give it to you you cannot Merit it you know you can't pray for it it's just God Sovereign and his grace to you he predestinated you before the foundation World God picked you that that's simple real simple isn't it you know it's like I say I picked this brother here brother Enoch that simple God picked us that's you know that's right and you say well he picked you brother Johnny yep y unbelievable huh I'm a mess and we're all Sinners that's right and come short of the glory of God you know when God came looking for somebody he didn't come and look for the righteous and the good you know he came for he came looking for the the Sinners the lost the Wayward came looking for the prostitute and the Pharisees stood there and the Sadducees stood there you know and here a woman approaches him and comes to his feet begging for mercy yeah because she was a ill Fame woman and I can imagine the the the priest said well does he doesn't he know who that is you know but Jesus turned around and said addressed himself to them he says you are your father the devil religious people holy people godly people and he called them devils and The Sinner woman he says go and sin no more or a worse thing come upon you well I can identify myself with that prostitute amen we're all Sinners brothers and sisters and we're here because of the grace of God I uh I'm kind of a uh messed up person and somebody said well what do you talk like that about yourself brother Johnny because we're all on the same boat you know I believe that there's something wrong with every human being ain't nobody perfect Amen brother humanly speaking amen if there's anything good in us you know what it is God's spirit in us that's why it's called the Holy Spirit Amen in us that's what's good about us if you got if you become a Christian God gives you that little one little piece of that lick that lick of that Pillar of Fire that's what's good about you but as human beings we're rotten no good for nothing nothing good about us so we're on the same boat you know you're not in another boat we're on the same boat we're all messed up yes we all have failures we all have weaknesses some have more than one some have two or three weaknesses you know I feel sorry for them you know normal the normal person has one weakness right everybody has one weakness Jesus had a weakness his weakness was Hunger you see the flesh that that fake tree didn't put up the the fruit when was supposed to so what did he do he cursed it well God knows himself it wasn't even time for it to bear fruit at that time and yet God broke his own law right there he got upset he go well it you're going to wither away and it it it dried up is that right but Jesus had a weakness now we don't have weaknesses right come on we all have weaknesses and that's that one spot right there is the one you have to take care of more than anything else you got to protect it you know so um my weakness is oh brother Johnny you're going to see a we weakness come on now well I'm going to I'm going to do it like the women do it like brother M says he talked to his wife and says she wouldn't tell him and he said brother B said you know how women are they like to keep you in suspense well I'm going to keep you in suspense figure it out what's my [Music] weakness well I am a woman too you know that spiritually speaking I'm a woman so the Church of God is a woman so sometimes you know we act like a woman but that doesn't mean I'm a homosexual now that's right now you know U the Bible says that as it was in the days of Sodom and gomorra so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man would be revealed in our midst yes are we living in that day does it repeat again are we living in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom and gorra so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when he reveals himself and do we have that Revelation before us when God sent a prophet Malachi 4:5 and6 he was not the son of man but he was revealing the son of man to us the word of God is that right now I'm going to read you a code here and and I've got a little problem here I always have a lot of problems I have a lot of problems but one of my problems is God tells me speak on this amen and then I want to speak on this and then something else comes in and get once to get inserted in there so I'm a mess I don't know if I should say this or say this so I compromise and I try to put them together you understand what I'm saying okay so but I'm I'm not doing any benefit to one or the other because I'm kind of stealing one from the other see what I'm saying so I'm going to read you a quote here okay this is not on the PowerPoint up there yet I'm going to read you a code another code another code another code just love to read just like to repeat that's that's what a minister is supposed to do you get up here and you just repeat right we don't interpret the word of the Lord doesn't come to us like it come to the prophet because the Bible says surely the Lord thy God will do nothing but he reveals the fness unto the prophets and the word comes to the prophet first reveals it to him and then the prophet reveals to the people amen okay and then we just repeat what he said that's all we are repeaters okay I'm going to read your quote here it's not up there this is uh 1958 it's uh the message is Faith harenberg I think it's Virginia I believe brother M says this oh Eternal God you said in your scripture that when the son of man shall reveal himself from heaven in the last days I truly believe that you're now revealing yourself from Heaven to the church in Mercy and peace and the next time you reveal yourself it will be judgment upon those who reject speaks for itself doesn't it he says here I TR believe that you're now revealing yourself from Heaven to the church that's what brother batt said okay another quote Feast of the trumpets brother M said and Jesus says As it was in the days of lot so so will it be at the coming of the son so will it be at the coming of the end of the world when the son of man not Son of God when the son of man will will be revealing I'll read that over again Jesus says As it was in the days of lot so will it be at the coming of the end of the world when the son of man not the Son of God when the son of man will be revealing have we had the manifestation of the son of man in our time yes or no right the son of man not the one that died on the cross no okay but his Spirit Jes the spirit of Jesus Christ amen in our time and another man a prophet the Bible says that he will send the spirit of Elijah five times is that right okay and I believe it's the fourth one he said he would bring him under Malachi 4:5 and 6 the next time he brings the spirit of Elijah it'll be to the Jews but the spirit of Elijah is the Lord Jesus Christ okay so then we see the ministry of the son man revealed before us in our time the son not the Son of God when the son of man will be revealing revealing hadn't had it Through the Ages see that's a perfect continuity of the scriptures okay now I might might get myself in trouble for what I'm going to say here okay and see I have a problem I should be getting into the message that I I prepared that I have in my heart that I want to speak but then this is gets inserted in there understand now did you know I'm sure you do some of you I want you to raise your hand when I ask you this question and this could and might get me in trouble well well what can I do can help it okay did you know I think it was yesterday or the day before that the State of Arizona has declared that now a man can marry a man how many know that raise your hand amen wow look at all those hands it's official now brothers and sisters a man can marry a man and it's not wrong it's not wrong it's a law now it's a law and a woman can marry a woman okay and there's nothing wrong with that okay according to the law of manh wow and that's just happened in our precious beautiful State of the State of Arizona where the pillar of fire the cloud in 1963 appeared over this state okay making it a a a holy place okay but now look look at the state of Earth and there's it's not the only state there many other states have declared the same thing so now it's not wrong for a man to marry a man let me ask you a question is it wrong let's say Let's uh let's uh paint a little picture here let's say it's okay okay I give you 20 30 years from now what they going to do when the population stops to exist because a man and a man cannot make a baby you know that right and a woman and a woman cannot make a baby so in 20 years from now that race is going to you know you seen those thing that those little plastic bottles that disintegrate themselves you know self-destructive that's what they're that's what they're that's what they're doing now that that's the plan in mind man marry a man and a woman marry a woman okay so we're not going to have they're not going to have no more children so let's say we lived another hundred years what are we going to do then the world's not getting populated anymore okay so to me definitely it's wrong okay I'm going to read you a scripture here okay I'm not reading you message I'm reading you scripture and for those people out there on YouTube okay that hear this I know the law make man makes the law but there's one law above man's law and that's God's law God's law is supreme amen that's the law I go by I'm going to read you Romans 1:24 through 32 wherefor God also gave them up to uncleanliness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves wow you going read with me Romans 1 24 it's not up there now it's not up there well there it is maybe it is well those guys back to our fast I'll tell you that woo 24 that's what 24th say what's I saying that they dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever more forever amen for this cause gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did not change their natural use unto that which is against nature and like also the men leaving the natural use of the women burn in their in their lust one towards another men with men working that which is unseemingly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat is that Bible is it telling you it's wrong so can you imagine their minds their mentality you know what what you know what they're you know what they're expressing to me that's Insanity that's insanity and when you get out of the word of God the dev insanity and that's the condition that the world is in right now Total Insanity and people are going totally insane why brother why because it's total darkness upon the Earth right now we are in the lady oia Church age the last Church age and there was maybe a little little streak of light there but then brother Brown said it went into total darkness so right now what I suggest to you we all want to be in the light what I suggest to you is you need to run Amen to the feet of Jesus which is the word of God brought To Us by a prophet Malachi 4:5 and6 and if you do not okay you were going totally insane right what what is the dominating Spirit right now in the world sex wow that's even coming to the church now not just the church but under the banner of the message Malachi 4556 a man can leave his wife and marry another one just because she maybe she's too fat yeah or maybe she's lazy the does that give you a right to put away a woman because she's fat and lazy sisters can you put your husband away because he's fat and lazy no I'm not trying to make excuses for me now okay okay but is that is that an excuse I'll go a little further let's say somebody does commit or make a mistake you have the option man to put that woman away if you want to but if you want to you can also forgive her yes sir yes brother B said there remember that remember that young man and that woman where she was a holy consecrated Christian from from Child almost she was raised a Christian okay and then she married this man this young man I guess you were young and he wasn't brought up like that he was in the world and he was in the world he lived in the world then one day he met God or God met him gave his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ and it was hard for him because he was a a newly converted Christian and one day brother B relates the story and says look honey if someday you ever make a mistake don't run away come back how many wives could say that to their husbands if you make a mistake if you make a mistake don't run away come back how many women could say that now this is Brother Brad I'm talking okay because his weakness maybe with women okay we all have a weakness okay what what a what an example brother Brandon gives us there huh wow so could we put ourselves in that situation oh brother I can't do that well brother R gives that little illustration there that he could even forgive she could forgive him you know says no matter what you do if you fall he says don't run away I'll be here for you come back wow to me that's that's with that's not conceivable in the human mind can I say something here did you know that only the bride can forgive amen that's right only the bride can forgive thank you Lord wow I shouldn't have said that huh well that's going to open up the door for somebody well then I then if that's the way it is maybe I go you know slip one slip one and then I come back and repent and tell my wife God forgive me you know you'll forgive me right no well if you do that well brother brother you better close that door right away brother because that's iniquity now and how could you how could you go with another woman knowing that you're going to hurt her okay if you really love her you don't love a woman because of sex you don't love a woman because she's got a pretty face you don't love a woman because she's sexy that's not real love Real Love is when you don't even know why you love her am you just know there's something about that woman you love and she can be all messed up and ugly that's right right am that's right hey I've seen women with a chungles you know monkey faces you know ugly man ugly and I said well what's that woman she's beautiful what's she doing with that gorilla you know hey it's how he treats her if he treats her nice that's right some women are sick of pretty faces they're sick of pretty faces big oh I'm handsome nice no B nothing you know after a while you know when you live with a person day in and day out and you find out how his habits you know wow I don't like this about him and I don't like that about him well what about being a Christian if you're Christians we have tolerance we have patience we have forgiveness right yeah you know we can always forget the other brother but we can't forgive a husband or a wife wife when they do something wrong to us right oh I can forgive my kids but I can't forgive my husband I can't forgive my wife but you can forgive your kids huh that's not even a problem huh it's not even a challenge it's effortless it's like automatic I forgive you but the husband oh you did this to me or the wife vice versa Ain that right right so but what is real love what is real love God's love and there's only one woman made for one man you know that that's the original plan you know I know we're all messed up that's why brother B says when they were going on the second and third marriage brother B says stop I forgive you all just don't do it again amen marriage and divorce was such a scruple such a mess then the prophet stood in the breach they said I forgive you all just don't do it again yes right that's right so a man stood in the breach a man stand in the brid for us that's right Jesus Christ stood in the breach for us now a man stands in the breach for us a man stand in the brid for a man yes sir that's what I believe amen wow I'm going to read you there's the king version and I went and read another version and I said wow that's I better not read that one it's too uh it doesn't uh it doesn't put little flowers on it so I'll just read this version King James version if a man also lies lie if a man also lie with mankind as he lie with a woman both of them have committed an Abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them wow that's the Old Testament right huh but now we know we're under you know God can forgive us right or can he or can you not forgive us tell me who hasn't sin here the first one hasn't sin cast the stone we have all sin and come short of the glory of God you know I ask for myself Mercy I ask God forgive me Lord Jesus I'm I'm a sinner have mercy upon me in this hour right now I have God have mercy on me you know I believe that's what we should all ask now see I'm having a hard time here CU I should already get into the message but I'm still stuck here this's other thing that's inserted in there I'm going to read you another quote Feast of the trumpets and in the papers Across the Nation that we have on the board it displayed it now how that the moon turned from light to Darkness and the Very phenomena of it that the moon draw exactly in the sky the same thing that the Holy Spirit had me to draw here two years ago and showing covering when it went six pictures remember that when brother M talks about the the six moons how they had six lunar eclipse remember that and the Holy Spirit how he came and draw it right on the wall and there was 300 people witnessed that and saw that is that right how many of you remember that raise your hand see not everybody that's that's what makes it hard okay okay it put six pictures then brother B says I put the seventh on there because the seventh church is just a shadow of a light the going that's where Jesus at the door knocking lady you see Church age Jesus knocking at the door because the church had kicked Jesus out outside and he's knocking at the door trying to get back into the human man the human kind or Humanity that's lady how many remember that Revelations 3 remember that that's where Jesus at the door knocking but it goes into total darkness that's exactly in the hour that we're we're living right now is in total total darkness wish that was the church and the Moon is the church represents the church and before the church the shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of royalism the shadow of royalism worldly church has swept across to black out the entire light of the Bible the world got in the light of the reflection do you understand the world crossed in the light of the Moon and blinded out the Sun the reflection of the Moon that's supposed to be giving light to the Earth it was blacked out and it and it come in and draw the picture just exactly like it did by inspiration before it happened now that I believe sister Simpson was a Tucson paper right I don't know if Sister Simpson knew she didn't understand it then she said I cut out some of the pictures for you some notes out of the paper handed it to me and I thought something strange I went in there and picked it up and looked at it and said there it is that's exactly just what I've seen looking for and there it was in the paper sister sinon might tell you what the paper is it is it in there if you want to get a copy uh it's in December 28th and and that's what says it's in the evening edition of December the 28th evening the edition of December the 28 see before we went to Jerusalem to block out its light or what access it does have what time position and what's right it has to shine now it's cutting it off altogether for the last age the seventh age where she goes into darkness what a great thing the Lord is telling us in everything it's never failed out what God in heaven has declared it out and told it look at it and here it it identified it and Vindicated and that is absolutely the truth total darkness how many understand that we just had a a total lunar eclipse October the eth we had a total lunar eclipse how many knew that okay everybody knows that right then after that okay right now the Jews you know how the Jews are under the law okay and they have certain Festival days where they celebrate and right now the Jews are celebrating the Feast of the Tabernacles how many know that amen okay I believe today is maybe like the fourth day or something like that and it ends like around I think Wednesday I think it ends seven days the Feast of the Tabernacle and at the end of that okay of the Feast of the Tabernacles okay we have another eclipse but this is not a lunar eclipse this is a solar eclipse that's different how many know what the difference between a a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse is one two three a few people do and I try to I'll try to explain it real quick see if I can explain to you here's the sun okay here's the moon here's the Earth okay when the moon is between the Sun and the Earth that's a solar eclipse understand and then a lunar eclipse is when you have the Sun and then you have the Earth then you have the moon so the light that's shining on the moon the Earth gets in the way so the light the all the light of the sun cannot reflect on the moon because the Earth is in the way and the Earth Earth gets in the way every time when we have a lunar eclipse or in other words the Earth the world the worlden gets in the way and that's the problem the world gets in the way and the world has come into the [Music] church in the in the church now what do we have we have everything like if it was in the world right we have sodomites we have lesbians we have adulterers we have fornicators we have smokers we have drinkers we have lust lustful people right the world got in the way so the light that Shin from the Sun could not hit the moon directly because the world got in the way and that's a natural thing okay but it speaks of a spiritual thing and when we let the world get in the way the light the Rays of the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to show us his power and his deliverance and his guidance doesn't shine upon us the way it should because the world gets in the [Music] way how many you understand that very simple right so on October the 8th we had a total lunar eclipse total lunar eclipse and then we have the Feast of the Tabernacles and the Feast of the Tabernacles brother bandam explains it and I don't I can't read you the quote because it's too much the Feast of the Tabernacles speaks about the millenum that's what it speaks about the Feast of the Tabernacles okay but then brother brandham in in a shadow of a shadow of a shadow he said you know brother you know the Jews did you know they had seven Church ages how many you knew that that's under the law Israel had seven Church ages and that's us Gentiles we had seven Church ages seven feasts seven Tabernacles seven Church ages first the Jews then the Gentiles okay and then the Feast of the Tabernacle brother BR explains and tells us it's that last day the Millennium probably went over your head didn't I huh but it's a shadow of a shadow of a shadow okay now I'm going to I'm going to skip all that okay wow I I uh I pulled out this thing from the the internet I know I know you can't see it and I don't have it on I don't have it on the PowerPoint but I'm just going to show you here maybe you can see it see this little thing right here here's the sun this is the moon and this is the Earth and this is a solar eclipse see the sun wants to give the light to the Earth but then the moon gets in the way see that that's a solar eclipse the lunar eclipse is when the sun is here and then the Earth gets in the way and then the moon gets uh an eclipse all those things mean something now I'm not I'm not going to get into the the four blood moons and all those things because that is assigned to the Jews okay and for us it's in a spiritual sense a spiritual application okay so how many how many you remember this you've seen all the Evol seen this how brother M talks about that what were they seven lunar eclipse not solar eclipse lunar eclipse that's different that has a different application you understand what I'm saying about you understand me what I'm saying there okay now October the 8th we had a lunar eclipse and on the 23d of October we're going to have a solar eclipse isn't that fun you know what October the 230th that's when brother brandham and sister brandham got married is that right is that wrong did I make a mistake there it's not a lunar eclipse it's a solar eclipse wow and what what is what does the Moon represent brother Bram said watch now listen to this okay brother Bram said what does the the Moon represent now watch the way brother Bram talks he says Revelations 12 he says that's that Orthodox Church that's Israel brother bam says that okay Revelations 12 the son top of her head and the moon under her feet is that right and as the the moon which represents the Law was fading away the sun was Rising but then brother bam says well who is that woman in Revelations 12 he says it's the Orthodox Church they asked him that question what is it it's Israel and then brother brandham also said say he also says that the moon represents the bride the moon the sun is Christ and the Moon is the church or the bride brother Bram says that see but you have to put everything in Balance how brother Bales because remember the Jews also had seven Church ages okay so it's a shadow it's a law the shadow okay and now we have the real thing okay under this under the Gentiles seven Church ages and the light is going coming on more and more and more so in four more days we're going to have a solar eclipse okay on October 23rd wow I wish I could sit down and tell you everything that I understand there maybe you think I'm crazy okay but it does mean something okay and it does have a spiritual application to it when that eclip happens what I understand it's it's it's going to be here United States United States will be able to see it okay I'm just going to skip all that and let me let me get into the message that I have today I'm going to skip all that it's short what I have it's not very much short and sweet the message today titled is standing in the breach amen you know brother man preach a message standing in the Gap remember that okay now I'm going to read you a a scripture first Revelations 5 and then just follow along with me tell me what you think Revelations 51 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and a backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a string strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seal thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the light of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I be behold and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb and they had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth unto all the world and they came and he came and took the book out of him and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book four beast and four 20 Elders fell down fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of the orders which are the prayers of saints and they sang a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book to open the seal thereof for thou that for thou was slain and has redeemed us to the to God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth we know that man foul in the garden of me garden of me man fell and were all lost amen and we're all going to hell but then one day we know God sent a lamb he died for us died on the cross and that's that's what we're seeing here okay in the Book of Revelations the fifth chapter The Book of Revelations is when John went because nobody was worthy to open the book or to even look upon thereof okay but then all of a sudden here comes the lamb and the lamb overcome he gave his life to redeem us and he took the book out of the hands of the devil to say like that because when Adam and Eve forfeit that book they forfeit it to him okay but then the lamb come here snatched it away from him he go I've got the book what is the book it's the book of redemption the book of everyone that is saved that has eternal life and that's a secret okay when was your name put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world wow that's awesome now the lamb has overcome and now the lamb the lamb has the book in his hands who Jesus Christ is that right that's what the Bible says okay now I'm going to read you some quotes here a few quotes and it will be done first we would ask you to be merciful to us pardon us of all of our transgression if we confess our wrongs and our little errors and our secret sins are unknown sins and we confess them also as ministers being priests the sins of the people wow that's a mouthful there isn't that wow together Lord we stand we love the people we feel like Moses when he threw himself in the breach whole the people the wrath of God what a display that was of the righteous of Christ when Christ thrw himself in the brid to save the people we have all sinned right and the Bible says the message here tells us that Moses threw himself in the breach for the people because they all of them had sinned amen and Moses threw himself in the breach amen typing Christ like Christ through himself okay at the cross to die for us that's what it says there right that's what the code said right with the love of Christ in my heart and the feeling for the needy I present them Lord to you upon the altar of sa where the bloody lamb lays as a propitiation for our sins and sickness laying there I plead for Mercy for the people I want to stand as Moses did in the breach for them Lord I say God be merciful for them to them a little longer now wait a minute let me a minute I got to read this a little slower I'm I'm trying to hurry up here cuz this time's killing me with a little of a Christ in my heart and the feeling of the needing I present them Lord to you upon the altar of sacrifice where the bloody lamb where the where the bloody body of the Lamb lays as a propitiation for our sins and sickness how are we Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb right Jesus Christ died on the cross he shed his blood for us to atone for the for us I plead for Mercy for the people I want to stand as Moses did in the breach for them Lord and say God God be merciful to them a little longer and give them another chance now just this quat right here tells us why we're still here in 1963 64 65 maybe around there maybe me a year later whatever the Rapture should have taken place brother Bron went play 1977 the Rapture would should place right but brother brandham is praying here and interceding for the people and he says just a little longer be merciful to them a little longer if give them another chance and I say that today I don't care what you do in 2014 right now he interceded as Moses interceded as Christ interceded for you somebody interceded for you and I don't care what you've done you said I committed adultery so what I'm a homosexual I don't care if you're a homosexual brother sister if you're a homosexual and you have that evil spirit on you you it's not wrong to be a homosexual did you know that it's not wrong to be a lesbian you know what's wrong to stay like that that's what's wrong am I'm a liar let's say I'm a cheater I'm a con man okay there's nothing wrong with that you know what's wrong to stay like that it's like when that prostitute came to Jesus she was a prostitute why she was she not a prostitute she was she had a lustful sexual demon on her and she went from one man to another man to another man to another one to another one right that wasn't the problem the problem is if she stayed like that but she repented and she recognized who Jesus was and that's all you have to do I don't care what you've done I don't care who you are if you're a homosexual if you're a lesbian if you're a liar if you're a your backstabber you're a gossiper I don't care what you are there's still Mercy right now who said it William Mar and Bram said it God be merciful for them to them a little longer he gave them another chance that's what I said give us another chance Lord Jesus before the wrath of God is out upon us it's total darkness it's Darkness we can't see we can't see but he said it shall be light about the evening time what light the message of the hour Maliah 45 and 6 is the only hope for this generation and this generation is what 120 years you know they say 40 years is one generation brother brandham said it used to be 120 years with one generation and if you take that as it was in the days of Noah he preached 120 years it's been 80 years now 80 years and we're going into the last generation the last 40 Years 2013 was 80 years did you know that do the math and figure it out 2013 was the end of the second generation yes but there's one more generation you say oh we got another 40 years no we don't you know you're going to have to forgive me brother sisters but I'm going to go over time now there's no doubt in our mind is there not one doubt God's going to do it you believe it everybody God's going to he's not going to leave anything undone he's going to do exactly what he asked him to do cuz he can do nothing else and remain God if we don't doubt he'll Grant to us now don't forget to pray for somebody who really needs prayer you all know who that is it's me yep brother Brandman is asking for prayer I'm the one that needs prayer standing in the [Music] breach standing in the bridge amen you know why I stand here today before the puppet because he stood in the bridge for me amen for you am a man yes a man a man Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb he was the first one to be adopted I'm going to say it the lamb holds the book but then the the the book was transferred the book was transferred to a man who is that man I've got all this here I'm not going to I'm not going to read that I die here and I believe this you know brother R preached a message the breach between the the seven Church ages brother you remember that the breach now we're going to turn to the fifth chapter now this is not the Seven Seals it is the breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals the breach between now there's also the six chapter and there was the fourth chapter rather Revelations and in that it it's kind of reveals something that would take place after the church is going up that the church goes up on the third chapter in Revelations and does not return until the 19th Chapter of Revelations there therefore the church misses the tribulation okay now now I'm going to read you a quote here I'm going to read the scripture forgive me Exodus 32:30 Exodus 32 write it down you go home read it and it came to pass on the tomorrow that Moses said unto the people he have sinned a great sin and now I will go up into the unto the Lord pre Adventure I shall make an atonement for your sin and Moses returned unto the Lord and said all this people have s a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will forgive their sins in if not blot me I pray out of the book which thou has written Moses is pleading before God to blot out his name he stood before the people God he said wait a minute before you kill them kill me what a spirit do we ever do that and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever has sinned against me him will I B out out of my my book therefore now go and lead the people into the place which I have spoken unto thee behold my angels shall go before thee nevertheless in the in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them but now it was in the Days of Elijah the mighty prophet of the Lord oh God what would we do if we didn't have some man of God in the world that would stand in the breach and try to intercede for the people with enough nerve to tell the people or not nerve but enough Grace to tell the people what's right and wrong it's wrong to be a pervert it's wrong to be a child ballester it's wrong for a woman to love a woman it's wrong enough Grace to tell the people what's right and what's wrong and I'm telling you I don't care what law they pass it's wrong to be a homosexual it's wrong to be an adulter it's wrong to be a fornicator it's wrong to smoke it's wrong to drink it's wrong for you sister to paint your little fingernails even even clean polished fingernails it's wrong it's wrong to cut your hair it's wrong to wear tight breastes it's wrong to wear high heels it's wrong why do you wear high heels to Rocket To Rock right what's your motive what your objective it's wrong to to

been tempted by a woman come on let be honest now I'm man well I'm a Man Too do you think I've ever been tempted sure I have I'm a man but brother bradam gives us the example gives us the key it's so simple what do you have to do when you're tempted you just look you could do a 90° thing your neck goes and you don't think about it you go about your way right forget about that demon right that's all you hit that's what brother man said oh Jesus he was tempted sexually Jesus was tempted sexually Jesus too yeah Jesus was tempted sexually well and brother not brother brandom then why do you have a cross in this car huh touch not handle that oh no brother sister okay enough Grace to tell the people what's right or wrong now I am I'm going to look at this thing here because I'm going see how far I have to go uh see wow I've got all this it's okay get mad at me it's okay you'll get over it are you ready the last book in the Bible Revelation shows us that there will be a return of him in the last days to the Gentile church as sign how they miss it he prophesied to come again just before the great and second coming of the Lord in Malachi 4th chapter Revelations Al third chapter tells us that he will be here in the last days that the same one that will stand in the breach for the people with a little flock that God will give him he'll come in the last days and God said so he'll be a he'll be aign to this gen Gentile nation that her time is no more with the love of Christ in my heart and the feeling for the needing I present them Lord to you upon the altar of sacrifice where the bloody body of the Lamb lays as a preparation for our sins and sickness laying there I plead the mercies of the people I want to S as Moses did in the breach for them Lord and say God be merciful to them to them a little longer and give them another chance don't do it right now Lord let the gospel go just a little further wow when did he say that 1963 just let it go a little further how long did the St 63 all the way to 2014 wow why because what a prophet speaks it's God speaking they're condemned Lord I pray that your great Mercy Grace will be extended to this to the last person that's got their names on the book I know they will it's it's not hard to pray against your Divine word or against or against with Divine word I mean to say Lord the word that promised the word that's been Vindicated the word that's predestinated to these people back there before the foundation of world it's it's not it's not hard to pray that you will save those whose names are in the book because I know you will Jesus says all the father has given me me will come and no man can come unless he has been given what do you do every day brother and sister do you get up and you you go about your business do you pray do you pray for the world do you pray for your kids your sons and daughters how many parents pray for here for your sons and daughters right now the way it is you should be constantly constantly constantly praying for your kids and interceding for them who you William Bram no you you you should be praying for them you know now I haven't got much I haven't got much time now to say something but I want to make this statement now now remember about the squirrels all right that was puzzling scripture in my life that I could never understand and there was another one that puzzled me that was when Moses could tell God a better way than God know how to do things when Moses said the people will say your God was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach wow see that puzzled brother brandham what puzzle me I couldn't understand how Moses could tell God a better way you know because God was going to come and just wipe them all out in the wrath of God but then Moses said wait a minute God wait a minute so Moses is telling God A Better Way have mercy and Moses threw himself in the brid for the people he says and there was another one that puzzled me that was when Moses could tell God a better way than God know how to do anything when Moses said the people will say your God was able to bring you out of Egypt but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach then later I found that that that that Moses that was Christ in Moses standing for the people after seeing all these Miracles and things God did for them they still grumbled and complained God's love not willing one day God was going to take the whole group of them start a new Moses and raise a new generation and Moses here here's the power of a Believer throw himself in the breach for the people and God don't cross over me the breach for the people and said God don't cross over me take me first before you take them wow isn't that awesome Moses interceding standing at the breach for the people take me before you take them and God could not cross Moses the love of that people Moses had the heart of God seen that and could not cross over his Prophet oh my can you see it what prayer can you change God yes sir God's already spoken something there going to be prayer can change it I believe with all my heart brother Brandon brother Bernie is not here but he also interceded for us am that's why we're still here it's an echo of an echo of an echo amen it's William brandham Jesus William brandham and our pastor but I also believe that brother Bernie is not the only one in the fivefold ministry oh oh oh that didn't sound too good that didn't strike too good huh do you feel in a 5f ministry right is there prophets teachers evangelists pastors okay for the edifying of the church and where is the bride just in Phoenix Tabernacle they're in the whole world okay so there's other people interceding but they're only interceding because one man one man Jesus Christ stood on the breach amen for all of mankind of all humanity and said wait a minute God I know they did wrong but I am interceding I'm man standing in the brid for all of this people because they had their names written in the land book of life before the foundation of I don't care they're a a prostitute a wher what you are amen two more and I'm done talk about a jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walked forth listen to this see the book even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are you say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represents that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book Glory opened the seals and tore off the seals and send it it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people wow hallelujah hallelujah now who has the book of redemption in his hand Jesus no read that over again he took the book who the lamb opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are so now the book is in the hands of the seventh angel messenger brother or sister if you can only see what kind of life I live I am no good I am a sinner I have this a bad habit I have this I have that I know that I know that I know I'm a sinner I know I'm no good but I can confess something that I believe that that's the only hope there is now people point you to Jesus Jesus Jesus but in the Bible it's promised that he would send a prophet a messenger seventh angel messenger and then he would take that book the lamp book of love and hand it over to the seventh angel messenger so now he has it in his hands now he knows know whose name he knows not Jesus a man William Mary and brandham knows whose name is in the Lamb's Book of Life yeah she was a yeah he was a prostitute yeah he was a liar he was a drunk he was this yeah he was that but then the lamb interceded for that person for the lamb has overcome you don't overcome I don't overcome he overcome for us so my whole trust all my confidence all my strength all my mental capacity I totally deposited at the feet of that seventh angel messenger amen there you are there you are my what happened the screams the shouts the Hallelujah brother and sister if you could only read into that you would get up and running jumping down and screaming yeah to realize that the book is not in the hands of the Lamb no more it's in the hands of the seventh angel messenger the shouts the Hallelujah they Anointed The the power the glory the manifestations and old John who had been standing there oh brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in Earth everything in the sea heard him holler amen hallelujah men power to be to him that liveth forever and ever when John saw that John is the type of the Bride right Hallelujah you can hear it all over the world and I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ screams out the same thing today hallelujah hallelujah last quote brother and sister takes the book and seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of God is the mystery of the seventh angel woo let read that again first seal first seal brother Brown said this I've got here paragraph 68 I think it is it's on the internet takes the book and seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel messenger for this alone the mysteries of God is the Myster of the seventh angel now we just come
