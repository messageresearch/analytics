assist uh I'm gonna have my friend Olga giving her a round to a plan she has no idea thank you for being here I'm just gonna have you sit right here thank you Andrew soon as brother media Pettis is ready he can come out I want to take you guys back to explain to you why we even have a Christmas - the reason we have a Christmas is because God knew that we needed salvation so I want you to understand 700 years before before Jesus came to the scene we had a prophet by the name of Isaiah he gave Isaiah around the Laplace here we have prophet Isaiah here he is with his candles and his books and he's reading out of the scripture and all of a sudden he falls into a prophecy he fought what and then will get Adam and Eve go ahead and come out here he falls into a vision he falls into this vision and he gets transported to the Garden of Eden boom there he is he's in the garden and then all of a sudden the piano music speeds away and then we hear this sound effect because he's in the jungle he's in the Garden of Eden so he takes the seat what isn't that I had my little buddy in this all because the vision is so overwhelming peace where am I what's going on and then all of a sudden our trusty trees and then we see there's all this rumble in the forest there and because Adam and Eve are running Adam and Eve are running in the garden why are they running because they touched and they ate from the first babying tree in the garden and even some things what does that have to do with Christmas let's just wait they ate come on Adam and Eve run run out of a need run come over here run over here run run run run they're running through the garden go hide hide where's run Adam right give them a round of applause as they're running they need a high hurry go get on out of here and all of a sudden the garden of eden hears this voice where are you at all God is looking for his son where do they go they're hiding behind the piano Lord Oh Did you touch the tree don't tell me that you ate from the tree is going on what's happening and God says because you ate from the tree I have to cover you and these leaves they're not good enough to cover you I have to kill a lamb so what Jesus did is what God did to kill the lamb he covered them with the skin of that lamb because nothing else can cover sin but a bloody laugh but jeez God knew that her little lamb wasn't gonna be good enough for us and for all the future and for all the sins of the world needed a different type of man he himself we need to calm down in the form of a baby not conceived to sin and give a Lamb of God to go to Calvary and die to cover all the sins of the world so right there after the Prophet I say I realized he uttered his what was of this prophecy and he said behold a virgin shall conceive and you'll call his name Emmanuel and Emmanuel means God with us today I said mama can you give this prophet a round of applause can you give these trees a wave yeah thank you trees can you take your branches to the back go ahead and take your branches to the back so then 700 years later we are taken here and the Virgin Mary is a walk-in to the well the Virgin Mary was just an ordinary girl simple little girl probably out 14 years old here she comes go ahead and welcome here with the one with the warm clap so she's walking and all of a sudden she stopped by an angel I'll be the angels okay can I be the angel I don't have any wings I don't Mary do not be afraid for you are favored amongst women God has chosen you Mary you will bear a son and you will call his name Jesus and he will be the savior of the world and Mary said how is this possible i I've never knew man the angel says don't worry the baby that you're gonna have is not gonna be from a man it's gonna come from the Holy Spirit God's gonna come and overshadow you and and don't worry nothing is impossible for God because even your cousin Elizabeth who's already an old and older age you know what I need Elizabeth Rachael would you mind being Elizabeth for me Rachel can you go to the back please Thanks you're not old you're I promise you're not so even a little bit she's pregnant and she's gonna have a baby so nothing is impossible be in unto me as his word yes she said be it unto me according to your word isn't it so beautiful when we hear the word of God that's what we want to say you say okay Lord may it be unto me however you say and she had this awesome man who was gonna be her husband but men marry she probably struggled with a couple of thoughts she said well I'm opposed to have a baby how am I supposed to tell this guy that I mean I'm gonna have a baby and it's not his but are you gonna do what are your parents going to be oh my god I don't know how I'm gonna tell my mom he lost a leg oh yeah Jose Joseph what am I gonna tell Joseph he's gonna think hi Senora you owe me the melons pilaris he is the only kind of policy so she contemplated and contemplated and prayed and trusted and walked to the piano and began to play a song but just knowing just knowing what the angel said gave her comfort and the Holy Spirit started comforting her and as and as Mary comforted herself but Sunday school kids came up to sing their special [Music] and Phoenix Tabernacle gave them a round of applause see how you're all taking part in this plan of salvation you're awesome god is good and all the time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for unto us a child is born unto us a son is and the government will be upon his shoulder and his name will be called wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father Prince of Peace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] can you would you give them just another round of applause for that isn't that beautiful I love it look at our baby yes so there Mary was and she she would get comforted by the Holy Spirit but there was so much she's me so many people talking about about her cuz like this girl she's not even really married yet and she's already gonna be she got a little baby bump and what is going on so you know what she went to go visit her cousin Elizabeth because the angel told her that she was gonna have a baby too so Mary wanted to see that so Elizabeth was outside her house she was probably folding laundry you know she was just pretty depressed because Mary I'll tell you when to come in right all right freeze right there perfect she was a little depressed though because even though she was pregnant she hadn't felt the baby move at all the Lord has found favor with me he's taken away the disgrace amongst the people I know that he's giving me this baby that I something's not right and then I can't even talk to my husband can't even talk back that's annoying who do I talk to what's going on so the reason I love this scene cuz this shows the power of our Lord Jesus Christ before he was even born so the Bible says that Lizabeth was there and Mary walked over and just simply at her greeting when she greeted her aloud saying hands of it mmm the baby inside her jumped with life Oh My blessed are you amongst all women and blessed is the child that you will bear for when you just greeted me my baby leaped for joy why have you come to visit me why has the God favored me so blessed are you that you believed God and you believed that he would do what he promised he would well I have news for you I had an angel spoke to me and told me that I was going to bear a son named Jesus and it was going to be a sign by the Holy Spirit and so that's how powerful Jesus is that even before he was born on this earth the mere presence of him being there inside his mother's womb brought a dead baby to life and that baby as they go ahead and walk offstage they go back inside for a cup of tea and some total puss that baby grew up to be John the Baptist the Elijah that will forerun the first coming of Jesus so the back back over in a in Mary's hometown her young strapping husband come on come on over here you don't talk about you staring at me he's in his water he's he's in his workshop work it away he was a carpenter so he's making sure the stage is nice and intact making sure everything is even and he's but he's kind of upset because he heard the news he saw that Mary was pregnant how did I make you feel buddy ol pal do you want to know No we could only imagine but he was such a good man he was such a godly man that he refused to put her away publicly to embarrass her so he just decided to do it in secret because he loved her but as he slept he fell asleep an angel came to him in a dream and told him Joseph Joseph don't be afraid the baby that marries caring is of the Holy Spirit she's a good girl [Music] that baby is of the Holy Spirit and you will call his name Jesus and he'll be the Messiah the savior of the world so he took that and he jumped up and he said well so he went to go find Mary and he brought her back out and he told her Mary the angel came to me [Music] praise God that we have men that listen to the Word of God and Trust give him a round of applause please so as they were rejoicing they got news a couple of Roman soldiers came out they came out and they gave an announcement they look at the whole town and they said listen up over here where everybody could see you listen up everybody has to go to the town of their birth everybody has to go to the town of their birth for a census for a census yeah Rome wants to keep a good eye on you oh wow mean Roman soldier give them another [Applause] there they went man they went fast hey get back here Mary and Joseph I need you so there they go to that place and they were walking through dangerous territories and there they go their journey and they have to go all the way to Bethlehem but the whole time she was pregnant so she was really slow and she was on a boudreaux she was on a board or guys that they were going go into harsh landscapes past the river passed all kinds of things and then they finally got not look back up but they finally got to Bethlehem at night at night back to the night one yes they got there and it was late at night and they didn't know what to do and all of a sudden it got dark in the church but there was a lot of noise because everybody was talking so kind of whisper where you are cuz everybody was there they came from all over the place because the soldiers told them they had to go to the town of their birth so then they went up and down the aisles knocking ask him if there was room anywhere to stay they needed a room to stay just at that moment the audience kind of quieted down and Mary and Joseph walked over here and they had one last hope because the light was on right about here so they thought there might be something open and the innkeeper came out and they asked him they asked him do you have any room but his wife said tell him there's no room here and then she sat down give her a round of applause to these [Applause] so like a good husband he said well my wife was my wife say there's no room so I can't do anything for you guys but there's also I'm gonna be the casual maxilla okay so so go away so as just as they started to walk away and he saw how pregnant she was he put his hand on his head he felt like a meanie go ahead put your hand on your head you feel like I mean say oh hey you have that barn remember you have that barn for the animals I do I'm so hey guys don't go wait wait I know my wife Dawson wanted me to take you guys staying here but the kids guys go to the back and stay there there's some bedding there yeah you guys can go in there yeah you're a good man sir all right God will bless your business that'll be rated five-star on Yelp okay so then they came over here Mary and Joseph cuz the barn is right on this big old screen and you go you just sit right there take care of her she's pregnant so they're in the barn in this humble little barn this little stable our Lord Jesus was born auntie Joanne would you play Silent Night on the panel just softly why would God the king of the universe the creator of all heavens and earth come to want to be born in this dinky little manger I'm gonna tell you it's a mystery how God will would give up his throne give up the songs of the Angels give up all the gold industry and the gates of pearl and all his splendor to come and be born in the stinky barn with animals and hey the mystery is this he wanted to show us that he could come and live in the humblest of Hearts matter how dirty or broken you think your heart is the God of the universe is willing to come and live right in there no matter how unworthy you think you are God doesn't call the qualified but he does qualify those who he calls and we're all called today to understand his plan of salvation that God will come in the form of a little baby to grow up as a man died on a cross to be that lamp to cover the sins of the world now I'm gonna ask my little shepherds to come out where my little shepherd side and then we can go back to that that none of you can leave it though that's fine see these little Shepherd's they were here and they saw the star and the angel came and said Shepherds behold the Messiah is born go and see him so little shepherds with their little puppet sheep came down calm

I'm gonna sit right here good today Jesus is so cute [Music] glory be to God [Music] so there the little Shepherd's got tangled in my microphone and they sat and they worshiped the baby Jesus and just
