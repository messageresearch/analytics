message manifested sons of god like the most privileged people that should ever walk the face of the earth when we see that his son the lord jesus christ gave his life went to calvary shed his blood so that we might be partakers of the lord jesus christ and we see that the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin we see and know that the blood of jesus christ which he was of his son jesus christ who she said was necessary so that we might be presented blameless and accessible before him we also see and know that it is not the blood even before anything or anything at all ever came into manifestation god chose us to be his children even before drop of blood no wonder the apostles said we are saved by grace our position then can adoption comes who he is but it's something that god has done for your and we think maybe we um having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself it's a mystery might not because

and the holy ghost hadn't been you are a child of god in the time of lutheran foreign the coming of the lord just waiting for the church to positionally but how many believe that the head has already come you put a body on it our part of that body the body automatically moves with the head is that right all when that thought of god was expressed is that's what the manifestation i know that's the way you want me to do it that's your divine will yes it's your order that's the order of the day in quebec is to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of battle for
