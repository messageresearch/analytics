musicians [Applause] we love it and i appreciate you how many of you appreciate you you gotta appreciate you give yourselves the rounds of an applause please [Applause] oh yes we know sometimes it's hard to appreciate ourselves sometimes it's hard to accept that we are awesome but we are and sometimes it's hard to forgive ourselves sometimes it's hard to forgive ourselves for the mistakes we made it's hard enough to forgive other people but when it comes to ourselves sometimes it's even harder to forgive ourselves who knows what i'm talking about like if you're at school and you cheat and you get caught and then you're like i'm the worst kid ever but you're not you just cheated and you need to go to detention and write i will not copy my paper a hundred times no i'm just kidding whatever your teacher says you have to do but we don't cheat do we well not anymore because everybody's at home doing distance learning for the most part but you could always google the answer but that would be cheating too but if you did cheat you have to forgive yourself if you do make a mistake you have to forgive yourself if you do yell at your mom or punch your brother in the face you have to forgive yourself right and then we have to forgive others see there was a man in the bible who had a hard time forgiving somebody his name was philemon not to be mistaken was filet mignon it was philemon but he was a rich man he was very wealthy and we know this possibly because he had slaves so he had servants and he had slaves and he had the fanciest masks for kovitt 19 and then what he also he had a a big house because the apostle paul wrote him a letter and in the letter the apostle paul explained that he had the church in his house so he happened to have a big enough house to host all the people in the church but that man had a slave and that slave betrayed him and he had a very very hard time forgiving that slave i cannot i cannot i cannot believe he would do this to me i trusted him i gave this everything he was my friend i forgave him when he stepped on my toe he was okay i forgave him when he turned my pig into sharoness it was okay i forgave him when he mixed up the posole with the menudo it's okay but this this has gone too far you hear me too far and this there you are you come here i need to talk to you yes you come here come here you know what you did look at you remember when you stepped on my shirt this is nowhere near that i need to talk to you do you see what you've done do you still what do you have to say for yourself what do you spit it out junior what's going on i'm sorry no you're not you did it on purpose look at this this is my livelihood man how could you i don't i don't want to hear it you know what manuel bring me my whip no no get off me no no manuel hey [Music] so he did he did something horrible and he didn't know what to do so he attacked his master and did something worse have you guys ever done that like you did something bad and then somebody comes and i was like hey you did something bad and you're like no no no you're ugly poof and then you run away see that doesn't make things better it would have been better if he was just like i know i'm sorry forgive me i'll accept the consequence and i'll make it better that's all god wants us to do can i get an amen up in here i want to hear the kids say amen okay thank you so he ran away did i win i need no slaves oh meanwhile he ran and the apostle paul was in prison and he knew the apostle paul was a good guy so he went to go visit the apostle paul in prison what i don't have my question luckily for them they had a good sound system in that jail oh who is that my friend where are you i'm right here paul like i said i don't have my glasses oh hello how are you doing paul what brings you here i've led a life of sin i i attacked my my master when he threatened to beat me you attacked your master you've made bad choices my son what is going on you've made bad choice what else have you done have you've told lies before right yeah have you stolen something like the candy from your mom's dresser yeah have you also stolen 20 from your dad's dresser then you have not forgiven him for it yeah sorry dad forgive me you've made bad choices that's that's very bad news that's prime time cnn bad news on nemesis has sinned do you understand what that means yeah oh you know what let me tell you i will tell you that's bad news but there's good news do you want to know the good news yeah well here's the good news my friend first off you want to understand that god is so clean and holy and pure and if you want a relationship with him if you want to hug him you need to be clean but like i said you're dirty right yeah so if you're dirty and he's clean you can't hug him and have a relationship with him do you know what i mean a little bit yes that's bad news but here's the good news again cnn prime time good news here's what happened so jesus christ i'm making it simple for you my friend people complicated too much you got to know this and all the mysteries my friend know this mystery jesus christ came down and he lived a perfect life he never made any bad choices not even stole candy from his mother it can't be so tempting oh sorry mother anyways forgive me he came down and he took all the sin all of your bad choices that time you oh you know what it reminds me he took all your bad choices everything well everything you've done every time you stole candy you lied you cheated at school or that time when you told your dad that a leopard ran like a tiger in your room you know who i'm talking about he died for all of that it's it's beautiful and all you have to do my friend is accept it let me give you an example of just accepting it let's say there's a book on the floor and it has your name on it i'm getting inspired my friends it has your name on it it says benji garcia this is wait you're a kabil huh a nemesis forgive me i'm thinking all over the place so it has your name on it it says nemesis this book is for you and all you have to do is accept it believe it that's it in the same way with jesus christ he already died you don't have to work for it though i got to do this you believe and repent and get baptized so you can show everybody that i am a christian i don't care what people think it's amazing grace [Music] to the feet of the lord jesus christ and unless he mischanged his ways and he realized that he needed that amazing grace is there somebody that knows they need amazing place as we listen to this beautiful song think about the grace that you need in your life [Music] [Applause] but unless he missed knew there was something he had to do i have to go and ever uh say sorry to my master yes you do you have to say sorry to your master but let me tell you i know your master lumen i don't remember but let me tell you i will write a letter for him and i want you to take it can you give me some parchment paper and ink remember what i told you drink some paper okay i got you it's over there my friend come on so in the bible paul writes that onesimus actually helped him in the gospel after he got converted so we don't really know how because the bible doesn't say but if paul was in prison we imagine that maybe he brought him some paper and some pen so he can write letters to the churches maybe he brought him some figs or did you bring the figs my friend hot cheetos or something i don't know but he helped him almost finish here exclamation mark period question mark two plus two is f what do i think oh this is perfect thank you you're welcome take care of my friend so off he went he went on a journey he was terrified he didn't go so fast because he was actually scared he's right now he's skipping slow down you are excited but he was nervous how many have ever had to ask for forgiveness before how many ever messed up and they had to go and say sorry do you go like this hey what's up i totally did you daddy can you forgive me no when you're really sorry and you're really sorry you go like a little puppy with a towel between your legs and you say i i don't you know but i did it and i'm sorry can you forgive me i'll make it right that's how we apologize you go you acknowledge what you did don't just say well you know the blood of jesus and if he forgave me who are you you better forgive me or you're going to hey how you doing no no no if you're really sorry you go and you say i'm sorry like that one time bernie was borrowing uncle joe's truck remember uncle joe bernie don't look at me but bernie borrowed uncle joe's truck one sunday morning and uncle joe said be careful don't crash it and bernie's like come on bro yeah right i got my driver's license but he didn't know what he was doing he was a clown i don't know how old he was anyways don't look at me don't judge me like that bernie got in the trunk and he ran into a pillar but luckily he was on the passenger side so when he got in the car he didn't see it but then since it was sunday morning bernie was sitting right here and he's like i'm gonna hey lord help me you could have something i need i need to repent i need i need i need to do something and something was inside of him because he did something wrong and he didn't confess i know there's a couple of you that haven't confessed a few things and i'm not going to look at you in the eyes but we need to make things right so uncle joe was over there playing the bass you know praising the lord getting his worship on and there goes bernie um uncle joe i gotta tell you something you remember your truck you know what i'm talking about right um yeah yeah the only truck you have yes that one um well remember when you let me borrow it yeah like 20 minutes ago yeah and you said don't crush it well oh i didn't crash it don't go get crazy but i i did get like a little scratch on the side can you forgive me i'm sorry please forgive me i can't even worship the lord i'm sitting in here and i know i'm a sinner forgive me i have to confess it and he just laughed like he did oh okay i forgive you go bro when he went to go look at it the scratch was like that big but thank you for forgiving him but he made it right so we have to make things right as embarrassing as it may be as hurtful as you think it might be we have to make things right so anessimus went to make things right but he was lucky because paul wrote a letter on his behalf and he said philemon accept my son onesimus whom i have begotten in the gospel but accept him not as a slave except him as a brother as a brother in christ for he has the same freedom that you do and i think he was so beautiful because paul even said anything he owes you whatever he did to you put it on my account and when i get out of here i'll pay it but i think it's cool cause paul also said but i'm not gonna mention all that you owe me read it paul actually said that it was cool and then what that was was a beautiful type brother joseph of jesus taking on our sin because that's what he did when satan comes and accuses you brother benji jesus is actually saying satan this is my son who i've begotten in the gospel he's been born again anything he did put it on my account and he took that to the cross so this is a biblical example of the apostle of god fulfilling the role of christ for his converts and believers oh and then the roman soldier thought it was so cool he asked paul so would you write what did i write my oh yes what are you writing about oh yes i always make copies of my letter this will come very in handy it's good when you try to defend the faith too trust me give me the letter so it says okay listen up pay attention everybody pay attention please my dear fell philemon i'm hungry for some rabbi my dear fellaiman holy man my beloved brother your faith is strong you are precious in the lord i love you my brother and every day i think about you in my prayers but let me tell you something my friend my brother or no i was a former servant he came to me and i preached the gospel to him and now he is my son but let me plead something with you my friend my brother don't take back onesimus as a servant take him back as a brother my friend in christ because he has accepted jesus christ so now we are all joint heirs my friend brothers together in the gospel and anything that he has done wrong to you my friend put it on my account i will pay for it and don't forget to mention what you owe me but anyways put it on my account my friend god bless you and god bless everyone in your house what do you think i don't think i don't think i would ever be able to write something like that so i know it's pretty good inspiration of god read your scriptures inspiration they call me paul the aged for no for good reasons too the lord and write his letters in prison or wherever he was and he made up a great portion of the bible kids you should go home today and read the book of philemon with your parents it's only one chapter no no no no no be gone from here not again no what do you want come here come here what is going on i told you i don't want to see your face again walk slowly slower slower hey take light steps i don't want to hear your foot okay come here faster come here come here hey slower all right now step back this is oh oh oh oh you know i could not resist this here give me a run a hug don't touch me we're friends again we're friends again friends instead of slave and master he accepted him as a brother sister joanna can you come to the piano please oh that does that touch you in your fields a little bit forgiveness is so special forgiveness oh no it it just hit different how rory that don't be hitting different though it just hits you deep like ah i know i need to forgive oh the bible says god will forgive you the way you forgive how many want to get to heaven and have jesus say what they didn't do nothing amen i want to get to heaven and have jesus say gideon never get anything back right gideon wouldn't you love jesus to say gideon was such a good boy caleb what did you love jesus to say caleb was an angel yeah jesus is gonna say that for everybody who accepts him in their heart jesus is gonna look at you brother mike and say come here my son you're perfect i see you perfect with no sin you never did anything bad why because he took our sin put it on the cross and died for us all we have to do is accept that and say lord jesus come into my heart i can't be a good boy by myself but if you live in my heart then you can help me be a good boy you can be a good girl through me when we receive the holy ghost we're receiving jesus in our heart and he can help us make the right choices how many would like that amen
