[2:52] [Music]
[3:59] Amen. God bless you.
[4:02] It's good to be in the house of the
[4:03] Lord. Amen.
[4:06] If you would just please stand with me.
[4:10] If you could just turn around and greet
[4:11] your neighbor and tell them, "Welcome to
[4:13] the house of the Lord."
[4:19] Say, "Welcome. Welcome to Children's
[4:22] Church." Amen.
[4:25] [Music]
[4:32] Amen. God is good
[4:35] and all the time. God is good. Amen. And
[4:38] so we're happy to greet you once again
[4:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:44] Christ on behalf of our pastor, brother
[4:47] Bernie
[4:49] Garcia Garcia and everybody here at
[4:51] Phoenix Tabernacle Children's
[4:53] [Music]
[4:55] Church. We just welcome you.
[4:59] So we have a special treat for you
[5:01] tonight.
[5:04] Uh it's uh just brothers and sisters and
[5:08] and young people and children
[5:13] that are just going to bring you
[5:14] something special what God has put in
[5:16] their
[5:19] heart. One of the things that be before
[5:22] we get started,
[5:25] uh, I would like for us to consider
[5:30] is what God has done through us.
[5:35] Well, not through us, but through the
[5:36] Lord Jesus
[5:39] Christ for us.
[5:42] And as we have partaken as we have
[5:45] partaken of these services
[5:49] and we've been
[5:52] blessed, I think it's worth
[5:57] noting that it's important
[6:00] that each of us have received what we
[6:02] have come for this weekend.
[6:07] If you feel that you need
[6:09] something and you feel that you haven't
[6:12] received it yet,
[6:13] [Music]
[6:15] he is here tonight.
[6:18] He's been here all along
[6:21] and he's never left your side.
[6:24] He is a God that is
[6:26] merciful. He is a giving God
[6:30] and he loves us.
[6:32] Let us just go to our scripture found in
[6:34] the book of Luke.
[6:38] We're going to go to Luke chapter 6
[6:40] verse 36 and 37.
[6:45] And the scripture reads like
[6:48] this. Be ye there merciful as your
[6:51] father is also merciful.
[6:58] Judge not, and ye shall not be judged.
[7:02] Condemn not, and ye shall not be
[7:04] condemned. Forgive, and ye shall be
[7:06] forgiven.
[7:16] us that Jesus is the same yesterday,
[7:18] today, and
[7:19] forever.
[7:22] Over 2,000 years ago when he was here
[7:25] healing on earth,
[7:29] Jesus Christ in the
[7:31] flesh and then dying on Calvary for
[7:35] us taking all of our burdens, all of our
[7:38] sin, all of our
[7:43] sickness, making that sacrifice.
[7:47] But what is he doing for us today? Amen.
[7:52] And that's what I want you to think
[7:53] about when you look at the things that
[7:54] you're going to see tonight.
[7:59] What is Jesus doing for me tonight?
[8:03] Let us bow our
[8:04] heads. Loving heavenly
[8:07] father. We love you, Lord Jesus. This
[8:10] evening, we're so thankful, Father, for
[8:13] all of your blessings, Lord.
[8:16] Father, you have just showed us so much
[8:19] love this weekend, Father.
[8:23] Father, we're just humbled by it, Lord.
[8:25] And all we can do is say thank you,
[8:28] Lord, and say that we love you, Lord,
[8:32] and ask you, Father, to just be with us,
[8:35] Father. Live in us, Father. Go in our
[8:38] lives,
[8:39] Lord. our thoughts, Lord. Every step
[8:43] that we take, Father
[8:45] God, may you just be with us. Bless this
[8:48] service, Father.
[8:51] Father, bless our pastor there where he
[8:52] is,
[8:55] Sister Lily. Lord, we love them, Lord.
[8:58] We thank you, Lord.
[9:01] And we love you. And we thank you for
[9:02] the Lord Jesus
[9:06] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[9:12] [Music]
[9:38] God bless
[9:40] you. God bless you.
[9:44] [Music]
[10:03] I set out on a great
[10:07] adventure. The day my father started
[10:10] leading me home. He said there's going
[10:14] to be some mountains to climb and some
[10:17] valleys we're going to go through.
[10:22] But I had no way of
[10:25] knowing just how hard this journey could
[10:30] be. Cuz the valleyies are deeper and the
[10:34] mountains are steeper than I ever would
[10:37] have
[10:40] dreamed. But I know we're going to make
[10:45] it. And I know we're going to get there
[10:50] soon. And I know
[10:52] sometimes it feels like we're
[10:56] going the wrong
[11:00] way, but it's just a long way home.
[11:21] Got some rocks in my shoes and fears I
[11:24] wish I could lose that make the mountain
[11:28] so hard to
[11:30] climb. And my heart gets so heavy with
[11:34] the weight of the world
[11:38] sometimes. And there's a bag of regrets
[11:41] that should have been denied. Yeah, I
[11:44] keep on dragging
[11:47] around. And I can
[11:50] hardly wait for the day I get to let
[11:53] them all
[11:57] down. And I know that day is
[12:01] coming. And I know he's going to be here
[12:06] soon. And I won't turn back. Even if the
[12:10] whole world says I'm going the wrong
[12:15] way, cuz it's just a long way home.
[12:23] [Music]
[12:53] D cuz our God has made a promise.
[12:59] And I know that everything he says is
[13:02] true. And I know wherever we go, he will
[13:08] never leave
[13:10] [Music]
[13:11] us. Cuz it's just a long way home. And I
[13:17] know that day is coming. And I know he's
[13:22] going to be here soon. And I won't turn
[13:26] back. Even if the whole world says I'm
[13:30] going the wrong
[13:33] way, cuz it's just a long way
[13:38] [Music]
[13:45] home. It's just a long way home.
[13:54] [Applause]
[14:29] [Music]
[14:32] When I'm in
[14:34] need, call on the
[14:36] Lord and he helps me. Yes, he hears me.
[14:42] He is
[14:43] faithful and true. won't forget his
[14:50] own. My
[14:53] companion, my best friend, the only true

[15:01] wonderful
[15:03] savior. Jesus the lion of
[15:09] Judah. Our God is tremendous. His
[15:12] strength never failing. He goes through
[15:15] the fire just to save a sinner. Yes, he

[15:24] angels to guide
[15:27] me. There is no storm too powerful. Our
[15:32] God cannot handle. Our God in
[15:35] simplicity revealed in you and me. Came
[15:39] down from his glory and gave us the

[16:00] battles. Oh yes, he will stand for
[16:04] [Music]

[40:36] the doors of heaven will be open

[40:41] the way.
[40:46] We allow
[40:50] life. We allow our struggles.
[40:54] We allow our trials.
[40:57] We allow our hardships to limit the
[40:59] power of our God.

[1:03:59] How many have enjoyed the specials up
[1:04:01] until now?
[1:04:05] Ain't God good?
[1:04:07] Don't he love us? Can we please stand?
[1:04:12] We want to welcome you once again to our
[1:04:13] 2015 convention.
[1:04:19] If you could turn around and and say God
[1:04:20] bless you to your neighbor
[1:04:25] with a big smile.
[1:04:29] On behalf of our our pastor, brother
[1:04:30] Bernie, we greet you in the name of the
[1:04:32] Lord Jesus
[1:04:36] Christ and we welcome you to Children's
[1:04:39] Church.
[1:04:42] You know, I believe that God have
[1:04:43] something special for us this
[1:04:46] evening. How many have received
[1:04:48] something up until
[1:04:51] now? You know, I believe that these
[1:04:53] services have been a
[1:04:55] blessing. You know, most of us are going
[1:04:57] to walk out of here
[1:05:01] different, treasuring something's in our
[1:05:04] heart.
[1:05:06] But there's still
[1:05:09] opportunity for those who haven't
[1:05:11] accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:05:14] Christ or made that
[1:05:17] decision. You know, yesterday was a
[1:05:19] tremendous service yesterday evening.
[1:05:23] A lot of people went through the prayer
[1:05:24] line.
[1:05:27] God was handing out
[1:05:30] blessings, giving you the desires of
[1:05:32] your
[1:05:33] heart. But as I looked
[1:05:37] around, there were still a couple of you
[1:05:40] people,
[1:05:42] reasoning on what God was
[1:05:44] doing. Let me tell you something. God is
[1:05:48] real and he wants to do something in
[1:05:50] your
[1:05:51] life. No, he's calling you.
[1:05:54] do not fight it, he has something for
[1:05:58] you,
[1:05:59] more than what you could understand.
[1:06:03] So if you feel as as the as the service
[1:06:05] goes
[1:06:06] on, if you feel the Lord tugging at your
[1:06:10] heart, just
[1:06:12] remember the altar's
[1:06:14] open, he's here to give you the desires
[1:06:16] of your
[1:06:17] heart. So once again, we welcome
[1:06:21] you. We thank the Lord.
[1:06:24] Okay. For being so good with us.
[1:06:27] We got a couple of petitions.
[1:06:30] Our sister uh Rosa Flores,
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:36] is that is it say right? Yeah. Ask for
[1:06:38] prayer for her son Alfredo. He has court
[1:06:42] tomorrow. Rosio
[1:06:44] Flores Alfredo.
[1:06:48] Sister Yatti Diaz. Thanks the Lord for
[1:06:51] his grace and love and for my healing
[1:06:54] and my daughter's
[1:07:00] healing. We have a petition this
[1:07:03] evening. If you have need this
[1:07:06] evening, right now it's time to ask the
[1:07:10] Lord. So, so as we close our
[1:07:13] eyes, let's everyone close our eyes and
[1:07:15] be
[1:07:17] reverent. Bring these needs to the Lord.
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:32] Let us pray.
[1:07:34] Lord heavenly
[1:07:36] father humbly Lord we approach your
[1:07:39] throne of mercy
[1:07:43] as a group of believers
[1:07:46] Lord believers in your holy
[1:07:50] word. Believers you sent to
[1:07:54] prophet believers that you specialize in
[1:07:58] the impossible.
[1:08:02] And Lord, to this
[1:08:04] evening, throughout this weekend,
[1:08:09] we're so thankful
[1:08:11] for your blessings,
[1:08:14] for your Holy
[1:08:15] Spirit, that guides us, that leads
[1:08:19] us, shows us the path that we must go.
[1:08:24] Lord, we're so thankful this evening.
[1:08:28] We're so thankful for these services.
[1:08:31] So many times you come here and you make
[1:08:34] yourself manifested amongst us.
[1:08:39] And Lord, let us just not go the same
[1:08:42] way that we
[1:08:45] came. We pray we leave better, Lord.
[1:08:51] the petitions that were read,
[1:08:54] Lord, those that are in the hearts of my
[1:08:56] brothers and
[1:08:58] sisters, we ask, Lord, that you grant
[1:09:01] them
[1:09:03] according to their
[1:09:06] faith. And Lord, over the
[1:09:09] weekend, our faith should be
[1:09:14] hired. We have so much to be thankful
[1:09:17] for.
[1:09:19] I just can't I can't stop saying thank
[1:09:22] you Lord.
[1:09:24] Thank you Lord.
[1:09:26] We love you Lord. We ask that you
[1:09:29] continue to be with us the rest of the
[1:09:34] service with the children's
[1:09:38] department for the job that uh they have
[1:09:41] the work that they have put in for this
[1:09:43] this
[1:09:46] service. We ask that they be in your
[1:09:48] precious
[1:09:51] hands. Also for the offering, we ask you
[1:09:54] bless the cheerful
[1:09:57] giver. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:59] Christ,
[1:10:02] we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:08] Amen. You may be
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:12] seated. Has anybody ever struggled?
[1:10:17] No.
[1:10:19] Right. Has anybody had shattered
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:27] dreams? How about your hopes? Have they
[1:10:29] been crushed
[1:10:33] before? I want to tell you about a love
[1:10:36] of
[1:10:38] God when you're up against a
[1:10:42] struggle that shatters all your dreams.
[1:10:47] And your hopes have been truly crushed
[1:10:50] by Satan's manifested
[1:10:54] seas. Can you feel the urge within you
[1:10:58] to submit to earthly
[1:11:01] fear? Don't let the failure stand in
[1:11:07] seem to
[1:11:08] disappear. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:14] He can work through those who praise him
[1:11:17] and
[1:11:17] praise the
[1:11:20] Lord for our God in heaven. Praise.
[1:11:25] Praise the
[1:11:28] Lord. For the chains that seem to bind
[1:11:32] you serve only to remind you that they
[1:11:36] drop
[1:11:38] powerless behind you.
[1:11:44] Hey,
[1:11:48] now Satan is a
[1:11:51] liar. He wants to make you think that
[1:11:55] you are poppers when he knows his son
[1:11:59] that your children are
[1:12:02] lucky. So lift up the mighty shield of
[1:12:06] faith for the battle must be won.
[1:12:10] We know that Jesus Christ is with him.
[1:12:14] So the works are done. And praise the
[1:12:21] Lord. He can work through those who
[1:12:24] praise him to praise the
[1:12:28] Lord. For our God in heaven is praise.
[1:12:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:41] serve only to remind you that they are
[1:12:45] powerless behind you when you pray.
[1:12:53] I
[1:12:54] love I
[1:12:58] love your
[1:13:00] son. Love your love.
[1:13:07] Your

[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:20] song

[1:14:32] you. Oh, I love
[1:14:36] [Music]
[1:14:38] your love of
[1:14:41] yours with your son.
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:15:08] Oh, let's sing that one more time.
[1:15:10] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[1:15:13] the
[1:15:14] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:19] He can work through those who praise him
[1:15:22] and praise the
[1:15:25] Lord for our God in his praise. Praise
[1:15:30] the
[1:15:32] Lord for the chains that seek to bind
[1:15:36] you serve only to remind you that they
[1:15:41] are power led behind you. Let's say it
[1:15:44] one more time. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:15:47] Praise the Lord. Can we sing it one more
[1:15:49] time with all our hearts? Praise the
[1:15:54] Lord. Hear
[1:15:56] it. Praise and praise the
[1:16:01] Lord for our God in Harris. Praise.
[1:16:06] Praise the
[1:16:09] Lord for the chance I see to find
[1:16:12] my
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:20] ser when you pray.
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:29] For the chains that seem to bind you,
[1:16:33] serve only.
[1:16:35] to remind you that they got
[1:16:39] power behind you.
[1:16:47] Praise him. Let's praise him. Give him
[1:16:50] praise this
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:17:00] afternoon.
[1:17:02] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:17:06] As we sing this next
[1:17:08] song, let me ask you a
[1:17:12] question. Do you think God is done with
[1:17:14] you yet?
[1:17:19] Do you think you've had enough of God
[1:17:21] this weekend?
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:29] You might think you're done,
[1:17:34] but he ain't. Amen.
[1:17:38] I remember camp 2004,
[1:17:45] 2005. God came into my heart
[1:17:51] and he did a beautiful thing.
[1:17:56] He changed my eyes.
[1:18:00] He changed my heart.
[1:18:02] He changed my way of thinking.
[1:18:07] And I thought, "That's
[1:18:08] it. He's done with me. There's nothing
[1:18:13] more. God's blessed me beyond my wildest
[1:18:17] dreams.
[1:18:20] There's no way he could have more for
[1:18:22] me.
[1:18:26] But then Sunday night happened.
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:32] It was it it wasn't even supposed to be
[1:18:34] a service.
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:37] It was only supposed to be testimonies
[1:18:39] and
[1:18:44] specials. And as the service
[1:18:49] progressed, I thought
[1:18:54] God, if you have something more for me,
[1:18:58] give it to me,
[1:19:00] Lord. And little by little, I started
[1:19:02] making my way to the altar.
[1:19:07] And before I knew it, God had engulfed
[1:19:10] me in his
[1:19:15] presence. And that night,
[1:19:19] he gave me my new birth.
[1:19:23] So when you be
[1:19:26] careful, be careful
[1:19:29] cuz when you think that God doesn't have
[1:19:30] anything left for
[1:19:34] you and you think God is done with
[1:19:38] you, oh how mistaken we will
[1:19:42] be. As we sing this song, we'd like to
[1:19:45] welcome the drama for tonight.
[1:19:50] And I pray with all my heart
[1:19:54] that when you leave this
[1:19:56] building that you are blessed beyond
[1:19:59] your wildest
[1:20:03] dreams and that when you go
[1:20:06] home that you stay on fire for our Lord
[1:20:11] Jesus and that you let your light shine
[1:20:13] so
[1:20:15] bright that you change the
[1:20:19] world cuz that's what Jesus did.
[1:20:23] And like the brother said this morning,
[1:20:27] Jesus
[1:20:28] is our older brother. What? Is our older
[1:20:32] brother.
[1:20:35] Amen.
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:45] Lord
[1:20:46] Osa in
[1:20:48] Jerusalem by
[1:20:50] day. The soldiers tried to clear the
[1:20:55] narrow
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] street, but the crowd pressed into
[1:21:02] sea. The man condemned to die on Calary.
[1:21:15] He was bleeding from a
[1:21:18] beating. There were stripes upon his
[1:21:21] back. And he wore a crown of thorns upon
[1:21:26] his
[1:21:29] head. And he bore with every step. Oh,
[1:21:34] the son of those who cried out for his
[1:21:39] name.
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:49] Maria called the way of
[1:21:52] suffering. Like a lamb came the Messiah,
[1:21:57] Christ the
[1:22:00] King. But he chose to walk that road out
[1:22:05] of his love for
[1:22:09] you and me.
[1:22:13] down
[1:22:14] the
[1:22:19] Lord to

[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:24:04] Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the
[1:24:11] King. Nobody chose to walk that road out
[1:24:15] of his love for
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:22] him. Down the

[1:25:31] down the
[1:25:33] Lord called the way of suffering.
[1:25:38] Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the

[1:25:44] King. But he chose to walk that road out

[1:31:00] [Applause]
[1:31:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:57] How
[1:31:59] great is the mercy of God?
[1:32:03] How great is God's mercy? Be ye merciful
[1:32:09] as your father in heaven is
[1:32:12] merciful. There was a story of a man. He
[1:32:16] had two sons. And the youngest of the
[1:32:19] sons said, "Give me my inheritance." So,
[1:32:23] so after much pleading, the father
[1:32:25] finally gave in and he gave him what
[1:32:27] belonged to his son. But his son took
[1:32:32] that and he wasted it on prodigal
[1:32:34] living.
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:51] Man, I'm fed
[1:32:52] up. I'm tired of this whole
[1:32:55] situation. Pups, you're a wealthy man.
[1:32:57] And what am I doing? I'm just sitting
[1:32:59] here
[1:32:59] waiting. Waiting for what? For you to
[1:33:03] hit the grave? Nah, I don't got that
[1:33:06] kind of time to waste. You see, you
[1:33:08] don't understand what it's like to be a
[1:33:10] young man who needs to move at a much
[1:33:11] quicker
[1:33:12] pace. That's why I'm here.
[1:33:15] so I can get what's mine. Give me my
[1:33:17] inheritance so I can hit the road and
[1:33:19] shine. Nah, nah, nah. I made up my mind.
[1:33:24] Give me my inheritance so I can hit the
[1:33:25] road and shine.
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:34:02] So there I go on a new adventurous road
[1:34:06] in a far away land with a bag full of
[1:34:09] gold.
[1:34:11] friends. I got plenty of those. I'm
[1:34:14] living that fast life like a young man
[1:34:16] is supposed to be living. Not caring
[1:34:19] about what was or was to become. Just
[1:34:21] what is living in the now. Young, rich,
[1:34:25] living senseless and
[1:34:28] wild. But after a while, I noted that
[1:34:33] noticed that the herd was beginning to
[1:34:34] thin.
[1:34:37] whispers from my so-called friends like,
[1:34:40] "Man, what happened to him? He was cool
[1:34:43] until the money ran out, but now not so
[1:34:47] much." You see, the friends and the
[1:34:49] money, they both came and left in a
[1:34:51] rush. And plus, a famine's hit the land.
[1:34:55] So now it's every man for himself. Me,
[1:34:58] I've spent all my wealth, so I got to
[1:35:00] take any kind of work I can find.
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:31] I mean, I don't
[1:35:33] mind. It's an easy choice between
[1:35:35] starving to death and feeding me
[1:35:39] swine. But I think I'm starting to lose
[1:35:42] my mind.
[1:35:44] Cuz these slops that I give these pigs
[1:35:48] to
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:51] eat, it's starting to look kind of tasty
[1:35:54] to
[1:35:57] me. I said, I think I'm losing my mind
[1:35:59] because these slabs that I give these
[1:36:02] filthy, unclean animals to eat, it's
[1:36:06] starting to look kind of tasty to
[1:36:08] me. How could this be? How could I have
[1:36:12] fallen so low? Me wanting to eat these
[1:36:15] slops when at my father's house, his
[1:36:17] slave, his servant's fridge is about to
[1:36:21] explode. So much food to spare. Why' I
[1:36:25] even leave
[1:36:26] there? How could I ever go
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:33] back? I'll tell him. I'll tell him,
[1:36:36] "Father, I've sinned against you and
[1:36:39] I've sinned against God.
[1:36:41] I'm not worthy to be called your
[1:36:43] son. But at least make me one of your
[1:36:46] servants. Even if it's the lowest
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:51] one. I'll tell him. I tell him, "Father,
[1:36:54] I'm not worthy to be called your
[1:36:56] son. But at least make me one of your
[1:36:59] servants. Even if it's one of the lowest
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:03] ones. Father, I've sinned against you.
[1:37:05] I've sinned against God. I'm not worthy
[1:37:08] to be called your son.
[1:37:11] But at least make me one of your
[1:37:12] servants. Even if it's even if it's one
[1:37:15] of the lowest
[1:37:17] ones, Father. Father, I've sinned
[1:37:20] against you. I've sinned against God.
[1:37:22] I'm not worthy to be called you. Father,
[1:37:24] is that you? Father. Father, I've sinned
[1:37:27] against you and I'm sinned against God.
[1:37:29] I'm not worthy to be called. Stop. Stop.
[1:37:34] You're back. You're back.
[1:37:40] Someone help me. Please get this drugs
[1:37:43] off of here. Get this filled off. Get
[1:37:45] off my Please.
[1:37:48] My son.
[1:37:51] My son that was dead. He's alive.
[1:37:55] He was love and now he's
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:08] [Applause]
[1:38:15] And I tell you the truth, so it is in
[1:38:18] heaven with all the angels in heaven.
[1:38:22] There's a feast with just one soul that
[1:38:25] comes back into
[1:38:27] repentance, back to the father's
[1:38:30] kingdom.
[1:38:47] Is he not well yet?
[1:38:51] Oh, my servants ready to die so
[1:38:55] sick. I've known you. I know you've made
[1:38:57] supplications and prayers. I know you
[1:39:00] elders of Jerusalem have prayed,
[1:39:03] but is there not anybody house in the
[1:39:06] land of Israel that could be able to
[1:39:09] heal him? He my servant is ready to die.
[1:39:12] He's so important to our household.
[1:39:16] Yet there is a man by the name of Jesus.
[1:39:18] He Heals
[1:39:20] Jesus.
[1:39:22] Yes. He can he can do a miracle on on
[1:39:25] him.
[1:39:27] Yes. Please, I beseech you that you
[1:39:32] would go and speak to this
[1:39:34] Jesus. Speak to him and and ask him he
[1:39:38] would come to to our house and and heal
[1:39:41] my servant. Tell him of the things that
[1:39:43] I' that I've
[1:39:45] done. Please, I beseech you.
[1:39:54] Hey Jesus, why don't you tell about that
[1:39:56] time when you multiply the
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:02] Let me tell you, God is so faithful. He
[1:40:05] will
[1:40:07] Jesus.
[1:40:09] Jesus,
[1:40:11] please. I was sitting here by centurion.
[1:40:15] He asked that you please breathe.
[1:40:18] Breathe. He ask that you please heal
[1:40:20] your servant. Please, Jesus. He's a
[1:40:22] worthy man. He He loves He loves our
[1:40:25] nation and he's built us a synagogue.
[1:40:27] Would you please would you please heal a
[1:40:28] servant? Yes. Take me right away. Take
[1:40:36] my lord. My friend. Yes. Look who's
[1:40:39] here. Look who's coming. Boys, is that
[1:40:42] crowd? Could that be him? Yes. There's
[1:40:46] hope yet. Oh,
[1:40:49] please, my friend, do please do me a
[1:40:52] favor. Anything. Send him a message.
[1:40:56] Tell him from me that that I said,
[1:40:59] "Lord, trouble not thyself that that
[1:41:02] that I am not worthy for him to to come
[1:41:05] underneath the roof." You not worthy.
[1:41:08] Neither am I worthy for for me to go see
[1:41:11] him. But if he would just speak the word
[1:41:15] that I know my servant would be healed.
[1:41:18] I know
[1:41:19] that well for one thing that I am a man
[1:41:22] of authority. If I tell him to go, he
[1:41:25] goeth. And if I tell him to cometh, he
[1:41:28] cometh. That's right. As I also know
[1:41:31] that he he has to be a man of authority.
[1:41:35] But what you speak of him that if he
[1:41:38] would command the clouds to move, if he
[1:41:40] would command the ocean to go, he it
[1:41:43] would be possible. Just do me the favor
[1:41:46] and ask him. Amen. That I'm not worthy.
[1:41:49] Yes. Just just speak the word. I will. I
[1:41:52] will. Thank you. I was
[1:41:55] right right this
[1:41:58] way. He says,
[1:42:00] "Wait, wait,
[1:42:02] please. I have a message, my Lord.
[1:42:05] Message for my friend."
[1:42:08] And he says this,
[1:42:11] "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am
[1:42:14] not even worthy to for you to come under
[1:42:16] my roof. I'm not even worthy to come
[1:42:19] before you." Wow. Now I am a man of
[1:42:22] authority. He says, I tell a servant to
[1:42:24] go and he goeth. I tell another servant
[1:42:27] to come and he
[1:42:28] cometh. But he knows that if you say the
[1:42:33] word, just speak the word, it will be
[1:42:36] done. It will be done. So
[1:42:39] wow. I have not seen faith like this in
[1:42:41] all of Jerusalem.
[1:42:46] Go tell him that this very hour it shall
[1:42:51] be done. His servant is healed. Well,
[1:42:54] thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] My servant, he's here.
[1:43:07] He's
[1:43:08] healed. When did this happen? When did
[1:43:11] this happen? about the 11th hour. He's
[1:43:14] healed.
[1:43:16] It's like
[1:43:17] he's like he's Yes. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:33] That's him. That's him right there.
[1:43:35] Yes. Right there.
[1:43:41] Son of David have mercy.
[1:43:45] Jesus,
[1:43:47] heal my son.
[1:43:49] Heal my son. Lord,
[1:43:52] heal my son. Please have mercy.

[1:50:16] Kill her.
[1:50:20] You know what the law says? Kill
[1:50:23] her. She's guilty.

[1:51:46] Does anybody accuse you?
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:53] No,
[1:51:55] no, no. Then neither do I accuse
[1:51:58] you. Go

[1:52:15] [Applause]
[1:52:19] Don't do it again.
[1:53:22] How many How many have been blessed so
[1:53:24] far?
[1:53:27] Amen. Can you give your Lord a clap
[1:53:31] offering? Amen. Praise him harder. Oh,
[1:53:36] thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:53:38] you,
[1:53:39] Lord.
[1:53:41] Amen. The song that we're about to sing
[1:53:45] was written by a a special
[1:53:50] person. And they say that before they
[1:53:53] wrote this song that they were looking
[1:53:54] out into the
[1:53:57] congregation and the person saw how many
[1:53:59] sick people they had among them and it
[1:54:03] broke her
[1:54:05] heart. It seemed like there was no
[1:54:09] hope. And I can only imagine the scene
[1:54:12] in heaven when Jesus looked down on his
[1:54:17] people. And he saw the condition of his
[1:54:21] love. He sent
[1:54:24] Jeremiah. He sent Elijah. He sent
[1:54:26] Elijah. He sent Moses. He sent all these
[1:54:30] men before
[1:54:31] him. But none could pay the
[1:54:35] price to redeem his creation.
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:42] And Jesus and God looking down seemed
[1:54:44] like there was no
[1:54:46] hope. The m he he thought I have to go.
[1:54:51] It has to be me. And then Gabriel came
[1:54:54] up to him. No Lord, don't go for they'll
[1:54:58] mock your
[1:55:00] name. They'll crucify you. Amen. Don't
[1:55:05] go. Send me. Send me Lord. Let me go in
[1:55:08] yourstead. Let me pay the price. Let me
[1:55:11] lay down my
[1:55:12] life. And God looked at Gabriel. No
[1:55:17] son. And then Michael came up. No, Lord.
[1:55:19] Please,
[1:55:20] Lord, don't go. Don't go.
[1:55:24] Please, send me. And then the next
[1:55:27] person, send me. And the next, send me,
[1:55:30] Lord. And God said, stop.
[1:55:34] I must do this for I am their the
[1:55:39] kinsman
[1:55:41] redeemer. Nobody can pay the price but
[1:55:44] me. And with tears in his eyes, he took
[1:55:48] off his
[1:55:49] crown. He lay aside his robe. He put the
[1:55:52] splendor to one side and he began to
[1:55:56] walk down heaven onto
[1:55:58] earth so that he may be
[1:56:01] crucified so that we may have a blessed
[1:56:04] assurance
[1:56:07] because God cannot
[1:56:09] fail. And had it not been for
[1:56:12] him, none of this would have been
[1:56:14] possible.
[1:56:15] But we serve a
[1:56:17] God who is mighty and just. Amen.
[1:56:36] blessed

[1:58:10] [Music]
[1:58:13] me, Lord, you have purchased me. When I
[1:58:18] thought I couldn't be
[1:58:23] lost, Lord, I just want to say how much
[1:58:28] I love you. I lift my hands to
[1:58:32] praise and praise you for I know that
[1:58:38] all of your promises you will

[1:59:54] see his report says it's a finished
[1:59:59] work. So you claim every inch of the
[2:00:03] devil stole from

[2:03:16] [Applause]
[2:03:22] They don't know what they're
[2:03:25] doing. It is finished.
[2:03:36] [Applause]
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:05:12] Can I ask you a question?
[2:05:16] Yes, I can ask you a question.
[2:05:21] Is our God dead?
[2:05:26] What is the status of our God?
[2:05:33] Someone caught
[2:05:34] on. He is risen. What does that
[2:05:40] mean? When they laid Jesus in the
[2:05:45] tomb, he stayed
[2:05:47] there all Friday
[2:05:50] night. All day Saturday. Come on. But on
[2:05:55] Sunday, he rose. But I want to talk
[2:05:58] about what happened on Saturday
[2:06:00] night. You see, Jesus went down to hell
[2:06:06] and he saw all of the saints still in
[2:06:10] bondage.
[2:06:12] and he saw that the devil had the keys
[2:06:14] of and the and the sting of
[2:06:17] death. He went up to the devil and he
[2:06:20] clocked them right in the mouth. He
[2:06:22] said, "Give me those
[2:06:26] keys." And he
[2:06:28] rose on Sunday
[2:06:30] morning as a
[2:06:33] sign that the work that needed to be
[2:06:37] done was finished completely and that
[2:06:41] the gap between the creator and the
[2:06:45] creation was no longer there. But
[2:06:48] Jesus's outstretched
[2:06:53] arms made a way back to go
[2:06:57] home. And it's because he is
[2:07:00] risen that we're all
[2:07:03] here. You know, in Isaiah, the scripture
[2:07:06] says that it pleased
[2:07:10] God for his son to be bruised. Amen.
[2:07:15] that it pleased the Lord to see him as
[2:07:17] the
[2:07:18] sacrifice because he knew why and he
[2:07:22] knew what was going to
[2:07:24] happen because of one because of one
[2:07:27] that stood on the cross. He was going to
[2:07:30] gain the whole
[2:07:33] world. It pleased
[2:07:35] him for Jesus to be bruised and to be
[2:07:38] battered and to be
[2:07:42] broken. When I read that, it blew my
[2:07:47] mind. There's many fathers in here
[2:07:52] today. I don't know. I I don't have a
[2:07:55] son, but I couldn't imagine giving up my
[2:07:59] son to pay the price, to have him walk
[2:08:03] down the streets and to be mocked and
[2:08:06] spit at and to be kicked and to be
[2:08:10] bruised, to be humiliated.
[2:08:15] But it pleased God.
[2:08:18] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank
[2:08:21] you, God. Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:24] Because had it not been for Jesus's
[2:08:26] sacrifice,
[2:08:28] how lost we would be, there really would
[2:08:31] be no
[2:08:33] hope. But just as the sun
[2:08:36] rises a new each day, hope
[2:08:41] rises, love
[2:08:43] rises, peace rises, strength
[2:08:47] rises. But Jesus paid the price.
[2:08:52] We can take another step and go a little
[2:08:54] bit further and try one more time and go
[2:08:58] a little harder because he is risen. Oh,
[2:09:01] thank you,
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:11] Lord. God is faithful. Amen.
[2:09:15] The scripture in 2 Thessalonians 4:16
[2:09:19] [Music]
[2:09:21] states, "For this we say unto you by the
[2:09:24] word of the
[2:09:25] Lord, that we which are alive and remain
[2:09:28] until the coming of the Lord shall not
[2:09:31] prevent them which are asleep.
[2:09:34] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:09:37] heaven with a
[2:09:39] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[2:09:43] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[2:09:46] in Christ shall rise
[2:09:48] first. Then
[2:09:50] we which are alive and remain shall be
[2:09:54] caught up together with them in the
[2:09:57] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. So
[2:10:01] shall we ever be with the Lord. And that
[2:10:05] is the hope of every believer. It's a
[2:10:08] promise that he gave us. Amen. And if I
[2:10:12] know one thing and that is that God is
[2:10:16] faithful and he keeps his promises. If
[2:10:20] you know this song, sing it with
[2:10:23] us. Beautiful, precious memories. Amen.
[2:10:30] Do you want to
[2:10:34] know where I'm
[2:10:40] going? Where I'm going?
[2:10:45] I'm going
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:55] through where I'm going. We're one step
[2:11:00] away from the finish line.
[2:11:03] We can't quit now. I'm going
[2:11:08] to hell for me. I'm going up
[2:11:16] yonder. I'm going up
[2:11:21] yonder. I'm going up
[2:11:25] yonder to be with my Lord. Do you want
[2:11:29] to go?
[2:11:33] I'm going up
[2:11:37] yonder. I'm going up yonder.
[2:11:43] I'm going up
[2:11:46] yonder to be with my Lord. Listen now.
[2:11:53] Oh, I can take the
[2:11:58] pain. All the heartaches they bring.
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:03] I've got comfort in
[2:12:07] knowing I'll soon be
[2:12:11] [Applause]
[2:12:12] gone. Oh, as God gives me grace.
[2:12:18] Hallelujah. I'm going to
[2:12:21] run this race
[2:12:25] until I see my
[2:12:29] Savior to me.
[2:12:35] I'm going up
[2:12:40] beyond. I'm growing up
[2:12:45] yonder. I'm growing
[2:12:49] up to be with my
[2:12:55] Lord. I'm going up yonder.
[2:13:01] I'm going up yonder.
[2:13:07] I'm going up
[2:13:10] yonder to be with my Lord.
[2:13:18] I can take the pain,
[2:13:23] the heartaches they bring.
[2:13:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I've got comfort
[2:13:30] in knowing
[2:13:33] [Music]
[2:13:44] hallelujah. I'm going to run this
[2:13:50] race until I see my savior.
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:11] Hallelujah. I'm going
[2:14:15] be to be with my Lord.
[2:14:19] [Music]
[2:14:22] I'm going up
[2:14:27] beyond. I'm going up
[2:14:32] beyond. I'm going up
[2:14:36] beyond to be with my
[2:14:42] Lord. I'm going up
[2:14:47] beyond. I'm going up beyond.
[2:14:54] I'm going up
[2:14:57] yonder to be with my Lord. Do you want
[2:15:00] to go up yonder? One of these days it's
[2:15:03] going to happen. One of these days it's
[2:15:07] going to take place. Hallelujah.
[2:15:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:14] I'm going up beyond earth to be with my
[2:15:25] [Applause]
[2:15:34] Lord. Why? Why?
[2:15:38] Why? A question that'll never be
[2:15:41] mastered.
[2:15:43] Why? Why? Why? A question with infinity
[2:15:50] answers. Why? Why? Why? Who knows? Nor
[2:15:56] you are
[2:15:57] I. Why? Why? Why? My heart violently
[2:16:04] screams as it's painfully beating
[2:16:07] inside. Why? I asked myself questions
[2:16:11] that I could have answered if I tried.
[2:16:15] It's me against me. I against I a white
[2:16:18] dog, a black dog until the day that I
[2:16:22] die. I against I me against me. Who
[2:16:26] would have thought that I'd be my worst
[2:16:29] enemy?
[2:16:31] He's there when I'm awake and he's there
[2:16:32] when I'm asleep. And brother, he's
[2:16:35] waiting for me in the school parking lot
[2:16:37] cuz he sure doesn't want to hear these
[2:16:38] words that I
[2:16:39] speak. So this is for me. Who? Me? Yeah,
[2:16:44] you. The one who's trying to kill me and
[2:16:47] murder me. The one that claims to know
[2:16:49] my every weakness. The critic. The man
[2:16:52] holding up my every single
[2:16:54] insecurity. The one throwing low blows.
[2:16:57] The one fighting dirty. digging around
[2:17:00] through my memory to find something new
[2:17:02] to use to come out and strangle me.
[2:17:05] Digging up those yesterdays that I so
[2:17:07] frantically laid into graves. And
[2:17:09] brother now just remembering the remains
[2:17:11] of my dead and gone
[2:17:13] today's one behind that way of thinking
[2:17:15] I had when I confessed to the world I am
[2:17:18] a living hell. And brother that voice
[2:17:20] that I work so hard as silence just
[2:17:22] keeps on breaking free from his padded
[2:17:25] cell. Cuz all he wants to do is hurt me.
[2:17:28] All he wants to do is hurt himself. The
[2:17:31] one that runs straight into the gates of
[2:17:32] hell when he wants to feel a little bit
[2:17:34] better and calls that garbage help.
[2:17:37] Whispering terrors, you can't do it.
[2:17:39] You're not good enough. Always putting
[2:17:41] me down. Ruben down in the gutter. Why
[2:17:43] don't you stay? The one that had me
[2:17:45] avoiding the mirror because brothers and
[2:17:47] sisters, I was afraid. That low down
[2:17:50] life that I was living was taking a
[2:17:52] toll. You see, my shadow itself was
[2:17:54] simply a grave. Pushing and pushing.
[2:17:57] Come on, let's see how bad it can get.
[2:17:59] Brother, I had an itch and I scratch
[2:18:01] with razor blades and cool down with lit
[2:18:02] cigarettes, claiming dying's never been
[2:18:05] so fun. Brother, you just can't ever die
[2:18:08] soon enough when your state of mind is
[2:18:09] live fast, die young. Yes, here lies the
[2:18:12] one and Reuben's his name. The one that
[2:18:15] got me in every critical condition, bad
[2:18:17] situation and still looked around for
[2:18:19] someone to
[2:18:21] blame, saying, "Son of God, look where
[2:18:24] you been. Look where you from. You
[2:18:27] yourself know you're not even at 10% and
[2:18:29] your Christian don't walk the way you're
[2:18:30] supposed to. But brother, that soft
[2:18:32] still voice inside begins to get loud
[2:18:34] and say not worthy. Huh? Well, that's
[2:18:36] right. No one is. But that doesn't
[2:18:38] change the fact that he chose you. Amen.
[2:18:42] Justification. Yeah, it's okay. But
[2:18:44] brother, that sometimes that's as far as
[2:18:46] this wants to go. Sanification is a
[2:18:49] brother. When it comes to the Holy
[2:18:50] Ghost, this right here sometimes wants
[2:18:52] to cry out no
[2:18:56] thanking the Lord for the blood that
[2:18:57] he's bled. Repents and repents and goes
[2:18:59] around does the very same thing again
[2:19:01] and again. Still thanking the Lord for
[2:19:03] the blood that he's bled. And when he
[2:19:05] finds himself between a rock and a hard
[2:19:07] place, he finds comfort in the word. But
[2:19:10] sometimes this right here can't take the
[2:19:11] lashes from the things that the father
[2:19:13] has said. Doing enough just to get by.
[2:19:17] And when the Holy Ghost begins to come
[2:19:18] down, it's not by feeling, but oh with a
[2:19:20] feeling that he's real quick to deny.
[2:19:23] That's why he hardens his heart, says it
[2:19:25] isn't for me. Locking it up and throwing
[2:19:28] away the key. Saying, "I can't cry. I
[2:19:31] can't let the Joneses see me cry. Can't
[2:19:33] go to the altar. What would so and so
[2:19:35] think?" Convincing himself that his
[2:19:37] heart's made of
[2:19:39] stone. Well, brother, let me ask him a
[2:19:41] question. Why is it you cry yourself to
[2:19:43] sleep every night and break down
[2:19:44] whenever you're all on your own?
[2:19:47] That don't sound like no heart of stone
[2:19:48] to
[2:19:50] me. I want to be a Junior Reef. I want
[2:19:54] to be a Art Magna. I want to be a
[2:19:56] Benjamin Garcia. I want to be a Sergio
[2:19:59] Narete. A walking, talking, living,
[2:20:01] breathing testimony. But the man in the
[2:20:03] mirror that says he knows me, looks me
[2:20:05] straight in the eye, calls me a
[2:20:07] phony. The same hands that wipe away my
[2:20:10] tears are the same hands behind my toes
[2:20:12] and snares. Brother, this right
[2:20:15] here, this is the cross that Reuben and
[2:20:17] only Reuben must bear. Must Jesus bear
[2:20:20] the cross alone while all the world runs
[2:20:22] free. No, there's a cross for everyone,
[2:20:23] my brother, and there's a cross out
[2:20:25] there for me. It's me against me, I
[2:20:28] against I, a white dog, a black dog
[2:20:30] until the day that I die. A consecrated
[2:20:33] cross, I'll bury till death shall set me
[2:20:35] free. And then go home my crown where
[2:20:37] there's a crown out there for me. Oh
[2:20:39] Lord, let me make it through today just
[2:20:41] for today. So that on that day I can
[2:20:43] say, "Oh precious cross, so glorious
[2:20:45] crown, oh resurrection day, ye angels
[2:20:47] from the stars, come down and bear my
[2:20:49] soul away."
[2:20:55] Amen.
[2:21:02] God bless you.
[2:21:06] So uh I was uh born and raised uh being
[2:21:10] a Christian being in uh the Christian
[2:21:12] religion which is a
[2:21:14] blessing and over the years as I you
[2:21:18] know became uh we're coming up to my
[2:21:21] teenage years um there's been a lot of
[2:21:24] like temptations a lot of trials that
[2:21:26] have occurred during it and so you know
[2:21:31] it's being in what I'm in now high
[2:21:33] school you know you try to fit in with
[2:21:35] the right crowd and sometimes that
[2:21:37] pushes you away from the word of God and
[2:21:40] you know and like just just being out
[2:21:44] there being out there partying and and
[2:21:47] it just it just doesn't make you want to
[2:21:49] be here. And so over time, you know, I
[2:21:53] kind of just lost the feeling of uh
[2:21:55] wanting to go to church or wanting to
[2:21:57] even uh show
[2:21:58] up. And um I kind of just went with the
[2:22:02] emotions of things, you know. I, you
[2:22:04] know, I just showed up there cuz I had
[2:22:06] to be there cuz I
[2:22:08] was cuz I was like almost like obligated
[2:22:11] to be there. I just wanted to get it
[2:22:13] done. I just wanted to get it over with.
[2:22:14] Honestly, I just wanted right after I
[2:22:16] just wanted to go hang out with my
[2:22:17] friends, go out and party, and you know,
[2:22:20] I I really did not want to be there. And
[2:22:22] so sometimes it's it's hard because in
[2:22:25] the back of your mind, you know that I'm
[2:22:28] a child of God.
[2:22:30] And and sometimes you just you you know
[2:22:33] you want to change but it it's hard cuz
[2:22:35] you keep wanting to do those things and
[2:22:37] you're kind of scared of change and
[2:22:42] so so you're kind of like scared of
[2:22:45] change and
[2:22:47] then and so um sorry
[2:22:52] and so um it makes it it makes it hard
[2:22:55] it makes it hard to live that life. And
[2:22:58] honestly,
[2:22:59] uh,
[2:23:01] being being a c- being Christian is is
[2:23:04] hard and it has it has its ups and
[2:23:07] downs, but I always know that God's
[2:23:09] right there beside me and then whenever
[2:23:11] I need him, he'll always be there. And
[2:23:13] so I know that I shouldn't be afraid to
[2:23:15] change because because I know that he
[2:23:19] will if I put my life in his hands, then
[2:23:21] he will guide my way. You know, it it's
[2:23:23] honestly you can't it it's God we're
[2:23:25] talking about. You can't just give him,
[2:23:27] you know, 50%. You know, if you really
[2:23:29] want to change, you have to put your all
[2:23:31] into it, your whole heart into it and
[2:23:34] like he will make the change for you.
[2:23:35] You just got to put your trust into
[2:23:40] him. Amen. How many of us can identify
[2:23:44] with that
[2:23:45] tonight? Amen. That's right. He's with
[2:23:48] us at all times. Hold to God's
[2:23:50] unchanging hand. Trust in him. He will
[2:23:52] not leave you. That's right. We're we're
[2:23:55] gonna have our brother Aaron come up
[2:23:57] right now and talk a little bit
[2:24:00] about his struggles and uh we know that
[2:24:04] God is always with us.
[2:24:06] Amen. Good evening. God bless you all,
[2:24:09] my brothers and sisters. We are brothers
[2:24:11] and sisters, right? Amen. I'm just here
[2:24:13] to give a little bit of my testimony and
[2:24:16] hope that it'll be a blessing or that it
[2:24:18] can it can touch somebody tonight. Um,
[2:24:21] you know, I like my cousin who came
[2:24:23] before me, I was born and raised in the
[2:24:25] message. Um, it's a privilege and an
[2:24:27] honor and honestly something that I've
[2:24:29] been taking for granted. Um, if I could
[2:24:32] go back and I changed so many things
[2:24:34] about my life. Um, but you know, God, he
[2:24:37] he does things for a reason. And
[2:24:40] recently, I've just felt like I've been
[2:24:42] running away from my religion. You know,
[2:24:45] I I just haven't been wanting to come to
[2:24:47] church. Um, it's something I've
[2:24:49] struggled with for a while and I just
[2:24:51] don't have I don't have the the desire
[2:24:54] to go or to do it. I've become
[2:24:55] comfortable with my own life. A life
[2:24:58] that that you know, you go out in the
[2:25:00] world and you see everything and it
[2:25:02] looks good. Everything looks good. You
[2:25:04] know, they show you in the commercials,
[2:25:06] you see it on social media, speaking to
[2:25:08] the people that are on social media.
[2:25:10] Everything looks great. But why are we
[2:25:12] selling ourselves short? Well, we we are
[2:25:15] children of God. Why? Why don't we claim
[2:25:18] what is ours? And so I have been
[2:25:21] struggling and I've been going through
[2:25:22] the motions. I've been going to class
[2:25:25] and I was in I was in u one of my
[2:25:27] storytelling classes. Um they teach you,
[2:25:30] you know, the art of storytelling and we
[2:25:32] had an assignment to choose to choose a
[2:25:34] story and you know I just treated it
[2:25:36] like any other assignment. Okay, I'll
[2:25:37] I'll choose a story. And so I chose this
[2:25:40] story and and long story short, the
[2:25:42] story ended up being about somebody who
[2:25:44] gave their life for people who didn't
[2:25:46] deserve it. And me going through that, I
[2:25:50] had been struggling with all these
[2:25:51] things with not wanting to go to church
[2:25:53] and running away from from from God and
[2:25:56] just not wanting to do it. And there
[2:25:58] where I least expected in the classroom
[2:26:00] while telling my story, it was God
[2:26:03] coming down and telling me that I
[2:26:04] haven't forgotten about you.
[2:26:07] And it was just honestly it was it was
[2:26:09] so eyeopening and just such an
[2:26:11] experience to know that regardless of
[2:26:14] what I go through and regardless no
[2:26:16] matter how far I try to run from God,
[2:26:18] he's still watching each and every one
[2:26:20] of us. And why my brothers and sisters,
[2:26:23] why are we going to sell ourselves
[2:26:25] short? You know, we we all need each
[2:26:28] other now more than ever. We shouldn't
[2:26:30] be pushing each other away. And you know
[2:26:32] many times I notice myself I I'm not
[2:26:34] very open to people and I apologize for
[2:26:36] that. But you know we need to learn and
[2:26:38] we need to grow together because you
[2:26:40] know the end is near. Why why are we
[2:26:42] pushing our each other away? You know we
[2:26:45] should be closer now more than ever. And
[2:26:48] honestly we are we are children of God.
[2:26:50] And we just need to remember that. And
[2:26:52] no matter how far we run, we must always
[2:26:54] come back to that voice in our heads
[2:26:56] telling us that that we were made for
[2:26:58] more, that we deserve more. and that
[2:27:01] regardless, you know, just just give it
[2:27:03] all to him because that's all that we
[2:27:05] can do. We are unworthy, you know, we,
[2:27:08] you know, we're born in sin and
[2:27:10] honestly, we just need to give it all to
[2:27:12] him. And I hope that, you know, that
[2:27:14] something that I have said has touched
[2:27:16] you and honestly, I just wish all of us
[2:27:19] the best. You know, we're all in this
[2:27:20] together. God bless you.
[2:27:27] [Applause]
[2:27:29] We're we're here tonight because
[2:27:31] brother, we we don't want to play we
[2:27:33] don't want to play church. It's there's
[2:27:36] real people with real issues and we
[2:27:38] believe there's real healing. We believe
[2:27:40] we believe that Jesus Christ has risen
[2:27:43] and with he's with us here today. He's
[2:27:45] not just that God with the centurion.
[2:27:47] He's not just the God with with the
[2:27:49] prodical son and the king back then.
[2:27:51] He's here with us today resurrected in
[2:27:52] our lives today.
[2:27:55] We're going to Okay. Well, what brother
[2:27:57] Aaron said, God, God's always with us.
[2:28:01] He's always there. He's always been
[2:28:03] there. That soft little that small voice
[2:28:06] inside of you that tells you not to do
[2:28:07] it when you do it, brother. That's
[2:28:09] that's that's the little portion of God
[2:28:10] that's always with you. That's the
[2:28:12] that's the identification of a of a son
[2:28:15] and daughter of God. Not everybody has
[2:28:17] that voice. Now everybody, not everybody
[2:28:20] has
[2:28:23] that. Brother Dante right here is going
[2:28:25] to share his experiences and speak about
[2:28:28] the about what what God has put in his
[2:28:31] heart. Hello and God bless you everyone.
[2:28:33] Uh my name is Dante and I am a little
[2:28:36] nervous to be standing before you here
[2:28:38] today, but I would just like to jump
[2:28:40] into it.
[2:28:41] Um so it was camp of 2013 where I had an
[2:28:46] experience with the Lord and I received
[2:28:49] something special and through that
[2:28:51] experience
[2:28:52] uh it just made me want to read the
[2:28:54] message and you know pray every day talk
[2:28:56] to the Lord every day and it was like
[2:28:59] that for a while
[2:29:02] but I would like to be real with you
[2:29:04] guys and real with myself. I did lose
[2:29:08] that fire and I did fall into
[2:29:11] temptation. You know, I um I did find
[2:29:14] myself hanging out with the wrong group
[2:29:16] of friends. Um you know, I did drink and
[2:29:20] I went ahead and partied.
[2:29:22] Um but after doing those things or even
[2:29:27] during sometimes I would feel convicted
[2:29:30] and guilty. I guess you could say it was
[2:29:32] I would, you know, that small voice that
[2:29:34] you hear in your head, you know, telling
[2:29:37] you that what you're doing is wrong and
[2:29:40] it always just hit me hard sometimes.
[2:29:42] But,
[2:29:44] um, but I knew that if change did come,
[2:29:49] um, you know, I wouldn't be living that
[2:29:50] lifestyle no more. And it was a
[2:29:52] lifestyle that I did become used to. And
[2:29:55] I did become I became scared of uh for
[2:29:59] change, you know. And
[2:30:01] um I did find myself
[2:30:05] uh not wanting to
[2:30:06] accept the the way that I was living was
[2:30:09] wrong. And
[2:30:12] so even though I am not or I'm not where
[2:30:16] I'm supposed to be, I I have faith that
[2:30:20] through this the conviction that I feel
[2:30:22] or or through prayer that the Lord will
[2:30:24] will set me on the right path. But not
[2:30:27] only do I hear voices that um tell me,
[2:30:31] you know, what you're doing is wrong, I
[2:30:33] do also hear or get have thoughts that,
[2:30:36] you know, you're not worthy. You know,
[2:30:38] like what you had is gone. and you're
[2:30:40] never going to get it again. But to set
[2:30:42] aside all emotion and feelings, I just
[2:30:44] have to believe that I am a son of God
[2:30:46] and that he will help me one day. Amen.
[2:31:35] how I used to think then and how I think
[2:31:40] now. And I
[2:31:43] remember
[2:31:45] feeling ever since I was younger, since
[2:31:50] I was born in this message
[2:31:53] that I I never party,
[2:31:57] drink or like had this
[2:32:03] huge like sin like that and I just felt
[2:32:08] like I did sin and I was hurting. in
[2:32:11] church that you're born in sin. So, but
[2:32:16] I just thought my sins were not always
[2:32:19] not big enough for me to to think that I
[2:32:24] needed to go to the altar and cry about
[2:32:27] it. Just like everybody else, I always
[2:32:29] saw them crying for for whatever reasons
[2:32:32] they had.
[2:32:34] And and I just felt like I had really no
[2:32:38] reason to cuz though I I I did do stuff
[2:32:43] wrong cuz I I was I've never been
[2:32:46] perfect but just felt like my like
[2:32:49] people always have like
[2:32:51] this like this story to tell of how God
[2:32:54] changed them and it's always something
[2:32:55] big or like they've almost died or how
[2:32:59] they God brought them out of something.
[2:33:00] I just felt like that wasn't me. So, I
[2:33:05] didn't want to be like type of person
[2:33:07] who who would fake it and go to the
[2:33:10] altar cuz I wanted my feelings with God
[2:33:14] to be
[2:33:15] sincere. So, I was stuck in that
[2:33:19] feeling of like I didn't see a point
[2:33:25] of of what to ask God. I didn't I didn't
[2:33:30] see if there was a reason for me to ask
[2:33:33] God of anything or be sad of
[2:33:36] anything. But I also was being in that
[2:33:40] situation. I was very
[2:33:43] frustrated they and mad how all those
[2:33:46] people could do all
[2:33:48] that party drink or whatever it would
[2:33:51] be. And for me it was so complicated and
[2:33:55] so hard because something could always
[2:33:57] be there to me stopping me from doing or
[2:33:59] not feeling not not feeling right of
[2:34:02] even being a part of that. And I was mad
[2:34:07] cuz like I I didn't want that to be
[2:34:08] there.
[2:34:12] And I've had my different experiences
[2:34:15] with God, whether it be me and God alone
[2:34:19] in church or me and God alone in my
[2:34:23] room.
[2:34:26] And
[2:34:28] I I little by little have come to the
[2:34:33] realization that not many people can say
[2:34:37] that that God's kept them from those
[2:34:39] things and that I am blessed for being
[2:34:44] able to to do that for God helping me
[2:34:48] through that, keeping me from all those
[2:34:51] things.
[2:34:54] And I
[2:34:58] um and now that I I have the choice in
[2:35:02] my heart, I have an understanding now in
[2:35:03] my heart
[2:35:05] that I do have to be sorry for my sins,
[2:35:09] even if they're the simplest thing. And
[2:35:11] I have to have God in my heart
[2:35:14] completely. And I'm
[2:35:17] still this day
[2:35:20] um wanting that with you.
[2:35:23] I know I want you in my life and I know
[2:35:26] that I'm not where I used to be, but I
[2:35:30] want to give my heart completely to
[2:35:33] you.
[2:35:35] And I just one day I want to
[2:35:41] be certain and I know that for now. I
[2:35:45] know now that I want you in my
[2:35:49] life and I just want you to guide me and
[2:35:53] guide my heart to where you want
[2:36:00] [Applause]
[2:36:10] it. God bless you.
[2:36:13] Um, if there are any visitors here, my
[2:36:15] name is Tiffany. Um, I've been coming to
[2:36:19] this church since I was at least four
[2:36:22] years old. And this is my short
[2:36:25] testimony about a small part in my life
[2:36:28] that I'm saying not for me. I'm saying
[2:36:32] this for all of you because I love you.
[2:36:36] And if what I'm about to say touches at
[2:36:38] least one person,
[2:36:39] then that would mean a lot to me. and
[2:36:42] pretty sure that God would be
[2:36:46] happy. After many liberations at many
[2:36:48] camps, I came back home only to desire
[2:36:51] the same thing that I know isn't good
[2:36:53] for me. Growing up, I had low
[2:36:56] self-esteem. I never felt beautiful and
[2:36:58] never felt wanted.
[2:37:02] I knew of the love of God, but as a
[2:37:04] young girl with low self-esteem, I
[2:37:06] craved a tangible being to want me, to
[2:37:09] call me his and beautiful and
[2:37:11] loved. I never knew to guard my heart
[2:37:14] because I loved
[2:37:17] attention. And when I got it, I tried so
[2:37:20] hard to not let
[2:37:22] go. I did everything to make sure this
[2:37:24] person who made me feel so alive never
[2:37:27] wanted to leave. I would lie. I
[2:37:30] compromised my value to keep someone who
[2:37:33] I thought I loved. I lied to myself and
[2:37:36] thought that I didn't need to follow
[2:37:38] God's work to every letter in order to
[2:37:41] have a happy relationship in a Christian
[2:37:43] life. So after many camp liberations, I
[2:37:46] felt that I was set for life. I felt
[2:37:49] that I was okay and that's all I needed,
[2:37:52] just an experience here and there.
[2:37:57] I come back to this person and crave
[2:38:00] that attention, forgetting the attention
[2:38:02] that God had for me on the cross. It was
[2:38:06] not only selfish, but it was damaging to
[2:38:08] more than just me. Of course, not
[2:38:10] listening to God. God's still small
[2:38:13] voice in my heart caused me a broken
[2:38:15] heart. So, I stopped relying on my
[2:38:18] emotions and me and feelings. And I
[2:38:20] cried out to God alone in my room. Not
[2:38:23] at church, not in a meeting. It was
[2:38:25] alone in my room. Just me and
[2:38:29] God to wake me up from this unreal love
[2:38:31] that I was addicted to. To keep me from
[2:38:34] lying for affection, from craving
[2:38:36] temporary love and to just hold me in
[2:38:38] his arms as I fall into his true love
[2:38:42] and his love only.
[2:38:44] I allowed him to break my chains and to
[2:38:47] give me freedom of myself, to give me
[2:38:50] his godly confidence and to be brave and
[2:38:53] confident in who he has made me to be.
[2:38:56] God bless you.
[2:39:11] You know, I experienced God's love at a
[2:39:13] very young age, and during the years
[2:39:16] after that, I had more experiences at
[2:39:20] camp. But little by little, I started to
[2:39:23] feel like it wasn't real
[2:39:26] anymore. And being grown up in this
[2:39:28] church, I saw a lot of fake, and I
[2:39:31] didn't want that.
[2:39:35] And I saw actually Satan was very sneaky
[2:39:40] enough to hide these invisible
[2:39:43] chains. These chains that wore skirts.
[2:39:46] These chains that talked to Christian
[2:39:48] talk. These chains that could sing a
[2:39:51] special. These chains that could praise
[2:39:54] God. But in my heart, I knew there was
[2:39:57] something wrong.
[2:39:58] It wasn't until
[2:40:00] 2011 where I realized and God revealed
[2:40:04] it to me that I needed to feel him in my
[2:40:08] heart. But the real Jesus because life
[2:40:12] without Jesus is no life at all, you
[2:40:16] know,
[2:40:16] and and I don't want to waste my time,
[2:40:20] you know. I want to fight the good
[2:40:22] fight, but fight it for
[2:40:24] Jesus. And I want the real Jesus.
[2:40:28] And I can't say that more
[2:40:31] because it's it's so scary to see that
[2:40:36] you can play a role as being a Christian
[2:40:39] and no one will know that you're not
[2:40:41] even serving the real Jesus.
[2:40:45] So I thank God that I'm blessed and that
[2:40:47] I'm certain that he is real in my heart.
[2:40:51] Thank you.
[2:40:53] [Applause]
[2:40:57] [Music]
[2:41:02] Brother Brandham spoke about being
[2:41:04] certain of God. You know, it's it's kind
[2:41:07] of funny, but even as a Christian, it's
[2:41:10] kind of hard being certain of God cuz uh
[2:41:13] this this world just it attacks you from
[2:41:16] left and right and and from straight
[2:41:18] away, you know. Uh um God found me at my
[2:41:22] lowest point. I was uh I was at college
[2:41:25] in a dorm room in a bathroom and and I
[2:41:29] knew I had something more for me than a
[2:41:32] life like that. And um he told me, you
[2:41:36] know, that that you you are you are
[2:41:38] worth so much more than this. And you
[2:41:42] know, some of you may know me. I I I
[2:41:44] I've
[2:41:45] I've received my new birth in 2010. And
[2:41:48] and even though it's still hard today, I
[2:41:51] know that these chains here, they don't
[2:41:53] bind me because God God is with me. God
[2:41:56] is God is everything to me. And and and
[2:41:59] he can be everything to you. You know,
[2:42:01] uh
[2:42:02] um we we we should be the happiest
[2:42:05] people on on the face of the earth
[2:42:07] because he's given us everything. And I
[2:42:09] just want to let you guys know
[2:42:11] that today or tomorrow, it could be your
[2:42:14] day. It doesn't have to be, you know, a
[2:42:17] a
[2:42:18] a message or or or or a brother coming
[2:42:21] up and speaking to you. You know, you
[2:42:23] just have to have that personal
[2:42:24] relationship with him. Pray to him and
[2:42:26] and he'll give you everything that your
[2:42:28] heart desires. Thank you.
[2:42:31] [Applause]
[2:42:36] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[2:42:37] praise this evening. Let's really just
[2:42:39] let him have praise. Hallelujah.
[2:42:42] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:42:45] Somebody say amen.
[2:42:47] Have you enjoyed yourself this evening?
[2:42:49] Can you just say amen? Thank you, Jesus.
[2:42:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not going to
[2:42:55] apologize.
[2:42:58] But if you need to forgive me, I I pray
[2:42:59] that you
[2:43:02] would when our brother was worship
[2:43:04] leading worship a little
[2:43:07] earlier. I wasn't drawn to brother
[2:43:09] Joseph. I was drawn to the presence of
[2:43:11] God.
[2:43:15] Can we say amen? Amen. People go out to
[2:43:17] rap concerts and rock
[2:43:20] concerts and they all rush the stage,
[2:43:22] you know,
[2:43:24] and they want the guy who's singing to
[2:43:25] touch their
[2:43:28] hand. But in a church setting, we all
[2:43:30] stay in our seats like we don't know
[2:43:31] what we're
[2:43:32] doing. That man's anointed,
[2:43:35] and I wanted some of that anointing. Can
[2:43:37] you say amen?
[2:43:40] So I I had I wanted to not touch you,
[2:43:42] but I wanted to be in that
[2:43:46] presence. And as I was watching the
[2:43:50] plane before they got to the part where
[2:43:52] the young
[2:43:55] lady was trying to touch uh
[2:43:59] Jesus, I started to repeat out
[2:44:02] loud, touching Jesus, touching Jesus,
[2:44:05] touching Jesus. My wife said, "What?
[2:44:08] Okay. I said, "Touching Jesus. Something
[2:44:10] about touching Jesus."
[2:44:12] And then they begin to pull off that
[2:44:14] drama. I didn't know.
[2:44:17] And the
[2:44:19] intensity of of the actors. Can you say
[2:44:21] amen?
[2:44:23] But see, to me, I don't know who the
[2:44:25] girl
[2:44:26] was, but to me, she wasn't acting.
[2:44:30] Come on, somebody. It's it's it might
[2:44:33] just be a drama drama, but there's
[2:44:36] something down on the inside inside.
[2:44:39] Each and every one of you have at one
[2:44:43] time either have been
[2:44:45] there or you are there. Can you say
[2:44:49] amen? The quieter the amens, the know
[2:44:52] the the way I know you're on to
[2:44:54] something, right?
[2:44:58] And so when Jesus began to come down the
[2:45:00] the via de la roa
[2:45:04] I got caught up into the the the drama
[2:45:08] drama. I wanted to run out and grab the
[2:45:10] cross of
[2:45:13] Jesus. When he walked my way, I reached
[2:45:15] out and I touched
[2:45:18] him. And the brother was crying real
[2:45:20] tears. Real
[2:45:23] tears. And and when we came to the
[2:45:26] back, he said he kept
[2:45:29] thinking, "Why am I carrying this
[2:45:32] cross when Jesus said take up your cross
[2:45:35] and follow me?"
[2:45:38] But that's not the cross Brother Bernie
[2:45:40] was trying to
[2:45:42] portray. I
[2:45:44] believe I believe when he said, "Why am
[2:45:46] I carrying this
[2:45:48] cross?" He was right. He was right
[2:45:52] because we're supposed to give our cross
[2:45:54] back to
[2:45:55] Jesus. How many knows it's true? He died
[2:45:59] for you. He died for you. He died for
[2:46:03] you. He died for you so that you
[2:46:06] wouldn't have to
[2:46:08] die. Can you say amen?
[2:46:11] And these young people, I've asked them
[2:46:14] to stay up
[2:46:16] here because they're giving their
[2:46:18] testimony.
[2:46:20] Listen, I'm not perfect.
[2:46:23] I'm going to fail you. I'm going to fail
[2:46:26] you. Brother Mike will fail you. Junior,
[2:46:29] we'll fail each other. I'll do something
[2:46:33] stupid. I will fail you.
[2:46:36] But there is one person here
[2:46:39] tonight and he'll never leave
[2:46:41] you. He'll never forsake you. He'll
[2:46:45] never fail you, but he'll be with you.
[2:46:48] Even
[2:46:52] even. Can you say amen? Amen. So these
[2:46:55] young people,
[2:46:57] they're giving their
[2:46:59] testimonies. But many times when you
[2:47:02] give your
[2:47:03] testimony, and you forgive me if I say
[2:47:05] something
[2:47:06] wrong, but many times when you give your
[2:47:09] testimony, you're still not quite
[2:47:13] there. But giving your
[2:47:16] testimony allows you to put
[2:47:20] power, allows you to put power.
[2:47:26] There's power. Power in the blood of
[2:47:28] Christ. It allows you to put
[2:47:30] power behind your
[2:47:33] testimony. The power is Jesus
[2:47:36] Christ. I cannot save
[2:47:39] you. Save you. Nobody in this room can
[2:47:42] save
[2:47:43] you. Touching Jesus is all that
[2:47:48] [Music]
[2:47:49] matters. Touching Jesus.
[2:47:52] Just touching Jesus.
[2:47:54] Just that easy. Just touching Jesus.
[2:47:57] Just touching Jesus. Just touching Jesus
[2:47:59] is all that matters. That's all that
[2:48:01] matters. And
[2:48:03] tonight, if you can't touch, if you
[2:48:07] can't see Jesus
[2:48:09] tonight, then why don't you all just
[2:48:11] stand up for a
[2:48:12] moment? And if you believe the one next
[2:48:15] to
[2:48:16] you has got the Holy
[2:48:19] Ghost, then why don't you reach out and
[2:48:21] touch
[2:48:23] Jesus? must reach out and touch
[2:48:27] him. Our whole life will never be the
[2:48:31] same. There is only one way to touch
[2:48:35] him and that's to believe when you call
[2:48:40] on power in the
[2:48:43] [Music]
[2:48:45] name. Oh, there is
[2:48:51] power. Come on, reach out tonight.

[2:56:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:56:07] Thank you, Jesus. But I know these
[2:56:09] people. I know I love these
[2:56:12] people. I can

[2:56:17] follow the leading of the Holy
[2:56:20] [Music]
[2:56:26] Ghost. Liberty is a choice.
[2:56:31] Self forgiveness is a
[2:56:34] choice. Self
[2:56:37] [Music]
[2:56:38] choice. Forgiveness is a self-choice.
[2:56:43] [Music]
[2:56:45] It's just a
[2:56:47] choice. Faith in
[2:56:50] God is not a sensation.
[2:56:53] It's not an emotion.
[2:56:56] It's simply a choice.
[2:57:00] Now, Phoenix Tabernacle,
[2:57:02] if anybody knows who we are,
[2:57:06] it's us.
[2:57:08] We have been to hell and packed
[2:57:12] and you as well as I
[2:57:15] know that we're not going to make
[2:57:17] it without Jesus
[2:57:20] Christ, without having mercy one for the
[2:57:24] other, forgiving one another.
[2:57:28] So for just a
[2:57:29] moment, let's all get together in one
[2:57:34] mind and cry out for the Holy
[2:57:37] Ghost because it's the only thing we
[2:57:40] need. That's all we
[2:57:42] need. We get the Holy
[2:57:44] Ghost. We get it
[2:57:47] all. We get the Holy Ghost.
[2:58:04] the Holy Ghost for me.
[2:58:07] You promised that promise and it's mine.
[2:58:12] Tonight I accept it.
[2:58:15] Can you believe it?
[2:58:16] [Applause]
[2:58:21] Believe and never doubt again.

[3:01:04] This is a sign. You got a nap in your
