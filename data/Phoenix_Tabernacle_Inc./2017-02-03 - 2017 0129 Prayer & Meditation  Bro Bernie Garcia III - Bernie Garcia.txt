to hear praises to the Lord from our children and tonight um as we continue our series of sequential experts from the series of books called Supernatural the life of William brandham this is our second installment in 2017 where still in book two the young man in his desperation 1933 to 1946 this particular chapter we're starting new tonight the title is killer Bull and though a lot of us may know or remember the story this chapter gave me several very pleasant surprises as I read it because it had been some time since I had read it before tonight uh it's a very special privilege to present this work that was done by our brother Owen jurgenson um there are a lot of things happening in the world today political events are swirling around us we see protests and and all kinds of things happening in the geopolitical sense all around the world well the same very same thing was happening at the beginning of this chapter uh this is the largest jump in time we'll take probably for the rest of the series the last chapter was uh was the one on hurricane Mountain lost on Hurricane Mountain in in the snowstorm that was 1941 well tonight we suddenly jumped to 1945 and so one thing I would say about this chapter in a general perspective no matter what's going on around us in the world today and this applies to our children and and and us that are young at heart as well no matter how many things are changing and how the world and circumstances seem to us we need to keep our minds focused on the Lord Jesus Christ because Divine love wins overall and our Lord Jesus Christ imparts that to our hearts our Prophet Willam Mary and brandham received a very special Revelation in this chapter that was one of the present surprises that I encountered when I reread it and so as we'll get started here the devastating war in Europe was grinding to its end and with the German Army being squeezed hard from two sides by Allied Forces in January of 1945 the Russian army led by General zukov pierced to the Odair River just 40 Mi east of Berlin soon after after the Russian mechanicz divisions gumed to a halt in a bog of spring mud and stiff German resistance at the same time the Western allies were making good progress through France and Belgium with the Americans having penetrated farthest into German held territory early in March General Patton's thirdd Army reached the Ryan River at cin a few days later General hajes first Army seized a bridge farther Downstream at ragen the American generals longed to keep going so they could beat the Russians to Berlin but they were ordered to wait for General Montgomery's 25 British divisions to catch up by April 25th the Russians had not only encircled Berlin but they had also met up with the American forces on the Elba River 45 miles to the West at the same time German defenses in Italy collapsed allowing their Western allies to advance rapidly North up the Italian boot on April 28th the Italian dictator bito musolini was caught and executed by his own people as he tried to flee from the advancing allies fascism now laid dead as a world political force and Nazism was breathing its last communism on the other hand was kicking and stretching and gobbling up everything within reach as Communists and Nazis battled in the streets of Berlin Hitler appointed one of his AIDS Carl donet as head of the German State then on April 30th Adolf Hitler quietly disappeared from the face of the Earth donet immediately began the process of unilateral surrender which was officially completed on May 8th 1945 the war in Europe was over in the face of these momentous world events William brandham could only watch in Marvel for they meant that of the seven visions of the future he had seen in a row on that June morning in 1933 three of them had now happened literally musolini had died in disgrace Hitler had come to a mysterious end and communism was growing stronger as a dominant political force no doubt the other four Visions would follow in God's Own time this gave Bill a reason to be optimistic about his personal future surely the Lord must have a specific purpose for his life or else why would the almighty bestow on him such an unusual gift Bill needed all the fuel he could find to keep the small fire of his optimism burning because in the natural he could see no way that he could ever dig himself out of his poverty far enough to accomplish anything great for the kingdom of God he still worked his three jobs two without pay even though he always seemed short of cash he never considered taking any money for his Services as Pastor he had several reasons for this first from reading his Bible and from watching ministers around him he recognized early in his ministry that the love of money could be one of the deadliest traps a minister would ever face and Bill intended to avoid it secondly although some members of his congregation were making as much as $3 an hour most members were as poor as or poorer than he was and Bill could not bring himself to ask these poor people to sacrifice any more than they already were he did preach the biblical principle of tithing and every member put a tenth of their income into a box kept in the back of the church specifically for that purpose but Bill didn't use a penny of this money for himself it all went toward the monthly loan payments just barely enough left over for upkeep on the building his third reason carried a touch of Pride and self-reliance since he was strong and able to work he thought why not work one payday afternoon Bill and Ma budgeted out his weekly $28 paycheck from his job at Public Service Indiana his own tithes came out first then ma pointed out the bills that absolutely had to have a payment no matter how they divided their remaining $25.20 they simply could not make it cover all of their immediate obligations they lacked about $10 bill held up a letter and said honey we can't even start to pay this one but we've got to pay it she said oh Bill what are we going to do Bill had an idea you know what tonight at church I'm going to take up an offering made's initial surprise melted into Amusement I'm going to enjoy watching you try that night after the song service and before he preached Bill said all right friends tonight now I hate to ask you for this made a g him a comical look knowing how uncomfortable he felt Bill tried to keep from looking at her as he stumbled around for words I never did this before it's these hard times you know and can't hardly make ends meet if you all got a nickel or a dime you would like to drop in my hat as it's passed around brother weart would you come and take my hat Deacon weart came forward looking as puzzled as everyone else not because he didn't love his Pastor he did they all did and they were certainly willing to help bill in any way they could they were surprised because in the past 12 years this had never happened before brother weart passed a hat down along the first Pew Bill watched as Mrs Weber reached down in a pocket on her checkered apron and pulled out a little snap top coin purse when she fished out a nickel Bill's heart sank like the lead weight on a fishing line dropping into the muck at the bottom of a pond he knew these were tough times for almost everyone not just him he couldn't do it wait a minute sister Weber you don't need to put that Nickel in there I didn't really mean it I was just teasing you all to see what you would do now old Deacon weart felt more perplexed than ever he asked brother brandom what should I do just put my hat back brother weart I'm going on with the service ma covered her mouth with her hand and shook her head bill could tell by her that she was laughing John Ryan Bill's old friend from up North had been in Jeffersonville that week visiting around the gutsy old man had pedal a beat up bicycle all the way from Michigan some 250 Mi but the bicycle had given him so much trouble along the way he decided to abandon it and hitchhike back home with characteristic generosity John Ryan gave the bicycle to Bill who promptly repaired it and spruced it up with a 10-cent can of paint Bill didn't really need a bicycle himself but he thought he might be able to sell it to get the extra money he needed Bill's second unpaid job that of an Indiana State game warden coincided too closely with his work for the Public Service Company that he rarely considered it any extra effort that was fortunate because his work as a lineman was strenuous enough for two jobs one of his main task for public service Indiana was patrolling the high voltage transmission lines that stretch for hundreds of miles through the the rugged Indiana Backwoods much of this distance had no roads nearby so Bill often found himself on foot hiking 30 m a day 6 days a week all for just 60 cents an hour still there were other rewards besides money the job got him out of town and Into the Wilderness that he loved occasionally through his capacity as game warden he could help a poacher reform and so protect the local Wildlife then too he would always stop and chat with Farmers working in their Fields invariably the subject came around to God and Bill would get a chance to share with them the love of Jesus Christ sometimes a farmer would mellow and give his heart to Jesus immediately bill would take him down to the nearest Creek and baptize him in the name of the Lord with clothes dripping wet the two would part company both of them rejoicing as they went back to their respective task one afternoon Bill was up near Henryville Indiana releasing some fish into to a creek for the fishing game department he was close to the farm of a friend of his who was sick so Bill thought it would be nice if he stopped in and prayed for the man since the farm was just across a few fences Bill didn't bother driving around on the roads unbuckling his holster he tossed his gun onto the front seat of his truck shut the door and climbed the First Fence forgetting there was a sign at Each corner of the pastor warning danger beware PR of bull Bill hummed a Christian hym as he strolled across the grassy field in the middle of the pasture stood a small patch of scrub Oaks spindly little trees averaging 10 ft High bill was approaching these when suddenly the huge bull stood up and snorted it had been lying quietly in the shade of the gnarled Oak branches out of sight until just then instantly Bill recognized his Peril for this particular gy bull had a far-flung reputation it had been a prized breeder on the Burke farm near Jeffersonville but had always displayed an ordinary temperament and finally had gored its caretaker to death forcing its owner to get rid of it since it was such a prize bull Burke had sold it to this man up at Henryville hoping that the isolated Countryside would allow it no more opportunities for Mischief Bill had known about this but it had just slipped his mind now he desperately sized up his chances the scrub Oaks were too flims in in the wrong direction the fences were too far away that left his gun he might have to shoot the animal and then pay the farmer for his loss the killer bull dropped his head snorted and pawed the ground its long pointed horns did indeed look like the lethal weapons they were Bill reached for his gun it wasn't there then he remembered he had left his holster on the seat of his truck well Lord if the time has come for me to die I want to face it like a man he straightened his shoulders and looked coolly at his foe at that moment something incredible happened inside of him his fear evaporated replaced by a love born of sympathy and understanding unlike anything he had ever experienced before he thought that poor bull was lying out here in the field and I came along and Disturbed him he doesn't know anything different than to protect himself the bull snorted harder and faster scraping the ground with its hook throwing dirt behind it as bulls do before a charge Bill said out loud bull I'm sorry that I Disturbed you I don't want you to kill me I am the servant of God and I'm on my way to pray for a sick man I forgot about those signs the bull charged head down with curv horns pointing dead on target amazingly Bill felt absolutely no fear only love he said in the name of Jesus Christ go over and lay down under those trees the bull continued charging with all its muscle and fury when it was only 10 ft away it threw out its front legs and stopped in a cloud of dust the strang's expression crossed its face as it swung its head to the right then back to the left then the animal turned around and showed Bill its tail it walked slowly back to the scrub Oaks lay down and watched as Bill strolled the rest of the way across the pasture for the rest of the day and many other days Bill marveled at what had happened in that pasture between him and that bull in the face of almost certain death he had somehow stepped Beyond his own concerns to feel the heartbeat of another life somehow he had understood the Bull's agitation and had sympathize with the animal as a pastor he often extended himself to others caring and helping wherever he could but this experience was something different something deeper for a few minutes in his life all fear had vanished and he had felt perfect love God bless you [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] me man [Music] Mee [Music] fore [Music] [Music] me me man problem [Music] go me for [Music] [Music] God bless you if you could all

amen now can you just take a few words to put that down to a kids level share of scripture well it's like this listen guys let's listen I'm a little older now as you can tell by my mustache amen but when I was a little child just like you when I needed something from my parents I would go and talk to them and now that I'm a little bit older I re recognize and I realize that God is our heavenly father amen how many believe that God is your heavenly father raise your hand amen then if you believe that God is is your heavenly father then we can go and talk to him amen and when we talk to him and we have conversations with him we ask him the things that we have need of Amen just like when we talk to our parents do you understand that now many times I will stop in the mornings after I have my cup of coffee of course and I will sit and meditate how I meditate is I close my eyes and I focus I focus because I have a lot of interruptions and I focus my thoughts and I begin to think about all the goodness of God and all of his blessings and everything he's given me and as I begin to meditate on these things from deep inside my heart something begins to say thank you Father thank you for life thank you for this warm home and then I just begin to have a conversation with him so that's how I do it so one thing oh were you going to say something down I was going to say that's great Sheriff thank you is it one thing that I liked from that is he said when he meditates he stays quiet and he thinks he thinks on the goodness of God Amen wow so that means you you don't really talk you're not doing um the he's not doing none of that he's sitting and he's thinking on the goodness of God yes amen yes Dante kind of kind of like this sitting closing your eyes and just being still thank you God can we practice that okay let's all just sit like Dante and sherff scripture let's try to be as quiet as we can let's see if we can do it for for 10 seconds that's our goal can can I add something yes sir can can I'm going to ask you to put your hands over your heart both hands over your heart both hands let's put both hands and close your eyes and remember that God our Father is
