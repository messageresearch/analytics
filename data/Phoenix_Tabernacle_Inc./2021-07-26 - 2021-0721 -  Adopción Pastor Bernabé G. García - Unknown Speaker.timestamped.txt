[5:48] listening to the introduction of the
[5:50] series of messages of adoption
[5:58] this message was preached on august 22nd
[6:01] of the year 1976
[6:18] is
[6:28] the reading and the feeling of the word
[6:32] amen
[7:29] if foreign be ye are in heaviness
[7:32] through
[7:33] many full temptations
[7:53] that the trial of your faith being much
[7:56] more precious than of gold that perishes
[7:58] though it be tried with fire might be
[8:01] found unto praise and honor and glory of
[8:03] the appearing of jesus christ
[8:09] [Music]
[8:10] amen
[8:12] welcome each and every one of you

[8:23] us tonight
[8:29] [Music]
[9:04] i want each and every one of you to feel
[9:07] loose and
[9:08] free and lower tonight
[9:11] [Music]
[9:15] this morning we took uh a very long time
[9:18] in the sermon
[9:19] it was here for knowledge and in reality
[9:23] i didn't get
[9:24] time to finish the sermon
[9:31] i just closed the sermon because i could
[9:33] see that the people were
[9:35] firing very much
[9:38] because of the heat
[9:44] and tonight i'm going to be very short
[9:46] in what i'm going to speak
[9:47] my whatever was either
[9:52] [Music]
[9:58] so the subject i'm going to speak on
[10:00] tonight is adoption
[10:10] it is going to be at the beginning of a
[10:11] series of sermons
[10:13] by the name of adoption and congruent
[10:25] in conjunction with this scene that
[10:27] we're going to speak tonight
[10:28] we're going to take the recognizing your
[10:31] position
[10:36] now i want everyone to uh watch
[10:39] yourselves tonight
[10:46] every thought that i am speaking on i
[10:48] want you to know note it down and write
[10:50] it down
[10:53] in your mind and in your heart
[11:01] the thing that we desire most is to be
[11:04] adopted
[11:11] all christianity speaks of adoptions
[11:20] we know that there comes to being in the
[11:26] resurrection
[11:34] we may be found there we have to know
[11:36] what
[11:38] everything that brother bran spoke on
[11:40] adoption
[11:54] speaking a little bit on every verse
[12:02] we have read first peter first chapter
[12:05] six and seventh verse
[12:08] now considered
[12:16] [Music]
[12:23] you cannot be raptured except first you
[12:26] recognize your position
[12:34] after you recognize your position then
[12:36] you have
[12:52] after you have said your faith has to be
[12:54] tried
[12:59] no notice
[13:03] here on earth according to the position
[13:07] that you have
[13:09] that will be your faith
[13:17] and you must be tried according to your
[13:19] positions
[13:24] you won't be tried for the position that
[13:27] someone else may hold
[13:29] for el santa
[13:34] because he has another faith different
[13:36] than yours
[13:40] do you notice immediately
[13:46] examined you notice right away that you
[13:51] can't examine yourself by examining
[13:53] somebody else
[13:57] [Music]
[13:58] because the position of that person is
[14:03] [Music]
[14:09] [Music]
[14:24] [Music]
[14:38] [Music]
[14:57] that the heir as long as he's a child
[15:00] delivers
[15:01] differs nothing from a servant so he
[15:05] be lord of all god
[15:24] even so we when we were children were in
[15:27] bondage
[15:28] under the elements of the world
[15:38] but when the fullness of the time was
[15:40] come god sent forth a son
[15:43] made of a woman made under the law
[15:52] beyond to redeem that they were under
[15:56] the law
[15:57] that we might receive the adoptions
[15:59] adoption of sons
[16:02] [Music]
[16:11] and because your son god has sent forth
[16:14] the spirit
[16:15] of the son into your hearts crime of the
[16:19] father
[16:20] our
[16:38] you begin to receive instructions to
[16:41] prepare you for the adoption
[16:45] when a child is born
[16:51] [Music]
[17:00] [Music]
[17:06] [Music]
[17:16] to follow
[17:30] spiritually
[17:40] [Music]
[17:56] we have to recognize that it is a voice
[17:59] of god speaking
[18:02] and when he does call us
[18:07] he begins to instruct us
[18:12] to
[18:39] it is necessary to follow every
[18:41] instruction
[18:46] [Music]
[18:48] people like to hear we're going to be
[18:51] adopted
[18:54] in
[19:00] [Music]
[19:07] now we see that the scripture speaks
[19:30] [Music]
[19:33] just like our children when they were
[19:36] born
[19:40] [Music]
[19:57] [Music]
[20:07] [Music]
[20:31] then it is time to start
[20:48] [Music]
[20:59] [Music]
[21:13] himself in a way that he knows how to
[21:15] lead himself
[21:24] so is it in the spirit
[21:42] um
[21:46] [Music]
[22:10] um
[22:32] [Music]
[22:38] [Music]
[22:55] [Music]
[23:08] [Music]
[23:21] [Music]
[23:45] [Music]
[23:48] the
[24:11] [Music]
[24:38] because the instructions of the bible
[24:40] are not followed
[24:43] of the father
[24:59] [Music]
[25:12] thought como there is how
[25:16] it should work
[25:19] [Music]
[25:26] it is not because of lack of instruction
[25:32] it is necessary to teach young people
[25:34] have to have a heart
[25:36] to work
[25:39] before they want to get married
[26:02] [Music]
[26:22] after
[26:43] [Music]
[26:50] is
[27:02] [Music]
[27:18] give her all
[27:32] of utmost importance that you have
[27:34] instructions
[27:37] on occasions
[27:41] we have might have 10 years in the
[27:42] message
[27:46] i'm not referring to the churches
[27:49] i'm referring to ourselves yes i know
[27:53] we have 10 years
[28:00] still doesn't know how
[28:12] [Music]
[28:27] she doesn't know how to act
[28:57] it's a monster tylenol
[29:08] for another animal so that we
[29:38] is
[29:52] woman now the man
[29:58] also has his instructions
[30:01] now we're going to reverse the situation
[30:06] because
[30:47] but now he doesn't have a job
[31:01] it is necessary
[31:31] fifth chapter
[31:36] i only gave two or three illustrations
[31:40] uh it's like the young people saying
[31:48] [Music]
[32:11] a bunch of people that are undressed
[32:14] properly
[32:17] they're talking about i'm spiritually
[32:19] speaking now
[32:22] now we have the instructions that's the
[32:25] prophet
[32:36] [Music]
[32:54] [Music]
[33:18] [Music]
[33:22] determination
[33:32] [Music]
[33:35] the people don't want to hear
[33:49] [Music]
[33:50] faithful
[34:04] second and third verse
[34:15] [Music]
[34:19] not only so but we glory in tribulations
[34:22] also
[34:23] knowing that tribulation orchestrations
[34:27] [Music]
[34:31] and patients experience
[34:42] [Music]
[34:46] because the love of god is shared abroad
[34:49] in our hearts for the holy ghost which
[34:51] is given
[34:51] to us
[34:57] what i'm telling you tonight is what has
[34:59] structured from the
[35:00] from the scriptures
[35:12] that is the reason many people do not
[35:14] have patience
[35:16] [Music]
[35:23] [Music]
[35:28] is
[35:42] [Music]
[36:13] [Music]
[36:23] [Music]
[36:42] [Music]
[37:01] [Music]
[37:06] so
[37:10] [Music]
[37:20] it is a true story
[37:26] [Music]
[37:28] that in every service he would get up to
[37:30] testify
[37:34] and he would ask for mercy it is here
[37:36] and he will say
[37:37] hermanos uh brothers pray for me
[37:43] [Music]
[37:44] because the devil was after me
[37:48] in the next
[38:16] foreign
[38:26] [Music]
[39:12] and he went out again
[39:32] [Music]

[41:04] foreign
[41:25] [Music]
[41:31] recognizing our position all right now
[41:35] now there's a lot the second verse is
[41:38] the first chapter of games
[41:50] [Music]
[41:56] in other words every time you fall into
[41:58] temptation
[42:00] that they know
[42:11] [Music]
[42:15] joy when you fall into the darkest
[42:16] temptations
[42:21] knowing this just finally fake workers
