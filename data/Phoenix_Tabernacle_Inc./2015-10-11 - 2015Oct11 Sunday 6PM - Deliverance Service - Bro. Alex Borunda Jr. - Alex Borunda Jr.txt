normally do I don't know I can't see you that far right now she's here okay [Music] Okay I uh we we have a we have a couple of speakers for you this this evening they don't know it until this I'd like to ask sister Juanita to come in and she's going to give us a little short testimony I'm gonna be the timekeeper is going to be for five minutes when I say five minutes it's five minutes and if they don't get out in five minutes I'm going to get one of the deacons to to pull them out yeah I I will do it you know brother randam says that the bride has a ministry that's men and women could U I think one of the mics are working God bless you you got five minutes five minutes okay um first of all I had a feeling he was going to do that he didn't warn me about this so I was just thinking to myself what what should I give um he well God gave me a little bit I mean a lot of you heard my testimony before I'm just gonna just give a tiny bit of that and then say what God is doing for me it's it's been about nine years um since uh God has touched my life um I have to two kids and uh during that time um after you know I got baptized um it's been rough um but um God is very faithful um sometimes I don't know um why I'm still standing um but it's by the grace of God um I prayed for my kids um and God has shown me that's that's my mission he's given me everything and I I pray for my kids that they receive the same steps that I've gone [Music] through I don't want them to receive anything less um through this time I know it's it's been a battle but God but through God's grace and mercy I'm still standing here um I'm free from drugs I don't I don't do any of that stuff anymore alcohol I I thank God for that and I'm trusting and standing on his word that God is going to fulfill his promises in my kids' lives um that is my desire and that's the restoration that I know that I'm waiting for I thank God for that one more minute use it one more minute I'll pick up the slack for her she downplays her her testimony and before the Lord touched me he touched her and then she began to pray for me and she turned to her mama and she goes don't worry about a step I said God's going to get him and and sure enough when I was out in the streets um at this time I was already I've been a drug guy for 15 years um first uh just like any of you guys any of the kids those that remember me I used to carry my dad's briefcase I used to take notes I was y High and and As I Grew I took a wrong turn and you know one thing led to another you know 15 years later um I'm Downing out I'm a gang member you know in search of things that that I could could not quench they didn't understand why I made these turns but I made them and I and when I look down in my life uh I used to wonder if there was a way back and uh while when when started praying for me I didn't know she was praying for me but when things started to happen as I began to go to these these drug houses uh and when they used to start seeing me come they would look at me Shut the doors or turn a different direction and take off running and I was wondering why they would start to do that and then one day I met with Wanita she had an experience here in church God made her a real lady made her a real lady is the same power to transform me and and I went to her and I said Wanita the doctor say I need to take medication uh I had post-traumatic syndrome I was I I didn't want to diagnos myself but I'm sure I was pretty insane you know I was left to die in a parking lot shot and bleeding out and God used Satan to put me on my back he broke my leg severed arteries and and all along what he was doing was to do that to put me on my back I could look nowhere and I couldn't run so the only way I could look was look up and I didn't understand God was calling me uh a lot of us ignore our call but when I went to Wanita I said Wanita I've been smoking cigarettes for 15 years I smoke camel Palo menal every brand you could think of tried to calm my nerves tried to get that satisfaction I was a marijuano I was a methan fine addict I if it could be smoked I smoked it if it could be inhaled I inhaled it

whatever but God is real God listens to your your prayer and he's watching did you know that okay we read the scripture and and and I like to tell you why you sometimes and me okay in my confession here comes I was at brother montoya's church and we had a con I think it was a convention that they had or brother Caleb or one of the brothers was there he the ministry stand up and pray for the uh uh just to pray and then we went forward and and then says well tell your brother that you love them Ministry I said whoa that was a hard one did you listen to what I just said did you listen to what I said the minister to minister that Min Min because they have discernment they have discernment I'm sorry and they know the Bible they know who you know they know what's going on so I went and told one of the brothers so I'm not going to tell you sister Marie who it was but it was Mark Mark brother God bless you that's all right brother I know how things are go told another brother I told another brother I'm making my confession I told another brother I think it was from California God bless you brother but that's okay I was just like you wor did you hear what I just said that was that that's my confession now I'm a hypocrite I was hypocritical I did not empty out if you don't understand what I'm talking about what I'm talking about we live as Christians but with reservations like a big chief Indian reservations we have our plot we have our land this is this is our reservation people get angry I'm sorry but you know I'm Indian too but we and this is what happened the very next day I turned the computer on [Music] CPU my central processing unit which you have go you hypocrite oh man you you think you're real smart Alex you you were right you were right yeah they patronized you yeah but there's a clip side to this you did it with reservation what are you talking about you so to those brothers that are hearing me in the internet ibly apologize to you and I'm sorry and and I don't blame if you don't like me and and uh I don't like myself yeah but uh but uh and I understand that we have to love ourselves I understand all that but the things what what I'm trying to say I'm confessing to you and uh and that's something sometimes we get in the way we the ministry we the people in the benches the Deacons we get in the way we impede the holy ghost from working on a sinner person okay now the thing is is we have to live Godly and and we we have to get rid of our garbage brother brother Mike I'm pecking back in what brother Mike preached yesterday last Sunday and he he had a backpack and then he'd call it sins and he he put it over there and and it was so good you know we need to leave our burdens down our baggage what think negative thoughts of our brother we need to empty out the Lord told me yes you said the right thing do you understand what I just said you discern the right thing you know the right thing wrong yeah and you do it with reservations a reservation and my definition is it's something that you're keeping back with withholding a setting apart it's keeping keeping back making an exception or qualification an exception with tact to accept something but with inner reservations so brother Alex so brother Alex is not a real nice guy so I made my confession would you forgive me if I thought about if I have thought that about you at one time or another Revelation 15 we read and brother Bram said the Bible the Bible reads we read the scripture right SC okay brother Bram said in the revelation of Jesus Christ in paragraph 232 the word washed they're actually actually in the Greek means loose I was going to take my belt but I don't think that's a very good idea but you you you lose do you understand loose I have my shoelaces and I can untie them and they will become loose now brother Ram says he loosed us from our we were tied to the Earth by our sin okay very good very good our sin one okay we couldn't see we couldn't hear had no conception of Heaven Or Nothing when blood came down cut the line and we got got loose we got loose this is a Deliverance service and I believe without a shadow of doubt you are loose from every bad thing that you've ever done if that isn't so then Jesus Christ did not die on the cross and shed the the blood and came back with the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ came to save you we said it a lot of times not only did he save us he healed us he did it for a dual purpose for our salvation and for our healing tonight those of you that want healing can receive your healing those of you that
