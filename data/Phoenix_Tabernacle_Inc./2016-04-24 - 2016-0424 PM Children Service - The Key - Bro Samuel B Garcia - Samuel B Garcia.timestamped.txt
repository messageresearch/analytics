[30:32] which hope passed but We are so thankful
[30:36] that the lord gave brother Brandon and

[30:43] Destiny That's quite a test as brother
[30:46] Brandon I'm sure felt at the time
[30:49] however there were more tests to come
[30:53] and so We Will Start Tonight chapter 22
[30:58] first part of that chapter entitled the
[31:01] most treacherous moment of his Life
[31:08] 1937 ella Branham urged her son to Stay
[31:11] with her that First night after hope's
[31:13] Death She knew his children were Being
[31:16] watched by mrs broy but ella didn't want
[31:18] Bill to be Alone Bill said no he Wanted
[31:21] to go home even though there wasn't much
[31:24] there $10 would have bought everything
[31:26] in both rooms Still Still The little
[31:28] House was their House hope Had kept it
[31:32] Clean She Had touched it with her Love
[31:34] and Had transformed it from a cramped
[31:36] ordinary Rental unit into a warm
[31:38] inviting Home as soon as Bill walked
[31:41] through his front door he knew he Had
[31:43] made a mistake the Place Had no welcome
[31:46] no Life No Power to cheer Walking into
[31:50] the bedroom he looked on top of the
[31:52] folding Bed there underneath the
[31:55] newspaper laid The envelope Hope Had
[31:57] mentioned
[31:58] Bill dumped the nickels and dimes out on
[32:00] the Bed spread And countered them they
[32:02] totaled
[32:04] $280 Just 20 short of the down payment
[32:07] needed for that 22 Caliber rifle he Had
[32:10] been wanting for over a year Bill
[32:13] determined his Heart to put this Money
[32:15] down on that rifle and in spite of
[32:17] hundreds of Dollars in Medical Bills he
[32:20] owed he vowed he would make the monthly
[32:22] payments on that rifle until he owned it
[32:25] free and Clear in a Memory of his
[32:28] devoted wife he lay down on the Bed
[32:31] longing to escape into sleep a Mouse Had
[32:34] Found its way into The kitchen stove and
[32:36] rustled some kindling paper in the
[32:38] grates it sounded to Bill like hope
[32:41] Opening the wrappers of some Candy She
[32:43] Had kept up On A kitchen shelf he got up
[32:46] and Shut the kitchen door with his Foot
[32:48] there hung h's kono On A Hook behind the
[32:51] door now he realized he should have gone
[32:54] to his mother's House Everything here

[32:58] reminding him of his wife stretched out
[33:00] in the mor Bill buried his wet cheeks in
[33:03] the mattress and unleashed his

[35:10] way down to the basement Sharon Rose lay
[35:13] in a crib whimpering and jerking with
[35:15] muscle spasms a length of cheese cloth
[35:18] Had been draped over her Body as a

[35:23] net but her kicking and twisting Had
[35:26] pulled It Off and Now to eyes Suck the
[35:28] moisture from around her eyes Bill shwed
[35:31] the flies away and repositioned the

[36:23] between Sharon and himself he Had seen
[36:26] the same Thing praying for hope Last
[36:28] Christmas he knew that God Had refused
[36:31] his Prayer that Instant Was the most

[1:14:55] tomaron la
[1:14:59] llave había un
[1:15:02] hombre que podía escribir libros de de

[1:15:10] de
[1:15:11] [Música]
[1:15:12] cómico y fue con alguien en Kansas City
[1:15:16] en la ciudad de
[1:15:18] Kansas y le mostró su
[1:15:23] trabajo el hombre Lo miró
[1:15:29] no eso no está
[1:15:32] bien y el hombre se
[1:15:35] desanimó trabaj en otra
[1:15:38] vez y otra
[1:15:42] vez lo
[1:15:45] di edita el
[1:15:53] trabajo está muy muy
[1:15:56] bien pero no él no se quedó
[1:16:02] allí pero él agarró una una un poco una
[1:16:06] porción pequeña del
[1:16:09] cómico de la
[1:16:13] iglesia y él rentó ese
[1:16:18] garaje que tenía un montón de ratas y
[1:16:21] ahí
[1:16:26] y empezó a mirar las
[1:16:30] ratas su curiosidad se empezó a levantar
[1:16:34] en
[1:16:37] él inventó un
[1:16:41] cómico y le nombró Mickey
[1:16:45] Mouse pueden creer
[1:16:49] ello han escuchado lugar disy
[1:16:55] del mundo de

[1:17:30] personajes y é tenía una
[1:17:32] llave que no que se quería deshacer de
[1:17:37] ella y algo d ahí se
[1:17:41] encendió y el hombre es muy
[1:17:46] exitoso si usted tiene una
[1:17:49] llave si usted tiene una llave
[1:17:55] Y si usted piensa que esa llave es
[1:18:01] importante usted piensa que va a haber
[1:18:03] algo importante detrás de esa
[1:18:07] puerta quizás un
[1:18:11] tesoro usted no hubiera encerrado
[1:18:15] basura imagínes si usted tiene un cuarto
[1:18:19] y Ed la
[1:18:21] cierra nadie entra
[1:18:23] allí porque tengo un montón de basura
[1:18:27] dentro no se hubiera un poco raro
[1:18:31] eso hac rascarse la
[1:18:34] cabeza por
[1:18:37] qué Por qué
[1:18:39] papá por qué por qué le pones candado a
[1:18:43] esa es a ese garaje es un montón de
[1:18:47] basura de esa
[1:18:50] persona le significa algo para ello
[1:18:55] hay una
[1:18:59] puerta es una puerta muy
[1:19:02] especial y no solamente es una una
[1:19:06] puerta pero es esa
[1:19:11] puerta hay esa puerta de
[1:19:14] sanidad Como dijo la hermana
[1:19:18] se por una cosa y otra por la gracia de
[1:19:22] Dios
[1:19:25] puede obtener esa
[1:19:28] revelación que Dios
[1:19:32] sana y para mí eso es
[1:19:38] sobresaliente como alguien tan joven o
[1:19:44] anciano para agarrar esa
[1:19:47] revelación que Dios
[1:19:51] sana hay muchas personas que sufren toda
[1:19:53] su vida
[1:19:58] que sufren toda su
[1:20:02] vida Y quizá estén
[1:20:05] enfermos
[1:20:08] encarcelados porque no han pido podido
[1:20:11] agarrar esa
[1:20:13] llave es una cosa muy que
[1:20:17] deprime porque no queremos nadie que se
