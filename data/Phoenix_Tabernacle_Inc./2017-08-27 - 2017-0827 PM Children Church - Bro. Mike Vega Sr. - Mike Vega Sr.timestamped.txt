[17:58] god bless you
[18:02] it's quite an honor and a privilege to
[18:04] be standing up here tonight wondering I
[18:07] don't feel worthy of it because for the
[18:09] last three and a half years we've been
[18:11] falling the story that was written about
[18:14] brother Brennan's life supernatural to
[18:16] life of William Branham this series of
[18:18] books tonight we will complete book two
[18:20] the young man is his desperation 1933 to
[18:25] 1946 were in the final chapter chapter
[18:27] 30 prisoners set free and lo and behold
[18:31] the world is about to experience the
[18:34] power of the charismatic revival through
[18:38] our prophet of God William Marion
[18:41] Branham the year is 1946 to miraculous
[18:46] healings have occurred does sister
[18:48] Maggie Walker a nurse who was basically
[18:52] completely devastated by cancer brother
[18:55] Brandon prayed for her in the Lord
[18:56] healed her following that a Reverend
[18:59] Doherty heard about the the miraculous
[19:02] healing and he had a daughter by the
[19:04] name of Betty dawning who needed to be
[19:06] prayed for but they didn't know what
[19:08] affliction she had brother Brannon
[19:11] through the help of the Lord Jesus
[19:13] Christ was able to determine what that
[19:15] problem was pray for her she was
[19:18] miraculously healed and then he was
[19:21] asked by Reverend Doherty to come to st.
[19:23] Louis Missouri
[19:23] they raised $11 so he could go and I
[19:27] think he borrowed a suit jacket is that
[19:28] not right brother I believe it is he
[19:30] borrowed he borrowed a suit jacket to go
[19:32] to the to what would be what would turn
[19:34] out to be a major revival in the
[19:37] beginning of brother Brennan's national
[19:39] ministry in 1946 in st. Louis Missouri
[19:43] we pick up the story after brother
[19:48] Brennan has decided to accept the
[19:50] invitation of Reverend Doherty to go to
[19:52] st. Louis Missouri he had to make some
[19:55] very hard decisions but he made a
[19:56] promise to the angel the angel in that
[19:59] cave that he would serve the Lord Jesus
[20:02] Christ and so we're so thankful that he
[20:05] that was revealed to him and we're
[20:08] looking
[20:08] back on that at this point many years
[20:10] later we're gonna start this final half
[20:13] of chapter 30 the final half chapter of
[20:15] book 2 the next day he quit his job at
[20:25] public service Indiana in his post as an
[20:27] Indiana State game warden at church on
[20:30] Sunday bill told his congregation about
[20:32] the upcoming revival in st. Louis he
[20:35] also explained his promise to God that a
[20:37] Betty Doherty was healed he would move
[20:39] out into the evangelistic field and stay
[20:41] there as long as God met his financial
[20:43] needs so that he would never have to ask
[20:46] people for money then bill delivered the
[20:48] last sermon he would preach in Brenham
[20:50] Tabernacle for many years he took the
[20:53] subject of little David defeating the
[20:55] giant Philistine warrior Goliath it
[20:57] seemed a fitting text because like young
[21:00] David bill too was unfairly matched
[21:02] against his enemies he was a penniless
[21:05] small town preacher stepping out in
[21:06] faith to fight some of the giant evils
[21:09] of the world sickness pain and spiritual
[21:11] ignorance he was not worried about his
[21:14] lack of qualifications and resources
[21:16] because he knew that God was with him
[21:18] and with God all things are possible as
[21:21] the story of David and Goliath proved
[21:24] Margie Morgan accompanied Bill and made
[21:27] it to st. Louis along with several other
[21:28] members of his church Robert Dougherty
[21:31] rented a circus size tent and advertised
[21:33] to revival meetings around the city only
[21:36] a few dozen people came on the first
[21:38] night of the revival bill told him how
[21:40] an angel had met him and given him a
[21:42] commission from God to take a gift of
[21:44] divine healing to the peoples of the
[21:46] world next he had margie Morgan come up
[21:49] on the platform and give her testimony
[21:50] and what a spectacular testimony it was
[21:54] a month and a half ago Margie had tossed
[21:56] in bed delirious from pain for hours had
[21:59] seemed numbered the cancer had consumed
[22:01] her beyond hope then God performed a
[22:04] miracle now she felt as strong and
[22:06] healthy as she had ever felt in her life
[22:09] after this Betty Doherty bounced up to
[22:12] the front she too looked as healthy and
[22:14] energetic as any seven-year-old girl
[22:16] could be with these two testimonies as a
[22:19] background bill preached a short sermon
[22:21] in
[22:22] the people to have absolute faith in the
[22:24] promises of God to heal then he called
[22:27] for those who were sick to come forward
[22:29] 18 people came to the front for prayer
[22:34] one of the first people bill prayed for
[22:36] was a 70 year old woman who had a
[22:38] bandage wrapped around her head she also
[22:41] had a growth the size of a golf ball on
[22:43] the end of her nose
[22:44] taking the woman's right hand in his
[22:46] left the back up Bill's own hand turned
[22:48] an angry red and begin to swell he could
[22:50] feel the vibrations throbbing from the
[22:52] woman moving through his hand up his arm
[22:55] and all the way to his heart he studied
[22:57] the group of white bumps that formed on
[22:59] the back of his puffy red hand they
[23:01] moved just like the pattern of bumps he
[23:03] had seen when he touched Margie Morgan's
[23:05] hand it's cancer isn't it he said the
[23:08] woman said that it was after bill prayed
[23:11] for her healing in the name of Jesus
[23:13] Christ the throbbing in his own arms
[23:15] stopped the swelling went down in his
[23:17] arm returned to its normal state the old
[23:20] pronounced her healed even though the
[23:22] cancer stood out clearly on her nose
[23:24] next bill moved to an old man who had
[23:26] hobbled forward leaning heavily on a
[23:29] cane the man told bill he had been
[23:31] crippled for many years when bill took
[23:33] the man's hand there were no vibrations
[23:36] so bill claimed God's promise in James 5
[23:39] 14 15 is any sick among you let him call
[23:44] for the elders of the church and let
[23:46] them pray over him anointing him with
[23:48] oil in the name of the Lord and the
[23:50] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[23:52] the Lord shall raise him up bill touched
[23:54] a man's forehead with a drop of olive
[23:56] oil as he asked Jesus Christ to heal him
[23:58] before bill had finished his prayer the
[24:01] man threw aside his cane and marched
[24:02] away as sound and fit as he were 20
[24:05] years younger picking up the discarded
[24:07] cane bill hung it from the crossbars
[24:09] above the platform so the evening went
[24:12] one healing after another that night to
[24:14] deaf people received their hearing and a
[24:16] blind man received his sight of course
[24:18] not every healing was visible but
[24:20] everyone who came forward for prayer
[24:22] claimed that something supernatural
[24:23] happened to them after bill prayed the
[24:26] crowd went home very excited news of
[24:28] such spectacular miracles buzzed around
[24:30] the local grapevine in the following
[24:32] night every seat in the tent was filled
[24:35] more chairs were provided for the next
[24:37] night and still it left many people
[24:39] standing it was the same for the rest of
[24:41] the week-long revival the tent was not
[24:43] big enough to hold all those wanting
[24:45] inside still those who could not get in
[24:48] did not go home they pressed near the
[24:50] openings to hill-hill hear Bill preach
[24:52] hoping they could get a chance later to
[24:54] come up front for prayer and the
[24:57] healings bill had never seen so many
[24:59] healings and miracles crowded together
[25:01] into a single week people were delivered
[25:03] from cross ties arthritis ruptures
[25:06] tuberculosis diabetes heart trouble
[25:08] infantile paralysis tumors cancers
[25:11] nervous disorders stomach troubles and
[25:13] on and on those people who had diseases
[25:16] bill identified by the sign in his hand
[25:18] he began to draw a rudimentary
[25:20] understanding of what the gift in his
[25:22] hand could do apparently the life of
[25:24] each germ related disease vibrated to a
[25:26] specific frequency his left arm was
[25:29] physically reacting to those vibrations
[25:31] the white bumps that appeared on the
[25:33] back of his hand interests him
[25:34] interested him the most the patter of
[25:37] bumps seemed to be different for each
[25:38] disease by learning the meaning of each
[25:41] separate pattern he should be able to
[25:43] diagnose any disease caused by a demonic
[25:45] presence whether germ or virus
[25:48] he was certainly getting plenty of
[25:50] practice on Saturday night a 93 year old
[25:53] man with a long white beard was carried
[25:55] up front
[25:55] he had a peg leg and a glass eye but his
[25:58] prayer request was for his hearing he
[26:00] was completely deaf after being anointed
[26:03] with all in prayed for in Jesus name the
[26:05] man could hear even a whisper on Sunday
[26:09] night a 65 year old colored minister was
[26:11] led to the front the man had been blind
[26:13] for twenty years bill pointed a
[26:15] flashlight in a man's face without
[26:17] getting so much as a twitch of an eyelid
[26:19] he prayed for the man anointing him with
[26:21] all and calling on the name of the Lord
[26:23] then bill held his own hand in front of
[26:26] the man's face and asked can you see my
[26:28] hand
[26:28] the man quivered excitedly yes yes I see
[26:31] something it's dim and blurry that's my
[26:34] hand said bill keep your eyes on it and
[26:37] tell me when you can't see it anymore
[26:38] bill walked backwards across the
[26:40] platform keeping his hand in the same
[26:42] position at eye level when bill reached
[26:45] the edge of the platform over 40 feet
[26:46] away
[26:48] the man suddenly looked up and shouted
[26:50] praise the Lord I can count the lights I
[26:53] can see the cross arms they're hanging
[26:55] from on Monday morning a number of
[26:57] ministers in the city came to Bill's
[26:59] hotel room to ask him if he would
[27:00] continue the meetings for another week
[27:02] bill said he would pray about it and let
[27:04] them know when a minister's left bill
[27:06] and made a knelt to ask for the Lord's
[27:08] guidance after they had prayed a while
[27:11] and both their voices had fallen silent
[27:13] made a felt led to read from her Bible
[27:15] she opened it at random and began to
[27:18] read from Isaiah chapter 42 behold my
[27:21] servant whom I uphold mine elect in whom
[27:25] my soul delighteth I have put my spirit
[27:28] upon him he shall bring forth judgment
[27:30] to the Gentiles i the lord have called
[27:33] thee in righteousness and will hold
[27:35] thine hand and will keep thee and give
[27:38] thee for a covenant of the people for a
[27:41] light of the gentiles to open the blind
[27:44] eyes to bring out the prisoners from the
[27:46] prison and them that sit in darkness out
[27:49] of the prison house the old felt this
[27:52] was his answer had not he seen prisoner
[27:56] set free in this last week even to the
[27:58] opening of blind eyes calling the st.
[28:00] Louis ministers together he told him he
[28:02] would continue with the human revival
[28:04] for another week
[28:05] that night he preached a full tent and
[28:08] prayed for the sick until one o'clock in
[28:09] the morning the prisoners continued to
[28:12] be set free from sinus troubles gall
[28:14] stones glandular diseases defective
[28:16] vision high blood pressure arthritis and
[28:18] cancers nothing seemed able to resist
[28:21] the faith of the people in the power of
[28:23] Jesus Christ one man had an arm that had
[28:26] been paralyzed for 29 years
[28:28] after prayer he could swing it around
[28:31] over his head a crippling woman who had
[28:33] to be carried in walked out by her own
[28:35] strength a man who had tuberculosis and
[28:38] his bones of his right leg walked and
[28:40] stomped his his once diseased foot
[28:43] without feeling a bit of pain a woman
[28:46] holding an infant told bill that the
[28:47] baby never opened its eyes bill prayed
[28:50] in Jesus's name and the baby's eyes came
[28:53] open one night an 11 year old girl named
[28:56] Evangeline Getty brought a younger boy
[28:58] to the front who was deaf when Bill
[29:00] heard her story
[29:02] he had her repeated into the microphone
[29:04] Evangeline said that Bobby's parents did
[29:06] not believe in God but she believed she
[29:10] had seen what God can do so she had
[29:12] brought her friend Bobby to the meeting
[29:14] to be healed bill anointed Bobby withal
[29:17] and prayed for him in Jesus's name
[29:19] Bobby's hearing was restored this was
[29:22] not the only deaf child heal around
[29:24] 12:30 one night as bill was getting
[29:27] ready to close the prayer service a man
[29:29] burst through the back of the tent
[29:30] hollering brother Branham wait don't
[29:32] close yet the man led a twelve-year-old
[29:35] girl up to the front
[29:36] he explained I'm a minister from
[29:38] Northern Illinois some friends called me
[29:41] and told me how our Lord Jesus was
[29:43] answering your prayers I drove all day
[29:45] to get here so you could pray for my
[29:47] daughter she's never heard a sound in
[29:48] her life she was born deaf anointing the
[29:52] girl with a drop of olive oil bill
[29:53] turned his eyes up toward heaven and
[29:55] prayed softly please dear Lord restore
[29:58] hearing to this child in the name of
[30:00] Jesus Christ the girl jumped as those
[30:02] startled throwing her hands up to her
[30:04] ears she ran to her father she can hear
[30:07] as each nightly service began some of
[30:10] the people who were prayed for earlier
[30:12] in the revival came forward to tell
[30:14] about their healings such as the old
[30:16] woman who had a cancer on the end of her
[30:18] nose that same night she was praying for
[30:21] that cancer dropped off leaving an
[30:22] indentation where the growth had been
[30:24] another elderly woman showed how well
[30:26] her hands work now explaining that for
[30:28] the last two years both her hands have
[30:30] been crippled and useless after a failed
[30:32] operation a man who before could barely
[30:35] move due to rheumatoid arthritis
[30:37] demonstrated how effectively he could
[30:39] now use his limbs a younger woman told
[30:42] how she had injured her left foot
[30:43] breaking the metatarsus bone which then
[30:46] bolts just under the skin the doctors
[30:49] could do nothing for her but 15 minutes
[30:51] after bill prayed for her she felt her
[30:53] foot grow cold looking down she was
[30:55] surprised to see the swelling had
[30:57] subsided and the bone had moved back
[30:59] into its proper place by the last few
[31:02] nights of the revival so many people
[31:04] were crowding around the platform for
[31:05] prayer that bill could barely move from
[31:08] one person to the next with much
[31:10] difficulty he managed to pray for each
[31:12] one wanting prayer but it meant that
[31:14] does
[31:15] services lasting into till two o'clock
[31:16] in the morning when he finished each
[31:19] night he was so weak that Reverend
[31:21] Doherty had to help him walk to the car
[31:22] adding to this taxing workload during
[31:25] today Reverend Doherty took bill on
[31:26] house calls praying for those who were
[31:28] too sick to attend the nightly meetings
[31:30] finally his first healing revival ended
[31:33] leaving bill excited about the future by
[31:36] faith he had stepped into his new
[31:37] evangelistic ministry and God was
[31:39] blessing
[31:40] during the last eleven days bill had
[31:42] touched and prayed for over 1,000 people
[31:44] prisoners were delivered from prison but
[31:47] had not been without cost
[31:49] physically bill was drained still he
[31:52] felt satisfied because he knew he had
[31:53] tried his hardest to further the cause
[31:55] of Christ
[31:56] unfortunately in st. Louis he had
[31:58] established a pattern for his campaigns
[32:00] that in two more years would almost undo
[32:03] him completely god bless amen as we seen
[32:23] when the saints again will be
[32:25] introducing the the sunday school group
