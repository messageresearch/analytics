[48:06] ask for
[48:09] prayer these are all the petitions we
[48:11] have
[48:12] [Music]
[48:19] written but if you want to indicate your
[48:22] petition you can raise your hand and
[48:24] tell the Lord I have a petition
[48:27] truly we are the most needy
[48:31] people but the prophet
[48:35] says in the message in your word
[48:39] Lord at Thy word Lord that God cannot do
[48:43] anything he can't heal
[48:45] us he can't save
[48:49] us if we don't accept it
[48:52] first if we don't believe
[48:54] it and also if we don't confess
[49:00] it you will never live above your
[49:06] confession so as long as we each of us
[49:10] confess what we have accepted and
[49:15] believed did for us back in that day at
[49:18] Calvary for every one of us so when you
[49:23] confess
[49:25] Satan he cannot resist that
[49:30] word he can't resist that confession
[49:32] that you will do before God and
[49:37] God is obligated to his
[49:40] word he is not obligated to
[49:45] ours but his word being confessed
[49:48] through our
[49:49] lips will be arriving to
[49:53] manifestation maybe you may
[49:55] worsen
[49:58] maybe the situation can get more
[50:00] terrible but what God
[50:03] Said continue to confess
[50:06] it until it arrives to its fulfillment
[50:11] when we don't know but we do
[50:15] know that God fulfills his word let us
[50:20] pray let us place these
[50:24] petition and the petition that you
[50:26] placed in your
[50:29] heart we will be
[50:32] also praying for Tidings and offerings
[50:34] and if you can be kind as to byow your
[50:37] heads close your
[50:39] [Music]
[50:48] eyes let's
[50:50] [Music]
[50:55] pray
[51:00] [Music]
[51:07] we want to
[51:10] focus our
[51:12] full
[51:14] attention exclusively on the Lord Jesus
[51:17] Christ this
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] morning for he's the one who who loved
[51:30] us and he washed our sins in his own
[51:37] blood and he gave us
[51:43] access he sent us a
[51:48] Lifeline to the
[51:50] father so that we could approach him at
[51:53] a time like
[51:55] this
[51:57] in a place like
[51:59] this where we're all gathered all
[52:02] together and we have needs that we want
[52:05] to present to
[52:10] him so we want to take
[52:14] advantage of our god-given
[52:18] rights to approach them by the blood of
[52:21] Jesus
[52:25] Christ
[52:27] [Music]
[52:34] father we pray that you
[52:35] [Music]

[1:01:39] Lord of our
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:43] shortcomings and we need you Lord
[1:01:47] God as a group of Elders here in
[1:01:51] obedience to your
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:54] word your children have called
[1:01:59] forth and activated a part of the
[1:02:05] scripture that says to call forth the
[1:02:07] Elders of the
[1:02:11] church they will lay hands on
[1:02:15] them they've committed any
[1:02:19] sin or if they need
[1:02:22] healing it shall be done
[1:02:27] Lord you
[1:02:29] are our
[1:02:33] healer and you provided a way of
[1:02:38] healing and that's through the Holy
[1:02:43] Spirit and that Holy
[1:02:46] Spirit always goes to the root of the
[1:02:50] problem it makes no
[1:02:54] mistake and when it brings forth
[1:02:58] healing that healing is
[1:03:01] sure and that is
[1:03:04] permanent as long as the
[1:03:09] believer covers itself in the blood of
[1:03:12] Jesus
[1:03:15] Christ for there is no other
[1:03:18] name given unto
[1:03:21] men that they can be saved
[1:03:24] by but the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:28] Christ and in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:33] Christ every
[1:03:36] knee every

[1:03:42] knee in
[1:03:44] heaven in
[1:03:46] Earth and under the
[1:03:49] Earth shall
[1:03:52] bow and every tongue
[1:03:56] shall
[1:03:58] confess that Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ is
[1:04:03] Lord and every
[1:04:07] Spirit
[1:04:09] contrary to God's
[1:04:13] Wordle and in this
[1:04:15] moment we bring your children before you
[1:04:18] Lord
[1:04:20] God you have provided us a
[1:04:24] checkbook and we've come this moment
[1:04:29] Lord because you
[1:04:31] promised you guaranteed
[1:04:34] us that while we're on this
[1:04:39] Earth we'd have our right to our birth
[1:04:45] right of healing and
[1:04:49] salvation and there's no reason why we
[1:04:51] have to take a backseat to the
[1:04:54] devil or his
[1:04:57] minions
[1:04:59] nobody we've come to stand upon the
[1:05:04] word we've come to write out that
[1:05:10] checkbook and we sign it in the name of
[1:05:12] Lord Jesus
[1:05:15] Christ that our little your son here

[1:05:36] touch Lord send that Holy Spirit
[1:05:40] now and give her a transfusion of
[1:05:46] healing into her
[1:05:49] body and when they take that blood
[1:05:54] sample they will not find anything
[1:05:57] wrong all they will find is God's
[1:06:01] provided way of
[1:06:04] healing today praise

[1:17:01] place this
[1:17:03] morning I don't know another place that
[1:17:05] I'd rather be standing than right here
[1:17:06] in God's divine
[1:17:11] presence there's a lot of places that we
[1:17:14] could be this
[1:17:16] morning but in his
[1:17:18] presence with his people around his
[1:17:22] word is the greatest place I know to be
[1:17:25] this side of
[1:17:28] Eternity I greet you all in the name of
[1:17:30] the Lord Jesus
[1:17:33] Christ that's the greatest name that's
[1:17:36] ever been uttered from human
[1:17:40] lips is the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:44] Christ this morning what brings us
[1:17:47] together is that the grace of God has
[1:17:50] expressed itself to each one of
[1:17:53] us and we may we may come from different
[1:17:56] walks of
[1:17:59] life but it is it is in Christ that
[1:18:02] we're all
[1:18:04] one and I appreciate the grace of God
[1:18:07] this
[1:18:09] morning I want to thank brother
[1:18:11] John brother we met him down in Mexico
[1:18:15] City I've heard of brother Garcia for
[1:18:17] many many years but have never been
[1:18:19] privileged to meet
[1:18:22] him I'm glad this morning believe the
[1:18:25] same
[1:18:28] gospel I have my son with me this
[1:18:30] morning
[1:18:32] Zachariah he is my sixth
[1:18:35] son I have seven
[1:18:38] children six boys and then finally we
[1:18:41] had the
[1:18:42] girl and we said that's the
[1:18:48] Omega if you're standing with me this
[1:18:50] morning while you are I'd like to open
[1:18:52] to the book of Galatians chapter 3
[1:19:01] Galatians chapter 3 we'll read from
[1:19:04] verses 6 to verse
[1:19:09] 9 how many say praise the Lord this
[1:19:15] morning Galatians 3: 6 even as Abraham
[1:19:20] believed God and it was accounted to him
[1:19:23] for righteousness
[1:19:30] know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:19:32] Faith the same are the children of
[1:19:41] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[1:19:45] that God would justify the Heathen
[1:19:47] through faith preached before the gospel
[1:19:50] unto Abraham saying in thee shall All
[1:19:54] Nation
[1:19:55] be
[1:20:06] blessed so then they which be of Faith
[1:20:10] are blessed with faithful
[1:20:16] Abraham let just bow our heads this
[1:20:20] morning Heavenly
[1:20:22] Father we come to thee in the name of of
[1:20:24] our Lord Jesus
[1:20:27] Christ we thank you for the provided
[1:20:30] sacrifice that you give
[1:20:34] us now father we have opened your great
[1:20:37] word this
[1:20:39] morning and now we're asking you as the
[1:20:42] author of
[1:20:44] it to come and anoint that word to our
[1:20:48] hearts Lord anoint both the
[1:20:52] speakers and now this morning Lord the
[1:20:54] hearers as
[1:20:56] well may the Holy Spirit take these next
[1:20:59] few
[1:21:01] moments and may you speak to every life
[1:21:04] and every
[1:21:06] heart we just ask you to help us to get
[1:21:09] out of the way this
[1:21:11] morning and your perfect will be
[1:21:13] accomplished in this
[1:21:17] service we ask that you'd have
[1:21:19] preeminence in each heart this
[1:21:22] morning in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:25] and the church says
[1:21:28] amen God bless you you may be
[1:21:33] seated we find this morning as we begin
[1:21:39] this that Paul the Apostle in the book
[1:21:42] of
[1:21:44] Galatians is telling us how that God
[1:21:48] declared Abraham righteous in his
[1:21:53] sight
[1:21:56] Paul is telling us that Abraham our
[1:22:01] father was declared righteous by
[1:22:06] faith I want to begin this morning by
[1:22:08] saying
[1:22:10] this that when God Almighty declares
[1:22:14] something
[1:22:17] righteous means what he
[1:22:21] says and when he declares us righteous
[1:22:26] there's no devil in hell that can change
[1:22:28] God's
[1:22:32] mind this same writer the Paul the
[1:22:36] Apostle was speaking to the Roman
[1:22:40] Church and in the eth chapter he says
[1:22:43] these
[1:22:45] words who shall lay anything to the
[1:22:47] charge of God's
[1:22:51] elect it is God that justifies
[1:22:56] now we realize that Paul the
[1:22:59] Apostle tells us that we are
[1:23:04] Justified Justified is that we are
[1:23:07] declared righteous in the presence of
[1:23:12] God and he said we are declared
[1:23:14] righteous by
[1:23:18] faith we are not declared righteous by
[1:23:21] human
[1:23:23] works we are declared righteous by
[1:23:27] faith and the prophet of God taught
[1:23:31] us that faith is a
[1:23:34] revelation and he says that Revelation
[1:23:37] is
[1:23:38] Sovereign only God can give a man
[1:23:43] Revelation only God can put Faith in a
[1:23:48] man's God puts that faith in
[1:23:52] there to believe his word
[1:23:55] then God declares that man righteous in
[1:23:58] his
[1:24:01] presence there's no man that can take
[1:24:03] that from
[1:24:05] you there's no devil that can take that
[1:24:08] from
[1:24:09] you God declares us
[1:24:13] righteous we are righteous by almighty
[1:24:16] God this under this message of
[1:24:21] Grace we are not just forgiven
[1:24:26] we are declared righteous in his
[1:24:29] presence the prophet of God tells
[1:24:32] us that's as though we never sin in the
[1:24:34] first
[1:24:36] place brother and sister under this
[1:24:40] message that's been sent by almighty
[1:24:44] God let me just drop this in
[1:24:47] here this message we got this
[1:24:50] morning not the thoughts of William
[1:24:53] Brandon expressed
[1:24:56] of almighty God
[1:25:00] expressed used a man to bring
[1:25:04] it but this is not the thoughts of a
[1:25:06] human being this is not the thoughts of
[1:25:09] a human
[1:25:10] being but this is the thoughts of Elohim
[1:25:15] himself and he has declared you
[1:25:19] righteous you stand in his
[1:25:22] presence as though you never s in the
[1:25:24] first
[1:25:25] place who shall lay anything to the
[1:25:28] charge of God's
[1:25:31] elect God that
[1:25:33] justifies now brother
[1:25:35] sister the Bible tells us that
[1:25:40] Abraham if we are
[1:25:43] believers he has declared to be our
[1:25:47] father it is important who your father
[1:25:52] is it is important who you are
[1:25:54] identified
[1:25:56] with and Abraham is our
[1:26:00] father not necessarily because of
[1:26:05] genetics but because
[1:26:08] Abraham came from the same source that
[1:26:11] we came
[1:26:14] from and in the mind of
[1:26:16] God before the foundation of the
[1:26:20] world God fornew every one of us
[1:26:25] he called us just like he did
[1:26:28] Abraham he called us by election and
[1:26:32] Grace I am not here this
[1:26:35] morning because I deserve
[1:26:38] this I am not here this morning because
[1:26:41] I was raised in
[1:26:43] church I believe in this message this
[1:26:46] morning because of the grace of almighty
[1:26:50] God revealed this message to
[1:26:53] us and by Sovereign
[1:26:56] Grace he blessed us with the
[1:26:59] faith to believe this
[1:27:01] message I want you to think about this
[1:27:04] we didn't produce the
[1:27:06] faith God gave us the
[1:27:09] faith and then God turned
[1:27:12] around and he blessed us like it's our
[1:27:16] faith it's really his
[1:27:18] faith he gave us his faith and then
[1:27:22] blessed us for heaven
[1:27:25] that's what I call Grace this
[1:27:27] morning I didn't deserve it if God would
[1:27:31] have left me to
[1:27:33] myself I may be setting in a jail
[1:27:36] somewhere if God would have left you to
[1:27:39] yourself you may have been on a street
[1:27:41] corner
[1:27:42] somewhere some of you may have been in a
[1:27:44] Bor
[1:27:45] room but the grace of
[1:27:48] God you one
[1:27:50] day almighty
[1:27:53] God Sovereign
[1:27:55] Grace revealed this message
[1:27:58] to gave you the
[1:28:00] ability to say Amen to
[1:28:04] every that's the grace of almighty
[1:28:07] God now I want you to think for just a
[1:28:11] minute there are
[1:28:14] others that want to claim Abraham as
[1:28:16] well as their
[1:28:19] father there are three great religions
[1:28:21] in the world
[1:28:23] today
[1:28:25] first of all we have what they call
[1:28:29] Islam
[1:28:31] Islam that Abraham is the founder of
[1:28:34] their
[1:28:37] faith then we have
[1:28:40] Judaism and Judaism claims that Abraham
[1:28:43] is the founder of their
[1:28:47] faith we have
[1:28:49] Christianity and we Christians claim
[1:28:52] Abraham as the founder of our faith
[1:28:56] list
[1:28:57] carefully Abraham was not the father of
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:03] Israel Abraham was not his
[1:29:07] father ABR was his
[1:29:10] father ABR was the father of
[1:29:14] is but when he got his name
[1:29:17] changed then Isaac
[1:29:20] came Abraham is the father of Isaac
[1:29:26] Abra is the father of
[1:29:28] Israel when Abra believed
[1:29:31] God God changed his
[1:29:34] name to a father of many
[1:29:38] nations did you know that when God
[1:29:41] changed Abraham's
[1:29:43] name and promised him a son and said in
[1:29:47] these shall all the families of the
[1:29:49] earth be
[1:29:51] blessed God had you in mind
[1:29:55] he us Gentiles in
[1:29:58] mind
[1:30:01] Islam goes to
[1:30:03] is
[1:30:05] Judaism goes to Isaac
[1:30:09] Christianity is Abraham's fa
[1:30:13] seed which is
[1:30:15] Christ is the Royal seed of
[1:30:18] abrah and that's why when we are in
[1:30:21] Christ we are Abraham SE
[1:30:25] and we according to the
[1:30:29] promise now what you think about
[1:30:31] this
[1:30:33] Islam they pray three times a
[1:30:37] day they pray to A God Called
[1:30:41] Allah they they believe that their
[1:30:43] bodies must be postured to the
[1:30:47] ground and they must play pray toward
[1:30:52] Mecca Jud ISM believes that when they
[1:30:56] pray they must face the
[1:31:02] temple
[1:31:04] Islam and
[1:31:06] Judaism focuses on the posture of a
[1:31:08] man's
[1:31:12] body but
[1:31:14] Christianity does not focus on the
[1:31:16] posture of our
[1:31:18] body but focuses on the position of our
[1:31:22] hearts
[1:31:24] God doesn't care if you're on your
[1:31:28] face God doesn't care if you brothers
[1:31:30] are on a
[1:31:32] job you can have a paintbrush in your
[1:31:35] hand you can have a pen at your
[1:31:38] desk sister can be washing
[1:31:42] dishes you young people before taking a
[1:31:46] test if our hearts are right with
[1:31:50] God our
[1:31:52] PR it's not where we're at
[1:31:56] geographically it's where our hearts are
[1:31:59] before Mighty
[1:32:01] God our position before almighty
[1:32:05] God now I want to show you something
[1:32:07] about position a
[1:32:09] minute
[1:32:12] geographically nothing can change your
[1:32:15] position what a man knows what his
[1:32:17] position
[1:32:19] is it's all together
[1:32:21] different the very man that's writing
[1:32:24] about
[1:32:26] Abraham at one time his name was
[1:32:29] Saul he followed the faith of what
[1:32:31] Israel had the
[1:32:34] law but when he met Christ in Acts
[1:32:37] chapter
[1:32:39] n and that same Pillar of Fire that
[1:32:42] brought this
[1:32:44] message struck him down the road
[1:32:48] Damascus he met a living
[1:32:51] Christ that Christ and I am Jesus
[1:32:55] J and that radically changed Saul's
[1:32:59] life like
[1:33:01] Abraham God changed ABR to ABR for
[1:33:07] Abraham he changed Saul to
[1:33:11] Paul that same Pillar of
[1:33:13] Fire come in this
[1:33:16] day and has changed just from sinner to
[1:33:20] Saint Church
[1:33:22] to
[1:33:24] hallelujah hallelujah it changed our
[1:33:28] position now I started studying this one
[1:33:31] day and I found
[1:33:34] out that Paul never says Apostle
[1:33:40] Paul it's never Apostle
[1:33:43] PA it's always
[1:33:46] PA I started studying it out and I found
[1:33:50] out if you put Apostle in front of a man
[1:33:57] name that's only a
[1:33:59] title but when you put it after a man's
[1:34:02] name that's a
[1:34:04] position and what Paul was telling
[1:34:09] him in the body of
[1:34:12] Christ is an
[1:34:14] apostle I am a prisoner of Jesus
[1:34:17] Christ so you think about this when he
[1:34:20] was in
[1:34:21] Rome he was locked up in
[1:34:26] you cannot find when he was in
[1:34:29] prison that he ever says I Paul a
[1:34:31] prisoner of
[1:34:36] Rome he said but a prisoner of Jesus
[1:34:41] Christ because he knew that his
[1:34:43] geographical
[1:34:46] location change his
[1:34:49] position now let me say
[1:34:52] this your geograph
[1:34:55] location can never change your
[1:34:58] position but one of these
[1:35:00] days your
[1:35:02] position is going to change your G
[1:35:08] location brother your position is going
[1:35:12] to step you from one
[1:35:14] dimension over into another
[1:35:17] dimension and we're going to be
[1:35:21] changed there is power this morning
[1:35:24] knowing who you are as a son and
[1:35:26] daughter of
[1:35:28] God every one of
[1:35:31] you have a position this morning and
[1:35:34] that position is only
[1:35:37] found Jesus
[1:35:39] Christ not in a church not in a
[1:35:43] building but in Jesus
[1:35:45] Christ I might as well say
[1:35:48] it and there's only one way to get into
[1:35:52] Christ must be born
[1:35:56] again it ain't be better
[1:35:59] again it ain't do good
[1:36:02] again we got to be born
[1:36:05] again and there's only one way to be
[1:36:07] born
[1:36:08] again and that's why the baptism of the
[1:36:11] Holy
[1:36:12] Ghost only the Holy
[1:36:15] Spirit baptize you in Jesus
[1:36:18] Christ oh my when you get in Christ
[1:36:22] Jesus you how long you're securing
[1:36:26] him till the day of your
[1:36:29] Redemption till God changes your
[1:36:32] body that's why I said when God puts you
[1:36:35] in
[1:36:36] Christ he seals you for all time in
[1:36:40] eternity justifies you in the Pres of
[1:36:44] God God don't never change his
[1:36:47] mind you say praise the
[1:36:51] [Applause]
[1:36:52] Lord now I want to I'm watching that
[1:36:55] clock brother John I'll try to hurry my
[1:36:58] God a't this message
[1:37:01] rich is the word of God
[1:37:06] Wonderful Paul picks up Abraham
[1:37:10] again in the fourth chapter of
[1:37:14] Romans and he said what shall we say to
[1:37:16] Abraham our
[1:37:19] father and he asked the question as
[1:37:22] pertaining to the flesh have
[1:37:26] found he said for If Abraham were
[1:37:29] justified by
[1:37:32] works he have wear up to
[1:37:35] Glory but not before God and what
[1:37:38] Abraham is telling Paul is telling
[1:37:41] us no man by human
[1:37:46] Works can ever declare himself righteous
[1:37:49] in the presence
[1:37:52] of feel like I need to say
[1:37:55] this I taught that boy right there along
[1:37:58] with all of my other
[1:38:00] children as long as you live in Daddy's
[1:38:04] house you can borrow my convictions
[1:38:07] until you get your
[1:38:12] own just because he abides by my
[1:38:17] convictions and he lives in a preacher's
[1:38:20] home doesn't mean that he ever met
[1:38:22] Christ
[1:38:26] we must get these young people to
[1:38:29] Christ it is not good
[1:38:32] enough that they just be raised on the
[1:38:34] church
[1:38:36] pew we have got to get them to
[1:38:39] Christ brother bradam says I'm afraid
[1:38:43] we're getting people to
[1:38:45] church not to
[1:38:48] Christ going to
[1:38:51] church does not make you a Christi
[1:38:54] CHR but if you ever become a
[1:38:57] Christian love going to
[1:39:00] church you can't hardly wait for them
[1:39:02] Church doors to get
[1:39:05] open because there's a love of God in
[1:39:07] your
[1:39:08] heart now here's what I tell these
[1:39:11] boys I can take all the dos and the
[1:39:14] don'ts of this
[1:39:19] message don't do this do this do this
[1:39:24] and I can take the very message of
[1:39:27] Grace and I can turn it into a message
[1:39:30] of
[1:39:31] law I can take this great message of
[1:39:36] Grace and make it a rule book for that
[1:39:38] young
[1:39:40] man or I can get him to
[1:39:43] Christ and when I get him to
[1:39:45] Christ this message won't be a rule
[1:39:49] book be a love
[1:39:52] letter G now words in his heart other
[1:39:56] words in his
[1:39:57] heart when Christ gets in there when
[1:40:00] Christ comes in
[1:40:02] there and he sees this
[1:40:04] message and he may hear the prophet say
[1:40:07] don't do
[1:40:10] this he doesn't see that as a
[1:40:13] rule he sees that as a love of God to
[1:40:16] his
[1:40:18] life young people this
[1:40:22] message will keep you from a lot of
[1:40:26] scars it'll keep you from a lot of

[1:41:09] I just I I just got to get into this
[1:41:11] now Paul says for what saith the
[1:41:17] scripture now when Paul is talking about
[1:41:19] the
[1:41:21] scripture he is not referring refering
[1:41:23] to his
[1:41:25] writings he's not even referring to the
[1:41:27] writings of any of the Apostles of the
[1:41:29] New
[1:41:31] Testament he's talking about the Old
[1:41:33] Testament the Old Testament is called
[1:41:36] the
[1:41:37] scriptures remember First Corinthians
[1:41:41] 15 the great Resurrection

[1:41:49] the
[1:41:51] scriptures he was buried according ACC
[1:41:53] to the
[1:41:55] scriptures he raised again the third day
[1:41:57] according to the
[1:42:00] scriptures scriptures was the Old
[1:42:04] Testament you remember Jesus's
[1:42:07] resurrection when he walked with the two
[1:42:09] mlion
[1:42:11] Ro the scripture said he took the
[1:42:15] scriptures he expounded the scriptures
[1:42:19] beginning with Moses and the
[1:42:21] prophets all the things concerning
[1:42:25] himself brother Bram taught us in Christ
[1:42:28] the mystery God
[1:42:30] revealed the Old
[1:42:32] Testament was the complete revelation of
[1:42:35] Jesus
[1:42:37] Christ and now we know the new
[1:42:40] test also the complete Revelation
[1:42:43] Jesus no matter where you reading this
[1:42:46] Bible I just say this when God show me
[1:42:49] this
[1:42:51] message everything I read is
[1:42:54] Christ it don't matter where I go if I
[1:42:56] start with Genesis
[1:42:59] 1:1 Christ when I go to revelation 22 I
[1:43:03] see
[1:43:05] Christ This Book is the entire
[1:43:07] revelation of
[1:43:10] Christ brother bam
[1:43:12] says God slowly unfolded the
[1:43:18] mystery God gradually let the mystery
[1:43:22] out
[1:43:24] so the scriptures is the revelation of
[1:43:29] Christ God gradually letting it
[1:43:33] out he's preaching through the entire
[1:43:36] Old
[1:43:38] Testament the revelation of Christ to
[1:43:42] come brother when Jesus come on the
[1:43:46] scene he had men that stood in front of
[1:43:50] him and they said Abraham is our father
[1:43:54] he said if you believe Abraham you'd
[1:43:56] believe
[1:43:58] me your father Abraham rejoiced to see
[1:44:00] my
[1:44:02] day saw it and was
[1:44:07] glad you say when did Abraham see
[1:44:10] Jesus's
[1:44:11] day now he didn't meet
[1:44:14] Jesus as a man Jesus hadn't been born
[1:44:18] yet but he met
[1:44:21] MDC and form of a
[1:44:24] man and then later on
[1:44:27] me became Jesus
[1:44:30] Christ he met
[1:44:33] Jesus how he was revealed that
[1:44:36] day and Abraham didn't pick up stones to
[1:44:39] ston
[1:44:41] him Abraham said get me a fatted
[1:44:44] cal get some
[1:44:46] milk I want to fellowship with
[1:44:50] me brother we're doing the same thing
[1:44:52] right here this morning
[1:44:56] felling with the
[1:44:57] Revelation that Jesus
[1:45:00] Christ revealed in this
[1:45:03] day he told that
[1:45:05] crowd he said before Abraham
[1:45:09] was am then he said I and my
[1:45:13] father are
[1:45:16] one stones to Stone
[1:45:19] him we got
[1:45:21] Moses if you believe Moses you believe
[1:45:25] me Moses wrote in
[1:45:29] me every one of them
[1:45:31] men was portraying
[1:45:34] Christ Moses was a prophet of
[1:45:37] God but he reflected
[1:45:40] Christ Abel had a
[1:45:42] revelation but he reflected
[1:45:45] Christ Isaac was Abraham's beloved
[1:45:50] Son but he reflected Christ
[1:45:53] David was up on the
[1:45:55] mountain but he reflected Christ every
[1:45:58] one of their
[1:45:59] prophets for shattering a prophet to
[1:46:03] come one of those
[1:46:06] men was a prophet of God but Jesus he
[1:46:11] wasn't no prophet of
[1:46:12] God he was the God of all the
[1:46:16] prophets he was the one they wrote
[1:46:20] about every one of those men brother B
[1:46:23] said as
[1:46:25] eagles they would fly higher than
[1:46:27] anybody
[1:46:29] else Mind Of
[1:46:31] God give the word of God and they would
[1:46:35] say thus sayth
[1:46:37] the but when Jesus
[1:46:40] come read the four
[1:46:43] gospels he never said thus sayth the
[1:46:46] Lord he said but I
[1:46:50] say he was the Lord
[1:46:54] he met a
[1:46:56] group in Acts chap excuse me John
[1:46:58] chapter
[1:46:59] 10 that said he said for what good work
[1:47:03] Stone
[1:47:05] thee they said for good work Stone the
[1:47:07] we
[1:47:09] not but for
[1:47:11] blasphemy because thou being a man Mak
[1:47:13] thyself
[1:47:15] God
[1:47:18] wrong Jesus was not a man making himself
[1:47:21] God
[1:47:23] Jesus was God who made himself a
[1:47:28] man God became a
[1:47:31] man in the person of Jesus
[1:47:34] Christ now what you
[1:47:36] think brother I tell you I've seen this
[1:47:40] Revelation it's just been burning in me
[1:47:42] ever
[1:47:44] since when I see who Jesus Christ
[1:47:47] is there ain't no man that ever take his
[1:47:51] place because I love William
[1:47:54] Bram prophet of God but he'll never take
[1:47:58] the place of
[1:48:00] Christ Christ is who we look
[1:48:03] to didn't point to
[1:48:06] himself he pointed to
[1:48:09] Christ this
[1:48:11] message is not the revelation of William
[1:48:14] BR it's the Revelation Jesus
[1:48:18] Christ and it's revealed personally to
[1:48:21] you that same
[1:48:29] man boy yall was an easy root to preach
[1:48:33] to
[1:48:34] my I'm 46 years old I'm starting to feel
[1:48:37] like an old man
[1:48:39] this can you say praise the
[1:48:43] Lord the scripture
[1:48:45] said Abraham believed
[1:48:51] God and it was counted unto him for
[1:48:56] righteousness his faith
[1:49:00] alone declared him righteous in the
[1:49:02] presence of
[1:49:04] God now listen what God
[1:49:07] says the Bible says Paul's writing this
[1:49:09] in the New Testament
[1:49:13] now and the scripture
[1:49:18] foreing that God would justify the
[1:49:21] heathen
[1:49:24] y'all do know who the bunch of heathens
[1:49:25] are
[1:49:27] right that's me and you that's you and
[1:49:30] I we are them
[1:49:32] heathens way back there in
[1:49:36] Abraham God saw your faith in
[1:49:40] Abraham and God
[1:49:43] forese that he would justify declare

[1:56:48] welcome you're going to wear out your
[1:56:51] interpreter
[1:56:53] when I got here in the back
[1:56:56] room this man tried to tell me he wasn't
[1:56:58] that he was just like a spare tire sort
[1:57:02] of I don't believe none of that
[1:57:05] now I've done
[1:57:07] heard y'all got the best interpreters
[1:57:09] there
[1:57:12] heart so I'm not worried about
[1:57:16] it now I want to show you something just
[1:57:19] for a couple more
[1:57:21] minutes love him this
[1:57:23] morning a't God good to
[1:57:28] us now the Bible
[1:57:31] says that
[1:57:34] Abraham listen close now had the gospel
[1:57:37] preach to
[1:57:41] him one day I got to look at I said how
[1:57:44] in the world did Abraham have the gospel
[1:57:48] preach I thought the gospel didn't
[1:57:51] come Jus
[1:57:54] come but did you know I
[1:57:57] found where Paul was talking about
[1:57:59] Israel when they come out of
[1:58:02] Egypt they got in the
[1:58:05] wilderness he said For unto us was the
[1:58:08] Gospel
[1:58:11] preached as well as unto
[1:58:13] them so Israel had the gospel preached
[1:58:18] to and they said that Abraham had the
[1:58:21] gospel preached to them
[1:58:24] but then Paul
[1:58:25] says that the gospel preached to
[1:58:29] Israel did not profit
[1:58:34] them because it wasn't mixed with
[1:58:39] faith the only thing to make the gospel
[1:58:42] effective to your
[1:58:45] life is Faith and faith is a
[1:58:50] revelation and revelation has to be
[1:58:52] given to you by
[1:58:55] God so brother my sister if God has give
[1:59:00] you
[1:59:01] faith and you believe this
[1:59:03] morning if you don't have nothing else
[1:59:05] to thank God
[1:59:07] for you thank him for the
[1:59:10] Revelation he put in your heart to
[1:59:13] believe this glorious
[1:59:17] gospel now Apostle Paul
[1:59:22] in Romans chapter
[1:59:24] 1 he said Paul a servant of Jesus
[1:59:29] Christ called to be an
[1:59:33] apostle
[1:59:35] separated unto the gospel of
[1:59:40] God listen not the Gospel of Jesus
[1:59:44] Christ The Gospel of
[1:59:47] God then he says this
[1:59:50] statement which he proom promis a
[1:59:55] four By His prophets in the Holy
[2:00:00] scriptures so he says the
[2:00:03] scriptures is the gospel of
[2:00:06] God that he never come out and preached
[2:00:11] Jesus his name is not even
[2:00:14] mentioned but every time God came to
[2:00:17] them God would require something of them
[2:00:21] they would beli God even if they didn't
[2:00:24] fully understand that they're reflecting
[2:00:28] Christ they were believing the good news
[2:00:30] that God was preaching in that
[2:00:35] day you know I I was I was studying I'm
[2:00:38] probably G have to preach the rest of
[2:00:39] this tonight if it's all
[2:00:42] right this is some good
[2:00:45] stuff but did you know that brother
[2:00:47] ramam taught
[2:00:49] us that Cain and Abel
[2:00:52] were taught by their
[2:00:55] parents that it was fruit that caused
[2:00:57] the fall that it was it was
[2:01:02] fruit there's direct
[2:01:05] statements that brother B says Cain and
[2:01:08] abble Tau by their
[2:01:11] parents that it was fruit that caused
[2:01:13] the
[2:01:15] fall so Cain was only bringing to
[2:01:20] church he was taught by his
[2:01:24] parents but that
[2:01:26] morning I can imagine oh Abel was
[2:01:29] sitting in his
[2:01:32] office and he was about to go down to AB
[2:01:37] Tabernacle and he
[2:01:39] said I was about to make a horrible
[2:01:43] mistake but about
[2:01:46] 12:00 he came into the
[2:01:48] room and he gave me a revelation
[2:01:52] that it was not
[2:01:53] fruit but it was blood that caused the
[2:01:58] fall the church he come that morning to
[2:02:02] church Cain went to church and taught
[2:02:06] what his daddy taught
[2:02:09] him went to church and taught what his
[2:02:12] daddy taught
[2:02:15] him what his natural daddy
[2:02:19] said and Abel was preaching what his
[2:02:22] Heavenly
[2:02:24] dadd he had a
[2:02:26] revelation and when he offered that
[2:02:29] lamb he was literally portraying the
[2:02:32] gospel of
[2:02:36] God that God would redeem us by a
[2:02:41] lamb a price would be
[2:02:44] paid now whether he fully
[2:02:47] understood that there would come a
[2:02:50] lamb he had a revelation
[2:02:53] that it was the by the blood of his
[2:02:56] father in the blood of his
[2:02:58] mother he was born to
[2:03:01] sinner but only by the
[2:03:03] blood of an innocent
[2:03:06] lamb what his sins be
[2:03:10] remitted hallelujah hallelujah and
[2:03:12] brother that message still hadn't
[2:03:15] changed by the blood of Jesus
[2:03:18] Christ our sins
[2:03:20] Glory has been cast in the sea of
[2:03:24] forgiveness never to be remembered
[2:03:28] again my faith my
[2:03:31] Revelation in that blood declares me
[2:03:35] righteous in the presence of
[2:03:38] God do you believe
[2:03:42] that now listen just just about five
[2:03:44] more
[2:03:45] minutes I pull a little trick
[2:03:49] sometimes I said how many give me five
[2:03:51] minutes
[2:03:53] how many y'all give me
[2:03:59] [Laughter]
[2:04:02] five that's all I need I
[2:04:04] got eight people gave me five minutes
[2:04:07] that's
[2:04:14] 40 he
[2:04:16] said God promised
[2:04:19] before by the prophets in the Holy
[2:04:24] scriptures he said before in the Holy
[2:04:28] scriptures God
[2:04:30] promised concerning his
[2:04:35] son Jesus Christ Our
[2:04:38] Lord so the
[2:04:40] scriptures a
[2:04:42] prophecy concerning his
[2:04:44] son Jesus Christ Our
[2:04:47] Lord every
[2:04:49] type every shadow
[2:04:52] portrays Jesus
[2:04:54] Christ that's why brother Ben says if

[2:08:44] go the
[2:08:46] gospel is not just limited to that this
[2:08:50] thing is unlimited
[2:08:54] let me explain you what I mean God's
[2:08:57] been talking about this ever since the
[2:09:00] fall as a matter of
[2:09:02] fact God was the first one that preached
[2:09:05] it to Adam and
[2:09:08] Eve it was actually God was the first
[2:09:10] one that offered a
[2:09:12] lamb he took the skins of a
[2:09:16] lamb if I understand marriage and
[2:09:18] divorce
[2:09:20] right brother B said God created one and
[2:09:22] one of
[2:09:26] everything one buck one
[2:09:30] dough one rooster one
[2:09:33] H one and one of
[2:09:35] everything but when he clothed Adam and
[2:09:39] Eve he couldn't take one of the a Ram or
[2:09:42] a lamb that was already
[2:09:45] there or they'd never be able to
[2:09:48] reproduce so where did that Ram come
[2:09:50] from
[2:09:52] I I'll tell you where it came from if
[2:09:55] you'll tell me where that Ram came from
[2:09:56] Abraham got on top of that
[2:09:59] mountain come
[2:10:03] the I'll tell you where that lamb come
[2:10:06] BR if you tell me where Jesus came
[2:10:09] from it was the creative power of
[2:10:12] God brother we ain't redeemed with
[2:10:15] Jewish
[2:10:16] blood Gentile blood we're redeemed with
[2:10:20] the blood of Jehovah God
[2:10:23] himself and there's no sin that can get
[2:10:26] through that
[2:10:28] blood don't care where you've
[2:10:30] been I don't care what You' done if God
[2:10:34] reveals this gospel person to
[2:10:36] you if you have faith in that
[2:10:39] blood that blood will cleanse you from
[2:10:43] [Applause]
[2:10:44] all declare you in the presence of
[2:10:47] God you never send the first place
[2:10:52] matter if your brother remembers what
[2:10:54] you
[2:10:55] did it don't matter if your enemy
[2:10:57] remembers what you
[2:10:59] did they can't bring it up on
[2:11:02] you if God forgot it I don't care who
[2:11:08] remembers it's cast out of his
[2:11:11] mind never to be remembered
[2:11:14] again brother God don't take your
[2:11:17] sin and put it in his back
[2:11:20] pocket on you later down the
[2:11:23] road you confess your
[2:11:25] sin faithful and just to forgive
[2:11:29] you your
[2:11:31] sin do you believe that now listen you
[2:11:36] say but brother Luke I I did the same
[2:11:39] thing I did before I got
[2:11:43] saved I don't want to go tell God about
[2:11:45] it
[2:11:47] again God forgives
[2:11:49] you forgets about it
[2:11:52] so if you ever come back to him it's
[2:11:55] like the first time you ever told
[2:11:57] him he don't remember the
[2:12:00] last it's already been forgotten
[2:12:03] about come on
[2:12:05] Church you might do me
[2:12:08] wrong or I might do you wrong and you
[2:12:11] might forgive
[2:12:12] me but you can still sort of
[2:12:15] remember that ain't God when he
[2:12:19] forgives he forgets
[2:12:21] [Applause]
[2:12:23] you know what that is that's good
[2:12:27] news do you know when Jesus was
[2:12:30] born the Angels said fear not I bring
[2:12:36] you good

[2:13:14] gospel righteous in the presence
[2:13:18] of can you say praise the Lord
[2:13:22] let me close with
[2:13:24] this the original

[2:14:04] way the new birth you born the correct
[2:14:11] way do you know e brought a child in the
[2:14:15] world the wrong
[2:14:18] way because she moved away from

[2:14:25] sensation but Mary moved away from
[2:14:30] Sensation

[2:14:55] right
[2:14:56] way Sons and Daughters of
[2:15:00] Almighty and I really should correct
[2:15:03] that because the baptism of the Holy
[2:15:06] Ghost not really make you a Son of
[2:15:08] God but you Reed the new
[2:15:11] birth you always was a Son of
[2:15:14] God glory
[2:15:18] glor I'm almost done brother
[2:15:24] do you know the Bible
[2:15:26] said in Isaiah 9
[2:15:30] and6 74 Isaiah
[2:15:33] 714 says a virgin shall
[2:15:36] conce Isaiah 96
[2:15:39] says unto
[2:15:41] us a child is
[2:15:44] born and unto us a son is
[2:15:48] given a child is born
[2:15:52] a son is
[2:15:55] given a child is
[2:15:58] born is the human a son is
[2:16:02] given is
[2:16:04] divine he was both
[2:16:06] human and he was
[2:16:08] divine he was a child because he came to
[2:16:11] the womb of a
[2:16:13] woman but he was a son
[2:16:15] given he came from almighty
[2:16:19] God Mary was the only
[2:16:22] woman that actually ever received
[2:16:26] seed birthed a
[2:16:29] child still a
[2:16:34] virgin there's not a woman this
[2:16:36] building that's ever produced a
[2:16:39] child you're not a virgin it's
[2:16:43] impossible but married was
[2:16:46] pregnated produced a child and was still
[2:16:50] a bir
[2:16:51] a virgin shall
[2:16:53] conceive and she actually birthed that
[2:16:56] child and was still a
[2:16:58] virgin now listen
[2:17:01] carefully Lucifer Lucifer in the
[2:17:05] fall beat Adam to his
[2:17:08] wife what the prophet said lucier be to
[2:17:11] his
[2:17:13] wife got to Eve
[2:17:16] first and then Eve's
[2:17:19] womb remained open
[2:17:23] so when Adam got to
[2:17:25] her it was one womb with the seeds of
[2:17:28] two
[2:17:32] men think about this I'm closing I
[2:17:34] promise I'm not lying I'm
[2:17:37] closing I thought I heard somebody say
[2:17:39] Pharaoh let my people
[2:17:39] [Laughter]
[2:17:46] go I'm almost
[2:17:49] done y'all love
[2:17:53] him her womb remained
[2:17:56] open so Lucifer came into God's
[2:18:00] Eden beat Adam to his
[2:18:03] wife then Adam got to
[2:18:06] her and that one womb had two
[2:18:10] seed but now we're not in God's
[2:18:13] Eden
[2:18:16] we're now let me tell you what God
[2:18:18] did lufer came into
[2:18:23] in this day God came into
[2:18:27] Satan got to you and God pregnated
[2:18:32] you now watch this when God pregnated
[2:18:36] you this time he closed the womb up so
[2:18:40] when Lucifer
[2:18:42] comes he can't get his
[2:18:44] SE your wom is for one
[2:18:48] seed your wom is for one seed
[2:18:51] that's Christ he sealed that room
[2:18:55] up so it don't matter what the devil
[2:18:58] says what a false prophet
[2:19:01] says This Woman This
[2:19:04] bride
[2:19:08] Lord this bride in Satan's
[2:19:12] Eden will not fail she's
[2:19:16] predestinated not to
[2:19:18] fall she's ordained of God
[2:19:22] not to
[2:19:23] disbel brother there's a bride right
[2:19:25] here
[2:19:26] today that Satan can't defeat
[2:19:30] her to the devil his own
