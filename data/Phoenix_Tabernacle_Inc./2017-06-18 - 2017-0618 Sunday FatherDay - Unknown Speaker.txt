[Music] already oh this gra have brought we sa the one and gra will behold when we been there is my shine in as the S we know BL to see and when [Music] he amen God bless you amen Let's uh take advantage while we're standing to open up our scriptures and open up to the Book of Psalms chapter 8 and we're going to just start with the first first verse and go down to verse 9 oh Lord Oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth who has set thy Glory above the heavens oh of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest steal the enemy and the Avenger when I consider thy Heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou Hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou Hast made him a little lower than the angels and H has crowned him with Glory and Honor thou mest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands and thou Hast put all things under his feet all sheep and ox and yay and the beasts of the field the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea whatsoever passes through the paths of the seas oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth Lord Jesus we thank you for this day we ask you to be with us Lord share your spirit and your word with us father and may we walk away today with a greater understanding of who you are in our lives anchor yourself in US Lord and come into fruition father we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated it's a privilege to be here today uh today is the Father's Day uh 2017 and I thought uh it would be great to wish you all a Happy Father's Day to all the fathers but then also to all of you because as a father we have a a better time when everybody around us is having a good time I know some people say well I'm not a father that doesn't mean you can't have a happy Father's Day just because you're not a father Happy Father's Day to everyone and uh especially to the fathers and especially to my daddy who's home watching us happy Father's Day Dad and Happy Father's Day Mom amen amen uh God bless you all we're going to speak a little bit I think uh I wanted to talk a little bit about the first Father's Day and uh as a subtitle from the scripture we' read who is man you know the scripture says in in in four two it's two questions one of them is what is man and I'm going to take it as the angle of of who is man what is man that you're mindful of him and to me it's who is man who is man that you would pay attention to him that you remember him and the second question and who is the son of man that you visit him and brother brandham says that there can't be a a a of a a son that was eternal because a a a son has to have a beginning he has to have a father and he explains to us that MDC had neither father nor mother and he explains to us how mesc is Jesus Christ it had no father had no mother because he had no beginning he's Eternal which means without beginning without end and there is no father without a son because it is the act of having a son that turns you into a father which is why when I shake the young man's hand and I say Happy Father's Day I either get the embarrassed look of I'm a father or the shock look how do you know depending on their situation in life but you become a father when you have a son on June the 15th 1986 on Father's Day I became a father my son came just in time he was born on Father's Day and it was my first Father's Day I could celebrate as a father and I think about our heavenly father how it is that our heavenly father became a father and we begin to consider the heavens The Works of your of the fingers the Moon and the Stars which God has ordained and we got to ask ourselves who is this man that God would be mindful of in the message questions and answers on Genesis I don't have a lot of time to go into depth I think I'm on about message number six in the series I'm I'm taking but we're going to cover a little bit of these two men well man and the son of man why who is man that you're mindful of and who is the son of man that you visit in questions and answers on Genesis they ask brother brandham God created male and female created male and female that's the first point now in Genesis 2:7 it says he formed but first he created he formed Man Out of the Dust and breathed into his nostrils uh what is the difference or where is the connection in the above scriptures now but we I've got it wrote it down Genesis 1: 26-28 and Genesis 227 I'm sorry I'm still reading from from [Music] brother now in this Genesis 1:26 God made man in his own image and now let's read it together for you to to check me up and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowls of the earth over the cattle of the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth let us make man in our image and let them have dominion okay so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them again we have a created he him male and female created he them now Genesis 2:7 watch what he did here and God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul now what kind of for the questioner wants to ask what connection does this Genesis 126 have with Genesis 27 God created two men and which was the man what connection do they have how does it connect up in the scripture now if you notice in Genesis 126 let's get the first part first God said let us now let us us is a that's what he says is a let us make man in our own image of course we realize he is talking to someone he was speaking to another being let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them not he let them have dominion over the cast cattles of the field if you notice in creation the first thing that was created of course was light you come on down through the creation the lasting created was what a man and woman was made after man the last thing that was created of God's creation of God's creation is mankind but when God made his first man if you noticed he made him in the likeness of himself he was made in the image of God and what is God that's why I'm asking that's what the psalmist is asking what is man now brother bam is asking what is God what is man what is God I want to know who is God and who is man now in St John chapter 4 Jesus speaking he says whosoever drinks of this water I shall give unto him shall never thirst and he will be Wells of water springing up into everlasting life the woman said unto him sir give me this water Jesus said go and call your husband the woman answered now I believe I believe we have to get a little bit above that now to find out what I want you to see okay oh here it is the 23rd and 24th verse so he's in in four 23 and 24 you worship and you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is that the true worshipper shall worship the father in the spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him now the next verse is where I want God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now if God created man in his own image and in his own likeness what kind of man did he create a spirit man after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question will find this that God give dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattles to lead the beasts of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today okay so I'm just going to say it out there and you can find it here they they they talk about the Trinity of god father Son and Holy Ghost and they think that they are three separate people and yet one God brother Bram says how mixed up can you get if you have a different person or a different personality you have a different person makes three that's paganism it's one person the same person in three different offices God is the father God has the son and God has the Holy Ghost we know God is the Father's Creator God and Son of God is Jesus Christ and holy spirit is Christ in man but when you break it right down it's God the Father Elohim Creator God Jesus Christ the logus of God and man the holy spirit of God yes we are part of the Trinity of God let's go back 100 million years before there ever was a star moon or anything in the world there was a time when there wasn't nothing here it was just all forever and Eternity now we stand here on the edge of this banister and we look over and we see these things happening now no man has seen the father at any time no man can see God in the bodily form because God is not in body form God is a spirit no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father has declared him now notice there just space there's no light there's no dark there's nothing it just seems nothing but there is a great supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space and all places and he was from Everlasting from Everlasting he is the beginning of of creation that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of an adom in the air not nothing no air no nothing but yet God was there that was God no man had seen that that's the father that's God the father now notice after a while begin to see a little sacred light begin to form like a little Halo or something you could only see it by spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking the whole church now we're all standing on this banister looking at what God's doing and and by this we'll get down to this question here and you'll see how he brings it in no one has seen God and now the next thing we begin to see by by eyes of Supernatural looking we see a little light forming out there what is that that is called by the Bible readers the logos or the anointing or the anointing it's the part of God began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea of who he was that was the word of God God himself gives birth to his son which was before there was even an Adam or air to make an and the first Father's Day came into existence Elohim El gives birth to the logos there's the logos hi papy Pap hi son I'm a Daddy now and then the God begins to create but he doesn't create he's God the Father the Creator and yet brother brandom explains to us that God the Father the Creator the creator of Heaven and Earth doesn't do any creating it's the Lord playing around Play Time imagine if he was serious he's just playing around and he says let there be light Hallelujah and the first atom burst into existence and the sun begins to form then this logos the one that we say God the creator of Heaven and Earth father Creator but now we see that really the father the Creator all he created was the logos giving birth to himself into a a form that we can begin to understand what he is and then he hands off and now the logos which is God the Father embodied in that Halo of light begins to create the heavens and the Earth then he says he creates everything brother Braham takes us through the creation how the explosion went basically what the scientists call The Big Bang How the Universe began to expand out how millions and millions and millions of years passed by and when the time was right how that the logus went out and got the Earth and began to bring it back that's when the contraction of the universe and he got it close to the Sun so he could melt it because it was a ball of ice and when that melted enough that the Earth was covered with water now we're Burly in Genesis 1 where it says the Earth was without form and void and and the power of God the spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep of the water two Creations had already taken place God creating the lust first creation and the logos creating the universe second creation and then God begins another creation which is chronical in Genesis 1 what we all refer to is the creation of the Earth in seven days the third creation then he says everything created and he says you know what son or it could have been dad dad let us make man in our own image son let us make man in our own image let's just go real quick to the resurrection of Lazarus 1951 June the 29th back in the days before brother B got fiercely scolded by the angel that he was still tried to explain these spiritual things that the Pentecostal people could never understand then after he got all his creation made he said let us plural make man in our plural own image now if God is unseen and if the logus was in the form just mythically speaking speaking like a drama in the form of a Halo then it's supernatural and he had to make a man in his own image John 4 says that God is a spirit he had to make a spirit man and he brought it down now there's a deity that cannot be seen deity is the Supernatural and he brings it down from a sacred Halo so there's the deity that cannot be seen then you bring it down to the sacred Halo that can be seen but not with these eyes only with the supernatural eyes then he brings it down from a sacred Halo to a little white cloud something that's more visible that's man and he gave him rulership over the kingdom and he governed the Beast like the Holy Spirit leads the church today for there was no man to till the SE soil then he put man in the image of man on earth created him out of the Dust of the Earth that's the second man but the first man was the Holy Spirit and he led a beast just the way the Holy Spirit does today leading the church going back to Genesis turn Genesis and I'm going to stop right here what is the difference or where is the connection in the above scripture what connection does the first man have with the second man the first man is is the second man made manifest in five senses God bless [Applause] you oh goodness I take back this is as bad bless you isn't God [Music] good yall wondering what I'm going to say so am [Laughter] I what a beautiful introduction beautiful foundation so what we've heard so far you know we it's we hear it and and we see it at an arms length so I'm going to go to a message named adoption I changed it sorry okay and brother Bram says this when did he choose us when did God choose you that's got the Holy Ghost no we all want to know that when did he choose you before the foundation of the world he chose you and sent Jesus that he might be the propitiation of your sins to call you to reconciliation to himself let me read that again he chose you and sent Jesus that he might be the propitiation of your sins to call you to reconciliation to himself to love oh wish we had just a few more minutes he said let me before we go any further go back Genesis 126 he says when God made man before he made man he called himself l e l l l e l h l Elohim Elohim now that's where they get the name Elizabeth from that's why El L I'll leave that okay so L Elohim that word the word means in Hebrew the self-existence all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence there ever was self-existent one Ella Elohim means the all sufficient the all powerful Almighty self-existing one oh but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am y a Hu j u Vu yah Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existent one who has created something off of me off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine now he start off where when did he choose you oh Glory says so Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man and amateur God so he isn't self-existence anymore oh this is Brother BR talking Jehovah means gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family amen amen eloh El now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family oh praise God now God made man to pre pre to be predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was got over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak speak this and it would be so oh there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exist with his family and his little ones with him there you are oh but we you know the fall everything happened you all know you all know the story this is why the scripture tells us in Malachi 45 behold I send you Elijah the prophet he says because what was once perfect it was lost and through this whole uh drama which He sent Jesus to be the pration for our sins so he had to bring to he had to restore us he had to bring our restoration amen now the end time evangelism This is the End Time evangelist message now I don't want you to lose this because all he's trying to do what he is trying to do at this time is to bring back the bride to be as he was once or as she was once before the fall to bring us back into Perfection so that he can once again say I see the same image oh let us make man the same image not something different but if I can say this we lost our way the end time evangelist message is from Malachi it's a [Music] restoring the message and messenger I'm sorry but I am not waiting for another Prophet I'm not waiting for somebody else it's a message I'm a messenger and they are one yes am amen I was going to tile my message who's your daddy who's your [Music] daddy the message and messenger both will have to be a restoration of the faith Jude said in the book of Jude just about 30 years after the crucifix he said Brethren I give all diligence to write unto you of the common faith that you should earnestly contend for the faith was once delivered to the Saints back there see see Malachi said for the last days the last prophet of the Old Testament that before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come I will send to you Elijah the prophet he will restore the faith of the children back to or to the faith of the children back to the fathers just before the destruction time what is it it's a message that goes forth a message and messenger of the last days that's not to bring them to a Creed but to jerk them out of those Creeds and to bring them back to the original Fai of Father the Pentecostal father where the church is to be in the last days not the Messi's fathers butal fathers he said that's a 1962 I'm I'm going to jump to paragraph 181 look here remember my message recently on the bride tree see how they took Jesus he was a tree the one that David saw a tree planted by the rivers of water his fruit in season the most perfect tree and they cut him down and hung him on a man-made Roman Tree for a mockery but what did he do rose up again the third day what else did he do he set forth a bright tree a man and a woman like the trees that was in the Garden of Eden two trees one of them the tree of life and one the tree of death and what did he do he come to redeem this tree so since he redeemed it at Calvary he's ready to plant her now oh my I got I get to feel religious when you say that to restore his bride tree the one that should have been in Eden but she fell there because she disbelieve the word but here he's going to restore a tree that will believe the word and when she come up on the day of Pentecost that original doctrine that original Faith then what did Rome begin to do sent a korm sent a Palmer worm and each one took his part off the fruit and the leaves and everything and suck it all down but what did the prophet he saw he said I will restore that tree sayth the Lord she started back in the Reformation what did she do organized God pruned her right in St John 14 cut all organization and she come back to Wesley she organized pruned her off I will restore she's still coming now what does it do in the evening time there will not be an organization there will be a top where does a fruit ripen at first Hallelujah this is good so where does the fruit ripen first at the top why cuz the Sun hits itlu and in the evening time the seeds are planted now for an evening time bride let me say for an evening time bride tree when the Tree of Life returns back to the Bright Tree you see and evening light has come out now to water to ripen that fruit that's been on the trees planted the seeds are sold see the evening time so the evening time evangelism will be the mark of Malachi 4 to restore the faith of the people back to the faith of the fathers yes sir back to the building Stones Hallelujah back to the building Stones what does that have to do with this oh my everything everything today the leader against saying numers numbers that back there they said in Jesus time in that dispensation Jesus said you Hypocrites you scribes you Pharisees you Compass Seas to make one proelite get one member and when you bring him in he's a two child more of Hell than he was when he started wow that's why you got a lot of people they open their own church oh let's get members finish Tabernacle oh it's dying it's dead let's get new members oh let's be let's become make more churches oh let's make let's let's get that member we're going to get that member we're going to get this member yeah you will there's a prophecy wow point you to somewhere else I'm sorry and when you bring him in he's a two-fold child more of Hell than he was when he started and they'll spend billions of dollars and do everything they can to make one more member of church and when you do he's worse off than he was out there you can just make a hypocrite out of him let the men do the things get on out in the world and laugh and make fun of the Gospel and everything like that and see leaders of this day again is say numbers numbers numbers that's all that count today is numbers decisions now that's a big word today decisions I wish somebody would make some deciding to serve God instead of joining a church he's talking to Phoenix Tabernacle phen he's talking to you are you joining Phoenix Tabernacle the church or are you joining the Church of the Living God make a decision come in put your name on the book set a whole big bunch of people down there and would write what's your name Jones Juan Jones do you accept Christ as your savior oh yeah yeah you believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God oh oh yeah oh Satan does the same Satan does the same thing the Bible said he did he believes and trembles yes sir but you don't tremble when you really believe hallelujah hallelujah all those that love his appearing as I said someone constantly telling me sending me letters you scare people to death brother Bram telling them that the end time is coming SC the church my that's the most glorious thing that could happen the coming of the Lord the end time I wish it was right now sure it's the most glorious thing I ever thought of to me my Lord this old robe of Flesh I'll drop and rise and seize the Everlasting prize go back to be a young man again and live forever with my Lord with all my people hallelujah who said that [Music] that was brother BR all my people 190 paragraph 19 what good I have left I still got time Brothers Kian what good Gian is the stones if you haven't got a stone Mason to shape them out confessions is Stones oh I believe in Jesus Christ as my savior he saved me he's my savior I believe there's a Son of God I I go to church oh I serve him oh I confess this I confess my healing I confess my salvation I confess this I confess that amen amen not too many more amens right confession is Stones when Peter made his confession Jesus said thou are Peter a little Stone but what what good is a stone if there isn't a stone Mason there to shape him to a Son of [Applause] God praise God you're just piling up a bunch of rocks is that right it isn't doing a bit of good see the water weth a weigh the [Music] stone the water does the washing of the water of the word washes the stone away you're just a pile bunch of DRS see that's right that's the people that's the people what God what good is stones if you haven't got a true Stone Mason with a good sh tool to shape him into The Fitting Place in the house of God oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah every Son of God is a stone that has been shaped been formed to be in position in the house of God just want to ask you what goods the decision what good you putting your name on the book what good is you come join the church if the stonemason isn't there that'll shape that and make them quit this and that and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like Christians set in the house of God finds following the Believers the end that's end time evangelism taking the stones and shaping them amen that's why you can only be shaped perfected oh see I didn't understand this when Daddy said that that's why you need the message of the hour this message because this is what's perfect because that when that which is perfect comes that which is in part shall be put away because now is a manifestation of the sons of God God in human flesh the deity of Jesus Christ here on Earth through his bride to bring us back thus sayith the Lord why cry speak the word [Music] amen now the quote was read the other day and brother brother Junior still he's always still in my thunder I love brother Junior that's that's why he said so the prophet said he said the bride has th say the Lord and she doesn't have nothing to say she keeps still she keeps crying where is the stay of the Lord in the message of the hour if you can't find it in the Bible find it in the message if you can't say thus sayeth the Lord then you better be quiet but you got to understand that when you're a child of God oh when you've come to the adoption because this is the age of the adoption where God dwells on his deity of God is in his bride oh it happens it happens where dead are raised up from the when people are raised up from the dead the sights are given oh no that's only the prophet only the prophet did that even the prophet said he said I didn't say that that was God in Me That was deity in flesh and God can use any one of you now we're not the prophet oh you understand we're not the prophet but we've been taught what good would the stones be said if you just pile them up lay them where they're at do a little bit better out there then they would pile them up together they might be needed out there oh and none of them out there and none of them out there see that's right stone is no good without a stone Mas now watch Jesus counts character not members you know that it counts characters God has always tried to get one man in his hand all he needs one man and he'll do his work through the years just think he could only find one righteous man in the time of Noah in the time of Moses only found one righteous man 197 God's looking for character not membership character elzar when he went to get the Bride of Isaac swe it out until he found character remember Abraham put him responsible as God put us responsible that's right we ministers oh that's plural oh that's why when they ask brother Bram will there be a Ministry in the end time was there an end time ministry said yes they will oh there's a 54 Ministry there's a Ministry in the end time but she will only say what the heads don't say oh and the head God came and he said Grace hallelujah hallelujah oh that's right we Minister my bride God bless your heart I ain't looking for members I'm looking for the pure in heart somebody that'll believe the word elar looked and he thought oh I can't do this myself there's too much [Music] responsibility I'm realized the responsibility of finding Isaac Isaac which is type of the Bride you know Christ Rebecca the type of the Bride elar got down on his he and said God God you just have to help me and when he referred to God God helped him he got character come back to the word brother come back to God don't pay any attention to this church you let me say that again come back to the word come back to God don't pay any attention to this church you belong to you can stay there if you want to they'll let you but the thing to do first is come to God that's right correct this is

pray that it was a blessing for um I had a brother yesterday asked asked me he he requested this I didn't really to do this but a brother asked me yesterday if I could get up here and say this and I'm going to tell you what the brother is requesting he says look brother last time you got up there in the Pulpit you said that you didn't want and then none of the mothers to cook now now it's the father's time for the father not to cook today and not to go out either out to eat and then him have to pay the mother should the mother should pay because his father's day okay this is what the brother requested of him but but then here's the problem I'm not supposed to be saying that the fathers that should they should not be cooking today because yesterday around I don't know remember maybe around 8:00 at night my wife she went to the store running to the store it's say I forgot to tell you something she says the boiled eggs are right there in the counter you know hard cooked boiled eggs you need to peel them well I peel the eggs pour people that cook imagine you know how hard is to break the shell take off the shell everything's a mess and then my wife comes she saying what are you doing you told me to put him in the water I told you to take him out of the water well I'm not a cook so I already broke that so he said don't cook and I already cooked who's the one that gives the orders in the house the wife is the one that gives order in the house did you hear me Brothers you can't really hear that well the wom's give orders in the kitchen if you want to fight with me fight with the sisters um one more announcement um Joseph Bram our brother Joseph Bram wrote to me and he gave [Music] us this little device it's it's called agap I understand it's hero there's different versions and he gave this one to us and I'll tell you the truth brother I give it to you for you he sent it to me or for someone else if they need it and the brother says well who's going to get it because he says it's for you whoever needs it forgive me it's mine already well the truth is two weeks back I was about to buy one I was already doing that but God is so good he gave it to me as a gift I'll read it in English on his page he even has a signature I'll read it in English this is this letter is sent from Brother Joseph Bram I ask you to show this this hero Edition tablet to your church and explain to them what this device can do if they would like to purchase one they can order directly from voice of God Recordings or or the church can place a a combined order if they if they choose these are these are available from the voice of God this Edition right here is English and Spanish and not only that but you can look up a coat and I don't know how it all works together but there's no interruptions from you know like the internet it it was made specifically just for this purpose and there's no interruptions right right that's what I was going to say this this one here is it's available in English and Spanish there there is another version that's in Spanish only and uh I could be wrong on this those are not available those are sent out to different countries is that right brother [Music] jul they send the other versions to different countries and and what I understand that those are the people that are with the voice of God so they they they make those available countries and they're starting in Latin America first okay they're starting in Latin America brother Billy says so we just want to acknowledge and tell you that these are available if you want to order one these are from The Voice voice of God um I'm not good at giving uh announcements brother and sisters um I want to read you a code here you know it gives you you can hear the message you can actually hear it and you can look up a code it's really nice just real short little thing here about um I'm going to stand here and do my best for my savior that's right whether it rather it hurts or whether it doesn't I am your father in The Gospel brother Bram is telling us that he is our father in The Gospel amen amen but let me let me insert something here the reason that brother Bram messenger prophet of God sent to this age the reason to be the reason he became our father in The Gospel just like when Jesus Jesus Christ came to the Earth and Jesus himself said I do nothing of my own but only that which the father shows me brother Bram did the same thing he had the same Ministry of Jesus Christ and what we believe that God sent his son Jesus Christ and in this end time it was promised that he would send the spirit of Elijah which is the Lord Jesus Christ manifested in one man named William maram brandham God set his son William Mariam Branham William Mar Bram so then he becomes Our Father the gospel but can I also add that I also believe that he sent his other son has many sons he sent his other son Garcia brother Bernie G Garcia and he only repeated he only repeated what that seventh angel messenger told us to me not only brother random is my father in The Gospel brother Bernie Garcia is me is my father in The Gospel and not only that William Bram if William brandham came and he had children as well Joseph Bram Jose Bram Billy Paul and Billy Paul being children of God's Prophet they as well they also like they are our fathers in the gospel and I'm talking about Joseph BR that's what I believe that's what I believe now you got to say what brother Bram said in his Doctrine brother Bernie said exactly what brother brandham said so if you claim to believe brother Bernie you got to say exactly what brother Bernie said because he said exactly what brother brandham said so if you're a Son of God you are also a father because the father goes in you adopted son and daughter of God not does not come by himself but he comes accompanied by the father didn't Jesus say that it's not me that does the work but my father that is in me likewise you you are my disciples if you walk in the light because we have been given the word word when it's manifested is the light of the hour God bless you thank you God bless you Brothers I'll ask if you can please stand so we can be [Music] dismissed happy father to my [Music] father if you can please bow your heads we shall be praying Lord Jesus [Music] in this morning Lord we come unto your divine presence first of all thanking you for this great [Music] privilege it's a privilege for us to recognize that we are your children and we have been chosen since for the foundation of the [Music] world and at these times to be hearing these tremendous messages I believe it's a great privilege thank you so much for [Music] that and In This Moment we'll be finishing with this [Music] service we ask father that you go with us [Music] that you take care of us while we're at our jobs or in our vehicles and that you allow us to see us here once again we invite you to go with us at every moment we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Joan give a real quick announcement they want to let know that the service tonight is cancelled and the activities here are also canceled [Music] okay
