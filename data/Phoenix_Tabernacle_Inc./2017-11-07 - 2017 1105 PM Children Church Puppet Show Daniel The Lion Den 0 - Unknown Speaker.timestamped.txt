[2:19] okay god bless your brothers and sisters
[2:25] tonight we're going to continue our
[2:27] series of readings to start the
[2:28] children's service we're in book three
[2:31] of the series of books called
[2:33] supernatural life of William Branham the
[2:35] man and his commission 1946 to 1950 by
[2:39] Owen Jorgensen we finished the first
[2:43] chapter and our last reading this
[2:45] chapter is chapter 32 in the entire
[2:49] series counting the chapters from book 1
[2:51] to now challenging insanity
[2:54] it's from 1946 and before we get started
[2:58] just a few comments to let you know that
[3:01] the we're going to read the first
[3:03] portion of chapter 32 and this is not
[3:07] only a tremendous chapter but I believe
[3:11] that this is getting into the
[3:12] fundamentals of the gift that William
[3:14] Mary and Branham was given by the Lord
[3:17] we're gonna hear some details revealed
[3:20] in this chapter that will carry forward
[3:23] and brother branham's life so the rest
[3:26] of his life and the Holy Spirit which
[3:29] carries it forward today to us so if you
[3:33] ever paid close attention to what we're
[3:35] going to share in this series I would
[3:37] wholeheartedly and sincerely recommend
[3:39] tonight listening closely and that goes
[3:42] for our children who are here tonight
[3:44] our young people as well as our children
[3:47] young at heart so as we get started
[3:55] after Kendon william branham held a week
[3:58] on healing campaign in Pine Bluff
[4:00] Arkansas and then moved on to Little
[4:03] Rock the state's capital Reverend Brown
[4:05] had rented a large auditorium not far
[4:07] from the Capitol building by now Bill's
[4:10] reputation had spread so far through
[4:13] word-of-mouth that the crowds attending
[4:15] the Little Rock meetings were larger
[4:16] than they were at Camden the auditorium
[4:19] quickly filled to capacity with many
[4:20] people left standing outside on the
[4:23] first night bill explained to angels
[4:25] Commission and told about the miracles
[4:27] he saw in Camden and Pine Bluff then he
[4:30] asked for all those who wanted prayer to
[4:33] form a line to his right
[4:35] hundreds of people rose to their feet at
[4:37] once and gradually with a great deal
[4:39] confusion formed a line over and over
[4:42] the organist played the tune to only
[4:45] believe while these people came forward
[4:47] one at a time for prayer when a person
[4:51] stood before him bill would graphs the
[4:53] patient's right hand with his own left
[4:55] hand if that person had a disease bill
[4:58] would instantly feel vibrations pulsing
[5:01] up his arm like a low-voltage electric
[5:03] current then in his left hand it would
[5:06] swell up red like it was infected in a
[5:09] series of white bumps would appear
[5:11] across the back of his hand from the
[5:13] pattern of these welts bill could tell
[5:15] what disease the person had speaking
[5:18] into the microphone so the audience
[5:19] could hear he would identify the problem
[5:22] ulcers tuberculosis cancer and so on his
[5:26] diagnosis was always correct then he
[5:29] would pray rebut condemned ins in the
[5:31] name of Jesus Christ as soon as the
[5:34] demons left the patient Bill's hand
[5:36] would return to its normal size and
[5:38] color then he would pronounce the
[5:40] patient healed and turned to receive the
[5:42] next person in line at this point a
[5:45] spontaneous murmur of amazement often
[5:47] escaped the lips of those watching these
[5:50] men and women had never seen anything
[5:52] like this before
[5:53] here was visible evidence of God in
[5:56] their midst and inspired many to weep
[5:59] reverent tears bill was as amazed by his
[6:03] gift as was everyone else before his
[6:06] commission it had never occurred to him
[6:07] that
[6:08] germs vibrated with life now he could
[6:11] not only feel the vibrations he could
[6:14] watch the physical reactions they caused
[6:16] it in his left hand both the red
[6:18] swelling and the white bumps which
[6:19] formed a pattern according to each
[6:21] disease the more bill used this gift the
[6:25] more he learned about the ways of demons
[6:27] for example by now he knew the reason
[6:30] these welts moved on the back of his
[6:32] hand was because the demon life of the
[6:35] disease that could become excited by the
[6:37] presence of the angel the spiritual
[6:40] significance of these germ or virus
[6:42] induced vibrations was also becoming
[6:44] more clear in his spare time between
[6:47] services bill read and reread the New
[6:49] Testament trying to understand the
[6:51] healing ministries of Jesus Peter and
[6:53] Paul and therefore to understand his own
[6:56] putting together two scriptures with his
[6:58] own thoughts about modern medicine it
[7:00] seemed to him that diseases have two
[7:03] sides one physical in the other
[7:05] spiritual the physical level was the
[7:08] actual germ or virus that a medical
[7:10] scientist could see through a microscope
[7:12] but from where did those germs or
[7:15] viruses come certainly not from God
[7:19] germs and viruses drew their life from
[7:21] the god-given life of the person they
[7:23] invaded in reading the biblical accounts
[7:26] of Jesus's own healing ministry bill
[7:29] recognized that germs and viruses are
[7:31] the physical signs of demonic powers
[7:34] just as any living creature has a
[7:36] physical and spiritual side to its life
[7:38] so does every disease medical doctors
[7:42] concerned themselves with the physiology
[7:44] of an illness
[7:45] whereas bill was dealing with the
[7:47] demonology the sign in his hand picked
[7:50] up their vibrations of that demonic life
[7:52] which was attacking the god-given life
[7:53] of a human being
[7:55] bill knew that the swelling of his hand
[7:58] couldn't heal anyone but it could build
[8:00] faith seeing a disease supernaturally
[8:03] revealed could raise a person's faith to
[8:05] the point where he or she could believe
[8:08] God was healing jesus said if thou canst
[8:12] believe all things are possible to him
[8:15] that believeth it was Jesus doing the
[8:18] healing both then in that
[8:19] of course not every person's trouble
[8:22] needed a supernatural sign to disclose
[8:24] it some problems were obvious one man
[8:27] had a large red goiter protruding from
[8:30] his neck as soon as bill asked Jesus for
[8:32] the man's healing the goiter turned
[8:34] white dropped to the floor and rolled
[8:36] between Bill's feet a newspaper reporter
[8:39] flashed his camera and the next day a
[8:41] picture of this miracle appeared on the
[8:43] front page one crippled old man who had
[8:46] hobbled around on crutches for years was
[8:49] healed in the sight of everyone and
[8:51] walked off the platform carrying his
[8:53] crutches over his head while he shouted
[8:55] praises to Jesus Christ the next evening
[8:58] when the service began this man sat near
[9:01] the front with a sign on his back that
[9:03] read Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[9:05] today and forever as bill came out to
[9:09] the podium this man stood up and
[9:11] hollered say preacher I want to ask you
[9:14] something they'll acknowledge the man
[9:16] what is it dad I'm a Nazarene and when I
[9:20] first heard you preach I thought you
[9:23] were a Nazarene - then I saw how many
[9:25] Pentecostal people are in the meetings I
[9:27] thought sure you must be a Pentecostal
[9:30] then I heard you say you were a Baptist
[9:32] I don't get it that's easy dad bill
[9:36] we're pride I'm a Pentecostal Nazarene
[9:39] Baptist after the crowd quit laughing at
[9:42] his little joke bill said seriously I
[9:45] just represent the Lord Jesus Christ in
[9:47] His mercy the scripture says that by one
[9:51] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[9:53] and become one people Jesus is not going
[9:56] to ask us if we're Methodists or
[9:58] Baptists he's going to judge us but what
[10:01] is in our hearts night after night
[10:03] hundreds of people streamed forward for
[10:05] prayer taxing as it was on Bill's body
[10:08] he continued to pray for the sick and
[10:10] suffering until one two and sometimes
[10:12] three o'clock in the morning then
[10:15] Reverend Brown would lead him numb in in
[10:17] a haze of exhaustion to his hotel room
[10:20] where he would catch a half-dozen hours
[10:22] of fitful sleep one morning Reverend
[10:25] Brown woke him up to an emergency
[10:28] there's a mr. Kinney downstairs from
[10:31] Memphis Tennessee it seems his friend
[10:33] mr. D I want to break from the text here
[10:36] to explain that the letter D is used as
[10:38] a choice by brother Owen Jorgensen
[10:41] because brother Brennan did not disclose
[10:43] the name of the person so it is a
[10:46] generic identifier who is a postmaster
[10:51] there in Memphis he's dying with
[10:53] asthmatic pneumonia mr. Kinney flew up
[10:56] here to ask you to come pray for mr. D
[10:58] mr. Kinney had already booked you as
[11:01] seat on the plane to fly you over to
[11:03] Memphis this morning you should be able
[11:05] to get back by the time the meeting
[11:07] starts tonight I'll go downstairs and
[11:09] bring him up
[11:10] bill dressed and had him put on his coat
[11:13] while he heard the sound of a strong
[11:15] wind he assumed it was outside and he
[11:18] thought my it's awful windy today then
[11:21] he saw that supernatural light in his
[11:23] room hanging in the air rotating and
[11:26] pulsating with energy bill knelt by the
[11:28] bed soon he heard the voice of that
[11:31] angel say do not go there his time has
[11:35] come
[11:35] then the light vanished bill got up and
[11:39] took off his coat a few minutes later
[11:41] Reverend Brown returned with a man who
[11:44] looked stressed and anxious brother
[11:46] Branham my name is Kenny my friend mr. D
[11:49] is unconscious now but I've got faith
[11:52] that God can bill interrupted him sir
[11:56] the Holy Spirit just met me a few
[11:58] minutes ago and warned me not to go with
[12:00] you for thus saith the Lord the man is
[12:03] going to die you mean there's no hope he
[12:07] might be dead and when you return but
[12:09] I'll keep praying for him until I hear
[12:11] from you call me in the morning and let
[12:13] me know his condition never mind call me
[12:15] tonight because I'll be in the service
[12:17] until three o'clock at two or three
[12:19] o'clock in the morning that night after
[12:21] several hours of constant prayer for the
[12:24] sick

[58:59] okay Lilly go ahead guys take it away
[59:02] tell us the true story that happened in
[59:04] the Bible okay let's see sure let's see
[59:09] what's our story should I tell all right
[59:15] Daniel in the daunt Lions Den it is okay
[59:19] let's see it starts out when King Darius
[59:22] decided he needed some help to rule the
[59:24] people of Babylon Daniel had been the
[59:27] highest ruler in the kingdom under the
[59:30] previous king so of course because
[59:33] Daniel does such a good job Daniel did
[59:36] King Darius asked Daniel and two other
[59:39] man to rule under him oh what a great
[59:43] Kingdom we have for it is rich and
[59:45] prosperous with many people living in it
[59:48] well yes King Darius is under your
[59:51] protection I need help to reign over
[59:54] this land for I cannot do this all by
[59:56] myself I will put you Daniel and two
[59:58] other governors as rulers to help me
[1:00:00] reign this kingdom all right King Darius
[1:00:03] I will assist you but Daniel you are
[1:00:08] going to be my top adviser and ruler
[1:00:10] over the entire kingdom Thank You King I
[1:00:13] appreciate it when the two other rulers
[1:00:19] heard the news they got really upset
[1:00:21] because Daniel was so honest
[1:00:24] hard-working and faithful so they were
[1:00:27] jealous of him and wanted to do
[1:00:29] something about him can you believe King
[1:00:34] Darius
[1:00:36] I know promoting Daniel as his top ruler
[1:00:40] over all the kingdom why does King
[1:00:45] Darius find favor to him over us it's
[1:00:47] not right it's because he sees Daniel as
[1:00:54] a goody two-shoes we must develop a plan
[1:00:58] to dethrone his rule his role as top
[1:01:00] ruler we should but how I have an idea
[1:01:05] we need to find some charge against him
[1:01:07] concerning this kingdom what kind of
[1:01:10] charge
[1:01:11] Daniel is so faithful he has no faults
[1:01:14] we might not find any charge against
[1:01:17] Daniel unless we find it against him
[1:01:19] concerning the law of his God let's go
[1:01:22] commencing King Darius about a new
[1:01:24] decree
[1:01:25] to extract over his kingdom that's
[1:01:27] certainly to get rid of Daniel two
[1:01:32] advisers went to King Darius and
[1:01:35] explained your idea to him
[1:01:43] nice to see you rulers again why do it
[1:01:46] why do you rush to my place so quickly
[1:01:48] is there an urgent news about my kingdom
[1:01:52] yes sir
[1:01:53] we are discussing with the other
[1:01:56] councillors and rulers to build you a
[1:01:59] real statue to make a firm decree in
[1:02:05] order to increase loyalty in your
[1:02:07] kingdom
[1:02:07] you should extract a law that orders
[1:02:10] everyone to pray to you and forbids
[1:02:13] people from praying to other gods if
[1:02:16] they pray to another God they should be
[1:02:19] thrown into the Lions Den the law is
[1:02:22] written here
[1:02:52] sorry guys you kind of messed up I hold
[1:02:55] on okay
[1:03:00] [Applause]
[1:03:09] now when Daniel heard about the new
[1:03:13] decree he went home to his room and with
[1:03:16] the windows open he nailed down on his
[1:03:19] knees and prayed and gave thanks to God
[1:03:21] three times a day as he would always do
[1:03:25] every day he did not change his habit oh
[1:03:28] god I thank you every day Lord help my
[1:03:33] people Lord thank you for every day of
[1:03:36] my life Lord and I will serve you with
[1:03:38] all my heart why do you come to why do
[1:03:48] you come to rush to me so quickly
[1:03:57] it's about Daniel he prayed to his God
[1:04:02] last night and broke the law about
[1:04:06] praying to another God except you Daniel
[1:04:09] he's a good man
[1:04:11] I can't throw them into the lion's den
[1:04:13] your laws can not change and you can't
[1:04:16] overlook this one instant throw him into
[1:04:19] the Lions Den bring Daniel and cast him
[1:04:23] to the lines then for he has broken a
[1:04:25] law under my decree the two wicked
[1:04:31] jealous rulers who despised Daniel
[1:04:34] quickly rushed to tell King Darius about
[1:04:36] Daniel's crime Oh Daniel I'm sorry for
[1:04:43] this your God for whom you serve
[1:04:45] continually he will deliver you it's a
[1:04:49] right King I understand but I have them
[1:04:52] haven't done no wrong but I'll accept my
[1:04:55] mistake
[1:05:09] as Daniel went cast into the line stand
[1:05:13] overnight King Darius was devastated
[1:05:16] that Daniel had to be thrown into the
[1:05:18] Lions stance the king could not eat or
[1:05:21] sleep all night at dawn he ran to the
[1:05:24] line stand to check on Daniel
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:06:39] Daniel has your God protect you from the
[1:06:41] dangerous lions as King Darius look into
[1:06:57] the lion's den he said he saw Daniel was
[1:07:03] alive and the Lions had not threatened
[1:07:05] Daniel the whole time he was there for
[1:07:08] God had protected him that night and
[1:07:10] Daniel replied to the king
[1:07:23] my god I said the angel and shut the
[1:07:28] mouth of the Lions they have no they
[1:07:30] haven't heard me because I found
[1:07:31] anything in his side no I have ever done
[1:07:34] any wrong before you King
[1:07:35] oh great joy I have for God has
[1:07:40] protected you in the lion's den now
[1:07:42] those rulers who have accused you for
[1:07:44] breaking the law I will command that
[1:07:46] they get thrown in the line stand with
[1:07:48] their families for you are innocent for
[1:07:51] I will make a decree that everyone in
[1:07:53] this kingdom fears and trembles and
[1:07:54] follows the god of Daniel for he is a
[1:07:57] living God amen god bless you all
