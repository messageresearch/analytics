um the author of that song she went to a pastor a minister and she expressed on her heart she said I want to be saved what do I do to be saved how am I to dress to be saved the minister looked at her and said just as you are just as you are so simple just as you are sir God bless you could you please stand for the reading the word be in Isaiah chapter 1 verse two vers hear o heavens and give ear o Earth for the Lord has spoken I have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me the ox knows its owner and they ask its Master's crib but Israel does not know my people do not consider oh sinful Nation a people lading with an equity a seed of evildoers children that are corruptors they have forsaken the Lord they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger they are gone away backward why should you be stricken anymore why should you be stricken anymore why you will Revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint 16 wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widows come now and let us reason together says the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they shall be red like Crimson they shall be as wool Heavenly Father Lord I come before you Lord I Surrender myself to you lord lord may you have control of the service Lord may you move and seek everybody's hearts Lord we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come now let us reason it the word says come now the reason I chose that is because it shows urgency when someone says come now it's because there is an emergency there's a sense of urgency because there is a message you need to hear because I see your condition because Israel is my first love but you're you're doing Abomination you're offering sacrifices your sacrifices mean nothing to me you're wrong from the head to the foot you're sick and it's come to the to to the sanctuaries your sacrifices mean nothing to stop come now let us reason there is an urgency to reason you know it's it's like when a man is doing wrong let's say ston is driving down the street and I break the law and the policeman is right behind me instead of stopping and talking to the police officer and reasoning with him our choices is that we run from the police officer not that you may run but we may run I would like to say today the holy spirit is like the policeman today he sees you doing wrong the light goes off or the siren will go off and you know what that siren means you quickly look look around it means it's the police he's an upholder of the law now God who written the law with the very finger of his hand you follow me now the police officer if you run from him you continue to run charges will amount if you fail to stop you will get a felony flight and then if you argue with him and if he tries to give you a ticket then you add another felony then if he's had it with you and he says step out the car and you're trying to challenge him he will take you down that's another choice another felony that's a felony after felony that's how Israel was doing they were out of their mind yet God has sent a prophet and this Prophet is is a Grace Prophet brother said this man was a Grace Prophet Israel and said come let us reason come now not tomorrow I've I've talking to a few people he said one time I'll let the cat out of the bag then my brother came to me and I said ah ston I want to be just like you when I get a job I'm going go to church so I could pay tithing and I'll give my life to the Lord step back I said sorry I said but you don't want to be like me and I don't want you to be like me I want you to be like Jesus don't wait until you get a job because we know you can't work the reason why because you haven't come to reason you haven't come to your senses don't lie to yourself Come As You Are a man running from the police or a woman or a family or mama or dad now to reason explain your action why did you do what you did come now let us reason what was your cause or motive what motivated you to do that come now let us reason the ability to think people have lost their minds and they're still losing their minds and you will never get into the right mind until you come to reason not with but with the Lord come now you come now and let us reason is that beautiful God beautiful that God was actually pleading with you come now and let us reason what is hard for God why do we suffer why do we stay there why do we stay in prisoned why do we allow the devil to tighten the handcuffs I have handcuffs imagin I'mma place them over my brother David's they're loose he can move he's come now let us reason don't come no come now let us reason come now first sin click second sin not that you're a sinner brother I'm going say a few things okay homosexuality C methamphetamine addiction click adultery Tighter and Tighter you're running and you're running you're not listening to me when I say come leton so now that the handcuffs are so tight you have nothing else to do but to be led by the one who has your handcuff I like to say there's this movie take it in have you seen Pinocchio how many said I want to be a real boy I want to be a real boy one of his homies says oh you going to be a real man just hit this pipe drink this sixpack let's watch these movies and then more he said all right I know it's wrong this doesn't feel right but he still kept on doing it he still kept on doing it and the more he kept on doing it then a tail came out oh what's going on and then all the boys started became growing ears and then their face became like a donkey then before they knew it they were Satan slaves he chained them up whipped them he drove them to what he wanted them to do and all they could do daddy mommy daddy and there is no mama there was no Daddy there was no God there there was nobody Pinocchio escaped I know it sounds blasphemy but it fits perfect L because when you don't come and reason it's an urgency come us you and I you and God reason it out let's get it over with and done with only one who could come and release you from his bounds almighty God because you choose to do you can't do it on your own because then if you still do it on your own turn another page tomorrow it's the same thing now you got a ball and chain on your leg now you're dragging this now you're dragging that sin and the burden becomes heavier you get further and you get further and he gets further away from God God is still calling you now let us reason together there's no reason why you need to stand and suffer there's only one person that can set you free and you say oh brother I don't have no handcuffs on me your handcuffs are in your mind he got you Shackled he's got you while the minister and the Holy Spirit is coming down you're sitting there in the bench laughing at the Holy Spirit look at brother yeah I already said come now let us reason there's only one way only one way your way has gotten you deeper and deeper he gotten us deeper and deeper there's only one person that could come down come to your heart not brother while faith will come and come by hearing another word I'm here to raise your faith you're not the only one has gone through things but I don't want you to go what a St went through for you to go through it because God sent a prophet and he said Grace Grace Grace there's Grace for you Grace for you you never you'll never dry up Grace they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be I'm G pick on you again you're gonna be my help I like David will I'm sorry David I'm talking about David right now David all right David David God God loved David of his own ey how could David be the apple of his own eye David confesses in Isaiah chapter 40 not only did God bring him out from the myy clay set his feet upon a rock but later on down he says evil has encompassed me and has taken hold of me and my iniquities outnumber the hairs of my head so much that I can't even lift my head up high I can't even lift my head up high but I'm needing you Lord Del me from this sinful flesh how could it be isn't that awesome how how much grace am come now let us reason together the holy spirit is the policeman today the lights been flashing Sirens been going and school is going to start and I'm expressing myself because you are going to face a legion of demons and a legion of demons are waiting for you each person is a spirit and then each person is governed by a spirit or Spirits so there is a legion waiting for you and watching seeking to devour you but he will not because in the scripture Satan is walking about like a seeking whom he may devour brother Alex used this in many sermons I said it's in the word whom he may and I stopped right there why is it say May because you give him the permission to try to devour you to torment you but it's time now it's time that we start shouting at the Devil not shouting at the Shout at the Devil yeah yeah bend your head I'm saying Shout at the Devil you have no part in me leave me Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ start invoking the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no matter what happens what comes against you if you plant your foot there's going to be a battle he's going to make you try and move as long as you plant your feet you don't back up you'll defeat him in the name of the Lord Jesus according to your faith that you planted your foot on a rock and if you haven't done that today if you haven't come to reason with God lord Jesus I Need You Lord I'm unlean Lord there's nothing good in me but there is one that is good and that is you I need you I need your power in me give me the new birth you know what you don't you're still going to have troubles when you have a new birth because Satan's always there to try you see if it's not some jail house religion the reason I said that is because I've had two or three instances that old homies one that got out of prison and he came to my house and he said hey also hey man what's up and I said oh I'm not also I'm Stan and he goes oh yeah I heard man he just wanted to see if I would respond to that name man what's up man you know what's up whatever but I told him I'm a now I says I'm with the Lord now he goes yeah I heard he said and I told him this ain't no jail house religion said before you say it and he said well what is it man I said it's the Holy Ghost fell backwards I said it's the Holy Ghost that's what I'm talking about that's what we need today I ran into another one he used to be a really really good Chum close guy saw me with my backpack at school had a beard he said oh and I I stopped and I was cringed and I turned around I said oh what's up Miguel I called him by his name you can't hide in that beard I tried I said the way you walk I said well there's I have a different walk but but the Lord touched me right here I used to walk like I was cool or I used to walk like you're my next victim but God got a hold of me not only did he touch me Satan thought that he was doing his own work but God used him and his agent to slow me down and put me on my back which allowed brother matya brother to come to my bedside I will never forget that through my life that meant the world to me man I was strung out my leg was opened up I just got out of emergency I almost died seven transfusions my hair sticking up all pale and yeah they came brother Paul says don't you know God is calling you I put my head down I said yes I know but I didn't say anything else but you know this and that and right in my right in there they prayed for me I lifted my my arms and I surrendered in that bed it wasn't over then it wasn't over then but s Satan s another Thorn at my side and it stirred me up that anger took over and revenge set in he was saying come now let us reason I would like to for you to hear a word from Brother brandham souls in prison can you please what a difference it was from the vision I had here not long ago of being in glory with the people the contrast but in this as I was falling I finally I I scream for my daddy of course being just a kid that's what I would do I scream for my daddy and my daddy wasn't there I scream for my mother somebody catched me there was no mother there I was just going and I scream then to God there was no God there there was nothing there and after a while I heard the most mournful sound that I ever heard and it was the office feeling there's no way even a literal burning fire would be a pleasure to the side of what this was now those Visions has never been wrong and it was just one of the most horrible feelings I ever had and what did I heard a noise sound like some kind of a a a haunted Affair and when it was I looked coming and it was women and they had green stuff yes you just see their face and they had green stuff under their eyes and their eyes look like run back like a the women to he pain their eyes run back like that and just their eyes and face and they were going oh my I just screamed out oh pap in there is a prison there is a spiritual prison and many people are in it right now because they didn't come to reason they didn't come to estan they didn't come to the feet of the Lord Brother Bram says that we fight our way we don't get taken to hell we fight our way all the way to hell we don't set I have nieces I have nephews if I can fight this battle that they are facing but it's not a flesh and blood battle I would fight it for them I I can't do it for them but there is one who has fought it who has conquered who went to the cross shed his blood so that you may have a chance eternal life don't deny it come now let us reason together you and the Lord amen there was no age limit 5 years old 10 years old you could be in your 50s and 60 or 70 and if you never had an encounter with the Lord come to reason with God it's Grace it's Grace that you've reached that age and been able to reach it with no problems I told my niece I don't know if I told her I watch the news all the time too and I hear about young kids about 16 years old in the timee of their life this girl was in a prime of her life training for a marathon running this marathon training

store but I got to have it Mama I need to have it I heard the correct word if you need it and if you have to have it that's what we need to do to Papa God is that we need to open our mouth because right now we suffer but we suffer because we don't open our mouth we open our mouths to do other things and we allow curses and bad things to come out but we need to learn to open our mouth need to learn how to cry we have the right to cry because that's God's provided way for his children to C I wish Amia was here because when he was a little baby he used to cry follow me and me being out of my head at that time too hard I used to tell him man up stop you're crying says stop being a and he had every right to cry because God provided him a way to get what he needed daddy's not around Mama's not around St was there time to shut up that was the worst thing I could ever do a thought came to me yesterday and it said Emilio had every right to cry and I was too hard to recognize pick up my own nephew show him the love that he needed let's not make that mistake let us cry out to God we need to cry the reason you're still out of your mind because you laugh and you doubt God you need to cry out and ask for deliverance first Lord there's nothing good in me get closer right I need you Lord I remember I died right here I screamed like a maniac when the pillar of fire came out when the pillar of fire came down I said the same person that received the Holy Ghost in prison I said that's what I need and a fiery flame came down and came into my heart and exploded and I died right here like a mad man crying out when I was young I used to play with the neighbors we used to play sports in the front yard I'm still innocent I'm still innocent the blood of Jesus was still and then we got

knees I went again to watch it and that demon like the policeman felony after felony to stop God's call stay with me until the day of my Deliverance right there in the back of that se a maniac a
