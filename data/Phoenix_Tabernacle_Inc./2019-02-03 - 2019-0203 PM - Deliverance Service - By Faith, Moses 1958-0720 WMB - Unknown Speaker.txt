one more time without the music amen Oh in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful Shore in the sweet thank you very much good morning folks it's good to be here today in the tabernacle and I thought maybe if I got brother Neville to speak this morning I tried tonight and then I was looking back then to a Sunday School lesson for this morning and what a the Lord willing we'll try to to have this Sunday School lesson now it is bent in two weeks now about since I have gotten in and been very nervous as you understood that on the field I got real real worn out and could hardly go any farther and then I had to come in for just a little arrest and I've taken about three days down to Wolf Creek Dam down in Kentucky where I was born I thought oh I feel just wonderful now I'm fine I got back home and the first little thing met me in the face with some sort of a governmental affair with an income tax I went all the way at the bottom and so I realized it's going to take more than just a week or two to rest me up my ministry fixing to make the change now I have no meetings scheduled and that's the reason that I just kind of come aside and thought and now for the next few weeks I would just take a rest complete rest and wait on the Lord and many of you people in here as old-timers has been with us so long remembers that what the Lord has said to us he has always performed that walk he that he would do I remember when in the very beginning in the church here the morning we laid the tabernacle stone how that he throat laying in the stone on the Flyleaf or my Bible that morning that great vision that this is not your Tabernacle I said where is it Lord and set me out of the skies and a voice came I look and seen them three crosses like the trees and the fruit of them so forth you know what the vision is has been wrote out for years picking up the other day book up there reading some of the things that the Lord had told foretold already come to pass about this juvenile on stuff but about how the war would come out and all those things has hit just the two things left in one of those great prophecies that is for cars to be on the road with remote control we're looking like a age only you don't drive it it controls itself and then there will be a great woman rise up calls America is a woman's nation and it'll a great woman rise up and be President or something like that in the nation and then there will come a total annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out and that I predict now this is not the large saying this the other about the woman it is is the Lord but I predicted in nineteen and and thirty 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77 so I didn't know then that they had something that could annihilate it like they got now but I sing the nation and total annihilation just stump some trees and things like that play so it's on its Road and if all these other things has come to pass just as he said that will be also that just as he said in the scripture here what he says if Christ came the first time he'll come the second time all the things that he said will come to pass and duly seeing this and knowing that where our number is just about to be called as a nation knowing that the church is about to take its rapture it moves a heart of a minister or any of the laity to know that we're in this day and time that we're living it's the greatest time that any person ever lived on the earth is right now that is for the church so I certainly desire your prayers and then I seen in the tabernacle and I've seen if it was going to have some re-elections and everything in the church or some of the board and so forth and so and the church needs a little meeting a little stirring and you've always been kind to me and bless me and my made years seem has been a blessing to you and I'm sure to be with you has been a blessing to me and you've always accepted what I said to be the truth as I've seen it through God and I appreciate that so then I started in and then was to find out and get to a church straighten up in its boards and then for the elections and so forth and then then I thought after that I went out got a little rest before I go back on the field again keep it among yourselves now it's not for outsiders it's far this Tabernacle we want a meeting but this Tabernacle so that everything and every mistake all things has been carrying on and maybe little feelings from one to another those I'm going to get every one of them bring them right face to face so if you don't want to face it you better leave the country cause you're coming face to face with every bit of it like we used to do here at the tabernacle and all of these foods out because we are brothers and sister who's broke communion the body of Christ across the table of blessings and there's nothing but the devil would make anything that would be wrong and would cause feelings or tear up or anything like that and taking our brother Neville and we're going from place to place and bring people to people together for the old Tabernacle is back established again on its feet to go along for the kingdom of God now this is reason I said this is because it was our own little group here this morning and I'm going to give some rest and get back just as quick as I can then I expect to leave to the field again and this time the Lord willing I want to take what little we have accumulated and funds and so forth myself out in the this foreign mission program and get me a new tent and some new equipment and star on the field up from church to church but they're going in our own meetings now not no disregarding two brethren who has invited me which is wonderful but most all of it you find out these conventions they say you're going to be there and then all your friends come in and then it's a whole lot of big drumming for money just dreams those people down I just begin to find that out to see so that's that's not right we want to have a place where we can bring them you don't have bring your money just come along yourself and and serve the Lord's here and so now in my ministry is taking a change right now you remember when I used to take a whole the person's hand just stand there and the Lord but tell me what was their trouble said then it would come to pass you know the secret of the heart of the people every one of you know that's happened just perfectly the way it said now this is the next step which has been prophesied and foretold which is gonna be far beyond any other it you see and it's write down the change and that's reason Satan Spike Lee with the income-tax trying to tell me that a government I only income tax on every penny I've taken up as a minister since 27 years or going into the ministry it's not so-called surpassed in the church I am the trustee of this church that's exactly right it's on the records here so then if I am the trustee treasurer of this church and there's nothing the world government don't have nothing to do with that they're not question the church they're question me being the treasurer of the church and the trustee is assigned a paper that's in the bank under that all my funds instead of having a foundation of my own passed it through my church here because it's automatically a foundation anyhow and to do that helps me to keep them running away from the church and leaving going on out and being nothing here after I promised the people that I would return to the church time after time and help them that's reason I kept it like that because I made a promise to you people that's why I stay with it that way instead of having a individual thing to do that just throws it to an organization and I'm firmly against organization so I keep it just the way it is in the hands of God so that we can move on to the kingdom of God now this morning we want to study this blessed old word and believe that I want to say too I see brother Eagan and many of some of the trustees sitting here actually had our trustee meeting the other night it is true publicly before the church that each one of y'all are no longer appointed trustees you are in lek kid trustees and your name is on the books all right and now they're going to have some more election of Deacons and so forth and brother Neville is will be calling those and meetly after this service all right for the treasurer and so forth as we set the church up get it all the backgrounds ready then we have a revival as it comes on now just before we turn back to the pages here for our Sunday School lesson through this great Word of the Living God let us just bow our heads a few moments as we speak to the author of this book and I'll lay aside every thought everything that's contrary to keep you from having a blessing let's pray most holy and righteous God into the Blessed August presence we come now offering to thee our lives and our our souls and our bodies and our services and our talents all that we have we present them to thee and as you look upon us Lord if there is any sin naked and unconfessed we would ask the old Lord God that you would apply the blood of thy Son Jesus to such a place for realizing that we and ourselves are insufficient and there it is impossible for us to ever be self-sustaining but we rely completely upon his precious blood and His grace to apply to our account that we unworthy sinners might come boldly someday into that presence bringing before us this blood of the Lord Jesus which that are in the time past has recognized that to be the blood of thy only begotten son and has made the promise that through him if we confess our sins we shall be justified by His grace and now we would ask Lord that you would forgive us of any mistakes any sin of just pass our omission transgression that of any evil thought as a pierced are sold by the fiery darts of the devil that you would drive away this evil enemy of mine and of thy people and we would ask that you would send the Holy Spirit to take hold of the word at this time as we yield ourselves as instruments that you would speak to us and hear through us thy word and may we in return receive it as from thee and leave this place today feeling that we have been readjusted to the cause of Christ that we might be better fit for the service of tonight and tomorrow because of the visitation of the Holy Spirit that's our brethren everywhere the churches across the world whose holding forth the word of life in this evil day we feel that there is not much time left to work or the night is swiftly coming the war clouds are floating again evil is at hand and we pray that you'll let us work as never before rest our tired bodies Lord send us back into the battle or we asked it in the name of the Lord Jesus and for his sake we pray amen as we open this morning the Bible to the 11th chapter of the book of Hebrews Wednesday night we were speaking on the seventh chapter of the book of Hebrews of Melchizedek being without father without mother without beginning of days are ending of life and I thought maybe this morning it would be appropriate to open again this wonderful book being that we have the backgrounds to what we wish to stay in the farmer readings and skipping over the tenth chapter in the ninth chapter which is the sacrificial laws we would come into a spot of faith and here in the book of Hebrews the eleventh chapter and beginning with the 23rd verse we read it like this by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment by faith Moses when he came to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt and had recompense unto the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisibly I want to take the subject this morning choosing by faith now I want to take for a text the first three words of the 23rd chapter by faith Moses and choosing by faith most everything that we do we have to choose by faith and all that we find that Moses did that's worth repeating was by faith not by sight but by faith and the reason I have selected this this morning for the church in this state has been that in ours even our schools and around we have said so much of scientific teaching because of this we have drawn the people away from faith now faith is not proved by science faith is what science doesn't see and we if we ever lose this great faith then we are totally in darkness yet no matter how well we are educated how we could explain the Word of God to suit our own way of believing there is no way to ever please God only by faith the scripture plainly states it that way and it's by faith and without faith says the scripture it is impossible to please God so if faith disagrees with science and science disagrees with faith that put standard at age at each other then we must take a choice as Moses did by faith we believe now if we loose faith then we will never get a prayer answered by God for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him so if we lose faith our prayers are on all we get nowhere so it's all that we can think of this morning is to hold on to faith then if we lose faith all our hopes is gone and if we lose faith all our spiritual reality is gone or you cannot have faith in things that you see for the things that you see are all perishable if we look at some great person a great minister are a great congregation they will all perish someday and if we look at a great nation our great weapon they'll all perish someday and then we must live by faith of those things that science does not declare it's by faith that we believe now we lose our glory if we lose faith now if we get away from faith then we take the church into an intellectual ground and many times that's been thought most people that because a congregation was large and they had great churches great steeples and the great lot of well dressed and groomed people's and a lot of finances that they could afford such things we many times thought that was inspiring that this certain church must be inspired or we've often referred to different ministers who get out on the field and have gray galleries of crowds and we think sometimes that they are the signs of inspiration but that's not altogether the truth that's human inspiration but the real inspiration comes by doing the will of God the whether it is at one are just a handful whether it is a big church are a small church it matters not whether he is a great eloquent speaker are just a man that hardly knows his ABCs it doesn't matter it depends on the message that he's breathe whether it is inspired by the Word of God our isn't inspired by intellectual conceptions of human inspiration some people can be inspired because of an eloquent speaker that doesn't make it right sometimes are inspired because the man is so trained Deegan putty spawn over that doesn't mean that it's of God the it's only two God's everlasting eternal blessed word can we receive inspiration and that's given by the Holy Ghost by faith we receive it now we would think of Moses and this great time of his life and we read back up his birth and how that God had cared for him but there come a time in Moses life to where there had to be a choosing time if we read right we find out that he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter and was the heir to the throne and would have been the next Pharaoh in Egypt don't he would notice as he looked around after he come of age and other countability and that would be those slaves working out of the slime pits and Moses as he looked through the windows of the palace of all the same slaves that payroll looked down but what a difference there was in the looking I want to base that thought this morning for a few minutes and may the God of heaven drive it home to Everhart here it's how you look at anything what makes the difference yes the gate evangelist John SPRO which was a convert of brother Bosworth ministry who many of you remember years ago of the Old Glory bar he said one day he was taking a tip before the deceased the obvious beloved companion and wife they were in La Salle Lorraine's France and I had the privilege of visits in the same place and the guide was taking them out through the gardens and showing them different things and they come upon a certain statue of Lord Jesus the crucifixion and mr. Sproule was standing off looking at it he and his wife and in their hearts were criticizing what the artist must have had in mind are the sculpture rather when he hewed out of a stone such a hard one looking fain to be to represent the suffering and the love and the pity of the Lord Jesus and how it was all crudely and chopped up looking and the guide came to mr. Sproule and he said sir I suppose that you are criticizing this statue of the Lord Jesus and he said I am and he said I am NOT a bit surprised because most people that look at it first they do criticize it and mr. Sproule said but I can't see any pity or any inspiration from looking at such a thing so I'm wondering why the sculpture every made it like this and the sculpture said mr. stone this statues all right and the sculpture had the right thing in his mind but where the trouble is is with you it's the way you're looking at it and he took he and his wife by the hand and led them down to a altar at the foot of this said cross and he said now mr. Sproule look up now and when he looked up he said his heart like Jim failed him what a difference it was to spend off there and look at it that way and you then look at it the way that it was made to look at and that's the way that God is that's the way that faith is it's the way you look at it if you look at it as some sort of a historical Bible of something that was in the days gone by you will never be able to get the real value of the Bible you are supposed to get on your knees and obey the commandments of this Bible and look at it to the eyes of the Holy Spirit I would ask this audience this morning what good does a historical God do us today if he isn't the same God what good doesn't God that would take Moses and do the miracles within that he did what good for to do us the read of such a God if he isn't the same one today what good is a God that could deliver from the fiery furnace the Hebrew children if he isn't the same gun today what good is a God that would judge between right and wrong in a day gone by and British the wrong and bless the right if he isn't the same God today what do we go to church father body we've stained from things of the world if he isn't the same God of the same judgment and the same opinion that he always was what good would it be for God who could touch a woman's hand with a raging fever and the fever stopped he isn't the same God today what good will be the serve of God who could call his friend from a grave after being dead for days if he isn't the same God today our faith we believe that some glorious day he shall call us from the earth shall we be a spoonful of ashes again how do we prove it we do not prove it we believe it we're not asked to prove anything we're asked you'd believe it by faith Moses did such and such and as Moses as a young man looked through the palace winter at the srage he saw the same bunch of grabbing dirty mop ridden slaves at Pharaoh's saw and when Pharaoh looked upon him in the Egyptians they wasn't nothing but a bunch of slaves that's all they were good for just to be human mud dobbers to make money bricks for the benefit of the cities that payroll was building that's the way more of the Egyptians and they roll look at the slaves but Moses when he looked at him it was a different look Moses head when he's seen passing by the window the great ditches in their face but tears that run down their cheeks enter the bodies he looked upon them and the people of God he didn't look upon his slaves he looked upon as the chosen people of God though I go about from country to country and from nation to nation preaching then sound left the doors of this little tabernacle that's an interdenominational institution but no law but love no book but the Bible in old treatment Christ I've tried to look upon God's children but upon the rejected and being got chosen and elected people I don't ask them if they've gone to the banham tabernacle I don't ask them if they're Methodist sorry if there are Presbyterians or if they are Pentecostals our Nazarenes are pilgrim Holiness I just spoke to look up public health of people of God I'm seeing their doings in their sessions that they are the servants of the Lord God and my heart desires fellowship with them no matter what brand they got I just long for their fellowship I love them because I know they are people of God we're gonna see a woman coming down the street with the long skirt her hair done up neatly in the back end and a decent-looking vests on and I see another young lady maybe their same age with a little parish charts home she may be in looks twice as pity as a woman with the long hair according to the looking of the world but I can't shut up with that girl that's dress like a Christian though they'd be laughing at her and calling her a fanatic yet I take my side she might not be as pretty as the other girl feature Lee but she sees something bad faith she sees him who is invisible who is guiding her life when I see the man on the job being called deacon or feature are automatic because he refuses to smoke and to drink beer and to go to dances like the rest of them and he's called a fanatic our heart goes out for him he is my brother that alone in this Egypt's oils that makes our heart long to him brace him and say brother we are pilgrims and strangers of this land and I long to fellowship with you mowers has had to make a choice choosing my faith how many young men would have jumped at the opportunity to become the son of Pharaoh's daughter how many young men would have jumped at the opportunity that Moses had to enjoy all the pleasures and the glamour of the world to become the king of Egypt then the whole world at his feet what a foolish thing that the young man of his days must've thought when Moses chose to think is place with the affected and suffering people of God [Applause] why did he do it by faith when he lifted up his eyes he looked beyond the grammar of this world even beyond the pleasures of sin and the Bible said that he endured as seeing him who was invisible by faith and he made a choice served that God regardless of what took place it has not changed many of us could go to what we would call a better building we could enjoy it maybe the fellowship and pleasures of setting in a better Pew we might be more popular to drink and to smoke and to desin to like the world but what's the matter you've lifted up your eyes by the faith you see him who is invisible and a tough your stand with the rejected and so-called holy rulers of the day bar by faith we see him who is invisible choosing to suffer the persecutions and the affections I wouldn't say to people that they should choose to be afflicted I don't say that you should choose suffering it would not be the human thing to do but if suffering lays in the path of Duty then let's take it as it comes I don't want you to do something for somebody to make fun of you I would want you to say a different things that I'm blown to a church that doesn't believe in so-and-so in the worlds and things like that just to get people to make fun of you you're bringing that on yourself I wouldn't say for you get out here carry along and do something and that was radical I wouldn't want you to do that so that somebody would say that you are a fanatic you bring that on yourself but if it lays in the path of your duty towards but let the world say what they want to say you make a choice every man and woman has to make this what do you feel could have saw what Moses saw he saw the sufferings of the people he knew what the price was to pay but by faith he chosen rather than to have the pleasures of seeing is maybe a little young lady sitting here that's grammar song women the world would like to say to you dude us and us you are beautiful your body is so pretty shape you should show that my sister raise up your eyes and look beyond that to him that said it's an abomination or a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man if those men of the people in your community if the women that you associate with said cut that long hair off it would be cooler it would be this better yet Arya would be calm you better don't you listen to that you lift up your eyes about face saw him that said the woman's hair is her glory and she not cut it if they say it'll be popular you were standing better with your job or with your boss if you take a sociable drink if you would smoke cigarettes like the rest of the women you were standing more socially in your neighborhood by faith raise your rounds and look the Hebrew census how this body and I'll will destroy it uh-uh faith we believe those things it's nothing that you see it's something you believe our faith Moses did and in this faith walk there comes a time there has to be a choice Locke made that sadness faith that we make a lot of times we choose for our own good we choose things that would be a better sometimes it's a little squabble come from the church and someone would say well the deacon are the pastor's on this side don't look at that look at what's righteous get that thing out and bring up all together that's lovely there's a choosing and we choose for ourselves we choose something is for our own good but Moses chose the affections and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of God think of it now listen to me chose the afflictions of the people of God and counted at a greater treasure or he endured seeing him who was invisible II know lot one time had to make a choice and it made me this morning that there will be many women sitting here that'll make your final choice you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now and what you choose now will determine what you'll be five years from today of yours today you may be a missionary five years today you may be a renowned Christian our five years today who may be in hell because you make the wrong decision five years today you may be cleanest pick tunes in a barroom five years today may be a prostitute on the street are you may be a maid or whether that's a that's a credit to any society the cause of your choice for Christ five years today you may be in glory gone in the rapture because you made your choice today but you've got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that will count is what you choose by faith look as he had to make a choice Abraham give not his choice and God gives you your choice choose you this day whom ye shall serve in the Garden of Eden there was a tree of knowledge and a tree of life man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so is it today you're giving your privilege as free moral agents to choose whatever you want to choose my advice to you is don't look at the modern things around you and the popularity and the glamour that you could be but choose right by faith him that give the promise that someday he will come and will write in all wrongs and go give you eternal life and raise you up don't matter if you take the despised way with the Lord you make that choice if there's troubles in the hand if there are troubles in the land if there's troubles in the church if there are troubles in the home no matter where it is make your choice by faith I'll serve God I'll humble my heart and his presence I'll take the way with God's children I'll see them despised and rejected and drove out and make father still take my post of duty I'll stay right by and when they crowd crowd with them and when their sorrow I feel sorrow with them the way they live I'll live like me one with cetera said to me oh my your ways beat my ways my ways be your ways where you live I live where you go I'll go let God that you serve be my god take that choice though it pulls a very skin off of your conscience I'm thinking it you're somebody skin yourself down and take your away with the Lord's dis past you and stay lying on the field of service and have the post of Duty not looked around he said I got a choice and he looked towards Sun he saw the good grassy fields were better than what Abraham saw and where Abraham was he saw the opportunities to graze his cattle that have fatter and better cattle I hope I'm not hurting anyone's feeling but that's been to stand up to many preachers the compromise with the gospel bacon if they get more money out of it [Applause] soda crackers then a compromise upon the condition of my faith in the Word of the Living God I'll take it away I'm upset Billy what's a night with your meeting as there's too many Pentecostals had a great denominational minister said that I said with your denomination sponsor my meeting not long ago in the Look magazine I believe there was an article and the writer centers talked about the Pentecostal people he said the Pentecostal church is the fastest growing Church in the world today why it's because men and women has raised up their eyes and the far off and the writer also complimented the Pentecostal people oh of course they said there were some of them went radical and so forth but the Methodists worship accreted they worship God by Creed the Baptist does the same in the Presbyterians but the Pentecostal worships by his Bible faith we see the promise I'll take my luck with them no matter how much they're despised I still wear them though they be made fun of it Heather ups and downs as Israel did I'll never want to spin with the false prophet on the hillside a bailment and try to curse what God has blessed because in that cape is a smitten rock and a bloody sacrifice I'm a pillar of fire no matter what there in its leading I'm home to victory and there got to come to it because they are the promised people that's walking path faith though they be not of the denomination they were wanders around and so as the people of God I don't want to take my way with him join up with them and their ranks not in their denomination but in their fellowship around the articles of God's eternal spirit which by faith I have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost god help you to always have an attitude notice as they moved on we find it locked tell the opportunities or a fatted cattle many see the opportunities of a fatted popular many seize the opportunities of a better social standing he saw the possibilities of a few extra dollars he saw the possibilities of being the mayor of the city being a stranger in a pretty smart man as he was maybe I will become the chief man of the city he saw the possibilities because they were laying before him but he did not see the fire that was to destroy them and he did not reconcile himself that the land was full of sin and God had to destroy it today people try to reconcile himself a same are you austere here Christian they said I'm an American that has the more to do with it or try to say to her crony was a frog it has nothing to do with it she's going to be this tribe that cause god it just and if America gets by with her since the Justin's sovereign holy God will be duty-bound to resurrect solving amore and apologize to them or bring them up because of their sin he lets us get by with it if he lets you get the heaven on your injustice works you'll have to raise up paradise and survive and give them another opportunity certain evil but he just and another source money here solve past oh my didn't see the destruction of he's shuddered in that place many of you holding around these old formal Creed's and things you don't see the juvenile delinquency and the destruction of your children you don't see your daughter in a prostitute house you don't see her son a drunkard I had a card table somewhere because she's well watered and sand is not touched he didn't see his wife the head of all the societies turned to a pillar of salt when he was looking he didn't see him escaping a homey father edge of his teeth to a little city somewhere for his life he didn't see that because he only looked at what he saw in front of him but Abraham he didn't notice the well for her land for he lifted up his eyes and saw the tomorrow or he had inherit all think he's the real Christian today lifts up his eyes and sees the promise of Christ blessed are the meek for they shall inherit all whole thing they shot the real fish in my faith looks up and sees that call him what you want to he lifted up his eyes and when he did that God said Abraham walk to the land she's all yours a faith Abraham did this the same faith that Moses had it was rock the one commentator that said this now I've thought of his most beautiful words but Abraham Moses took the best out of the world and put it in one scale and the worst out religion and put it in the other scale and the worst out religion outweighed the best the world so is it the case that if we be called anything we want to be called fanatics are the violent healers our Holy Roller whatever they wanted to call the worst that we are outweigh the best the world can afford wanna be called old-fashioned old fogey fanatic it'll outweigh the best pain that the devil's got to offer Oh surely Moses a speeding the reproach of Christ before Saul cries later he spoke some mighty inspiring words about him may the Lord your God shall rise up a prophet like unto me the newest foresaw and an esteemed his reproach greater riches than all the glamour of the world Christian friend today Cates you do that but all the glamour and popularity the world the faith we see him who promised and the worst of the church today in all of its condition yet it'll outweigh everything the devil can offer you if we are torn up that we are go to pieces then we are confused and broke up in denominations of fanaticism it will outweigh anything that devil can offer you certainly he esteem the reproach of Christ greater riches and all the treasures of Egypt then he had to do something he forsook Egypt oh I love that word he forsook Egypt he he was looking through the same window but he was looking different from failure what a pharaoh conceit he's in what a pharaoh would have seen his nation grounded moses saw how by science ah faith focuses on everything that he did was by faith because God promised Abraham father that he would he would visit the station at your for hundred years and would bring an iron Bob Moses disease the word that God said and note himself and my faith to be the chosen leader to bring them out he knew where he was he took his place in the slab pits as a mud dauber Canada reproach of Christ greater riches than the settling of tone of each he took he never instead I sympathize with him he took their place and went with them he took their place we went with them oh one of the inspired writers I'll take the way with the Lords despise you Oh starting with Jesus I'm going through I'm on my way to Caitlyn sure Moses it was said by one that Moses had rather but he could have been the son of pyram I have a glamour of the world he had rather be a son of Abraham than to be the son of payroll the son of Abraham the despised than to be son of fatal of the king I'm going to be the son of the Lord Jesus and his fellow servants and take my place with the rejected people of this world and to be president of this great United States of America are to be an Elvis Presley or Pat Boone or whoever you want to make it I'll take my way young ladies or to take their way and stand up in a a mary pickford her son great movies time some glitter girl paint your way with them or despise you I'd rather be a preacher in the pulpit preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ than to be a Hollywood movie star or the greatest person on the earth if I had to eat beggar whatever I do I'll take my way with the Lord my faith I do that I've been offered opportunities like by God's grace I still receive my faith by faith I can see it afar and our Father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place their need to come tax main city to date why did you turn your home to that church what made you give a 25 thousand dollar home to that little little rubbish looking Tabernacle I said it wasn't the church that I did it it's the people it's there I am NOT this world's good every penny of money I ever touched turned to this church Wow my faith Oh God and not on the things of this world affections are above and I believe yours are the same if you're right with God it's true that you are we by faith receive we by faith believe God Moses you had to make a choice and then he had to have to make it a choice he had to fight the faith or he feared not the wrath of the king I humanly he had a right to fear the wrath he had a right to fear the wrath of the king but he didn't he did not do it because he had a job to do and he was in a line of duty and he didn't care what the King said about he took his way just the same now if a rule of course when he sees he's defeated he wanted to give Moses and the children he said all right okay what I'll do you all just stay in the land go out and sacrifice to your God that's the way the devil works oh you can be religious once Coolridge aren't some church you don't have to do all these things a man says to his wife uh-huh otherwise says husband I gotta say no more manicure or lips drinking stuff no more

don't they don't have to do that over here they don't do this over here that's why you just go so far but he don't want you to get out of the land and that's why the devil does you don't want you to get out of the things of the world just bring the world in with the church another day coming down the road I've turned on my radio and there was a song and I kept listening I had to take the other songs through before I could tell whether it was absolutely a religious song or the devil is trying to bring down the pains of God to the level of the world you can't do that God be merciful I don't care how many elements Elvis Presley rights of all the good religious songs he still possessed of the devil he sent more children to hell and all the moves I know of in all the world in this day food in the rest of he clung to Church of Christ and Elvis Presley Pentecostals or Judas Iscariot in the form of those man the devil is trying to bring the higher things of God so that they can mix them down here that people won't look up above this they just look I see what's all the same it isn't the same get out of the land that you can just go a few days and you go stay in the land sure you know

your cattle back here you leave them here and you go out cause he know they had possession back there that would lure them back and that's what the devil says to you does long as you leave some of the things the world hang it on you still want to smoke you want to drink you want to dress like the world that's as good as the devil ones I hear so much about backslide not only bleeders and that's

penitent hearts and I'll mine also Lord that we all might look to God's glass of looking and see the rejected Church of the Lord Jesus the rejected people they rejected way and may we walk in this glorious way as Moses he didn't know where he was going the people didn't know where they were going they didn't know which way to go they just started and only Lord God as this beautiful hymn is being played by faith we can see that land afar let it be just now that man and women in Europe won't think of what the world's going to say or how they're going may they just rise in their spirit and go Moses followed the light and it led him to the land of promise not knowing where he was going but he just walked in the line that land that was fairer than day grant Lord the day that many here will walk in the light of the scripture and in the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost and with the church the church the first barn the new horn page that's received Christ had been filled with the Holy Ghost led by the spirit may we walk in his fellowship together around the articles of God serving him in baptism in obedience to his death burial and resurrection may we serve Him in his command Perry
