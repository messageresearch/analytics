[24:21] there's a Super Bowl game going on today
[24:23] right and that's that's the last I'm

[24:29] true
[24:31] champion our champion the Lord Jesus
[24:35] Christ The Mighty
[24:37] conqueror doesn't that sound like
[24:39] doesn't that sound
[24:41] awesome the mighty
[24:43] conqueror right right when you think of
[24:45] the mighty
[24:46] conqueror you think of maybe a knight
[24:49] dressed in his
[24:53] armor uh going out to slay the dragon
[24:56] right well that's what Jesus
[25:00] did and we're gonna we're gonna talk a
[25:02] little bit about that
[25:05] tonight about our
[25:07] champion and he should be everybody's
[25:10] Champion that is here
[25:13] tonight you know when you have a
[25:16] champion you can you can you you look up
[25:19] to that
[25:21] champion you want to be like that
[25:23] champion and there's no other champion
[25:25] in the
[25:26] world
[25:28] that I would want to be
[25:30] like but the Lord Jesus
[25:33] Christ you know and it's we're going to
[25:35] learn a little bit
[25:37] tonight on how we can be like
[25:40] him by just accepting his
[25:44] gift into our
[25:46] hearts and then watch with that
[25:50] gift in our hearts and the things that
[25:53] it Bears
[25:55] amen so we're going to talk a little bit
[25:57] about about
[25:58] him here in the
[26:00] scriptures so our first scripture is
[26:04] John uh
[26:07] 16 Verse
[26:12] 33 and the scripture reads like
[26:16] this these things I have spoken to you
[26:19] that in me you may have
[26:26] peace so so what what the scripture is
[26:29] telling us
[26:32] here is that these things were spoken
[26:35] unto
[26:38] us that in
[26:41] Jesus we may have
[26:44] peace do you know that there isn't there
[26:46] isn't an amount of
[26:49] money if people were to give you
[26:52] money and say I'm going to give you
[26:56] $1,000
[26:58] a million
[26:59] dollars and I'm going to take your peace
[27:01] from
[27:04] you it wouldn't be worth
[27:06] it peace is
[27:09] priceless to be at peace with
[27:13] yourself has no price you may say well
[27:17] you may be looking at me saying well
[27:18] brother Mike I don't know a million
[27:19] dollars can bring me a lot of
[27:23] Peace that's not the kind of pie that
[27:25] we're talking
[27:26] about
[27:30] let's read the second part in the world
[27:33] you will have Great
[27:40] Tribulation but it says be of good
[27:43] cheer I have overcome the
[27:49] world so so here the word of God is
[27:52] telling
[27:54] us that we live in a world where there's
[27:57] a lot of
[27:59] trouble yeah there's a lot of trouble a
[28:02] lot of things going
[28:04] on a lot of bad things going on a lot of
[28:08] people
[28:09] suffering and amongst all that
[28:12] stuff he brings us
[28:15] peace and he also tells us he says be
[28:20] happy be of good
[28:22] cheer I was in here on
[28:26] Earth and I overcame these
[28:33] things we can overcome the same
[28:38] things it's a very simple
[28:41] scripture but if we believe it with all
[28:44] of our
[28:45] hearts and understand and say Lord your
[28:48] scripture
[28:51] says that you can bring me
[28:54] peace I need peace Lord I'm always
[28:58] nervous
[28:59] Lord I'm
[29:01] scared this that or the
[29:03] other but you promise
[29:07] Lord and you know that he's
[29:10] truthful because Jesus don't tell little
[29:14] lies or big lies he always says the
[29:19] truth so let's go to our next
[29:22] scripture our next scripture is found in
[29:24] Philippians
[29:26] 4 Phil phili verse
[29:31] 13 so when we have Jesus right the
[29:36] scripture tells
[29:39] us I can do all things through Christ
[29:44] which strengthen
[29:48] me you can do anything in Christ which
[29:52] gives you strength did you know
[29:55] that yeah I see
[29:58] I see her nodding praise the Lord amen
[30:00] that's right there is nothing that can
[30:03] stand before
[30:05] you so if you trust in
[30:08] him he's going to give you
[30:11] peace in the times when there's great
[30:16] trouble he is going to strengthen
[30:20] you and see you
[30:24] through and you know it's not just for
[30:27] the for the little guys and and and
[30:28] little
[30:30] sisters for all of us
[30:33] all we go through different things in
[30:36] our
[30:38] lives oh man you know they they're
[30:41] they're they're laying off people at my
[30:46] job what am I going to
[30:49] do put it give it to the
[30:52] Lord and I promise where one door
[30:58] in your
[31:00] life he'll open another door
[31:03] for yeah that's
[31:06] right man I can be a witness to
[31:09] that amen so he is awesome amen is he
[31:14] your Champion
[31:15] tonight he is a mighty
[31:19] conqueror we're going to read another
[31:21] scripture here we're going to read
[31:24] Romans 55
[31:26] okay

[31:37] him he's not going to disappoint
[31:43] us have you ever has anybody has this

[31:50] having a birthday or maybe
[31:53] it's you know it's Christmas or
[31:55] something and man you really want
[31:56] something
[31:58] something and you open it up and you
[32:00] think it's going to be what you're going
[32:01] to
[32:03] get and you're like oh man
[32:06] oh this is nice this is
[32:10] great but I would have rather had that
[32:12] racetrack instead of this beautiful
[32:13] sweater
[32:16] right right oh yeah you wanted clothes
[32:19] right you know that's what they tell all
[32:20] of us
[32:21] right I always wanted toys
[32:24] right and then you know a week later we
[32:26] throw the the toy in the
[32:30] closet but he will not disappoint
[32:39] you thank you so so
[32:43] so now why let's read because the love
[32:46] of God the love of
[32:48] God has been poured out in our
[32:54] hearts by the Holy Spirit
[32:58] that was given to
[33:00] us and who gave us the Holy
[33:03] Spirit Jesus said a little while and you
[33:06] will see me no
[33:09] more but he said he was going to send
[33:11] something to
[33:13] us a
[33:15] comforter oh praise the Lord right he
[33:19] was going to give us that
[33:24] Holy because he loves us not
[33:28] loved he loves you right now he loves me
[33:32] right now
[33:35] amen so his holy
[33:38] spirit it's free is GRA free there's
[33:43] nothing that you have to
[33:47] do you you can't buy
[33:50] it you can't bargain for it you know
[33:54] sometimes we bargain wa
[33:55] um
[33:57] uh if I take out the trash all week
[33:59] would you buy me that uh
[34:02] football and if I take it out another
[34:04] couple of weeks and clean my room will I
[34:06] get a new
[34:08] bike see that's kind of bargaining right
[34:10] we're bargaining with our
[34:13] parents and we all do that sometimes I
[34:16] used to
[34:17] right but that's not how it is with God
[34:21] With God all we have to do with Jesus
[34:22] all we have to do is believe
[34:25] him and his holy spirit is a promise for
[34:28] all of
[34:29] us it doesn't matter if you're small big
[34:32] doesn't
[34:33] matter it's a promise and guess what
[34:37] Jesus doesn't break his
[34:40] promises so what do we have to
[34:43] do acts
[34:46] 238 says then Peter said unto
[34:49] them
[34:51] repent and let every one of you be
[34:53] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:56] Christ
[34:58] and you will
[35:00] receive the
[35:02] gift of the Holy
[35:05] Ghost that's all we got to believe
[35:09] him and to
[35:11] repent some of you are going to start
[35:13] learning about that in Sunday
[35:15] school is to start turning our
[35:19] back so so we're going to
[35:22] say first of all these are wonderful
[35:24] brothers right Brothers smile at the
[35:27] audience and
[35:29] wave but but but for this
[35:32] illustration we're going to say they're
[35:35] sin and I'm walking among the sin
[35:38] right
[35:41] Sinners repent means to turn my back on
[35:47] them and walk the other
[35:51] way that
[35:55] easy see it could be to when you get a
[35:58] thought to do something
[36:01] bad turn your back on it and walk
[36:05] towards what's
[36:07] right so you
[36:10] repent you're sorry for what you
[36:13] did you turn your back on
[36:17] it you're
[36:19] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[36:21] Christ for the remissions of your
[36:25] sins those sins are wiped away
[36:29] completely when you had sins that were
[36:31] written on a page like
[36:34] this let's
[36:36] see brother Jeff back
[36:39] there and when he
[36:42] repented this is what it looked
[36:44] like nothing Jesus took it all the
[36:48] way it's like if it never it's like if
[36:51] it never
[36:52] existed praise the
[36:55] Lord and then he gives you the
[36:57] promise the Holy Ghost is
[37:01] yours we can't look at our
[37:03] condition we just got to say Lord I made
[37:06] another
[37:07] mistake forgive me Lord father let me
[37:12] just pray more Lord and let me just seek
[37:15] you out more Lord and what Caleb said
[37:18] today when he read that scripture in the
[37:19] beginning in Psalms
[37:22] right don't let me lean on what I think
[37:24] so much Lord
[37:30] righty let me let me rely on
[37:35] you and that Holy
[37:37] Ghost begins to come into your
[37:40] life that's a wonderful
[37:42] thing the word of God
[37:46] says that Jesus is like the
[37:49] vine and the vine when it begins to have
[37:54] branches it begins to bear fruit
[37:57] fruit and those
[38:00] fruit are the life of Jesus Christ
[38:04] through
[38:07] you that's right so we're going to learn
[38:08] a little bit more
[38:11] right so Jesus the mighty
[38:14] conqueror while he was here on Earth he
[38:18] conquered
[38:20] sickness he conquered all sorts of
[38:24] things he did great miracles
[38:27] he would pray for
[38:29] people and and and people that were
[38:32] blind and they would be able to
[38:34] see people that were
[38:37] sick would rise up and walk
[38:40] again Lazarus his
[38:43] friend had been dead for a few
[38:47] days and when he and when he
[38:50] arrived he spoke the
[38:53] word and Lazarus resurrected from the
[38:56] dead
[38:58] so he conquered death in a
[39:01] man when he was here on
[39:04] Earth but then came the time where he
[39:07] had to pay the ultimate
[39:11] price an innocent blood was judged here
[39:15] on
[39:17] Earth and they sentenced him to be
[39:19] crucified like the common
[39:23] criminal and he and he was thinking of
[39:26] me and
[39:29] you he thinking of Benji Bernie
[39:34] brother brother
[39:36] Caleb all of us
[39:38] here and he was
[39:40] say I must go through with
[39:44] it that's right and he hung on the
[39:46] cross and he gave up his life that's
[39:50] right
[39:52] yes TR and the Earth shook
[39:57] the Earth sh could you
[39:59] imagine oh what's going on what happened
[40:02] what we do that's what they asked
[40:05] themselves so I want to read I want to
[40:07] read something you from the mighty
[40:11] conqueror from Brother
[40:13] brandham okay he says we see him in his
[40:17] Earthly ministry as a
[40:23] conqueror so remember we talked about
[40:25] all the things he conquered while he was
[40:27] here on
[40:29] Earth but now let's watch him after he
[40:35] died so Jesus died on the cross
[40:41] right he still went on conquering
[40:44] brother brandham
[40:46] said he never ended at the
[40:51] grave the Bible said
[40:53] so his soul descended into
[40:58] hell and he preached to the spirits that
[41:00] were in
[41:03] prison that repented not in the Longs
[41:06] suffering of the days of
[41:09] Noah remember we've all studied about
[41:11] Noah
[41:13] right about how the Lord told Noah to
[41:16] build an ark and he build an
[41:19] arc and then he told told he told Noah
[41:23] to preach to the
[41:25] people
[41:27] and then the people drowned that W in
[41:29] the
[41:32] ark it was
[41:34] sad all of H all of humanity was almost
[41:37] wiped out except for those that were in
[41:38] the
[41:40] ark so that's who Jesus was talking
[41:45] to and then brother BR says I can see
[41:47] him as the heavens and the Earth turning
[41:51] black the rocks are belching out of the
[41:54] mountains meaning the Earth were shaking
[41:56] and the Rocks were coming
[42:00] out the the whole Heavens the moons the
[42:03] Stars refused to
[42:08] shine he conquered
[42:10] it and when he went down descended
[42:15] down this is Jesus now he went
[42:18] down and and descended down he
[42:22] says and knocked at the
[42:24] door where the those lost souls
[42:28] was and when the doors came open those
[42:31] people who laughed and made fun of
[42:36] Enoch who made fun of
[42:40] Noah remember oh no you're crazy it's
[42:43] not going to rain why are you building
[42:44] that big
[42:47] boat that crazy old person right yeah
[42:50] that's what they did they weren't very
[42:52] nice to
[42:55] Noah
[42:57] I can hear him
[42:59] say that's Jesus I can hear him
[43:03] say I am the
[43:05] one that Enoch said would come with
[43:08] 10,000 of his
[43:11] Saints why didn't you believe
[43:16] Enoch said would come with 10,000 of his
[43:22] Saints why didn't you believe
[43:25] Enoch why didn't you believe
[43:28] Noah everything had to know that he'
[43:33] conquered when he shut the door on
[43:36] them the days of Mercy had
[43:40] passed oh my God that's that's a bad
[43:43] deal there on down into the lowest pits
[43:47] of
[43:48] hell so he kept climbing down further
[43:52] down into hell he went
[43:56] and he knocked at the suity doors of the
[44:00] devil's
[44:02] hell and the Devil comes to the
[44:06] door as we could look to
[44:10] see and there he
[44:12] said well here you are after
[44:17] all I sure thought I had you when I
[44:20] killed the
[44:23] prophets so now we know who killed the
[44:25] prophets right
[44:27] the
[44:28] devil
[44:30] okay I L I was sure I had you when I had
[44:34] John's head cut off in
[44:38] prison
[44:40] yeah but now after all you got
[44:44] here I can hear
[44:46] him as he
[44:48] said he straightened himself up
[44:52] said
[44:54] Satan I'm I'm the Virgin born son of the
[44:58] Living
[45:01] God my blood is still wet on the
[45:06] cross Jesus said I paid the
[45:10] price I paid the
[45:12] price I've
[45:14] conquered and I've come down to take
[45:21] overo strip you of everything that you
[45:23] claim you
[45:24] had
[45:26] so he told the devil I'm going to strip
[45:28] you of everything you think you
[45:30] have reached over to his
[45:33] side Bernie come here for a second and
[45:36] this is Bernie but we're just going to
[45:37] say that I'm Jesus and we're not going
[45:39] to say who the other guy is but he saw
[45:41] the keys there and Jesus told him I'm
[45:44] going to strip you of
[45:47] everything give me those and he took the
[45:51] keys and look at him he was huh he's
[45:54] like man what's going on here
[45:58] reached over to his side took the keys
[46:00] of death and hell and Ked them
[46:03] back to the place where he
[46:08] belonged he conquered
[46:10] hell when he
[46:12] rose he had the keys of
[46:15] death hell hanging at his side Jesus did
[46:21] not stay in the
[46:23] grave that's right he went down into
[46:27] hell and he took those keys from the
[46:30] devil that
[46:32] bluffer and he conquered for me you and
[46:35] all of us
[46:37] here that's why he's our
