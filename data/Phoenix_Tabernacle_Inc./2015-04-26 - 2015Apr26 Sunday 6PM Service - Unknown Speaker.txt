Jesus Christ you may be seated you know once again we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it is a blessing to see each and every one of you you know we're here tonight because it's the Deliverance service we came with a need I know I did I came with a need to get closer to Jesus Christ you know to to give them all my everything I have within me and I believe that if we all come in that same mind tonight we got something going because that day on Pentecost when they went into the upper room I'm sorry they were all in one mind in one Accord they all needed something you know they all carried there and made themselves right with God I believe that we all come in one mind right now there's nothing that God cannot do know if we all came to be delivered of something we're in one mind tonight how manys can I do I have who wants to be delivered tonight who wants to give everything they're struggling with to the Lord Jesus Christ know I know that through all my life I tried everything every single way no to to to to overcome and I couldn't do it but there was one day that I gave my life to Jesus Christ and that day I was able to overcome and it was not because of my works it because of what he did on Calvary for you and if we understand that tonight we'll get to the next step of our we're going to turn to the Bible to Isaiah 61 you know it's it's it's a it's a famous scripture you know but I but I love it you know I love the scripture because that's what brings life to us you know is the scripture know then mix with the Holy Ghost we got something going brothers and sisters you know Isaiah 61 says this the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and to open the prison door to them that are bound you know it's it's when I was reading the scripture the word captive you know my attention you know because who's ever been captive here you know I've been captive you know who's ever been in Chains I know a lot of you might not have been in Chains maybe not physically but spiritually you know I've been in Chains I've been captive and have not been able to do nothing for myself you know it's a terrible situation brother when a person is captive you cannot do nothing for yourself it doesn't matter if you jump or Shout Scream throw Tantrums it doesn't matter that can set you free from that captivity and many of you tonight maybe you're not captive chains but you came captive with problems in your life situations in your life sickness maybe depression anxiety with something in your life that you can't overcome you know and that's what I'm talking about tonight we all came here tonight to receive something from God am I right how many how many amens do I have you know I I love it because it's not the quantity of amens doesn't matter if that you know you don't get the church filled with amens but whoever's here tonight and says amen it's for you tonight if you came here with a purpose in your heart to say Lord I'm not leaving here until you bless me until you change my situation Lord I cannot do nothing for myself I tried everything I tried smoking I triy drinking I tried everything that the world has to offer and I cannot do it but maybe you have not tried that sweet sweet Holy Spirit you know we're going to go into a scripture tonight or or or or not a scripture but but a a quote of brother brandham I'm just gonna read it he says God sent his son preaching the gospel that's right correct the gospel is the good news so tonight brothers and sisters we're bringing you good news maybe you you received bad news you're going to lose your house you know you might get fired you know or EXC Etc tonight we're not talking about that news we're talking about good news good news to bring you out of that captivity good news to make you walk different act different to act like a Christian to act like you overcome not to even act to overcome sorry to overcome so let me keep reading it says in Isaiah 61 he says to who to who are talking down the scriptures God said there in Isaiah rather of Christ's coming he said God has anointed me to preach the gospel bring good TI to set the captives free let me tell you brothers and sisters here we're here tonight in this Deliverance service come for just any reason you know there's a problem in your life that you can't that you can't solve there's something in your life that you can't break there's habits in your life that are impeding you from coming you from coming closer to Jesus Christ from reaching that next level with him because let me tell you something you know last Friday you know the message was good but you know what we need something better we need something more you know that that that stuff for Friday that Holy Spirit for Friday it was good for back then but tonight you need something fresh need a new experience with God so let me keep reading I get excited brothers and sisters when I talk about the Gospel of Jesus Christ because you know within that gospel has the power to do something to you it has the power to change your life realize that there's no other name that there's no other gospel the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that can bring a change to your life we could just understand that tonight let me go back it says he said God has anointed me to preach the gospel bring Tidings to to set the captives free and to open the prison doors and let the captives Go free so he's talking about Jesus Christ know Isaiah prophesies this that there was going to come a savior that was going to do these things and we're living in the age that the Savior already came and he left but he sent us something wonderful that was his Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost was going to come into our lives and help us overcome our problems our needs everything we have to go to and he and he says this it says God he God it says God sent Christ to open the prison doors of man who are sitting in darkness let me tell you brothers and sisters if you're sitting in darkness if you feel like you have no hope maybe depressions on you maybe you're so overcome by your problems in your life God sent Jesus Christ for that purpose to help you in that part and stage in your life that you are right now and it says and notice the type that he spoke to setting them free it wasn't the illiterate it was the scholars the educated ones Christ come to set to set them free now to make it so that the little kitties would understand and when I was reading this brother Ernie came to my mind because he always says you got to have that childlike Faith you got to believe and trust in God with that childlike faith you know when your when my daughter comes to me and she ask me for something she knows that I'm going to give it to her she trusts in me she would have no doubt she knows that her Daddy has what she needs and if he and if he has it he will give it to her and that's the way it is with Jesus Christ we come to him with that faith of a little child knowing that he had has what you need he's going to give it to you if you are captive tonight you are in prison and you can't overcome come to Jesus Christ with that childlike faith and he will give you the power to overcome what do you mean power yeah he'll give you the power over them Spirits over over your problem over anything that you're going through that Holy Spirit able to in your life he says for he says for instance today that each one that each one of you were sentenced to death you were s you were s you were sitting in a prison knowing that sunrise tomorrow morning you had to die and many that is sinful away from God sitting in that place this morning many of us that ain't right with God that don't want to go all the way that are are that are afraid to trust in God 100% because maybe your life has been such a [Music] failure Maybe you haven't been able to overcome maybe throughout your life things have went so wrong that you don't trust nobody let me tell you brothers and sisters I found myself in that situation I found myself in prison not being able to help myself having people tell me what to do having people tell me when to wake up and when to go to sleep not a good thing let me tell you the author of that life was Satan because he had me where he wanted me and maybe tonight brothers and sister you're in that way spiritually you can't worship God the way you want to you can't walk with God the way you want you can't surrender to God the way he want the author of that life Satan no because that's his Masterpiece to make you fail to make you not overcome but let me tell you brother sister you know there's somebody here tonight that is more than able to help you overcome that problem that addiction you know maybe you're suffering through certain things in your life I don't know only you know remember the one who knows your heart is the Lord Jesus Christ so maybe you could be sitting here and say you know what brother I'm okay but there's one person that you cannot fool that's the Lord Jesus Christ that's the holy spirit because when he comes into your life and he starts checking you he knows what you need so brothers and sisters are you going to be real with them tonight are you going to open yourself up tonight say Lord I need you I can't keep walking like this I need your help I need to help you I need you to help me overcome let me tell brother and sisters don't be shameful to cry out to the Lord Brother sisters you think it's hard to cry out to the Lord here I was in prison with murderers and I used to cry every night to God and I would I was tell him Lord come and change me I don't belong with these people you call me to be a different person so if you think it's hard to be in church crying try being in prison crying oh let me tell you brother sisters talking about breaking your pride that that that will break your pride a lot of times we don't come to Christ because we're too prideful you know I Come From a Certain family I'm too prideful that's garage brothers and sisters God does not recognize titles he don't recognize family he just recognizes your heart are you willing tonight to open it lord inside and help me Lord take all that stuff within me that don't let me get closer to you and he keeps saying this he says we're we were all sentenced to death and you were sitting in prison knowing that sunrise tomorrow you had to die and many that sinful and away from God is sitting in this place this morning many people who are real good people me he's talking about good people here he's not talking about being out there partying in casinos inos being in the nightclubs Club you know being out there doing whatever he's talking about good people that are sitting here this evening you know senten to death because they don't want to take God at his word they don't want to go to the next level with God let me tell you brother and S we need to go to the next level no brother Johnny said this morning he said we need to be sealed with the Holy Ghost so we cannot stop growing with God we need to keep having more new more births let me keep going brothers and sisters I get excited brother and sisters you know because the gospel is good you know he says real good people are sitting in that condition this morning many of you here with cancer with a tumor with blindness you know you know maybe you're suffering through a sickness this evening maybe you know maybe it's not natural blindness but spiritual blindness you're in your Christian walk and you hit a wall and you don't know where to go you know let me tell you brothers and sisters there's someone that can light your way there's someone that has paid the price for you there someone that has already sent his holy ghost there's someone that wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you even want it because let me tell you brother sisters if you're thinking is that Holy Ghost for me it is for you is for you for your children for your fames your neighbors for whoever come in contact with you but the question is will you receive it will you receive it you know and then you what are you talking brother will I receive it that's the question will you you know because it's here after I finish speaking it's up to you God because God has promised it okay and it says this blindness some of you are sitting in all kinds of conditions yet God sent Christ to open the prison prison doors and set you free you say it's sickness you say is sickness a bondage let me tell you brothers and sisters there's no reason for you to walk out of here sick if you have a sickness tonight there's no reason for you to walk out because go Christ came for to to make you free out of that prison you know today you know I was battling you know I I might be the only one but I doubt it but I was battling I wasn't battling with my wife I wasn't battling with my daughter I was battling with my flesh because the Tormentor came to me and he started telling me you know what you you're you're not feeling good gives you this pain he gives you this pain and that pain but you know what you got to give it right back to him say you know what saying God already came and healed me I don't care what you say I'm made whole in Jesus Christ and he says yes Jesus plainly explained it when he said to the woman that had that stooped that had been stooped over and we're going to go to that scripture real quick you know and this this is tremendous brothers and sisters Luke 1311 and it says and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years go ahead and was bowed to and was bowed together and could not no wise lift up herself so I could just imagine this this this woman okay she had she she had a sickness that was she she was like this she could not do nothing about it she was helpless she couldn't do nothing about it I bet you you know she was in a horrible situation not being able to do nothing for herself you know she she she probably was made fun of you know you know jokes about her she might have been an outcast you know she might have dealt with [Applause] anxiety so many things for 18 years she was not made whole but one day she came into contact with the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you brothers and sister if you're if you're in a condition tonight I'll repeat it again if you're in a condition tonight that you cannot help yourself there is somebody that can help you tonight there is somebody that can open the prison doors for you there is somebody that already healed you there is somebody that will come to your rescue and that's the Lord Jesus Christ because it says in the scripture and when Jesus saw her he called to her he he called her to him and said unto her woman thou are loose from thy infirmity and he laid his hands on her immediately not to oh not next week he said immediately she was made whole let me tell you brother and sister you come to Jesus Christ right now and whatever your problem is make you it doesn't matter what you think it doesn't matter what your mind tells you the scripture tells us that immediately she was made whole so tonight brother and sister whatever your problem is come to Jesus as we pray brothers and sisters let us close our eyes everybody close your eyes and if there's something that you're going through if you if there's something that you're going through brother as I read the
