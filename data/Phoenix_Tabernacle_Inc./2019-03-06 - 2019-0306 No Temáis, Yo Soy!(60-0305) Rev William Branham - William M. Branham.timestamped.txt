[9:30] there's been something that's been on my
[9:33] heart told to the last one here there
[9:37] was the new ministry coming I spoke with
[9:40] some of the brothers today and was
[9:42] telling them about what happened just
[9:46] remember that the first time I was here
[9:48] you remember the Lord it's told me
[9:50] something that's going to happen change
[9:53] the ministry can happen that another

[10:10] the brother who does know about it -

[10:14] it'd be such a great thing for the
[10:16] people and I am grateful to God that the
[10:20] hour is soon at hand
[10:22] I believe that when God is going to have
[10:25] his children especially a be for those
[10:27] who can't muster to face the race up and
[10:30] get a hold of God like they should I
[10:32] believe the Lord is providing a way for
[10:35] us now to take care of them also some
[10:38] runs into the face that they can just
[10:41] reach over and receive anything that's
[10:44] say someone has mustard seeds taste and

[11:45] abundantly other things done now
[11:49] music wants to turn to the scripture
[11:52] reading there is we're going to read
[11:55] tonight approach the scripture from st.
[11:57] Matthew 14th chapter and you were
[12:01] keeping the marching town of the reading
[12:04] let's begin about the 22nd verse as we
[12:07] read on the 14th chapter of st.
[12:11] Matthew's Gospel and straight swaying
[12:16] Jesus constrains his disciples to get
[12:18] them to a ship and to go before him to
[12:22] the other side
[12:23] Raleigh sent the multitude away and we
[12:27] he had sent the multitude away we went
[12:30] up into a mountain of hearts afraid and
[12:33] when evening was come he was there alone
[12:37] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[12:41] sea tossed with away and the winds were
[12:44] contrary then the fourth watch of the
[12:48] night Jesus came unto them walking on
[12:50] the sea when the disciples saw him
[12:55] walking on the sea they were troubled
[12:57] safe it is a spirit and they cried out
[13:02] for fear but straightway Jesus spake
[13:05] unto them see be the good Shearer it is
[13:09] I be not afraid now I use that right
[13:16] three words or for these not afraid in
[13:23] his eyes I want to make that attack it
[13:29] must have been close to sundown when the
[13:35] big fisherman begins to move the boat
[13:37] back and forth to push it from the bank
[13:39] I can see straight brawny muscle desi as
[13:45] the boat loaded with the rest of the
[13:47] Apostles as we pushed away from the bank
[13:50] shove it free from the sands of the
[13:54] shore of Galilee and moved out into the
[13:59] water the bigger rugged fella climbed
[14:02] over some of their feet and tucking
[14:07] slaves for the side of Andrew his
[14:09] brother picked up the ore and they
[14:13] started away from the shore and as they
[14:18] moved steadily out to sea the people who
[14:23] loved them standing on the banks waving
[14:25] and the Sun going down and must have
[14:29] been about twenty minutes before they
[14:32] disappeared out of sight of the last one
[14:35] waiting I can see that each one drop is
[14:39] or wave then pick up his or start again
[14:42] with the little ship way back in the
[14:46] West look honey ran low
[14:49] as the Sun sank over this Judy and Hill
[14:53] something like this I remember when I
[14:57] was just a little boy
[14:59] is to read that story of God loving his
[15:03] people so well that he provided for them
[15:07] when they had no way to provide for
[15:10] themselves and he said that one day when
[15:17] God has called his people to take a
[15:19] journey from the land of bondage to the
[15:22] land of freedom they ran out of bread
[15:26] out in the wilderness and there was no
[15:28] corn or flour funds and they prayed and
[15:34] if I said this I remember when she told
[15:38] me that every night that God rained
[15:41] bread down out of heaven in the morning
[15:45] is people would go out and get that
[15:48] grade and I have said to my mother
[15:52] mother dear where did God get that bread
[15:57] to feed so many people 2 million people
[16:00] were more out in that wilderness how did
[16:03] he send it down to the skies when they
[16:07] were asleep and rained it up on the
[16:09] ground where did he get the flour mother
[16:12] to make the bread well if she used to
[16:16] say something like this my dear son
[16:20] God is the creator he is able to make
[16:25] bread or create whatever you wishes to
[16:29] when some requirement that God requires
[16:33] he is so great John until he just beast
[16:36] and it's there because he is the Great
[16:41] Creator and now he might say this my
[16:45] brethren did you notice his face this
[16:49] afternoon all those hungry people were
[16:53] standing there and one of the disciples
[16:58] might've said yes I noticed
[17:02] weighed down along the creek there was a
[17:04] little boy playing through it from
[17:06] school and had his luncheon and he had
[17:10] five grilled barley loaves and two
[17:13] fishes I'm ready tuck those bread into
[17:18] his hands and flip that bread handed it
[17:23] out touch those species that were fried
[17:26] broke then fishes and handed it out and
[17:30] when he reached back to get another
[17:31] piece of bread it already growth on
[17:36] already cooked and ready the species was
[17:41] already fried and a lot of that moves
[17:44] City lunch Assad's biscuits and two
[17:47] pieces of fish he fed 5,000 did it
[17:53] remind you of the story of God hideous
[17:57] people so they must be some great
[18:00] connection between this one that we're
[18:03] walking with and Jehovah God because
[18:06] there's something about him and he does
[18:08] the same thing God did he takes care of
[18:13] your people they were in a wilderness a
[18:16] nun persuaded veteran miner young John
[18:20] said in his useful way of about about 30
[18:23] years old I suppose make it 35 he was
[18:26] younger than the rest you might expect
[18:29] this that it was strange when I watched
[18:33] his eyes there was something godly about
[18:36] him you never had one doubt but what
[18:39] when he reached back for another biscuit
[18:41] it would be there and it for one biscuit
[18:44] off of another now brethren tell me
[18:48] where he's gone that he must need some
[18:54] connection with that Great Creator that
[18:57] could make bread Allen could make it
[19:01] already baked and could make the fish
[19:05] all that he's fried and ready
[19:08] ravenous from five
[19:10] it's um to fish enough to see 5000 take
[19:13] a broad basket full of fragrance
[19:15] leftovers done must be something about
[19:19] him that we yet have not understood but
[19:24] I know that he's some connection was
[19:26] gone because no man could do that unless
[19:28] God would be with him and Jesus had said
[19:34] if I do not for worse than my father
[19:37] then believe me not but if I do the
[19:40] worst thing you believe the words and
[19:43] young John must have jumped his head
[19:45] took back his Lord and it must have been
[19:49] sign and then the big fisherman said yes
[19:55] that was enough to convince anybody that
[19:58] God was in that ring because no one
[20:03] could have done it that man could not
[20:06] have done it himself but God was in him
[20:11] and then he said what always convinced I
[20:16] was rather a rugged little fisherman on
[20:21] the scene brethren you know I had better
[20:25] training than what I was doing first
[20:29] because I had a lovely old father he was
[20:33] a Pharisee but he was a great man I can
[20:40] remember down on the seashore when he
[20:42] was picked me up in his lap and set me
[20:44] down I would say Simon my son you're
[20:50] just delaying but maybe in your
[20:55] generation if your father doesn't see it
[20:58] there will come some day our deliverance
[21:03] which we know as to be the Messiah and
[21:08] Simon
[21:09] many people will misunderstanding our
[21:13] churches will misunderstand I need will
[21:17] be a man
[21:19] that'll be a strange sort of a man but
[21:23] Simon my son I never want you to forget
[21:26] this you'll have to know the Messiah by
[21:30] the scriptures this road of it don't
[21:33] never leave the Scriptures must die and
[21:36] Moses our leader has told us what the
[21:39] Messiah would be born is written in the
[21:43] scriptures that the Lord our God shall
[21:46] raise up a prophet of others and when
[21:50] this Messiah comes he will be a God's
[21:52] prophet you'll be different from other
[21:56] prophecies you hear God's prophets but
[21:59] you'll noise Simon because he will be
[22:02] that prophet and you'll do the science
[22:06] of a prophecy and when I heard of this
[22:09] Galilean man this Jesus of Nazareth I
[22:15] thought it was just another what just
[22:20] another Passover night but one day when
[22:24] he borrowed my boat then talking to me
[22:28] as soon as I come into his presence he
[22:32] called me by name the first time I ever
[22:38] saw him he told me who our and not only
[22:44] that but he think that gully old father
[22:48] of mine he said Simon you are the son of
[22:54] Jonas family says that I know that was
[23:00] the one life that he had spoke about
[23:02] that the scripture said would jump
[23:04] because he was a God prophecy I know
[23:08] these signs was beyond a prophecy so he
[23:12] was a God prophecy not in those that
[23:16] would be him
[23:17] that's two reasons other than your eyes
[23:20] hello my face and Andrew told me about
[23:22] it
[23:23] believing my brother sitting here young
[23:27] John brush his hair back he tears with
[23:30] it then smiles that Veronica he breaks
[23:32] that bridge I thought he was gone but
[23:38] Peter said when he told me who I was
[23:41] until my father was I knew who that was
[23:46] well then it must have been Philip who
[23:51] shoved these shoulders a little bit and
[23:53] looked around intense but better you
[23:59] should have seen the face of nothingness
[24:02] annular when I found him and I knew
[24:07] beyond the shadows out when he told sign
[24:09] on that face who he was really sorry was
[24:12] I knew that was the Messiah everyone
[24:16] heard him say that there was something
[24:18] burned within me our generation had a
[24:23] visitor and always going to be
[24:26] determined that ever friend that I know
[24:28] that I was going to get into and just as
[24:30] quick as I could
[24:32] throw salt of the spaniel my bosom
[24:35] friends way around the mountains about
[24:40] 15 miles running that danced over the
[24:42] cobblestones and the Sun were taught I
[24:46] heard much talk about it throwing pawn
[24:49] as the one along the seashore of
[24:52] galletitas see the my friends
[24:55] I came up and knocked on the door and
[24:59] his wife came to the door and I said
[25:02] where is the Sam said was sick he had
[25:07] just went out into the olive drove I
[25:10] think he's gone off to see about the
[25:13] irrigation or something quickly I've run
[25:16] out into the Grove in a pounding on his
[25:20] knees and
[25:23] that's a good way to find the night Oh
[25:27] tell me more knees knees and uh some
[25:30] message was burning in my heart so I
[25:32] could Harvey wish the peasant but get
[25:36] all that he finishes Prairie when he got
[25:39] us not going I was there
[25:42] usually I would go tree that said how is
[25:45] the Grove getting along this angle how
[25:48] is everything up at San Marcos and you
[25:50] did any training reserves the cabins is
[25:53] coming through as you use it is because
[25:56] he was rather a business name but on it
[25:59] don't seem to telling that's what we
[26:03] needed a burning nothing else takes its
[26:10] weight quickly eat in the face how do
[26:13] you do the same he said something about
[26:21] when you find Jesus you're gonna see who
[26:30] we are found Jesus of Nazareth the son
[26:34] of Joseph and its annual being a just
[26:39] man Anna level speaking many said not
[26:42] wait just a minute
[26:43] oh you know that there should be nothing
[26:47] good come from Nazareth here if there
[26:52] was such a thing as the Messiah that was
[26:56] coming he would come to the high priest
[26:58] first and they can set room he would
[27:01] come to our church but you see God's
[27:05] does Saints the juniors dream he does it
[27:10] in order to pull the elected from
[27:13] everywhere and then when I told him that
[27:19] if he was going to be critical the best
[27:21] thing to do was just come see for
[27:23] himself I think that's what
[27:28] don't criticize the few year of somebody
[27:32] that's receiving the Holy Spirit if you
[27:35] see a life changed in something
[27:38] differently and they say you've been
[27:40] told that there is the Holy Spirit
[27:42] you don't criticize it take your Bible
[27:45] look it over gives God promised it and
[27:48] then go see for yourself don't stay home
[27:51] we'll find out
[27:53] look it over yourself and compare it
[27:55] with the scriptures and if it's with the
[27:58] scriptures it's wrong if it ends with
[28:00] the scriptures that's questionable but
[28:03] as long as the scripture and a family it
[28:06] is true
[28:07] I'm Ted come see for yourself then you
[28:13] look back over shoulders to find the
[28:16] tango singer we think for joy and he
[28:20] said brother do you remember our
[28:22] conversation along the road I propose
[28:26] you that the scripture said that the
[28:29] Messiah was he a prophet of God profit
[28:33] that Moses said the larger God shall
[28:36] raise up all of our people questions are
[28:39] you that's profit any less than Kali in
[28:44] a days not telling him exactly what he
[28:46] was and he said you remember the old
[28:50] fisherman for the name of silence yes
[28:53] said Nathaniel I remember him
[28:55] you remember when we fought that speech
[28:58] from the in that day and you wanted to
[29:00] sign a receipt and you didn't even have
[29:03] enough education to sign his own name
[29:06] but that same illiterate man came before
[29:10] this one that we know to be the Messiah
[29:13] as soon as he came he Tori's who he was
[29:18] what his father lies and the spangle
[29:22] said I'll come see for myself
[29:24] you'll never tell me nothing my mind
[29:26] stronger here you'll never read my mind
[29:29] no my reader and when we come up into
[29:32] the presence and a nothing here iam
[29:37] saved us
[29:38] a moment cilix taste Nathaniel I'm
[29:44] didn't dildo you tell the rest of it and
[29:48] the fatal tip when I take offense to
[29:52] look at him I knew by his looks that he
[29:55] was a different from other man and
[29:58] rather this first what I'm saying once
[30:01] gets a vision of Jesus Christ he can
[30:04] never be the same nature that he's
[30:06] different from others and he said when I
[30:11] looked at him and he looked at me
[30:15] Hey look me right in the face said he
[30:18] said Behold an Israelite in whom there
[30:21] is no guile laughs I wonder if Philip
[30:26] could have told him that he was going
[30:28] after me what if that could be the key
[30:31] so I turn around and said to him rabbi
[30:35] when did you ever know me we are
[30:39] strangers to each other and what did you
[30:41] know mean you said the force called you
[30:44] when you were under the tree the king of
[31:01] Israel then that look that he gave me
[31:04] and said oh you believe me to be such
[31:07] because I told you where you are I told
[31:11] you these things then thou shalt see
[31:14] greater things and truly today all have
[31:18] seen greater things when he taken the
[31:20] bread and broke it and created bread
[31:22] behind it and fish he told me the truth
[31:25] therefore I am persuaded evasion of
[31:32] profit was to come into the world at the
[31:35] ending of of our dispensations and they
[31:40] stick quite 50 minutes then Andrew
[31:43] standing across from Peters foolish
[31:45] orientation that's rich for a few
[31:48] minutes brethren let me call Shir
[31:52] because of swells our Samira floating
[31:55] along pretty lively and we've got all
[31:58] night the Costas the Galilean see don't
[32:03] we all well remember the day that we

[40:11] churches apart
[40:12] separating Brotherhood making people's
[40:15] faces are little better than somebody
[40:16] else there's wrong in a better practice
[40:20] they belong to a better Church there is
[40:24] only one church and that's the Church of
[40:27] Jesus Christ
[40:28] and there's only one way to get into it
[40:30] that's by birth you are born into the
[40:35] church's pomp and there's no other way
[40:37] to be brilliant and it doesn't matter
[40:41] whether you're Methodists Baptists
[40:43] Presbyterians Catholic Orthodox Jew
[40:46] whatever you are God does not look at
[40:49] your denomination he looks at the brand
[40:52] is on you or the blood
[40:56] here's the guy I used to do quite a bit
[40:58] of line where's Raju ever did was your
[41:00] team I thought I was a rider like my dad
[41:04] joke a Bronco call me up a few times
[41:07] well right here in Salt River Valley has
[41:09] filled me into a bunch of cactus out
[41:10] there one day I was an awkward shape for
[41:12] a week agooo trying to chase the burro
[41:15] down by all the sixteenth Street
[41:18] 33 years ago why we never over in
[41:22] Colorado
[41:23] the herds word association grazes the
[41:25] Troublesome River Valley and many times
[41:28] when we take the cattle up there by step
[41:30] with my leg wrapped around the heart of
[41:32] the saddle
[41:32] while the Rangers were checking these
[41:34] saddles going through the day the prison
[41:37] gate and there was the turkey sex that
[41:42] was the lazy cave the diamond tea mr.
[41:45] Grimes
[41:46] I am the tripod which was mr. Jeffery
[41:50] two hours with mrs. Rollins Hey
[41:54] different ones for tuition every man can
[41:57] raise a ton of hate to put a talent on
[42:00] the plaster for the summer but I noticed
[42:03] that Rangers never even check the breads
[42:08] he looked in their ear for the glint
[42:11] eggs because nothing is all net force
[42:14] except it was a registered preferred
[42:17] that's the way it's gonna be it's a big
[42:19] date someday don't care what brands away
[42:30] you won't watch the brand you wants to
[42:33] learn not where I see the brand when I
[42:35] see the blood I'll pass over you
[42:40] Payson has slowed his breath of poison
[42:44] then all these people don't believe like
[42:46] you in this race watch you believe it -
[42:49] you believe leave on the Lord Jesus
[42:51] Christ and thou shalt be seen on the
[42:54] line any steam the lone boat on the sea
[42:58] near what sure in folk tune or you can
[43:01] see you out on the sea of life without
[43:03] Jesus let's refine distinctive and you
[43:07] know if you don't watching these
[43:10] disciples that bring off without him I
[43:13] know I say this with brotherly love I
[43:16] wonder if in the life where a five years
[43:20] or more if we haven't got so busy so
[43:25] many things to do and our building
[43:28] programs and and all of our societies
[43:31] the veins that we're getting in the
[43:32] church if we haven't Connie went off
[43:35] without if we haven't stayed home aside
[43:39] to watch some television on Wednesday
[43:42] night instead of and in church I wonder
[43:45] if we haven't been too busy trying to uh
[43:48] or make enough hints to get a new car or
[43:51] something I guess and forgot journey one
[43:55] of our programs haven't called us to
[43:57] wait on we say our church is getting
[43:59] cold and formal I wonder if we check up
[44:01] on ourselves if we're not just as much
[44:03] to bring a little more than the pass
[44:05] through the paws of our church being in
[44:08] that condition
[44:09] remember you're sailing in one little
[44:12] boat others nobody can get in there with
[44:17] you but you're Jesus
[44:19] so keep it congregated and the unit to
[44:23] there's power with rest of believers
[44:26] head in fellowship one with another
[44:28] while the part of Jesus
[44:29] I've got some tweezers of all
[44:31] uncleanness and then the little
[44:35] beginning of ditch back and forth and it
[44:38] looks like the time that comes I can
[44:41] take the first thing when the winds
[44:44] begin to vote Simon being a great
[44:46] fisherman he said watch the sail
[44:49] I said I'll rip it off lyov hands we

[45:02] orange give his back foot and broke
[45:04] dealer then the great waves begin to
[45:07] fill up the ship I wonder is getting
[45:10] away from God

[45:22] haven't got to the place that were we
[45:24] with brothers are going to a party they
