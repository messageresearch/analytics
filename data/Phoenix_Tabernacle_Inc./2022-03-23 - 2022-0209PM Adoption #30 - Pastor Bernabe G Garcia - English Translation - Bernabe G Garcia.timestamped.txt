[0:08] once again
[0:09] we are gathered in this place
[0:13] and we plead for your help
[0:17] may your word be our
[0:20] food this morning
[0:23] and thereby glorify
[0:26] you as we see the revelation of your
[0:28] word
[0:30] i pray that you part imparted unto us in
[0:33] your infinite mercy in the name of the
[0:36] lord jesus christ amen
[0:41] let's open up our bibles to the book of
[0:44] ephesians
[0:45] chapter 4
[0:47] verse 30.
[0:49] it reads
[0:51] and grieve not
[0:53] the holy spirit of god
[0:55] whereby ye are sealed
[0:59] unto the day
[1:00] of redemption
[1:02] this morning
[1:04] i greet
[1:05] each and every one of you
[1:07] with a brotherly greeting
[1:10] trusting that it be god
[1:13] that blesses us through his word
[1:16] last night
[1:18] i didn't see the sister sister foster
[1:22] and we welcome her
[1:24] also she arrived
[1:27] yesterday
[1:28] each one of you
[1:30] that have come this morning
[1:32] somewhere around there i saw brother
[1:34] lopez a few moments ago there is
[1:38] we're happy that he's come back
[1:41] with us well well-being he was traveling
[1:44] in mexico and he's now returned we're
[1:46] happy
[1:47] happy with uh
[1:50] that each and every one of you are doing
[1:51] well like brother mike that uh
[1:54] he's also arrived from el paso and with
[1:56] him and his family
[1:59] there are so many brothers that uh that
[2:02] are moving during these days and
[2:04] it's difficult brothers for them and for
[2:06] us but i believe that god will help us
[2:10] in all things
[2:13] before we begin with the word i want to
[2:15] bring or read a little note that was uh
[2:19] given to me from
[2:21] the prayer room on a prophecy for
[2:24] assigned
[2:25] by brother burunda and brother campo
[2:28] it reads like this
[2:30] behold i have
[2:32] a tremendous work of blessing a
[2:35] tremendous blessing upon this place
[2:39] i ask you to glorify my name in this
[2:42] place and to honor me
[2:44] watch for the
[2:47] works of the devil amen thus saith the
[2:50] lord therefore let's pray to god for the
[2:52] brother brothers that are there
[2:54] they're not looking for gifts but
[2:58] there should they should be people with
[3:00] gifts
[3:01] so it we just need a little bit of time
[3:03] and instruction so that they can
[3:05] start settling down and
[3:07] and being in the right place where the
[3:09] way the prophet brought us
[3:12] i'm going to continue the message in
[3:13] adoption
[3:15] this is number
[3:16] 30. i'm going to need about 10 minutes
[3:20] uh
[3:21] extra
[3:22] and uh
[3:23] i'm going to limit myself to an hour
[3:25] brothers an hour with five minutes and
[3:27] then i will be closing this teaching
[3:30] last sunday or
[3:32] or the last time i preached on adoption
[3:35] when i preached number 29 we were
[3:38] talking about uh how it is that the lamb
[3:42] took the book
[3:44] and gave it then to the seventh angel
[3:47] as we consider
[3:49] closely all of these things that the
[3:52] prophet says and what the bible teaches
[3:55] it takes us to the same grounds
[3:59] of those things that we have preached
[4:02] in times past
[4:04] and as i consider them from a different
[4:06] angle i can understand why it is that
[4:09] many people
[4:10] get tangled
[4:12] during this time you see the prophet
[4:14] said that
[4:16] if we don't balance the things or put
[4:19] the things on the balance you are going
[4:20] to fall into an error that's the reason
[4:24] why it is so nest
[4:26] the teaching is so necessary
[4:28] that the people settle down and
[4:30] stay nice and quiet and hear
[4:34] with precaution with uh
[4:37] slowly what is being spoken and then
[4:39] write it down and then you go home and
[4:41] you
[4:42] read it again so that it could be a
[4:44] thing that will anchor within our hearts
[4:48] as a revelation
[4:50] [Music]
[4:52] in order to enter the certain things i
[4:54] want to go into i i need to just review
[4:56] a little bit not forgetting that we are
[4:58] in the message adoption
[5:01] and i need to
[5:03] read
[5:03] certain parts of the prophet
[5:06] uh therefore the thought that i'm taking
[5:09] is the title
[5:10] uh uh speaking on how it is that we're
[5:14] gods we've talked about how we are gods
[5:17] we've spoken on that
[5:19] much
[5:20] now brother campo if you're a god and
[5:22] brother udiel is a god
[5:25] do you believe that you're god's
[5:26] brothers
[5:27] then you have to get to that
[5:30] a man totally surrendered to god is a
[5:34] and as a son of god is a god
[5:36] therefore the other thing is that
[5:39] we don't want to put everything into one
[5:41] bundle
[5:42] because the mistake is that you take a
[5:44] bag or a bun a bag let's say this is a
[5:47] bag and everything that the prophet says
[5:49] you put into the same bag you do that
[5:52] you're going to go to an extreme and
[5:54] you're going to fail or you're going to
[5:56] make a mistake but if you take another
[5:59] bag
[6:00] and you take everything and put it into
[6:01] that bag you're also going to fail
[6:04] and i believe that that's where the
[6:05] error is at there's two bags
[6:07] and
[6:08] everyone just throws everything in one
[6:10] bag
[6:11] consider what i'm saying
[6:13] if brother camp and brother
[6:15] are gods and the prophet said it
[6:17] we put all of that in one bag but if
[6:20] they're gods and then there is a major
[6:23] god on earth
[6:25] on earth and that is the prophet
[6:27] so let's place what corresponds to the
[6:30] prophet in a different bag you see that
[6:33] so if you don't do that sooner or later
[6:35] you're going to put the prophet
[6:37] in the place of the lord jesus christ
[6:39] because
[6:40] there's much message there's many
[6:42] messages to back that up
[6:44] but the worker the labor of god knows
[6:47] should know how to rightly divide the
[6:49] word and place the thing in its
[6:51] appropriate bag
[6:53] so seeing that we're speaking about gods
[6:57] i would like to
[6:59] turn the corner now begin to turn the
[7:02] corner
[7:03] to speak a little bit on
[7:05] the major god on the earth now the
[7:08] supreme god
[7:10] is the lord jesus christ
[7:12] but there should be a major god on earth
[7:16] and i would like to say that that major
[7:18] god in this century is the prophet of
[7:21] the age william branham
[7:24] so
[7:25] speaking on that
[7:27] i would like to try
[7:29] to explain what corresponds or what
[7:32] belongs to the lamb now you know what
[7:34] the prophet said i've read it and i'm
[7:35] going to read it again where the prophet
[7:37] says
[7:38] that the book of redemption let's say
[7:41] that this is the book of redemption
[7:42] which is the revelation of the seven
[7:44] seals the revelation
[7:46] that jesus christ brought through a man
[7:49] this book of redemption
[7:51] when man sinned
[7:54] that title
[7:55] that title deed or of the inheritance
[7:58] returned to god but then jesus christ
[8:01] came
[8:02] and died to pay the price and in this
[8:04] 20th century
[8:06] the lamb came he took the book of
[8:10] redemption the lamb took it and he said
[8:13] this book is mine
[8:15] therefore when he did this
[8:17] he gave it to the prophet
[8:19] he gave it to william branham and he
[8:21] said william branham
[8:23] here
[8:25] here it is so that you can bring it to
[8:27] my gods so that you can bring it to my
[8:30] people
[8:32] and i want you to preach it but in
[8:34] reality he was representing
[8:37] the lamb
[8:38] here on earth in reality he was
[8:41] representing the lamb here on earth
[8:43] and being like this now you're going to
[8:45] help me the brothers that have been
[8:46] listening to the tape you're going to
[8:47] help me
[8:49] and you're going to answer right
[8:52] so that the audience uh has time to
[8:55] think about it now
[8:57] the word redeem the word redeem
[9:00] means
[9:03] what does it mean
[9:04] can you help me
[9:07] it means to buy
[9:08] to buy back to it goes back to the owner
[9:12] to go back to the
[9:15] to buy back that which was lost is that
[9:17] right
[9:18] and so in order for there to be
[9:19] redemption
[9:21] you need
[9:22] a redeemer is that right brothers
[9:25] now notice
[9:27] i want you to take this very seriously
[9:29] in a just in a quiet way so that
[9:33] in order for there to be redemption
[9:36] there needs to be a redeemer very well
[9:38] well let's place here a redeemer okay
[9:42] so then the bible speaks
[9:44] of a day of redemption
[9:47] therefore if there's a day of redemption
[9:51] so that
[9:52] that day can be
[9:55] the redeemer has to make himself present
[9:57] because the redeemer has to come
[10:00] on that day of redemption now the bible
[10:02] speaks of it and mentions it
[10:05] as the day of christ
[10:07] and it also mentions it as the day of
[10:10] redemption now
[10:13] if the prophet how many believe that the
[10:14] prophet william branham is our absolute
[10:16] in this time
[10:18] now
[10:19] if the prophet william branham said this
[10:22] he said jesus christ
[10:25] does not
[10:26] put his foot on the earth you see how
[10:29] easy it is for people to make a mistake
[10:32] because
[10:33] the one that's going to be present on
[10:34] the day of redemption
[10:37] has to be the redeemer
[10:39] but since jesus christ does not set foot
[10:41] on the earth he has to send a
[10:44] representative
[10:46] therefore in this day of redemption
[10:49] it's jesus christ who is our redeemer
[10:53] but in reality
[10:55] the one that you see
[10:57] is william branham
[10:59] that's the reason why and this is the
[11:01] reason
[11:02] because we've already read it last
[11:03] sunday i believe that the lamb
[11:07] went to the throne where
[11:09] god was sitting
[11:11] and he had the book at his right hand
[11:13] and he took the book
[11:14] and the lamb said
[11:16] this book is mine
[11:17] i purchased it i redeemed it
[11:20] i am the redeemer
[11:22] and then he tore open the seals
[11:26] and
[11:26] gave them to the seventh angel
[11:30] therefore
[11:31] when the seventh angel
[11:33] stands here on earth and says
[11:36] the lamb
[11:38] took the book
[11:39] the lamb
[11:41] opened the book the lamb
[11:44] spoke the book and then he says
[11:46] i
[11:47] was the one that opened it therefore if
[11:50] you don't know how to rightly divide the
[11:52] word you begin to worship william
[11:55] branham
[11:56] but you have to know how where to turn
[11:59] the corner i believe that the prophet
[12:02] uh uh deciphers and tells us all of
[12:06] these things in order if we could just
[12:09] only open up our spiritual hearing are
[12:12] you ready brothers
[12:14] very well let's begin to read in the
[12:15] book of the seals i'm going to read in
[12:18] spanish page 83 and in english i believe
[12:21] it's i wrote it there so you can read it
[12:23] at home page 103
[12:25] in english
[12:26] it reads like this the law of god
[12:29] required a kinsmen redeemer
[12:31] and the lamb came out courageously
[12:34] saying
[12:35] i am your kinsmen redeemer i am your
[12:39] redeemer
[12:40] i have already interceded for them and
[12:43] now i have come to claim the rights
[12:47] i have paid the price
[12:50] he says there was no one that could do
[12:53] this
[12:54] it says therefore the lamb came directly
[12:56] to the right hand of god
[12:59] and he took the book from his hand and
[13:02] claimed all the rights i have been slain
[13:05] for them i am their kinsmen redeemer
[13:08] i am the mediator my blood was shed
[13:12] and i've come to be
[13:14] man
[13:15] and i did all of this to redeem once
[13:17] again that church
[13:19] that i had seen before the foundation of
[13:22] the world i have decreed it and i have
[13:25] spoken it saying that it would be there
[13:28] in that day no one could take the book
[13:31] but i came down
[13:33] and i took the book myself i am your
[13:36] kinsman
[13:37] and he
[13:39] took the book
[13:41] is that right
[13:42] so then we see that the lamb
[13:44] the one that died
[13:46] he's the one that took the book is that
[13:47] right brothers
[13:49] now i'm going to read page 90 91 in
[13:51] spanish and
[13:54] page 90 in spanish and in english it's
[13:56] page 111
[13:58] the prophet says this
[14:00] oh you talk about a jubilee
[14:02] talk about a time
[14:04] when that lamb walked forth see
[14:08] the books even sealed in heaven
[14:11] you say
[14:12] is my name there i don't know
[14:15] i hope it is
[14:17] but if it is
[14:19] it was put on the book before the
[14:22] foundation of the world but the first
[14:24] thing that
[14:25] represented that redemption
[14:29] was the lamb that had been slain
[14:31] from the foundation of the world and he
[14:34] took
[14:36] the book
[14:37] he opened the book
[14:39] tore off the seals and sent it down to
[14:42] the earth to his seventh angel
[14:46] to reveal it to his people
[14:48] therefore there is no doubt
[14:51] or of why we should doubt that the book
[14:54] stayed in was left in the hands of
[14:56] william branham
[14:58] and now what the prophet spoke on that
[15:00] very clearly very well
[15:02] so then if william branham received the
[15:05] book
[15:06] we're going to begin to turn the corner
[15:09] brother agrippino
[15:11] turning the corner so that you can so
[15:13] that you can see
[15:14] why it is that the people fail
[15:17] seals page 62 in english page 78 he says
[15:21] now hold that word forgive me brothers
[15:25] and grieve not
[15:26] the holy spirit of god
[15:28] whereby ye are sealed
[15:31] until
[15:33] the day until the day of your redemption
[15:37] were sealed for a certain day
[15:40] and that day
[15:42] is the day of redemption
[15:45] very well
[15:47] now back to what brother bran was saying
[15:49] hold that word redemption
[15:52] until
[15:53] hold that word redemption until the day
[15:55] that the book of redemption has been
[15:57] revealed
[15:59] and the redeemer comes
[16:01] to claim his possession
[16:05] nothing
[16:06] can do it or tear open that seal see
[16:10] grieve not
[16:11] the holy spirit
[16:13] say
[16:14] do the things that pleases god
[16:18] for the book is sealed now
[16:21] and you are sealed
[16:24] the holy spirit itself
[16:26] is the seal
[16:28] seal signifies
[16:30] now
[16:31] this is words i got from the dictionary
[16:34] seal signifies a finished work in other
[16:37] words
[16:38] if you're sealed
[16:40] you're sealed until the thing is
[16:43] finished on continue reading
[16:45] seals page 63
[16:47] 79 in english
[16:49] we are following that day of redemption
[16:52] now notice brother branham says this
[16:54] book is sealed
[16:56] and you are sealed with
[17:00] the book
[17:02] until the day of redemption
[17:05] again
[17:08] again in romans 8 22 and 23 let's get
[17:12] that
[17:14] and we'll get that background then i
[17:16] think we'll understand it a little
[17:17] better
[17:18] and
[17:19] so for we know that the whole creation
[17:22] growneth and travaileth and pained
[17:24] together until now and not only they but
[17:27] ourselves also which have the first
[17:28] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[17:31] groan within ourselves waiting
[17:36] waiting for the adoption
[17:39] that is to say the redemption of our
[17:42] body
[17:43] oh my oh my
[17:45] don't that make us old folks feel good
[17:50] it ought to make us all feel good
[17:54] waiting for this hour
[17:58] we understand
[18:00] this will take place at the first
[18:04] resurrection glory
[18:07] therefore perhaps i i spelled the wrong
[18:09] i spell i spelled the spanish word wrong
[18:12] primera first see that's why people on
[18:15] occasions well not the people but satan
[18:18] he hates teaching
[18:21] because it isn't hard
[18:22] we're seeing
[18:24] that
[18:25] a day of redemption is coming and that
[18:27] day of redemption
[18:29] is
[18:30] the first resurrection
[18:32] and that is when the redeemer makes
[18:35] himself present
[18:36] now notice
[18:37] the redeemer makes himself present now
[18:41] but first of all the first thing and we
[18:43] just read it
[18:44] is that the first thing that represents
[18:47] that redemption you know i read it in
[18:49] english page 111
[18:51] he says it's that the lamb took the book
[18:55] opened the book
[18:56] tore the seals and he sent it to the
[18:59] earth that's the first thing that
[19:01] happens
[19:02] the second thing that happens is that
[19:05] the redeemer
[19:06] is
[19:08] presents himself here on earth
[19:10] so that the day of redemption redemption
[19:13] can come see now this is flesh brothers
[19:15] now just settle down now and we're going
[19:17] to see it through the word
[19:20] let's read in the seals page 470 in
[19:23] spanish and in english 562.
[19:29] it reads like this the prophet is
[19:31] speaking about when the sword fell in
[19:34] his hand
[19:36] and he said that this this sword was
[19:38] very precious and that it just fit his
[19:42] hand exactly you see
[19:45] he knew how to use it because it fit him
[19:47] well how many of you remember
[19:49] that the bible says
[19:51] that uh
[19:53] that they were they tried to put on on
[19:56] david king david the armor of saul he
[19:59] said well this doesn't fit me
[20:01] it didn't fit him it was too big so
[20:03] david went with the instrument that god
[20:05] had given him
[20:07] which was a slingshot and five little
[20:09] smooth stones which stand for grace
[20:12] means grace and he didn't need all five
[20:15] stones he just needed one because god is
[20:17] one you see but in this 20th century
[20:21] he didn't bring a slingshot to the
[20:24] prophet he brought him a sword and he
[20:27] placed it in his hand
[20:28] so that there would be no mistake
[20:32] to whom it belonged therefore
[20:36] not only does he give him the sword
[20:40] but
[20:40] when the prophet receives the sword
[20:44] he comes out of the trance or the vision
[20:46] or whatever it was he comes out of it
[20:48] and he says
[20:52] a representative of a king
[20:54] cannot
[20:55] go
[20:56] with a sword
[20:58] unless he's dressed
[21:01] or has his garments his vestures can you
[21:04] imagine her brother roberto
[21:06] if he would have stood here on friday
[21:08] when he got married
[21:09] there's the bride beautifully dressed
[21:11] and he would have he would have on a a
[21:14] a potato sack
[21:16] as a suit that wouldn't look right right
[21:19] he came with his suit his groom's suit
[21:22] so we're gonna see where the suit is at
[21:25] because the suit has to be around there
[21:27] somewhere when a deep is calling another
[21:30] deep then there has to be
[21:33] a deep to answer
[21:35] so if you feel something in your heart
[21:38] and your heart is crying out for more of
[21:40] god let me tell you that there's
[21:43] something more
[21:44] for you
[21:45] from god
[21:47] when the prophet on a certain occasion
[21:50] they asked the prophet
[21:51] brother branham
[21:53] i want you to pray for me
[21:57] because i made such and such and such a
[21:59] sin
[22:01] and then the devil comes and he accuses
[22:03] me and i want you to pray so that i can
[22:05] be free
[22:06] the prophet answered
[22:08] i don't need to pray for
[22:11] the word is the one that absolves you of
[22:15] all sin
[22:16] you see the only thing you have to do
[22:19] is to come
[22:20] and
[22:21] believe the word now if there's
[22:23] something in you that is crying out for
[22:26] forgiveness
[22:27] then there has to be forgiveness for you
[22:30] therefore when there's something that is
[22:32] crying within us for something the
[22:34] prophet said it's that there's something
[22:36] out there that will answer that cry the
[22:40] prophet said when there's a question
[22:41] there has to be an answer
[22:43] perhaps we might not know the answer
[22:47] but the answer is there somewhere
[22:50] now
[22:51] i'm going to read where the prophet
[22:55] speaks of when he receives the sword the
[22:58] prophet says
[22:59] he says
[23:00] and at that moment a voice
[23:03] thundered
[23:05] throughout that canyon and shook
[23:08] and
[23:09] and that rocked the rocks and said
[23:11] it's the sword
[23:13] of the king
[23:15] and then i come out of it
[23:18] when he heard this the prophet was not
[23:22] we could say like this in his five
[23:23] natural senses he was outside of these
[23:26] five senses he was elevated with god
[23:30] and when he heard this word
[23:33] because there was a great
[23:36] thundering that went through the canyon
[23:38] that was in sabino canyon it thundered
[23:40] through the canyon
[23:42] and then the voice spoke and said this
[23:44] is
[23:46] the king sword or the sword of the king
[23:49] i'm gonna hold there
[23:50] i read it a few minutes ago you can read
[23:52] it at home
[23:53] brother branham says the first thing
[23:55] that this represents is
[23:58] so there's a first thing
[24:00] in order for the day of redemption to
[24:03] come first of all
[24:06] the plan of redemption must be revealed
[24:10] so that god
[24:11] brings that message
[24:13] so that there can be a people which we
[24:16] are which will receive this revelation
[24:21] because it is impossible
[24:23] notice what i'm saying
[24:25] it is impossible according to the law of
[24:28] god
[24:28] that god
[24:30] using a prophet
[24:32] bring all things to fulfillment
[24:36] because you also need a woman
[24:40] to receive the seed
[24:43] which is
[24:44] the word of god
[24:46] and there has to be somewhere around
[24:48] there has to be a people perhaps we
[24:50] might not be it
[24:51] but under the heavens there has to be a
[24:54] people that receive the word all the
[24:56] word that god brought in this time so
[25:00] that
[25:02] the second part can come about
[25:04] which is the day of redemption
[25:08] or what we call the resurrection from
[25:10] the dead notice he says
[25:13] the voice said
[25:15] this is
[25:16] the sword of the king
[25:18] and then i came to myself now if he
[25:21] would have said
[25:23] the king of
[25:24] the sort of
[25:26] of a king
[25:28] there's only one king and that's god
[25:31] this is the sword of the king there's
[25:33] only one the king and that's god
[25:36] and he has only one sword
[25:40] and that's his word
[25:42] which i live by now it's really clear
[25:46] i'm going to stop there for a moment so
[25:48] that the people can get this
[25:50] so then the sword is the word very
[25:53] simple
[25:57] may god help me bring on his holy
[26:00] vesture
[26:01] with his holy word lane here it's the
[26:04] word amen
[26:06] now
[26:07] in english the prophet says may god help
[26:10] me
[26:11] bring on his holy vesture
[26:15] so
[26:16] william branham did not
[26:18] did
[26:20] william branham does not bring he says
[26:23] bring it on
[26:24] bring on your holy vestures because the
[26:26] one that has the vesture or the garment
[26:29] is god because william branham seeing
[26:31] himself with the sword he says in order
[26:33] for me to be able to execute or carry
[26:35] out that sword and execute it in its
[26:37] totality i need to be dressed with this
[26:40] holy gesture
[26:42] now you can review this at home with
[26:44] time and you can see in revelation in in
[26:47] chapter 17 of saint matthew
[26:50] that there was a claim made there you
[26:52] know and the declaration came from peter
[26:56] and he he declared oh the thing here is
[26:58] tremendous i believe that uh it would be
[27:01] good for us to make here three
[27:03] tabernacles or
[27:05] one for you and another one for moses
[27:08] and another one for elias
[27:10] but then suddenly
[27:12] elias and moses disappeared and there
[27:15] came a voice when that cloud came down
[27:18] and the cloud covered the lord jesus
[27:20] christ
[27:22] his face shone as the sun
[27:25] then
[27:26] you could hear the voice say
[27:28] this is my beloved son hear ye him
[27:32] therefore
[27:33] when the prophet receives this sword he
[27:36] says
[27:37] bring on
[27:39] his holy vestures i already have the
[27:42] sword but i need to be dressed and he's
[27:45] taken to a mount also he's taken to
[27:48] mount sunset and god sends from eternity
[27:52] his word
[27:54] now you call that the cloud i call it
[27:57] cloud but that cloud was formed by seven
[28:00] angels they came and they lifted william
[28:03] branham up into the midst of that
[28:05] constellation of angels and they covered
[28:08] him that cloud is the logos that came
[28:11] out of god
[28:14] so then
[28:15] then if he covers it and dresses him
[28:18] then he says now my son can go down
[28:21] and take this message of the seven seals
[28:24] because i've given him the sword and i
[28:27] have dressed him with my holy vestures
[28:31] i continue reading
[28:32] brother brown says
[28:34] oh what a day we're living in
[28:37] what a great thing
[28:39] see the mystery and secret
[28:45] when this left me
[28:47] something came to me and said don't fear
[28:50] now
[28:51] i didn't hear no voice
[28:55] tremendous huh i didn't hear no voice
[28:58] but something on the inside of me spoke
[29:02] i have to tell you the truth just
[29:05] exactly what happened
[29:07] this was so tremendous
[29:09] that
[29:11] it
[29:12] from the mouth of god it couldn't come
[29:14] the word couldn't come from the mouth of
[29:16] god to william branham to the ear of
[29:18] william brown because the time had come
[29:20] where it was william branham completely
[29:23] the mouth of god and to be the mouth of
[29:26] god then it has to be god
[29:30] inside that veil
[29:32] that's why he says he says i didn't hear
[29:34] the voice coming from the outside but
[29:36] something within me inside of me it's
[29:39] that the inside of him in the in that
[29:42] compartment of the heart of william
[29:44] branham
[29:46] enthroned on his throne
[29:49] was the lord jesus christ
[29:52] so that the voice would not come out
[29:55] from mouth to ear but from within a man
[30:00] that voice would speak so that no one
[30:03] else could receive
[30:06] or touch that word
[30:09] because in the beginning
[30:10] that's where the fall that's why the
[30:12] fall happened the word of god was taken
[30:15] by the serpent and he he was he fiddled
[30:18] with it and the word of god cannot be
[30:20] touched by human hands it has to be god
[30:23] himself speaking
[30:26] so that it can be
[30:28] his unadulterated word now consider
[30:31] the prophet continues reading now i
[30:33] didn't hear no voice it was like
[30:35] something on inside of me spoke i just
[30:37] have to tell you the truth just exactly
[30:40] what happened
[30:41] something hit me something hit and said
[30:44] don't fear
[30:45] this is that third pool third pool you
[30:50] remember it
[30:52] he said
[30:53] you've had so many impersonators on this
[30:57] what you tried to explain
[31:00] but said don't even try this don't even
[31:04] try to explain this do you remember it
[31:07] brother branham says how many remembers
[31:09] that vision why it's it's it's all over
[31:11] the tape and everywhere that's been
[31:12] about six seven years ago and he said
[31:14] don't try to explain that said this is
[31:16] the third pool but i will meet you
[31:20] in
[31:21] there
[31:22] can you say man brothers
[31:25] now i'm gonna go to another message
[31:28] the message is uh
[31:30] what was the holy spirit given for
[31:33] the prophet says
[31:34] now notice
[31:37] here's another thing i'd like to say
[31:39] right here
[31:40] jesus said
[31:42] as the father hath has sent me
[31:46] as the father has sent me so send i you
[31:50] very well open up your bible so that we
[31:52] can read the scriptures so you can see
[31:53] that what the prophet is quoting it is
[31:56] correct it says in saint john chapter 20
[31:58] verse 21. uh he's quoting
[32:01] um the the scripture by memory and and
[32:04] now you keep that scripture open
[32:07] so that when uh when i repeat it again
[32:10] uh you'll have it there the scripture
[32:12] reads like this saint john 20 21.
[32:17] then said jesus to them again
[32:19] peace be unto you
[32:22] as my father
[32:23] hath sent me
[32:25] even so
[32:26] send i
[32:28] you
[32:29] is that right is that what scripture the
[32:31] prophet is speaking or quoting yes well
[32:34] now let's see the interpretation of that
[32:36] scripture the prophet said
[32:39] he said there's three things that you
[32:41] should not do
[32:42] that's dislocate the word it's to take
[32:46] it out of its place
[32:47] uh misplace the word put it where it
[32:50] doesn't belong and you must not
[32:52] misinterpret the word
[32:54] because god is his own interpreter
[32:57] isn't that what the prophet said
[32:58] but then he also said that a prophet
[33:01] is the divine interpreter
[33:04] of the divine word
[33:06] therefore when the
[33:08] prophet it gives us the explanation of
[33:11] what the scripture means if you and i
[33:14] say anything contrary then we are
[33:17] misinterpreting the scripture
[33:20] we should repeat exactly how he said it
[33:23] very well
[33:24] he continues reading now notice here's
[33:26] another thing i like to say brother
[33:28] branham says jesus said
[33:30] as the father has sent me
[33:33] now
[33:36] watch as the father has sent me so send
[33:39] i you as the father how did the father
[33:42] send him the father that sent him come
[33:44] down from heaven and dwelt in him he
[33:46] went forth he said i always do that
[33:48] which pleases my father see he went
[33:51] about doing the things that the father
[33:53] was showing him to do
[33:55] and he said i do nothing except my
[33:57] father chose me first
[34:00] the god that sent him
[34:02] was
[34:03] on the inside of him
[34:07] very simple very easy
[34:09] the fa the god that sent him was on the
[34:12] inside of him and as the father sent me
[34:17] the same in other words the same way
[34:18] that the father has sent me so send i
[34:22] you
[34:24] so i send you what is it
[34:27] this is god
[34:28] in you
[34:30] in us
[34:31] caring on what the same works
[34:34] the same works that jesus did jesus said
[34:38] he that believeth
[34:41] he that has
[34:43] me on the inside of him
[34:46] so the one that believeth has
[34:49] jesus inside of him the holy spirit now
[34:53] we believe him to to the degree that
[34:55] belongs to us but we can't believe like
[34:56] william branham
[34:58] because look brother i i want you to
[35:00] make sure that you know what i'm
[35:02] speaking of the prophet brought
[35:04] discernment
[35:07] and and and he would always take us to
[35:09] saint john chapter four
[35:11] and he would repeat and repeat and he
[35:13] would say he say once again the scene is
[35:16] repeated again here's a woman just as
[35:19] the samaritan woman was there he says i
[35:21] i'm unknown to this person and she
[35:23] doesn't know me and then he would begin
[35:25] to bring forth what was in the heart of
[35:27] the woman that he was praying for the
[35:29] prophet said this is the last sign that
[35:31] the world receives is that right
[35:33] brothers
[35:35] i don't want you to fail in this
[35:37] there is no other man
[35:39] it's not not brother garcia that can
[35:42] come with that sign of the messiah
[35:46] like the prophet did
[35:48] i want it to soak in right
[35:51] there's only one man could do all of the
[35:54] works one man i'm not talking about a
[35:56] group or a church i'm speaking about one
[35:58] man because the church can bring certain
[36:00] things into operation
[36:03] and i'll touch on that
[36:05] but one man
[36:07] i
[36:08] can't do it without you and you can't do
[36:11] it without me as a local church
[36:13] but this man william branham didn't need
[36:16] anyone
[36:18] because he had believed and within him
[36:23] god was
[36:24] there the same god
[36:27] that walked here 2 000 years ago came
[36:31] back to the earth in the body
[36:34] of william marion branham
[36:37] now
[36:38] and i read it didn't i i'll read it
[36:40] again oh
[36:42] i i can see your thoughts
[36:44] oh brother garcia sure is adding a whole
[36:46] bunch no no no it's not brother garcia
[36:49] he says he that believeth
[36:52] is he that has me on the inside of him
[36:54] the holy spirit he that believeth that's
[36:57] already witnessed my resurrection
[37:00] who showed us that jesus christ is alive
[37:04] william branham came
[37:06] and he had to go throughout the entire
[37:09] history he went through malachi's and
[37:12] hosea micah jeremiah isaiah
[37:16] daniel
[37:17] joel
[37:18] and he went to moses and
[37:20] he went beyond that into eternity
[37:24] and he brought jesus out of history and
[37:26] he presented him alive amongst us he
[37:28] said he's alive and to prove that he's
[37:31] alive
[37:32] your name is sanchez and you live on
[37:35] that lincoln street
[37:37] i've never seen you but to prove to you
[37:40] your father's name is such and such who
[37:42] was doing that was it william branham no
[37:45] it was god
[37:47] enthroned inside that man
[37:50] but you should
[37:52] rightly divide the word and discern one
[37:54] thing from the other so that you don't
[37:57] fall into error not only did he only do
[38:00] that but when that child was dead there
[38:02] in finland
[38:04] because the son does nothing unless the
[38:06] father shows him first is that right so
[38:09] when the the prophet would say
[38:11] he says you know you see me waiting so
[38:14] then people thought
[38:15] the william branham didn't have any
[38:18] authority
[38:19] or that he didn't he had no way to move
[38:22] but he was saying clearly that he
[38:24] couldn't do anything until everything
[38:26] was placed correctly in its order
[38:29] because he was an obedient son he was
[38:31] not clowning around for anyone you see
[38:34] he said write it on the fly leafs of
[38:35] your bible
[38:37] and when the moment came
[38:39] that they arrived to where that child
[38:41] was there that had been killed by an
[38:43] automobile
[38:44] when he saw that it was the babe a child
[38:47] he told brother moore
[38:49] he says hold on now i'm going to go to
[38:51] the mountain to pray
[38:53] and to fast to see what god is going to
[38:55] tell me
[38:57] or he he went to the telephone and he
[38:58] called jeffersonville and he said hey
[39:00] listen i need all the church to be
[39:01] praying that's not what he did he said
[39:04] watch if it doesn't happen
[39:06] he went to the people he says now if
[39:08] this boy isn't resurrected from the dead
[39:10] then you can cast me out of your nation
[39:12] i challenge anyone
[39:14] i challenge garcia or coleman or any
[39:17] other man to do this
[39:19] just one man can do this
[39:23] he said
[39:24] cast me out
[39:25] and then he says
[39:26] when
[39:36] he says that the spirit that was in him
[39:38] the spirit that was within brother
[39:40] branham came out
[39:41] and he went and he brought that other
[39:44] spirit back and put him inside that
[39:47] child that child was resurrected what is
[39:49] that he that believeth
[39:52] has me inside of him brother
[39:55] how could he not
[39:58] lift
[39:59] resurrect the dead if if it was jesus
[40:01] christ himself living in him he said i
[40:03] am the resurrection and alive
[40:06] brother i don't have to trust in no one
[40:09] else
[40:10] as long as i trust where god is at i
[40:13] trust completely
[40:16] if i trust then i am in the day of
[40:18] redemption i continue reading
[40:20] he that believeth and that's already
[40:23] witnessed my tech resurrection and know
[40:26] that i'm in him
[40:28] tremendous no
[40:30] there's many people that don't even know
[40:31] if they've been born again
[40:33] but he knew
[40:34] when he challenged those ministers in
[40:36] chicago he says why don't you stand over
[40:38] here on my right side to challenge me
[40:39] they knew better
[40:41] that they would stay that they would die
[40:43] there he says he says and know that i'm
[40:46] in him he that's in me and if you bite
[40:49] in me my words abide in you
[40:53] the word of the
[40:54] lord comes to the prophet is that right
[40:56] well i'm gonna go to another part
[40:58] paragraph 74.
[41:00] is that too heavy too much meat for you
[41:02] brothers is the steak too big
[41:04] should we leave it alone are you
[41:05] noticing brother raymond
[41:07] listen closely
[41:09] that's why the people say
[41:10] accuses of being crazy paragraph 74 and
[41:13] it'll take you to the scripture that
[41:14] we've been reading 20 messages mark 11
[41:17] 23 says say to this mountain be moved
[41:20] don't doubt in your heart
[41:22] but believe that what you said's going
[41:25] to come to pass it's not you that
[41:28] speaketh
[41:29] but the father that dwelleth in you
[41:33] he do with the talking
[41:36] now i didn't hear no voice
[41:39] but like on the inside of me something
[41:41] spoke it's the father that's to speak oh
[41:44] brothers if the revelation doesn't come
[41:46] down with this i don't know when it'll
[41:48] ever come down to you
[41:50] it is the father that's to speak
[41:52] it's not you that's speaking to the
[41:55] mountain it's not you talking to that
[41:57] mountain it it'll be the father that's
[41:59] in you speaking
[42:02] to that mountain
[42:04] and then it that mountain
[42:07] has to move
[42:10] all heavens and earth will pass away he
[42:12] said
[42:13] but my
[42:14] spirit shall not pass away or my word
[42:19] shall not
[42:21] pass away
[42:22] so
[42:23] it has to be fulfilled exactly as it's
[42:26] written do you believe it brothers
[42:28] paragraph 43
[42:31] he's speaking about a birth
[42:34] so as i don't read everything
[42:36] he says when a birth came brother brown
[42:37] says the next thing happened
[42:41] there come a birth into that home that's
[42:42] when the holy spirit another spirit came
[42:44] in which was a son that son he was not
[42:46] in full charge neither was he an heir
[42:49] until he got a certain
[42:52] age
[42:54] and he had to be proved first yes and
[42:58] then they had the law of adoption
[43:01] to you ministers
[43:02] the placing i'm speaking about the
[43:04] placing of a son is what i'm speaking of
[43:06] now see then when he come to a place to
[43:10] where
[43:11] he was adopted
[43:13] page 15 paragraph 47
[43:18] and then when this boy got to a certain
[43:20] age
[43:21] say
[43:22] let's let's say that he was matured if
[43:24] that boy was just a renegade
[43:27] no good didn't care for the father's
[43:29] business
[43:31] all he thought about was uh
[43:33] flirting and running with the women's or
[43:36] drinking or gambling or
[43:39] horse racing
[43:41] that boy would always be a son
[43:44] but he was never placed in position
[43:49] to have air
[43:51] to all
[43:52] his father had
[43:56] let me remind you
[43:58] when
[43:59] when brother roy robertson was there at
[44:01] the table of the lord he said brother
[44:02] branham you were set
[44:04] at the head of the table
[44:07] the main one
[44:09] you were placed there at the head of the
[44:11] table isn't that right amen now notice
[44:15] now but if he was a good boy
[44:18] and he was
[44:21] always about the father's business
[44:23] and he proved to be the right child
[44:25] then they had a ceremony
[44:28] out there on the street
[44:30] they took the boy out
[44:32] into the street and put a white robe on
[44:35] him it was more whiter than the cloud
[44:38] and they set him on a scaffold so all
[44:41] the city could see
[44:44] after that they made a feast
[44:46] and the feast already happened and then
[44:49] afterwards a jubilee in other words a
[44:52] rapture oh blessed be the name of the
[44:54] lord
[44:55] you see
[44:56] i'm waiting for that jubilee brothers
[45:00] and the father then had the ceremony
[45:02] brought about the ceremony of adoption
[45:04] he adopted his own son
[45:07] into his own business
[45:10] and then the son
[45:12] was co-equal
[45:15] with his father do you believe it
[45:17] brothers
[45:20] should i repeat it again he was co-equal
[45:23] he had the same right the son had the
[45:25] same rights as the father can you say
[45:27] amen to this brothers
[45:28] now i'm going to read a few more
[45:30] paragraphs more and i'm just going to be
[45:32] jumping can you come to the piano and do
[45:34] the organs so that i can begin to close
[45:37] so that i can uh keep my promise
[45:39] brothers the prophet is speaking here on
[45:42] marriage or divorce and marriage or
[45:44] marriage and divorce
[45:45] and here it everything
[45:48] this is covered by all this is covered
[45:51] this covers all of those that don't want
[45:53] to obey certain things just because they
[45:55] live in phoenix or live in
[45:56] jeffersonville the prophet says this
[45:59] now you believe
[46:01] this to be true and believe it to come
[46:03] from god
[46:05] and by vindication of his cloud
[46:09] and his message that's brought me this
[46:11] far
[46:12] should not god upon the mountain permit
[46:16] me to do the same thing
[46:18] to suffer you to go on the way you are
[46:21] and do it no more go with your wives and
[46:24] live in peace
[46:25] for the hour is late the coming of the
[46:28] lord is at hand
[46:31] we haven't got time to break these
[46:33] things up but don't you dare try to do
[46:35] it again i'm speaking only to my
[46:37] congregation brother branham says but if
[46:39] you're married and god bore me witness
[46:42] of that that on that mountain
[46:44] that i could say this
[46:46] a supernatural revelation
[46:49] because of the opening of the seven
[46:51] seals and this is a question
[46:54] in god's word he's god told them let
[46:57] them go on in
[46:59] as they are
[47:01] and sin
[47:03] no more
[47:05] who's speaking
[47:06] it was the father
[47:08] inside the vessel
[47:11] that he had
[47:12] or has here on earth
[47:14] who can forgive sins only god can do it
[47:18] just as the father has sent me
[47:21] i
[47:22] send you
[47:25] when jesus said
[47:26] your sins which are many have been
[47:29] forgiven they said who can forgive sins
[47:32] only god can forgive sins and how can
[47:33] this man forgive sins they didn't know
[47:36] that the father had come down from
[47:38] heaven he came down from glory and was
[47:40] living in the tabernacle called jesus
[47:43] christ and in this 20th century as the
[47:45] father has sent me i send you
[47:48] jesus christ came down
[47:50] in the prophet and he's saying the same
[47:53] things that jesus had said
[47:56] over 2000 years ago page 50.
[48:00] he says
[48:02] now
[48:03] i'm speaking only to my congregation
[48:05] friends and then i'm closing you can go
[48:07] from this
[48:08] now i'm speaking to our followers only
[48:11] who is following me and this message
[48:13] only not the outside
[48:16] this is
[48:18] this is only for my congregation he said
[48:19] over here but over here he says this is
[48:22] only for those that follow my message
[48:25] there's another climax coming brothers
[48:34] there's very few that hadn't
[48:37] the lord jesus christ told the prophet
[48:39] there's another tabernacle this is not
[48:40] your tabernacle and he took him to go
[48:43] see a great cathedral there's a second
[48:45] climax coming blessed be the name of the
[48:47] lord
[48:48] this is not your tabernacle
[48:51] he says but this is only for those that
[48:53] follow my message
[48:55] you see brothers there perhaps there's a
[48:57] congregation in phoenix and another
[48:58] congregation in some other city but not
[49:01] all are following the message that god
[49:05] brought
[49:07] this is for those that follow the
[49:09] message that william branham brought
[49:11] brother that's where the authority is at
[49:14] to forgive sins to restore you brothers
[49:18] because the day of redemption
[49:21] is at hand
[49:23] and the prophet said it
[49:25] in two messages that i can quote the
[49:27] statue of a perfect man
[49:42] the message of the second appearing of
[49:44] elijah shall sweep the earth
[49:47] the bride he says has not yet had her uh
[49:50] her revival and when is this gonna
[49:52] happen he says when
[49:54] the hour
[49:56] has counted down to zero when their time
[50:00] shall be no more the prophet says when
[50:01] this happens
[50:03] is when the director then moves his
[50:06] conduct
[50:08] his wand and he says time is no more and
[50:11] then it returns
[50:13] and then countdown begins seven six
[50:17] that's the resurrection
[50:19] seven six five four three
[50:21] two
[50:22] one
[50:23] and then the bride gathered in palestine
[50:28] and the man there dressed with god's
[50:31] holy vestures with us
[50:33] sword in his hand
[50:35] and around him the entire bride of jesus
[50:38] christ is around him it is a day of
[50:40] redemption it is the resurrection
[50:43] it's the day that i'm waiting trusting
[50:46] totally
[50:48] in the sacrifice of jesus christ
[50:51] but jesus christ in his mercy the lamb
[50:54] took the bump
[50:56] open the book
[50:58] tore the seals
[50:59] and he gave the title deed to william
[51:02] branham
[51:03] and that's where i'm waiting
[51:06] i'm trusting in that that's where i put
[51:08] all of my faith not in my own
[51:10] righteousness but in the sacrifice of
[51:13] jesus christ
[51:15] who has done all of this possible don't
[51:17] you love him brothers
[51:19] let us pray oh
[51:31] help your people
[51:43] make yourself alive in us help us lord
[51:47] to be able to receive all of the word
[51:50] that has come out of your mouth
[51:53] thank you lord
[51:56] amen
[51:57] and amen
[52:05] uh
[52:23] you
