man and uh he i know he has something special in his heart and we let's just pray that the lord anoint him anoint his lips okay and that you may be able to receive him that which you come for i know we come expecting you know sometimes in our minds it's pretty hard to just let go of those strongholds that the enemy has us enslaved to maybe we don't need any deliverance of the body maybe we're healed already maybe we're healed of maybe the soul but something disturbs us in our spirit you know um and if you need that tonight i know i do i i battle every day in my mind like brother bannon teaches us the greatest battle ever five was in the mind amen so if you if you just need deliverance even in just in that which is a big thing then you came to the right place amen the lord can do anything and i stand here as a testimony as a witness and my lord jesus christ lives that he's real mediocre is real mediocre grace grace amen for aid would you stand with me it was grace for i once was a slave and i thank you lord jesus i do not know but i'm a slave to you lord my oh is one more time think about it my birthday is is boy god bless you good evening today is a very special day no not because i came here to speak it's because you came here to hear from the lord and i believe with all my heart and with faith that you will receive exactly what you're expecting because you have to have expectations and you also have to have a faith to be here and you being here shows that you're expecting now i'm back there i don't i don't mean to be mischievous but when he says do you know brother esteban burunda three four people maybe raise their hands but my name is esteban burunda i belong i'm that's my dad alex burunda and olga burunda those are my parents okay no one special i'm a sinner saved by grace saved by his amazing grace not just no ordinary grace it was god's amazing grace it's what god did for me way before the foundation all the way to the cross that's what he did for me and that's why i can stand right here but i want to share with you i don't have too much time but i really love that song the course one more time so i can really relax i want to relax don't you want to relax i want to relax i want to let god have his way with me not even with me but with all of us you know this is your house i don't have a frown i've never seen anybody go to their own house and have a frown unless unless you you don't want to go home you know some people say i don't want to go home i'm sorry because it's hell at home well you know i'm sorry for that but there's a antidote for that there's a there's a there's a fix for that we could get it tonight and you could go home and say wherever i go jesus is welcome for you know it says so you can say this is my home and in his home we shall serve the lord is weren't you bought or he's still in the pawn shop if you don't know i'll tell you tonight beyond all of them he looked past and saw one knee and that was for jesus christ me thank you very much it really is good to be a christian it's really good to be a christian you know today or in this month is it's october you may be seated arabs preparing buying candy and and all these treats because they want to go trick-or-treating you know uh this is one person that the satan is not going to pull a trick on okay in fact i'm going to amass him and i'm going to reveal him as a old stinking liar old serpent that he is the same devil in the beginning the same devil on jesus time the same devil today the only thing is that he doesn't know he's defeated already do you know he's defeated already i know he's defeated let's go to isaiah isaiah chapter one let us stand for the word please chapter 1 verse 16. reads like this wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow come now and let us reason together says the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow though they shall be red like crimson they shall be as wool let's borrow heads dearie father lord bless your word lord jesus lord i bless you with my lips with my heart lord jesus may you have preeminence lord come down and liberate all those that need liberation lord jesus lord reveal to those that have not been revealed lord jesus that they've been liberated lord this is all for you lord jesus all the honor and glory lord amen reading the scripture you may be seated reading the scripture there's only one word i could really sum this up to and that is one word a conference conference that's what god was calling and he was calling for a conference a conference is usually when he wants to settle things he wants to get it over with let's get the punches over with let's get what's holding you back and let's move on let's settle things let's serve god and let's move on so i took this extract from brother branham we're going to read and then god has held some great conferences there come a time in god's great economy where here had where there had to be a conference held let's talk about the very first one that was held in the garden of eden and the first one was called good call of the earth was in the garden of eden when the angels of god come home weeping saying your child has fallen he sinned and he's broken your commandments something had to be done the creature of god had fallen from grace and was a subject unto eternal separation from presence of his god and his maker it was a crucial moment for the king of heaven had said the day you eat thereof the day you shall surely die and putting his trust into his son his son had broke his commandment there had to be something done it was his creation it was the work of his own hand it was a love of his heart the apple of his high wow today if you don't know that you're the love of his heart the apple of his eye i pray that the lord reveal it to you something must be done so there had to be a conference called there was a conference called at the red sea there's way too many conferences through the scriptures and through the bible and to to actually condense it right now in the time that i have so if i jump around you'll understand there was a conference called at the red sea israel was trapped with no escape they stopped that's the worst mistake that the church of god can ever do do you know that the enemy is right behind you always at your heels you know we had a camp we've had a camp kids are on fire children are on fire they receive the holy ghost you know what happened they stopped they stopped we must understand that the devil is always right behind them always right behind us when i ex when i received my experience i went home when i went home soon as i got home the next day i had vato locos calling me and showing me how much of how much ounces and how much this come on come on there's not the devil's always ready there to test your experience and he's gonna test everybody that's what's happening i'm sorry but black is black white is white inside egypt they were his people when he left they became his church church means the called out they called out but they're playing footsie still they're playing footsies they stopped pitched their tents started bickering complaining wanting to turn back oh

my tweeting my skyping your phone brother my skyping i want you to look at this okay it may be funny but this is what's happening through the fourth dimension satan is laughing every one of these have gone through the fourth dimension and that's where the battle is people tend and they fail they fail to understand that the battle is not ours the battle is not flesh for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but of principalities and powers of the air we don't understand that the battle is in the air the fourth dimension that's where god satan is actually laughing he's viewing your pictures he's viewing your texts now brother i can't stand them because he always says how it is they stopped the picture tense started bickering complaining wanted to turn back moses called the conference he was panicking israel wanted to turn back they wanted to stone him by a cleft of the rock he called god on a scene god came down and he said why cry moses speak and move forward speak and move forward don't you know i'm a miracle working god look what i'm going to do for you look what i have done for you i sent you with the rod i showed you my glory i showed you everything i am that i am not that i was i am now i will be and i always will that is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same god who's a miracle working god back in the days of moses is the same god who's going to make the way the same god who made a way for me pin oh that was a step one that was a steroid you cannot tell me that god isn't real that was a step on methamphetamine a scumbag a gang member i don't want to go into particulars all right we're going to go on youtube cops might be at my door or the olvato locos i ran into one of the old friends he just got out of prison hey also i heard heard you're doing good i came out of my house i was eating something i was gonna leave my mom's house and he was all tatted down he said man how can you be ignoring me i said i didn't know i knew he got

and i i don't have jaden house religion and he's uh what was it then it's the holy ghost and he went like this and stumbled backwards i said that's right it's the holy ghost the same lord that delivered moses to deliver you today he delivered me which i am right here today don't you know i'm a miracle working god speak that's what we got to do we got to speak to him there's a conference that's been called can't have a conference without you answering the call you know you need a conference but you don't want to it you want you don't want to answer it don't you ever stop don't you ever be found guilty did you know the church of god would be found guilty if they stopped don't you ever be found guilty of stopping you came from camp right now whatever the deal is you might be found guilty for stopping i'm on fire i received an experience yes yes we're serving the lord serving the lord the enemy is always one to two steps behind you and if and if he isn't then he's got you already conferences that's where i'm getting it from they were on their march after being separated and called out people and they come to the red sea and they had to call it halt they couldn't so you don't know it's just a step one this is the prophet's words okay you call him the liar you tell him to shut up but you can't tell him because it's already been spoken and it's never going to go away and they had to call a halt and they couldn't cross over the great general joshua had to raise his hand and and sound the trumpet stop quit marching there's an obstacle before us we have the mountains on each side we're down in the valley that's where the fighting happens in the gutter in the valley and we have to stop and when the church ever stops that's when satan takes over we're not going to stop are we we're not going to stop are we that's when satan takes over got to move constantly rapidly marching towards zion don't let the church of the living god ever be guilty of stopping it's not only the church the world needs to see us the world needs to hear the gospel the world is to see us in action and he's we need to bear the fruit we need to be the very christ we might be the only christ that they will ever see in their life so what kind of christ are you showing them huh you you're a drug addict you relate to the garcias and as soon as they stopped and pitched their tents and began to rest a while they heard a rumbling of the wheels and the only way the escape was to go backwards and here comes pharaoh's army moving to block it off to block the channel satan is trying to block the church of the living god from that channel directly to him amen more technology let's give him more technology all through the all through the televisions you hear be careful it's the zombie apocalypse i'll show you a zombie apocalypse and you might be part of it oh text i can't take away my oh oh oh texting zombie apocalypse he's got you already he's got your mind already saiyan's army has blocked off the fellowship with the things of the word education aas don't talk to bas bas don't talk to aas masters don't talk to phds high school diploma i'll talk to anybody i know doctors i work out with doctors i go to doctors and i and i talk with them and to hear them and the doctors they say how do you understand this brother branham we weren't we weren't told to to understand it

anchor holds but sister just like brothers brandon said to that brother they said my my wife she's a saint she's a saint said brother she looks like a hank she had pancake or whatever you want whole cake makeup like this pencil tight shirt skirt but you come up here and seeing your anchors holds brother or sister it looked like your anchor just moved up you set sail and went to the world we need to let jesus christ the captain of the ship back aboard the ship to stir you back to his word i'm running out of time five minutes one of the greatest conferences ever called besides all the one the other ones is the reason why we stay here and let's go to that conference right now in the garden of gethsemane i want to say thank you to the brothers when i said oh jesus christ the holy spirit left him and i s and and jarred me and he said yes he left them in the garden and so i went to the scriptures i said yes lord yes lord but how could you even get through the whipping post i don't understand it you're just you're a man i said lord help me out it's in the scripture lord if you have any question a biblical question it's in the word matthew 26 36 i started the reading the first sentence it says the mount of olives i was like the type of the holy spirit to a certain part guard the garden of gethsemane i said wait a minute gethsemane i looked it up and it says an oil press it means an oil press jesus christ had a custom to go to the mount of olives after every preaching after every big revival he had five thousand ten thousand when he needed time for himself with him and his father to be refilled to be comforted to be that's where he would go but this time was a different visit it was to the garden of gethsemane meaning an oil press there come a time where the spirit was leading the lamb the dove there had to be a conference between the lamb and the dove father and son the lamb and a dove and they formed the place and said it after the supper that night they crossed over a little brook and sidron and our or somewhere and went across the brook and went into the garden in gethsemane they had to have a conference and christ had to take talk it over the lamb and the dove they had a parent teacher conference they had a parent teacher conference he called it jesus christ answered it they went to talk it over you want to hear what he said you want to hear what the conference was it involves all of you the lamb and the dove had to sit together it was the dove that had to talk to the lamb and it was the lamb's death now when it they sit up by the rock and all the angels angels came down from heaven to listen to them comfort in the conference oh there was gabriel michael woodrum all the thousands of them sitting around the rock that's luke chapter 22 he was strengthened by angels when he would go there but this time there was thousands and thousands of them but now the father said are you willing um all done the conference was set and the lamb young beautiful life i'm running out of time is your love for your brethren great enough is your love for the sinful stinking world that you were born in do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to bear their sins to the hardest crucial death you there could be nothing die that kind of death but him and in that conference such a decision was made until the blood dropped from his brow he was under a strain the human body jesus was under a strain with you and i the saints the future and everybody on his soul and his soul was being pressed that pushed he didn't grieve or wronged the holy spirit it pushed it pressed the holy spirit away he had to die a man that's why the anointing had to leave him i searched it out i said why i said god you went to the whipping post lord your body isn't made that way i was shot i went into shock i was bleeding to death severed artery shattered leg and there i am getting weak but he he went 24 hours after whipping post being slashed being punched being bruised the bible says he was bruised he was bruised for my transgressions the word bruise means smashed it wasn't like ali got a bruise smashed pulverized to a pulp he was bruised for our transgressions there could not be nothing nothing died the kind of death but him and at the conference such a decision was made into the blood dropped from his brow and he was under a strain the sins of the world upon him and then he looked into the face of dove because they were communicating at the rock not i will father he asked him three times in a prayer father abba father that's like telling your dad a nickname father take it from me but thy will the man jesus was crying out take it but i was sent for a mission not my will but thy will be done when he left the garden he was dead already he was a dead man walking jesus christ entered jesus christ left jesus a dead man walking he died to himself that shows we should die to ourselves because he died to himself he carried it on he was beaten all night long beards ripped from his face spit on i know how it is to be spit on i was in the gutter i was actually spit on i roamed the streets with no shirt and shoes because i was just beside myself all i could worry about was just another fix because i couldn't take what i've been through i couldn't take it because all the sins that i was carrying i knew i was wrong but i didn't want to answer the conference call god was calling me all through that time maybe you're a sinner i'm out of time you could come to the piano maybe you're a sinner and i have done so much sin this is brother branham this a step one maybe you smoke till you can't smoke no more and can't quit it maybe if you've drank till you can't drink no more and you can't quit it maybe you come to the place where you're so full of sin and lust that you look at any other woman and have to have 30 thoughts of her maybe you come to a place where you just can't take it there's many people today that have come onto the press there's a press right now there's a press right now and it's through the fourth dimension where the battle is going on and satan is sending this press down to your earth where it's falling upon us and many of us who went like this close the bible because of the press and the trials and tribulations that they're having in their family if anybody had a reason to quit it was jesus he had the right to quit he wanted a life he was beautiful brother brown said he had a choice he could have had a wife he could have had a family he couldn't live but he forfeited he was a normal man but god was in him to the forest he could speak things into existence crush the tree and he wouldn't bear fruit maybe if you come to a block or maybe you've been perverted your own natural resources this is brother branham this is brother branham i'm gonna share something with you quickly it's close it's in the church it's in the church i was at the gym working out doing some curls i looked to my right there was a man that i recognized i thought i heard some girls talking and aye aye papa get chulo this does not turn around the heck it was men talking they're all wearing pink and and tights and i was like lord i know this person and when we made eye contact he took off and what i what i asked the lord i said lord how do i approach him how can i tell him it's okay to come back there's a conference waiting for him how could it and i got my answer there's a conference call there's a conference waiting i don't care where you're at brother branham says god's still ready to come to you in a conference and talk it over with you maybe if you broke up your home maybe if you left your husband maybe your husband left you or maybe your husband's about to leave you this is what i say to that you come back to the conference if your husband's gonna leave you show them the door say this is my house and for me in my house we shall serve the lord if you close the bible because your husband has put the pressure on you go back to the word be the christ he needs to see continue to fight the fight don't go to the world to please your husband don't start the drug so you can be a sexy model like your husband wants to see in the world god made you the way you are he made you perfect maybe you left your husband or left your wife maybe
