I'm so all [Music] my [Music] you may be seated Breen we greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ please please forgive me uh my throat is a little irritated right now but we are going to present this young gentleman that is very handsome and you all know that we don't baptize the [Music] children the name of the child is Matthew malachia Chavez it's Matthew Malachi chave Chavez his father Gustavo Chavez is Gustavo Chavez mother and his mother L Chavez is LTE Chavez and we have his grandfather the grandmother I don't know if the grandmother sister com on up here [Music] sister we know that we are in the December festivities thank you and it turns out Brothers not for anything today I am 75 years [Music] old no no no no I didn't do it for that cause [Music] but I was born in December 14th of 1939 on the Thursday evening and so that's why I love these festivities and I believe that we all love [Music] them so this is why we will present this child and you guys know the scriptures principal the the principal scripture maros St Mark uh 10 10 13 and it says like this and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuke those that brought [Music] them but when Jesus saw it he was displeased he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such in the is the kingdom of God another scripture Matthew 1810 and this is a [Music] scripture that comes to me as in a way of sadness listen to this take heed that you despise not one of these little ones [Music] for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in [Music] heaven when one doesn't understand Brothers they treat their children obligating them to serve the [Music] Lord that's not how it is and I committed many errors not errors or Horrors and that's what sens me but we can't fix what happened in the past but yes the present we can and this scripture is not just for brother Gustavo or sister LTE but for all the grandparents for all the parents and also most importantly for your [Music] matrimony one commits many mistakes for not saying other [Music] words but knowing that we are in mid [Music] December there's a sister that I know and we all know her Al and she's the wife of her brother Juan Al she was Catholic [Music] once I don't know how many of you were Catholics but in this day or in the 24th or 25th of December uh the [Music] Catholics they have a feast and they buy some sort of um uh [Music] figurines but they were really really nice and wake up they raise him [Music] up on the 6th of January and they call it the the day of the Holy [Music] Kings and I heard such thing is it sister is it is it right sister they tell me that instead of buying that little figurine they would let me [Music] borrow they would lend me I don't know why but what I do know is that all of us and all all of [Music] you we are precious or we are beautiful and handsome to the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we are going to pray brother gust take the child in your hands and we are going to pray Matthew malachia Chavez his name is Matthew Malachi Chavez I would say the third but brother I believe that he wouldn't like taken because he is Junior this one should be the third but congratulations [Music] brother let us bow our heads Lord Jesus [Music] Christ our brother Gustavo Lord has his grandson in his arms [Music] and we have sister Alia his grandmother and his parents brother [Music] Gustavo and his mother [Music] L Matthew malachia Chavez his name is I will repeat again Matthew Malachi Chavez Lord the scripture that I read on Matthew 1810 broke my heart [Music] Lord because one doesn't understand Lord and I'm telling my brother Gustavo and his wife that this child and all of his family you heavenly father have placed it in their hands so that he would guide them and may take care of [Music] them and may not mistreat them but may they instruct them like your word says Lord Proverbs 22 instruct the child in his way and when he gets older may he not depart from him Lord we present him in your hands Lord in the hands of his parents and in the hands of his grandparents so that they may take care of him may they protect [Music] them but not mistre [Music] Lord help us Lord may they not commit the same mistake that we made

that he would anoint our ears to hear would you come this morning Father and be with us it would be our most sincere prayer that it would be that way we ask your blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you'd like to turn with me to the scripture like I'd like to start reading we're going to be turning to First Peter 58 good morning buos I'd like to wish brother Lo a happy birthday he's one of the pillars here in Phoenix Tabernacle phoen I believe that we should respect the pillars of the church the ones who help helped establish Us in the Faith 1 Peter 5 8 through1 reads like this be sober be villig because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you now if you'd like to turn with me to Ephesians 6th chapter and we're going to start with verse 10 and it reads like this finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might Hallelujah put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GT about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and having and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the Gospel above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of Salvation And The Sword of the spirit which is the word of God and one more place I'd like to turn in the scripture to Daniel 12 verse one and at that time Michael and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standed for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word now we've been speaking about how that there was this great battle that started in heaven and the Bible tells us that before the foundation of the world that God predestinated an army to fight this end Time battle and that it that how it was God that personally selected this Army and he trained them and he qualified them and he put a seal upon them seal of the Holy Ghost and then he placed them positionally in the mystical body of Jesus Christ and then he commissioned them to go out into all the world and to preach the gospel to demonstrate the same works that the master did and that they should confront the enemy in a face to face battle and that it would be a hand toand combat every Army equips their soldiers with the best weapons that they can develop and the sophistication of that certain Weaponry is what gives one Army the superiority over the other isn't that right that's why we're always trying to develop the best weapon that gives us the the superiority over all the world the best aircraft the best fighters and that's that's what we look for but the prophet told us that God in the beginning from before there was even an earth here that he placed into the hands of his children the best weapon that there could ever be and he said he placed his word he put his word before them and brother brandham told us that the word plows a ditch and that all we need to do is follow behind it but it was the best weapon that the Father the great Creator the one who has all the wisdom he chose the best weapon and he chose his word and he equipped his children with that and all the way from the Garden of Eden until the Rapture it's the same weapon and today I want to focus in on that weapon I believe it's a secret weapon it's the belie secret weapon and the in the last two times that I spoke we talked about the Battle and how it is that it it it it began to be set in Array and how that the prophet talk to us about the inner solar system those three circles and how that we needed to have a new order that we had to be redesigned because the plan of God was interrupted and the evil one came and he interrupted the plan but it was all in the father's mind that that would take place and that he could demonstrate his fullness that he could show us that he was a savior that he was a Healer and he wanted to be able to demonstrate what those qual qualities that were inside of him the devil's not pulling anything over God God in the beginning knew exactly what was going that's right I'd like to read this quote taking from taken from the message take on the whole armor of God when brother Brandon preached the message the greatest battle ever fought and then he spoke wisdom versus faith and then he preached the message called the conflict between God and Satan so really you could say that the the uh these messages were sequels to the greatest battle ever [Music] fought and then when he went out into the missionary field he preached the series of taking on the whole armor of God using the same thought that he when he preached the greatest battle ever fought so it reads like this so the infinite God going to choose for his army the infinite God is going to choose for his army the best weapon that could be given and he chose it and it was his word God gave his army the best equipment that could ever that they could ever use and would never have to be changed you don't improve it it Remains the Same all the time it's God's word and that's what he fortified his people with that's tremendous isn't it fortified by the word God has equipped his army with his word trying to get the next slide oh there it is sorry paron but he equipped his army I want to speak this morning on the greatest battle ever fought and I want to put a subtitle on it the believer's hidden Mystery weapon I want to really focus in this morning on that weapon that armor that he fortified us with sometimes I think when we use when we say the the phrase the word our our attention is just limited to this book and I want to kind of expand that for us this morning the hidden Mystery weapon that has been hid from the ages and generations and is now manifested to his Saints in deuteron Deuteronomy 2929 it reads like this the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and unto our children the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children and notice why he says it is revealed to us they're revealed so that we may do all the words that are in the law so that unfolds that why we become the recipients of that we are the recipients of the revealed word so that we can make it manifest so that it'll be understood what we are to do so that's why the Mysteries were made known in this age so that the bride could fulfill all those things that were spoken but it had to be made plain to her it had to be revealed we talked about who is the one who gives the Revelation it's the father it's the one who he has predetermined to deposit that seed the one that he chose before the foundation of the world to reveal his word to that's why he told Peter blessed art thou Simon barjon flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the great hidden mystery word the hidden Mystery that has been hidden from all time but now said the Apostle Paul has been made manifest Saints what a great thing that is my goodness the importance of Revelation the prophet preached it to us over and over and over what is the secret weapon when the prophet says the word that it is the word that is the weapon I I want to open that up this morning I want I want you to realize what is the fullness of what he is speaking to us I want you to turn into your Bibles to First John 5:7 a beautiful scripture and it's one that the prophet validated for us in this age you know the theologians have a hard time with this scripture but the Believers of this message don't have a problem with it because the prophet utilized it and he explained it and he Vindicated it and it reads like this for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one now and there the the Apostle John is making that relationship for us that the Father the word and the holy ghost that they are one and there I put it there so you could see it all together the Father the Holy Ghost the creative power the Revelation it's the believer's hidden secret weapon now let's look at these two scriptures here that speak about the creative power which which which is the word which dwells in the word Hebrews 11:3 reads like this through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and in Colossians it reads like this for by him the word were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers or things were created by Him and for him remember we're targeting on the believer's hidden secret weapon the one that the heavenly father gave us the one that he gave us to battle against the wicked one now let's go back in in in the and foreshadow or see the foreshadow of this secret weapon now brother brandom takes us back before the foundation of the world and he said that the father had the capability to see the end from the beginning and it was with that capability that he wrote the Bible and then brother Bram tells us that then he was able to send it forth to the prophet and then they were they would speak it forth so that we could see what God's great plan was and God foreseen this this great battle this great end time Showdown where that battle was going that battle from Angels was going to come down and become a human battle the Bible tells us in the Book of Romans that all nature that all the creation is groaning and travaileth in pain that it travaileth in pain waiting for the main event for the main event to take place the manifestation of the sons of God brother the Bible says the creation but brother brandham says it's all nature that it's moaning and groaning and pain waiting for this special time this time in history that this event of the manifestation of the sons of God a special event that has never toen place at no time in the history of the Earth this ever tooken place but it's getting ready to unfold itself in this time that we live and we know that the closing minutes of all time are ending so somewhere some time this great event is upon us at this very minute God before the foundation of the world he had something in the back part of his mind that he wanted to achieve he wanted to express himself and he showed his his plan and brother brandham tells us that he began unfolding it little by little he began to show it in for in in Shadows and types he expressed his life through the Patriarchs and the prophets now the message tells us quite a bit about the prophets and brother brandham tells us that the word of the Lord came directly to the prophet and I want to focus in on them this morning because I believe they were a very type of that manif estation that's coming where the word of the Lord would come to the prophets when the word of the Lord was revealed to the prophet it made them different they became different men after that the Bible tells us that they stopped the mouth of lions they interrupted nature they performed Miracles they raised the dead they healed the sick they opposed Kings and they proclaimed the word of the Lord were and all this the father foreshadowing unfolding little by little his great plan that he had now I want you to notice how the word reveals itself I'm going to read these scriptures and I just want you to follow me watch how watch the difference That Came Upon This Man when the word of the Lord was revealed to him and remember we're we're focusing we want to bring our attention to that secret weapon that weapon that the father put in our hands that Paul tells us that it was hidden from before the foundation of the world but is now being revealed and it reads like this and 1 Samuel 3:7 don't turn there just listen now Samuel did not know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him and Samuel grew and the Lord was with him and he did not let none of his words fall to the ground and I I want to stop here and I want to make emphasis on that notice that this young child Prophet that he didn't let none of the words of the Lord fall to the ground I believe that's what the Bride of this age does she doesn't allow any of the words of the Prophet anything that the prophet reveal in this day she doesn't let any of it fall to the ground but she lets it fall right in here because she knows that one day that the father that that Holy Spirit will move upon that heart quicking that word seed Quicken that word seed to her 1 Samuel 3:21 reads like this and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in sh by the word of the Lord it was the word of the Lord that gave him the revelation it was something that ignited him brother brandham tells us that Jesus said that he knew us before the foundation of the world there was a conference brother Alex in heaven and we spoke to him and brother BR tells us that that time in our minds has been blacked out that we can't remember it but brother bham tells us that at that time that we Dro down he said that we were sent and that we Dro down to come here to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ I believe this morning I believe this morning that that's what we're doing we're proclaiming the gospel to this generation that we live in that the word of the Lord Has Come and it is spoken to us and it has been quickened not only has it been spoken but it's been quickened and that word is a light and it is displayed to this generation the prophet spoke that's the secret weapon it's not just the the confines of this this is the word of the Lord but it has to be quickened the Holy Spirit has come and the prophet declared unto us that the holy ghost is here ready to Quicken that the hidden secret weapon it's not just what you think brother it's more than what you think when does God give you this weapon after you become a Christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word brother BR goes I didn't know I was going to say that my goodness when you become a Christian you're placed behind the word of God there's your Fortress safety what a great thing that is man to be fortified behind the word that's why the prophet repeats to us over and over again and that's why the great anointed David would say the Lord is my shield and my strength of whom shall I be afraid now when we are placed behind the word the Bible tells us about four living creatures the temple guards or the throne guards Z when we are behind when we are in the word then these guards go before us being a student of this church under the teaching of our pastor brother Bernie now how many here can say that we know what the temple guards are yes sir yes sir and then brother Bernie would stand up here sometimes and he would tell us who's in the north the eagle the Prophet The Prophet evangelist who's in the East the lion the Apostle and who's in the west the ox power the thank you the pastor the burden Bearer and who's in the South the man the teacher the one that cometh with wisdom and speaketh to us these four living creatures the prophet told us whenever you see one then you know that behind one of them is the throne it's our job to be able to identify CU behind them is the throne and what's what's in the throne the very voice of God the very creative power the one that said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask ask and you shall you shall receive what you've asked for the creative power in the church right [Applause] now the first Throne was in heaven the second Throne was in Christ and the third th Throne is in man the Bible tells us that the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even unto the dividing the Thunder of the Soul and Spirit and of the joints in the marrow and is a discerner a discerner of the thoughts and intents my goodness the secret weapon placed inside the believer so that we could go out into the front line and face the wicked one in the greatest battle that was ever fought but there was requirement it was that the father was going to train these men and there would be a special group of people now this is just what I read here oh was this this that the first this is in the message Revelation chapter 4 part two preached in 1961 one of brother Bernie's favorite themes talking about the three Thrones and the Tabernacle and the Wilderness now the first Throne was in heaven the Judgment seat the second Throne was in Christ the third Throne is in man now what is a man and the brother brandham reads on and he makes a statement at the end that I want to say God in his heart makes him believe things that he can't see it's it's in that subconscious where the Holy Ghost moves that's where faith lies and when the Holy Ghost comes upon that subconscious and that's where he can speak and then he can say something like this say to that fish you can have your life back isn't that right the secret weapon that he gave to his Believers to fight in this greatest battle are those slides coming out right on the screen yeah they look short here so everything that God has spoken his word received into the right channel in the right channel will materialize for whatever promise is behind it then if you if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you have God my goodness the word the secret weapon in you now does everybody have that secret weapon my goodness wow you know you know brother brandham said speaking about the adoption he said there's only going to be a few of my then you have God's word in you you have God's life in you and you have God in you and whatever God's word speaks forth of you it don't have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God now here there's the condition there whatever God's word speaks when he says speak it that's where a lot of people make the mistake because they don't understand that we're subjective to him but the bride realizes that she knows that she can't move without him unless he says that's why the prophet said she has thus sayith the Lord and she knows what to do with it she knows that it's not not her it's him it's the word it's that quickening power it's that creative power moving in that word seed now would you like to see his commanding officers how many knew that he had commanding officers commanding officers in this Army let's see what brother Bram says I think that's that's uh the one I just read okay so this was taken from the message taking on the whole armor of God Santa Maria California Sant Maria California in 1962 now remember what I told you how he preached the greatest battle ever fought wisdom versus Faith the conflict between God and Satan and then he preached these messages of putting on the hor Armor of God see we have to follow the prophet because sometimes he didn't say everything he wanted to say in one message and just like any other preacher that text follows him wherever he goes until he gets it all out of him in his army he presents his army in the form of five offices brother brandom in another quote which I didn't want to read at this time because it would take too much time he says that's his dress wear that those five offices are his dress wear in other words that's what he puts on when he wants to when he wants to speak so he presents his army in the form of the five offices now brother brandom teaches us a lot about an office the offices are different than the gifts that are in the body the offices have been predestinated from begin before the foundation of the world and that nobody puts those offices in in action only the father it's the father who puts them in action no man can put another man in this office he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets and teachers pastors and evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers what a great thing that is I think my goodness today when we don't believe in those type of things you know the people in the message don't believe in in in in in rank you know there's there's the doctrine that goes around and saying that we're all the same my goodness that's interesting isn't it you know there there's a thought that comes when you speak about the godhead that that thought came back all the way 2,000 years ago and it's this when we talk about the revelation of Jesus Christ and how that that that that it that he is one like that scripture that we read in first John and when you run into somebody who has that Doctrine in them they'll say this they say oh brother nobody can understand the godhead not even the theologians can understand that's one of those thoughts that came from the pit the pits of hell that's not true at all but that that thought has traveled from all over through the generations it's went from one to the other and every time you hear that remember that you're hearing the very thoughts of the pits of hell because the prophet of God in this age he said it very simply he said brother all you have to do get on your knees and ask the father to reveal it and it's the same thing with that doctrine that I said there is a rank in the ministry there's an order sure all the children are the same but there's an order with which the word comes forth and he said there's no higher order than that there's no higher order than bringing the word that's the highest order there is and the highest form in the fivefold ministry is the Apostle and then the prophet and then the teachers and then the Evangelist and the pastor that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting waiting out there waiting to meet the enemy with the word of God and each one backing one another up see that's the that Ministry each one backing each other up not trying to shoot down one that's how you know when you see one trying to shoot down another that's how you know that's not God's Army the prophet of God said that they all stand behind the word the father that the father goes out in the Forefront the chief Captain not out there in the front up here above behind them but in them inside of them that secret weapon thundering out his word that creative power that faith that Holy Ghost quickening the word that the father sent forth and the Holy Spirit coming behind it quickening it don't you realize that's how the church was established the Apostle Peter stood out on the day of Pentecost he said men anden the same Jesus that you have crucified is the same one who sent this go this Holy Ghost and the Bible tells us using this principle that has been restored back to us in this day while Peter yet spake these words while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost came in and he quickened the words that principle is in effect right now same yesterday today and forever if it's not that way what are we doing there that's his army vindicating vindicating what his resurrection the proofs my goodness wow am I'm going to stop right now but I just I wanted to I wanted to focus in this morning on that secret word that weapon that God has placed inside of the believer the message tells us plainly that it was the word that Elijah was going to restore it was the coming of that word back to the believer not just a Doctrine not just a hard copy of a printed sermon but it was going to be the word The Living Word the quickening power is that right stand to your feet please if you would like to Bow your heads I would like to ask you a question where while we're in this presence while we're in this atmosphere how many would like to have that secret weapon you know inside the depths of your heart that that you do not have that you are not at that level at this current time there's not a lot of time left things are going to happen quickly brother brandham said the Lord could could could make that happen at any minute don't look for big things to happen with your eyes closed please this is a solemn time brother brandham tells us when the word comes back to you and you receive that spirit that you should have received in the first place that's what we're talking about brother when we were back with him somewhere else and we were cognizant that we were going to come down here in this battlefield to fight these Supernatural Devils but the father reassured us that there would be a time when the word would come back to us and that we would recognize it that we would take it into the depths of our heart we have to strive to reach that that's what the message of the hour is the restoration of the faith that was once delivered to the Saints do you understand what that is now I had a very hard time bringing this this week the enemy really tormented me because he knew I was going to speak about this and it was I believe it was the desire of the Lord Amen to come and to speak about the hidden secret message the weapon that many people have not been able to to grasp what the message is telling us what has been put into our hands it's the word of the Lord the father himself coming into us and fighting this battle but we won't let him we won't let the word come to us because we're too busy we let so many things take it out of us the father has emptied out his thoughts the Mysteries brother brandom tells us the Mysteries that were hidden they were hidden from all time has been revealed to us have been spoken to us by a humble man in plain English in simple words he told us what was hidden the the the thing that the the father wanted to achieve he wanted to have a family a special designation of himself a new creation the Bible tells us that he stood stood up in this last day that he stood on the earth and he he proclaimed himself the beginner or the the the the beginning of the creation of God and the Bible tells us that he spoke a word and that he created his own bride he spoke the word for her to come into existence in this age and the Holy Ghost has come and he's quickened that word hallelujah if you've never had that that experience brother brandham tells us that is the mystery of the Holy Ghost coming without sensation I'm not talking about your birth I'm not talking about a great experience of sanctification I'm talking when when the prophet said when the word would come again when that word would come to you to the person and would make himself personalized hallelujah amen if you've never realized that [Music] before thank you Lord make that your goal make that your desire that you won't rest day or night until that becomes a [Music] reality let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord what a great message you have left in our hands [Music] in Heavenly places the believer is where the Prophet told us that the master Whispers secrets to her what a place Lord I wish my wish is that everyone here today would be able to truly understand that Lord they would understand the realities of the message what the prophet messenger has delivered into our hands we weren't the prophet of whom the word of the Lord came [Music] to but we were those with the predestinated good ground where that word seed was going to drop amen and the Holy Ghost would come and he would Quicken that word we thank you Lord we thank you for your word for the the ministry Lord thank you for them Lord without them we would not be here without someone to lay the foundation to build up the structures the pillars we would not be here Lord we pray that likewise for the generation that is to come that we would be like that we thank you once again Lord I pray that you would hear the Cry of my brethren it's not by power not by might but by my spirit said the Lord thank you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hallu amen we're going to be having the prayers for the elders or [Music] yes if there's somebody here [Music] that desires or that needs healing of the [Music] body I believe when the word Goes Forth that everything we have need of is in that word you know you know the prophet said that that God created a faith in Abraham I believe he could do the same thing for us this [Music] morning [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] brother brandom talked about a quiet [Music] Faith it's just something that you know you have you can't explain it you can't do anything to receive it it's just there let's pray Heavenly [Music] Father we come before you at this time lord knowing that you hear us Lord because you promised that you would brother brandom taught us that the word cannot fail that whatever was written in that word that you watch over it to bring it to pass Lord and we're coming at this time because your scripture says if there be any sick among you if there be any sick among you in the in the body of Christ call upon the elders and they shall lay their hands on them and they shall be healed there be any sins they shall be forgiven that's not our word Lord that's your word we're just lining up with what you said by the best of our understanding the elders are have put the oil on the ones who have come come forward let it be so Lord let it be according to your word may it be when they go home that there come something upon them that gives them a peace and that they realize that their faith has healed them amen we pray it be so father and for this petition that I have here for Elizabeth I pray that it be so Lord
