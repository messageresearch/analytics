TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you this morning let's pray to god may so that he can help us divine father we are this morning once again asking you to help us lord that your word be our food and nourishment may it be it that inspires us lord and that which we have may you be sufficient enough lord so that you can give us that what we need this morning through your word in the name of the lord jesus christ amen let's open up our bibles to leverkus 25 25. in the old testament it's the book after exodus we're we're still in the message of adoption and this is number 29 the word of god reads if thy brother be wax and poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which is brother sold amen you may be seated brothers this morning i greet each and every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ we're going to begin with this message number 29 in the series of adoption i trust that god will help me to get to the part where i desire to uh get to and being that uh we're in the thought that we are gods and a man completely and totally surrendered to god is omnipotent we know that it's the blood of jesus christ that returns us once again to god to make us sons and daughters of god and being in this it falls are locked that part which we are in this morning which is redemption in reality it's been days that i've been meditating this in which i want to get to and i don't know how far i can get to this but i also want to stop and hold back and stop from saying them but just to give you enough so that your mind is opened up and you can be led by god through the word and through the message and may you be able to capture and obtain understand what i'm trying to say without doing it openly or being so obvious i want to say that i'm going to begin to read in the message of the prophet then i'm going to go to the scripture and as i'm reading and speaking i want that you have in your mind that we are gods minor gods that uh what takes us back to our original place is the ransom that jesus christ came to pay for as he died on calvary's cross through the sacrifice that he did shedding his blood therefore that is what makes us apt or eligible to be able to go back and return to that original condition and in that i believe that god has given us a tremendous light through the messenger of this age which is william mary and branham but at the same time there's some things there that uh that many of those that follow this message it's disturbed or disrupted them and being that there has been a disruption it's it's it's it follows my law and it's convenient and as god guides me to it to try to help you a little bit and that is uh on the question in which is always uh asked and the question is has the lord already come has the lord already come has mercy finished is there still mercy and you know there's people that say there's no longer any mercy and as time goes by there's more people that are adding themselves to this group that believes that i believe that in our minds this question might also come are is there still mercy so that if there's this question so much in the minds of the believers there has to be a why i believe the bible the message we have the answer of the why this question keeps coming up do you remember when i repeat when i preached about three or four years ago when mercy has finished we proved it clearly but lately uh that wave still comes and surges and that question surges in the minds of the people is there still mercy and you see that there's more groups and more people are adding themselves to that side that believe that there is no more mercy the other day the brothers from california came out angelo brothers and one from canada and they told me that there was no longer any mercy that if their mercy had finished on the last day of 1977 and it didn't please them very well because uh i had to cut them very hard when they come out of the word of god and they can't prove it i can't help but to cut that right there see and on occasions they misunderstand me and uh but i'm it's not my intention to hurt the brother but i do desire to cut any error that surges or comes up against the word i'm going to begin to read in the book of the seals you can write it down and then you can read it later in your home in spanish it's page 70 and in english it's page 87 the the word of god reads like this adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he lost it he had sinned and he'd separated himself from god and was on this side of the chasm so he could not redeem it he just couldn't do it because uh he was he needed redemption himself so he could not do it but the law required a kinsmen redeemer the law of god required a kinsmen redeemer if you want to mark that down kinsman redeemer find it leviticus 25. we don't have time thoroughly to search this because you know each text would take a night see but god's law received a substitute now what if god had not offered to take a substitute you see in english it's substitute in other words the bible says that the wages of sin is death so then as there is death each one of us are condemned having sent each one of us were condemned to death and the only reason why we don't die it's because the law of god requires death or a substitute and the law required a substitute and that is our kinsmen redeemer he took our place so that we could take his and have life the bibles and the prophet says but love constrained him to do it that man was without a way back and there's no way for him to get back he was gone but the grace of god met this kinsman redeemer in the person of jesus christ law required it and grace met its requirements oh amazing grace how sweet to sound now notice it says very simple words but the lay required it you see there's no way to escape from this when when you ask for something and you say please that's one thing but when it's demanded you have to meet the requirement the law requires it but the grace is the one that fulfilled the requirement of that demand the law required it but it was grace that met its requirements he continues reading god's law required an innocent substitute and who was innocent every man had been born sexual after sex every one and the only one that wasn't had forfeited the rights to eternal life and to be king on the earth oh when i think of that scripture and then he goes into revelation chapter five but notice there was only one man which had not been born through sex you know any minister that studies the bible knows that this is the truth the only man that had not been born through sex was adam he was created by god but all of these other men were born through sex and a man in that condition could not fulfill the requirements of redemption i want you to notice this is a teaching from the bible and it is also the teaching that william branham brought amen brothers i want that to set down inside your hearts really well therefore the blood or the sacrifice that jesus christ shed was not a blood that was transmitted on behalf of a man who had been born through sex but it was this the very own blood of god that he created which was shed and poured out on calvary because it couldn't have been it could not have been a the blood of a man born through sex which could redeem us it had to be god's very own blood which brought to the earth without sex amen is that correct don't get lost this is easy this is the easy part of the word this morning very well i'm going to read page 83 in spanish and in english it's page 103 of the seals remember if someone has the look um if someone has the book ernie don't leave if someone still has the book there on page 87 where we read there it takes you to revelation chapter 5. all right so this is where where i want you to notice therefore i go i pass 13 pages and i begin to read of what he's saying in revelation chapter 5. notice how beautiful the prophet connects this or places it page 83 on the seals in spanish and in english 103 and it brother branham says this and notice he was not an animal he's speaking of the lamb you see because the people think when they hear the lamb they think it's an animal but the prophet clearly tells us here notice he was not an animal because he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne see let me ask you a question how many of you believe that this lamb is the lord jesus christ how many of you believe that the lamb came and took the book how many of you believe that he did this in the 20th century are you sure brothers very well now so here's where the key is at entering quickly in why the people get confused notice now it's so easy to understand these things look once again and notice he was not a animal because he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne see who was the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand now we already went through that in the last two three messages who had the book in his right hand the prophet says when adam sinned the earth passed to the hands of satan but the title deed to the earth and to eternal life could not go to satan's hands because they were dirty but they returned it went back to its original owner god himself very well now notice and who is god what is god well don't get confused brothers this is where many people uh they don't like us too much and and we've spent so much time through this and let me read open up your bibles to saint john chapter four saint john chapter four let's see what it says there for god is flesh and they that worship him is worship him in flesh and spirit is that right no god is a spirit very well therefore if i understand the word and what the prophet is speaking the title deed return to god the spirit amen brothers because he is the original owner very well i'll continue reading let's see did i already lose you or are you still with me that's why that's where the revelation is at is it's in deity notice now closely i'll continue reading in the seals page 83. i know i'm going to be repeating a lot but but i want you to make sure that you understand this now notice he was not a animal because he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne see therefore if i understand how can this one come to take the book out of this one that is seated down so there's one that's sitting on the throne and then another person comes and takes the book out of the hand of him which is sitting on the throne are you following me now i'm going to go back who's sitting on the throne can someone answer who's sitting on the throne god who god the spirit no brother no let me go back again and i i i'm barely in the abc's i've i have about 20 messages on this subject of that we are god's brother elgin read saint john 4 24 once again read it from the back there so to see if the people can uh wake up don't reason don't reason believe just what the bible says read it brother king in in a loud voice john 4 24 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth very well therefore god is a spirit the prophet says that the title deed returned to the hands of god almighty please don't tell me that it returned to the hands of jesus christ it returned to the hands of god almighty because god is a spirit very well i'll continue reading i'm going to read once again page 83 in english it's page 103 and 102 and he says and notice he was not a animal because he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne you see now brother jimmy who was sitting on the throne god the spirit thank you brother jimmy the prophet says who was the original holder of the book of life who is the original owner that had the book of life in his hand god because god being a spirit he made him in his image and and to that spiritual son is the one that he gave control of all things and he gave him the book or the title deed for that property and when man sinned then the title returned once again back to its original loner we were not the original owners the original owner is god the father the almighty very well and no angel no angelic being nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture the act that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it for and took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne what is it therefore in order to be able to take the books the book i want to stay kind of quiet and slow so that no one can misunderstand this book no one could take it not even brother wesley or brother luther neither could uh any minister could take it no matter how good of a person he was neither could isaiah jeremiah or malachi take it neither we william branham there was no man that could take this book there was only one person who could go to where god was at with the book in his right hand and take the book from the right hand of god and that is the lamb jesus christ who was born without sex to be the substitute now notice now now it belongs to the lamb the book now belongs to the lamb now it belongs to the lamb very well now here he's we're reading in the breach i want you to remember that he's speaking in the breach before he preached the first seal after william branham made contact with the seven angels on mount sunset says it reads now it belongs to the lamb so then this book belongs to the lamb amen he's the one that holds it who has the book who holds the book according to the prophet the lamb amen brothers i'm reading it notice and your reasoning let me go to the message the revelation of jesus christ you see brothers it's it's not difficult brothers to understand the message that the prophet brought us it's difficult to get the people to accept just the way that the prophet brought it in the book uh the revelation of jesus christ word for word by brought by the prophet i'm reading it from the book in english page 347 paragraph 93 and then i skipped there to page 348 and if i get out of the scripture brothers please i want that you when i finish the message in any message that i'm preaching i want you if i get out of the scripture i want you to speak to me because i do not want to be in error do you think i want to be an error because if i fail or make mistakes then i take you to the slaughter but i trust in what william branham is speaking is thus saith the lord therefore he gives me the scripture even though he doesn't quote it but he gives it to me so when he gives it to me but since i more or less know where the scriptures i go search for the scripture and there i dovetail it or tie it in with what he's saying and being that brother branham and the scripture says the same thing then i can't take the interpretation of no one else but i take what's written and what my prophet has spoken in this 20th century now notice this is a paragraph 93 page 347 it reads like this now he ascended on high is that right i'm going to give you the scripture brother branham is is quoting here and then there's a period he says he ascended on high the scripture says in ephesians 4 8 he ascended on high is that right and he led captivity captive and who now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lowest parts of the earth now how many of you want to be sons of god how many of you want to be ascended on high you first have to descend to the lowest parts of the earth he that shall humble himself shall be exalted in his humiliation his judgment was taken away therefore he ascended on high but before he ascended on high he descended to the lowest parts of the earth very well the prophet says and as steven or stephen said i see heavens opened and jesus sitting at the right hand of god what a tremendous thing the prophet says that stephen he saw the heavens opened and he saw that god was there he must have been sitting on his throne and god was sitting on his throne and then he saw that one was at his right hand and the one that he saw was jesus that's what brother branham says now let's see if that's what the bible says before we continue any further in the book of acts chapter 7 verse 55 book of acts 7 verse 55 and 56 he's speaking luke is speaking here or writing the events when stephen was preaching he said but he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god where was jesus according to the scriptures when stephen saw him this is now after his resurrection after jesus ascended and then stephen is looking and seeing he says i saw him at the right hand can you say amen brothers no i can see that you say oh brother garcia you're bringing two you know remember god is in morphe he changes his masks do you believe that when moses spoke it was god speaking when isaiah was speaking would it have been god speaking well well well then which one of them is god we already read and told you that god is a spirit i'll continue reading what the prophet says now let's go see what the right hand means the prophet said right hand that does not mean that god has got a great big right hand and him sitting on it but right hand means the right hand of power and authority that's why jesus after he took that perfect sacrifice before god he came back to his disciples and he said all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth and below the earth is that right all power therefore if there was some other one there that thought that he was the one he had to subject himself to jesus now he's saying here so that you can understand this tremendous drama because god is one but he takes different masks to be able to reveal different acts or different things so i'll continue reading that body that god created now i'm going to ask you a question do you believe that the god that said let there be light and there was light who created the heavens and the earth do you believe that that god first of all created for himself a body no it can't be because god he is the one that is the self-existing one therefore when he's speaking about this one about this body that god created it is the body in which god lived here on earth two thousand years ago because the body called jesus is only the tabernacle in which god came to step foot on earth because the bible says what house will you build me there's no place there's no large enough place to keep to sustain god that's why the the bible says where shall i go whether shall i flee if i ascend up into heaven where can i hide where you will not find me if i go up into heaven now right there if i go to the uttermost parts of the sea there you are so you see he occupies all space at all time he's omnipotent he's tremendous he's the self-existing one but when he begins to speak of this body that god created he's speaking of this body called jesus now follow me he reads like this that body that god created then he says then brother brahm says i'll not i will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell because his soul went to hell amen brothers but his body he says he says i'll not allow his body to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell but raised him up and set him in the stead of the spirit on the altar but raised him up and set him in the stead of the spirit on the altar watch when they see him sitting on the altar and had the book in his hand and no man on earth or beneath the earth or anywhere was able or worthy to even look at the book but a lamb that as it had been slain from the foundation of the world way back at the beginning when he first thought of this redeemed body come and took it out of the right hand of him that sets upon the throne and set down himself amen there you are that's the scriptures it's just beautiful i'm going to bring it down to uh just an easier speech what the prophet is saying here is that here's god sitting on his throne but then the time comes in which the lamb being that he was the one who paid the price you see because when you buy something the guy who pays for it claims it so then the time came when the lamb went to the spirit that was sitting on the throne and he takes the book and then brother brahm says he the lamb himself sits down on the throne so the time comes when the lamb is will sit it sat on his throne and i'm not i don't want to go into that subject of the throne but i i'm going to give you a key first of all brother braham says the first throne was in heaven the second throne was in jesus christ and the third place that the throne is at is in man so then therefore the time comes when the lamb unveils the the role of of a kinsmen redeemer he goes to him who's sitting on the throne and he takes the book and when he takes the book he himself sits down he sits down from where he's going to govern where he's going to reign that's the reason why the bible says above all things keep thy heart keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it out of the heart are the issues of life because that's where the lamb comes to sit he sits in the throne he sits down in the heart of man the throne of god and from there eternal life flows let me go to the scripture revelation chapter five are you still following me brothers the prophet says the prophet says he says it makes me remember this and then he begins to read in revelation but i'm going to read uh from verse one and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth now notice the bible says that this lamb had seven horns is that right brothers he also had seven eyes seven eyes and the seven eyes are the seven spirits of god is that right seven spirits of god very well therefore what did the prophet say that this the seven horns were he said that they were the seven church ages is that right he said that the seven spirits are the seven messengers is that right brothers now notice therefore this lamb has seven horns seven eyes and seven spirits now remember when i began to read i said that the prophet said this is not a animal but he's saying this he's saying this so the people can understand so i want to say that that lamb was going to be there and this great this great scene of revelation chapter 5 could not be fulfilled until this end time in this 20th century now notice this cloud this cloud that came down in mount sunset what is it that you see you see seven angels is that right and these seven angels form this cloud and there there's only one eye is that right brothers well we've gone through that already the ones that don't understand me well go back and begin with adoption from number one and on brother sam thinks that he knows it right but uh well let brother sammy go and hear that again or some other you haven't heard me brothers now notice this same cloud is the only stone it's this same cloud is the cloud that led the people of israel through the desert this same cloud is the same cloud that is called the logos that came out of god but this same cloud became man and that is what we call or name jesus christ in the beginning way back in the beginning he was the word and the word was god and the word was with god and this word was made flesh and dwelt among us and being found in the fashion is a flesh man he humbled himself he used all power he humbled himself he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also has exalted him and given him a name which is above every name so then don't get shook up when i when i tell you these things just so that you can begin to understand me here's the seven corns the seven eyes and the seven spirits therefore for you to understand it you know what this is this is the right hand of god oh brother brother garcia you missed it no sir read the bible where it says where jesus says speaking about his uh sevenfold glory of his person eyes was a flame of fire feet like unto fine brass out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword hair's as white as wool and the bible says and in his right hand he had seven stars and the bible says according to 120 or 21 of revelation that the seven stars are the seventh angels are the seven angels so here comes his right hand which means authority that is why the reason that when the cloud would settle down the people of israel would stop and camp there and the cloud would stay there a month a week without moving and there the people of israel camped because the authority so that they could move was the supreme authority which is god himself therefore we see that the authority comes down the right hand comes down verse 6 and i beheld a low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes the seven horns belonged to the lamb and this one had seven eyes now if these are my eyes don't take my eyes out please they're my eyes so these seven eyes are the eyes of the lamb and these seven eyes are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and this slam came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne therefore if he came and took the book it means that the lamb was not sitting on the throne that's the reason why people for 2000 years has mock have mocked the christians and they've martyred them they've killed them they're skeptics that say how could it how could god a wise and all-knowing and such a good god stay with his arms crossed while they slaughtered millions of christians that according to the catholic church millions of christians were killed they killed them themselves how can this be it's because he had not taken his throne the lamb had yet not taken his throne but he had to be there until the last elected one would suffer would take his cup come to the earth be manifested and be tested to the utmost but let me tell you that when the last son of god comes into perfection it will no longer be a lamb but it will be the same god executing judgment as a lion sitting on his throne let me go back to the seals brothers i already read the scripture right i have about 10 more minutes and i'll see if i can finish in in spanish 83 brothers in english i believe it's 103. he says this notice he he is not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him to set upon the throne who was this the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no angelic bee nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture an act not an angel not nothing could do it i've come to claim the rights the he had they had a right to everything that had had been lost in the fall and i've paid the price oh brother woof don't it make you feel religious not by works which we have done but by his mercy oh wait a minute now all them elders and everything else begin to throw off crowns and dignitaries begin to get on the ground no one no one could do it and he the lamb walks right up to the right hand of god and took the book out of his hand and claimed his rights saying i have died for them i am their kinsmen redeemer i am the mediator my blood was shed i have become man and i did this in order to get that church back again the one i foresaw before the foundation of the world i have purposed it i spoke that it would be there and nobody was able to take it but i went down and done it myself i am their kinsmen i become kin folks and he takes the book amen brothers is that right brother do you believe he took the book are you sure very well let's read now the last page page in spanish it's 90 and 91 and in english it's page 111. he says this he says this talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked forth you see brother brother tommy why it is that people think that there's no longer any mercy because the prophet said that the lamb came out you see brother david but now you know how the thing is here's where that transaction the change precise change begins to happen that change that we've spoken on many occasions now how many of you believe that jesus christ is god is that right brothers he's god but the answer has to be in the bible and when they slew him why did they slay him because being a man was he a man yes he was a man i don't i don't understand brother bernie was he a man or was he god it was god but he took a form of humanity or a body like unto us to be able to redeem us brother branham says talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked forth see it's this is the time when the transaction is taking place because he died as a man but he was the but he was the very own blood that he had created which was the blood of god now notice when he was born king herod said let's see uh tell me uh where was he been born so that i can go worship him but he wasn't thinking about worshiping he was thinking about going to kill him herod wanted to kill jesus but he couldn't kill him because it was written that he had to be that perfect lamb therefore when he was born the bible says for unto us a child is born is that right is it a child that's been born then this child was born and it was given unto us a son unto us a son is given so that the son could pay the price but that same son is the eternal father therefore the time comes where he begins to change from son to the eternal father and when the time comes where the last son of god that was rescued by the sun that's here on earth he raises up and he goes to take the book that's the reason why the the shout comes the the shout that says awaken because the lamb is coming to take away his subjects the day of redemption is at hand which is the resurrection of the dead how tremendous i notice he says the lamb came you see the book even in heaven is sealed it says of the mysteries but no no it's not in english spanish is the book of mysteries but it's not in english i can't read it see see the books even sealed in heaven you say is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that redemption the first thing that represented that redemption come was the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book glory do you believe that the glam took the book brothers he opened the book tore off the seals and if there's someone here who doesn't understand this we have the book of seals preached by william branham and he tore off the seals and sent it down the book he sent down the book to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are so then who did he give the book to he gave it to the seventh angel and now don't get shook up because i already read the scripture where he says that jesus was sitting at the right hand of god but then jesus also promises that unto him who overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even on my throne even as i also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne that's the reason why he sat william branham in the midst of this pillar of cloud where the right hand is at where the right hand is at where the authority is at where the third pool is at where the creative word is at that is where the power is at so that the manifestation of the sons of god can come which is a total adoption god in simplicity revealing himself to his people let us pray oh father thank you lord lord that adam he was so perfect lord but he forfeited he sold everything and when he sold it perhaps michael or gabriel wanted to descend but you didn't allow it you said i myself will descend i can't trust this to anyone else you came to man and you began to interrogate him but two thousand years ago your word was fulfilled the one that says behold a virgin shall conceive and shall give birth to a son your word fat sat your your word fitted perfectly in the womb of mary the virgin and your spirit overshadowed over that word so that that word could become that which human hands could not touch and out of that was born the only begotten son of god lord you took the burden upon your shoulders all of our sins by your stripes we have been healed you died lord even the earth shook heavens began to weep darkness upon all nature and the people said truly this is the son of god you were buried your body was there protected by that squadron of soldiers but you could not be held back by those prisons lord there you were in the lowest parts of the earth still preaching this eternal gospel lord you ascended to the parrot to paradise you threw open the doors to those that were waiting on the sacrifice on that perfect sacrifice you resurrected you presented yourself to your disciples you ascended up into glory and you sent back your holy spirit lord to dwell in us through the last 2 000 years and in this 20th century when the cup of iniquity of the amorites had is full lord they're mocking us that church drunk with the wine with the revelation of the blood of the saints that have been martyred and you as the righteous judge with your wig ready to judge humanity but then in that same scene being that there was no one there to take the book to open it or to reveal the secret so that your people could get ready you yourself presented yourself and you said i have died for them i have paid the price you then took the book lord and you gave it to the seventh angel and here i have in front of me this revelation lord i can't help it but to cry out oh redeeming grace lord it's not that we worshipped a man but we worship you for your greatness because this was already written and it had to be fulfilled there could there was no one that could hold this back because your word never fails you're perfect you're infinite you're infallible lord help us to
