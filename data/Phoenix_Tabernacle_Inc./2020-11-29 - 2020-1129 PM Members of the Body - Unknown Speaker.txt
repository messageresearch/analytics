breaking the storm are coming but it's our job as members of the body and the family to keep the fire going yes yes i didn't know you still had those moves mama oh boys you've been in the ranch too long so tell us i this reminds me of the story you told me about the vineyard good sea sea that's a good one carrot mom share it i just i used to work for the kombucha wait wait before you before you tell the story let's say a quick prayer so that the storm can quiet down yes that's good maybe god's mighty hand can reach the sound equipment in the church lord please calm those storms so we can have a nice little house service and the children of the lord said amen and just like that wow hot on to sprayer puppy that's what we always say tell us kombucha yes kombucha farm vineyard and one day this man came along he had too many grapes [Music] he said no i got life in me i've got the living life in me let me ask a question to you okay and he said have you been baptized and i thought i was a baby you know they threw [Music] i was better he said that's not correct i said what you talking about tell me so then he said you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so i said i want what you have if you didn't have any grapes so he took me to his church and he baptized me in the name of the lord jesus christ submerged in water not one toe was sticking out and then a couple of years later you married amen he was awesome easy as awesome and that's why henry's handsome too i am i yes he was i look just like him oh teensy but more important than looking like him he instills something in me so important that i'll never forget he instilled a love and an understanding of how god's channel operates here on earth because god can reach anybody him sitting on his throne in heaven he had to send his spirit miho to come and dwell in human flesh in members of though did you feel that you felt those cheeks up in your food let me tell you where it all started oh the lord jesus christ when he died and he was buried and he resurrected he told his disciples go on terry in jerusalem and the holy spirit will come and fill you with power so so they were obedient and they went and when the day of pentecost was fully come fire came down fire came and baptized baptized everybody in that room and when they were baptized they were speaking in tongues and they were dancing and being filled with the holy ghost the people looked around and said these are locos they're crazy but i understand what they're saying people from mesopotamia from this place from that place they understood what they were saying in different languages and then peter came out bold and full of the holy ghost and they asked him what can we do to receive such power and he said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness and remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen and he said this is a promise for you and unto your children and until your children's children and to as many as the lord your god shall call thank you jesus i love it oh it was so amazing and then after that guess what 3 000 souls were brought to jesus i came with you yes and peter went back there so he can baptize them because there was a lot of work to do yes a lot of work three thousand people three 000. why didn't god just send an angel why did he have to use peter good question because he needs a member of the body it's like this radio this is it's just a box but if it's tuned into the right channel and the current and the radio signals reach the box we can hear music we can hear news we can hear different things from all over the world but it there's nothing really special about the radio it's the information and the music that we want to hear and it's like me and you we're just radio we need to tune ourselves to the right station can i get it amen amen tune ourselves into the right station and then the lord can speak to his people he needs hands and feet me look let me tell you come here see this young strapping a dinosaur let's say this is felipe i love felipe not garcia but this philippe c we love felipe garcia where's my bible amiha bring me my bible my bible i'm gonna tell you the story of philip so philip was a nice little man just like you okay we're gonna go to the book of acts here we are okay and the book of acts it talks about felipe and the angel came to philip and he said philip go to the desert and you will find something there i need you to do so the angel sent philip to the desert and when he got there there was an ethiopian eunuch now i want you to understand this eunuch he was in charge of all the money of the queen of sheba's treasury and when he got there he was reading the book of isaiah in the bible and philip looked at him and said oh okay this is what the angel wanted me to do so he said hey eunick do you know what you're reading and then he said well how can i unless a man explains it to me the eunuch had more revelation than most of us he said a man needs to explain so he invited him on his chariot so he can sit with him and explain the word of god now listen listen listen it's so important he was in charge of all the money from the queen of sheba he was the treasury so it would be like the treasurer from the white house our president's treasurer in charge of all the money in fort knox in the united states of america talking to you or to you or to you and saying hey step into my helicopter and talk to me about the bible that's how amazing it was and when he talked to him the eunuch was burning in his chorus i'm sorry mijito that i scare you and he said look look i need to be baptized and felipe said well if you believe with all your heart i believe he said there's water right there baptize me and so felipe took him into the water and in the name of who the lord jesus christ he baptized them and he was filled with the holy ghost why did god have descendants why didn't god send an angel to the eunuch to translate for him oh why why did the angel not go to the eunuch why did the angel go to felipe because god needs a member of the body he has to use hands and feet human lips flesh and bones mija oh that's how he works very good job my life what's the next story that we were talking about i think cornelius i love this one he was a roman soldier almost as handsy as you're apparent almost as handsome as europa i said almost he was a good man this roman soldier was a good man and he would pray to the lord and he would give offering to the poor and they loved him so much because he had a good heart and he would pray to the lord and one day in a vision the angel of the lord appeared to this gentile and the angel told him cornelius the lord has heard your prayers and the lord has seen all the arms and the offerings and the things you donate to the poor people you are a good man and all those things have built up a monument a memorial in heaven before the throne of god that means every good deed you do michael is building up a memorial in heaven even when it hurts even when you don't want to give it but if you give it with a pure heart you're building up a memorial before the throne of god so that god can remember you and remember you and remember you and you and you and he told them god will answer your prayer but you have to go look for peter he's going to be in such and such a house in such a such a town with such and such a man next to the ocean go find him and he'll tell you what to do why didn't the angel just tell him himself yes i was asking myself he had a vision of the angel why didn't god tell him how to get the holy ghost in his vision because god member of the body and when the two soldiers went to get peter peter came back to the casa of cornelius and when they were in the house of cornelius cornelius brought his nana and his tata and his theo and his friends and his cousins and his uncles and his neighbors and the people that were in the army anybody he can fit in his house and when peter got there he said pedro i've been waiting a long time anything that you say we're gonna believe that it's god's message to us amen amen what faith with faith he'd never met the man but the angel told him to go find him and god needs a member of the body so peter preached to him opened up his lips and the holy ghost came down and baptized everyone they were all filled with the holy ghost these gentiles filled with that fire so peter said well if they receive the holy ghost like me and you i guess we can't deny them our to get baptized so they baptize them in water why because that's god's provided way acts 2 repent and be baptized in the name of jesus and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost hey man you're getting it you're getting it oh my god it's so simple where's my peter mija you have a family here filled with the holy ghost that loves you if you want to have that experience with the lord all you have to sing is lord my heart you come inside feel upon my [Music] is the windows every day [Applause] [Music] i [Music] lord my heart is [Music] inside [Music] [Music] every day [Music] one more time [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] my [Music] [Music] every day [Music] [Music] he can come inside and change your life because he's the high priest of our confession you'll confess it and it's yours but an angel couldn't come and reveal that to you god had to use a man god had to use a woman god had to use a body willing to be used by the holy spirit because it's just an angel but what if it wasn't just an angel what if it was jesus christ himself in a spirit form he sent his holy spirit but let me give you this there was a man named saul of tarsus oh my favorite and he was attacking all the cristianos and he had a paper that said he was allowed to put them in jail and to imprison them and to kill them he did not like the christians and he was doing everything he can to put them away and one day he was going to the road to damascus and on that road to damascus nana what happens next okay that's a good one he was on the road to damascus and the pillar of fire jesus christ himself he came and took him off of his high horse and he said soul of thor's saul why do you persecute me and saul said i said jesus christ who are you lord and he said my name is jesus who you persecute and he said oh lord what do you want me to do lord and the light was so bright that it blinded his eyes and he could not see and the lord said go to this role down the road called straight and my servant ananias is going to lay his hands on you and you'll receive your sight and you'll get the holy ghost you'll be baptized in my name and you'll receive your commission but my question is this when he was there in the room all by himself i wonder if he knew god's plan when ananias walked in the room ananias laid his hands on him and he received the holy ghost and his eyes were open and he could see again and then he got baptized and i wonder when he got baptized and he was under the water praising the lord being filled with the spirit if he knew that he was going to be the apostle paul who was going to write the scripture that we have today see god needed a man but why didn't jesus on the road to damascus open his eyes give him the commission and fill him with the holy ghost because he needs a member of the do you body it yes not even jesus who's able to open up his eyes of course he could he's god almighty but he didn't even when jesus was raising lazarus from the dead he had the power of resurrection but he said maria marta move the stone we all have a part to play it's not like he could have just exploded the stone and rose lazarus from the dead we all have a part to play because even yes don't say no you're not just a little kid even you mama yes sir we all are part of that body oh can i get a amen okay no no i got a question come up come up come over here i got a question for you i want to know who was paying attention let's put this right there are you ready for your question [Music] okay who is paying attention to a fire right now i will pay attention puppy let's see if you pay attention can somebody tell me why did the angel have to tell philip to talk to the eunuch who was studying the word and when he came and explained then the same holy spirit brought a baptism somebody tell me what breaking cornelius was told in a vision to go look for peter for a message from the lord why didn't god just respond with an [Music] [Music] [Music] surely we're the vessels where [Music] jesus the pillar of fire completely delivers all of tarsus on the road instead he told him to go where a man was gonna lay his hands on him somebody tell me how cow a life-changing message to the people of the world without your hands and your feet how can god speak unless he's got a mouthpiece the life is [Music] surely we're the vessels where the power [Music] [Music] the life is in a temple made of flesh [Music] [Music] we are peters we're those corneliuses that need members of the body where are those people we are those people we are vessels willing to be used by the holy spirit oh if god would come down how could he come down but through you but through you but through you but through me god wants his power to be known to the world but he needs willingness [Music] quickened by the holy ghost oh surely surely would you please stand as a member of the body and i believe i believe [Music] only through a member of the body life is in the temple made of flesh and glows quickened by the holy ghost and i believe i believe we are the members of the body surely we're the vessels where the power of love [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] he's mighty and powerful greater than any god i will forever remember all the wonders will forever remember all the wonders [Music]

mustache and the play in this costume god is real god is alive god is moving today through flesh and bones speaking through human lips and if you can hear the sound of my voice and you're tired of
