[59:43] Jes in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:46] Christ amen you may take your
[59:49] seats I've learned that there's three
[59:51] kinds we we all know this and and if I'm
[59:54] and if it's a
[59:55] I I I love children's
[59:58] [Music]
[1:00:02] church and and if it's if it goes over
[1:00:05] your head a little
[1:00:06] bit I'm I'm really
[1:00:10] sorry we're trying to be
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:13] obedient um but I I believe that even in
[1:00:17] your
[1:00:18] age if the Holy Spirit can reveal to
[1:00:21] reveal to
[1:00:23] you just
[1:00:25] something that it's been a blessing for
[1:00:27] us all
[1:00:29] right I I learned in in a
[1:00:34] church even and if you just type it to
[1:00:41] yourself uh there's three kinds of
[1:00:45] Believers we know that
[1:00:47] right there's a a
[1:00:50] Believer make
[1:00:52] believer and you got your non-believer
[1:00:56] well um and um I had a
[1:00:59] question is it
[1:01:02] possible that you can be all three of
[1:01:04] them all at
[1:01:07] once well it happened to
[1:01:10] me where I was living at in that and I
[1:01:14] was living
[1:01:16] that about six years
[1:01:19] ago um I had just gone out of
[1:01:23] jail
[1:01:25] and uh and I was on fire I had made a
[1:01:28] decision in my
[1:01:30] life that I was going to serve God with
[1:01:33] all I that I
[1:01:35] could I made a
[1:01:38] promise and um and so I I I had this
[1:01:42] promise in my
[1:01:44] heart and I knew that I couldn't go back
[1:01:47] on
[1:01:49] it and then one day after a youth
[1:01:53] service
[1:01:55] I went and I asked a
[1:01:58] brother and I said brother do you think
[1:02:00] I have the new
[1:02:05] birth and he says well what do you
[1:02:08] think I said well I I think I
[1:02:13] do I I I feel that I yeah I think I
[1:02:18] do I just want to tell you
[1:02:21] something if you got to ask somebody
[1:02:26] if you if you got something like
[1:02:29] that wake wake up to what to what's
[1:02:32] really
[1:02:34] happening you know when you
[1:02:37] know you'll
[1:02:39] know there's no doubt there's no you
[1:02:43] have to ask
[1:02:45] somebody you don't going to have to ask
[1:02:47] your mama or your
[1:02:49] daddy you don't have to go ask your
[1:02:51] pastor you don't you don't have to ask
[1:02:54] nobody
[1:02:56] you just
[1:02:57] know so then I I left that
[1:03:00] day I was like man well I got it
[1:03:03] man I got the new birth
[1:03:06] that's I knew I had it so I
[1:03:10] left five years went
[1:03:13] by and uh I started to
[1:03:18] notice like all these mistakes that I
[1:03:20] would
[1:03:23] make you you know uh in an intellectual
[1:03:27] birth when you when you have a birth
[1:03:30] that's
[1:03:32] intellectual you you live
[1:03:37] foolishly in contrast to a real
[1:03:42] birth you you you do nothing but think
[1:03:44] with your own
[1:03:48] head in your own
[1:03:50] ways you know what I know the word says
[1:03:53] this
[1:03:56] but I just can't overcome
[1:03:58] it it's just it's hard for me in my life
[1:04:02] right
[1:04:03] now when you have the new
[1:04:06] birth I don't care what you're going
[1:04:09] through and you get tired of just some
[1:04:12] you get tired of something you're
[1:04:13] struggling
[1:04:15] with you just say that's
[1:04:18] enough that's it you know when I make a
[1:04:21] mistake
[1:04:23] now and I and it comes to my
[1:04:27] attention I feel I feel really bad and
[1:04:31] sometimes my wife corrects
[1:04:33] me or a brother will correct
[1:04:36] me I said oh my God I didn't mean to do
[1:04:40] that I didn't mean to say
[1:04:42] that and
[1:04:44] before I would just
[1:04:47] say well that's just where I'm at right
[1:04:50] now you know and then the mistake would
[1:04:53] happen again
[1:04:55] and then it would happen later
[1:04:57] on so here I had like these these you
[1:05:01] know my my own way of of of living a a a
[1:05:05] new birth type of
[1:05:09] life you know you have your own
[1:05:13] gifts you have your own
[1:05:16] confidence everything on your
[1:05:20] own and although you confess with your
[1:05:23] mouth
[1:05:24] you say well I'm
[1:05:27] this I got the new
[1:05:29] birth because I I felt
[1:05:32] it your
[1:05:35] actions your fruits show what you really
[1:05:40] are and I and it was so
[1:05:44] confusing because here I
[1:05:46] was I believed I believe that I had the
[1:05:50] new
[1:05:52] birth but here I was uh
[1:05:54] make
[1:06:01] believing because if you believe the
[1:06:04] word then you live the
[1:06:07] word see you you you believe
[1:06:12] it or you unbelieve
[1:06:15] it so here I
[1:06:17] was really it was it was a
[1:06:22] confusion so then I come to the
[1:06:24] altar you know as the years would go
[1:06:27] by or I'd be in the back or I'd be at
[1:06:31] home or I'd be at work and I and it
[1:06:35] would be
[1:06:36] like why am I doing
[1:06:39] this or why did I do that or why did I
[1:06:43] say
[1:06:46] that if I really believed
[1:06:49] it see it was just it was just
[1:06:53] intellectual you know um I believe I was
[1:06:56] maybe this
[1:07:00] close I was this close to have received
[1:07:03] a new
[1:07:04] birth those five years
[1:07:07] back but what I should have
[1:07:10] done instead of asking
[1:07:13] somebody I should have just I should
[1:07:15] have got all that doubt
[1:07:18] out I should have came to the
[1:07:20] altar I should have went to the
[1:07:22] word I should have went to the message
[1:07:26] and I should just start digging and
[1:07:27] digging and
[1:07:34] digging you know when you have a genuine
[1:07:36] real
[1:07:39] birth you don't have to ask somebody if
[1:07:41] you got
[1:07:42] it the holy spirit will prove it through
[1:07:47] you the Life of
[1:07:50] Christ through you the way you
[1:07:54] walk the way you talk the way you act
[1:07:58] like a
[1:08:03] Christian you're you're you're living
[1:08:05] like a
[1:08:06] Christian and I never really I never
[1:08:08] really took the
[1:08:10] time to analyze my
[1:08:13] life and to
[1:08:15] say okay today I did
[1:08:18] this and I did this all right next
[1:08:22] day I did this man I did it again man
[1:08:28] okay and then the next day I did this
[1:08:31] and I did this last
[1:08:34] week I never took the time to
[1:08:39] analyze you know you can make yourself
[1:08:43] believe you can make yourself
[1:08:46] believe that you got
[1:08:48] something and you don't got
[1:08:52] it you can say you
[1:08:55] believe but you don't
[1:08:58] believe but here I was I was a
[1:09:01] Believer I come up a nice song
[1:09:06] leader I give my
[1:09:08] testimony you know on the mission
[1:09:11] field let me be honest with
[1:09:13] you I would do with all my
[1:09:16] heart I I really
[1:09:18] would it wasn't a
[1:09:22] fake I I want you think that oh man this
[1:09:24] guy was just a
[1:09:26] hypocrite that's the last thing I wanted
[1:09:28] to
[1:09:29] do but the word will separate that the
[1:09:34] word
[1:09:35] separates it'll separate a make
[1:09:39] Believer from a real believer it'll
[1:09:42] separate a
[1:09:45] non-believer from a real
[1:09:52] believer
[1:09:54] now I learned this from our our I
[1:09:56] learned this from my
[1:09:59] Apostle my
[1:10:01] pastor and I I say it because I I take
[1:10:04] it
[1:10:06] personal and we all have to do the same
[1:10:09] thing that in in in the class of
[1:10:13] Believers we have two different we have
[1:10:16] two different
[1:10:19] sections let's see on this side we have
[1:10:23] the foolish
[1:10:25] virgins and on that side we have the
[1:10:28] wise
[1:10:31] virgins they're both
[1:10:33] believers they both believe in the
[1:10:37] message both believe in Malachi
[1:10:41] 45 they they believe in the
[1:10:44] word but there's just just just that
[1:10:47] little
[1:10:48] something that just that one
[1:10:51] word that is separate
[1:10:57] or it can just be not having enough oil
[1:11:01] in your
[1:11:05] lamp oh you know what maybe
[1:11:10] tomorrow I'll give it all to
[1:11:12] Jesus maybe next
[1:11:15] week I don't I don't feel I can do it
[1:11:18] right
[1:11:19] now I made so many
[1:11:22] mistakes I I I I know I have these
[1:11:26] problems I know I'm
[1:11:29] weak I just I can't do
[1:11:33] it maybe maybe I'll go to the
[1:11:37] Altar and it doesn't have to be this
[1:11:40] altar right right here this
[1:11:43] Altar and I'll just give it all up I'll
[1:11:47] just give it to the Lord Jesus
[1:11:49] Christ you
[1:11:51] know the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:55] now he he broke me
[1:11:57] down know he took
[1:11:59] away anything that I had as a
[1:12:04] man I mean he he tried to take away my
[1:12:09] health you know if I don't take
[1:12:12] medicine and that's God's way of healing
[1:12:16] okay for people who say oh man that's
[1:12:19] against my
[1:12:22] belief
[1:12:24] medicine is here for a
[1:12:26] reason God works through
[1:12:30] medicine medicine doesn't heal God
[1:12:34] heals but so you know here here I was
[1:12:38] that that I I had had no
[1:12:41] Health you know my spirit was
[1:12:45] broken I was spiritually
[1:12:49] sick I mean I mean just to the point
[1:12:51] where I didn't want to just I don't want
[1:12:53] to go to church no
[1:12:56] more and and to top it
[1:12:59] off when I used to feel like
[1:13:02] that at least I had a
[1:13:06] mind I had
[1:13:08] confidence that I was still a
[1:13:10] man that I I'll be all
[1:13:12] right I still had this you know I'm
[1:13:18] Benji I'm still going to make it
[1:13:21] tomorrow and then one day
[1:13:24] God
[1:13:26] said okay I'm going to take your mind
[1:13:30] now I'm GNA crush
[1:13:34] it I'm gonna I'm gonna burst it I'm GNA

[1:13:40] was I had no confidence in
[1:13:43] myself let me tell you when you don't
[1:13:45] have no confidence in
[1:13:47] yourself have you never been there and
[1:13:51] you never have to be there
[1:13:55] that's great you know but God will take
[1:13:58] you to the
[1:13:59] place where he needs to take you to do
[1:14:03] what he has to do for with
[1:14:08] you see if he wants to use you in such a
[1:14:12] way the full
[1:14:15] capacity he'll break you down to where
[1:14:18] you say I don't got nothing no
[1:14:21] more I I don't got a physical
[1:14:24] health man I don't got spiritual
[1:14:29] strength I don't even got a mind a

[1:14:46] barber shop I don't trust
[1:14:50] them everybody's talking about me
[1:14:54] you start going
[1:14:56] crazy and God allowed this God allowed
[1:15:01] this he allowed
[1:15:03] this he allowed for me to get to this
[1:15:07] point where I had nothing
[1:15:11] more and I said
[1:15:15] Lord I mean what what do you do this
[1:15:18] for why do you break me down like
[1:15:21] this he said
[1:15:23] is are you

[1:15:38] trying nothing left in
[1:15:40] me he
[1:15:42] smiles he smiled at me back
[1:15:46] there I remember the
[1:15:48] service he smiled at
[1:15:50] me he said that's where I want you
[1:15:56] that's where I want you I want to put my
[1:15:59] Holy Spirit in
[1:16:01] you so I make you
[1:16:04] walk the way I want you to
[1:16:07] walk I want you to talk the way I want
[1:16:10] you to
[1:16:11] talk you see your mind that you
[1:16:14] have I don't want your stinking
[1:16:17] mind I want my mind in
[1:16:22] you where I was
[1:16:24] at broken down I had nothing to
[1:16:31] offer then God
[1:16:33] said with a beautiful
[1:16:36] smile that's where I want
[1:16:38] you you
[1:16:40] see when you don't cut off those things
[1:16:42] of the
[1:16:44] world those little
[1:16:46] habits all you're doing is allowing for
[1:16:49] a bad
[1:16:52] burn we're talking about a lamp
[1:16:55] right now in a lamp you have a wick
[1:17:01] inside okay and and when this when when
[1:17:04] when the lamp go when you turn it
[1:17:06] off there there's this carbon that's
[1:17:12] created and if you don't trim
[1:17:14] it if you don't trim it the next time
[1:17:16] you light
[1:17:19] it it's it it burns gets all smoky
[1:17:24] this gets all Smokey and all
[1:17:26] black and it and it stinks and it gets
[1:17:29] all over your
[1:17:33] face it's you got to trim your
[1:17:39] lamps now that now we're just barely
[1:17:41] getting to the
[1:17:43] point to becoming one of a
[1:17:48] Believer I barely came to that point
[1:17:50] where I'm a
[1:17:52] Believer
[1:17:53] now and being a
[1:17:55] Believer you I mean we talked about it
[1:17:58] last week probably because of the
[1:18:02] camp and I went through
[1:18:05] it I had a horrible time last
[1:18:10] week
[1:18:12] horrible I mean it was all going on in
[1:18:16] here he started manifesting in
[1:18:18] here right on last
[1:18:21] Sunday I didn't want to come to
[1:18:25] church and and
[1:18:27] somehow by the grace of
[1:18:30] God just something
[1:18:33] snapped just said just go so I went and
[1:18:37] I sat right there and brother Mona
[1:18:39] preached a wonderful
[1:18:42] message and what I realized was that I
[1:18:46] needed a
[1:18:49] refilling you know when when when your
[1:18:51] lamp when the oil runs
[1:18:55] out you it might be full in one
[1:18:59] point it could be full at one
[1:19:01] point and you can burn it all night
[1:19:06] long and and then it possibly go the
[1:19:08] next
[1:19:10] day but when it goes
[1:19:13] out you got to put more oil in
[1:19:17] there if if it runs out of
[1:19:19] oil you got to put more oil in there
[1:19:23] and how do you do
[1:19:25] that I don't know God knows how to do it
[1:19:30] though God he's a he's a lamp
[1:19:35] filler he he can fill up your
[1:19:41] Reservoir he can fill up your
[1:19:44] vessel we can get to that
[1:19:47] point where you finally become a
[1:19:51] Believer you know and by the the grace
[1:19:53] of
[1:19:54] God working your way up by the grace of
[1:19:58] God grace growing in
[1:20:01] you and then and then you can just get
[1:20:03] to that
[1:20:04] point and you're walking around
[1:20:09] defeated what's going on I don't feel
[1:20:12] like going to church
[1:20:14] today well you need a refilling
[1:20:17] brother you need a refilling

[1:26:33] were lacking in the
[1:26:35] spirit man shall not live by by by the
[1:26:39] by The man shall live not live by bread
[1:26:46] alone but by every word that comes out

[1:26:52] man should not live by just the
[1:26:56] Bible I'm substituting words there
[1:26:59] okay but by every
[1:27:02] word man should not just live by the
[1:27:07] message but by every

[1:31:41] but but you're never going to believe
[1:31:42] this she asked me to make her a wedding
[1:31:46] dress oh I know so I went shopping nice
[1:31:51] isn't it beautiful very pretty oh my
[1:31:54] goodness look at this and I I bought so
[1:31:56] much fabric babe you're not going to
[1:31:57] believe oh that's gorgeous I am going to
[1:31:59] believe it God works in mysterious ways
[1:32:02] I was just reading about the remnant and
[1:32:04] the bride and and and the dress and how
[1:32:07] the bride uh gets herself ready well I'm
[1:32:09] going to have a hard job I mean I have
[1:32:11] to cut out the pattern lay it to the
[1:32:13] fabric but I don't know which parts of
[1:32:15] the fabric to choose I mean it oh it's
[1:32:17] so beautiful how do I pick which parts
[1:32:20] to use well it's simple you just use the
[1:32:22] pattern and and you cut it out I mean
[1:32:24] you're not going to use all of it even
[1:32:25] though it's beautiful like but you don't
[1:32:27] have to throw it away I'm sure it could
[1:32:28] be used for something else but it
[1:32:29] doesn't belong in the dress but it's
[1:32:32] just as good as the fabric that's going
[1:32:34] to be part of the dress babe of course
[1:32:37] like we got to read this scripture
[1:32:38] together it'll explain everything see
[1:32:41] the material is just as good because
[1:32:44] it's the exact same material see you you
[1:32:47] can't just say one part of the material
[1:32:49] is better than the other cuz they look
[1:32:50] exactly the same the difference is Babe
[1:32:55] predestination chose to use certain
[1:32:58] parts of this material for the dress and
[1:33:01] the other parts the the other REM The
[1:33:03] Remnant they're just as good but they're
[1:33:06] not part of the dress babe so you mean I
[1:33:09] just have to cut yeah you're dra dra
[1:33:12] line just going to have to make little
[1:33:13] like cup holders or something with the
[1:33:15] rest of the fabric it's still good
[1:33:17] fabric right it is okay so let me get
[1:33:20] this yeah I was just reading and then
[1:33:21] the lord gave me this song and it's
[1:33:23] still a work in progress but it's just
[1:33:26] about that it's about making yourself
[1:33:28] ready well this is what I chose to make
[1:33:30] the dress wow you're the fastest seams
[1:33:33] dress I've ever seen in my life you are
[1:33:37] hired man no wonder she called you for a
[1:33:39] last minute

[1:33:46] reading questions and answers in Genesis
[1:33:50] okay listen to what brother Bram has to
[1:34:02] say cut out it's yours you lay the
[1:34:06] pattern it's God's business where he
[1:34:07] leavs the pattern he cuts you right out
[1:34:10] is that right and then all this rest of
[1:34:12] this Calico leure is just as good a
[1:34:14] Calico as in the dress is that right but
[1:34:18] it's God's election God elect his church
[1:34:21] God PR destinat his church God for or
