[1:10:23] first first verse and go down to verse
[1:10:28] 9 oh Lord Oh Lord our Lord how excellent
[1:10:33] is thy name in all the Earth who has set
[1:10:37] thy Glory above the heavens
[1:10:46] oh of the mouth of babes and sucklings
[1:10:49] hast thou ordained strength because of
[1:10:51] thine enemies that thou mightest steal
[1:10:54] the enemy and the
[1:11:06] Avenger when I consider thy Heavens the
[1:11:08] work of thy fingers the moon and the
[1:11:11] stars which thou Hast
[1:11:19] ordained what is man that thou art
[1:11:21] mindful of him and the son of man that
[1:11:24] thou visitest
[1:11:33] him for thou Hast made him a little
[1:11:35] lower than the angels and H has crowned
[1:11:38] him with Glory and
[1:11:45] Honor thou mest him to have dominion
[1:11:48] over the works of thy hands and thou
[1:11:50] Hast put all things under his feet
[1:11:58] all sheep and ox and yay and the beasts
[1:12:01] of the
[1:12:05] field the fowl of the air and the fish
[1:12:07] of the sea whatsoever passes through the
[1:12:10] paths of the
[1:12:16] seas oh Lord our Lord how excellent is
[1:12:20] thy name in all the
[1:12:22] Earth
[1:12:26] Lord Jesus we thank you for this
[1:12:30] day we ask you to be with us
[1:12:34] Lord share your spirit and your word
[1:12:37] with us
[1:12:39] father and may we walk away
[1:12:42] today with a greater
[1:12:46] understanding of who you are in our
[1:12:50] lives anchor yourself in US Lord
[1:12:55] and come into fruition
[1:12:58] father we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[1:13:03] name amen amen you may be
[1:13:08] seated it's a privilege to be here
[1:13:12] today uh today is the Father's
[1:13:16] Day uh
[1:13:19] 2017 and I thought uh it would be great
[1:13:23] to wish you all a Happy Father's
[1:13:28] Day to all the
[1:13:30] fathers but then also to all of
[1:13:34] you because as a father we have a a
[1:13:36] better time when everybody around us is
[1:13:38] having a good
[1:13:43] time I know some people say well I'm not
[1:13:45] a
[1:13:47] father that doesn't mean you can't have
[1:13:49] a happy Father's
[1:13:52] Day just because you're not a
[1:13:54] father Happy Father's Day to
[1:13:58] everyone and uh especially to the
[1:14:01] fathers and especially to my daddy who's
[1:14:04] home watching
[1:14:06] us happy Father's Day Dad and Happy
[1:14:10] Father's Day
[1:14:11] Mom amen amen uh God bless you
[1:14:16] all we're going to speak a little bit I
[1:14:18] think uh I wanted to talk a little bit
[1:14:20] about the first Father's
[1:14:22] Day
[1:14:26] and uh as a subtitle from the scripture
[1:14:29] we' read who is
[1:14:35] man you know the scripture says in in in
[1:14:38] four two it's two
[1:14:43] questions one of them is what is
[1:14:47] man and I'm going to take it as the
[1:14:49] angle of of who is
[1:14:52] man what is man that you're mindful of
[1:14:57] him and to me it's who is
[1:15:00] man who is man that you would pay
[1:15:03] attention to
[1:15:05] him that you remember
[1:15:09] him and the second
[1:15:12] question and who is the son of
[1:15:15] man that you visit
[1:15:18] him and brother brandham says that there
[1:15:21] can't be a a a of a a son that was
[1:15:27] eternal because a a a son has to have a
[1:15:32] beginning he has to have a
[1:15:35] father and he explains to us that MDC
[1:15:38] had neither father nor
[1:15:41] mother and he explains to us how mesc is
[1:15:44] Jesus
[1:15:46] Christ it had no father had no
[1:15:49] mother because he had no
[1:15:52] beginning he's
[1:15:54] Eternal which means without beginning
[1:15:56] without
[1:15:58] end and there is no
[1:16:01] father without a
[1:16:03] son because it is the act of having a
[1:16:06] son that turns you into a
[1:16:10] father which is why when I shake the
[1:16:12] young man's hand and I say Happy
[1:16:14] Father's
[1:16:16] Day I either get the embarrassed look of
[1:16:19] I'm a
[1:16:21] father or the shock look how do you
[1:16:25] know depending on their situation in
[1:16:29] life but you become a
[1:16:33] father when you have a
[1:16:36] son on June the
[1:16:38] 15th
[1:16:41] 1986 on Father's
[1:16:44] Day I became a
[1:16:46] father my son came just in
[1:16:50] time he was born on Father's Day
[1:16:54] and it was my first Father's Day I could
[1:16:55] celebrate as a
[1:16:59] father and I think about our heavenly
[1:17:04] father how it is that our heavenly
[1:17:07] father became a
[1:17:09] father and we begin to
[1:17:13] consider the
[1:17:15] heavens The Works of your of the
[1:17:21] fingers the Moon
[1:17:24] and the
[1:17:25] Stars which God has
[1:17:27] ordained and we got to ask ourselves who
[1:17:30] is this
[1:17:32] man that God would be mindful
[1:17:37] of in the message questions and answers
[1:17:39] on
[1:17:42] Genesis I don't have a lot of time to go
[1:17:44] into
[1:17:46] depth I think I'm on about message
[1:17:48] number six in the series I'm I'm
[1:17:52] taking
[1:17:55] but we're going to cover a little bit of
[1:17:56] these two
[1:18:00] men well
[1:18:03] man and the son of
[1:18:05] man why who is man that you're mindful
[1:18:10] of and who is the son of man that you
[1:18:15] visit in questions and answers on
[1:18:19] Genesis they ask brother
[1:18:21] brandham God created male and
[1:18:25] female created male and
[1:18:28] female that's the first
[1:18:31] point now in Genesis 2:7 it says he
[1:18:36] formed but first he
[1:18:40] created he formed Man Out of the
[1:18:45] Dust and breathed into his
[1:18:50] nostrils uh what is the difference
[1:18:55] or where is the
[1:18:57] connection in the above
[1:19:00] scriptures now but we I've got it wrote
[1:19:04] it
[1:19:05] down Genesis 1:
[1:19:09] 26-28 and Genesis
[1:19:12] 227 I'm sorry I'm still reading from
[1:19:15] from
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:20] brother now in this Genesis 1:26 God
[1:19:23] made man in his own
[1:19:28] image and now let's read it together for
[1:19:30] you to to check me
[1:19:34] up and God said let us make man in our
[1:19:40] image after our
[1:19:42] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:19:45] the fish of the
[1:19:47] sea over the fowls of the
[1:19:50] earth over the cattle of the Earth
[1:19:53] and over every creeping thing that
[1:19:54] creeps upon the
[1:19:57] Earth let us make man in our
[1:20:00] image and let them have
[1:20:04] dominion okay so God created man in his
[1:20:07] own
[1:20:08] image in the image of God created he
[1:20:13] him male and female created he
[1:20:18] them again we have a created he him
[1:20:23] male and female created he
[1:20:29] them now Genesis
[1:20:32] 2:7 watch what he did
[1:20:35] here and God formed Man Out of the Dust
[1:20:37] of the
[1:20:40] ground and breathe into his nostrils the
[1:20:43] breath of
[1:20:45] life and Man became a living
[1:20:50] Soul now what kind of for
[1:20:55] the questioner wants to
[1:21:00] ask what
[1:21:02] connection does this Genesis
[1:21:06] 126 have with Genesis
[1:21:10] 27 God created two
[1:21:16] men and which was the
[1:21:19] man what connection do they have
[1:21:23] how does it connect up in the
[1:21:27] scripture now if you notice in Genesis
[1:21:32] 126 let's get the first part
[1:21:36] first God said let
[1:21:38] us now let
[1:21:41] us us is
[1:21:44] a that's what he says is a let us make
[1:21:48] man in our own
[1:21:50] image of course
[1:21:53] we realize he is talking to
[1:21:58] someone he was speaking to another
[1:22:03] being let us make man in our own
[1:22:07] image after our
[1:22:11] likeness and let
[1:22:13] them not he let
[1:22:16] them have dominion over the cast cattles
[1:22:20] of the
[1:22:21] field
[1:22:23] if you notice in
[1:22:26] creation the first thing that was
[1:22:28] created of
[1:22:31] course was
[1:22:33] light you come on down through the
[1:22:36] creation the lasting created was
[1:22:40] what a man and woman was made after
[1:22:46] man the last thing that was created of
[1:22:49] God's
[1:22:51] creation
[1:22:53] of God's
[1:22:56] creation is
[1:22:58] mankind but when God made his first
[1:23:02] man if you
[1:23:04] noticed he made him in the likeness of
[1:23:08] himself he was made in the image of
[1:23:11] God and what is
[1:23:16] God that's why I'm asking that's what
[1:23:19] the psalmist is
[1:23:21] asking
[1:23:23] what is
[1:23:24] man now brother bam is asking what is
[1:23:30] God what is
[1:23:33] man what is God I want to know who is
[1:23:37] God and who is
[1:23:43] man now in St John chapter
[1:23:46] 4 Jesus speaking he says whosoever
[1:23:50] drinks of this water
[1:23:53] I shall give unto him shall never
[1:23:57] thirst and he will be Wells of water
[1:24:00] springing up into everlasting
[1:24:03] life the woman said unto him sir give me
[1:24:05] this
[1:24:09] water Jesus said go and call your
[1:24:12] husband the woman
[1:24:15] answered now I believe I believe we have
[1:24:17] to get a little bit above that
[1:24:19] now to find out what I want you to see
[1:24:24] okay oh here it is the 23rd and 24th
[1:24:28] verse so he's in in four 23 and
[1:24:33] 24 you worship and you know not
[1:24:39] what we know what we
[1:24:42] worship for salvation is of the
[1:24:45] Jews but the hour
[1:24:47] cometh and now is that the true
[1:24:51] worshipper
[1:24:53] shall worship the father in the spirit
[1:24:55] and in
[1:24:57] truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:25:00] worship
[1:25:02] him now the next verse is where I
[1:25:05] want God is a
[1:25:08] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:25:10] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:25:14] truth now if God created man in his own
[1:25:19] image and in his own likeness what kind
[1:25:23] of man did he
[1:25:25] create a spirit
[1:25:28] man after he had made all the
[1:25:33] creation and created a spirit
[1:25:37] man the close reading of this
[1:25:40] now to the one that asked the question
[1:25:42] will find
[1:25:44] this that God give dominion of the
[1:25:47] cattle and the fishes and everything to
[1:25:49] the
[1:25:51] man
[1:25:54] but in his making up
[1:25:57] there he made man in his own
[1:26:01] image to lead the
[1:26:04] cattles to lead the beasts of the
[1:26:08] field just like the Holy
[1:26:12] Spirit leads the believer
[1:26:18] today okay so I'm just going to say it
[1:26:21] out there
[1:26:23] and you can find it
[1:26:24] here they they they talk about the
[1:26:26] Trinity of
[1:26:31] god father Son and Holy Ghost and they
[1:26:34] think that they are three separate
[1:26:39] people and yet one
[1:26:41] God brother Bram says how mixed up can
[1:26:44] you
[1:26:45] get if you have a different
[1:26:48] person or a different
[1:26:51] personality you have a different
[1:26:54] person makes three that's
[1:26:58] paganism it's one
[1:27:00] person the same person in three
[1:27:04] different
[1:27:05] offices God is the
[1:27:08] father God has the
[1:27:10] son and God has the Holy
[1:27:12] Ghost we know God is the Father's
[1:27:15] Creator
[1:27:17] God and Son of God is Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ and holy
[1:27:22] spirit is Christ in
[1:27:25] man but when you break it right
[1:27:29] down it's God the Father Elohim Creator
[1:27:34] God Jesus Christ the logus of God and
[1:27:39] man the holy spirit of
[1:27:45] God yes we are part of the Trinity of
[1:27:51] God
[1:27:57] let's go back 100 million
[1:28:00] years before there ever was a
[1:28:06] star moon or anything in the
[1:28:09] world there was a time when there wasn't
[1:28:12] nothing
[1:28:14] here it was just all forever and
[1:28:19] Eternity now we stand here on the edge
[1:28:21] of this
[1:28:24] banister and we look
[1:28:27] over and we see these things
[1:28:31] happening now no man has seen the father
[1:28:33] at any
[1:28:36] time no man can see God in the bodily
[1:28:40] form because God is not in body
[1:28:44] form God is a
[1:28:47] spirit no man has seen the
[1:28:49] father but the only begotten of the
[1:28:52] father has declared
[1:28:57] him now notice there just
[1:29:00] space there's no light there's no dark
[1:29:04] there's nothing it just seems
[1:29:07] nothing but there is a great
[1:29:10] supernatural
[1:29:12] being Jehovah God who covered all space
[1:29:17] and all
[1:29:19] places and he was from Everlasting from
[1:29:25] Everlasting he is the
[1:29:27] beginning of of
[1:29:29] creation that's
[1:29:32] God can't see nothing can't hear nothing
[1:29:36] not a move of an adom in the
[1:29:39] air not nothing no
[1:29:41] air no nothing but yet God was
[1:29:47] there that was God no man had seen that
[1:29:52] that's the father that's God the father
[1:29:56] now notice after a while begin to see a
[1:30:00] little sacred light begin to
[1:30:03] form like a little Halo or
[1:30:06] something you could only see it by
[1:30:08] spiritual
[1:30:09] eyes to look now while we're looking the
[1:30:14] whole church now we're all standing on
[1:30:17] this
[1:30:19] banister looking at what God's doing
[1:30:23] and and by this we'll get down to this
[1:30:25] question
[1:30:26] here and you'll see how he brings it
[1:30:30] in no one has seen God and now the next
[1:30:34] thing we begin to
[1:30:36] see by by eyes of Supernatural
[1:30:40] looking we see a little
[1:30:42] light forming out there what is that
[1:30:47] that is called by the Bible readers the
[1:30:50] logos or the anointing or the
[1:30:54] anointing it's the part of
[1:30:57] God began to
[1:31:00] develop into
[1:31:02] something so human
[1:31:04] beings could have some type of an idea
[1:31:07] of who he
[1:31:13] was that was the word of
[1:31:17] God God
[1:31:19] himself gives birth
[1:31:23] to his
[1:31:26] son which was before there was even an
[1:31:31] Adam or air to make
[1:31:35] an and the first Father's Day came into
[1:31:40] existence Elohim El gives birth to the
[1:31:44] logos there's the logos hi papy Pap hi
[1:31:49] son I'm a Daddy now
[1:31:55] and then the God begins to
[1:31:59] create but he doesn't
[1:32:03] create he's God the Father the
[1:32:06] Creator and yet brother brandom explains
[1:32:09] to
[1:32:10] us that God the Father the
[1:32:13] Creator the creator of Heaven and
[1:32:16] Earth doesn't do any
[1:32:20] creating it's the Lord
[1:32:23] playing
[1:32:25] around Play
[1:32:28] Time imagine if he was
[1:32:31] serious he's just playing
[1:32:34] around and he says let there be
[1:32:38] light
[1:32:40] Hallelujah and the first
[1:32:42] atom burst into
[1:32:46] existence and the sun begins to
[1:32:50] form
[1:32:52] then this
[1:32:54] logos the one that we say God the
[1:32:56] creator of Heaven and
[1:32:59] Earth father
[1:33:01] Creator but now we see that really the
[1:33:04] father the
[1:33:06] Creator all he
[1:33:08] created was the
[1:33:11] logos giving birth to
[1:33:15] himself into a a form that we can begin
[1:33:19] to understand
[1:33:22] what he is and then he hands
[1:33:26] off and now the
[1:33:29] logos which is God the
[1:33:32] Father embodied in that Halo of
[1:33:37] light begins to
[1:33:39] create the heavens and the
[1:33:45] Earth then he says he creates everything
[1:33:49] brother Braham takes us through the
[1:33:50] creation
[1:33:52] how the explosion
[1:33:54] went basically what the scientists call
[1:33:56] The Big
[1:33:58] Bang How the Universe began to expand
[1:34:02] out how millions and millions and
[1:34:04] millions of years passed
[1:34:07] by and when the time was
[1:34:10] right how that the logus went
[1:34:13] out and got the Earth and began to bring
[1:34:17] it
[1:34:18] back that's when the contraction of the
[1:34:20] universe
[1:34:24] and he got it close to the Sun so he
[1:34:26] could melt
[1:34:29] it because it was a ball of
[1:34:33] ice and when that melted
[1:34:37] enough that the Earth was covered with
[1:34:41] water now we're Burly in Genesis
[1:34:45] 1 where it says the Earth was without
[1:34:48] form and
[1:34:50] void and and the power of
[1:34:52] God the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:34:56] face of the deep of the
[1:34:59] water two Creations had already taken
[1:35:03] place God creating the
[1:35:05] lust first creation and the logos
[1:35:09] creating the
[1:35:10] universe second creation and then God
[1:35:14] begins another
[1:35:16] creation which is chronical in Genesis
[1:35:20] 1
[1:35:23] what we all refer to is the creation of
[1:35:24] the Earth in seven
[1:35:29] days the third
[1:35:35] creation then he
[1:35:37] says everything
[1:35:39] created and he says you know what
[1:35:43] son or it could have been
[1:35:45] dad dad let us make man in our own
[1:35:50] image
[1:35:52] son let us make man in our own
[1:36:01] image let's just go real
[1:36:04] quick to the
[1:36:07] resurrection of
[1:36:10] Lazarus
[1:36:14] 1951 June the
[1:36:17] 29th back in the
[1:36:19] days before brother B got fiercely
[1:36:22] scolded by the
[1:36:27] angel that he was still tried to explain
[1:36:30] these spiritual
[1:36:33] things that the Pentecostal people could
[1:36:35] never
[1:36:38] understand then after he got all his
[1:36:40] creation
[1:36:43] made he said let us plural make man in
[1:36:49] our plural
[1:36:52] own image now if God is
[1:36:56] unseen and if the logus was in the form
[1:36:59] just mythically
[1:37:03] speaking speaking like a drama in the
[1:37:06] form of a
[1:37:07] Halo then it's
[1:37:10] supernatural and he had to make a man in
[1:37:12] his own
[1:37:14] image John 4 says that God is a
[1:37:18] spirit he had to make a spirit man
[1:37:23] and he brought it down
[1:37:28] now there's a deity that cannot be
[1:37:33] seen deity is the
[1:37:37] Supernatural and he brings it
[1:37:40] down from a sacred
[1:37:43] Halo so there's the deity that cannot be
[1:37:47] seen then you bring it down to the
[1:37:49] sacred Halo
[1:37:52] that can be
[1:37:54] seen but not with these eyes only with
[1:37:57] the supernatural
[1:37:59] eyes then he brings it down from a
[1:38:03] sacred
[1:38:04] Halo to a little white
[1:38:08] cloud something that's more
[1:38:12] visible that's
[1:38:20] man
[1:38:23] and he gave him rulership over the
[1:38:26] kingdom and he governed the
[1:38:29] Beast like the Holy
[1:38:32] Spirit leads the church
[1:38:35] today for there was no man to till the
[1:38:38] SE
[1:38:41] soil then he put
[1:38:44] man in the image of
[1:38:46] man on earth created him out of the Dust
[1:38:50] of the Earth
[1:38:54] that's the second
[1:38:55] man but the first
[1:38:58] man was the Holy
[1:39:00] Spirit and he led a
[1:39:04] beast just the way the Holy Spirit does
[1:39:07] today leading the
[1:39:10] church going back to
[1:39:12] Genesis turn
[1:39:16] Genesis and I'm going to stop right
[1:39:20] here
[1:39:22] what is the
[1:39:23] difference or where is the connection in
[1:39:26] the above
[1:39:28] scripture what connection does the first
[1:39:31] man have with the second
[1:39:47] man the first
[1:39:49] man is is the second
[1:39:52] man made
[1:39:55] manifest in five
[1:39:59] senses God bless
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:15] you oh
[1:40:17] goodness I take back this is as
[1:40:23] bad bless
[1:40:28] you isn't God

[1:41:13] it and and we see

[1:41:30] adoption I changed it sorry
[1:41:33] okay and brother Bram says
[1:41:37] this when did he choose
[1:41:41] us when did God choose
[1:41:44] you that's got the Holy
[1:41:47] Ghost no we all want to know that
[1:41:52] when did he choose
[1:41:55] you before the foundation of the
[1:42:00] world he chose
[1:42:02] you and sent
[1:42:05] Jesus that he might be the
[1:42:09] propitiation of your
[1:42:11] sins to call
[1:42:13] you to
[1:42:17] reconciliation to
[1:42:19] himself let me read that
[1:42:22] again he chose
[1:42:24] you and sent
[1:42:27] Jesus that he might be the
[1:42:32] propitiation of your
[1:42:35] sins to call you to
[1:42:40] reconciliation to
[1:42:42] himself to
[1:42:46] love oh wish we had just a few more
[1:42:50] minutes
[1:42:54] he said let me before we go any further
[1:42:56] go
[1:42:58] back Genesis
[1:43:01] 126 he says when God made
[1:43:04] man before he made
[1:43:08] man he called
[1:43:11] himself l e
[1:43:14] l l l e l h
[1:43:18] l Elohim Elohim
[1:43:21] now that's where they get the name
[1:43:23] Elizabeth
[1:43:25] from that's why El
[1:43:29] L I'll leave
[1:43:31] that okay so
[1:43:34] L Elohim that word the word means in
[1:43:38] Hebrew the
[1:43:41] self-existence all by
[1:43:43] himself nothing existed before
[1:43:47] him he was all the existence there ever
[1:43:52] was self-existent
[1:43:56] one Ella Elohim means the all
[1:44:02] sufficient the all
[1:44:04] powerful
[1:44:07] Almighty self-existing
[1:44:09] one oh but in Genesis
[1:44:13] 2 when he made
[1:44:15] man he said I
[1:44:17] am y a Hu
[1:44:21] j u
[1:44:23] Vu
[1:44:25] yah
[1:44:27] Jehovah what did it
[1:44:29] mean I am the all existent
[1:44:32] one who has
[1:44:35] created something off of me off of
[1:44:41] myself to be a son of
[1:44:45] mine or a
[1:44:47] temporary or an amateur
[1:44:51] little one of
[1:44:56] mine now he start off where when did he
[1:44:59] choose
[1:45:02] you oh Glory says so Jehovah
[1:45:07] means that he gave
[1:45:10] man to be an amateur
[1:45:13] God because he is Father
[1:45:16] God and he made a
[1:45:19] man and amateur
[1:45:22] God so he
[1:45:25] isn't self-existence
[1:45:29] anymore oh this is Brother BR
[1:45:32] talking Jehovah
[1:45:35] means gave
[1:45:38] man to be an amateur
[1:45:42] God because he is Father
[1:45:45] God and he made a
[1:45:48] man an amateur God
[1:45:51] so he isn't self-existent
[1:45:56] anymore he
[1:45:58] exists with his
[1:46:01] family amen
[1:46:04] amen eloh
[1:46:07] El now he is
[1:46:10] Jehovah Jehovah
[1:46:13] meaning the
[1:46:15] one who
[1:46:17] exists with his family oh praise
[1:46:23] God now God made
[1:46:25] man to pre pre to be predominant over
[1:46:29] all the
[1:46:31] Earth he had
[1:46:33] dominion and the Earth was man's
[1:46:37] Dominion is that
[1:46:39] scripture then if that's his
[1:46:42] domain he was got over the
[1:46:45] Earth he could speak and it would be so
[1:46:49] he could speak speak this and it would
[1:46:52] be so oh there he is god Jehovah the one
[1:46:57] who once existed in
[1:47:02] self-existence but
[1:47:03] now exist with his
[1:47:06] family and his little
[1:47:09] ones with him there you
[1:47:13] are

[1:47:56] Jesus to be the
[1:47:59] pration for our
[1:48:05] sins so he had to bring to he had to
[1:48:09] restore

[1:48:30] this because all he's trying to
[1:48:33] do what he is trying to do at this
[1:48:38] time is to bring back the
[1:48:41] bride to be as he was once or as she was
[1:48:45] once before the
[1:48:48] fall to bring us back

[1:51:47] message and messenger
[1:51:50] of the last days that's not to bring
[1:51:53] them to a
[1:51:56] Creed but to jerk them out of those
[1:52:00] Creeds and to bring them back to the
[1:52:03] original Fai of
[1:52:06] Father the Pentecostal
[1:52:08] father where the church is to be in the

[1:52:22] 1962 I'm I'm going to jump to paragraph
[1:52:30] 181 look
[1:52:32] here remember my message
[1:52:36] recently on the bride
[1:52:39] tree see how they took
[1:52:42] Jesus he was a
[1:52:44] tree the one that David
[1:52:48] saw a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:52:52] water his fruit in
[1:52:55] season the most perfect
[1:52:58] tree and they cut him down and hung him
[1:53:01] on a man-made Roman
[1:53:06] Tree for a
[1:53:09] mockery but what did he
[1:53:11] do rose up again the third
[1:53:14] day what else did he do he set forth a
[1:53:18] bright tree
[1:53:20] a man and a
[1:53:22] woman like the trees that was in the
[1:53:24] Garden of
[1:53:26] Eden two trees one of them the tree of
[1:53:31] life and one the tree of
[1:53:33] death and what did he do he come to
[1:53:37] redeem this
[1:53:39] tree so since he redeemed it at
[1:53:43] Calvary he's ready to plant her
[1:53:47] now oh my I got I get to feel religious
[1:53:50] when you say
[1:53:52] that to restore his bride
[1:53:57] tree the one that should have been in
[1:54:01] Eden but she fell there because she
[1:54:06] disbelieve the

[1:54:12] tree that will believe the
[1:54:15] word and when she come up on the day of
[1:54:18] Pentecost
[1:54:22] that original
[1:54:24] doctrine that original
[1:54:26] Faith then what did Rome begin to
[1:54:30] do sent a
[1:54:33] korm sent a Palmer worm and each one
[1:54:37] took his part off the
[1:54:39] fruit and the leaves and everything and
[1:54:43] suck it all down but what did the
[1:54:46] prophet he
[1:54:48] saw he said I will restore that tree

[2:06:52] hour this
[2:06:54] message because this is what's
[2:06:56] perfect because that when that which is
[2:06:59] perfect
[2:07:01] comes that which is in part shall be put

[2:07:09] manifestation of the sons of God God in
[2:07:13] human flesh the deity of Jesus Christ
[2:07:18] here on
[2:07:19] Earth through his
[2:07:23] bride to bring us
[2:07:25] back thus sayith the
[2:07:28] Lord why
[2:07:30] cry speak the
[2:07:34] word
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:38] amen
[2:07:41] now the quote was read the other day and
[2:07:43] brother brother
[2:07:45] Junior still he's always still in my
[2:07:47] thunder
[2:07:49] I love brother
[2:07:51] Junior that's that's why he
[2:07:54] said so the prophet
[2:07:56] said he said the bride has th say the
[2:08:03] Lord and she doesn't have nothing to
[2:08:06] say she keeps
[2:08:08] still she keeps crying where is the stay
[2:08:11] of the
[2:08:12] Lord in the message of the hour if you
[2:08:15] can't find it in the
[2:08:17] Bible find it in the message if you
[2:08:20] can't say thus sayeth the Lord then you
[2:08:23] better be
[2:08:24] quiet but you got to understand that
[2:08:27] when you're a child of God oh when
[2:08:30] you've come to the
[2:08:32] adoption because this is the age of the
[2:08:35] adoption where God dwells on his deity
[2:08:39] of
[2:08:40] God is in his
[2:08:42] bride oh it happens it
[2:08:46] happens where dead are raised up from
[2:08:48] the when people are raised up from the
[2:08:50] dead the sights are
[2:08:53] given oh no that's only the
[2:08:55] prophet only the prophet did that even
[2:08:58] the prophet said he said I didn't say
[2:09:02] that that was God in Me That was deity
[2:09:07] in flesh and God can use any one of
[2:09:13] you now we're not the
[2:09:16] prophet oh you understand we're not the
[2:09:20] prophet but we've been
[2:09:31] taught what good would the stones be
[2:09:35] said if you just pile them
[2:09:38] up lay them where they're
[2:09:41] at do a little bit better out
[2:09:45] there then they would pile them up
[2:09:49] together they might be needed out
[2:09:54] there oh and none of them out
[2:09:59] there and none of them out
[2:10:01] there see that's right stone is no good
[2:10:05] without a stone
[2:10:07] Mas now watch Jesus counts
[2:10:12] character not
[2:10:14] members you know that it counts
[2:10:17] characters
[2:10:19] God has always tried to get one man in
[2:10:22] his
[2:10:25] hand all he
[2:10:27] needs one man and he'll do his work
[2:10:32] through the
[2:10:34] years just think he could only find one
[2:10:38] righteous man in the time of
[2:10:41] Noah in the time of
[2:10:44] Moses only found one righteous man
[2:10:50] 197 God's looking for
[2:10:53] character not

[2:11:00] Bride of
[2:11:02] Isaac swe it out until he found
[2:11:07] character remember Abraham put him
[2:11:10] responsible as God put us

[2:46:07] brother yesterday asked asked
[2:46:10] me he he requested
[2:46:13] this I didn't really to do
[2:46:17] this but a brother asked me
[2:46:21] yesterday if I could get up here and say
[2:46:25] this and I'm going to tell you what the
[2:46:27] brother is
[2:46:30] requesting he says look brother last
[2:46:33] time you got up there in the
[2:46:35] Pulpit you said that you didn't want and
[2:46:38] then none of the mothers to
[2:46:43] cook now
[2:46:45] now it's the father's
[2:46:48] time for the father not to cook
[2:46:52] today and not to go out either out to
[2:46:57] eat and then him have to
[2:47:00] pay the mother should the mother should
[2:47:04] pay because his father's
[2:47:08] day
[2:47:10] okay this is what the brother requested
[2:47:13] of
[2:47:13] him
[2:47:15] but but then here's the
[2:47:17] problem I'm not supposed to be saying
[2:47:20] that the fathers that should they should
[2:47:23] not be cooking

[2:48:10] the
[2:48:11] shell take off the shell
[2:48:16] everything's a
[2:48:18] mess and then my wife
[2:48:21] comes she saying what are you
[2:48:24] doing you told me to put him in the
[2:48:27] water I told you to take him out of the
[2:48:32] water well I'm not a
[2:48:36] cook so I already broke
[2:48:41] that so he said don't cook and I already

[2:53:50] doesn't I am your father in The
[2:53:56] Gospel brother
[2:53:58] Bram is telling us that he is our
[2:54:02] father in The
[2:54:05] Gospel amen amen but let me let me
[2:54:08] insert something
[2:54:10] here the reason that brother
[2:54:13] Bram messenger prophet of God sent to
[2:54:16] this
[2:54:18] age the reason to be the reason he
[2:54:20] became our father in The
[2:54:24] Gospel just like when Jesus Jesus Christ
[2:54:27] came to the
[2:54:30] Earth and Jesus himself said I do
[2:54:32] nothing of my own but only that which
[2:54:34] the father shows
[2:54:37] me brother Bram did the same
[2:54:40] thing he had the same Ministry of Jesus
[2:54:43] Christ
[2:54:46] and what we
[2:54:47] believe that God sent his
[2:54:50] son Jesus Christ and in this end
[2:54:53] time it was promised that he would send
[2:54:56] the spirit of
[2:54:58] Elijah which is the Lord Jesus
[2:55:01] Christ manifested in one
[2:55:03] man named William maram
[2:55:06] brandham God set his
[2:55:09] son William Mariam Branham William Mar
[2:55:11] Bram so then he becomes Our Father the
[2:55:17] gospel but can I also add that I also
[2:55:21] believe that he sent his other
[2:55:24] son has many
[2:55:26] sons he sent his other
[2:55:29] son Garcia brother Bernie G
[2:55:33] Garcia and he only repeated he only
[2:55:36] repeated what that seventh angel
[2:55:37] messenger told
[2:55:40] us to
[2:55:42] me not only brother random is my father
[2:55:45] in The
[2:55:47] Gospel brother Bernie
[2:55:49] Garcia is me is my father in The
[2:55:56] Gospel and not only that William Bram if
[2:55:59] William brandham
[2:56:01] came and he had children as well Joseph
[2:56:04] Bram Jose Bram Billy Paul and Billy
[2:56:08] Paul being children of God's Prophet
[2:56:12] they as well they also like
[2:56:15] they are our
[2:56:17] fathers in the gospel and I'm talking
[2:56:20] about Joseph
[2:56:22] BR that's what I believe that's what I
[2:56:26] believe now you got to say what brother
[2:56:29] Bram
[2:56:31] said in his
[2:56:33] Doctrine brother Bernie said exactly
[2:56:35] what brother brandham
[2:56:39] said so if you claim to believe brother
[2:56:43] Bernie you got to say exactly what
[2:56:46] brother Bernie
[2:56:49] said because he said exactly what
[2:56:51] brother brandham
[2:56:55] said so if you're a Son of
[2:56:57] God you are also a
[2:57:00] father because the father goes in
[2:57:03] you adopted son and daughter of
[2:57:07] God not does not come by
[2:57:10] himself but he comes accompanied by the
[2:57:13] father
[2:57:15] didn't Jesus say that it's not me that
[2:57:18] does the
[2:57:19] work but my father that is in
[2:57:22] me likewise you you are my
[2:57:26] disciples if you walk in the
[2:57:29] light because we have been given the
[2:57:32] word word when it's
