========================================
e e e e e e e God bless you this evening can you please stand with me welcome to Wednesday night service be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ beh of our pastor ber Garcia are you happy to be this

your name once again Lord help us open our our hearts this evening Lord God so that we we may receive what you have for us this evening Lord God so that you may strengthen us Lord God in these dark World Lord father especially in these times we don't know why things happen Lord God but we know everything's in your control Lord father everything's according to your perfect will Lord father and that's where we want to stay Lord father not not be our own will but your will Lord father may we just continue staying with your word on that firm foundation and just stay with Jesus Christ Lord God because we just want to be reflection of you Lord God not our own light but yours Lord father Lord father we place this service in your hands this evening bless each and every one of us send your spirit Lord father and bless those are watching this via internet and be with those that are on their way Lord father we thank you Lord God we love you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen tonight we'll be listening the message Mr monster preached by Pastor Bernie G Garcia on September 5th 1982 this is a bilingual message interpreted by our brother James Garcia may the Lord richly bless you through his word God bless you may be seated e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e monster and I'm going to take this away so that each and every one of you can see what it is that God has within his word I've read two scriptures here one of them is in Mar and the other one is inis Bible says that they shall take up serp how many believe that that word is the truth he goes on to say that the serpent is very subtle in order to take up serpents we must be more do you believe that God has his within the church so it can take up and cast out serpent we see how that the Bible explains to us that the two things would be so close that if it were possible it would dece the very very elect the very elect how many of you think that you can be deceived isn't it true that we all think that we can't be deceived but let's take the mask off of Mr monster so you can see him face to face and find out what place each and every one of our one of us is in the first that I would like to bring forth is that God and the devil are very much alike how many of you knew that say Amen if you knew that there are many people that don't realize or were not aware that the devil and God look the same they look so much alike that God is in the temple and God's people turn to one side and when the people turn to one side they take God out of the temple and put the devil in there so when the people look back at the since they just finished seeing God they think it's God and they are worshiping God but actually what they're worshiping is the devil the Bible says so much that he s in the house of God as God being like unto God that's tremendous Christ and the Antichrist are alike how many knew that say Amen so we know that Christ is the anointed and we know that the anointed of the age is the messenger so the Antichrist is anyone that goes against the teaching that Christ brought and only through the word of God can we know which is Christ and which thanks be to God for his word I see then that God and the devil are alike you look at both of them and you say they're the same people know who's the devil and who is God Christ and the Antichrist are alike there are other things that are and hate look Alik that is the Mr monster off of whom I'm going to remove the mask tonight God and the devil look alike Christ and the Antichrist look alike love and hate look Alik that there is Mr monster we see that when God set man upon the Earth he set him there under the law of love because God is love but then the devil came planting something contrary to that love and what he planted was hate and it looked like it was love and that woman swalled that pill and brought forth hate which is the monster that is destroying mankind the serpent planted Discord in order to turn the woman against the [Music] man and then used the the woman then used the woman to turn man against God we see then the fruit of his labor was a man called [Music] Cain we see that the Bible teaches us that Kain became Wrath his rage prode we see that rage and hate go hand in hand and this took him to the place of killing his own brother do you see looks like love the serpent is so subtle and fills people with hate and people think that it's love now remember one thing that love build or raises up but hate destroys destructs and knocks down let's take an example uh let's take the marriage couple the Devil comes and destroys the relations of the couple with the excuse of that is uh that it's [Music] love the Devil comes with the mask of love that's Mr monster now so it makes the woman think that that man actually loves her but actually what that man has for her is hate the first thing that that man has to do to went over that married woman is to turn turn the woman against her husband is that right so that Cova hat his uh the one he's battling against he that hate is to whom she's married with he hates the married man but then he presents himself to the woman in love but he has a mask and it looks like it's love is hate if you remember some time ago on a few occasions I I mentioned it to my dad oh I've mentioned my my dad to all of you I believe that my dad was and is a tremendous man of God when I was born my father was already a minister so you can say that I was born in the womb of the church my father was a pastor he had approximately 500 members in his [Music] church and some of those members hated my dad see hate has a mask am am am am on this mask across the whole front are written the words love love love love but actually benath the mask is full of hate those people that claim to be Christians treated me in a very low manner to the point that I ran away from home you see that when those people Christian people from that church treated me wrongly then I ran away I answered what they did with rage [Music] and that rage produced hate that rage that I felt I felt it against my parents and I felt it towards the members of the church and I felt it against God [Music] I thought that I was defending myself I thought I hated my parents and that I hated the members and that I hated God but actually all that was manifested against my own self I Thought I Loved myself but actually it was a mask it was Mr monster I hated my own self from my home in that rage and hate when I left home for years for weeks and months I slept on the sidewalks I was a vagabond during this time I had a very improper diet when I was 18 years old I weighed 113 pounds because of the improper diet that I had my face was ruined my skin when I left home this red me into drugs I used different kinds of drugs one of my friends that talked and played with me they sent him to the gas chamber executed him in the state of California and do you know why they killed him because he said that he loved a woman this woman refused to dance with him because of that reason this man killed a child that belonged to the woman when this man did this actually he was killing himself he thought he loved himself but actually he hated himself for example let's take an the example of today they just arrested an official of the city he was a married man for one reason or another he divorced his wife I believe that they they've been divorced for over six years I believe he has two children his wife lives in the state of Washington he uh met and came together with another lady and he was going to to marry [Music] her but then their relationship broke off and the rage that he felt began to multiply within him and that hate that he had when he face came face to face with his hate he was facing Mr monster but the name that this sir has is love he began to defend himself and being that through that love for his own self which the name of it is he took a revolver and shot his buddy when he was shooting he was actually shooting at himself because that's the way the devil is the devil doesn't S another to kill you he comes with the mask of love and you yourself destroy the Devil and the members of the church did not mess up my face they didn't give me the [Music] drug I injected and drank the drugged myself I myself slept in the gutter and I thought I loved myself because I saw the Mas but now I can see it's Mr monster under the mask of love when that man here in Phoenix fired those bullets of that gun heing [Music] his I was as I was carrying counter I was hiding under a bush torn apart and destroyed my face was like a plague I didn't know who had destroyed my sin I thought it was the church I thought it was religion I thought it was the Hypocrites I I didn't know that it was myself that has brought that plague to my face I I weighed 113 I was as tall as I am I was going into the grave in a while they would either take me to the prison or to a gas chamber and all this time I thought I loved myself because I follow this Mr moner and until now that I realized that Mr mon was a multitude behind him people think they love themselves they hate themselves while I was there there I made a covenant with God say Lord I want to serve you I Surrender unto you I didn't surrender to a denomination to a church to a group of men I surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ afterwards I was baptized in Christian baptism I went from church to church because every church I went to I was a strange bird remember one thing that when God calls a man he lets that man go through certain situations and God permitted for me to go through all these things in my life so that in this year of 1982 I could take Mr monsters mask away and you could benefit from what God has given so that you could see this man face to face and say depart from me you demon in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because all things should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in 1963 I accepted this message truly I accepted it with all of my heart but then I began to see certain things when these things came I was filled with rage that raage come goes hand in hand with Hate It produced hate but I realized it and I began to to cry out to God Lord take me out of [Music] this I myself was digging my own grave when I turned around to the people that I saw I saw them with hate and I thought it was them that I hat I found out that it was myself I hat because God is love and where God lives the devil cannot live but love is there cannot exist but they look Alik and it has the mask and it is written that it is love when I recognized this I told the Lord I'll serve you father that's when I got here to Arizona in 1969 I promised to serve him with all of my heart I would like to say sincerely that I have been serving the Lord with all of my heart for 13 years now we are in 1982 I accepted this message 20 years ago [Music] I never believe that I would see what I'm seeing in the message today I see the world I see the world filled with [Music] hate they kill and kill and continue to kill they said that the other day a minister in San Francisco got mad because they made fun of him he took his car and ran over some people he thought he was preaching love he didn't know that the mask said love but within him was hate do you think that if the love of God is in your heart you think that hate can remain there ha cannot remain there there is room for either one or the other I never thought I'd see the hate that I see in this message in no other place have I seen such hate as in this message when I read that letter I looked at it how can this be then the Lord came down and said Bernie people don't hate you they don't hate me because the Bible tells me the message the word tells me and God told me they don't hate you they hate themselves for example they tell the young people don't smoke because smoking causes cancer and they get mad and they say what difference does it make to you whether I smoke or not and then under the mask of love that they love their own selves they take the smoke smoke and smoke they think it's love and they don't know that they hate themselves because cigarettes produces cancer until the day they die people get mad and through this madness it creates hate and in that hate they begin to make mistakes and they think they hate me they don't realize that they hate themselves for example they they stop coming to church they stop paying their ties and under the mask of love but it's a monster called hate I won't go to church I'm going to show Garcia that I won't give him I love myself I'm going to defend myself now and he's shouting out loudly let say that his name is gono he's shouting not me not you he is cursed are you cursed are you be cursed says you are cursed with a curse but since he has a mask I love myself I defend myself I protect I demand my rights realize it's mon has a mask it's called love I don't curse anyone they curse themselves now the devil is very subtle a brother gets [Music] mad he says he says I hate him he sees another and he begins to uh Gumble back bite do you know I can see your face when you're mad this the way Cain's face look is what I see in your face the majority of the Devils have gone out but when I came in that's why Jimmy was having [Music] trouble because the devil is tremendous and he I knew said I would take his mask away he filled with rage and hate that that cursed one Mis Minister that woman I hate this church you don't hate the church you hate yourself you destroy yourself because when they went out of Egypt over two million came out but only two entered in they accepted the word but over two million were murmuring and murmuring and murmuring and criticizing criticizing under the mask of Mr monster thinking that they love themselves they thought they loved themselves but they themselves were destroying that's the way people are today they themselves are destroying their own has a mask and they think they're defending themselves and that they love themselves but actually they hate their themselves the devil has deceive them someone said the devil doesn't deceive let me say that a majority have been deceived by the devil you think you love yourself but you actually hate your own self where are we going we're going to the promised land to go to the promised land we have to love because he loveth not knoweth not God but but the the devil sits in the church and it seems like it's God it looks like it's love it's hate hate the lying devil a lying monster Mr monster I've declared who you are your name is love but actually your name is hate the devil has deceived you they believe that they love themselves the devil says defend yourself protect yourself that's what the devil said what do you think that policeman was doing was his name Hernandez he was protecting himself he took the revolver he thought he was protecting himself was destroying his own self the devil can do nothing your brother the devil can do nothing to you the only way the devil can attack you is through yourself you get mad the hate comes and you begin to defend you begin to protect yourself you know that man the human being destroys himself no wonder the prophet said I shall return prach the trail of The Serpent and this morning this evening I brought part of that what is it love or hate they shall take up Serpent and the serpent was more subtle and it's put on a mask now the devil has said let such and such a person help burning you do don't help him protect yourself the devil it's Mr mon with a Mas of love and the one that's harming yourself your own self the devil doesn't say stay sitting down don't help the Tabernacle don't help here they took they took away your office defend yourself I'm going to descend and ask for my the prophet said that a lamb forfeits for right but the Devil comes like a great monster with that mask and it says love love yourself defend yourself protect yourself don't let jimy do it to you you have p do this let Jimmy help don't you help him let me repeat it to you once again he that that loveth not does not know God it's against it's the devil he has a Mas of love but his name is hate and hate does not come anyone else it comes against your own self if it were possible it would deceive the very elect if it were possible I want to reproduce this and I'm going to preach it where I can stand in different ways because the mask it's been taken off it's not called love it's called hate I find you I meet you I meet you and you don't shake hands with me you turn your face mad hate against me no against yourself because I don't destroy when I came this house you remember I thought that I was defending myself when I came to the Lord I ate 103 lb just disaster but the Lord picked me up and he healed me he embraced me I was a rare whereever I go finally I 69 in 1969 there I [Music] was I was a tremendous I saw a tremendous I saw tremendous bit and I saw that bit and I remembered when I had left home I remember when hate had done with my [Music] family and I remember that it br to the marriage of my father and mother Lord help me get out of here he said you're the only one that can get out don't make the pit any deeper get out I came out Pho I came to Phoenix I went all through Latin America I filled with love filled with love doing kind unto others One turns against me the other turns against me and the other against me until the Lord said they're not against you they are against their own s how can it be take the mask away he said Lord but the name written there is love yes he said look how they've taken God and they put the devil in his place they've taken out love put in hate they're full of hate take the mask away from the Devil the Lord for this sir is called but I've taken away his mask and the rage and hate that you have takes you into destruction when that young man which was my friend he thought he loved that lady and because she refused him he killed her child he was about to die in the gas chamber I remember how I thought much upon him I can look back to that year of 1951 and I could say this man wasn't sent by anyone else sent his own self to that gas that love that he had for he for himself that woman caus him to kill that child the same thing came that love for Cain made him kill Abel that love that you think you have for yourself turn against your brother but actually you're against your own self let us pray Mr monster I've taken away your mask this [Music] afternoon and I have set the word in the hands of them that hear me now it's as it was back then when it was on Pilot's hands these people can wash their hands but it's out of my responsibility and have declared your true name that your name isn't really [Music] love your name is ha your name is you're a monster and I come against you seeing that I declared the word now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I order you to turn loose of each and everyone and if you're here at this moment because only God can abide here and he is love he is not your name Mr monster but God's name is love for God is love let's sing a song Johnson will be [Music] each and everyone examine yourselves now I've taken the mask from Mr and and and I'm not going to destroy you you yourself will destroy yourself you yourself take away God's blessings from and and call upon the cursing because no man can curse what God has blessed neither can you bless what has been cursed even though I desire you blessing and you ask for the curse do yourself destroy but you know now that it's not love it is hate and that is his name if you're saved and you know it say amen hallelujah God bless you welcome to our evening service Wednesday spiritual food in due season did that help you certainly help me and uh helps me uh see a little bit clearer um I'm here to
