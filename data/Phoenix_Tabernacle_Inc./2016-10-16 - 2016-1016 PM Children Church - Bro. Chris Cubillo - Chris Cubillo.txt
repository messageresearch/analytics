are so thankful to have the pastor that we have and um tonight we'll continue a series of exerts from the series of books entitled Supernatural the life of William brandham we're in book two we're starting a new chapter tonight and I have to read the chapter a certain way the words are going to sound a little strange but it's called the M Town Miracle a quick thought about this chapter we're still in the year 1940 the next six years will lay the foundation for what will become in many people's opinion the greatest soldier in the charismatic Revival after 1946 brother Brandon's Ministry went International but between the years of 40 and 46 that Ministry went from local to Regional to National the next five chapters that we will cover especially chapters 28 and 29 in the future are fundamental to the establishment of brother Brennan's Ministry so I just want to let you know that we have a lot of great things to come Lord willing and tonight we'll put on display another portion of brother Le brenan's life several weeks after the healing of Mrs Na's daughter William brandham was again spending the night at his mother's house even though the hour pressed late he couldn't seem to fall asleep so he got up and paced the floor of the spare bedroom in the dark feeling a vague burden tugging at his heart he thought maybe somebody is sick somewhere and needs me to pray Bill knelt by the side of the bed and prayed for a long time without any relief looking up he noticed a patch of white in a corner near to where his mother had some laundry piled in a chair oddly enough it seemed to be glowing softly when the spot of light moved towards him Bill knew it was the angel of the Lord it looked like a small luminescent Cloud the white Mist drifted into him and suddenly he found himself walking through a shadowy Wilderness somewhere in the distance he heard the bleeding of a lamb ba ba it sounded so helpless Bill said that poor little thing I'm going to see if I can find it he moved in the direction of that pitiful noise looking behind trees and under bushes for a trembling bundle of wool as he drew closer to the source the bleeding grew louder and seemed to change in pitch and tone until it sounded Almost Human Bill stopped and listened carefully the lamb seemed to be bleeding mil Town M Town then the vision left him Bill had never heard of a place called miltown so the next night at church he asked his congregation if anyone knew of its whereabouts George Wright said I do brother brandham it's a small town about 35 Mi west of here not far from where I live I'm going to go I'm going to go there next Saturday Bill explained somebody there is in trouble and he told his congregation about the vision I'll take you there George Wright offered miltown proved to be a typical rural Indiana Community the busiest place on Saturday was the grocery store in the middle midle of town where all the farmers came to do their weekly shopping driving down the Main Street Bill thought I wonder what the Lord wants of me since nothing better suggested itself he decided he would preach on the corner by the market going into the store he bought a wooden box turned it upside down on the street corner and stepped up on top Bible in hand planning to preach to every passer by but even though he had done such street corner evangelizing a 100 times in Jeffersonville for some reason now he could not think of a subject on which to preach it soon became obvious that people were not going to stop and listen to his stumbling impromptu sermons George Wright said brother brandham I'm going up on the hill to sell some eggs to a man I know up there do you want to ride up with me might as well I'm not getting anywhere here toward the top of the hill they passed a big white church Bill commented isn't that a lovely building yes George replied you know it's a Pity about that place it used to be a Baptist Church but the last Pastor there got into trouble the congregation all left and went to other churches in town and the city has taken over the building brother George why don't you stop the car and let me out here I feel something pulling me towards that church okay brother Bill I'll pick you up on my way back after the car drove away Bill climbed the steps and tried the door it was locked he sat down on on the front steps folded his hands bowed his head and prayed Lord if you want me in this church please unlock these doors for me soon a man came walking over and said hello I saw you sitting here and I wondered if I could be of some help well I'm a preacher Bill explained and I was interested in seeing this church but it's locked the man said I've got to keep thank you Lord Bill whispered The Stranger unlocked the front doors and let him through a small foyer into a large Sanctuary that could seat nearly 400 people who owns this building Bill asked the city does I just take care of it we only use it for weddings and funerals would it be possible for me to hold a Revival here you'll have to talk to the city officials about that when George Wright returned the two of them hunted up the mayor who said sure if you'll put a meter in it there's no electricity in the building now that won't be a problem said bill I work for the utility company in Jeffersonville I'll just put my own meter in the next Saturday morning Bill installed his meter in the old church then visited folks around the area telling them about the Revival meeting scheduled to begin that coming Wednesday night his first Contact was not promising how do you do sir my name's Billy Branham morning mine's Jay Mr Jay we're going to have a Revival meeting next Wednesday night at the old white Church on the Hill will you come Miss Mr Jay turned out to be a hardboiled egg I raised chickens I ain't got no time to go to no church well couldn't you let the chickens alone for a little while and come to the meetings Bill persisted listen fella the man snapped why don't you mind your own business and I'll take care of mine I didn't mean to hurt your feelings sir it continued like that for the rest of the day although most people showed him more courtesy than Mr Jay but everyone he talked to resisted the idea of a Revival Bill wouldn't would have felt discouraged except that he knew that he was there by the word of the Lord somewhere in Midtown one of God's Lambs was bleeding for help since the vision had given him only one small detail the name of the town Bill knew he would just have to keep trying until that needy lamb turned up George Wright placed a notice of the upcoming Revival in the local paper advertising his Pastor as quote unquote another Billy Sunday likening Bill to the famous baseball player turn revivalist who had died in 1935 that gimmick might have worked and drawn a small but curious crowd except that the advertisement also mentioned quote unquote Divine Healing and stated that the Reverend Billy brandham would pray for the sick midtown's conservative attitudes chilled toward such radical ideas that Sunday local minister advised their congregations to stay away from such foolishness the local Church of Christ even went so far as to threaten its members with excommunication if they dar to attend the Revival against such a backdrop of opposition it was not surprising that on Wednesday night only four people sat in the pews of the old miltown Baptist Church George Wright his wife his son and his daughter Bill delivered his message just the same as if the building had been full Thursday evening looked like it would be a repeat of Wednesday 5 minutes before the service began a man with a corn cob pipe in his mouth walked up the front steps and looked through the open doors noticing this man standing there George Wright hurried back to invite him inside well Mr Hall it's good to see you George greeted the man's hair was dished his clothes were dirty and he had several teeth missing on the side of his mouth he turned his corn cob pipe upside down and tapped it against the side of the building letting the ash sprinkle over the steps where is this little Billy Sunday you've been boasting about I want to get a look at him Mr Hall slipped into the first Pew as he came to it and he walked through the door while George walked up to the front to warn his Pastor brother Bill the hardest falling fellow in the country just walked in the door his name is William Hall he runs to Quarry up there on top of the hill oh he's a real rip snorter Bill sat in a chair behind the pulpit reading his Bible he tucked his bookmark in place and stood up maybe he's the one the Lord is after as Bill preached George Wright went to the back of the church and invited Mr Hall to move up closer no thanks I'll take care of things back here and you can take care of them up there by the time Bill finished his sermon Mr Hall had not only come up the aisle he knelt at the rail in front of the pulpit and cried out for God to have mercy on his soul by Friday night a new William Hall had coerced a dozen of his neighbors and employees to come with him to the Revival at the end of the service Bill offered to pray for anyone who was sick several people came forward and were healed afterwards Mr Hall said you know brother brandham today when I was talking around about the meetings and inviting folks I found that there is a girl over here that has been asking for you her name is Georgie Carter and she's got tuberculosis had it for years Georgie's almost 27 years old and if I remember right they say she's been bedridden for 9 years and 8 months she's in pretty rough shape now just Skin and Bones she's so bad they can't even raise her up to put a bed pan under her seems she's been reading a little book he wrote about Jesus being the same today as he was yesterday and she's been begging for you to come pray for her Bill's intuition told him that this was the bleeding lamb in the vision what are we waiting for let's go pray for her I'm afraid it's not that easy her parents belong to the Church of Christ so they don't want to have anything to do with you they think you're a deceiver in that case said bill I'll just put it before the Lord in prayer the healings took place on Friday night stirred up a hornet nest of debate around the community anger surfaced in many scoffed but some people were stung by Curiosity on Saturday night 30 new faces sat in the pews of the old white church and a dozen more healings added fuel to feed the fire of local controversy after the service Mr Hall brought good news to bill the Carters have changed their minds and will let you pray for their daughters tonight as long as neither of the parents has to be in the in the home when you come I guess Georgie has been crying for you so much that they're hoping this will satisfy her I suppose they had to get permission from their Pastor before they could let me come down there Bill commented anyway let's get going what Bill saw when he entered the young woman's room shocked him to the core of his sympathy over the 9 years of her illness Georgie Carter had wasted away until now she lay in bed like a skin covered skeleton her arms looked like broomsticks she could not have weighed more than 50 lbs on the sheet beside her head lay a copy of Bill's little book Jesus Christ the same today the same yesterday today and forever Georgie lips moved but Bill could not hear what she said he walked over to the bed and bent closer she whispered brother brandham I just believe that you would come and Jesus would let me get well sister if he does will you serve him with all your heart she nodded ever so slightly and repeated with all my heart then she coughed the nurse held a cup to Georgie's mouth but the poor girl was so weak she didn't have enough energy to spit to encourage her faith Bill told Georgie about the healing of Mrs Nail's daughter Georgie asked why can't you do for me like you did for that nail girl sister that was a vision I have to see the vision first in two weeks I'll be having another four days of Revival meetings here in miltown Maybe by then God will show me something more definite for now I can pray for you that's all I know if the Lord shows me something more I'll come back but I still believe that after we pray together you're going to get well when 2 weeks later the doors of the old mtown Baptist Church again opened Bill preached about the Saving Grace and healing power of Jesus Christ to twice as many people as he had before each night saw the crowd increase and produce more conversions prompting Bill to set aside Saturday afternoon for a baptismal service God bless you God bless you can you please stand to your feet if we can turn around and just greet each other and say God bless you welcome to children's church big smile smile God bless you amen it's good to see each and every one of you can we wave to

wow and um yeah it's crazy I'm actually here about to talk to you guys you're my beautiful wife I know that the Lord is here and I feel his presence yeah that's good and uh and I hope you guys do too all right let's let's get started so if we can turn our scriptures to Hebrews 111 yeah I was you know when I was told if I could speak you know of course I took that as a as God speaking to me me you know and I already had something on my heart that I wanted to to speak to the people um but the Lord kept guiding me talk about this talk about this yeah but I was like oh Lord I need to talk about this you know it's been in my heart I think it was a sign after sign after sign the Lord the Lord uh he kept guiding me to talk about this specific subject and I wasn't uh I wasn't able to come this morning but uh I saw the service online in the morning and Brother Joseph that was beautiful it's going to take me an hour to get through this I took that as a well it was a kind of um solidified what I was going to be talking about tonight I I know this is children's church but um but I'm here it's I'm G to talk to the parents too um okay so let's get to the verse okay so Hebrews 111 okay when you find the scripture you can say amen amen all right so Hebrews 111 all right one second there we go okay now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen so I remember um reading this scripture plenty of times and just saying oh that's a good scripture cool cool you know and then I think now I think I know you want to have the revelation of who Jesus was that that this scripture it was I had a revelation of what that scripture meant okay so what is Faith and if I could um put a subtitle to it too young to have faith question mark okay so what is Faith No I have a question for the little ones if there's a volunteer who wants to answer what are the five senses brother yeah have two more two more you got it two more feeling and did you say taste did you say taste already Yes okay here so you can come up and get a treat so hopefully that'll incentivize all the young ones to raise their hands there you go pick whichever one you want okay good job good job okay so I guess I wanted to first talk about what is Faith you know you know when God put it on my heart every time I say God it's like the Waterworks come oh right now they're coming so what is so what is Faith you know when God put that on my heart to talk about I knew what it was was but I didn't really you know really get into you know the messages and search it out what it was exactly you see what brother brandom says about it see see how see how he described it CU one thing that I knew is that I I did have faith I do have faith and yeah I so I did have faith I do have faith but I really I wanted to get into the to the nitty-gritty so so what I want to do uh first off kind of want to because I I was reading faith is a substance uh you know preached by Brother Bram and how he talks about or he gives example you know he uh he has someone play the music and then he has an orange I think you know it's just an or do you you know can you taste your orange so I kind of want to go through that so okay so in here if I could have another volunteer nobody likes candy Hannah right okay so put your hand in here don't look in it and then tell me tell me what you feel a spoon and how did you know it was a spoon well I can feel the circle of a spon and oh go ahead well I can feel like how this spoon is deep and it's Circle it has an noal amen so you could feel that it was a spoon when you put hand in there awesome now you can there you go thank you all right another volunteer good job all right who can tell me what color my shirt is okay it's kind of a easy one hold on uh joam or Ezra that always get you confused go ahead okay what color is it here you going to say it from right there oh go ahead go ahead Perfect all right you can grab a candy I forgot about the candy you forgot one more um one more not just the shirt right here it's so white you're good I thought it was oh okay and you put on one of the senses there there's six senses oh right right and I'm GNA get to that too I promise you I'm going to get to that I promise okay so I'm going to hum a song and whoever can tell me what song it is you can raise your hand and I'll pick you ready ready so you already know the song Benji and okay ready so the sister in the back with the glasses good job there you go sister good job all right cool okay if I can another volunteer yes okay all right so I want you to cover your eyes with your hand okay now you're going to tell me what it is that I am putting close to your nose um an orange yes good job I was nervous okay good job good job you go okay all right okay and also to you know for taste I didn't want anybody eating anything in here who can tell me how how would you know it was a orange by not touching it smelling it hearing it or feeling it what sense would you use taste good job good job good job buddy that leaving oh yeah oh yeah yeah okay all right okay last question what is the six sense okay Benji I feel bad Benji what is the six sense so touch taste smell hear feel and what is the six no good job faith faith amen good job Amen brother amen okay so that is the six sent so so Faith so what is Faith so faith is as direct so he answered so so the brother said I had a white shirt that you know to to try and simplified for you guys that is Faith you know he saw the shirt and he knew that that shirt was white he didn't hope that the shirt was white he knew that the shirt was white you know and when the sister when she smelled the orange she knew the orange she knew it was an orange she knew and she you know you know no one could argue that is is is just that but it's even more it's more true okay so I'm going to read a quote from Brother Bram I wasn't able to put it on the slide okay so now Faith is a direct evidence of Things Not Seen felt taste smell or heard now look here I'm going to close my eyes now watch okay so again I just want to say again that that you know Faith again it isn't you hoping for something you know because there is a you know reading faith is a substance you know there was a story when brother Bram I I believe he went to a young girl she had a pentis and then so you know uh to make the story short so he asked her you know do you believe do you have faith that you can be healed and she said yes yes I do and and then brother bam says you think you do you think you have faith I hope that I'm smelling an orange it isn't something that we just imagine you know we hear you know we hear song after song after song and then you're like oh I got it you know I see Jesus Christ yeah you know and I'm not saying songs are bad so please don't what I'm saying is Faith is something direct you know when I find out who when I found out who the Lord was or better yet when he when when I realized that I knew that he knew who who I was because in the end it doesn't matter it's not if you know Christ do Christ know you amen hallelujah um okay uh amen um okay amen it's if does Christ know you so again so he you know brother bham asked the young um sister do you believe and she says I do believe say but brother bam says you know you think no no you don't believe you uh you you just have hope amen but faith is a substance you know there's something direct amen let me see if I find another quote here you know and well and also I was nervous back there but the reason why I'm nervous because I just want to make sure that I get the right information out I don't want to tell you children parents of the wrong thing cuz I'm going to have to stand before God and I don't want to to say my opinions I just want to read you know how brother John says I just want to read the quotes I know we're here for children's church but I I believe I have faith that you guys could get the Holy Ghost you guys aren too young all right see so again you know faith is in something so okay so brother Ram tells a sister you don't truly believe you know and then I think one thing that stumbled me was you know the sister says um you know where did that come from Faith you know is it is it of the devil or of God and then brother br says neither and you know with me when I read I was like what so um know it was a profound thing um yeah it was a very um it kind of got my mind thinking a lot yeah so um in the end it is something I remember reading also as well that there's a a gift of fa and then there's a a portion of faith and a gift of healing know and then but also there is there's also where God and the devil really isn't they're not there but the faith it it's your faith and I'm just going to read a quote so I said okay so it says I said one day Jesus passed by a tree he wanted to find some fruit on it there was no fruit on it he put a curse on it and the tree began to wilt and when they passed by at noon the tree was wilting down amen and Peter remarked and said how quick the tree was wilted and this is where my mind was like wow you know I've read it before but just for some reason there was like a revelation of what that meant he said if you if you would say in your heart for this tree to be plugged up and cast into the sea and wouldn't doubt it it would obey you did he say it and I said he said if you say to this mountain be moved and doubt it not in your heart by and by it would come to pass and here's the awesome part cuz I I've heard this part too you know you know other people kind of say this so did he say sure he did I said I know your unbelieving pastor trying to justify his unbelief said that was a mountain of sin I went to school myself he was kneeling by Mount olives it was Mount of Olives if you say in your heart for it to be moved and don't doubt it I said how much more faith and he said if you had Faith size of a mustard seed I said now if the faith is size of a mustard seed how she would move that mountain how much more smaller Faith would you have to to have just to move that bracelet so when brother Brown was talking to that sister yeah he told her if you have faith move that bracelet Hanging On A String you know and she was like well that's spiritualism and again brother Bram knew that she was going to say that and that's where and then he gives us example of the tree being rooted up cast into the sea amen and that's it's not a it's real if you have the faith to move mountains if you see Mount Everest say you know I have faith that this mountain is going to be cast into the sea that's real you know we we serve a living God amen hallelujah sorry but God is real it isn't something and and I want to bring it back to to the children or if anyone doesn't know the Lord Jesus Christ it isn't I I I I hope Jesus died for me I hope my sins are covered knowing that Jesus Christ died for you and all you everybody here all right and uh obviously we're in children's church so I want to obviously I'm trying to direct to the parents or talk to the parents and the children you know and I'm talking like this because I know you guys understand me the children I know you guys do I remember when my mind you know when I was a younger child you know I remember thinking just thoughts you know why need to get married you know and obviously I didn't know you know you have to have a job you have to have this but the thing is I wanted to get married and that's where why parents we need to talk about that with our children we need to tell them that you need to be born again that you both have to have the Holy Ghost you don't go testing girls around I'm preaching to myself too okay that God will provide or a a woman for you guys no God is real you know train your children that hey have faith God will send your husband you know adah he already is talking about his wife and her name and that's where we need to get in because if you don't teach him someone else is going to teach him in the world that's not going to be a good thing it's going to be a very bad thing and again I don't believe you guys are too young I believe that you guys could be filled with the Holy Ghost I I I believe I know we do a diser sometimes just you know that we put children aside oh you guys are just young you guys don't understand you know when you're 18 that you're supposed to be doing bad things know show me that in the word I want you to be born again when you're 12 13 11 10 why do we need to wait how do we to sew all our Wild Oats or or whatever they say oh oh he's he's 18 he's this sh so he's supposed to be a a a hooligan I'm saying is God is real alive you know I love seeing her brother Mike or brother Al saying it's awesome seeing a young person serving the lord I was seeing the TV I think I saw Hannah raising her hand on myth that's awesome that's beautiful and also too there's a keeping power you

Samuel if you can turn your Bible to 1 Samuel 17 32- 37 and when you have it please first Samuel 17 31 Hallelujah 1732 okay so and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this philistin to fight with him for thou are but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smoted him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smot him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing that he have defied the armies of the Living God Amen the l oh this is good David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paul the lion and out of the Paw of the be he will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistines said unto David go and the Lord be with you I love it you know I want to for you guys if somebody if

parents I want the Holy Ghost how do I get it you know we should be teaching our children you I have a daughter or I hope I hope it's a daughter coming I'm going to be raising her and I want to raise her the way the Lord wants me to raise her not you know not what other people think I don't care what people think I want to know what the Lord thinks amen cuz I'm I'm accountable I just want to do what the word say say they all that to do hard well I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength tell me it's too hard the holy ghost is real so you guys aren't too young just believe and come to him by faith you know Ephesians 2 8-9 for by grace are you saved through faith and through faith and not of yourself it is a gift of God lest any man should boast you know this isn't hoping you're saved or imagining that you're saved but just knowing know I am saved God is real you know how many H how many of you guys woke up today saying I hope the son is out in the sky oh Mom Mom is the sun outside you had no doubt in your mind that's Faith you guys have faith know you know after this you guys are like okay I'm GNA go eat at the Rada how do you know that you're going to get to the Rada you have faith how do you know the Rapture is not going to come and and take you up that's faith and you know you know that's mindblowing you know you know me walking down the steps I I I I didn't doubt it in my heart I just walked that's Faith you know I I wasn't thinking oh I'm going to fall I'm going to do this it's going to happen I'm going to die I just was walking up the stairs just not doubting in my heart that's that's what we need to go to God with because it is impossible to God without faith so we just need to believe and you guys aren't too young again don't let you know you know Goliath you know tell you know you can't do this you can't do this you know you're too young I mean look at David who is this uncircumcised philistin you know if there's somebody at school a bully you know you know do you know who has my back oh the Living God sorry you know we have the same yesterday today and forever okay so I'm I'm going to read another quote I don't know how much time I have someone could let me know okay so now back Yonder the last sermon I preached and my Tabernacle was on David and Goliath and I said here even my own Baptist Bishop stood there and said what do you that night what what did you eat that night said you had a nightmare I said no no sir I don't appreciate that this is you guys talking I don't appreciate that big man no it was the truth to me it was real and he said you with your grammar school education is gonna pray for kings and great men and Statesmen and so forth are going to be healed I said yes sir he said well how do you get that and he said uh you'd better go back over at your Tabernacle and forget about it I said how can I forget about it when it's when it's wrote indelible by the blood of Christ across my heart I said you'll you'll see and he said I'll be I'll be listening and you seen the voice of healing here recently what he apologized you know so the man was apologizing to brother brand and now he's praying for the sick himself now so that he said if I hadn't been so backsliding I'd have listened to that boy and paid attention to what he said about Visions know that's just amazing you know God is good God is real you know you guys aren't too young I love everyone hopefully I didn't offend anybody because I I I I love all you guys and if you guys have anything against me you know I'm sorry for anything I've done but in the end I know that there is a living God and that may I I I I may sound redundant or I've said that a bunch of times someone doesn't know that maybe it hasn't clicked yet you know you know it could be anybody that there isn't a living God I'm here to tell you that there is and he's real looking at my life I know there's a God and I'm up here talking to you guys about so just believe and come to him by faith don't worry about anything don't just worry about what the word says and that's it you know I think the Lord you know has said what he's wanted to say and again I pray and I I just if I have said anything wrong again forgive me you know a lot of times I'm talking to myself examining myself cuz that's what we also need to do we need to examine ourselves look at our lives you know let's just be real with ourselves am I in the word or am I not I I remember one time I spoke ill I I I spoke wrongly to my sister you know what and I and she told me oh Christian wouldn't say that you know instead of me getting mad oh you I said you're right a Christian wouldn't say that I was convicted in my heart so let's examine ourselves you know let's just be real with ourselves if if you see that you're not in the word you know you know just stop fooling yourself I don't have Jesus or I I I do have Jesus and I'm talking to myself cuz for 4 years I was deceiving myself I was going crazy I was being attacked left and right by Sude all this crazy stuff you know and I had to examine myself you know come on Chris be real you know there's two destinations you know there is a God but there's a devil and he's real and I'm telling you kids he's there to kill you guys you know he's not here to flick you or even punch you if he wants to kill you and I'm not here to scare anybody the thing is there's also God and Jesus Christ and he's real and we already won the Battle of the war it's over so again this just be honest with yourself because I love you guys I know I'm going to see every single one of you in the wedding supper I'm not going to go for foolish version I'm going to be in the wedding supp I'm part of the Bride amen well forgive me again anything wrong I've said but my time's almost up but have about about 50 seconds left so I just want to keep telling you that Jesus loves you he loves you he loves you and don't ever say Jesus doesn't love me I don't see him in my life he's working in there he's working he's working and with With God all all things are possible you know I've come to realization that the Christian Life is a easy e life some people say whoa he's not a Christian but thing is reading that we have come into the peace into his rest we've come into his rest and I realize that it becomes hard when we stop believing that's it it's only believe just believing in Jesus Christ that hey I serve a living God at the sound of his name demons tremble de demons tremble can you believe that so that's who I serve if I just constantly believe that I serve a living God nothing can stand against me that's it I rest I just go into his rest you know when I'm strugg or or or or or if you guys have a homework assignment or whatever someone's bullying you just know that there's a God he has your back and the cool thing is he will always have your back and he never will fail and just believe that you know when you know when I figure that out every thought of suicide every thought it went away that's it just believing in Jesus Christ all right um that's that's all I have to say I'm sorry I went a little over but uh yeah if if we can bow our heads so we can pray Lord heavenly father I just we we thank you for another day of life and Lord Jesus Christ we pray that just be with every single heart here and that you just watch over us Lord Lord and that you just be with the children and that you let them know what kind of God that they serve that they could be serving a God that will never fail oh Lord Jesus Christ we
