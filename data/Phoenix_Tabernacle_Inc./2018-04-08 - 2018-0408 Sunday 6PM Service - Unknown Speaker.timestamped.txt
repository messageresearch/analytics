[12:59] here for our children's service it's
[13:01] it's a privilege to be able to bring to
[13:02] you the next installment from the series
[13:05] of books entitled supernatural to life
[13:08] of William Branham we're in book three
[13:10] the man in his commissioned 1946 to 1950
[13:13] before we get started with tonight's
[13:15] excerpt just want to let you know that
[13:19] earlier this week many in the world
[13:22] celebrated the assassination of a civil
[13:25] rights leader those of us in the message
[13:28] however know this week to be the 109th
[13:33] anniversary of our prophet's birth and
[13:35] we're so thankful for that that happened
[13:39] that would have been two days ago and I
[13:42] don't know how long 109 years is but I
[13:45] can tell you how long it is at least
[13:47] since I can remember being living and I
[13:49] know that's a long time and we're very
[13:51] thankful that his birth occurred on
[13:54] April 6th 1909 in a small cabin in rural
[14:00] Kentucky we pick up the story as we're
[14:03] in the year 1946 this is a period of
[14:06] time where the charismatic revival was
[14:08] in full swing and brother Branham was
[14:10] right in the center of it we he has had
[14:13] several miraculous meetings word has
[14:16] gotten around of the amazing testimonies
[14:21] that brothers and sisters at attended
[14:22] these meetings have seen these healings
[14:24] were telling the world we'll pick up the
[14:28] story at the end of chapter 32
[14:30] challenging insanity and then we'll
[14:32] start and read a portion of chapter 33
[14:40] entitled a prayer line eight days long
[14:50] the next morning sunlight pried open
[14:52] Bill's eyes he turned his head on his
[14:55] pillow to look out the hotel window and
[14:57] was startled to see a woman sitting next
[14:59] to his bed his gray her gray hair was
[15:03] pulled tightly back in a bun and she
[15:06] wore a light brown suit with a white
[15:07] waist she was not watching him but was
[15:10] staring sideways at the wall so that he
[15:12] could see her profile she looked sad
[15:15] flustered bill thought how did that
[15:18] woman get in my room
[15:19] the door is locked and here's the key
[15:22] laying on the nightstand lifting himself
[15:25] up on his elbows he said quizzically
[15:27] madam then bill saw a man sitting by the
[15:31] wall just beyond the woman he was a tall
[15:34] grey headed man wearing a light brown
[15:36] suit and sporting a bright red tie he
[15:39] also looked sad the woman turned her
[15:41] head to look at the man and the two of
[15:43] them smiled at one another what's this
[15:45] thought bill he signed up fully in bed
[15:48] when he did he suddenly was no longer
[15:51] lying in bed at all but was standing on
[15:53] a platform in a church that he didn't
[15:55] recognize he bit down hard on his finger
[15:58] to check if he was dreaming the paint
[16:00] assured him that he was wide awake then
[16:03] he knew it was a vision the church faded
[16:07] and bill was back in bed he watched the
[16:09] gray-haired man and woman they smiled at
[16:11] him nodded their heads and seemed to
[16:13] chuck lists though now they were happy
[16:15] then they both thinned into nothingness
[16:18] shutting his eyes bill whispered god I
[16:21] don't understand this so please show me
[16:23] what it means he suspected that these
[16:26] two people would show up in the prayer
[16:27] line that night it had happened several
[16:30] times before he would see a vision of a
[16:32] person before the service then later
[16:34] that night when he recognized the person
[16:36] coming through the prayer line he would
[16:38] know that God was going to do something
[16:40] special in that person's life usually a
[16:43] vision of this type showed bill exactly
[16:45] what was going to take place in the
[16:47] prayer service this vision on the other
[16:49] hand had ended as a mystery taking his
[16:52] Bible off the nightstand
[16:53] Lord where will you have me read your
[16:57] word this morning then he opened his
[16:59] Bible at random the pages split at 2nd
[17:02] Kings chapter 20 bill read where the
[17:05] Lord sent the prophet Isaiah to King
[17:09] ezekiah to tell him his time had come
[17:12] his illness would kill him King Hezekiah
[17:15] turned his face to the wall and prayed
[17:17] fervently for more time the Lord heard
[17:20] ezekias prayer and spoke to Isaiah
[17:22] saying go tell my servant
[17:24] Ezekiel that I will grant him 15 more
[17:26] years at that moment the phone rang bill
[17:29] picked it up thinking it must be pastor
[17:31] Brown instead it turned out to be mr.
[17:34] Kenny from Memphis this case had
[17:37] completely slipped Bill's mind but now
[17:39] he remembered well brother Kenny what
[17:41] kind of news have you got for me
[17:42] mr. Kenny's voice sagged with heaviness
[17:45] brother Branham we sign up with him all
[17:47] night he's about to leave us any minute
[17:49] now
[17:49] tell me brother Kenny does mr. D ever
[17:52] wear a light brown suit in a bright red
[17:54] tie why yes he dresses that way all the
[17:57] time
[17:57] why and does mr. D ever wear a light
[18:01] brown suit with a white waist mrs. D
[18:04] excuse me
[18:05] she's wearing that dress right now how
[18:07] do you know brother Branham do you do
[18:09] you know them yes
[18:15] tell mr. D to come to the phone mr.
[18:17] Kenney hesitated I already told her what
[18:19] she said I want to talk to her bill
[18:21] insisted soon a shaky distraught woman's
[18:25] voice came on the line bill said sister
[18:28] D thus saith the Lord your husband shall
[18:31] live do you believe that mrs. D didn't
[18:34] answer bill could hear some kind of
[18:36] commotion in the background then mr.
[18:38] Kinney was back on the phone
[18:40] what did you say to her brother branham
[18:42] the woman fainted I said her husband is
[18:45] going to live I was describing him
[18:48] because I saw him in a vision a few
[18:50] moments ago I'm flying over to Memphis
[18:53] on the next plane meet me at the airport
[18:55] when bill got to the hospital in Memphis
[18:57] mrs. knees sister met him in the hall
[19:00] she was all huffy and displeased sassing
[19:03] the very idea a Holy Roller preacher
[19:06] here to pray for my dying brother I
[19:08] think it's a disgrace
[19:09] bill walked on by thinking Satan ken
[19:13] can't send enough Devils out of hell to
[19:15] stop it now it's done because it's dust
[19:17] saith the Lord he met a nurse coming out
[19:20] of the room are there any doctors or
[19:22] nurses in there yes she said there are
[19:25] two doctors please ask them to leave the
[19:28] doctors left looking very sour bill
[19:30] instantly recognized the man languishing
[19:32] inside the oxygen tent is the same one
[19:34] he had seen in division that morning
[19:36] mister D lay on his back staring
[19:39] straight up with murky unflinching eyes
[19:41] bill reached through the oxygen tent and
[19:43] took hold the man's hand his own hand
[19:45] swelled to the rhythmic pounding up the
[19:47] pneumonias vibrations brother D can you
[19:51] hear me mrs. D said my husband has been
[19:53] unconscious for two days brother branham
[19:55] bill looked at the elderly woman she to
[19:59] look exactly like he had seen her in the
[20:02] vision you don't doubt anything that
[20:04] I've said to you do know I don't turning
[20:08] his attention back to the dying man bill
[20:09] prayed dear God I know that these are
[20:13] the people I saw this morning in a
[20:14] vision now in the name of Jesus Christ
[20:16] please heal this man even with his eyes
[20:20] closed he knew the suam was going down
[20:22] in his hand because the throbbing
[20:23] stopped then bill felt the man grip his
[20:26] hand they'll open his eyes to see mister
[20:29] D morning his lips with his tongue mrs.
[20:32] D stood at the foot of the bed where the
[20:33] eyes closed still praying bill said
[20:36] mister D do you know me the man cocked
[20:38] his head slightly and said yes your
[20:40] brother branham now his wife jerked up
[20:43] her head in astonishment
[20:44] then when the reality struck her she
[20:48] dove into the oxygen tent yelling dad
[20:50] dad showering him with hugs and kisses
[20:53] without another word bill slipped out of
[20:56] the room and caught the next plane back
[20:57] to Little Rock two days later mr. D ate
[21:00] ham and eggs for breakfast and left the
[21:02] hospital in another day he was back at
[21:04] his post master job overseeing the local
[21:07] mail
[21:13] for the rest of the summer into the fall
[21:15] of 1946 william branham preached
[21:17] throughout arkansas without a break
[21:19] because each meeting was a billboard for
[21:21] the next meeting the crowds grew larger
[21:23] and prayer lines longer at every stop
[21:24] bill pushed himself every night praying
[21:27] for the sick until one two and sometimes
[21:29] three o'clock in the morning he felt a
[21:32] driving compulsion to make up for lost
[21:33] time to somehow make amends for the
[21:36] mistake he had made ten years earlier
[21:37] when God had called him to step out into
[21:40] evangelism and he had refused even
[21:43] though he was in superb fiscal shape
[21:45] from his many years of walking the
[21:46] backwoods inspecting power lines still
[21:49] the constant effort and lack of sleep
[21:50] took a heavy toll in his body he was
[21:52] simply wearing himself out it might have
[21:55] been different if during today he could
[21:56] have slept as long as he needed to
[21:58] regain his energy but that seldom
[22:00] happened there always seemed to be some
[22:02] special need that bill could not bring
[22:04] himself to refuse like the time bill was
[22:07] preaching for pastor Johnson at Corning
[22:09] Arkansas after closing the service at 3
[22:12] o'clock in the morning bill collapsed
[22:13] into bed at the parsonage next door
[22:15] thoroughly exhausted a few hours later
[22:17] the ringing telephone roused him he
[22:19] heard mrs. Johnson saying we can't get
[22:21] him up sir we just got him to bed
[22:24] evidently the party on the other end of
[22:26] the line was persistent finally bill
[22:27] stumbled out into the living room and
[22:29] said grudgingly let me talk to him
[22:32] hello brother branham my name is Paul
[22:34] Morgan said the man in a tired but
[22:36] determined voice I'm the county clerk
[22:38] here at Walnut Ridge which is about 70
[22:40] miles from where you are my 12 year old
[22:42] daughter is dying with pneumonia won't
[22:44] you please come and pray for her the
[22:46] telephone sat near a window letting Bill
[22:48] see outside the day looked overcast a
[22:51] steady drizzle of rain fell on maybe a
[22:53] hundred people huddled in small group
[22:55] groups on the lawn bill knew they were
[22:58] waiting to see him mr. Morgan I would be
[23:01] glad to come if I could but looky here
[23:03] there are mothers standing outside right
[23:04] now waiting for me to pray for their
[23:06] babies they've been standing there all
[23:08] night in the rain how can I leave them
[23:10] to come pray for your daughter
[23:11] I appreciate that said mr. Morgan but
[23:14] those mothers don't have babies that are
[23:16] dying the best specialist I can get say
[23:19] that my daughter can only live about
[23:20] three more hours brother branham she's
[23:23] my only child
[23:23] please come and pray for her
[23:25] thinking back on the death of his own
[23:27] Sharon Rose bill said I'll be there as
[23:30] soon as I can when he hung up
[23:32] pastor Johnson protested brother Branham
[23:34] you can't go down there you're just
[23:36] about dead I'll try to sleep in the back
[23:38] seat on the way Reverend Johnson sped
[23:41] down to wet road at 70 miles an hour
[23:42] while bill lay in the backseat fidgeting
[23:45] in and out of sleep he could not get
[23:47] comfortable
[23:47] his eyes hurt in his head ain't sittin
[23:50] up bill laid his head against the window
[23:51] suddenly his skin tingling and he felt
[23:54] pressure on his eardrums increase then
[23:56] he saw the angel of the Lord sitting
[23:58] next to him on the back seat snapping
[24:00] wide awake bill sucked in his breath as
[24:02] has widened in his muscles stiffened
[24:04] with fear just above the angel circled
[24:07] that supernatural light or more
[24:09] correctly part of that light for it
[24:11] circled right through the roof of the
[24:13] car half in and half out as usual the
[24:16] angel had his arms folded and looked at
[24:18] bill sternly when he spoke the angels
[24:20] voice sounded warm and reassuring say to
[24:23] Paul Morgan thus saith the Lord
[24:26] as soon as the angel finished his
[24:28] instructions he vanished at the hospital
[24:31] bill saw something he had never seen
[24:33] before
[24:33] rather than use an oxygen tent the nurse
[24:35] stood by the bend and periodically put a
[24:37] rubber mask over the girls nose which
[24:42] forced oxygen into her lungs each time
[24:45] the oxygen came on the girl would take a
[24:47] few short shallow laboured breaths the
[24:50] nurse said I'll have to keep this oxygen
[24:52] going it's the only way we can keep her
[24:54] alive she's not breathing on her own mr.
[24:57] Morgan put his arms around bill and
[24:59] sobbed a brother branham I've tried to
[25:00] live right I don't know why God is
[25:02] taking my little girl from me don't get
[25:05] excited brother Morgan bill said
[25:06] reassuringly don't fear I have a word
[25:09] for you from the Lord first I'll pray
[25:11] for your daughter laying his hand on the
[25:13] girl bill asked for her healing in the
[25:15] name of Jesus Christ the nurse started
[25:18] to put the rubber mask over the
[25:19] patient's nose again bill put out his
[25:22] hand and stopped her anxious seconds
[25:24] passed then the girl took us wash our
[25:27] breath on her own the nurse looked at
[25:29] bill questioningly bill motion for her
[25:32] to wait the girl took another breath on
[25:34] her own and then another the auction
[25:37] mask was no longer needed
[25:39] ille turned to the parents many
[25:41] specialists have announced your daughter
[25:42] is dying but thus saith the Lord mr.
[25:45] Morgan your daughter shall recover and
[25:46] here is your word from the Lord remember
[25:49] this all the days of your life the
[25:52] waters are running clear ahead even
[25:55] though bill didn't get any rest before
[25:56] the evening service began he still felt
[25:59] daytime excursions like this one were
[26:02] worthwhile because three days from then
[26:04] Paul Morgan's daughter was well enough
[26:06] to return to school god bless
[26:11] [Applause]
[26:29] [Music]

[53:41] yeah she seems to be the reasonable one
[53:43] right but it's looking like so far we
[53:44] have we we have like there's some issues
[53:48] that I just can't I can put my fingers
[53:49] on you yeah we have one that just
[53:51] doesn't care about anything right we
[53:53] have one that seems like he cares too
[53:54] much but not about the important things
[53:56] exactly I'm really interested to see
[53:58] what hammer
[53:59] well hammer has okay and we're back and
[54:02] three two one welcome back before the
[54:06] break we had our beautiful bacon family
[54:09] here crispy bacon fake bacon and ham I
[54:13] love bacon here we are at the sunday
[54:17] talk where we don't just talk
[54:19] well we why don't walk now we were right
[54:23] about to hear a word from this hammer
[54:25] bacon can you explain your side of the
[54:27] story please please Ellis well yes I I
[54:29] am very very happy to do that um well
[54:33] you know I I love my brothers very very
[54:37] very much and um you know when Big Bad
[54:40] came through the neighborhood lobster
[54:42] and well I mean they chose to build
[54:45] their houses on foundations that just
[54:47] couldn't hold up
[54:52] I did the Christianly sisterly thing and
[54:56] I but I'm not the bad person they paid
[55:02] me out to be the reason crispy has to
[55:05] sleep on the couch was because bacon
[55:08] bacon moved all his shoes into the third
[55:10] bedroom in the box that point Krispy was
[55:18] ticked off so he wouldn't sleep in the
[55:19] bedroom anyway cuz the shoes were in
[55:22] there first so I want to help my
[55:25] brothers but it's so hard
[55:29] puttin up with them so so I'm hearing
[55:32] something here first of all that's a
[55:33] beautiful accent you got there
[55:35] yes he's not pork ish mark sign is it
[55:40] pork and cheese it's okay awesome that's
[55:44] what I thought
[55:45] well second of all I hear that I hear
[55:48] that you want to help your brothers
[55:49] right she's willing to help them rebuild
[55:53] but she's not willing just to waste her
[55:56] time unless they have a solid foundation
[55:59] now that seems that reasonable exactly I
[56:02] think we're gonna yeah let's see what
[56:05] our audience has to say let's see what
[56:07] our audience has to say do we have any
[56:09] any questions for any of our porkers

[58:01] example the other day like I got up
[58:03] really early to start my like even
[58:05] before she came home for lunch so I live
[58:06] already up crispy so so you're saying

[58:12] really row before lunchtime
[58:13] thank you get it right yeah I'm sorry it
[58:15] sounds like you want like for something
[58:16] you're supposed to do you're supposed to
[58:18] wake up before lunchtime exactly it's
[58:20] like saying I take care of my kids
[58:22] you're supposed to take care of your
[58:23] kids well I know you don't have kids and
[58:27] I can see that you can't afford them
[58:28] right now your lavish lifestyle and
[58:30] youtubing habits have got you where you
[58:34] are and that's why we're here to talk
[58:35] about this thank you for listening
[58:38] thanks ok well it's because that I'm not
[58:45] like this guy over here because I mean
[58:47] it's straws right uh-huh
[58:49] nice it looks beautiful some of us would
[58:53] like to I want to live there so I could
[58:56] see sure I could see the fakin he has a
[58:59] lot with your ha he's really considering
[59:01] his image so he really cares about
[59:03] aesthetics he wants to look good I was a
[59:06] beautiful deal even with all the effort
[59:08] that you put in looking good there was
[59:09] still not a solid foundation look bricks
[59:13] is just it takes too much work I don't
[59:15] want to get dirty
[59:16] I mean brown mud does not go good with
[59:19] this outfit come on let me ask you a
[59:21] question so building a house with bricks
[59:23] is too much work so when your house
[59:27] falls down you run to the person who did
[59:30] all the work to put that house up now
[59:33] how piggish least selfish is that what
[59:36] do you mean how big oh whoa whoa whoa
[59:38] don't get your pigtail all in the bunch

[59:43] supposed to be able to have her job
[59:45] literally like you what do you mean it's
[59:47] her job after job like hello
[59:50] like when not when I need something you
[59:52] gotta help me like
[59:53] oh it makes you think that somebody else
[59:55] has a responsibility to help you for
[59:57] your decision so that's what she's
[59:59] supposed to do like no people do are you
[1:00:02] getting kind of crazy right now what do
[1:00:03] you mean are you getting crazy like are
[1:00:05] you supposed to help me or not say

[1:03:16] stand you brave little pig I can't go
[1:03:19] ahead I want to help my brother Justin
[1:03:25] but only if they build on the right
[1:03:28] foundation because all the work will be
[1:03:30] useless you know
[1:03:32] crispy you're so focused on your 43
[1:03:37] followers you're forgetting to follow
[1:03:39] the one person that can help you reach
[1:03:46] you agree with everything I say
[1:03:49] but then when push comes to shove you
[1:03:51] won't lay the foundation
[1:03:53] I want to help my brothers I'm willing
[1:03:57] to help them yes but I won't help them
[1:03:59] keep on building stick and stroll houses
[1:04:02] thank you can you give her a round of
[1:04:04] applause go what I hear mr. say they say
[1:04:14] you're willing to help your brothers and
[1:04:17] you've done a great job at building on a
[1:04:20] foundation boys you have a young pig who
[1:04:23] is willing to help you she's willing to
[1:04:26] help you get on the right hoof if you
[1:04:28] would just let her help you build that
[1:04:31] foundation there's so much truth into
[1:04:34] that now let me say I appreciate how
[1:04:36] you've went ahead and physically laid
[1:04:39] the right foundations at home yeah
[1:04:40] that's beautiful yeah but I think dr. du
[1:04:43] and I would both agree that there's also
[1:04:45] another foundation that's even more
[1:04:46] important than a physical foundation and
[1:04:49] I think is the underlying issue for all
[1:04:52] of the problems that I said this family
[1:04:54] oh yes I see you're fighting each other
[1:04:56] you're getting your pork chops all
[1:04:58] chopped up like you need to just sit
[1:05:01] down and listen to the solution cuz we
[1:05:04] can talk how many could agree with the
[1:05:06] round of applause we can talk about
[1:05:07] problems for us forever about problems
[1:05:10] for hours but we just want to spend five
[1:05:13] minutes talking about the solution
[1:05:15] exactly and the solution is Jesus Christ
[1:05:17] amen he is the foundation the foundation
[1:05:22] the solid rock to everything now I have
[1:05:27] a scripture for you I'm gonna ask a
[1:05:28] brave little little piggie to read the
[1:05:30] scripture who would be volunteer that
[1:05:32] knows how to read that one of you guys
[1:05:35] want to read for me who wants to read
[1:05:38] Elijah did you raise your hand come read
[1:05:39] for me can you come grab this microphone
[1:05:42] I want you to hear the words of Jesus
[1:05:45] that speaks about the solid foundation
[1:05:49] and mr. mr. Bacon's both of you miss
[1:05:52] bacon if you would please listen to this
[1:05:54] and take this to your little piggy heart
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:05:59] anyone who listens to my teaching and it
[1:06:04] is wise like a person who builds a house
[1:06:08] and they sell that walk that dock the
[1:06:12] weighing comes in the hominy and the
[1:06:15] floor waters wise and the wind beats
[1:06:20] against the house it will not come
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:27] collapse because it is built on bedrock
[1:06:32] but anyone who hears my teachings and
[1:06:38] does not does follow oh obey is like a
[1:06:53] foolish like a person who built house
[1:06:57] upon the sand when the rain and flood
[1:07:03] comes but the winds will be against the
[1:07:11] house that house it will collapse with a
[1:07:21] mighty crash amen can you give him a
[1:07:25] round of applause there was some hard
[1:07:28] words in there
[1:07:29] oh yeah so basically we need to build
[1:07:33] upon a solid foundation because when
[1:07:36] that big bad wolf comes it starts
[1:07:38] glowing stars line is your foundation
[1:07:42] stable he starts howling and Javier
[1:07:46] offing is your foundation stable so
[1:07:51] think about it think about that what is
[1:07:55] your biggest fear what is stopping you
[1:07:56] because I need you to know that the only
[1:07:59] person standing in the way of you and
[1:08:01] having complete success spiritually and
[1:08:05] physically is your own little piggy self
[1:08:09] so what is your biggest fear what is
[1:08:12] keeping you from this crispy you gotta
[1:08:15] face it well I I guess if I had to be
[1:08:22] really honest with myself my biggest
[1:08:28] fear and my biggest worry is that I
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:33] really don't know how to do anything
[1:08:35] like literally I have zero skills and
[1:08:40] like if I have to make a foundation or
[1:08:44] if I have to have a foundation and then
[1:08:46] build upon that foundation I can't do
[1:08:48] that by myself because I literally can't
[1:08:51] do anything by myself hmm thank you for
[1:08:55] being so honest thank you yeah that was
[1:08:57] very brave but you know what you might
[1:08:59] feel under-qualified but Jesus Christ
[1:09:02] does not call the qualified he qualifies
[1:09:08] who he calls
[1:09:12] I'm not a little piggy hey little piggy
[1:09:15] how are you doing mommy piggy if you
[1:09:19] want you to go ahead and take her to the
[1:09:21] back and then come back you no problem
[1:09:23] everybody say your prayers for the baby
[1:09:25] piggy but thank you thank you for being
[1:09:31] honest they are faking faking please
[1:09:35] sure I guess my my biggest problem is
[1:09:40] yes yes playing both sides of the fence
[1:09:44] I mean it's it's really hard cuz I I
[1:09:48] know I know some storms are gonna come
[1:09:50] and I and I know it's gonna be tough
[1:09:53] can anybody relate to that and I mean
[1:09:55] it's it's just so easy to lean on my
[1:09:58] sister I mean she's always been the
[1:10:00] responsible one you know and I mean I
[1:10:03] guess you know some yeah me and crispy
[1:10:06] fight a little bit but it's always fun
[1:10:08] you know I never scuffle hoof or nothing
[1:10:12] but you know it whenever it does get
[1:10:15] tough I lean on her and and I guess I
[1:10:18] never realized that she might get
[1:10:20] annoyed by it or what that is
[1:10:21] understandable and sometimes we sweet
[1:10:24] scuff hooks with our brothers and our
[1:10:25] sisters and it's not gonna be a walk in
[1:10:27] the park but love is more than just some
[1:10:30] feeling that we feel love it
[1:10:34] isn't is a decision so and so is
[1:10:38] building on the right foundation just if
[1:10:41] you don't start building on the right
[1:10:42] foundation which is Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] you can't even love because love is God
[1:10:46] how could you even know God how could
[1:10:48] you even know love if you don't know him
[1:10:51] so like I said this isn't an issue about
[1:10:54] squabbling this is an issue about
[1:10:56] resentment this isn't even an issue
[1:10:58] about your parents I know you feel
[1:11:01] really really bad since your dad got
[1:11:02] turned into some sausage links and you
[1:11:04] weren't able to make it right some of
[1:11:06] the things that you said that's okay
[1:11:08] Jesus Christ today wants to help you lay
[1:11:13] the foundation for the rest of your life
[1:11:16] if you would be willing and the choice
[1:11:21] is yours are you willing can we give
[1:11:23] them someone courage
[1:11:24] can you give them a hand of a round of
[1:11:26] applause are you willing bacon so the
[1:11:31] first thing I mean I'm willing yeah I
[1:11:34] just I know it's gonna be hard
[1:11:36] miss hammer are you willing cuz you did
[1:11:39] a great job laying your physical
[1:11:41] foundation yeah but you have to also
[1:11:43] understand your trials they come because
[1:11:45] you're a daughter of God you can't just
[1:11:47] kick your trials out of your house you
[1:11:49] have to accept what God has for you cuz
[1:11:52] that is going to mold you if we be picky
[1:11:54] if we worth picking if we kick everybody
[1:11:57] out of our house we'll be by ourselves
[1:11:58] but God has our family there to mold us
[1:12:01] to teach us how to love to teach us how
[1:12:03] to be patient to teach us how to be kind
[1:12:05] so you need to carry on that spirit of
[1:12:08] Christ amen I thank you and so we want
[1:12:13] to lay that foundation for you as well
[1:12:15] would you be willing yes so all you have
[1:12:17] to do is raise up your little hoof and
[1:12:19] we're gonna say a simple prayer yeah
[1:12:20] okay Lord Jesus you know what doctor do
[1:12:26] I've done a lot of saying can you please
[1:12:29] leave them in a simple prayer to accept
[1:12:31] the Lord Jesus Christ in their heart

[1:12:35] beloved Lord Jesus we present before you
[1:12:39] the bacon family Lord and now Lord

[1:13:18] way and show them that you are the only
[1:13:21] foundation help now our brother krispies
