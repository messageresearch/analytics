[30:40] verse but in the days of the voice of

[32:01] in Phoenix
[32:03] Tabernacle
[32:07] Phoenix I thank all the associate
[32:13] pastor and all the
[32:20] committee to once again give me the
[32:22] opportunity to speak to you this
[32:26] morning
[32:30] I know it is a great
[32:37] responsibility to open a ceremony like
[32:40] this one
[32:46] year really we do wait upon the
[32:53] Lord because the Bible
[32:56] says
[32:59] those that wait upon the
[33:03] Lord they will renew their
[33:08] strength for the
[33:09] [Applause]
[33:17] Lord and I believe that the Lord is
[33:19] going to renew our
[33:25] strengths
[33:27] the subject of this
[33:36] morning you want to know who is the
[33:38] messenger the angel in the Revelation
[33:52] 7 who is the seventh
[33:55] angel
[33:59] of Revelation 107
[34:04] apyp I'm going to tell you something
[34:06] brother
[34:10] sister that is really a great
[34:16] privilege to know the days in which
[34:18] you're living
[34:23] in to know the angels that the Lord has
[34:26] sent us today
[34:32] and to know the the message that the
[34:34] angel has brought to
[34:40] us because this is what is
[34:46] Grace because
[34:52] Grace is to know the message of your
[34:55] day
[35:00] and the angel that the Lord has sent
[35:06] us as you're reading in Revelation
[35:11] 10 from the first verse to the seventh
[35:17] verse you'll see that there is two
[35:23] angels there is a Celestial angel
[35:28] that
[35:31] descends that is gathered with a cloud
[35:34] around
[35:39] him and descend with an open
[35:45] book and cries with a loud
[35:52] voice and the Bible says that he cries
[35:54] like a loud lion
[36:00] [Music]
[36:02] yeah and in verse
[36:07] seven there is another
[36:12] angel that is the
[36:19] seventh this is what they say at the
[36:21] voice of the seventh
[36:25] angel count
[36:27] when is going to H the
[36:33] Trump you see there is two
[36:36] Angels Heavenly
[36:39] Angel and an angel of
[36:42] [Music]
[36:43] Earth and the the Heavenly
[36:48] Angel is the Lord Jesus
[36:52] Christ is the mighty
[36:55] angel
[36:59] is the one that descends with the open
[37:03] book and the Earthly
[37:08] angel that is the seventh
[37:12] [Music]
[37:13] angel of Revelation
[37:18] 107 do not confuse
[37:25] themy the angel of Revelation
[37:35] 11:15 because Revelation the angel of
[37:37] Revelation
[37:43] 11:15 speaks as well of the seventh
[37:49] angel that sounds the
[37:55] trumpet
[37:57] and this is not the angel that concern
[37:59] [Music]
[38:02] us because the prophet
[38:06] says the
[38:09] trumpets is for
[38:11] [Music]
[38:13] Israel but the
[38:16] seals is for the
[38:20] Gentiles and we got to make difference
[38:22] of
[38:25] those
[38:29] the angel of of Revelation 11:15 does
[38:33] not concern to
[38:41] us now who is the angel of Revelation
[38:47] 10:7 brother
[38:53] says said that the word angel means
[38:58] [Music]
[39:03] messenger when we see that the word
[39:05] angel means
[39:10] messenger it can be an Heavenly
[39:16] messenger or it can be a Earthly
[39:25] messenger
[39:27] and the angel of Revelation chapter 107
[39:29] is an Earthly
[39:35] messenger it's a
[39:38] man it's a
[39:43] brother it's a me it's a it's a
[39:46] messenger that has been sent to the
[39:53] church it's a messenger that has been
[39:55] sent to the seven Church
[40:02] age we know that there is seven Church
[40:11] ages and at each age there has been a
[40:14] messenger for each one of
[40:19] them Ephesus at his
[40:24] messenger at his m
[40:30] his
[40:33] Messenger as his Messenger as
[40:38] well as his Messenger as
[40:42] well Philadelphia his Messenger as
[40:49] well also as
[40:51] [Music]
[40:54] messenger can we say Amen
[40:57] [Applause]
[41:02] we know that the me the message ofus is
[41:08] Paul for SM
[41:13] isus foram
[41:19] is
[41:22] Philadelphia that is
[41:25] Wesley
[41:28] but we had to know as
[41:33] well the messenger that has been sent
[41:35] for
[41:40] laia and I cannot you my words to say
[41:45] [Music]
[41:48] that that the message of Revelation
[41:55] 107
[41:56] is the same of the one in Revelation
[42:03] 3:14 and Revelation 3:14 it
[42:10] says to the Church
[42:12] of Leia I'm
[42:16] writing to the Church of Leia I'm
[42:21] writing
[42:25] right
[42:27] to the age of lodia
[42:29] [Music]
[42:34] [Music]
[42:36] right and we see that the angel of
[42:39] Revelation 10:7 is the same one in
[42:42] [Music]
[42:46] 3:14 is the
[42:51] same is among the the the angel of the
[42:55] churches
[42:59] now
[43:02] notice the difference between the
[43:07] others the difference between
[43:11] Luther the difference between
[43:17] Wesley is not a reform
[43:20] [Music]
[43:23] reformator he's not a reformer
[43:29] but he is a re
[43:35] Revelator he is a
[43:37] [Music]
[43:39] Seer he is a
[43:42] prophet
[43:44] because God
[43:47] says in Amos
[43:51] 37 that does God does
[43:55] nothing
[43:58] before revealing

[44:47] prophets so Revelation
[44:51] 10:7 and Amos
[44:54] 37 is the same
[44:58] thing it's the same
[45:02] thing we can't listen to what the
[45:04] prophet
[45:06] says in the church
[45:15] ages at

[46:36] ministry will will
[46:40] finish the mystery of
[46:45] God as he has announced it to his
[46:47] servants the
[46:52] prophets god with treat this God with
[46:55] treat this last
[46:59] one as a
[47:03] prophet because he is a
[47:08] Prophet this is what Paul was in the
[47:10] first
[47:14] age and in the last age there was also
[47:17] going to be
[47:20] one in Amos
[47:23] 3 3 to 7
[47:25] [Music]
[47:30] do we sound the trumpet in the in the in
[47:32] the
[47:36] city without the people being in the
[47:40] [Music]
[47:45] trouble with in the city happen some
[47:52] Misfortune uh without God being the
[47:54] author
[47:57] without God being the
[48:00] author because the
[48:02] Lord the
[48:04] Lord does
[48:09] nothing before revealing it to His
[48:17] prophets so this messenger is a
[48:22] prophet and where is this promise
[48:29] and his promised in
[48:32] Malachi
[48:38] 456 I will send you Elijah the
[48:43] Prophet this is his
[48:48] promise Malachi
[48:52] 4 he
[48:54] comes
[48:56] to
[48:59] restore the faith of the children to the
[49:05] father he came to
[49:09] restore and what did he
[49:14] restore the baptism in the L of the Lord
[49:21] Jesus the of the of
[49:24] God
[49:31] communion all the thing that has been
[49:33] Disturbed throughout the
[49:40] ages and he came with the spirit of
[49:42] Elijah upon
[49:48] him because because is Elijah sent for
[49:52] the age of the
[49:54] Gentiles
[49:57] because you're going to notice you're
[49:59] going to
[50:02] notice that the age in which we living
[50:07] in the the condition of this
[50:11] age are the
[50:15] same of the the condition of the age of
[50:22] aab and it was a that time that God has
[50:25] sent
[50:30] elah it's the time of Rus that God has
[50:33] send John the
[50:39] Baptist and in this age God also sent us
[50:42] the spirit of
[50:47] Elijah and this message of of Revelation
[50:50] 10 verse
[50:54] 7
[50:57] is the same of the one in Malachi
[51:01] 4 is the same
[51:04] person it's the same
[51:07] promise Revelation
[51:11] 10 Revelation
[51:15] 3:14 and Malachi
[51:19] 3:4 Mal 4
[51:22] yeah Mal
[51:24] 4
[51:26] it's the same
[51:29] person he
[51:34] comes to reveal the secret that has been
[51:36] hiden throughout the
[51:41] ages we're going to go through the
[51:43] message
[51:47] Bridge
[51:54] 28
[51:56] so we see the seventh
[52:01] angel the seventh angel must necessar be
[52:03] a
[52:09] prophet so that the word of God must
[52:11] come to
[52:14] him
[52:16] sorry not not not not a
[52:22] priest not a pope
[52:25] no nobody
[52:29] else cannot receive it the
[52:34] way the word does not come to those
[52:39] ones the word of
[52:42] God only comes to
[52:45] prophets
[52:47] always
[52:52] always promised one
[52:57] and when it will
[52:59] come he would take the mystery of
[53:05] God as the church would be in total
[53:11] confusion with all those
[53:17] denominations he bring back the faith of
[53:21] the bring back the Fai of the

[55:27] the first
[55:30] seal in page
[55:32] 192
[55:34] paragraph
[55:41] paragraph
[55:45] Okay notice notice notice
[55:50] not
[55:54] so
[55:56] [Music]
[55:59] notice this last
[56:02] message of the last Church
[56:05] age is not a a
[56:09] reformer it's a
[56:11] prophet not a
[56:17] reformer the others were
[56:21] reformers but they were not
[56:23] Prophets
[56:25] if there
[56:28] were the word of God come to the
[56:34] prophets it's for such reason they kept
[56:41] baptizing using father son Holy
[56:46] Spirit and all those
[56:50] things that means that there were
[56:53] reformers
[56:56] and not
[56:58] prophets but in the last
[57:02] days there will it will be most
[57:07] important a
[57:10] prophet to take the mysteries of
[57:14] God and restore
[57:18] them because the
[57:23] Mysteries as been known only by the
[57:31] prophets then this man must must
[57:38] come now you know what I mean to
[57:43] say canot be a
[57:46] [Music]
[57:48] reformer must be a
[57:52] prophet because it must be someone
[57:56] that has this
[58:00] gift that is
[58:03] here it must be there it must be
[58:07] there and then understands the
[58:12] word God had to send us a
[58:17] prophet according to Mal
[58:19] 4 according to Revelation
[58:23] 107
[58:25] he must come to reveal the
[58:31] Mysteries everything that has not been
[58:33] touched by the
[58:40] reformers as the angel of Revelation
[58:42] 10:7
[58:48] comes the prophet said that he comes to
[58:51] do two
[58:53] things the first
[58:57] one it will bring back the faith of the
[58:59] children to the faith of the
[59:03] fathers is the
[59:06] restoration it must restore the
[59:10] word and the second
[59:13] thing it must reveal the
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] Mysteries has been hidden in the seven
[59:23] Thunders

[59:28] Mysteries
[59:28] [Music]
[59:31] there that will literally give
[59:35] us the faith of the

[59:45] faith that must change
[59:50] us must transform
[59:53] us that's the faith of
[59:58] rapture and that faith of
[1:00:01] rapture will come with the

[1:12:26] at the beginning of his
[1:12:31] ministry and at the beginning of this
[1:12:33] one year on
[1:12:37] Earth at that moment
[1:12:40] there the mystery of

[1:13:19] of the
[1:13:21] father you know brother R

[1:13:32] Dimension and that the people the saint
[1:13:34] were coming to hug
[1:13:38] him he asked the
[1:13:41] question and
[1:13:45] said will Paul be
[1:13:50] judged and
[1:13:52] said
[1:13:53] if those of Paul will
[1:14:00] enter mine as well will
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:05] enter are we saying
[1:14:09] amen if those of Paul enter

[1:14:24] of Paul
[1:14:29] enter as well you must get
[1:14:34] in he as well must get
[1:14:38] in
[1:14:41] because we have
[1:14:44] received the faith of the
[1:14:48] fathers the faith of the
[1:14:52] Apostles and and above
[1:14:56] that Paul did not preach the Seven
[1:15:01] Seals Paul did not preach the seven
[1:15:06] Thunders Paul did not preach the third
[1:15:10] pool Paul did not preach God within the
[1:15:17] flesh but we do have all of
[1:15:22] that
[1:15:25] so we can say that we have more than
[1:15:26] what
[1:15:30] Paul and Paul
[1:15:34] said without
[1:15:39] us you couldn't you could achieve
[1:15:45] Perfection that means Perfection of
[1:15:49] Paul we're depending upon you
[1:15:55] the Perfection of
[1:15:57] Peter depending on you and my
[1:16:01] brother so without
[1:16:05] us they could not achieve
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:11] Perfection how to how to recognize this
[1:16:18] messenger how to recognize this seventh
[1:16:22] messenger
[1:16:25] how will we recognize
[1:16:32] him when God sends a
[1:16:40] messenger or when he wants to send a
[1:16:49] messenger he never says I will send
[1:16:52] Emanuel
[1:16:58] Fernando no
[1:17:01] no God does not do it that
[1:17:06] way God gives a
[1:17:11] promise God gives the
[1:17:16] word when the messenger
[1:17:21] comes it does not
[1:17:23] he does not be himself upon the
[1:17:28] chest I'm the one that God has
[1:17:32] sent it does not do that
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:37] way because God works in
[1:17:43] Simplicity when when the messenger
[1:17:47] comes he presents the
[1:17:52] word he presents the
[1:17:56] word they said what this is what God
[1:18:00] Said what
[1:18:04] says take Moses for
[1:18:10] instance God never said to Abraham that
[1:18:12] I will send
[1:18:15] Moses but he said to
[1:18:20] him that your people will be in the in
[1:18:22] the in a in
[1:18:23] a in the strange in the Str Strange
[1:18:33] Land but I will bring them out after 400
[1:18:42] years and I will judge the country in in
[1:18:45] the land in which they
[1:18:51] are and when Moses encounters the pillow
[1:18:55] of
[1:18:58] fire he just went
[1:19:02] there and he delivered the
[1:19:07] promise and the people had to see
[1:19:12] Moses and see that he is the
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:18] one and follow

[1:26:40] seven and the
[1:26:43] seventh is William Maran
[1:26:47] Bram this is why the Bible
[1:26:51] says
[1:26:53] that at the day of the seventh angel at
[1:26:56] the voice of the seventh
[1:27:00] angel not at the time of the eighth
[1:27:05] one not at the day of the ninth
[1:27:11] one but at the at the day of the voice
[1:27:14] of the seventh
[1:27:17] angel when it shall begin to sound the M
[1:27:21] trumpet
[1:27:23] the mystery of
[1:27:26] God should be
[1:27:31] finished as he has declared to his
[1:27:33] servants the
[1:27:37] prophets the seventh age is
[1:27:41] here the seventh angel has
[1:27:45] come God has sent us to sent us to

[1:28:55] [Applause]
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:19] you we thank the Lord for our brother
[1:29:22] brother
[1:29:24] Joel would you please
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:29] stand we have a another Minister that'll
[1:29:32] be speaking this
[1:29:36] morning it's our brother Pedro pinetta
[1:29:40] Chavez Pedro petta Chavez from Durango
[1:29:44] Mexico Durango
[1:29:46] Mexico amen only believe as he is being
[1:29:51] welcome
[1:29:58] man
[1:30:01] oh
[1:30:06] be
[1:30:09] oh
[1:30:13] be all things are
[1:30:20] possible oh
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:50] only
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:31:00] take your may take your place we're
[1:31:01] going to
[1:31:11] continue but he was mentioning that a
[1:31:13] mystery is a truth that has been
[1:31:16] divinely
[1:31:20] revealed
[1:31:22] but also Revelations 10:7 that in the
[1:31:24] days of the voice of the seventh
[1:31:27] angel when he shall begin to
[1:31:30] sound the mysteries of God will be
[1:31:35] revealed and that that scripture goes
[1:31:37] with uh Amos
[1:31:41] 3:7 surely the Lord God shall do nothing
[1:31:44] unless he reveal it his secret to the
[1:31:45] Servants of
[1:31:47] prophets because a
[1:31:49] mystery is equivalent
[1:31:52] to a to a
[1:31:55] secret and according to God's word
[1:31:58] according to the
[1:32:02] Bible in Isaiah 4515 or 14 more or
[1:32:09] less truly you are the god that covers
[1:32:14] himself and to cover means to
[1:32:17] hide you are the god that
[1:32:20] hides
[1:32:22] that's why the word of God the
[1:32:25] Bible in Isaiah I believe
[1:32:30] 28 he said this is how the word of God
[1:32:32] would be just a little bit here a little
[1:32:36] bit
[1:32:37] there or they're a
[1:32:39] little they're a
[1:32:41] little it's like putting together a
[1:32:44] puzzle one Prophet mentioned one
[1:32:47] thing another Prophet mentioned
[1:32:50] another that's why the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:55] said I worship you father who hid these
[1:32:58] things from the wise and the
[1:33:01] learned and you've revealed it you've
[1:33:04] revealed
[1:33:05] it to your your children or
[1:33:10] babes so truly this Bible is a
[1:33:14] mystery we
[1:33:16] are in the
[1:33:18] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:33:23] every time that I open a
[1:33:26] book every time I grab a message book a
[1:33:30] tape and I
[1:33:32] hear and I
[1:33:34] listen to the voice of the
[1:33:36] seventh declaring the
[1:33:42] Mysteries because the voice of the
[1:33:44] seventh angel came to declare the
[1:33:47] Mysteries so then every message that we
[1:33:50] read
[1:33:53] spoken by God's Prophet
[1:33:56] will is a mystery being
[1:33:59] known every
[1:34:04] message because all of the
[1:34:06] Mysteries all of the Loose
[1:34:09] Ends were going to be
[1:34:15] declared for for as simple as a message
[1:34:18] may appear to
[1:34:20] be it is mystery being revealed or
[1:34:23] declared it doesn't matter which
[1:34:25] message as simple as it may
[1:34:29] appear a mystery being declared and we
[1:34:31] need
[1:34:34] it that's why the Apostle Paul said
[1:34:36] speaking to
[1:34:39] Timothy all scripture is inspired of
[1:34:42] God and is Meek or for
[1:34:46] teaching to
[1:34:48] correct and to encourage
[1:34:53] to the end of the God's man to be
[1:34:57] perfect and wholly prepared for All Good
[1:35:01] Deed so all scripture in its time and
[1:35:05] moment we need
[1:35:11] it there are occasions where you might
[1:35:13] say c i I love a certain
[1:35:16] subject that's because that's what
[1:35:17] you're needing at that
[1:35:20] moment there were things that did not
[1:35:22] call my attention but with
[1:35:25] time I I love
[1:35:28] them because the time came when I needed
[1:35:32] them I want to read you something from
[1:35:34] God's prophet and
[1:35:39] says I'm taking this from the message of
[1:35:42] Grace because we know this is a message
[1:35:44] of
[1:35:46] Grace I I I don't think I have a dollar
[1:35:48] bill in my
[1:35:49] pocket oh yeah here do I have a
[1:35:52] dollar forgive
[1:35:54] me on the back side of this
[1:35:59] dollar you'll see the Seal of the United
[1:36:01] States on the left
[1:36:03] side right
[1:36:06] amen the Seal of the United
[1:36:09] States we are in a great country
[1:36:12] brothers and it's not only
[1:36:16] great because it produces
[1:36:18] dollars it's great
[1:36:22] and it's Holy
[1:36:24] Ground because God's Prophet set foot
[1:36:29] here America is parallel to
[1:36:35] Isel America was founded upon the the
[1:36:37] foundation of theost
[1:36:40] prophet that's why God could raise up a
[1:36:42] prophet
[1:36:43] here because the bases replac
[1:36:47] for America kept the
[1:36:50] fillment
[1:36:52] God spoke in the English language in our
[1:36:56] time it's a great
[1:36:59] country it is a privilege to be in the
[1:37:01] United States amen
[1:37:09] amen the easi you here food is very
[1:37:13] inexpensive if you go to a buffet
[1:37:18] here you might spend what you probably
[1:37:20] earned in just a couple
[1:37:21] and eat at a
[1:37:23] buffet if we if we put that in
[1:37:27] equivalent if someone in Mexico goes to
[1:37:30] a they're not going to spend what they
[1:37:32] work what they earned in two hours
[1:37:34] they're going to spend what they earned
[1:37:35] all
[1:37:36] day that's the
[1:37:39] equivalent the the food is
[1:37:41] inexpensive where it's
[1:37:44] expensive is when you buy a home in
[1:37:48] here once brother Paul Garcia j
[1:37:50] mentioned
[1:37:52] Paul G Garcia
[1:37:54] Jr he said it's easier for you in mexo
[1:37:57] to to obtain a home house than it is for
[1:38:00] us in the United
[1:38:03] States I was living here for seven years
[1:38:06] and he said he spoke a great
[1:38:08] truth but as far as the basic things
[1:38:11] it's very
[1:38:14] inexpensive and that's why we understand
[1:38:16] why so many people want to come here
[1:38:19] that's the
[1:38:20] attraction
[1:38:21] but if they only
[1:38:23] knew that there is a greater
[1:38:25] attraction
[1:38:28] here here stood 100
[1:38:32] Angels bringing all of the Mysteries
[1:38:34] seven
[1:38:36] angels I was born in
[1:38:39] Mexico and I want to say something with
[1:38:41] all of my Mexican
[1:38:45] Pride even though we have citizenship of
[1:38:50] Heaven
[1:38:53] I want to say that in the old times
[1:38:55] Arizona New
[1:38:57] Mexico they belong to
[1:39:01] Mexico but they are better off with the
[1:39:03] United
[1:39:05] States because with Mexico they would
[1:39:06] have been
[1:39:07] Catholic but I have that little
[1:39:10] PR if you look at it that way the seven
[1:39:13] angels they came down in
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:17] Mexico and in Mexico we have a shield of
[1:39:20] an eagle
[1:39:22] eating up a
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:27] snake that's
[1:39:29] why we as
[1:39:33] Mexicans hearing our brother ber Garcia
[1:39:36] he
[1:39:36] says I used to hate
[1:39:39] Mexico I didn't want anything to do with
[1:39:42] it but God sent him to
[1:39:49] Mexico and if there's a Ministry that's
[1:39:51] been helped by the ministry of brother
[1:39:53] it's us
[1:39:57] Mexicans and we appreciate God greatly
[1:39:59] for
[1:40:01] this the prophet of God
[1:40:05] in he spoke about the
[1:40:08] Hispanic he said oh to
[1:40:11] Hispanic you you are
[1:40:14] humble you you you are satisfied with
[1:40:17] just the
[1:40:19] crumbs blessed be the Lord
[1:40:24] God bless and I congratulate all those
[1:40:27] speak because they have something very
[1:40:28] precious privilege very
[1:40:33] special we that are hard-headed
[1:40:36] we we we hear Brother Bernie G
[1:40:40] Garcia and you read brother Bron's
[1:40:43] messages and it helps you to appreciate
[1:40:45] that
[1:40:48] Ministry if it had not been for God's
[1:40:50] prophet
[1:40:51] this would be a closed
[1:40:53] book that's why there's been so many
[1:40:56] denominations because it's a closed
[1:40:59] book but through brother BR message this
[1:41:02] book has been
[1:41:08] opened amen
[1:41:12] brothers and through the ministry of
[1:41:15] brother who who opens up to
[1:41:18] so you you understand brother Brandon
[1:41:20] better
[1:41:23] now I'm speaking about my
[1:41:26] experience now I'm going to tell you as
[1:41:27] brother Bram say he said do it as I
[1:41:32] do he says if I'm eating a cherry
[1:41:36] pie I I separate the pits that I come AC
[1:41:39] and I keep eating the cherry
[1:41:42] pie so if brother ped P gives you a
[1:41:45] little pit just set it aside and keep on
[1:41:49] eating Brown goes on saying
[1:41:59] behind the seal you see the Great Seal
[1:42:00] of the United States now remember that
[1:42:02] United States America is in the
[1:42:07] prophecy said there is the
[1:42:10] eagle there is the shield and other
[1:42:14] things but this side on the right side
[1:42:16] for me you see the
[1:42:19] pyramid
[1:42:25] if you notice here above the pyramid is
[1:42:27] The
[1:42:28] Headstone and beneath it it
[1:42:31] says the Great
[1:42:34] Seal it says it there in
[1:42:36] English the Great Seal how
[1:42:40] tremendous that the seal to
[1:42:45] Crown right here at the United
[1:42:49] States
[1:42:52] now in our
[1:42:54] coins we have to
[1:42:59] recognize that no sinner can uh end
[1:43:05] Christianity every time that you put uh
[1:43:08] you put a
[1:43:11] a there they type our the the birth of
[1:43:13] our Lord every
[1:43:16] calendar everything speaks of
[1:43:19] him and even in our
[1:43:22] money the head The
[1:43:26] Headstone that is
[1:43:30] Christ because Christ revealed himself
[1:43:33] here through a
[1:43:36] man named William Mariam
[1:43:41] Bram blessed be the
[1:43:44] Lord but now according to
[1:43:46] prophecy The Headstone will
[1:43:49] come the message of of the
[1:43:52] hour and I want you to
[1:43:55] notice that when that headstone
[1:43:59] comes the prince that will declare the
[1:44:01] message will
[1:44:04] Proclaim Grace
[1:44:08] Grace because it's
[1:44:10] by that we are
[1:44:14] saved so that no one
[1:44:19] shall will will
[1:44:23] Bram was such a humble
[1:44:26] man because he
[1:44:28] knew that it was by
[1:44:35] Grace we are saved by
[1:44:38] grace that is by faith not by
[1:44:45] works but the works have their
[1:44:48] place The Works show
[1:44:53] that you're
[1:44:57] saved but what saves you is God's
[1:45:02] Grace Grace saves
[1:45:08] you Grace is what God does for you and
[1:45:13] works is what you do for
[1:45:16] God to
[1:45:19] show your
[1:45:22] appreciation for what God's done for you
[1:45:26] so then the works that I
[1:45:28] do is to thank
[1:45:30] him for what he's already
[1:45:33] done thank you for saving
[1:45:36] me because I was
[1:45:42] lost so I can't do enough to appreciate
[1:45:46] or thank you for what you've done for
[1:45:49] me
[1:45:51] the prophet of God keeps going on
[1:45:54] here Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[1:45:58] 13 if I spoke with human or Angelic Tong
[1:46:02] tongues though I had
[1:46:05] discernment though I had
[1:46:08] gifts if I took all of my
[1:46:11] gifts for all my goods to feed the
[1:46:15] poor if I had Faith to move
[1:46:19] mountains
[1:46:21] if I had the knowledge to understand all
[1:46:23] things I am
[1:46:26] nothing
[1:46:27] until until the love comes
[1:46:31] down which is
[1:46:34] Grace
[1:46:35] love because God's love is
[1:46:39] God and he's given by
[1:46:42] Grace he gave himself to us by
[1:46:45] Grace it's all
[1:46:49] Grace blessed be the name of the
[1:46:53] Lord when brother Brandon speaks on
[1:46:55] Abraham's
[1:46:57] life we know that Abraham is the father
[1:46:59] of
[1:47:01] faith and the
[1:47:03] church in the
[1:47:06] spiritual follows the steps that Abraham
[1:47:09] went through Abraham went
[1:47:11] out when God told him to come
[1:47:16] out and the church comes out when God
[1:47:18] tells them
[1:47:20] so we know Abraham's
[1:47:22] Life by all the things that Abraham went
[1:47:26] through how it is that God even when he
[1:47:28] had mistakes he saw him
[1:47:31] through brother Brown
[1:47:33] says
[1:47:35] remember
[1:47:37] Abraham was not saved by
[1:47:41] works he was saved by
[1:47:44] grace
[1:47:47] Abraham was saved through faith
[1:47:51] by faith which is is is
[1:47:55] Grace faith is Grace love is
[1:48:01] Grace the headone is
[1:48:05] Grace when we speak about
[1:48:08] faith says the faith is the foundation
[1:48:11] of all things it's
[1:48:13] the it's the base of all to believe it's
[1:48:16] the base of
[1:48:19] foundation Faith covered by hearing
[1:48:21] hearing the word of God so when we speak
[1:48:23] about
[1:48:23] faith we're talking about the
[1:48:26] foundation we're talking about the
[1:48:29] feet when we speak about the head we're
[1:48:32] speaking about the
[1:48:33] head brother Brown says this we are
[1:48:37] Grace from our feet to our head or head
[1:48:41] to
[1:48:44] toe so then what have I done what have I
[1:48:49] done
[1:48:53] what do I do if it's if it's from toes
[1:48:55] to head then what
[1:48:58] Happ so what we understand that we
[1:49:00] believe
[1:49:02] him and that takes care of everything
[1:49:06] else because even the word is
[1:49:09] his and we have the faith through the
[1:49:12] word so then what did we do of
[1:49:14] ourselves what do I
[1:49:18] have what do I have
[1:49:20] nothing nothing I was an
[1:49:26] unbeliever but God's
[1:49:28] grace visited my
[1:49:30] life and I believed
[1:49:33] him that's all I
[1:49:35] needed was to believe him and he takes
[1:49:39] care of the
[1:49:41] rest blessed be the name of the
[1:49:46] Lord when God's
[1:49:49] prophet
[1:49:52] we know that when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:57] came he didn't know all
[1:50:04] things uh speaking as an individual
[1:50:06] because Jesus came as
[1:50:07] individual he didn't know all
[1:50:12] things when they asked him if he would
[1:50:14] restore the Kingdom of Israel at that
[1:50:18] time hey this is not your to know the
[1:50:20] things of God has placed
[1:50:23] sign and the prophet says it's because
[1:50:25] Jesus didn't know he didn't
[1:50:29] know look Jesus received the
[1:50:33] Revelation that's why when the Book of
[1:50:37] Revelations when we didn't know the
[1:50:39] message of the
[1:50:41] hour we knew it as the Book of
[1:50:44] Revelation but when the seventh angel
[1:50:46] came to our lives he told us that the
[1:50:49] book of
[1:50:51] Revelations is the revelation of Jesus
[1:50:57] Christ the revelation of Jesus
[1:50:59] Christ that God
[1:51:02] gave so who gave it to
[1:51:04] Jesus the Holy Spirit he gave him the
[1:51:08] Revelation he didn't know
[1:51:10] either he gave him the
[1:51:15] Revelation the revelation of Jesus
[1:51:17] Christ that God gave him to manifest to
[1:51:19] a servant in other words through all all
[1:51:21] of us throughout the
[1:51:23] ages the things that were to happen soon
[1:51:26] in other words the
[1:51:28] future and declared it sending it
[1:51:34] through his seventh
[1:51:37] angel so now we have
[1:51:40] it the Revelation that that Jesus had
[1:51:43] that God
[1:51:44] gave when brother Brandon began to
[1:51:46] preach on the revelation of Jesus
[1:51:48] Christ he preached it in
[1:51:57] 1960 and so I want to read to you
[1:51:59] something that that he says before he
[1:52:01] begins to speak on
[1:52:02] it it's in the chapter one it's
[1:52:06] Revelations chapter
[1:52:08] 1 the reason for this special time is
[1:52:10] that
[1:52:15] we the holy spirit has placed upon my
[1:52:17] heart this conviction or warning that
[1:52:20] the church in this
[1:52:23] day should have this
[1:52:26] message speaking on the church
[1:52:29] ages because I
[1:52:32] believe that they are the most
[1:52:34] outstanding messages of the
[1:52:37] Bible because they reveal Christ in his
[1:52:39] church at that
[1:52:41] time it reveals how Christ was going to
[1:52:43] be at every because that is the most
[1:52:45] important
[1:52:46] thing see how he moved throughout every
[1:52:48] age every
[1:52:52] time in other
[1:52:55] words that if the scripture has revealed
[1:52:57] Christ to
[1:52:58] us and the condition of the
[1:53:01] times that it would behoove us it would
[1:53:04] behoove us to search it
[1:53:07] out it it does US good to search us out
[1:53:11] search it out it helps
[1:53:15] us it would behoove us to search it out
[1:53:18] and come to find out
[1:53:20] where we are
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:23] at and this has never manifested so much
[1:53:26] in my
[1:53:28] heart until the last
[1:53:32] election and then I saw where we were
[1:53:36] at that was 196 what he was referring
[1:53:41] to that it was when President John
[1:53:44] Kennedy was
[1:53:47] elected he said when he was elected that
[1:53:49] hit my
[1:53:52] it's time for people to know these
[1:53:59] things and the Holy Spirit began to
[1:54:01] reveal to me to warn the
[1:54:04] people and to preach
[1:54:08] this and because of those same times
[1:54:10] along those same
[1:54:13] times he preached the Third
[1:54:16] Exodus and about that time President
[1:54:19] Kennedy died
[1:54:22] but he preached these things I'm going
[1:54:23] to read to
[1:54:27] you before we can find out what this
[1:54:29] Exodus
[1:54:30] means I'm going to type today's
[1:54:33] Exodus with that Exodus of back
[1:54:36] then and see if they don't go exactly
[1:54:39] parallel one of them is
[1:54:41] natural an exodus is a way
[1:54:45] out the message came says come out of
[1:54:48] her my people
[1:54:50] it's an
[1:54:53] exit and the same thing he did in the
[1:54:55] natural he's typing it once
[1:54:58] more an antitype in the
[1:55:01] spiritual an exod a spiritual
[1:55:06] Exodus notice how how God made this
[1:55:09] Exodus
[1:55:12] watch what preparations did he
[1:55:15] make and study it for just a moment and
[1:55:19] then see
[1:55:22] today notice that before this
[1:55:26] Exodus a pho was raised up that did not
[1:55:28] know
[1:55:30] Joseph now the people of Israel was
[1:55:33] beloved it was
[1:55:35] loved and grew in abundance in
[1:55:39] Egypt they grew in
[1:55:43] abundance and they were loved because of
[1:55:45] everything that happened through Joseph
[1:55:46] there but when seti the Pharaoh died
[1:55:50] which was the one who knew
[1:55:52] Joseph and in his place came R who did
[1:55:55] not know
[1:55:57] Joseph and when Ramis saw the
[1:55:59] people he saw them as a
[1:56:01] threat he said there's too
[1:56:05] many there's too
[1:56:08] many if there's a war they're going to
[1:56:10] join the
[1:56:13] enemy it's it's looks like something
[1:56:15] cruel but in
[1:56:17] reality God had told Abra
[1:56:23] that his people was going to were going
[1:56:24] to be in another land blessed but that
[1:56:27] after 400 years he was going to bring
[1:56:29] them out of that
[1:56:31] Nation because even though they were
[1:56:33] blessed in
[1:56:35] egyp their inheritance
[1:56:39] was that's why God
[1:56:41] allowed that didn't know
[1:56:44] Joseph to make their life
[1:56:47] uncomfortable so they can go out to
[1:56:49] their
[1:56:50] land to the promised
[1:56:52] land where God could bless
[1:56:58] them because God cannot bless man when
[1:57:00] he is outside of his
[1:57:05] position there was a pharaoh that was
[1:57:07] raised up that did not know
[1:57:09] Joseph and that was the beginning of the
[1:57:12] beginning that was the beginning of the
[1:57:16] Exodus so in
[1:57:18] 1960 the beginning of the Exodus
[1:57:22] started
[1:57:24] amen and you know what that cus it it
[1:57:28] brought a crying out a clamor the people
[1:57:30] began to cry out more they squeeze us
[1:57:33] the more we CED
[1:57:34] out and God heard
[1:57:37] the because God
[1:57:39] hears listen the prophet says he says I
[1:57:43] have de he told the prophet what made me
[1:57:45] descend was that I heard I heard the Cry
[1:57:49] of my
[1:57:50] people and that cry out is is not just
[1:57:53] anything it it's a
[1:57:57] shout and I have descended to free
[1:58:05] them and when that thing began to form
[1:58:07] itself under a political
[1:58:09] power God began to prepare
[1:58:12] himself I believe that if any man be a
[1:58:15] spiritual
[1:58:16] man he could see what is happening now
[1:58:23] we're receiving a pharaoh that does not
[1:58:25] know the the freedom of religion
[1:58:29] amen it was the beginning of the exod it
[1:58:32] was the beginning to go out it was a
[1:58:38] blessing when the people of Israel left
[1:58:40] they were they were chased or followed
[1:58:42] all over the
[1:58:45] world the prophet of God said it was the
[1:58:48] the kind hand of God
[1:58:50] so that they could return to
[1:58:53] Palestine to wait on their
[1:58:56] Messiah it was the hand of
[1:58:58] God because God is the one who allows it
[1:59:01] he's the one that has control when
[1:59:03] something happens it's because there is
[1:59:06] a blessing on its way that's time to cry
[1:59:09] out so that that blessing may
[1:59:17] come what a great thing to type the
[1:59:19] natural church with the spiritual
[1:59:22] church God working or dealing with
[1:59:24] Israel in the
[1:59:25] natural as he does it with the church
[1:59:29] nowadays under justification they left
[1:59:33] egpt there are three stages in their
[1:59:37] Journey there are three stages of
[1:59:40] Grace to get home please stand I'm about
[1:59:43] to
[1:59:44] finish I'm going to
[1:59:47] close notice while he was speaking and
[1:59:49] preparing
[1:59:51] himself 400 years had gone
[1:59:55] by and God was just on time with his
[1:59:59] word now we noticed later that after 40
[2:00:02] more
[2:00:03] years so in other words it was 400
[2:00:06] years but they had to remain another 40
[2:00:09] years additional
[2:00:12] years and I could stop here just to
[2:00:15] say now you
[2:00:18] canite because I know it's being
[2:00:20] recorded in the because I know I believe
[2:00:22] that
[2:00:24] we the coming of the Lord
[2:00:26] Jesus it is already
[2:00:30] overdue I believe it went overdue long
[2:00:33] ago but this is for the
[2:00:37] church it's not ready to meet up with
[2:00:43] him now if he noticed he said as it was
[2:00:45] in the times of Noah Before the
[2:00:47] Flood that's how it would be
[2:00:50] and God didn't want one anyone to
[2:00:54] perish but for everyone to come to a
[2:00:57] repentance so he had
[2:01:00] patience the age of the
[2:01:02] flood was
[2:01:07] overdue
[2:01:10] wow it was very
[2:01:12] overdue the
[2:01:15] destruction and the and the coming out
[2:01:18] of also very
[2:01:21] overdue 40
[2:01:24] years overdue past the written
[2:01:27] time and that's the reason I
[2:01:30] say if the church doesn't make herself
[2:01:33] ready that is its duty to be
[2:01:38] ready the bride has made herself
[2:01:42] ready the the the garments have been
[2:01:45] paid for
[2:01:47] ready but you have to be ready
[2:01:51] to wear those
[2:01:52] garments blessed be the Lord let's
[2:01:55] pray let's pray to the Lord and give
[2:01:59] thanks beloved Heavenly
[2:02:03] Father full of love Grace goodness and
[2:02:08] mercy thank you for the voice of the

[2:02:22] resounding help us to be in that
[2:02:27] preparation and be able to see what is
