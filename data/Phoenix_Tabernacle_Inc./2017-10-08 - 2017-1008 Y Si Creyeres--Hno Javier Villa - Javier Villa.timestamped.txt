[30:30] Kidman just like here brother su lugar
[30:33] ciraolo we're in an enclosed area if you

[30:54] anyway there is nothing that can stop
[30:55] the presence of the Lord it was your own
[30:57] testigos so they were just witnesses
[31:00] masculine Jose is no be honest at Oprah
[31:02] scientists but some of them were not in
[31:04] the myths in staccato as present in this
[31:08] case Thomas in lowest hola presenter
[31:10] cuando el Senor obvious talent Reyes he
[31:12] was not present when the Lord was in
[31:15] there made some of the municipal already
[31:17] here not to mass so the rest of the
[31:18] disciples were telling Thomas hemos
[31:20] visto el maestro look we have seen the
[31:23] mess i style con los otros he is been
[31:25] with us for mas que el la los cielos
[31:27] oppressive Aquarius considerable coastal
[31:30] ease for as much as he's appreciated and
[31:32] loved his disciples his servants
[31:34] you know Miss Cleo he wouldn't believe
[31:36] them no less creo he couldn't believe
[31:37] him
[31:38] yo hasta que no set the steagle I until
[31:43] I'm not a witness
[31:45] so until I
[31:48] each my hand super Stalin therefore the
[31:50] every go into his side where he was
[31:53] injured or meta means dados or until I
[31:55] put my fingers flowers federal
[31:58] performance from per forer's polos Klaus
[32:00] where his hands were pierced by those
[32:02] nails entonces no we are clear then I
[32:05] won't believe until then get her menuhin
[32:08] how tremendous Alette I would allow this
[32:10] applause and he was one of the disciples
[32:12] it sauces rhetoric a passive to tiempo
[32:15] newzeas mass so the scripture says that
[32:17] a few days went by its Aparicio tres
[32:19] Antaeus and he appeared before them
[32:21] again he a key I started to Moscow nails
[32:23] yeah and Thomas was here with them now
[32:25] LS this a possible SWAT resistance in
[32:28] your and the Lord says possible Soto's
[32:33] pass passing by this a piece cream estas
[32:37] palabras what a beautiful word no sigue
[32:39] siendo Soto still Senor that the Lord
[32:42] can tell us fast Nogueira possible so
[32:44] trophies beat you care more so in total
[32:47] I stop Tomas and so Thomas was there it
[32:50] Tomas cave a bonito and so Thomas was
[32:55] very surprised
[32:56] usually Yamato mosque and Jesus cause
[32:59] Thomas
[33:00] Ben Thomas support for come Thomas
[33:02] support or says please
[33:04] my name is madness look my hands you
[33:07] point to the other in this madness
[33:09] put your finger through my hand or
[33:12] diamond pun to man or and Miko style now
[33:14] put your hand on my side into systemic
[33:17] on this way so so when Thomas did that
[33:19] its annual are Apprendi the Lord rebukes
[33:23] lazy nausea synchronously non-korean day
[33:26] says don't be an unbeliever be a
[33:27] believer that a man doeth as tremendous
[33:30] it was as a Tom I respond do so Thomas
[33:33] replied the or Senor mio ay dios mio he
[33:35] said O Lord and my god and toesik is
[33:38] electrically mono Soto's so here's a
[33:40] scripture that we read we read Tomas
