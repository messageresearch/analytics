[30:04] God bless you wasn't that
[30:09] beautiful Tonight We have a special
[30:11] Treat in Store for you as we enter into
[30:14] the Second Book of the series of
[30:15] supernatural the Life of William Branham
[30:18] the young Man in his desperation
[30:20] covering the years of 1933 to
[30:23] 1946 in the chapter numbers we in
[30:26] chapter 12 Which Just happens to be the
[30:28] First chapter of the Second Book And I
[30:31] just comment that Uh I thank the lord
[30:33] for bringing Our prophet along and
[30:36] through the early spiritual wilderness
[30:38] That he Found himself in as bewildering
[30:42] as It
[30:43] was What Faith he Had inside remained
[30:46] Alive and the lord Had brought him to a
[30:49] Point in his Life Where he was 24 years
[30:51] old the year is
[30:54] 1933 as we Start
[30:57] [Música]
[30:58] William bram's newfound Faith was not a
[31:01] sideline to him not something extra like
[31:04] butter and Jelly to spread on his Bread
[31:07] It was his Bread for 24 years he Had
[31:11] wandered aimlessly through his own
[31:13] spiritual wilderness hungry to the point
[31:15] of starvation in a spiritual sense
[31:18] eating bark leaves and grass to Stay
[31:20] Alive and Now for the First time in his
[31:24] Life he was eating real Food packed with
[31:27] spiritual nutrition feeding on Jesus
[31:31] Christ the Bread of Life Who came down
[31:34] from Heaven to give eternal Life to a
[31:37] dying man Bill felt his spiritual
[31:40] strength growing week by week suddenly
[31:43] the world held more meaning than Just
[31:45] sweat and blisters rejection and
[31:47] confusion Now Billy Had hope And Love
[31:50] and a purpose that was everlasting his
[31:53] Faith in Jesus Christ quickly became the
[31:55] center of his existence the pivot around
[31:58] Which all his thoughts and activities
[32:01] revolved Billy heard his pastor preach
[32:04] that The Reason almighty God sketched
[32:06] his thoughts in the Bible was so that
[32:08] Every Christian could know the Will of
[32:10] the lord for his or her own Life all It
[32:14] took was to read the Bible and pray that
[32:17] saying made sense to Bill and he read
[32:19] his Bible
[32:20] viciously eager to increase his
[32:23] knowledge of the word so that he could
[32:25] put it to use Daily to to him the Bible
[32:28] seemed like a House Full of treasures
[32:30] that he Had suddenly inherited he Wanted
[32:33] to go into Every room Pull out the
[32:35] drawers open the cupboards and searched
[32:37] through the closets to see exactly What
[32:40] It was he now
[32:42] owned he Had not read many Books since
[32:45] he finished the seventh grade 10 years
[32:47] before so his Reading skills were rusty
[32:50] and
[32:51] Slow he followed the general meaning
[32:54] well Enough but he could not pronounce
[32:56] Those difficult old testament names like
[32:58] ara
[33:00] zeres neb
[33:02] jaz zer Babel and bah and he often
[33:07] struggled with the odd syntax of King
[33:10] James english so Far removed from his
[33:12] own Kentucky dialect when he preached
[33:15] his First sermon at the beginning of
[33:16] 1933 Bill did not Trust his tongue to
[33:19] read the Bible aloud instead he
[33:22] persuaded hope to Sit on the platform
[33:24] behind him and read his text for him
[33:27] whenever he gave her a Signal his
[33:30] subject Was the Grace and care of God in
[33:32] the tumultuous Life of Samson hope read
[33:35] bill's text Out Of The book of judges
[33:37] and Bill started to expound soon he
[33:39] Wanted to read the to the congregation
[33:42] What Jesus said in John 14 he nodded to
[33:46] hope and She began Let not not Your
[33:49] Heart be troubled Bill broke in you
[33:52] heard what it said Don't let yourself be
[33:54] troubled he nodded Again in hope and She
[33:56] She continued Reading ye Believe in God
[33:59] Believe also in Me Again Bill
[34:02] interrupted do you do it do you really
[34:05] believe and so continued his First
[34:08] fumbling attempts at preaching awkward
[34:10] and choppy Yes but redeemed by an
[34:13] intense sincerity that Made him
[34:16] eloquent listening In The audience ella
[34:18] Branham considered her son's words
[34:21] carefully the dramatic change in billy's
[34:23] Life as well as his miraculous healing
[34:26] Had awakened something spiritual Deep
[34:28] within her own Soul She responded by
[34:30] committing her Life to Jesus in her 39th
[34:33] year overflowing with happiness Bill
[34:37] baptized his mother in the name of the
[34:39] lord Jesus Christ encouraged by his
[34:41] mother's response Billy began pressing
[34:43] his Father To Come To Church Charles
[34:46] Branham refused and in spite of all
[34:48] bill's efforts could not be budg in that
[34:50] Direction that bothered Billy he
[34:53] couldn't Shake his concern for The Lost
[34:55] based on that hor experience during his
[34:58] operation at age 14 when he Had
[35:00] seemingly sank down into the region of
[35:03] Lost and drifting souls Now Bill prayed
[35:05] often Dear God Don't let my Daddy go to
[35:09] a Place like that please Let him see
[35:11] your Grace and accept your pardon One
[35:14] night after most of the family Had gone
[35:16] to Bed Billy lay on a Pet in the Front
[35:19] room praying for his Father Who was
[35:21] drinking at a local tavern While Billy
[35:23] prayed he Had an impression as If a
[35:27] voice was saying Rise up he stood up and
[35:30] walked out of the door not knowing Why
[35:33] but feeling like he was Being drawn
[35:35] toward something behind the house a
[35:38] footpath crossed several vacant Lots
[35:40] overgrown with broom sage which is a
[35:43] reddish knee-high grass common to that
[35:45] Area Billy followed The path by
[35:48] starlight when he reached the center of
[35:50] the Field he knelt bowed his Head folded
[35:53] his hands and continued praying for his
[35:55] Father suddenly he opened his eyes and
[35:58] was startled to see a man standing 10
[36:01] Feet in front of him a most unusual Man
[36:04] short and slight of build with hair down
[36:07] to his shoulders a Close trim beard and
[36:10] a white robe that stood out clearly
[36:12] Under the Stars The man was standing
[36:15] sideways to Bill Looking toward the East
[36:18] he was a peaceful figure his hands were
[36:21] folded and his Feet were staggered One
[36:23] Foot slightly ahead of the other Bill
[36:26] looked a Second Time at Those Feet
[36:28] incredibly they were not touching the
[36:31] ground Now wait a minute bill thought as
[36:34] he bit his own knuckle hard Enough to
[36:36] hurt I'm not asleep no I was in There
[36:40] praying for Dad and something said come
[36:42] out here and here stands this Man it all

[37:30] his Memory a Face so Rich in character
[37:32] no artist in the world could Ever Paint
[37:34] it It was a Face stern with Authority he
[37:39] looked like If he would speak The World
[37:42] would end and yet his eyes radiated such
[37:46] kindness and compassion And Love at
[37:49] daybreak Bill came to himself Still in
[37:52] the broom sage Field shivering from the
[37:54] Cold night Air and from his wet pajama
[37:57] shirt evidently soaked by his own Tears

[47:37] testimonio sobre lo que Dios ha hecho y
[47:40] mostrado en mi
[47:46] vida Bueno entonces comienza casi como
[47:49] dos meses antes del
[47:54] campamento
[47:57] y bueno Estaba en la escuela y ustedes
[47:59] saben que las pruebas las batallas en la
[48:01] escuela son
[48:06] difíciles yo veo hermanos y hermanas de
[48:09] en Cristo que van a la escuela también
[48:11] ahí y yo Yo sé que es muy difícil para
[48:19] ellos mi gente sabe que yo soy un
[48:24] cristiano
[48:26] me preguntan Oye quieres salir los
[48:32] domingos y les tengo que decir no di Ah
[48:35] bueno tiene la iglesia
[48:37] verdad le dije sí yo tengo que ir a la
[48:41] iglesia y me dicen Pues vas a la iglesia
[48:46] mucho me dicen no necesitas que ir a la
[48:48] iglesia
[48:51] tanto entonces continuamos a hablar y le
[48:53] hablé de ello
[49:03] que
[49:05] eso continuaba a pasar y yo no tenía
[49:10] interés yo no tenía interés de venir a
[49:13] la iglesia
[49:15] seguido y pensé que me estaba alejando
[49:18] un poco
[49:24] más
[49:28] y bueno saben está el campamento que que
[49:30] estaba en
[49:34] camino y todos andan hablando sobre el
[49:36] campamento Cómo va a estar tan
[49:44] emocionante y verdaderamente este año yo
[49:47] no me sentía tan emocionado decía era el
[49:49] campamento y
[49:54] ya
[50:01] este año estaba tan emocionado me
[50:02] prefería yo antes ir con mis amigos y
[50:05] quizás ir al juego de fútbol americano
[50:07] en la
[50:11] escuela Y entonces mis amigos seguían
[50:14] hablando y de eso entonces dije Bueno
[50:16] iré como voy cada
[50:23] año y sem Med semanas antes del
[50:30] campamento mi tío el hermano
[50:35] Álvaro regresé a la casa de
[50:42] práctica estaba ahí me iba a dar un
[50:44] corte de cabello es porque estaba muy
[50:46] tarde en la noche entonces estaba en la
[50:52] casa cortándome el cabello y comenzamos
[50:55] a hablar
[50:59] habla del campamento y me dice estás
[51:01] preparado para el
[51:07] campamento y le contest honestamente no
[51:10] estaba tan emocionado
[51:21] sobre y dije que me pongo casi un poco
[51:24] nervioso como saben los sábados en el
[51:26] campamento todos están como con el
[51:28] espíritu santo
[51:31] no y tengo tenía un poco de
[51:36] miedo y me dice sabes por qué te pones
[51:38] de
[51:40] miedo es porque sabes lo que es no sabe
[51:43] lo que
[51:47] es dice que si no sabes lo que algo es
[51:50] es porque no lo quieres
[51:52] aceptar that sense to me was y yo dije
[51:56] ah sí eso se ya se sonó mejor y dijo eso
[52:00] ya da
[52:06] sentido y me pregunta entonces tú sabes
[52:09] que es el espíritu santo quieres
[52:11] recibirlo y le dije
[52:20] Sí me dice solo tiene que ir al
[52:23] campamento expectativa no solo llegar
[52:30] ahí y tienes que quedarte ahí hasta que
[52:33] recibas
[52:40] algo y comencé a pensar sobre ello Y
[52:42] pensé de qué más tengo que
[52:48] perder sentía que estaba pujando mucho a
[52:51] Dios Entonces necesitaba que pensaba que
[52:54] necesitaba hacer
[52:57] esto entonces vino el
[53:02] campamento llegamos el viernes por la
[53:04] noche y pues nos
[53:11] acomodamos y llegamos al servicio y yo
[53:13] me dije si mismo yo vengo con
[53:19] expectativa y una semana antes del
[53:21] campamento yo en realidad
[53:24] intent en
[53:28] Ora intenté leer la palabra y quedarme
[53:31] en
[53:33] oración entonces vino el viernes por la
[53:36] noche y vine ahí en expectativa de
[53:46] algo y yo creo que esa noche vieron dos
[53:49] ministros yo creo el hermano Alberto fue
[53:51] el que estuvo hablando esa
[53:54] noche
[53:56] y estaba hablando sobre sus pruebas que
[53:58] tuvo que
[54:03] pasar y tuvo su
[54:15] llamada responder algo est hablando con
[54:18] un
[54:24] pequeño
[54:30] y explicó él que Dios sí lo ama hay
[54:33] alguien que sí
[54:34] lo y qui salvó su
[54:42] vida entonces eso me subió el interés en
[54:45] lo que él estaba
[54:50] hablando y me dijo él dijo entonces
[54:54] estado usted aquí en este campamento
[54:56] estuvieron por 10 años
[55:03] seguidos y en mi mente Yo sí estuve
[55:06] pensando tengo que hacer algo porque he
[55:07] venido aquí por un
[55:14] tiempo y dijo ha venido por 10 años y si
[55:17] no ha recibido
[55:19] ahora algo entonces ahora es el
[55:23] tiempo y dijo quizás no haya otra
[55:30] oportunidad Y entonces comencé a orar y
[55:33] orar y la gente comenzó a venir hacia el
[55:37] altar yo vine hacia el
[55:44] altar y comencé a llorar estaba pidiendo
[55:46] por
[55:52] perdón y seguía pido y orando al Señor
[55:55] por favor perdóname por todas las cosas
[55:57] que he
[56:06] hecho y seguía pidiendo y pidiendo y
[56:08] luego un hermano llegó y levantaba mis
[56:11] manos yo y me la
[56:13] agarró y me dice Dios ya te ha
[56:19] perdonado y dio la respuesta a lo que yo
[56:22] estaba
[56:23] diciendo
[56:26] dice Dios ya te ya te ha perdonado ahora
[56:31] recíbelo entonces yo ahí quebré en
[56:37] lágrimas y Sentí algo muy
[56:45] tremendo y mientras estaba allí
[56:47] derramando abriendo mi
[56:51] corazón hermano Álvaro viene hacia m
[56:56] también agarró mi
[56:58] mano y me dice te acuerdas ese espíritu
[57:00] santo que te
[57:02] hablé dice Ese es el espíritu
[57:05] santo y de ese momento ya me había
[57:10] ido y me dice solo sigue adorándole al
[57:14] Señor Dale toda la
[57:23] gloria
[57:25] el
[57:27] señor é abrá puertas para

[1:02:28] aquí pero tengo mi
[1:02:30] escritura pero todo lo que ellos dicen
[1:02:32] es
[1:02:37] verdad y estoy seguro que algunos de
[1:02:39] ustedes mis hermanos jóvenes y más
[1:02:45] ancianos Ustedes han tenido experiencia
[1:02:47] con el la presencia del
[1:02:50] Señor aunque sea el campamento en la
[1:02:53] iglesia
[1:02:55] orando dentro de su
[1:02:57] armario orando antes de una prueba en la
[1:03:03] escuela Dios ha manifestado de alguna
[1:03:05] manera en cada una de sus
[1:03:07] vidas pero yo soy un
[1:03:11] testigo y yo sé que Dios hace milagros
[1:03:14] en el
[1:03:18] campamento aú no sé si el campamento
[1:03:20] tiene un significado
[1:03:23] especial pero Soy Testigo de los
[1:03:25] milagros que ocurren en el
[1:03:29] campo solo quiero compartir un
[1:03:31] testimonio corto sobre mi sanidad en el
[1:03:34] campamento este campamento
[1:03:42] pasado antes del campamento Yo comencé a
[1:03:44] tener unos síntomas de casi una
[1:03:51] gripe y los síntomas comenzon a empeorar
[1:04:02] cuando turn de
[1:04:05] dirigir sent
[1:04:10] muir
[1:04:14] dirir lado del
[1:04:23] púlpito el arpa para
[1:04:27] elom y sentía aliviado después de que
[1:04:31] David le
[1:04:37] tocara y le dije a Dios Yo en mi propia
[1:04:42] mente le dije Señor por favor déjame ser
[1:04:44] David en esta
[1:04:47] noche déjame cantar estos cantos para
[1:04:51] ti para la sanidad comrar dentro de m
[1:04:56] Entonces fui
[1:04:59] allá subí Y di todo allí
[1:05:04] arriba y ven cuando ustedes le den
[1:05:07] servicio a
[1:05:08] Dios Tienen que darle sus
[1:05:13] todo aunque usted orando lo que sea por
[1:05:16] su
[1:05:17] libertad si usted va a orar ore con todo
[1:05:21] su
[1:05:23] corazón si va a danzar en el espíritu
[1:05:25] por
[1:05:26] Dios que sea con todo su corazón y dele
[1:05:30] su
[1:05:33] todo y sigió el campamento entonces y
[1:05:35] pasó eso y ya me sentí un poco
[1:05:38] mejor pero sabe como el
[1:05:43] es él no quiere que usted sea
[1:05:48] libre entonces me dio una doble
[1:05:53] porción
[1:05:56] Entonces yo me acordé de mi hermano
[1:06:01] Pepe é tomó mi
[1:06:05] temperatura y mi temperatura fue 109
[1:06:09] gr Y eso es muy
[1:06:13] malo no soy un doctor Pero yo sé que es
[1:06:18] malo verdaderamente no me sentía muy
[1:06:20] bien en esa
[1:06:23] noche noche
[1:06:25] tuvimos compañerismo en la
[1:06:31] fogata y fue el tiempo para que yo y
[1:06:33] Pepe fuéramos al área y preparar
[1:06:39] todo y entonces hicimos todo el trabajo
[1:06:41] de
[1:06:44] preparación y yo no me quería
[1:06:47] ir porque yo sé cómo se pone en la
[1:06:51] fogata y pero me habían pedido por faor
[1:06:55] a
[1:06:56] desc entonces Fu así moviendo mis pies
[1:07:00] así hacia mi cabaña y me fui a dormir la
[1:07:04] siguiente
[1:07:06] mañana la misma cosa no me sentía bien
[1:07:09] para
[1:07:11] nada pero llegó el domingo por la
[1:07:15] noche y el servicio estuvo
[1:07:21] tremendo los
[1:07:27] actividades y fue una bendición
[1:07:30] grande hubieron gente que hicieron
[1:07:33] videos otros grupos que hicieron
[1:07:36] dramas
[1:07:38] y
[1:07:42] noticias y habían diferentes
[1:07:48] actividades Pero mis síntomas no me
[1:07:50] dejaban ser
[1:07:52] libre y tenía una sudadera pesada encima
[1:07:57] de mí porque estaba muy frío
[1:08:02] yo pero después de que el segundo equipo
[1:08:05] subió estaba hablando yo en mi
[1:08:09] cabeza Y usted cree que es
[1:08:14] libre Él me dijo eso yo le dije Sí yo lo
[1:08:18] creo y luego é me dijo Pruébalo
[1:08:22] entonces
[1:08:24] Y entonces ese pensamiento se
[1:08:27] fue y dije Bueno entonces cómo puedo
[1:08:30] probar yo que soy libre Cómo puedo
[1:08:32] probar que he sido
[1:08:34] sanado entonces la primera cosa que
[1:08:37] hice es que me quité esa chaqueta esa
[1:08:40] sudadera
[1:08:41] pesada y hermano munive me
[1:08:44] preguntó estás bien te sientes
[1:08:48] bien y en mi mente decía bueno tienes
[1:08:51] todos los
[1:08:52] síntomas
[1:08:54] pero desde mi corazón Yo le decía Sí
[1:08:57] estoy
[1:08:58] bien estaré
[1:09:00] bien el señor conoce todas las cosas Ese
[1:09:04] fue mi respuesta para el hermano
[1:09:08] mun y unos hermanos más vinieron hacia
[1:09:11] mí porque no me veía tamban bien
[1:09:14] yo pero yo me quedé con mi
[1:09:18] bendición porque Dios me dio mi
[1:09:20] bendición esa ese viernes por la noche
[1:09:24] me dio mi sanidad el viernes por la
[1:09:28] noche pero el no quería que yo lo
[1:09:35] aceptara entonces después de que después
[1:09:38] de que antes de que el servicio iba a
[1:09:42] cerrar fue mi turno de subir de nuevo a
[1:09:50] dirigir y yo quería cantar un canto que
[1:09:54] con el cual yo me identifico
[1:09:58] mucho y aquellos que estuvieron ahí el
[1:10:00] domingo por la noche supieron lo que
[1:10:05] pasó el espíritu santo solo
[1:10:11] derramó usted podía ver la
[1:10:13] gente la gente brincar hacia arriba de
[1:10:16] sus
[1:10:17] sillas gente en el
[1:10:21] altar y los músicos
[1:10:27] y fue un jubileo allí
[1:10:30] adentro y de repente Yo comencé a cantar
[1:10:34] la fiesta de los vencedores comencé a
[1:10:35] cantar la fiesta de los
[1:10:38] vencedores y es ese canto tocó mi
[1:10:42] corazón y comencé a cantar y alabar al
[1:10:49] Señor y cantamos yo creo ese canto por
[1:10:51] unos 45 minutos
[1:10:56] derecho pero no podíamos parar no me
[1:10:59] podía detener de alabarle
[1:11:02] a Pero cuando menos me lo
[1:11:06] esperaba todos los síntomas ya se habían
[1:11:10] ido yo no sabía lo que
[1:11:13] pasó pero
[1:11:18] pasó no sé có Dios sacó todo fuera de mí
[1:11:23] pero si
[1:11:26] ocurrió pero después de que el servicio
[1:11:29] fue
[1:11:30] despedido fuimos hacia la
[1:11:35] fogata pero en ese momento no me había
[1:11:37] dado cuenta que ya fui
[1:11:41] sanado no fue hasta que llegué hacia la
[1:11:44] fogata y al hermano
[1:11:47] mun y él me preguntó de nuevo estás bien
[1:11:50] te ves
[1:11:52] diferente
[1:11:56] y él me dijo tú recibiste tu sanidad all
[1:12:01] adentro y en ese momento así me
[1:12:06] pegó no me di
[1:12:10] cuenta porque Dios es tan
[1:12:15] grande ni podemos
[1:12:17] rasgar el lugar de cu grande él
[1:12:22] es
[1:12:25] pero un milagro grande ocurrió en mi
[1:12:27] vida en esa
[1:12:31] noche nunca había tenido experiencia yo
[1:12:34] de sanidad divina en mí
[1:12:38] mismo y aunque los síntomas me
[1:12:43] pegaron yo creo que mi fe en
[1:12:47] Dios fue lo cual echó fuera todos esos
[1:12:52] síntomas y la gente se dio
[1:12:56] cuenta la gente que me vio antes del
[1:12:58] campamento me habían visto con esos
[1:13:01] síntomas y se dieron
[1:13:04] cuenta grande pudo ser esa
[1:13:08] enfermedad pero al lado de todo eso yo
[1:13:10] estaba ahí en la
[1:13:14] brecha solo haciendo la obra que Dios
[1:13:17] necesitaba que fuera
[1:13:21] hecha y estoy gozoso que no me di por
[1:13:26] vencido Porque después del
[1:13:28] campamento tú ves todas las
[1:13:32] bendiciones yo me acuerdo nuestra
[1:13:34] hermana samera se
[1:13:40] bautizó si pequeñitos pueden tener
