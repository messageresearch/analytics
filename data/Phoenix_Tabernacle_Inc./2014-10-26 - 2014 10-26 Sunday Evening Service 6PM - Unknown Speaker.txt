put both the will to do and the uh Power and the strength to do something it's you working on both ends Lord remember when he speaks about the little boy and the that would eat pedals off a bicycle and the little Erasers on a pencil just because it had rubber in there and the rubber had so for Lord and the and his body he was he wasn't a genius the little boy was not a chemist he didn't know what was in the chemistry of the rubber but he knew that if he ate those things that that that his body was craving for that Lord and we can explain it maybe theologically what what we want but we know we want more of you Lord and we thank you Lord that for that desire that thirst Lord that you have put in there as you said on the great day of the feast you said you stood up and shouted Lord

okay we uh what I like to uh uh say first of all so you know what's going on the service is not for everybody did you understand that this service tonight is not for everybody I hope we can tuned up also here I believe brother Billy Paul came here one time and he gave a testimony and I don't know if I was in uh Yuma or in my own missionary trip or whatever it was that we do and when I when I um when I realized he had been here and I didn't hear him I felt very very badly yeah so enough said right [Music] [Music] all I'm I'm speaking to you from my heart uh we were working uh doing demolition I love demolition to tear down things tear taken down the house and uh we we God bless and we ended up doing U with my brother-in-law took the job and I thought we were GNA do tearing down the drywall well this house didn't have drywall it had uh 3/4 inch concrete on it that the the old-timers that we used to do it those of you that know about it and they had the chicken wire and stuff and then plywood also and and and and our hands hurt so I was going to make an excuse I was going to cop out cuz my hands were hurting but that's [Music] okay Lord [Music] God bless you sister Bonnie I was born that way wired up like that it's hard sister Joanne like we try to do our best and I was going to cop out because no I I have to have I'm a perfectionist believe it or not and I didn't cop out but I do everything for the honor and the glory of God as we said when we started when I came in it's not for everybody tonight is not for everybody it's only for you guys okay did you understand Billy Paul had come here made a test test gave a testimony I wasn't here it wasn't for me the other night we watched it on the YouTube brother ston put it on there on his phone and I was just I was glued to his testimony Emilio comes over my wife didn't came over I'm not going to tell you where they were at you know and everybody was just just Frozen to what brother Billy Paul was doing we believe the message of the hour we believe that brother random was a man sent from God we believe that brother Bernie was also a man sent from God he's our pastor and I'm thankful for that I can never call Brother Bernie Garcia I have maybe in yesterday year to call him my uncle I cannot call him my uncle although he is my uncle I always call him brother berning okay let you read between the lines okay brother Holly this Bible is for you brother Ernie it's for you it's also for me this Bible is for each and every one of us amen you know if we're here this this evening to magnify God to worship God we believe that this Bible tells you what to do how to get along in life we already we know that we know that we should follow the word of God it tells us how get guess what young people it tells us how to look for a boyfriend and who to marry what qualities you must have same girls girls when you're at that age that you're looking that you want to marry someone because in the beginning God when he created man he created him male and female created he them both there's one prayer for each okay okay okay that's Genesis 127 you can read it there at home if you'd like to but what I'm trying to say this Bible is a written word of God not this particular Bible now don't go try to steal my Bible okay not this particular Bible but your Bible is a written word of God it's God's thoughts expressed put on print form and he sent a prophet in our age to tell us how to get in line how to come back to him how to because we are a church we are called out how many you been called out I'm not talking about fighting you know when they call you out let's get on we're going to fight I don't like your looks I just don't like you no I'm not talking about that this Bible is also a special book it's a book of History yes if you you know that the the judges have the Ten Commandments What one time they used to do it okay they used to have I I'm I'm getting too loose now okay I better shut up right there no I'll give it to you okay yeah come on when I work with the amopa county sher's department I remember taking people down to the uh where they needed to go in upside of seven right anyway they would I would take him to the the polygraph of whatever I would end up there with a judge and I'm I'm not going to tell you his name that that'll cover me and uh he'd reach in pull his drawer cuz he has a lot of pressure judges have a lot of pressure so do doctors and Engineers lawyers and and Christians have a lot of pressure too don't we have a lot of pressure anyway he opened the door and had a little bottle there and we opened it up and he fixed himself up and uh he looks at me with no so anyway we have a lot of pressure where am I going with this just follow what I'm saying okay the Bible is a special book and it is written for a special people okay the Bible contains the thoughts of God in print the Bible is is a special because it's inspired it's the inspired word of God in letter form to a special population amen okay this special population I believe it's the bride of Christ how many of you believe there's a bride man wow okay wow and and you know I I when I come to the weddings I I look at these ladies that we there fix themselves up they're beautiful you know they're really beautiful very very very beautiful they just look that white Veil and the white dress they just look beautiful it's nothing like a wedding at one time I didn't think that way but that's okay you know we all have problems you know for the bride of Christ is a special person okay she is a lady she's not a woman although she is a woman she is a woman that's been called out male and female we've been called out from The Honky Tonk from we've been called out from the churches we've been called out from the pews or wherever you were at right you have been called to walk like a lady you've been called to act like a lady to speak like a lady to work like a lady you know a lady there's a big difference between a woman and a lady a woman will walk you know yes maybe she doesn't know who she's maybe she's from lavario you know you know what I'm talking about right but a lady she she She carries herself not hoty not high- minded but she's a lady even her stride she walks with Grace because she's been blessed by Grace The Amazing Grace amen first man that was created he was a spirit man how many of you know that Genesis 1 you can read it there if as your homework if you want okay he was a spirit man and then he cre in him in God himself when he created him in the image he had attributes he was a shadai he was a breasted one he was a female also I'm getting into some hot water but that's okay it'll come to me but he was a man man he was a dual purpose man and you have a purpose and you are to walk like a lady okay how many of you believe that okay if you don't believe that's okay you you don't have to believe believe everything I say okay but if it's the word if you find it say you can say Amen okay that's good that's okay Man's first parent was help me St who was Man's first parent who are you serious oh god wow Papa God was the parent God himself was our parent but Adam fell and we lost everything because of him I know the serpent we leave the alone okay we'll leave it alone could you shut that door for me please you know I used to work in a prison I'm very particular you know it's just you I I'm trying to lose all those bad things I I I yes yes okay I'm not going to give anybody a ticket here but that you know uh but okay see I got your attention that's all I wanted to do by the way how many of you know the song that I play St did you know say okay I think uh the sister from Tucson when you went over there sister you remember that song I played uh okay yeah that's okay if you don't know who I'm talking to but you know that's the one I played Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Christ is Our Redeemer amen Jesus Christ came to redeem us and he died on the cross I hope you know that okay those of you and be before I get into to some stuff here we're going to be praying for your people so those of you that want to be prayed fine if not you don't want to be prayed for fine that okay amen and we have Elders that they going to lay hands on you if you have if you're sick from your soul from your body from your spirit from your mind you got cancer you got diabetes if you got diabetes God can heal you too right how many of you know that you know that diabetes and here I go okay okay diabetes is this is a silent killer diabetes is a silent killer and it's come in and ebed itself into the church it's a silent killer Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jesus is real what you talking about okay that's that's enough right that's enough you you we understand that there's that spiritual diabetes also we know that the natural types of spiritual and God showed us and we know that because of brother brandham a man sent from God brother brandham God when he sent this man I want to tell you that if it wasn't for him I would not be here and if I wouldn't be here that guy wouldn't be here and this guy wouldn't be here my daddy was dying of cancer he was spit in Blood and he was spit in Blood and he was a minister already I don't know why he spit in blood he had cancer I don't know if he was a smoker whatever kind of whatever anyway that's the way it was but as a minister 40 in 1948 here he is here in Phoenix Arizona he's spitting blood doctor says you're going to die that's all understood you're going to die he goes to brother Bam's Miss uh uh meeting he says uh I'm going to pray for the ministers tonight he takes his hand and say you you you you you have uh cancer no you had cancer what what what faith you have Daddy goes to the to the bathroom later on no blood it's gone it's over that's the kind of God that I look back now I look back because I was lost lost as can be with no Direction with no God not knowing what to do but then one day in God's mercy sent a man by the name of Bernie Garcia he says I'm going to start a church I'm going to do this and I started there going to church and I started hearing the word then I heard you must be born again and from that time one day there in 1981 Joanna was playing the piano there I walked in and I was going to lay the law down to those deacons that just don't obey they just don't obey and that's just the way it is brother it just it the beat goes on but that's me brother that's BR okay you forgive brother Alex okay but it's not for everybody okay so I'm there and and I go down lord what is it I say I don't need no altar boom I go to the altar something happened boom We baptized me with the Holy Spirit I says God is real God is real you mean that God that my daddy preached about you mean oh oh I remember with my daddy when he used to go to places and he would call the people you have this and you have this and I would be over there with my guitar Oh Daddy don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it the girls are going to watch it cuz I'm playing the guitar don't miss it I'm going to be embarrassed what a Preposterous thing that's ridiculous but God was with that man and the reason he was that man the reason he was that man because God's man prayed for him he believed in that man he saw that man the effects came in he's now healed liberated from cancer and I'm thankful for that four years old I was four years old then you know I I can't help but go to that test Tony because it's not for everybody but it's for you bride of Christ amen that's what brother bam has means to us and as the years go by I remember brother oampo we ended up in Mexico sometimes in a missionary T brother brother was there and you know we Christians are kind of we're too religious I I was well I still am you need some religion okay but what I'm trying to say we were too religious brother you know and we're there we had that little television on and and then then we started watching boxing and I started moving I started moving and my brother-in-law Lupe Rosales was the boxer and he taught me how to fight a little bit so so I thought I was boxing and then we all put our Bibles down and then brother stops watching it he goes and I started laughing I couldn't get up cuz I really enjoyed that so anyway I was mocking brother H this your body having a good time and we're having a good time I go to the boys and I said look brother compo so that night I go to bed and I don't know who may brother Ernie was there brother Malya I slept in my bed and here I am real religious I'm going to read my Bible one of these Bibles Thomas chain that's a heavy one okay heavy duty Bible so here I am and I fell asleep boom I got hit by the Bible right in my face how many of you following me this lady which you are a lady which the Church of Jesus Christ she's not just an ordinary lady she's not an ordinary lady she's not mediocre no she whatever she does she does it her best she goes to church on time she gives her ties to the church she places her her allegiance to Jesus Christ and she's has her allegiance to the church also wow heavy duty h brother brother B talks about that but that's okay you know if if it if it hurts that's ouch it's okay you know but she is not mediocre she is not ordinary she's not just ordinary moderate quality you know the the I went to the dictionary and it says to be mediocre is to be neither bad nor good a person that never takes a stand wow you know that's okay okay here it goes so I'm in the police academy there's 20 there I think the class 126 if you check it out on the internet okay fine maybe you'll see me over there but anyway we're class 126 and we're there we're playing ball and we we started rotating and then the the they didn't want to rotate they didn't want to they they didn't want to play with the by the rules okay so we're there and and uh brother Alex ends up serving and he served real good boom boom they brother Alex just stay there stay there Alex we we just stay there we we the big guys six foot guys we'll stay up here I said uh uh-uh we must be equal equal anyway they didn't want to do it I said oh here's your ball then threw right to them I says oh I lost my job that's what I thought I lost my job but when I believe something brother I hang on to it it says I didn't play no card that well because of this no n n come on baloney anyway that and and that was it okay Papa God he was the parent of Adam I believe that Papa God is my god do you believe he's your God okay this woman this lady she worships the Lord like you sang today I like that that was good maybe it's because the oldtime songs brings back memories you know it was very good but to be mediocre means what it really means is you're rather poor you're inferior and your common place that's a dictionary I'm going to put this away cuz it's ugly I want to deal with that but God gave us he led Israel as I start to close okay I'm taking too long I wish I hadn't done that I start to we know that the pillar of fire led the prophet Moses and His People Israel we know that that Pillar of Fire kept on walking and when the job was done years later come and there was another Pillar of Fire and he poured himself into Jesus Christ that Pillar of Fire that was over back Yonder came and poured himself into Jesus Christ the whole yes shooting match if I can say it that way into Jesus Christ and then Jesus Christ died on the cross came back resurrected and he sent back the Holy Spirit yes he sent back the Holy Spirit and when he sent back the Holy Spirit he he's poured himself back then in the day of Pentecost himself fully into the church and he divided himself want to be an apostle want to be a prophet

that letter that brother Brandon would send out with every uh prayer cloth he would send out and in that and in that letter it says the following 3/4 of the way down brother Bram says this not to not I'm not just saying about tonight I'm saying about from today forward from today forward brother B says this It quotes Revelations 12:13 he says and they overcame the dragon by their testimony and the blood of the Lamb did you hear what I said your testimony many times the Lord does things for us and we shut up we keep it to ourselves it's like a private the thank you Lord I know you he me he said they overcame the dragon by their testimony and the blood of the lamb and the prophet said that when you're healed when you hand out these prayer CLS said when you're healed write to us and tell us give us your testimony because is because he said that re Gans 12:3 says and they have overcame the dragon by their testimony and the blood of the Lamb I know you don't get it but that's okay I'm not expecting anybody to be jumping y screaming yelling shouting go home and read [Music] it you think it's easy to fight those demons they're not going to give up that fourth dimension easily it's going to going to be a battle you're going to have to have some real spiritual Kung [Music] Fu Hall you understand what I'm saying they're not going to give it up easily just one of those demons held up Gabriel is that right how many the ministers know that Gabriel as soon as Daniel started fasting and praying and asking God the moment his he his knees hit the ground I believe God said Gabriel go but it took him 21 days to get there why spirit this is the King of Persia let's let's let's make it modern the king of Iran that evil spirit that's now was over Iran Persia at that time with stod Gabriel 21 days says it was not until Michael okay tag team wrestling Michael had to come in and then start fighting with him Dan Gabriel was let loose H is that right Gabriel was then leted loose so he could come and bring the message to Daniel then he gave the message okay first purpose second purpose third purpose fourth and now uh greatly beloved I know I got to go because Michael's in the fix right now but right we're r on World War [Music] II about 200 million demons were let loose they've been reserved why do this problems have to me what is this happened to me there's 200 demons been let

I will he that's either the truth or it's a lie that's it that's that simple and brother bam I I'm still looking for that quote I heard one brother B said one time he says that something along the lines say that that brother B said he it was he was like stying in his mind he says I cannot understand how it is that the Creator can be disbelieved by the creation and I'll kind of paraphrase it like this why do we believe the liar and disbelieve the truth and he said I am the way the truth and the life I am the way the truth and the life I don't know where to go brother brother bam gave us a very simple prescription he said keep your mind on Christ and your eyes on Calvary and you got to come out right that's it simple it's a simple recipe mind on Christ eyes on Calvary that's it about

one that leads the sheep sheep just where do we go now just okay let's pray thank you Father for everything that you've done for us Lord thank you for your word that you say you'll never leave us nor
