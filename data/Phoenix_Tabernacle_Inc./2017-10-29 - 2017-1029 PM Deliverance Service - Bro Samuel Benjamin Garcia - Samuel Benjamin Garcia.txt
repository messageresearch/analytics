day I'll go meet her and he works on me were stuck here overnight Romeo and he says this needs to change he may say esto tiene que cambia you need to work on this tienes que trabajar en esto you need to work on that hairiness Torah as a child like a baby would like a baby would come ooon in your goomah yeah he cries out he'll clamor oh yeah signore you know there's only one way a baby's gonna get what he was what he wants so let me tell you nominate I came a bit up then I look again and that's to cry out yes you're a dick come on you know it comes in three different ways right not a shout and this you know grito Amen but the one that stood out to me was shout okay Mira Mesa don't when it when it comes out of your heart when the salad - karai so on yeah we sometimes as baby that's what we need to do you know them over there so this is a look at necesitamos I said I realize what we're at the girls have done this time and then and then you know once we realized what we're at he couldn't record when it comes down here and he baptizes you and then you start to grow on that he sees a crescendo you start to grow in that I guess what you're just going up the road there will be no Camino then that compound meaning of the word it comes back again and here we are again as bigs come over this and we need milk again inna see some to know let's change and then we go on again burst into this birth into that there we go again milk again see that you were crying out what's going on que pasa wait that's that's the way he works kiddo I know Peter you know the moment that we feel that we're somebody ed momento keep it's a mosquito or someone something solid regardless if you're born again or not seen as he said no no hopefully it's why you're born again yeah I mean that's not busted to know that God just he humbles us in such a way that money brings trials and tribulation to her seriously brother so that we may grow vamos a role in what's gonna sitting unto perfection myself perfection and then we cry he cry mama and we want milk and we go into the word we go into El Shaddai you got massage today we nurture from him and then we grow Samos and then we and then once again were birthed into this and this goes on for who knows how long yes to see to the last day that we're here on earth so we finally go on to that the place we're across Jordan a man what become someone said : I mean first Peter 1:17 says let's stop going back to the traditions of our fathers whom by we received by vain conversation record ASIMO's in common banner for as much as you know that we were not redeemed by those corruptible things I want to have enough women dirty needles police escorting people but with the precious blood of Christ sina pona sang the praises of a lamb come with him called a without blemish she mentioned and without spot and what did that lamb do that perfect wise that virgin born he was a one who come and took the toxin well give me 50 now and banana in 1960 he says brother Benno's says on the bank of jordan and every other course he was inoculated when the heavens were opened oh she have really lost you know and the Spirit of God come down to 12 so God was made flesh she can just wait okay and well - manga see more if you take the toxin upon himself at automatic but see me say what is the toxin it's God's bone that's god's toxin Holy Ghost and it speaks of something we all this this week as III I can understand what toxin meant it's the same element Anila be seen if it seems like such a bad thing okay you know in your body you have toxins see any stuck seen us into what you want to get rid of it but I see this kid is so then why do you why is this a this for this food kitty says so I looked up toxin I seek it's a poisonous substance that is produced by a living thing as soon as substance yeah when you know sakis bluesy opponent said Vivian I said the living being the only one living thing so let me tell you said Vivian God is the only in Luke 1:35 says therefore also and don't study in that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God a motherly qualities so then III was looking at that that definition of poisonous substance mean I rather they see one day what is poisonous because excuse me no sir it's causing sickness or death by entering the body it's comes out in 5 min I don't want Ellen throw I'll quit God wants us to take this he just get a keeper man she wants this and in us and he wants to cause sickness or death Jericho said if it man by entering into the body I don't get it Laurel and diello senior but God's toxin kills the carnality kills the natural method of doctrine it kills the body it kills the desire of the flesh in the cell that academy romans 8 10 and if christ being you the body is dead and queer push them away because of sin a council in picado but the spirit is life muscle disbelieving because of righteousness are they like Justicia you know when when Jesus was walking on those banks well okay who's got me nervous over John screamed out he quite behold the lamb of God I have me being baptized of you yo necesito say about these other proteins is John he who I'm you know it we gotta fulfill all righteousness a name was completely iced teas he understood Ellington do but the spirit is life better to speak towards me that because of righteousness I can say la Justicia and that's what we should desire yes oh look at the very emotional desires the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead the Sierra dispute to their care Caleb and others what they may dwell on earth Saturday morning so true so that we to Eric a nosotros también can be quickened whether most ability cards are more mortal bodies in a secure pose more tallies quick and when we can squander you know he's already given us the down payment Bennigan's of the oil deposit oh well in Gansu you know I started off with saying I started off with same SADC end up is it I don't um I don't understand why I'm here no entiendo porque estoy aqui it's like no God saw me walking it's come on kiss me maybe Oh kevie net and he says you know what he hosts I be scared he probably had a grin on his on his face he says it's that house under him and please identify what this story is not just about me okay so even if you say so dear no se trata de me as he saw me walk in the street see confirming with Mia and that would ask I use I said I got a good one for these guys yet thinking when I went up erase those cameras I'm gonna pick them up your way element and I'm gonna wash him either way like God and I'm gonna cleanse them heal away yes and I'm gonna put him away for service steal away about that but I said vco how many can can identify with it - I'm disappointing active
