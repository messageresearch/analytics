[22:38] bless you I have a poem to give to you
[22:41] this evening um and I pray that it be a
[22:44] blessing to
[22:46] you in the year 1846 a group of 89
[22:50] immigrants embarked on a journey from
[22:52] Springfield Illinois to travel West the
[22:56] hope of a shorter route through
[22:57] California granted a promising Journey
[23:01] as they were traveling through the
[23:02] Sierra Nevada mountains they became
[23:04] blocked in by a heavy
[23:06] snowfall their bodies frozen stiff
[23:10] fingers and toes ridden with frostbite
[23:13] their stomachs shrinking and
[23:15] hunger they began to eat the saddle and
[23:18] the leather of their belts in order to
[23:21] survive they eventually resorted to
[23:24] cannibalism only 45 of the original 89
[23:28] survived
[23:28] D our Prophet is said that when people
[23:32] are hungry they will eat from anywhere
[23:36] when people are hungry they will scr
[23:39] through back alley dumpsters for cold
[23:41] leftovers when people are hungry they
[23:44] will drag the rotting carcass of a cat
[23:47] or dog or coyote from the side of the
[23:49] road and pick its crushed bones clean
[23:52] when people are hungry they will push
[23:55] shove pull kill for the small smallest
[23:59] of
[24:00] crumbs and crumbs will only satisfy the
[24:04] soul of the spiritually starved for so
[24:06] long before you become all gunte eyed
[24:09] and Bloated belly again believe me I
[24:12] know before you become knees unwilling
[24:15] to bend in prayer believe me I know
[24:18] before you become feet running to
[24:21] cunning smiles and empty words to cold
[24:24] arms and even colder Hearts to bottoms
[24:27] of bottles and Sky Highs to acceptance
[24:30] from everyone but the very God who has
[24:33] seen your every fault and fall and fall
[24:37] and fall and still loves you believe me
[24:41] I know when people are hungry they will
[24:45] eat from
[24:47] anywhere stop searching in all the voids
[24:52] in all of that empty stretch out your
[24:56] bony fingers and remember Psalm
[25:00] 8110 for I the Lord am your God who
[25:05] brought you up from the land of
[25:08] Egypt open wide your mouth and I will
[25:12] fill it
[25:15] [Applause]

[25:59] exerts sequential exerts in the series
[26:02] Supernatural the life of William
[26:04] brandham uh as it might it's been a bit
[26:07] of time since we did the last exert so
[26:08] I'll just catch you up on where we are
[26:10] um brother Brandon had returned back
[26:13] home with from the Mishawaka uh visit
[26:17] and he was so excited and wanted to heed
[26:20] the Lord's call to continue his
[26:23] campaign uh and start uh visiting the
[26:26] churches he had gotten invitations to
[26:28] and he listened to his mother-in-law's
[26:32] pleading not to do so so we're going to
[26:35] pick up the second half of chapter
[26:38] 19 a black curtain
[26:45] Falls a glen of sunlight flashed across
[26:48] Bill's life when his daughter was born
[26:50] on October 27th
[26:52] 1936 they named her Sharon Rose an
[26:56] inversion of the rose of cheron
[26:59] one of the poetic titles of Jesus Christ
[27:02] Sharon Rose was a beautiful baby and
[27:04] Bill loved her more than he loved the
[27:06] warm sun on a clear fall day he didn't
[27:09] know that Sharon's birth would be the
[27:11] last Ray of Happiness to touch him for
[27:13] many
[27:14] years the dark clouds began to gather in
[27:18] November first Bill's sister-in-law died
[27:21] then one of his brothers was
[27:23] killed 17-year-old Charles Edward
[27:26] Branham Jr one one Sunday night Charles
[27:29] hitched a ride on the running board
[27:31] outside of a car driven by a drunk the
[27:34] car sideswiped a power pole scraping
[27:37] Charlie off breaking his neck bill was
[27:40] preaching in the church at the at the
[27:42] time another one of his brothers brought
[27:44] him the news immediately Bill dismissed
[27:48] the service but by the time he reached
[27:50] the hospital his brother Charlie was
[27:53] already
[27:54] dead young Charlie's death powerfully
[27:57] affected Bill's father still broken in
[28:00] health and desperately poor Charles
[28:02] brandham senior reflected on his life
[28:04] both his past and his future one morning
[28:08] Bill saw him sitting on the v-neck of a
[28:10] plow crying Bill asked what's the matter
[28:15] dad you won't understand Billy but
[28:18] someday you will I want to see the old
[28:21] home place again I'm 52 years old and I
[28:24] haven't been back there for almost 25
[28:26] years
[28:28] if you want to go back there Dad I'll
[28:30] give you the money to go for one last
[28:33] time Charles visited the place near
[28:35] burkville Kentucky where he was born
[28:38] when he returned to Jeffersonville he
[28:40] sat in a in a saloon thinking about how
[28:43] he had sabotaged his life with alcohol a
[28:46] man offered to buy him a drink feeling
[28:49] guilty but unable to stop himself he
[28:53] accepted as the light brown liquid
[28:55] filled the glass Charles said look fell
[28:58] I got a boy standing over there in a
[29:00] Pulpit
[29:03] tonight that boy's right and I'm
[29:06] wrong don't let this drink effect on my
[29:09] reflect on my boy when he bought brought
[29:13] the shot glass to his lips his hand
[29:15] shook so hard that most of the whiskey
[29:17] spilled on his chin the men teased him
[29:20] Charles broke down and cried picking up
[29:23] his hat he walked out 2 weeks later on
[29:26] November 30th 193 6 Charles brandham
[29:29] suffered a massive heart attack he was
[29:32] still alive when Bill reached his
[29:34] bedside Bill cradled his father's head
[29:37] in his arms those curly black locks were
[29:40] just beginning to turn gray at the
[29:42] temples Bill thought I helped put those
[29:45] gray hairs there how many heartaches
[29:48] have I caused him he looked at his
[29:50] father's hand missing a finger from a
[29:54] shredder accident and he thought of how
[29:56] hard this man had worked to rais his 10
[29:59] children Bill didn't care what anyone
[30:01] else thought about Charles Branham this
[30:04] man was his father and he loved him
[30:06] Charles looked up into his oldest son's
[30:09] eyes Billy he whispered I've been wrong
[30:13] Daddy it's not too late to change right
[30:16] there by his father's deathbed Bill led
[30:18] him to the Lord of all life Jesus Christ
[30:22] within an hour Charles Branham went to
[30:24] meet his maker at that moment Bill saw
[30:28] white robed angel standing in front of
[30:30] him through his grief bill at least knew
[30:33] his father's Soul was Secure in
[30:36] Christ the next Misfortune began a week
[30:39] before Christmas when both of Bill's
[30:40] children came down with colds soon hoped
[30:43] sniffed and coughed along with them the
[30:45] temperature outside dropped below zero
[30:48] hope laid blankets at the base of the
[30:51] doors and towels along the window sills
[30:54] to cut down dri drafts it helped a
[30:57] little but because the home had so
[30:59] little insulation the kitchen stove had
[31:01] trouble keeping the two rooms
[31:03] warm in 1936 Christmas fell on a Friday
[31:07] the day before Christmas Hope went with
[31:09] a friend across the river to Louisville
[31:11] Kentucky to buy some last minute
[31:13] presents for the children Bill reported
[31:16] to work as usual on his noon break he
[31:20] opened a savings account for Sharon Rose
[31:23] putting in 80 cents his Christmas
[31:25] present for his two-month-old daughter
[31:28] next he dropped a Christmas present off
[31:30] at the office of his Boyhood buddy Sam
[31:32] madir who had just recently returned
[31:34] from medical school to open a private
[31:36] practice in
[31:37] Jeffersonville later that afternoon Bill
[31:40] got an urgent call while shopping in
[31:42] Louisville hope had fainted on the
[31:45] street now she was at home in bed
[31:48] desperately in need of his attention
[31:50] Bill rushed over and found Hope tightly
[31:52] bundled in blankets shivering
[31:55] uncontrollably he touched her forehead
[31:57] head her skin felt like it was on fire
[32:01] bill called Sam Adair who came right
[32:03] over Dr Adair slipped a thermometer
[32:05] under Hope's tongue putting his
[32:08] stethoscope against her chest he
[32:10] listened and frowned then he checked on
[32:13] the on the Mercury level oh my she's got
[32:15] a fever of
[32:17] 105° Bill this is serious she's got
[32:21] pneumonia you need to give her orange
[32:23] juice all night long make her drink at
[32:25] least two gallons tonight to break that
[32:27] f
[32:29] Bill Sat by Hope's bed throughout the
[32:31] night giving her a sip of orange juice
[32:33] every few minutes by Christmas morning
[32:36] her fever had dropped a few degrees Mrs
[32:39] brumbach stopped by to see her daughter
[32:41] and was appalled by the cool drafty room
[32:44] William this house is not equipped with
[32:46] heat enough to keep hope warm I'm going
[32:48] to take her to my house Bill said I'd
[32:51] rather ask Dr Adair if we should move
[32:54] her Adair I wouldn't ask him anything
[32:58] that boy doesn't have sense enough to
[33:00] come in out of the rain I'll get Dr
[33:02] Lawrence to look at her she
[33:06] left bill called Dr Adair who advised
[33:08] him Bill don't you move her if you take
[33:11] hope out in this freezing weather right
[33:13] now it will kill her but doctor her
[33:16] mother is going to do it anyhow then
[33:18] I'll get off the case bill I love you as
[33:21] a brother you know that but I can't be
[33:23] responsible for Hope under those
[33:25] conditions I'll have to turn hope over
[33:27] to Dr Lawrence well doc you know where
[33:30] my feelings
[33:35] are with his thoughts and turmoil Bill
[33:37] walked over to the church knelt and
[33:40] prayed Lord I love my wife please have
[33:44] mercy on her and heal her will you Lord
[33:48] Bill saw a black sheet falling in front
[33:50] of him like the curtain that ends a
[33:52] theatrical performance he gasp in horror
[33:55] at the vision then as he watched
[33:58] slate gray clouds blocked out the sun
[34:01] torrential rains pounded the countryside
[34:04] causing the Ohio River to swell until
[34:06] finally the dyes protecting
[34:07] Jeffersonville caved in flooding the
[34:10] lower parts of the city he saw a man
[34:13] come down from the sky with a ruler in
[34:15] his hand and a measure of water over
[34:19] Spring Street at 22 feet
[34:21] deep division troubled bill so far every
[34:25] Glimpse he had seen of the future had
[34:27] come true
[34:28] he shared the vision around T Town
[34:30] hoping that people would take notice he
[34:33] prepared and therefore lives could be
[34:36] saved those people he told either
[34:38] snickered chuckled or outright galed
[34:41] even some people in his own congregation
[34:44] were skeptical like elderly Jim weart
[34:47] who said Billy the worst flood we ever
[34:50] had was in 1884 and then there was only
[34:53] about 6 in of water over Spring
[34:55] Street Bill repeated division
[34:58] I saw a man come down from the skies
[35:00] take a ruler stick it there on Spring
[35:02] Street and say 22
[35:04] ft Jim weart scoffed Oh Billy you're
[35:08] just
[35:09] excited I'm not excited it is thus saith
[35:12] the Lord and what is more the same God
[35:15] that told me there will be a flood
[35:17] showed me a black curtain that has come
[35:19] between him and me something has
[35:21] separated us he doesn't hear me when I
[35:24] pray for my wife I'm worried that she
[35:27] might never come out of
[35:28] this God bless
[35:31] [Applause]
[35:46] you amen good
[35:48] evening God bless you all how many are
[35:51] happy to be here in the house of the
[35:54] Lord amen there's many other places that

[1:02:43] how about here come on boys let's have a
[1:02:45] seat come
[1:02:49] on let's have a seat
[1:02:52] so life was good obviously in Eden it
[1:02:55] was perfect the waterfalls the mountains
[1:02:59] and God even he even told us we could
[1:03:01] eat from any tree any plant that we
[1:03:03] wanted to but there was one tree the
[1:03:06] tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:03:09] and we could not eat from that tree but
[1:03:13] well well boys pretty much we we
[1:03:16] disobeyed God's word when he told us to
[1:03:20] not eat it and we did we ate of that
[1:03:24] fruit
[1:03:30] it's it's a hard story to tell children
[1:03:33] um you see the serpent was so wise
[1:03:38] and I just started listening to him and
[1:03:41] what he had to say and he told me that
[1:03:44] the fruit would make me wise and I
[1:03:47] started to listen to what the serpent
[1:03:49] had to say and didn't listen to what God
[1:03:51] had to say because that was what was
[1:03:53] going to protect me his word and
[1:03:56] I didn't believe God I believed The
[1:03:58] Serpent and I ate the fruit and
[1:04:01] everything changed
[1:04:03] and God should have killed me right in
[1:04:05] that moment
[1:04:08] and daddy didn't want another Eve cuz
[1:04:11] God could have made another
[1:04:13] Eve and he also ate the fruit and we
[1:04:17] both disobeyed God's
[1:04:20] word yeah boy so when we disobeyed God's
[1:04:24] word when we ate that fruit
[1:04:26] we felt naked we felt ashamed you know
[1:04:29] we we were scared we didn't know what to
[1:04:31] do and God you know God already knew
[1:04:33] what we had done and he became angry at
[1:04:36] us he he didn't want to talk to us he
[1:04:38] didn't want to fellowship with us but
[1:04:40] because we were we became dirty we
[1:04:42] became
[1:04:43] filthy and he he he couldn't he couldn't
[1:04:47] fellowship with us cuz if he did we
[1:04:49] would have died but he loved us so what
[1:04:52] he did he found a spotless lamb
[1:04:56] beautiful little baby lamb hadn't done
[1:04:59] anything wrong beautiful lamb white as
[1:05:02] snow he sacrificed that lamb that little
[1:05:04] lamb that perfect
[1:05:07] sacrifice so he killed the little lamb
[1:05:09] and he covered us with the skin of the
[1:05:12] Lamb so now God was able to fellowship
[1:05:15] with us now because now he didn't see us
[1:05:18] he saw the white lamb covering us
[1:05:20] beautiful lamb cuz God is Holy boys
[1:05:24] holy and we're dirty so if he came into
[1:05:27] contact with us something so holy holy
[1:05:30] holy holy we would die but he loved us
[1:05:33] so he covered us with the lamb skin and
[1:05:35] now he can fellowship with us because of
[1:05:38] that skin that spotless skin
[1:05:40] boys and that's pretty much you know

[1:10:38] he's he's building an alar too this is a
[1:10:42] very important part of the
[1:10:44] story see brother branam explains that
[1:10:48] when these two young men were building
[1:10:50] their
[1:10:51] altar Abel had a revelation in his heart
[1:10:57] that it had to be a
[1:10:59] lamb because God used the lamb the skin
[1:11:04] of the Lamb to cover his parents in the
[1:11:06] Garden of Eden after they fell so so he
[1:11:10] brought a couple sticks and made a
[1:11:11] simple little altar cuz God hides in
[1:11:14] Simplicity remember that repeat after me
[1:11:17] God hides in in
[1:11:21] Simplicity
[1:11:23] Simplicity but k
[1:11:26] he was so hyped up about making his
[1:11:29] altar look gorgeous and beautiful look
[1:11:32] he's got all the flowers from all his
[1:11:35] hard work and all the fruits of his
[1:11:38] labor and the
[1:11:40] stones he worked really really really
[1:11:43] hard in the field he was proud of that
[1:11:46] work so he spent
[1:11:49] hours and
[1:11:51] days and weeks and months putting
[1:11:55] together his altar to make it look
[1:11:58] gorgeous as beautiful as
[1:12:05] possible the final piece to my
[1:12:11] altar
[1:12:13] woo
