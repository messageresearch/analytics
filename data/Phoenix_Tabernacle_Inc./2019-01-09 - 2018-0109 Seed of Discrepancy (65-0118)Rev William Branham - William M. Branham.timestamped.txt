[4:49] please be seated see it's a pointer
[4:58] I have chosen tonight for a shark text
[5:17] or short reading the Lord willing to
[5:21] give us the context of it out of Saint
[5:23] Matthew 13:24 2:30 and then also I want
[5:28] to read from 36 to 40 just in a few
[5:31] moments
[5:32] now st. Matthews the 13th chapter and
[5:36] beginning with the 24th verse of the
[5:40] 13th chapter of Saint Matthew listen
[5:43] close to the reading of the word my
[5:46] words will fail but his will not another
[5:49] parable put he forth unto them saying
[5:51] the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
[5:54] which sowed good seed in his field but
[5:58] while he slept his enemy came and sowed
[6:01] tares among the wheat and went his way
[6:04] but when the blade's was sprung up and
[6:07] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[6:11] terriers also so the servant of the
[6:15] householder came and said unto Him sir
[6:17] did a sound not so good see to not feel
[6:21] from which then has it Terriers and he
[6:25] said unto them an enemy has done this
[6:27] and the servant said unto Him wilt thou
[6:32] then that we go gather them up but he
[6:37] said nay
[6:38] that's why you gather up the tares ye
[6:40] root up also the wheat with them let
[6:43] them both grow together until the
[6:46] harvest and in the time of the harvest
[6:49] I will send forth the Reapers gather ye
[6:52] together first the tares and bind
[6:54] damaged bundles to burn them but gather
[7:01] the wheat into the garner did you notice
[7:05] gather the Terriers first and bundle
[7:08] land now
[7:10] reading this there was something strange
[7:12] come to me while we're setting up on top
[7:16] of the Catalina Mountains the other
[7:18] night and prayer and then I thought
[7:21] where could I gather a word that I could
[7:26] use for this that I wanted to speak on
[7:28] tonight and I went down and found a word
[7:32] of discrepancy so I got the dictionary
[7:36] look what the word discrepancy means and
[7:40] it means it's a sewing discard are are
[7:44] being contrary as Webster says sowing a
[7:48] discord something different are be
[7:50] contrary to what's already been so I
[7:55] thought text tonight I call it the seed
[7:58] of discrepancy and trust that the Lord
[8:01] will bless his word now as we approach
[8:04] him and we also know he interpreted in
[8:09] verse 36 and and 243 how that this seed
[8:16] matured and while we're at it let's just
[8:18] read that also verse 36 now unto 43 and
[8:23] when Jesus had sent the multitude away
[8:25] he went into the house and his disciples
[8:28] came unto him saying declare unto us the
[8:31] parable of the tares of the field and he
[8:34] answered and said unto them he that
[8:36] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[8:40] and the field is the world the good seed
[8:44] are the children of the kingdom but the
[8:47] terriers are the children of the wicked
[8:49] one the enemy that sought them is the
[8:53] devil the harvest is the end of the
[8:56] world and the Reapers are the Angels as
[9:00] therefore the tares are gathered and
[9:03] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[9:05] end of this world the Son of man shall
[9:09] send forth his angels and they shall
[9:13] gather out of his kingdom all things
[9:16] that offend and them which do iniquity
[9:19] and shall cast them into a far
[9:23] the fired and there shall be weeping be
[9:27] wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall
[9:30] the righteous shine forth as the Sun in
[9:32] the kingdom of their father who has an
[9:36] ear let him hear that's Jesus given the
[9:40] interpretation of the parable himself
[9:43] therefore we know then what the
[9:46] interpretation means and now as we have
[9:51] approached this of this sowing of the
[9:53] seed and the reaping now he interprets
[9:57] it and then believed that Jesus was
[10:01] speaking this parable in his day but was
[10:04] meaning it to be at the end of the world
[10:08] or the end of the age which is this day
[10:10] and I believe this little text tonight
[10:13] is a very appropriate for the hour that
[10:17] we're living in because Jesus
[10:21] distinctly said here that the gathering
[10:24] would be at the end of this world that
[10:28] that's when the in would be the
[10:30] gathering of the wheat and also the
[10:33] gathering of the terriers and burning
[10:35] them and to take in the wheat into the
[10:38] kingdom and I believe it was this wave
[10:41] and another scripture leads me to
[10:43] believe this way I have written down
[10:44] here is Matthew 24:24 where it said that
[10:49] talked about this the seat the seat of
[10:52] discrepancy Jesus said that the two
[10:55] would be so close together two it would
[10:57] deceive the very elect it if it were
[11:00] possible almost exactly the same another
[11:04] place in the scripture where it's
[11:06] written that the rain falls on the just
[11:08] and the unjust I remember my first
[11:12] experience of ever coming amongst the
[11:13] Pentecostal people as at Mishawaka
[11:16] Indiana and I was at a great convention
[11:19] hall about like this where the north and
[11:22] the south had come together because of
[11:24] them days of the segregation they had to
[11:26] meet up there they were too great orders
[11:29] of the Pentecostal brethren I had never
[11:31] heard of them are met them before the
[11:34] first time I ever heard speaking in
[11:37] and at the end of the row of the
[11:39] condition me being not a member among
[11:42] them is the young Baptist minister I set
[11:44] way back in the bank and I remember the
[11:48] first time I heard anyone speaking tones
[11:50] I didn't even know what what was all
[11:52] about and then these two men mainly set
[11:56] up in the front one would speak in
[11:59] tongues and the other would interpret
[12:01] what the man said well I just started
[12:03] studying my Bible as hard as I could
[12:05] there then and found out that that was
[12:07] scriptural that's exactly what the
[12:10] scripture the Holy Spirit would do well
[12:12] about a day after that that night my
[12:15] heart was so stirred a step in the corn
[12:17] field I didn't have enough money to get
[12:19] a bed so I just had enough money to get
[12:22] home on and I got me some doughnuts
[12:24] couple days older rolls it was and for
[12:27] my breakfast I was welcome to eat with
[12:29] him but I didn't have no money to put in
[12:31] and M days that was in the depression 19
[12:33] and 33 so ISM it was pretty hard going
[12:37] and so I thought well I don't want to
[12:43] eat with them but I want to know what
[12:44] they've got they've got something in I
[12:46] haven't so that morning us they asked me
[12:50] all ministers comes the platform is just
[12:52] identify yourself who you are where
[12:54] you're from well I'm I just said william
[12:57] branham evangelist jefferson they'll sit
[13:00] down well at that time I was a youngest
[13:03] minister on the platform and the next
[13:05] day they called me to the platform to
[13:07] speak and then after I spoke father we
[13:10] had a great time and then I begin to
[13:13] meet different people inviting me to
[13:15] their churches then actually after that
[13:18] one I thought if I could only get word
[13:20] these two main man was that spoke in
[13:23] tongues and interpreted that was burning
[13:25] me up in my heart I wanted it so bad
[13:28] well as I've told you at the beginning a
[13:30] little gift that you pull over your
[13:33] gifts and callings are without
[13:35] repentance you had more your life that
[13:37] you're born with them if there are gifts
[13:39] of God
[13:40] so always that's a little bitty baby it
[13:43] always happen to me
[13:44] people who knows me all my life they're
[13:46] all that's true well if I thought I
[13:48] didn't know what it was then I call it
[13:50] I just didn't know what it was I thought
[13:52] if I could ever talk to them well and
[13:55] the spirit was in the building felt like
[13:57] this really the Spirit of God so I
[13:59] doctors talked to one of him and I asked
[14:02] him a few questions and he was a real
[14:04] genuine Christian there was no doubt
[14:06] about that that man was a real believer
[14:07] and the next man when I talked to him if
[14:11] I ever met a hypocrite that was one of
[14:13] them that man was actually he his wife
[14:16] was a blond-headed woman and he had
[14:17] children by two children by a black
[14:20] headed woman and I thought well now what
[14:23] here it is I'm all mixed up I'm a
[14:25] fundamentalist it must be the word or it
[14:27] it isn't right and here's that spirit
[14:29] one rang out partying all on door
[14:32] genuine the other was no good at all in
[14:34] the spirit poor little both of them now
[14:36] how can that be
[14:37] I had me puzzled two years later I've
[14:40] been praying in a cave where I'd go to
[14:42] pray got dusty in the cave and one
[14:45] afternoon I walked out laid my Bible on
[14:47] the log and the wind floated open to
[14:49] Hebrews the sixth chapter which said
[14:51] that in the last days how it would be if
[14:55] we fell away from the truth and renewed
[14:57] ourselves again unto repentance there
[14:58] was no more sacrifice for sin and how
[15:01] the thorns and thistles which is 9/2
[15:03] rejection whose end is to be burned but
[15:05] the rain come up the falling off earth
[15:08] often to water it to dress it but the
[15:11] thorns and thistles would be rejected
[15:12] but the week would be gathered but well
[15:16] it just a win had to blow that open well
[15:18] I just laid the Bible down again and I
[15:20] thought well now I'll just and here come
[15:22] the wind and blown it open that happened
[15:23] three times and I thought well now
[15:25] that's strange then I was raised up I
[15:27] thought Lord why would you open that
[15:29] Bible for me to read that when I get
[15:31] down to that were thorns and thistles
[15:33] which is 90 rejection in the study burn
[15:36] although why would you open that to be
[15:38] there and as looking out across now
[15:41] these real visions come without pulling
[15:43] into any gear that's this God see and I
[15:46] looked and I seen her earth that was
[15:48] turning out in front of me and I seen it
[15:50] was all disked up there was a man
[15:52] dressed in white went around sowing
[15:54] wheat and entering he went around the
[15:56] curvature of the earth around come a man
[15:58] looked horrible he was dressed in black
[16:00] and he was throwing a
[16:03] we seats all over they both come up
[16:05] together and when they did they both was
[16:07] thirsty because of rain was needed and
[16:10] each one look like was praying with his
[16:12] little head bent over lord send the rain
[16:15] Centuri the great clouds come up and the
[16:18] rain fell upon both of them when it did
[16:21] the little wheat jumped up and begin to
[16:23] say praise the Lord praise the Lord and
[16:25] the little wheat jumped up rise the same
[16:27] side and said praise the Lord praise the
[16:29] Lord
[16:29] then the vision was interpreted the rain
[16:32] falls on the just and the unjust the
[16:36] same spirit can fall in a meeting and
[16:38] everybody rejoice in and hypocrites
[16:40] Christians and all together exactly
[16:43] right but what is it by their fruits
[16:45] they are known that's the only way it
[16:48] can ever be known then you see that now
[16:52] since Wild Oats while we eat greens
[16:55] sometimes it person eights a genuine a
[16:59] domestic green so close that it would
[17:01] deceive the very elect 'add I think
[17:03] we're living in a timely age well these
[17:06] things should be a preach tone and
[17:09] talked about notice in verse 41 the two
[17:12] also very close so close to the last day
[17:17] still he didn't do he could not dis
[17:20] depend on some certain church to
[17:22] separate them say the Methodists or the
[17:24] Baptist's of the Pentecostals to
[17:26] separate him he said he sends his angels
[17:29] separate an angel is coming to bring the
[17:33] separation the segregation between the
[17:37] right and the wrong and no one can do
[17:40] that but the angel of the Lord he's the
[17:44] one that it's going to tell which is
[17:45] right which is wrong God said he will
[17:47] send His angels at the last time not
[17:51] angels down to here but angels at the
[17:53] last time and would gather together we
[17:57] know that this is the coming harvest
[18:01] time now Donny Joe is actually
[18:04] interpreted a messenger and we see that
[18:09] there are seven angels of the seven
[18:11] churches and now Noah through the church
[18:13] ages notice
[18:15] who he
[18:16] said that the sores were and also what
[18:19] the seed was one the sort was he the son
[18:24] of God
[18:24] he went for sowing seed and an enemy
[18:28] came behind him which was the devil and
[18:31] sowed the seed of discrepancy behind the
[18:35] sowing of the right seed now friends
[18:38] that has happened through every age
[18:40] since we've had a world exactly all the
[18:43] way from the beginning it started the
[18:45] very same thing now he said the seed of
[18:49] God the Word of God Jesus said in a
[18:52] certain place that the word is a seed
[18:54] and ever seed will bring forth of its
[18:56] kind and now if the Christian the
[18:59] children of God the children of the
[19:01] kingdom has become the seed of God then
[19:04] they must be the Word of God the Word of
[19:08] God manifested in the age that they're
[19:10] living in or the promised seed of that
[19:13] age God gave his word at the beginning
[19:16] in each age has had it see it's time
[19:19] this promises now when Noah came on the
[19:22] scene and he was the seed of God the
[19:25] Word of God for that age when Moses came
[19:27] he could not come with Noah's message it
[19:29] wouldn't work because he was a seed of
[19:32] God at that time then when Christ come
[19:34] he could not come with Noah or Moses age
[19:37] it was his time for a virgin to conceive
[19:39] and to bring forth a son and he would be
[19:42] the Messiah now we've lived through
[19:45] Luther's age Wesley's age mentally
[19:47] staged all down through the ages in the
[19:49] Pentecostal age in each age has given a
[19:51] promise of the word and the people of
[19:54] that age that manifests that promise
[19:56] word is the seed of that age according
[19:59] what Jesus said right here they are the
[20:01] children of the kingdom that's right the
[20:04] manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[20:06] operating through his children is those
[20:08] seed of the kingdom at that age
[20:11] notice the carriers was the one the
[20:14] enemy Satan who sowed discord are the
[20:17] the Sita of discrepancy he was the one
[20:21] guilty of doing this horrible thing
[20:24] Satan sold his seed from the beginning
[20:26] when God placed his first harvest of
[20:29] human
[20:29] upon the earth Adam of course as yet
[20:33] knew that there was a a knowledge of
[20:36] truth right wrong and he had never come
[20:39] to that as yet but we find out God gave
[20:43] his children his word for their defense
[20:47] that we have no other defense than the
[20:50] Word of God that is our defense there's
[20:53] no bombs no shelters no hiding places
[20:56] though Arizona's or California's or
[20:59] wherever it is
[21:00] there's only one defense we have and
[21:02] that is the word and the Word was made
[21:05] flesh and dwelt among us which is Christ
[21:07] Jesus he is our only defense being in
[21:10] him
[21:11] we are safe not even sin is imputed to a
[21:15] genuine believer did you know that he
[21:18] this born of God does not commit sin he
[21:20] cannot see him it's not even in few
[21:23] different while David said blessed it is
[21:25] a man who God will not impute sin when
[21:27] you are in Christ you have no desire to
[21:29] sting the worshiper once purge has no
[21:32] more consciousness in you don't desire
[21:35] not to the world you might be a sinner
[21:37] but to God you're not because you're in
[21:38] Christ how can you be in the center when
[21:41] you're in the sinless one and God only
[21:44] sees him who you are in now this harvest
[21:48] time at the beginning when God SODIS
[21:51] seat upon the earth and gave it in the
[21:53] hearts of his children his family to
[21:57] keep that word that was her only defense
[22:00] keep that word here come the enemy in
[22:03] and broke that barrier by sowing the
[22:06] seed of discrepancy contrary to the Word
[22:09] of God if that was discrepancy in the
[22:13] beginning it's still anything that will
[22:16] add anything to the Word of God is still
[22:19] the seed of discrepancy I don't care
[22:21] what comes from if it's from
[22:23] organization it is from military sources
[22:27] if it's from political powers anything
[22:29] that's contrary to the Word of God is
[22:31] the seed of discrepancy when a man
[22:36] stands and says he's a gospel preacher
[22:38] and says that the days of miracles is
[22:40] fast that's the seed
[22:42] of discrepancy when a man stands and
[22:45] says that he's the minister a pastor of
[22:48] a church of somewhere and he does not
[22:50] believe that Jesus Christ is the same in
[22:53] every detail except the physical body
[22:55] same yesterday today forever that's a
[22:57] scene of discrepancy when he says that
[23:00] miracles and Apostolic age past that
[23:03] seed of discrepancy when they say
[23:06] there's no such a thing is divine
[23:07] healing that seed of discrepancy then
[23:11] the world is full of it this crowds out
[23:14] and chokes out the week we notice that
[23:17] the first store of the seat of
[23:19] discrepancy was branded the devil and we
[23:22] know it was and Genesis 1 that we find
[23:26] out over here in in the book of Matthew
[23:29] the 13th chapter Jesus still Brants any
[23:33] discrepancy to his word as being the
[23:35] devil and this 1956 anything that source
[23:40] discrepancy contrary to the written word
[23:43] of God or puts any private
[23:44] interpretation to it it is a seed of
[23:46] discrepancy God will not honor
[23:49] he can't it won't mix it certainly will
[23:52] not it's like mustard seed it won't mix
[23:54] with anything else you came to table
[23:56] read it it's got to be the genuine thing
[23:58] seed of discrepancy now we find when God
[24:03] told his seed in the Garden of Eden we
[24:06] find out that it brought forth unable
[24:09] but when Satan sold his seed of
[24:13] discrepancy it brought forth a Cain one
[24:17] brought forth a righteous one one
[24:19] brought forth an unrighteous one because
[24:22] that Eve listen to the word of
[24:24] discrepancy contrary to the Word of God
[24:27] and to start of the ball of sin rolling
[24:30] right there's Road ever since and we'll
[24:33] never get it all out until the angels
[24:36] comes and saturates the thing and God
[24:38] takes his children to the kingdom and
[24:40] the terrors will be burned notice those
[24:45] two vines if we just had more time on
[24:48] this subject but just to hit the hot
[24:49] spots so you're right into praying for
[24:51] the sick in the next few minutes notice
[24:53] there
[24:54] seeds crew together just exactly like
[24:58] God said over here also in the
[25:00] thirteenth chapter of our text tonight
[25:02] of Matthew let them grow together now
[25:05] Cain went to the Land of Nod found
[25:08] himself a wife and married and Abel was
[25:11] fluent and God raised up saith to take
[25:13] his place and the generation started
[25:15] moving on between right Rome now we
[25:18] notice they've gathered each one of them
[25:19] time after time and God had to it got so
[25:22] wicked - God had to destroy but they
[25:25] finally came forth until both of those
[25:28] seeds the seed of discrepancy and the
[25:31] seed of God put forth third genuine
[25:35] heads and that wound up in Judas is a
[25:40] carrot and in Jesus Christ or he was the
[25:44] seed of God he was the beginning of the
[25:47] creation of God he was nothing less than
[25:49] God and judas iscariot was born the son
[25:54] of perdition come from hell return to
[25:57] hell Jesus Christ was the son of God the
[26:00] Word of God made manifest Judas Iscariot
[26:03] and his discrepancy was the seed of the
[26:05] devil come to the world and for deceit
[26:08] just like he was at the beginning King
[26:10] his former father Judas
[26:13] only played Church he wasn't really
[26:17] sincere he didn't actually have faith he
[26:19] didn't ever betray Jesus but he sold
[26:23] that seat of discrepancy he thought that
[26:25] he can make friends with the world
[26:27] Mammon and also had friends ship with
[26:31] Jesus but it was too late for him to do
[26:34] anything about it when the dead our team
[26:37] when he did this evil thing he crossed
[26:39] the separating line between going
[26:42] forward and returning back he had to go
[26:45] on in the way that he went as a deceiver
[26:48] he sold the seat of discrepancy he tried
[26:51] to find favor with those great
[26:53] organizations of that day with the
[26:56] Pharisees and Sadducees and thought he
[26:58] make yourself a piece of money and would
[27:00] be popular among the people if that
[27:03] doesn't cost so many people that get in
[27:05] that the scrap
[27:06] time to find favor with man let's find
[27:10] favor with God not with man but that's
[27:14] what Judas done when this discrepancies
[27:17] headed up in him and we know that Jesus
[27:19] was the word st. John wants it in the
[27:23] beginning was the word and the Word was
[27:26] with God in the Word was God and the
[27:28] Word was made flesh and dwelt here among
[27:30] us then the word is deceived and the
[27:33] seed become flesh and dwelt among us if
[27:36] Judas was the seed of the enemy and the
[27:39] discrepancy it also become flesh and
[27:42] dwelt among us in the person of Judas
[27:45] Iscariot he never had no real real faith
[27:49] he hadn't of what he thought was a faith
[27:51] there's such a thing as having faith and
[27:54] a make-believe faith and a genuine faith
[27:57] of God will believe in God and God is
[28:01] the word it'll never add nothing to it
[28:03] the Bible tells us if we add one word or
[28:06] take one word away our part will be
[28:08] taken from the book of life revelation
[28:10] 22:18
[28:11] the last posing chapter in the first
[28:14] beginning the first book of the Bible
[28:15] God told them not to break one word or
[28:18] that every word must be kept famous live
[28:20] in that word Jesus in the middle of the
[28:23] book come along and said that in his age
[28:25] and said man shall not live by bread
[28:27] alone but by every word that it it comes
[28:30] out and out of God in the closing age of
[28:32] Revelations foretold to us and whosoever
[28:35] shall take one word out of the book or
[28:37] add one word to it his part will be
[28:40] taken from the book of life therefore
[28:42] there can be nothing shadowy just a
[28:45] genuine unadulterated Word of God that's
[28:49] sons of God daughters of God who's not
[28:53] born for the will of man or by shaking a
[28:55] hand of son form of baptism but born in
[28:58] the Spirit of God by the Holy Ghost and
[29:00] the word manifesting itself through them
[29:02] that's genuine seat of God the enemy
[29:07] John's Church and becomes very Orthodox
[29:10] in a creed or something but that's not
[29:12] that's discrepancy anything that
[29:15] interferes with that a string of genuine
[29:19] truth of God's Word how do we know we
[29:22] say well the of you got a right to
[29:23] interpret it no sir no man has a right
[29:26] to interpret God's Word he's his own
[29:28] interpreter
[29:29] he promises there's any dozen that's the
[29:31] interpretation there are when he
[29:34] promised it then he fulfills it that's
[29:36] the Terr petition of it he think
[29:39] contrary to God's Word is the
[29:41] discrepancy absolutely now as I said
[29:44] Judas has no real faith he had a
[29:47] make-believe faith the era of faith that
[29:49] he thought that that was the son of God
[29:51] but he didn't know that was the son of
[29:53] God he wouldn't have done it in a manual
[29:57] compromise on this Word of God being the
[29:59] truth he's got a make-believe faith
[30:02] kanya one shriveled God hang on that
[30:04] word unites to go up certain minister of
[30:08] Arizona of a great famous school here in
[30:11] this city came to me and said I want to
[30:14] straight me out on something I said when
[30:16] you get a chance I said this is the best
[30:17] chance I know of come on over and so he
[30:20] came over he said mister randomly do
[30:22] you're trying so big you're sincere in
[30:24] your honest but you're trying to
[30:25] introduce to a world at the Stalag
[30:28] doctrine and said the Apostolic age
[30:31] ceased with the Apostles I said the
[30:34] first thing I'd like to ask you my
[30:35] brother do you believe it every word of
[30:39] God is inspired he said yes sir I
[30:41] certainly do I said then would you show
[30:44] me in the word were the Apostolic age
[30:46] ceased now you show me where it is I
[30:51] believe with you now said the rider of
[30:54] the apostolic the one that had the keys
[30:56] to the kingdom on the day of Pentecost
[30:59] when the Apostolic age wasn't introduced
[31:01] they said many brother what can we do to
[31:04] be saved he said repent every one of you
[31:06] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:08] for the remission of sins and you shall
[31:10] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[31:12] further promises into you into your
[31:15] children and the famous farro even as
[31:17] many as the Lord our God shall call now
[31:22] how can the word contradict itself a man
[31:25] said I have an awful cold announcer
[31:26] hustling so to the now you tell me is
[31:29] God still calling
[31:31] if God's still calling then the
[31:33] Apostolic age is still in existence
[31:37] certainly as many as the Lord our God
[31:40] shall call ever called ever will call as
[31:44] many as he shall call it will still be
[31:47] the Apostolic age or Jesus Christ is the
[31:50] same yesterday today and forever how we
[31:54] find today at this discrepancy has been
[31:56] sowed through every age if it was
[31:58] possible to get it in the next 10 or 15
[32:00] minutes I would do it but you can't down
[32:02] through the ages we are all most all of
[32:04] us read the Bible and now like when
[32:06] Jesus come and he found that discrepancy
[32:08] contrary he was the Word made manifest
[32:11] he was God's interpretation of the word
[32:15] because he said search the Scriptures
[32:18] for you then you think you have eternal
[32:20] life and they are they that testify of
[32:23] me there you are
[32:26] he he was the interpretation of the word
[32:29] and every part again son and daughter of
[32:33] God of this age is the interpretation of
[32:36] the word your ripped epistles read of
[32:38] all man
[32:42] yes notice he said in vain they do
[32:46] worship Me teaching discrepancy for
[32:49] doctrine in vain do they worship Me
[32:51] teaching for doctrines the discrepancy
[32:55] doctoring a man Creed's a man teaching
[32:58] that to be the Word of God when it has
[33:01] nothing to do with the Word of God
[33:03] look each age for do such a crop every
[33:06] age has did it and ours is no excuse we
[33:09] had the same thing and a greater age of
[33:11] it than all the other ages put together
[33:13] or this is the ending of world's history
[33:16] this is a great discrepancy that's ever
[33:19] been upon the earth is on the face of
[33:21] the earth today discrepancy in other
[33:23] ages pulled him away from the true and
[33:24] living God
[33:25] two idols today Jesus said in Matthew
[33:28] 24:24
[33:29] that it would be so close to when the
[33:30] scenes are very elected if it was
[33:33] possibly talk about discrepancy or is so
[33:37] cunning
[33:37] Satan is among the people and just such
[33:41] a theologian such a Doctor of Divinity
[33:44] can teach that word almost perfect Jesus
[33:49] said so but just watching there'll be
[33:51] some where he said well now that wasn't
[33:52] for this oh yes it is too because God
[33:55] said it was look what it did them same
[33:59] discrepancy bought the God's wrath upon
[34:02] the days of Noah when God sent His
[34:04] Prophet out and preached as a flaming
[34:06] fire call repentance to the people and
[34:09] the discrepancy ground it out then what
[34:12] does Satan do come right behind and ham
[34:14] and started sowed it again the doctor
[34:16] I'd long Campos is the great prophet to
[34:19] bring the children of Israel up out of
[34:21] the wilderness what happened
[34:22] Moses the great prophet of God breaking
[34:25] them the absolutely truth indicated
[34:28] truth you'd met God God through that he
[34:32] admitting how those people back there
[34:35] those priests in there had the religions
[34:37] the rituals our rites and everything but
[34:39] Moses stood as a vindication of the
[34:42] interpretation of the word don't forget
[34:44] that Moses was God's interpretation of
[34:48] his promise he said a good God's
[34:51] interpretation what happened the church
[34:54] just got started out of Egypt on his
[34:56] feet a few days what happened Satan come
[34:59] along with his discrepancy in the person
[35:02] the second Cain which was Balaam and
[35:06] he's so discrepancy amongst them we know
[35:09] that giant that Balaam the teaching of
[35:12] Balaam that we were all the same
[35:14] we've served the same God you do
[35:16] fundamentally he was right because he
[35:20] offered us sacrifice that God offered
[35:23] seven Rams seven books on seven altars
[35:27] and prayed to the same God just as
[35:29] perfect as Moses did down into orders
[35:32] just exactly the same but there were not
[35:35] the same before shouting to us what
[35:39] would come to pass there was again Cain
[35:42] manifested in the person of Balaam and
[35:47] there was God manifested in the person
[35:51] of Moses and Terpening his words to a
[35:55] human
[35:56] be making yourself known his province
[36:00] through a human being and the
[36:02] discrepancy raised up solely to do it in
[36:06] the time of Judas there he come with his
[36:09] discrepancy and remember this sin that
[36:13] those people believe that we're all the
[36:14] same we worship the same God we shall
[36:18] all come to the same church we should be
[36:20] the same people that sin was never
[36:23] forgiven Israel jesus said himself they
[36:26] all are dead they perish all the three
[36:30] of them that was the ones who helped own
[36:33] and believed the promise when the
[36:36] Weakland said we cannot take the land is
[36:38] too much for us and so forth Caleb and
[36:40] Joshua still the people said we're more
[36:43] than able to take it because God
[36:46] promised it to us I don't care what the
[36:48] opposition is and we still can provide
[36:51] that is another holy garden and still
[36:54] have a power of Bob the separators God
[36:58] said so Apostolic age has never ceased
[37:01] that it will not see it goes on so we
[37:05] find the same old sort of discrepancy
[37:07] and remember that sin was never forgiven
[37:12] how brother if it was never forgiven
[37:15] then what about now when the the real
[37:20] seed of all the ages is coming together
[37:25] notice this great thing that Balaam did
[37:28] it went on and all and it finally ended
[37:31] in the coming of Judas insecurity and
[37:35] Jesus what was it Judas and Jesus was
[37:39] just exactly a figure of Cain and Abel
[37:42] for as Judas was religious so was Cain
[37:47] religious Cain build an altar he made a
[37:52] sacrifice he worshiped God he was just
[37:56] as sincere in it as the other and was
[37:58] but you see he didn't have the
[38:00] revelation of what the word was he
[38:04] thought it was Adam and Eve and eat some
[38:06] apples are some fruit
[38:08] and table by revelation no that was
[38:11] wrong it was a flood that brought about
[38:14] any offer to lament God testified his
[38:16] offering was right then he got jealous
[38:19] and tried to kill his brethren and as he
[38:23] killed his brother upon the same order
[38:25] that his sacrifice died on the lamb died
[38:28] upon the altar so did Judas is a carrot
[38:32] betray Jesus Christ upon the altar of
[38:35] God and killed him just as Cain killed
[38:39] Abel because Cain was the seed of
[38:42] discrepancy and soul was Balaam the
[38:46] hireling prophet a man who were ought to
[38:49] know better and God warned in two signs
[38:52] and wonders and even a huge speaking in
[38:54] unknown tongues and still he went that
[38:57] all just to save he was born to be a
[39:02] sort of a discrepancy and if Jesus
[39:05] predicted this age to end up in the
[39:07] greatest discrepancy that ever was the
[39:09] lady of see a church age lukewarm that
[39:11] put him out of the church how could it
[39:14] be anything else but that discrepancy
[39:16] certainly it is it ends in that age and
[39:19] it was Cain and Abel again on Calvary
[39:23] now I noticed as ever as soon as Jesus
[39:27] went away went into heaven the Holy
[39:30] Spirit was set back that was the seed
[39:32] the life giver unto the word as we spoke
[39:36] last night it's the one that quickens
[39:38] the word quickening springs to life the
[39:41] genuine Holy Spirit only brings to life
[39:44] the word that it is it won't bring your
[39:48] Creed to life it can't because it's
[39:50] nothing out of the cream it is the life
[39:53] of the Word of God for it is gone and
[39:57] quickens that body now notice as they
[40:02] did they did the Bible said it's and
[40:05] John spoke to the children and said
[40:08] little children you have heard of the
[40:11] Antichrist which was to come into the
[40:12] world said which already is in the world
[40:15] and it working in the children of
[40:18] disobedience
[40:19] now that was long about three
[40:21] years after the coming of the Holy Ghost
[40:23] we find when the Holy Ghost come the
[40:25] real seat real life giver to the seed
[40:28] then here comes that discrepancy in
[40:30] again and notice all it was in it the
[40:34] real word have been vindicated them
[40:36] puppets of all had vindicated the Word
[40:38] of God to be the truth as they went down
[40:40] if anybody ever read the Gnostic Council
[40:43] or the pre na city council than fifteen
[40:45] days of bloody politics well then a
[40:48] bunch of Romans down there wanted to
[40:50] bring in and make a denomination how
[40:51] that church prophets came in wrapped his
[40:54] sheep skinny herbs and stood for that
[40:57] word what did it do it had to be like
[40:59] chained it had to be like able one had
[41:02] to die
[41:03] certainly it did and the word lost its
[41:06] influence amongst the people and they
[41:08] all voted out the true word and took in
[41:11] dog was the discrepancy of the early
[41:13] Catholic Church they added a pope dad
[41:17] and a bishop they added this that the
[41:18] other they've taken away the real true
[41:20] meaning of period of a Marian and all
[41:23] the rest of and made idols and made
[41:25] nothing but just a pagan ceremony out of
[41:27] so-called Christian religion
[41:29] what was it seed of discrepancy and
[41:32] organized organized for the first time
[41:36] owner a church what was it that's
[41:40] steeped of discrepancy which started
[41:42] sewing something added to taken away who
[41:45] ever heard in the Bible not eat meat on
[41:47] Friday whoever you heard in the Bible of
[41:51] anything is frankly instead of baptizing
[41:52] his mercy
[41:54] whoever heard of those things the Hail
[41:56] Mary or something whoever her son this
[41:59] rotten tommyrot of these promises to
[42:03] take all Kittel greasy right just guilty
[42:08] the least is guilty the home who ever
[42:11] heard of God ever dealing in an
[42:12] organization
[42:13] show me one time it won't ever organized
[42:15] and ever stayed alive they died on me
[42:18] today and never did rise again huh if
[42:22] something takes place it's time for God
[42:25] to move it kill the influence amongst
[42:27] the people same things been done today
[42:29] they kill the influence at all that
[42:31] bunch of holy rollers there's nothing to
[42:33] you on this watch this
[42:35] fancy beat the word face-to-face and see
[42:38] what is see if God interprets his own
[42:40] word gods day for these stones to rise
[42:43] children Abraham a word have been
[42:48] thoroughly vindicated by them early
[42:49] Christians how God delivered them from
[42:52] everything in diseases and they had
[42:54] prophets and they spoke in tongues
[42:56] interpreting gave messages that's proved
[42:58] to be exactly the truth every time but
[43:00] in the face of all that vindicated words
[43:02] the people voted it out and voted a
[43:05] denomination
[43:07] that's the mother of all organizations
[43:10] both are fully mature down they started
[43:15] Seaton again it died out but it bloomed
[43:18] again in the days of Luther as we know
[43:21] from the former message shown the
[43:23] morning of the breakfast bloom down in
[43:26] the day of Luther
[43:27] now what did they do on these the epic
[43:29] great man died they did an organization
[43:32] it bloomed out and again in the days of
[43:34] John Wesley when I'm angle is with all
[43:37] their eternal securities and everything
[43:39] had founded up into a place what almost
[43:41] universalism and what happened God
[43:43] raised up a man named John Wesley's laid
[43:45] the whole thing and as soon as he died
[43:47] him and as burying them what happened
[43:50] they organized and now you got all kinds
[43:52] of Methodist then along comes one of the
[43:54] other Alexander Campbell John Smith one
[43:56] more Bonnie all broke the Pentecost
[43:58] coming out of all of it what happened
[44:00] then they did run well what did he
[44:02] injure you you went right back in the
[44:04] st. but you come out of right back in
[44:07] the same slop went back to discrepancy
[44:09] in to make organizations you had to
[44:10] compromise on the word and every time
[44:12] God has sent something new you could
[44:14] they receive it right discrepancy again
[44:17] and notice as I said of the day that
[44:19] first little husk and come forth from
[44:22] this root comes up into the LEAs up into
[44:25] the fossil then back into the stock
[44:27] again it comes out that little husk a
[44:29] wheat almost look like the green itself
[44:31] and we thought it was but when you open
[44:34] up there's no grain there at all it's
[44:37] only the supporter for the green to grow
[44:39] by and it dies also on the knife goes
[44:41] right out of it goes into the green
[44:43] notice so they call the churches as
[44:46] sowed we find out today
[44:48] that our so-called churches even our
[44:51] Pentecostals we went out we couldn't be
[44:53] satisfied we had to make groups of our
[44:55] own everything come up we had to have
[44:57] this we have this we had to have another
[44:59] group this fellow raised up said he's
[45:01] coming to wipe out those ah he's come
[45:03] with a white horse
[45:04] aren't we makes you groups see what is
[45:06] it sewing up discrepancy when he comes
[45:09] whatever it is he'll interpret his own
[45:12] word when he comes let's wait till that
[45:14] time gets to talking about that you
[45:16] don't even get the message of the day
[45:18] always part of what God's gonna do or
[45:20] what he has done and ignored what he's
[45:22] doing that's the way we get
[45:23] discrepancies in it how we noticed that
[45:26] today our churches or all of our
[45:28] churches has sold to the winds and are
[45:31] reaping the whirlwind we don't have the
[45:34] prayer meetings we don't have the
[45:35] service service who used to have what's
[45:37] the matter
[45:37] we fled on the bars on everything so
[45:40] keeping our Pentecostal churches setting
[45:42] full of Bob Harrod women that use not be
[45:44] permitted painted faces wearing
[45:46] fingernail polish is all kind of stuff
[45:48] you know man out here with like Ricky's
[45:50] and so forth
[45:51] Mary three or four times and deacons oh
[45:53] what a discrepancy its Bell how do they
[45:57] do it not wouldn't have in his church
[45:59] they have to go to an organization to
[46:00] get into it somebody afraid to say
[46:03] something that cause to be kicked out of
[46:05] the organization God give us man who's
[46:06] not connecting with nothing but God and
[46:08] His Word that'll tell the truth about it
[46:12] exactly what we need what have we done
[46:17] so discrepancy we so do the winds and
[46:20] now we're reaping the whirlwind notice
[46:22] that they're now being gathered together
[46:26] for the Bernie did you notice Jesus said
[46:29] first gather them together
[46:31] Bunim then put all the bundles in one
[46:34] pile now Birnam there's a little bundle
[46:37] called Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[46:38] loser they're all gathered together in
[46:40] the World Council of Churches
[46:42] what is it forget it a.m. first father
[46:46] knew young did you notice he gathers the
[46:49] carriers first gets him away from the
[46:52] wheat separates him shelter them
[46:56] together and burn them they're all to be
[46:59] burned but the judgments of God
[47:01] Saur discrepancy among the people things
[47:04] that say having a form of godliness into
[47:07] nine of power thereof denying the word
[47:10] just to hold up some religious rights or
[47:12] some dogma that somebody's injected in
[47:14] trying to put in the Word of God it
[47:16] won't work
[47:17] it's a discrepancy I screamed today as
[47:20] it wasn't the great prophet of longer
[47:22] door Amos
[47:23] when he comes down in that city said I'm
[47:25] not a prophet or son of a prophet but if
[47:28] the lion roars who can be fear is that
[47:31] when God speaks who can the prophesy he
[47:35] predicted judgment upon that generation
[47:37] said the very God that you claim to
[47:39] serve will destroy you you put this it's
[47:42] on tape you remember the very doubt that
[47:45] these people now that's gathering all
[47:47] this great big harvest of of World
[47:49] Council of Churches and you're going to
[47:51] have to go into Church can't stay out of
[47:53] it you're either going to be in
[47:55] officially get out of it or you're going
[47:57] into it ain't gonna be no middle ground
[47:59] they'll be the mark of the beast
[48:01] no man can buy or sell except he that
[48:03] has the mark or Scott the discrepancy
[48:05] now stay out of it get out of it play it
[48:09] stay away from it the God that they
[48:12] claim they're serving will destroy him
[48:14] the Great God of love who won't set far
[48:16] jesus prayed that we should all be one
[48:18] then he also said how can you walk
[48:21] together to all killers to be agreed he
[48:23] said for one like he and the father are
[48:25] one
[48:26] and the father was the word and he was
[48:28] the word made manifest he was one with
[48:30] the father because he was the
[48:32] manifestation of God's promised word and
[48:35] so is it today or any other day yes sir
[48:39] the God is what he wants us to be one
[48:41] how can this be one this the denying the
[48:44] virgin birth and this doctor and I
[48:45] divine healing and this that all of a
[48:47] mess like that some other people don't
[48:49] even even God maybe was the son of God
[48:51] leave as the son of Joseph called the
[48:52] son of God
[48:53] certainly the twin brother to the Luther
[48:56] and swinglish lead that that he was
[48:58] absolutely just a good man the Christian
[49:01] Science said he was a prophet just an
[49:02] ordinary man he wasn't divine what he
[49:05] wasn't embodies our greatest deceiver
[49:06] the world ever had he was gone or he was
[49:09] nothing
[49:11] he was defined he was deity himself a
[49:14] spatula sterling that's what he was now
[49:22] we see the discrepancy has come in we
[49:25] know that it's shared
[49:26] nobody can deny oh my just notice he
[49:30] will destroy that group that clean
[49:32] they're serving God you watch it God
[49:35] planted his seed I'm close he calls this
[49:38] time to start the prayer life God plated
[49:40] his seat and his seed is Christ I'm
[49:43] gonna preach on that dip unite or God
[49:45] decided to put his name Lord putting a
[49:47] bit one of the breakfast is when I have
[49:49] a little more time look he is the only
[49:52] way of escape here's the only true
[49:55] potentate he's the only true God none
[49:59] other besides he I am God and God alone
[50:02] he's dead
[50:03] jesus said this is the command here your
[50:05] Israel I'm the Lord your God just one
[50:07] God I am he what do you look for another
[50:10] another will come I come in my father's
[50:12] name and you receive me not but another
[50:14] no comedies own name and him you will
[50:16] receive and they did it at Nicaea are
[50:19] you a Christian I'm Baptist are you
[50:20] Christian on Pentecost are you Christian
[50:22] on method it's another name but when it
[50:24] comes to that name of Jesus Christ and
[50:26] walked is this far from it as a can they
[50:28] don't want nothing to do with it or he
[50:30] is the word the word declares itself
[50:33] notice the only way of escape he is the
[50:36] Rose of Sharon the Bible said he was
[50:38] every title in the Bible of God belongs
[50:41] to Jesus Christ he was Alpha Omega the
[50:44] beginning and the end he that was which
[50:46] is and shall come the Routan offspring
[50:47] of David both root and offspring of
[50:49] David the Morningstar the Rose of Sharon
[50:52] the lilies of Valley
[50:53] the Alpha Omega father son Holy Ghost
[50:55] all in Jesus Christ he was the full
[50:57] manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh
[51:00] to dwell among us exactly what he was he
[51:03] was the Rose of Sharon what did they do
[51:04] with the rolls of Sharon they squeezed
[51:06] it out mashed it out to get the perfume
[51:09] out a beautiful rolls has to be squeezed
[51:11] down to get the perfume from the rose
[51:14] that was a beautiful life and there was
[51:16] a life lived like it but it had to be
[51:18] squeezed out on Calvary Dena took the
[51:21] anointing of the rolls of Sharon and put
[51:23] it up
[51:23] Aaron he had to be anointed with that or
[51:26] to go in before the Lord in the Holy
[51:28] Place and the holy pail he had to be
[51:32] anointed with the Rose of Sharon to
[51:34] going to sprinkle of mercy see each year
[51:36] and that anointing must be up on him a
[51:39] sweet-smelling Savior unto the Lord
[51:41] packing the blood of the Lamb before him
[51:43] action also been sprinkled by the land
[51:45] pomegranates that bells around his
[51:47] garments yet to walk a certain step
[51:48] playing holy holy holy unto the Lord
[51:51] notice he is that Rose of Sharon that
[51:54] sweet-smelling Savior the anointing upon
[51:56] his people it cannot come before you but
[52:00] then he create any other thing but
[52:02] anointed with that Rose of Sharon the
[52:05] word he also is the lily of the valley
[52:08] now how do you get opium you get opium
[52:11] when you take a lily and squeeze it out
[52:13] you get the opium doctors used it in
[52:15] their laboratories take a man just
[52:17] nervous and frustrated our woman she
[52:19] feels like she's gonna go crazy she's
[52:21] walking the floor and screaming she's in
[52:23] hysterics a doctor will take a little
[52:24] office Lily
[52:26] opium and push it into her arm or vein
[52:29] somewhere his and they fightin down all
[52:33] over for a while but just as soon as
[52:35] that opium dies out here they come again
[52:37] worse than they ever was but I'll tell
[52:39] you friends that's only a type of the
[52:41] genuine opium from the lily of the
[52:44] valley that I know he is the lily of the
[52:47] valley
[52:48] he was squeezed out on Calvary he was
[52:50] wounded for our transgression with his
[52:52] stripes we were here in that that
[52:55] squeezing out of the flowers he was the
[52:57] flower he's the greatest flower that
[52:59] ever grown was this Lily LaValley and
[53:01] this great Rose of Sharon now he hangs
[53:05] tonight
[53:06] span in between heavens and earth I
[53:08] believe he was that time rather to to
[53:10] take away the sin of the world and to
[53:12] bring healing back to the world in the
[53:14] Bible said that he's the same yesterday
[53:15] today and forever random when God told
[53:20] Moses in the wilderness which was a type
[53:22] of him to lift up a brass Serpent and
[53:24] brass represents sin judge the serpent
[53:28] represents a brass serpent represents
[53:29] sin already judged as brass is divine
[53:33] judgment like the brazing altar where
[53:35] the sacrifices laid all
[53:37] Alijah looked up and he said the sky was
[53:39] like brass divine judgement upon an
[53:41] unbelieving nation and a back slid for
[53:44] God brass represents judgment divine
[53:46] judgment and the serpent represented sin
[53:49] already judged and Jesus was that
[53:53] serpent made sin for us and took the
[53:56] judgments of God upon him he was wounded
[53:59] for our transgressions bruised for our
[54:01] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[54:03] upon him and with His stripes we are
[54:04] healed
[54:06] Oh God's got his cabinet full of opium
[54:08] tonight for you Christian friends your
[54:10] sick and suffering
[54:11] oh you're weary is just too hard for you
[54:13] you can't stand it much longer your boat

[54:21] Russia says in 55 if they'll absolutely
[54:23] take full control of the whole world

[54:28] to come so I'm not closed is it friend
[54:29] it's right here close now at hand won't
[54:32] you seeking tonight with all your heart
[54:34] he is the lily of the valley and he's
[54:37] the same yesterday today and forever
[54:39] he shared tonight to lift himself up
[54:42] among his people just like Moses lifted
[54:44] up this the sin sign judge and not only
[54:47] stand but sickness remember Jesus said
[54:50] as Moses lifted up the brass serpent so
[54:53] much the Son of Man be lifted up what it
[54:55] Moses lifted up for force in unbelief
[54:58] and for sickness Jesus has lifted up
[55:01] also for sin sickness and unbelief he
[55:05] was the same thing now tonight in the
[55:07] days when we got this great discrepancy
[55:09] Jesus Christ promised in Luke that in
[55:11] the days of the before the coming of the
[55:13] Lord would be like it was in the days of
[55:15] Sodom and when the son of man would
[55:18] reveal himself like the Son of man
[55:20] revealed himself to Abraham down there
[55:22] Elohim God made flesh among people and
[55:26] dwelt there with Abraham and surety told
[55:29] him what Sarah was thinking of setting
[55:31] behind him in the tent that he had never
[55:32] seen told her what she had called her
[55:35] named Sarah
[55:37] Abraham not his not his name Abram he
[55:41] started out with but Abraham not Sarah
[55:44] sa RA but sa RA H where is thy wife
[55:47] Sarah said she's in the pits on
[55:50] she said I'm go to visit you according
[55:52] to the time of eyghon she lives he said
[55:54] why did she laugh now Jesus said just
[55:57] before this great discrepancy is
[55:59] gathered and burned that the Son of Man
[56:02] will redeem himself in the same manner
[56:04] as he did fan and that's what is it it's

[1:04:17] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:04:19] and forever
[1:04:20] I ski free see you don't have to be up
[1:04:23] here that you might know now this is the
[1:04:27] lady as far as I know I've never seen
[1:04:30] her in my life just a woman standing

[1:04:44] knowing what you are who you are or you
[1:04:48] come from what you want nothing about it
[1:04:50] I'm just a manga that's right this same
[1:04:54] picture from one time in the Bible Saint
[1:04:57] John the 4th chapter I said what you do
[1:05:00] brother Bram just and a while ago just
[1:05:02] pulled over that little gear see I don't
[1:05:04] know see he has to do it I don't know
[1:05:07] how did that woman out there I never
[1:05:09] seen that woman in my life she's a total
[1:05:11] stranger to me I believe it was a woman
[1:05:12] who is a person's heel just now that
[1:05:15] they're the audience we are we're
[1:05:16] strangers to one another
[1:05:17] that's right wave your hand like this I
[1:05:19] never seen the woman but she was sitting
[1:05:21] there believing she touched something
[1:05:24] did she it wouldn't do no good to touch
[1:05:26] me but I can't you see that the Bible is
[1:05:29] exactly the Word of God he's the same
[1:05:31] yesterday today and forever we become
[1:05:33] Tabernacles of that Holy Spirit which is
[1:05:36] Christ see that's the real seat then of
[1:05:39] that real Holy Spirit gets into the real
[1:05:41] seat of the word not and just won't take
[1:05:44] part of it because the devil uses that
[1:05:45] you've got to take it all every word of
[1:05:48] it cause he's not half God he's all gone
[1:05:50] and that's what takes place now yours a
[1:05:54] woman I've never seen her Jesus found a
[1:05:57] woman like this one time maybe not the
[1:05:59] same condition
[1:06:00] I don't know and he's setting out it
[1:06:02] well he hadn't need to go down to
[1:06:04] Samaria and we find out - Samaria was
[1:06:08] under the hill and he's going to Jericho
[1:06:11] rather he went around bout Samaria and
[1:06:13] come to a city of psychic and he sat
[1:06:15] down on the well and sent his disciples
[1:06:17] away for food how many races of people
