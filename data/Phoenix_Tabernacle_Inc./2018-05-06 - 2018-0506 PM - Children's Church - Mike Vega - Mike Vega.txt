bring you the next in a series of sequential excerpts from the series supernatural to life of William Branham we're at book three the man in his commissioned 1946 to 1950 written by a precious brother orange or Genson tonight we're going to continue the chapter our prayer line eight days long from 1946 just a few comments before we get started I'm so thankful to the Lord that we have a prophet that gave his all out there in the field for the Lord Jesus Christ his ministry went national in 1946 and encompass over eighteen and a half years and I think everyone knows here when brother Brennan spoke of the Lord his heart was always in it there was never a moment that I heard a service that brother Brennan was involved in that I ever had to question the authenticity of what he was sharing with us we knew it came straight from the Lord and tonight we're going to get a taste of how he gave his all to such a degree that he he pushed his own physical limitations to the point that I'm thankful that the Lord impressed upon the the brothers who worked with him to look after him and so he had just finished praying for a young girl named Morgan who was in the hospital and that's where we left off and in that particular scene it were so thankful that the Lord healed her three days after his prayer and she was able to return to school so now we're in the fall of 46 there came a time later that fall of 1946 when Bill realized he could not sustain such a constant effort indefinitely he decided that after the eight nights scheduled for Jonesboro Arkansas he would take some time off Reverend Reed sponsored the Jonesboro campaign organizing an of local churches to cooperate together they rented the largest auditorium in the city still there was not nearly enough room to seat all the people who came thousands upon thousands drove in from all over the South and Midwest for 50 miles around Jonesboro not one empty hotel or motel room could be found those who could not find other lodging slept in tents or under trucks or in their cars an estimate by the local newspaper pegged the crowd at 28,000 strong when a meeting started many thousands were left standing outside auditorium hoping for a chance to get inside they all began the first service in Jonesboro with his usual down-home greeting if ever you're you're in need just call me and if I possibly can I'll come to you rain or shine or if you're near Jeffersonville Indiana stop by and see me I live near my church on a street and Penn Street I love you and I'll do anything I can to help you then bill made a brave declaration because this will be my last week in Arkansas for a while I intend to stay right here at the pulpit until every last sick person has come through the prayer line about this time bill noticed a woman sitting near the front waving at him energetically is there something I can do for your sister he asked don't you recognize me she said with a big grin on her face no I don't believe I do the last time you saw me was in Little Rock they tell me that my legs were all bloody and I was out of my head now bill did recognise her it was the woman he had prayed for in the basement of the Little Rock Civic Auditorium just a few months ago she was so insane that she had kicked the glass out of the back seat of a car and had crawled across the basement floor on her back now she sat calmly with her husband and their four children seated beside them her husband testified after you prayed for her that night she sat quietly in the car all the way back to the institution within three days they declared her completely well and let her come home starting the service was such a dramatic testament he calls the faith of the audience to soar into heavenly expectations they watched as a sign in bills hands supernaturally revealed diseases and they marveled when they saw how Bill's quiet prayer chain situation soon nothing seemed impossible forming a line to Bill's right the people streamed forward for prayer like a river that never ran dry hour after hour they came as soon as one person that received prayer and sat down someone else got out of a seat and joined the end of the line the crowd gained the inescapable feeling that Jesus Christ stood near this small man on the platform and everyone wanted a turn in Christ's presence demeaning simply did not in bill prayed all night for the sick pausing occasionally to have a drink of orange juice sometime in the wee hours of the morning he lay down beside the pulpit in that poor few hours when he woke up the organist was still playing softly only believe only believe all things are possible only believe and the prayer line was still in place with the next patient waiting her turn for prayer bill took his meals beside the pulpit so he could continue to pray for the sick throughout the day those who were lucky enough to have gotten inside the auditorium on the first day were now reluctant to leave many of them kept their seats day after day sending someone out to bring back sandwiches when they got hungry they also telephoned friends and relations to tell them about the fantastic move of God they were watching and to urge them to come see the miracles for themselves this calls more people to come to Jonesboro throughout the week those outside the auditorium waited patiently in a long confused line by the front door hoping for a chance to enter slowly very very slowly the line inch forward as people inside the auditorium trickled out allowing a few more people on the outside to trickle in when people came out they would describe the amazing miracles that were happening inside few of the people in the line outside the building ever left the area even when during the middle of the week it began to rain night and day bill prayed for an unending line of sick and afflicted the miracles flows just as inexhaustibly one morning about four o'clock a 35 year old woman came up before bill in the prayer line holding a handkerchief over her nose with her left hand bill assumed she was weeping when she held her right hand with his left vibrations revealed her disease he said you've got cancer have a new lady the woman took her left hand away from her face she had no nose at all the cancer had already devoured it do you believe ask bill her voice trembled with desperation brother Brennan I've got to believe it's my only hope then sister I can help you because the angel that's it that that met me said if I would be sincere and if I could get the people to believe me then nothing would stand before my prayer not even cancer as bill prayed in the name of Jesus Christ he let himself feel for the desperate plight of this doomed young woman soon the ferocious throbbing in his arm disappeared in he knew she was healed on the eighth and final evening of the jonesboro campaign bill interrupted the constant prayer line long enough to go down to the train station and meet his wife they had not seen each other for months she had come to be with him for the last evening service of the jonesboro campaign and then she would accompany him back to Jeffersonville for his much-needed rest when they drove to the auditorium they had to stop and park many blocks away from their destination the streets and parking lots were crammed with cars trucks bicycles in tents bill and maida walked toward the auditorium finally made us saw the huge crowd waiting outside the building many holding newspapers over their heads to shield themselves from the drizzle even though bill had described this to her on the phone she was not prepared for the reality Billy that all these people come to hear you know he answered they came to see Jesus made us slipped her hand into his and sank they come from the east and west they come from the lands afar to feast with the king to dine as his guests how blessed these pilgrims are bill jointer beholding his Howard face aglow with light divine blessed partakers of His grace as gems in his crown to shine bill had never been much of a singer his voice tended to be raspy and he had difficulty keeping a tune but he loved the sing together he and made us sang the

imagine brother are if I told you in Manaus is the most precious thing que si le dijo que la cosa Preciosa that Christ gave us que Crees inácio is the very life is la propiedad ah his own life su propia vida which is everlasting el cual is aterna oh man what do you think about that no no keep in today is pretty powerful we put it also for that it's it's it's hard to put into a mental concept because we're we're living beings right is the vasila panera no concept of mental por que somos hermanos and and and we've never we've never we've never we've never died in nunca hemos marido right but you know maybe later on but okay sighs yeah this place will talk a little bit of how it feels to to die is that mo Salomon poco the conversation today murid to the desires allows the sails of our flesh then Nostra Karan and it hurts right II literally what about and that's a form of dying yes soon anyway memory anyway do you guys have Ephesians 5:5 up yeah didn't and face your sink alright can you come up and read it for me Bernie it's just five one into if it's your single only dose be he therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour said way Samhita Dora's adios como hijos a mouse and ah de Namur come Tammy increase oh no Sam oh yes entrega assamese manipuri nosotros o friend a sacrificios of us in O Lord frag aunty alright alright so so the scripture here IC k let's do that and in the first part it's telling us to therefore be imitators of who in a preeminent part and OCC said play scimitar is a king of Christ right they crossed over that ideals right can I ask Chris Chris do you mind if I ask you with the word imitators means you know
