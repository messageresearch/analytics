some toast let's talk about this what's going on but didn't even get to know each other what oh I'm so glad that God is not a respecter of persons but he can see inside your heart hallelujah and so what happened was that she was praying for a little baby and God came as a little baby he was a prophet Samuel and her promise was God if you give me a baby I'll give him back to you so he can serve you all the days of his life and he did it's beautiful testimony anything you ask God for with all your heart if you're sincere and you come the right way he will listen to your player [Music] is she really here the one marry the one who stressed like that Fred well didn't you see that girl she was being so mean to me yeah I saw that yeah well it seems that I don't dress like them and and and and I don't talk like them I I don't cut my hair I love my hair Oh beaut but and I don't have face girl I don't have scripture ground so so they treat you yeah oh well what do you like to do hmm well I like hearing the stories that my father tells me about the scriptures and then in there when we walk to the temple but we passed by the market and you smell but then of course we go to the temple oh and we pray I have a feeling that there are a lot of girls will feel the way you do but I do serve the Lord and I love him but does he really notice me Mary do not be afraid Mary for I bring a message to you from the Lord don't be afraid Mary I'm Gabriel he has news for you saying that you would have a baby boy you see the Lord has want me to sent you has sent me to tell you that you're blessed and that you are highly favored amongst women this boy will be called Jesus and he shall be called counselor Prince of Peace and he shall be the son of the Almighty God whoa well but wait how can that be if I'm not even married marry this won't be a baby of your own this baby will come from God the Holy Ghost will come into your womb you will over shout on you and you will have this baby well if you say it's from God then according to his will [Music] how am I gonna tell my mom yes oh my god I have to go [Music] that's some faith brother you know who else have see Jesus was very impressed by this woman's faith amongst the children have mercy on me O Lord my daughter she's vexed with a devil do you not realize that the bread that belongs to the children of Israel does not belong to the dogs yes Lord but even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall off the master's table go in peace hey it was something commendable and what would you do if Jesus called you a talk but she knew who she was and she knew that God had come for specific people but she humbled herself she didn't say oh no you didn't I'm gonna go to the doctor then oh no she said yes Lord I know I'm a dog but even the dogs can eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table let me throw away my pride rip it up into a million pieces and just so we can be humble you know let's go I know the oil in there [Music] look it's ten versions five were wise and five were foolish they look exactly the same I don't know the only way you can tell is by how much oils they haven't sorry laughs OH so we'll see right now cuz it looks the same in they're all asleep mm-hmm passed out the nyquil the pariah the foolish and the wise are all asleep it's time to wake up wake up they won't why not because the scripture says when the messenger comes by declaring the bride ready the bridegroom cometh get your lamps trimmed and ready the bridegroom cometh so there's a big wedding party and they were all invited so they're waiting for this message so they can go to the wedding party and finally they woke up so the ones that had oil they went happily to the wedding party while the others who didn't have oil they frantically went looking for oil but there was not to be found [Applause] [Music] that's what happens we follow sleeping we didn't fill our oil lord help us fill our lamps with oil and that's the revelation of the word that's the Holy Ghost inside of us shining the very life of the Lord Jesus Christ they were all so pure so they didn't they had the same Word of God they had the same clothes but the difference was the oil I need to have that oil my love me too new phrase we all do Amen if you want oil in your lap can you sing give me oil in my lap keep me burning give me oil in my lap I pray give me oil in my lap keep me
