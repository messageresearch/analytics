TRANSCRIPT
========================================
once again we are gathered in this place and we plead for your help may your word be our food this morning and thereby glorify you as we see the revelation of your word i pray that you part imparted unto us in your infinite mercy in the name of the lord jesus christ amen let's open up our bibles to the book of ephesians chapter 4 verse 30. it reads and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption this morning i greet each and every one of you with a brotherly greeting trusting that it be god that blesses us through his word last night i didn't see the sister sister foster and we welcome her also she arrived yesterday each one of you that have come this morning somewhere around there i saw brother lopez a few moments ago there is we're happy that he's come back with us well well-being he was traveling in mexico and he's now returned we're happy happy with uh that each and every one of you are doing well like brother mike that uh he's also arrived from el paso and with him and his family there are so many brothers that uh that are moving during these days and it's difficult brothers for them and for us but i believe that god will help us in all things before we begin with the word i want to bring or read a little note that was uh given to me from the prayer room on a prophecy for assigned by brother burunda and brother campo it reads like this behold i have a tremendous work of blessing a tremendous blessing upon this place i ask you to glorify my name in this place and to honor me watch for the works of the devil amen thus saith the lord therefore let's pray to god for the brother brothers that are there they're not looking for gifts but there should they should be people with gifts so it we just need a little bit of time and instruction so that they can start settling down and and being in the right place where the way the prophet brought us i'm going to continue the message in adoption this is number 30. i'm going to need about 10 minutes uh extra and uh i'm going to limit myself to an hour brothers an hour with five minutes and then i will be closing this teaching last sunday or or the last time i preached on adoption when i preached number 29 we were talking about uh how it is that the lamb took the book and gave it then to the seventh angel as we consider closely all of these things that the prophet says and what the bible teaches it takes us to the same grounds of those things that we have preached in times past and as i consider them from a different angle i can understand why it is that many people get tangled during this time you see the prophet said that if we don't balance the things or put the things on the balance you are going to fall into an error that's the reason why it is so nest the teaching is so necessary that the people settle down and stay nice and quiet and hear with precaution with uh slowly what is being spoken and then write it down and then you go home and you read it again so that it could be a thing that will anchor within our hearts as a revelation [Music] in order to enter the certain things i want to go into i i need to just review a little bit not forgetting that we are in the message adoption and i need to read certain parts of the prophet uh therefore the thought that i'm taking is the title uh uh speaking on how it is that we're gods we've talked about how we are gods we've spoken on that much now brother campo if you're a god and brother udiel is a god do you believe that you're god's brothers then you have to get to that a man totally surrendered to god is a and as a son of god is a god therefore the other thing is that we don't want to put everything into one bundle because the mistake is that you take a bag or a bun a bag let's say this is a bag and everything that the prophet says you put into the same bag you do that you're going to go to an extreme and you're going to fail or you're going to make a mistake but if you take another bag and you take everything and put it into that bag you're also going to fail and i believe that that's where the error is at there's two bags and everyone just throws everything in one bag consider what i'm saying if brother camp and brother are gods and the prophet said it we put all of that in one bag but if they're gods and then there is a major god on earth on earth and that is the prophet so let's place what corresponds to the prophet in a different bag you see that so if you don't do that sooner or later you're going to put the prophet in the place of the lord jesus christ because there's much message there's many messages to back that up but the worker the labor of god knows should know how to rightly divide the word and place the thing in its appropriate bag so seeing that we're speaking about gods i would like to turn the corner now begin to turn the corner to speak a little bit on the major god on the earth now the supreme god is the lord jesus christ but there should be a major god on earth and i would like to say that that major god in this century is the prophet of the age william branham so speaking on that i would like to try to explain what corresponds or what belongs to the lamb now you know what the prophet said i've read it and i'm going to read it again where the prophet says that the book of redemption let's say that this is the book of redemption which is the revelation of the seven seals the revelation that jesus christ brought through a man this book of redemption when man sinned that title that title deed or of the inheritance returned to god but then jesus christ came and died to pay the price and in this 20th century the lamb came he took the book of redemption the lamb took it and he said this book is mine therefore when he did this he gave it to the prophet he gave it to william branham and he said william branham here here it is so that you can bring it to my gods so that you can bring it to my people and i want you to preach it but in reality he was representing the lamb here on earth in reality he was representing the lamb here on earth and being like this now you're going to help me the brothers that have been listening to the tape you're going to help me and you're going to answer right so that the audience uh has time to think about it now the word redeem the word redeem means what does it mean can you help me it means to buy to buy back to it goes back to the owner to go back to the to buy back that which was lost is that right and so in order for there to be redemption you need a redeemer is that right brothers now notice i want you to take this very seriously in a just in a quiet way so that in order for there to be redemption there needs to be a redeemer very well well let's place here a redeemer okay so then the bible speaks of a day of redemption therefore if there's a day of redemption so that that day can be the redeemer has to make himself present because the redeemer has to come on that day of redemption now the bible speaks of it and mentions it as the day of christ and it also mentions it as the day of redemption now if the prophet how many believe that the prophet william branham is our absolute in this time now if the prophet william branham said this he said jesus christ does not put his foot on the earth you see how easy it is for people to make a mistake because the one that's going to be present on the day of redemption has to be the redeemer but since jesus christ does not set foot on the earth he has to send a representative therefore in this day of redemption it's jesus christ who is our redeemer but in reality the one that you see is william branham that's the reason why and this is the reason because we've already read it last sunday i believe that the lamb went to the throne where god was sitting and he had the book at his right hand and he took the book and the lamb said this book is mine i purchased it i redeemed it i am the redeemer and then he tore open the seals and gave them to the seventh angel therefore when the seventh angel stands here on earth and says the lamb took the book the lamb opened the book the lamb spoke the book and then he says i was the one that opened it therefore if you don't know how to rightly divide the word you begin to worship william branham but you have to know how where to turn the corner i believe that the prophet uh uh deciphers and tells us all of these things in order if we could just only open up our spiritual hearing are you ready brothers very well let's begin to read in the book of the seals i'm going to read in spanish page 83 and in english i believe it's i wrote it there so you can read it at home page 103 in english it reads like this the law of god required a kinsmen redeemer and the lamb came out courageously saying i am your kinsmen redeemer i am your redeemer i have already interceded for them and now i have come to claim the rights i have paid the price he says there was no one that could do this it says therefore the lamb came directly to the right hand of god and he took the book from his hand and claimed all the rights i have been slain for them i am their kinsmen redeemer i am the mediator my blood was shed and i've come to be man and i did all of this to redeem once again that church that i had seen before the foundation of the world i have decreed it and i have spoken it saying that it would be there in that day no one could take the book but i came down and i took the book myself i am your kinsman and he took the book is that right so then we see that the lamb the one that died he's the one that took the book is that right brothers now i'm going to read page 90 91 in spanish and page 90 in spanish and in english it's page 111 the prophet says this oh you talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked forth see the books even sealed in heaven you say is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that redemption was the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book he opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people therefore there is no doubt or of why we should doubt that the book stayed in was left in the hands of william branham and now what the prophet spoke on that very clearly very well so then if william branham received the book we're going to begin to turn the corner brother agrippino turning the corner so that you can so that you can see why it is that the people fail seals page 62 in english page 78 he says now hold that word forgive me brothers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day until the day of your redemption were sealed for a certain day and that day is the day of redemption very well now back to what brother bran was saying hold that word redemption until hold that word redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the redeemer comes to claim his possession nothing can do it or tear open that seal see grieve not the holy spirit say do the things that pleases god for the book is sealed now and you are sealed the holy spirit itself is the seal seal signifies now this is words i got from the dictionary seal signifies a finished work in other words if you're sealed you're sealed until the thing is finished on continue reading seals page 63 79 in english we are following that day of redemption now notice brother branham says this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of redemption again again in romans 8 22 and 23 let's get that and we'll get that background then i think we'll understand it a little better and so for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaileth and pained together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting waiting for the adoption that is to say the redemption of our body oh my oh my don't that make us old folks feel good it ought to make us all feel good waiting for this hour we understand this will take place at the first resurrection glory therefore perhaps i i spelled the wrong i spell i spelled the spanish word wrong primera first see that's why people on occasions well not the people but satan he hates teaching because it isn't hard we're seeing that a day of redemption is coming and that day of redemption is the first resurrection and that is when the redeemer makes himself present now notice the redeemer makes himself present now but first of all the first thing and we just read it is that the first thing that represents that redemption you know i read it in english page 111 he says it's that the lamb took the book opened the book tore the seals and he sent it to the earth that's the first thing that happens the second thing that happens is that the redeemer is presents himself here on earth so that the day of redemption redemption can come see now this is flesh brothers now just settle down now and we're going to see it through the word let's read in the seals page 470 in spanish and in english 562. it reads like this the prophet is speaking about when the sword fell in his hand and he said that this this sword was very precious and that it just fit his hand exactly you see he knew how to use it because it fit him well how many of you remember that the bible says that uh that they were they tried to put on on david king david the armor of saul he said well this doesn't fit me it didn't fit him it was too big so david went with the instrument that god had given him which was a slingshot and five little smooth stones which stand for grace means grace and he didn't need all five stones he just needed one because god is one you see but in this 20th century he didn't bring a slingshot to the prophet he brought him a sword and he placed it in his hand so that there would be no mistake to whom it belonged therefore not only does he give him the sword but when the prophet receives the sword he comes out of the trance or the vision or whatever it was he comes out of it and he says a representative of a king cannot go with a sword unless he's dressed or has his garments his vestures can you imagine her brother roberto if he would have stood here on friday when he got married there's the bride beautifully dressed and he would have he would have on a a a potato sack as a suit that wouldn't look right right he came with his suit his groom's suit so we're gonna see where the suit is at because the suit has to be around there somewhere when a deep is calling another deep then there has to be a deep to answer so if you feel something in your heart and your heart is crying out for more of god let me tell you that there's something more for you from god when the prophet on a certain occasion they asked the prophet brother branham i want you to pray for me because i made such and such and such a sin and then the devil comes and he accuses me and i want you to pray so that i can be free the prophet answered i don't need to pray for the word is the one that absolves you of all sin you see the only thing you have to do is to come and believe the word now if there's something in you that is crying out for forgiveness then there has to be forgiveness for you therefore when there's something that is crying within us for something the prophet said it's that there's something out there that will answer that cry the prophet said when there's a question there has to be an answer perhaps we might not know the answer but the answer is there somewhere now i'm going to read where the prophet speaks of when he receives the sword the prophet says he says and at that moment a voice thundered throughout that canyon and shook and and that rocked the rocks and said it's the sword of the king and then i come out of it when he heard this the prophet was not we could say like this in his five natural senses he was outside of these five senses he was elevated with god and when he heard this word because there was a great thundering that went through the canyon that was in sabino canyon it thundered through the canyon and then the voice spoke and said this is the king sword or the sword of the king i'm gonna hold there i read it a few minutes ago you can read it at home brother branham says the first thing that this represents is so there's a first thing in order for the day of redemption to come first of all the plan of redemption must be revealed so that god brings that message so that there can be a people which we are which will receive this revelation because it is impossible notice what i'm saying it is impossible according to the law of god that god using a prophet bring all things to fulfillment because you also need a woman to receive the seed which is the word of god and there has to be somewhere around there has to be a people perhaps we might not be it but under the heavens there has to be a people that receive the word all the word that god brought in this time so that the second part can come about which is the day of redemption or what we call the resurrection from the dead notice he says the voice said this is the sword of the king and then i came to myself now if he would have said the king of the sort of of a king there's only one king and that's god this is the sword of the king there's only one the king and that's god and he has only one sword and that's his word which i live by now it's really clear i'm going to stop there for a moment so that the people can get this so then the sword is the word very simple may god help me bring on his holy vesture with his holy word lane here it's the word amen now in english the prophet says may god help me bring on his holy vesture so william branham did not did william branham does not bring he says bring it on bring on your holy vestures because the one that has the vesture or the garment is god because william branham seeing himself with the sword he says in order for me to be able to execute or carry out that sword and execute it in its totality i need to be dressed with this holy gesture now you can review this at home with time and you can see in revelation in in chapter 17 of saint matthew that there was a claim made there you know and the declaration came from peter and he he declared oh the thing here is tremendous i believe that uh it would be good for us to make here three tabernacles or one for you and another one for moses and another one for elias but then suddenly elias and moses disappeared and there came a voice when that cloud came down and the cloud covered the lord jesus christ his face shone as the sun then you could hear the voice say this is my beloved son hear ye him therefore when the prophet receives this sword he says bring on his holy vestures i already have the sword but i need to be dressed and he's taken to a mount also he's taken to mount sunset and god sends from eternity his word now you call that the cloud i call it cloud but that cloud was formed by seven angels they came and they lifted william branham up into the midst of that constellation of angels and they covered him that cloud is the logos that came out of god so then then if he covers it and dresses him then he says now my son can go down and take this message of the seven seals because i've given him the sword and i have dressed him with my holy vestures i continue reading brother brown says oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and secret when this left me something came to me and said don't fear now i didn't hear no voice tremendous huh i didn't hear no voice but something on the inside of me spoke i have to tell you the truth just exactly what happened this was so tremendous that it from the mouth of god it couldn't come the word couldn't come from the mouth of god to william branham to the ear of william brown because the time had come where it was william branham completely the mouth of god and to be the mouth of god then it has to be god inside that veil that's why he says he says i didn't hear the voice coming from the outside but something within me inside of me it's that the inside of him in the in that compartment of the heart of william branham enthroned on his throne was the lord jesus christ so that the voice would not come out from mouth to ear but from within a man that voice would speak so that no one else could receive or touch that word because in the beginning that's where the fall that's why the fall happened the word of god was taken by the serpent and he he was he fiddled with it and the word of god cannot be touched by human hands it has to be god himself speaking so that it can be his unadulterated word now consider the prophet continues reading now i didn't hear no voice it was like something on inside of me spoke i just have to tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit me something hit and said don't fear this is that third pool third pool you remember it he said you've had so many impersonators on this what you tried to explain but said don't even try this don't even try to explain this do you remember it brother branham says how many remembers that vision why it's it's it's all over the tape and everywhere that's been about six seven years ago and he said don't try to explain that said this is the third pool but i will meet you in there can you say man brothers now i'm gonna go to another message the message is uh what was the holy spirit given for the prophet says now notice here's another thing i'd like to say right here jesus said as the father hath has sent me as the father has sent me so send i you very well open up your bible so that we can read the scriptures so you can see that what the prophet is quoting it is correct it says in saint john chapter 20 verse 21. uh he's quoting um the the scripture by memory and and now you keep that scripture open so that when uh when i repeat it again uh you'll have it there the scripture reads like this saint john 20 21. then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you is that right is that what scripture the prophet is speaking or quoting yes well now let's see the interpretation of that scripture the prophet said he said there's three things that you should not do that's dislocate the word it's to take it out of its place uh misplace the word put it where it doesn't belong and you must not misinterpret the word because god is his own interpreter isn't that what the prophet said but then he also said that a prophet is the divine interpreter of the divine word therefore when the prophet it gives us the explanation of what the scripture means if you and i say anything contrary then we are misinterpreting the scripture we should repeat exactly how he said it very well he continues reading now notice here's another thing i like to say brother branham says jesus said as the father has sent me now watch as the father has sent me so send i you as the father how did the father send him the father that sent him come down from heaven and dwelt in him he went forth he said i always do that which pleases my father see he went about doing the things that the father was showing him to do and he said i do nothing except my father chose me first the god that sent him was on the inside of him very simple very easy the fa the god that sent him was on the inside of him and as the father sent me the same in other words the same way that the father has sent me so send i you so i send you what is it this is god in you in us caring on what the same works the same works that jesus did jesus said he that believeth he that has me on the inside of him so the one that believeth has jesus inside of him the holy spirit now we believe him to to the degree that belongs to us but we can't believe like william branham because look brother i i want you to make sure that you know what i'm speaking of the prophet brought discernment and and and he would always take us to saint john chapter four and he would repeat and repeat and he would say he say once again the scene is repeated again here's a woman just as the samaritan woman was there he says i i'm unknown to this person and she doesn't know me and then he would begin to bring forth what was in the heart of the woman that he was praying for the prophet said this is the last sign that the world receives is that right brothers i don't want you to fail in this there is no other man it's not not brother garcia that can come with that sign of the messiah like the prophet did i want it to soak in right there's only one man could do all of the works one man i'm not talking about a group or a church i'm speaking about one man because the church can bring certain things into operation and i'll touch on that but one man i can't do it without you and you can't do it without me as a local church but this man william branham didn't need anyone because he had believed and within him god was there the same god that walked here 2 000 years ago came back to the earth in the body of william marion branham now and i read it didn't i i'll read it again oh i i can see your thoughts oh brother garcia sure is adding a whole bunch no no no it's not brother garcia he says he that believeth is he that has me on the inside of him the holy spirit he that believeth that's already witnessed my resurrection who showed us that jesus christ is alive william branham came and he had to go throughout the entire history he went through malachi's and hosea micah jeremiah isaiah daniel joel and he went to moses and he went beyond that into eternity and he brought jesus out of history and he presented him alive amongst us he said he's alive and to prove that he's alive your name is sanchez and you live on that lincoln street i've never seen you but to prove to you your father's name is such and such who was doing that was it william branham no it was god enthroned inside that man but you should rightly divide the word and discern one thing from the other so that you don't fall into error not only did he only do that but when that child was dead there in finland because the son does nothing unless the father shows him first is that right so when the the prophet would say he says you know you see me waiting so then people thought the william branham didn't have any authority or that he didn't he had no way to move but he was saying clearly that he couldn't do anything until everything was placed correctly in its order because he was an obedient son he was not clowning around for anyone you see he said write it on the fly leafs of your bible and when the moment came that they arrived to where that child was there that had been killed by an automobile when he saw that it was the babe a child he told brother moore he says hold on now i'm going to go to the mountain to pray and to fast to see what god is going to tell me or he he went to the telephone and he called jeffersonville and he said hey listen i need all the church to be praying that's not what he did he said watch if it doesn't happen he went to the people he says now if this boy isn't resurrected from the dead then you can cast me out of your nation i challenge anyone i challenge garcia or coleman or any other man to do this just one man can do this he said cast me out and then he says when he says that the spirit that was in him the spirit that was within brother branham came out and he went and he brought that other spirit back and put him inside that child that child was resurrected what is that he that believeth has me inside of him brother how could he not lift resurrect the dead if if it was jesus christ himself living in him he said i am the resurrection and alive brother i don't have to trust in no one else as long as i trust where god is at i trust completely if i trust then i am in the day of redemption i continue reading he that believeth and that's already witnessed my tech resurrection and know that i'm in him tremendous no there's many people that don't even know if they've been born again but he knew when he challenged those ministers in chicago he says why don't you stand over here on my right side to challenge me they knew better that they would stay that they would die there he says he says and know that i'm in him he that's in me and if you bite in me my words abide in you the word of the lord comes to the prophet is that right well i'm gonna go to another part paragraph 74. is that too heavy too much meat for you brothers is the steak too big should we leave it alone are you noticing brother raymond listen closely that's why the people say accuses of being crazy paragraph 74 and it'll take you to the scripture that we've been reading 20 messages mark 11 23 says say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said's going to come to pass it's not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you he do with the talking now i didn't hear no voice but like on the inside of me something spoke it's the father that's to speak oh brothers if the revelation doesn't come down with this i don't know when it'll ever come down to you it is the father that's to speak it's not you that's speaking to the mountain it's not you talking to that mountain it it'll be the father that's in you speaking to that mountain and then it that mountain has to move all heavens and earth will pass away he said but my spirit shall not pass away or my word shall not pass away so it has to be fulfilled exactly as it's written do you believe it brothers paragraph 43 he's speaking about a birth so as i don't read everything he says when a birth came brother brown says the next thing happened there come a birth into that home that's when the holy spirit another spirit came in which was a son that son he was not in full charge neither was he an heir until he got a certain age and he had to be proved first yes and then they had the law of adoption to you ministers the placing i'm speaking about the placing of a son is what i'm speaking of now see then when he come to a place to where he was adopted page 15 paragraph 47 and then when this boy got to a certain age say let's let's say that he was matured if that boy was just a renegade no good didn't care for the father's business all he thought about was uh flirting and running with the women's or drinking or gambling or horse racing that boy would always be a son but he was never placed in position to have air to all his father had let me remind you when when brother roy robertson was there at the table of the lord he said brother branham you were set at the head of the table the main one you were placed there at the head of the table isn't that right amen now notice now but if he was a good boy and he was always about the father's business and he proved to be the right child then they had a ceremony out there on the street they took the boy out into the street and put a white robe on him it was more whiter than the cloud and they set him on a scaffold so all the city could see after that they made a feast and the feast already happened and then afterwards a jubilee in other words a rapture oh blessed be the name of the lord you see i'm waiting for that jubilee brothers and the father then had the ceremony brought about the ceremony of adoption he adopted his own son into his own business and then the son was co-equal with his father do you believe it brothers should i repeat it again he was co-equal he had the same right the son had the same rights as the father can you say amen to this brothers now i'm going to read a few more paragraphs more and i'm just going to be jumping can you come to the piano and do the organs so that i can begin to close so that i can uh keep my promise brothers the prophet is speaking here on marriage or divorce and marriage or marriage and divorce and here it everything this is covered by all this is covered this covers all of those that don't want to obey certain things just because they live in phoenix or live in jeffersonville the prophet says this now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from god and by vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far should not god upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives and live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up but don't you dare try to do it again i'm speaking only to my congregation brother branham says but if you're married and god bore me witness of that that on that mountain that i could say this a supernatural revelation because of the opening of the seven seals and this is a question in god's word he's god told them let them go on in as they are and sin no more who's speaking it was the father inside the vessel that he had or has here on earth who can forgive sins only god can do it just as the father has sent me i send you when jesus said your sins which are many have been forgiven they said who can forgive sins only god can forgive sins and how can this man forgive sins they didn't know that the father had come down from heaven he came down from glory and was living in the tabernacle called jesus christ and in this 20th century as the father has sent me i send you jesus christ came down in the prophet and he's saying the same things that jesus had said over 2000 years ago page 50. he says now i'm speaking only to my congregation friends and then i'm closing you can go from this now i'm speaking to our followers only who is following me and this message only not the outside this is this is only for my congregation he said over here but over here he says this is only for those that follow my message there's another climax coming brothers there's very few that hadn't the lord jesus christ told the prophet there's another tabernacle this is not your tabernacle and he took him to go see a great cathedral there's a second climax coming blessed be the name of the lord this is not your tabernacle he says but this is only for those that follow my message you see brothers there perhaps there's a congregation in phoenix and another congregation in some other city but not all are following the message that god brought this is for those that follow the message that william branham brought brother that's where the authority is at to forgive sins to restore you brothers because the day of redemption is at hand and the prophet said it in two messages that i can quote the statue of a perfect man the message of the second appearing of elijah shall sweep the earth the bride he says has not yet had her uh her revival and when is this gonna happen he says when the hour has counted down to zero when their time shall be no more the prophet says when this happens is when the director then moves his conduct his wand and he says time is no more and then it returns and then countdown begins seven six that's the resurrection seven six five four three two one and then the bride gathered in palestine and the man there dressed with god's holy vestures with us sword in his hand and around him the entire bride of jesus christ is around him it is a day of redemption it is the resurrection it's the day that i'm waiting trusting totally in the sacrifice of jesus christ but jesus christ in his mercy the lamb took the bump open the book tore the seals and he gave the title deed to william branham and that's where i'm waiting i'm trusting in that that's where i put all of my faith not in my own righteousness but in the sacrifice of jesus christ who has done all of this possible don't you love him brothers let us pray oh help your people make yourself alive in us help us lord to be able to receive all of the word that has come out of your mouth thank you lord amen and amen uh you
