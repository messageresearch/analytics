[43:28] the same
[43:30] today the same Wonders that he did in

[43:42] change he's
[43:44] faithful and he stays faithful with
[43:48] us we have to come

[43:54] him amen
[43:56] amen we'll be praying for

[44:02] have
[44:04] read every need that you have in your
[44:06] heart if you can raise your
[44:09] hand and if you cannot raise your
[44:13] hand just give your heart to
[44:16] him truly that is what he's seeing we'll
[44:20] be
[44:23] praying the same way we be praying for
[44:25] the tithing and the offering
[44:27] [Music]
[44:34] Lord

[45:06] [Music]
[45:09] you but I'm still holding on to your
[45:12] powerful hand that holds
[45:13] [Music]
[45:14] me like in those
[45:17] days seeing that
[45:19] neighbor with their thin
[45:23] hands and still raising them up she had
[45:28] cancer they only gave her a few days of
[45:32] life but you had mercy
[45:34] [Music]
[45:37] Lord you moved the heart of Mercy
[45:40] Lord and you came down to the
[45:44] scene and now we see our neighbor
[45:47] walking
[45:49] eating
[45:51] laughing doing
[45:54] exercises how beautiful you are Lord
[45:59] to know that you answer our
[46:03] prayers Lord God for our sister
[46:07] Francis that has brought her
[46:09] Petition of
[46:11] [Music]
[46:13] cancer I believe you're the same
[46:15] yesterday today and forever
[46:17] Lord and if she In This
[46:19] Moment wherever she is
[46:22] at can raise her
[46:25] hands and believe in her
[46:28] heart that all is possible to him that
[46:32] believes that in the name of the Lord
[46:34] Jesus
[46:36] Christ re that demon of
[46:39] cancer and we declare her
[46:43] healed completely
[46:47] delivered and each one of the needs that

[46:51] exposed we pray in the name of the Lord
[46:54] Jesus Christ believing
[46:57] with all of our
[46:59] hearts that you will answer each one of
[47:04] them because since the moment they
[47:06] placed their
[47:08] need they were believing
[47:11] Lord come down to the
[47:13] SE at each one of their
[47:16] hearts and permit them to

[56:34] with your
[56:35] mercy let us forfeit our rights
[56:39] Lord may we be Lambs before
[56:43] you just like you were the Great
[56:47] lamb those characteristics have to
[56:49] follow your
[56:53] Believers father we want to be like you

[57:04] Hearts agapy

[57:11] Today help us Lord to do your
[57:15] will lead us and guide us today
[57:19] father as I Lord put myself into your
[57:23] hands may you bless the people today
[57:28] our purpose to come here
[57:30] today is only to
[57:34] Echo of the word of
[57:36] God that has been brought to us through
[57:39] a prophet of
[57:41] God and he said I am the voice of God
[57:44] for this
[57:47] generation and we are the echo of that
[57:52] word we don't have a
[57:55] message
[57:56] we only repeat what the prophet of God
[58:00] said we have thth the
[58:04] Lord but because it came from the
[58:07] prophet of
[58:08] God now help us to line up with the word
[58:10] of
[58:12] God we want to abide by every
[58:16] word not just part of the
[58:19] word but all the
[58:22] word now help us today Lord in our
[58:25] endeavor
[58:26] we surrender everything to
[58:28] you may everyone be blessed today in the
[58:31] name of the Lord Jesus
[58:35] Christ greet you in the name of the Lord
[58:37] Jesus
[58:41] Christ before we get
[58:44] started I want to read you a
[58:48] quot and uh it's the reason I read this
[58:52] code doesn't necessarily have anything
[58:54] to do with the message I'm going to
[58:55] bring
[58:58] today if God permit me to bring the
[59:00] message
[59:02] today but it's in reference to
[59:06] April there's something special about
[59:08] the month of
[59:11] April and I'm just going to read this
[59:13] before we get into the
[59:15] message I hope they can put it up there
[59:18] on the screen so you could all follow
[59:19] along with
[59:21] me thank you very
[59:24] much how many believe
[59:27] that Jesus died on the
[59:30] cross how many believe he
[59:32] died how many believe he rose from the
[59:37] dead when he rose from the dead he is
[59:39] alive
[59:42] today 2,000 years
[59:45] later the holy
[59:48] spirit is on the Earth
[59:50] today making him Jesus
[59:54] Christ the same yesterday today and
[59:58] forever Jesus is
[1:00:01] here in the form of the pillar of
[1:00:04] fire the Holy Ghost is on the Earth
[1:00:08] right
[1:00:09] now seeking
[1:00:11] out his own his
[1:00:16] Souls amen and he did it all because of
[1:00:19] a agapy
[1:00:23] love now let's get into the coat now
[1:00:26] on the road to
[1:00:27] EMAs on the first Easter
[1:00:31] morning when the whole world was In
[1:00:33] Bloom with flowers
[1:00:37] buds the bees are
[1:00:42] humming on that beautiful April
[1:00:47] morning little did the disciple know
[1:00:49] that he he was raised from the
[1:00:54] dead was amongst was among the
[1:01:00] resurrection and as his friend
[1:01:04] Copus and his friend was on the road to
[1:01:08] EMAs very much
[1:01:11] discouraged like
[1:01:13] today many people are
[1:01:16] discouraged many people are
[1:01:19] disappointed they think God is
[1:01:22] dead God is not dead God is
[1:01:27] alive how do you know he's
[1:01:30] alive how do you know that can you say
[1:01:34] like
[1:01:35] me because he lives in my
[1:01:39] heart amen amen but they were pondering
[1:01:43] on the
[1:01:45] scriptures did you notice while they
[1:01:47] were talking on the
[1:01:51] scriptures amen amen isn't that
[1:01:54] beautiful when you talk on the
[1:01:57] scriptures God makes himself
[1:02:00] present and that's what we want his
[1:02:04] presence that's the difference between
[1:02:06] an
[1:02:08] intellectual and a heartfelt
[1:02:11] religion a conviction a revelation in
[1:02:14] your
[1:02:14] heart you know God
[1:02:19] lives and on the road down the darkest
[1:02:22] hour they had ever
[1:02:24] seen
[1:02:27] and every hope
[1:02:28] gone and about that
[1:02:31] time Jesus comes on the
[1:02:33] seene man I love
[1:02:35] that and that repeats
[1:02:38] again in the darkest
[1:02:40] hour when everything fails and goes
[1:02:45] wrong Jesus comes on the
[1:02:48] seene hallelujah
[1:02:51] hallelujah God never
[1:02:53] fails but they didn't know him
[1:02:57] and I'm sure that's the fault of many
[1:02:59] churches
[1:03:01] today Jesus is
[1:03:04] here but they don't know it they don't
[1:03:07] realize
[1:03:08] it oh man isn't it
[1:03:12] awesome isn't that
[1:03:14] substance when brother B
[1:03:16] talks I believe it was God's mouth peace
[1:03:19] to
[1:03:22] us it was a mind of Christ
[1:03:26] was not a mind of a
[1:03:29] man it was God speaking to
[1:03:34] us it never come to its
[1:03:39] end and Jesus is still
[1:03:42] here and people still can see
[1:03:46] him I pray tonight I'm reading the
[1:03:49] quote that he will do something just a
[1:03:52] little different from ordinary religious
[1:03:55] service
[1:03:59] that you've been did you might return
[1:04:02] home like cleopas and the friends from
[1:04:04] the
[1:04:07] Resurrection the first day of the
[1:04:10] Resurrection The Lord Jesus was
[1:04:13] resurrected amongst the people amongst
[1:04:16] the flowers and so
[1:04:18] for on that
[1:04:21] first
[1:04:22] Easter
[1:04:24] April morning
[1:04:27] when he raised from the
[1:04:28] dead when did he rais from the
[1:04:31] dead one April
[1:04:36] morning
[1:04:39] wow May that repeat
[1:04:42] today if you have died to the
[1:04:45] world if you've had a death burial and
[1:04:49] resurrection and if you die you will
[1:04:53] resurrect
[1:04:54] again we should not be afraid of
[1:04:58] death the flesh is afraid
[1:05:01] yeah but inside of our
[1:05:03] soul a Christian does not fear
[1:05:07] death come on
[1:05:12] death it's a way to get out of
[1:05:15] here this is hell oh it's
[1:05:21] not the world's falling
[1:05:24] apart the backbone of
[1:05:28] America is the
[1:05:30] family the families of all falling
[1:05:36] apart
[1:05:38] divorces
[1:05:40] homosexuals
[1:05:41] lesbians it's it's not ju it's not a
[1:05:45] juvenile
[1:05:46] delinquency it's parent
[1:05:52] delinquency and he journeyed and talked
[1:05:55] to the two men
[1:05:57] all day
[1:05:58] long and they still didn't recognize
[1:06:01] him I wonder if that can repeat
[1:06:04] again there's no doubt at
[1:06:07] all but we've
[1:06:09] talked what you've talked to
[1:06:14] you and he kept you from having that
[1:06:19] accident and he saved the baby's
[1:06:22] life and he brought these things in and
[1:06:25] help you to pay off the
[1:06:28] house all these things he
[1:06:30] did but maybe you never recognized
[1:06:34] it to be
[1:06:36] him God is here brother
[1:06:39] sister amen now what we're going to talk
[1:06:44] about
[1:06:45] today I just had to get that out of my
[1:06:48] way has nothing to do with one the
[1:06:51] subject that I'm going to talk about
[1:06:54] today
[1:06:56] and and before I get
[1:06:57] started okay I want to insert a little
[1:07:00] thing
[1:07:02] here uh how many heard brother brandham
[1:07:08] preach do you know how how hard he
[1:07:13] preached raise your hand if you know
[1:07:16] hard okay you talk real
[1:07:20] hard I I don't think I've talked as hard
[1:07:22] as
[1:07:24] him
[1:07:26] and when I have been
[1:07:28] hard I I try to say what brother bam
[1:07:32] said I am a little
[1:07:34] nervous and I'm G to tell you why I'm
[1:07:37] not nervous to get up here in front of
[1:07:41] you that doesn't make me nervous at
[1:07:44] all and it it doesn't make me nervous to
[1:07:46] see how ugly I
[1:07:49] am that doesn't worry me but what
[1:07:52] worries
[1:07:53] me is that I might say something brother
[1:07:55] Ram didn't
[1:07:58] say then I'm in
[1:08:00] trouble with God I I don't know if you
[1:08:03] know it but I'm between a hard spot and
[1:08:05] and and a
[1:08:09] rock I'm under pressure I've got to say
[1:08:12] what he
[1:08:13] said whatever I think is is
[1:08:17] garbage we're trying to repeat what
[1:08:19] brother
[1:08:21] BR so when you look at me and you say
[1:08:23] well look at that's brother Johnny know
[1:08:24] sister brother
[1:08:28] get that out of your M I'm try to say
[1:08:29] what he
[1:08:31] said he brought us the
[1:08:34] message we only Echo what he
[1:08:40] said I'm just going to read you one
[1:08:42] little part
[1:08:44] here I'm quoting brother
[1:08:46] Bram I do not hate
[1:08:49] women no sir they're my sisters we know
[1:08:54] the if you're
[1:08:56] Christian there's Christian
[1:08:59] ladies that uh real
[1:09:03] Christians but we know if there's a good
[1:09:05] woman there's a bad
[1:09:08] woman right and brother B was really
[1:09:11] hard on the
[1:09:14] women he was also hard on the men
[1:09:16] too okay now saying that let's get into
[1:09:20] our subject
[1:09:21] today okay and I've got to still say a
[1:09:23] little bit more things before I really
[1:09:25] get into
[1:09:28] the title today and there's a reason I
[1:09:30] want to speak on
[1:09:32] this brother and sister you got to
[1:09:34] understand one
[1:09:36] thing uh every man of God has to be led
[1:09:39] and directed by
[1:09:43] God I'm not being directed by another
[1:09:47] man I have to be directed by the Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost the Holy Spirit has to
[1:09:53] be how many understand
[1:09:56] I'm not going by what church this church
[1:09:58] and that church and that
[1:10:03] church every Pastor every Minister has
[1:10:06] to be led of
[1:10:08] God and he has to walk that tight
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:15] rope and he has to be
[1:10:17] balanced because if you go to the left
[1:10:19] or the
[1:10:20] right you got extremes you got to be
[1:10:24] balanced and if you're not you're going
[1:10:26] to fall
[1:10:27] off so brother
[1:10:29] brandom the word of God it's it's
[1:10:35] corrective love is
[1:10:37] corrective so don't get mad at
[1:10:41] me if I say something brother R
[1:10:44] said and what I'm trying to express to
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:47] today I wanted it to be
[1:10:49] balanced not one extreme nor the
[1:10:52] other now let's go to the title now
[1:10:56] now I know the the the
[1:10:58] PowerPoint I have an Apple
[1:11:00] computer try to convert it over to the
[1:11:03] regular
[1:11:05] computer and the code is outside the
[1:11:10] frame so they have to help me to make
[1:11:13] them adjust them in each
[1:11:17] slide and sometimes it just doesn't work
[1:11:20] out so if they're having a hard time
[1:11:22] back there it's because it's not their
[1:11:24] fault
[1:11:27] it's not even my fault it's the
[1:11:29] equipment we have but
[1:11:32] we're but the title of the message
[1:11:34] today is the
[1:11:37] husband is the head of the
[1:11:39] house and not the
[1:11:45] boss just that title right there
[1:11:49] huh you like to get yourself in trouble
[1:11:51] don't you
[1:11:54] Johnny
[1:11:58] I'm gonna be honest with
[1:12:04] you I'm GNA turn the corner
[1:12:09] here in the Christian
[1:12:11] Home who is the one that governs or
[1:12:15] rules or rules or that
[1:12:21] Manda
[1:12:22] huh oh wow I'm not getting no
[1:12:30] response the other day I said
[1:12:33] something I have a new
[1:12:38] revelation I even got sisters that back
[1:12:40] me
[1:12:41] up oh brother I'm with
[1:12:43] you and I said I have a new
[1:12:47] revelation my new revelation is is that
[1:12:50] I am
[1:12:52] convinced it's been a conviction to me a
[1:12:54] revelation
[1:12:56] that women are the ones that
[1:13:00] govern or that
[1:13:04] rule did you know that that's against
[1:13:07] the
[1:13:10] word look I'm gonna tell you
[1:13:17] this man shall not live by bread alone
[1:13:19] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:13:21] the mouth of all every
[1:13:24] word I believe in the return of the I
[1:13:27] believe in in in the
[1:13:29] tent but that's not the whole
[1:13:33] message
[1:13:35] notice if
[1:13:40] you are not the head of your
[1:13:44] home you're not going to make
[1:13:49] it if your
[1:13:51] wife tells you what to do and my
[1:13:56] sister you're not going to make
[1:14:01] it what is the Bible
[1:14:04] say the husband is the head of the home
[1:14:07] or no yes or
[1:14:09] no there's a reason
[1:14:12] why he is the
[1:14:15] head but he's not the boss you know what
[1:14:20] the if you don't fulfill the
[1:14:24] requirements the boss can fire you he
[1:14:27] can fire you and he's going to get
[1:14:29] another
[1:14:33] one I believe that a man and a woman get
[1:14:37] married it's not just for a few
[1:14:39] years it's for
[1:14:44] eternity and when you give your your
[1:14:50] vow I said something else because I
[1:14:52] going to say something
[1:14:53] else you know that when a man and a
[1:14:57] woman before they get
[1:14:59] married they should not kiss each other
[1:15:01] in the
[1:15:02] mouth you know
[1:15:05] why because
[1:15:08] potentially they're already having
[1:15:09] sexual sexual
[1:15:11] intercourse what's that they're not even
[1:15:14] married
[1:15:17] yet you're never going to see
[1:15:20] me to kiss my wife out in
[1:15:23] public because it's ax ual
[1:15:26] act the the the sex GLS are thep there's
[1:15:30] sex glands in the
[1:15:34] lips
[1:15:36] okay
[1:15:39] now how many are following me up until
[1:15:41] right
[1:15:41] now this is going to get really hot and
[1:15:44] heavy here
[1:15:49] okay no I'm going to tell you
[1:15:53] something
[1:15:58] brother Bram
[1:16:00] says that when you choose a woman you
[1:16:03] should choose character yes amen is that
[1:16:07] amen
[1:16:09] okay
[1:16:12] uh I knew this before I got
[1:16:17] married I already knew I had already
[1:16:19] heard
[1:16:20] tapes I had heard enough tapes that I
[1:16:22] already knew that I should choose
[1:16:24] character
[1:16:25] not the most the prettiest one the one
[1:16:28] with the most cous the most sexy one no
[1:16:32] no no no no no no
[1:16:34] no
[1:16:37] character that's
[1:16:39] right I knew this
[1:16:43] okay I got one brother when when I was
[1:16:45] thinking thank you brother thank you
[1:16:47] brother appreciate
[1:16:51] it appreciate it
[1:16:53] brother
[1:16:59] when I thought on a
[1:17:02] woman I don't know how this came to
[1:17:06] be but there was brother Bernie was
[1:17:08] there and I was in t in
[1:17:12] Mexico and I was a young
[1:17:16] man so now if I can tell you what I
[1:17:19] believe
[1:17:21] okay let me let me insert something here
[1:17:25] no notice it remind me because lose the
[1:17:28] the thought the thought
[1:17:32] okay oh next
[1:17:34] Sunday I'm going to be right
[1:17:37] here I'm going to preach if if God
[1:17:39] allows me to if God allows me
[1:17:42] to because I'm not going to finish
[1:17:47] today because I want to
[1:17:50] say what brother brandom says okay okay
[1:17:53] now what was I saying oh
[1:17:57] yeah so when when I thought on a
[1:18:01] woman every young man should should get
[1:18:05] married he's not complete if he doesn't
[1:18:07] have his
[1:18:09] wife so then brother Bernie was
[1:18:11] there and brother Bernie
[1:18:14] said in in the
[1:18:17] convention a lot a lot of brother
[1:18:19] brothers and
[1:18:20] sisters so then brother Bernie told
[1:18:23] me you see that one that's over there
[1:18:26] she's the one talk to
[1:18:31] her I'm going to tell you how I
[1:18:36] believe now now before in in the Old
[1:18:41] Testament when Abraham sent
[1:18:44] elzer what to choose a
[1:18:48] bride he knew that Isaac would CH they
[1:18:51] would choose a woman is that right he
[1:18:55] didn't
[1:18:57] choose chose
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:01] her now you think this new generation is
[1:19:04] going to for somebody to choose their
[1:19:07] man or woman for her him no sir sir no
[1:19:13] sir I've told my
[1:19:17] children and what about
[1:19:19] this oh Dad she's too
[1:19:23] ugly okay
[1:19:28] notice that's in the Old
[1:19:31] Testament now I believe
[1:19:33] this I believe that a
[1:19:36] person in this church you don't have to
[1:19:39] believe the way I believe but this is
[1:19:40] how I
[1:19:41] believe but if you're thinking about
[1:19:44] getting married if you're young
[1:19:46] man I should I think I I believe you
[1:19:48] should go with the
[1:19:49] pastor for for him to give you a
[1:19:52] suggestion I did I did it like that
[1:19:58] okay pastor go with an elder or a
[1:20:02] Deon don't go with somebody out in in
[1:20:04] the bar
[1:20:06] hall or a friend there at
[1:20:10] school go with somebody that's a
[1:20:13] Christian balanced that that has a same
[1:20:16] mind it's not
[1:20:19] crazy somebody that that's tempered
[1:20:22] tempered tempered right tempered temp
[1:20:25] did you understand that that's my
[1:20:29] opinion it's my Revelation
[1:20:32] then but I also don't
[1:20:37] oppose I don't force anybody to believe
[1:20:40] the or the way I
[1:20:42] believe now
[1:20:44] notice what
[1:20:46] happened there was a sister that came
[1:20:49] but I'm not going to say who it was and
[1:20:51] she told me Johnny
[1:20:53] Johnny look
[1:20:56] that sister that's over
[1:20:59] there remember brother ber had already
[1:21:01] told me this
[1:21:02] one and the
[1:21:05] sister an elder
[1:21:07] sister look that that sister that's over
[1:21:10] there I said which one which one I
[1:21:13] looked over there and I saw a a little
[1:21:17] heav and and as she looked she she was
[1:21:20] pretty she was she was white white skin
[1:21:24] she was a
[1:21:27] beautiful but if you know how I am I'm
[1:21:29] I'm I'm going to tell you how I am and
[1:21:31] here I'm going to make a
[1:21:33] confession
[1:21:35] I I'm afraid of
[1:21:40] women I was very afraid of women so what
[1:21:43] do you think I I
[1:21:46] did not even with this one the
[1:21:49] brother or the one that the sister told
[1:21:52] I'm not going to go with any of them
[1:21:55] why because I was I was
[1:21:57] afraid for me to stand before a
[1:22:02] girl I was speaking in Tong no I
[1:22:08] can't and then I'd see those big
[1:22:13] eyes forget about
[1:22:17] it so then I did
[1:22:20] something now when you get
[1:22:23] Mar just like my grandfather Pao
[1:22:26] Garcia would say we don't get married in
[1:22:28] the spirit we get married in the
[1:22:32] flesh and I knew that brother brandham
[1:22:35] said look character I knew
[1:22:38] that but
[1:22:41] then came came into me it was already
[1:22:46] there F love entered into me and that
[1:22:50] love is an intellectual
[1:22:53] love so what do you think I
[1:22:57] did without them realizing they were
[1:22:59] there in front of the the pastor's
[1:23:02] house 30 or 40 people they were going to
[1:23:04] take pictures or something like
[1:23:06] that so then I saw the scene
[1:23:09] there the young men and the and the the
[1:23:12] young ladies
[1:23:14] and and so I I drew Drew closer and I
[1:23:20] noticed that the the girl that brother
[1:23:22] Bernie told me her she was
[1:23:26] there and she she she didn't realize
[1:23:28] that nobody knew that I did it in my in
[1:23:31] my mischievous
[1:23:34] mind I'm not gonna go just because
[1:23:36] brother Bernie told
[1:23:37] me I have to like her you understand
[1:23:42] that how are you going to marry somebody
[1:23:44] that you don't like sneaky sneaky
[1:23:50] so I got really close just to check her
[1:23:54] her
[1:24:01] out tell you the
[1:24:04] truth it was just to see if she was
[1:24:06] pretty or if she was
[1:24:08] ugly and when I saw her like oh my
[1:24:14] God she's the
[1:24:17] one she's pretty I liked
[1:24:21] her and no now what I did
[1:24:25] I I I went ahead a little
[1:24:29] bit I thought what am I going to do when
[1:24:31] when I'm 10 or 15 years of
[1:24:35] marriage and you already know that
[1:24:37] there's disappointments in
[1:24:39] marriage one fails the other you
[1:24:43] know and one day my wife's going to get
[1:24:45] mad at me and I thought about this and I
[1:24:48] said what am I going to
[1:24:50] do when
[1:24:52] she's Johnny Johnny joh John joh when
[1:24:56] she's in my
[1:24:59] face telling me stuff or telling me
[1:25:02] something
[1:25:04] upset can you
[1:25:06] imagine
[1:25:08] upset though you're your wife with upset
[1:25:11] at
[1:25:12] you and then
[1:25:23] ugly m
[1:25:26] now my
[1:25:27] wife she's a
[1:25:31] Christian very very
[1:25:33] strict she's she's she's a rule rule of
[1:25:37] law and she got to that
[1:25:40] point she told me there in my
[1:25:46] face you're here you're wrong there
[1:25:49] and and I'm there listening to
[1:25:53] her and what do you think I
[1:25:56] thought I said
[1:26:00] it one day I've done it one or two or
[1:26:03] three
[1:26:06] times your wife's never gotten mad at
[1:26:08] you
[1:26:09] right
[1:26:15] no never gets mad at the wife right no
[1:26:18] noos
[1:26:20] [Laughter]
[1:26:23] Liars
[1:26:27] so then when she's really
[1:26:29] upset and this and that and the other
[1:26:32] what do you think I said remember I'm
[1:26:35] I'm a
[1:26:37] Pisces mad and she's telling
[1:26:40] me and I tell her
[1:26:43] l oh what a pretty face you
[1:26:48] have and then she and then it seems like
[1:26:51] she liked it for a
[1:26:53] second but then no I'm still mad at

[1:27:01] that can you imagine the woman

[1:30:38] anyone
[1:30:40] okay now I'm going to read the
[1:30:44] scripture see if you can follow me here
[1:30:46] Ephesians 5:23
[1:30:48] ephes for the for the husband is the
[1:30:50] head of the house head of the of your
[1:30:53] wife
[1:30:55] that's our
[1:30:57] absolute Genesis
[1:30:59] 3:16 and unto the woman he said I will
[1:31:03] greatly multiply thy sorrow and in thy
[1:31:05] conception in thy sorrow Thou shalt
[1:31:07] bring forth children and thy desires
[1:31:09] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[1:31:11] rule over
[1:31:22] thee
[1:31:28] the Bible says that the man shall rule
[1:31:31] over
[1:31:34] the okay you know when God made Adam and
[1:31:39] Eve and made him when he first created
[1:31:42] him he spoke the
[1:31:45] word he made him in theop
[1:31:49] form and they were
[1:31:52] coequal did you know that
[1:31:55] Lucifer was co-equal to God at one
[1:32:00] time but because of his
[1:32:02] Beauty lifted
[1:32:04] up got lifted
[1:32:06] up and then God kicked him
[1:32:10] out okay now when God made
[1:32:16] Eve in
[1:32:18] flesh and when she
[1:32:21] sinned and when she did what she
[1:32:25] did now she is no more equal with
[1:32:31] Adam now she's on another
[1:32:34] level now she must be subject to
[1:32:38] Adam now Adam is her
[1:32:43] ruler right how many can say Amen to
[1:32:46] that okay not too many
[1:32:49] hands
[1:32:51] okay okay Matthews
[1:32:56] 10:37 he that loveth father or mother
[1:32:59] more than me is not worthy of me he that
[1:33:03] loveth son and daughter more than me is
[1:33:05] not worthy of

[1:33:35] love because in the within the
[1:33:38] families and you know what I'm talking
[1:33:41] about who hasn't disappointed you
[1:33:43] sometime or
[1:33:46] another your uncle your sister or your
[1:33:49] brother or your
[1:33:50] sister in your
[1:33:52] flesh and and and you can't get out of
[1:33:54] that
[1:33:56] Circle and you can't forgive
[1:33:59] them because they they sinned or did
[1:34:01] something wrong against
[1:34:03] you in the flesh in your
[1:34:06] love and in your love you cannot
[1:34:11] forgive the other person you got to get
[1:34:14] out of that have
[1:34:17] a for whoever loves mother and father
[1:34:21] brother sister son
[1:34:24] more than
[1:34:25] me is not worthy of me we got to have
[1:34:29] the love of
[1:34:31] God okay

[1:34:37] this quote it just uh we got 22 minutes
[1:34:40] I hope I can I'll read
[1:34:42] it now we've tried
[1:34:46] dictators it doesn't work and each one
[1:34:48] seems to get just a little bit shallower
[1:34:51] each
[1:34:52] time
[1:34:54] and now we stand at the great moment
[1:34:55] when Anything could
[1:34:58] happen it could be over in five
[1:35:01] minutes that every nation would be laid
[1:35:03] to
[1:35:06] powder and if we're at that
[1:35:09] time where ought the church to
[1:35:12] be the great
[1:35:14] crisis the great
[1:35:16] crisis is on right
[1:35:18] now then also we have the home life
[1:35:22] crisis
[1:35:25] it seemed like the home life is running
[1:35:28] out into shallow
[1:35:32] Waters it used to be that the home that
[1:35:34] the Father the head of the
[1:35:38] house would sit down in the morning and
[1:35:41] he would speak with his
[1:35:43] family and they would all take all the
[1:35:45] the the old Family
[1:35:48] Bible and just read a little bit and all
[1:35:51] together around the table
[1:35:54] and have prayer you don't see that no
[1:35:58] more and when the day was
[1:36:00] done mom had the
[1:36:04] dishes they had all gathered
[1:36:06] in and read some more of the
[1:36:09] Bible before going to
[1:36:12] bed now I had to just get that out of
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:15] way now see I got about 20 minutes

[1:36:22] week

[1:37:21] right to talk about that
[1:37:26] remember I don't base things on your
[1:37:29] thought or my
[1:37:30] thought the word of
[1:37:33] God the message of the
[1:37:36] hour in Mexico in they have a certain
[1:37:40] not
[1:37:41] everybody but the
[1:37:44] general okay and this has been known for
[1:37:47] years in Mexico I don't know about the
[1:37:50] rest of the
[1:37:51] countries but Mexico is more famous
[1:37:55] they have what they call the Macho
[1:38:00] spirit is that
[1:38:07] right because the man Manda is the
[1:38:14] boss the man is the boss
[1:38:18] in if the woman doesn't like it I'll
[1:38:20] kick her around a little bit smack a

[1:38:36] coin on the other side of the coin in
[1:38:39] America in America United States of
[1:38:45] America here it's not the spirit of
[1:38:49] Macho here in the United
[1:38:51] States the women
[1:38:54] are the
[1:38:54] [Music]

[1:39:13] right you can't balance it because
[1:39:16] you're from
[1:39:18] here for me that one's wrong in Mexico
[1:39:21] in Mexico
[1:39:24] and the spirit of the United
[1:39:26] States is also wrong you know
[1:39:31] why because the woman
[1:39:39] is he's a
[1:39:48] I've seen brothers and
[1:39:51] sisters that when the man is speaking
[1:39:56] huh yes my love whatever you

[1:40:10] Rapture you might make it as the foolish
[1:40:13] version you understand what I just
[1:40:17] said that's what we have here in this
[1:40:20] church just like many
[1:40:22] churches
[1:40:24] because the spirit over there is is
[1:40:26] being Macho but in
[1:40:29] America even men wear
[1:40:34] we you
[1:40:36] know about a man that wears
[1:40:39] aalto that's a
[1:40:46] you know that there's ministers on
[1:40:49] the
[1:40:50] pulpit that are
[1:40:52] a
[1:40:53] minist ministers

[1:41:00] Min
[1:41:02] in you know
[1:41:05] why because they
[1:41:07] compromise with something for money
[1:41:12] because of Fame because of the interest
[1:41:15] or for a reason
[1:41:19] okay I can't criticize this because
[1:41:22] they're going to be offended
[1:41:25] they're going to pull the strings over
[1:41:29] here TI on any strings of
[1:41:33] nobody we have to be
[1:41:36] anchored and that
[1:41:39] anchor is the word of
[1:41:42] God and the word of
[1:41:45] God it cuts going in and coming

[1:45:56] Clinton she might be
[1:45:59] president but the
[1:46:01] system of
[1:46:03] Jezebel that the woman is the
[1:46:06] boss on the throne at the white

[1:47:02] brother Brown said but the only
[1:47:04] credential that a Believer has is the
[1:47:06] word of
[1:47:08] God living in
[1:47:11] him declaring Jesus Christ in that
[1:47:15] person that's a separated Nazarite unto
[1:47:19] the
[1:47:21] Lord separated for the word
[1:47:25] sake the Bible's sake so my
[1:47:30] credentials is I had a Nazarite
[1:47:34] call I am
[1:47:37] not I am not an
[1:47:40] American I am not a Mexican I am
[1:47:47] not I am a
[1:47:51] Nazarite every sister sister that has
[1:47:54] long hair that's a Nazarite
[1:47:59] right the
[1:48:01] prophets were
[1:48:03] nazarites Jesus was a
[1:48:06] Nazarite Samson was a
[1:48:10] Nazarite and every born again
[1:48:13] Christian baptized with the Holy
[1:48:16] Ghost he's a
[1:48:18] Nazarite so I'm not a
[1:48:21] Mexican
[1:48:24] I'm not
[1:48:26] AO brother what are you talking about oh
[1:48:30] you're just
[1:48:32] wrong look brother in my
[1:48:36] flesh I'm a
[1:48:40] Mexican I eat Mexican
[1:48:46] food but I was born here and I really
[1:48:48] like
[1:48:50] hamburgers so then I got an Amer
[1:48:52] American Spirit
[1:48:55] okay but that's the
[1:48:58] Flesh in my flesh I'm an American I'm a
[1:49:03] Mexican that's my
[1:49:05] flesh but in my
[1:49:08] soul in my soul I am a
[1:49:14] Nazarite in my
[1:49:17] credentials is the word of the Living
[1:49:21] God declaring to Jesus Christ that he
[1:49:23] lives in
[1:49:27] us I'm quoting brother bam I believe
[1:49:30] tonight that every man and woman that's
[1:49:32] ever and every boy and girl that's born
[1:49:34] of the spirit of
[1:49:39] God is a Nazarite unto the
[1:49:43] Lord are you with
[1:49:45] me are you a
[1:49:47] Nazarite
[1:49:51] huh we're Nazarite
[1:49:55] or do we go with the American
[1:49:57] Spirit do we go to do we go to
[1:49:59] movies well let's all be gays here oh
[1:50:02] say that again let's all be gays
[1:50:04] here let's all let's be's
[1:50:07] be let's the American
[1:50:10] Spirit that's the spirit of the
[1:50:12] devil Spirit of
[1:50:15] antichrist I'm not an
[1:50:18] American when it comes to
[1:50:20] that even brother bramon he was
[1:50:24] American right in his flesh but not in
[1:50:28] his soul there is a super
[1:50:33] race made up of
[1:50:36] Mexican
[1:50:37] whites Germans Swedish
[1:50:43] Brazilians the Chile the Chile from
[1:50:47] Chile in Japan
[1:50:50] wherever of all different colors
[1:50:53] a super
[1:50:55] race nazarites
[1:50:57] [Applause]
[1:51:00] naos that believe in Malachi
[1:51:06] 45 because they have separated them them
[1:51:10] things
[1:51:13] themselves from the cares of the world
[1:51:16] and whatever the world has has to
[1:51:18] say so a Nazarite is one who separates
[1:51:21] himself from the world
[1:51:25] you're not of this world little children
[1:51:27] neither am I of this
[1:51:29] world I pray for you Jesus prayed for
[1:51:32] his
[1:51:32] church they would not be of the
[1:51:35] world they are not of the world I don't
[1:51:39] care you're not
[1:51:41] American you're not
[1:51:44] Swedish you're not
[1:51:45] European you're a
[1:51:49] Christian so being a Christian
[1:51:53] and my
[1:51:55] bases in the word of God I
[1:51:58] declare
[1:52:00] repeat what the prophet of God
[1:52:04] said
[1:52:08] the the man that's the boss of his wife
[1:52:11] because Mach it's of the
[1:52:14] devil and a
[1:52:17] man that lets his wife be the boss of
[1:52:21] him is
[1:52:36] did you understand
[1:52:38] me now you know why I have to I have to
[1:52:42] continue if God permits me okay I don't
[1:52:46] that if you're a
[1:52:48] Christian your spirit is from up there
[1:52:54] so it makes you live a holy want to be
[1:52:57] holy want to act like
[1:53:00] Christ act like God your whole desire is
[1:53:04] heaven and not of the world okay so back
[1:53:08] to the drawing
[1:53:11] board three minutes brother sister when
[1:53:15] you're disappointed with your
[1:53:18] wife or he's disappointed with her
[1:53:22] husband

[1:53:47] can you know with mother with a with a
[1:53:50] little grandkid you know
[1:53:55] mother you know brother R said when a
[1:53:58] little girl hangs around Grandma a

[1:54:07] that love that's not AAP love that's
[1:54:12] love
[1:54:14] okay do they go together a little girl
[1:54:16] and grandma do they go
[1:54:19] together brother bam said Grandma's
[1:54:22] probably got some candy
[1:54:25] somewhere they unit them
[1:54:27] together because when that little girl
[1:54:29] grows
[1:54:30] up she gonna think oh Grandma she's old
