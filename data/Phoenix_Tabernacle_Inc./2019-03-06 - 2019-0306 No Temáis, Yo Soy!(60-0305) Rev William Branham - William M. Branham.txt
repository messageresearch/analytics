Matthew 14th chapter and you were keeping the marching town of the reading let's begin about the 22nd verse as we read on the 14th chapter of st. Matthew's Gospel and straight swaying Jesus constrains his disciples to get them to a ship and to go before him to the other side Raleigh sent the multitude away and we he had sent the multitude away we went up into a mountain of hearts afraid and when evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with away and the winds were contrary then the fourth watch of the night Jesus came unto them walking on the sea when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled safe it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them see be the good Shearer it is I be not afraid now I use that right three words or for these not afraid in his eyes I want to make that attack it must have been close to sundown when the big fisherman begins to move the boat back and forth to push it from the bank I can see straight brawny muscle desi as the boat loaded with the rest of the Apostles as we pushed away from the bank shove it free from the sands of the shore of Galilee and moved out into the water the bigger rugged fella climbed over some of their feet and tucking slaves for the side of Andrew his brother picked up the ore and they started away from the shore and as they moved steadily out to sea the people who loved them standing on the banks waving and the Sun going down and must have been about twenty minutes before they disappeared out of sight of the last one waiting I can see that each one drop is or wave then pick up his or start again with the little ship way back in the West look honey ran low as the Sun sank over this Judy and Hill something like this I remember when I was just a little boy is to read that story of God loving his people so well that he provided for them when they had no way to provide for themselves and he said that one day when God has called his people to take a journey from the land of bondage to the land of freedom they ran out of bread out in the wilderness and there was no corn or flour funds and they prayed and if I said this I remember when she told me that every night that God rained bread down out of heaven in the morning is people would go out and get that grade and I have said to my mother mother dear where did God get that bread to feed so many people 2 million people were more out in that wilderness how did he send it down to the skies when they were asleep and rained it up on the ground where did he get the flour mother to make the bread well if she used to say something like this my dear son God is the creator he is able to make bread or create whatever you wishes to when some requirement that God requires he is so great John until he just beast and it's there because he is the Great Creator and now he might say this my brethren did you notice his face this afternoon all those hungry people were standing there and one of the disciples might've said yes I noticed weighed down along the creek there was a little boy playing through it from school and had his luncheon and he had five grilled barley loaves and two fishes I'm ready tuck those bread into his hands and flip that bread handed it out touch those species that were fried broke then fishes and handed it out and when he reached back to get another piece of bread it already growth on already cooked and ready the species was already fried and a lot of that moves City lunch Assad's biscuits and two pieces of fish he fed 5,000 did it remind you of the story of God hideous people so they must be some great connection between this one that we're walking with and Jehovah God because there's something about him and he does the same thing God did he takes care of your people they were in a wilderness a nun persuaded veteran miner young John said in his useful way of about about 30 years old I suppose make it 35 he was younger than the rest you might expect this that it was strange when I watched his eyes there was something godly about him you never had one doubt but what when he reached back for another biscuit it would be there and it for one biscuit off of another now brethren tell me where he's gone that he must need some connection with that Great Creator that could make bread Allen could make it already baked and could make the fish all that he's fried and ready ravenous from five it's um to fish enough to see 5000 take a broad basket full of fragrance leftovers done must be something about him that we yet have not understood but I know that he's some connection was gone because no man could do that unless God would be with him and Jesus had said if I do not for worse than my father then believe me not but if I do the worst thing you believe the words and young John must have jumped his head took back his Lord and it must have been sign and then the big fisherman said yes that was enough to convince anybody that God was in that ring because no one could have done it that man could not have done it himself but God was in him and then he said what always convinced I was rather a rugged little fisherman on the scene brethren you know I had better training than what I was doing first because I had a lovely old father he was a Pharisee but he was a great man I can remember down on the seashore when he was picked me up in his lap and set me down I would say Simon my son you're just delaying but maybe in your generation if your father doesn't see it there will come some day our deliverance which we know as to be the Messiah and Simon many people will misunderstanding our churches will misunderstand I need will be a man that'll be a strange sort of a man but Simon my son I never want you to forget this you'll have to know the Messiah by the scriptures this road of it don't never leave the Scriptures must die and Moses our leader has told us what the Messiah would be born is written in the scriptures that the Lord our God shall raise up a prophet of others and when this Messiah comes he will be a God's prophet you'll be different from other prophecies you hear God's prophets but you'll noise Simon because he will be that prophet and you'll do the science of a prophecy and when I heard of this Galilean man this Jesus of Nazareth I thought it was just another what just another Passover night but one day when he borrowed my boat then talking to me as soon as I come into his presence he called me by name the first time I ever saw him he told me who our and not only that but he think that gully old father of mine he said Simon you are the son of Jonas family says that I know that was the one life that he had spoke about that the scripture said would jump because he was a God prophecy I know these signs was beyond a prophecy so he was a God prophecy not in those that would be him that's two reasons other than your eyes hello my face and Andrew told me about it believing my brother sitting here young John brush his hair back he tears with it then smiles that Veronica he breaks that bridge I thought he was gone but Peter said when he told me who I was until my father was I knew who that was well then it must have been Philip who shoved these shoulders a little bit and looked around intense but better you should have seen the face of nothingness annular when I found him and I knew beyond the shadows out when he told sign on that face who he was really sorry was I knew that was the Messiah everyone heard him say that there was something burned within me our generation had a visitor and always going to be determined that ever friend that I know that I was going to get into and just as quick as I could throw salt of the spaniel my bosom friends way around the mountains about 15 miles running that danced over the cobblestones and the Sun were taught I heard much talk about it throwing pawn as the one along the seashore of galletitas see the my friends I came up and knocked on the door and his wife came to the door and I said where is the Sam said was sick he had just went out into the olive drove I think he's gone off to see about the irrigation or something quickly I've run out into the Grove in a pounding on his knees and that's a good way to find the night Oh tell me more knees knees and uh some message was burning in my heart so I could Harvey wish the peasant but get all that he finishes Prairie when he got us not going I was there usually I would go tree that said how is the Grove getting along this angle how is everything up at San Marcos and you did any training reserves the cabins is coming through as you use it is because he was rather a business name but on it don't seem to telling that's what we needed a burning nothing else takes its weight quickly eat in the face how do you do the same he said something about when you find Jesus you're gonna see who we are found Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and its annual being a just man Anna level speaking many said not wait just a minute oh you know that there should be nothing good come from Nazareth here if there was such a thing as the Messiah that was coming he would come to the high priest first and they can set room he would come to our church but you see God's does Saints the juniors dream he does it in order to pull the elected from everywhere and then when I told him that if he was going to be critical the best thing to do was just come see for himself I think that's what don't criticize the few year of somebody that's receiving the Holy Spirit if you see a life changed in something differently and they say you've been told that there is the Holy Spirit you don't criticize it take your Bible look it over gives God promised it and then go see for yourself don't stay home we'll find out look it over yourself and compare it with the scriptures and if it's with the scriptures it's wrong if it ends with the scriptures that's questionable but as long as the scripture and a family it is true I'm Ted come see for yourself then you look back over shoulders to find the tango singer we think for joy and he said brother do you remember our conversation along the road I propose you that the scripture said that the Messiah was he a prophet of God profit that Moses said the larger God shall raise up all of our people questions are you that's profit any less than Kali in a days not telling him exactly what he was and he said you remember the old fisherman for the name of silence yes said Nathaniel I remember him you remember when we fought that speech from the in that day and you wanted to sign a receipt and you didn't even have enough education to sign his own name but that same illiterate man came before this one that we know to be the Messiah as soon as he came he Tori's who he was what his father lies and the spangle said I'll come see for myself you'll never tell me nothing my mind stronger here you'll never read my mind no my reader and when we come up into the presence and a nothing here iam saved us a moment cilix taste Nathaniel I'm didn't dildo you tell the rest of it and the fatal tip when I take offense to look at him I knew by his looks that he was a different from other man and rather this first what I'm saying once gets a vision of Jesus Christ he can never be the same nature that he's different from others and he said when I looked at him and he looked at me Hey look me right in the face said he said Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile laughs I wonder if Philip could have told him that he was going after me what if that could be the key so I turn around and said to him rabbi when did you ever know me we are strangers to each other and what did you know mean you said the force called you when you were under the tree the king of Israel then that look that he gave me and said oh you believe me to be such because I told you where you are I told you these things then thou shalt see greater things and truly today all have seen greater things when he taken the bread and broke it and created bread behind it and fish he told me the truth therefore I am persuaded evasion of profit was to come into the world at the ending of of our dispensations and they stick quite 50 minutes then Andrew standing across from Peters foolish orientation that's rich for a few minutes brethren let me call Shir because of swells our Samira floating along pretty lively and we've got all night the Costas the Galilean see don't we all well remember the day that we walked with him so long and his speechless of time remember when we went down to the spring and Dustin water is poured only speak they were blistered from walking he said I have need to go back to Mary really on his road to Jericho a roundabout way we wondered why wouldn't he go around the back way remember reminds me whether I or recording I was listening to a few days ago when I was laying in the bed the day that I saw the Lord Jesus walk into the room and I don't think I've told you about to talk about this new ministry to me when I was bringing there in the bed I was listening at a t-shirt a teaching on a page and someone said to this t-shirt why is this huge don't go and stay straight in the ring with your text and this picture said however people I teach too is not on the highway so I have to go by the wayside to pick them up and clues Jesus will take his t-shirts or one side answer these texts and Jesus oversee the win one thing somebody say your member highs precious piece was hurting you and he made his way through Samaria I'd it was noon time and we've been a bigger part of the night he's great for so many stick and he was where he's walking along the road i sat down and so tired that he couldn't make this in the city and he said it's a way to get some spoons Madras Americans would let us have it so ordered wait coming back we were sorry to see him or a masters talk he was a woman mark with ill fame but when we seen that we were astonished then we did not we all slip up in the bush we stand still to see what he would say any sex woman Rainier dreams do you remember what she said that it she said it's not customary for you Jews to ask the marriage in such we have no dealings with each other but now listen brother they angry mother said listen what he told her he said she woman if you knew who you were talking to your dream not give you waters that you don't come here the door and a woman all excited said well where where can you get this one the well is deep and you have nothing to draw with how do you remember it's brethren what he said the water that I give is my eternal buffing up a woman wanted back Watchers and he said sir don't get your husband firstly from here and do you remember we thought he must be trapped or something when the woman looking goalie in the face is that I have no husband so how could that be our Lord so make sure sir mistake is that on the thighs Kirti how could it be this woman is tonight that she has a husband calmly quietly test woman I had said true you've had five husbands and the one you're now living with is not sure how it melt dis that one he saw chica live out of it what the specialization and the tears in her eyes she said sir I perceive as you are a prophet now brother listen to that he said she said you must be a prophet we will that randomest are coming he'll tell us these things who are you when we know that our teaching is that this process would be a God's prophet and Winnett Samaritan woman testifies against our priest that she knew that when the Messiah come here fear give them a site friend is yes God is often and even our priest called him Beelzebub a fortune tellers but this he'll faint woman singing better understanding of the scriptures in our priest is that she says you must be a prophet but we may one a massage from us he'll tell us all these things who are you either too long death when she found out that she'd had a contact with the real Messiah Jesus she screams of handsome man only the things that I've done is this the Messiah isn't this the sign of the Messiah and how many more things Peter must have spoke up and said could we say about him that is prove that he is the Messiah Oh God about that time Peyton looking for the rim and he shows a little fun at all the scene without Jesus don't here's my opportunity Zoey is this tonight with every individual whatever Church whatever member the church when they think can see your role without Jesus is his opportunity smite you that I'll risk the whole rush down so you begin to breathe in and out from his nostrils great powerful winds that and his poison press hit the steel head of nervous restoration anything have a nervous prostration nervous breakdown told me in state institutions filled up we got people running 230 miles old at 90 miles an hour squeezing all the rubber off the tires showing of the corners to do all the world is unnerving they all know where they're sending you Tony one person in the other church every little thing they're running here in there chewing so if the calls it's taken as begins who shall is poised and bred that's again the glorious winds of strike break these churches apart separating Brotherhood making people's faces are little better than somebody else there's wrong in a better practice they belong to a better Church there is only one church and that's the Church of Jesus Christ and there's only one way to get into it that's by birth you are born into the church's pomp and there's no other way to be brilliant and it doesn't matter whether you're Methodists Baptists Presbyterians Catholic Orthodox Jew whatever you are God does not look at your denomination he looks at the brand is on you or the blood here's the guy I used to do quite a bit of line where's Raju ever did was your team I thought I was a rider like my dad joke a Bronco call me up a few times well right here in Salt River Valley has filled me into a bunch of cactus out there one day I was an awkward shape for a week agooo trying to chase the burro down by all the sixteenth Street 33 years ago why we never over in Colorado the herds word association grazes the Troublesome River Valley and many times when we take the cattle up there by step with my leg wrapped around the heart of the saddle while the Rangers were checking these saddles going through the day the prison gate and there was the turkey sex that was the lazy cave the diamond tea mr. Grimes I am the tripod which was mr. Jeffery two hours with mrs. Rollins Hey different ones for tuition every man can raise a ton of hate to put a talent on the plaster for the summer but I noticed that Rangers never even check the breads he looked in their ear for

let's refine distinctive and you know if you don't watching these disciples that bring off without him I know I say this with brotherly love I wonder if in the life where a five years or more if we

home aside to watch some television on Wednesday night instead of and in church I wonder if we haven't been too busy trying to uh or make enough hints to get a new car or something I guess and forgot journey one of our programs haven't called us to wait on we say our church is getting cold and formal I wonder if we check up on ourselves if we're not just as much to bring a little more than the pass through the paws of our church being in that condition remember you're sailing in one little boat others nobody can get in there with you but you're Jesus so keep it congregated and the unit to there's power with rest of believers head in fellowship one with another while the part of Jesus I've got some tweezers of all uncleanness and then the little beginning of ditch back and forth and it
