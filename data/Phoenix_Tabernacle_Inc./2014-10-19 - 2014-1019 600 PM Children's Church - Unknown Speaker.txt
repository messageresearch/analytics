happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight tonight we have a special treat as um it's once again it's an honor to be here before you to deliver um an abstract or an exert to put it more accurately from the book Supernatural the life of William brandham book one the boy in his deprivation 1909 to 1932 as you know we have been covering the book from its beginning and there are 11 chapters in the book tonight I'll be doing in ed oberved from the last three pages of the book as you might expect there are some Supernatural events that take place we see this particular exert will set up the future and it actually demonstrates to us the beginning of our prophet's ministry right before our eyes what a wonderful thing that is and we're so thankful that we have a brother as precious as brother Oren jurgenson that took the time to put this series together and we're so thankful that the Lord led him to do this and that our precious brother Perry green made sure that it got published there's a story behind that we'll Lord willing will'll cover that in the future but it's it once again it's an honor to be before you tonight chapter 11 is entitled ordained to a supernatural gospel from 1932 a fact that might be worth pointing out here is that brother Brandon was ordained as a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ according to the laws and bylaws of the Missionary Baptist Church he was ordained by Dr Roy Davis around Christmas Day 1932 we pick it up later in the chapter after brother Brandon had prayed for a colored man in a Catholic Hospital who was miraculously healed we pick it up the next morning the next morning Billy got up at Daybreak as he fumbled in the halflight for his clothes the room was suddenly bathed in full daylight as though someone had turned it on by a switch Bill instantly realized that he was no longer in his own house the room that he now found himself in was larger than his bedroom it looked something like a living room with a sofa a club chair an ottoman end tables and lamps except that in one corner sat a High bed on this bed lay a middle-aged woman hideously crippled Bill watched in amazement as This Woman's Twisted limb straightened out and became normal the woman climbed out of the bed and walked directly at him which let Bill get a good look at her face then he was back in the halflight of his own room Billy sat on the edge of his bed for a long time puzzling it over obviously the Lord Jesus was going to deliver someone else but who and when he thought well I'll probably find out where she's at today that day his work assignment took him to 2223 East Oak Street in New Albany a family had moved out from one side of a double tenement house and Bill needed to shut off the water to that one side only but at the box it wasn't clear which meter went to which side he twisted the valve closed on one meter then stepped around to the occupied side of the duplex to check an attractive teenage girl poorly dressed answered his knock what do you want I work for the Public Service Company which would you try the water to see if it's off certainly the girl stepped around the corner into her kitchen standing in the doorway bill could see a woman lying on a hospital typ bed in the living room her body was extremely Twisted making her look like a shriveled spider the bed elevated her head and her and faced towards the door so that Billy could see her face clearly his heart leaped with excitement this was the crippled woman he had seen that morning in a vision she was reading a black covered book a newspaper lay scattered on the floor beside her bed how do you do ma'am my name is BR Billy brandham hello mine is Mary D ohanyan my daughter there is Dorothy Dorothy came back into the room and said no the water is still on I guess I turned off the right meter then thank you for checking but he didn't leave somehow he must strike a conversation with this crippled woman what is that you are reading an Armenian Bible she answered he challenged her do you believe Mrs durl Hanan set the book down in her lap Dorothy is 17 years old since the time she was born I've been crippled in bed but this morning I read the paper about a man being healed over at the Catholic Hospital and I said there's hope for me say did you say your name was brandom she took off her reading glasses to stare at the young man standing in the doorway of her living room her expression changed as she connected this young meter man with the faceless brandom in the newspaper article are you the man of God that healed that colored man last night no ma'am I'm not a Healer I was showed by something that I should pray for that man the Lord Jesus is the Healer not me the woman nodded ever since I read about that Miracle I've been asking God for one in my own life would you pray for me Billy looked at this woman whose Twisted limbs had suffered 17 years of atrophy and he said cautiously I'll go pray about this and then I'll come back he found a place to be alone with God and prayed until his courage matched the vision then he drove over to George the ark's house brother George I met the woman I was telling you about this morning I know it's the same one come with me the two of them entered the duplex and stood next to miss ohanyan's bed while the woman hugged her Armenian Bible to her heart Dorothy and her 8-year-old brother hid behind the Christmas tree on the other side of the living room snickering and making fun of the whole idea to think that their mother would get out of bed after lying there for 17 years what a joke Bill ignored the children miss ohanyan the Lord Jesus is going to heal you Billy and George got on their knees and started to pray eyelids even when shut will still allow light to touch the pupils and through his eyelids Bill saw a light turned on over Miss ohanyan he opened his eyes expecting to see an electric bulb instead he saw an Amber Ring of Fire circling above her bed all gripped him a breathless fear mixed with a probing curiosity this must be the same light that had formed a cross in the air when he was praying in the shed behind his house inspired Bill reached over took hold of the woman's hand and said miss ohanyan the Lord Jesus told me this morning that you was going to be made well rise up on your feet and walk in in the name of Jesus throwing her covers aside she wiggled towards the edge of the bed using her withered arms and legs to inch herself along like a caterpillar Bill had one flash of misgiving thinking that if he let her fall off that High bed she might break her neck when she hit the floor then he thought of the vision of William Merill how perfect it had been how uniring and his confidence returned as soon as as Miss ohanyan slid over the edge of the bed both her legs suddenly straightened out right before everyone's eyes Dorothy screamed a shrill insane scream and pulling her hair darted out the front door still shrieking at the top of her voice neighbors came running from every direction jamming the doorway gawking in disbelief watching their neighbor Mary dur ohanyan who for the first time in 17 years was walking around her living room holding two good arms above her head as she praised the Lord Jesus Christ in her native Armenian tongue bill went home excited and joyful about these wonderful visions that were preceding such Miracles but soon his excitement would dampen soon his Joy would turn into fear his next vision would be strikingly different and when he would describe this Vision to his Pastor Bill would be confused by his pastor's response it would begin for him years of uncertainty that would eventually drive him to discover the secret behind his peculiar life a secret that would launch the greatest Faith Healing Ministry that the world has ever seen God bless [Applause] you amen good evening when I this isn't he wonderful the power of the Lord amen amen showed brother brandom a vision that she would be made well her own kids even disbelieved it amen right after it's in 17 years I mean how could she get up and walk amen but they were just fulfilling God's word and he did the God's work and he made it he manifested it there right there and then so there isn't anything he can't do for us amen amen good evening once again if you don't mind standing how many you have to

doubt put that helmet on put that on your head in your mind that Jesus Christ died on the cross for [Music] you protect your [Music] head protect your thoughts with a helmet that declares that you are
