[12:34] we's
[12:36] Reading from The Book supernatural Life
[12:38] of brother branam so How many remember
[12:41] Where we left off last time wasn't it
[12:44] when um he decided not to go and he was
[12:47] listening to his mother-in-law's advice
[12:49] and it said It was
[12:52] though he didn't want to hurt his
[12:54] mother-in-law's feelings but he said
[12:55] that Was the worst mist he Ever made So
[12:58] let's Why
[13:01] Ok God bless
[13:06] you last time we completed chapter
[13:09] 18 and this Time we're Going To chapter
[13:11] 19 in the Second Book a Black curtain
[13:14] Falls from
[13:18] 1936 as If to sooth his trouble
[13:21] conscience William branam increases his
[13:23] evangelistic efforts around the
[13:24] jeffersonville Area feeling that The
[13:27] Story of his Life might Inspire others
[13:29] to have Faith in God Bill wrote down
[13:32] some of his personal experiences and Had
[13:34] them printed in a 15 page booklet he
[13:36] borrow the title from hebrews chapter 13
[13:39] verse 8 Jesus Christ the same Yesterday
[13:42] today and forever and he signed his work
[13:45] by rever William Billy branam in a
[13:48] Forward he wrote this Book has been
[13:51] written so that everyone Who reads it
[13:53] May know that Jesus Christ is Still
[13:55] saving and healing people It is my
[13:58] belief that he is soon to appear Again
[14:02] this Book tells How he chose a Poor Boy
[14:05] And called him to his ministry and How
[14:08] the Boy ran from him for a While and
[14:10] then wholeheartedly turned to
[14:13] him Bill followed on the next page with
[14:16] A Prayer Oh Father in heaven please
[14:19] Bless everyone Who reads this Book Let
[14:21] them know that you are Going To call a
[14:24] mighty Church soon such as We have never
[14:28] seen we Still believe
[14:33] you create a longing in Every Heart and
[14:37] Oh righteous One help thy humble servant
[14:40] to carry on your message I know you hid
[14:43] Me In The Bull rushes As you did moses
[14:45] for some purpose so Father help me to
[14:49] glorify thy name for I ask it in Jesus
[14:52] name
[14:53] amen the next Seven pages highlighted
[14:56] bill's unusual Life beginning with How
[14:58] he and his mother would have Died In A
[15:00] snowstorm except for the intervention of
[15:02] a neighbor he told of the voice that
[15:05] spoke to him from the branches of a tree
[15:07] when he was Seven years old saying Don't
[15:10] ever drink or Smoke or defile your body
[15:12] in Any way there Will be a work for you
[15:14] to do when you get older then he
[15:17] mentioned his trip to Arizona in 1927
[15:20] and told How the Death of his brother
[15:23] Edward brought him home and forced him
[15:25] to consider What lay Beyond his Life he
[15:29] wrote about Being overcome by gas While
[15:31] working for the public service Company
[15:33] his subsequent operation in theion of a
[15:36] Cross of light that turned him towards
[15:38] God then he described his own miraculous
[15:42] healing from a stomach disorder and
[15:44] severe astigmatism his call to preach
[15:48] and Finally the Ball of fire that
[15:50] appeared over his Head While baptizing
[15:52] in the Ohio River in
[15:54] 1933 he concluded the booklet with these
[15:57] words dear
[15:59] If I only Had room in this Book to Tell
[16:01] you of the many things that have
[16:03] happened of how Our tabernacle was built
[16:06] in many of the powerful revivals We have
[16:09] held people have come from Far and near
[16:12] to be healed but I Going To Have to make
[16:14] this Book small Enough so that it Will
[16:17] sell cheap And Be in Reach of
[16:19] all these things are to Let You know
[16:22] that Jesus Christ is Still The same as
[16:24] he was Yesterday and today and will be
[16:27] forever and that You should believe him
[16:30] And Be saved if you can at Any Time Our
[16:34] revivals are near you please attend

[18:59] later in that summer of 1936 Bill and
[19:03] hope are Going To Drive to Fort way
[19:05] Indiana to visit hope's Father Bill was
[19:08] in a hurry to get on the road Because If

[19:53] Times More expensive Than rayon women
[19:55] Who Wanted to feel elegant and look
[19:57] fashionable prefer
[19:59] on the other hand ron Was often the
[20:01] Choice of older women Who were more
[20:03] interested in economy and utility than
[20:05] looks Bill branam knew very Little about
[20:08] women's Fashions and Had trouble keeping
[20:10] chifan and rayon separated in his Mind
[20:13] to make sure he didn't forget he kept
[20:15] repeating the correct One as he walked
[20:17] to the Store Chan Chan Chan Chan someone
[20:23] said Hello to him as he passed Hello he
[20:26] replied and continued muttering Chan

[20:37] the side of that Last pier some of them
[20:39] are that long orville held up his hands
[20:41] as a measure bill whistled quite
[20:44] impressed and the two men discussed bait
[20:46] and fishing methods for a few minutes
[20:48] When Bill walked away he Had forgotten
[20:50] What kind of stockings he was supposed
[20:51] to buy Now What was he Going To Do he
[20:55] would be embarrassed to go back home and
[20:56] Tell hope he Had forgotten but besides
[20:58] it would Take too much time suddenly he
[21:01] thought of Thelma Ford a friend of his
[21:03] Who worked at a nearby variety Store She
[21:05] could possibly Tell him What he needed
[21:07] To Know once through the door Bill
[21:09] paused in the Sporting goods section to
[21:11] admire his favorite 22 Caliber rifle on
[21:13] the rack It was a beautiful firearm
[21:16] perfect for squirrel hunting Bill Had
[21:18] Wanted to buy it for over a year but it
[21:19] cost $7 and he couldn't even scrape
[21:22] Together the $3 for the down payment Hi

[22:34] in the afternoon Bill was annoyed When
[22:36] hope said She needed to stop at a
[22:38] variety Store before Church Bill stopped
[22:41] and hope hurried inside a few minutes
[22:43] later She returned carrying a small
[22:45] paper Bag She didn't say What She Had
[22:47] bought and since bill's Mind was fixed
[22:49] on Getting to redgard tabernacle as soon

[53:48] Por
[53:52] eso voy a leer una escritura si son tan
[53:55] amables de ponerse
[53:59] de bueno más bien vamos a estar leyendo
[54:01] varias
[54:05] escrituras
[54:06] Solamente les voy a pedir que se
[54:08] mantengan de pie por nuestra primera
[54:12] escritura libro de efesios capítulo
[54:17] 2 versículo 1
[54:27] empecemos con el versículo
[54:30] un aquí en mi Biblia dice la salvación a
[54:33] través de la
[54:42] gracia y él os dio vida a vosotros
[54:47] cuando estabais muertos en vuestros
[54:49] delitos y pecados
[55:04] loses anduviste en otro tiempo siguiendo
[55:06] la corriente de este mundo conforme al
[55:09] príncipe de la potestad del aire el
[55:12] espíritu que ahora opera en los hijos de
[55:15] desobediencia
[55:32] entre los cuales también todos nosotros
[55:34] vivimos en otro tiempo en los deseos de
[55:36] nuestra carne haciendo la voluntad de la
[55:39] carne y de los pensamientos y éramos por
[55:42] naturaleza hijos de ira lo mismo que los
[55:47] demás pero Dios que es rico en
[55:51] misericordia por por su gran amor con
[55:55] que nos amó
[55:58] Aún estando muertos en
[56:03] pecados nos dio vida juntamente con
[56:06] Cristo
[56:09] byce por gracia sois
[56:15] salvos que Dios agregue su bendición a
[56:18] la lectura de su palabra y pueden tomar
[56:21] sus
[56:22] lugares esta escritura
[56:28] una escritura
[56:32] hermosa al oír los mensajes de nuestro
[56:38] pastor hay muchos mensajes en el cual él
[56:41] toma esta escriptura
[56:44] y es una escritura que yo
[56:48] amo es una escritura que dibuja un
[56:53] cuadro de lo que esra
[56:58] antes de venir a
[57:01] Cristo y es una situación bastante
[57:08] errada la escritura usa palabras tales
[57:11] como la estando
[57:14] muertos es una palabra
[57:17] espantosa Pero entonces trae
[57:20] luz la luz de
[57:22] Dios la luz de
[57:24] Jesús sobre la
[57:28] Pero y dice y nos ha dado
[57:31] vida a través de
[57:33] él no es eso
[57:38] maravilloso ahora estoy hablando a los
[57:41] niños entonces nos
[57:44] dice que estamos en una situación
[57:47] bastante
[57:49] mala pero aún así él ha enviado a él ha
[57:53] enviado a
[57:55] Cristo el cual es nuestro Señor y
[57:59] Salvador a rescatarnos de esta
[58:02] situación Cuántos quieren ser
[58:09] rescatados Hoy estaremos hablando del
[58:11] plan de Dios de
[58:14] salvación y dice Dios quiere que yo sea
[58:18] salvo puedes decir eso conmigo
[58:26] am
[58:27] Dios quiere quiere que yo sea salvo que
[58:31] yo sea salvo
[58:37] amen vamos a leer esta escritura que se
[58:40] encuentra primera de
[58:43] Timoteo el capítulo 2 versículos 1 al
[58:50] cu Bueno ahora cómo nos damos cuenta que
[58:53] Dios quiere que seamos salvos
[58:56] Bueno vamos a su
[59:00] escritura y allí vamos a encontrar la
[59:19] respuesta exorto ante todo a que se
[59:22] hagan rogativas orones
[59:26] gra todos los
[59:38] hbres Por los reyes y por todos los que
[59:42] están en eminencia para que vivamos
[59:44] quieta y reposadamente en toda Piedad y
[59:52] honestidad porque esto es bueno y
[59:53] agradable delante de Dios nuestro
[59:59] salvad el cual quiere que todos los
[1:00:01] hombres sean
[1:00:04] salvos y que vengan al conocimiento de
[1:00:07] la
[1:00:09] verdad Entonces Dios quiere que todo
[1:00:12] hombre sea
[1:00:15] salvo y que venga al
[1:00:17] conocimiento al
[1:00:21] entendimiento de la
[1:00:23] verdad no es eso maravilloso
[1:00:26] es lo que Dios
[1:00:28] desea él también desea que usted
[1:00:33] ore bueno Pues en sí no tengo por quién
[1:00:37] orar Bueno entonces cómo Cómo podemos
[1:00:40] complacer a
[1:00:43] Dios él nos dice que Oremos por toda
[1:00:46] persona que está en eminencia y en
[1:00:50] autoridad por qué Para poder tener paz
[1:00:54] en nuestras vidas en Piedad y en
[1:00:58] honestidad
[1:01:03] am dice porque esto es bueno y aceptable
[1:01:06] en los ojos de
[1:01:09] Dios Aquí Entonces nos damos cuenta que
[1:01:12] Dios quiere que todo
[1:01:15] hombre y
[1:01:17] dama sean salvos
[1:01:20] am Bendito sea el señor
[1:01:27] Entonces él quiere Él desea que todos
[1:01:29] sean
[1:01:32] salvos en el libro de Lucas capítulo
[1:01:37] 5 del 27 al
[1:01:43] 32 en esta
[1:01:47] escritura leamos
[1:01:57] después de estas cosas salió y vio a un
[1:01:59] publicano llamado Levi sentado al banco
[1:02:02] de los tributos públicos y le dijo
[1:02:07] sígueme sígueme le dijo
[1:02:12] Jesús y Leví dejándolo todo se levantó y
[1:02:15] le
[1:02:18] siguió entonces Jesús le pide Ven
[1:02:22] conmigo y él fue obediente
[1:02:29] fíjese que cuando Jesús nos
[1:02:32] llama debemos de
[1:02:38] obedecer no solamente es el Jesús de la
[1:02:42] historia en el pasado cuando le llamó a
[1:02:46] lev aú en este día le está llamando a
[1:02:49] cada uno deed
[1:02:53] [Aplausos]
[1:02:56] que acabamos de leer desea que todo
[1:02:57] hombre sea
[1:03:00] salvo Bendito sea el
[1:03:04] señor y Leví le hizo gran banquete en su
[1:03:10] casa y había mucha compañía de
[1:03:13] publicanos y de otros que estaban a la
[1:03:15] mesa con
[1:03:20] ellos y los escribas y los fariseos
[1:03:23] murmuraban contra los discípulos
[1:03:25] diciendo
[1:03:31] por coméis y bebéis con publicanos y
[1:03:36] pecadores respondiendo Jesús les
[1:03:40] dijo los que están sanos no tienen
[1:03:43] necesidad de
[1:03:45] médico sino los
[1:03:48] enfermos no he venido a llamar al
[1:03:53] justo aores al
[1:03:58] arrepentimiento ahora podemos
[1:04:00] ver que
[1:04:03] Jesús desea que todo hombre sea
[1:04:07] salvo y él vino por
[1:04:11] pecadores y él quiere que ellos hagan
[1:04:15] qué que sean salvos y se
[1:04:19] arrepientan hay esa palabra arrepentir
[1:04:23] arrepentimiento estamos aprendiendo much
[1:04:26] jes y eso es
[1:04:29] bueno
[1:04:37] sigamos Mateo 4 del 18 al
[1:04:43] 22 uno de los ejemplos que le quiero
[1:04:47] mostrares es Jesús llamándole a sus
[1:04:52] discípulos eso es un tipo
[1:04:55] Es algo
[1:04:58] similar como cuando Jesús les llama a
[1:05:01] ustedes jovencitos a ustedes
[1:05:05] jovencitas aú a cada uno de nosotros que
[1:05:08] estamos sentados aquí en esta
[1:05:11] iglesia veamos Qué fue la respuesta de
[1:05:13] los
[1:05:15] discípulos el
[1:05:20] 418 andando Jesús justo al mar junto al
[1:05:24] mar de Galilea vio a her
[1:05:28] llamado Pedro y Andrés su
[1:05:31] hermano que echaban la red en el mar
[1:05:35] Porque eran
[1:05:36] Pescadores y les dijo Venid en Pos de
[1:05:41] m y y Os haré Pescadores de
[1:05:45] hombres ellos Entonces dejando al
[1:05:47] instante sus
[1:05:49] redes le
[1:05:52] siguieron Entonces cuando nosotros
[1:05:54] sentimos que Dios nos
[1:05:57] llama debemos de poner todo a un
[1:06:00] lado y
[1:06:04] seguirle porque si no lo hacemos
[1:06:06] recuerde en el
[1:06:09] principio estábamos muertos en delitos y
[1:06:13] pecados y él nos está diciendo salgan de
[1:06:16] esa
[1:06:17] situación y Síganme hacia la
[1:06:21] vida entonces los discípulos los
[1:06:23] apóstoles le siguieron
[1:06:26] y siguiendo de
[1:06:28] allí pasando de de allí vio a otros dos
[1:06:33] hermanos Jacobo hijo de
[1:06:36] zebedeo y Juan su
[1:06:39] hermano en el en la barca con zebedeo su
[1:06:43] padre que remendaban sus redes y los
[1:06:48] llamó Oigan vengan
[1:06:51] Síganme me imagino que dijo
[1:06:55] y y ellos dejando al instante La Barca y
[1:06:59] a su
[1:07:01] padre siguieron a Jesús qué
[1:07:06] cosa es algo maravilloso
[1:07:14] hermanos vamos a la siguiente
[1:07:22] escritura Quiero leer una cita del
[1:07:24] hermano branam

[1:09:29] Amén entonces
[1:09:34] todo todo lo que les pertenece a los
[1:09:39] adultos también es para
[1:09:43] ustedes y es la razón por la cual
[1:09:46] aprendemos de
[1:09:49] Jesús por eso nos enseñan aquí en la
[1:09:51] escuela de los pequeñitos
[1:09:57] quizás un pequeñito se pregunte acaso yo
[1:09:59] sea muy joven para que el espíritu santo
[1:10:01] mu en
[1:10:04] mí mire si usted quiere que el espíritu
[1:10:07] santo venga a morar en
[1:10:10] usted
[1:10:12] invítale Espíritu Santo ven y a morar en
[1:10:19] mí Dios bendiga
[1:10:22] her amamos
[1:10:43] al curso que hemos tenido nuestros
[1:10:46] servicios quiero ilustrar
[1:10:52] algo y voy a tener aquí que mis
[1:10:54] ayudantes me ayuden
[1:11:02] aquí
[1:11:06] tenemos al Espíritu
[1:11:09] Santo aquí tenemos la palabra de Dios Y
[1:11:12] tenemos la palabra de Dios
[1:11:25] esta cu tenemos al
[1:11:35] mundo alcanzan a
[1:11:39] ver pero aquí tenemos la agua bastante
[1:11:42] sucia Este es el
[1:11:45] mundo Este es el mundo y su
[1:11:49] suciedad es donde
[1:11:53] nacemos lug
[1:11:57] deodo Y
[1:11:59] suciedad entonces cuando
[1:12:01] nacemos nacemos dentro de
[1:12:05] eso ahora recuerde que dijimos que
[1:12:07] éramos
[1:12:11] inocentes hasta que llegamos a entender
[1:12:13] la diferencia entre el bien y el
[1:12:16] mal no hay nada dentro de
[1:12:19] nosotros inocencia
[1:12:25] y el
[1:12:26] mal pero aún así nacemos en esa
[1:12:30] sociedad no podemos
[1:12:33] evitarlo Así es como nosotros cada uno
[1:12:36] de nosotros llegamos al
[1:12:38] mundo esta botellita de
[1:12:41] plástico Allí está flotando sobre esa
[1:12:45] suciedad Cuando llegamos a la
[1:12:49] edad en donde empezamos a entender
[1:12:55] empezamos a tomar escogencias
[1:12:58] cuando escogemos es algo
[1:13:01] sencillo quieres naranja jugo de naranja
[1:13:04] o
[1:13:06] leche
[1:13:10] escogi quieres hacer cosas buenas o
[1:13:14] malas esa es otra
[1:13:19] escogencia Cuando tenemos la habilid yam
[1:13:30] empezamos a llenarnos
[1:13:34] con el fango del
[1:13:39] mundo no lo podemos
[1:13:44] evitar sucio
[1:13:47] verdad con esto nos empezamos aen
[1:13:55] real queremos
[1:13:58] esta quiere
[1:14:01] esto Quién quiere estar lleno de esta
[1:14:06] suciedad alguien quiere echarle un
[1:14:14] traguito entonces lo que
[1:14:17] sucede es que Dios que es rico en
[1:14:21] misericordia te ve
[1:14:24] adentro y dice es ese es mi
[1:14:28] hijo y dice
[1:14:30] hijo Quieres salir and y
[1:14:35] seguirme Yes sí padre quiero seguirte
[1:14:39] and p te saca de esta suciedad de esta
[1:14:45] suciedad te saca de esta
[1:14:48] suciedad te
[1:14:51] elige así como eligió a los discípulos
[1:14:55] Así cuando él iba caminando él te
[1:14:59] elige pero estamos
[1:15:01] sucios pero él no ve la
[1:15:05] suciedad Pero hay un proceso por el cual
[1:15:07] Tenemos que
[1:15:09] pasar y ese es el plan de Dios para
[1:15:12] vuestra
[1:15:14] salvación porque su espíritu
[1:15:18] santo ahora recuerde Todos queremos que
[1:15:20] el espíritu santo mu en nosotros
[1:15:25] venir a morar en
[1:15:27] vosotros si estamos llenos de
[1:15:31] suciedad una de las cosas que tenemos
[1:15:33] que
[1:15:35] hacer es confesar nuestro
[1:15:38] pecado tenemos que arrepentirnos
[1:15:42] y decir
[1:15:46] señor estoy tan arrepentido por las
[1:15:49] cosas que hago
[1:15:51] [Aplausos]
[1:15:56] y porque yo creo en
[1:15:59] ti Tú eres el Dios
[1:16:02] Todopoderoso yo quiero que tú vengas y
[1:16:04] me
[1:16:05] salves Yo ya no quiero hacer lo
[1:16:09] malo Quiero que me llenes con tu
[1:16:11] espíritu
[1:16:16] santo entonces quizás alguien venga
[1:16:20] y pued será
[1:16:23] o hermano alej Hermano
[1:16:27] Ernesto uno de los
[1:16:31] ministros y entonces usted acepta al
[1:16:33] Señor
[1:16:34] Jesucristo como su
[1:16:37] Salvador al
[1:16:40] confesarlo el hermano bram dice ahí
[1:16:44] tengo la
[1:16:46] pantalla momento
[1:17:00] dice estos dos pequeñitos edades de seis
[1:17:03] y 8 años que estaban aquí en el altar
[1:17:05] esta
[1:17:06] mañana ahora esto se refiere a una
[1:17:09] pregunta que le preguntaron al Hermano
[1:17:12] Branham en el mensaje intitulado Dios
[1:17:14] siendo
[1:17:19] malentendido A qué edad es aconsejable
[1:17:22] de que ellos se bauticen
[1:17:25] Entonces los jovencitos de edades de de
[1:17:28] se y o estaban en el altar en la
[1:17:31] mañana confesaron sus pecados se
[1:17:38] arrepintieron y ahora le hacen la
[1:17:40] pregunta A qué edad es aconsejable que
[1:17:43] ellos sean
[1:17:44] bautizados dijo entre más pronto
[1:17:48] posible arrepiéntanse inmediatamente y
[1:17:51] sean
[1:17:51] bautizados en el nombre del señor
[1:17:53] Jesucristo
[1:17:55] ahora es la pregunta número uno yo
[1:17:58] aconsejo yo aconsejaría
[1:18:01] eso pero nos encontramos en las
[1:18:03] escrituras
[1:18:04] dice es eso
[1:18:08] escritural Bueno cuando Pedro predicó en
[1:18:11] el día de
[1:18:15] Pentecostés 3000 almas fueron salvas Y
[1:18:18] bautizadas esa vez
[1:18:25] en el señor fueron
[1:18:29] bautizados Entonces en cuanto Usted cree
[1:18:32] en el señor y le acepta como su
[1:18:35] Salvador vaya directamente a la
[1:18:39] agua y
[1:18:41] confiese allí mismo joven o viejo no
[1:18:46] importa quién sea usted
[1:18:49] dice bueno quizás estos pequeñitos estén
[1:18:52] muy jóvenes Jesús dijo
[1:18:57] Dejad a los niños venir a
[1:18:59] mí y no se los
[1:19:02] impis porque de Tales es el reino de
[1:19:10] Dios yo me yo pondría la mano sobre
[1:19:12] cualquiera niño que quiera venir al
[1:19:14] altar y ser bautizado a cualquiera
[1:19:17] edad no me importa la edad que
[1:19:22] tengan Ese es el profeta hablando
[1:19:25] am no está
[1:19:27] estimulado Bendito sea el
[1:19:35] señor tengo que tranquilizar
[1:19:43] acá
[1:19:47] entonces Dios nos saca de esa
[1:19:51] suciedad y somos bautizados amén
[1:19:55] ahora
[1:19:58] entendemos que entramos pecadores
[1:20:01] secos y salemos pecadores
[1:20:07] mojados bueno Eso quiere decir que el
[1:20:10] bautismo en agua no nos quita la
[1:20:12] suciedad de la
[1:20:14] carne pero a ver dónde está la palabra
[1:20:16] de Dios tra la
[1:20:18] palabra ábrela por
[1:20:20] favor pero en el momento que usted
[1:20:22] empieza a oír la palabra de Dios
[1:20:25] Y esa palabra le empieza a lavar y le
[1:20:30] lava y lo lava y lo
[1:20:33] talla y lo lava por dentro y por fuera y
[1:20:36] por el resto de su
[1:20:38] vida porque como Cristiano nunca vamos a
[1:20:41] dejar de oír la palabra de Dios Y esa
[1:20:44] palabra nos
[1:20:46] limpia y él asegura que estamos limpia
[1:20:49] nos
[1:20:51] santifica y una vez ya estando
[1:20:53] limpiecitos
[1:20:56] nos
[1:20:57] toma y nos pone nos coloca a un lado
[1:21:02] para
[1:21:06] servicio Y entonces acá viene el
[1:21:09] espíritu santo Dónde está el espíritu
[1:21:13] santo y empieza el espíritu santo a
[1:21:16] llenarte a
[1:21:17] llenarte con amor con paz con paciencia
[1:21:23] con gozo con con mansedumbre
[1:21:26] con benignidad y todo que fue Jesús y
[1:21:30] empieza usted a a imitar a Jesús usted
[1:21:34] empieza a hablar como
[1:21:36] Jesús usted empieza a orar por el
[1:21:40] pueblo usted empieza a manifestar las
[1:21:42] mismas obras que Jesús
[1:21:46] manifestó Por qué Porque es que ya no es
[1:21:49] el hermano alejado ya no es el otro
[1:21:52] hermano ya no es el hermano Ernesto
[1:21:55] es es Jesús viviendo en
[1:21:58] ellos manifestando las mismas
[1:22:01] obras que Jesús hizo en aquel entonces
[1:22:04] el día de
[1:22:06] hoy y es lo que tiene para cada uno de
[1:22:09] nosotros ustedes serán vasos
[1:22:12] pequeños en los cuales Dios va a
[1:22:16] morar eso está
[1:22:20] maravilloso y es solamente a través de
[1:22:22] su gracia y su misericordia no es nada
[1:22:24] que nosotros hicimos para
[1:22:26] merecer simplemente somos
[1:22:29] obedientes le
[1:22:31] seguimos somos como
[1:22:33] [Música]
[1:22:34] corderitos no es eso
[1:22:37] maravilloso es algo
[1:22:39] maravilloso Es algo grande
[1:22:48] grandioso o quizs dimos bueno es que a m
[1:22:51] me gusta
[1:22:53] laedad Dónde está toda la enfermedad
[1:22:58] adicciones
[1:22:59] muerte muerte
[1:23:03] literal mire porque una vez teniendo
[1:23:06] contacto con
[1:23:10] Jesucristo algo sucedió en el calvario
[1:23:13] Cuántos están Cuántos reconocen
[1:23:16] eso cuando Jesús
[1:23:19] vino ahora Jesús era Dios en
[1:23:22] carne falar
[1:23:25] siendo Cordero
[1:23:27] inocente él llevó todos nuestros pecados
[1:23:30] y los llevó al calvario y cuando le
[1:23:34] crucificaron él fue a la
[1:23:37] tumba y
[1:23:39] fue y se encontró con el
[1:23:42] le tocó la puerta y dijo Dame las
[1:23:46] llaves Cuáles
[1:23:48] llaves las llaves de la del infierno de
[1:23:52] la muerte
[1:23:54] las llaves puso una
[1:23:56] [Aplausos]
[1:23:57] patada para
[1:24:00] nosotros regresa a la tierra
[1:24:07] resucita servimos a un Dios
[1:24:12] poderoso tomó de
[1:24:15] nuevo Lo que ad había
[1:24:19] perdido é fue ese sacrificio perfecto
[1:24:28] hubo un joven
[1:24:30] rico un tipo
[1:24:32] bueno él está
[1:24:36] aquí Él hizo puras cosas
[1:24:44] buenas dice mientras que él caminaba por
[1:24:46] el
[1:24:47] camino uno vino a él inclinándose
[1:24:51] arrodillándose y le dice
[1:24:56] [Aplausos]
[1:24:59] maestro Qué debo hacer para heredar la
[1:25:02] vida
[1:25:05] eterna ahora si acaso usted pudiese
[1:25:08] encontrarse con
[1:25:09] Jesús y usted le dijera a
[1:25:13] Jesús mi mamá ya
[1:25:16] falleció mi abuelito ya
[1:25:20] falleció y yo no quiero morir
[1:25:24] Qué puedo hacer para ser salvo y tener
[1:25:26] vida
[1:25:27] eterna quizás él le
[1:25:29] diga algo como le dijo a este joven rico
[1:25:33] Jesús
[1:25:34] respondiendo le dice Por qué me llamas
[1:25:38] bueno no hay nadie Bueno solo
[1:25:41] uno él es
[1:25:44] Dios Bueno ya conoces los
[1:25:47] mandamientos No cometas adulterio no
[1:25:51] asesines no robes
[1:25:54] mentira no
[1:25:57] defraudes honra a tu padre y a tu
[1:26:01] madre y El joven rico le le responde y
[1:26:04] le dice
[1:26:08] maestro todas estas cosas lo he hecho
[1:26:10] desde mi juventud Yo he sido persona
[1:26:15] buena entonces Jesús viéndolo le
[1:26:19] amó y le dijo una cosa careces
[1:26:25] ve y vende todo lo que tengas y dáselo a
[1:26:27] los
[1:26:29] pobres Y entonces tendrás tesoro en el
[1:26:32] cielo y
[1:26:34] ven toma tu cruz y
[1:26:39] sígueme él nos dice a nosotros que le
[1:26:43] sigamos y él estuvo muy triste cuando
[1:26:46] oyó
[1:26:46] esto estaba triste con lo que con la
[1:26:49] respuesta de Jesús y él se fue
[1:26:52] tristemente
[1:26:54] porque tenía grandes
[1:26:56] posesiones ve
[1:26:58] jovencitos en ocasiones nuestras
[1:27:02] posesiones son de la manera que
[1:27:05] pensamos Bueno yo no puedo aceptar a
[1:27:08] Jesús porque quiero ser chido y suave en
[1:27:11] la
[1:27:14] escuela Yo no quiero
[1:27:17] cambiar yo quiero seguir así como
[1:27:23] estoy Este joven tenía grandes
[1:27:25] posesiones que él ella quería estas
[1:27:28] cosas pero aún él quería vida
[1:27:33] eterna pero él no estaba dispuesto a
[1:27:36] seguir a Jesús y a
[1:27:38] obedecerle recuerde nosotros tenemos que
[1:27:46] escoger tenemos que hacer la escogencia
[1:27:49] de darle la espalda a todas aquellas las
[1:27:51] cosas que son contra la palabra de Dios
[1:27:55] se mete uno a la
[1:27:58] computadora quizás Ver cosas con
[1:28:00] nuestros ojos que no
[1:28:17] debemos quizás no queremos dejar
[1:28:21] eso esas cosas que vemos y oímos
[1:28:25] esas cosas no más
[1:28:26] empeoran llegan a ser
[1:28:30] adicciones no no no yo yo yo controlo
[1:28:33] esto y sabe una
[1:28:37] cosa esta esta agua este
[1:28:41] lodo se convierte en concreto en cemento
[1:28:44] y lo empieza a
[1:28:46] inmovilizar y antes de lo que antes que
[1:28:49] se dé
[1:28:50] cuenta no tiene control usted
[1:28:54] ahora si sucede
[1:28:56] esto la única cosa que tiene que hacer
[1:28:58] usted es clamar a él y decir padre estoy
[1:29:02] tan
[1:29:03] arrepentido estoy tan arrepentido que no
[1:29:06] Oy tu llamado Yo ya no quiero vivir en
[1:29:09] esa sociedad quiero ser obediente a tu
[1:29:12] palabra quiero
