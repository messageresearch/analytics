[17:40] monster and I'm going to take
[17:45] this
[17:53] away so that each and every one of you
[17:55] can see what it is that God has within
[17:58] his word
[18:04] I've read two scriptures
[18:09] here one of them is in Mar and the other
[18:12] one is
[18:16] inis Bible says that they shall take up
[18:22] serp how many believe that that word is
[18:25] the truth
[18:31] he goes on to say that the serpent is
[18:34] very
[18:41] subtle in order to take up serpents we
[18:44] must be
[18:55] more do you believe that God has his
[18:58] within the church so it can take up and
[19:01] cast out
[19:16] serpent we see how that the Bible
[19:19] explains to us that the two things would
[19:21] be so close that if it were possible it
[19:23] would dece the very very elect the very
[19:26] elect
[19:30] how many of you think that you can be
[19:34] deceived isn't it true that we all think
[19:37] that we can't be
[19:41] deceived but let's take the mask off of
[19:44] Mr
[19:46] monster so you can see him face to
[19:51] face and find out what place each and
[19:54] every one of our one of us is
[19:57] in the first that I would like to bring
[20:06] forth is that God and the devil are very
[20:10] much
[20:11] alike how many of you knew
[20:14] that say Amen if you knew
[20:21] that there are many people that don't
[20:23] realize or were not aware that the devil
[20:26] and God look the same
[20:30] they look so much
[20:33] alike that God is in the
[20:39] temple and God's people turn to one
[20:44] side and when the people turn to one
[20:49] side they take God out of the temple and
[20:53] put the devil in
[20:55] there so when the people look back at
[20:58] the
[21:00] since they just finished seeing
[21:03] God they think it's
[21:06] God and they are worshiping
[21:09] God but actually what they're worshiping
[21:12] is the
[21:13] devil the Bible
[21:18] says so much that he s in the house of
[21:22] God as
[21:26] God being like unto
[21:31] God that's
[21:37] tremendous Christ and the Antichrist are
[21:41] alike how many knew that say
[21:47] Amen so we know that Christ is the
[21:52] anointed and we know that the anointed
[21:55] of the age is the messenger
[22:03] so the Antichrist is anyone that goes
[22:06] against the teaching that Christ
[22:12] brought and only through the word of God
[22:14] can we know which is Christ and
[22:18] which thanks be to God for his
[22:26] word I see then that God and the devil
[22:30] are
[22:35] alike you look at both of them and you
[22:38] say they're the
[22:43] same people know who's the devil and who
[22:46] is
[22:48] God Christ and the Antichrist are
[22:55] alike there are other things that are
[23:05] and hate look
[23:09] Alik that is the Mr
[23:15] monster off of whom I'm going to remove
[23:19] the mask
[23:22] tonight God and the devil look alike
[23:28] Christ and the Antichrist look
[23:33] alike love and hate look
[23:39] Alik that there is Mr
[23:46] monster we see that when God set man
[23:49] upon the
[23:53] Earth he set him there under the law of
[23:57] love
[24:00] because God is
[24:09] love but then the devil came planting
[24:12] something contrary to that
[24:16] love and what he planted was
[24:21] hate and it looked like it was love
[24:30] and that woman swalled that pill and
[24:32] brought forth
[24:38] hate which is the monster that is
[24:40] destroying
[24:47] mankind the serpent planted Discord in
[24:50] order to turn the woman against the
[24:53] [Music]
[24:56] man and then
[24:58] used the the woman then used the
[25:04] woman to turn man against
[25:11] God we see then the fruit of his labor
[25:15] was a man called
[25:17] [Music]
[25:20] Cain we see that the Bible teaches us
[25:23] that Kain became Wrath
[25:29] his rage
[25:35] prode we see that rage and hate go hand
[25:39] in
[25:42] hand and this took him to the place of
[25:45] killing his own brother do you
[25:51] see looks like
[25:54] love the serpent is so subtle
[26:01] and fills people with hate and people
[26:04] think that it's
[26:06] love now remember one
[26:10] thing that love build or raises
[26:17] up but hate destroys destructs and
[26:20] knocks
[26:22] down let's take an
[26:26] example uh let's take the marriage
[26:36] couple the Devil comes and destroys the
[26:39] relations of the couple with the excuse
[26:42] of that is
[26:44] uh that it's
[26:46] [Music]
[26:50] love the Devil comes with the mask of
[26:54] love that's Mr monster now
[27:04] so it makes the woman think that that
[27:06] man actually loves
[27:10] her but actually what that man has for
[27:14] her is
[27:18] hate the first thing that that man has
[27:21] to do to went over that married
[27:26] woman is to turn turn the woman against
[27:29] her husband is that
[27:35] right so
[27:38] that Cova hat his uh the one he's
[27:43] battling
[27:46] against he that hate is to whom she's
[27:49] married
[27:51] with he hates the married
[27:56] man but then he presents himself to the
[27:59] woman in love but he has a
[28:02] mask and it looks like it's
[28:08] love is
[28:13] hate if you remember some time
[28:20] ago on a few occasions I I mentioned it
[28:22] to my
[28:26] dad oh I've mentioned my my dad to all
[28:29] of
[28:33] you I believe that my dad was and is a
[28:37] tremendous man of
[28:40] God when I was born my father was
[28:43] already a
[28:48] minister so you can say that I was born
[28:51] in the womb of the
[28:55] church my father was a pastor
[29:01] he had approximately 500 members in his
[29:05] [Music]
[29:09] church and some of those members hated
[29:12] my
[29:15] dad see hate has a
[29:21] mask am am am am on this mask across the
[29:26] whole front are written the words love
[29:28] love love
[29:34] love but actually benath the mask is
[29:37] full of
[29:42] hate those people that claim to be
[29:48] Christians treated me in a very low
[29:52] manner
[29:58] to the point that I ran away from
[30:07] home you see that when those people
[30:10] Christian people from that church
[30:12] treated me
[30:15] wrongly then I ran
[30:20] away I answered what they did with rage
[30:26] [Music]
[30:28] and that rage produced
[30:36] hate that rage that I felt I felt it
[30:39] against my
[30:43] parents and I felt it towards the
[30:45] members of the
[30:48] church and I felt it against God
[30:53] [Music]
[30:58] I thought that I was defending
[31:06] myself I thought I hated my parents and
[31:09] that I hated the members and that I
[31:11] hated
[31:16] God but actually all that was manifested
[31:20] against my own
[31:23] self I Thought I Loved myself
[31:29] but actually it was a
[31:31] mask it was Mr
[31:35] monster I hated my own
[31:43] self from my home in that rage and
[31:52] hate when I left home for years for
[31:55] weeks and months I slept on the
[32:00] sidewalks I was a
[32:05] vagabond during this time I had a very
[32:08] improper
[32:12] diet when I was 18 years old I weighed
[32:14] 113
[32:19] pounds because of the improper diet that
[32:22] I had my face was
[32:25] ruined my skin
[32:31] when I left home this red me into
[32:35] drugs I used different kinds of
[32:42] drugs one of my friends that talked and
[32:45] played with
[32:49] me they sent him to the gas chamber
[32:52] executed him in the state of
[32:55] California and do you know why they
[32:58] killed
[33:00] him because he said that he loved a
[33:07] woman this woman refused to dance with
[33:15] him because of that reason this man
[33:18] killed a child that belonged to the
[33:22] woman when this man did this
[33:28] actually he was killing
[33:35] himself he thought he loved himself but
[33:38] actually he hated
[33:42] himself for example let's take an the
[33:45] example of
[33:50] today they just arrested an official of
[33:54] the
[33:56] city he was a married
[34:01] man for one reason or another he
[34:04] divorced his
[34:06] wife I believe that they they've been
[34:09] divorced for over six
[34:11] years I believe he has two
[34:16] children his wife lives in the state of
[34:21] Washington he uh met and came together
[34:24] with another
[34:25] lady and he was going to to marry
[34:29] [Music]
[34:31] her but then their relationship broke
[34:38] off and the rage that he felt began to
[34:41] multiply within
[34:43] him and that hate that he
[34:47] had when he face came face to face with
[34:50] his
[34:53] hate he was facing Mr monster
[34:59] but the name that this sir has is
[35:05] love he began to defend
[35:11] himself and being that through that love
[35:14] for his own
[35:16] self which the name of it
[35:20] is he took a revolver and shot his buddy
[35:29] when he was shooting he was actually
[35:31] shooting at
[35:33] himself because that's the way the devil
[35:37] is the devil doesn't S another to kill
[35:41] you he comes with the mask of
[35:44] love and you yourself
[35:49] destroy the Devil and the members of the
[35:53] church did not mess up my
[35:56] face they didn't give me the
[35:58] [Music]
[36:00] drug I injected and drank the drugged
[36:06] myself I myself slept in the
[36:10] gutter and I thought I loved
[36:13] myself because I saw the
[36:15] Mas but now I can
[36:18] see it's Mr
[36:21] monster under the mask of
[36:25] love when that man here in
[36:31] Phoenix fired those bullets of that
[36:38] gun heing
[36:40] [Music]
[36:46] his I was as I was carrying
[36:51] counter I was hiding under a
[36:55] bush torn apart and
[36:59] destroyed my face was like a
[37:05] plague I didn't know who had destroyed
[37:08] my
[37:10] sin I thought it was the
[37:13] church I thought it was
[37:17] religion I thought it was the
[37:23] Hypocrites I I didn't know that it was
[37:26] myself that has brought that plague to
[37:28] my
[37:29] face I I weighed
[37:32] 113 I was as tall as I
[37:35] am I was going into the
[37:41] grave in a while they would either take
[37:43] me to the prison or to a gas
[37:47] chamber and all this time I thought I
[37:49] loved
[37:52] myself because I follow this Mr
[37:56] moner and until
[37:58] now that I realized that Mr
[38:02] mon was a multitude behind
[38:06] him people think they love
[38:10] themselves they hate
[38:13] themselves while I was
[38:17] there there I made a covenant with
[38:21] God say Lord I want to serve you I
[38:25] Surrender unto you
[38:28] I didn't surrender to a denomination to
[38:31] a church to a group of
[38:35] men I surrendered to the Lord Jesus
[38:39] Christ afterwards I was baptized in
[38:42] Christian
[38:44] baptism I went from church to
[38:49] church because every church I went to I
[38:51] was a strange
[38:54] bird remember one thing
[38:59] that when God calls a
[39:03] man he lets that man go through certain
[39:09] situations and God permitted for me to
[39:11] go through all these things in my
[39:15] life so that in this year of
[39:19] 1982 I could take Mr monsters mask
[39:24] away and you could benefit from what God
[39:27] has given
[39:33] so that you could see this man face to
[39:35] face and say depart from me you
[39:40] demon in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:44] Christ because all things should be done
[39:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:50] Christ in 1963 I accepted this message
[39:58] truly I accepted it with all of my
[40:01] heart but then I began to see certain
[40:07] things when these things came I was
[40:10] filled with
[40:16] rage that raage come goes hand in hand
[40:19] with Hate It produced
[40:22] hate but I realized
[40:25] it and I began to to cry out to God Lord
[40:29] take me out of
[40:31] [Music]
[40:36] this I myself was digging my own
[40:42] grave when I turned around to the people
[40:45] that I saw I saw them with
[40:48] hate and I thought it was them that I
[40:53] hat I found out that it was myself I hat
[40:58] because God is
[41:00] love and where God lives the devil
[41:03] cannot
[41:04] live but love is there cannot
[41:07] exist but they look
[41:09] Alik and it has the mask and it is
[41:13] written that it is
[41:17] love when I recognized
[41:20] this I told the
[41:22] Lord I'll serve you father
[41:28] that's when I got here to Arizona in
[41:32] 1969 I promised to serve him with all of
[41:34] my
[41:39] heart I would like to say sincerely that
[41:42] I have been serving the Lord with all of
[41:44] my heart for 13
[41:48] years now we are in
[41:54] 1982 I accepted this message 20 years
[41:57] ago
[41:58] [Music]
[42:01] I never believe that I would see what
[42:04] I'm seeing in the message
[42:07] today I see the
[42:11] world I see the world filled with
[42:14] [Music]
[42:16] hate they kill and kill and continue to
[42:20] kill they said that the other day a
[42:25] minister in San Francisco got mad
[42:28] because they made fun of
[42:30] him he took his car and ran over some
[42:35] people he thought he was preaching
[42:39] love he didn't know that the mask said
[42:44] love but within him was
[42:49] hate do you think that if the love of
[42:51] God is in your
[42:54] heart you think that hate can remain
[42:58] there ha cannot remain
[43:02] there there is room for either one or
[43:05] the
[43:10] other I never thought I'd see the hate
[43:13] that I see in this
[43:18] message in no other place have I seen
[43:21] such hate as in this
[43:24] message when I read that letter
[43:29] I looked at
[43:33] it how can this
[43:36] be then the Lord came down and
[43:40] said
[43:43] Bernie people don't hate
[43:48] you they don't hate
[43:53] me because the Bible tells me the
[43:56] message
[43:58] the word tells
[43:59] me and God told me they don't hate
[44:04] you they hate
[44:08] themselves for
[44:17] example they tell the young people don't
[44:20] smoke because smoking causes cancer
[44:27] and they get mad and they say what
[44:29] difference does it make to you whether I
[44:30] smoke or
[44:33] not and then under the mask of love that
[44:37] they love their own selves they take
[44:39] the smoke smoke and
[44:43] smoke they think it's
[44:45] love and they don't know that they hate
[44:50] themselves because cigarettes produces
[44:53] cancer until the day they die
[45:00] people get mad and through this madness
[45:03] it creates
[45:05] hate and in that
[45:08] hate they begin to make
[45:12] mistakes and they think they hate
[45:18] me they don't realize that they hate
[45:23] themselves for
[45:25] example they
[45:28] they stop coming to
[45:30] church they stop paying their
[45:34] ties and under the mask of
[45:38] love but it's a monster called
[45:41] hate I won't go to
[45:45] church I'm going to show Garcia that I
[45:48] won't give
[45:50] him I love
[45:53] myself I'm going to defend myself now
[45:58] and he's shouting out
[46:01] loudly let say that his name is
[46:07] gono he's
[46:11] shouting not
[46:12] me not
[46:14] you he
[46:19] is cursed are you cursed are
[46:24] you be cursed
[46:28] says you are cursed with a
[46:31] curse but since he has a mask I love
[46:35] myself I defend myself I
[46:39] protect I demand my
[46:42] rights realize it's
[46:44] mon has a mask it's called love
[46:59] I don't curse
[47:03] anyone they curse
[47:07] themselves now the devil is very
[47:12] subtle a brother gets
[47:14] [Music]
[47:17] mad he says he says I hate
[47:20] him he sees
[47:23] another and he begins to uh Gumble back
[47:30] bite do you know I can see your face
[47:33] when you're
[47:38] mad this the way Cain's face look is
[47:42] what I see in your
[47:44] face the majority of the Devils have
[47:47] gone out but when I came in that's why
[47:51] Jimmy was having
[47:52] [Music]
[47:54] trouble because the devil is tremendous
[47:58] and he I knew said I would take his mask
[48:01] away he filled with rage and
[48:05] hate that that cursed
[48:08] one Mis Minister that
[48:12] woman I hate this
[48:15] church you don't hate the church you
[48:19] hate
[48:20] yourself you destroy
[48:23] yourself because when they went out of
[48:25] Egypt
[48:27] over two million came
[48:29] out but only two entered
[48:31] in they accepted the
[48:38] word but over two million were murmuring

[57:45] lady and because she refused
[57:49] him he killed her
[57:54] child he was about to die in the gas
[57:59] chamber I remember how I thought much
[58:01] upon
[58:03] him I can look back to that
[58:06] year of
[58:09] 1951 and I could say
[58:14] this man wasn't sent by anyone
[58:19] else sent his own self to that
[58:23] gas that love that he had
[58:27] for he for himself that
[58:29] woman caus him to kill that
[58:33] child the same thing

[58:39] Cain made him kill
[58:43] Abel that love that you think you have
[58:45] for

[59:07] mask this
[59:09] [Music]
[59:15] afternoon and I have set the word in the
[59:18] hands of them that hear
[59:21] me now it's as it was back then
[59:27] when it was on Pilot's
[59:32] hands these people can wash their
[59:37] hands but it's out of my
[59:41] responsibility and have declared your
[59:43] true
[59:45] name that your name isn't really
[59:48] [Music]
[59:49] love your name is
[59:52] ha your name is
[59:56] you're a
[59:57] monster and I come against
[1:00:01] you seeing that I declared the word
[1:00:05] now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:12] Christ I order you to turn loose of each
[1:00:15] and

[1:24:32] Ministry we just want to wish you a
[1:24:35] blessed happy merry
[1:24:40] Christmas and I just wanted to to remind
[1:24:43] you if we can keep the Moreno Family in
[1:24:48] prayers um also if we can keep brother
[1:24:51] brother John Alvarado in prayers
[1:24:56] I believe he's still
[1:24:59] hospitalized and so we can keep him in
[1:25:02] prayer also I believe sister um Modesta
[1:25:06] Martinez is hospitalized as
[1:25:10] well we please keep her in
[1:25:12] prayer um just received a couple of
[1:25:15] texts um one from from brother Mike Vega
[1:25:18] he's asking for
[1:25:22] prayer and also um brother Ary
[1:25:26] mag I believe um Ethan Israel Ean Israel
[1:25:32] um his his um oxygen is not at the level
[1:25:35] where where it should
[1:25:37] be um even though he he is
[1:25:41] improving and you it's good that we
[1:25:44] serve a living
[1:25:45] God and and we place everything into his
[1:25:50] hands he we're not
[1:25:52] alone he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:56] forever and if if you can just
[1:26:00] believe all things are

[1:26:05] keep them in
[1:26:08] prayer and in unity in
[1:26:11] that um once again I want to thank
[1:26:15] everyone um and and not
[1:26:19] um last but not
[1:26:22] least if we can um keep our pastor in

[1:26:29] a paradox if I can say it that
[1:26:32] way um and and it's it's just
[1:26:36] unbelievable um but all things are
[1:26:38] possible for them that
[1:26:41] believe and we thank God that um the
[1:26:45] angel of this church is is still with
[1:26:50] us and just for that I'm I'm so grateful

[1:27:20] anyways if you got to lie through your
[1:27:23] teeth and say that's what I've always
[1:27:28] wanted and so um you know there's a
[1:27:31] saying something's better than
[1:27:37] nothing and so you know we don't take
[1:27:40] anything
[1:27:42] lightly uh we always show
[1:27:46] appreciation um because we've been given
[1:27:49] the greatest gift that mankind can
[1:27:52] receive

[1:27:59] glory and he took on a tent of
[1:28:03] Flesh and he he came to take your
[1:28:08] place your
[1:28:11] place so that we could take his
[1:28:14] place and so that's the greatest
[1:28:17] gift that's why we're
[1:28:20] here um to lift up The Only Name
[1:28:25] above all names the only mediator
[1:28:27] between God and
