just want to remind us and oh well what I remember why the reason we're here I think it looks really nice all these these beautiful lights and listening to the beautiful songs and there's just something about Christmas that brings out the happy in me it brings the little kid out in me and but it's more than just presents and hot chocolate and pictures with Santa and our favorite Christmas movies and stockings it's it's so much more than that it's so much more than than jingle bells and Frosty the Snowman and gingerbread houses you know but there is a house there is a house that that is important during Christmastime in that houses is your heart and that's the house where the Lord Jesus Christ wants to live and that's what Christmas is about to me about the night where Jesus Christ came down and was born in a manger so that all of us can see that it doesn't matter what the situation looks like it doesn't matter what the outside looks like if you would just be willing to let him be born in your heart in the stable in the manger of your heart he would come down and he would be born and he would be the king and ruler of your life and if you would make that decision your life will never be the same I'm just gonna ask that you just think about that well well this next song comes on it's one of my favorite songs the song is entitled all holy night [Music] Oh Holy Night the stars are brightly shining it is the night of our dear saviors birth lonely the world in sin and error pining till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth [Music] the weary world rejoices boy [Music] whoa [Music] oh my when Christ was born [Music] [Music] [Music] oh if you'd like to join me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh praise God you may be seated so there was this little lady this young virgin lady she was walking and an angel came to her and this young girl's name was Mary thank you his brother yeah and his wife get ready for the for the last song and the angel stopped her and said you are special amongst women and you will give birth to a son and you'll call him Jesus and the Bible says that Mary was was troubled she she she was shocked and she thought what is this what type of weight what type of way to greet a person is that this angel probably just had all this light around them and scaring the poor little girl she's probably about 14 15 years old we have about 14 15 year old girl here girls can can you can you stand up our 14 15 year old young little girls 13 look at that look imagine angel appearing to these beautiful young ladies right here they'd have to talk to brother Joseph first but the angels showed up to these this young lady and said you're gonna have a son and she's so innocent she said I don't even know any guys I've never even been with the man how am I gonna have a son and he said don't fear for the holy ghost is gonna overshadow you and you will conceive in your womb and you will have a son and you'll call him Jesus and you know what she said she was so obedient she said be it unto me according to your word basically that just means sir I don't understand how but exactly what you just said I believe it and so be it it'll happen to me however you say and today that same angel and that same message is here before us and I'm telling you I might not be as handsome as the angel Gabriel these lights pale in comparison to the light that was surrounding the angel on that day and you know what I am just a human I fell but I bring an Angels message to you this evening and if you would believe what I have to say you can conceive the Son of God within you and I want to say Phoenix Tabernacle you are chosen and you're special amongst all churches because this night God has decided to tell you that Jesus Christ the Son of God wants to be born in your heart and if you can receive the word of God in the womb of your mind you can give birth to a life that will completely change your world he can rule and reign like nothing else and you'll change your life you don't have to be the same person you don't have to struggle you don't have to fear you don't have to doubt you don't have to be depressed you don't have to have anxiety you can have a new king rule in your heart if you would receive that word can you imagine the King of Kings the Lord of lords being born in your heart you would think oh why why would the King of Kings want to be born in my filthy old heart you don't know me burning a third you don't know what I've been through you don't know the kind of thoughts that I think well you know what I do know that he was born in a nasty stable next to a bunch of donkeys and and sheep and and and pigs and and all of their mess and you're worth so much more than that and he wants to be warned in your heart now as you sit there with every head bowed pour fire water if everybody will just close their eyes and and bow their heads if that sounds good to you if you would be interested in having Almighty God come down into your heart and be born in there again or for the first time tonight would you just raise your hands and say keep me in prayer over the room god bless you god bless you thank you for raising your hand god bless you as this next song gets played and we get ready to dismiss I just want you to think about that uplifted hand that you put up and let's let's make this more than just the concert tonight let's invite the Lord Jesus Christ inside our heart so we can have the blesses a blessed Christmas is that okay amen god bless you god bless you [Music] Oh unexpected would you [Music] her child [Music] unlikely Sphero weapon is mother shadows to child is this who we prayed it for this is how many kings to jump from their Thrones how many Lords have abandoned their bows how many grains for me and how many [Music] fathers came up there for me bringing high caves to the [Music] that we have whether costly you me because we believe [Music] his honor and frankincense war his pleasure and mirthful cross he'll suffer - you believe is this movie Quaid is [Music] big company for me [Applause] [Music] that is [Music] me [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Oh [Music] Oh Oh for you Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen just want to share a little testimony how God has everything under control is that okay amen so my wife had two songs that she didn't know what she was gonna sing and one was oh holy night and the other one was that one and I I made her scene oh holy night but God knew he wanted that song to be sung and where that came to me what we were in the back well after service that I already started and he said is everyone for one more song we want to sing this song and he told me what song it was and I thought of course I'm not going to get in the way of the Lord like if Lord wants that song to be sung Amen and so I thought that was very beautiful thank you before we dismiss I just want to give an opportunity for those hands that went up because it was quite a few hands that went up and we'd like to pray for you and last I checked we're still a church that praise amen so even though the concert is done it's okay that we pray for those people that wanted to receive the Lord Jesus Christ I saw a lot of young people that rose their hands and I would love to pray but I get I pray a little bit better when I get to put my hands on you or or or see you so I'm gonna ask if everybody if you could just stand with me and just bow your heads as you stand [Music] and with every head bowed those of you that raised your hand said you said yes Lord I would love for you to be born in my heart would you just come up to the front Thank You amen god bless you young man god bless you god bless you what a man god bless you god bless you god bless you praise God if we have any ministers here that wouldn't mind coming and fulfilling the scripture as

everybody in the audience for those of you that didn't have the strength to walk up here we're gonna be praying for you too and if any moment you want to make your way up here you can do that I'm gonna ask everybody who believes that they're born again and filled with the Spirit of God if you just lift your hand towards the towards the platform over here and towards our our young are young believers over here we're gonna go ahead and pray a simple prayer of faith you know when the angel Gabriel spoke to Mary and he said you're gonna give birth to Jesus there wasn't any sensation she didn't speak she didn't throw a backflip she didn't start crying and screaming on an active Testament Lord they they're making a confession with their with their movements Lord they walked up here to make a public confession that they want you to be born in their heart Lord Jesus Lord it's the simplicity and the foolishness of the gospel that changes lives Lord God and out of the mouths of babes Lord you will come down to confound the wise and the prudent Lord because you come in the simplest of ways Lord Jesus and as we lay our hands to fulfill the scripture we asked that you just make yourself known as you are born inside first in the womb of there mind may they accept you in their mind and say Lord Jesus I accept you to be born in my heart and to be king of my heart and Lord of my life as we do that Lord we trust that you'll honor your word and you'll honor this faith and this act of confession and may they never be the same Lord God when they never be the same because when Jesus comes oh when Jesus comes all things are made new we thank you for this and may they be a light wherever they go may people say well there's something different about you what happened what's different may they say well I accepted Jesus in my heart it was quite simple would you like to accept Jesus in your heart and may we go and cause a revolution Lord even if it's a small one in our workplace or in our home Lord or on the bus Lord the whole point is to change one life for the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why we're here Lord God to preach this glorious gospel that there's still hope in the world there's still life and there still love we love you Jesus and we thank you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [Music] amen amen and everybody said amen
