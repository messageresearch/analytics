of the babylonians can you say babylonians try to say babylonians 10 times without smiling pablo as lovely as babylonians but it was nothing to smile about because he was the most evil king that you can think of the things that they did in their religion were horrible and they did it to defy the living god and king nebuchadnezzar one day walked out onto the platform so professor theo didn't have to stall any longer and he walked out that wasn't what that's not the king right there can you grab a microphone thank you sir what kind of reception come on let me hear you you gotta do better than

worship that stuff thank you for saying no you're the only person that said no ramba let me ask that again how many people want to worship that stuff ah we have another we have an oven for you no no you must give a decree everybody as i told you please all right here's a decree whenever you start to hear the trumpets and the clarinet and the sultry and the other music instruments whenever you hear that you gotta bow down like this and if you don't bow down that cool fiery furnace that you saw you're gonna get thrown into that right yeah that's the decree all right maestro [Music] [Applause] so in that day when the music started and the harp started playing and the trumpet blew and the drums went boom boom boom everybody couldn't help it they couldn't help it so they bent down like sometimes we'll wear fries and we hear that song and we're like oh i just came for some eggs i just came for some milk foot stop tapping we can't help it sometimes but you have to take control of this bad boy we have to take control of this flesh whenever we hear the music we can't bow down so we have to remember so who be the glory to who be the praise but there was three in the kingdom that refused to bow down they didn't even nod their head they didn't even say yo that's a cool beat they didn't say nothing they kept their heads straight and they said i'm gonna honor god and that was three young hebrew children by the name of shadrach meshach and abednego can you say shadrach [Music] hey you you freaking face your freckleface cartoon get over here hey king nebuchadnezzar yes so these three musketeers whenever the music sounded they didn't bow down the knee what do you say king live forever bring them before me come here wise guys no that's don't think okay i won't touch no

a car cuts you off in the middle of traffic do you know when your sister steals your toy do you know that you can behave like a christian and stand up because jesus will be with you in the fire well they knew that they knew it and while the fire went crazy again they stood on the fire and the king noticed something different slave how many did we put into the fire it was three sir i see four [Music] because jesus stood with them in the fire and walked with them in the fire across the front of the stage so that everybody can see that jesus was in the fire with the three hebrew children
