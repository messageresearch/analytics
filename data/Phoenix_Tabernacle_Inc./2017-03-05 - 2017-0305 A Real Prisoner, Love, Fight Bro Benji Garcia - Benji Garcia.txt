I don't want to take too much of my time but uh so many people send greetings um if you didn't know we had just made a we come back from a trip a missionary trip and uh it wasn't just two weeks it was about 17 days as my wife pointed out 17 days but we we went to Lima Peru and then um thereafter we went to hulak um Peru and the brothers there all send their greetings brotheri karosi and um brother Enrique China China um they love you very much the people love you very much and they uh they send the greetings and U and maybe soon they'll they'll be able to be here to tell you in person um it's it's it's it's good to be back at home it's good to be out there also it's an experience that's for sure you you you learn and you see things and and you come back either a better or a worse person and I and I pray to God that I've come back better I do know that I come back a little bit more tired because they they squeeze everything out of you and I want to thank you all for your prayers because uh as soon as I got back I just slept and I don't know how I made it up to that point so thank you for your prayers for your love we we really appreciate that um CU up to the point that I got home and I don't know how I made [Music] it I wasn't gone um as long as some of the brothers here have been like my Uncle Bernie my brother Ernie I've been you know long periods of times but when someone goes out like that I just I me personally I'm going to pray for them you know brother um because they certainly need prayers their family needs prayers they could use all the the attention and love you know so uh just pray for them um I want to if you could just stand just real real quick I'd like to read a a a scripture or verse in the Bible on filon and then we'll pray and then you can sit back down in the book of filon 1 verse 9 I'll read it like this yet for Love's sake I rather thee beeech the being such and one as Paul the Aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ let's Bor our heads we thank you for this evening Lord Jesus Lord being here in this position where I am behind the pulpit tonight Lord I pray that take me out of the way Lord and that you would anoint my lips Lord that you would uh bring forth your word Lord father and that you would touch our our hearts Lord Jesus use us Lord father from up here to the audience your lord Jesus interpreter Lord or that we may be able to receive of your word Lord Lord this is one of my my my sayings that I say that I I can personally read Bible from from left to right Lord from front to back lord Jesus but if it's not anointed by that Holy Spirit Lord it won't mean anything Lord Jesus the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life Lord so we ask for this Lord Jesus and Lord and and in this Lord father there's anyone here Lord Jesus that might need a touch from you this evening Lord Jesus that would you just touch their hearts in such a sweet and gentle way Lord father if there's anyone here Lord father that needs a quickening in their life Lord Jesus may you Quicken the things in their life Lord father in this very moment this evening Lord Jesus someone needs re-energizing in their life Lord father you father the author of Life Lord Jesus may you write on the tablets of their heart A New Beginning Lord Jesus you are control of all things Lord Jesus you the balance of all life Lord father so we if we are going through up or Downs or whatnot whatever it might be in our lives at this moment Lord Jesus we ask for a balancing in our lives also Lord Jesus double portion of that Holy Spirit Lord bless us tonight Lord father we love you and we we worship you Lord father in truth and spirit Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may sit down I want to need read another scri two scriptures 1 John chapter 4 uh 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment and he that fearth is not made perfect in love and in the Book of Joshua chapter 1 verse 13 remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you saying the Lord your God had given you rest and had given you this land um if I could give a maybe a small title to this message it would be a a real prisoner a real love a real fight you know um this morning I was privileged to be up with the youth in the South Mountain and as we were up in the in the mountain there in the big Rada it was such a beautiful site as you're up in the mountains well first of all I remember our prophet and and various messages when he came and he spoke in Phoenix he would go up there maybe by himself or with sister maida he would look over the valley you know in those times it was of course the different less buildings less houses less pollution less sin less problems but I remember how he used to talk about those times and I was as I was up there this morning I I see I it was just beautiful to me you know when you're up in a mountain uh you're at a different elevation you know and when you're up in a different elevation you're so far away you see things in a different uh sight in a different way you know it it gives you uh um a feeling of wanting to take a picture or something of how beautiful it looks maybe you want to take a selfie but it's beautiful up there and then as you drive down and then you start going towards the neighborhoods and and the and the streets it it looks a little bit different you know it it doesn't look quite as appealing you know you get closer to the to the pollution the noise pollution you you see things that you didn't see from up on top you you you you see the the the Circle Caves and the people walking and whatnot and then you realize that that you know there's a lot of people who are prisoners and in life prisoners to sin prisoners to unbelief you see uh people who who who believe they have a love with in them it's a manufactured love but in reality it's it's not a true love you see people that are fighting they're fighting for something you know I learned because of this message that that you're fighting for one way or or the other you know we all have a cause in life you fight for this or you fight for that you you fight for good or evil like an old country western movie you either for the Cowboys of the Indians not that any one of them is good or bad but you're always fighting for something and if you're not fighting for something then then what are you doing are you truly even living you know so then um as I as I go to this uh this word this message I realize that that we're we're we're we're prisoners also we're prisoners either to one thing or the other to good or bad we're prisoners to to believing or or prisoners to unbelieving we're prisoners to the world or prisoners to Christ and and it's and it's our choice Moral Moral agency that we have that God given us that we're either a prisoner to to the world or prisoner to Christ you know and and uh and know it says that if you have the love of the world in you then you have not the love of God in you so you either love the world or you love God you know which one is it you know there's there's a it's a it's a balancing them so you got to real which side are you going to pick are you going to choose a straight and narrow way take God's way you know to where your burdens are are are are taken off of you you know when you're a prisoner of the world you know a prisoner of sin and and and I can just tell you this night I'm preaching to myself okay if anything I'm going to receive something tonight because this is something that I've lived okay so nobody get offended here tonight this something that I've lived through okay so being a prisoner of the world you know you you believe you you uh maybe you have a cause for something you believe you have a right to things you know we you know as you see on TV and the news and whatnot social media and you believe that you got a right to this and a right to that you know people nowadays they got the rights you know their animals have their rights man cats and dogs got more rights than us if you're a dolphin forget about it you can't even be touched but as a human being you know we feel that we have rights you know and and and that you deserve this or you deserve that you know and and and if you're not a prisoner to Christ if you're not a prisoner of love then then what are you a prisoner of well so as I was walked through this this Valley of the shadow of deathful valley of Phoenix Arizona pH I walked as prisoner you know there were some times where I spent uh time in in in in the jail system here I wish brother Alex could have preached to me one of those times know he used to be a minister for the gel systems you know but wherever you're at God can speak to you God can set you free he can take you out of those prisons but you know uh being as a prisoner of sin I I I didn't I I didn't know that that I was really a prisoner I thought I had my freedom I thought I had my rights you know I just I just wanted to be free in life but not realizing that that I was captive I was captive to my thoughts captive to My Flesh and I was a prisoner down to the bone I was a slave my slave master this flesh this sin this world it had me bound down so bad that I didn't even realize that I was a prisoner of it you know uh when when you love when you love I love the way brother Brandon says it you know when you love it goes together with faith you know it's like like sisters or or it's just they go one with another love and faith if you truly have love if you have love for your brother sister your husband wife it there's a faith about it when you have love for God there there's something about it there's no doubt about it you you love him and you know that he loves you you there's it's a guaranteed thing that because he paid the price you've seen where he's brought you out of you understand that it's by grace and that that you didn't earn nothing unmerited that he just loved you because of he wanted to regardless of what situation you're in regardless of how filthy we are how violent you can be what condition you can be in regardless of how much Darkness you could be in that loving God can come down and just say I love you it's a hard thing to believe believe me it's a hard thing to believe that this that God can love something so filthy but it's the truth and he's a gentleman patient just waiting to love you and when you when you can accept that then he can truly love him can truly have faith in him you know to me the opposite of Love is hate you know you you we might think that you know living in life that we have love for our brothers we have love for our sisters our husband for God how many times did I come to the altar oh Lord I love you Lord I worship you Lord I love you with all my heart you know me Lord I love you then I go back into the outside and boom I I make the same mistake over again and over and over and I come back to the altar Lord I love you I love you and and he he looks down and he says but but if you love me you wouldn't be doing that people wouldn't be in this situation all over I'm beginning to think you're a liar son it's the truth God is God is good all the time but he's a jealous God and he wants all of you he don't just want 99% of you the whole thing front and back he wants all of you all of us to be able to just dive into him into love to to to take out the fear take out the hate take it all out of our lives so we can truly live truly love so that we can be a prisoner to him prisoner to Christ a prisoner to his word prisoner to love be yolked with such love in regardless of what comes our way regardless of what the holy spirit says that you just say yes Lord yes Lord and you walk and you talk as as you as if you really did love him regardless of the situation how tired you are what your condition is out of love realizing from what he did for you you want to just love him to serve him you just want to worship Him in truth and in spirit not just in truth or not just in spirit but with the word completely in truth and in spirit a double compound thing amen you know we fight man we fight through hell we fight you know U there was this's his brother his name is Edgardo Riva and we happen to sing a song there in Peru and this I believe the song was called and uh faith is not a gift it's a victory and that stuck to me Faith is it's not a gift it's a victory you got to fight for it got to fight for your character it's a fight it's a battle it's not something that's given to you and then I thought about well then Grace the gift of the Holy Ghost the new birth it's unmerited it's not something you fight for something that's given so here we go in life we're fighting for something we as potential Christians the sons of God Daughters of God we're fighting for something we're fighting for our inh fighting for a land a Promised Land we fighting to get that fighting every day you know uh uh brother Junior brother eler I'm sorry MC Jun he's been preaching these messages on on on mind Warfare right beauti mes and and it's the greatest battle we fought it is a great battle it's for me that great battle doesn't really start doesn't really start until you have received the promise within your heart see before you receive it you believe you're fighting you're fighting for something fighting to receive the holy spirit with the capital S fighting to receive a new birth capital B you're fighting for it every day you're saying Lord you tell your friends oh this is a battle the greatest battle or fight in reality it hasn't even begun it's it's a gift that Holy Spirit the new birth it's not something that you fight for even though you got to fight yourself for it you don't have to fight for it it's unmerited it's Grace nothing you can do can earn it nothing you can do can achieve it it's by Grace he gives it to you because it pleases him Grace you don't have to earn it have to fight for it it's given to you then when it's given to you then when it's unmerited and it's given to you this new nature New Life this new birth this new way of living you no long you no longer have to fight anymore but it's the Holy Spirit within you that's fighting for you you know brother Brandon preached in Africa one time and when he was in Africa and he was preaching out to the ladies out there the sisters calling my sisters receive the Holy Spirit I want to say I was there and as he was preaching to these sisters and they were they were they didn't have clothes on and so as he was preaching to them and the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire came down upon their hearts it automatically they covered themselves they didn't have to fight for that they didn't have to read no scripture about it no one had to tell them but the Holy Spirit within them told them cover yourself when you truly have the Holy Spirit in your heart in your life automatically it starts to cleanse you you know Darkness cannot abide where light is where death is life cannot exist together it's impossible God said let there be light and there was light and the Darkness just ran away Darkness just runs like a little it just runs away it can't just exist when life is there when life is there it's not possible for for death to be there little by little if if you apply the word on a daily basis Grace it just starts to leave it starts to separate like when God told Abraham separate yourself when he finally when he finally listened to the word finally HIIT him that he needed to separate himself then he received the promise then he had the name changed he had no more fear he know then he walk before the Lord so then we fight through hell every day not everybody but some of us I know I did I was fighting to achieve something fighting to receive something and what was I fighting for free unmerited you don't have to fight for it but then when you receive it then the fight starts this is the true fight you want to say with the capital F this is the greatest this is now this is a fight this is a real fight anything before that it's just a blood you thought you were fighting for something but but what were you fighting for fighting for something that's free our character can be formed you can't start to you work on that character until you truly have that in you that promise so to me this is what a true prisoner is to be a prisoner of Christ prisoner of love to be Yol to him a prisoner to his word to love him to love each other to love each other in such a way that it can only be Christ within us loving each other different kind of love you know you know when when you have this type of Love within you you know God automatically I believe he gets you a set of binoculars you when you when you join this battle when he initiates you he gives you your ranks when he gives you your position in gives you your your necessary artillery he gives you your gun your sword he gives you a pair of binoculars and with this pair of binoculars you're able to see long distance you take off those binoculars and and and you might see someone who's struggling you might see a prostitute on the street you know a brother who has fallen you might look at them maybe with disgust but but when you see through binoculars of these Faith you see something different you're not seeing what's happening right now but God gives you different type of a vision a vision of an eil able to see long distance he puts you up on a mountain where you see nothing but Beauty and you and you see the good in people maybe the potential what someone can be you know when Jesus came and walked on this Earth he didn't come to save the phes and that sades although some got saved he came to the world but who are his rightand men who were the ones that that were part of that Circle they were the thieves the Liars the prostitutes the thief on the on the cross next to him you know he came for those people but he had long range vision to see something that we as human beings cannot see he had Faith within him true perfect Faith perfect love and he can see beyond and and and talk to them with love that's love perfect love you know when you don't have love whether in a relationship or in families or with friends or with God you have fear you have doubt and there's no faith there I can testify to you that about that it's a horrible condition you know that you you can't even have love and and and and your your loved ones you can't you all you see is mistakes and maybe they don't even make mistakes but with such an imagination with such a warped mind with such filthy reasoning or maybe with such bad memories or with the Consciousness or or maybe some affections of what happened to you as you were a kid we judge and we judge those people next to us around us and there's no true love because you you have a fear you have doubt about them and it and it just goes bad and bad and bad and I'm almost about to finish the song leader can come up but it it's not a good situation you're fighting through hell you're you're fighting your every inch of the way to Hell through hell it's a horrible condition but when God gives you this Promise by Grace being that it's unmar you you no longer fight sometimes you don't know how you get through it it but it's it's not you that's fighting but it's God himself his holy spirit that's fighting for you now you're fighting with a different attitude now you're fighting in Heavenly places now you're fighting with love now you're fighting with the word you know when when when Jesus went out to the Wilderness and he was tempted he didn't he didn't try to debate Satan he didn't try to challenge him just gave him the word you didn't have to do anything else but he just fought him with the word let's just stand up to our feet every day of my life I believe every day of Our Lives you know we we should try to fight for the real cause to be a real prisoner to love genuinely to fight for the right cause you know character I know that character is is it's not a gift it's it's it's a it's a victory it's a and it's a it's a promise you know I don't even know how I'm here pitching up this evening today as I as I was up in the mountain today and remember the type of life that God brought me out of Lord you're wonderful Lord you're wonderful how do you do this how do you do those kind of things Lord how can you save a a sinner like that Lord he's a wonderful God he's a loving God I ask tonight is there's one person here tonight and and maybe is not fully a prisoner to [Music] Christ you know and this is for myself too because every day I want to be more imprisoned to him more yoke to him I want to have more love for him I want to have more love for you I want to have more love for myself you know it's hard sometimes when you try to when you think when all these things come to your mind the memories and all these things to forgive yourself you I want to have more love for myself because he first loved me yeah I want to fight for the right thing I don't want to fight through hell no more I want to fight my way to heaven sitting in Heavenly places I want to fight with the smile on my face regardless of the situation in my life I want to be a better daddy a better husband a better friend a better brother I want to fight for these good things I believe we all here want those things in our lives too Would You Close Your Eyes Lord Heavenly Father Lord we love you Lord Jesus Lord we need you Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you would help us tonight Lord Jesus and in our daily lives Lord Jesus that you would yoke us to you to your word Lord Jesus to your love Lord that we can be more prisoners to you Lord Jesus fill us with the baptism of Your Love Tonight Lord Jesus Lord change our hearts tonight Lord Jesus our hearts are open Lord Jesus Lord we pray that you baptize us with this love Lord Jesus genuine love Lord Lord Jesus help us to fight for the real cause Lord rather for the wrong one Lord Jesus Lord may you we may we through your grace Lord Jes Jus fight for this character Lord Jesus for this character that that you desire of us Lord Jesus we're trying to be like you Lord Jesus it's a tough thing Lord but if it's you that's fighting for us Lord Jesus if you be
