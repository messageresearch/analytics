[2:19] it it's um time to start the service and
[2:22] if you would be so kind as to Bow your
[2:25] heads so we can
[2:26] pray and ask the Lord to be with us
[2:28] tonight
[2:32] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[2:34] every person that's here tonight seeking
[2:37] from you
[2:39] Lord my mind right now just goes
[2:43] to Psalms 42 I believe it is where it
[2:46] talks about deep calling to the
[2:48] Deep Prophet already told us that we
[2:52] wouldn't want
[2:54] something spiritually speaking things
[2:57] that have to do with you
[2:58] Lord we wouldn't want that if it wasn't
[3:01] already
[3:03] ours the scripture says that you put
[3:05] both the will to do and the uh Power and
[3:09] the strength to do something it's you
[3:12] working on both ends
[3:16] Lord remember when he speaks about the
[3:19] little boy and the that would eat pedals
[3:22] off a bicycle
[3:24] and the little Erasers on a pencil just
[3:27] because it had rubber in there and the
[3:28] rubber had so for Lord and the and his
[3:30] body he was he wasn't a genius the
[3:33] little boy was not a chemist he didn't
[3:35] know what was in the chemistry of the
[3:37] rubber but he knew that if he ate those
[3:38] things that that that his body was
[3:40] craving for that Lord and we can explain
[3:43] it maybe theologically what what we want
[3:46] but we know we want more of you
[3:48] Lord and we thank you Lord that for that
[3:52] desire that thirst Lord that you have
[3:54] put in there as you said on the great
[3:56] day of the feast you said you stood up
[3:59] and shouted Lord normally your
[4:01] softspoken man stood up and shouted if
[4:04] if any man thirst let him come to me and
[4:07] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[4:09] Living Water and he said scripture you
[4:12] tell us Lord that was that was you were
[4:14] referring to the Holy Ghost which is
[4:16] going to be given
[4:18] out we thank you Lord for the desire
[4:21] that you have put in us to want more of
[4:24] you
[4:25] lord I can't say that enough thank you
[4:28] Lord thank you very much we pray to you
[4:32] that you help everybody everybody Lord
[4:35] has come tonight we know they will leave
[4:38] you're the same person Lord I trust that
[4:40] everybody will receive what they came
[4:42] expecting and we don't even have to pray
[4:44] for that because we already know that's
[4:45] what you said through your Prophet that
[4:47] you get what you we expect but we want
[4:49] to leave here a better person Lord and
[4:52] may we listen to your word tonight
[4:54] Lord and as the scripture says that your
[4:58] word went forth and and healed the them

[29:37] to have I'm a perfectionist believe it
[29:39] or

[29:45] and the glory of
[29:47] God as we said when we started when I
[29:50] came in it's not for everybody tonight
[29:52] is not for everybody it's only for you
[29:54] guys okay did you understand Billy Paul
[29:57] had come here made a test test gave a
[29:59] testimony I wasn't here it wasn't for me
[30:03] the other night we watched it on the
[30:04] YouTube brother ston put it on there on
[30:07] his phone and I was
[30:09] just I was glued to his testimony Emilio
[30:13] comes
[30:15] over my wife didn't came over I'm not
[30:19] going to tell you where they were at you
[30:20] know and everybody was just just Frozen
[30:23] to what brother Billy Paul was
[30:26] doing we believe the message of the hour
[30:29] we believe that brother
[30:30] random was a man sent from
[30:34] God we believe that brother Bernie was
[30:37] also a man sent from God he's our pastor
[30:41] and I'm thankful for that I can never
[30:43] call Brother Bernie Garcia I have maybe
[30:46] in yesterday year to call him my uncle I
[30:50] cannot call him my uncle although he is
[30:52] my uncle I always call him brother
[30:56] berning
[30:57] okay let you read between the lines
[31:01] okay brother Holly this Bible is for you
[31:06] brother Ernie it's for you it's also for
[31:08] me this Bible is for each and every one
[31:11] of us amen you know if we're here this
[31:17] this
[31:18] evening to magnify God to worship
[31:22] God we believe that this Bible tells you
[31:26] what to do how to get along in life we
[31:29] already we know that we know that we
[31:31] should follow the word of God it tells
[31:34] us how get guess what young people it
[31:37] tells us how to look for a
[31:40] boyfriend and who to marry what
[31:42] qualities you must have same
[31:45] girls girls when you're at that age that
[31:48] you're looking that you want to marry
[31:50] someone because in the beginning God
[31:52] when he created man he created him male
[31:56] and female created he them
[31:58] both there's one prayer for each okay
[32:02] okay okay that's Genesis 127 you can
[32:05] read it there at home if you'd like to
[32:07] but what I'm trying to say this Bible is
[32:09] a written word of
[32:11] God not this particular Bible now don't
[32:13] go try to steal my Bible okay not this
[32:15] particular Bible but your Bible is a
[32:18] written word of God it's God's thoughts
[32:22] expressed put on print form and he sent
[32:27] a prophet in our age to tell us how to
[32:30] get in line how to come back to him how
[32:33] to because we are a church we are called
[32:39] out how many you been called
[32:42] out I'm not talking about fighting you
[32:44] know when they call you out let's get on
[32:46] we're going to fight I don't like your
[32:47] looks I just don't like you no I'm not
[32:49] talking about that this Bible is also a
[32:53] special book it's a book of History yes
[32:56] if you you know that the the judges have
[32:59] the Ten Commandments What one time they
[33:01] used to do it okay they used to have I
[33:03] I'm I'm getting too loose now okay I
[33:05] better shut up right
[33:06] there no I'll give it to you okay yeah
[33:10] come on when I work with the amopa
[33:12] county sher's
[33:14] department I remember taking people down
[33:16] to the uh where they needed to go in
[33:19] upside of seven right anyway they would
[33:22] I would take him to the the polygraph of

[44:21] best she goes to church on time she
[44:24] gives her ties to the church she places
[44:28] her her allegiance to Jesus Christ and
[44:31] she's has her allegiance to the church

[44:41] it's okay you know
[44:44] but she is not mediocre she is not
[44:49] ordinary she's not just ordinary
[44:52] moderate
[44:54] quality you know the the I went to the
[44:56] dictionary and it says to be mediocre is
[44:59] to be neither bad nor
[45:01] good a person that never takes a
[45:04] stand wow you know that's okay okay here
[45:08] it goes so I'm in the police
[45:12] academy there's 20 there I think the
[45:15] class
[45:16] 126 if you check it out on the internet
[45:18] okay fine maybe you'll see me over there
[45:19] but anyway we're class 126 and we're
[45:22] there we're playing ball and we we
[45:24] started rotating
[45:26] and then the the they didn't want to
[45:29] rotate they didn't want to they they
[45:31] didn't want to play with the by the
[45:32] rules okay so we're there and and uh
[45:35] brother Alex ends up serving and he
[45:38] served real good boom boom they brother
[45:40] Alex just stay there stay there Alex we
[45:42] we just stay there we we the big guys
[45:44] six foot guys we'll stay up here I said

[46:32] woman this
[46:34] lady she worships the Lord like you sang
[46:37] today I like that that was good maybe
[46:40] it's because the oldtime songs brings
[46:42] back memories you know it was very good
[46:45] but to be mediocre means what it really
[46:48] means is you're rather poor you're
[46:51] inferior and your common place that's a
[46:54] dictionary I'm going to put this away

[47:45] on the cross came back resurrected and
[47:47] he sent back the Holy Spirit yes he sent
[47:51] back the Holy Spirit and when he sent
[47:54] back the Holy Spirit he he's poured

[1:23:12] brother B said he it was he was like
[1:23:14] stying in his mind he says I cannot
[1:23:19] understand how it is that the Creator
[1:23:25] can be disbelieved by the
[1:23:30] creation and I'll kind of paraphrase it
[1:23:32] like this why do we believe the
[1:23:36] liar and disbelieve the truth and he
[1:23:39] said I am the way the truth and the life
