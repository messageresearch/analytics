[11:10] promise that you sent down the power
[11:13] Heavenly Father
[11:20] [Music]
[11:47] [Music]
[11:58] amen let us our
[12:01] Bibles in the book of Acts chapter
[12:05] one we reading from verse 4 to verse
[12:14] 8 so the scripture
[12:17] says and being assembled together with
[12:20] them commanded them that they should not
[12:22] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[12:25] promise of the Father which says he you
[12:28] have of
[12:49] me for John truly baptized with water
[12:52] but you shall be baptized with the Holy
[12:54] Ghost not many days
[13:08] when they therefore come together they
[13:11] ask of him saying Lord will th at this
[13:14] time restore again the kingdom to
[13:27] Israel and said unto them it is not for
[13:31] you to know the times or the seasons
[13:34] which the father has put in his own
[13:47] power but
[14:26] some talk on the subject
[14:30] you shall receive
[14:33] power praise the name of the Lord you
[14:36] shall receive
[14:38] power so here the scripture
[14:41] says in Acts 1 and verse
[14:46] 8 you shall receive
[14:49] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[14:55] you you shall be Witnesses
[14:59] to me both in Jerusalem and all
[15:04] Jud and in
[15:06] Sam andto the uttermost part of the
[15:10] earth praise the name of the Lord so we
[15:13] want talk about you shall receive
[15:19] power and now this
[15:21] power comes as a result of receiving the
[15:25] Holy Spirit
[15:29] praise the name of our Lord he says we
[15:31] shall receive
[15:33] power after the holy spirit is come upon
[15:39] us now the holy spirit is the power of
[15:44] God so now when you receive the baptism
[15:47] of the Holy
[15:50] Spirit then you have received the power
[15:52] of
[15:54] God praise the name of the Lord you have
[15:57] received the power of God
[16:00] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[16:03] Spirit and that one should be the desire
[16:06] of every
[16:08] person as long as you have accepted the
[16:11] Lord Jesus Christ as your personal
[16:16] savior you want to live a different
[16:20] life you want to be different from your
[16:23] past
[16:25] life and the only thing that can make
[16:28] you different
[16:31] from the past
[16:32] life is because you have received the
[16:35] spirit of
[16:38] God because you know when we are here on
[16:42] Earth you know the scripture
[16:44] says in First
[16:55] Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[16:59] and then verse
[17:01] 11 for what man knoweth the things of a
[17:04] man save the spirit of man which is in
[17:07] him even so the things of God knows no
[17:10] man but the spirit of
[17:23] God but we have
[17:26] received now have we received not the
[17:29] Spirit of the world but the spirit which
[17:31] is of god that we might know the things
[17:34] that are freely given to us
[17:47] of so now the Bible is telling us that
[17:51] we have received the spirit of
[17:55] God now when you look at this scripture
[17:57] in verse 12
[18:02] it talks about three different kinds of
[18:07] spirits three different kinds of
[18:12] spirits it talks about the spirit of the
[18:17] world which is the
[18:19] devil and all the evil
[18:22] spirits then it talks about the spirit
[18:26] of God
[18:29] praise the name of our Lord and now when
[18:31] you continue reading
[18:35] further you know he says in verse
[18:39] 11 about the spirit of a
[18:44] man now the spirit of a
[18:47] man is the spirit whereby we are born
[18:51] [Music]
[18:53] with praise the name of Lord our birth
[18:58] you know we get the human
[19:01] Spirit which is the spirit of a
[19:05] man and now that Spirit of a
[19:08] man helps you motivates this
[19:13] body you know makes this body
[19:17] alive that's why when somebody
[19:20] dies the human Spirit lives
[19:24] him and then he just it's a body that we
[19:27] are remaining with
[19:31] but when one is
[19:33] born Naturally
[19:36] Speaking the child receives the human
[19:40] spirit and now it's that human spirit
[19:42] that makes this Child
[19:46] Alive human Spirit the child
[19:50] receives helps that child to cont to
[19:53] connect with nature
[19:57] here you know like now growing up like a
[20:00] human
[20:01] being eating like a human
[20:04] being walking like a human
[20:06] being behav like a human
[20:10] being but yet there is also another
[20:12] spirit in this
[20:15] world and that is Satan and his
[20:19] demons and now is the evil
[20:22] spirits the evil spirit can easily
[20:26] influence the human spirit
[20:31] the moment the person is
[20:33] born the evil spirits are always there
[20:36] to influence that
[20:41] person you see that's why the Bible
[20:45] says in the book of
[20:50] Jeremiah praise the name of the Lord and
[20:53] then verse
[20:55] 23 oh Lord I know that the way of man is
[20:59] not in himself it's not in the man that
[21:03] walth to direct his steps
[21:16] I so now the Bible is telling us it's
[21:20] not in man that
[21:25] leave to direct his pathes
[21:30] so having only the human
[21:33] Spirit you cannot make your personal
[21:38] decision but then there is now the
[21:41] spirit of the
[21:42] world and the spirit of the world can
[21:45] take a hold of the human
[21:49] spirit and influence the nature of a
[21:53] person like somebody who likes lying
[21:58] a lying
[22:00] Spirit somebody who likes
[22:03] cheating you know is having a cheating
[22:07] Spirit somebody who likes
[22:11] complaining is having a complaining
[22:15] Spirit somebody who
[22:18] despises is having a despising
[22:21] spirit so now they are kind of different
[22:25] spirits in the world and so they can
[22:28] take on a
[22:30] person and then influence his nature
[22:33] towards the spirit that's controlling
[22:40] him so that's why the Bible says it's
[22:43] not in a man
[22:46] that to direct his
[22:49] pathes because our first
[22:52] birth made us to be born out of the
[22:55] kingdom of God
[22:59] now that's why we need the new
[23:02] birth to be born again of the spirit of
[23:07] God now when we are born of the spirit
[23:10] of
[23:11] God then the spirit of God takes over
[23:14] our
[23:16] control you know takes over your
[23:19] heart and now the spirit of
[23:23] God now starts leading your human spirit
[23:29] in Romans chapter
[23:32] 8 praise the name of the Lord Romans 8
[23:36] and
[23:38] verse the scripture
[23:47] says for as many as are led by the
[23:50] spirit of God they are the sons of
[23:57] God praise the name of the Lord if you
[24:00] are led by the spirit of
[24:03] God then you are the Son of
[24:07] God for you have not received the spirit
[24:10] of bondage against
[24:14] fear but you have received a spirit of
[24:21] adoption whereby we cry ABA
[24:25] father the spirit itself bears witness
[24:29] with our
[24:45] spirit so he says the Holy
[24:49] Spirit the spirit of God Bears
[24:54] witness with our human spirit
[24:58] that we are the children of
[25:01] God so now there has to be a connection
[25:04] between your human
[25:12] spirit with the spirit of
[25:15] God until your human
[25:18] Spirit can give a
[25:21] testimony that I am not my
[25:24] own but it's the spirit of God
[25:28] that has taken over
[25:30] me that I follow
[25:33] that praise the name of the Lord when
[25:36] the Holy
[25:37] Spirit gets into our
[25:40] lives he controls our human
[25:45] Spirit he controls our personal
[25:50] desires so that now you will always
[25:53] desire through the Holy
[25:56] Spirit praise name of now when the Holy
[26:00] Spirit has taken
[26:02] over the holy spirit gives us the
[26:07] ability praise the name of our Lord the
[26:10] only spirit is in our
[26:13] lives he gives us the
[26:16] ability to do the word of
[26:19] God now the
[26:21] ability to do the word of
[26:24] God that's the power that we have
[26:27] received
[26:29] praise the name of the Lord now you know
[26:31] many people talk about
[26:33] power and now when they thinking about
[26:37] power they are thinking about
[26:42] shaking and to
[26:49] them
[26:51] for means waving the hand
[26:59] and then the people fall
[27:00] down and they show that on
[27:03] televisions somebody comes to be prayed
[27:06] for and then they are shaking and there
[27:09] somebody behind here to kind of carry
[27:11] them when they falling
[27:14] down and they said that man has
[27:17] power I felt the
[27:21] power you know they have that kind of
[27:25] mindset that the power is when you fall
[27:30] down the power is when you
[27:34] shake the power is when you do
[27:43] this a great man of God and when that
[27:46] man of God comes with his
[27:49] power he goes back with his
[27:51] power and then for them they left with
[27:55] nothing but the power the Bible ising
[27:59] about let us go to the book of First
[28:08] Peter first P
[28:11] 1 and then verse
[28:16] 5 the Bible
[28:18] says who are kept by the power of God
[28:22] through faith and salvation ready to be
[28:24] revealed in the last time
[28:38] praise the name of the Lord so the Bible
[28:40] says the power of
[28:43] God Keeps
[28:45] Us Praise the name of the Lord the power
[28:49] of
[28:50] God gives us the
[28:53] ability to perform the word of God
[28:59] the power of God gives us the
[29:03] ability to overcome
[29:06] Temptations the power of God gives us
[29:09] the
[29:10] ability to fulfill the word of God in
[29:13] our
[29:15] lives that's the power he says you shall
[29:19] receive power when the Holy Ghost is
[29:21] come upon
[29:23] you praise the name of the Lord and when
[29:25] you have the spirit of God
[29:28] you have the power to perform all the
[29:32] word of
[29:33] God praise the name of the Lord when you
[29:36] have the baptism of the Holy
[29:38] Spirit you have the power of
[29:41] God to fulfill the promise of
[29:47] God according to the need that you
[29:50] have and now the power of God works in
[29:55] different
[29:56] ways the power of God is resent in
[30:01] you you can pray for the sick and they
[30:03] can be
[30:06] heal praise the name of our Lord whether
[30:08] it's a brother or it's a
[30:11] sister as long as you have the power of
[30:15] God you can pray for a
[30:18] person and they can be
[30:20] heal that's power praise the name of our
[30:24] Lord a demonstration of the power of God
[30:29] the power of God praise the name of the
[30:31] Lord you can ask what you
[30:35] will and then it will be done that's the
[30:38] power of God the power of God will make
[30:43] you live a righteous
[30:46] life because the power he has given unto
[30:49] us is to enable
[30:52] us per
[30:58] that he gives unto
[31:00] us it enables us to perform his word to
[31:06] do the way the word of God
[31:09] says praise the name of our Lord so now
[31:13] that should be our
[31:15] desire that Lord give me your
[31:19] power in
[31:21] me may your power work within my
[31:25] life may your power take over my life
[31:30] praise the name of because it's the
[31:33] power of
[31:34] God that gives us the
[31:37] strength to perform his
[31:40] word praise the name of the Lord so he
[31:43] says he has given us
[31:45] power and that power keeps
[31:49] us through faith un
[31:54] salvation so the power quickens the word
[31:57] of God
[32:00] and then that word becomes a living
[32:03] reality in
[32:06] you so when you are looking for
[32:08] power it's the power to perform his
[32:13] word praise the name of our Lord not the
[32:16] power to run
[32:18] around because somebody can run around
[32:20] without the power of
[32:23] God praise the name of the Lord you can
[32:26] have enough food eaten
[32:29] you can have do some good exercises or
[32:34] drills fres ups and things like that and
[32:38] exercise that muscle power
[32:41] around but we are talking about
[32:44] power that enables you to overcome your
[32:49] weaknesses praise the name of Lord
[32:52] that's the power he has promised unto
[32:55] us you know whereby you are able to
[32:57] overcome The
[33:01] Temptations praise the name of our now
[33:04] in the
[33:05] message possessing the enemy's
[33:10] gate he
[33:17] says in the Church of the Living
[33:22] God this morning lays the power to heal
[33:25] all sickness

[33:34] Gods power to overcome all
[33:42] temptation in the posession of the
[33:44] Church of the Living this
[33:54] morning the power to change sin
[34:01] and throw it
[34:03] away and receive the baptism of the Holy
[34:09] Spirit In The Church of Jesus
[34:12] Christ whatsoever you
[34:14] desire ask in my
[34:19] name and it shall be given to
[34:23] you praise the name of our Lord then he
[34:26] continues to say
[34:31] the Royal
[34:33] SE the that I do shall you do
[34:39] also
[34:42] I I will verify myself that I am with
[34:47] you for signs shall follow
[34:52] you he shall possess the seed of his
[34:56] enemy
[35:02] his SE shall possess the Gate of his
[35:06] Enemy No matter what the gate
[35:10] is if it is
[35:12] sickness
[35:14] Temptations sin whatever get it
[35:19] is it is
[35:22] conquered praise the name of the Lord so
[35:24] he says we have that
[35:26] power to heal all
[35:29] sickness we have the power to overcome
[35:32] all
[35:34] Temptations the power to overcome
[35:38] sin the power to overcome our
[35:42] weaknesses that's the power he talked
[35:45] about you shall receive
[35:48] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[35:51] you now in the message the key to the
[35:54] door
[35:58] he says you shall receive power after
[36:00] the Holy Ghost has come upon
[36:03] you then you are my Witnesses in
[36:06] Jerusalem Jud and
[36:15] Samaria the uttermost parts of the
[36:19] earth you receive power after you
[36:22] receive the Holy
[36:26] Ghost but first must receive the Holy
[36:30] Ghost and that is the power of
[36:34] God to manest and
[36:40] demonstrate as you are a
[36:43] human and learn to talk and walk and do
[36:46] things as a human

[37:12] power to live as a child of

[37:19] the baptism of the Holy
[37:21] Spirit the Holy Spirit enables
[37:25] us to live the life of Jesus
[37:29] Christ because that's the very essence

[38:02] transformation that you know the spirit
[38:04] of
[38:05] God can have total preeminence in our
[38:10] lives so now when you are looking for
[38:12] the power of
[38:14] God praise the name of the Lord don't
[38:17] look at you know the exercises people
[38:22] do praise the name of our Lord you know
[38:26] people have mistaken one the power of
[38:28] God is
[38:31] exactly I just an example very simple
[38:35] here brother Bram was on the
[38:39] pit and then he was
[38:41] preaching and then the devil brings a
[38:44] mad
[38:46] man and the other man was used to
[38:48] Breaking
[38:53] meetings
[38:54] preachers so the people were on the
[38:56] platform started running
[38:59] away and then they started calling
[39:03] police then he said
[39:05] no this one is not a flesh and blood
[39:10] Affair so the man came
[39:13] forward big in
[39:15] size of course if it was brother Bram
[39:19] was a small man he wouldn't do anything
[39:21] against
[39:23] him so the man came by the power of the
[39:27] devil
[39:30] stood by the power of
[39:33] God praise the name of our Lord and then
[39:36] brother told this
[39:38] man Satan i c you to leave
[39:41] him and then the man said sp sp on
[39:46] him then said I will show I
[39:50] should as he
[39:53] stretched just to come and beat the
[39:55] prophet
[39:57] fell down before his
[40:00] feet praise the name of our Lord that's
[40:02] the
[40:03] power praise the name of Lord Brother
[40:07] Bram he was not running
[40:10] around to show that he has the
[40:14] power praise the name of our Lord and
[40:16] then brother Bram says that
[40:20] anointing is supreme power under control
[40:27] you know knowing exactly what you
[40:31] are and then he was talking about the
[40:33] Lord Jesus
[40:34] Christ and then Jesus when he went to
[40:37] the
[40:39] synagogue when you can go and look at
[40:41] Luke
[40:43] 4 praise the name of our Lord Luke
[40:49] 4 and then we read from
[40:52] verse 16
[40:57] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[40:59] been brought up and as his custom was he
[41:02] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[41:05] day and stood up to
[41:09] [Music]
[41:20] read There was delivered unto him the
[41:22] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[41:25] had opened the book he found on the
[41:27] place where it is written the spirit of
[41:30] the Lord is upon me because he has
[41:33] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[41:36] poor he has sent me to heal the
[41:38] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[41:40] the captives and recovering of the sight
[41:43] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[41:46] are br
[42:24] to preach the AC of the Lord
[42:35] and he closed the book and gave it again
[42:38] to the minister and sat down and the
[42:40] eyes of all them that were in the S were
[42:43] Fen to him and he began to say unto them
[42:46] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[42:50] your ears
[43:07] praise the name of the Lord know he went
[43:10] and then he got the
[43:12] book and he read then said the spirit of
[43:16] God is upon
[43:17] me he read that scripture in the book of
[43:21] Isaiah and then he just went back and
[43:25] sat praise the name of
[43:27] now brother says in the message why are
[43:29] people so
[43:36] about paragraph
[43:41] 252 some people gets the wrong
[43:43] impression of what anointing
[43:50] is did you ever think of
[43:53] that when was the greatest anointing
[43:56] ever give to
[44:01] anyone and what did they do when they
[44:04] had the
[44:07] anointing the greatest
[44:10] anointing that was ever given to
[44:14] anyone was Jesus
[44:17] Christ we have the spirit by
[44:22] measure he had it without measure
[44:27] and one day he entered into the temple
[44:29] and picked up the scroll and
[44:33] read and said the spirit of God is upon
[44:38] me for he has anointed me to preach the
[44:43] acceptable
[44:45] year to bind up the broken
[44:49] hearts to heal the
[44:51] sick give sight to the
[44:55] Blind and now we would
[45:00] think if such anointing was on
[45:07] him that had been prophesied 800 years
[45:14] before it would
[45:17] come and here he was with that type of
[45:25] anointing the full blessing
[45:28] and anointing of the Lord upon
[45:33] him we would do want to run all over the
[45:37] building scream and
[45:42] horror to say that I have anointing now
[45:46] run around jump up and
[45:49] down and do all those kind of things but
[45:53] he says but the Bible said
[45:57] laid down the
[45:59] scroll and sat
[46:02] down and precious words proceeded from
[46:05] his
[46:07] mouth that is what he done under the
[46:12] anointing the anointing is not
[46:19] emotion the anointing is supreme power
[46:22] in control
[46:33] knowing exactly what and
[46:38] how praise the name of the Lord you know
[46:41] brother Bram is talking about
[46:44] that and you know at that moment of
[46:48] time praise the name of our Lord he had
[46:51] been praying for a
[46:54] person praise the name of our Lord and
[46:57] then the person he had been praying
[47:00] for like you know rose up from where
[47:02] they
[47:04] were and then he was saying that's the
[47:06] power of
[47:08] God praise the name of our Lord so now
[47:12] the power of God brings transformation
[47:15] in our
[47:18] lives it makes you to overcome your
[47:23] weaknesses praise the name of our Lord
[47:26] now here when we we can we can go to MTH
[47:28] 2:
[47:34] 29 now they had come and were asking
[47:36] Jesus
[47:38] Christ in the
[47:41] resurrection whose wife is this one
[47:43] going to
[47:44] be and then Jesus answered and said unto
[47:47] them you do
[47:53] error not knowing the scriptures
[47:57] nor the power of
[48:01] God what does it mean the power of
[48:05] God goes along with the word of
[48:09] God praise the name of our Lord the
[48:12] power of God goes along with the
[48:17] scriptures so now if I want to receive
[48:20] the power of
[48:24] God let me receive the word of God
[48:28] praise the name of the Lord when you
[48:29] receive the word of
[48:31] God then you are receiving the power of
[48:36] God praise the name of the Lord now in
[48:39] Romans 1 verse
[48:42] 16 he says I am not ashamed of the
[48:45] gospel of
[48:48] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[48:54] salvation to every that
[48:58] believeth to the Jew
[49:02] first and to the Greek
[49:05] also so now the gospel praise the name
[49:09] of our Lord the Bible says the gospel is
[49:14] the power of
[49:15] God unto salvation so if some is going
[49:19] to receive
[49:21] salvation they need the
[49:23] gospel they need the word of God
[49:27] Anointed with the power of the Holy
[49:31] Spirit and then that one will change the
[49:34] mind of the
[49:36] person would change thees of a
[49:40] person somebody who was going maybe like
[49:42] at this time
[49:46] to the mind is
[49:48] changed that his mind turns away from
[49:51] those evil
[49:53] things so now that is the power of God
[49:57] praise the name of our Lord now when we
[50:00] go to the book of Acts chapter
[50:05] 26 praise the name of our
[50:08] Lord
[50:11] 26 and then we read in verse
[50:15] 16 he says but rise and stand upon your
[50:19] feet for I have appeared unto thee for
[50:21] this purpose to make thee a minister and
[50:24] a witness both of these things which you
[50:27] have seen and of those things in which I
[50:29] will appear unto you
[50:59] delivering thee from the people and from
[51:01] the Gentiles and whom now I send
[51:11] thee open their eyes and to turn them
[51:14] from Darkness to light and from the
[51:16] power of Satan unto God that they may
[51:20] receive forgiveness of sins and
[51:23] inheritance among them which are
[51:25] Sanctified by faith that is in
[51:28] [Music]
[51:52] me praise the name of the Lord so Christ
[51:55] was telling
[51:58] I'm sending you to deliver the
[52:01] Gentiles that you may open their
[52:04] eyes and you may turn them from
[52:09] Darkness
[52:10] light and from the power of
[52:14] Satan the power of
[52:17] God praise the name of the Lord when
[52:20] somebody is doing evil
[52:22] things he's doing those evil things by
[52:25] the power of Satan
[52:28] now when somebody is fulfilling the word
[52:31] of
[52:33] God fulfilling the word of God by the
[52:35] power of
[52:38] God praise the name of the Lord so now
[52:41] when somebody is doing
[52:43] evil it's the power of Satan but when
[52:46] somebody is doing the will of
[52:49] God is doing it by the power of
[52:54] God the ability that God gives to
[52:58] us praise the name of our Lord and to
[53:01] know the will of
[53:03] God to have the gospel of
[53:06] Christ you need to see that you hear the
[53:08] word of
[53:10] God now the more you hear the word of
[53:13] God the more the word brings
[53:17] transformation and that's how the power
[53:20] of God works within
[53:23] us praise the name of our Lord more you
[53:26] hear the word and you obey the word then
[53:31] more power comes into
[53:34] you you get more
[53:38] might you get more
[53:40] strength praise the name of our Lord you
[53:43] become
[53:45] stronger praise the name of our Lord and
[53:48] then you have you get the
[53:51] ability you know to overcome your
[53:54] weaknesses
[53:57] you get the
[53:58] ability to do the will of
[54:01] God praise the name of our Lord so he
[54:04] says I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of
[54:06] Jesus
[54:09] Christ because it is the power of God
[54:11] unto
[54:14] salvation now in First Corinthians
[54:19] verse for the preaching of the Cross is
[54:22] to them that perish foolishness but unto
[54:25] us which are sin it is the power of
[54:40] Goda the name of Lord it says the
[54:43] preaching of the
[54:46] cross the Gospel of Jesus Christ to us
[54:50] it is the power of
[54:53] God it brings transformation
[54:57] changes our
[54:59] thinking changes our
[55:03] desires changes our
[55:06] walk changes our
[55:09] speech that's the power of God that
[55:12] works within
[55:14] us praise the name of the Lord now in 1
[55:17] Corinthians 2 verse
[55:25] 5 the B
[55:28] says that your faith should not stand in
[55:30] the wisdom of men but in the power of
[55:36] [Music]
[55:39] God praise the name of our Lord now we
[55:42] can pick the verse before this
[55:44] one verse
[55:47] four verse
[55:50] four 1 Corinthians 2 ver4 it says
[56:04] I beg your pardon I think this one is
[56:06] second Corinthians I
[56:08] believe it was first
[56:15] Corinthians it's just the same going for
[56:18] chapter one it
[56:20] is it is 1 Corinthians chapter 2:4 it
[56:24] says and my speech and my preaching was
[56:27] not with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[56:31] but in the demonstration of the spirit
[56:33] and of
[56:52] power then he says that your faith
[56:55] should not not stand in the wisdom of
[56:57] men but in the power of
[57:06] God praise the name of the Lord so he
[57:09] telling them you look at what the gospel
[57:16] is and you know how the Lord works
[57:20] out is that you don't only demonstrate
[57:24] the gospel
[57:27] but you know there has to be the gospel
[57:29] or rather the preaching of the
[57:34] word because the demonstration can be
[57:36] signs and
[57:44] wonders but then the Bible says there
[57:47] shall arise false christs and
[57:51] Prophets and they also come with signs
[57:54] and wonders
[57:57] but now where the distinction
[58:01] is what is the
[58:04] voice the voice behind the
[58:09] sign what's that voice behind the
[58:14] sign praise the name of our Lord so then
[58:17] it has to be the word of
[58:20] God with the demonstration of the Holy
[58:23] Spirit
[58:26] because the signs give the
[58:33] attraction and now when you get
[58:37] attracted mes at the burning
[58:43] bush now the Bush was
[58:46] burning but then it was not
[58:49] consuming so now that was a
[58:52] sign that was a demonstration
[58:56] but then there had to be a
[59:00] voice out of that
[59:03] sign and now the voice out of the
[59:07] sign was What mattered
[59:10] most praise the name of and that's where
[59:13] the instructions came
[59:16] from and that's what showed the will of
[59:21] God and then PA says that your faith
[59:27] is not put on the wisdom of
[59:31] man but you know to what was spoken to
[59:36] you but it should be to what was spoken
[59:38] to
[59:41] you by the demonstration of the Holy
[59:44] Spirit praise the name of our Lord so
[59:47] now when we wait on the
[59:49] Lord you know God reveals himself to
[59:54] us and now the way God reveals himself
[59:57] to
[59:58] us that gives us
[1:00:01] power praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:03] overcome the deception of
[1:00:06] Satan that's why the Bible
[1:00:09] says the Gates of
[1:00:11] Hell canot
[1:00:14] Prevail upon what
[1:00:18] Revelation praise the name
[1:00:20] of so that we need to see that the power
[1:00:23] of God
[1:00:26] within our
[1:00:27] lives to bring the word of God to
[1:00:30] manifestation in our
[1:00:35] lives praise the name of Lord it is the
[1:00:38] holy spirit that speaks to us the
[1:00:41] word and when the Holy Spirit speaks to
[1:00:43] us the
[1:00:45] word then you obey that
[1:00:48] word then the spirit of
[1:00:51] God comes and quickens that word
[1:00:57] comes and makes that word of God
[1:01:01] alive and then you manifest the word in
[1:01:04] your
[1:01:05] life praise the name of our Lord that's
[1:01:08] the power of God that works within
[1:01:12] us praise the name of the Lord let us go
[1:01:15] to Ephesians 3 ver
[1:01:19] 20 praise the name of our
[1:01:23] Lord Ephesians 2
[1:01:34] now un him that is able to do
[1:01:35] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:01:39] ask or think according to the power that
[1:01:43] works within us
[1:02:04] praise the name of the Lord it says the
[1:02:06] power of God works within
[1:02:10] us to enable
[1:02:13] us to perform his
[1:02:15] word the power of God works within
[1:02:19] us to bring to
[1:02:22] pass to bring to pass
[1:02:26] what we
[1:02:28] desire what we ask
[1:02:31] for that's the power of God that works
[1:02:34] within us so every time as a true
[1:02:39] Christian it should be the power of God
[1:02:42] that works within your
[1:02:45] life the name of the Lord and that power
[1:02:48] of
[1:02:49] God works by faith in
[1:02:52] God you believe God the name of our Lord
[1:02:57] this is going to happen you believe God
[1:03:00] you're going to overcome your weaknesses
[1:03:02] you believe God you're going to overcome
[1:03:05] your
[1:03:06] Temptations you believe God you are
[1:03:09] going to defeat the
[1:03:11] Devil how that power Works within
[1:03:16] us praise the name of the Lord and
[1:03:19] that's how it works within
[1:03:21] us you know it is right inside of Us
[1:03:25] Praise the name of and then brother Bram
[1:03:28] says rure is in
[1:03:30] US Resurrection is in
[1:03:33] us so the power is already resident in
[1:03:38] Us Praise the name of our Lord it has to
[1:03:41] bring to manifestation what what you
[1:03:43] have need of at that
[1:03:47] time praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:03:50] Ephesians chapter 6 as I try to finish
[1:03:57] 10 the Bible
[1:03:59] says finally my brethren be strong in
[1:04:03] the Lord and in the power of
[1:04:12] his praise the name of our Lord it says
[1:04:15] be strong in the
[1:04:19] Lord and in the power of His
[1:04:24] might praise the name name of Lord and
[1:04:27] that can
[1:04:28] happen when you know what the word of
[1:04:31] God
[1:04:33] says concerning the that you are living
[1:04:37] in because the Bible says the Holy
[1:04:42] Spirit has revealed to
[1:04:45] us the things that God has freely given
[1:04:49] to
[1:04:50] us so now if the Holy Ghost has revealed
[1:04:53] us that this is yours
[1:04:57] then there is the
[1:05:01] works and so you have to be strong in
[1:05:04] the
[1:05:06] Lord by believing
[1:05:08] God based on the stuation that you are
[1:05:11] going through in
[1:05:13] life praise the name of our Lord in the
[1:05:16] message questions and
[1:05:20] answers he says
[1:05:26] that is the
[1:05:28] promise the promised land is to live in
[1:05:31] the land of the holy
[1:05:35] spirit that is God promise for the
[1:05:41] church is to live in the power of the
[1:05:46] spirit you know like to live your
[1:05:50] life in the power of the
[1:05:53] spirit in the ability that the holy
[1:05:57] spirit gives to
[1:05:59] us and that's the life that we need to
[1:06:02] lead every
[1:06:04] day praise the name of our he has given
[1:06:07] unto us
[1:06:08] power power to overcome our
[1:06:11] weaknesses power to live a right
[1:06:15] life power to do his
[1:06:18] will power to obey his
[1:06:21] word God has given us all that power
[1:06:25] of Lord so you just need to go forward
[1:06:28] and obey the word of
[1:06:32] God and don't look at your
[1:06:34] weaknesses but look at the promises of
[1:06:38] God because the holy spirit is here to
[1:06:42] enforce all the pris
[1:06:47] God praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:06:50] need to live in the power of
[1:06:52] God that the holy spirit gives us
[1:06:56] the ability to perform his
[1:06:59] word and then you really don't allow
[1:07:03] Satan to bind you in his power of
[1:07:08] unbelief power of
[1:07:12] Doubt but to live in the
[1:07:15] power and in the might of
[1:07:18] God performing his
[1:07:20] word praise the name of the Lord let us
[1:07:23] finish with second Peter chapter 1
[1:07:29] second verse
[1:07:36] 3 the Bible says according as his divine
[1:07:40] power has given unto us all things that
[1:07:43] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:07:46] the knowledge of him that has called us
[1:07:49] to glory and virtue
[1:08:08] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:08:10] great and precious promises that by
[1:08:13] these you might be partakers of the
[1:08:16] divine nature having escaped the
[1:08:18] corruption that's in the world through
[1:08:21] last
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:50] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[1:08:52] the power of God
[1:08:55] has given us all
[1:08:59] things that concern this
[1:09:03] life that's eternal
[1:09:06] life and then his
