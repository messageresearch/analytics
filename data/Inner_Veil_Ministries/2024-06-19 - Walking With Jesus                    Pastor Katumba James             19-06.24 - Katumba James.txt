amen I great in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ all welcome for this service we appreciate brother has been able to step in the Gap brother Moses is held up at a place of work then brother is doing interv online also Ina then also up at a place of work we just need to keep we need more support Amen Let Us Go to Luke chapter 8 we want to receive our brother you're welcome also to be with us tonight amen Luke 8 verse 40 to verse 50 the Bible says and it came to pass that when Jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him and behold there came a man named jaras and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus's feet and besought him that he would come into his house for he had only one daughter about 12 years of age and she L dying but as he went the people thred him and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood was touched andus said who touched me when all the night Peter and they that were with him said Master the multitud thr thee and press thee and say though who touched me Jesus said somebody has touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and now she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith has made thee whole go in peace while he yet spoke there come one from the ruler of the s's house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made amen sing of his word I want to preach on Walking With Jesus walking with Jesus praise the name of the Lord we see a very interesting story that Jesus was called by jaras and then jaras and you see brother preached a message and called it jaras the secret believer and now he called him and he was moving with them and then along this way praise the name of our Lord and you see if you can look at this story of Jesus he meets and then they start moving and then the people are collecting Around Jesus you know kind of like pressing him and then now again the Bible leaves jaras and then the attention go goes to the woman with a blood issue and if you can read in the scriptures that is even how the Bible is written it can start with thises it halfway then start something else finishes it then goes back to where it started from and when you also read in the Book of Revelation you find those kind of areas praise the name of our even in the message of brother you know he starts on this he leaves it halfway he gets into another thing then again he goes back to what so you must be patient you know to follow the whole story and you see even that's how the Holy Spirit searches USA the you know like in the discernment brother Bram would be on the prayer line when he talking to this person then the Holy Ghost moves in the congregation say there is somebody like this and this and this oh there's again another one then again he comes back here and that's how the Holy Spirit keep on moving and we see the same thing here is that jaras was moving with the Lord and then then people were moving with the Lord but then there was a woman who had a blood issue and then the scripture says she determined within herself to touch the Lord Jesus Christ many people were walking with the Lord and then others were pressing him master all you are nice we have to have you around maybe like a social Gathering and we can also realize that we walk with Christ but how often do we realize that we are walking with Christ praise the name of our how often does it come to our attention how maybe sensitive do we become that we are walking with the Lord praise the name of our Lord look atus and his friends when we go to the Book of Luke Luke chap 24 and then the Bible says and then verse 13 and behold two of them went the same day to a village called Emos which was from Jerusalem about three and they walked and they talk together of all the things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew nigh and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him you know they were talking about Christ and brother Bram tells us when you talk about God that's when he comes praise the name of our Lord when you think about him when you start praising him also draws near we need to see that we have these opportunities that we can talk about God we can commune with God likeus and his friends they were talking while they were going to and then Jesus joined them but then they didn't know that Christ had joined them and started asking him what are you talking about and said you don't know what has happened in Jerusalem praise the name of our Lord and so now brother Bram tells us if we can go in this message the unwelcomed Christ praise the name of our Lord he says Jesus is here tonight Jesus keeps his appointment when he appoints that I'm going to be here he says he keeps his appointments no matter how you or where you are he kept his appointment with Jonah in the belly of a well he kept his appointment with Daniel in the Lion's death he kept his appointment with the children the Hebrew children the fairy FES praise God he kept his appointment with me on the death bed he's here tonight wherever two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in their midst Jesus keeps his appointments always praise the name of our Lord like we at church when we said that when next at 4:30 we are meant to be here he keeps his appointment praise the name of our Lord if we say we are having an overnight on Friday like next week on Friday he keeps his appointment if we say we having Sunday service Jesus keeps his appointment how about us praise the name of our Lord Jesus keeps his appointments how about us because he said where two or three are gathered in my I will be there in their so then you take it by faith that indeed the Lord is in our M and now when we know that the Lord is an arm let us not be like those people were just pressing Jesus without any benefit for their life but now this woman of a blood issue touched him by face and we also need to touch him by faith we shall be changed we need to touch him by Fai and all our travs will be over all our trials will be done everything that we go through praise the name of our Lord will provide a solution for you praise the name of our Lord so when we are walking with Jesus we need to touch him by faith we need to believe him by Faith Lord this is my name praise the name of the Lord you talk about it to Jesus you tell him what you have need of you tell him what your troubles are you tell him what your TRS are your problems you tell him about your sickness because he's the Healer praise the name of our Lord the Bible says he's the high priest that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities you are in his presence and then you are sick said Lord touch me Lord Heal Me praise the name of our whatever trouble you may have when you in his presence you just tell him Lord this is my name Lord this is my trouble Lord this is where I need your deliverance like that woman of the blood issue she was not ashamed to touch him whether the people were stepping upon her her if I can touch the H of his gun praise the name of our Lord if I can touch the H of His Garment and says in the message Divine love and Sovereign Grace a woman touched His Garment one time and went out and sat down in the crowd stood up wherever she was Jesus said somebody touched me and they said everybody denied it Peter said why Lord everybody is touching you why who touched me he said I perceiv that I got weak vir went out of me said somebody touched me and he looked around until he found the person and he told her about it now if she he touched if she touched His Garment and got what she wanted she ped gold through Christ the Bible say he can still be touched the Bible said he the high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities is that right so you can touch him tonight and if you will yield yourself to the love of God and I yield myself to the love of God God will project his presence with us and do the same things that he did when he was here on Earth do you believe it he will do it now this is not just a story praise the name of our Lord he says he is the high priest that is touched by the feeling of our INF so then what is your infirmity what is your desire like this woman had a desire touched him even us right now we can touch him for every need that we have for every weakness that we have failure that we have we can also touch him just walking with him is not enough walk with him and get his benefit praise the name of our Lord walk with him and fill his preses walk with him and get his healing if you are sick prise the name of our Lord walk with him and you get his pie if you are troubled walk with him and you get his comfort if you distressed walk with him and get his Joy if you are sorrowful praise the name of the Lord not going in a continuous lamentation you know hard nowadays you know this and this you know this and this walk with Christ and then he changes your Lamentations praise the name of our Lord he was walking but this woman touched him by we also need to touch him he said where two three are gathered in my name I there in the he's not there as a Wallflower he's not there as somebody who is really inactive but he wants you to touch him according to your need praise the name of our Lord so the woman touched him and then she was able to get the benefit and he has promised us whatever you asking my name if you believe you receive praise the name of our Lord and so when they kept on walking then somebody came and told jaras don't travel the master your daughter is dead what did Jesus tell don't fear she will be made well praise the name of our Lord and that's the comfort that we get from God we are with Him Praise the name of our whenever we are with him that's the comfort that we get from him fear not don't be troubled I'm with you always praise the name of and that should give us courage strength whether things are so bad financially you feel everything is down praise the name of our Lord maybe like Farmers some of them just planted and now the sunshine is too much until you find that the Harvest expectation is not there what do you do fear not praise the name of all your animals maybe are sick all your chicken may be all your businesses are collapsing all the taxes have risen up and they making you going to close down says fear not praise the name of our Lord you just need to be encouraged when you know he is with me then you draw strength from him when Abraham was an old man God said El imagine God telling an old man like Abraham that I'm the breasted God come and N from my breast and then brother Bram says with draw strength from the breast so was telling Abraham and old man that I'm still your father come and take milk from me and the strength we get from God from his promises praise the name of the Lord so what is your condition look at the promise that God has and that's why you grow your strength he has promised praise the name of our Lord so we just need to see that when we are walking with Jesus we draw strength from him with draw healing from him with draw comfort from him we draw Comfort peace and all that we have need of praise the name of now when we are walking with Christ we need to acknowledge his presence with us praise the name of our otherwise you be like and his friend who never knew that he was working with praise the name of our Lord we need to knowledge his presence we need to worship him we need to praise him we need to meditate upon his wife we need to think about him praise the name of our Lord and then we s another example when the parents the family of Jesus Christ when they walked with him when you read in Luke 2: 41 to verse 48 you may not read there praise the name of they walked with Jesus as a family and then they went to the temple and when they were there they thought Jesus was with them so they walked back and they left Jesus at the temple so just only walking with them you may forget him but you need him to be inside of you praise the name of Lord Peter was with him but he denied him Judas was with him but he betrayed him but yet he has promised praise the name of our Lord that I will dwell in you praise the name of our I will be in you in John chapter 14 praise the name of our Lord John 14 verse 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knows him but you know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you praise the name of our Lord so we have a promise that he will come and dwell in us he comes and sits in your life so you allow him to be the Lord of your life you allow him to lle your life he comes and resides inside of you now when Christ resides inside of you you cannot forget him like Mary when Christ is inside of you you cannot deny him like Peter when Christ is inside of you you cannot betray him like Jud but he always present in you in any time of trouble he will always prove his presence in your life praise the name of our Lord and this is what the Lord encouraged us that when they put you before Cel and then they start asking you he said don't think what you're going to say that very hour when they are putting a challenge to you the spirit of God will come and use you to speak the right how does that come because he right inside of you it's not you but it's God that dwells in you does it praise the name of the Lord so we need to have a personal relationship a relationship where we are certain that the Lord dwells in me the Lord lives in my life it's no longer I but it is Christ that lives in that should always be our testimony if you have met him as he resided inside of you praise the name of and that should be always just walking with him is not enough but you need to be with him right inside of you so wherever you go he's right inside of you praise the name of our Lord and that makes a lot of sense that will fight your battles he will fight all your battle praise the name of our Lord he will take over all your challenges he will help you in every trouble he will give you comfort he will direct you praise the name of our Lord at every time that the devil brings a challenge the Lord is always there praise the name of our Lord to help you overcome the challenge that you are with praise the name of our Lord in MTH 28 and then verse 20 the scripture says teaching them to observe all things whatsoever have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even un the end of the world Amen Matthew 28 ver amen so he says I'm always with you so whatever St you going through don't allow the devil to tell you for you Lord the Lord has left you praise the name of our Lord don't allow to make as if you are lonely praise the name of but just know that he's here with me and then you have fellowship with praise the name of whatever challenge that comes in life you must have that certainty that the Lord knows what I'm going and the Lord is interested in my welfare the is interested in my good health the Lord is interested in my Financial Health the Lord is interested in my family health or family wellbeing and then you take it by Faith Lord this is the promise your Lord this is what you've promised us come and take charge over my life come and direct my life praise the name of our Lord we just need to be certain of the Lord and when we know we are walking with him we know he's inside of us then ask what you will praise the name of our Lord and then you can bring it to the Lord and say Lord this is my name Lord this is my requ Lord I need you praise the name of our Lord acknowledge Him Praise the name of our Lord you know kind of like confess him praise the name of our Lord accept him Lord take over all my problems take over all my needs take over everything that I am look at that woman with BL 12 years spent all her living and then she said if I can touch the H of his gun if we can also touch the H of his G praise the name of our Lord going in Hebrews chapter 4 and then verse 14 praise the name of our Lord the Bible says seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold F our profession praise the name of the Lord say let us hold our confession so what is your confession praise the name of the Lord and your confession should not be your failure your confession should not be your sickness your confession should not be your weaknesses confession should be the promises of God praise the name of our Lord I know I am more than a conqueror praise the name of Lord when troubles come when sickness come when this trouble come when the other thing comes upon when they are fighting when they against you just say I am more than that's your confession your confession should not be if I'll be able to finish I don't know if I see the exams I don't know if I'm going to pass what should be your confession I am going to pass praise the name of so you don't confess negative things Christ is not there to intered for the failures but is there to intercede for your success is there to intercede for your wellbeing praise the name of our Lord is not there to intercede for your misery but now for your joy for your happiness and so that should be your confession Lord you promised this and Lord I receive it since you have promised it praise the name of our Lord the Bible says he is the high priest praise the name of our Lord so let us hold fast praise the name of our Lord let us stand steast our confession without wering you know the Bible says in Hebrews 10 ver 23 let us hold first the profession of our faith without wavering for is faithful that promised praise the name of the Lord don't allow doubt to come where the thing you want from the Lord praise the name of the Lord so he says hold fast your confession then verse 15 of verse of chapter 4 Hebrews for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need praise the name of our Lord he says let us come with boldness to the throne of grace that we obtain mercy and find Grace to help us in the time of need and the devil can cration any time but then you need to be firm that the Lord is with me praise the name of and you're not looking at what you're going through you're not looking at the the news you are hearing oh what the people are painting to be a terrible picture but you are looking at the promises of and the Bible says Jesus Christ is a high priest that is touched with the feeling of our infirmities and is the same yesterday today and forever we just take his promises and be strengthened and be encouraged praise the name of our so don't be discouraged don't be dismayed regardless of the that we are going there is no circumstance that is hard for the Lord praise the name of our Lord you just raise that sttion before the Lord I said Lord this is what I'm going praise the name of the Lord if I lack a job Lord I have need of a job you confess it praise the name of the Lord if your income is not doing well you ra it before the Lord he said ask what you will don't start don't wait for somebody to think for you you know what you have need and so you say Lord you are here you've said ask this is what I need you raise it to God praise the name of the Lord whever Jesus was going and then he would ask the people what will you have me to do it's the same thing even now what will you have the Lord to do for you then you confess it whatever you want the Lord to do for you say Lord this is my The Other Woman just touched him he said if I can touch him I be made whole praise the name of our Lord we can also touch him tonight our faith can touch him tonight Lord my mind is on my trouble here I don't want to keep on looking at my TR I want to look at the promise what you have promised him in this praise the name of the Lord and then the Bible says let the weak say I am strong praise the let the poor say I am rich why you're not looking at yourself you're not looking at your ability but you're looking at the high priest who promise to bring all that you have need praise the name of our Lord we need to have a perfect work with Christ that he influences us that he changes us that he meets our needs praise the name of Lord whatever you have
