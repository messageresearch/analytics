we request the church to remember brother WI prayer that the surgery may be successful amen you know prayer is very powerful very powerful when we live here on Earth we contend with forces of Darkness a very prayerful sister the other day was going out for a function and she was telling me Pastor just pray for me there is something that I don't see I'm going for a function but in somehow I see a funeral I don't know why so we really took time to pray and indeed if it were not for God there was going to be a funeral a very bad one but God intervened in a very special way I cannot give you the details here but God intervene in a very special way amen and one of us in the body was going to be part of the I mean the problem amen but the Lord miraculously saved them from the accident and many people don't know where their Redemption comes from amen but there are people who are praying for them they even don't know who they are so the sister insisted that we pray for her that when she goes God may change the situation amen so our God is good and all the time he must be woried we welcome our brother here you are welcome to be with us this morning God bless you you can maybe just come and

of the Saints they are before you this morning not hear from me but hear from you father I pray that you may take the instrumentalities of my body that you may speak by my vocal CS where my words cannot explain I pray that Revelation I strike every heart that is present speak deeply to us and hide your word in the depth of our hearts we commit ourselves into your presence you are the pter we are the clay where you feel like you break Breakers and M us again into the image of your glorious son the St of the perfect man in Jesus name we present ourselves amen amen so let's uh turn to scriptures this morning and see what the Lord is going to do we shall turn to Psalms chapter 1 amen do we have another V in our presence here if yeah God bless you there's another brother back there his first time to be with us I pray that the Lord May bless him amen so Psalms 1 and verse one blessed is the man that WTH not in the councel of the ungodly no stands in the way of Sinners no sth in the seat of the scone food but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and his Lord does he meditate day and night and it shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water God bringeth forth his fruit in his season his also shall not wither and whatsoever he does shall prosper do we want to prosper let's be planted by the rivers of water may the Lord reading the bless to the reading of his word uh let's resume our it amen so I have for a title I want you to listen properly we are preaching stability part eight fruit in his season amen so may the Lord be gracious to us now there is a statement of brother Bram here what we need you know is not juvenile delence no it is not juvenile delence parent delence because the parents has neglected and the whole lot of [Music] it is the way the church never preached it what's the matter Brethren get back to the gospel preach the old time Holiness and get into the church again we must have a standard that's good we must have a standard you know when we see these schools they've got a standard you don't just go there dressed with anything you need to have a uniform you know we need to have a standard as Christians you don't just be anything and remain to be a Christian so God will change the world someday and the world will have to have a standard and brother Bram says the church must be that standard that when the people see you they are looking at a standard of what a Christian must be amen so in Psalms 1 the scripture speaks about the life of a Christian but when he comes to verse three he brings in the life of a messenger to an age the life of the messenger to the age the entire Psalms chapter one is speaking about the life of a Christian in relation to his interaction with Society but when he comes to verse three this verse here specifically addresses the messenger so verse one is the blessed man amen that WTH not in the Cel of the ungodly how many of you are blessed here today a blessed man does not walk in the cast of the ungodly now walking is taking a distance amen it's not just a matter of sitting you are taking a journey you are taking a distance but in this type of Journey which is your course of walk as a Chris in this earth God canels you that you should not take Cel of the wicked I know there are some young girls here they are looking at a marriage but sometimes they take the Cel of the wicked the young men who are looking for a wife they may take the cancel of the wicked we don't need to take the Cel of the wicked because the Christian church has got standard amen you just go into the word and you find the standard you have your Bible you have the spoken word books amen so that you don't go out back and forth to look for Cel about situations a blessed man will always take counsel from the world he will take a counsel about his family he will take a Cel about his job he will take C about his Christian Life he does not Vis Mr Google for the I mean for his Christian life amen so and if he is a minister he does not mix seeds in his farm he knows the pure seeds to s in the Christian farm he has been given faith amen and that Faith which we have is T is typed by a mastered seed and the must seed is the smallest of seeds but it cannot be hybrid are you together with me so sometimes people are looking for some Mega uh ideas to live their lives but our faith is just as small as a mustard seed but you know the nature of faith we have you know Christ compared to the Master Seat because it is small you cannot hybrid it you cannot add anything to it it always turns pure but once you plant it it grows into a very big tree and all the clean birs of the air will want to come and roast in that tree hallelujah hallelujah when you have your little Mustard Seed F and it's planted in the good ground of your soul and watered by the spirit of Christ it makes you grow up into a man of great influence so that all the clean birs of the air like doves and Eagles you know they come and Roo in that tree you are going to become the anchor of fellowship and like we said the other Sunday you become a pillar in the house of God Amen a pillar it supports the structure the super structure connects you to the foundation it Bears the weight and I want to have those kind of Christians that are pillars and they've got enough muscle to Bear the super structure that you have a Christian here but is uh uh the kind that can really produce a positive influence amen and you know he happy being a pillar amen so this blessed man here does not stand in the way of Sinners with Sinners because a sinner is the one who does not uh have the confidence of the word and because he has no confidence in the word then he ends up bearing evil fruit because the word which would be his fortification amen he doesn't have confidence in it amen praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah that's a blessed man he doesn't go with people who don't have confidence in the world we need to surround ourselves with positive men who believe the word when the word speaks they can say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah so a blessed man has not Bas under negative influence amen because we have a man who has blessed but he affected himself you know he negatively affected himself by sitting around with men of negative influence he has been given to us as an example that you can be a Christian a positive believer but you can flock together with men of negative influence and they can affect you this man is Isaiah amen and this man believed he had a gift of God and indeed he had that gift of God but and he also thought that his life was perfect until God allowed him to stand in the presence of that scanning light of his presence you know God himself is a fire is a light is a scanner that when you stand before him you are just transparent everything you have done which he the side it just become very open to you so when Isaiah went into that presence he was very surprised he didn't know he was that kind of un evil man amen so there is something that takes over your normal judgment amen when you stay in negative community when you go with men who don't have confidence in the world they smear their influence upon you and that influence blind you you keep thinking you are okay with God when the honest light you are not so God you know one time took his man his name is Isaiah and picked him from the Society of the negative people who had dir lips and brought him before himself I want tell you one thing but if you come from God God can never lose you at a certain time in life he'll pick you up and bring you in the presence of his scanning life and that's what he did to Isaiah and Isaiah said why is me I am because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes I've seen the king the Lord of host amen so all the things he said the things he said about the Brotherhood the things he said about people they all came back to him so dwelling in the midst of dat lips amen gave Isaiah similar dat lips when they speak you get tempted to say something also and Isaiah found out that he had said a lot of dirty things in his life and I want tell you that the tongue here is a powerful weapon it can set fire on a forest just like a little [Laughter] Marl you light it just small put it on a leaf it can burn an entire forest and that's how James defines the tong amen so we need to guard the tong amen I mean t can defile the hearts of the people and then you find out that this heart could even permanently be affected because somebody said something so Isaiah could only come clean when he came before the throne of grace are we before the throne of grace this morning amen and he cried out because evil [Music] company had affected these garments of righteousness so Isaiah needed a call of fire to clean his mouth because that mouth is contagious amen you see there is only one thing that when a man has a dirtty mouth the only way you can keep company with him is either you also pick that mouth if you can take the d m then you part from that d m because it's a contagious disease You Begin by feeling checked when you say things and then you come to a time when you don't care what you say but a blessed man should design his life around the world he should avoid the seat of the SC and he should Delight in the love of the Lord and meditate there in day and night amen so the mind of a man who has found favor with God should be preoccupied by the word that man has found favor with God a blessed man is not one who's got lots of money amen a blessed man is man who has found fav before God that's a blessed man you want to M the favor amen that gave you eternal life then you must guard yourself Hallelujah hallu but when the psalmist comes to verse three God introduces to the way of the junctional man amen a messenger in whom the will of God for the age is hidden amen so when we are moving the journey back into eternity where we came from we come to a point of a junction and whenever we get into a junction God does not allow his children to guess which way to go in that Junction he always places a junction of man an anointed man Noah was a junctional man he could not God could not let the people guess and then Moses was a junction of man the people had cried and God had heard people had labored and God had see when time comes to that God always puts a junction so along the move of the church all the way from pent to the change of our body when the church is taken out of the earth God has plac seven Junction men at the seven Junction of time and these men here they hide the will of God Amen the way they live their Liv is the revelation of how God wants the men to walk in this Junction of life God hides in that man the Revelation to the ede are you together with me because the life lived by the messenger is the revelation of the character of God for that particular age Hallelujah hallu and so when the p is writing he talked about verse three here and he says and he shall be like a tree Ed by the rivers of water amen that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his shall not wither and whatsoever he doth he shall prosper hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord there are so many great things in that verse he shall be like a river I mean like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen all the flows of the virt of the Holy Spirit you know goes through his life amen now here there again amen and bringeth forth his fruit in his season there are two his here his fruit whose fruit God's fruit in the season of that messenger are you together with me he stands there to tap into the fruit of that season and once it Taps it it positively affect his life that it can influence the people at the junction of time to know how to live their lives oh praise the Lord so today I'm going to be very fundamental in my preacher because I want to talk about the fruit of the season the must be a fruit of the Season by their fruits you know them amen there must be something because the word is a SE and once you saw it it has to bring forth a fruit but what kind of fruit should the message of the hour bring out of us he fruit in his season amen he's planted by the rivers of water so this man here becomes a parable to the age are you together with me he becomes a parable to the age the way he lives his life is a parable to the ede and you take a church that's always in arguments and stewing just remember they are not they are in a desert and out of water that one no we are not going to accept brother says you just know that church is in a desert is not planted by the rivers of water because it's not natural water but the virtues of Life flows through that church amen and it does not have time to steal to argue to preach about other people there's too much in the world to cover that we don't have time to deal with outside stuff amen a church that's long I mean that's loving and humble and flexible and Fs and goes with the word of God remember they are living by the fountain that never dries up that's the church amen so this man here amen shows us how where this particular verse verse three shows us how where the junction of man is planted how it would help him to bring forth God's fruit in season because himself as a man would need that fruit too so for him to bring forth fruit he has to be planted by the rivers of water so where he planted amen shows us how important that he stands in that spot so that the rivers of water which is the very life of God himself would flow through him to the generation without which he cannot bear fruit in his season hallelujah hallelujah is planted in the right place that brings forth fruit in season so I want you to read this scripture this way and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth God's fruit in the messenger season and his amen shall not wither and whatsoever he does shall prosper and then transfer that and put it in your own life if you are standing by the rivers of water Hallelujah the right fruit will come out of you in season because you were stationed by the rivers of water and when temper comes then the stream of temperance comes through because that's the season amen sometimes when you need to a brother then the re brotherly kindness comes through and you just don't know you just a brother I had gone too far with that man but something changed me are you together with me you are planted by the rivers of water and at the right season you bear the right fruit amen are you together with me so every AG had a form of fruit to bring forth like at the edge of Paul had a form of fruit to bring forth and the messenger was the fruit example for Ed because when he stood in the channel of the FL of the Holy Spirit then the Holy Spirit positively affected the life of that man and that man began to Bear the fruit that God wanted that age to bear so the revelation of the word and the way that messenger lived his life was a teaching to the [Music] people look when anybody came and trying to say something the Disciples of that time they only said you don't speak like are you together with me and that was enough his life his understanding his way of life teaching to the people amen listen to what brother Bram says here now he shall bring forth his fruit in his season watch E he is the personal pronoun there it is his fruit God's fruit in the season the prophet is bringing it it will be in the prophet season God's fruit In God's Time by The Prophet season he shall bring forth his fruit in this season see if there isn't two he there bring forth God's fruit the season that the messenger is ordained to come he bring forth those now remember the messenger that brings the fruit of God will bring it in God's season in the season of the bringer he bring forth his fruit in his season and this fruit cannot wither is got predestinated fruit in there it can't destroy it because it's predestinated fruit hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't wither you cannot say now another fruit is coming instead of this so God brings this man in God's Own season so that he can stand as a teaching life to the rest of the body are you together with me Mal is our teaching life amen so he stands out and brings forth the of the church are you together with me a church is not somebody saying I believe Jesus to be my personal Savior and you stop there there must be a standard are you together with me so God uses this message to bring forth the standard he bring to the Forefront the fruit of God for the age he steps forth to manifest that fruit as a standard of life on the edge and that fruit is Everlasting did you hear that amen you see what I'm trying to say is that when he comes with the world the world produces its life in the Believers and that's the standard so I will take you to the first church age to give you an example here in Revelation 2 verse1 he says to the angel of the church church ofus right these things says he now he is introducing himself the one who is speaking to this church is being described as one that holds the Seven Stars in his right hand and walks in the midst of the seven golden candles and then he stops there that's not all that Christ is hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is more than that but what is revealing of himself is the floor of virtue the river that the church would need in that age are you together with me there is more to him but he says at this time what they need is to know the one who is holding the Seven Stars in his right hand and walking in the midst of theen it was the beginning of the Church of the New Testament because John John in Revelation he's having a preview of the church this is the church the beginning of it and the winding up of it and he's looking all through to the end until he sees New Jerusalem coming from heaven like a bride adored for her husband so John starts at the beginning here and he sees all the way to the end are you together with me so now at the beginning is seeing the beginning of the church that the one who has come as the Lord of [Applause] lords he has seven stars because there are seven Junctions to the church ages so now we held Seven Stars and these Stars here according to Revelation chapter one and verse 20 there were the angels to the seven churches are you together with me now listen friends the angel is a messenger hallelujah hallelujah are you together with me now that's what the word angel means messenger if is an messenger is caring a message from God if he an angel from heaven he also has a message but those angels from Heaven they got wings but the men on Earth who are anointed to bring a special message to the they are referred to as Angels hallelujah hallelujah so there were seven angels Seven Stars in his right hand John is trying to tell the church that all these Messengers that will come through the Journey of the church will be under Divine protection hallelujah hallelujah we in the right hand of power in the right hand of authority hallelujah hallelujah and when this messenger comes he Bears the fruit of his age and the same anointing that has kept him and worked through him again goes over Tak over the enti church are you together with me so what happens now that the entire church is under Divine protection hallelujah hallelujah do you know friend that you are under his presence you are under Divine protection you are under Divine Guidance the life of a messenger is a teaching to the people where he is in the right hand of God the church is in the right hand of God hallelujah huah so John in the first CH he says the Seven Stars in the right hand of God oh praise God working through the seven candlesticks and those are the churches God himself Works in his church oh hallelujah hallelujah amen there's no Prophet Within there's no pop with him there's no Cardinal with him there's no Bishop with him there's no pastor with him he is the author of the church so he walks in the church how does he walk in the church in the first church age he threw the St up and that was Paul and Paul started to shine to the edge the people were walking in the lights of that star which was the light of God that was God in the seven churches when that light became deep up another one and God by a Divine Light in the life of a messenger Hees to guide the church are you together with me that's the way God works amen some of the people people are trying to pray that they may hear some voices to know that God is with them you don't need no voices you just need the word that's all you need oh Hallelujah huah amen so what happens here is that God would dig from his nature to identify the character the age needed to overcome the challenge in the ede and then he would announce that character and then he would offer that character to the church hallelujah hallelujah he announces it I am the one who is holding the Stars I am the one who is working in the church he has announced the character that whatsoever messenger comes that will be my voice amen so this introduction of Christ to the Saints of the age was relevant to their daily work amen so Christ in never was the Overcomer hallelujah hallelujah it's not the people it is Christ who was the Overcomer Hallelujah in your daily walk Christ is the Overcomer amen he says I know you have got a little strength but I have set before you an Open Door which no man can close God opens every door in your life God is the Overcomer in your life amen he just comes and hides himself as a special that's you being aeed by the rivers of water that a particular anointing necessary for you to overcome to come and take over your life amen so Christ in every age was the Overcomer he still the Overcomer in my age the overc in every individual life he gives you the VT to live by amen I'll go back to the verse I love so much here is our love made perect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment now many people think of the judg day but here says that judgment must start in the house of God in the body of the church are you together with me the trials you go through the persecutions the trying of your faith amen you are standing in judgment and what's being judge is not you but the nature of sin that's in you being Jud he says our boldness to stand in the day of judgment because as he is we are in this world hallelujah hallelujah but we will be but we are what he is we are not we will be but we are how can we be except that the scripture comes alive when he says when Christ who is our life shall be revealed so the life you live on the inside is Christ amen you see I I want you to see this that Christ in you the hope of glory it can't you you can't overcome and you cannot even live the life the scriptures tell you to unless you stood by the rivers of water that anointing and as the anointing flows through you then that's your victory so our boldness in the of judgment which in our case is now that boldness must rest in the truth that we have allowed Christ to live his life here by the instrumentality of the members of our B to an extent we are what he is the ministry and the later becomes him did you hear that becomes him [Music] unfortunately some people looking at but down on the inside there is a life and that life keeps coming through until it comes to the St of a perfect and becomes a rupturable life amen so Christ holds the Seven Stars in right in his right hand and these Seven Stars with seven different [Music] anointings amen of the one God and in Revelation 5 these anointings were referred to as seven spirits that God has seven spirits and some people say yes seven spirits but let's go to Revelation 5 verse I want tell you you are this not you amen but Christ in you will take up every Cheng bring you to victory your character will to Victory amen Revelation 56 and I beheld and in the midst of the throne and of the beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain hallelujah hallelujah finished work of Calvary having seven HS which HS is the hiding of power and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God forth into the earth now to begin with we know these are not teaching a new and contr joh 44 which says God is a and of course one Spirit but this you know here is like First Corinthians chapter 12 8 11 where we find one fruit manifesting himself in N ways he doesn't say the fruits of the spirit he says the fruit of the spirit so in here you best understand it like looking at an orang one but there are sever slices in there are you together with me so now is God in the N gifts of the holy spirit he calls it the gift so we know that the seven spirits of God means it is one Spirit and the Same Spirit coming in the Sevenfold manner amen because you are seven stars seven Messengers and every one of these Messengers has a totally independent anointing different from another messenger and now when Paul John is looking he sees seven spirits he says the anointing upon different from even is different is different and even is different even wle is different and he says seven spirits but it's actually one spirit manifesting in seven different forms so are you together with me so now in Revelation 45 these same Spirits I called lamps of fire burning before the Lord so the next thing here is he walks in the m of the seven amen so this life kept filtering into the church as planted in by the seven men that Carri the anointing hallelujah hallelujah do you understand that now when planted whatever he planted the way and now when it grew to maturity then we've go to the next one also planted whatever planted was added to what way now in our time Hallelujah in our time we at the end we in the seventh Church Age We have got the fullness of what the seven spirits was hallelujah hallelujah no wonder in our age comes the Revelation the Myster of the God because the fullness was now here hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah oh Hallelujah therefore Paul was the planter of the first churches the seeds of revelation God had given him the scripture say they set for the [Applause] foundation you cannot do anything without going back to the apostolic found what are you building you have to go back to the foundation let's go to First any computer anges are different when he's doing his programs Five May mean 10 so verse 10 here Paul says according to the grace of God which is given to me meaning that he was given the seed as a wise master build I have laid the foundation and another build but let every take build there I'm being so fundamental this morning because I'm trying to bring forth the fruit in season because every seed planted must bring forth fruit what must the Malachi for seed bring forth okay so God gives the message of the grace to open the souls of men to the word of God in the earth okay now listen to this quote here now we can that Jesus Christ is revealing himself Through the Ages by his Spirit In The Messengers God reveals himself to the edge Through The Messengers they become a teaching life did you hear that the Messengers become a teaching life to thege so they are as Moses was to the children of Israel he has had the Revelation for [Music] his so each messenger had God's revelation and Min for that day thus when we see the m MERS in his right hand we see the Lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his [Music] power did you hear that granting them his power and that's the victory for the god not send a powerless message because it's the Overcomer how will the church overcome without the indwelling Christ how can you overcome your weaknesses without an indwelling Christ how can you overcome unless you decide to surrender certain your life father it never be then he grants you the power shall we take a decision this morning amen it's not enough that he has Associated himself with the World Church which we saw when he was standing among the seven golden lamp is it even enough that we see the five Ministry of Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors for each age the pastor I mean the church goes in every age the church goes as and not just the later but the CLG group shepher are wrong as well as sheep then God brings himself on the sea as the chief sheer Amen in the ministries of these seven men to lead these people back to the truth and the Abundant power of that truth God is in his people all his people so if any man has the spirit of Christ he none of his and he is the word that would be the word recognized in the people but he has placed a special leadership in this men of his own choosing through the determined C of his will they appear once in each Edge it's the same spirit in them okay so now the messenger appears on the edge what next because we see in Revelation chapter 1 that Jesus reveals himself to John on the of and then tells John to send messages to the seven churches which were by these Messengers then he would get the man of to the angel of Ephesus so now the men would come to check on the ministry of John and I mean to check on the life of John because he was on the island because it was a problem to the Roman Church I mean to the Roman Empire they tried to kill him they couldn't die they tried to boil him in O he and he was there alone there were all kind of very poisonous reptiles and they knew he would die but he couldn't die God instead started visiting and these men here so much love those men loved so much that they wouldn't fear the reptiles of the they would go there to check on him and then God would know the man who is coming is from Ephesus and then he says right are you together with me so then he would write as the man goes back he goes with the message back to the church in Ephesus now the pastor sat down the Apostle sat down the sat down everybody sat down the messenger was now voice to that church are you together with me yes sir okay now let's look at the principle second Timothy chapter 2 verse one you love Bible teaching that's how you are going to stabilize in your Christian work God bless you brother you now under my command amen he knows you know because you remember whatever it is he said you don't need to come to my house I'm a man under Authority if I say go he goes if I come he comes because he's under Authority amen what's the authority of brother here when he says go no man can disobey his voice amen and so this man here he also went and the command every and things changed instantly in the church listen second Timothy 2 verse one th there for my son be strong in the that that is in Christ Jesus this is Paul the messenger commissioning Timothy and the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also did you hear that he says even the things you had about me that's why I say when God become I mean sends a message he becomes a teaching to the [Music] end and after commissioning him he says Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ praise the Lord so this is how it works from Paul the messenger to Timothy and from Timothy to faithful and faithful men to others also after that he says I Endure hardness as a soldier timoy you are not a soldier but endure hardness the way a soldier endures hardness when is in the season of War why would Paul tell Timothy that because the opening of The Words which has never been known before would alwaysa a war are you together with me I think I sent you the message amen about some of our young missionaries there they were preaching and they came to think that these people had never had and some men who were the leaders of the district and what are FAL prophets as brother Bram says about the opening of a seal what happen a SE is open what that a mystery is unfold and when a mystery unfold then a trumpet sounds it declares what a plague Falls what is that part that war part the Ang of the church catches the Myster of God not ful yet [Music] reveal but when he does catches the Myster of God and when he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him for the people what does he do out there he begin to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual and it tells him the is open truth are coming for hand yourself like a soldier on war so the war is always concerning the revealed will of God to the are you together with me now the truth comes and it opens up a wall the wall is because the truth will always challenge the standard [Music] it will call the church from the St position back to the center he bring forth his fruit in this season but what is the fruit of this season what will this message have to bring [Music] because the fillment look here now the fruit in our season is The Fill Mal 4 verse 5 and God sending us a prophet in this age amen it is restoring people back to the apostolic foundation not maintaining the church in the era of the denomination is calling people out of denomination teaching them the sovereignity of a local church revelation of the one true God and not being a trinity the true baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are not entitles the sereny the position of the believing woman in the Bible women and need for decy the standard teaching to these sisters is let your women keep silence in the churches it's not permitted to them to speak but they are commanded to be and obedience as also says the Lord hallelujah hallelujah all this is the fruit of the age where we walk and then you wonder am living in the channel where this fruit will positively affect my life so God releases this truth and paules Timothy saying hardness as a good soldier of the Cross so while dispensing this truth it causes a spiritual war you understand what I mean you see he desires all people to be saved and also come to the knowledge of the truth so while dispensing this truth it brings a challenge it's Paul to Timothy Timothy to Faithful Men Faithful Men to others also and this line of command is very necessary to keep the Revival burning when you shift from the life then the gospel loses Direction listen brother Bram says in every age we have exactly the same pattern that's why that's why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from the messenger they sprad the light through the ministry of others who are being Faithfully Tau but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken and Paul remember want the people to say only what he say are you together with me we have the Bible it has spoken to us and we speak what the Bible says for you just Crum things like that but if you don't CR we must maintain the fruit and brother Bram says they add here all they take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down how careful we must be hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice is the voice of God want them to say what he say as Peter did likewise he warned them that even he Paul could not change one word what he had been given by Revelation how important it is hear the voice of God by way of his Messengers and then say what has been given the church okay so the messenger is the standard of God's requirement for the age amen so you remember in Psalms 13 the scripture speaks about this man and he says it shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of what that bringeth forth God's fruit in the season of the message amen so God hands this man with seeds of the ede go and plant the word and say go and plant the word meaning he gives him the right seed of the word to the edge all his Harvest hallelujah hallelujah in that age must be exactly like the message that he has put into the people some of you have planted and some of you don't have the opportunity to plant like a corn you only plant roses because you grew up on the streets of the city but when you plant a purle rose R it doesn't come yellow are you together with me when you plant that thny [Music] Rose you cannot have a a a harvest of the rose without no thought the seed that goes down must bring back the life that was in the sea amen and so Mal was given some seeds to plant and harvest that is because of the message of Mal must resemble the message of amen and that's why we stick on the Revelation to the end hallelujah hallelujah holding the standard high so that by the grace of God maintain the life of the Holy Ghost in the church amen let us look at it here some of the things Deuteronomy chter 22se it a seed planted in the Malachi 4 message the woman shall not wear that which pertain a man neither shall a man put on a amen woman garment for all that do so Abomination the Lord thy God did you hear that so before the spirits of Sodom churches men were real men and women were real women amen men dressed as men they loved their wies they took responsibility of their they worked for the family and took care of their children that was the seed where is that seed in the harest we must bring back the same life amen and the women took their positions as women they dressed as women they were natural on the inside and the outside they took care of their children where are the Harvest in those areas listen the seeds First Corinthians 11:15 was s by Mal 4 and we must make sure that it comes to the Harvest he says in verse 15 but if a woman have long hair it's a glory to her for her hair is given for her for Recovery not now amen because it is the hair which is the covering and when she cuts her hair even if she puts head catch amen she has cut her covering you see what listen in First Corinthians 115 for every woman that prayers or propes with C for that [Music] is so what is the covering there the covering is your beautiful hair amen so God car so much about the looks of women because they represent to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ adored like the bride in Revelation 19 to her was granted amen that she should be L clean and white L is the righteousness of the Saint the is not dressed in Scamp dresses in TI she was dressed in a gar it was not a Min are you together with me he bring forth his fruits in his season and the scripture says this fruit doesn't wither stand of this mess doesn't with we just need to maintain it I'm going in a s spot now in Second Kings chter this back the standard see that we are watching whether there are some kind of you know what do you call them weeds that we may weed them out just we out from your heart the desires of those things Lord I want to be a fruit in season 2 Kings 9:13 and when was come toel heard of it now I want you to see here what does happen when je hears I mean when Jezebel hears of je what happens she painted her yeah because je is coming I'm tired because I mean je was coming amen and looked out at a window in and smiles you see my painted face it's not our way of life but it's because je is coming I win her by myal looks she pains I know all I know his wife and now when he sees me [Music] why did Jezebel pain so I must do my best and brother Bram said a woman never did pain her face to meet God she painted her face to meet men and that was Jezebel Jezebel painted her face and put a round tire around her head and went out to meet the man no other woman did that I would support you if Sarah painted her face if Rea painted her I would support you maybe if Elizabeth painted her or Mary the mother of the Lord's body painted her face the only woman that painted her face was a negative character and brother Bram sold those seeds and the Harvest must be reflected in Fruit amen amen now let me just talk about even the natural dangers amen of trying to bleach your face this is science now sence when you apply a skin bleaching product to the skin such as Hydro it decreases the number of melanites in your skin this can result in a lighter SK and more even appearance in the skin skin bleaching has been associated with the number of adverse health effects amen isal poison because it's also in that kind of those sping uh creams signs and symptoms of matal poisoning include the skin begins to die in certain parts high blood pressure fatigue neic symptoms such as tror amen memory Los and irritability then you get what we call theis which is a problem of your skin this is the inflammation of the skin caused by contact with certain substances symptoms can range from mild to s skin readers blisters skin ERS dry SK skin singing burning and tenderness amen then he talks about exogenous [Music] it is a skin disorder that causes black pigmentation it usually occurs as a complication of long time use of skin bleaching creams people who use it on large areas of the body on the entire body they develop what they call EO e e okay are you together with me so this kind of thing here if you find a person who has used the bleaching for a long time the skin dies becomes black and some like Reds [Music] of there's more I would have put it amen so the changed lives of the people is the fruit of the ministry his fruit in this season will be the positive effect in the lives of the people and every Ministry we always bear some fruit and Paul called the colians the Corinthians the Seal of his apostleship the Corinthians you are it's you who stamps for me that everyone who sees you says that Paul you are apos oh praise the Lord yes sir so he had dued them from a deep and presented them before Christ as a mature so as we talk about these things sometimes you start saying can I ever become that can I ever come to the stat of a yes that's where you are headed you will not fail you are here because God called you amen the Corinthians were so that in a Ministry they only saw the Press of Menos that's how kind they were they did not come to church feed from the word they came to cheer up their leaders and Pa called them they ate things which were sacrificed they were FR among themselves amen someone goes and gets man out of a brother on way they practice am with his father's wife they drank and messed up the Lord's table were disorder church that even misus the gifts amen and they put women preachers in the everything wrong was among those Corinthians but when brother Bram was preaching about them he called them corth the Church of Correction and I'm sure God can correct our church also individual and bring us to a level that is so pleasant to the father somebody amen again amen yes sir them out of the pit amen and brought them to a level where I started dropping greater nuggets amen and the Corinthians had grown to the level that they can swallow great nuggets isn't that wonderful we look at our ourselves as weak we look at ourselves as fa but The God Who in our midst is the overcome hallelujah hallelujah is going to lift us from glory to glory glory to glory until he can feed us mature food like Paul would again feed the Corinthians he had called on greater depth are you together with me I believe you are going [Applause] to that's what we are here for and I'll continue preaching stability forever until we bring our church to level that's very pleasing a stable church not scared of a St scared of anchor our in I got my foot on the Rock Amen so brought them up and he started telling them you who were drunk who messed up the gifts the evil I want tell you that you've got a waiting body Hallelujah he started showing them about the visions of the third Heavens he said I know a man was in the body or out of the body I do not know but he was C in the third heavens and the things which he saw it's not even fair for a man to say was telling them Hallelujah he Tau them the of the Resurrection the secret catching the bride the handing over of the power from the son to the Father the fullness of time the good teaching of a growing church and Paul called them you are the Seal of my AP praise the Lord amen let's go to First Corinthians chapter 1 and verse we are finishing soon are you happy today now Paul is talking about the fruit so when we preach we are sewing seeds which bring forth fruit the messenger in the age he was his fruit in his season he was a teaching life he says am I not an apostle am I not free have I not seen Jesus Christ Our Lord are not ye my work in the Lord if I be not an apostle others yet doubtless I am the Seal of my apost in the Lord people come to a level and they begin to disregard the ministry why do you me would you have reached at this level okay to others I'm not an apost but to you I'm the Apostle look at where I got you from Paul he's saying that the fruit your life is the Seal of my apost so the Corinthians were God's ultimate fruit in seon like we are all together the fruit of the season of Malachi amen we can say that we are The Messengers fruit in the ministry and the words of the messenger Paul should Echo back to us there cannot be a stable Church Without A standing Minister amen second Timothy chapter 1 verse wherefore I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God which is in You by putting on of my the gift how can I the gift by using it St the gift continue staring the gift and the other day Inon in our demon this daily admon I told you that Every Man Has a gift St your gift if is to pray be a pray warri spend time on your knees talk to God and let me tell you the best person to pray is the man who has ever been I tell you can pray when he comes around you you don't even ask him people you see them it flows automatically let prayer flow automatically [Music] so you turn that into prayer Pray for the brothers pray for the sister pray for the church start the gift if you are a song leer let that gift be St Let It Grow gain courage and confidence where is when you come here be confident that yes God gave me a gift I'm going there to use it the gift when you come to church if you are a prayer warrior in the corner Heavenly Father help the pastor to reach all these areas corers with the people the word affecting the People Help the man he hold his answer just like you know Aon and would raise the hands of Moses that one but is preaching come on Corinthian grow up and bring forth fruit amen verse 8 says be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord his prison but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God this is what is telling don't be [Music] ashamed of the message of your age I tell you I'm proud that God gave me a junction of M where could I be without the ministry of brother people are proud of their little soal prophets they put on even their t-shirts they go bow down and they kiss their shoes we see them on TV amen they go so I cannot be ashamed of the junctional messenger God has given us his life was a teaching life and his teaching is very sound amen okay let's go and look at Paul a little bit I say today I'm coming to teach Foundation the things that we should get identified with and not be ashamed because that's what the message brings amen I'm finishing first verse 15 for you have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have you not many fathers for in Christ Jesus have begotten you through the gospel wherefore iek you followers of me that's the messenger amen that you may have many instructor men who come in Amen to continue pushing the knowledge of the word but we've got only one messenger God has sent to the Earth so God has always used many in the but he gives us only you know One messenger we had one Moses and under him was Aon the priest Lal ranks then Joshua this means that whatever there is if we develop a question we know where to go back to are you together with me we know where to go back to do you know why the men out there they try to assume power and prove to the people that they are super people the people the Lord told me he told me and then you but God we have the word that's our Focus M came he took us to the word amen so that's a very wonderful thing I don't have to come here and tell you about Visions so that you may believe me you believe me because I have the word is that amen yes sir I don't you know I don't have to become an assumer the Lord told me here I don't have to do that you love the word and God loves you because you love the word you founded on the worlds fa the word never fa amen okay First Corinthians 3 PA says I planted apoll watered God gave the increase amen so then neither is he that planteth anything nether that but God give the increase by that statement there Christ and the Bible becomes our absolute hallelujah hallelujah because Malachi 4 took this Bible to lead us back to the word amen and we are now anchored when I him amen I know I'm quoting what the Bible say so bringing forth his fruit in his season he had to preach what the bride had to be in that age bringing forth God's fruit in the season of the bringer so that we become the fruits of the word amen are you going toey the word and say Lord I Thank you for the word amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise and thank God that he has given us a message let's stand up amen bringing forth his fruit in his season amen if you try to come through something run it back in the word and you say this the fruit of the is this what I'm supposed to be is this how I'm supposed to treat my wife is this how I'm supposed to treat my family is this how I'm supposed to dress is this how I'm supposed to associate with the public because we know what the Harvest must be we know the fruit what we must bear so that the people will say that's a young girls I know you are proud of your bodies but that body is not yours there's a man who owns that body if he has not come don't start displaying the body us and you put on everything tight if he has come preserve that body until he comes and when he comes you don't have
