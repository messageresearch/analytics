[49:57] and so I'm happy to be among my
[50:01] own hallelujah hallelujah
[50:05] amen this morning Papa was talking to
[50:10] us and then he was literally
[50:15] preaching praise the Lord and I felt
[50:18] real calm in the
[50:21] spirit and blessed to tap again from him
[50:28] amen
[50:30] amen greetings from my
[50:35] wife on the children
[50:39] Hallelujah uh of all
[50:43] times this is the time my wife has felt
[50:46] the pain to miss to come
[50:51] here she felt the
[50:54] pain of missing to come
[50:58] yeah but it's because of the
[51:01] responsibility back
[51:04] home I believe at God's appointed time
[51:07] she'll be
[51:09] here amen I bring you greetings from a
[51:13] few brethren we
[51:16] met they love you with the Christian
[51:22] love amen and this
[51:25] morning uh uh in the ministry there
[51:29] is uh you feel
[51:35] irrelevant you feel
[51:39] worthless of less
[51:44] importance when what only makes you
[51:48] comfortable is when we look back to the
[51:53] Cross that's where
[51:57] amen so I got to know our precious
[52:01] brother
[52:04] here uh brother
[52:09] Titus
[52:11] and
[52:13] he he loves the
[52:15] Lord and dad being a
[52:20] father uh he said bring him
[52:23] over praise be to the name of the Lord
[52:27] amen just like I've said
[52:30] before that you
[52:33] know it really feels irrelevant
[52:36] sometimes to think you're
[52:40] relevant I think that's why in Luke
[52:46] 1710 after you've done all that you're
[52:49] supposed to
[52:51] do praise the
[52:53] Lord you just have to stay
[52:58] cool and know that whatever you've
[53:01] done it is just what you supposed to
[53:05] do so this
[53:07] morning based on that
[53:11] scripture I believe we are just here to
[53:14] do what the Master's called us to
[53:22] do uh I thank pastor
[53:28] I'm really finding it since
[53:33] we I call him
[53:37] Pastor it is always easier to say
[53:42] Dad and
[53:45] Mom bless you
[53:48] Pastor meeting him has never left me the
[53:52] same meeting
[53:54] him has never left me the
[53:58] same and I came here last
[54:03] time have never come to say thank
[54:11] you to say thank you so
[54:14] much uh for your support for the carja
[54:21] missions I delivered your
[54:24] gift and it's a blessing to those people
[54:27] down
[54:30] there there is a time I really was
[54:32] burning to
[54:36] come and each time we made appointment
[54:38] to come I failed to
[54:41] come about three
[54:44] times so finally when it was burning and
[54:47] burning and eating me
[54:51] up uh so I really wanted to come
[54:57] then one day I got a dream I shared
[55:03] recently I came
[55:06] here and then Pap come and
[55:12] preach and when I came to
[55:15] preach I opened my
[55:18] Bible and I had nothing to
[55:21] preach so I said now
[55:25] ahuh I might be
[55:29] going so at God's appointed
[55:33] time I have officially now come to say
[55:36] thank
[55:40] you God richly bless
[55:43] you and thank you Dad so
[55:46] much
[55:53] amen God bless you
[55:59] you are welcome to the house of the
[56:03] Lord yeah
[56:07] um there was a
[56:10] time when Israel was
[56:14] invaded under the time of
[56:18] sa they had one many
[56:22] battles but there come up one battle
[56:28] and in this
[56:30] battle the
[56:33] general was a man of
[56:37] war and he was a
[56:40] giant his name was called
[56:43] gor his voice was of like a
[56:49] trumpet he say will
[56:53] come and begin War over the field
[56:58] and then sa would
[57:03] sink all the other men of
[57:07] War would
[57:09] sink and the man challenged
[57:12] them for a period of one
[57:15] week and over that one
[57:17] week he was gaining more
[57:21] ground amen he was taking more
[57:24] land and now he would Shout
[57:28] again Israel would back
[57:31] up but one
[57:35] time there was a father called
[57:38] Jess he had Sons on the
[57:43] battlefield and he felt for
[57:47] them he called his son
[57:51] David from the grazing
[57:54] field to take food
[57:57] for his
[57:58] Brethren so he took the
[58:01] food he came to the I mean to the
[58:04] battlefield and now his big
[58:10] [Music]
[58:12] brother said this is Dangerous
[58:16] Ground you now run back
[58:20] home and David from this
[58:23] angle came to this angle
[58:27] and he was hiding among the
[58:29] people and he was asking who is this
[58:32] circumcised
[58:34] Philistine who is challenging the
[58:37] people then sees him we told you to go
[58:41] back home he says okay okay he
[58:44] disappears from there he comes there and
[58:48] now the story went through the
[58:52] battlefield that there is a young man
[58:56] who has got a
[58:58] testimony amen that he killed a
[59:02] bear he killed a lion with his bare
[59:06] hands and he say who is this
[59:10] uncircumcised
[59:12] Philistine who challenging the armies of
[59:16] God they didn't call them the armies of
[59:20] Israel the armies of God do you know we
[59:23] are armies of God here oh my amen we are
[59:29] not the armies of the ginger
[59:33] Tabernacle but we are the armies of
[59:36] God Amen so the word goes around
[59:43] soul and so for I mean
[59:49] for David told him his
[59:52] testimony he told him now that's very
[59:56] good you know when you go to
[59:59] war you you you have to put on the
[1:00:04] armor and then
[1:00:06] Saul stood sh above every
[1:00:12] man and then David was just but a little
[1:00:16] boy and when he tried those
[1:00:20] Amazon he said these are too big for
[1:00:23] me we believe in a god
[1:00:26] who doesn't give
[1:00:28] Victory to big
[1:00:30] numbers because there are too many they
[1:00:33] might said this is our arm I mean our
[1:00:36] strength which has given us the
[1:00:40] victory you remember in the time of
[1:00:43] jidon God said no these men are too
[1:00:47] many and so he took them on the final
[1:00:51] examination on how to drink the
[1:00:54] water and then remained with about 300
[1:00:58] people are you together with me so it's
[1:01:01] the same way with this little
[1:01:04] Dev he threw off these
[1:01:07] armor and he didn't need a
[1:01:10] spear he need need nothing he came in
[1:01:14] his own
[1:01:16] way the god way he picked five little
[1:01:21] Stone to a man of
[1:01:24] war praise God
[1:01:26] and when David started to
[1:01:29] advance man started you come to me like
[1:01:32] a
[1:01:34] dog and then David started
[1:01:37] swinging one time two times three times
[1:01:43] five times he released the
[1:01:47] stor and the only spot where go had
[1:01:53] left so that his face could bre
[1:01:58] through that's where the stone
[1:02:01] went
[1:02:02] once and he was
[1:02:05] down
[1:02:07] listen the
[1:02:09] warrior was just a
[1:02:12] child hallelujah hallelujah and today

[1:02:22] child amen amen praise the Lord
[1:02:26] the Lord knows how to use his
[1:02:29] people he's a university
[1:02:32] student and then some people invited him
[1:02:36] here he knew our
[1:02:39] brother and the brother told me I've got

[1:19:13] Bible
[1:19:15] days they never such a deeper
[1:19:18] Revelation to know that it was a

[1:19:25] while the Believers were praying for him
[1:19:28] Peter appeared before them and they said
[1:19:31] no it might it must be an angel of
[1:19:35] Peter amen they thought they called

[1:21:09] names amen so I came last
[1:21:14] week and uh we passed through
[1:21:17] Ginger it seems the Lord wanted me to
[1:21:20] deal with the Eastern side of
[1:21:25] because again we are
[1:21:28] back I went back to cala so I travel
[1:21:32] back
[1:21:33] toia and then now I'm back
[1:21:41] again amen
[1:21:43] so uh the Lord helped
[1:21:46] us uh people believe the
[1:21:50] message amen that's the greatest story
[1:21:52] we can ever tell
[1:21:55] that's the greatest testimony we can
[1:21:57] ever
[1:21:58] give is when a
[1:22:01] sinner come back to his
[1:22:04] maker amen so some Souls were
[1:22:09] baptized I participated in the the
[1:22:12] baptizing of those
[1:22:14] SS Amen in in the first day uh the in
[1:22:20] one service in one one one meeting
[1:22:24] 30 were
[1:22:26] baptized amen and the lord gave us
[1:22:30] Grace
[1:22:32] to but even some Pentecostal
[1:22:37] pastors realize that there's a
[1:22:40] message hallelujah hallelujah and they
[1:22:43] gladly receive the
[1:22:45] word amen just like with the Gentiles
[1:22:48] when the message came from
[1:22:52] Israel we gentle people received it
[1:22:57] gladly and so did
[1:23:00] they amen and by God's
[1:23:04] grace even a new church was
[1:23:08] planted
[1:23:12] amen uh our
[1:23:15] Ministries have been given in different
[1:23:18] kinds yet The Same
[1:23:20] Spirit one is called to be a pastor
[1:23:24] the other one is called to be an
[1:23:26] evangelist some are called to be
[1:23:30] Apostles others
[1:23:32] prophets amen all for the glory of
[1:23:36] God I'm not M of anything
[1:23:40] else I just fit whever the Lord wants me
[1:23:43] to
[1:23:46] be Amen in my walk with God in my walk
[1:23:50] with
[1:23:51] god I've always desired to see people
[1:23:54] people repent and come to the
[1:23:57] Lord amen I think at a very tender
[1:24:02] age I think near that age of my
[1:24:06] brother because I'm I'm a bit I'm a bit
[1:24:10] older than you see
[1:24:13] me my body is always smaller than my
[1:24:18] age amen so I started
[1:24:22] evangelizing when I was a very young
[1:24:25] boy amen and that has been my
[1:24:29] life know that I've never failed the
[1:24:32] Lord I feel the Lord every
[1:24:37] day
[1:24:39] amen do we have young people
[1:24:42] here because the devil tell you no
[1:24:45] you're
[1:24:47] bad look at that young brother he's
[1:24:51] doing that and that but you a bad boy
[1:24:56] tell the devil we all make
[1:24:59] mistakes but a warrior is one who
[1:25:03] Rises amen so in my work with Christ
[1:25:08] that's when I just
[1:25:10] began but I I used to be a local
[1:25:16] Evangelist amen I did much evangelism in
[1:25:20] my primary school secondary
[1:25:23] school and when I left my secondary
[1:25:27] school I went where there was no
[1:25:30] message and after staying there there's
[1:25:33] a message uh there are message Believers
[1:25:39] now amen that was in
[1:25:43] 2018 amen
[1:25:46] 2018 that's the first time the Lord used
[1:25:49] me to do something really for the
[1:25:51] message where people would believe the
[1:25:53] message
[1:25:58] and that was a first
[1:26:00] church amen and from there the Lord has
[1:26:03] made me move place to
[1:26:06] place amen until he spoke to me
[1:26:10] again to go to an area where there was
[1:26:13] no
[1:26:14] message and the Lord did something
[1:26:16] wonderful there
[1:26:18] also and there's a
[1:26:20] church so when I came brother JY never
[1:26:26] knew but I'm also a
[1:26:29] pastor amen because I never told
[1:26:33] him the reason I never told him because
[1:26:37] I don't feel that call upon my life I
[1:26:40] don't feel the call of a pass upon my
[1:26:43] life so after the church came to a
[1:26:47] certain
[1:26:49] level there are other men of God who
[1:26:51] took
[1:26:52] up amen
[1:26:55] and uh the nature of my
[1:26:59] Ministry I rarely sit in one
[1:27:02] place
[1:27:05] amen yeah so you can see the design of
[1:27:08] my
[1:27:10] Ministry yeah I I
[1:27:13] travel that's my
[1:27:15] nature but we haven't yet orain the
[1:27:20] pastors so but I don't call myself one
[1:27:26] I don't call myself a
[1:27:28] pastor it's not in my
[1:27:30] call maybe the Lord one day will call me
[1:27:33] to be a
[1:27:36] pastor but he hasn't called me yet so I
[1:27:40] believe the Lord will help you this
[1:27:43] morning because it's not about a
[1:27:47] man hallelujah hallelujah there's a
[1:27:50] reason why I did what I've done because
[1:27:53] you don't
[1:27:56] me that's why the apostles would write
[1:27:58] in their
[1:28:00] letters when they writing to the
[1:28:02] churches in
[1:28:05] galtia in
[1:28:07] thessalonica they say Paul the Apostle
[1:28:10] of
[1:28:12] God Peter the Apostle of
[1:28:15] God he needed to introduce who he is in
[1:28:18] the body
[1:28:20] ofr hallelujah hallelujah so that people
[1:28:23] can have confidence confidence in
[1:28:25] him amen and because of work of the
[1:28:32] Lord he has added an extra
[1:28:36] Grace the grace of
[1:28:38] healing designment of
[1:28:41] spirits and a prophetic
[1:28:45] gift amen so I'm very sure by the time
[1:28:48] you go out of this
[1:28:50] place if you are sick you realize
[1:28:54] sickness will have left
[1:28:56] you amen because when I'm standing
[1:29:01] here healing becomes natural
[1:29:06] there Amen in every service I've
[1:29:10] preached in every service I've
[1:29:14] preached I've seen people come to church
[1:29:17] with
[1:29:20] medicine because in case the devil
[1:29:23] catches them all their
[1:29:27] Church they will take this
[1:29:29] medicine and while I'm preaching like
[1:29:32] this the presence of God will come
[1:29:36] down and they just find themselves they
[1:29:39] healed hallelujah hallelujah amen so you
[1:29:44] believe with your
[1:29:45] heart and God will touch you whever you
[1:29:49] are one thing I know you shall never be
[1:29:52] the same
[1:29:54] because you're in the presence of
[1:29:56] God hallelujah
[1:29:58] hallelujah uh we can stand on our
[1:30:09] feet you forgive
[1:30:12] me I'm not I'm not a good
[1:30:18] speaker
[1:30:20] yeah but uh you have to make sense to
[1:30:24] everything
[1:30:27] amen you know when you
[1:30:31] young you don't hold the spear very
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:36] well you hold
[1:30:40] shivering so but thank God even if the
[1:30:43] stone you know even if David threw the
[1:30:45] stone and it went to the other
[1:30:49] side because God was determined to bring
[1:30:52] Goliath down
[1:30:55] Stone would have still gone back to
[1:31:00] go Hallelujah huj so the stone will
[1:31:03] still come back to your
[1:31:06] problem hallelujah hallelujah I will
[1:31:09] open in the
[1:31:11] Bible in the book of
[1:31:16] Ephesians Ephesians 4 verse
[1:31:22] 4 the Bible
[1:31:25] says there is one
[1:31:27] body and one
[1:31:30] Spirit even as ye are called in one hope
[1:31:34] of your
[1:31:41] calling one Lord One Faith one
[1:31:47] baptism one God and Father of
[1:31:52] all who is above
[1:31:55] all and through all and you know all but
[1:32:00] un every one of us is given Grace
[1:32:03] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:32:10] Christ wherefore he said when he
[1:32:12] ascended up on
[1:32:15] high he led captivity captive
[1:32:25] and gave gifts unto
[1:32:28] men hallelujah hallelujah and then on
[1:32:31] verse
[1:32:32] 11 and he gave some
[1:32:39] Apostles and some
[1:32:41] prophets some
[1:32:43] evangelists some
[1:32:46] pastors and
[1:32:47] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:32:51] Saints for the work of the ministry
[1:32:55] for the edifying of the body of
[1:32:58] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[1:33:00] the
[1:33:03] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:33:07] God unto a perfect
[1:33:13] man and to the measure of the St of the
[1:33:16] fullness of
[1:33:21] Christ that we have be no more
[1:33:27] children toss to and fro and carried
[1:33:29] about with every wind of
[1:33:36] Doctrine by the S of men and canning
[1:33:42] craft whereby they lie in way to
[1:33:46] deceive whereby they lie in way to
[1:33:49] deceive
[1:33:56] but speaking in the truth in
[1:33:59] love may grow
[1:34:02] up into him all in all
[1:34:06] things which is the
[1:34:08] head even Christ from from whom the
[1:34:13] whole body fitly joined
[1:34:18] together and compacted by that which
[1:34:21] every joint surly
[1:34:26] according to the effectual working in
[1:34:28] the measure of every
[1:34:33] part maketh increase of the body unto
[1:34:36] theing of itself in
[1:34:42] love amen God bless you you may be
[1:34:47] seated amen
[1:34:51] amen uh you when go
[1:34:58] willing uh I'll be back in
[1:35:03] December to the same place
[1:35:06] amen uh there are many Pentecostal
[1:35:09] pastors who would want to to
[1:35:16] hear so we are trying to organize a
[1:35:19] meeting with
[1:35:22] them and we expect more than 300 of them
[1:35:26] to attend actually even 600 but the list
[1:35:29] is
[1:35:36] 200 amen we had a wonderful time with
[1:35:39] the
[1:35:42] Elder uh you know by Nature I don't know
[1:35:46] if I talk a lot
[1:35:49] but by Nature I observe
[1:35:54] I like to I pay attention and
[1:35:59] observe so I observe everything when I
[1:36:02] visit a
[1:36:04] place H the Elder is very
[1:36:09] sound is very
[1:36:11] sound and I'm very sure you must be you
[1:36:15] must have been
[1:36:17] enjoying amen uh yeah you can do that
[1:36:21] please you can
[1:36:28] and you see one thing I
[1:36:32] saw uh we have to grow to
[1:36:36] maturity amen and this is how this is
[1:36:40] the example God has given
[1:36:43] us the
[1:36:45] message everyone can try to explain the
[1:36:49] message in accordance to how God has
[1:36:51] shown them
[1:36:54] but uh the point of
[1:36:57] it is we must come to
[1:37:01] maturity you know when one
[1:37:04] matures the greatest thing that comes is
[1:37:09] understanding amen I think what to
[1:37:12] differentiate a child from an old man or
[1:37:16] a child from a big person the
[1:37:21] difference is also in understanding of
[1:37:24] things amen I might not really explain
[1:37:30] fully but uh we need people like
[1:37:34] him especially in this
[1:37:37] time you see it's not everything that is
[1:37:41] the
[1:37:43] message many things accompan the
[1:37:47] message the message is the revelation of
[1:37:50] the word
[1:37:53] and no man can teach you a
[1:37:58] revelation Christ himself the father
[1:38:01] reveals it in your
[1:38:03] heart and that no man can
[1:38:07] explain no one can explain you in and
[1:38:10] can explain you
[1:38:13] out it's between the lines of
[1:38:17] Simons hallelujah hallelujah so may God
[1:38:21] bless you Elder
[1:38:23] uh I've always wanted to meet people who
[1:38:25] speak like
[1:38:29] you you see again
[1:38:32] maturity people think you're a
[1:38:37] compromiser when you have matur
[1:38:40] really people think you a
[1:38:45] compromiser imagine Paul telling Paul
[1:38:47] telling
[1:38:49] Timothy say don't just be drinking water
[1:38:54] by be taking some
[1:38:56] wine because of your stomach
[1:39:03] problem imagine that the
[1:39:07] Apostle and people be like this man is a
[1:39:11] compromiser but you see you you
[1:39:14] grow and understand what salvation
[1:39:18] is hallelujah hallelujah there are many
[1:39:21] times I remember brother Brenham took
[1:39:23] cigarettes so that man was dying in
[1:39:30] hospital he was not trying that
[1:39:38] man he was not trying that
[1:39:41] man he meant taking cigarettes
[1:39:45] there because he realized the body
[1:39:47] needed
[1:39:49] that that body was addicted to that
[1:39:53] is still working on
[1:39:55] him he needed
[1:39:58] that oh brother this
[1:40:00] message that's why we have so many many
[1:40:05] doctrines but as we
[1:40:07] grow we are getting to the
[1:40:10] maturity to understand
[1:40:13] better hallelujah hallelujah you see we
[1:40:17] become hard on one
[1:40:21] another there are many times
[1:40:24] Apostle Paul repented in the
[1:40:29] Bible one day he excommunicated a
[1:40:33] brother who slept with the concubine of
[1:40:36] his
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:39] father if you read in the first letter
[1:40:42] the book The Letter to the
[1:40:46] Corinthians and he said many bad things
[1:40:50] there say that that one should not even
[1:40:53] supposed you shouldn't don't even be
[1:40:55] found with him cast him
[1:40:59] out and then in the second
[1:41:02] letter he repents he say we were not
[1:41:06] supposed to be hard on
[1:41:09] him
[1:41:11] amen are you here we were not supposed
[1:41:15] to be hard on
[1:41:16] him such a
[1:41:18] one bring him close perhaps the enemy
[1:41:23] may take advantage of
[1:41:26] him uh Christ is trying to build his
[1:41:28] church into
[1:41:31] love that's why the the last
[1:41:35] step is love you can have faith you can
[1:41:39] have knowledge can have virtue you can
[1:41:43] have Temperance can have brotherly
[1:41:45] kindness but above all
[1:41:49] that you must be kept in
[1:41:51] love because this is is a love
[1:41:54] story that Christ left the
[1:41:57] throne and became a
[1:42:00] man that through him we can have
[1:42:04] salvation that's why Paul at the end of
[1:42:07] it all he said bear one with
[1:42:12] another hallelujah hallelujah bear one
[1:42:15] with
[1:42:16] another to
[1:42:18] Bear brother is so
[1:42:21] hard if I give this Bible say bear for
[1:42:25] me
[1:42:27] brother when you just get it in the
[1:42:30] first one
[1:42:32] hour this Bible be very
[1:42:35] light but as you it for five
[1:42:39] days the Bible become as holding the
[1:42:42] whole building on
[1:42:48] your you're holding the whole
[1:42:51] building very heavy
[1:42:54] and that's what bearing
[1:42:56] is you can bear with a
[1:42:59] brother but for how long are you going
[1:43:03] to bear that proves your love for
[1:43:08] the hallelujah hallelujah there's
[1:43:11] something brother bam was
[1:43:13] attaining in all his
[1:43:16] sermons God sent him to build back the
[1:43:18] image of
[1:43:20] God that image that can bear with
[1:43:24] us hallelujah hallelujah God so much
[1:43:27] bears with
[1:43:30] us we ourselves are not even worthy of
[1:43:33] his
[1:43:36] meres because he can
[1:43:38] bear hallelujah hallelujah are we
[1:43:42] together uh there's something very
[1:43:45] important that we must understand as we
[1:43:49] move from Perfection to perfection
[1:43:53] God wants us to move to a certain
[1:43:56] level hallelujah hallelujah and that
[1:43:58] level is the level where he
[1:44:01] is be
[1:44:04] perfect even as your father is
[1:44:06] perfect but remember you can never be
[1:44:10] perfect without
[1:44:12] love hallelujah hallelujah the only
[1:44:15] thing that will make you see no mistake
[1:44:17] in your
[1:44:20] brother is when you come in perfect love
[1:44:24] because where there is love

[1:50:49] gifts must work in harmony
[1:50:54] to bring this body
[1:50:57] again hallelujah hallelujah and you know
[1:50:59] the problem we have
[1:51:01] today is that we all want to be one
[1:51:07] part of the body of
[1:51:11] Christ we all want to be the
[1:51:15] leg and if a brother tries to say no
[1:51:18] brother me I'm a
[1:51:21] hand with feel like the
[1:51:25] outcast but you see Paul
[1:51:29] says there's one body and many
[1:51:34] parts all these parts they carry out and
[1:51:37] help you to do your daytoday
[1:51:42] work just because you're
[1:51:45] eating
[1:51:48] and it doesn't mean you don't need your
[1:51:50] your legs
[1:51:55] at every appointed
[1:51:58] time each part of your body be
[1:52:04] important they are very essential body
[1:52:08] parts that you don't even
[1:52:11] see that you don't even
[1:52:14] see but they are very important in your
[1:52:17] body and if you are to remove them
[1:52:21] brother you not even leave for 2
[1:52:24] minutes we can remove your
[1:52:27] eyes but when we remove your
[1:52:30] heart that's your
[1:52:33] end we can remove your
[1:52:36] leg but if we remove your LS that's your
[1:52:40] end yet the only visible thing we
[1:52:43] see and we appreciate so much we
[1:52:47] appreciate our legs we appreciate our
[1:52:49] hands we appreciate our ears and we
[1:52:53] don't appreciate the heart we don't
[1:52:56] appreciate the intestines we don't
[1:52:58] appreciate the other parts just because
[1:53:01] we don't see
[1:53:03] them hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we
[1:53:06] don't appreciate one
[1:53:08] another in the body of
[1:53:14] Christ just because those other parts
[1:53:16] are not
[1:53:19] seen there must be an evangelist
[1:53:24] who must go out there to take that
[1:53:27] sinner to bring him to Christ and for
[1:53:30] that
[1:53:31] sinner it's not just enough to be born
[1:53:35] again no if you were just
[1:53:39] born you the
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:42] baby would you have achieved what you
[1:53:44] have
[1:53:46] achieved there was need for
[1:53:50] growth hallelujah hallelujah remember
[1:53:52] God is our
[1:53:55] father he is in charge of our
[1:54:00] growth he's in charge of
[1:54:03] our and he moves us from one human
[1:54:08] being to another human
[1:54:12] being just like when a child is
[1:54:15] born the prophet talks about
[1:54:18] leadership the child be the leadership
[1:54:21] of a man
[1:54:23] until a certain stage and from that
[1:54:26] stage you come in the leadership of the
[1:54:29] Father the leadership of the father
[1:54:32] you'll be ushered in by into a
[1:54:35] teacher who will teach you the physical
[1:54:37] things of
[1:54:39] life you will not say no me I'm a
[1:54:42] Believer I don't need to do
[1:54:45] engineering you die
[1:54:47] wither and go to
[1:54:50] heaven Hallelujah Hallelujah you must
[1:54:53] understand the physical
[1:54:56] part because you're not just a
[1:54:58] spirit you need to dress you not John
[1:55:02] the
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:06] Baptist hallelujah hallelujah you're not
[1:55:09] John the Baptist understand your
[1:55:12] purpose and you're not Jesus the Christ
[1:55:15] flesh that's Jesus of Na you not that
[1:55:20] one you you are you
[1:55:24] so if you neglect you neglect your
[1:55:29] part you die
[1:55:32] ear and you know what we run to heaven
[1:55:35] heaven is not even where we are supposed
[1:55:37] to
[1:55:39] be God created us to be
[1:55:44] here
[1:55:45] amen this is where he wanted us to
[1:55:48] be just a sin came and Confused the
[1:55:51] whole thing
[1:55:53] and this is why God sent a
[1:55:56] Ministry to do to bring back theen
[1:56:01] again the condition so that we can dwell
[1:56:05] now here
[1:56:09] ET but we all run to
[1:56:12] heaven and when we reach heaven under
[1:56:14] the alt we cry for how long are we going
[1:56:16] to be father
[1:56:23] because we are not meant to be
[1:56:25] there hallelujah hallelujah meant to
[1:56:31] eat amen and and now we have people who
[1:56:35] want to fast 40 days and 40
[1:56:41] nights why are you competing with
[1:56:46] Jesus Brothers you see you must know
[1:56:49] your will
[1:56:52] the prophet say you just lose all your
[1:56:57] teeth you lose your
[1:57:00] teeth Jesus fasted all those days
[1:57:04] because he was supposed to meet
[1:57:06] [Applause]
[1:57:08] death he was caring the burden of the
[1:57:11] whole
[1:57:12] rest including the first Adam's burden
[1:57:15] was upon
[1:57:18] him but we want also to you see we we
[1:57:21] shouldn't be like
[1:57:23] Pentecost Pentecost are
[1:57:29] noices when they just he this one fasted
[1:57:31] for 500 times they go do
[1:57:37] that our Prophet just fasted the highest
[1:57:40] was three
[1:57:43] days because you see you can't cause you
[1:57:46] can't force an angel to visit
[1:57:50] you and that's a problem
[1:57:53] we want to have a supernatural encounter
[1:57:55] like of Paul of Peter you walk in your
[1:58:00] destiny and if your purpose is raised
[1:58:02] for that will send an
[1:58:07] angel hallelujah
[1:58:11] hallelujah and we have so many
[1:58:14] people who are going up anywhere
[1:58:18] anything they have lost their
[1:58:20] way that's God has sent us a
[1:58:23] Ministry and the ministry is not one
[1:58:27] man all of
[1:58:29] us Grace is
[1:58:32] given in accordance to the gift of
[1:58:34] Christ in
[1:58:37] us hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:58:42] amen you know
[1:58:45] what the the Apostle says but unto
[1:58:49] everyone of us is given Grace according
[1:58:51] to the measure
[1:58:56] now you
[1:58:58] see the issue of it is that all people
[1:59:00] want to have a high
[1:59:04] calling all people want to have a high
[1:59:07] measure of the gift of
[1:59:11] Christ all people want to become the
[1:59:15] hand you can never be except he makes
[1:59:19] you be
[1:59:22] if I come here and I want to do it like
[1:59:25] the
[1:59:26] pastor I'll not help
[1:59:29] you amen if I come here and I want to do
[1:59:32] it like my
[1:59:34] brother I not help you I must come here
[1:59:39] and do it according to the purpose he
[1:59:41] has placed over my
[1:59:44] life it's not how much you
[1:59:48] fast no it's in accordance to your
[1:59:54] purpose I want to help you brother
[1:59:57] because you will
[2:00:01] St starting just to see a
[2:00:07] vision which is not in your
[2:00:10] purpose first thing I want to see a
[2:00:13] vision yet the whole Bible is full of
[2:00:17] vision you want to see a
[2:00:19] vision you see there's a problem with
[2:00:23] you are not t
[2:00:25] right hallelujah
[2:00:29] hallelujah let me tell you
[2:00:31] something it's not
[2:00:33] fasting that brought the Holy Ghost on
[2:00:35] the day of
[2:00:40] Pentecost it is not
[2:00:42] fasting that made the angel appear
[2:00:45] before
[2:00:47] Cornus no just at the angel found him
[2:00:52] while maybe he was
[2:00:54] praying but some people the angel found
[2:00:56] them while they even doing their own
[2:00:58] activities like
[2:01:08] Moses and
[2:01:11] boom what's what's
[2:01:14] happening why because it's the Plan of
[2:01:17] Redemption belongs to
[2:01:20] God it's not your
[2:01:23] prayers it's not your
[2:01:26] prayers Lord use me
[2:01:28] uh-uh if God wants to use
[2:01:31] you even when you're in a b even when
[2:01:35] you're in a
[2:01:38] b you just
[2:01:43] he maybe it cannot be so Supernatural
[2:01:46] like
[2:01:47] this but you speak to
[2:01:50] you somehow you find yourself you're out
[2:01:53] of that
[2:01:54] life because he has a purpose for
[2:01:58] you no man has ever s
[2:02:03] God God
[2:02:07] himself it's only when he wants
[2:02:11] to go in the Bible you never see where
[2:02:14] an angel appeared because a man wanted a
[2:02:16] visitation
[2:02:22] you never find such whenever God sent an
[2:02:26] angel it was because a
[2:02:30] prophecy was about to be
[2:02:32] fulfilled some people they say Daniel
[2:02:36] fasted for 21 days and the angels
[2:02:40] appeared let's be realistic did the
[2:02:43] Angels come from the Throne of God on
[2:02:46] the
[2:02:47] 2 25th day
[2:02:53] immediately began the
[2:02:58] firstest the prince of
[2:03:02] TI whichever but we know it's a
[2:03:05] devil healed the angel with the
[2:03:08] message it's not the prayer of Daniel
[2:03:11] that that that energized the the
[2:03:17] Angel God saw was needing for the angel
[2:03:20] to be delivered
[2:03:23] he released the Angel
[2:03:25] Michael the angel of
[2:03:28] battles hallelujah hallelujah why
[2:03:32] because there was a Prophet by the
[2:03:34] Prophet Jeremiah to say the
[2:03:38] 7 in the
[2:03:42] 70th God was to deliver
[2:03:45] them hallelujah hallelujah you must know
[2:03:49] what is written about your life
[2:03:53] what gave the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:56] Authority was not because of 4 days
[2:04:02] ands the prophet say he knew his
[2:04:04] scriptural
[2:04:07] position he knew the hour and
[2:04:10] season he knew where he was
[2:04:13] standing and this is what to give us
[2:04:15] victory over the kingdom of
[2:04:19] darkness is to know the hour we are
[2:04:21] living
[2:04:22] in the Bible say in the evening
[2:04:25] time it shall be light Hallelujah God is
[2:04:30] going to call out a
[2:04:32] bride because God cannot do without a
[2:04:35] man you call a
[2:04:38] man hallelujah hallelujah it's not
[2:04:40] because I'm
[2:04:41] praying when we are
[2:04:44] born God raise us
[2:04:47] up we don't receive gifts now receive a
[2:04:50] spiritual gift which which gift are you
[2:04:53] me there's a gift that you are born
[2:04:57] with
[2:04:59] amen and it's not because you're
[2:05:02] praying you know I've been with
[2:05:06] brothers who they say brother I cannot
[2:05:09] preach I haven't prayed I haven't
[2:05:14] prayed uhuh when you put your youro on
[2:05:20] prayer say I just have to do this after
[2:05:23] I
[2:05:24] pray what about before there was prayer
[2:05:27] because prayer just came in recently in
[2:05:29] the Garden of Eden there was no prayer
[2:05:35] Point were they having prayer point in
[2:05:38] the Garden of
[2:05:41] Eden so let's pray about
[2:05:45] this no
[2:05:49] brother no and if you go to
[2:05:54] battle because you have a spear of
[2:05:58] prayer you not overcome
[2:06:01] go your hope must be on the
[2:06:05] word because he
[2:06:08] promised he can never
[2:06:10] fail hallelujah hallelujah I've often
[2:06:14] wondered there are times when you know
[2:06:17] some time
[2:06:18] ago I would go among his brothers
[2:06:21] brothers would pray maybe I found them
[2:06:24] they have been praying for
[2:06:26] days me the very day I start praying
[2:06:30] that same day I begin to pray with
[2:06:33] them I begin to erupt into
[2:06:36] visions and now they want to see Visions
[2:06:40] also you see you can
[2:06:43] never be what God has never called you
[2:06:47] to
[2:06:50] be John the
[2:06:52] bti never did any
[2:06:56] Miracle which was John the Baptist
[2:06:58] Healing The
[2:07:02] Sick he never did any
[2:07:05] Miracle but he the greatest commission
[2:07:09] ever so are you you grasp my point I
[2:07:12] think so far
[2:07:16] youas what is Jesus trying to
[2:07:19] achieve is he trying to achieve to make
[2:07:22] you and I
[2:07:25] gifted why that could be a very poor
[2:07:29] reason he sent gifts teaching gifts
[2:07:34] Apostolic gifts gifts healing gifts
[2:07:38] Miracle gifts for what so that the
[2:07:42] church can have
[2:07:44] gifts no so that we through those
[2:07:49] operations can be rais
[2:07:52] to the image of the Son of
[2:07:55] God but look you can never go to heaven
[2:08:00] because you you know singing can never
[2:08:02] preach you into
[2:08:05] heaven but it's needed in
[2:08:09] church
[2:08:11] right
[2:08:13] healing can never take you to
[2:08:16] heaven but you need it while you're here
[2:08:22] spirits that bother
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:26] you must meet a certain gift
[2:08:30] also because sometimes you can be seated
[2:08:32] in
[2:08:33] church you hear the word of God say stop
[2:08:37] this and you even
[2:08:40] know but you you go
[2:08:42] anyhow and continue living like that so
[2:08:47] there's need also God to say okay I'll
[2:08:48] send you a gift
[2:08:52] that will tell you your
[2:08:54] secrets so
[2:08:56] that at
[2:08:58] least you have some levels of fear for
[2:09:04] God you have some level of fear for
[2:09:08] God but you see that gift
[2:09:10] also can never take you to heaven
[2:09:14] because you realize that people begin to
[2:09:15] fear
[2:09:17] you more than they fear their God
[2:09:21] and they just see the brother
[2:09:24] coming they they go this other
[2:09:27] way they
[2:09:29] afraid of the
[2:09:31] brother then you realize that at the end
[2:09:33] of the
[2:09:35] day there's something
[2:09:38] real that must come to you to make you a
[2:09:42] new
[2:09:43] being and that's the word of
[2:09:46] God hallelujah hallelujah but you see
[2:09:50] not every of
[2:09:52] us is called to
[2:09:55] teach not everyone of us is called to
[2:10:00] evangelize not everyone of us is called
[2:10:02] to just
[2:10:04] help but we all put together makes the
[2:10:10] ministry of the Lord
[2:10:12] Jesus this is the reason we have to
[2:10:14] appreciate one
[2:10:16] another there's a sister can have a des
[2:10:19] just to sing
[2:10:22] let's say praise the Lord because that's
[2:10:25] the measure of the grace upon our
[2:10:29] life
[2:10:30] amen there are small parts in our body
[2:10:34] there are small parts on our
[2:10:36] body there are
[2:10:38] fingers that even if you
[2:10:40] remove you still be able if you remove
[2:10:43] this one you still be able to survive
[2:10:45] and touch
[2:10:49] things but you not be
[2:10:58] those who are married with you have a
[2:11:01] marriage
[2:11:02] ring you don't have this finger then
[2:11:05] you'll be like Oh Praise the
[2:11:09] Lord you have you're not dead you're
[2:11:12] alive but you not be
[2:11:16] beautiful but it's so
[2:11:19] useless add something on your
[2:11:23] there are certain gifts that we can
[2:11:27] have that may be so much useless to
[2:11:31] us say me I just dream
[2:11:34] dreams and those dreams sometimes they
[2:11:36] are not really
[2:11:39] direct and you go and fast for 50
[2:11:42] days so that you can know don't do
[2:11:46] that you just be a
[2:11:49] believer God himself knows where to
[2:11:53] position hallelujah hallelujah you
[2:11:55] remember the message
[2:11:57] adoption the prophet talks about some
[2:12:02] families some man can just be adopted to
[2:12:05] give birth to a
[2:12:11] preacher just to give birth to a
[2:12:13] preacher that's their position in
[2:12:17] Christ the adoption
[2:12:23] hallelujah hallelujah and that's the
[2:12:25] reason why you face what you
[2:12:28] face because sometimes we
[2:12:31] admire if only I was brother
[2:12:34] bham yet you're eating every
[2:12:38] day brother Ben was born they never had
[2:12:41] food you your food every day and then
[2:12:45] you're saying if only was brother
[2:12:47] Bram are you getting me
[2:13:04] I wish I was
[2:13:05] brother know Des not to be
[2:13:12] him we only want the good
[2:13:17] part and we forget what it is behind the
[2:13:20] back
[2:13:22] the difficult
[2:13:29] part let me tell you
[2:13:31] something there's a
[2:13:34] time that when you are called to
[2:13:38] preach I wish I never
[2:13:46] started it's only when you're not
[2:13:48] working in your purose that's when
[2:13:49] things become easy because you don't
[2:13:51] have the devil in that
[2:13:57] lane because the lane is so clear
[2:13:59] there's no devil to
[2:14:04] interrupt oh brother but when you walk
[2:14:06] in your
[2:14:08] purpose you understand that oh God I
[2:14:11] never I never never came
[2:14:17] here that's the reason men of God ran
[2:14:20] away
[2:14:23] no one will force you to F if you're a
[2:14:25] man of
[2:14:29] God appetite you know when to and when
[2:14:33] not to
[2:14:34] come appetite you know when to and when
[2:14:36] not to
[2:14:40] come you know some Believers be like
[2:14:43] brother are you excited you know when
[2:14:44] they see you travel from place to place
[2:14:46] country to Country they feel like oh
[2:14:48] it's an exciting thing
[2:14:57] know when I was coming to
[2:14:58] Uganda I met a brother by the
[2:15:02] mall then he he thought I didn't know
[2:15:05] him then when I greeted him was very
[2:15:09] excited then he was like brother when
[2:15:11] are you going
[2:15:13] out you know they want even to follow
[2:15:16] when are you going out good then I said
[2:15:19] I'm going on this state
[2:15:22] how how you
[2:15:24] feeling like you know like it's exciting
[2:15:28] right then I said no brother it's not
[2:15:33] exciting I've never been
[2:15:37] excited to
[2:15:39] travel in all places I've
[2:15:42] gone I'm always very
[2:15:46] sober I was telling brother
[2:15:48] jofrey there's no wor
[2:15:52] soldier who goes on aatt
[2:16:01] excited oh today we are fighting with
[2:16:08] America
[2:16:12] know this is what I was waiting
[2:16:16] for this is what I was waiting for
[2:16:19] America you know
[2:16:22] even
[2:16:24] footballers as much as it is exciting
[2:16:26] for you outside
[2:16:29] watching oh ronal it's not exciting with
[2:16:34] Ronald because if it was exciting have
[2:16:37] been sming the
[2:16:45] whole but the whole much
[2:16:52] and when they capture
[2:16:55] them even the celebration they never
[2:16:58] expected the
[2:17:03] go it's very
[2:17:05] different when you begin to walk in your
[2:17:09] purpose I was telling brother
[2:17:12] jofrey I used to be a very fire preacher
[2:17:16] I used to be a very fire
[2:17:19] preacher be
[2:17:24] people used to enjoy
[2:17:26] that but God took that
[2:17:30] away when I begin to walk in my
[2:17:34] purpose hallelujah hallelujah God will
[2:17:38] make you
[2:17:40] weak when you trust in your
[2:17:43] chariots when you trust in your
[2:17:46] chariots you have pained your
[2:17:49] chariots this is the chariot that we use
[2:17:52] today to
[2:17:54] fight and it's all
[2:17:58] tinted a very welled Ministry shall do
[2:18:04] less that's why God to put some dance on
[2:18:10] it hallelujah hallelujah and people
[2:18:14] don't understand the point on the man of
[2:18:17] God that mistake that is God putting the
[2:18:21] on
[2:18:23] it so that you shouldn't trust your
[2:18:27] chariot hallelujah hallelujah
[2:18:32] strange it's strange right but that's
[2:18:35] how God works when Paul has elevated so
[2:18:39] much with abundances of
[2:18:43] Revelations a th was given also to
[2:18:49] him accom a great
[2:18:54] ministry great
[2:19:00] ministry to Humble you so that you
[2:19:03] shouldn't trust in the tinted of your
[2:19:08] ministry put your confidence in him who
[2:19:11] started
[2:19:13] the hallelujah hallelujah and many times
[2:19:17] we have those tinted parts of our body
[2:19:26] because we feel we need to have this for
[2:19:28] us to do
[2:19:31] this and God remov the this that you
[2:19:33] wanted to do for
[2:19:36] that he say today I'll meet
[2:19:40] es he sent his
[2:19:43] family and remained
[2:19:46] alone I don't know maybe wanted to
[2:19:48] change
[2:19:51] [Music]
[2:19:57] and some
[2:19:58] Spears and met the angel of
[2:20:01] God hallelujah hallelujah how
[2:20:06] opposite instead of the Angel to give
[2:20:08] him
[2:20:10] muscles hit him on the
[2:20:12] hip and he went liing for
[2:20:16] war God will weaken
[2:20:19] you so you shouldn't trust in your
[2:20:24] ability God is determined to bring forth
[2:20:26] a
[2:20:28] bride behold I saw heaven
[2:20:31] open and there's much much noise in
[2:20:35] heaven and the Bride made herself ready
[2:20:39] there going to be a bride in
[2:20:41] now it's not because they are power of
[2:20:45] preachers but it is because God said
[2:20:48] so Le you must walk your
[2:20:52] purpose how that God is so much in
[2:20:55] special
[2:20:57] way when a man is called in their first
[2:21:01] calling they become so much
[2:21:04] powerful in their second phase they
[2:21:07] become so
[2:21:09] powerful in their third
[2:21:11] phas they become so
[2:21:14] weak and that was the ministry of our
[2:21:16] prophet in the first pool
[2:21:20] powerful
[2:21:22] Ministry physically
[2:21:25] speaking but the most power
[2:21:28] time was when it seemed as though the
[2:21:30] message was about
[2:21:34] defeated Hallelujah Hall it's in those
[2:21:37] moments when we feel we about to be
[2:21:42] defeated then Jesus
[2:21:44] comes hallelujah hallelujah when we feel
[2:21:47] we are now about to give up
[2:21:51] then Jesus
[2:21:52] comes Hallelujah huah the are many times
[2:21:55] that we have fought throughout
[2:21:58] ourselves we have organized
[2:22:01] Crusades we have we have entered into
[2:22:06] evangelism but it has never
[2:22:10] worked but there's a time when Jesus
[2:22:12] comes and when he comes you don't even
[2:22:16] go out to speak to them people begin to
[2:22:19] have dreams
[2:22:20] of the truth hallelujah hallelujah you
[2:22:24] know I went to I was preaching in a
[2:22:25] certain place in Zimbabwe
[2:22:29] in and uh when I entered the
[2:22:32] Tabernacle the Lord had showed
[2:22:34] me these
[2:22:36] brothers uh they're having
[2:22:39] challenges amen and uh in my
[2:22:43] preaching the Holy Spirit spoke
[2:22:47] spoke it's not about the crus you've
[2:22:49] been trying to
[2:22:52] do or the
[2:22:56] evangelism no no no no no remember in
[2:23:01] the Bible
[2:23:02] days they never even had used to have
[2:23:06] big speakers put
[2:23:09] forth and some big
[2:23:13] screens it was a very humble
[2:23:16] way I think those who know brother
[2:23:18] jofrey
[2:23:20] see what God is doing
[2:23:23] in by one
[2:23:27] man oh that's how God works God works in
[2:23:31] Simplicity the Elder spoke about the
[2:23:34] Gideon
[2:23:36] part how
[2:23:39] G went with a big
[2:23:42] army so we going to fight
[2:23:45] today very big
[2:23:47] army but God is not in big numbers
[2:23:51] he said Chase others perhaps you think
[2:23:54] you think it's because we were
[2:23:57] energetic brother that was a very PA
[2:24:00] war did you see how jendes did
[2:24:05] it jendes jendes just did this to that
[2:24:10] guy and he fell down and he came
[2:24:15] B also H that
[2:24:18] giant it was not in numbers
[2:24:21] why because in this Plan of
[2:24:23] Redemption he has issued out Angels
[2:24:27] brother Hallelujah they that are with
[2:24:31] us are more than our
[2:24:33] enemies yet you can never see them with
[2:24:35] your eyes in the plan of God in Saving
[2:24:41] man it's Angel
[2:24:44] visitations but you cannot just see
[2:24:47] them hallelujah hallelujah and when
[2:24:49] brother jofrey stands there to
[2:24:52] preach the only thing people can see is
[2:24:56] one man but let me tell you something
[2:24:59] Elisha said when G's eyes were
[2:25:03] open saw thousands of
[2:25:07] Chariots round about
[2:25:09] Elisha it was God hiding himself in
[2:25:14] Simplicity and when we reach out there
[2:25:17] brother in
[2:25:19] simplicity you see that God will do
[2:25:21] greater
[2:25:22] things hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:25:26] hallelujah God can speak to the hearts
[2:25:29] of the
[2:25:31] people amen I remember one day I gave
[2:25:36] this I give this
[2:25:38] testimony somewhere
[2:25:40] else there was a young
[2:25:43] Minister he had this
[2:25:45] weakness and he prayed for many many
[2:25:48] many sometime
[2:25:50] almost maybe in two
[2:25:52] years and this weakness was not leaving
[2:25:56] him he was prayed for by different
[2:26:00] preachers but he used to follow me on
[2:26:02] social media
[2:26:05] Facebook here in Uganda you don't
[2:26:07] usually use
[2:26:09] Facebook back in our place Facebook is a
[2:26:12] thing and used to follow on social
[2:26:16] media and he could he he saw what the
[2:26:19] Lord was doing
[2:26:21] and he had a desire that we can meet one
[2:26:24] day but there was no time to
[2:26:27] meet and one night he was
[2:26:30] asleep and as he was
[2:26:34] sleeping he went into this
[2:26:37] dream he was in a meeting I was
[2:26:41] preaching and the spirit of the Lord
[2:26:43] came
[2:26:44] down and began to move among his
[2:26:48] people telling them their problem
[2:26:51] that was in the dream and then he was
[2:26:53] standing
[2:26:54] somewhere then he says brother in
[2:26:58] himself within his heart he says I also
[2:27:00] have this
[2:27:02] problem I'm sure it's the best
[2:27:05] time for me to be saved from this
[2:27:08] weakness and while he was speaking
[2:27:10] within
[2:27:11] himself the Holy Spirit called him
[2:27:14] out and in the dream I hugged him I
[2:27:19] hugged him
[2:27:25] and the spirit left
[2:27:27] him amen was in a
[2:27:30] dream the simplic of
[2:27:34] God God is so
[2:27:36] simple that he himself delivers his
[2:27:40] people it's maybe that night I even seed
[2:27:43] a lot who knows maybe that same night I
[2:27:47] sinned a lot
[2:27:50] but God was determined to save
[2:27:53] someone but he must use a
[2:27:56] body to speak to the person and God use
[2:28:00] any
[2:28:02] way
[2:28:03] possible to deliver you brother
[2:28:06] hallelujah hallelujah and when he woke
[2:28:10] up he remembered it was so real in the
[2:28:13] dream and that's how the brother was set
[2:28:17] free so God can visit you
[2:28:21] but you must know how God visits
[2:28:23] his he visits them in
[2:28:27] simplic was a brother who was sick this
[2:28:29] the same testimony I wonder why I've
[2:28:31] repeated them but this another one there
[2:28:35] was another brother who was seeking the
[2:28:38] hospital in a very bad
[2:28:44] shap amen and we prayed
[2:28:48] brother prayed and prayed
[2:28:51] but the first time I prayed for him the
[2:28:54] Lord showed me that this brother will be
[2:28:57] well and you go and
[2:29:00] preach but the disease
[2:29:04] continued and many many pastors around
[2:29:07] prayed for him including
[2:29:09] myself and whenever I visit him the Holy
[2:29:13] Spirit would always tell me he'll be
[2:29:15] fine but physically
[2:29:18] speaking uh he was not fine and now
[2:29:21] there was a day when the lord gave him a
[2:29:26] trans and in that
[2:29:28] trans here you saw brother Titus
[2:29:32] coming brother Titus was coming myself
[2:29:35] of
[2:29:37] course sorry to you of course I was
[2:29:41] trying to show him that it was you know
[2:29:43] I'm brother
[2:29:46] Titus amen and when I entered where
[2:29:50] was there was something that was
[2:29:52] bothering the
[2:29:54] brother and in the dream there was
[2:29:59] designment go
[2:30:01] home the same
[2:30:04] morning the Lord spoke to
[2:30:06] him that's a day he was discharged from
[2:30:09] the
[2:30:10] hospital let me tell you something the
[2:30:13] brother was very
[2:30:16] sick and even if he came out of the
[2:30:18] hospital
[2:30:20] he had alers right but within I don't
[2:30:25] know if it's two days
[2:30:28] or has
[2:30:31] disappeared and that same week he was
[2:30:35] invited in another SE to
[2:30:38] preach when God speaks to us he can come
[2:30:42] in
[2:30:43] Simplicity I realize one thing it's not
[2:30:47] by our power our mighty
[2:30:50] but it is by the spirit of God when the
[2:30:53] Lord is speaking to
[2:30:55] us I used to wonder why he was brother b
[2:30:58] a simple
[2:31:00] speaker you speak just speak like
[2:31:05] this I said
[2:31:07] brother you know like you have to preach
[2:31:10] it
[2:31:14] out and the Lord Jesus Christ used to be
[2:31:17] a very simple speaker
[2:31:20] you just speak like this and the Bible
[2:31:22] say you take a seat you even
[2:31:25] SE and begin to speak but as he speaking
[2:31:30] there was so much
[2:31:32] power hallelujah hallelujah let me the
[2:31:35] power is not how loud our voices
[2:31:39] can Authority behind the
[2:31:42] word hallelujah hallelujah one
[2:31:46] day uh I think almost I'm finishing my
[2:31:50] now I'm doing healing
[2:31:55] now this is now
[2:31:57] healing yeah I've
[2:32:00] preached I told I don't know how to
[2:32:03] speak so in my preaching I can say this
[2:32:07] but then it's
[2:32:09] healing because if ever you had
[2:32:12] housers when you go home just check
[2:32:15] around you find that are no
[2:32:18] more that's how simple our God
[2:32:21] is amen we are not uh
[2:32:25] denominations we are the bride of
[2:32:28] Christ and we just know exactly where we
[2:32:31] are
[2:32:32] standing hallelujah
[2:32:35] hallelujah whatever you may be going
[2:32:38] through let me tell you something it was
[2:32:41] for the glory of
[2:32:44] God God wanted to manifest his
[2:32:47] glory that's why he created this
[2:32:51] created Satan an
[2:32:53] enemy nothing is out of place
[2:32:57] brother for The Wonder of
[2:32:59] singing nothing is out of
[2:33:02] place all things are in
[2:33:05] order even the sickness you
[2:33:09] facing is for the glory of
[2:33:11] God hallelujah hallelu you know brother
[2:33:15] jofrey
[2:33:16] testified yesterday had an overnight
[2:33:20] I I've just used that
[2:33:23] example when I said it's for the glory
[2:33:25] of
[2:33:26] God there something they were talking
[2:33:29] about how you know way could be hard and
[2:33:32] they develop this complication that
[2:33:37] complication and then after talking
[2:33:40] about such
[2:33:42] things then he developed he started
[2:33:44] feeling what he used to
[2:33:47] feel it's like he called the spirits
[2:33:53] back he began was it so exact brother
[2:33:59] jofrey yes sir he be to feel what he
[2:34:02] used to
[2:34:03] feel but you see God wanted to prove
[2:34:08] something that's why you had to cause
[2:34:10] him to feel that
[2:34:12] way amen and others we having
[2:34:15] backaches some stomach
[2:34:18] problems you see
[2:34:20] why would God allow
[2:34:22] such in order for him to show his
[2:34:26] power all in his
[2:34:30] story it's all in his great Plan of
[2:34:35] Redemption hallelujah hallelujah and you
[2:34:38] know during the preaching of the word
[2:34:39] like
[2:34:41] this they never
[2:34:43] realized until the service was
[2:34:46] done all those who were sick
[2:34:51] they realize they are no longer
[2:34:53] sick hallelujah hallelujah why because
[2:34:57] God wanted to be that
[2:34:59] way amen you need to have a
[2:35:02] testimony but there can never be a
[2:35:04] testimony without a
[2:35:06] test so a test will produce a
[2:35:10] testimony hallelujah hallelujah this
[2:35:13] message the evening time
[2:35:16] message shall not produce a message
[2:35:24] this message do not produce a
[2:35:28] message this shall not be a m
[2:35:31] Edge but it shall be a golden
[2:35:35] Edge because the people understand the
[2:35:38] simplicit of
[2:35:40] God that is not in our
[2:35:43] Mighty how powerful we are but it is in
[2:35:47] the humility of his word
[2:35:50] why because it's God's plan to redeem
[2:35:54] man whe I say I don't want whether I say
[2:35:57] I don't brother God predestined me he
[2:36:02] predestined you you are just a
[2:36:05] dust and he anointed this
[2:36:08] dust for this hour whether you run away
[2:36:12] God do not
[2:36:14] replace you are irreplaceable

[2:40:37] people that God called me such humble
[2:40:42] people when you look at the life of our

[2:40:49] that God made him a simple
[2:40:52] man Oh my he was a simple
[2:40:56] man Jesus was a simple man to the exent
[2:41:00] when they about to to arrest him they

[2:41:20] Earth they never knew him the way we
[2:41:23] want to be
[2:41:24] known always in
[2:41:26] Simplicity because we want to be
[2:41:28] popular that's why we miss the will of
[2:41:31] God because we want to have a large

[2:42:59] one for me to manifest that
[2:43:02] one hallelujah hallelujah you work in
[2:43:05] your purpose God is so
[2:43:09] simple that's why we miss
[2:43:12] God because when we walk in our
[2:43:15] purpose it is no longer our
[2:43:18] ways his
[2:43:19] ways let a man let every word of any man
[2:43:23] be a
[2:43:27] lie but his word be

[2:43:35] things to be I want them to be like
[2:43:38] that that must be like that that must be
[2:43:41] like that that must when you get there
[2:43:45] it's like
[2:43:46] politicians when a politician
[2:43:49] is not
[2:43:50] ruling you have some good good good
[2:43:54] suggestions sayh you know what if you

[2:44:05] Road a very t Road you know these T
[2:44:08] roads these roads the well constructed
[2:44:13] roads that's your plan it can only be
[2:44:16] implemented on a t Road
[2:44:19] but life is not as thir as we see
[2:44:23] things life is
[2:44:25] mous and when you get in
[2:44:28] power you
[2:44:30] realize that you just had
[2:44:34] theories too many
[2:44:36] theories this message is not about
[2:44:40] the no no no no because you meet a
[2:44:44] sinner amen that's we have to respect
[2:44:47] one another
[2:44:49] Amen to have reverence for one
[2:44:52] another hallelujah our ways is not God's
[2:44:58] ways that's why we must be willing to
[2:45:00] let
[2:45:01] go of our own ways for us to manifest
[2:45:05] the will of
[2:45:06] God Moses had to let go of everything he
[2:45:11] Le in 40
[2:45:12] years for you to carry out the will of
[2:45:16] God Amen I told you
[2:45:20] I had to let
[2:45:22] go not that I wanted is how I used to
[2:45:24] enjoy those
[2:45:28] moments because I'll be up and down here
[2:45:31] brother and those poopies that are not
[2:45:34] structured I used to break and I feel
[2:45:36] that's the power of the Holy
[2:45:39] Ghost interpret brother you have you got
[2:45:44] I was saying I used to break
[2:45:47] poppets and when people are saying
[2:45:52] Hallelujah ah I used to feel like now we
[2:45:55] are preaching
[2:46:02] man we are now preaching
[2:46:05] brother oh brother God is so
[2:46:09] simple then he brought me in my
[2:46:13] purpose oh that left
[2:46:16] me he made me very weak a very weak
[2:46:18] speaker that you can even
[2:46:22] do and that's the time now you made me
[2:46:24] move from Nation to
[2:46:27] Nation they don't understand God but
[2:46:30] Lord why how I wish this this traveling
[2:46:34] came when I was like
[2:46:40] that you don't know
[2:46:45] that rain season
[2:46:49] strange in Zambia it's no longer rain
[2:46:52] season forgive
[2:46:54] me you know little did I know maybe was
[2:46:57] the fness I
[2:46:59] had that prohibited
[2:47:02] me from
[2:47:04] traveling because
[2:47:07] then then I wish to be
[2:47:10] traveling when I
[2:47:12] started I mean it doesn't bother me even
[2:47:15] if you know it doesn't you know I don't
[2:47:18] know to explain
[2:47:20] it but you see one thing you just know
[2:47:24] that you walk in the will of
[2:47:27] God the strength of God is not laying in
[2:47:30] how loud one can be the strength of God
[2:47:34] is Not Meant in how loud one can
[2:47:41] be if you all loud is very
[2:47:46] good and if I'm not loud very good but
[2:47:50] let me make sure that this is the will
[2:47:53] of God for my
[2:47:55] life because this Redemption
[2:47:59] plan is not Cared by
[2:48:02] men but those men must be filled by the
[2:48:06] purpose of
[2:48:07] God in order to dress the bride of
[2:48:11] Christ hallelujah hallelujah do you
[2:48:14] remember the stories of those people
[2:48:16] Pentecostal who met our prophet
[2:48:21] those men tears B says when he saw
[2:48:24] brother
[2:48:28] Bram when when he saw brother
[2:48:31] bam just few minutes when he met brother
[2:48:34] bam for the first
[2:48:37] time they saw a little man on the
[2:48:42] platform and Bor had a vision
[2:48:47] [Music]
[2:48:49] he saw Jesus
[2:48:51] Christ and he says the preacher was just
[2:48:55] a simple
[2:48:58] preacher and after he was done preaching
[2:49:00] thousands came to the
[2:49:06] Lord
[2:49:08] simple but
[2:49:12] powerful and the powerfulness is not
[2:49:14] laying in how loud my voice can be
[2:49:21] is how much I aligned my will into
[2:49:30] his
[2:49:34] amen you don't have even to force God to
[2:49:37] use
[2:49:38] you he's the one who is actually having
[2:49:41] a battle with the
[2:49:44] devil I mean is the guy who is going to
[2:49:46] lose if it means losing you didn't know
[2:49:49] it you just

[2:50:15] healing me from today I will follow you
[2:50:19] wherever you go go with
[2:50:21] you then he said my brother my brother
[2:50:25] just go and help your
[2:50:27] father and there are disciples who are
[2:50:29] saying father Lord can I go and bu my
[2:50:34] father I bu my
[2:50:37] father said no no no

[2:54:12] was born in a m
[2:54:14] Church grew up in a very big good church
[2:54:19] but she used to put on
[2:54:21] trousers and she she saw that to be
[2:54:24] nothing
[2:54:25] wrong but you know she had many
[2:54:28] problems and she was prayed for by
[2:54:31] different men of
[2:54:33] God seems the the rate at which it
[2:54:36] wanted to move it was not moving at
[2:54:41] that one of the Pastors in Zambia said
[2:54:43] you can go to brother
[2:54:46] Titus so when she came I didn't know she
[2:54:48] was a
[2:54:50] Believer because she was putting on a

[2:54:56] said you can't expect to be a
[2:55:02] believer I'm
[2:55:07] closing these are some of the people

[2:55:14] love that God gives his people
[2:55:20] you know I don't like judging them I
[2:55:23] don't even judge pcal
[2:55:25] people because if you judge them how you

[2:55:32] them so I all Try by means to apply
[2:55:35] love so I took
[2:55:38] her and then I don't know I forgotten
[2:55:41] the conversation how we found out she
[2:55:42] was a
[2:55:44] Believer I
[2:55:46] forgotten I didn't know now to come
[2:55:49] out to ask about the trousers I didn't
[2:55:55] know don't want to sound like I'm
[2:55:57] judging
[2:55:58] her and that's a
[2:56:01] difference someone will say why can't
[2:56:03] you just tell her even if
[2:56:06] should no you not win a soul like
[2:56:13] that soul is worn by
[2:56:16] love and not John the
[2:56:20] Baptist no John the Baptist just
[2:56:22] preached it blank
[2:56:25] bullet those guys were preaching to
[2:56:27] people who they even knew these on
[2:56:29] shouldn't believe he was even saying why
[2:56:31] have you
[2:56:35] come know the people are
[2:56:37] preaching people must be
[2:56:41] saved Hallelujah John the
[2:56:44] Baptist that's why John the Baptist died
[2:56:47] early
[2:56:49] of course we know it was in his purpose
[2:56:50] two people cannot DW at the same time
[2:56:53] man decrease God
[2:56:59] increase what am I trying to tell
[2:57:02] you
[2:57:04] love can
[2:57:06] help amen and I I spoke to her I said
[2:57:12] sister one
[2:57:14] day my cousin was involved in
[2:57:17] satanism my cousin the younger the last
[2:57:20] born in my mother's family now the
[2:57:26] daughter was involved in
[2:57:28] Satanism like
[2:57:34] Satanism sat is anyone who sat who is of
[2:57:38] sat is saturnist but there are those
[2:57:39] special who know like they prophets in
[2:57:41] the kingdom of
[2:57:44] darkness they move in the spiritual
[2:57:46] world and then they called me to pray
[2:57:49] for
[2:57:50] her now after we we
[2:57:53] prayed and the Lord helped her there's
[2:57:56] one spirit that
[2:57:58] remained now I was telling a
[2:58:02] testimony it was called the religious
[2:58:06] spirit that
[2:58:08] demon whenever she do something
[2:58:11] wrong that demon would tell her a child
[2:58:14] of
[2:58:16] God and she was convinced that that was
[2:58:21] God because that
[2:58:23] demon was so
[2:58:27] religious and why did he settle there so
[2:58:30] that that person shouldn't receive the
[2:58:32] Holy
[2:58:34] Ghost and we have so many religious
[2:58:36] people
[2:58:38] today say your hair must be
[2:58:42] long if you reach your hair here as a
[2:58:46] sister your hair that's a message
[2:58:48] don't cut your
[2:58:50] hair but be careful of enticing
[2:58:54] Spirits the enticing spirits that are in
[2:58:56] the spiritual
[2:58:59] realm those Spirits are very bad
[2:59:03] spirits they affect gifted
[2:59:08] people because they want people to act
[2:59:10] in a certain
[2:59:12] way they are enticing
[2:59:15] Spirits amen but they are also religious
[2:59:20] spirits that will make you too
[2:59:23] religious more than Jesus
[2:59:28] Christ they'll make you too holy than
[2:59:30] your
[2:59:33] God religious
[2:59:35] spirits that sister and you know those
[2:59:39] Spirits if it makes people they condemn
[2:59:43] anyone else
[2:59:48] a sister who has cut her hair they
[2:59:49] wouldn't want to GRE
[2:59:52] her yet even them they are condemning a
[2:59:57] fellow
[2:59:59] sinner yet they're just sinning a
[3:00:01] different
[3:00:04] sin religious
[3:00:07] Spirits God has not called us to condemn
[3:00:10] one
[3:00:11] another when we begin to see what Christ
[3:00:16] sees then we walk a different walk and I
[3:00:20] told about that spirit that was
[3:00:22] bothering my my young sister my
[3:00:25] cousin but by God's grace through
[3:00:28] designment of
[3:00:30] spirits that demon was
[3:00:33] exposed through speaking to her just
[3:00:37] said the why have you exposed
[3:00:41] me
[3:00:43] immediately my sister began to be like a
[3:00:46] bulldog
[3:00:54] was a
[3:00:56] demon but that demon was telling her to
[3:00:59] walk right with
[3:01:02] God so that she shouldn't go far to
[3:01:05] receive the Holy
[3:01:06] Ghost you can have a religious
[3:01:09] spirit a message
[3:01:12] Church you are too too much you have G
[3:01:17] to
[3:01:19] extreme of keeping long
[3:01:22] hair the devil can take you to
[3:01:25] extremes when you see someone who is not
[3:01:27] doing what you're
[3:01:32] doing God spirit is full of love and
[3:01:37] compassion when he looked upon them he
[3:01:40] was moved with
[3:01:43] compassion in the state when you meet
[3:01:45] Sinners when you meet sinners
[3:01:50] when you meet Sinners what is your
[3:01:53] approach you see young lady dressed
[3:01:57] immorally if you bu condemned to damage
[3:02:01] this non it's just because you have a
[3:02:03] lasting spirits and they tormenting
[3:02:11] you you have a lasting spirit and you
[3:02:13] being tortured by those thighs
[3:02:19] and there by
[3:02:24] preaching true
[3:02:26] love will go in the shoe of a
[3:02:29] person true love will go in the shoe of
[3:02:33] a
[3:02:34] person and sympathize with
[3:02:37] them and say how I wish they had what I
[3:02:42] had maybe they wouldn't be in this
[3:02:45] condition and with a pure love
[3:02:48] you go that way you win many people to
[3:02:51] the
[3:02:53] world hallelujah hallelujah and this is
[3:02:56] the character of Jesus
[3:02:57] Christ when the Pharisees who are
[3:03:00] hypocrites were busy condemning a sinner
[3:03:02] that
[3:03:07] woman the
[3:03:09] Hypocrites were busy condemning that
[3:03:12] lady Jesus said whosoever has not done
[3:03:15] it let him cast a stone
[3:03:20] many people are bound by
[3:03:23] Spirits that's the reason they behave
[3:03:25] the way they
[3:03:26] behave not because they want to behave
[3:03:28] that but because there's a spirit of
[3:03:30] fornication on
[3:03:32] them whe they want or not they still do
[3:03:35] it what you need is not to condemn
[3:03:38] that cast The Devil
[3:03:41] out by the
[3:03:43] word hallelujah hallelujah amen amen I'm
[3:03:47] closing just a
[3:03:49] minute you see she was a Believer but
[3:03:54] she was putting on trousers but if I
[3:03:56] went on
[3:03:58] condemning this is sin
[3:04:01] what that's why you can entirely exate
[3:04:04] the whole church including yourself
[3:04:06] andate
[3:04:12] yourself because you realize you're also
[3:04:15] going back to your sins
[3:04:18] once in a while once in a while you
[3:04:21] drift
[3:04:23] back then you excommunicate
[3:04:26] yourself when this sister had this
[3:04:30] testimony within her the devil spoke
[3:04:34] out why have you exposed
[3:04:38] me and then she was like brother
[3:04:41] Titus it was like that's when she woke
[3:04:44] up I realize it's wrong for me to put
[3:04:50] on that's how she was delivered from
[3:04:52] that
[3:04:55] Spirit by
[3:04:57] love when love is
[3:04:59] projected you can
[3:05:01] help hallelujah hallelujah it's not you
[3:05:05] for me change
[3:05:10] a God
[3:05:12] himself has a plan a plan of redeeming
[3:05:16] that but our is to
[3:05:19] love of course we I don't mean no
[3:05:21] preaching
[3:05:23] against but correction must be done in
[3:05:27] love hallelujah hallelujah am you love
[3:05:30] the
[3:05:32] Lord It's not by
[3:05:35] powery it's not even how loud I am it's
[3:05:39] the authority behind the
[3:05:41] voice the sister came
[3:05:44] on she was she was tortured for too
[3:05:50] long and not speaking to her as I was
[3:05:54] speaking to
[3:05:55] her I saw myself out of my
[3:05:59] body and I began to hear the voice of
[3:06:02] God now we became three people
[3:06:06] there
[3:06:07] amen that was me the voice of
[3:06:11] God and the sister I began to he the
[3:06:15] voice
[3:06:16] loud speak to that
[3:06:18] sister things that have been causing our
[3:06:22] problems and was I was also
[3:06:26] listening I Heard a Voice of God command
[3:06:30] the
[3:06:32] Demon I've never had such a simple but I
[3:06:36] could hear the authority behind that
[3:06:41] voice and
[3:06:43] instantly the sister for too
[3:06:46] long she got
[3:06:48] delivered hallelujah hallelujah it's not
[3:06:51] what we can do when we submit oursel to
[3:06:54] the will of
[3:06:56] God hallelujah hallelujah amen I've seen
[3:07:00] churches brother that have been having a
[3:07:03] lot of battles
[3:07:06] B the Lord has sent me to such
[3:07:09] places just a very simple
[3:07:12] message all things come back to
[3:07:15] normal why because because God has a
[3:07:19] purpose he wants to achieve a certain
[3:07:22] purpose what purpose to redeem the
[3:07:25] bride amen uh there are many quotations
[3:07:29] I had but because of time I will not be
[3:07:33] able to go through that but I wanted to

[3:07:39] Ministry amen the ministry of the Lord
[3:07:42] Jesus
[3:07:43] Christ is here to help the brde in order
[3:07:47] for the right to reach a certain
[3:07:49] level until the
[3:07:52] headstone amen until she will be
[3:07:56] him so thankful that the word is in the
[3:08:00] bride hallelujah hallelujah it was a

[3:08:29] used to be F I used to be fly fly like
[3:08:33] full when I'm
