[0:01] 17 amen there is a thought which is
[0:05] picked to come to
[0:08] that and now that point is in Revelation
[0:13] 13 Verse
[0:15] 18 you just leave your finger
[0:19] there because we shall be going back to
[0:23] 17 he says here is
[0:27] wisdom let him that has understand
[0:31] count the number of the
[0:33] Beast for the number of a
[0:38] man amen and this number
[0:43] 666 so when we are talking about a
[0:47] beast carrying a
[0:49] woman amen don't look at an animal look
[0:53] at a man who has set up
[0:58] assist are you together with me so in
[1:01] verse 4 of Revelation
[1:05] 17 he says and the woman was in
[1:10] purple and scet
[1:12] color and decked with
[1:15] [Music]
[1:18] gold and precious
[1:21] stones and PS having a golden cup in her
[1:25] hand full of abomination and fness of
[1:36] and this woman here is supposed to have
[1:40] been the
[1:46] church so we can call this
[1:49] woman a fallen
[1:52] woman a fallen
[1:55] church are you together with me and it
[1:58] has got somebody
[2:01] that rides
[2:05] around and upon her
[2:07] [Music]
[2:08] forehead was
[2:10] written a
[2:13] name mystery Bon the
[2:18] great the mother of and Abominations of
[2:21] the
[2:23] earth amen are you together with me he
[2:27] says that mystery babyon the great
[2:35] mother praise God so she is not
[2:42] Babylon but she is a mystery
[2:48] Babylon so in this this woman the Bible
[2:53] says she Seth upon many
[2:57] Waters so these are symbols Revelations
[3:01] the book of
[3:02] symbols in verse 15 We Now understand
[3:07] what the waters
[3:09] are verse 15
[3:11] says and he says unto me the waters
[3:16] which thou
[3:18] seest amen where the
[3:23] SE are peoples and
[3:26] multitudes and Nations and tongs
[3:32] okay now so now they are describing this
[3:35] woman
[3:36] here and the Beast that carries her and
[3:40] then once he comes into chapter
[3:43] 18 ver one that's why he says after
[3:47] these
[3:50] things amen I saw another Angel come
[3:54] down from
[3:56] heaven having great power and the Earth
[3:59] was lighted in his
[4:01] glory and he cried mightly with a strong
[4:05] voice
[4:06] saying
[4:08] Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen
[4:14] and is become the
[4:16] habitation of
[4:18] devils and the hold of every F
[4:22] Spirit and the C of every unclean and
[4:28] hatful so where are we called out
[4:32] of we are called out of a church
[4:35] system that has fallen from the
[4:38] world so this
[4:41] Babylon is a web that is knit around our
[4:45] social
[4:48] lives and all Natures of
[4:51] evil operates in this mystery
[4:56] Babylon under the power of Po
[5:00] Rel and money so of
[5:08] glob amen is knitted around these
[5:15] factors we got business
[5:18] cels business
[5:22] cels amen we get different drug
[5:28] CS amen and they all operate under
[5:33] there but our major emphasis
[5:37] today is not on money and
[5:40] politics it's now you and
[5:45] me not to be
[5:47] caught into that
[5:50] system that's what we are called out
[5:54] of because it says for all nations have
[5:57] drank of the wine of Ara
[6:02] amen and the kings of the Earth have
[6:05] committed fornication
[6:07] with amen and the Marchers of the Earth
[6:11] are now greatly
[6:13] reached in the abundance of her
[6:18] delices and therefore I heard another
[6:20] voice from Heaven
[6:22] say come out of her my
[6:27] people amen in the world but not of the
[6:35] world Amen Rising
[6:40] above that's why he says come out of all
[6:43] my
[6:45] people this is not going to be another
[6:50] Exodus amen like it was in
[6:53] Egypt your call to come out is just for
[6:59] you
[7:00] not to be
[7:01] partaker of all the wrong things that
[7:05] happen in
[7:06] Babylon Amen in the Bible we've got an
[7:11] example of the children of
[7:13] Israel that were captured and taken into
[7:17] Babylon in captivity but then we've got
[7:21] three
[7:26] boys and another one and sadrach praise
[7:31] the Lord they were in Babylon but they
[7:35] refused to worship the god of
[7:37] babyon are you together with me in
[7:40] Babylon But Rising above
[7:44] Babylon we've got Daniel he was in
[7:47] Babylon a Fallen Kingdom which was
[7:51] wicked but Daniel rised above
[7:56] babon and you also you live in a mystery
[8:00] babyon a fallen wild
[8:03] system but one thing which we pray for
[8:07] that you may stand like Daniel in this
[8:12] babyon amen praise God listen to what
[8:17] the prophet
[8:18] say he says come out over my
[8:22] people say to the Lord come out of
[8:27] Babylon confusion
[8:30] come out of your of your
[8:34] Creeds of your self styled
[8:37] things I will receive you says the Lord
[8:42] touch not the unclean
[8:44] things nether bnic parties in
[8:49] church and the B and all other kind of
[8:54] stuff and he
[8:56] dances he says come out so where are we
[9:00] coming from you are not coming from a
[9:04] natural
[9:05] world another natural world like they
[9:09] came from
[9:11] Egypt into Canan that's not your call
[9:16] your call is to come out of the
[9:19] things that are generated in
[9:23] Babylon that those things don't have
[9:26] control over
[9:27] you the fashion of this world will not
[9:31] appeal to
[9:32] you you find people some of them are
[9:36] going for a
[9:38] wedding and they go
[9:40] naked my little
[9:43] grandchild two years looked at a picture
[9:47] of one of the people that were a
[9:51] bright this morning and she said naked
[9:58] girl
[10:00] those are
[10:01] things that are generated in the Fallen
[10:04] system and the purpose of
[10:07] all is to
[10:16] gender
[10:18] amen praise the Lord you know verse five
[10:23] of Revelation 18 says and upon her
[10:28] forehead
[10:30] was the name
[10:32] written mystery
[10:34] babyon the mother of hot and
[10:37] Abominations of the
[10:41] earth praise the Lord now this woman
[10:45] here that was riding on top of this
[10:49] Beast amen is called mystery
[10:54] babyon and the pest was the
[10:58] engineer
[11:00] behind her
[11:01] systems are you together with me you are
[11:04] going to understand
[11:06] today amen and understand where you come
[11:09] from what the gospel is calling you out
[11:13] to amen so the fth of her
[11:18] fornication means the
[11:21] fness of her
[11:24] unfaithfulness because she's supposed to
[11:27] a church
[11:30] that is married to the Lord Jesus
[11:33] Christ but that's not where her loyalty
[11:38] is you begin to show them
[11:41] scripture and prove to them that b in
[11:46] Jesus
[11:47] name and they refuse it you show them
[11:51] scripture that ladies should dress
[11:55] modestly they reject it are you together
[11:59] with me yeah it is a
[12:02] system that has got a hold of the
[12:05] people and when God is saving you that's
[12:09] the system he calls you
[12:12] out to take you to Messianic
[12:15] Kingdom where the word is our
[12:21] controller amen so you know unfaithful
[12:25] to Divine
[12:27] leadership
[12:29] unfaithful to the instructions of
[12:33] Christ which is supposed to be the
[12:35] husband to the
[12:37] church so and Abomination
[12:41] therefore because she was Mother of
[12:44] harot Amen the groups that reject the
[12:50] word and they come from that
[12:53] Union every group is
[12:57] called
[12:59] amen are you together with me and then
[13:03] he says again appear that full of
[13:07] Abominations of the
[13:10] earth so when you are called out of
[13:13] babyon the
[13:15] main you are being called out of is the
[13:21] Abominations
[13:24] uhuh amen you come out of the
[13:28] Abomination
[13:30] if you come out of a
[13:32] religion and you Ser come into the
[13:35] message and then you
[13:37] walking with the Abominations of the
[13:40] land you are still in Babylon while you
[13:48] here so to come out of
[13:51] babon is to totally come out of the uh
[13:55] you know traditions and uh the
[14:02] Abominations so Abomination
[14:06] means the things that are
[14:09] [Music]
[14:13] detestable something
[14:16] F amen and it's only God who can tell us
[14:23] what an Abomination
[14:26] is are you together with me it's not you
[14:30] who declares what an Abomination
[14:34] is it's God who tells us what an
[14:38] Abomination
[14:39] is because he the one who knows what is
[14:43] calling us
[14:45] out as we come into the Messianic
[14:50] King amen so let us look at a few of
[14:54] these
[14:56] Abominations in Leviticus
[14:59] chapter
[15:00] 18 and verse
[15:02] 22 I want you to write it down
[15:08] homosexuality is an
[15:12] Abomination okay because in Romans
[15:15] chapter 1 when the First Church of Rome
[15:20] fell the Bible says God gave them
[15:24] up to an unlean
[15:27] spirit and they started living
[15:30] together woman and wom and then men and
[15:35] men the Bible cause that an
[15:38] Abomination we come out of that we
[15:41] cannot be
[15:43] partaker of that kind of
[15:46] character amen
[15:49] Deuteronomy 7 verse
[15:53] 25 a
[15:55] worship involving
[15:57] idols is an
[15:59] Abomination are you together with me we
[16:02] cannot involve
[16:04] ourselves in a worship where they
[16:08] Idols some of these
[16:10] Idols are real uh you know
[16:15] sculptures but then there are some Idols
[16:18] where the men became the
[16:24] idol they desire to take the respect of
[16:27] God
[16:30] that's I
[16:32] mean idol
[16:34] worship it's
[16:38] Idol because no man can share this honor
[16:43] with the Lord Jesus
[16:45] Christ
[16:49] ameny verse
[16:51] 11 and 12 involving in
[16:56] Witchcraft and Consulting
[16:59] witches is an
[17:01] Abomination come out of that you are not
[17:04] supposed to be a
[17:06] partaker to astrology of any
[17:10] kind
[17:12] amen chapter
[17:14] 22 and verse five a woman wearing what
[17:20] pertains to a
[17:22] man is an
[17:26] Abomination Hallelujah
[17:29] mother
[17:31] of and all Abominations of the
[17:34] earth so we need to know the
[17:38] Abominations out of which we are
[17:42] called amen I know one day when I put on
[17:46] a
[17:47] dress and I start moving on the streets
[17:50] of
[17:52] Ginger either they will say I'm
[17:55] mad or the police will arrest me
[17:59] [Music]
[18:00] because it's not
[18:02] natural the Bible calls it an
[18:05] Abomination so when you talk to these
[18:08] ladies who were interested on putting on
[18:11] a man's
[18:13] cloth they said the fry of a man looks
[18:16] to the
[18:18] right but the one of a woman turns to
[18:21] the
[18:23] left but still the
[18:26] trous in our culture
[18:29] is accepted as a man's
[18:32] way but the people have taken for it the
[18:36] Bible says it's an
[18:41] Abomination amen so let's go to Proverbs
[18:45] chapter
[18:46] 15 and verse
[18:48] 8 the scripture says the
[18:52] sacrifice of the
[18:54] wicked is an Abomination to the Lord
[18:59] but the
[19:00] prayer of the
[19:02] ight is
[19:05] Delight are you together with me so now
[19:09] this is an
[19:10] Abomination where many of us could be
[19:14] found
[19:16] guilty we come to the church like this
[19:19] one we enjoy the teaching of the
[19:22] word but then we carry certain forms of
[19:27] life that qualify Us in
[19:32] wickedness the Bible say the sacrifice
[19:36] of the
[19:37] wicked is an Abomination to the
[19:40] Lord amen an offering paid
[19:45] in is an
[19:47] Abomination you bring your offering you
[19:50] bring your
[19:51] ti amen and you think God is pleased
[19:56] with
[19:56] you he is that's an abomination
