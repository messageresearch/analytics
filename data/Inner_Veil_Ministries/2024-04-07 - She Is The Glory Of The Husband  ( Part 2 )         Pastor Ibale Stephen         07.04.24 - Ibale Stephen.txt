where [Applause] brother amen so we don't have much time enough for us [Music] conation so you can go and take your seat amen no the who the owner is around may God praise God we are happy to be a Brotherhood amen amen so let's just stand up and the subject again she's the glory of the husband part two First Corinthians chapter 11 but let us pray precious Heavenly Father we thank you so much for another time you've given to us we pray that you may bless this hour so that father the words that you speak to us may be braved in our lives I commit to you all these children that father they may benefit from your presence in Jesus name amen amen amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen 1 Corinthians 11:7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he the image and the glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man may the Lord had blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so as I said she is the glory of the husband but part two so now in the Holy scriptures in the Book of Esther we see that King made a feast all his princes and his servants the power of pan media the noes and princes of the provinces being before him so he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his excellent Majesty for 180 days which is three months after this he made another party different from that one and this was to all the people that were present in sh and the palace both great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's Palace but while the king made that party queen V made a par Feast instead she refused to come King's commandment amen so she refused to come forth to her moment because the wife is the glory of the husband the king had intended to show her forth as part of his glory that he was showing forth in that P because in that batt there was Beauty on displ there was white green blue different hangings like sister Seer knows how to do those things amen purple silvering pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue do you know they drank in vessels of gold they drank Royal Wine in [Music] abundance and the Queen at that time of the display of beauty was supposed to cap up the [Music] party with her beauty but she opted out like a god after all the creation he kept up his creation by bringing forth man he was the pin of his creation because that man was the manifestation of the glory of God to Nature and now this woman here was supposed to C up with Beauty amen so as Christians we have not once but not once or twice but opted out Amen to God given opportuni for us to display the beauty of Holiness but I want to say one day you drop that opportunity for the last time amen you see V was called but she turned it down and that was the last time maybe it was her habit to do things like that when the opportunity comes your way to testify of his goodness or to invite somebody to church go ahead and do it bring them into this presence find every vable opportunity and display the beauty of Holiness are you together with me okay so now I I want to just take a little time and take you to the dedication of the Tabernacle of David when David had brought the Ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that he had pitched for it and they offered burn sacrifices and peace offerings before God David then in 1 Chronicles chapter 16 verse 29 you know David says give unto the Lord the glory do to his name bring an offering and come before Him worship Him in the beauty of his Holiness Hallelujah worship him in the beaut of his H not the statement now am the beauty of Holiness which means that Holiness is beautiful step into it and Worship the Lord in the beauty of Hol so in our subject talking about the woman being the glory of the man the beauty of Holiness is the woman displaying the character of the man and in this angle the bride attaining to the stature of the perfect man are you together with me yes sir now listen here you know she is the glory of the man like Adam was the glory of God to Nature then out of Adam came the woman and the woman was the glory of Adam are you together with me maybe by the grace of God we shall see next time How Eve brought the glory of Adam in the first of the we need to hold the beauty of [Applause] Holiness now listen here all the seven spiritual virtues are the Life of Christ in the bride and virtues are therefore the beauty of Holiness when the presence of the Lord was visible at the dedication of the Temple of the Tabernacle of David that was the beauty of Holiness and when I mean David saw the presence he invited the people to come and worship in that beauty hallelujah hallelujah the presence had stepped down the glory of God was there and he called the people and he says him in the beaut of his Hol amen oh how I desire God would be gracious with the virtues that he freely gives to us when we feel that presence how we need to step into moments of worship sometimes is the time you come to and you feel a presence when that presence is there that's the feeling of the beauty of Holiness you lift up your hands and mention a few words to you are so powerful you are Mighty Lord I feel your presence May the glory of God feel my heart also help me all the time to walk under this glory amen yes listen now the prophet says we put on the blood of Jesus Christ and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ the of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ amen he is the head and controls it's the head that controls the body amen yes sir without the head the body can't do nothing amen and your feet is the foundation faith contr by the head there you are there's the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues how does he possess this VT amen because the scripture says upon faith upon do you fight to add those virtues to yourself no you don't fight what actually is happening here is saying that upon your faith ivert you are not fighting for it he's giving it he's only saying now addt so you just add these are virtues of Grace which God gives unto us so that we can build ourselves into the living Tabernacle of the Living God then after that he says then God representing his church as a bride representing his church as a bride a woman God represents his church as a bride did you hear that what's the bride the bride is God in the life of a Believer that's what it is you just open up whatever he gives you add whatever you give you add whatever he gives you add after you have added everything then charity which is the love of God comes as the strength as the roof to the structure read stat of a perfect man very well he says after you have laid your foundation you find virtue it to Faith and he says that's your first column which means all these others are also walls knowledge is a wall Temperance is a war godliness is a war everything is a war then together you make a six sided house because everything keeps coming down to faith and charity CS you up is the strength of all these things when you build a house and you don't C it amen it is not strong so the beauty of Holiness is a presence that's the beauty that came down to the fruit of Mount HB when God was meeting Moses that's the beauty of Holiness hallelujah hallelujah God empting himself in his and when he EMP himself into his bride then that bride becomes the beauty of the husband which is Christ and when you impart on the revelation of the word into your wife you love her you've imparted a beauty of Holiness and then she becomes Hallelujah the glory of the HB that's what is the prophet say we thank thee for those who have been called are you called out amen amen you said that the ones that escape in that day the branch of the Lord the people of God would be beautiful hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah those who es fromon you are so beautiful appreci himself are you together with me the people that escaped that day would be beautiful and we thank thee for the beauty of Hol clean holy spirit filled people living for you by your grace there there are this amen so when the Bride Comes to the level God becomes proud of her and therefore moves forward to display her beauty which V refused Queen was called I'm displaying all Beauty in my kingdom and you are all that I am doing this for you are the queen come and I display your beauty queen V refused she was the glory of the king but she refused to come out she could not come to her adoption to show the beauty of Holiness are you together with me so ver thought that her looks was her beauty but the beauty of the church is the character of the people amen that's the beauty of the church is not this building here but the character of the people is the beauty of the church so kingas was calling the queen come and I show you forth let me show forth your character but when she refused she displayed her character when the political son worked under his father he had a great show of success because he was putting everything I mean because he was putting into place all the instruction from the father he was a great worker and he said now father give me also what belongs to me and I'll go in the next city and I also put up my f her success I mean his success he did not know was the instruction of the father that he was working under so when he was given the you know part of the farm and was transferred to another city and he reached there he thought he would work and display his glory in the absence of the father but he discovered that the F was going down his might was the father are you together with me his might was the father in the absence of the father his F could not Prosper are you together with me so this boy here was the glory of his father in the absence of his father the glory would diminish amen when that son was strictly under the father that was the beauty of Holiness but when he stepped out he had stepped out of the channel of the light so he had no light to shine because we finished at the not amen when the son is the father and the mo is the church are you together with amen but then when this boy here who is the image of the church walked away from under the ray of the sun he had nothing to reflect are you together with me we used to do some experiment you get something which is very shiny and then you put it in front of the light and then this light would come and EIT here and then it would light over there so this person here this miror amen did not have the power of the light the power of The Light Came From a Certain Source the mirror just redirected the light that's the Church of Jesus Christ we must stand in the angle of where the light strikes and when the light strikes then the mirror which is the church reflects that light are you together with me then this mirror here is the glory amen of the source of the light hallelujah hallelujah that's how it is between the Sun and the Moon the moon does not have its own light the moon has the the light from the Sun so in the absence of the sun then the moon would Shine the Light which she has received from the son are you together with me so when the boy the prodal went away from the Chanel of the son he had no life when we turn away from the CH of the light the Lord Jesus Christ we have no life to reflect we are the glory of the sun when we stand in the angle of the sunlight you should not get in an obure angle and you still expect that you are going to shine the light when you are not drinking in the light we must receive the light of the Sun for us the moon the church to be able to have something to refle Hallelujah Hallelujah now back to this queen she was groomed by the king [Music] Amen to be his pride and not her own glory to groom means to tut to coach to train amen we don't go through tutorship of the Holy Ghost to enhance our own pride no sir we are not the ones who are being manifested it's the glory of God that shines to us that gives us the opportunity to manifest the life hallelujah hallelujah the beauty of Hol must be seen in the amen the glory of was the position that the king had placed her in and when she was put out of that position for that reflect the king's Glory she was not hard of anymore what was her end because she was not in the channel of that light so she had nothing to reflect hallelujah hallel praise the Lord the song leader sang here that this real light of M I will let it sh Hallelujah because he was standing in ch with the word so the same goes in the outside world that every woman amen because ver was beautifying herself for what she was called to display the beauty and she refused now what were you beautifying yourself for it's the same thing that goes on in the world that every woman tries to beautify herself for the man uhuh for a man the outside world she wants to be appreciated but the problem is is that she is only reverse principal because the principal the woman is the glory of the husband but this woman here she's trying to shine her glory for every man that's the problem she might shine she must share the glory of her husband you see what I mean that's what it is so a man a super man will learn how to design his wife Hallelujah because she is supposed to reflect his [Applause] glory but she got go to the shop and buys this shoe she's beautifying herself forever man because the man a old ghost man would feel it good for her to have a decent shoe but when she chooses her own and she's walking like falling to the front she's playing to the gallery of every man she's trying to sh her own glory for every man but she must shine the glory of her husband when she has those kind of loose cuts and then the breast are out she's trying to present herself own glory to every man let's go to Second Kings here chapter 9 do you love him and in the 11th year of jam the son of Ahab began haah to re over Judah and when was come toel she heard of it and she painted her face what is she doing that for to catch a man and tired ahead and looked at her window she does all this because je was coming [Applause] to whose glory is she trying to be for every man but the wife is the glory of her husband and Je entered in the gate she said listen to the words of Jezebel had Z peace who slew his master was a king who only ruled for seven days by killing king Ella so you see that's the problem of failure to point at ourselves and we keept seeing the mistakes of others did you hear what I say who is saying this it is Jezebel she has groomed herself Amen to catch but je does not buy the idea and now immediately she turns around because she knows that je was going to put her to death and she says did Z have peace the one who killed his master now Jezebel is wondering she's she's trying to bring to to to notice that je should not put her to death did have peace je did not ask her did you have peace when you killed you see what I mean you know she put to death but now when it comes to her she's telling did Z [Music] peace after killing his master and She's forgetting that she did the same now let me tell you ministers these pits should be used properly you don't get in a pulit to crucify [Music] people when you get to the pulit you Minister knowing that the word on you as it on others are you together with me yeah you are subject to the word the same way those people you are talking to are subject to the word you don't take the word and use it in a onesided form so is Jezebel Jezebel religion will focus on others preaching the gospel to people are thousand miles away you are just talking about them and you are not caring about your people and yourself I'll give you another example Mary Magdalene shared about Christ being invited into the house of Simon the leper and she took her alabaster box of oil to impress the house where the dignitaries were going to be she was a very well known woman but on the other angle she was an evil woman upon whom all the Cardinal spirits of evil convened and gave her a nature she always took her alaster box of oil and when people were not attending she would do a little bit of sprinkle and the alaster oil will make you look where it is coming from so she knew how to trap the men she carried the alabaster box of oil if they are not attending she would just remove the lead a little that was Mary but she had the spirit of Pride she had the spirit of B she had the spirit of unclean she was filthy she was vulgar she had emulations she the prophet the one who was able to discern her before she got converted and saw those seven spirits upon her life she always gathered with the cream of the society back and forth she would do an alabaster secret and the people would oh you see alaster oil was a stand out kind of oil it was a mix of several expensive oils together but when she entered in there she was struck by a unique presence that humbled her arrogant Spirit the presence of the Lord will always disarm us she just didn't know but there was a certain form of presence and she felt this place is different and she was feeling like the power in there wouldn't allow her to use the alabaster oil she starts to look around and she saw a man with shag hair this man here had that fet and his face was so sticky from sweat but yet there was something around her that she would not realize she started keeping eyes on him the more dignitaries were around because in the old days when a man arranges a party he has to know the number of people he has and then he would make sure he makes the same number of change of [Applause] garments that when the people would come to the B they would have a fruit washing flanking they right there at the the door because they used to move in the wilderness Palestine was a Wilderness amen amen and now they would walk and the sand would stick in those feet and stick in there and then they would get so wet from their sweat because it was hot place and so they would go they would give a bath and now they would change their clothes they would get the perfumes they would be given where to see but then this Mary M he sees this man here he has not been attended to when he turned a little further he saw another bunch of 12 men that were SE near them he wondered what kind of people are this listen now she realizes it was Christ and she opened the alabaster box not for herself this time but to pour on the feet of the master and clean the feet with her hair she realized this is my maker she realized the power coming from this man would speak me out of existence this power here would speak anything it existence but when she did that the spirit of judgment came from Simon and his friends if this man was a prophet he would have known that this woman touching him is a woman of ill Fame but they are the ones who had invited her you see what I mean so listen now it's the spirit of judgment you fail to look at your condition and you judge a man in the condition this man if he was a prophet he would the kind of man that was touching him but the same man Simon was a leper and the law did not even allow him to meet together with other [Applause] people this is how the ministers are they've got all kinds of problems but they can set on one man me this [Applause] one you see what I mean before you shoot look at yourself Jezebel should have not judged zy who killed a she equally needed the grace because she killed but she covers up her condition and then attacks I mean she attacks je you understand what I mean so back Jezebel and [Music] Je and as je entered in the gate she say who his master and Je lifted up his face to the window and say who is on my side who and they looked out he to him two or three unics and say throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the houses and he thr her under foot amen she done the beautification to catch the attention of je listen now the wife is the glory of the husband whatever she does however she designs herself the husband needs to approve you see what I mean because she is his glory amen let's go to First Peter 31 are you still there this evening amen now listen likewise the wives be subjection to your own husband that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one by the conversation of the word meaning that the subjection of a wife ministers to the man amen who is not a Believer while they behold your chest conversation coupled with fear so your husbands will watch your confession not here your confession but watch as you live through your confession amen who ading let it not be this is where the point is who ading let it not be that out ading plating the hair and of wearing of God and of putting on of Apper but let it be that Any Man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the hament of a Meek and qu spirit in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also trusted in God adoring themselves being in subjection to their own [Music] husbands he's saying that putting on expensive oper is okay but that's not what will win your husband you are going to win your husband by adoring your inner man with submission much as you could dress your outward person with great appr when it comes to wife ministering to a husband let every action come from the inner man and when it comes from the that's brother Bram in the message Look Away to Jesus he says you women as you serve your husband you serve God so whatever you are doing you are doing a service to God now through her life's journey Jezebel had no light to reflect she was wife to husband so her beauty was her own mind Ahab was an extinguished light God have mercy extinguished turn around human and tell your friend God forbid I should not be an extinguished light I should not be an extinguished light my wife must have something to take from me and be able to reflect my glory but the right and his character that you reflect from the major light so in the ab of the word jeel put on a light amen which is a self beautification husbands must guide their wives in their beautification whether natural spiritual because she is going to be your glory husbands must have something real that can spark a light Amen to their words husbands must be students of the world they must light the candle which is their own words amen husband's light must be seen shining in the hall amen it must be seen shining in the hall the man is the glory of God is that right and he must stay under that Glory because the wife must have some glory to tap or else she will have nothing to reflect listen Adam in the Garden of Eden carried the glory of God before all nature he led nature the same way the Holy Ghost leads a Believer he was the glory of God in the garden he was the link between God and nature therefore God had to impart enough glory to Adam he had to give him enough glory for the animals to see the glory of God so the image and likeness made Adam to carry the glory of God around him let us make m in our image and likeness Hallelujah that was the glory of God that he had given to the man and when the man walked in the garden they saw the glory of God because he was the likeness and image of God are you together with me yes sir praise God so in First Corinthians chapter 11 and verse three listen to what Paul say but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so now this is the Divine [Applause] ranking God Christ man wom so it means that Christ had a headship meaning that Christ was the mind of God hallelujah hallu and when he come here amen the man had to tap into him that now the man becomes the mind of Christ amen in order for him to have a and afterwards then this man here after he has imparted his own God has imparted Christ has imparted his mind to to man then the man becomes the glory I mean of Jesus Christ and the woman Taps into him God Christ man woman that's why when Jesus came he says I came in my father's name I brought a glory to manifest I am the glory of God here on Earth in 176 of John he says I have manifested thy name I manifested thy character I manifested thy nature I manifested th Glory I lived your life for them to tap into hallelujah hallelujah Christ was the brightness of God's glory and the express image of his person he was our example se he was the expression of the glory of God and under the same token the woman would be the expression of the glory of the man the man must impart this glory to his wife by the word amen he should be a bright light by the word that his wife could tap into that light amen n her cherish her she's your interpretation to the outside world she's the Fifth Gospel to your children she is your glory handle her with respect I've heard it amen amen listen Isen brother Bram says a statement here he says in the message Jehovah of charot he says and so but if there is any [Music] credit to be given to the Bram family Let It Go to her she's the one who deserves it she stands between me and the public the seven years old 37 years old completely wh headed a real mother a sweetheart a wife if you need some public reputation let the glory she holds about you be real the men that are here where is your light for the woman to tap into you make a noise about the food the one who bought this meat start Distributing meat but the prophet said that he stands between you and the publics there's no one who knows that you go in [Applause] the day you will break this Andes out you will be naked and you don't have any glory on table and when you are Oney come and say and brother Bram says she stands between me and the outside worldall am turn around your wife and just tell her honey I love you why separ praise the Lord amen you must be a student of the word by the inside teacher Peter was a student of the word by the inside teacher flesh and blood has not revealed this to you Hallelujah flesh and blood is not teaching this tonight I want you to catch a revelation of how important a family relationship of husband and wife is let the Holy Spirit teach it to your [Applause] heart praise the Lord Matthew chapter 16 verse 17 and Jesus answered and said unto him after Peter had been taught by the spirit the inside teacher had broken Revelation to him Jesus said unto him blessed th Simon B for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto my Father which is in heaven amen I pray that the Holy Spirit becomes the teacher tonight then our churches will be a place to be proud [Applause] of Prophet says if the spirit was not inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you had it every moment of the day if you are not taught by the Holy Spirit it can't break it Revelation Verse 18 and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock of Revelation I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it upon the rock of Revelation amen and I'll give unto thee after that Revelation I give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of heav and whatsoever you B shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever is Loos shall be loosed in heaven then charge his disciples that they should not tell every man that he was Christ tell no man it must come by Revelation and that way it will bring the RS of Life hallelujah hallelujah if is taught by a man is a dead letter but if it comes as Revelation it brings rays of life on the side of a man and that man with the revelation of Christ we have r that is going to reflect to his wife she have some light that she's going to take it amen and that way she becomes the glory of the man listen to the teaching of the Spirit John 11:27 she says unto him yeah Lord I believe that thou are the Christ the son of God which should come into the world mother being a student of the inside teacher is the only thing that will cause you to touch eternal life amen if you are a student of this teacher you tap into Christ the thou the Christ son of the Living God husband are you here will you tap into the Christ Light tonight and once you tap into the Christ Light then that light will spread to your wife and the character of your wife will become the glory of the man you need to take something home with you for your wife to tap into amen so once the husband Taps into that light tonight then charity will have stepped into your family and that charity will become the bond of your marriage nature submitted to that logos the theop charity before the fall charity submitted but after the fall nature fell from the love Covenant and then subjected to fear have you heard it come on now are you here before that all the animals would come to Adam and would bow before Adam before the fall but after the fall we see that it continued a little bit that they were even able to enter into the Ark of Noah by their own but after the flag the Covenant of Love escaped those creatures right now when a snake sees you if it doesn't bite you you will kill it you see what I mean I'm trying to bring something here in the Book of Genesis chapter 9 verse two after the fall After the flood and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth that's the Fallen man his fear will be upon every be of the field so when a man falls from the love Covenant upon which the Christian marriages are founded his wife and children are downgraded to the Covenant of the Beast they will be afraid of you when you come into the house everybody scatters into the corner and the wife is almost crawling on her knees the fall darkness in the family no light to T did you hear that she will cry your wife cries together with the creation for the adoption of the sons of God now fear does not Bond a marriage but perfect love from the husband cast out [Applause] fear you come home and the whole house is quiet you drop a needle and everybody will hear it in the neighborhood understand this perfect love love is Christ made manifest amen and this love must be in every area of our lives and service perfect love is First Corinthians 13 and the person of the Lord Jesus Christ himself let's go First Corinth when a man fell from the Covenant you'll walk into that house and you will know total fear 1 Corinthians 13 verse one though I walk I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I have not charity this charity here is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ he says if I have gift to speak in tongues and I don't have the person of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ that's the Lord Jesus in every area of your life and in every area of your service verse and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and I have all faith I could remove Mountains and the person of the Lord Jesus Christ called charity is not standing by myself and though I best all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my bone my body to be burned and I have no charity of the Lord Jesus Christ standing by myself it pro me so he's the life that must stand behind every gift he must become a living character not a Doctrine to teach but a living character amen that he suffereth long in the life of the husband he's kind [Music] he he not is not pu up does not behave himself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked think no evil rejoices not in iniquity rejoices in the truth Bears all things amen believes all things hopes all things endures all things charity never fails am the Victor himself steps into your family he steps into the darkness of your heart and he becomes the light that you project towards your family to fulfill the two commissions of a bridegroom and a father f so when the husband is dressed in perfect [Music] love it casts out all fear he will have a welcoming Aur amen he becomes a love magnet to his wife like kingers Amen in perfect love es walked in and he presented the scepter hallelujah hallelujah that day discovered something about the king that he's a loving King all he has is also mine what can I do for you even to the half of but wife by legalism but Esther jumped the law into the love of the king are you together with me hallelujah hallelujah I want your wife to jump the law into your BOS amen when the husband is dressed in perfect love it casts out fear if wife will not face a husband from the angle of a fallen Adam where the animals would fear but from the angle of the second Adam perfect love charity covering a multitude of mistakes and your wife will always be the best you'll say thank God for my wife I thank God for my wife even if the food is burned I thank God for my wife covers a multitude of mistakes even if she has burnt my cloth in C the M of SE I thank God for that's what you should always have amen as I said in the morning you come up and say ah my wife here is a wild bird yes but perfect love the M bull hallelujah hallelujah today you need to go home and humble the M amen project love towards the attitude of your wife if she's like an on Amen just project perfectly and she'll go back into the nest Hallelujah if she's like that Maniac of host Texas stand in love perfect love before her and she's going to fall at your feet and you get her up the same way Jehovah would lift up Ezekiel would lift up Daniel would lift up John Hallelujah and remember I told you he teaches us how to stand Hallelujah that's how you should hold your wife husbands must win by love and not win by Google let me Google if she does this what can I do sir you are a son of God Amen talk to God Amen pray for her teach her love her give her the opportunity to come into your image there must be some light to shine without which your family will grow up in darkness a Christian husband must stand in the path of light amen stand in the path of light stand and then that from Christ will become a light CH to your wife and that will be your glory amen praise the Lord that light amen that your wife may tap into light also feed on the light amen study pray repent fast tap into that divine power and fav before God don't allow the family to walk in your Darkness you must be in some light wake up tonight and become a real [Applause] husband are you together with me okay let us it up in the angle of the [Music] church what would she be without Christ the light of the world Zarah 14 verse listen but it shall be light I mean it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day no night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light it shall be one day we now say it was one day because the light is already comeu you don't say it shall be because the light is already come in the evening time amen am so now it come in the darkness and that light in the darkness was the light of Malachi 4 in the evening time so that the bride may find some light to help her walk out of L into the bridge okay listen here brother Bram says recall that in the first age it was almost a full of the Church of Truth yet there was a light error a little error called the Deeds of the Nikes that kept the circle from being full when then in the next age more Darkness croped until the B of light glowed less and darkness covered more of the circle in the third age it was eclipsed still still more and in the fourth age which was the Dark Ages the light had all but gone now what think of this the church shines in the reflected Light of Christ he's the son the church is the moon th this or of light is the Moon it had decreased from almost full moon in first age to Sil in the fourth but in the fifth age it began to grow in the 60th it took a great step to grow forward in part of the seventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped and way to almost nothing so that instead of light it was the Blackness of apostasy amen and at the end of the age it had ceased to shame for Darkness had taken over Christ was now outside of the church H are you together so Christ the husband of the church was out because the Moonlight which is the reflection it had weighed out completely but in the evening time it shall be light the light stepped back in again by the ministry of Malachi 4 amen there was enough light by his ministry to show the church how to get out of laia and come into here into the bridge between the ages and Eternity that's where the church is what has brought us there is the light himself to walk into the darkness of the church so in the evening time we took in enough light to shine in the darkness Hallelujah and then you were able to come out and that light is still with the Bri hallelujah hallu what do you have that light for because according to prophecy it is darkest when it's coming to morning in the evening time it was dark Christ came shine his light upon the Stars that is calling out so that they may shine in the darkness of the morning hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah do you see the bride has some light she's tapping from Christ and storing into her to shine before the morning

stayed in overnight when you are not in a house before morning it is so dark but there stands a powerful star which is Christ The Morning Star it stands out there very bright Hallelujah hallu the evening star takes the same Light Of The Morning Star and this morning star distributes his light to all the different Stars when it's coming to morning you are the morning Stars hallelujah hallelujah
