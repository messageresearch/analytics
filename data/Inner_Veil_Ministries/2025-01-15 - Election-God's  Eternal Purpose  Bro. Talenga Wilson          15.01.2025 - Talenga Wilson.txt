word of God and may obtain Grace amen amen so let's down to the Book of Genesis 2se 23 and then after that we shall turn to Malachi one and finally we shall read Romans chapter 9 the Bible says in Genesis 25:23 and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and the two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other and the Elder Shall Serve the younger Malachi chapter 1 verse 23 I have loved you says the Lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau's was not Esau Jacob's brother says the Lord yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains on his Heritage on his Heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness Romans chapter 9:3 as it is written Jacob have I loved and may the Lord bless his word we may get seated praise the Lord so the scriptures that we have read speak praise the Lord they speak about Jacob and Es and we see the mind of God towards the two he said unto Rebecca that you you have two nations in wom and two man of people one people shall be stronger than the other and the purpose of God here the thought of God was that the Elder Shall Serve the and he says that Jacob have I loved and I have hated es praise the Lord so now we notice that when God blessed Isaac with children praise the Lord and now he says there were two Nations that were in the womb of Rebecca his wife and there were two sons so there was ISAC there was es and Jacob and Jacob was the younger and Es was the Elder and we know the principle of inheritance is that the Elder praise the Lord in most cases the principle is that the Elder son becomes here but now here God was changing the principle and he said that the Elder shall instead serve theer in other words theer take possession take control The Inheritance and now the the younger would be the one that would rule over the Elder and now when the two children were born he see that they were blessed and know that Isaac loved so much is because is was a hun he was a field he used to go hunting and he could come with animals and he would Slaughter and now he would prepare for his father and his father was an old man and he loved eating the animals he loved the sweet sver used to come out of them so now when he had grown old praise the Lord he called his son es because ES by default was the one that would be the Elder that would be the hair that was the plan of Isaac praise the Lord and so he called him and says go and kill me an animal go hunt and prepare for me and then bring before me so I may eat and then I will bless you praise the Lord that was the mind that he had he wanted to bless his son over his possession but that was not the plan of God the Eternal purpose of God what was in the thoughts of God was that it had to be Jacob to take the inheritance and that es had to serve Jacob so now when the father called the mother had and now when the mother had now the mother was in the mind of God because God had spoken to her when she was still pregnant and she says you have two Nations two fighting Nations those two Nations they are made of two people those two sons in your wom take it that the younger praise the Lord will have control over the and so the Elder Shall Serve theer when came to her notice when came to her notice that now the father wanted to bless is and remember along the was were growing at some point of time es sold his birth praise the Lord and that was all the purpose of God sell his birth now when Rebecca she had to do something in order to make Jacob the rightful owner the inheritance of their father praise the Lord and now she was exactly doing the mind of God while Isaac's mind was to have the mind of God was to have Jacob beh over the inheritance of Isaac so we now see that they upbringing and their destiny was pre it was known even before they were born whatever they would own whatever life they would live was planned by God before they were even born praise the Lord so now we see that God makes the election praise the Lord who we are to be even before we are born into this world praise the Lord so now when we come into this world we come to walk according to the patterns of God so now we see that Jacob the mother praise the Lord sent him and they did something which appear to be changing ownership changing the hair that was the purpose of God they were even born praise the Lord and now for foundation be taking a tonight on the Eternal purpose of election praise the Lord election is an eternal thought an eternal purpose of God praise the Lord I want us to take our picture from the birth of es and Jacob and how their lives would be and how their lives were pre-planned how their lives were predetermined and much as they fought against each other God knew exactly how each one of them would be praise the Lord God had chosen Jacob even before he was born and does not mean that es was a bad man was a good man praise the Lord that's why his father loved him we know the saying that a bad son praise the Lord is not like of the father praise the Lord and if you have a bad son is an African saying praise the Lord that a bad son always make the mother to be abused But A Good Son always beloved of the father but we see that was loved of his father he was a good man he was very kind praise the Lord was very forgiving that's why even when Jacob came back after Jacob had taken over the inheritance but now when he came back still for for him so he was a good man so now the choice of God was not determined by how good each of the two sons would be praise the Lord the choosing of God praise the Lord is his own choice praise the Lord and he makes a choice depending on his eternal purpose praise the Lord depending on his Eternal Soul etal they were even born had chosen that Jacob regardless of his personal weaknesses regardless of his personal failures to be Jacob chose praise the Lord it to be Jacob out of him would come a nation that out of him become the people of God not because he was good but it was according to the purpose of God praise the Living God and I want say something the prophet say something about teaching praise the Lord he says that teaching positionally places the church into her position I'm trying to paraphrase it praise the Lord teaching teaching the word the pastor was teaching us last Sunday about obtaining favor praise the Lord and then he made a quation a church that is Tau right a church that know supposition in the world praise the Lord regardless of the storms she shall be grounded because she knows her position when the Ang of the Lord Vis Rebecca he told her of what the things would be she had been given the information she had been Tau of what would become of her sons so whatever was taking place she had known her position that's why when she saw that was trying to take the position she fought so hard to make sure she fought so hard to make sure that the Eternal purpose of God be established so she called Jacob and told him and says go and do this make sure you do it right and when he did it right he found himself in the position of leadership the position of a ha and he became the ha praise the Lord and now I will be teaching this subject tonight election seeing the Eternal purpose of God want see the Eternal purpose of election how is the church elected how do we find ourselves in the world how we find ourselves in the message why is it that we have been separated how is it that we have been obedient praise the Lord how is it that we are here and we are taking go at his word how is it that we are here and we are only taking the word not chasing after the worldly pleasures after the riches and the rest of them praise the Lord and now once we get the mind of election we shall take our rest for we shall know that election has nothing to do who we are praise the Lord but it is the Eternal thought of God and the prophet says in the message adoption 1960 paragraph six says Bible teaching is usually a little trous a little you know kind kind of walking out of on the thin ice we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good kind of bring the church complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother that teaching goes beyond that ESP to the church now preaching usually catches the brings him underation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and what and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are praise the Lord so until we positionally know what we are the prophet says we can never have faith enough to [Music] believe enough to stand praise the Lord just like the pastor preached last Sunday when we are Tau and we know our position in Christ praise the Lord when we know our position in Christ we then become grounded praise the Lord and that settles it so no matter the waves that shall come praise the lord we know we are anchored in the word and when the waves come our faith is anchored on the word of God the Lord so when the church is to right it positions them in the word so now going back to election God shows us before the foundation of the world that's what the Bible says it says in the book of Deuteronomy 7 verse and thou a holy people the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people and to himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth that is it he says he has chosen us to be a special people Israel chosen people of God prise the Lord above all the people upon the face of the Earth praise the Lord and to us has chosen Us by his word to be special people above all people upon the Earth praise the Lord and why has he chosen us he has chosen us because we were in him before the foundations of the world praise the lord we were in the thoughts of God in the mind of God praise the Lord before the foundation of the world what the mind of God was it never changes because God never changes his mind the thoughts of God you un a bright it shall never change praise the Lord regardless of how the world beats you if you in the mind of God you are in the mind of God and the thoughts of God as the bride of Christ it has to come to pass praise the Lord so we in the mind of God and that was the thought of God regardless of how crazy how crazy Jacob looked that was the mind of God that he had to be the leader Mind Of God had to be expressed and Jacob had to take over the inheritance had to Ser Jacob that was the word of God nobody could change it when came first had already chosen praise the Lord and loved him and it is Jacob that had to produce the 12 children of Israel praise the Living God that was the mind of God could not change so now if you are the word that was the thought of God Creation with which God created the universe with which God created everything praise the Lord if we were in the mind of God became expressed in his word when he created everything praise the Lord and now if God in his mind he purposed that there is going to be a bright sure there has to be a bright praise the Lord his word has to be expressed praise the lord we are simply walking in the footprint we simply walking in the pattern we are simply walking in the predestination simply walking in the pre plans of God your life my life was known before God known by God the foundation of the world was known by God before we were even born praise the Lord Jacob have I loved and Es have I hat before they AB he had made a choice of who he would love and who he would hate praise the Lord before we were even born you made a choice that I would love you and you would be my people praise the Lord that you would serve him and even before you were born chose he chose you that you would serve him still you serve him the Lord regardless of how far you can run God has chosen in his mind before the foundation of the world this place and serve him in this place the word of God has to be established because his word never fails and his mind never changes John 15 verse six says you have not chosen me I have chosen you election praise the Lord he chose us he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you so now where are the good works praise the Lord he has not chosen us because of the good works no sir he has chosen us because he loved us the foundation of the world says and I have ordained you and you should go and bring forth fruit and your fruit should remain and now because he has chosen us and now because he has Loved Us Praise the Lord and now he has given us his words he says now because I have chosen you and I have loved you and you have also loved my wife whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he may give it to you praise the Lord so now we have the Liberty to ask him of anything why because himself he chose us and brought us the knowledge of his word praise the Lord he chose us by himself and he brought us to the leadership by the words and now that he has placed Us in his wife by election by for knowledge by predestination then he says when you are here and you know your position you will ask of anything and whatever you shall ask in the father's name in the name of Jesus it shall be given unto you Romans 8 verse 29 for whom he did for he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among men brethren us Lord he knew us by name he knew us even before we were born and he says for he for them who he did for he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son praise the Lord now because he for us now he chooses us because the new us he calls us because the new he prepares us by his words to conform us to make us praise the Lord to change us to look like him form Us Praise the Lord to be conformed to the image of his son praise the Lord and he's not conforming any except for new you and he's not choosing you except new you praise the Lord and you can't be you cannot be conformed to the image of his son unless he for you and how did he for you because we were in the mind of him before the foundation of the world praise the Lord and he says in Ephesians 1 verse4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world he has known Us Praise the Lord God knew us knew you the foundation of the world you look at yourself and say me this person who I am no God cannot for impossible he says he for you the foundation of the world the lord he saw you the person who you would become and now because of that after he has forn you he says now I'll come and choose you I myself and God himself says he predestinated us and then he conforms us onto the image of his son praise the Lord he conforms us righte he conforms us the St of a perfect man he conforms us into the perfect image of the bride of Christ praise the Lord so the entire story of election story of election is all for God has nothing with our personal efforts it has nothing with our abilities it has nothing our poers it is all by God and for God praise the Lord according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy praise the Lord he knew us before the foundation of the world we should be holy and Without Blame before but now we look at our failures and said but how can I be holy your holiness dependent on your failures your Holiness it is because God shows you an purpose that you should be holy before him in love and how can he make you holy praise the Lord now when we fell and R short of grace before the foundation of the world God prepared himself a l it was all predestinated before the foundation of the world you known before the foundation of the world chosen of the world holy and be conformed the image of his son when he saw that there would be failure there would be weaknesses before the of the world before even the world was formed he prepared himself a lamb prise the Lord and he offered a lamb for your he offer the lamb weaknesses praise the Lord And now when he offered the lamb as a sacrifice remember it was before the found then when he looked at us and our weaknesses and failures then he presented the lamb there he presented the blood there through the blood We Are Holy without any blame praise the Lord so now we cast our our failures cast them into the blood of Jes where we cast our weaknesses we cast our weaknesses the blood of Jesus Christ and that makes us a holy people because that is the eternal God he conforms us and he makes out of us a church that is Holy without without blame before him having predestinated us the adoption of children by Christ Jes to himself according to the good pleasure of his will is by his own will praise the Lord it is by his will that each of us comes to knowledge of the truth praise the Lord it is by his own pleasure of his own will that each of us is called into Christ Jesus to be to the to the praise of the glory of his grace where he has made us accepted in the blood in whom we have Redemption through the through his blood now remember the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world do you believe that yes sir that's what says and now because of sin when we Sinn God had to make the expression of what was in his mind the of the world when he offered the lamb the Lord so to offer Jesus Christ as a lamb die for our as the physical manifestation as the physical expression of that which was in the mind of God as an atonement for our sins and now he says after now he has given up the lamb upon the cross we now have Redemption we have the Forgiveness of sins through his blood praise the lord we have victory over our personal weaknesses through his blood the blood of Jesus Christ is what Aton for our sins having made know unto us the mystery of his will verse 9 according to his good pleasure which he hased in himself everything about us is because God purposed it in him praise the Lord everything about you is because God planned it because God did it for you before the foundation of the world praise the Lord so now we are the Bride of Jesus Christ not because we joined the church not because we joined in Tabernacle not because we have good manners not because we were good people in the denominations and God chose us there are good people there good character but God left them and he chose you because you are in the mind of God the foundation of the world is all by election you are in the word because of election you are a Believer because of election because of election and you are being conformed to the image of his son by election praise the Lord not because we are good because we were with him in his mind when the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the waters you were with him praise the Lord and when he says oh it is good that I separate the water praise the Lord from the land you in his mind the Lord And now when he came and said now I have separated the land from the waters and he says me separate from the you in his mind when he says let be it was in his mind the Lord because darkness and were in the mind of God and water in the mind of and now when they all mixed up he saw them and then he says let my mind become my word and let my word be expressed and now his mind his s came expressed when he say Let There be and it was that was in his thought and now his thought was being expressed prise the Lord we were in the mind of God and now we become the expression of the mind of God in The Bride of Jesus Christ because he says he has to have a bride there has to be a bride because there has to be a rupture is been a rupture what is to be in the rupture there has to be a in the rupture Lord and the rupture in the mind of God the punish of the world is to make up the Rapture there has to be a bright praise the Lord there has be an expression of the word of God is the Bride of Jesus Christ so we were in the mind of Christ and now we are the of the mind of God for our day because it says in the evening time praise the Lord there has to be light you are the light say we are the light of the world and the Bible says in the evening time it shall be light where is that light you that light I am that light the expression of the thoughts of God praise the Living God so now you are who you are the elect of God by for knowledge predestination because you were known in the mind of God before you did exist praise the Lord and now the plan of has to be established regardless of the Fall when the fall was there the purpose of God had to be established praise the Lord that's why God had to choose Abraham praise the Lord Abraham was living with his family his people and they were worshiping other God but God had seen Abraham and out of Abraham there had be there had to come God's people there had to come the nation Israel praise the Lord and now God came to him and called him and said Abraham come here how did Abraham recognize the voice because Abraham at one moment was part of that voice prise The Lord At One Moment Abraham was in the mind of God part of the word so even if he had gotten lost when he heard the voice the voice sounded familiarise the Lord God him you come he didn't know where he was going but because he had a voice he knew he was home the voice was speaking peace The Voice spoke peace over his life The Voice spoke life over his life spoke life praise the Lord and he was an old man and when he had a voice he could not help it but he followed the voice why because my sheep know my voice when I called say hear my voice my sheep know my because you are part of him in the mind of God of the world we heard his voice were able toize that this is the voice of the master without contention without arguments each of us followed the voice not because we had much knowledge of no sir because we were part of the we are born into this and the voice is simply aling us simply aligning us to the Eternal purpose of God praise God so now the bride simply walks right into her position by The Voice praise the Lord because this voice is the same voice which the world was created praise the Lord is the same voice with which and by which everything came into existence praise the Living God and now we notice that when we recogize this voice and we come into this voice in Union with this voice when God created he created Adam to go out and replenish the the world and F the Earth and have dominion and have control everything in the Earth was subjectto him because in him was that word was the power of God in him was ability to have dominion so when he came before the Lions the Lions P leverence when he came before the cheaters and all those fearce animals subject unto him there was no fear in the life of of Adam because the power of God rested in and we know that we are moving back that which we lost the word of God is calling us back to inherit to get back our possession which Satan had stolen from us that's why when the man of God when the man of God when he had come into the mind of God had come to the thought of God come to the power of God one time when he was moving that's in the message when love when when love projects Sovereign Grace takes over he said was going somewhere then he he took a shortcut to go pray for someone shortcut was a fierce animal was a bull was so giant that it had killed so many people en crushed on his territory he he was killed then the prophet finds himself in the territory of this bu and then he was aright but then he remembers praise the Lord that he had been reconciled to that position which Adam had lost prise the Lord he recognized that he had been reconciled the position that man had lost the then he spoke to him and says I have no I have I don't have any problem with you but then remember I was created to have dominion I was created to rule over the Earth everything has be subject because in me is the word of God is the power of God as he spoke to him praise the Lord the bull recognized the power of God in the prophet praise the Lord and he took a step back and he sat down and the prophet went his way being reconciled to that we are being reconciled to that position which we lost in Adam praise the Lord where there shall be no fear in our lives where they shall be an assurance of who we are where there shall be an assurance of our position in Christ praise the Lord that's why he saying that because you were chosen because you are predestinated to be conformed and Sons praise the Lord to regain your position regain your control regain your Dominion when you ask anything in his name it shall be given unto you when the prophet spoke to theal in the name of Jesus Christ subject why he had taken over his control because the word of God was established in his life when the word of God get established in our lives it shall cast out every fear praise the Lord he shall establish Us Praise the Lord in the power of His might the prophet was still preaching and now here came the mad man who was possessed and then he came straight and he was coming to fight him he was determined to kill him and now there were some police officers who he had just prayed for and they had seen this man before this man had killed so many people and now they were rushing to get a hold a giant prise the Lord but because the prophet he had recognized the power of God in him he recognized that this what which we believe as power as dominion over every Power and principali he said the police officers leave him leave him to be and then the man came straight and he wanted to kill him praise the Lord and the prophet looked at him with love he looked at him with love because God is love praise the Lord and because God is love the love of God was shared in the life of Bram and he looked at the man was defending that the love there was power that came out of the love of and instantly the man found him himself on his on the ground and he fell and the people saw the hand of the Lord not because was so powerful because recognized the hand of the Lord power of God rested upon his word and as long as we have the word of God reconciled the word of God we have the same power because Jesus says Greater Works than these shall you do praise the Lord and he says you shall ask anything in his name and it shall be established praise the Lord if we have the word of godos in the word of God settles it praise the Lord and this message is establishing us is establishing the bright is bringing the bright into that image is bring the bright in the manifestation praise the Lord say that Christ once again is made manifest in this body of the praise the Living God I want to quote something here it is all by election it is all by predestination praise the lord we were in the Eternal thoughts of God that's why here and if we can know that we are here that we are the elect that we are the bright that we are the word of God being expressed being manifested in the end times then that will settle it because if we are the expressed Mind Of God we know the mind of God is eternal if the mind of God is eternal the expression of the mind of God that makes us Eternal so we can never fail praise the lord we shall have failures we have battles when recognize power of the word of God we shall sail over and above all the weaknesses All the Troubles all the fights in this body he says you a chosen people he has chosen us to live above and over all the people of the earth says praise Living God I want to quote something here The Message God has the provided way Abraham thech the patriarch come down out of sh away from the Tower of Babel father joury down into the pl [Music] down into the Plains and there Abraham at the age of about 75 years old God called him by election and sent him out of his country telling him that he was going to have a child his wife Sarah who was 65 years old the time I want you to see how God's promises are so real to those who will accept it and he told him what he was going to do and he moved out not knowing where he was going but so Jed in a Strange Land God when he calls people he calls for total separation all the things of the world from the worldly things separate yourself and God will bless come out from among them and be notak of their and Abraham had to take his wife and leave the country but he believed God by faith he couldn't reason it out there is no way of finding how he ever do it there's no he can find out how Abraham could ever believe it just to God by his word and now how could God ever bless Abraham son at that age you couldn't explain it how his wife lived with lived with her since he was a young girl both of them young healthy people all these days till she was then 45 or 60 probably 25 years and God said you going to have a baby by this woman Abraham believed God against all reason that's what we ow to all reason against all scientific research against all scientifical foundations we just have to believe God the Bible says there is going to be a bride who will fure in the Rapture and the bride will be taken away and yet science says we are simply pulled towards the center of the Earth because of gravity but because of faith we believe that the bride shall be taken away and shall work against the scientifical Foundation because God say so I believe it has to be established that's how Abraham believed God at his word take God at his word his word shall be established in our lives praise the Living God and another message the calling of Abraham he says friends if you have received the Holy Spirit you are Sons and Daughters of God you are the seed of abrah and Jo with him and God and the same face in Abraham is in every belie tonight hallelujah hallelujah God by his Amazing Grace called you out of the SL of the world and give you the Holy Ghost not because you deserved it he says I have chosen you not because you deserved it but he has chosen us because he loved us and he says he has chosen Us Praise the Lord not because we were good he wasn't good he has called you out not because you are good or because you deserved it because he called you to eat unconditionally not because you are good you weren't good but because not because your mother was saved that's all right but you you are another individual that's right God called you by election because he knew us before the foundation of the world praise the Living God church he says Church AG qu in John 67 and verse4 says verse 37 says all that the father give me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I shall in no wayse cast out all that the father has given me so it is the father in The Eternal purpose of the father that would choose you and call you out and present you unto Christ believe Jesus Christ Christ says the father has chosen us before the foundation of the world has brought us to the word which is Jesus Christ there is nowh the word can reject us the Lord there is no way the world so the word will lose us if you have been called because you were known before called the word the word of God lose you so you have been called to be established against all all orders all powers any sin that ever existed in the world because Jesus said them that the father has called and given me I shall not lose now I shall not lose even a single one praise the Lord no man come to me except the father draw him and I raise him up at the last day and John 1 ver3 says but as many has received him who are those that received him those that were chosen predestinated before the foundation of the world praise the Lord that they would receive him and as many as received him them gave he the power to become the sons of God those that were elected praise the Lord he gave us the power to be the sons of God you are predestinated a son of God you predestinated be of God the foundation of the world so we are here not by mistake we are here by election because he knew us because he loved us so he called us Jesus Christ and Christ is very careful not to lose anyone of us so that's the assurance that you have because he has chosen you and he has elected you so you're not going to be lost praise the Lord you won't be lost so you just have to submit yourself through the leadership of the Holy Spirit the by the F by the word you live by the word you speak by the word by the word you overcome the word by the word being established in the word of God praise the Lord which and he says to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name were born now listen to this we know that we were born by the blood of our mothers we know the process of of being born water blood and life we know there is something that ruptures and then water flows to prepare a life that is coming another thing ruptures and blood comes out then baby is born says that we were born not of that blood we simply we simply pass through it but the of God not that we should be born by that blood praise the Lord and says nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God are born of the will of God according to his own good pleasure Ephesians 1 verse says according as he has chosen Us in him before the found of the world we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so when we are born into this world praise the Lord and we have tested of sin T of iniquity that was not purose of God because in him we were born holy without any blame God he has known Us in in him before the foundation of the world and he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame having predestinated us and through the adoption of children by Christ Jesus to himself praise the Lord now without getting follow the prophet says without getting involved into the subject of sovereignity into the subject of sovereignity of God he says for that would take a book in itself let me point out where here that according to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own price just the same as men would their Brides today Jesus Christ is choosing his the same way a man would choose his what is the principle when the man is choosing the bride the man who chooses the girl to take to be a wife it is not the girl that chooses the praise the Lord even if she loved him but if he has not chosen her she can't be a wife praise the Lord so now the choice is for the bridegroom choice is not for the bright let's catch this mystery that God God is choosing is not because we loved him so much no sir it's because he loved us and he chose us praise the Lord God is choosing it's not because we are so good sir it's because he simply loved us says the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom who choose who decides chooses a certain woman for his and John 15 ver says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you you did not choose me but I Choose You the bridegroom shows himself the bride he chose us by himself praise the Lord our position is by election our position is because he loved us and he chose us praise the Lord not according to the word of God the bride was chosen for the foundation of the world now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world you believe that that's what the scripture says we were chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the Bride wased in himself and he quotes Romans 91 that the purpose of God according to election stand the purose of God go choosing the bright according to election that she was in him before the foundation of the world stand you can't read it any purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world that's why says Jacob have i l Jacob did not have a choice to be loved it was the choice of God he love Jacob and Es did not do any wrong for God to hate him it was the purpose of God he loved Jacob and rejected theose of God he loved you and rejected the world our choice the choosing of the Bride is in the etal purpose of God and in the message the door inside the door 1960 I quote paragraph 59 or if you would just look behind IND our shoulder and see how good God is been to us just see his goodness to this to The Sinner to see that he's brought yourself th far sitting in your right hand sitting in your right hand look back who fed you who closed you when those brakes were were squeaking and the car almost rammed you no no no no when the breaks of the car and almost red you who protected you then who was that that hour of sickness when the doctor shook his head and said I don't know no more to do but you are right here tonight look back a little piece and see what happened to you Christian just take a look around and see the sinful world how it is and to know that God the foundation of the world chose you by election put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and knocked at your heart and you opened up and let him come in how good he is in the paragra 6 I quote l i stand at the door and knock and if you open the door I'll come into to you and will with you St with him and him with me means to entertain to have Fellowship one with another is to have communion Fellowship one with another can you open your heart every day of your life and say Lord com just don't only be my savior but be my Lord Be My Ruler be my controller take me what I am just as I am without one ple buty blood was shed for me just as I Am Lord I will believe you that's what the prophet says he says open your door open your heart and say Lord don't just come mean but be my savior be my Lord Be My Ruler be my controller in this world that is full of sin control me take me what I am just I am without that thy blood was shed for me amen and again he says another message future home of the bridegroom and bride quote 237 if you got eternal life listen closely if you got eternal life there is only one form that is God and you are unexpressed attribute your unexpressed attribute if you are not are not going to be there praise the Lord he says your unexpressed attribute if you got eternal life in other words if the spirit of God is within you you got the Holy Spirit which is the eternal life praise the Lord the life of God in you he says now you are unexpressed attribute that's what it is the holy spirit is the expression of the Life of Christ in our lives so if you got it you're now unexpressed attribute you are not you're not going to be there you're not going to be part of the rapture you're not going to be part of the millenni no man can come to me except my father has drawn see which passes away all these old things but these things don't so it speaks of Eternity the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in eternity you are in eternity says if you have the Holy Ghost if you have the Life of Christ if you have the word of God in your life which we believe we have because how did we believe his word without the Holy Spirit praise the Lord it has to be the holy spirit to guide us to the words it has to be the holy spirit to guide us to believe the Holy Ghost to give us the faith believe his word how did Abraham believe it had be God himself comp Abraham to have faith believe God how you believe it has to be God it has to be God who compell you to believe his words no man can come to me except the father has drawn him to praise the Lord so the prophet says if you have the Holy Ghost then you are Eternal and you shall be etern praise the Lord and I want say this if you have believ the word of God praise the Lord and you've taken go that his word you believe you been baptized God promised that if you believe and you baptized you shall be given the token of the Holy Spirit that's the promise so now if we have the Holy Spirit that means we are Eternal because the Holy Ghost is eternal and him being in US makes us Eternal brother you shall be there not because of your choice because God chose you you have to be there because if he chose us to be in him that means he has to give us the Holy Spirit and if he gives us the holy spirit that means we have to be there expression of eternal life expression of the Life of Christ in this body praise the Lord he says you are in eternity where you was all the time because you we we are in the mind of God as Eternal we expressed in the mind of God as Eternal we in his mind why because God and his mind one can separate you and your mind you and your mind are one person the mind of God is eternal and we are the expression of the mind of God we are Eternal you can never fail praise the Lord is a gift God elected Us by election he chose us to be who we are today praise the Lord are you happy to be here today are you happy to be a part of the words praise the Lord do you believe that you are the chosen one that you are known the foundation of the world praise the Lord and he says see you are made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of the attribute that was in God that thought that thought of you and expressed you it thought of you and says let us create man praise the Lord And now when that thought was expressed Man became the expression of the thought and man came into existence so Man became the manifestation of the attribute that was in God Eternal that makes you eternal seed of God is but Eternal the seed of God is eternal praise the Lord and says and expressed you and made an earth to take you out and to make you a human being and then sin come along and perverted his way come but you was lost praise the Lord because in the expression of God in the mind of God we would be born by the word the way Jesus Christ was born it was the word that came unto Mary and says you shall bear a son and that word was expressed in the wom of Mary when she produced the body of Jesus it was the expression of the word came from God through the angel the womb of Mary the prophet says here that we would be expressed we would manifest we be manifested the same manner somehow sin come along and perverted his way then you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you the expressed attribute redeem you the expressed attribute and also redeems you and redeems this Earth by the same way then his purpose rolls on oh see hallelujah hallelujah oh that that does me so good of just that lays ahead now in Ephesians 110 says now if you are putting it down it's called not a dispensation it is called not not day is the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulf when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the S AG is over and it is praise the Lord is over is over pcal age is over now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other you are in eternity where there is no such time as numbers and times and things oh my you see it now all after time has been fulfilled all sin is gone taken away at the Millennium at the at the great white Throne judgment Jud a typ by the Holy Ghost after the world is on fire and bed of the holy fire from heaven all sin is gone all gone all devil is gone all temptation is gone all evil is gone then what does do he can upon the see because all sin is gone that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost he can he can come and dwell with you and we can sit in Heavenly places Jes when he gives us the Holy Spirit he comes to dwell in US praise the Lord because that is his eternal purpose the Lord that we be conformed to be like him and we can't be conformed to be like him if we don't have his life in so now he gives us the Holy Spirit to dwell in us and dwell with us we can now sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him now not we will we are now sitting in Christ Jesus now do we get it do we get how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one Spirit we all baptized into Christ which we are now won't be in Christ we are he is the great spiritual King over the spirit that is in us over the spirit because we were in him at the beginning and I want take my last quot you believe that he says we were in him the beginning now he comes back to us to live in US reconcile us back to take us back to live in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus God in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that and thought of others like that thought of himself of being tangible that was his thought see so he expressed his thoughts by what he wanted to be tangible God being expressed in us because before he was the the Eternal God praise the Lord inang but now he expressed his thoughts by what and said let there be let there be and there was and there was and the word expressed in form of a body to make Adam praise the Lord and to make ad and on and on now here we are but in the v bodies because the first Adam fell and came short of that Glory but through Christ Jesus the ET purose of God is reestablished in us and we become the word the word expressed once again because the same word that was the express thought of God in the beginning is once again expressed in the bright to make us the expressed Eternal thoughts of God in because he is the Al he was in the beginning and he is the Omega he is with us in this day praise the Lord expressing himself in the bright the fullness of time has come praise the Lord in paragraph 246 of the same message as we finish the fullness of time has come after time has been fulfilled is gone after the world is baptism after the world baptism makes it f Place sicks then his attributes is expressed because it was there first to begin with that's what he s praise the Lord and then what happened he set Adam and Eve on the earth multiply and now replenish the Earth and their bodies was all laid out there for you to eat and make your body that's the way he had of doing it but sin come along and interrupted his plan but what did Jesus do came down and expressed himself in the form of a man a human being gave his life remember this was the etal purpose of God he laid the foundation that he laid the lamb and he slew the lamb before the foundation of the world this is what the prophet is saying Jesus came down and expressed himself in the form of a man being a human he gave his life for what reconcile us back and reestablish us to the position that we lost in Adam praise the Lord and now it is all over and it's put right back God's purpose is fulfilled and there is the Eternal King once again his eternal subjects together with him Eternal subjects his eternal subjected in flesh bright exactly the way he did it sin is took away and the devil is now done estaing theal purpose of God was to have the bright expressed and we are the bright has been expressed he has taken us back to that position which you lost in Adam now we are back in we are back and now we are seated in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus why because we have him we have him in our lives we have the word of God in our lives we have the Holy Spirit and when you get this Holy Spirit it sets us up seated in Heavenly places toship to have fellow with him which was the Eternal purpose of God creation was to worship him now we are being reinstated back to that position and we are simply waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God we simply waiting for the Rapture praise the Lord to be with him to see him right now he is with us because he's in us we are with him although we can't see him but at that time praise the Lord as manifestation we shall see him as he is praise the Lord and we shall see him and we shall have fellow with him and we shall serve him day and night because sin shall be done with we shall live with him and we are living at that time are living in that time right has been reinstated back to her position not by anything else but by election because
