[12:50] discourages praise the name of our Lord
[12:52] there are those married
[12:54] people who habitually don't
[12:57] attend
[13:02] I think that is not good praise the name

[13:07] conscious because if the meetings if the
[13:10] meetings are

[15:47] a
[15:50] meal your own so you put 10,000 for the
[15:54] cause of another person being
[15:57] f I hope we should be generous also in
[16:00] that
[16:02] course praise the name of our Lord so we
[16:05] just keep on praying for one
[16:07] another that the Lord may keep us in the
[16:11] faith praise the name of our Lord so

[16:37] Saints and today we are bringing back
[16:40] the
[16:41] baby on the altar of
[16:45] God that we can to God who gave us that
[16:51] gift may God bless you sing bring them
[16:54] in US brother and sister brings their
[16:59] child for
[17:03] dedication bring them
[17:08] in bring them
[17:12] in
[17:15] bring in from the fields of
[17:21] sin bring them
[17:26] in bring them
[17:30] be bring down wondering ones to
[17:38] Jes bring them in bringing them
[17:44] in bring them
[17:48] in bring them in from the fields of
[17:57] SE bring them
[18:01] in bring them
[18:06] in bring the wondering ones to
[18:14] Jesus amen praise the name of our
[18:17] Lord we are a
[18:19] church that is established on the Bible
[18:24] truth and we do the best we can by the
[18:27] grace of God
[18:30] to stand on what the scripture
[18:33] says because that's where God is
[18:39] exalted in many denominational
[18:43] churches they bring little children like
[18:45] this
[18:47] one to be
[18:49] baptized but there is nobody who was
[18:52] baptized at that age in the
[18:55] Bible even our Lord Jesus Christ
[18:59] when he was young at that
[19:02] age they brought him in the
[19:04] temple for a
[19:07] dedication and because he was a
[19:10] male they circumcised him on the eth
[19:14] day but he wasn't
[19:17] baptized it was until Christ was
[19:21] mature that's when he was
[19:24] baptized and now the Bible tells us that
[19:28] he that
[19:30] believeth praise the name of our Lord
[19:33] the one who conf who
[19:35] believeth and then he
[19:38] confesses this little
[19:41] boy cannot
[19:43] believe cannot
[19:45] confess therefore cannot be
[19:48] baptized so here when they when they
[19:51] brought the children to
[19:53] Christ in Matthew
[19:56] 19 and then verse 13
[19:59] the Bible says then were there brought
[20:03] unto him little children that he should
[20:06] put his hands on them and pray and the
[20:09] disciples rebuked
[20:26] them but Jesus said
[20:28] suffer little children and forine them
[20:31] not for unto for come unto me for such
[20:35] is the kingdom
[20:46] of and he laid his hands on them and
[20:49] departed
[20:52] them so Jesus Just prayed for
[20:56] them this what we going to do for the
[20:58] baby
[21:02] [Music]
[21:06] here this is baby
[21:11] jul the Lord has given us a gift to the
[21:14] home of our brother and his

[21:56] prophet of yours
[21:59] and here is Julius coming before you

[22:04] of Jesus
[22:06] Christ bind all forces and all powers of
[22:10] Darkness all Wicked Spirits allil plans

[24:02] think our c is becoming too
[24:11] small but God give us
[24:14] Grace and maybe those who don't have
[24:16] babies
[24:18] also you should leave the crime for the
[24:22] babies leave the cry for the
[24:26] mothers

[24:48] prayer father in the name of the Lord

[26:46] chapter
[26:49] 6 praise the name of our

[26:56] overnight
[26:58] brother
[26:59] Eric from
[27:01] B he took these same
[27:05] scriptures and then I was
[27:08] inspired that I should take it
[27:11] father praise the name of the Lord so
[27:14] Ephesians chapter
[27:16] 6 from verse 10 to verse
[27:20] 18 the Bible says finally my brethren be
[27:25] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[27:27] His
[27:34] put on the whole armor of God that you
[27:38] may be able to stand against the Ws of
[27:42] the
[27:49] devil for weest not against flesh and
[27:52] blood but against prosperities against
[27:56] Powers against l rulers of Darkness of
[27:58] this world against spiritual wickedness
[28:01] in high
[28:15] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[28:18] armor of God that you may be able to
[28:20] withand in the evil day and having done
[28:23] all to
[28:26] stand
[28:37] stand therefore having your loin got
[28:40] about with truth and having on the
[28:42] breastplate
[28:51] of and your feet showed with the
[28:54] preparation of the gospel of peace
[28:58] [Music]
[29:05] above all taking the shield of Faith
[29:08] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[29:11] all the fairy DS of the
[29:26] wi
[29:31] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[29:33] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[29:44] God praying always with all prayer and
[29:48] supplication in the spirit and watching
[29:51] there un with all perseverance and
[29:54] supplication for All Saints
[30:19] amen may God blessing of his
[30:22] word amen I want to draw your attention
[30:29] to verse
[30:32] 13 which
[30:35] says wherefore take unto the whole armor
[30:39] of
[30:43] God that you may be able to withand in
[30:47] the evil
[30:50] day so my subject
[30:53] is ability to withand Satan
[31:05] praise the name of the Lord we need
[31:09] ability to withand
[31:12] Satan praise the name of our Lord and
[31:15] that's why you've come to
[31:17] church that we can be
[31:20] equipped praise the name of the Lord
[31:23] that we can be
[31:24] trained that we can be prepared
[31:28] that we can be
[31:31] energized praise the name of the Lord
[31:33] that we can be raled
[31:37] to how is the devil
[31:39] doing what kind of ways is he doing and
[31:43] you see the Bible says that he has fairy
[31:49] DS fa
[31:52] DS and it's not only
[31:55] one but there are so many many ds he
[31:59] has and the Bible has told
[32:02] us that now Satan
[32:05] now he has a sphere of
[32:09] operation you know in verse
[32:13] 12 the Bible
[32:16] says okay before we go to verse
[32:19] 12 it says in verse
[32:22] 11 that we the devil has got Wes
[32:29] the ones of the
[32:31] devil then he has
[32:34] DS and then not only having those kind
[32:37] of
[32:38] things but then in verse
[32:41] 12 he says we don't wrestle against
[32:44] flesh and
[32:47] blood but against
[32:51] prosperities against
[32:54] Powers against rulers of Darkness of
[32:57] this
[32:58] world against spiritual wickedness in
[33:02] high
[33:04] places and you see when you look at the
[33:08] scriptures when for example you go and
[33:10] look at the the dream of
[33:14] NE he dreamed that a a kind of terrible
[33:19] image stood before
[33:22] him and then it had the hand of
[33:25] God and then it had the shoulders and
[33:28] the arms of
[33:32] silver and then it had the stomach or
[33:34] the belly and the thighs you know of
[33:38] [Music]
[33:40] brass and then it had the legs and the
[33:43] toes of clay and
[33:47] iron and then it was depicting the four
[33:50] Gentile
[33:52] Kingdom that are going to be here on
[33:55] Earth then we see that the head of
[33:59] God was the Babylonian
[34:02] Kingdom praise the name of our Lord and
[34:05] then now we see in in the scriptures
[34:09] here that you know when Daniel was
[34:13] praying when we go to the Book of
[34:16] Daniel praise the name of our Lord and
[34:19] then Daniel had
[34:23] prayed and you see his prayers were held
[34:29] back and then the angel came down and
[34:32] told
[34:33] him that you see God heard your
[34:39] prayers in Daniel chapter
[34:46] 10 and then verse
[34:49] 12 then he said unto me fear not Daniel
[34:53] for from the first day that th did set
[34:56] thine heart to understand and chasten
[34:58] thyself before thy God thy words were
[35:01] heard and I am come for thy
[35:25] words and then the angel tells him in
[35:28] verse
[35:30] 13 which is my
[35:33] interest but the prince of the kingdom
[35:36] of persa with stod me one and 12 days
[35:40] but L Michael one of the chief princes
[35:43] came to help me and I remain there with
[35:46] the kings of
[35:55] Persia
[36:09] now we see in Daniel chapter
[36:12] 10 and then in verse one he says in the
[36:17] third of
[36:20] cus king of p a thing was revealed unto
[36:24] Daniel whose name was called B other and
[36:27] the thing was true but the time
[36:30] appointed was long and he understood the
[36:32] thing and had understanding of
[36:55] theion
[37:05] now he says in the third year of cus
[37:08] king of
[37:11] pers now cus was the king here on
[37:15] Earth praise the name of our Lord a
[37:18] physical
[37:19] Kingdom but then there is also an
[37:22] spiritual
[37:24] Kingdom that governs the physical
[37:26] kingdoms that we have here on
[37:29] us and then this is where in verse 13
[37:33] comes that the prince of the kingdom of
[37:38] Persia so much as we have the lul here
[37:41] on
[37:43] us but then there are
[37:46] rulers who are in a spiritual Kingdom
[37:49] over the kingdoms of
[37:53] the and this is where the Bible has told
[37:55] us in eans CH
[37:59] 6 and then verse
[38:02] 12 that we don't wrestle against the
[38:05] Flesh and
[38:07] Blood about we don't wrestle against the
[38:10] rulers of this
[38:13] Kingdom we don't wrestle against you
[38:16] know the physical leadership that we
[38:19] have but yet there is a spiritual
[38:22] leadership there is a spiritual
[38:25] Kingdom then is calling them the
[38:29] principalities the powers the rulers of
[38:33] Darkness of this
[38:34] world the spiritual
[38:37] wickedness so then you see that this is
[38:40] where Satan stands in
[38:43] now when the scripture says the prince
[38:45] of
[38:47] pers it is talking about
[38:50] Satan as the spiritual ruler of the
[38:55] world Bible says when Jesus was telling
[38:59] them that the prince of the world is
[39:02] coming he was talking about
[39:05] Satan praise the name of our Lord so now
[39:08] every time a kingdom changes here on
[39:12] Earth Satan takes the name of the
[39:15] current
[39:17] Kingdom when it was the kingdom of
[39:20] Babylon Satan was the prince of
[39:23] Babylon when was the kingdom of pers
[39:27] Satan was the prince of pass and right
[39:31] now it's the kingdom of this world and
[39:34] Satan is the prince of the
[39:37] world praise the name of our Lord I want
[39:39] us to get that
[39:41] scripture praise the name of our Lord
[39:43] let us go to John chapter
[39:47] 16 John chapter
[39:55] 16
[39:59] praise the name of our
[40:03] Lord John chapter
[40:05] 16 and let me get that
[40:16] verse let us start from
[40:19] verse verse
[40:25] 8
[40:27] and when he is come he will reprove the
[40:29] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[40:32] Judgment of sin because they believe not
[40:34] on me of righteousness because I go to
[40:37] my father and you see me no more of
[40:39] judgment because the prince of this
[40:41] world is
[40:55] judged
[41:07] praise the name of the Lord he says the
[41:10] prince of this
[41:13] world and that is none other than the
[41:17] devil and Satan
[41:20] now he has the way he handles his
[41:25] systems
[41:27] praise the name of our Lord so the
[41:30] prince of this
[41:31] world is
[41:34] Satan and so Satan has also deployment
[41:37] in different
[41:39] places praise the name of the Lord he
[41:42] has his
[41:43] deployment in all avenues of this
[41:47] life in all spheres of this
[41:51] life he has
[41:53] deployment he has deployment in politics
[41:57] he has deployment in
[41:59] religion he has deployment in
[42:02] business he has deployment in night
[42:07] life praise the name of our Lord you
[42:10] know in the villages we used to
[42:14] fear we
[42:15] know
[42:18] dancers but you know that Satan has put
[42:20] night dancers also in
[42:24] towns they get a building like this and
[42:27] then the night dancers
[42:29] come and they dance at night the whole
[42:33] night spiritual wickedness in Dark
[42:37] Places so he has got deployment in every
[42:42] place night dancers are not only in The
[42:46] Villages but they also have licenses to
[42:48] dance at
[42:51] night praise the name of our Lord he has
[42:55] deployment so now we see that the
[42:57] kingdoms of this
[42:59] world are right now of the
[43:03] devil they are led by the
[43:06] devil so now that's why you must have
[43:12] ability to Satan because he in every
[43:18] sphere wherever you go he will be
[43:22] there not that Satan himself but his
[43:26] demons will be there because Satan is
[43:30] not
[43:35] omnipresent Satan is not
[43:40] omot Satan is not
[43:44] omnicient but when you speak
[43:46] something then Satan knows what you are
[43:49] planning and that's why brother bam says
[43:53] if I'm going to do
[43:54] anything I keep it in my heart but when
[43:57] you mention it then Satan knows oh so
[44:01] then he starts working against
[44:04] that that's why the Seven
[44:08] Seals the seventh
[44:10] seal the mystery was
[44:13] hidden that Satan doesn't
[44:17] understand what is this SE
[44:19] about praise the name of the Lord the
[44:22] coming of the Lord God has hidden it
[44:26] say that Satan doesn't understand what
[44:30] is the time is coming what is the why is
[44:32] coming but then he telling us be you
[44:36] ready praise the name of our Lord be
[44:39] ready because you don't know the time he
[44:42] com now
[44:45] Satan will always come to your
[44:49] level that's what he does if you are in
[44:53] school he will come as a student he will
[44:56] come with the environment that you're
[44:57] live in if you're a business person also
[45:01] come as a
[45:03] colleague if you are a farmer you also
[45:06] come like
[45:07] that if you
[45:09] religious you also come
[45:12] religious he comes to your
[45:15] level when he met Jesus Christ he didn't
[45:19] tell him about
[45:21] sh he didn't tell him about you know
[45:24] things which are contrary to the
[45:28] but then he told him you are
[45:30] hungry and this is how Satan approaches
[45:33] us he comes in your
[45:37] weakness the thing that you
[45:39] desire and that's how Satan comes by
[45:42] place when he got Christ was
[45:46] hungry and then he said but the market
[45:48] is
[45:50] far you know you you can't go to the
[45:53] town and buy any
[45:54] food in the desert then said but there
[45:58] stones here and you are the Son of God
[46:01] let the stones be
[46:05] bright he always comes down where you
[46:09] are being kind of
[46:11] challenged and he tries to give you good
[46:15] suggestions he tries to pretend giving
[46:17] you good
[46:20] suggestions That's what Satan
[46:22] does so when Jesus told him about the
[46:25] word
[46:27] then he said it's time to go for
[46:30] church and the Bible says in Matthew
[46:33] chapter 4 he took Jesus to the
[46:38] temple he didn't take him to the
[46:41] shrine he took him to the
[46:45] temple now who want to go to the
[46:47] temple who want to go to the temple but
[46:52] Jesus was taken to the temple
[46:56] Satan and when Satan took Jesus to the
[46:59] temple he went and quoted Psalms
[47:05] 91 it is
[47:07] written and now the Bible also tells
[47:10] us that Satan has changed
[47:15] himself as an angel of
[47:19] Light praise the name of our Lord let us
[47:22] go to Second
[47:24] Corinthians second
[47:28] Corinthians and then we read in chapter
[47:34] 10 okay I beg your pardon 2 Corinthians
[47:37] 11 and then verse
[47:48] 13 for such are false Apostles deceitful
[47:52] workers transforming themselves into
[47:55] into the Apostles of
[48:08] Christ and Marvel and no Marvel for
[48:11] Satan himself is transformed into an
[48:14] angel of
[48:22] Light therefore it no great thing if his
[48:25] ministry also be transformed as
[48:28] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[48:30] shall be according to their works
[48:33] [Music]
[48:51] so amen praise the name of our Lord he
[48:55] says they are false
[48:57] Apostles and they have been transformed
[49:01] themselves as Apostles of
[49:04] Christ even Satan has transformed
[49:07] himself as an angel of
[49:10] life and then he comes this is the
[49:14] truth so now Satan always uses
[49:19] deception to lure
[49:24] us that's what does now in the message
[49:29] life praise the name of our Lord he
[49:38] says and the first
[49:41] thing okay let us start from here it
[49:44] says it is a
[49:46] spirit them women don't mean they don't
[49:49] realize what they are
[49:52] doing like when you walk moving was
[49:57] naked they live their
[49:59] homes short
[50:02] things tight
[50:04] dresses and they walking on the
[50:07] streets it is a
[50:09] spirit Spirit of the world anointing the
[50:13] women to move out when they have no
[50:16] respect for
[50:18] themselves and then he
[50:21] says the first thing you know they start
[50:26] a little
[50:28] bit then a little bit
[50:31] more
[50:33] and is
[50:38] so
[50:41] yes just so
[50:45] sub it comes
[50:47] in it is so
[50:54] beautiful
[50:56] [Music]
[50:59] and that's the way it takes
[51:02] you
[51:04] Satan is
[51:07] attacking he you know releasing his
[51:11] DS he releasing his
[51:15] Welles you know so you get
[51:19] enticed and you want to be like the
[51:22] world oh I need to be a corporate
[51:28] so there's a dress that they have to put
[51:30] on short things above their
[51:35] knees and then sometimes when you get
[51:37] some working
[51:40] sisters on coming to church they have
[51:43] the dresses which are
[51:46] acceptable but when you go to their
[51:48] places of
[51:49] work they put on corporate
[51:52] dresses show off when
[51:56] you something you know it is a spirit
[51:59] that has taken a hold of the
[52:02] people now in the message wisdom versus
[52:09] Faith he says now look Satan could
[52:14] scientifically prove by his
[52:18] wisdom and I'm going to play the part of
[52:20] a doctor
[52:24] here
[52:26] for a few
[52:28] minutes Satan could scientifically prove
[52:31] by his
[52:35] wisdom that the soul that was going to
[52:38] give for human race to grow
[52:47] in
[52:49] vitamins sure he did he could
[52:52] scientifically prove that
[52:55] they scientifically prove anything they
[52:57] want to
[52:59] almost now you see let us look at the
[53:02] vitamins of
[53:04] sat it had vitamin
[53:08] P
[53:12] pleasure
[53:15] popularity
[53:17] Satan
[53:19] attacking
[53:21] pleasure
[53:23] popularity you become a
[53:27] let everybody
[53:28] know let everybody know how you you are
[53:32] bright let everybody know how talented
[53:35] you
[53:36] are let everybody know that your body
[53:38] doesn't have a
[53:41] scar so you undress
[53:45] yourself so he brings in all those kind
[53:49] of
[53:50] things pleasure
[53:54] popularity that's in his wisdom
[53:59] soil sure all the worldly
[54:03] pleasure all the picture
[54:05] shows all the
[54:08] dances all things go ahead that's all
[54:13] right won't hurt
[54:15] nothing see
[54:18] popularity all our biggest church there
[54:21] in the
[54:23] city and then had vitamin
[54:27] C which is referred to as common
[54:40] sense we have a
[54:42] right common
[54:45] sense then says makes reason you
[54:50] see he had
[54:53] vitamin which meant
[54:57] reasoning yeah he could
[55:00] reason but you see that won't
[55:03] work it had vitamin
[55:07] B which is
[55:10] beauty Satan is
[55:14] beautiful sin is
[55:17] beautiful and sin as it begins to get
[55:20] more and
[55:22] more the more beautiful it be
[55:31] enement
[55:33] deception and this what Satan
[55:36] does either you will not fall by
[55:40] this he brings
[55:42] another praise the name of the Lord if
[55:45] you not going to follow by going to
[55:47] disco
[55:48] HS he will come and meet you at
[55:51] church and the Bible says when the sons
[55:54] of of God that gathered themselves in
[55:56] Job chapter
[55:59] one Satan came
[56:02] among praise the name of like then we
[56:05] have all left home but then Satan comes
[56:08] among
[56:09] us and what does he do it starts you
[56:12] lose
[56:14] attention then you
[56:17] start he has come Among
[56:22] Us Praise the name of our God so it
[56:25] distracts
[56:27] you and it is common we are here and we
[56:31] on the
[56:32] highway and then something passes
[56:36] there everybody would want to turn and
[56:39] see what is that
[56:42] Satan but he doesn't stop at
[56:45] that and then he can come here and then
[56:49] uses another
[56:50] root like some denominational
[56:53] churches when it comes to
[56:56] Christmas everybody wants to show off
[56:59] how I have
[57:00] dressed how big offering I'm
[57:04] giving and then there are those who know
[57:06] how to
[57:08] dress and they wait when the preacher is
[57:12] preaching and then they start from
[57:17] behind and every body turns to look
[57:23] at Satan
[57:25] he works in all
[57:27] ways destructs this one here dcts this
[57:30] one
[57:32] here praise the name
[57:34] of and you see if people don't have you
[57:37] know control over
[57:41] themselves Satan takes a hold of
[57:43] them praise the name of the Lord like
[57:46] what is interesting
[57:51] sometimes is the when the preacher is
[57:53] preaching here
[57:55] and then others are outside are
[57:57] conversing
[57:59] Satan why wouldn't you sit and
[58:02] here and then you try to make programs
[58:05] you're outside
[58:07] there why you've come into the services
[58:10] of the
[58:11] Lord why would you sit there and then
[58:14] another gets out picks the phone sits on
[58:18] the other side Sunday school the other
[58:21] side start
[58:23] calling but you've come to
[58:26] Church what is
[58:28] that Satan gets
[58:32] among you are here for only a few
[58:36] time but then why would you allow
[58:39] Satan to take you
[58:42] out supposing your deliverance comes at
[58:45] the time you're not
[58:48] there and anyway when we come to the
[58:52] church we come to present our El before
[58:57] God you just
[59:00] imagine at your place of
[59:02] work maybe that is too far you are
[59:06] conversing with
[59:08] somebody and then the person starts
[59:10] speaking the
[59:11] phone uhh you not even have courage to
[59:15] continue speaking you not have even
[59:17] courage to continue
[59:19] conversing or you've gone in somebody's
[59:22] office now you know I'm some
[59:25] you know those business
[59:27] deals how will that man look at you in
[59:29] his
[59:30] office this man has no respect said okay
[59:34] maybe we shall get another time
[59:36] when and this is what we do to the law
[59:39] we are here for a short time but even in
[59:42] the short
[59:44] time you don't want to miss business
[59:47] deals tell those people to call you
[59:49] after
[59:51] church praise the name of the Lord but
[59:54] this is something that is
[59:56] common oh then you get
[59:59] up but don't you know that is God who
[1:00:01] has given you that
[1:00:03] life why wouldn't you have respect for
[1:00:07] God praise the name of our Lord is when
[1:00:09] you said that I'm coming into the
[1:00:11] service of
[1:00:13] God put all the disruptions
[1:00:16] aside praise the name of Lord otherwise
[1:00:20] Satan is going to make you not benefit
[1:00:22] in the
[1:00:23] whole
[1:00:25] but not only you like when you look at
[1:00:28] the
[1:00:29] messages brother would tell the
[1:00:32] people don't move up and down settle in
[1:00:37] one place why because you grieve the
[1:00:40] Holy
[1:00:42] Spirit the Holy Ghost is working in a
[1:00:44] certain area and you are
[1:00:48] disrupting and this is what the devil
[1:00:50] does to resist the move of God
[1:00:55] so he comes and brings in all those kind
[1:00:57] of
[1:00:58] DS and at the end of the day you come to
[1:01:02] the service but you're not
[1:01:05] delivered and to make it
[1:01:08] worse you get another Spirit which is
[1:01:11] wrong because once a spirit leaves this
[1:01:15] person he wants look for another place
[1:01:17] to
[1:01:19] enter so you need to be
[1:01:22] careful that when you come to church
[1:01:25] be
[1:01:27] purified be
[1:01:30] Sanctified not again to be
[1:01:32] D because of coming with the wrong
[1:01:36] attitude so Satan is just moving up and
[1:01:40] down praise the name of our Lord and
[1:01:42] then he continues to say Satan is
[1:01:46] beautiful sin is
[1:01:48] beautiful and as Sin begins to get more
[1:01:52] and
[1:01:53] more
[1:01:55] it
[1:01:56] becomes how much better house got we
[1:01:59] today than L
[1:02:05] house how much more pretty is
[1:02:09] it how much preter is our women today
[1:02:12] than they used to
[1:02:16] be how much prettier is Florida as it
[1:02:20] was now than when God created
[1:02:23] it
[1:02:25] it's got
[1:02:27] Beauty how many knows that Satan is
[1:02:31] beauty you know when you read in
[1:02:33] Ezekiel the Bible says he was an
[1:02:36] anointed
[1:02:40] car praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:02:43] go to
[1:02:45] eel praise the name of our Lord
[1:02:49] eel let me get the chap
[1:02:53] here
[1:03:02] Ezekiel chapter
[1:03:05] 28 and then the Bible says in verse
[1:03:10] 3 behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel
[1:03:14] there is no secret that they can hide
[1:03:17] from
[1:03:23] thee in
[1:03:25] verse
[1:03:27] 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon
[1:03:31] the king of tyus and say unto him thus
[1:03:35] says the Lord God thou sest up the PSAL
[1:03:39] full of wisdom and perfect in
[1:03:53] Beauty
[1:04:02] so
[1:04:04] now this king of
[1:04:07] Tyrus was anointed by
[1:04:10] Satan and now the prophet is
[1:04:13] looking at the spirit in the king of
[1:04:18] tyus and then he says you were in
[1:04:22] Eden the Garden of God
[1:04:25] every precious stone was th
[1:04:29] covering the S The Toppers the diamond
[1:04:34] the Barry the
[1:04:36] ANS and then he says they were prepared
[1:04:40] in the day you were
[1:04:43] created you are the anointed
[1:04:46] cherub that
[1:04:48] covers and I said this
[1:04:51] so verse 14
[1:04:59] and God he says I set you to be
[1:05:02] so verse
[1:05:09] 14 and I set thee upon the holy mountain
[1:05:12] of
[1:05:15] God and thou Hast walked up and down in
[1:05:18] the midst of the stones of
[1:05:23] fire
[1:05:26] th was perfect in thy way from the dead
[1:05:28] that was created till iniquity was found
[1:05:31] in
[1:05:43] thee verse 17 thine heart was lifted up
[1:05:47] because of thy beauty though has
[1:05:50] corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of
[1:05:52] thy brightness I'll cast thee to the
[1:05:55] ground I'll lay the before the kings
[1:05:57] that they may behold
[1:06:12] thee praise the name of the Lord you
[1:06:15] know Satan he was an anointed
[1:06:19] cherub in Isaiah 14 is called Lucifer
[1:06:25] so we see that
[1:06:26] Satan was an
[1:06:29] angel before the
[1:06:31] Lord and Satan had
[1:06:34] gifts he had the gift of
[1:06:37] beauty he had the gift of
[1:06:41] wisdom praise the name of our Lord he
[1:06:43] had the gift of
[1:06:46] singing and the Bible says he had a
[1:06:51] brightness he had a glory
[1:06:55] now when Satan
[1:06:57] fell he lost his
[1:07:00] position but he never lost his
[1:07:02] gifts so he fell down with his
[1:07:06] gifts he fell with the gift of
[1:07:08] beauty he fell with the gift of
[1:07:11] wisdom he F he fell with the gift you
[1:07:14] know of you know music and so
[1:07:17] on and so he uses his
[1:07:20] gifts to lure
[1:07:22] people to get people follow
[1:07:25] him praise the name of our Lord he used
[1:07:28] these gifts he used these gifts in
[1:07:31] heaven to get a number of angels follow
[1:07:36] him and then now on Earth he's still
[1:07:39] using his gifts and
[1:07:41] everything to get people to follow him
[1:07:44] to get people to worship Him Praise the
[1:07:47] name of so now back to the message
[1:07:49] wisdom V's
[1:07:52] fa not
[1:07:55] Beauty how many knows that Satan is
[1:08:02] beauty you know our language may not be
[1:08:05] able to bring it
[1:08:07] out and he desired
[1:08:11] Beauty and triy to create a
[1:08:15] beauty more beautiful
[1:08:18] kingdom so
[1:08:21] forth we know that is in
[1:08:26] Beauty but then who doesn't want
[1:08:28] something
[1:08:30] beautiful so then you have to be careful
[1:08:32] when you're making a
[1:08:34] decision praise the name of the Lord be
[1:08:39] careful sometimes the things that shine
[1:08:42] are
[1:08:45] deceptive praise the name of our Lord
[1:08:48] like now you can say big fire
[1:08:52] come
[1:08:54] fire but you you can't use it to
[1:08:57] cook to die and these are some of the
[1:09:01] things that puts before
[1:09:03] us so
[1:09:09] temporary not
[1:09:11] there praise the name of the Lord so
[1:09:14] then he says notice he had
[1:09:18] vitamin which is
[1:09:20] reasoning vitamin B V which is
[1:09:25] now in the paragraph
[1:09:28] 270 vamin
[1:09:31] M which is
[1:09:33] modern or you want to be
[1:09:36] mod just take his
[1:09:39] knowledge and find out if you don't
[1:09:41] believe that
[1:09:43] stuff it will grow right in you that
[1:09:47] vitamin will come right up where you are
[1:09:52] sitting and then in paragraph 7
[1:09:56] 276 he says but here is one
[1:10:02] vitamin he failed to tell
[1:10:06] them vitamin D in
[1:10:11] there he has given you vitamin
[1:10:14] P popularity and
[1:10:17] pleasure vitamin C Common Sense vitamin
[1:10:22] R reasoning
[1:10:24] vitamin B
[1:10:26] Beauty but then in all the vitamins of
[1:10:29] Satan there is vitamin
[1:10:32] D hidden there and what is vitamin D
[1:10:37] that is the biggest vitamin in
[1:10:40] there the
[1:10:42] result
[1:10:45] death praise the name of our Lord he has
[1:10:48] put death in
[1:10:50] there that's why we need to withstand
[1:10:53] Satan
[1:10:56] we need to see how we can overcome
[1:10:59] Satan praise the name of our now the
[1:11:02] Bible
[1:11:04] says in the Book of
[1:11:09] Revelation
[1:11:12] Revelations 12 and verse
[1:11:15] 7 praise the name of
[1:11:22] our
[1:11:28] and there was one in heaven mik and his
[1:11:30] angels fought against the dragon and the
[1:11:33] dragon fought and his
[1:11:52] angels
[1:11:57] verse
[1:12:03] 8 and prevailed not neither was there
[1:12:07] Place found anymore in
[1:12:16] heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:12:19] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:12:22] Satan which receiveth the whole world he
[1:12:25] was cast out in the earth and his angels
[1:12:27] were cast out with
[1:12:45] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:12:47] heaven now is come salvation and
[1:12:50] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:12:53] the power of His Christ for the AO of
[1:12:56] our Brethren is cast down which AO them
[1:12:59] before our God day and
[1:13:22] night
[1:13:25] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:13:28] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:13:30] testimony and they loveed not their
[1:13:33] lives unto
[1:13:48] death praise the name of our Lord the
[1:13:51] Bible says they over came
[1:13:55] him they overcame
[1:13:58] Satan they overcame Satan and his
[1:14:01] angels overcame Satan and all his
[1:14:05] Wes by the blood of the
[1:14:08] lamb and by the word of their
[1:14:12] testimony that's why the Bible is
[1:14:13] telling us they overcame
[1:14:16] Satan by the blood of the lamb and by
[1:14:20] the word of their
[1:14:22] testimony
[1:14:23] praise the name of our Lord and that's
[1:14:25] how our Victory
[1:14:27] comes is you may not completely refuse
[1:14:32] Satan from attacking
[1:14:34] you because he keeps on
[1:14:36] attacking even when Jesus finished him
[1:14:39] on the
[1:14:40] Temptations the Bible says he left him
[1:14:43] for a
[1:14:45] season in other words he came back again
[1:14:48] and then he comes back again and then
[1:14:51] sometimes you can use your neighbors
[1:14:54] sometimes you can use your
[1:14:55] family praise the name of the Lord here
[1:14:58] it was physical Satan in the
[1:15:00] wilderness and then Satan takes him to
[1:15:02] the temple then Satan takes him to the
[1:15:05] mountain and then some place is
[1:15:08] preaching and then the woman comes up
[1:15:11] and then he says
[1:15:13] oh blessed are the the breast that fed
[1:15:20] you blessed is the womb that bore you
[1:15:26] she was enticing
[1:15:30] him taking his attention when he was
[1:15:34] preaching then some other place is with
[1:15:37] his family then asking him will you also
[1:15:41] go then some other place is with Peter
[1:15:45] Apostle and then Peter tells him you're
[1:15:47] not going to go to
[1:15:49] die so Satan uses different points
[1:15:54] and he can use different people but now
[1:15:57] the Bible is telling us they overcame
[1:16:02] Satan by the blood of the
[1:16:05] Lamb that's why we need to be right
[1:16:07] under the blood of Jesus
[1:16:09] Christ if you are not in the blood of
[1:16:11] Jesus Christ you are still a captive of
[1:16:15] Satan it doesn't matter how you try to
[1:16:18] do
[1:16:19] good as long as you're not in the blood
[1:16:21] of Jesus Christ already captured by
[1:16:25] Satan praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:16:28] need to be right under the blood of
[1:16:29] Jesus Christ if we are going to overcome
[1:16:33] Satan if we are going to withstand Satan
[1:16:37] and then the Bible says with the
[1:16:39] testimony of their
[1:16:42] mouth what word do you
[1:16:45] have what is your
[1:16:47] confession praise the name of our Lord
[1:16:50] because whatever you confess comes back
[1:16:53] to you so now if the devil takes a hold
[1:16:57] of
[1:16:57] you you need to take a positive
[1:17:01] confession praise the name of the Lord a
[1:17:04] confession of Victory a confession of
[1:17:08] overcoming confession to put you higher
[1:17:10] than where you
[1:17:12] are not
[1:17:22] lamentation
[1:17:23] negative
[1:17:25] confession so you don't look at your
[1:17:28] ability but then you look at the promise
[1:17:30] of
[1:17:31] God praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:17:34] need to be under the
[1:17:36] blood if you're not under the blood get
[1:17:40] in the blood of Jesus Christ praise the
[1:17:43] name of our Lord you know why you need
[1:17:45] to be under the
[1:17:46] blood you know that in the Bible talks
[1:17:49] about the
[1:17:52] millennium in Revelations chapter
[1:17:55] 10 reation CH
[1:17:58] 20 and then in verse
[1:18:01] 7 and when the thousand years are
[1:18:04] expired Satan shall be losed out of his
[1:18:17] prison and he shall go out to deceive
[1:18:20] the Nations which are in the four
[1:18:22] quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to
[1:18:25] gather them together to battle the
[1:18:28] number of whom is as the sand of the
[1:18:51] SE
[1:18:57] and they went
[1:18:59] up on the breth of the earth and Compass
[1:19:02] the camp of the Saints round about and
[1:19:05] the Beloved City and fire came down from
[1:19:08] God out of heaven and divide
[1:19:21] them
[1:19:32] now you see these people
[1:19:35] here who went into the
[1:19:39] Millennium without
[1:19:44] salvation because the Bible says not all
[1:19:48] the Earth not all the people on Earth
[1:19:50] are
[1:19:51] Destro when Christ comes to take over
[1:19:55] there are those who are
[1:19:56] left who go through the thousand
[1:20:00] years and now at the beginning of the
[1:20:03] Thousand Years Satan is Bound for a
[1:20:07] thousand and then is you know he's bound
[1:20:10] so he cannot do
[1:20:12] anything and then Christ and the bride
[1:20:15] rule over the
[1:20:17] Earth A Thousand Years praise the name
[1:20:20] of our Lord what a glorious time
[1:20:23] and then the Bible says there will be
[1:20:27] peace praise the name of the Lord and
[1:20:29] the knowledge of God will cover the
[1:20:33] Earth as the waters cover the sea what a
[1:20:37] beautiful time that will
[1:20:38] be praise the name of our Lord when
[1:20:41] Christ is with his
[1:20:43] bride here on Earth for a thousand years
[1:20:46] but you see there are people who will be
[1:20:48] in that 1,000
[1:20:51] years without Sal
[1:20:54] and then God permits them to be there
[1:20:56] that thousand
[1:20:58] years and now you can imagine these
[1:21:01] people being in the presence of
[1:21:05] Christ but when the devil is
[1:21:08] released they are
[1:21:10] deceived can you imagine
[1:21:13] that why they never had the blood of
[1:21:16] Jesus
[1:21:17] Christ so we need the blood of Jesus
[1:21:20] Christ to wash us
[1:21:23] to protect us and you know to see that
[1:21:26] the devil cannot deceive
[1:21:29] you so when you are outside the
[1:21:31] blood the devil will certainly deceive
[1:21:34] you praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:21:37] the message the conflict between God and
[1:21:42] Satan he says but
[1:21:45] Satan is more than a much for
[1:21:50] us we know that we know that Satan is
[1:21:54] way more than a much for any human
[1:21:59] being don't you never try to do it with
[1:22:02] your
[1:22:04] wisdom to outsmart
[1:22:06] him you can't do it Jesus knew this so
[1:22:11] he sent to the
[1:22:15] church so that Satan would not outsmart
[1:22:21] them he
[1:22:23] placed he a place to be
[1:22:29] fortified he sent them the Holy
[1:22:33] Ghost and the church does not claim to
[1:22:35] be
[1:22:37] smart they just claim to
[1:22:41] believe praise the name of our Lord now
[1:22:44] in the message wisdom versus
[1:22:47] fa in paragraph
[1:22:51] 422
[1:22:53] he just won't play
[1:22:56] around he'll do it how can it happen
[1:23:01] because there is the very life that's in
[1:23:06] Christ is in you it won't put forth any
[1:23:11] wisdom it won't grow in
[1:23:15] it it is go to deny the
[1:23:18] wisdom that's the wisdom of Satan to
[1:23:22] take
[1:23:23] faith faith in the
[1:23:26] word not wisdom in the
[1:23:29] word faith in the
[1:23:32] word Satan has got more
[1:23:36] wisdom now listen to this he said Satan
[1:23:40] has got more wisdom in that
[1:23:45] word than
[1:23:48] any all the preachers throw together
[1:23:53] PR and
[1:23:54] everything so when you come before the
[1:23:57] word don't seek for the wisdom of it but
[1:24:00] to have faith in the
[1:24:03] word and the Bible says faith is our
[1:24:08] Victory get the faith in the
[1:24:11] word and when you have the faith in the
[1:24:14] word then you'll be able to resist the
[1:24:17] devil you'll be able to withstand the
[1:24:20] devil so when you hear the word of God
[1:24:24] believe that word for
[1:24:25] yourself praise the name of our Lord
[1:24:28] take it for yourself oby that word and
[1:24:31] then you'll be able to overcome Satan
[1:24:35] and all his plans that he
[1:24:37] has praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:24:40] the message conflict between God and
[1:24:43] Satan he says God at the
[1:24:48] beginning paragraph
[1:24:51] 6 give his children the atomic
[1:24:56] weapon because he's the infinite
[1:25:00] God now seeing there was going to be a
[1:25:04] conflict there was going to be a
[1:25:07] battle God equipped his children with
[1:25:10] the right kind of
[1:25:14] ammunition the right kind of
[1:25:18] attack the right kind
[1:25:20] of everything
[1:25:23] that they had need of that would keep
[1:25:27] them all the way from Eden to the
[1:25:32] Rapture what was it the
[1:25:35] word praise the name of our Lord the
[1:25:38] word that defeats
[1:25:41] Satan is the word it will defeat him
[1:25:46] anywhere any place now why do we want to
[1:25:50] substitute something else
[1:25:54] when we already got the best thing that
[1:25:56] there
[1:25:59] is praise the name of the Lord so then
[1:26:02] you must see that you are established in
[1:26:05] the
[1:26:07] word praise the name of our Lord take
[1:26:10] your time study the
[1:26:12] word take your time hear the
[1:26:15] word take your time meditate upon the
[1:26:18] world and don't just only wait for sunds
[1:26:21] when
[1:26:23] but right there at your home right there
[1:26:26] at your school wherever you are T time
[1:26:31] and study the word take time meditate
[1:26:35] upon the word because if you don't know
[1:26:37] what the word says you live and believe
[1:26:40] the lies of
[1:26:41] Satan so God has given us the best
[1:26:46] protection and that is his
[1:26:49] word it is the best protection
[1:26:53] every
[1:26:54] believer has the right to take this
[1:26:58] word and fight the enemy everywhere you
[1:27:02] meet
[1:27:03] him everywhere you meet the enemy at
[1:27:07] school use the word to fight Satan at
[1:27:10] home use the word to fight Satan on the
[1:27:13] way use the word to fight Satan that's
[1:27:17] how you withstand
[1:27:19] Satan whatever Direction he comes in
[1:27:23] whatever point he is going to use
[1:27:26] whatever is's going to
[1:27:27] use take the word of God and stand
[1:27:31] against the devil praise the name of our
[1:27:33] Lord and then he says and Jesus proved
[1:27:37] it when he
[1:27:38] come so he equipped his
[1:27:41] children with the word for their
[1:27:45] protection against the enemy when The
[1:27:49] All Out Warfare
[1:27:51] comes and the battles are set in AR

[1:34:53] Satan praise the name of the Lord so in
[1:34:56] that what he
[1:34:57] says just
[1:35:00] remember that God made this
[1:35:04] statement and give this to his
[1:35:08] children and it's the best that there
[1:35:11] has ever been
[1:35:14] yet Satan in
[1:35:17] Eden when he first come to this attack
[1:35:22] to attack the
[1:35:23] person knowing that the children of God
[1:35:26] was satisfied with the
[1:35:32] word Satan attacked the
[1:35:36] word he never attacked the
[1:35:39] being he attacked the word
[1:35:42] first how does Satan attack the
[1:35:44] word by making you not believe the
[1:35:48] word and that's how it disarms you
[1:35:52] you have the
[1:35:54] sword but then he tells
[1:36:06] you things no longer
[1:36:10] work may send me a
[1:36:12] drone drone of
[1:36:16] unbelief and then you say now now Lord I
[1:36:19] don't know what to do man has made you
[1:36:22] put the word
[1:36:25] down that's what the devil
[1:36:27] does praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:36:31] what the devil does in the message the
[1:36:34] greatest battle ever
[1:36:36] fall now what did Satan
[1:36:39] do Satan had others
[1:36:44] anointed now Satan anoints his
[1:36:48] servants for sure anoints his
[1:36:53] servants what does he anoint them
[1:36:56] with with
[1:37:00] unbelief can you imagine that God has
[1:37:03] given us the protection of
[1:37:05] the and then the Devil comes and anoints
[1:37:08] you ah this word does not
[1:37:11] work
[1:37:13] no Satan anoints his
[1:37:18] servant he he anoints his
[1:37:22] servants what does he anoint them
[1:37:27] with with
[1:37:30] unbelief I just want us to follow that
[1:37:32] quote
[1:37:33] together paragraph 209 of the greatest
[1:37:36] battle ever
[1:37:45] F
[1:37:46] Satan and his
[1:37:49] demons anoints
[1:37:53] Humanity to disbel God's
[1:37:57] word and that's what he does and as long
[1:38:01] as Satan can anoint you to unbelief the
[1:38:04] word of
[1:38:05] God you have
[1:38:07] weapon he has already defeated you you
[1:38:11] can't withand him so now God has given
[1:38:15] us the revealed word in this
[1:38:18] age take that whole word
[1:38:22] stand with that word it is your
[1:38:25] protection it's that gives you the
[1:38:28] ability to defeat
[1:38:31] Satan Satan and these
[1:38:33] demons anoints
[1:38:36] Humanity to disbelieve God's
[1:38:39] word now if you want to confirm that you
[1:38:43] go to Genesis
[1:38:47] 3:4 let us stand back there and listen
[1:38:50] just this
[1:38:52] minute and see if that ain't his first
[1:38:56] tactic that's the first thing he
[1:38:59] did he never leaves his same
[1:39:04] tactics he does it all the
[1:39:07] time now just see if that that's what it
[1:39:12] is now you see what the devil does he
[1:39:15] uses the same trick all the
[1:39:18] time he makes you disregard the word
[1:39:26] it does not work these days of you you
[1:39:30] have no
[1:39:31] protection praise the name of the Lord
[1:39:34] so we shouldn't allow the
[1:39:36] devil to anoint us with
[1:39:39] unbelief if he anoints you with unbelief
[1:39:42] he has already defeated
[1:39:44] you he has already taken a hold of you
[1:39:48] so now he will swing you wherever he
[1:39:50] wants to take you
[1:39:53] go this way go this way you become like
[1:39:57] Samson
[1:40:02] spot then you start rotating around with
[1:40:08] children they
[1:40:12] defeated so Satan
[1:40:15] anoints people with
[1:40:18] unbelief to unbelief the word of God
[1:40:22] now he didn't disagree with the
[1:40:26] word he just caused her to kind of Mis
[1:40:29] control it a
[1:40:33] little if you know just kind of make it
[1:40:36] sound like the way he wanted it to
[1:40:40] some don't take the whole
[1:40:44] word and that's what the devil is
[1:40:47] doing are you seeing
[1:40:49] it even a saved
[1:40:55] one
[1:40:58] notary the Bible says he that believeth
[1:41:02] and is baptized shall be saved now for
[1:41:05] you saying as a you need to be
[1:41:09] baptized
[1:41:11] deception and then there are those
[1:41:13] people every Sunday every funeral they
[1:41:15] want to get
[1:41:18] Saed then you start wondering what's
[1:41:21] wrong with your
[1:41:23] confession that means that you you are
[1:41:25] not saved
[1:41:26] at but you need full
[1:41:30] Deliverance praise the name of our Lord
[1:41:32] now like there are some
[1:41:34] places every Sunday is a Deliverance
[1:41:39] service and then the people come for
[1:41:42] deliverance last Sunday he came for
[1:41:44] deliverance this Sunday has come for
[1:41:46] deliverance next Sunday what happens to
[1:41:49] you are you getting half delivered every
[1:41:54] time then you start wondering where is
[1:41:57] your
[1:41:59] face praise the name of the Lord but
[1:42:01] either this Sunday you come and some of
[1:42:04] those places they fall
[1:42:07] down that they are delivered but the
[1:42:10] next Sunday is the same suay is the same
[1:42:13] why you pick those demons
[1:42:16] from why not get total
[1:42:19] Deliverance
[1:42:21] and keep the word of faith in your
[1:42:24] heart that you don't wait for Sunday to
[1:42:26] be
[1:42:27] delivered but in the morning when you
[1:42:29] are praying you can seek your
[1:42:32] deliverance praise the name of our Lord
[1:42:35] like
[1:42:36] now if you are sick will you wait for
[1:42:39] Sunday service to become un prayed
[1:42:42] for but where you are you have the word
[1:42:46] of God you can claim the word of God at
[1:42:51] any time for your
[1:42:53] deliverance praise the name of the Lord
[1:42:55] and that's a true
[1:42:57] Christian is you don't leave your light
[1:42:59] in
[1:43:00] church but everywhere you go you are
[1:43:04] with the light praise the name of if you
[1:43:07] meet in a
[1:43:09] Marketplace maybe there are things that
[1:43:11] are causing
[1:43:13] confusion you can speak the condition to
[1:43:16] change praise the name of our Lord why
[1:43:19] greater is he that is in you that the
[1:43:22] devil that's in the world now he doesn't
[1:43:25] only stop in church but wherever you are
[1:43:29] greater is he that is in me than the
[1:43:32] devil that's in the world so in every
[1:43:34] situation you will
[1:43:36] get praise the name of our Lord proclaim
[1:43:39] the word of
[1:43:40] God praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:43:43] you'll see how the
[1:43:45] devil how he will be
[1:43:47] defeated praise the name of our Lord let
[1:43:50] us go to the Book of
[1:43:53] James praise the name of our
[1:43:58] Lord James chapter
[1:44:04] 4 and then we read from verse
[1:44:11] 7 submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:44:16] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:44:19] you
[1:44:26] see the
[1:44:27] principle submit
[1:44:31] yourself to
[1:44:33] God that's our
[1:44:35] Victory submit
[1:44:37] yourself unto God on Wednesday we
[1:44:41] sharing about
[1:44:44] obedience be obedient to the
[1:44:48] word so you are submitting yourself to
[1:44:52] God and as long as you obey God as long
[1:44:56] as you obey the word when the Devil
[1:44:59] Comes you just resist him and he goes
[1:45:03] away say Satan have known what you do
[1:45:06] get away and then you keep on
[1:45:09] moving that's how you resist the devil
[1:45:12] first submit yourself to God obey the
[1:45:16] word have faith in the word and when the
[1:45:19] Devil Comes
[1:45:21] you resist him and he will flee away
[1:45:25] draw nigh to God and He will draw n to
[1:45:29] you C your hands you Sinners and purify
[1:45:33] your hearts you double
[1:45:43] minded praise the name of our Lord
[1:45:46] submit yourself to God be obedient to
[1:45:49] the word
[1:45:51] and then the faith in the
[1:45:53] word will come out until Satan I know
[1:45:58] your
[1:45:59] trick and then he will resist him and he
[1:46:02] goes
[1:46:02] away praise the name of the Lord First
[1:46:05] Peter chapter
[1:46:08] 5 and then we read in verse
[1:46:12] 8 he
[1:46:14] says be
[1:46:17] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[1:46:21] the devil as a lowering lion walks about
[1:46:25] seeking whom he may
[1:46:36] devour that's what the devil is doing he
[1:46:39] moving like a roaring
[1:46:44] lion now you can be scared about
[1:46:47] that but he says Be soad
[1:46:52] be
[1:46:54] vigilant because the devil is
[1:46:58] awake and the Bible says he walks
[1:47:02] about he goes here he goes there he goes
[1:47:06] there wherever he can find
[1:47:09] you if you are not
[1:47:13] alert that's what the devil is
[1:47:16] doing so you must be sober all the time
[1:47:21] you must be
[1:47:23] vigilant
[1:47:26] Watchman praise the name of the Lord if
[1:47:28] it comes this way you turn it away like
[1:47:32] what's happening in Israel they have
[1:47:35] defense
[1:47:38] shields you know like Shields and and
[1:47:42] now those things are technologically
[1:47:46] made until they can detect the missile
[1:47:50] Maybe hundreds of kilomet
[1:47:53] away coming their so it turns that
[1:47:57] direction and it sends
[1:48:00] signals and then that missile blasts
[1:48:03] where it is coming
[1:48:05] from or they just divert it now if
[1:48:09] science can do such a thing how about
[1:48:12] us praise the name of our Lord just your
[1:48:16] face the Bible says have the shield of
[1:48:19] fa
[1:48:21] and the
[1:48:22] devil I'm already
[1:48:24] there then again he turns this side and
[1:48:28] then you put
[1:48:29] it praise the name of the Lord let us
[1:48:32] withand
[1:48:33] Satan don't allow the devil to put you
[1:48:37] down God has given us the best
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:42] ammunition to put the devil
[1:48:45] down so don't allow the devil take a
[1:48:48] hold of
[1:48:49] you if he brings this thing throw it
[1:48:52] back to him brings the other put it
[1:48:55] again away praise the name of our Lord
[1:48:58] and that's how Christian Life is you
[1:49:01] need to live a Victorious
[1:49:03] Life
[1:49:05] continuously at your home be victorious
[1:49:09] at your place of work be victorious at
[1:49:12] school be Victorious Praise the name of
[1:49:15] our Lord let the word of God guide you
[1:49:18] in every circumstance
[1:49:20] whatever thing you doing let the Lord
[1:49:23] take charge over
[1:49:25] it and that's how you're going to
[1:49:27] overcome
[1:49:28] SI year one year two year 10 years 20
[1:49:33] years why praise the name of our Lord
[1:49:37] and you see the devil is still the
[1:49:39] same but he moves like a lowering life
[1:49:43] he walks about seeking
[1:49:46] to praise the name of our Lord so you
[1:49:49] need to be VI
[1:49:52] praise the name of our Lord now in verse
[1:49:54] 9 it says whom resist steadfast in the
[1:50:02] faith knowing that the same
[1:50:05] afflictions are accomplished in your
[1:50:08] brethren that are in the
[1:50:12] world praise the name of the Lord it
[1:50:15] says resist him steady
[1:50:19] fast
[1:50:21] in
[1:50:22] faith faith in what in the word so you
[1:50:27] need to know the word and then know how
[1:50:29] the devil is
[1:50:31] working how the devil is
[1:50:33] attacking and then you know when he
[1:50:35] comes in this kind of thing you're able
[1:50:37] to put him off when he comes the other
[1:50:40] se you able to put him off and the devil
[1:50:42] keeps on
[1:50:44] coming praise the name of our Lord he
[1:50:47] keeps on coming but you shouldn't be
[1:50:49] scared
[1:50:51] be armed with the word of
[1:50:53] God praise the name of the Lord and not
[1:50:55] only just being
[1:50:58] armed but let the word be your
[1:51:02] life praise the name of our Lord so when
[1:51:05] he comes he comes to tempt the
[1:51:08] word the way he tempted Christ he was
[1:51:11] tempting the word but the word know it
[1:51:13] is
[1:51:14] St man shall not live by bread alone but
[1:51:18] by every word that proceeds out
[1:51:20] the and that should be the same thing
[1:51:22] with us I'm living by the word of God
[1:51:26] wherever the challenge come
[1:51:28] from stand on the word of God praise the
[1:51:32] name of our lord it's a challenging time
[1:51:35] that we are
[1:51:36] living praise the name of our Lord but
[1:51:39] the Bible tells us in Isaiah
[1:51:43] 59 Isaiah
[1:51:47] 59 and then verse 19
[1:51:53] the Bible
[1:51:58] says so they that fear the name of the
[1:52:02] Lord from the West and his glory from
[1:52:04] the rising of the sun when the enemy
[1:52:07] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[1:52:10] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[1:52:12] against
[1:52:18] him
[1:52:39] praise the name of the Lord so he says
[1:52:41] when the enemy comes like a
[1:52:47] flood the spirit of God will lift up a
[1:52:52] standard praise the name of our Lord any
[1:52:55] time the Devil Comes the spirit of God
[1:52:58] is around to lift up
[1:53:00] that against that
[1:53:03] attack to combat the
[1:53:06] enemy praise the name of our Lord but
[1:53:08] you must keep in the
[1:53:10] word that the spirit of God gives you
[1:53:14] the
[1:53:15] ability to overcome every challenge of
[1:53:18] sat praise name of our Lord keep
[1:53:21] yourself in the word keep yourself
[1:53:25] grounded and when you are in the word
[1:53:27] keep on
[1:53:29] growing praise the name of our Lord keep
[1:53:32] on growing in the
[1:53:34] word keep the word let us go to this
[1:53:38] quote as I try to
[1:53:41] finish in the message putting on the
[1:53:43] whole armor of
[1:53:45] God he says I want to ask you
[1:53:48] something just
[1:53:51] think did
[1:53:57] not while she was standing in this great
[1:54:00] Fortress of his
[1:54:08] word while she was standing in this
[1:54:11] great Fortress of his
[1:54:14] word now Satan was on the outside
[1:54:20] trying to use some kind of a
[1:54:24] technique to get her out of
[1:54:28] there that's what the devil
[1:54:32] does you are standing by the
[1:54:34] word so the devil brings a
[1:54:38] trick it can be his
[1:54:41] vitamins vitamin of
[1:54:43] pleasure vitamin of
[1:54:47] popularity when you want to be popular
[1:54:50] you get behind the
[1:54:53] word which says be
[1:54:56] humble so
[1:55:02] you should know I am so you already got
[1:55:05] away from the
[1:55:07] word praise the name of the
[1:55:10] Lord instead of being
[1:55:14] modest really
[1:55:18] sober understand what you're
[1:55:20] doing then the devil say some
[1:55:27] beauty Andress here and you see these
[1:55:31] are
[1:55:32] demons these are
[1:55:35] demons you find some of these celebrate
[1:55:39] people they know they are known but they
[1:55:42] want to get farther into being on
[1:55:45] people's mind all the
[1:55:48] time they do some of them go and film
[1:55:52] themselves doing F
[1:55:55] things and then they put them on the
[1:55:57] media everybody to read watch talk about
[1:56:02] them very funny people it's just a
[1:56:06] spirit it keeps on driving them until
[1:56:08] they become
[1:56:11] crazy and some of them poison
[1:56:14] themselves they kill themselves or they
[1:56:18] overtake the drugs
[1:56:20] they are not in their
[1:56:22] mind so you shouldn't follow such
[1:56:25] people you shouldn't take such people as
[1:56:27] your
[1:56:29] example somebody who is changing men
[1:56:31] like nothing should not be your
[1:56:34] reference at
[1:56:35] all but then you get on your profile you
[1:56:37] putting such a
[1:56:39] person you're reading about such a
[1:56:41] person you are getting the same demons
[1:56:44] from that person to
[1:56:47] yourself they're just getting a of
[1:56:50] you and until you start behaving like
[1:56:53] them you start talking like them you
[1:56:57] start dressing like
[1:56:58] them these are possessed people with
[1:57:01] demons so don't allow the devil to take
[1:57:04] you out of the
[1:57:06] world when the devil takes you out of
[1:57:09] the world he has defeated you and this
[1:57:12] is what the devil was doing he used
[1:57:15] wisdom to take Eve out of the world
[1:57:20] he say Satan was was on the
[1:57:23] outside trying to use some kind of a
[1:57:28] technique to get her out of
[1:57:31] there for as long as she stayed behind
[1:57:35] the
[1:57:38] word everything was
[1:57:41] fine that's where we make our
[1:57:44] mistake when we that's where we make our
[1:57:48] mistake
[1:57:51] we make our
[1:57:53] mistake when we get away from behind the
[1:57:59] word we get from I think you shouldn't
[1:58:02] move praise the name of our Lord amen
[1:58:05] should be consistent when you're
[1:58:08] broadcasting we make our mistake when we
[1:58:11] get from behind the
[1:58:13] word so I believe all Bible
[1:58:17] Believers think that way we get from
[1:58:21] behind the
[1:58:24] word when we get from behind the
[1:58:28] word then we are in
[1:58:31] trouble but as long as we keep the word
[1:58:34] ahead of
[1:58:36] us don't get ahead of the
[1:58:40] word let the word be ahead of
[1:58:43] you see you just let it go
[1:58:47] fast and you just live right behind
[1:58:51] it praise the name of our Lord very
[1:58:54] interesting don't go ahead of the word
[1:58:58] let the word be before you praise the
[1:59:01] name of the Lord keep the word before
[1:59:03] you all the time your school keep the
[1:59:06] word before you at home keep the word
[1:59:08] before you at work keep the word before
[1:59:11] you and then the word will protect you
[1:59:14] from all the powers of
[1:59:18] Darkness the word will withstand
[1:59:22] Satan if you bring it into
[1:59:25] use don't get out of the word don't go
[1:59:29] ahead of the word but let the word be in
[1:59:32] front of you everything they bringing to
[1:59:36] you what does the Lord say about
[1:59:39] this praise the name of our Lord every
[1:59:42] decision you make

[2:00:13] man cleans his way by taking he there
[2:00:16] unto according to Thy Word

[2:00:29] man you keep the way of the
[2:00:33] Lord by taking he to the word of

[2:02:19] the
[2:02:20] ability to withstand Satan praise the
[2:02:24] name of our Lord Psalms 1 verse
[2:02:29] 105 he says Thy word is a lamp unto my
[2:02:33] feet and a light
[2:02:41] my prise the name of Lord it says Thy
[2:02:45] word we're reading Psalms 119 where we
[2:02:48] read
[2:02:50] says Thy word is a
[2:02:54] lamp unto my
[2:02:56] feet you know a
[2:02:58] lamp praise the name of our Lord you
[2:03:01] know you can hold it and when you hold
[2:03:04] it it shows you where you are
[2:03:07] going you know you need a
[2:03:09] lamp when you are moving step by step
[2:03:12] where you're going to put your feet you
[2:03:15] need a lamp and he says it is the word
[2:03:19] so your daily
[2:03:22] decisions use the word this person has
[2:03:25] told me this but what does the word of
[2:03:27] God
[2:03:28] say there's this suggestion but what
[2:03:31] does the word of God say you using it
[2:03:34] step by
[2:03:36] step you know you are looking where
[2:03:38] you're going you're using the word
[2:03:41] you're using the word it's a lamp on
[2:03:44] your
[2:03:45] feet and you use a
[2:03:47] lamp because there is a lot of Darkness
[2:03:51] around there is a lot of uncertainity
[2:03:54] around so you say now in my life Lord
[2:03:57] what you want me to do use the lamb to
[2:04:01] guide your
[2:04:02] footsteps praise the name of our but the
[2:04:05] word doesn't only stop at being a
[2:04:09] lamp the Bible says the word is a
[2:04:15] light unto my path what does that mean
[2:04:19] it is way above me and it shows me where
[2:04:23] I am
[2:04:24] going how beautiful it
[2:04:27] is praise the name of our Lord the same

[2:05:08] be able to withand
[2:05:11] sat prise the name of our Lord so you're
[2:05:14] not
[2:05:15] scared praise the name of our Lord let
[2:05:18] us go back to Psalms
[2:05:21] 91 praise the name of the
[2:05:25] Lord and then verse
[2:05:28] three surely shall deliver thee From The
[2:05:31] Snare of the fer and from the noisome
[2:05:47] pestilence
[2:06:01] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[2:06:03] and under his wings sh thou trust his
[2:06:07] truth shall be thy shield and
[2:06:17] Buckler
[2:06:34] shall not be afraid for the terror by
[2:06:37] night nor for the arrow that flies by
[2:06:47] day nor for the pestilence that walks in
[2:06:51] darkness nor for the destruction that
[2:06:55] Wast at
[2:07:05] [Music]
[2:07:16] day now you look at this scripture
[2:07:20] he
[2:07:21] says he will deliver
[2:07:24] You From The
[2:07:27] Snare and from the noisome
[2:07:34] pestilence and then he shall cover you
[2:07:36] with his
[2:07:38] feathers you shall not be afraid by
[2:07:41] Terror of the
[2:07:45] night nowaday you wake up and then have
[2:07:48] b a
[2:07:52] house you wake up when a home has
[2:07:54] already been
[2:07:57] killed P Terrors at
[2:08:01] night so people are just on watch
[2:08:05] out let me get a dog a dog is not enough
[2:08:08] let me get
[2:08:10] cameras maybe let me put
[2:08:12] alarms let me put a security
[2:08:15] guard they're not certain
[2:08:20] but he says he will protect
[2:08:23] you and then the Bible also
[2:08:26] says even during that
[2:08:30] time there are
[2:08:32] arrows that
[2:08:34] fly St
[2:08:36] bullets and you can't see bullet during
[2:08:39] the
[2:08:40] time you can't see it at night maybe you
[2:08:43] can see the
[2:08:45] fire now he says even those straight
[2:08:48] bullets
[2:08:50] like many people are walking on the
[2:08:52] street a shoot out happens the person is
[2:08:55] killed maybe they just SE in their
[2:08:58] shop but the Lord says he will protect
[2:09:02] you even from those kind of things
[2:09:04] praise the name of our Lord and then he
[2:09:07] says even the
[2:09:10] pestilence that walks in
[2:09:12] darkness the
[2:09:15] epidemics
[2:09:17] Corona people are scared of touching
[2:09:20] their
[2:09:23] walls every you want
[2:09:26] pray even the boat you're using you're
[2:09:28] not sure whether it is
[2:09:32] clean pestilence in
[2:09:36] darkness just coming
[2:09:39] anywhere but the Lord says he'll protect
[2:09:42] us so just have the Lord with
[2:09:46] you have the Lord with you
[2:09:49] wherever you
[2:09:50] go whatever condition whatever situation
[2:09:55] have the Lord with you the Bible says
[2:09:58] let him be your
[2:10:00] Fortress let him be your
[2:10:03] Refuge praise the name of the Lord like
[2:10:06] there was a testimony during I think it
[2:10:09] was 2001 or
[2:10:12] something when they hit the twi Towers
[2:10:15] in the New
[2:10:16] York York there was a brother who was
[2:10:19] working on those there are brothers who
[2:10:21] were working on those Twi
[2:10:23] Towers now one brother I think that day
[2:10:27] he fell sick he didn't go to
[2:10:30] work then another brother what he did it
[2:10:35] reached a time he felt he needed to eat
[2:10:38] something and so he left the place of
[2:10:41] work and then he went to another
[2:10:44] building to eat while he was eating
[2:10:47] that's when this thing was was
[2:10:49] blessed the Lord knows the
[2:10:53] time praise the name of the Lord when
[2:10:55] the enem is planning this he has already
[2:10:58] put you under his
[2:11:00] wings praise the name of our Lord and
[2:11:02] that's the same thing is that God knows
[2:11:06] the plans of the
[2:11:07] devil but now God wants
[2:11:10] us to be obedient to his
[2:11:13] word the Bible says submit yourself to
[2:11:17] God
[2:11:19] and when you submit yourself to you'll
[2:11:22] be able to resist the devil you'll be
[2:11:25] protected from the plans
[2:11:27] of let the Lord be your
[2:11:30] protection praise the name of our Lord

[2:11:46] Elisha Elisha go would show him the
[2:11:50] vision when the king of
[2:11:53] Syria when they were planning to attack
[2:11:56] Israel and then the prophet would tell
[2:11:59] the king don't go in this place these
[2:12:01] people are going to attack you and then
[2:12:04] until the king of Syria was surprised
[2:12:07] who rals our
[2:12:09] secrets God knows
[2:12:12] everything praise the name of our Lord
[2:12:14] and they told him there is a
[2:12:16] prophet in Israel
[2:12:19] he tells everything that happens in
[2:12:21] your why wouldn't you want have that
[2:12:24] God in you and the Bible says the
[2:12:28] footsteps of the
[2:12:29] righteous are ordered of the Lord why

[2:13:11] it there's something
[2:13:13] wrong but then something is so
