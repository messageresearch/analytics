[11:24] amen let us pray father we thank you
[11:28] Lord
[11:29] we bless your Holy Name Lord and now our
[11:32] confession
[11:34] is we are living by
[11:37] faith in you above Heavenly Father oh we
[11:40] are so
[11:42] grateful for the privilege to come into
[11:44] your
[11:45] presence we pray that Lord you may give
[11:48] us strength Lord and courage father to
[11:52] continue on this journey that Lord we
[11:55] may not look at the things that happen
[11:58] around around
[12:00] us but we may look at the
[12:03] promise looking unto
[12:05] Jesus we thank you Father bless us again
[12:08] this afternoon Lord speak to our hearts
[12:11] father encourage us father and establish
[12:14] us Before You Lord For Your Glory and
[12:17] for your honor Lord may you meet all the
[12:19] needs of your children father in the
[12:22] name of the Lord Jesus
[12:24] this amen let us go to Romans chapter 1
[12:31] Romans 1 and verse 16 Verse
[12:38] 18 so the Bible
[12:41] says for I am not ashamed of the gospel
[12:44] of Christ for it is the power of God
[12:47] unto salvation to everyone that
[12:50] believeth to the Jew fast and also to
[12:53] the
[12:57] Greek
[13:09] for therein is the righteousness of God
[13:12] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[13:15] written the just shall live by
[13:27] faith
[13:36] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[13:38] Heaven against all ungodliness and
[13:42] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[13:45] truth in
[13:57] unrighteousness
[14:01] may God blessing of his word you may be
[14:05] seated I want to preach on living by
[14:11] faith praise the name of our Lord living
[14:14] by
[14:15] faith and so here the Bible has told
[14:19] us that the just shall live by
[14:25] faith you have
[14:27] faith that's why you
[14:30] alive praise the name of our Lord and
[14:33] you know God has made
[14:37] sure that the life that we live every
[14:41] day we live it by
[14:44] faith you leave it by knowing that I'm
[14:47] going to do
[14:49] this and then you find you are
[14:51] fulfilling
[14:53] it and then brother Bram gives a simple
[14:57] example that by the time you left
[15:01] home you had faith that when you leave
[15:04] home you will be able to go back
[15:08] home and so that is
[15:10] Faith and then he said faith is
[15:14] common praise the name of our lord it's
[15:17] common and so now even our
[15:21] lives we have to live by
[15:24] faith not by the opportunities that we
[15:27] see around
[15:29] but then we believe in the
[15:32] Lord that whatever we have need
[15:35] of he will bring it to us and that
[15:38] should be our
[15:40] life every day praise the name of our
[15:43] Lord like something simple we can ask
[15:46] ourselves we need the air to
[15:50] live but how many of us have stored air
[15:53] for the
[15:55] night I have kept some air here to keep
[15:58] the where have you kept it you remember
[16:02] during the times of
[16:04] Corona where people are paying 3 to 5
[16:07] Millions put them on oxygen per
[16:10] day every day 3 to 5
[16:14] millions and then you look at how many
[16:17] days you have lived here on
[16:19] Earth so where has that air been coming
[16:23] from or another thing how many of us
[16:26] have stored the Sun for tomorrow
[16:30] how many of
[16:32] us but you see we know that God has put
[16:35] these things in in the
[16:39] system and then we have faith that
[16:44] tomorrow it will shine like now the
[16:48] farmers you know they are busy working
[16:50] on their Gardens planting the
[16:53] seed until you get even some precious
[16:57] SE and then you plant the seeds but you
[17:01] have faith that this seed is going to
[17:05] multiply and then it to reach to
[17:07] maturity so then you find that our daily
[17:11] life moves by
[17:14] faith but then there are things we do
[17:16] and we don't
[17:18] realize that we are exercising faith and
[17:21] then you remember brother Bram in the
[17:24] prayer line or when he was doing
[17:27] discernment even tell some people that
[17:29] you even don't know that you have that
[17:33] Faith praise the name of our Lord so but
[17:35] then our lives as
[17:37] Christians should be based on
[17:41] faith and faith is also based on the
[17:44] word of
[17:46] God faith is based on the Promises of
[17:50] God yes we know that the Lord has
[17:52] commanded the
[17:55] universe so then you have faith in What
[17:57] the Lord Has
[17:59] say praise the name of our Lord and then
[18:02] you take God at his word and say say
[18:05] Lord you promised this and here is what
[18:09] what I
[18:10] desire and then the Bible says that
[18:13] whatever we have desire
[18:15] of whatever we have need
[18:18] of in Mark
[18:22] 11 Mark
[18:27] 11 and then verse
[18:30] 22 and Jesus answering sayi unto them
[18:34] have faith in
[18:42] God says have
[18:44] faith believe
[18:46] God trust God have confidence in God
[18:52] that when I ask him this he will give it
[18:55] to me that when I have a need andone
[18:58] this is my
[18:59] desire then the Lord will speedily give
[19:02] it to
[19:03] me for I say unto you that soever shall
[19:07] say unto this mountain be th removed and
[19:10] be cast into the sea and shall not doubt
[19:13] in his heart but shall believe that
[19:15] those things which he says shall come to
[19:17] pass he shall have whatsoever he
[19:27] saith
[19:34] praise the name of our Lord he says if
[19:37] you
[19:39] believe praise the name of the Lord you
[19:42] said to this mountain be
[19:45] removed and you don't start
[19:48] doubting is it going to happen maybe it
[19:52] may not oh I can't do it so you don't
[19:56] put yourself in areas of doubt
[20:00] but then you put yourself in
[20:03] believing that what you have said then
[20:06] it shall come to pass and then you shall
[20:10] have what you
[20:13] said we need to have
[20:16] faith then he says therefore I say unto
[20:19] you whatever things you desire When you
[20:23] pray believe that you receive them and
[20:27] you shall have them
[20:41] amen he said whatsoever
[20:45] things you
[20:47] desire we have different needs we have
[20:51] different
[20:52] challenges we have different kind of
[20:54] troubles we are going through so in the
[20:57] midst of the trouble you're going
[20:59] through what is your
[21:02] desire what is your
[21:04] prayer praise the name of our Lord
[21:07] because he says whatever you
[21:09] desire whatever challenge you are going
[21:12] through and then you go and present it
[21:14] to the Lord and say Lord It's You said
[21:17] whatever we
[21:19] need let me ask you praise the name of
[21:23] our Lord like you look at our Lord Jesus
[21:25] Christ when our Lord Jesus Christ was on
[21:29] us and then he would go to a particular
[21:35] place and then he finds people and then
[21:38] they say help me help me like when he
[21:42] got the lepers they were crying oh help
[21:46] us then Jesus would ask
[21:49] them what will I do for you it's the
[21:53] same scenario the Le said that I may be
[21:57] clean and then he commands the Leos to
[22:00] leave when he gets the blind people
[22:04] somewhere and then he said what can I do
[22:06] for you oh we want to see our eyes he
[22:10] said be made
[22:12] whole then again he get the Lim ones
[22:15] what do you want me to do I want to walk
[22:18] are you getting it so every person had a
[22:22] particular
[22:24] needs and even n look at the woman of
[22:28] the blood
[22:30] issue the Bible says she had spent all
[22:33] her
[22:36] living going to this doctor going to
[22:39] this technician and then you hear maybe
[22:42] there's this
[22:45] product ah then you run Chinese medicine
[22:47] is strong she spends on Chinese oh indan
[22:51] now is better you spend on Indian all
[22:54] African is now the best you spend on
[22:56] African did all those
[23:00] places this multivitamin this one year
[23:04] this one year the doctors would check
[23:06] the system here is not well developed
[23:08] then again
[23:09] she many years but when she heard about
[23:15] Christ what he was doing raising the
[23:18] dead Healing The Sick then she said if
[23:23] but I can touch the H of his
[23:26] G praise the name of
[23:28] and we have now the same
[23:31] opportunity that right now Christ is not
[23:35] in his C body on us but now Christ is in
[23:39] his body on
[23:41] us now Christ came down in the form of
[23:44] the Holy
[23:45] Spirit and then he's the one who said
[23:47] whatever you
[23:49] believe so then you can touch him the
[23:53] Bible says he's touched by the feeling
[23:55] of our infirmities
[23:58] he is a high
[24:00] priest so then when you go before the
[24:03] high priest what is your confession
[24:06] before the high priest what is your
[24:09] request before the high priest and then
[24:11] you don't limit
[24:13] yourself and if you ask him to do
[24:16] something and he answers it and tomorrow
[24:19] there is another need don't fail to ask
[24:22] him for that need
[24:24] also and say Lord again there is this
[24:26] kind of this kind of Lord again this
[24:30] kind of Lord again this kind of so God
[24:33] wants us to
[24:35] live depending upon him and you know the
[24:39] Bible even tells us let us go to the
[24:42] Book of
[24:43] John chapter
[24:47] 3 and then verse
[24:52] 27 the Bible says John answered and said
[24:56] a man can receive nothing except be
[25:00] given him from
[25:11] heaven so you can't receive
[25:16] anything unless the heavens
[25:18] release but now the heavens have Saed
[25:22] what whatever you
[25:24] desire and then the heavens Will Make A
[25:26] Way
[25:28] praise the name of the Lord the heavens
[25:30] will make a way brother Bram was
[25:33] challenging people why do you have fake
[25:43] gifts when the whole Heaven is full of
[25:48] gifts and then he was also
[25:52] saying why do you want to ask God
[25:56] little when he say said ask and you'll
[25:58] be given
[26:01] abundantly and then he says to will be
[26:03] like a rat in the silos of
[26:08] Egypt big
[26:11] silos and then the r say let me eat one
[26:13] grain
[26:15] today because it may get over this is
[26:18] what we're
[26:19] doing you go to the
[26:22] ocean let me just get a spoon of water
[26:25] to save the others can't exhaust it and
[26:29] that's the same thing without our God we
[26:32] can't exhaust him so ask
[26:36] abundantly regardless of what your need
[26:40] is and our needs are not the
[26:43] same praise the name of our Lord our
[26:45] needs are not the
[26:47] same you know like when when for example
[26:51] praise the name of our Lord when
[26:53] somebody is not
[26:55] married that's the prayer
[26:58] and I remember their brothers and
[27:00] sisters who are not married
[27:02] sometimes they would not miss
[27:06] overnight praying
[27:09] desperately now when they got
[27:11] married ah overnight is not
[27:15] [Laughter]
[27:19] anymore and then there are also
[27:21] others who would come and
[27:24] sing but when they got married
[27:28] I don't know what happened to their
[27:32] voices but that was their Target
[27:36] anyway but there are many needs to ask
[27:39] God
[27:40] for Lord I need this Lord I need this
[27:44] Lord I need this and then you should ask
[27:46] without
[27:49] tiring praise the name of our Lord so
[27:51] when you marry oh Lord let us give birth
[27:55] that's your need and now when when the
[27:58] sister is
[28:02] expecting like I remember the time I was
[28:04] in Dam 2 years
[28:06] ago it was Christmas time so we moving
[28:10] near I mean rather
[28:14] hospital and then there
[28:16] was a wife and a
[28:19] husband and it was
[28:21] raining so the husband was carrying the
[28:24] umbrella and then the heavy wife was
[28:27] moving
[28:28] slowly I think they told them you do
[28:30] some
[28:32] exercise and they are moving and it was
[28:35] raining for us we were going to church
[28:38] now such a
[28:40] woman her need is not school Fe at that
[28:43] time honey is God deliver me out of this
[28:48] situation then after giving birth hone
[28:51] need is Lord let me raise my
[28:54] child now if the child is raised Lord
[28:57] give me school fees and now when school
[28:59] fees has been the child is going to
[29:02] school then they need changes oh Lord
[29:06] protect my child from these homosexuals
[29:09] or these kind of things bad
[29:12] influences and then the child keeps on
[29:15] growing so the needs keep on
[29:17] changing so that's why God didn't limit
[29:21] us he says
[29:23] whatsoever because not the need keep on
[29:26] change this
[29:28] morning may not be my need right now my
[29:32] need right now may not be my need at
[29:34] night maybe in the morning I was feeling
[29:38] cold say oh I need some sunshine and
[29:41] then when the sunshine comes and again
[29:43] it becomes too hot let me look for a
[29:47] shade it keeps on changing and again
[29:50] maybe at night but why has the sun taken
[29:54] long without going the needs keep on
[29:56] changing
[29:58] praise the name of our Lord like when
[30:00] you are hungry you need to eat when you
[30:03] have eaten eating is no longer your need
[30:06] you
[30:07] satisfied so another need comes
[30:10] in maybe if you eat something which is
[30:13] not
[30:14] good then again the stomach
[30:16] starts and then now you need God heal me
[30:19] from this
[30:21] kind shifting
[30:23] needs and that's what the life we're
[30:25] living so go didn't limit you on what
[30:29] you have to
[30:31] ask and then you shouldn't get tired of
[30:35] praying don't be tired of asking God
[30:38] what you have
[30:40] need if my need is this Lord I need this
[30:44] if my need is this Lord I need this
[30:47] praise the name of our Lord see how God
[30:49] is so gracious to us that he has put it
[30:52] in our hands what do you have
[30:55] need praise the name of our
[30:57] what do you want the master to do for
[31:00] you don't limit
[31:02] Yourself Praise the name of our just
[31:05] tell him
[31:06] Lord this is my name maybe the following
[31:10] day another thing the other day another
[31:13] thing then maybe you remember if the
[31:16] Lord has answered my prayer then you
[31:19] remember another person who is in maybe
[31:22] your brother your sister your children
[31:25] your parents your friends or colleages
[31:27] then you start seeking the Lord for them
[31:30] and say Lord I pray for him Lord I pray
[31:32] for her Lord I petition you that's what
[31:36] the Lord wants us
[31:39] to living by faith living a life that is
[31:43] depending on
[31:45] God you're not depending upon
[31:48] yourself and the heavens have all that
[31:52] we have need
[31:53] of brother Bram says in the message deep
[31:56] calls the Deep
[31:59] then he
[32:00] says there wouldn't be a fish would not
[32:04] have the things to
[32:09] fre if there was no water but what did
[32:12] the Lord do he first created the
[32:16] water for the fish to swim in the
[32:19] water the tree wouldn't grow if there
[32:22] was no
[32:24] ask so even you you can never have a
[32:28] need if there is no response to that so
[32:32] the Deep responds to the
[32:34] Deep by the time you have a
[32:38] need that means there's something to
[32:41] answer
[32:42] that praise the name of our Lord if you
[32:44] have a need of anything it means that
[32:47] there is something God has
[32:50] prepared to respond to that
[32:52] need praise the name of our Lord now you
[32:55] look at the principle of God
[32:58] praise the name of our Lord see how the
[33:01] Lord works out
[33:03] things brother Bram he had you know his
[33:07] life was strange to
[33:09] himself even to other
[33:12] people and then now people would
[33:14] criticize
[33:16] him the gifts you have are not of
[33:19] God and then he told his wife one day
[33:23] I'm tired of this let me go and pray
[33:27] pray to
[33:28] God if I don't come I don't come I want
[33:31] him to take away this kind of then he
[33:34] went in the cave and he honestly started
[33:38] [Music]
[33:39] praying and then in the course of the
[33:43] night then he saw the light
[33:46] coming and then it came big as it drew
[33:49] nearer and immed stopped before him and
[33:53] then an angel
[33:54] appeared now
[33:57] because God wanted to Vis
[34:01] him because God wanted to reveal himself
[34:04] to brother
[34:06] BR he had to create a burden in his
[34:10] heart to desire
[34:12] that praise the name of and that's how
[34:15] the Lord Works he creates a deep
[34:19] here to because there is a deep has
[34:22] provided so whatever need you have there
[34:26] is a deep respond to
[34:29] that praise the name of our Lord there
[34:31] is a deep respond to that
[34:34] de when your desire is to get a job it
[34:38] means that there is a job that has been
[34:41] provided when your
[34:43] desire is not to marry it means there's
[34:47] a person God has
[34:49] prepared so then he works the other side
[34:52] and this
[34:53] side praise the name of our Lord when
[34:56] there is a desire to do something it's
[35:00] simply because God is putting it upon
[35:02] you to show that he has already provided
[35:06] for praise the name of our that's how
[35:08] the Lord works so when you have a desire
[35:12] when you have a need just present it
[35:14] before the Lord Lord this is what I have
[35:18] and then the Lord will facilitate that
[35:21] the Lord will bring it close to you the
[35:23] Lord will manifest what you're looking
[35:25] for the will release what you're looking
[35:28] for praise the name of our Lord so then
[35:31] we need to learn how to live by
[35:35] faith praise the name of our Lord in
[35:37] whatever things that we
[35:40] desire in whatever thing that we have
[35:42] need
[35:43] of praise the name of our Lord and then
[35:46] in the message Hebrews chapter
[35:50] 1 I said that's the only way you can do
[35:54] a right kind of job for the Lord
[36:01] Lord is put
[36:04] everything you've
[36:07] got right to the Forefront for
[36:12] Christ all your
[36:14] strength all your
[36:18] soul all your heart all your
[36:22] mind everything that you got when you
[36:27] are doing
[36:29] anything do it right or don't do it at
[36:34] all see just leave it alone you are
[36:39] going to be a
[36:41] Christian put
[36:43] everything that you've got to
[36:46] Christ that's your time your talent your
[36:51] everything and now when you do that you
[36:54] are yielding yourself to the leadership
[36:57] of
[36:58] God in other words you are getting the
[37:02] mind of
[37:04] God praise the name of our Lord and when
[37:07] you get the mind of
[37:09] God and then you say
[37:12] anything it is as good as God saying
[37:16] it praise the name of our Lord because
[37:18] you have yielded yourself you've
[37:21] surrendered yourself to him so then he
[37:24] he takes over your mind takes over your
[37:27] thinking so everything you
[37:30] speak it comes to pass praise the name
[37:34] of our Lord so we need to learn how to
[37:37] live by
[37:39] faith let us go to 2 Corinthians chapter
[37:44] 5 and then verse
[37:51] seven for we walk by faith not by sight
[38:00] praise the name of the Lord we walk by
[38:03] faith we have
[38:06] confidence that he that has started a
[38:09] good work in
[38:11] US himself will bring it to
[38:14] completion praise the name of our Lord
[38:16] and that should be our daily
[38:19] living Lord this is my
[38:22] desire so when I've started something I
[38:26] have confidence in God that I'm going to
[38:29] get what I
[38:30] desire I'm going to get what I'm
[38:32] targeting for and then the Lord will
[38:35] bring
[38:36] it so you don't walk by what you are
[38:40] seeing you don't walk by what
[38:43] opportunities you
[38:45] have oh just say now now for me I get a
[38:49] small
[38:51] salary and then now your small salary
[38:54] even you put your faith on that small
[38:55] salary
[39:00] you don't look at that look at the
[39:04] promise praise the name of our Lord look
[39:07] at the promise like a sick person you go
[39:11] to the
[39:14] medicales you know
[39:22] and you don't look at those things you
[39:26] want to be
[39:27] healed then you look at that by his
[39:30] stripes I was
[39:32] healed praise the name of Lord if you
[39:35] find you are you don't have you are poor
[39:39] then he said let the poor say I am rich
[39:45] so you look beyond the circumstances
[39:48] your you look beyond the opportunities
[39:51] you have around and then you look to the
[39:54] god that is more than
[39:57] to meet all our
[40:01] needs praise the name of our Lord and
[40:03] the Bible says they that observe lying
[40:09] vanities in Jonah chapter
[40:13] 2 the Book of
[40:15] Jonah chapter
[40:23] 2 and then verse 8
[40:32] they that observe lying vanities forsake
[40:36] their own
[40:44] mercy so what are the lying
[40:48] vanities the
[40:55] symptoms too
[40:57] sick ah that high
[41:00] fever is a symptom all the doctors have
[41:04] told me I'm not going to be healed is a
[41:07] symptom is a lying
[41:11] vanity so you don't look at what they
[41:13] have told you but you look at what the
[41:16] word of God
[41:18] says Lord this is my
[41:20] desire praise the name of our Lord Lord
[41:23] this is what I need Lord this is how I
[41:26] need to come out of this
[41:28] St Lord this is how I need to break
[41:32] through praise the name of our Lord
[41:34] that's what the Lord wants us to do
[41:36] that's what the Lord wants us to look
[41:38] to don't look at the things you're going
[41:42] through don't look at the negative
[41:44] things around
[41:46] you don't look at the problems you have
[41:49] around don't look at the travs you have
[41:52] around don't look at your
[41:55] salary
[42:00] you don't look at that you need it Lord
[42:04] provide it praise the name of our not
[42:08] when I look at my
[42:10] salary of all the loan I'm
[42:15] getting now it will take me 10
[42:18] years now the I'm getting I cannot live
[42:22] in a good
[42:23] house oh me I cannot even get a plot
[42:27] you don't look at that tell god this is
[42:30] my
[42:31] name praise the name of the Lord and if
[42:33] it is your
[42:35] need and God himself
[42:38] knows because the Bible says his ways
[42:41] are past finding
[42:44] out his
[42:46] thoughts are not our thoughts his ways
[42:51] and not our ways for you your
[42:55] way
[43:00] that is your way but the way of God is
[43:03] beyond way
[43:05] of the thing is do I have need of
[43:08] this and then you see the Lord opens the
[43:12] door praise the name of our Lord you
[43:14] know like now there are some people when
[43:17] they when they compare their
[43:20] salary and the allowances they
[43:24] get they know that they are
[43:28] where there are many
[43:31] activities and then you can get the
[43:34] whole year money in one
[43:38] month just through
[43:41] allowances those kind of things or maybe
[43:44] is having this
[43:46] program and then again another project
[43:49] comes you now going to be the
[43:53] coordinator here the place of
[43:56] go and handle that thing
[43:58] for so you shouldn't look at your
[44:02] salary to limit
[44:10] your and there
[44:18] some is your
[44:21] fa praise the name of our Lord where is
[44:23] your
[44:25] Fai
[44:29] what do you have need do you have need
[44:32] of a good
[44:34] season or you have need of fulfilling
[44:39] something praise the name of the Lord he
[44:41] says whatever you have need of so don't
[44:45] look at the lying
[44:47] vanities Jonah was in the belly of the
[44:50] fish three days and three nights no hope
[44:54] no nothing you only looked to the Lord
[44:57] said I Cried unto the
[44:59] Lord and the Lord had my PR and the Lord
[45:04] himself commanded the fish and then went
[45:07] and vomited
[45:09] Jonah can you imagine Jonah was in In
[45:13] Jonah they were going to
[45:16] T they were going to
[45:19] t with these people he was running away
[45:23] with and then the Bible says let us
[45:26] follow that story a little
[45:28] while Jah
[45:34] 1 Jonah chter 1 and then verse
[45:39] 3 but Jonah rose up to flee andish from
[45:43] the presence of the Lord and went down
[45:45] to jopa and he found a ship going to
[45:49] tashes so he paid the fair thereof and
[45:53] went down into it to go with them to
[45:56] from the presence of the
[46:12] [Music]
[46:20] Lord now you can imagine he's already
[46:23] paid the fa going to t
[46:27] they have told him to go to n now he
[46:29] gets the ship going to
[46:32] T and now these people when the storms
[46:35] were so
[46:37] bad they made sure that they reached the
[46:40] the the showers very
[46:43] fast but they were failing until they
[46:47] lost all their goods and they said much
[46:50] as we see the town of
[46:54] T but we can't
[46:56] continue then they asked Jonah what do
[46:59] we do he said throw
[47:02] me and then they threw him in the
[47:07] water now the Sheep the
[47:10] fish where Jonah
[47:13] was it didn't take Jonah
[47:16] to but took Jonah
[47:19] to who commanded that it was the Lord so
[47:24] the Lord knows how to guide all our
[47:29] lives praise the name of our Lord you
[47:31] only yield to him say Lord this is the
[47:34] situation that I am in this is the
[47:37] condition I'm in come down in my
[47:41] sitation the way he guided the Sheep the
[47:44] fish to go to
[47:46] n
[47:48] not praise the name of our Lord and then
[47:51] the fish brought the
[47:53] prophet and he came out of the fish
[47:56] the way this this this sheep
[48:00] land and then they see them coming then
[48:03] they saw the prophet coming
[48:05] out praise the name of God God cares for
[48:09] all our
[48:10] needs we just only say Lord this is my
[48:14] need Lord this is my heart's desire so
[48:17] what is your heart's
[48:19] desire every one of us has a different
[48:21] need we have different desires and say
[48:25] Lord this is my need Lord this is the St
[48:28] I'm going through I need you to help me
[48:31] I need you to deliver me praise the name
[48:33] of our Lord he has not limited us on
[48:37] what we can ask whatever you have need
[48:41] of praise the name of whatever you have
[48:44] need of and at a different age in
[48:48] life they need
[48:51] changes praise the name of our Lord they
[48:53] need to keep on changing as we keep on
[48:56] living on Earth so God desires us to
[49:00] take
[49:04] interest about your
[49:07] need are you also concerned about what
[49:10] you have need
[49:12] of you
[49:19] don't there's something the Lord can do
[49:22] about raise it to him say Lord this is
[49:26] the issue Lord my house is collapsing on
[49:29] me then you raise it to the Lord and
[49:32] then the Lord will make a way for that
[49:34] kind of
[49:35] sitation praise the name of our Lord so
[49:38] God wants us to have faith in
[49:41] him praise the name of our Lord the
[49:44] Bible says the just shall live by
[49:48] faith so whatever you have need of just
[49:52] have
[49:53] confidence just have faith
[49:56] praise the name of God let us go to
[49:59] Genesis
[50:02] 22 and then verse
[50:11] six Genesis
[50:17] 22:6 and Abraham took the wood of the
[50:21] burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac's
[50:23] son and he took the fire in his hand and
[50:26] the knife and they went both of them
[50:44] together and Isaac spoke unto Abraham
[50:47] his father and said my father and he
[50:49] said here I am my son and he said behold
[50:53] the fire and the wood but but where is
[50:56] the Lamb for a burnt
[51:13] offering and Abraham said my son God
[51:17] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[51:20] offering so they went both of them
[51:24] together
[51:34] praise the name of the Lord what a very
[51:36] interesting story of Abraham and
[51:40] Isaac Abraham taught his
[51:43] child how to
[51:45] worship praise the name of our Lord
[51:47] because he saw the fire he saw the
[51:51] firewood he saw the knife said why is
[51:55] the
[51:56] so he had been
[51:58] taught he had
[52:00] seen he was participating in it and then
[52:04] he was asking his father where is the
[52:08] lamb and Abraham by
[52:11] faith he didn't see where the lamb
[52:14] was he didn't see it God had told him
[52:17] offer Isaac as a b
[52:21] of and now Abraham that was to fulfill
[52:26] the word of
[52:27] God and now the explanation would go
[52:32] Isaac God will provide
[52:36] himself and that's how we should look at
[52:38] our situ that God will make a
[52:42] provision for my
[52:44] need because the lamb was not
[52:47] there and they were going high in the
[52:50] mountain but then he told him God will
[52:54] provide
[52:56] the same thing with us if I am sick God
[53:00] will provide the
[53:01] healing praise the name of our Lord if I
[53:04] have any
[53:05] need God will sustain that need if my
[53:10] need is
[53:11] full God will provide that
[53:14] for if my need is a
[53:17] house God will provide that house if my
[53:21] need is a
[53:22] job God will provide that job
[53:26] if my need is a
[53:27] wife God will provide that wife if my
[53:31] need is a husband God will provide a
[53:35] husband if my need is children God will
[53:38] provide a children he says God will
[53:41] provide himself so we shouldn't limit
[53:44] God but just raise our need to the Lord
[53:48] and say Lord this is what I have desire
[53:51] Lord this is what I have need of Lord
[53:54] come and help me this kind of
[53:56] situation Abraham had faith in
[53:59] God praise the name of our Lord even
[54:02] when the Lord told him come out of your
[54:06] land and then I I will take you to
[54:09] another
[54:10] place didn't know where he was
[54:13] going but he walked by
[54:16] faith believing in the Lord who had
[54:20] called him and the Bible says praise the
[54:24] name of our Lord
[54:25] that the things that we
[54:27] see are very temporary but the things
[54:31] that we don't see are Eternal so we are
[54:35] called to look at the
[54:38] Unseen as the
[54:40] reality praise the name of our Lord
[54:42] that's how the Lord wants us to live you
[54:45] look at the
[54:46] Unseen you need and say
[54:50] Lord this is what my need is and then
[54:54] you believe
[54:56] to actualize that
[54:58] thing to bring it to
[55:01] manifestation to bring it to
[55:03] reality when Abraham said the God will
[55:06] provide the
[55:07] lamb he was not seeing the Lamb but yet
[55:10] he believed in God that himself is more
[55:14] than able to provide
[55:15] that and that's now the same thing now
[55:19] how we need to live by
[55:21] faith how we need to
[55:24] live
[55:26] not not this not kind of you know
[55:29] sorrowful because of what we don't
[55:32] have but then you raise whatever you
[55:34] have need
[55:36] of before the Lord in prayer praise the
[55:39] name of the Lord in Philippians chapter
[55:44] 4 Philippians chapter
[55:49] 4 and then in verse
[55:53] four rejoice in the Lord always and
[55:56] again I say
[56:01] rejoice let your moderation be made
[56:05] known unto all men the Lord is at
[56:15] hand be careful for nothing but in
[56:18] everything by prayer and supplication
[56:22] with Thanksgiving let your request be
[56:26] made known unto
[56:35] [Music]
[56:38] God he says whatever you have need
[56:42] of what request do you have make it
[56:46] known unto
[56:48] God with prayer and
[56:52] Thanksgiving praise the name of the Lord
[56:55] just tell him what you have need of the
[56:58] Bible says cast all your
[57:01] burdens unto the Lord cast them and say
[57:05] Lord this is my bur Lord this is my need
[57:09] and put it before him and then you start
[57:12] thanking him Lord I Thank you you're
[57:16] more than to respond to this you're more
[57:18] than able to answer this you're more
[57:20] than able to provide this you're more
[57:22] than able to do this kind of how we need
[57:25] to live praise the name of our Lord a
[57:28] life of faith when you meet a serious
[57:31] need or any challenge you lift it to the
[57:35] need to the Lord you know like that song
[57:39] what a friend we have in
[57:41] Jesus praise the name of our Lord
[57:44] whatever you have need of all your cares
[57:48] all your Tres all your problems lift
[57:51] them to the Lord in prayer and you
[57:54] believe
[57:56] that the Lord is
[57:58] real the Bible says he that comes to God
[58:03] must know that God
[58:05] is God is real God cares God is
[58:10] concerned about your condition God is
[58:12] concerned about what you're going
[58:14] through and then brother Bram
[58:17] preaches he cares do you care praise the
[58:22] name of our Lord he cares for all our
[58:24] needs
[58:25] he cares for distractions we are going
[58:27] through he cares for whatever is paining
[58:30] us but do we care do we care to tell
[58:34] him do we care to present it before him
[58:37] do we care to say Lord according to your
[58:41] word according to your
[58:46] word you said whatever I have need
[58:53] of when I
[58:55] pray let me believe that I receive it
[59:00] and I believe now I'm
[59:02] receiving and then you thank God thank
[59:04] you for this opportunity that I can pray
[59:06] to you praise the name of our Lord and
[59:09] you just be
[59:10] thankful and you see the way God
[59:13] works even like now for example
[59:16] sometimes when you are
[59:18] praying then somebody comes in your
[59:21] mind that means God wants you to pray
[59:23] for that
[59:25] so even the same thing in our life and
[59:29] say I've remembered I don't have this
[59:33] kind of thing but I don't have enough
[59:35] money it has come to your mind then you
[59:38] pray to God about say Lord this is my
[59:42] need praise the name of the Lord that's
[59:44] how life moves on then you go and check
[59:47] something somewhere something comes to
[59:50] your mind or interests you talk to God
[59:53] about it
[59:55] praise the name of the Lord when brother
[59:57] Bram was reading about the story of
[1:00:00] Joseph said Lord I Thank you for Jose
[1:00:03] and then the Lord came and told him you
[1:00:05] going to give birth to a son and call
[1:00:07] him
[1:00:08] Jes praise the name of our Lord God is
[1:00:11] concerned about
[1:00:13] us he's concerned about our
[1:00:16] Affairs so the Bible has told us
