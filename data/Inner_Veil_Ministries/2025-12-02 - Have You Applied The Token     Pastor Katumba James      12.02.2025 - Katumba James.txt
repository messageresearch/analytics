thank you for this evening the grace that you've given un us father that we can come into your presence Lord you said where three are gathered in your name you will be there in their mid and Lord we believe you're here in our midst therefore we pray you may speak to us father and give us understanding of your word that we may receive that transformation and be able to be like our Lord Jesus Christ May bless us this night father and are all our prayers request here all our prayer request glorified in the name of the Lord Jesus us amen let us go to Exodus CH 12 and then we're reading verse so the Bible says and the blood shall be unto you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land [Music] word May so I want to to take some bit of time and Minister on have you applied the token praise the name of our Lord now here the Bible says the blood shall be to you for a token that when I see the blood I pass over you and the plague shall not be upon on you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so we see this was an evening time when the children of Israel Were Meant to leave Egypt and the Lord wanted to bring judgment upon the houses of the Egyptians but then the children of Israel they were still in egpt the name of our Lord the same thing also to us that we are still living in this world we are still living in the world that is having a lot of evil things but while we are living in the world there must be a difference between us and then the other people there must be a difference between us who have received the message and even those who have not received the message there must be a token something that brings forth a difference something that distinc fies us you know to show that God has called us God saved us praise the name of our so Moses was telling the children of Israel that you you will have to apply the blood but then the blood could not be applied without a lamp being slain praise the name of our Lord the same thing also for us we can never apply the token if there was no death of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament blood was animal blood but now in the New Testament the blood is the blood of God himself praise the name of the Lord blood of God that was applied go to the book of Acts and then verse 28 the scripture says take he therefore unto yourselves andto all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you over seers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood so he says that we were purchased by the blood of God so we are totally different from what happened in the Old Testament praise the name of our Lord because we see that the blood applied in the Old Testament they had to continuously keep on applying the blood of different animals you know to they kill an animal and then they have the morning sacrifice and the evening sacrifice even the following another animal until the end of much as they applied the token in the Old Testament it only helped them at that time like when the death angel was passing over the land of Egypt that blood helped them at that season but then when they crossed the Red Sea they needed to keep on applying the blood praise the name of our Lord then we have the blood of Jesus Christ and then the Bible says he has applied his he has offered as a sacrifice once and for all praise the name of the Lord so it is the same blood of Jesus Christ which saves us is the same blood of Jesus Christ that brings us to Perfection praise the name of the Lord so now in the Old Testament the blood was applied upon the doorsteps on the door flame let us go to Exodus 12 praise the name of our Lord Exodus 12 and then it says verse S and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two sides of the posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it so now they were applying the blood on the doors on the upper part of the flame and then even on the two sides but now we apply the blood of Jesus Christ we apply to our soul we app in our hearts by faith praise the name of our Lord apply that blood in our hearts praise the name of our Lord now in the message token he says now our sacrifice today not not only an ordinary human being but it was God himself I think if you can adjust the voice it was God himself that was identified in the flesh here upon the Earth but that blood cell was broke not only did the soul of not only did the soul of a man the spirit of man but God himself who was identified in that man returns upon in the baptism of the holy spirit that is the token that God requires today the token of today that we have to have must be the holy spirit that is God that's God required token prove to you by the scriptures without the Holy Spirit you do not display the token that is the token shows that you have you have identified yourself with the sacrif and God sent you back the token to show that you have been accepted until that is done no matter how good you are how much you know how a college professor or a good person or preacher whatever it might be you are absolutely not recognized until you can show the token praise the name of our Lord he says the token that God requires from us baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord and it is God himself who gives us the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the baptism of the holy spirit is the life of Jesus Christ coming down to us praise the name of our Lord and all that God requires us to receive the bap of the holy spirit is to believe him is to be obedient to the word there is no other praise the name of Lord believe and obey the word of God the life of Jesus Christ will come down so he says and tonight God requires the baptism of the holy spirit for a proof that we have been identified in the resurrection of Jesus Christ there is nothing short of [Music] it the Bible teaches it plain and we must believe it God is word God is requiring it we are having an exodus Israel was marching to the promised land so the bride go to the home pretty soon now we find out the blood was a token and was identified everyone was identified by the blood the the Holy Ghost is our token today to identify Us by with Jesus Christ in his resurrection the blood being applied by faith praise the name of our Lord they had apply the blood by by faith and we also apply the Holy Spirit by faith believing in the word of God praise the name of the Lord our token is the life of Jesus Christ which comes by the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord and you receive the life of Jesus Christ by having faith in the finished work on calary when you hear the word of God obey the word of God the Holy Spirit comes down praise the name of our Lord and so when are we required to apply the token the time is now to apply the token praise the name of our Lord to live as a Christian Life you need the token all the time you don't wait when you're going to die or you don't wait when there's trouble but you need to see that you apply the token Right Now Praise the name of our Lord and where is the token applied the token is applied in your heart you know the token app be in your soul you know the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Spirit the life of Jesus Christ and now the toen must be received praise the name of the Lord because God has given it so you receive what he has given us praise the name of our Lord make sure that we have applied the token in the time that we are living in praise the name of our Lord now in the message the talken paragraph 434 he says now it is a token what is a token the token is a sign of a de being paid a price required has been paid the price of our Salvation was death and no one could could pay it but Christ this and not the spirit of a denomination not the spirit of a pope not the of but the spirit of Jesus Christ upon the church is a token that the debt has been paid and is met every requirement that God required and we have him and and we and him are one that you know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you you in me apply the token appli the token of his resurrection because he was raised for our justification he raised he was has raised us with him and now we set in Heavenly places in Christ Under The Fellowship of the token praise the name of our Lord so the token is the sign that you have the debt has been paid like in our normal way of doing things a token is like a receipt praise the name of our Lord like for example when you are passing through maybe buses before you start a journey maybe like from Ginger to S go to theing station at the bus station or booking office and then they they you pay and then they give you a token and now that's what actually allows you to enter the bus now without that token cannot board the bus and then reach your destination you must first pay and then they say now you can sit so now it is the blood of Jesus Christ it is the holy spirit that he gives us to enable us to move the journey praise the name of Lord so we need to see that we apply the token in the Old Testament they would not start an exodus without the token being applied praise the name of our Lord we need to apply the blood of Jesus Christ that wases away all our sins that makes us to be worthy to stand before God praise the name of Lord then in the message still toen brother Bram says but when I see the token I pass over you it is God's requirement of the hour the evening time message is to apply the token praise the name of our Lord so God has given us the message and it's by this message that we can apply the message it's by the message that we can apply the token you know you can have the token in your life and then you can have the token upon your household praise the name of Lord so we need to see that even our families they they receive the token like in Egypt the blood was applied upon the house but every person who was inside was safe so even now we have the privilege that you who has got saved praise the name of our Lord you can also apply the token for your family you can apply the token for your children you can apply the token for your household praise the name of the Lord believe God for the Salvation of your children and then you keep praying for your family you pray for your children to be saved you pray for your parents to be saved you pray for your friends to be saved praise the name of our Lord so in the message talk brother Bram says believe for safy then apply see here is what you want to believe for see you want your own safety you believe for your safety the token for the whole family you say how can can I do it claim it if it on you then you and the word become one amen see it works for both of you you and the word are one then apply to your children apply to your loved ones also like rab did she applied the token to her father she applied it to her mother she applied to her brothers and her sisters and got them in you apply it say Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after my daughter I claim her Satan you turn her loose I'm coming after her I apply my token the Holy Spirit oh holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter I'm going for to her now with your anointing upon me he will do it that's what they did in Egypt that's what they did in Jero then he says if you want to read another one 16 verse 31 Paul told the Centurion believe I am the Messenger of the hour believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and th house shall be saved that's right believe for your house bring them all under praise the name of our Lord so we need to apply the token for our family apply the token to all your children claim them one by one brother was saying I'm going after my daughter I'm going after my son praise the name of Lord them believe what you believe you you actually intered for them in prayer Lord have mercy upon my son Lord have mercy upon my daughter have mercy upon my mother have mer upon my father you know you are claiming them you have applied the token yourself so you go out to every one of your household and then you claim them praise the name of our Lord that's how we need to see that we apply the token going after all the people and then bringing them into the praise the name of our Lord can now look at different tokens in the scriptures now when we go to Genesis chapter 11se the B says and I establish my Covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off anymore By the Waters of a flood neither shall there anymore be of a flood to destroy them and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is Generation so I do set my in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the Earth so now God was talking to Noah and he said that I will never destroy the Earth by a FL and so he said I will put a token and that token was a rainbow and then he says when I see the rainbow in the sky then I will remember my Covenant that I'm not going to destroy praise the name of Earth by the flood so a token is a confirmation of the Covenant praise the name of our Lord token confirms the Covenant now we see in the message toen then brother Bram says and if he has G you the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet then okay says and if he has never G you the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet then he has not confirmed your faith that you say you have but the token is the confir praise the name of our Lord the confirmation of our salvation toen that we have been redeemed praise the name of our Lord the proof that the price has been paid and then he says when I show when I saw the token I got a right and when I can show the token of the Holy Spirit you got the right to any purchased thing Jesus died for praise the name of the Lord is the token just watch a moment hold token over your uning faith in the promised word I believe that Jesus said ask the father anything in my name and I will do it the token over the promised word hold the token over the promised word and walk right to it I'm the Lord that heals all your diseases he was wounded for my transgressions with stripes I was healed take my token of the holy spirit that is in me hold it over my prayer and say Lord God you promised it when I see the blood when I see the blood I will reward you you promise to do it you can't do nothing else he look right through the blood of his own son is the token praise the name of the Lord there is the token applied he has to do it because he promised it praise the name of the Lord we need apply token in prayers for every promise of God praise the name of our Lord you use the token because God has accepted your faith has received you so then you bring your claims to God lord you promised this you use the token praise the name of Lord then again that message says 176 what is the token is the confirmation of his word that shows he is the word the word said he raised up from the dead he is alive forever more he lives in his people the same yesterday to Dan forever if you believe that then you have a right if you have the token the Holy Spirit in you you have a right to everything that is death purchased for you praise the name of the Lord we need to apply the token in every situation that we go through in life to overcome our weaknesses let us use the token for all our needs let us apply the token praise the name of our Lord and then you see how the Lord goes for to bring those things that we have desired praise the name of our Lord let us go to Genesis 1 and then verse 11 he says and you shall circumcise the Flesh of yourin and it shall be a token of the Covenant between me and you and he that is 8 years old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your Generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed first and he that is born in thy house and he that bought with money must needs be circumcised and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant and uncircumcised men child whose flesh of his for skin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken myen [Music] praise the name of our Lord God was Abraham that every man child of your household yours the slaves all of them have to be circumcised so that you know they are all all part of the Covenant of God and that should also be our desire for our household the people that we live with let us bring them under the the token praise the name of our Lord let them be part of the houseold protection of God mercies of God tell them about the way of the Lord teach them the word of God praise the name of that's how you bring them under the token that they may know what you believe you know the Bible tells us that we should be ready to testify when people ask us what we so you should also be ready to talk about what you believe know what you believe and that's how you can influence them into the way of the Lord praise the name of our Lord let us also look at another one in Exodus chapter 3 and then verse 11 verse 12 and Moses said unto God whom am I that I should go un pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou Hast brought forth the people out of Egypt You Shall Serve God upon this mountain [Music] praise the name of our Lord so God was telling Moses that the toen a proof that I'm sending you because he was talking to him when he so Moses was seeing it was a big challenge before him he's here alone talking with God he had run away from Egypt fearing PHA and now here after 40 years God is telling go and bring my people Andes asual was wonder how is this going to be you know the same thing like Nicodemus when unless a man is born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and then say how can these things be can I enter my mother's womb and be born again so his natural understanding is only from the wom of a mother but then the Lord him another the name of Lord doesn't come by the natural instruments but then it comes by the superal praise the name of our Lord and so here God was telling Moses that the token to prove that I have sent you you are going to come back to this mountain with all the children of Israel and you will serve me from this mountain praise the name of our Lord and here we have received the token and that token of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord confirms to us that we have eternal life the token of the Holy Spirit confirms to us that our mortal bodies shall be changed to become immortal bodies the token of the Holy Spirit confirms to us that we are also going to rise up we are going to be in the rapture we are going to be with the Lord in the wedding supper we are going to with Christ 100 a thousand years we are going to sit together with Christ that is the token that we receive that everything that God has promised Belongs To Us Praise the name of our Lord so we go out and apply the token according to our needs what has God promised us use the token to make your claim praise the name of our Lord good health belongs to me praise the name of our Lord sustainance belongs to me peace belongs to me belongs to me the joy of the Lord belongs to me so you use the token to claim all the things that God has promised us praise the name of our Lord we need to apply the token praise the name of our Lord let us go to Numbers chapter 17 number 17 and then read from verse 8 ver praise the name of our Lord numbers 17:8 ver 10 it says and it came to pass that on the morrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of the witness and behold the road of Aaron for the House of Levi was bed and brought forth birds and blossomed blossoms and yielded almonds [Music] and Moses brought out all the roads from before the Lord and to all the children of Israel and they looked and took every man his road and the Lord said unto Moses bring aon's Rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shall quite take away their Mings from me that they die not praise the name of our Lord so here when there were dispute among the children of Israel God told Moses take a road from every leader of each tribe and then they were brought in the they were brought in the holies of holies and all the roads nevered except thead ofon which actually blossomed and then it even put on alms praise the name of our Lord and then God said this should be now a token that Aon has been chosen the tribe of Levi has been chosen that it should be able to quien these people you to make them quiet from their mming so quit from their mming and know that this one is the chosen of the Lord praise the name of God used the the life in the road as a token as a proof that this is acceptable of the Lord the other road which never it meant that those are not acceptable in the services of the Lord in other words they were not ordained to do the service of the priesthood the name of our so God had put there a token so we see also see that when the 12 Spies went to when the spies went when the three spies went to to Jero they went into the house of Rahab and Rahab was said that the whole country is trembling and then she told him as I've shown you kindness you also need to show me kindness praise the name of our Lord believed them and so now they had to make a SC threat put a scared thread in the one of the the windows outside of the city window which this used to go down the city so when we see that in J 2 and then verse he says now therefore I pray swear unto me by the Lord since I've shown you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give give me a true token chter 2 vers 12 [Music] so she was demanding give me a token something to show that I'm going to be safe when the destruction comes on the city I will be safe praise the name of the Lord remember that in the book of eel when the angel when the the inkman was told Mark them that cry and against the abomination of the city when struction went forth was told don't go to those people people who have been marked prise the so we need the token to make us you know to make us different from the rest of the people of the world to escape the Judgment that are coming upon Earth praise the name of our Lord and then the SP RAB put that Scarlet cloth on the window when we come and then we see that in 2 ver let us start from verse 17 and the man said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou Hast made us to swear behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou did let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee a praise the name of our Lord so she demanded a true token and the true token was given to her God has also given us a true token which is the baptism of the holy spirit so now when the spies were when the Joshua came to take over the city the Bible says in joshu 6 and then verse 25 and Joshua saved Rahab the harot alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day because she hid The Messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho Joshua 6:25 is praise the name of the Lord Raab applied the token for her household we need also to do the same thing for our household we need to apply the token for our Liv and also apply the token for our household in the message adoption brother Bram says I want to say this one thing did you ever read in the scriptures where the Bible said this Paul told the Roman Centurion when he pulled when the Roman he pulled his sword to kill himself up at Philip when he was in jail and the earthquake shook the jail down he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy house thy and thy house shall be saved did you ever hear that th and thy house now look if you have faith enough for salvation of yourself can't you also have faith enough for your house praise the name of the Lord in other words the faith that has saved you the faith that has saved you is the same Faith you use are praying for your children when you are praying for your parents claiming them for their salvation that's what Paul ising the he says you and your house shall be saved so you apply the same faith believing in God that he will save your children children praise the name of then he says God God in tonight that every child and their children will all be in that glorious Happy Land where there is no sickness so old age of Sorrow may they receive this and may all of her children and her husband and all her loved ones and all that love her and all that she loves may they be there with her in the name of Jesus Christ that's how brother Bram was praying for this sister called so now if the grace of God has come down to us the same Grace that has saved us we need to see that it goes out to our household to your children to your parents to your friends to your relatives to your colleagues to your neighbors you need to live a right kind of life and then you need to pray for God that God May deliver them God May save them you keep on praying to God about them mentioning them Name by name praise the name of our Lord you mention the name of your son you mention the name of your parents you mention the name of your daughter mention the name of your friends and claim them praise the name of our Lord that the Lord can bring them into salvation praise the name of the Lord in the message token he says we must believe for our they did down in Egypt and also for the house like they did in Egypt and Jero and so forth and we find out I got a scripture WR here 16 ver1 where the Roman centuri was to take his own life and he was going to stab himself to death and Pa told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved it is go to be a houseold what made so many little kids what made so many women on the street what makes so much juvenile delence because we are not able to get our household under the blood praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we bring our household under the blood of Jesus Christ apply the token praise the name of our Lord now let us finish with Romans chapter 1 Romans chapter 1 and verse 9 he says for God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son and without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers he says I make mention of you always in my prayers that's how we need to claim our people continue praying to God mentioning them in prayers demanding them that Satan may lose them that Satan may get away from their lives Satan may stop influencing them that they may have a personal relationship with God praise the name of our Lord verse 10 making request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end you may be established praise the name of the Lord so Paul had Assurance he had a spiritual gift and then he said I want to impart my spiritual gift to you so that you may be established and if we have the token praise the name Lord we can use this token we can impart the token to influence others to turn to the way of the Lord and then the Bible says when they see your good works then they will turn to the Lord they will glorify the Lord like the other woman who had a drunk husband she imparted her spiritual gift which was salvation to turn the husband and her friends to the Lord Jesus and the Bible also tells us that if women have husbands who are not believer let us go to First Peter chapter 3 and then verse one likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be warned by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chest conversation coupled with fear praise the name of our Lord he says you can win your husband to turn to Christ by your conduct praise the name of Lord you are imparting to them that which you have received from the Lord and you are using what God has given you that you can bring them into the fold of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord we need to apply the token let us apply the token in

were taking clothes from the body of Paul and then when they lay on the sick they would recover and brother says that he has power on him so he was using that Old Testament scripture of Elijah that when Elijah The Other Woman told him that son is dead praise the name of the Lord there something God has given you that you can use to impart on praise the name of the Lord to church each of us has come with this token theil stand before us when each of us has applied the token we have come with our leaks of Fire and then we make this place a real big flame of fire we come out when they are
