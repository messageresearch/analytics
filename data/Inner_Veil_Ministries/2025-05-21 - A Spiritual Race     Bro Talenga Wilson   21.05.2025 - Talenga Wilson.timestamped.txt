[8:11] says it says the lily of

[8:19] you have a friend?

[13:02] liy of the
[13:05] valley. The bright and morning star.
[13:10] He's the fair of

[13:23] Loving precious heavenly father,
[13:27] we are so grateful to be in your
[13:29] presence
[13:31] tonight. And Lord, we want to thank you
[13:33] for such a special
[13:36] grace that each one of us has father
[13:39] shared from
[13:41] [Music]
[13:44] you to be able to come before your
[13:49] presence. I appreciate you
[13:52] father, for the gift of
[13:56] life for the
[13:58] protection and for
[14:01] provision towards each one of us.
[14:04] Father and Lord God, we have come to
[14:08] worship
[14:09] you. We have come to have fellowship
[14:11] with you.
[14:13] And father, Lord
[14:15] Jesus, you've appointed me
[14:18] tonight that Lord, I should represent
[14:21] you, Father,
[14:24] to speak your thought to the purchase of
[14:28] blood. I commit myself, Father, to
[14:32] you. I pray that, Lord, you may, Father,
[14:35] cleanse me, Father,
[14:39] and make me worthy to stand before your
[14:41] presence.
[14:44] to be able to deliver the message to
[14:46] your people
[14:48] tonight. I Lord commit the word that we
[14:51] are going to read and
[14:54] share that you may take it up and bless
[14:58] it that it may be a blessing to each one
[15:01] of
[15:02] us. I commit unto you Lord and
[15:06] congregation that father you may come
[15:08] down and circumcise Lord their ears
[15:13] that this word may go through their ears
[15:15] and deep down into their
[15:19] souls that it may be of benefit to our
[15:24] souls. We love you Lord and we thank
[15:27] you in the name of Jesus Christ we
[15:31] pray. Amen. Amen.
[15:35] Amen. God bless you.
[15:38] I want to appreciate you for your
[15:40] coming.
[15:43] to be part
[15:49] of. Thank you for coming. Be part of the
[15:51] fellowship.
[15:53] [Music]
[15:59] [Music]
[16:16] Okay. So, I want to welcome you to the
[16:18] reading of the
[16:21] word in the book of 1 Corinthians
[16:24] chapter
[16:26] 9. and we shall pick out verse 24 to
[16:33] 27. Amen. Amen. The Bible
[16:46] says, receiveth the prize. So run that
[16:50] you may
[17:07] obtain and every man that striveth for
[17:10] the mastery is temporate in all things.
[17:14] Now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[17:17] crown, but we are incorruptible.
[17:36] I therefore I therefore s not as certain
[17:40] not as certainly so fight I not as one
[17:44] that beatth the
[17:58] air but I keep under my my body and
[18:02] bring it into subjection, lest that by
[18:06] any means when I have preached to
[18:09] others, I myself should be a cast away.
[18:17] [Music]
[18:27] Let's also turn to Hebrews chapter 12
[18:30] verse 1 to verse
[18:34] 3. 12 verse 1 to verse
[18:44] three. Verse one says,
[18:47] "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[18:50] about with so great a cloud of witness,
[18:53] let us lay aside every weight and the
[18:56] sin which thou so easily beset us, and
[18:59] let us run with patience the race that
[19:02] is set before us.
[19:29] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[19:31] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[19:34] that was set before him endureth endured
[19:37] the cross, despised ing the shame. And
[19:40] he sat down at the right hand of the
[19:42] throne of God.
[20:11] For consider him that endure endured
[20:14] such contradiction of
[20:16] sinners against himself, lest you be
[20:20] wearied and faint in your minds.
[20:31] Is
[20:50] it May the Lord add a blessing listening
[20:52] to his word. We may be
[20:56] seated. Amen. Amen. So for our text
[21:01] tonight, my title shall be a spiritual
[21:09] race. A spiritual
[21:13] rest. Wrestling in the race.
[21:19] Praise the Lord. So we have taken two
[21:21] scriptures
[21:24] here where Paul was speaking to the to
[21:26] two churches.
[21:30] First he was speaking to the
[21:33] Corinthians and then in Hebrews he also
[21:36] said the same
[21:38] thing in Corinthians he said
[21:42] don't you know that they that run in a
[21:45] race or
[21:51] run but one receives the
[21:55] prize and he said so
[22:00] that you may obtain
[22:02] one. Praise the Lord. And then in verse
[22:06] three, he in verse two, he
[22:09] said that they that
[22:12] run they run to obtain a corruptible
[22:19] crowd. But then he said, "Unto
[22:23] we run to receive an incorruptible
[22:26] crown.
[22:29] So he said, "I also run
[22:33] therefore not as
[22:39] uncertainly so fight
[22:43] I not as one that beat the
[22:51] air." Praise the Lord.
[22:53] and he said, "I keep under my body and
[22:57] bring it into subjection."
[23:02] Then he said in
[23:04] Hebrews that now seeing that we are
[23:07] compassed with so great a cloud of
[23:15] witnesses, let us lay aside every
[23:20] weight and sin which so easily beset
[23:24] us. So he encourages
[23:27] us to lay aside every weight,
[23:33] to lay aside every
[23:35] sin that easily besets
[23:39] us, and then continue to run with
[23:42] patience the
[23:46] race which is set before
[23:50] us. Praise the Lord. In other
[23:54] words, there is a rest that is set
[23:57] before every
[24:03] Christian. And now he encourages
[24:06] us that in that
[24:08] race, there are so many things that
[24:11] beset
[24:14] us. But he said we should put all of
[24:17] them
[24:19] aside and strive to run with patience
[24:23] the rest that is set before us.
[24:31] So now in
[24:33] Corinthians he said those that
[24:36] run in the race in the social
[24:41] aspects they are after a corruptible
[24:46] crown. But now when he tells us to run
[24:49] here in
[24:51] Hebrews, he says as we are running in
[24:54] this
[24:55] race, we are not looking at a
[24:58] corruptible
[25:01] crown, but as we run the race that is
[25:04] set before
[25:07] us, we should look unto Jesus
[25:12] Christ who is the
[25:15] author and
[25:17] finisher of our faith.
[25:20] Praise the Lord. So now when we are
[25:22] running in this
[25:24] race, we are looking at Jesus Christ,
[25:29] our
[25:30] crown, our center of
[25:34] attention in this race is Jesus
[25:38] Christ. Praise the Lord. And now I want
[25:41] to give a
[25:43] definition of what a race
[25:46] means. A rest means a contest.
[25:56] Praise the Lord. A
[25:59] contest. When people are
[26:02] racing, they are
[26:05] contesting to see who can move fastest
[26:08] over a certain
[26:13] distance. So we can we can know there is
[26:16] so and so the fastest man in the
[26:20] world. You'll hear of
[26:23] teach. You'll hear of so many others
[26:26] being the fastest over certain
[26:28] distances.
[26:33] because they participated in a
[26:36] race and now in their
[26:39] race they all want to obtain a golden
[26:44] crown they use the target as they are
[26:49] running. So it has a starting
[26:53] point and then it has an ending
[26:56] point and said all of us begin the
[27:00] race and all of them begin to
[27:03] run and as they are
[27:05] running they are aiming at a corruptible
[27:10] crown, a gold
[27:13] medal, a
[27:15] silver, a bronze. There is something
[27:19] that is compelling them to participate
[27:21] in the
[27:23] race. Praise the living God. But now we
[27:27] are not talking about that
[27:31] race where men gather together and
[27:34] participate in a
[27:37] contest. Paul speaks about a spiritual
[27:42] race. and a spiritual
[27:44] rest. The dictionary says it's a journey
[27:47] of faith and
[27:53] perseverance. Is a journey of
[27:55] faith and perseverance as one strives to
[27:59] live according to the eternal purpose of
[28:08] God to be
[28:11] Christlike. And remember Paul
[28:13] said when we run in this
[28:16] race we are looking at our crown.
[28:21] Praise the Lord. So he never said you
[28:23] look at this you look at the other.
[28:27] He said looking unto Jesus Christ.
[28:32] And then he says Jesus Christ in this
[28:34] category
[28:36] is both the
[28:39] starter is both the
[28:42] author of this race and at the same
[28:47] time he who is the finisher of the
[28:51] race. So now where does this place every
[28:54] Christian?
[28:57] It is Christ who begins the
[29:00] rest. At the same time, it is Christ who
[29:03] finishes the
[29:04] rest. Where then are we
[29:08] placed? Praise the Lord. Now, where are
[29:11] we in in
[29:13] Christ? In this race, we are hidden in
[29:16] Christ
[29:19] Jesus. As we are participating in the
[29:23] race, we are not participating on our
[29:27] own. Praise the Lord. In the social
[29:31] aspects, if a race is
[29:34] announced that people begin to
[29:37] prepare, praise the Lord. They begin to
[29:42] practice. They run up and
[29:45] about to gain
[29:47] speed. So they are preparing for that
[29:52] day. Praise the Lord. So when it comes
[29:55] on that
[29:56] day, they now come to participate
[30:01] individually. But now here in the
[30:03] spiritual
[30:05] race, when Christ brings
[30:08] you, praise the Lord. He does not allow
[30:11] you to run the race
[30:15] alone. Praise the Lord. He begins the
[30:18] race with
[30:19] you and he takes you along through the
[30:24] journey to the end of the
[30:26] race. So now he begins this he becomes
[30:30] the
[30:32] starter the
[30:34] author of the race and again he is the
[30:38] finisher.
[30:41] starts with you from the start
[30:44] line to the finish
[30:47] line. That's why Paul
[30:50] says we are
[30:52] running. We are fighting not as one that
[30:56] beats the
[30:57] air. But we are running. We are fighting
[31:01] with
[31:04] purpose. Our
[31:06] purpose is to reach the finish line.
[31:10] And our finish
[31:11] line is perfection in Christ
[31:15] Jesus. And now there is no way you can
[31:18] get this
[31:21] perfection alone. It has to start with
[31:26] Jesus. It has to be with
[31:28] Jesus. It has to end with
[31:32] Jesus. Praise the living God. In the
[31:36] Greek
[31:37] lexone, the word The word race,
[31:42] it is agon in Greek. Agon
[31:47] meaning a
[31:49] fight. A race is a
[31:52] fight. So Christian
[31:56] brother
[31:58] called to
[31:59] sit. We have been called to a race to
[32:05] fight
[32:07] contention. It is a
[32:10] conflict. It has something to do with
[32:13] striving to do something or become
[32:19] something. It has to do with fighting
[32:23] something precious.
[32:27] So what are you fighting for in this
[32:31] race? Why are you in the
[32:35] race in the Christian
[32:37] race? Praise the Lord. So now when
[32:40] you're participating in this
[32:43] race it has it must come with
[32:49] preparation in the social
[32:52] aspect in the social in the social
[32:57] activities there are
[33:01] preparations. So in every
[33:03] race whether it is a car
[33:07] race or it is
[33:10] wrestling people have to
[33:14] prepare if if there's going to be a car
[33:17] racing. The drivers have to
[33:22] prepare. They train
[33:25] themselves. They check the
[33:28] car. They get the best mechanics.
[33:33] and they get the best
[33:36] materials. They make sure the car is in
[33:38] a perfect condition for the
[33:44] rest and they don't allow
[33:46] it to run until it reaches the touch
[33:50] line.
[33:53] those conditions and
[33:56] preparations in the preparation for the
[34:01] rest. Praise the Lord. And now when they
[34:05] announce that there is going to be a
[34:09] race. Praise the Lord. It catches the
[34:13] attention of so many
[34:15] people. Many people want to be part of
[34:19] it. Many people want to spectate.
[34:23] They want to see what takes
[34:26] place when they are not participating in
[34:28] the
[34:30] race. And now those that are in the
[34:34] race begin to influence those that are
[34:37] outside
[34:39] it. Praise the Lord. Begin to influence
[34:44] them. Remember the one that is
[34:46] participating has a vision.
[34:54] and the
[34:56] vision. Their goal is to get the
[34:59] prize. But as they
[35:03] participating, they are also influencing
[35:07] those that are that are looking
[35:11] on. Praise the Lord. This exactly
[35:14] happens in the spiritual
[35:21] participating in this
[35:23] race. We must get adequate
[35:29] preparations. What do we need to prepare
[35:31] for the
[35:34] race? You must be
[35:37] armored. You must have
[35:41] armor. Praise the Lord. And now Paul
[35:44] calls
[35:45] it the armor of God.
[35:49] Praise the Lord. So what is the
[35:52] armor? You must have the word of God
[35:54] with
[35:55] you. And you must have the
[35:59] faith to be part of the
[36:02] race. Praise the Lord. And now when you
[36:05] begin the
[36:07] race, it comes along with influence.
[36:12] While in the social
[36:14] aspects they influence the
[36:19] masses and the people want to be like
[36:22] them. People begin to put on
[36:26] attires names of
[36:30] participants. That means the
[36:31] participants have a direct influence on
[36:34] the people around them.
[36:41] They have an
[36:46] influence. Those that are watching
[36:49] them even in this spiritual
[36:54] race, those that are participating in
[36:56] the spiritual
[36:58] race have an
[37:01] influence on those that are not yet
[37:03] there in the
[37:04] race. So when God calls us to this
[37:08] race, we ought to be extra
[37:12] careful. Observe the principles in his
[37:18] race. Praise the Lord because while you
[37:22] are walking in his
[37:24] race, you are having an influence to
[37:27] those that are close to
[37:31] you. Praise the Lord. And now if you
[37:34] have children, you're a
[37:36] parent and now you are moving in this
[37:39] spiritual
[37:43] race, your life, your character has an
[37:47] influence to those that are closest to
[37:51] you. So now if you got a wrong
[37:55] character, it directly affects the
[37:57] children that are closest to you.
[38:02] So if you have a loose
[38:05] tongue, a loose
[38:09] tongue will directly affect your
[38:14] children. So while in this
[38:17] race, we must be extra
[38:21] careful. Keep the
[38:24] principles of him that called us to this
[38:27] race.
[38:30] raise the living
[38:32] God. And Paul says,
[38:35] "Fight as one that does not be the
[38:40] heir, but laying
[38:43] aside every
[38:46] weight of any
[38:49] sin that does so easily beset
[38:52] you, examining yourself daily in the
[38:58] word to know if you're living up the
[39:02] standards of the
[39:06] Yes. Praise the Lord. He says, "We are
[39:10] not looking for a corruptible
[39:14] crown, but we are looking to that which
[39:16] is
[39:18] incorruptible." And now he says, "As
[39:20] you're running,
[39:22] friends, your eyes should be on Jesus
[39:27] Christ. As you're
[39:29] running, you look away to
[39:33] Jesus. Praise the Lord because it is him
[39:37] who has the
[39:39] resources that we need in this
[39:42] race. Praise the Lord. Let's go to
[39:45] Ephesians
[39:47] [Music]
[39:49] 6:1. What are these
[39:52] resources? Praise the Lord.
[39:57] Put on the whole armor of
[40:00] God that you may be able to stand
[40:02] against the ws of the
[40:09] devil. Verse
[40:12] 13, wherefore take unto you the whole
[40:16] armor of
[40:18] God. Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 verse
[40:21] 13.
[40:28] that you may be able to withstand in the
[40:31] evil
[40:34] day. While we are in this
[40:37] race, we must carry along the armor of
[40:43] God because without the armor of
[40:47] God, there is no protection.
[40:50] When you
[40:53] fail and fall
[40:55] down, you'll hurt
[40:58] yourself. But when you are protected by
[41:00] the armor of
[41:04] God, the ever living word of
[41:07] God, he will protect you from falling.
[41:12] That's why Paul
[41:13] says but when you take this armor of
[41:19] God be able to withstand in the evil
[41:25] day and having done all
[41:28] that you'll be able to
[41:32] stand. Praise the Lord. When does the
[41:35] rest
[41:38] start? When we accept Jesus Christ as
[41:41] our Lord and personal
[41:45] savior, while you are still out
[41:48] there, you're not in the race. When we
[41:51] were still out
[41:52] there, not in the race. But the day we
[41:56] accepted him as our Lord and personal
[41:59] savior,
[42:04] set us up to the
[42:07] rest. And what is the purpose of the
[42:10] rest? Leading us to
[42:15] perfection is leading us to
[42:17] perfection. And when we get to
[42:21] perfection, then leads us to
[42:24] eternity. The overall purpose of this
[42:28] race is to lead us to eternal
[42:32] life. Praise the Lord. How do we get
[42:36] there? First of all, we get to
[42:39] him. He says, "Behold, I stand at the
[42:42] door and
[42:45] knock." And how does he knock? By
[42:48] speaking his word to our
[42:50] hearts. And when you receive the word
[42:53] and you accept him,
[42:56] Then you open the door for him to come
[42:58] and
[43:00] enter. Then when he enters in
[43:02] there, he now sets you to a
[43:06] journey. He sets you up to the
[43:09] rest. You begin running your
[43:13] race. And now while in the
[43:16] world, the rest is between
[43:21] people. You're containing against
[43:23] people.
[43:25] But now here we are not contending
[43:29] against
[43:31] anyone. You're not contesting against
[43:33] your brother or your
[43:37] sister. You're not racing against you're
[43:40] not fighting or you're not
[43:44] competing. You're not competing against
[43:46] one
[43:48] another. But this is a personal race.
[43:54] personal
[43:56] journey. Praise the Lord. If there is
[43:59] anything for you to achieve the gift of
[44:01] this
[44:06] race, the
[44:09] competition, the
[44:11] competition has to be between you and
[44:15] yourself. That's why Paul
[44:18] says aside every wage
[44:23] Praise the Lord. The weight is not
[44:25] between you and your brother or your
[44:28] sister, but the weight between you and
[44:31] [Applause]
[44:33] yourself. In other words, you have the
[44:36] instruments of
[44:39] faith. You have the word of
[44:42] God which is your
[44:44] armor through which you examine yourself
[44:47] daily.
[44:50] Praise the Lord. As you're
[44:53] running, you look at the
[44:55] word
[44:57] mirror because he examines your
[45:01] requirements. So now you check through
[45:04] the word of
[45:05] God. You see that there is something
[45:08] somewhere that is not right.
[45:11] You now put yourself
[45:14] together and you you you take it unto
[45:17] God because in this
[45:20] race has not left us to run
[45:24] alone because we have Jesus who is the
[45:29] author with
[45:32] us and he runs along with us. So when we
[45:36] get
[45:38] weary, praise the Lord, when we get
[45:41] weary, praise the Lord, he has our
[45:46] strength, that's why he says, our
[45:49] perfect strength in times of
[45:53] weakness. Praise the Lord. As we are
[45:56] running this
[45:58] race, examine yourself daily in the
[46:03] word. Praise the Lord. This rest
[46:07] brother is not influenced by someone
[46:11] else. This rest
[46:14] brother should not be against anyone
[46:17] else. Praise the Lord. It has to be
[46:20] between you and
[46:23] yourself because it is a personal walk
[46:26] with Christ.
[46:29] And now when we had received the
[46:32] crown, the crown is not a group
[46:37] affair. It is not a family
[46:41] affair. It is not a church
[46:44] affair. It is an individual
[46:48] affair. Praise the Lord. It does not
[46:51] matter where you where you go church.
[46:54] Um whether you go to a very strong and
[46:57] powerful
[46:59] church or you go to a small
[47:02] church as long as you've been caught in
[47:04] this
[47:07] race now becomes a personal journey with
[47:11] your
[47:13] God. But if you examine
[47:16] yourself, you don't examine yourself in
[47:19] the light of others.
[47:23] Examine yourself in light of the
[47:31] word. You look away to
[47:34] Jesus who is the author and finisher of
[47:38] your
[47:39] faith. Praise the Lord. Now when you
[47:42] look at your
[47:44] brother, you shall
[47:46] fail because your brother could have a
[47:49] certain form of weakness.
[47:53] But when you come to see their
[47:55] weakness, your strength will fail
[47:59] you because you put your attention on
[48:02] your
[48:04] brother running in the same race with
[48:08] you. So our
[48:10] attention should be onto Jesus Christ
[48:13] and Christ
[48:17] alone. Praise the never living God. Run
[48:21] the
[48:22] race with
[48:24] patience. Run your
[48:26] race with
[48:28] patience, looking at Jesus
[48:31] Christ who is the author and finisher of
[48:34] your
[48:36] faith. Praise the Lord. And now when
[48:39] you're running the
[48:41] race, you got to be
[48:47] patient. You got to be patient.
[48:52] Praise the Lord. Paul says, "Run and
[48:55] race with
[49:00] patience." With patience
[49:03] because there are so many hurdles along
[49:06] the
[49:07] way. There are so many challenges along
[49:10] your spiritual
[49:13] journey. Praise the Lord. So, you have
[49:16] to be patient.
[49:19] Because when you
[49:21] rush, you are likely to
[49:24] fail. But when you are
[49:27] patient, in other
[49:29] words, run this race when you
[49:36] surrendered. Praise the Lord. When
[49:39] you're running the
[49:41] race, you have to be
[49:44] surrendered. Praise the Lord. You're not
[49:47] running as the world
[49:49] does because in the world
[49:53] athletics, it has to be your
[49:56] energy. But in the spiritual the
[49:59] spiritual
[50:01] race, not your strength
[50:03] anymore, but it is your total
[50:07] surrender to the leadership of the Holy
[50:11] Spirit. That's why he says you have to
[50:13] run the race with patience.
[50:17] So when you find hurdles along the
[50:21] way, you are
[50:23] surrendered and you ask
[50:26] God and then you sit
[50:29] back and continue the
[50:32] journey whether you get through it
[50:36] immediately, whether you overcome
[50:39] immediately or after some
[50:42] time. It all works for
[50:45] good. All you got to do is to be
[50:50] patient. Praise the living
[50:54] God. Now, when you are
[50:58] patient, you allow Christ
[51:01] himself to take you
[51:04] through. Praise the
[51:06] Lord.
[51:08] Weak. Praise the Lord. You got to avail
[51:11] yourself
[51:14] there. You know what the Bible
[51:17] says? He knocks
[51:20] at the door. Praise the
[51:23] Lord.
[51:25] Ask and it shall be
[51:27] given. That means until you
[51:31] ask. Praise the Lord. And yet God knows
[51:34] what we
[51:36] want. In the scriptures, he says before
[51:38] we ask,
[51:41] He knows what we want to ask
[51:45] for. Then he goes ahead and says
[51:49] ask and it shall be given to you. Now
[51:52] even in this
[51:53] race, you have to be
[51:58] available. You have to be available to
[52:05] God. Praise the Lord. Avail yourself.
[52:10] because there is no way God is going to
[52:12] take you
[52:14] through you being
[52:17] there. Praise the Lord. So you have to
[52:20] be
[52:20] there for God to take you
[52:25] through. Praise the Lord. So now when
[52:28] you are
[52:29] there and your faith
[52:33] shrinks then he lifts up your faith.
[52:38] He lifts up your
[52:42] face because you are totally
[52:46] surrendered. Praise the Lord. You've
[52:48] accepted him. You've taken him as your
[52:51] Lord and personal
[52:53] savior. Because you have
[52:57] believed. So you set your
[53:00] eyes. You set your
[53:02] mind. You set your expectations.
[53:06] set your
[53:08] feelings, all your desires onto
[53:12] him and you lose yourself of
[53:17] everything for you to be able to win
[53:20] this
[53:21] battle for us to win this
[53:24] battle. We must lose
[53:27] ourselves for Christ to
[53:29] live. That's why Paul
[53:32] says die
[53:35] daily because when you don't
[53:37] die there is no way Christ will come to
[53:42] live. So now in this
[53:45] journey we got to
[53:48] die. We got to lose
[53:51] ourselves. Lose our
[53:54] expectations. Lose our expectations.
[54:00] our
[54:01] desires, lose our
[54:04] ambitions, and then let God
[54:10] lead. And wherever he leads
[54:13] us, we shall
[54:16] follow. And as long as he's
[54:19] leading, we shall never
[54:22] fail. Praise the Lord. Spiritual
[54:26] race. Run the race with patience.
[54:32] Now when you get
[54:35] surrendered, Christ steps
[54:37] in to take a new walk with
[54:41] you and now he leads us to the way of
[54:47] perfection. Praise the Lord. And now the
[54:50] Bible says when he is
[54:55] come, praise the Lord, he the Holy
[54:58] Spirit
[55:00] When he the word of
[55:03] God, when he Jesus Christ is
[55:06] come, praise the Lord, he shall guide us
[55:10] through all
[55:14] truth. And now he does not only lead us
[55:17] through all
[55:19] truth, but he also gives us
[55:23] strength. He gives us encouragement.
[55:28] us up when we are
[55:31] failing. Why? Because he is the
[55:34] author and
[55:36] finisher of this
[55:38] race. So whatever may be
[55:42] tied. We are completely at
[55:46] rest. When the battle
[55:50] rages, it's upon him to raise a
[55:54] standard. Why? because you have sold
[55:57] yourself to him
[56:00] and you have made yourself available to
[56:03] him.
[56:05] Praise the Lord. How do you sell
[56:07] yourself to
[56:08] him? When you have totally surrendered
[56:11] of
[56:15] yourself, when your intellectual
[56:19] knowledge no longer
[56:21] applies, but your faith applies.
[56:25] Praise the Lord. When your
[56:27] education no longer
[56:29] applies but
[56:32] himself. Praise the Lord. So now when
[56:35] you completely get
[56:37] lost, he finds
[56:40] you because he came to seek them that
[56:43] are
[56:44] lost. So you have to be
[56:47] lost for him to find you. There is no
[56:51] way he'll find you if you are not
[56:54] lost and you are lost
[56:57] what? You are lost to
[57:02] yourself and get you you lost
[57:09] yourself like you are lost to you
[57:12] yourself. So you allow so you completely
[57:15] get lost
[57:17] to what?
[57:18] To yourself.
[57:20] In other words, you are not living by
[57:24] yourself.
[57:26] But you're living by
[57:28] that. You're living by
[57:32] that which you are living by that which
[57:35] you
[57:38] received, the word of God. So when you
[57:41] begin to live by the word of
[57:45] God, the word of God being yes and amen,
[57:51] You have to live by the will of
[57:57] God. Get lost of
[58:00] yourself and then allow God to direct
[58:05] you. Praise the living God. That's what
[58:09] happens. You got to present yourself and
[58:12] rest
[58:14] there. You don't fight yourself to
[58:17] holiness.
[58:20] Praise the Lord. He that has called you,
[58:24] as long as you avail yourself and
[58:26] surrender and be
[58:29] obedient, he will lead you to
[58:33] holiness. Praise the Lord because
[58:36] holiness is a part of this
[58:38] race. Because when he calls us, he calls
[58:42] us to
[58:43] holiness. Praise the Lord. He himself is
[58:48] holy and in him there is no
[58:51] sin. That's why Paul
[58:54] says now that he has called us unto
[58:58] himself our
[59:01] requirement to be part of this
[59:04] race. He surrender every weight that is
[59:07] holding you
[59:09] [Music]
[59:11] back and avail yourself to him.
[59:15] Then God himself begins to take you
[59:19] through. He takes you through every
[59:22] thick and thin.
[59:26] Praise the Lord. And he takes you
[59:29] through and he leads you
[59:31] through. He gives you
[59:33] grace. Grace after grace.
[59:37] When you find a situation
[59:41] and then you feel you are completely
[59:44] finished somehow he gives you sufficient
[59:48] grace to walk over
[59:51] it. Why? Because you are not living by
[59:55] yourself but you are depending upon him
[59:58] and his holiness.
[1:00:02] So every battle that is setting before
[1:00:05] you, you are not going to win it because
[1:00:08] of
[1:00:09] yourself. But you are completely rested
[1:00:12] in his word and you are
[1:00:16] sure that he has the
[1:00:19] power to help you win the
[1:00:23] battle. Let's look at the character
[1:00:25] David when his
[1:00:28] race. He did not rest against
[1:00:32] anybody. Praise the Lord. David was
[1:00:36] anointed
[1:00:37] king over
[1:00:40] Israel while Paul was still
[1:00:44] alive. But now David was a man tested of
[1:00:48] the
[1:00:51] Lord. He was a
[1:00:53] warrior and he'd been approved of God.
[1:00:58] Praise the Lord. He was in the mind of
[1:01:00] God to run the rest to a perfect
[1:01:06] man. He never fought against
[1:01:10] S. Rather, he accepted
[1:01:13] him because he
[1:01:15] knew he had the mind of
[1:01:18] God. He knew that Saul was not an
[1:01:23] enemy. So was his fellow brother.
[1:01:31] Praise the
[1:01:35] Lord. Why? Because he had the mind of
[1:01:40] God. He knew that it had anointed
[1:01:46] him to be
[1:01:53] king. He anointed him.
[1:01:56] was still
[1:02:07] alive to die before David was anointed.
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:25] He
[1:02:29] loved
[1:02:34] him, but he prayed for him. He protected
[1:02:39] him. Praise the Lord.
[1:02:54] the mind of
[1:02:57] God with the mind of
[1:03:03] God that we are
[1:03:09] restraise the Lord will bless us
[1:03:15] differently us with different gifts
[1:03:20] put us different
[1:03:31] a brother or a
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:40] sister. Praise the Lord. How to be in
[1:03:43] the mind of
[1:03:45] David. We should not compete with
[1:03:50] them, but we should love
[1:03:52] them to fellowship with
[1:03:55] them. Praise the
[1:03:57] Lord. Reverend
[1:04:01] David
[1:04:03] never
[1:04:09] even given a certain level of anointing
[1:04:12] above that
[1:04:26] of their gifts.
[1:04:29] God has blessed
[1:04:34] one. We should live
[1:04:38] as competition with one
[1:04:42] another. Praise the Lord. The mind of
[1:04:46] Christ because everything all work
[1:04:50] together for
[1:04:54] good. The body of Jesus Christ
[1:04:59] Even in the
[1:05:01] natural, in the finan
[1:05:08] blessings when God blessed your
[1:05:15] neighbor. You don't have to hate
[1:05:18] them. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:32] lay
[1:05:34] aside every
[1:05:36] weight. So now when hate comes in your
[1:05:40] heart, praise the Lord to envy your
[1:05:43] brother. To eny your brother, to ene
[1:05:47] your
[1:05:50] neighbor. Praise the Lord because they
[1:05:53] are better than you are at the
[1:05:56] moment. If the spirit of envy
[1:06:00] develops, you should run straight to
[1:06:04] Christ and carry that burden to Jesus
[1:06:08] Christ. In so doing, you are
[1:06:12] laying off your putting away every
[1:06:16] weight that may come between you and
[1:06:19] your
[1:06:21] God. Praise the Lord. We have to lay
[1:06:25] aside
[1:06:27] every wage, anything that comes in
[1:06:32] between between you and your God in this
[1:06:36] race. His
[1:06:39] envy, give it to Christ because God
[1:06:43] provided for this
[1:06:45] rest. He provided a perfect
[1:06:50] sacrifice and that's why the sacrifice
[1:06:52] is on the
[1:06:54] altar and the Bible says the
[1:06:58] blood upon the altar
[1:07:01] for our
[1:07:04] atonement. If there is that bit of
[1:07:08] weight, bring it to the
[1:07:11] altar for your
[1:07:13] atonement. God provided for
[1:07:17] that. Don't judge
[1:07:19] yourself. Don't crucify
[1:07:22] yourself because you have a certain form
[1:07:25] of
[1:07:27] weakness. God provided for your
[1:07:31] weakness. Lay it
[1:07:33] aside by casting it to Jesus
[1:07:37] Christ. Praise the Lord such that you
[1:07:40] lighten your journey.
[1:07:43] Praise the Lord. Because if you have all
[1:07:45] this
[1:07:47] weight, there is no way you are going to
[1:07:49] run the
[1:07:51] race to the finish line. You need to get
[1:07:57] right. That's why Paul tells
[1:08:00] us lay
[1:08:03] aside, examine
[1:08:05] yourself and lay every weight
[1:08:09] aside. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:12] Anything that comes between you and your
[1:08:15] God,
[1:08:17] lay it
[1:08:18] aside, praise the Lord. You don't have
[1:08:22] to run
[1:08:24] away. No, you run towards
[1:08:28] Christ. And now as you are
[1:08:31] moving our
[1:08:33] eyes, the Bible says we look at nothing
[1:08:36] else.
[1:08:39] We're not looking at an individual.
[1:08:43] But we are looking at Jesus
[1:08:46] Christ. Praise the Lord. We are looking
[1:08:49] at Jesus Christ.
[1:08:51] Praise the Lord. Because the purpose of
[1:08:53] the
[1:08:55] race is to be like
[1:08:58] him. And there's no way we can be like
[1:09:02] him if you are not looking at
[1:09:05] him. We have to look at him continually.
[1:09:10] I want to bring something from the Old
[1:09:13] Testament. This man
[1:09:16] Abraham, praise the Lord, God called him
[1:09:20] and God gave him a
[1:09:23] promise. So God called him to a
[1:09:26] race and he put him in a race and a race
[1:09:30] he told
[1:09:32] him. He says, "I have a promise I'm
[1:09:34] making for you.
[1:09:37] Come leave your land where you were
[1:09:41] born. Come into this
[1:09:44] race. When you come, this is the gift
[1:09:48] I'm going to give
[1:09:50] you. He said, "There is this
[1:09:53] land. I am going to give it to you and
[1:09:55] to your
[1:09:57] children." That was a
[1:09:59] promise. Praise the Lord. So now he also
[1:10:02] gave him another
[1:10:03] promise that you shall have a son.
[1:10:08] Praise the Lord. But now he told him
[1:10:11] first of all come.
[1:10:13] So now Abraham
[1:10:16] had to make himself
[1:10:21] available for the
[1:10:23] rest in order for
[1:10:26] him to get this
[1:10:29] promise. Praise the Lord. He had to make
[1:10:32] himself obedient.
[1:10:36] Praise the Lord to the
[1:10:39] promise which he had received from
[1:10:42] God in order for him to obtain
[1:10:45] it. So now Abraham left his
[1:10:49] land and he made himself available to
[1:10:54] God not knowing where he was
[1:10:58] going. So in other words, he surrendered
[1:11:02] himself and he got lost of
[1:11:07] himself for God to find him. And the
[1:11:10] moment he got lost of himself and his
[1:11:14] people, God took a hold of
[1:11:17] him and God started leading him through
[1:11:20] the
[1:11:21] way. Praise the Lord. As Abraham, he
[1:11:26] faced so many challenges.
[1:11:30] But each time he faced the
[1:11:33] challenge, he put his eyes onto the
[1:11:37] promise. Praise the Lord. Remember that
[1:11:40] there is a reason why he left his
[1:11:44] land. There is a reason why you left
[1:11:47] your land to come to the gospel of Jesus
[1:11:52] Christ. There is a reason why God called
[1:11:54] us from outside to come to the gospel of
[1:11:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:00] We have to be like
[1:12:02] Abraham. But every time we face calamity
[1:12:05] along the
[1:12:06] way, we have to remember the promise
[1:12:09] that he gave
[1:12:12] us when he called us
[1:12:15] out. Praise the Lord. In
[1:12:19] Philippians, praise the Lord. It says,
[1:12:21] "Faithful is
[1:12:24] he that called us." So he never call us
[1:12:28] to
[1:12:30] nothing but he call us to
[1:12:33] something. He says being confident of
[1:12:35] this very thing being confident of this
[1:12:38] very thing.
[1:12:42] Philippians 1:6.
[1:12:44] Okay. Being confident of this very thing
[1:12:48] that he which has begun a good work in
[1:12:51] you will perform it until the day of
[1:12:53] Jesus Christ.
[1:13:05] So Genesis chapter
[1:13:08] 12 verse one, God calls him
[1:13:12] out. And says,
[1:13:14] Abraham, this is the
[1:13:17] portion only if you
[1:13:20] accept. Praise the Lord. Seek here
[1:13:24] first.
[1:13:25] the kingdom of
[1:13:27] God. Praise the Lord. Seek first the
[1:13:31] kingdom of God and his
[1:13:35] righteousness. Praise the Lord. He opens
[1:13:38] the
[1:13:39] door and he points us to all the
[1:13:41] treasures that are in
[1:13:44] there. All the things that you have need
[1:13:47] of, you'll find them here. But only if
[1:13:51] you have sought the kingdom of God.
[1:13:55] That is a promise. And now here, he
[1:13:59] says, being confident of this very
[1:14:03] thing, that he
[1:14:07] that called us,
[1:14:09] he that started the good
[1:14:13] work. Praise the Lord will make it to
[1:14:16] accomplish.
[1:14:18] Praise the Lord. Abraham
[1:14:21] put his attention
[1:14:24] to that
[1:14:25] promise. So he went through the
[1:14:29] rest. He never looked at affairs of
[1:14:34] others. He moved along with
[1:14:38] Sarah. He moved along with Sarah, his
[1:14:42] wife. He moved along with
[1:14:45] Lot, his brother's son.
[1:14:50] But now he never looked at them in the
[1:14:55] rest. But his
[1:14:58] race was all
[1:15:01] directed by the
[1:15:04] promise. Praise the Lord. It even came
[1:15:07] to a
[1:15:08] point when Sarah doubted the
[1:15:12] promise
[1:15:14] but never
[1:15:17] staggered. to a point of
[1:15:20] contention and Lot began to fight for
[1:15:23] the
[1:15:25] land. Abraham, he never looked at
[1:15:28] that because that's not what God had
[1:15:31] promised
[1:15:33] him and given him a
[1:15:36] promise that he would inherit a
[1:15:40] land and even his children would inherit
[1:15:44] it. So now he never fought with Lot.
[1:15:48] He left Lord to fight for the
[1:15:50] land and Lord took what he thought was
[1:15:53] the
[1:15:55] best and in the end we know what
[1:15:58] happened to
[1:16:00] him because Abraham kept his position in
[1:16:04] the
[1:16:06] race. God gave him the
[1:16:09] promise. Praise the Lord. And we look at
[1:16:12] so many of these
[1:16:15] characters. We look at the man
[1:16:18] Daniel in a strange
[1:16:20] land. Praise the Lord with a few of his
[1:16:25] friends in with a few of his
[1:16:29] friends. Praise the Lord in Babylon. You
[1:16:33] know they were
[1:16:34] there. They had no backing of anybody in
[1:16:38] the
[1:16:40] land but they only had the word.
[1:16:44] Praise the Lord. And God, as long as his
[1:16:48] word remains
[1:16:51] there, he shall always protect it at all
[1:16:55] costs. Praise the Lord. So if we have
[1:16:58] received the word of
[1:17:00] God, keep the word of
[1:17:02] God. Praise the Lord. If you have
[1:17:05] received the word of
[1:17:06] God, look for the word of God.
[1:17:11] And the Bible says don't fight as one
[1:17:14] that beats the
[1:17:16] air but fight as one who knows what they
[1:17:19] are fighting
[1:17:22] for. You must have a
[1:17:25] revelation for which you are fighting in
[1:17:28] this
[1:17:29] race. Praise the Lord. And your
[1:17:32] revelation should be
[1:17:35] that your
[1:17:37] revelation should be that your life is
[1:17:41] not ending here but that there is a
[1:17:45] life after here. There is a life that is
[1:17:50] free from
[1:17:51] burdens. There is a life that is free
[1:17:55] from there is a life that is free from
[1:17:58] tears.
[1:18:00] There is a life that has been promised
[1:18:03] in this
[1:18:05] world. And if we believe
[1:18:07] it, we shall come to that
[1:18:10] life because that is our
[1:18:14] promise. The promise is to get eternal
[1:18:18] life. What is that eternal life? That
[1:18:21] eternal life. The word of
[1:18:25] God. Praise the Lord. It is not in great
[1:18:28] speakers.
[1:18:30] is not in great
[1:18:32] speakers. It is not in great
[1:18:35] men. That
[1:18:37] life is in the word of
[1:18:40] God. Praise the Lord. So if you have
[1:18:43] received the word of
[1:18:45] God, by the word of God, live by the
[1:18:48] word of God. Everything that you do,
[1:18:52] live by the word of
[1:18:56] God. and the rest of the
[1:18:59] friends lived by the word that they had
[1:19:04] received. Praise the Lord. If you go and
[1:19:07] read the book of
[1:19:08] Daniel chapter one from verse
[1:19:11] one, Daniel had been given favor of the
[1:19:15] Lord. God had given them
[1:19:18] wisdom and he says he provided
[1:19:22] them with
[1:19:24] everything that they
[1:19:26] required to obtain favor before the
[1:19:31] king. So he gave them the word and the
[1:19:34] word contained everything that they
[1:19:38] desired to receive favor before the
[1:19:42] king. God has given us his
[1:19:45] word and the word of
[1:19:48] God contains
[1:19:51] everything that we
[1:19:53] need to live in this life and the life
[1:19:55] after
[1:19:57] here. Praise the Lord. We need a job.
[1:20:02] The job is not from anywhere
[1:20:04] else. Obey the word of
[1:20:07] God. Seek
[1:20:09] God. Seek his righteousness.
[1:20:13] things will
[1:20:14] come. Praise the Lord. It may take a
[1:20:17] little
[1:20:18] longer for certain reasons. For certain
[1:20:22] reasons, but
[1:20:25] certainly it shall
[1:20:27] come. Praise the Lord. And now Daniel,
[1:20:30] he was there. And now one day the king
[1:20:34] had a
[1:20:35] dream and nobody was able to
[1:20:39] interpret. It would be a time
[1:20:44] for Daniel to come and show
[1:20:47] off his
[1:20:49] wisdom, show off his
[1:20:53] gifts. They remained
[1:20:56] humble. Daniel remained humble because
[1:20:59] he
[1:21:01] knew he was not the one leading the
[1:21:05] rest. It was God that was leading the
[1:21:08] rest. And what happened when they got
[1:21:11] the
[1:21:12] news? He told his house and his
[1:21:17] friends and pray and wait on the
[1:21:21] Lord, running the race with
[1:21:26] patience. They waited on the
[1:21:30] Lord to reveal unto him what it
[1:21:35] was. Praise the Lord. And even when they
[1:21:38] were
[1:21:39] brought near the table of the king,
[1:21:44] Daniel, because they knew what they had
[1:21:49] believed and they knew what their
[1:21:51] compass
[1:21:54] was. Praise the Lord. When they brought
[1:21:58] meat that had been sacrificed to
[1:22:03] idols, you know, they were at the table
[1:22:07] And they had access to what king fed
[1:22:14] on
[1:22:15] food, eating meat. But when they brought
[1:22:19] this meat at the table, he looked at
[1:22:23] it and he told the
[1:22:26] unk that this one
[1:22:29] here, according to the foundation of our
[1:22:34] character, according to the word which
[1:22:37] guides
[1:22:39] us, according to what the word by which
[1:22:42] we
[1:22:44] live, we doing he examines examined his
[1:22:49] life with the word of
[1:22:52] God because the word of God prohibited
[1:22:56] them from eating meat sacrificed unto
[1:23:02] idols as much as it was good
[1:23:04] food as long as it was
[1:23:08] contrary to the word he said we're not
[1:23:11] going to eat
[1:23:13] this was very worried
[1:23:17] What shall we do? The king will behead
[1:23:21] me. If I take back this food and you go
[1:23:26] hungry, my friend, don't worry. Don't
[1:23:31] worry. Praise the Lord. And then he told
[1:23:34] them, you know what you're going to
[1:23:36] do? Give us
[1:23:40] vegetables. Give us
[1:23:42] do. Praise the Lord. Take away your
[1:23:45] meat.
[1:23:46] Take out your
[1:23:48] rice because this is contrary to the
[1:23:52] word. How many of
[1:23:54] us can
[1:23:56] stand to reject certain
[1:24:00] things to reject certain
[1:24:04] appointments to reject certain
[1:24:06] appointments or benefits in
[1:24:10] life because they
[1:24:13] contradict with the word of
[1:24:16] God. But as long
[1:24:18] as you are led of the word
[1:24:23] Praise the Lord. You will go, you'll
[1:24:26] always go by what the word tells you to
[1:24:28] do. Even if it's a a very nice
[1:24:32] job, but if that
[1:24:34] job defends the word of the
[1:24:38] Lord, the spirit of God, the word of God
[1:24:42] in
[1:24:42] you, the life of Christ in you will make
[1:24:46] you to reject that
[1:24:49] offer. Not because you have work to do,
[1:24:53] but because the life on the inside of
[1:24:56] you does not
[1:24:58] align with the job that you've been
[1:25:02] offered. Daniel did
[1:25:04] it. Give us give us
[1:25:07] vegetables and give us water and test us
[1:25:11] for 10
[1:25:13] days and see what will happen of
[1:25:16] us. And now after 10
[1:25:19] days saw that
[1:25:23] Daniel we are looking so healthy.
[1:25:28] And the Bible says they were they had
[1:25:29] put on
[1:25:32] weight more than those that we are
[1:25:34] feeding on
[1:25:36] meat. Praise the Lord. That was a
[1:25:40] testimony. Praise the Lord. So now this
[1:25:42] man looked at
[1:25:45] them
[1:25:47] astonished and he desired so much
[1:25:50] Daniel and he desired so much what they
[1:25:52] had
[1:25:54] believed to the meat. Praise the Lord
[1:25:58] because he knew that this was not to
[1:26:00] their
[1:26:02] standards. He calls us. He calls us to
[1:26:06] certain standards in
[1:26:10] life. Praise the Lord. When he calls us
[1:26:13] this
[1:26:14] race, he sets certain standards in our
[1:26:19] journeys. There are things that we we
[1:26:22] shall
[1:26:23] do and there are things we must not
[1:26:26] do. And
[1:26:28] somehow you will not wait for a pastor
[1:26:30] to tell
[1:26:32] you not to do it. But the life on the
[1:26:36] inside of
[1:26:37] you will tell you this is not right for
[1:26:40] me to
[1:26:42] do and you want to do it. Praise the
[1:26:46] Lord. Now when you somehow compel to do
[1:26:50] it and you find that you have
[1:26:53] fallen, it is not over for
[1:26:57] you. When I'm
[1:26:59] weak, then I am
[1:27:02] strong. Why? Because when you call upon
[1:27:05] Jesus, when you run back to him, you go
[1:27:09] and confess to him, you can't ask him
[1:27:11] for grace and
[1:27:13] pardon. His grace is still
[1:27:17] sufficient because he started the
[1:27:22] race and he's not going to leave us
[1:27:24] along the
[1:27:26] way. He will have to finish the
[1:27:31] race. Praise the Lord. God was right
[1:27:34] there with Daniel.
[1:27:37] God was right there with Abraham.
[1:27:41] God was right there with with David.
[1:27:46] God is right here with us.
[1:27:50] Praise the Lord. We may not experience
[1:27:52] the the same
[1:27:57] experiences that they
[1:27:59] had. Praise the Lord. But through our
[1:28:02] experiences in this
[1:28:05] journey, through our our experiences in
[1:28:08] this
[1:28:10] race, God is still with
[1:28:13] us. Praise the Lord. And he shall lead
[1:28:17] us to
[1:28:20] accomplish. They search the
[1:28:22] scriptures in every situation they face.
[1:28:27] talk
[1:28:29] about Shadrach.
[1:28:33] They also searched
[1:28:36] scriptures in every experience they
[1:28:38] faced along their
[1:28:41] way in their spiritual race.
[1:28:47] always examine themselves with the
[1:28:51] scriptures and if it was not
[1:28:55] fit, if it was not fit with the
[1:28:59] scripture, they laid aside that
[1:29:02] weight. There is a time, praise the
[1:29:06] Lord, when their way of
[1:29:09] worship, when their way of
[1:29:12] worship was put to a test.
[1:29:17] And then the king, the king loved them
[1:29:20] so much because the Bible says God gave
[1:29:24] them every
[1:29:26] gift that was required to give them a
[1:29:30] favor before the
[1:29:34] king. Time came that their way of
[1:29:38] worship was
[1:29:41] tested. And the king, he made an
[1:29:46] image to be
[1:29:48] worshiped. And all the people celebrated
[1:29:51] the the
[1:29:54] image except
[1:29:59] me. Why? Because when they heard the
[1:30:02] voice of the
[1:30:04] king, the instructions of the
[1:30:08] king, they ran back the scriptures.
[1:30:13] says what the scripture say about
[1:30:17] worship says you shall
[1:30:21] worship only
[1:30:23] one and one
[1:30:25] god and without and and and apart from
[1:30:29] him you shall not worship any
[1:30:33] other then they went back to the
[1:30:36] king and says king let this be known to
[1:30:40] you
[1:30:42] that this which you have
[1:30:47] passed is
[1:30:49] against the
[1:30:51] resources that were given to
[1:30:54] us in our journey in our race. And they
[1:30:59] told him for that
[1:31:02] reason bow
[1:31:04] down to worship that image.
[1:31:08] Praise the Lord. That was
[1:31:11] final regardless of what the priest
[1:31:16] said. Whatever they
[1:31:18] said was
[1:31:20] final because it was the word of
[1:31:24] God. Whatever everyone else was
[1:31:28] doing, whether everybody celebrated
[1:31:32] it, as long
[1:31:35] as it was not it was not in the word,
[1:31:40] They said we shall not do it. And then
[1:31:44] they told
[1:31:45] him we don't
[1:31:47] mind what will happen to us. And then
[1:31:50] the king said, "There is a furnace
[1:31:55] prepared, but seven
[1:31:58] times, whoever shall not
[1:32:01] worship shall not bow down to
[1:32:05] worship shall be cast in there."
[1:32:08] And they said, "We are
[1:32:11] determined for this
[1:32:13] race. We know that he that has called
[1:32:17] us, he who started this
[1:32:20] race, will finish this race. Whether we
[1:32:23] are
[1:32:26] bi that
[1:32:30] authored this race does not come to our
[1:32:36] res. We shall not give
[1:32:39] up. That was the
[1:32:41] determination because they had a
[1:32:45] revelation of the word which they had
[1:32:47] believed.
[1:32:49] There was nothing else that could detach
[1:32:52] them from the
[1:32:55] word, even their
[1:32:58] families. Praise the Lord because the
[1:33:01] Bible
[1:33:02] says, only three men that stood
[1:33:06] up. We don't know what happened to the
[1:33:09] rest of
[1:33:10] them. Maybe the rest of the people gave
[1:33:14] in, but that did not matter to Mr.
[1:33:17] Shadrach and
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:21] Abednego. Praise the Lord. They knew
[1:33:25] him. Whom they had
[1:33:27] believed and they knew that he was
[1:33:31] able. And they said, "Even if he's not
[1:33:35] able, they are determined to follow his
[1:33:39] word, we shall not sell our rights.
[1:33:47] Even if it means our
[1:33:50] life. What a determination for this
[1:33:53] journey. Praise the Lord. They had a
[1:33:57] vision. They were walking by the word.
[1:34:01] examining themselves daily with the
[1:34:05] word, looking away to the spoken
[1:34:09] word, looking away to Jesus
[1:34:12] Christ, the author and finisher of our
[1:34:18] faith. So now even as
[1:34:21] today, whatever will come on the
[1:34:25] table, whether everyone else has
[1:34:28] believed it,
[1:34:31] But if it is not in the
[1:34:34] word, reject it. Run away from
[1:34:39] it. Lay aside that
[1:34:42] wait that may be set
[1:34:45] you run this
[1:34:48] race with
[1:34:50] patience with our
[1:34:53] eyes looking at Jesus
[1:34:55] Christ who is our eternal
[1:34:58] life. Praise the Lord. Look at Jesus
[1:35:01] Christ. Who is our
[1:35:03] victory? Because in this
[1:35:06] race, we are not starting
[1:35:09] it. He's the one who started
[1:35:12] it. Praise the Lord. He already started
[1:35:15] it and he ran it and he took it all
[1:35:19] through the
[1:35:21] cross down the
[1:35:23] grave and then he came back,
[1:35:27] went back to the to the altar.
[1:35:29] went back to the throne and now he got
[1:35:32] the finished
[1:35:33] work. He got the finished
[1:35:36] work. Praise the Lord. I came and placed
[1:35:39] it before
[1:35:41] us. And then he says, "Whoever wills
[1:35:45] come and when you come, walk in this
[1:35:49] fish work of Calvary." So you are not
[1:35:52] fighting as one that beats the air, but
[1:35:56] you're
[1:35:57] fighting knowing what you are fighting
[1:36:00] for that it is a finished
[1:36:03] work. Praise the Lord. Run the
[1:36:07] race with
[1:36:09] patience. Praise the Lord. Let me read
[1:36:12] this
[1:36:14] prayer. How can I overcome?
[1:36:17] We see our Lord,
[1:36:20] what he did and realize that the Old
[1:36:23] Testament
[1:36:29] saints, we found, we find out that what
[1:36:32] they
[1:36:33] did when Jesus
[1:36:35] raised, they went with
[1:36:38] him. And
[1:36:40] Lord, we believe that we will go when he
[1:36:44] sounds the trumpet.
[1:36:48] We believe
[1:36:50] it and
[1:36:52] together and the bride will go forth at
[1:36:54] the
[1:36:56] day the bride will go forth at that
[1:37:00] day and will join with the Hebrew group
[1:37:03] of
[1:37:06] it and together there will be a wedding
[1:37:09] supper in
[1:37:12] glory. We pray now for your mercy and
[1:37:15] grace upon
[1:37:19] us. Overcomers,
[1:37:23] Lord, overcome as we long to
[1:37:26] be. Lord Jesus, you overcome the
[1:37:30] world. Now I pray that you let every
[1:37:34] person here,
[1:37:38] lay every sin aside,
[1:37:42] lay aside the weight that does so easily
[1:37:44] beset
[1:37:47] us that we might run with patience the
[1:37:50] rest that is set before us.
[1:37:56] Paul spoke to
[1:37:57] us. Our heavenly
[1:38:00] father over there in the book of the
[1:38:04] Hebrews that we should lay aside every
[1:38:09] weight that he spoke this after he would
[1:38:12] already showed by
[1:38:17] example those who did go
[1:38:19] on. Those who did go
[1:38:22] on, those who did not go
[1:38:25] on, those who lukewarmly
[1:38:29] followed, those who lukewarmly
[1:38:35] followed, those who followed up in the
[1:38:39] front, those who lingered
[1:38:43] behind. He showed the examples.
[1:38:47] He then turned and
[1:38:49] said, "Let us lay aside every
[1:38:54] weight, every little tiny thing that
[1:38:57] besets
[1:38:59] us, that we might run with patience the
[1:39:03] rest that is set before
[1:39:06] us, looking to him, the author and
[1:39:09] finish of our
[1:39:13] faith, who gave us the example.
[1:39:18] We do that this morning,
[1:39:21] Father. That's what the prophet says. He
[1:39:24] was making a
[1:39:25] prayer that each one of us can have the
[1:39:29] capacity to lay aside every
[1:39:33] weight. And when it gets
[1:39:37] heavy, we pray that the Lord keeps us
[1:39:41] true. When you feel you're
[1:39:45] failing, pray and say, "Keep me true,
[1:39:47] Lord. Keep me
[1:39:50] true." Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[1:39:54] true. There is a
[1:39:56] race. I know I must
[1:39:58] run. And there are victories for me to
[1:40:02] win. Give me power every hour to be
[1:40:06] true. Gain far more strength to run.
[1:40:13] And again, when you get
[1:40:15] weak, you ask the Lord to lift you
[1:40:18] up. And like the writer says,
[1:40:22] Lord, lift me
[1:40:23] up and let me
[1:40:25] stand by faith on heaven's table
[1:40:30] lander plane than I have
[1:40:37] found. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:40:39] ground.
[1:40:42] running the race with
[1:40:47] patience. Let us run with
[1:40:51] patience. May the Lord bless
[1:40:53] you. Amen. Let's get on our
[1:40:56] feet. Amen. Amen. Lord, lift me
[1:41:00] up. Let me
[1:41:03] stand when I am weak. Lord, lift me
[1:41:07] up. And let me stand.
[1:41:11] Amen. Amen. Let's sing that
[1:41:14] song as the brother will lead us to
[1:41:16] worship.
[1:41:19] Amen.
[1:41:21] Lord, lift me
[1:41:25] up and let me
[1:41:29] stand by faithful.
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:39] Oh, a
[1:41:42] higher
[1:41:44] plane than I have
[1:41:49] found. Lord, plant my
[1:41:53] feet on
[1:41:59] higher ground. We are pressing on. I'm
[1:42:04] pressing
[1:42:07] on the upward

[1:42:29] praying I'm on
[1:42:34] ground. Lord, plant my
[1:42:39] feet on
[1:42:46] higher. My heart has no desire. My heart
[1:42:51] has
[1:42:54] no
[1:42:56] desire to stay.

[1:43:15] dwell where these are. Our prayer

[1:45:59] Jesus, we thank you father.
[1:46:03] We thank you Lord God for the privilege
[1:46:05] Lord you've given us Lord God to have
[1:46:08] that mind Lord that Lord Jesus you
[1:46:12] started a good work and we know Father
[1:46:14] you will bring it unto accomplishment
[1:46:17] Lord as the prophet says you didn't
[1:46:19] bring those children of Israel to
[1:46:22] destroy them in the wilderness but your
[1:46:24] purpose Lord was to cross them the land
[1:46:28] into the promises of God Lord we pray
[1:46:31] father there is a promise of God. The
[1:46:34] promise is the word of God. Lord Jesus,
[1:46:36] as your word has been restored, as your
[1:46:39] word has been proven, Lord, as this
[1:46:41] ministry, Lord God, has been father,
[1:46:44] vindicated, Lord, by your presence,
[1:46:46] Lord, as your word, Father, has been
[1:46:49] vindicated, Lord Jesus, by the very life
[1:46:51] of Jesus Christ, the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:54] Ghost, Lord, we depend upon you, Lord
[1:46:56] Jesus. We have no other way, Lord. We
[1:46:58] have no other word Lord Jesus. But on
[1:47:01] Christ the Lord Lord we stand. Oh my
[1:47:03] Jesus Christ take us farther into the
[1:47:07] promises of God that we may possess Lord
[1:47:10] what th says the Lord is Lord. We pray
[1:47:12] Lord Jesus Christ not by might Lord nor
[1:47:16] by power Father not what we are able to
[1:47:18] do Lord. Not by resolutions Lord Jesus
[1:47:21] but we depend on the finished work of
[1:47:23] Calvary Lord. Oh my Jesus. That's why
[1:47:26] Lord God, we are so thankful father for
[1:47:29] the blood of Jesus Christ. We are so

[1:47:46] Lord which was wrought on Calvary Lord.

[1:47:50] afflicting. Lord, mercies are coming for
[1:47:54] us. Lord, we pray. Lord Jesus, as we
[1:47:57] obtain mercies that we may use them in
[1:48:00] times of need, in the time where we are
[1:48:02] going to need them, Lord, we pray, Lord
[1:48:05] Jesus, may you bring us holy father into
[1:48:08] the word of God. May we soak in Lord.
[1:48:11] May we be part of the word that we may
[1:48:14] say like Jesus Christ. We do. We don't
[1:48:17] do what father we cannot do what God has
[1:48:20] not showed us. But whatever we do,
[1:48:22] whatever life we live, we do what the
[1:48:25] Lord has said. We do what father what we
[1:48:28] see the Lord Jesus do. Lord God and Paul
[1:48:32] says whether we sing songs whether we do
[1:48:35] father what words works or deed we have
[1:48:38] to do it according to the word of God.
[1:48:40] We pray Lord Jesus we thank you for the
[1:48:42] restoration of your word. We thank you
[1:48:44] Lord Jesus for the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:46] Spirit and we pray Lord for the fight
[1:48:48] for ministry Lord. May you give them
[1:48:50] more light Lord, more grace Lord, more
[1:48:53] understanding Father when they are in
[1:48:55] the meditations Lord in the preparation
[1:48:58] Lord to come and deliver the message to
[1:49:00] your children to the purchase of the
[1:49:02] blood. We thank you Lord your children
[1:49:04] are ever blessed Lord when the preacher
[1:49:06] comes Lord to minister grace unto the
