[7:40] Lord and bless us all together in the
[7:44] name of the Lord Jesus
[7:46] us amen amen so we go to Hebrews chapter
[7:52] 4 we're reading from verse 4 to verse
[7:57] 11 we want to talk about the Sabbath of
[8:00] the Holy
[8:03] Spirit the
[8:04] Sabbath or the Sabbath is the holy
[8:09] spirit praise the name of our
[8:12] Lord so the scripture
[8:15] says for he spoke in a certain place of
[8:18] the seventh day on this
[8:20] wise Hebrews 4:4
[8:32] and God did rest the seventh day from
[8:34] all his
[8:39] works and in this place again if they
[8:42] shall enter into my
[8:50] rest seeing therefore it remain that
[8:54] some must enter therein and they to whom
[8:57] it was preached entered not in because
[8:59] of
[9:19] unbelief and again he limit a certain
[9:22] day saying inid today that after so long
[9:26] a time as it is say today if if you hear
[9:30] his voice Harden not your
[9:54] heart for if Jesus had given them rest
[9:58] then would he not afterward have spoken
[10:01] of another
[10:15] day rest to the people of
[10:22] God for that is entered into the rest he
[10:25] also has ceed from his own works as God
[10:28] did from his
[10:40] let us labor therefore to enter into
[10:43] that TR lest any man fall after this
[10:47] example of unbelief
[10:59] you may be
[11:01] seated we want to talk about the Sabbath
[11:03] of the Holy
[11:07] Spirit praise the name of our
[11:09] Lord so here he's talking
[11:13] about God giving them a Sabbath in the
[11:16] Old
[11:21] Testament but the sabath in the Old
[11:26] Testament was the seventh day
[11:32] but then they would enter the seventh
[11:35] day and then come out of the sth
[11:38] day but then saying that if that was the
[11:41] rest he had talked
[11:46] about he would not have talked of
[11:48] another
[11:50] day but then this day talking
[11:54] about is a Sabbath that is eternal
[12:00] a Sabbath that you enter by
[12:04] faith because they were already
[12:06] observing The
[12:10] Saturdays they never entered into his
[12:15] rest because of
[12:17] unbelief praise the name of our Lord now
[12:21] in the message Hebrews chapter
[12:23] [Music]
[12:24] 5 he says the Sabbath is the rest
[12:32] that we enter
[12:34] into not by
[12:37] day not by
[12:41] law but entering into
[12:45] Christ which is our
[12:48] Sabbath he is our
[12:51] Sabbath we run it all through the Old
[12:55] Testament about the seventh day
[12:59] and God did rest the seventh
[13:03] day give it to the children of Israel in
[13:06] the
[13:09] wilderness and again he limited a
[13:12] day what was it a certain day in the
[13:19] week the day when you hear his
[13:24] voice don't Harden your heart
[13:29] that's the day he's entering
[13:33] in to give you an eternal
[13:38] pece an eternal
[13:42] Sabbath praise the name of Lord says you
[13:45] don't go to church on
[13:49] Sunday to become
[13:51] religious then when you are born of the
[13:55] spirit of
[13:57] God you enter into to the rest
[14:02] forever no morebath
[14:06] keeping you are in the
[14:09] Sabbath
[14:11] continually
[14:13] Forever and For
[14:17] Eternity your worldly Works has
[14:23] finished says the
[14:25] Bible and you've entered into the
[14:28] blessed
[14:36] praise the name of so now
[14:39] Sabbath is rest but then the rest begins
[14:44] in with the rest the the rest is
[14:46] instituted when God rested on the
[14:48] seventh
[14:50] [Music]
[14:55] day when we read in Genesis chapter 2
[15:01] and then we see where God starts talking
[15:03] about
[15:06] rest in verse one Genesis
[15:11] 2 thus the heavens and the Earth were
[15:19] finished and all the host of
[15:22] them and on the seventh
[15:25] day God all his work which he had
[15:31] made praise the name of the Lord so God
[15:35] took six days creating the heavens and
[15:37] the Earth
[15:41] rather and then now on the seventh day
[15:45] the Bible says he
[15:48] rested now when God rested on the
[15:50] seventh
[15:52] day he didn't go back and start creating
[15:57] again so you see that the seventh day
[16:00] which was given to the children of
[16:04] Israel was just a
[16:07] shadow of the reality of God is
[16:14] rest praise the name of our Lord because
[16:16] they would enter into this sabbath
[16:19] day and then they would go out of
[16:23] it but then the rest of
[16:26] God was eternal
[16:29] when he stopped
[16:31] creation he had seed from all his
[16:35] works so now for us to get the true
[16:39] Sabbath praise the name of our Lord an
[16:43] eternal
[16:45] rest it's not entering into a
[16:48] day and then you come out of the
[16:51] day so now the Bible says in verse
[16:55] three and God blessed the seventh day
[17:00] and Sanctified it because that in it he
[17:03] had rested from all his
[17:09] work the Bible says he had rested from
[17:12] all his
[17:16] work so he didn't go back on the first
[17:19] day
[17:20] again start
[17:23] creating like the the Sabbath day
[17:26] keepers
[17:29] the keepers of theb
[17:35] day you know they on
[17:40] Friday then on Saturday they get
[17:44] into and you know when you look at the
[17:46] principle of the Sabbath keep keeping in
[17:48] the Old
[17:51] Testament they were not even allowed to
[17:54] pick any firewood
[18:03] there are people they found picking
[18:06] firewood there people they found picking
[18:10] firewood they killed
[18:13] them so we can ask the peepers of the
[18:16] seventh
[18:19] day don't they also pick
[18:24] firewood praise the name of our Lord so
[18:27] you see that that was just a
[18:32] shadow and even when the Lord Jesus
[18:34] Christ
[18:35] came he would he on the
[18:39] Sabbath the disciples go in the garden
[18:42] on the
[18:45] Sabbath Jesus would tell them that the
[18:48] son of man is the Lord of
[18:53] Sabbath praise the name of our Lord so
[18:56] the day of Sabbath
[18:59] which was the seventh day in the Old
[19:04] Testament just a
[19:07] shadow showing the rest that would get
[19:10] in
[19:13] God by receiving the baptism of the holy
[19:18] spirit so now when we receive the Holy
[19:21] Spirit then you have received the
[19:23] Sabbath of
[19:26] God actually that's what the scripture
[19:28] says
[19:30] when we go to 11se
[19:36] 2 praise the name of our
[19:38] Lord MTH
[19:43] 11:28 so the scripture
[19:45] says come unto me all ye that labor and
[19:49] are Heaven Len and I will give you rest
[19:59] so we see that Christ is inviting
[20:02] us that we can come to
[20:05] him that we receive that
[20:09] rest then he says take my yoke upon
[20:16] you and learn of
[20:19] me for I am me and
[20:24] LLY in heart and you shall find rest for
[20:29] your
[20:31] souls so then you go to
[20:34] Christ you take your B to
[20:38] Christ and then he said bring your
[20:42] yoke learn of
[20:44] me because I am me and L in
[20:49] heart and then you shall find rest for
[20:52] your
[20:54] soul so now the rest is talking about
[20:59] is the
[21:00] Sabbath it's not the keeping of
[21:03] day but it is you to come to Christ with
[21:08] yourens you come to Christ with all the
[21:11] trou that you
[21:14] have and then you bring every trouble
[21:17] you bring it to
[21:19] Christ and now when you bring your
[21:21] burdens to
[21:23] Christ then Christ gives you his own
[21:27] rest
[21:29] praise the name of our Lord that is the
[21:32] true
[21:34] Sabbath Sabbath is not the keeping of
[21:36] the
[21:38] day Sabbath is the Life of Christ in
[21:44] you that we receive by receiving his
[21:47] holy
[21:50] spirit praise the name of the Lord
[21:53] that's the Sabbath is talking about
[21:56] here and then it says in verse
[22:00] 30 for my yoke is
[22:03] easy and my burden is
[22:07] light praise the name of Lord so that's
[22:11] the we are all
[22:13] invited that we can come and get the
[22:16] rest from
[22:19] God we can get the rest that Jesus
[22:22] Christ
[22:24] gives praise the name of our Lord now in
[22:27] the
[22:36] Vision let us see what the Bible teaches
[22:39] us about the
[22:43] Sabbath for he that is entered into his
[22:49] rest praise the name of the
[22:53] Lord is quoting the
[22:56] scriptures which we read in HEB Hebrews
[22:58] chapter
[23:01] 4 praise the name of our Lord that if we
[23:05] enter his
[23:08] rest that is the rest of
[23:12] God we also sees from our own
[23:18] works let us go back and put an emphas
[23:20] on Hebrews chapter 4
[23:25] first Hebrews 4:9 and vers
[23:30] 10 he says for there remain therefore a
[23:34] rest to the people of
[23:39] God Hebrews
[23:51] 4:9 is entered into his rest
[23:59] rest God's Own
[24:03] rest it says when we enter into the rest
[24:06] of
[24:08] God we also seize we stop our own
[24:14] works we stop our own
[24:19] living but now it is Christ that liveth
[24:23] in
[24:25] Us Praise the name of our Lord taken
[24:28] over
[24:30] us we have entered into his
[24:34] rest we are New
[24:37] Creations so it is the rest of
[24:40] God that we
[24:43] receive when we receive the spirit of
[24:46] God let us go back to Theos
[24:51] Vision he says this entering in is not
[24:55] entering in
[25:01] this entering
[25:03] in is not only entering
[25:07] in but remaining
[25:12] in the rest is an eternal
[25:17] rest of which the seventh
[25:23] day is just but a type
[25:29] seven is
[25:35] completion is the first day
[25:39] again
[25:41] Jesus resurrection was in the first day
[25:43] of the
[25:46] week giving us eternal life and eternal
[25:50] Sabbath
[25:53] rest thus we see why God could not give
[25:56] us any one certain day of the
[26:03] week as a Sabbath or
[26:07] rest we've entered
[26:10] into and do
[26:13] remain in our
[26:15] rest which Israel could not
[26:20] do he said in M 11 verse
[26:25] 28 come unto me all ye that
[26:31] and are
[26:33] heav and I will give you
[26:36] rest take my
[26:39] yoke and learn of
[26:42] me and you shall find
[26:45] rest or the keeping of the
[26:50] Sabbath not a day but eternal
[26:55] life
[26:57] Sabbath your soul no matter how long
[27:00] you've been laboring under your load of
[27:07] sin whether in 10
[27:10] years years or years or
[27:16] longer come with your tired
[27:20] life and you find his
[27:24] rest the true Sabbath
[27:28] Jesus will give you
[27:31] rest praise the name of our Lord so it
[27:34] is Christ that gives us the
[27:37] Sabbath by filling us with the Holy
[27:42] Spirit then we get the Sabbath of
[27:47] God praise the name of our lord it's not
[27:50] the keeping of the
[27:52] day praise the name of our Lord the
[27:54] keeping of the day was in the Old
[27:56] Testament
[27:59] but in the New
[28:01] Testament it is now in
[28:04] Christ praise the name of the Lord like
[28:07] our friends like the seventh
[28:11] day our friends like keeping the seventh
[28:17] day why don't Slaughter
[28:21] animals because they are still wanting
[28:24] Shadows why didn't they get animals to
[28:26] their churches
[28:31] when the Bible tells
[28:33] us that the law had the shadow of good
[28:36] things to
[28:40] come in Hebrews 10 verse
[28:45] one for the law having a shadow of good
[28:48] things to come and not the very image of
[28:51] the things can never with those
[28:53] sacrifices which they offered year by
[28:56] continually make the comers there are un
[28:59] perfect
[29:36] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[29:38] they would
[29:40] not the Shadows would not make the
[29:43] worshippers
[29:47] perfect and then we see that all the
[29:49] shadows in the Old
[29:52] Testament they were all pointing us to
[29:55] Christ
[29:58] the shadows in the Old
[30:00] Testament they were all pointing us to
[30:02] one perfect
[30:06] sacrifice all the Fists in the whole
[30:10] scriptures they were all pointing us to
[30:13] Christ talking about the life of Jesus
[30:19] Christ the peace
[30:22] offering you know the trespass offerings
[30:28] all the
[30:34] offerings whe they were you know
[30:37] goats or they were
[30:42] lamps
[30:44] bus they were
[30:48] pigeons you know all of them were
[30:50] appointing us to
[30:53] Christ so even all the types and shadows
[30:59] they were all pointing us to
[31:01] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
[31:04] the keeping of the saath
[31:07] day was pointing us to the true
[31:13] rest
[31:16] come praise the name of the Lord when we
[31:19] go to the book of Isaiah chapter
[31:23] 28 Isaiah talks about how this rest is
[31:27] going to be fulfill
[31:31] F Isaiah 2
[31:36] verse the scripture
[31:40] says for all tables are full of vomit
[31:44] and fness so that there is no place
[31:54] clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge and
[31:57] whom Whom Shall he make to understand
[31:59] Doctrine them that are wi from milk and
[32:02] drawn from the
[32:21] breast for precept must be upon precept
[32:24] precept upon precept line upon line line
[32:28] upon line here a little and there a
[32:44] little for stammering lips and another
[32:47] tongue will he speak to this people
[32:55] [Music]
[33:04] to whom he said this is the rest
[33:08] wherewith you may cause the we to rest
[33:11] and this is the refreshing yet they
[33:14] would not hear
[33:36] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[33:38] this is the
[33:40] rest this is the
[33:43] Sabbath how did it come it came on the
[33:48] day of
[33:50] Pentecost by the baptism of the holy
[33:53] spirit because the prophet was showing
[33:56] them how the Holy Ghost would come
[33:59] down and with stammering lips and
[34:02] another
[34:05] tongue he will speak to these
[34:08] people he said this is the
[34:12] rest now in Theos
[34:16] Vision he says here it is prophesied
[34:18] right here in
[34:24] Isaiah it came to pass about 7
[34:28] years later at
[34:33] Pentecost when they were all filled with
[34:36] the Holy
[34:38] Ghost exactly as it was said they would
[34:44] be this is the true
[34:47] Sabbath that was
[34:50] promised th when they were filled with
[34:52] the Holy
[34:55] Ghost They Se from their worldly
[35:01] Works they worldly
[35:04] doings they evil
[35:08] ways the Holy Ghost took charge over
[35:12] their
[35:15] lives they entered into the
[35:18] rest there is your
[35:21] rest that is your
[35:24] Sabbath it's not a day not
[35:29] but the eternity of being
[35:34] filled and blessed in the Holy
[35:38] Spirit it is you
[35:41] seing and God
[35:45] doing it is God in you
[35:50] doing his good
[35:53] pleasure praise the name of our Lord so
[35:56] the Sabbath true
[35:59] Sabbath is the baptism of the Holy
[36:02] Spirit praise the name of the Lord you
[36:05] see when you look when you for example
[36:07] the holy
[36:09] spirit means everything to
[36:15] us praise the name of the Lord because
[36:18] the Holy Ghost has different kind of you
[36:21] know references we can give to
[36:28] he says speak unto the children of
[36:29] Israel and say unto them when you come
[36:32] into the land which I give you then
[36:35] shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the
[36:38] Lord
[36:50] [Music]
[37:07] six years you shall s your field and six
[37:10] years you shall prone your vineard and
[37:13] gather in the fruit there
[37:36] but in the seventh year shall be a
[37:39] Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath
[37:42] for the Lord thou sh neither s thy field
[37:47] nor your vineard
[38:10] praise the name of the Lord so you see
[38:12] now again he brings that the land must
[38:14] also have a
[38:19] Sabbath and says the six
[38:22] years you
[38:25] plant you use your land
[38:28] but then in the seventh
[38:30] year you let your land
[38:34] rest to have a
[38:37] Sabbath and now as you continue
[38:40] reading then he told them about having
[38:43] seven sabbaths of the
[38:49] land and that means that seven
[38:55] cycles of seven years
[38:59] and now that makes it 49
[39:02] years and then he says now the
[39:07] 50th shall be Ailee unto
[39:13] you praise the name of the Lord so when
[39:16] we read in verse
[39:20] 8 and you shall number seven thases of
[39:23] years unto thee seven time seven years
[39:27] and space of the seven sabbaths of years
[39:30] shall be unto thee 40 and9
[39:52] years and then in verse
[39:54] 10 and you shall H the 50th year and
[39:58] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[40:00] and to all the inhabitants thereof and
[40:03] it shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[40:05] shall return every man unto his
[40:08] possession and you shall return every
[40:10] man unto his family
[40:44] for it is the Jubilee verse 12 it shall
[40:47] be holy unto you you shall eat the
[40:49] increase thereof out of the field
[41:06] in the year of this Jubilee you shall
[41:10] return every man unto his
[41:19] possession praise the name of our Lord
[41:22] so you see how the Lord comes forth
[41:25] and gives the shadows in the Old
[41:33] Testament and now as they working as the
[41:36] Shadows are being
[41:40] kept then he comes and
[41:44] prophesies about the Fulfillment of
[41:47] these
[41:49] Shadows like he gave them the Sabbath
[41:53] day in Isaiah comes and points to us
[41:58] that the true
[41:59] rest is when they are receiving the
[42:01] baptism of the Holy
[42:03] Spirit and now he is talking about the
[42:05] land having seven
[42:09] sabbaths and then he declares the of
[42:14] Jubilee
[42:16] theth then Isaiah picks that
[42:19] up and then brings its real meaning and
[42:23] fulfillment
[42:27] and then he gives a
[42:29] prophecy of how the Year of
[42:33] Jubilee is going to be fulfilled in its
[42:38] reality so now in Isaiah
[42:43] 61 and then in verse
[42:46] one the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[42:50] because the Lord has anointed me to
[42:52] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[42:55] sent me to bind up the BR brokenhearted
[42:58] to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[43:01] the opening of the prison to them that
[43:03] abound
[43:25] [Music]
[43:35] verse two to proclaim the acceptable
[43:38] year of the
[43:50] Lord praise the name of the Lord Isaiah
[43:53] is speaking from the Shadows
[43:57] is turning it around and saying there is
[43:59] a time this is going to be
[44:04] fulfilled God has anointed me with his
[44:08] Spirit to preach Good
[44:12] Tidings he has sent me to bind up the
[44:17] Brokenhearted and to declare
[44:21] Liberty now he's taking them from the
[44:24] 50th Year of Jubilee
[44:29] declaring them that a time is
[44:34] coming where the gospel is going to
[44:36] declare
[44:39] Liberty to the
[44:41] captives and soever wants to be
[44:46] free will be made free praise the name
[44:50] of our Lord so we see that the Old
[44:53] Testament there were
[44:56] Shadows and within the Old
[45:00] Testament God would send the
[45:03] prophets and then the prophets would
[45:05] come and show us the Fulfillment of
[45:08] these
[45:12] Shadows praise the name of our Lord let
[45:15] us hold that there for the time
[45:17] being we go to Isaiah chapter
[45:23] 53 praise the name of our Lord
[45:27] so the Bible says in Isaiah chter
[45:31] 53 and then we can start reading from
[45:36] verse
[45:41] six okay let us start from
[45:44] verse
[45:47] four surely has borne our griefs and
[45:51] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[45:53] stricken and smitten of God and
[45:56] afflicted
[46:14] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[46:17] was bruised for our iniquities the
[46:19] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[46:21] and with his stripes we were healed
[46:40] all we like ship had gone astray we have
[46:44] turned everyone to his own way and the
[46:46] Lord laid on him all the iniquity of US
[46:50] own
[47:08] praise the name of the Lord he said he
[47:10] laid on him all our
[47:16] iniquity praise the name of the Lord
[47:20] just again shows us back the atonment
[47:25] day now on the day of
[47:29] atonment in lus
[47:33] 16 the
[47:36] priest the high
[47:42] priest high
[47:44] priest he had to cast lots over a
[47:51] goat one go where he would let the sins
[47:55] of the people
[47:58] and then another go which he had to
[48:04] sacrifice praise the name of the Lord in
[48:07] lus
[48:09] 6 and then verse
[48:15] 9 and and Aaron shall bring the goat
[48:18] upon the Lord's Lot F and offer him for
[48:22] a sin
[48:25] offering the
[48:47] 16:9 and Aaron shall and the Goat on
[48:50] which the Lord fell to the scap goat
[48:53] shall be presented alive before the Lord
[48:56] to make an atonement with him and let
[48:59] him go for escap goat Into the
[49:01] Wilderness
[49:22] [Music]
[49:36] praise the name of the Lord so then
[49:38] Aaron would go and offer the blood on
[49:40] the Mery
[49:44] seat he could sacrifice the bull for his
[49:47] sins and his
[49:51] family and then the other God sacrifices
[49:54] it for the sins of the people
[49:59] sprink on the
[50:03] SE and then the Bible says after he has
[50:07] made you
[50:08] know after he has made
[50:13] reconciliation of the Holy
[50:15] place and the
[50:18] Tabernacle and the
[50:20] altar that's verse 20
[50:22] now he shall bring the life go
[50:29] then in verse
[50:30] 21 and Alon shall lay both his hands
[50:34] upon the head of
[50:42] the and confess over him all the
[50:45] iniquities of the children of
[50:50] Israel and all their transgressions
[50:58] in all their
[51:00] sins putting them upon the head of the
[51:05] go and shall send him away by the hand
[51:08] of a fit man Into the
[51:15] Wilderness and the God shall bear upon
[51:17] him all the
[51:25] iniquities land
[51:55] inhabited
[52:25] e
[52:55] e
[53:25] e
[53:55] e
[54:25] e
[54:55] e e
[55:44] to preach the acceptable year of the
[55:52] Lord and he closed the book and gave it
[55:55] again to the minister and sat down and
[55:58] the eyes of them that were in the
[56:01] synagogue were fasting on
[56:15] him and he began to say unto them this
[56:18] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[56:21] eyes
[56:30] praise the name of Lord so all these
[56:34] Shadows they were all fulfilled in
[56:38] Christ in the Old
[56:41] Testament they had of Jubilee after
[56:43] every 50
[56:47] years but it was a shadow depicting the
[56:51] salvation of Christ
[56:56] for them they had it once in 50
[57:00] years but to us praise the name of our
[57:04] Lord the Gospel of Jesus
[57:07] Christ that any person who is
[57:11] bound can go free any
[57:14] time you don't wait for 50 years now but
[57:18] the moment you hear the gospel of your
[57:22] salvation then you receive your Liberty
[57:27] you receive your
[57:28] Jubilee and the same
[57:31] gospel that declares Jubilee to
[57:35] us is the same
[57:37] gospel where we receive the Sabbath of
[57:40] our
[57:43] rest praise the name of our Lord so
[57:46] everything is fulfilled in
[57:50] Christ no wonder the Bible
[57:53] says that nobody should judge you
[58:03] youi let no man therefore judge you in
[58:07] meat or in drink or in respect of a
[58:10] holiday or of the new moon or of the
[58:13] Sabbath days Colossians 2: 16
[58:33] [Music]
[58:36] he says let no man judge you
[58:41] now what you
[58:43] eat some say we don't eat meat on
[58:48] Friday judge on
[58:52] that or you drinking
[58:56] or in respect of a holid
[59:00] day this day is more than this
[59:03] day say nobody should judge you
[59:07] about or keeping of the new
[59:10] moon or the Sabbath
[59:14] days and then in verse 17 the Bible
[59:19] says which are a shadow of the things to
[59:22] come
[59:27] but the body is of
[59:30] Christ praise the name of the Lord he
[59:32] says there a
[59:34] shadow so they are all fulfilled in
[59:39] Christ praise the name of our Lord and
[59:41] the Bible says there is now no
[59:46] condemnation for those who are in
[59:49] Christ praise the name of our Lord when
[59:52] you are in
[59:53] Christ you fulfilled all the law
[59:57] praise the name of the Lord why because
[1:00:01] Christ is the Fulfillment of the law and
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:07] prophets so now when I'm in
[1:00:10] Christ I fulfill all those kind of
[1:00:13] things I fulfill the law of Moses I
[1:00:17] fulfill the
[1:00:18] prophets because they were a shadow of
[1:00:23] Christ they were pointing us to Christ
[1:00:27] now the reality has
[1:00:29] come why should I live in the
[1:00:33] shadows the name of our Lord Christ is
[1:00:36] the Fulfillment of the law and the
[1:00:40] prophets so when I'm in
[1:00:43] Christ I fulfill all the law of
[1:00:49] Moses so people should not trouble
[1:00:52] you why don't you go to church on
[1:00:59] Saturday not judge you and then the
[1:01:02] issue is why do we come to church on
[1:01:08] Sunday in the ear
[1:01:13] churches they were actually assembling
[1:01:15] on the first day of the
[1:01:20] week and it's on the first day of the
[1:01:23] week
[1:01:26] that our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:30] resurrected praise the name of our Lord
[1:01:32] this names that M Tuesday Wednesday
[1:01:35] Saturday Sunday they came later
[1:01:39] ones
[1:01:44] Sunday but we had the first day of the
[1:01:47] week second day Third Day fourth day up
[1:01:49] to theth
[1:01:54] day but our Lord Jesus
[1:01:57] Christ resurrected on the first day of
[1:02:00] the
[1:02:03] week so now the disciples did that as a
[1:02:11] commemoration you know worshiping on the
[1:02:14] first day of the
[1:02:18] week because of the resurrection of
[1:02:20] Jesus
[1:02:22] Christ so it's not a day that was
[1:02:24] started by a certain
[1:02:29] praise the name of the Lord in verse
[1:02:36] 7 the bible says and upon the first day
[1:02:40] of the week when the disciples came
[1:02:43] together to break bread Paul preached
[1:02:46] unto them ready to depart on the
[1:02:48] tomorrow and conted his speech until
[1:02:51] midnight
[1:03:16] so they were
[1:03:18] gathering on the first day of the
[1:03:21] week and now the people are gathering on
[1:03:24] the first day of the week in the old in
[1:03:26] the in the Bible
[1:03:31] times during times of the Apostles in
[1:03:34] the book of
[1:03:38] Acts they recognize the resurrection of
[1:03:41] Jesus
[1:03:43] Christ but now those who are still
[1:03:45] living in the
[1:03:47] law for those who are still living the
[1:03:52] law they were now on the Sabbath day
[1:03:56] so somebody distinct know this one is
[1:03:59] still in his
[1:04:02] Sabbath that this one doesn't believe
[1:04:04] the Lord Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ but then those who believed the
[1:04:08] Lord Jesus
[1:04:10] Christ they were gaed on the of the
[1:04:15] week in First Corinthians
[1:04:21] verse the scripture says upon the first
[1:04:24] day of the week let let every one of you
[1:04:26] led by him in store as God has prospered
[1:04:30] him that there be no Gatherings when I
[1:04:50] come why is he talking about the first
[1:04:53] day of the week
[1:04:55] people were gathering
[1:04:58] together so he was tell them you can lay
[1:05:00] in store the things you want to give
[1:05:05] out praise the name of the Lord so
[1:05:08] nobody should judge
[1:05:11] us by the day we
[1:05:14] worship it is a
[1:05:16] shadow and then also on the first day of
[1:05:19] the
[1:05:21] week because the scripture
[1:05:23] says when the day of Pentecost had fully
[1:05:29] come and the day of
[1:05:32] Pentecost let us go to Leviticus chapter
[1:05:37] 24 praise the name of our
[1:05:40] Lord Leviticus chapter 24 and we pick
[1:05:43] Pentecost from
[1:05:51] there okay excuse me lus chapter 23
[1:05:57] and then verse
[1:06:01] 15 and he
[1:06:04] says and you shall count unto you from
[1:06:07] the Tom after the Sabbath from the day
[1:06:10] that you brought the thief of w offering
[1:06:13] seven sabbaths shall be complete
[1:06:40] even the morrow after the seventh
[1:06:43] Sabbath shall you number 50 days and you
[1:06:46] shall offer a meat offering unto the
[1:06:49] Lord
[1:07:04] now in in
[1:07:07] verse in verse
[1:07:10] 21 and you shall Proclaim on the self
[1:07:13] same day that it may be a holy
[1:07:15] convocation unto you and you shall do no
[1:07:18] sural work therein it shall be a statute
[1:07:21] forever in all your dwellings throughout
[1:07:23] the day of Pentecost
[1:07:27] they had the Feast of
[1:07:29] Pentecost and then in the New
[1:07:33] Testament in 2
[1:07:37] verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:07:40] fully
[1:07:44] come they were all with one Accord in
[1:07:47] one place
[1:07:57] and they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:59] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:08:01] the spirit gave them utterance
[1:08:18] that's praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:08:21] see that the Holy Spirit
[1:08:25] fell on the day of
[1:08:29] Pentecost which was the first day of the
[1:08:34] week it was the day the Church of Jesus
[1:08:38] Christ was
[1:08:42] born that's why we keep sus to worship
[1:08:45] on the day like
[1:08:49] that the day our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:53] resurrected and the the church was
[1:08:57] born the first day of the
[1:09:00] week praise the name of the Lord so
[1:09:03] don't allow somebody to confuse
[1:09:06] you you don't keep the
[1:09:09] Sabbath tell them I have the
[1:09:13] Sabbath praise the name of the Lord I
[1:09:15] don't enter
[1:09:17] in and come out but I have the
[1:09:21] Sabbath and that's the rest the Lord
[1:09:23] Jesus Christ gives to us
[1:09:26] by the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:29] Spirit praise the name of our Lord so we
[1:09:32] see all these are
[1:09:36] fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:09:39] when we have Christ in us we fulfill all
[1:09:43] the
[1:09:44] law when we have Christ in us we fulfill
[1:09:48] all the
[1:09:51] law praise the name of the Lord when we
[1:09:54] have Christ in US
[1:09:56] we fulfill all the
