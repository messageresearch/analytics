not here that Lord you may in their and bless us together amen amen I you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord I want us the book of read verse one praise the name of our Lord so the scripture says let not your heart be TR in so I want to take some time this evening not TR praise the name Lord not trou praise the name of Lord and you know when the Lord Jesus Christ was going away he was telling his disciples that in the world is full of Sorrows a lot of TR of things that disturb us but yet he told us be of good cheer I have overcome praise the name of the Lord so we shouldn't be scared by any trouble that we come through we shouldn't be Tred by any kind of situation that we go through praise the name of the Lord telling his disciples let not your heart be troubled the name Lord believe in me believe also in God so now when you have faith in God you will not be scared by anything praise the name of the Lord your heart will be confident your heart will be hopeful that in whatever condition that you are going through you know that the Lord will help me come through it praise the name of the Lord let us go to Isaiah 43 and then we read from verse 1 verse he says but now thus says the Lord that created thee formed the Israel fear not not praise the name of our Lord the message we have fear not don't be afraid and then brother preaches a message Shalom good new day and you know whenever a new day comes in it should always bring hope you know whatever you fail to do yesterday is another opportun to do it today is another time and then Jeremiah tells us that thees of God a new every morning so you don't allow Satan to bring the sorrow of yesterday and then he brings it also today because the Bible sayses of the Lord are new every morning so now as you raise up in the morning there's already a new Mery for that day prise the name of our Lord you have to take it fa you know the new day your body has been replenished you are strong in the morning the sun has just started Rising every living thing is rejoicing for the new day so even us also we need to rejoice in the day that God has given unto us that song that this is the day the Lord has made will rejoice in it and that should be how our life should be moved praise the name of Lord every morning so when God gives you life to live the new day Grace that is given to us for that day there Mery that is given to us that day opportunities that are given to us that day and don't think of yesterday your failures of yesterday your disappointments of yesterday your weaknesses of yesterday it's a new day so now you rise up rejoicing no wonder the Bible says and shine praise the name of our Lord the good of God every moment that God gives us life it's a time to rejoice in his goodness praise the name of our Lord God was telling here in Isaiah 43 saying is fear not for I have redeemed thee called the byy name mine praise the name of the Lord God says you are mine that means he takes charge over everything that happens to you everything that you go through every trouble that you go go through he is concerned about your very life he knows every detail he knows what lays ahead in the life that we living in there's a lot of uncertainty you don't know what's going to happen but then you need to commit all your ways unto God will bring them to come to pass God will take charge over all those issues that concern your life praise the name of let us go to verse two the Bible says when you pass through the waters I will be with you praise the name of our Lord say when you pass through the waters so there are circumstances that God allows to come to our lives you were not created to pass through the waters you were created to pass on dry ground but yet the waters can come the floods may come so now when the floods come he gives us the assur that I will be with you so in other words he will lift you up that they will do you no harm praise the name of our Lord then he says when you go through the rivers praise the name of the Lord you going through the rivers a lot of water but what does the scripture say here they shall not overflow you in other words you are not going to drown but he raises you up now he does not say I will take you I remove the rivers he does not say I will remove the waters but he says if the waters come I will be with you if the rivers come they will not overtake you but you will go through them praise the name of the Lord he said also about the fires when you walk through the fire he didn't say I'm going to quench the fire down praise the name of but he said when you go through the fire it will not burn you neither shall def upon you praise the name of the Lord you see how interesting the promises of God are he says I will not stop the the rivers I will not stop the waters but now when they come he gives you Grace to pass through those St praise the name of Lord like the Hebrew children in Daniel chter 3 and then verse 25 okay we can start from ear than that Daniel 3 Daniel chapter 3 Daniel and then we read in verse and then the Bible says there are certain Jews whom thou Hast set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach mishak and abano these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor I worship the golden image which thou Hast set up then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach mishak and abano then they brought this men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them is it true or shedrach mishak abano do not you serve my gods nor I worship the golden image which I have set up now you see that the three Hebrew children were put to a challenge and then they rejected worshiping other gods they rejected worshiping the golden image praise the name of Lord now they took them to the king and the King gave them an opportunity decide now whether toship my images or to go into the fire praise the name of Lord so there was a choice praise the name of our Lord goded them to go through it and then there are some STS in our lives the name of our Lord maybe God would permit them for the purpose of our Redemption for the purpose of his name being glorified to find out what is your stand to find out what is in your mind what decision do you make in your life [Music] so then we see that were not afraid of the King's Command in verse Shadrach mishak and abano answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we ser love is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fairy furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto you oh King that we will not serve thy Gods norship theen image set for praise the name of our Lord they made a decision we are not going to do something wrong we're not going to turn against our God even when we are faced with challenges in life you shouldn't stand against the word of God you need to stand up with the word of God praise the name of our Lord you know like sometimes young young ladies you know they want to get jobs and then when they go to the B of the company then the of the company tells them if you don't sleep with me there's no joke so you must make a decision I am not going to do something evil to get favor from you that's what doing they we are not going to serve your God our God will deliver us even if he doesn't Deliver us we are not going to do anything contrary praise the name of the Lord nez's anger raged up and the Bible says make theurn hotter seven times they had made it seven times says the fire consumed them but now Shadrach Mish and when they went into the fire praise the name of the Lord fire never burn them neither cloes praise the name of the Lord the Bible says nothing harmed them at all praise the name of our Lord where God has said even if you go through the fire it will not burn you praise the name of our Lord why doesn't the fire you because God is right there with you praise the name of the Lord why doesn't the water overtake you because the Lord is right there with you why don't the rivers sweep you away is because the Lord is there with you so you need to have confidence in whatever challenge you are going through in life that God is a present help in trouble praise the name of the Lord he gives you strength he gives you comfort he gives you you know ability to keep on going forward so he tells us Be not Afraid don't be troubled be a trial you're going through don't be trou just have your focus on God and just depend upon God take you whatever challenge of life you're going through I said Lord I need your help I need your deliverance praise the name of Lord be not trou not your heart be troubled believe in God also in me why would you believe in God why would you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ because is right there in your strength the of Lord you don't allow theil to tell you now for me God has deserted me David say even if I go in hell I will get him there praise the name of the Lord there's no one place than hell right now but he says when if I go in hell I find him there how about your station you just need to recognize that the Lord is present with me the way he was with shadra praise the name of our Lord now in the message I know brother Bram says and sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were Sinners it is written many is the Affliction of the right but God delivers him from them all God promised many afflictions strange feelings strange things that would be beyond our understanding but it is always done for our good we just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be a Fai to us we would go with an understanding but we do it and we have it and we believe by faith his word that it is going to work some good thing for us if we could grasp that today all this morning if we could grasp that all of our trbl and there is none of us IM from and if we could realize that those things are for our good it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that the trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than gold for it is God giving us those this trials after we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory it is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come I want to join this morning with to send that I've lived long enough to know that's the truth I have seen it in my own life that every great every time great stuation Rises I can't get around it or I can't go under it I can't go over it God makes a way and comes out glorious I just wonder how his grace ever does it but he does it and remember in all these things Satan tries to make us nervous upset us and get us to think oh why did this happen why couldn't I have been like this praise the name that's what brother is telling us that all Ds God permits to come our way they make us to know God better than we ever knew him before they make you get a testimony a personal testimony a person experience praise the name of our Lord and then he say sometimes DS come you cannot go over it you cannot go around it you cannot go under it but you are in a fix like the children of Israel when they were living Egypt and then the Army OFA started following them first they were walking on foot but the arm of was on chariots and now God made sure that they pass between mountains and so on and then in front they reach the Red Sea the armies of were coming behind them this side was a mountain this side was a mountain and the waters was before them and the enemy was behind them praise the name of Lord sometimes those are STS that we go through you can't help yourself you can't do anything much the only thing that you need to learn in whatever Stu you're going through the Bible says cast all your cares unto the Lord every burden every trial Lord here it is I don't know how to go through it and sometimes God permits us to make foolish foolish decisions you make a foolish decision then you say Lord me and then you allow God to give you the grace overcome that kind of praise the name of our Lord and so here brother Bram says that when we are going through this STS The Devil Makes Us to become nervous you know you become afraid you become troubled and then you start wondering how can this be how how overcome this as Satan makes us nervous then you can find that you are getting other diseases now there is in this message it's I be not afraid praise the name of the Lord he says now he was on discernment and then he was talking to this woman but you are one of your main Tres and your main trouble is nervious condition you are bed which has given you a stomach TR now you can imagine happens then you become thinking about that sitation all the time how will I clear this debt how am I going to pay school fees for my children how am I going to handle this trouble and then you think about it all the time even at night you're thinking about it when you wake up you're thinking about it through the night you're thinking about and yet the Bible tells us let us go to MTH then we shall come back to that scripture Matthew praise the name of our Lord and then verse 31 it says therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where shall we be closed for all these things do the Gentile seek for your heavenly father knows that you have need of all praise the name of the Lord so TRS come STS come but what does he tell us in his word in verse 33 says but seek ye first the kingdom of God his and all the things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for for the moral for the moral shall take for the things of itself sufficient the day is the evil thereof that's what the scripture is telling us so you commit your ways unto the Lord commit your trto God I commit everything about me into your hands guide me through this if it is a river Lord give me Grace to pass through this river that I'm not overtaken by the fls praise the name of Lord don't allow to Fall by the trial you're going through to come to church I'm no longer going to read my Bible I'm no going to read message book The Devil you know the devil now is trying to trap you and then when the devil traps you it will become worse than what you are in praise the name of our Lord so that's the time you just said Lord here I am Lord help me Lord deliver me praise the name of the Lord you the example of the life of Job praise the name of our Lord he lost the children in one day he lost his animals in one day he lost many things in one day and God would permit one person to survive and comes and tells job then when this one is giving this report just finished like this another comes when this one has finished another comes when this one finishes another comes and the destruction happened in different [Music] ways the wind came and Brew the house and the house fell on the children and they all the lightning came and threw some animals then the SE also came and took some other animals then the other one again something else happened he received all these reports in one day but then the Bible says inob 1 and verse then job arose and rent his mant shaved his head fell down upon the ground and what did he do he woried praise the name of our Lord he said you are worthy oh God you worthy to be praised worth of all honor praise the name of the Lord like when Shadrach and Mish were in the fire they had a great time of worship the Bible says they were just walking in the fire and then there was the fourth person like the Son of God working with them having a great jubile praise the name of our Lord so the trials we go through are opportunities to know God better praise the name of Lord you get to know God better when you fall sick you get know God better that is healer praise the name of the Lord he killed me in this kind of disease he delivered me this kind of sttion he will also deliver me in this kind of situation God allow David to go and take of the sheep of his father and allowed the bear to come and attack the [Music] ship and when David saw the bear taking the ship he didn't run away but he went and killed the bear praise the name of our Lord and from one Tri to another one the lion came he had more boldness to face the lion he also killed he was developing his testimony he was not troubled he was not afraid he had that kind of boldness he had that kind of confidence praise the name of our Lord and now when he goes to see his brothers and then stands up and gives a challenge prise the name of our Lord go the book of First Samuel praise the name of our Lord Samuel 1 and then we can start reading from verse vers four and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named gorus of GA whose height was six cubits and a span now when you look at these measurements Oneal and half ft you know theb is like from the the nails here up to and so when he would stand up his head was on our wall plate there that was the man would come GI and then he made a challenge of 40 days [Music] would come and then he would say in verse 8 and he stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel andto them why are you come out to set your battle in AR am not I a phe and you Servants of Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he be able to fight with me and kill me then we will be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then you shall be our servants and you serve us now you see the challenge every day was coming and then the Bible says the fistin said I def the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together [Music] praise the name of you know this was like you come into the ring hey come into the ring and you may be going through a situation where you in the ring with it you may be going through a St and you in the ring with that St are you going to jump out or you going to stand and put the enemy down praise the name of our Lord and this is what gor he was there days and 40 are the number of Temptation number of trial right there challenging them and the Bible says when would come and give that challenge when sa and all Israel heard in verse [Music] 11 the words of the they were dism and they were greatly afraid they were troubled you know they didn't know what power of God stands in their midst they were all afraid the Bible says you know they would run away they would hide themselves it was a great challenge but now as children of God we need to stand like David praise the name of Lord challeng head [Music] on you know you don't take off shadra and mishak they said we are not going to go down to these things Daniel when the whole they got a hold of him and put him in the lion his Daniel he said God sent his Angel and theel was able to stop the lions from eating him we have the same Promises of God With Us that whatever challenge you going through God is a very present help in trouble praise the name of our Lord he he gives you the grace to overcome that gave David boldness and David said more than to go and face that was not supporting David but David went by faith he picked five Stones the number of faith and he threw it and the Lord himself guided the stone until went and killed thee so even our situations just committed to the Lord and said Lord this is what I'm going through lord it's not pleasant for me Lord this is the challenge I'm going through the Bible says whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord what will happen to them shall be saved praise the name of the Lord call God to your deliverance call God to your [Music] deliverance that's the testimony of David this man is coming under the gods of the phines but I go in the name of the Lord God of Israel 43 said in verse one is fear not I am your Redeemer so God is even Our Redeemer in every that we go through just bring it to the Lord and say Lord this is the St I'm going through Lord this is the challenge I'm facing in my life and then you see the Redemption of the Lord praise the name of our Lord so let us go back to this quot he says the main problem of the woman was a nervous condition and you are bothered and this nervous condition has given you a stomach trouble you have a stomach trouble and a nervous condition [Music] and the nerv condition gives you the stomach trouble which causes sness in the bottom of the stomach it is a peptic right in the bottom of the stomach and things make you Bel CH stuff and then I see you turn away from many foots at the table that is exact praise the name of Lord again you'll see in this same message praise the name of our Lord let us go to the the next paragraph in the next paragraph he now Discerning another person he says you are suffering also with a nervous condition paragraph 34 you have a Ladi trouble which is aale you also have a stomach trouble with that's bothering you you believe he can heal you you believe he will got somebody you got somebody on your heart then he says he says that is a that's your husband he says you believe me to be his Prophet or his is a real nerv and it has caused him to have a prostate trouble now you see to The Other Woman it brought and message to another person to brought high blood pressure and then now to this man it brought prate trouble now but you see in all these things it is the devil so now when you give your mind to tr your worries then the devil keeps on bringing other demons so now that's why the Lord told us be not be troubled let your heart not be troubl whatever you are going through learn to commit it to the Lord in prayer put it before the Lord God this is the Str I'm going through Lord these are the fear that I have Lord I'm bothered with this kind of condition and when you put it before God Keep On Believing God for that station and then you don't go again and then get worried about this worried about this worried about this but put it before the Lord and allow the Lord to take charge over your troubles praise the name of our Lord allow God to come in your situation allow go to take full charge over everything praise the name of the Lord in the message it is I he said and brother When They Crucified him at Calvary the world thought they had him thought they him it Hima the name of Lord knowa confused when it goes to hell they say now when you tell people that Jesus went to hell then they will say it's not there because they are confused in their words praise the name of our Lord amen because the don't speak praise the name of the Lord but in they speak they see of course those are souls in prison now he says the devil thought he had him but broke every SE not only climbed through car every Star he set at the right hand of the Majesty tonight and his eyes on the SP and I know he watches me do you he sees our trouble our frustrations everything ring this way and some of them trying to say well I just don't believe it and saying this way sickness cancer diseases all kinds of things setting among the Christians getting off acting and wildly and everything just let the wipe come in that is all but remember setting up high watching you seeing you what you're going to do right in the darkest of the hour when all hope was gone for a Revival here he come walking on the sea and here he come walking down along on the sea praise the in whatever trouble you may go through whatever you may go through don't lose hope praise the name of the Lord just allow him to take charge and have your confidence in the Lord praise the name of the Lord and the Bible says in Isaiah chapter 26 then and praise the name of Lord Isaiah 2 it says though will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting [Music] strength praise the name of our Lord the Bible says in whatever condition you're going through put your trust in God and that trust is know is like having faith in [Music] God having confidence in God being hopeful in God regardless of D Praise the name of Lord trust in God and then you tell God about what you going through and say Lord I seek your deliverance in this condition I seek your help in this kind of I need to be delivered out of this Str I need more grace to go through this kind of praise the name of our Lord you know like there are some ations which you may not be able to reverse what has happened you may not be able to reverse what has happened praise the name of Lord you know like maybe somebody passes on you know but then the thing there that one next Lord give me Grace to go through this kind job trusted in godob had hope in God had confidence in God and said I came naked to the world the lord has given and the Lord has taken away praise the name of our Lord you need to see that you trust in God not only in the positive things but even in the negative things said the Lord is more than you know to help me out of dist not only when you are [Music] healthy but even when you know you are sick not only when you have a job but even when you don't have a job in every condition we go through in life we need to learn how to trust in God commit all thy ways unto [Music] God that's what the Bible tells us and then the Lord will make them come to pass so now the Bible is telling
