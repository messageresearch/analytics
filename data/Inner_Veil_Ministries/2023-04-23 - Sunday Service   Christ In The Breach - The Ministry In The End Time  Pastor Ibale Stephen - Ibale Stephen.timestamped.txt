[21:41] praise
[21:43] [Music]
[21:49] another
[21:55] [Music]
[22:01] I won't have to close Jordan Alone
[22:06] amen you may be seated
[22:08] you're welcome to the house of the Lord
[22:10] this morning
[22:12] amen so
[22:15] um
[22:19] it's a cold Sunday morning
[22:23] amen amen yeah but we appreciate
[22:35] I meant to give this ministry an
[22:38] opportunity
[22:40] the only reason why I'm a preacher
[22:46] is because
[22:48] of your people
[22:52] brother Branham said
[22:56] that the gift is not his
[23:00] it was for the people
[23:03] amen amen so we are here today
[23:08] we trust the Lord will
[23:11] be gracious to us
[23:14] we had a long drive yesterday
[23:20] I don't want that Echo praise the Lord
[23:24] so all the way from Nairobi
[23:29] amen from five in the morning
[23:33] and we got home at 5 30.
[23:39] the Lord was so gracious to us
[23:43] we bring greetings from the Saints there
[23:47] amen praise God
[23:51] now
[23:53] you see we are in this series
[23:57] where we are dealing with the bridge
[24:02] we are dealing with the revelation
[24:06] of Jesus Christ
[24:08] and you know Revelation is not
[24:11] uniformity of understanding
[24:16] amen amen but rather uniformity of Mind
[24:23] amen which mind is the mind of Christ
[24:27] himself
[24:30] so this mind is allotted to the body
[24:36] the mind of Christ
[24:39] is given to the entire body
[24:42] let this mind be new
[24:46] which was also in Christ Jesus Christ
[24:50] not an individual
[24:53] if you are not part of the body
[24:56] then you are not part of the mind of
[24:58] Christ
[25:00] every body
[25:02] is a steward to this uh is a steward to
[25:07] a measure
[25:08] of revelation of Christ
[25:14] amen amen but when we come together in
[25:17] respect of our measures
[25:22] then we have got a greater revelation of
[25:25] the mind of Christ
[25:30] you understand what I mean
[25:32] so the revelation of Christ
[25:36] which God gave unto Joy
[25:41] to show his servants
[25:44] but then when you look at when he begins
[25:47] to dispense
[25:53] amen what Ephesus God
[25:57] as a revelation of Christ
[26:00] was just a part of the general
[26:03] revelation
[26:04] foreign
[26:12] churches
[26:18] every Church bringing its posture
[26:22] and then we add it together to Advocate
[26:25] our life we've got the fullness of the
[26:27] person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:30] so these different portions of
[26:32] Revelation
[26:35] we're not uniformity of understanding
[26:40] but yet every person was the revelation
[26:45] of the mind of Christ
[26:48] so as we get into the teaching of the
[26:51] word this morning
[26:53] you may not understand everything
[26:57] but yet every one of us has got a
[27:01] portion which the Lord has allotted for
[27:04] him today
[27:06] amen I mean every one of you will take
[27:10] something home
[27:12] amen Amina we thank God for that that's
[27:16] the way God works
[27:43] but we want to sing with faith we want
[27:48] to sing the

[33:10] the sentences
[33:17] [Music]
[34:24] for the general Italian
[34:35] is this system Ivan
[34:39] foreign
[34:51] [Music]
[35:16] behold
[35:34] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[35:38] before the coming of the great and
[35:40] grateful day of the Lord
[35:43] and you shall turn the heart of the
[35:46] fathers
[35:48] to the children and the Heart of the
[35:51] children
[35:52] to their fathers lest I come and smile
[35:56] the Earth with the curse
[35:59] may the Lord
[36:02] bless the reading of the world
[36:08] so you know we are going in the series
[36:11] on the bridge
[36:15] and you know I've called those series
[36:18] Christ in the bridge
[36:22] but then I've got messages in there
[36:29] so today we are dealing with the
[36:32] ministry in the end times
[36:37] four and six
[36:39] is
[36:41] the ministry of Christ in the end of
[36:44] time
[36:46] and this ministry course that elect out
[36:50] of Babylon
[36:52] to bring them into the body of the
[36:56] church
[36:58] to be the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:02] now when we talk about the coming out
[37:07] coming out to Babylon
[37:10] we know that when the first fall came we
[37:13] didn't
[37:15] amen Amina you see man lost his uh
[37:26] God started working bringing man into
[37:30] restoration
[37:33] and always man has had a desire
[37:37] to be connected back to his father
[37:42] amen but then we remember
[37:47] amen Amina Nimrod built a tower
[37:52] he was determined to see God
[37:56] bypassing the word
[37:59] which is not possible so now God
[38:02] confused the languages
[38:12] it is out of there that we get the word
[38:15] Babylon
[38:18] which means confused
[38:21] so then God calls Abraham
[38:25] to be father of faith
[38:29] he was given an unconditional Covenant
[38:34] but before he could work with God
[38:38] God called him out of Babylon first
[38:42] to allow that God was going to show him
[38:47] and then Abraham accepted
[38:51] and he lived by faith
[38:55] and we know that out of there
[38:58] come Isaac the child of the promise
[39:02] and then Jacob comes
[39:05] and out of Jacob comes the 12 patrons
[39:10] and now out of those 12 patrons
[39:14] comes the nation of Israel
[39:17] amen whom God had called
[39:20] and considered them his own eyes
[39:25] and now we see that they come to a point
[39:29] and they rejected Joseph and yet Joseph
[39:34] was the one who had the uh Ministry for
[39:39] that disease
[39:42] [Music]
[39:53] [Music]
[40:07] and the entire family
[40:24] and then finally Joseph dies
[40:27] but then you see they continue for 400
[40:32] years
[40:33] amen but after that time you know they
[40:37] came a time
[40:39] when a pharaoh for love wouldn't have
[40:42] respect for Joseph
[40:45] and when this man grows up
[40:50] Israel became slaves
[40:54] in the land of captivity
[40:57] but then you know us had been promised
[41:02] amen they were delivered
[41:05] according to the promise that God made
[41:07] for Abraham
[41:10] they were delivered out of there
[41:12] by a mighty hand of God
[41:16] under the ministry of Moses
[41:18] are you together with me so now they
[41:22] come up
[41:23] into the land of promise
[41:29] which continued going forward
[41:32] but after some time
[41:34] God warned them against you know the
[41:37] things that were going wrong
[41:40] foreign
[41:43] [Music]
[42:04] and they were there for 70 years
[42:08] oh my God
[42:09] praise the Lord So Daniel
[42:13] in coming out of Babylon he was not only
[42:18] looking for going back to Jerusalem
[42:22] to rest toward the natural thing
[42:25] I want you to recognize that
[42:28] you know
[42:29] he was thinking about the Final
[42:32] Redemption of his people Israel
[42:39] when he came out of baby are you
[42:42] together with me so he had looked at the
[42:46] Captivity
[42:47] [Music]
[42:49] the inventions of the media nice and the
[42:52] amalekites
[42:55] and the Philistines in the days of the
[42:59] judges
[43:00] and then here again
[43:03] the 70 years in Babylon
[43:07] and then he felt enough was enough
[43:11] I do not know whether you have come to a
[43:14] point
[43:15] where you have ever said enough is
[43:18] enough
[43:20] there Comes A Time In Our Lives
[43:25] [Music]
[43:27] of the spiritual lapses in our lives
[43:32] and then we cry enough is enough
[43:36] you are going up and then again you
[43:40] start coming down you you fight your way
[43:43] up
[43:44] amen and you're at the top of the mouth
[43:47] you are rejoicing and praising us
[43:53] those kind of things you come to a point
[43:57] where you say
[44:01] foreign
[44:10] [Music]
[44:20] [Music]
[44:29] [Music]
[44:41] [Music]
[44:49] [Music]
[45:02] he needed the release
[45:05] from this kind of condition and he said
[45:09] oh Wretched Man yeah
[45:13] who shall deliver me from the body of
[45:16] this death
[45:18] amen Daniel didn't like it
[45:22] I'm going to Jerusalem yes but that's
[45:26] where we fell from yeah
[45:30] when will my people be taken out of this
[45:35] nation
[45:39] that's the desire of everyone
[45:41] amen Humanity grows
[45:47] Amen to be a doctor to wheat the change
[45:51] of their body
[45:59] was in the same understanding
[46:02] but please exit from Babylon
[46:05] to construct the temple was not enough
[46:10] are you together with me they were going
[46:13] down
[46:14] [Music]
[46:16] he remembered we have been in Egypt
[46:19] before
[46:21] we've been tormented by the Gentile
[46:23] Kingdom
[46:26] we were bitten out of Jerusalem
[46:29] for us to go back to Jerusalem and
[46:33] reconstructed the temples
[46:37] I want to say something here that coming
[46:41] to church is good but that's not enough
[46:45] we need to grow
[46:48] for the Redemption to with our bodies
[46:53] because as long as we're in these bodies
[46:56] Our human spirit will constantly battle
[47:01] the pools of evil
[47:05] amen amen that's what you go through
[47:08] every morning everything
[47:12] you are in battle amen you know you are
[47:16] born again you know you are a child of
[47:19] God

[48:27] [Music]
[48:29] so there is a constant Feud
[48:53] you are baptized
[48:58] but then there is the battle
[49:00] the last of the flesh the last of the
[49:04] eyes the pride of life you are tormented
[49:09] in those battles
[49:13] [Music]

[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:44] all these other groups

[1:17:09] by a supernatural presence
[1:17:15] the Lord himself descends
[1:17:20] in the ministry
[1:17:24] that's what separates us
[1:17:30] to bring us here in the bridge
[1:17:34] that's why you are no longer a
[1:17:37] denominational believer
[1:17:41] Hallelujah you are talking about the
[1:17:44] presence of the Lord himself
[1:17:51] today is the time like Israel was before

[1:18:08] that God was doing
[1:18:11] for the children of Israel for them to
[1:18:15] realize
[1:18:20] amen amen because they were living in

[1:18:59] Powers

[1:19:32] speaking to them by a prophet now the
[1:19:36] prophet cannot be told them to apply
[1:19:39] that okay
[1:19:41] the way they applied
[1:19:44] is by believing what the prophet told
[1:19:47] him
[1:19:48] and they do it and that's the way we are
[1:19:53] going to apply the tokens
[1:19:57] not coming to church
