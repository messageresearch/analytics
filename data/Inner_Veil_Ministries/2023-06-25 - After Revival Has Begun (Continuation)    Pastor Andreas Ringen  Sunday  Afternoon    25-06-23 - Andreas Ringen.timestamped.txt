[37:33] this evening
[37:37] we just want to continue
[37:39] on the thoughts
[37:42] on on after the Revival has begun always
[37:49] I want to read one scripture
[37:51] also maybe we stand together
[37:54] and then we want to read from the book
[37:57] of Genesis
[37:59] we want to read again Genesis
[38:02] we just as we was reading this morning
[38:05] we want to go to
[38:22] this is when the Revival begins
[38:26] when God is coming on the scene
[38:30] amen Amina yes he amen this is when
[38:35] Revival begins
[38:37] not when man is coming on the scene
[38:41] but when God is coming
[38:45] amen we want to go to Genesis 18.
[38:49] in Genesis
[38:52] and uh verses one and two you want to
[38:55] read again
[38:57] I mean this morning we have read from
[38:59] Genesis 2.
[39:01] and we have seen how that great Revival
[39:05] started
[39:08] and then we know the fall came in
[39:12] amen but we are promised a Total
[39:16] Restoration
[39:17] where the church is become back
[39:20] six thousand years of creation and now
[39:24] we had six thousand years of redemption
[39:27] amen amen and Redemption
[39:30] a greater work than creation
[39:33] so what God is doing now is it great to
[39:37] work what he had done then
[39:39] amen Amina and we're a part of it
[39:42] Genesis 18.
[39:46] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[39:49] plains of memories and he sat in the
[39:52] tent Door In the Heat of the day and he
[39:55] lift up his eyes and looked in low three
[39:57] men stood before him and when he saw
[39:59] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[40:02] door and bowed himself towards the
[40:04] ground and said my Lord if now I have
[40:08] found favor in thy sights pass not away
[40:11] I pray thee from thy servant
[40:14] foreign
[40:28] [Music]
[40:40] amen Amina let us pray together and if
[40:44] there's anybody here that want to be
[40:45] remembered
[40:47] just make it known to him to the
[40:49] uplifting of your hands
[40:51] let's believe like we sang this morning
[40:57] amen amen the heavenly father also I
[41:01] have lifted my hands
[41:03] father we pray we know you know what we
[41:07] need
[41:08] you know what we really need
[41:11] we pray this evening
[41:13] just have mercy again on us
[41:16] give us the abundance of your mercy and
[41:20] Grace
[41:22] why we just heal yourself for real
[41:25] ourselves for service
[41:28] we pray that you will bless us one more
[41:30] time
[41:31] in Jesus Christ
[41:33] amen amen amen God bless you maybe I
[41:37] mean
[41:38] amen amen so this evening we just first
[41:41] we just want to uh
[41:43] I don't want to call it a little
[41:48] studying
[41:51] yeah do we want to see what God is
[41:54] really doing and what God has done
[41:57] at what time what time we are living in
[42:01] to raise us the level the level of
[42:06] awarenessa because brother Adam said if
[42:10] God is not recognized
[42:12] his power is not revealed
[42:15] so when God is recognized
[42:18] when God is acknowledged
[42:21] when God is yeah when people understand
[42:23] God is present
[42:25] like the woman
[42:28] she understood next to all the years of
[42:32] of problems she has
[42:34] [Music]
[42:37] she never developed a bad attitude
[42:40] she was for 12 years the Bible says she
[42:44] had that sickness
[42:46] and yet when Jesus came yes she was
[42:50] quite aware and awake
[42:54] she paid respect to him
[42:57] she said if I can only touch his
[42:59] garments
[43:01] not then when he is touching me but when
[43:05] I only can touch his gums
[43:07] then I will be made
[43:09] what a respects
[43:13] what an attitude of a woman was for more
[43:18] than 12 years
[43:22] the right kind of attitude so that we
[43:26] just come and touch him because if we
[43:29] touch him then all things are possible
[43:31] amen Amina amen Amina amen so so uh we
[43:36] just as we have read and also we want to
[43:39] say brother Branham when brother random
[43:41] said about Revival
[43:43] foreign
[44:43] this time and decision for everything
[44:47] there's a time of planting there is a
[44:50] time of of harvesting there's a time of
[44:54] growing there's a season for everything
[44:57] amen and we have to understand the
[44:59] seasons
[45:00] so that we act in the right kind of way
[45:04] if it is
[45:09] if it is planting time it's not the time
[45:13] of harvest if it is growing time you
[45:16] should not go on the field trying to
[45:18] harvest
[45:19] you should know what we are doing today
[45:22] amen we should know where we are
[45:24] absolutely
[45:27] surely it's also the planting time
[45:30] for some it's harvest
[45:32] for some some some crops is Harvest
[45:35] everything
[45:38] [Music]
[45:51] I mean okay
[45:53] okay fine you understood that see that
[45:55] you get it so there's but now we really
[45:58] want to see
[45:59] what what season we are in what is the
[46:03] main season we are in I said
[46:05] amen amen what is the main what is the
[46:07] dominating season
[46:09] and when the prophet comes when God
[46:13] sends a special man
[46:15] God comes himself on the scene
[46:18] and it always shows it's the changing of
[46:21] the seasons
[46:24] amen amen that's how we saw in the
[46:26] beginning
[46:28] you know as Adam actually came on the
[46:31] scene
[46:32] there was a change of seasons
[46:35] amen that's the Revival started
[46:38] amen God came on the scene
[46:42] God was doing a work with his children
[46:45] it showed a change of the seasons
[46:49] amen I mean I want to let you know the
[46:53] prophet arrives
[46:58] when the prophet Rises on the scene when
[47:01] the prophet rise on the scene
[47:04] amen then there's a change taking place
[47:09] amen Amina we just must we hold that
[47:12] really in mind when God is coming on the
[47:16] scene in a special way
[47:17] there is a change of the Season
[47:21] something is starting
[47:24] and I just want to let you know that we
[47:28] are after
[48:28] foreign
[48:42] without the foreign
[48:59] foreign
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:47] um
[50:11] [Music]
[50:18] [Applause]
[50:24] no church anymore
[50:27] I'm going to call you bride
[50:30] [Music]
[50:32] foreign
[51:03] foreign
[51:38] foreign
[52:08] okay
[52:30] [Applause]
[52:52] [Applause]
[52:55] that's what he can say you have no
[52:58] rights
[53:00] [Music]
[53:01] [Applause]
[53:03] everybody
[53:32] can you Jesus says Adam can you see the
[53:34] second Adam oh and Adam welcome it he's
[53:36] speaking through William Brothers
[53:38] so close together but you don't see the
[53:41] difference
[53:43] was not the son of man brother was a son
[53:47] of a man
[53:49] [Applause]
[53:53] it is not me I'm just jealous
[53:58] so then when I speak he can speak
[54:02] [Applause]
[54:11] he's
[54:15] using my body
[54:19] [Applause]
[54:21] amen amen so then he said and I call you
[54:25] brighter
[54:27] so it's separated just for him marriage
[54:40] amen amen if you call a certain lady
[54:43] your bride well
[54:49] that speaks of marriage
[54:53] either you have married her
[54:55] or you know or you want to marry her
[54:59] but your choice is falling
[55:08] Christ's Choice praise is Fallen
[55:16] amen amen
[55:18] hallelujah hallelujah so we understand
[55:20] how it starts how the Revival started
[55:24] I want to make it maybe a little bit
[55:26] more plain through to really uh um
[55:30] another example in the Bible
[55:35] there's there's something that really
[55:37] started
[55:38] what we can see in the Old Testament
[55:41] amen and just just keep in mind
[55:44] we're speaking about after the Revival
[55:47] has begun today
[55:51] before the Revival has begun
[55:54] it was not a dangerous time
[56:00] but as soon as the Revival started in
[56:03] the garden
[56:05] as soon as Adam Adam identified
[56:11] who she is
[56:13] [Music]
[56:18] deception started
[56:25] amen Amina amen amen you can understand
[56:29] why the prophet when he came to the
[56:32] seventh seal he said I have to keep
[56:35] quiet about that
[56:37] because if Satan gets a hold of it
[56:40] he can cause a great damage
[56:45] as he did in the Garden of Eden
[56:47] amen amen but then a little later
[56:50] brother randomly openly came out of
[56:54] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[56:56] he could tell us what was once in the
[56:59] mind of God he's now in the hearts
[57:05] it's now in the church
[57:14] crying for Expressions
[57:20] that's why we are here today that's why
[57:23] you live in this hour I'm sorry that's
[57:25] why God placed you in Africa that's why
[57:28] God placed you in a certain family
[57:29] that's why God placed you in a certain
[57:32] District that's why God bless you in a
[57:34] certain area because only there foreign
[57:50] then you put into the right kind of
[57:52] ground and the right kind of environment
[57:54] he brings forth yeah
[57:59] when God placed you from the after he
[58:02] made it perfect
[58:03] when God made
[58:05] that's why all that I can only say
[58:08] you're welcome I'm a white guy you're a
[58:11] black guy
[58:12] stay the way God Made You
[58:17] huh
[58:20] I don't I don't want to become black
[58:23] I don't I don't sit in the sun to be
[58:26] burned
[58:27] so he made me white yeah
[58:38] because only that way you can manifest
[58:43] that God created you for now
[58:46] [Applause]
[59:01] what he created US foreign
[59:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:20] what a time that we are in Hallelujah is
[59:23] it most glorious time
[59:25] and the most dangerous
[59:29] as soon as the enemy
[59:33] Satan Stan hurt the words of Adam
[59:44] amen amen
[59:47] he didn't know who Eve was
[59:51] Satan has no access to that
[59:55] he needs the information
[1:00:02] amen amen
[1:00:05] so as soon as he heard it because what
[1:00:08] Adam was doing was an opened was a
[1:00:11] public marriage ceremony
[1:00:18] amen amen the first marriage that took
[1:00:21] place
[1:00:22] was in the Garden of Eden marriage is
[1:00:27] the oldest institution
[1:00:31] that God has given
[1:00:33] it was performed in Eden
[1:00:36] there you had yet there you had Adam
[1:00:39] they had the woman and there you had God
[1:00:44] Amen Amina amen Amina amen the first
[1:00:48] marriage that took place
[1:00:49] and at that marriage as it is
[1:00:53] as it is the husband has to make the
[1:00:57] word um
[1:01:01] this is now bone of my bones
[1:01:04] this is the Flesh of My Flesh I will
[1:01:08] call her your name and she shall be
[1:01:12] called a woman
[1:01:14] not eat take our
[1:01:17] because she should not be
[1:01:20] the mother of all living
[1:01:29] his womb alone
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:01:46] I know
[1:01:50] and look what Adam has done
[1:01:53] look what Adam has done and his wife
[1:01:56] being deceived
[1:01:57] when his wife was found in the era
[1:02:01] he redeemed her back
[1:02:04] [Applause]
[1:02:06] foreign
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:17] by giving her his life
[1:02:19] [Applause]
[1:02:22] that's how Christ redeemed Us
[1:02:24] by giving us his life away
[1:02:31] amen Amina so when Adam said this this
[1:02:35] is no bone of my bones this is the Flesh
[1:02:37] of My Flesh she shall be called woman
[1:02:39] because she was taken out I think I said
[1:02:43] it here before
[1:02:51] you are
[1:02:54] only my womb
[1:03:01] and Adam and Adam lost his womb
[1:03:04] because before that he was both
[1:03:09] masculine and feminine and I didn't know
[1:03:13] is that right take it over
[1:03:15] he was both
[1:03:18] but now however God had taken that
[1:03:20] feminist part out of him

[1:40:15] perfection
[1:40:25] actually the Bible says
[1:40:28] be ye complete
[1:40:34] as your father in Heaven is completely
[1:40:41] that Perfection
[1:40:43] is not being Flawless
[1:40:47] come on go

[1:41:41] truth
[1:41:44] your head might tell you it's impossible
[1:41:48] because excuse me
[1:41:51] the more educated we become and get the
[1:41:54] more educated we become
[1:42:02] the more we come away from God yet
[1:42:13] education is good no problem

[2:13:40] he said and the Gentiles are cold
[2:13:44] the bride is ready the Rapture is at
[2:13:48] hand can we realize that is it just the
[2:13:52] story that's been told
[2:13:54] or something that's reality
[2:13:57] the church age
[2:14:00] has seized
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:06] the church age runs out um
[2:14:12] okay bring it back to the the other one
[2:14:14] if you can

[2:16:20] amen Amina but I think it will help us
[2:16:23] those are we that will to really
[2:16:25] understand who is here
[2:16:27] what that the Revival has started
[2:16:30] and who is here right now impregnate
[2:16:37] Christ himself is here
[2:16:43] invisible Union
[2:16:44] the words what fell on the day of
[2:16:48] Pentecost
[2:16:49] will not work this day no sir
[2:16:53] that was for Pentecost
[2:16:59] this is for the bride
[2:17:01] the going home of the Bride
[2:17:04] we got something different
[2:17:08] the Pentecostals
[2:17:11] represented that again
[2:17:17] we are today in the bright age
[2:17:25] hallelujah
[2:17:26] amen Amina we are in the bright age
[2:17:31] [Music]
[2:17:33] and the message I've heard and now I see
[2:17:37] I have heard but now I see now
[2:17:42] we are not living in Luther's
[2:17:46] ageless age
[2:17:48] all the Pentecostal ages
[2:18:01] and we are not living in Pentacles
[2:18:08] he's calling
[2:18:10] the age by the name of the messenger
[2:18:18] loses
[2:18:25] normally you had to say
[2:18:27] Branham h
[2:18:29] Monica is
[2:18:35] but why he would not do that
[2:18:38] because the prophet never puts himself
[2:18:41] on the platform
[2:18:46] you're with me
[2:18:49] okay
[2:18:51] I try to be quick
[2:18:53] I need to lay a foundation
[2:18:56] for us to get that okay and sorry if
[2:19:00] people have to go yeah just get the tape
[2:19:05] ensure that we understand that
[2:19:09] amen amen because you see I have to take
[2:19:12] put the foundation
[2:19:15] [Applause]
[2:19:17] amen Amina we're not not living in
[2:19:19] Luther's age
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:24] the Pentecostal age was the restoration
[2:19:26] of the gifts
[2:19:27] but this is the calling of the Bride
[2:19:30] this is another age we are not living in
[2:19:34] modern events May clear by Prophecy
[2:19:38] in the Pentecostal age we are living in
[2:19:41] another age amen this is called the
