them they don't know the boy they talk of a pastor amen so I'm so grateful to be back home this has been a very fruitful place and we are so grateful for the Lord amen I request you to stand on your feet usually the words are very few until I begin to preach amen that's where the Lord energes and gives the words but it's quite a blessing for me to be here Pastor James kba God bless you mightly for standing and serving the lord uh there's a lot around us that you see one connect to the other one connect to the other [Music] one amen I was the best man for brother James kba amen so sometimes I tell people when the younger people see me they think I was not a best man one time amen I was his best man you know to be a best man is something so great best it's not a big thing so God bless you dear brother amen I want to invite you to the word of God in the book of First Corinthians chapter 10 we are reading only two verses verse 12 and verse 13 amen amen the word says says wherefore let him that think he standeth take it lest he fall amen you have to think about how you are am I standing and if you know you are standing says You must take heat you fall said there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it amen says but with the Temptation also he says make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it father in the name of the Lord Jesus we have read your word and anybody can read it but it takes the Holy Spirit to give us the context Lord Jesus I want to get out of the way that you have your perfect way and speak un to us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen we may get seated so this morning the Lord put on my heart share on the way of Escape amen it says but will with the Temptation also make our way to escape so we want to look at a way of escaping he has given us a warning says if you know that you are standing then you must take he how you are standing because it's only the man who is standing who can fall amen it's a man who is upright that can go wrong so if you know you in your heart that you are standing you must be careful why the next verse tells us Temptations are coming and when this temptation is comeing they are so strong they test your life and many times when temptation is come people fall away but is is telling us that there's no temptation that is going to happen to you that has never happened to any man so when it happens look back the prophet tells us if a if there's something that's happening in your life and you don't understand why and how go back into the Bible ask the Lord has there ever been somebody who has gone through what I'm going through if there is how did they overcome it then Lord God if they were able to overcome you are the same God give me the grace that you gave so and so so that I can be able to overcome because there is no trial there is no temptation that's happening today that has never happened the Bible tells us that what is has ever been and will always be it is you and me who are new but the world the things we see they have ever been here is that amen the people have ever been here have ever been here houses have ever been here rich people have ever been here young people have ever been here people have ever been here you are not the first one amen so when you come here ask of the Lord show me how the younger people in the Bible were able to overcome show me how the old people we able to overcome show me how the people who are sick we are able to overcome there is no temptation there is nothing in new but what is has ever been and is going to be the tell you go away there will be some people who will come here and preach the gospel that amen so what is has ever been people ever sat in the church like the you sitting chch together so if any Temptation Comes Your Way amen it's nothing strange it has ever happened and some people have have overcome is that amen if it is in the fire the Bible tells us some through the fire amen some through the FL some had trials some Through The Valleys so wherever you are there's nothing in you amen God has promised in every Temptation you are not tempted above what you are able to carry is that Amen in every trial it may look like you are totally turned down but I want tell you you are more than able to bear that trial why God himself is the one who has allowed it and he will make a way is that amen he will provide a way so that you are able to overcome amen God will make a way where there seem to be no way God makes a way where there seem to be no way said amen is not the god of yesterday is the god of yesterday the god of to the god of tomorrow he is the ever presentent help in the time of trouble he makes a way is that amen God doesn't do things haaz doesn't do things haaz amen whatever he does he has got a purpose he has got a reason is that amen why is not taken an aware it is you and me who are Mor who are taken unaware for God before anything happens he already knows and because he knows he provides a way is that amen he already even set a way before you get into your Temptation before you get into your trial God has already made a way of how you are going to escape is that amen Escape is to flee is that amen the B says flee amen The Works of the devil to escape is to get out of somebody who has put you into captivity amen the enemy always captivates us he takes you captive the B say God will provide way of escape from somebody who has taken a hold of you to escape is run away from danger amen but sometimes you look around and there's no way you can be able to get out it looks like there is a river before you there is a mountain before you the enemy surrounding you and when you look around there is no way you as a human being you come to an end say God himself he will make a way amen why he doesn't allow together he doesn't allow anything to happen upon us just any I quot now making a way I don't believe that God ever run his office justly way I wouldn't run my mine you wouldn't run yours Jesus didn't die at Calvary just to say well now maybe people will feel sorry for me being that I come go to the Earth and take on the form of Flesh and they really get saved maybe if they see how pitiful I die amen Jesus didn't come so that people can be him oh sorry how they beating him it's not just taking sides with him amen you feel sorry for Jesus sometimes in the The Passion of Christ when you look at that film called The Passion of Christ people cry people shed tears when they Jesus is being be but after that they go back and they do anything else so he didn't die for that so that people can sympathize with him no he died for a reason whether people don't sympathize with him whether they don't P him whether they laugh at him he must achieve something is that amen and what he achieved is you and me he died for a purpose together so that he can make a way one of us for you who was once burned by traditions for you was once burned by sin so that he can provide a way before you came here God himself had already prepared a way of Escape so that you can be able to overcome amen God himself had prepared the word so that you can be able to overcome he will always make a way church we together do you love him amen amen he doesn't run his work up hazly God didn't do that Jesus died for one purpose that was to save those who God for knew would be saved that's right God knew there was going to be somebody sa and there had to be a preparation or made for them to be saved if there wasn't salvation wasn't possible so God for knowing that people would be saved knowing who they were you had to lay a plan down now you would say to me brother then God knows exactly who will be saved hey correctly why why does he say is not willing should perish he isn't he isn't willing that any should perish but that all might come to repentance but the order to be in but the order to be God he has to know who will do that he wasn't God because isent he's omnicient he knows he knows everything he is at every place and all powerful so for knowledge looks back say that this he know that that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning and therefore KN that all these marvelous days that we are living in now stand and witness and see the things that we have we SE we see now had to make a preparation is that amen God knew we would be here God knew the days we would be here the time would be here he knew the battles we would fight he knew the Temptations we would go through is that amen he knew the challenges and because of that he made a way prepared our way such that when we come there is a way how we can be able to overcome how would we be saved in such an hour when there is television when there are phones when there are naked people on the street how we be saved you had to make a way was that way he says in those days I send you elah the prophet before the coming of the Lord he prepare the way of the Lord God has to find people here a church without SP he had to make a way prepare the way a person to preach the gospel back to the Bible the Bible so that we can hear and believe that we can escap is that amen how could we have escaped we would have gone like the rest of the people but he made way is that amen church together there may seem like there's nothing you how is it but God has made way where the gospel can be preached with all the churches around and lose preaching and is a preaching how would you be able to overcome how would you be able to listen the true word God had to make a way for the church to be here in ginger so that those people who were to escape can come somewhere they can hear the word of God they can worship God in spirit and in truth God makes a way is that amen do you love the Lord God even guides those people amen if they have to escape there way he will guide them in Psalm 3723 24 said the steps of a good man are ordered by Lord and He Delight in his way is that amen your steps they are LED they are ordered is that amen God doesn't request you God ERS you your feet were ordered by the Lord himself God this way and you had to go this way you wanted to go this way of a good man ordered by the Lord he makes a way where there seem to be ordering your feet is that amen by Nature you would have gone somewhere else is that amen but God Made A Way and when he makes a way he orders the feet the way is there somebody must walk in so he gets your feet He commands your feet heers your feet God the feet of the right amen he say that though he fall he shall not be cast down for the Lord him with his hand is that amen telling us if you are standing be careful so that you don't fall but the B saying even if you fall is that amen the Lord will lift you up is that amen when you are walking in this way the Bible says right man for seven times shall rise up again how do you rise up again the himself your hand you up why he has made the way said this is the way there is a way that has made for the right says the ungodly and un they cannot walk in the of the right he has made a way is that amen and the Christian they walk in it is that amen there's no temptation that will take you away is that amen there's no trial that will take you away why there is no temptation that has ever happened that God has not overcome is that amen there is no Christian that has never been tempted is that amen they are tempted by the overcome God [Applause] provides hallelujah hallelujah praise be to God we are here not aaz no God has made a way is that amen you can fall seven times the say though he fall who that righteous man though he fall because his feet are being ordered of the Lord though he falls he says he shall not be utterly cast down is that amen he doesn't fall whereby they say he has fallen until his head s down no you know when people wrest they always throw one down and they want to make sure that even the head is down saying when a Christian Falls he is not utterly cast down is that amen he may look like he defeated like samon he looks like defeated deep inside of is not utterly cast down he shall rise up again why there is a way God has made for there is a way a way of Escape God open the doors for the people may God open your eyes may God give you strength so that you can see there is a way of Escape is that amen when you are bound like a Samson when you are shaved like a Samson when your eyes are taken out like a Samson when the enemies rejoicing like the Philistines God has got a way amen of how his people amen now Jesus when he was here on Earth he didn't just go about all her he had one thing to do uh he said that was the will of God who sent him and everywhere he went everything he done had a meaning he had a purpose he had a plan a for ordained plan of God everything he did and if we be the children of God our life is in the hands of God who orders our footsteps and the footsteps of the righteous Jesus never went places or did things unless it had a meaning is that amen and if we are children of God our feet order of the lord we don't go to places any he orders your Fe is that amen church this may look to be so not surprising the word of God is that amen God is coming to save us he wants take us to heaven and whatever it is his plan will never fail amen why the Bible tells us when he came he didn't come just saying oh maybe so and so maybe this one maybe this one is that amen the Bible tells us when he came he came specifically to those who were his second Timothy 2 verse 19 is that amen nevertheless the foundation of God stand having the seal the Lord knowe them that are he amen and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity is that amen are you hearing that the foundation of God is sure he knows them that are his when he came he says my sheep hear my voice he knows them that are his and he makes a way of how they can be able to overcome when he says let everyone that nameth the name of Christ beart from iniquity it's a command and the word of God vo is that amen when he says beart is not forcing you just that word depart it has got power that comes down and makes you depart is that amen when he says You must be born again he's not telling you to try to make yourself like you are born again word of God has power if you receive it transform you to be born again said amen so I am saying if you name the name of [Applause] Jesus from Evil and that word of God when you say Amen it has got effect in your [Applause] life is that amen church amen God knows his when he came to Ginger he knew his when he goes to camp he knows his is that amen if we people know our own if we people when we depart from here you don't go to any house any you go to your house is that amen you pass houses you pass houses you pass places and you got your own how is it with God doesn't he know his very own he knows he knows the house they live in he knows the number they live says he knows these and calls them by name he call us by name he calls only respond the prophet told us Jesus Christ came on the grave of Lazarus what did he do he called Lazarus by name and he said Lazarus rise up that if he didn't [Applause] call he know his own he know his friends and he calls them name I had my name your name you by God why you came is that amen he makes away church God will put something inside of you that will make you recogniz God he knows I always talk about a story that if you remember Joseph Joseph wanted to catch his brother Benjamin is that amen and Joseph he said what can I do these people don't understand me I know they are guilty but there is something I can do because I not the feet of the righteous they ordered of the Lord God has brought them here how can they catch the Revelation so he told one of his of his servants says get my cup is that amen and take it and put it in the B of the boy Benjamin is that amen so they put the cup without the people knowing and they were loed and they give them their food to go back so as they are going back the very man who put the cup he sent soldiers go and run after them and tell them that they have stolen my cup is that amen and when they went they asked everybody you people why did you do this no no we can't do that but the Master knew who was with the c and the master had provided a way to bring them down and come them down so when they begin to search they search sear where was the C it was in the in the B Benjamin and the brother they said you you're causing us problems why did you do this why they they blame him it wasn't him the Lord himself knew how to catch you he put something inside of your heart so that when the messeng the preachers of the go when they are moving around and they are preaching something will convict you you will Beed of the other people but he that made you prep the way you can come back and with him he makes a way for his people he wanted them to escape the faming but how can they escape they want to come and go they want to come and go like some Christians come and go come and go but God will make sure that one time you come and you don't go back he has a way is that amen it may be today I together once you have come you are not going why because the master come down and he wants his people you love the Lord he makes a way amen the Bible says in psalm 34:17 the rightous cry and the Lord he and deliver them out of all their troubl the right cry and why do they cry Temptations trials and the Lord the Lord delivers them is that amen he delivered them from all their troubles the Lord is n to them that are of a broken heart and service such as be of contr spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous the Lord delivers him them all because when they pray when they cry he near he's not far from me and you he will make our way is that amen of how to deliver you when the B looks like it's going low the B the basket BK the food the food basket amen when it's going low and between you and death is only one me is that am and you are saying I'm eating this and then I die when the B has gone so low God knows how to deliver your from all their troubl God Will Make A Way when you faith it looks like you have come for the last Sunday and then you go and die then God commands a somewhere and tells the birs stop bringing food to there is another somewhere who is praying who is crying and God brings Elijah God brings Elijah when the edge looks like it's dying away everything is going then the Revival from God and he RS us and rest he will make our way am that woman come to her dead end and sometimes we have made our last will is that amen and you are ready to go in such a moment God makes a way where there seem to be no way is that amen Church you hear this amen amen second Timothy 3 but thou fully known my Doctrine 31 manner of life purpose fath long suffering charity patience pers AFF which came what persecutions I endured out of them all the Lord delivered me Paul mention all the troubles all the Temptations brother there is nothing that is going to happen to us that has never happened to the Saints but you

there's a way he always and he has always amen praise be to God and which way is he going to make for you which way asked to him one time in John 145 thas said unto him we know not whether thou goest

when he looked around saw a man standing P out his who are you and on side you is that amen the man told him I am the captain the hes the captain himself of [Applause] get down am the Lord I am the way when man sinned in the of Ed God never sent an angel that he never sent Gabriel he never sent Michael what happen God himself came down and when the battle was raing and was upon the world what happen himself became uel is that amen he said I have come to deliver you is that amen he comes down and is the way amen so God has got a people that he for you and he comes down to deliver them he doesn't come to deliver any he comes for his own whom he he knew is that amen before we came here brother sometimes we were woring how are we going to overcome but how did we come here is that amen how did we come here God himself brought us here how is this message going to stand but how did you come to the message and who who gave the message is that amen he watches over his word and he watches over his own and he makes a way of es do you love the Lord Romans 8:28 says know that all things work together for good them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose is that amen all things praise be to God if you are called according to his is that am he has a purpose and he says for he did for he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son now before you came before I came he for new is that amen and then because he for knew he predestinated I always speak about that word predestination it has got two words pre and then destination your was already known before you came is that amen it was pretin before you came there God himself knew your destination and he says You must be conformed to the image of his son by all means whether it means boing you it means burning you you have to con to the image of [Applause] Jesus is that amen I have always used the statement that some of us the nature how we are born some of us are that amen so that we need to be boiled and maybe 200 de before we can melt some people's nature which is hard is that amen they never is that amen some of them say even if you put them in a Mot you cannot pound them and they get you know [Applause] crushed they and don't know why they are hard but they are like that God is determined whether you are softy whether you are hard whether you are brutal whether you are elastic you must ConEd to the image of his the word of God must be preached we all when he appears says we shall be like a and we shall know him we shall be like a I will be changed you will be changed you must be changed God is detered to change you and confirm you the image of his [Applause] son do you love the Lord amen that he might be the first born among manyen more did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them also he justified and whom he justified them also he glorified who God himself is the one who justifies God himself is the one who sanctifies God himself is the one who glorifies church out together you cannot justify another is that amen justification is an act of God human beings we can forgive but we cannot justify is that amen when somebody comes here and repent we forgive but we don't forget is that amen we always remember why you are still having the five senses memory is still alive if I do something to him and I say forgive me he will say forgiven you but then he will not forget that amen but God he justifies and justification is as if you never did it so what happens when you do something and you say God forgive me God forgives you and forgets and takes it away and throws it away forgetful so you are justified in the presence of God you never did it is that amen before man you did it you are forgiven but they have not forgotten but God forgives and forget amen so he's the one who justifies you is the one who can say this is a perfect man the one who can tell Abraham Abraham walk before me and be perfect it is God who can say that Abraham never stagged the promises of but you and me [Applause] Abraham he St I think if God would say that before sah and says my who never sted my promises this one he never St when he gave me who went with haer and I'm the one who even even rescued him from had hisory is that amen but your recording before God when you confess it is done away done behold you are a new creature in Christ Jesus all the things that am do you love the Lord amen amen we as human beings we are called to God and we must know whom we have believed Brothers why we come in the presence of God is remind ourselves of who God is and who we are before him is that amen who are we before him if we are his Tes we must know there's a song which says but I know whom I have believ and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which have committed unto him it's good for us to know that our God is a living God it's good for us to know that Jesus Christ is the love of God expressed to us is that amen I have been thinking about this amen that the Aly God is so great that heed himself and put himself in a body for what for you and me so when we talk about Jesus Christ talking about God and we must be convinced and know that Jesus Christ the expression of the love of God for us now church God is so great that I can say it's like a l of Victoria here the ocean of the earth condensing themselves and they fit in this is that possible that's what God did the whole the Earth on the Earth they were cond like this and people were able to hold the great God and John says we so we handled the word of that he say all all the fullness of the godhead bu into this body all the ocean all the lake of Victoria cond itself God condescended that amen until we were able to handle him water but in reality that was all the ocean there the the rivers Jesus Christ God who created the heavens who created the Earth who created everything condescended himself he condescended himself and fitted in a human body and on the earth the he was looking for somebody like you and the of God it brought him it made him to condescend Hebrews 116 says it say but without without faith it is impossible to please he that come to God must believe that he is when you come to God you must believe that God is and is a rewarder them that dently seek after is that amen if you think God is [Music] a is that amen like some people they think God is a good you I received God because I got a good God is not a good God is a reality is that amen God is real and when you come and you believe may God LIF me and you know whom we have believed and to be persuaded that he is able when I came to him and I gave him my life I surrendered to him he is able to lift up that life from the death and bring it back again he more than able to change my condition from sickness back to life because God the great God was able to himself and come in a body he was able the great ocean to fit a bottle like a [Applause] that's the God we ser and don't do things supposedly come to him and know that he is and a reward is that amen what he has promised he will fulfill it it is his word hold upon it like the way you holdt that amen when they give you land title and it has been sealed it has been stamped together you are you are sure that you have the land you have the land is that amen as you walk with the land title with a square is a square mile when they take away the land title taking away your land when they take away the word of from your heart they have taken away God from you because you know who gave you the land title you know the authority you can present that Land Title to cour and you say because I have this I own the land can you imagine that but what are you having a paper what makes you believe it a seal and the authority if God has spoken you can hold his word are we together you can even go to him and say God and you the one who gave me this land why are you denying Your Land Title you can go to the agent of God and present the land title and say according to the word of God this is mine is that amen you can go the angel you can go to the people and you claim what belongs unto you you can go the pastor and say Pastor I want you to pray for me and lay hands upon me he will say why according to the word of God God told if I am sick I must go the elders and hands upon it is my [Applause] right is that the pastor May Wonder but he must devil lay hands upon you there is a higher authority which commands him God has made a way his word is the way to getto him do you love the Lord and and they just don't and they just don't do things supposedly some of them does but there are some real true worshippers of of those things for instance I tell you stories of how those devils in those Idols perform all kinds of things make blood come out of things and everything else they are devils and if you don't believe there's really a devil you don't believe there is God is that amen some people when they come to God or they come to Christ they think the devil is bad thought no the devil is real just as God is real it's not a bad thought a bad thought is just part of that is that amen but the devil is real he manifest himself and when we come to God you must know God is real and the devil is real either for God or for Satan some people come and they say you know you people are just being brainwashed now they telling you some theories God is not a theory God is a reality if you come to him you must believe that he is is and award of seek after him he respects his word he respects his word amen you hear this I'm continuing now it says sure you have to believe you have go to believe the contrary the pro and the cor so there is a real devil and he is a person not a thought he is a person now there is a teaching goes on that says the devil is just an evil thought you get no no it isn't the Devil is a person the same people that the Holy Ghost is just a good thought you get but don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a person it's the person of Christ in the in a [Music] spirit together you know sometimes people end up they say the Devil is a bad but the Devil is a reality is that amen he can stage accidents that's not a bad thought it's a reality can happen he can steal he can kill he can commit adultery he can cause all evil and you see it's the devil and the SC is that amen you know uh the Bible talks about those of you have not known the depth of Satan that amen you just see the the outside of it but there are people who have fellowship with the Devil is that amen there are people who have gone into deeper things with the devil church together and there are people who have deep fellowship with God reality with God God speaking unto you God working in your life God is Not executing things in your life you know that is go speaking unto you guiding you fighting the [Music] [Applause] battle do you love the Lord so he that I'm talking about makes a way where there seem to be amen now I think that being that we see out from our congregation that life is so fragile then that death is so positive we need to come to a place that we are positive sure this that we speak of is right is that amen knowing that life is fragile fragile break is that amen knowing that the life the people I'm talking to our lives are fragile together and yet before us there is death which is real we must be positive of what we are talking about we must be sure is that amen that's why the Bible says that come to God must really know that is if we have come to this message the B says prove all [Music] things the B says make your calling and election sure don't guess around this is not another good religion this is the word of God for the hour Church Upon This we are able to cross over Jordan is that amen we have to look in the of death and say where is your why I know who I have believed is that amen we a to stand in a situation and call upon God and tell the devil tell every offer I am not ready to give in because I know what I am holding I cannot exchange it something temporal I know whom I have believed I know what I have believed I know the messenger I know the message I know the God who sent and I am sure God Is foundation God knows those who are but do we know who our God [Applause] is is that amen we always forget but he's a real God is that amen he's real it's not a good doctr sometimes people are fighting who has got the best doctr brother when death comes you don't need a good doct you need a reality you need God and when we ministers come here we always have to search ourselves church I always wonder when I'm going to preach I said what am I going to preach from one person 100 people must be listening and each one must have something to get must be dead honest is that amen I must get out of the way so that God can come why I have to answer amen is that amen I should not give them the promises I should not just exite the people I must introduce them God himself and when we come to God we must have that reality is that amen when we pray pray really when you are talking to God because he has got the word is behind it is that amen you don't have faith because of somebody you have faith because of the word is that amen there is a foundation there's something upon which I can stand is that amen like I'm saying you are going to cour you have got a title and you know the other person has faked has soldiers maybe has a lot of witnesses but for you all you have is a land title is that amen you are sure of this and you you can die for it before they take it away you tell them kill me is that amen let no nobody take away the hope you have which is the word of God is that amen do you love the Lord we must be positive amen the prophet says now the the one reason that I am a calvinistic [Music] thinker of security of the believer is because I believe that when a man or woman is in their right mind that is the time to accept the Lord Jesus and get it all settled then once forever that amen theistic thinking together is the thinking of Grace but the thing of Grace is that when you are okay come to Christ when you are so bad is that amen come to Christ with real understanding not by emotions is that amen come to God and say I know whom I have believed I've given him my life I've given him my soul I am not I'm [Music] not I'm not mad is that amen now you what the prophet continues to say it says says because when we come to the end of the road we don't know just where and how we are going to be to be sick we may we may be sick in our mind there might be a fever that would really cook our very brain and we might say anything or do anything at the end of the RO we don't know but you see if we have already Anchored In Christ no matter what sickness takes us or what condition we are when we go it's already settled we are sealed until the day of our Redemption amen Ephesians 4:3 the holy spirit of God whereby you are seal until the day not of your death but of your Redemption see after death is done over you are still sealed is that amen when we come come so when we surrender surrender so because you don't know what is going to happen tomorrow together you know when we believe baptism of the holy spirit is something which happens in the it's a seal which the devil cannot access which he cannot take away from chch together now in the body you can get sick and the prophet is saying a can come and cook your brain and when the brain is messed up you can say certain things that are not right but God knows them that are where is the seal in the soul you may find a Believer getting mad and speaking things that are not right even denying Jesus but when he's already born again because the new birth is inside of the Soul that's why the prophet is saying while we are okay let us make it right am you can fall sick until somebody can come on your death bed and make you confess that you a Muslim is that amen and you say I'm a Muslim is that amen but that doesn't mean you a Muslim it is the sick passion saying I'm a Muslim but the real passion inside is already born again he cannot change he F until the day of redemption amen I know whom I have believed I am persuaded have committed unto him that he will make a way at the end of The Journey do you love the Lord church are we together thank you so we want to look at how do we escape because the Bible say he has made the Escape he always make a Escape there is there's a shadow in the Old Testament of what they used to call ascape Goat amen escape goat we always use that word when people put know when people use you as an excuse you know many times people use others as an excuse have their problems they have their issues and they bring it upon you so for you you are called a scap goat a scap goat is a sin barrier a sin carrier go amen always the one which is set away from the people but when you look at the scap goat it is Innocent but they have put upon it the sins Leviticus chter 16 verse 15 16 yeah chapter 16 verse 5 it says it says and he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of a of God of the Gods for a sin offering and one ram for and Aon shall offer his Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house amen ver verse seven and he shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and shall cast upon the two Gods one lot for the Lord and the other lot for the scap godat how alone Aon shall bring the goat upon which the Lord is Lord fell and offer him for a sin offering go on which the Lord fa to be the scap goat shall be presented alive before the Lord to make make an atonement with him and to let him go for escapegoat Into the [Music] Wilderness amen so two gods were required in the Old Testament for for sin offering now one go they to cast a lot and and the lot fell on any of those goats so one goat was to be offered before the Lord it had to be killed amen and then the other the other goat which was called scap goat was not killed amen but the blood of the Dead Goat was put on this on this on the goat and then we are going to see that Aon the PRI how to lay hands upon the life God with the blood of the Dead God and then he would cry and then he would would confess and he would would bring all the sins of the people upon that God to lay hands upon it I don't know whether it took him a whole day or how long confessing adulter the fornications the theft all the evil the unbelief all the gambling everything was confessed when his hands were upon that go are you following the story let's continue and Aon shall bring the Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself amen amen Aon had also an offering for himself and for his house but we are looking at this offering for the congregation verse says and when he has made an end of reconciling the holy [Applause] place and the TAC of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the life go and Aon shall lay both of his hands upon the the head of the life godess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions and all their sins putting them upon the head of the go and he shall send him away by the hand of a f man into the wildness and the go be upon Him their iniquities a not inhabited let go the goat in the wilderness amen so that go after had confessed his sins they would get another person a clean person and they tell him to carry that goat and go with it far away in the wilderness away from the people and then he leaves it there and he runs back is that amen that is the goat which was called the scap goat it carried all the iniquities of the people and it never came back again one God was killed the second go it was let to go into the world so the people here they are now free they can worship God they can they can live in the presence of why one goat has died for them and the other goat has the away amen now that one was a tape of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament the Lord Jesus Christ he was B this go is the go who died and is the go who carried away the sins of the people that the B tells he was wounded for our transgressions amen and all our sins were put upon him and then he was away is that amen he was buried and when he was buried heed all our sin with them into hell that and those they cannot come back again just like the way the SC when it went it Carri the iniquities transgression people are through the wilderness and it never came back the says by his stripes we are healed when he came he iniquities our and everything why God Made A Way from The Sinner who didn't have a way coming back to God God Made A Way and provided it escap God away provided provided sacrifice is that amen praise be to God what was it the go didn't have the that amen it was innocent but it had to car the sin chch together what was it it was a typ of how God came down to cut our the B says Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God away of the world he was a lamb but he died as a goat is that amen so that we who were Gods be L the innocent you see a go entation of sin when you see a l representation of Innocence the innocent one came down and he died is that amen he was wounded together and all our sins they were carried away and he took them upon him and he died he bled but he remain only bleeding there the Bible says that blood was put on the life one is that am what does it mean he died but he also rose up again and when he rose up he took away he took our sins he took all I took all our transgression and we who remain here we are remaining in the presence of God and we are Justified and we are free why the god doesn't come back again to bring the sin the go has already died our church what am I talking about let's go to Calvary is that amen are we together friends on Cal we see Jesus Christ being wounded we see Jesus Christ being denied we see Jesus Christ being brought before the the chief priest amen and when they brought him he had to die in the presence of the PRI just like the DI in the presence of the church together amen and on that day so many Sinners there was one man who was on the cross together amen when he was on the cross he looked Jesus and he said this man is innocent and another one was accusing the one who has caused us to die and one who was saying No this man is innocent we are guilty but the innocent one because of the guil Jesus looked at him and he said today together today will be with me Paradise why many sins have forgiven I am caring them I'm going with them into hell they cannot be remember that day in I can look at another man he was called baras together on that day they cast LS and they said whom can I release for you Jesus and all the people they shouted what I do with this Jesus called Christ and they all said crucify him as a God to Die the of the world what was going on he was in prison is that amen but I believe maybe one man told him you know what is happening in today there is a man called Jesus that man he he has already stood your position today you you are the one supposed to have died but today do you see that man there do you see the cross car through the seeus falling anding he took away penalty pain took away pain heal heal the man was in prison physically he was his life was delivered but there's another man who physically died [Applause] spirit [Applause] as AIS makes's notion come sometimes you are the on the already judged never too late he's The God Who changes our situations amen it's never too late sometimes we think we are sinners and we are Beyond repair but in every situation for the sake of his children God makes a way is that amen even on the cross God makes a way his Jehovah Abraham had only one son is that amen and God came to him and he said give me that son Abraham knew this was good he was sure this is God the God who gave was The God Who was asking is that amen and then he says okay let your will be done so he takes the son along the way the sun looks around he says when when there is when we are going sacrifice there's always a lamb but here I don't see the lamb daddy where is the Lamb for sacrifice is that amen there are times we look situations is in the eye we look at the situation in the eye Jesus Christ he moved he preached he healed then he comes into and he looks God in the face says father I can see the hour that there is sacrifice but where is the sacrifice is that amen he was seeing it was him he was speaking like Isaac before his father dad isn't there something El going to take place anyway not my will your will be God will make a way where there seem to be no way when you can't bear it God will come on the scene so they went this was the last moment sometimes God takes us the last moment but he will make a way he moves you the journey you are praying if it were possible this should not happen if it were possible this should not happen but you are see you are going is is going it reaches the time the servants are left behind says Ah things are serious if it were possible this cup would be taken away is that amen not my will let your will be done and then they moved when they reached there the man begin to tie and as can you the time has come I am the sacrifice is that amen he tied him and he knew his dad when it come to things of God this man is serious is going to kill me is that amen but like a lamp that amen let your will be done they tied him together they La him down together and then the man Rose the man held his sword amen and when he was going to cut Slaughter him then the angel of the Lord God himself spto him and he says Abraham Do no harm to this child now know that you fear God I now know that you love God then when he turned around what was it there was a l together Abraham was full of tears ISAC was full of tears and Abraham I know you had to cut away all the ropes from from is that amen and when ISAC turned to look around he saw the lamb and when Abraham got the L C AB ISAC was just crying all L of God that takes away the sin of the world the L of God has come down when I was the one to die the L of God for me God provide himself sacrifice in the situation when you think there is no way he Jehovah he's a Creator he can create a l condition is that amen he can create peace for your in your marriage he can create peace for your body has been dis infected by the devil when everything is totally finished comes down he's never too late is that amen I believe when they went back is going back was potentially dead is that am but he died and Rose up again and then he moving to do what testify of the glory of God of the provision of God is that am so there is a testimony can give he says it is me are supposed to die but on the cross there somebody who di there is the testimony caned to Die the L of we have got the testimony we can say it was we are supposed to go to the of we can never go to I want Have To Cross Jordan Alone there will be somebody who come along the way and I will cross do you love him he was wounded your sickness he was breed for your iniquity you are not too much a sinner that Jesus canot atone for you is that amen there's no condition that he cannot come you I'm aief what about you what about you a what about R you say what can you talk about there is no temptation there is no excuse there is nothing you can present there's no reason for you to go to H there's no reason for you to go to hell can reject reject life you can go to hell is that am the other Thief who rejected and abused and abused and rejected what happened he went to hell other who recogniz that salvation has come that was delivered I want to say there is hope is that amen there is a way which God has made for us amen Abraham saw that way Moses when he had finished his work that amen having led the people you know he fought and he reached a time he got annoyed he struck the rock say father are this my children am I the one who produced them you reels we get water for you out of the rock together he was a man he got annoyed he got disappointed and God told him Moses you have exalted yourself because of that you are not going to go not going to acoss is that amen the the body the human being failed but God was not looking at the fa on the body what did God do when nobody could be able to BU Moses nobody was worthy amen he was high nobody could contain it there's no way mes could die and the people could believe God himself he provided a rock amen where Moses went and laid his head is that amen and the devil came the Bible says the devil came he said this is my person amen God sent the angels and they says say God rebuke you Satan how can you touch him he belongs to God God Will Make A Way is that amen even in the last time he will make a way whereby he will not allow his own to go into hell it was Elijah look at Elijah full of weaknesses he ran away they have killed all God's people the only one remaining told him no you are just confused sometimes when the battle raes we feel like everybody has left us everybody has died there is no belie so there no what are you talking about you are the one who confused that sett down a little bit God has reserved some people got a rem he made away for 7,000 not to go down idol God has made a way there is a way and when Elijah was tired his congregation could not bear to what did God do he provided a chariot and the Char came down and took him away together how are we going to the Rapture God himself will provide a word there is a translation himself he makes a way how are we going to go through this stor through the web are going on every minister is back sliding the Believers are back sliding God has made a way for his people there shall be a bride walk SP you are that you are the escaped one amen out of your tradition you are escap out of your CL you escaped out of all your culture you one people has made way amen you walk in the way has provided for you says this is the way walk in stand in the way and ask only good pass walk and you find life find peace for your soul there is a way for healing is that amen if there is a trouble of certain sickness that you find the doctors have given up there is yet one way he is the way come unto me that labor I will give you rest I Am The God Who heals all your diseases is the god who cared all your iniquities rise up again there is the hand of the Lord that is here not Cast Away that's why you are here that's why somebody is going to listen are we together because the Lord is still speaking unto you the hand of the Lord raises them up that amen there's a condition maybe you are just on the on the sacrifice box is that amen God comes down and he says do not cut this then he provides a way he will provide somebody who take your condition you provide somebody who will carry your cross sometimes the cross is too heavy and there needs to be a Simeon Jesus Christ was so strong but the prophet tells us he didn't die of the wounds he died of Sorrow is that amen he became so weak everybody departed him the 5,000 who ate his food Departed the 7,000 departed he remained with 12 the 12 also departed is that amen he was carrying a cross and he would look and fall down they are beaten he was helpless where are the people he fed where are the people he healed where the people slept with there can come a time when everybody lives in that condition you are carrying your cross and when you are carrying your cross Jesus Christ he knows the pain you feel he knows how it goes at that time the Bible says when he was praying but the cross could not be taken away when he was praying but know he could there's no way of Escape [Music] then the Angels Came is that amen and they strengthened him God sends Angels because he knows in your condition he will send awh to carry for you the cross until you make it to the end may God stand with you may you see the way that the Lord has made for you and follow that way God bless you Church the be with you has made our way for us
