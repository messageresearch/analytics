[14:09] You type in 130.
[14:13] We find many people who can't understand
[14:18] why we are so happy and free.
[14:24] We've crossed over Jordan to Canand

[17:08] This is like heaven to me.
[17:15] I've crossed over
[17:18] to God and

[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us give God a hand of praise.
[17:28] Amen.
[17:29] [Applause]
[17:31] &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord
[17:33] Jesus Christ.
[17:35] We're happy to be back this evening
[17:39] the house of the Lord.
[17:42] We keep our brother Moses in prayers
[17:48] song leader.
[17:51] We went to last night for the burial of
[17:53] his sister
[17:58] and you should take to call him and
[18:00] console him.
[18:03] praise because each of us needs that
[18:06] since you've not been able to go there
[18:10] then our pastor is not here with us
[18:11] today
[18:14] every Wednesday he has to bring his wife
[18:17] for treatment
[18:21] they spend most of the time around in
[18:23] the hospital
[18:27] so now by the time the treatment is over
[18:32] so they would just need to get back.
[18:34] That's why he's not around.
[18:37] We just keep prayers.
[18:40] Praise the name of our Lord.
[18:43] On Saturday, we have praying and
[18:45] fasting.
[18:48] So, I would request if we can all be
[18:50] around to be very good.
[18:55] Then on Sunday, we have two services
[19:00] for the youth.
[19:04] Let us pray.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this evening.
[19:09] The grace that you've given unto us to
[19:11] come into your presence.
[19:14] You said where two or three are gathered
[19:16] in your name,
[19:19] we will be there in their midst.
[19:22] And Lord, we believe you are here in our
[19:24] midst.
[19:26] So we call upon the name of the Lord.
[19:30] I pray that you may come and speak to
[19:32] us, Father,
[19:34] the words of eternal life
[19:37] that will bring a transformation in our
[19:39] lives.
[19:42] We commit all our cares and needs into
[19:44] your hands.
[19:47] Lord, we meet everyone their needs.
[19:52] Remember those who are sick and
[19:53] afflicted.
[19:56] We may heal them in such special in the
[19:58] name of Jesus Christ.
[20:01] and give us grace as we live every other
[20:03] day
[20:05] to be ready for the rapture.
[20:08] As we see the nations of the world,
[20:12] &gt;&gt; the nations of the world,
[20:15] how they are preparing for the third
[20:17] world war.
[20:21] We know that time should happen when the
[20:23] rapture has taken place.
[20:27] We pray you may help us therefore Lord
[20:30] be ready for that will take place any
[20:32] time.
[20:35] We love you and we thank you Lord
[20:38] in the name of the Lord Jesus pray this.
[20:42] Amen. Amen. Let us go to Acts chapter
[20:45] 19.
[20:49] We're reading from verse one
[20:55] up to verse seven.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says,
[21:00] &gt;&gt; "And it came to pass that while Apollos
[21:03] was at Corinth, Paul having passed
[21:05] through the upper coast came to Ephesus
[21:08] and finding certain disciples
[21:24] And he said unto them, "Have you
[21:27] received the Holy Ghost since you
[21:29] believed?" And they said unto him, "We
[21:32] have not so much as heard whether there
[21:34] be any Holy Ghost.
[21:47] And he said unto them, "Unto what were
[21:51] you baptized?" And they said, "Unto
[21:54] Johnny's baptism."
[22:04] Then said Paul, John very baptized with
[22:06] the baptism of repentance, saying unto
[22:09] the people that they should believe on
[22:12] him which should come after him, that is
[22:15] on Christ Jesus.
[22:30] When they heard this, they were baptized
[22:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[22:40] And when Paul had laid his hands upon
[22:42] them, the Holy Ghost came on them and
[22:45] they spoke with tongues and prophesied.
[22:56] And all the men were about 12.
[23:03] May God blessing of his word.
[23:06] You may be seated.
[23:08] Amen. So I want to take a subject in
[23:11] verse two.
[23:15] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[23:17] you believed?
[23:24] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[23:26] you believed?
[23:30] [Music]
[23:34] Praise the name of the Lord. That's the
[23:36] question and each of us should be able
[23:38] to answer that question
[23:43] based on your personal walk with Christ.
[23:48] You know, we are living in a time where
[23:50] there are so many understandings or so
[23:53] many theories about the Holy Spirit
[24:03] and many of them are contrary
[24:09] and many of them are offside.
[24:14] So now Paul gets these people
[24:18] Apollos and his friend
[24:21] and Apollos was a mighty preacher
[24:23] according to the scriptures.
[24:27] When you read in Acts chapter 19,
[24:31] you know, he was going around preaching
[24:33] the gospel
[24:35] and he was using the scriptures
[24:38] to preach to the people
[24:41] and proving that Jesus is the Christ.
[24:47] But then he only knew the baptism of
[24:50] John.
[24:57] Praise the name of the Lord. Now when
[25:00] Paul watched him,
[25:02] he found that there was something
[25:04] lacking in this man's life.
[25:09] And brother Brham also says
[25:12] that you can talk to the person
[25:15] and then you can know that this person
[25:17] here
[25:19] lacks the Holy Spirit.
[25:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Just talk
[25:24] and then you'll find there is something
[25:26] missing in this person's life.
[25:32] the way he was preaching
[25:36] just went directly to him.
[25:40] Apollos,
[25:42] &gt;&gt; have you really received the Holy
[25:44] Spirit?
[25:46] Since you've believed,
[25:49] he knew Apollos believed.
[25:53] He was preaching about the Lord Jesus
[25:55] Christ,
[25:56] but he was preaching about the Lord
[25:58] Jesus Christ.
[26:01] who he had understood intellectually
[26:05] but then had no a personal revelation of
[26:08] Jesus Christ
[26:12] like some of us. You know we can be able
[26:15] to explain the godhead.
[26:18] We can be able to explain the water
[26:20] baptism
[26:22] of the major topics of the message.
[26:28] But then we lack the true revelation
[26:33] from Christ. We are explaining about
[26:37] you know you have some form of
[26:39] understanding
[26:42] because you have read the message books
[26:45] because you have been coming to church.
[26:48] You have been hearing the ministers
[26:50] preach
[26:52] and you can also tell them you know the
[26:55] message is this.
[26:57] This is what it does. But then you don't
[27:00] have a personal relationship
[27:06] you know with what you are talking about
[27:09] and that was Apollos.
[27:12] Then Paul was asking him
[27:15] you are a believer
[27:17] but there is something lacking in your
[27:19] life and that's the Holy Spirit. Then he
[27:22] says, "From the time you believed,
[27:27] did you receive the Holy Spirit?"
[27:32] And then now Apollos was concerned.
[27:36] And then he said,
[27:38] "We don't know if there is the Holy
[27:41] Spirit."
[27:44] You now look at this story here. We
[27:47] don't know if there is the Holy Spirit.
[27:52] And then Paul wanted asked them again
[27:56] how were you baptized?
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Then they said John is baptism
[28:05] John who baptized Jesus Christ
[28:09] is the one who baptized us.
[28:12] And then Paul told them
[28:15] the significance of Johnny's baptism,
[28:22] the baptism of John,
[28:25] the baptism of repentance,
[28:29] pointing people
[28:32] to believe on him who should come,
[28:38] who was Christ.
[28:40] Now John preached Christ
[28:44] who is coming as a sacrifice
[28:48] to believe him as the prophet
[28:52] who has been promised.
[28:55] Praise the name of our Lord and then you
[28:57] see that people believed that.
[29:01] But then when Jesus came,
[29:04] praise the name of our Lord. From the
[29:07] time he resurrected,
[29:10] we don't preach to a Christ coming as a
[29:13] sacrifice.
[29:17] But now we preach Christ
[29:20] who has been our sacrifice.
[29:23] We preach something that has already
[29:25] happened.
[29:28] Praise the name of our Lord. We preach
[29:30] the sacrifice
[29:33] that it has already done that has
[29:35] already been done.
[29:38] So now if the sacrifice has already been
[29:40] offered,
[29:42] so what we need to do is to go and take
[29:46] the place of the sacrifice.
[29:50] Praise the name of our Lord. The gospel
[29:53] now from the day of Pentecost
[29:58] is to tell the people
[30:01] that you know take the position
[30:05] that Christ has died for you.
[30:09] It's not pointing people to Christ who
[30:11] is coming as a sacrifice
[30:15] but it is telling the people
[30:18] the sacrifice has already been offered.
[30:21] So what you need to do is accept the
[30:24] sacrifice.
[30:26] Praise the name of our Lord. Jesus
[30:28] Christ as your personal savior
[30:32] because he has died for you. And when
[30:35] you accept him as your personal savior
[30:39] like now you see the gospel that Peter
[30:42] was preaching
[30:45] on the day of Pentecost.
[30:48] He was telling them, "Repent every one
[30:51] of you
[30:53] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[30:56] Christ
[30:58] for the remission of your sins."
[31:01] Praise the name of our Lord. That's now
[31:03] the gospel that we have.
[31:06] So now the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[31:10] has no complication whatsoever.
[31:16] has no kind of a big formula here.
[31:22] Some people preach the baptism of the
[31:24] Holy Spirit
[31:26] as a very hard thing. But I want to tell
[31:30] you, it's very simple to receive the
[31:32] Holy Ghost.
[31:35] Some people preach the baptism of the
[31:37] Holy Ghost
[31:39] as something you have to take long to
[31:41] receive.
[31:44] You can take years
[31:47] or live all your life
[31:50] and then get it at the end of the road.
[31:54] But the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[31:57] you get it the moment your heart is
[32:01] ready to receive the Holy Ghost.
[32:05] Praise the name of our Lord. It's all
[32:08] about your heart condition.
[32:13] That's all. What is your heart condition
[32:17] before God
[32:19] in the message questions and answers?
[32:24] Brother Brandham says now you don't have
[32:28] to be baptized
[32:31] to receive the Holy Ghost because you
[32:33] can receive the Holy Ghost
[32:37] when your heart is right.
[32:40] Because Acts chapter 2,
[32:44] Peter give a formula.
[32:47] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[32:49] Jesus Christ
[32:52] and you shall receive the gift of the
[32:54] Holy Ghost.
[32:56] But then in Acts chapter 49,
[33:01] God turned around
[33:04] and gave the Gentiles the baptism of the
[33:06] Holy Ghost
[33:10] before there was ever before they was
[33:12] ever baptized at all.
[33:16] You see, so you see it is the condition
[33:20] of your heart.
[33:23] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[33:26] main thing.
[33:28] What is the condition of your heart?
[33:31] Look at Apples and his friends.
[33:35] They were preaching what their
[33:36] conviction
[33:40] and then Paul realized these people lack
[33:42] something.
[33:45] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[33:46] you believe?
[33:51] Have you received the Holy Ghost?
[33:55] since you believed.
[34:00] Praise the name of our Lord. And he
[34:01] said, we don't know if there will be any
[34:03] Holy Ghost.
[34:05] How were you baptized?
[34:08] So you see that the baptism of the Holy
[34:11] Spirit
[34:13] is connected with how you are baptized.
[34:19] But then here in Cornelius
[34:22] in Acts chapter 10,
[34:25] the heart of Cornelius and his friends
[34:27] were right before God.
[34:32] The Holy Ghost just came down
[34:36] when Christ the sacrifice
[34:39] was introduced to them
[34:42] and then they believed the word. They
[34:44] received the word. the Holy Spirit came
[34:47] down and they were baptized with the
[34:50] Holy Spirit and then they were taken now
[34:53] into the water baptism.
[34:56] So now on the day of Pentecost,
[34:59] Peter gives a formula.
[35:02] Praise the name of our Lord.
[35:05] He gives a formula
[35:08] in the message this day is this
[35:09] scripture fulfilled
[35:14] and the doctor's prescription
[35:21] on how to receive the Holy Ghost
[35:25] is given to us by Dr. Simon Peter
[35:31] on the day of Pentecost.
[35:35] I will give you a prescription.
[35:41] Repent
[35:43] every one of you and be baptized in the
[35:47] name of Jesus Christ
[35:50] for the remission of sins.
[35:53] And you shall receive
[35:56] the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[35:59] for the prescription
[36:01] is to them that are far off,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; even as many as the Lord our God shall
[36:10] call.
[36:13] And brother Brandham says it is an
[36:15] eternal prescription.
[36:20] So now, have you received the Holy Ghost
[36:24] since you've believed?
[36:27] Paul was asking them I said we don't
[36:30] about the Holy Ghost
[36:33] about you can you also like apopos
[36:38] we also don't about the Holy Ghost
[36:42] for you you know about the Holy Ghost
[36:44] then the question is
[36:47] why haven't you received the Holy Ghost
[36:50] praise the name of the Lord now in the
[36:52] message questions and answers
[36:56] it says
[36:57] Now what is a birthight?
[37:04] &gt;&gt; It is the right.
[37:08] That is what I'm trying to tell you now.
[37:12] The Holy Spirit
[37:15] is your birthight.
[37:20] That is your birthright.
[37:24] That's your godgiven right.
[37:31] Praise the name of our Lord. So now if
[37:34] you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:36] as your personal savior,
[37:39] why don't you have the Holy Spirit?
[37:43] The problem could be with your heart.
[37:48] Then why don't you be serious about what
[37:50] you
[37:53] know giving yourself over to God
[37:57] so that he takes charge over your life.
[38:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't allow
[38:04] this kind of you know mind.
[38:09] The Holy Ghost is very difficult.
[38:14] No, the Holy Ghost is right here.
[38:17] Actually, the moment you hear the word
[38:20] of God,
[38:22] it is the Holy Spirit
[38:25] speaking to you.
[38:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Why would
[38:30] you think,
[38:32] "Oh, I don't know when I'll get the Holy
[38:34] Ghost."
[38:36] Because the Holy Ghost has already been
[38:40] given.
[38:42] And if the Holy Ghost has already been
[38:44] given,
[38:46] so what do you do? Paul didn't ask them,
[38:51] "Were you given the Holy Ghost?"
[38:54] But Paul was asking them, "Did you
[38:57] receive the Holy Ghost?"
[39:00] You see it? God has already given the
[39:03] Holy Ghost.
[39:05] So now the issue is,
[39:08] &gt;&gt; why don't you receive the Holy Ghost?
[39:11] If the Holy Ghost has already been
[39:12] given,
[39:15] the Holy Ghost has already been given on
[39:17] the day of Pentecost.
[39:21] So why don't you take the Holy Ghost
[39:24] in the message the feast of the
[39:26] trumpets?
[39:30] Brother Brandham says that the Holy
[39:33] Ghost
[39:35] has been bound for 2,000 years,
[39:41] not in heaven,
[39:43] but here on earth,
[39:48] people binding the Holy Spirit,
[39:53] not in heaven,
[39:56] but here on earth.
[39:59] And why how they bind the Holy Ghost?
[40:03] And you can also bind the Holy Spirit.
[40:09] Praise the name of our Lord. The message
[40:11] the feast of the trumpets.
[40:15] Brother Brandham says
[40:17] while this group down here
[40:21] has got to bound at River Ephesus
[40:30] and has been bound for 2,000 years
[40:36] and also
[40:38] that the church
[40:41] has bound the Holy Ghost.
[40:45] for nearly 2,000 years
[40:49] under the mad back there
[40:55] and under the church ages.
[40:59] He has been bound
[41:02] not at riverfr
[41:05] but at the doors of creeds and dogmas
[41:13] that the Holy Spirit
[41:16] cannot work in the church
[41:21] because of manmade systems.
[41:26] That's how people bind the Holy Ghost.
[41:30] Wrong understanding binds the Holy
[41:33] Wrong teachings bind the Holy Ghost.
[41:37] You know, wrong kind of issues, wrong a
[41:39] wrong life can bind the Holy Ghost.
[41:44] Praise the name of the Lord. So the Holy
[41:46] Ghost was released from heaven
[41:49] but the people bind the Holy Spirit.
[41:52] People resist the Holy Spirit.
[41:55] That's how you know Steven was telling
[41:58] Sanhadran council.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; You always resist the Holy Spirit.
[42:06] How would they were they resisting the
[42:08] Holy Spirit?
[42:10] By not obeying what the Holy Spirit was
[42:13] saying.
[42:15] Even us we can resist the Holy Spirit
[42:20] by not being obedient to the word of
[42:22] God.
[42:24] The denominations
[42:26] they have bound the Holy Ghost
[42:30] by introducing their creeds and doggy
[42:34] by introducing infant baptism of
[42:37] children.
[42:40] by introducing baptism in a trinity,
[42:44] by introducing wrong formula of baptism,
[42:50] by you know not telling people the
[42:51] truth.
[42:54] So they bind the Holy Spirit. They
[42:57] resist the Holy Spirit.
[43:00] So even us now also
[43:03] we can bind the Holy Spirit.
[43:07] We can resist the Holy Spirit.
[43:11] by not doing what the word of God tells
[43:14] us to do.
[43:17] Praise the name of our Lord.
[43:20] Now in the message, why are people so
[43:22] tossed
[43:24] about?
[43:28] Brother Brenham says, "But now to see
[43:32] this hungering for people
[43:39] and yet not able to reach it.
[43:49] And many of our teachers
[43:52] and schools
[43:54] have brought in much theology of telling
[43:57] the people
[44:08] telling the people,
[44:11] "Well,
[44:15] it's because you didn't shout.
[44:19] because you didn't speak in tongues
[44:23] or because you didn't have this kind of
[44:25] gift
[44:27] which I have nothing in part
[44:31] or say anything against such
[44:36] but altogether
[44:38] you find these people
[44:41] when they do shout
[44:44] or speak with tongues
[44:46] or some other emotion,
[44:50] they don't still seem to be the person
[44:53] they should be.
[44:58] We know that to be the truth.
[45:01] And I've wondered myself
[45:04] just what could be done in that kind of
[45:07] state of mind for the person
[45:12] finding so finding it so simple in the
[45:15] word of God.
[45:18] We are trying to explain it.
[45:22] And in order now to do this
[45:25] after seeing the intellectual part of
[45:27] the mind and the soul
[45:31] [Music]
[45:33] which is in the heart.
[45:36] Now you'll truly find two different
[45:38] mental faculties.
[45:46] One of them is in your your head by your
[45:50] brain
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and the other is operated in the heart
[45:57] &gt;&gt; which is called your soul.
[46:01] Now you are very much in this agreement
[46:03] many times.
[46:06] Now, brother Brham is saying here
[46:09] because of so many schools of theology,
[46:15] one can tell you
[46:18] that if you don't speak in tongues,
[46:21] you're not going to get baptism of the
[46:22] Holy Ghost or you have not got the
[46:24] Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Then another
[46:26] says, if you don't shout,
[46:30] you have not got the Holy Ghost. If you
[46:32] don't feel an emotion,
[46:35] you've not got the Holy Ghost. And then
[46:37] people follow that
[46:40] and at the end of the day there is
[46:41] nothing.
[46:43] And now they get that
[46:45] and say now I've got the Holy Ghost
[46:49] and then you follow later.
[46:53] There's no Holy Spirit in that thing.
[46:58] So people just take some kind of thought
[47:02] or understanding
[47:05] or what they have been taught.
[47:08] So the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[47:12] and yet it is not.
[47:15] But yet it is simple
[47:17] to receive the baptism of the Holy
[47:19] Spirit.
[47:21] Praise the name of our Lord. It's not
[47:23] difficult.
[47:25] Just check your heart condition.
[47:31] Praise the name of the Lord. Just check
[47:33] your heart condition.
[47:36] You know there's somebody who was
[47:37] testifying
[47:39] and I went to the mountain
[47:41] and then I was there. Is it how many
[47:43] days?
[47:45] And then something happened I didn't
[47:46] know
[47:49] when I went and told a certain minister
[47:52] that was the holy
[47:56] and says, "Have the Holy Spirit,
[47:59] but then you followed the life,
[48:02] it doesn't match with what he's telling
[48:04] you.
[48:16] I was in church and then this kind of
[48:19] thing happened
[48:21] and I got the Holy Spirit
[48:26] you know because there is a way they can
[48:27] explain
[48:30] and then when he went home or she went
[48:33] home
[48:35] the following time to come to church
[48:40] I don't need to come to church
[48:43] because I received the Holy Spirit
[48:46] contrary,
[48:47] but they are pointing people to the
[48:49] things that are not genuine
[48:54] instead of pointing the people
[48:57] to the person of Christ himself
[49:02] when you have Christ in you,
[49:05] he will not leave you. That's what he
[49:07] said. I will not leave you comfortless.
[49:12] So even when you at your place of work,
[49:16] you will live the life of Jesus Christ.
[49:19] When you at your home, you live the life
[49:22] of Jesus Christ. When you meet any
[49:24] stranger,
[49:26] you will live the life of Jesus Christ.
[49:29] When you meet your enemy,
[49:31] you will meet the life of you will live
[49:33] the life of Jesus Christ.
[49:36] It will not be something which is upside
[49:38] down.
[49:40] Dubious ways,
[49:43] bitterness,
[49:45] envy,
[49:47] malice that is not part of Christ.
[49:51] Praise the name of our Lord. So people
[49:54] are not being pointed to the right
[49:56] thing.
[49:59] Praise the name of our Lord. People are
[50:01] being pointed to Christ.
[50:05] And then there's just this message which
[50:06] I was I was reading in the course of the
[50:09] I just want to read it also.
[50:13] Praise the name of our Lord. There is a
[50:16] quote here.
[50:18] And then brother Brandham says,
[50:24] "I'm afraid today
[50:28] that too many of us
[50:31] are not getting people to Christ.
[50:37] We are getting them to a church,
[50:41] to a theory,
[50:45] but we must get them to Christ.
[50:49] He is the only one
[50:51] and the only one that has life.
[50:56] He that has the son of life.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And if the life of a man that is dead be
[51:03] projected in you,
[51:08] you will live the same life he lived.
[51:13] Praise the name of the Lord. If you say
[51:15] you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[51:19] then you have the life of Jesus Christ.
[51:23] And if you have the life of Jesus
[51:24] Christ,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; you will live like Jesus Christ.
[51:29] But if you find that you are living
[51:31] contrary to Jesus Christ,
[51:35] then you don't have the life of Jesus
[51:37] Christ.
[51:39] That's one of the things to prove.
[51:43] Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:45] So we need to see
[51:47] that we have a personal relationship
[51:53] with Christ himself.
[51:57] Brother Brham says in the message why
[52:00] are people so tossed about.
[52:04] He says yet men and women live a good
[52:08] life
[52:12] and love God by a mental conception.
[52:17] But the real hiding place is in the
[52:20] heart.
[52:23] Hide with Christ.
[52:26] And when Christ the Holy Spirit
[52:30] comes into your heart,
[52:33] he is in you
[52:36] with your temperament.
[52:39] [Music]
[52:42] He is living his own life
[52:47] through his own will through you.
[52:53] Praise the name of our Lord.
[52:55] You know, he lives in you.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; He lives his own life.
[53:04] Then he says,
[53:05] &gt;&gt; I know it sounds awful.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; It's right,
[53:11] &gt;&gt; so yielded you are
[53:14] that Christ speaks the kind of words he
[53:17] would speak.
[53:21] He thinks the kind of thoughts he would
[53:23] think.
[53:27] through you. He does the kind of works
[53:30] he would do through you.
[53:34] You are yielding and resting.
[53:39] Praise the name of the Lord. In other
[53:41] words, you you're not so troubled inside
[53:44] of you.
[53:46] You are alone.
[53:52] Praise the name of the Lord. A beautiful
[53:54] picture of a consecrated Christian
[54:00] yielded
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Christ
[54:04] working through.
[54:06] Paul said for me to live is Christ
[54:10] and to die is gain.
[54:14] Not me that liveth anymore,
[54:18] but Christ liveth in me.
[54:21] Christ living
[54:24] in the individual
[54:28] soul surrendered.
[54:31] Christ speaks through the lips
[54:37] and think through the mind,
[54:40] see through the eyes,
[54:43] act through the temperament.
[54:47] The thing of the world has passed away.
[54:51] How can it be anything?
[54:55] Sweet and pleasant all the time.
[55:00] Christ has got control.
[55:04] You see, that is what it is.
[55:08] It is Christ in you.
[55:11] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[55:14] life that we need to look for.
[55:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Christ
[55:19] living in me. When Paul saw Apollos and
[55:23] his friends,
[55:26] he realized these people lack the Holy
[55:28] Spirit.
[55:31] They don't have the life of Christ.
[55:34] Whatever they are doing, they're doing
[55:35] it intellectually.
[55:38] They doing it under their own ability.
[55:42] You know like in psychology,
[55:46] they can teach you that if a person
[55:49] annoys you,
[55:51] you keep come and go away
[55:55] and then try to distract your mind from
[55:57] that.
[56:00] And then then there are those people use
[56:02] psychology
[56:09] and then they they get a woman who
[56:11] complains whenever the husband is at
[56:13] home.
[56:18] They say when you see him coming
[56:21] take this medicine
[56:24] and then you you drink it but don't
[56:26] swallow it.
[56:29] Then you put it in the mouth. The
[56:32] husband has come. Swallowing is rough.
[56:37] And now for you, you can't speak because
[56:38] there's something holding your mouth.
[56:41] You can't swallow it. You can't spit it
[56:45] because it is medicine.
[56:47] Then they say when after some time when
[56:49] he has finished and he has he has maybe
[56:51] gone away from you,
[56:56] then you go and spit it.
[56:58] psychology.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; That's not how Christ operates.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; He's just lives within
[57:07] &gt;&gt; and he gives you self control.
[57:12] You know that kind of calmness that
[57:14] comes down
[57:18] when brother met that wild bull.
[57:23] He didn't have a gun,
[57:26] but the presence of God just took a hold
[57:28] of him
[57:31] and then the fear went away.
[57:34] That bull had been killing people who go
[57:36] through that place.
[57:40] The presence of God just came down and
[57:42] took over the condition.
[57:47] love for that enemy
[57:51] and it come down the station.
[57:54] That's how the life of Christ works in
[57:56] our lives.
[57:58] But even when you are faced with a
[58:00] challenge you don't understand
[58:05] Christ will come and stand with you in
[58:07] that challenge.
[58:10] Maybe you have gone to place you
[58:11] expecting something
[58:14] and then you find is totally opposite.
[58:19] You will not run mad.
[58:22] Praise the name of the Lord. Maybe you
[58:24] expected to fly high in in marks or
[58:27] something like that
[58:32] and then you fell.
[58:35] Christ holds you in that condition.
[58:38] He encourages you. He stabilizes you.
[58:43] Or maybe it's a situation of sorrow.
[58:48] He comes and holds you together.
[58:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Christ
[58:54] himself coming in your condition.
[58:58] Praise the name of our Lord. And we
[59:00] should desire that kind of life
[59:03] that it is Christ
[59:06] that lives in us.
[59:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[59:12] message, why are people so tossed about?
[59:16] He says the Christian rests that rests
[59:20] in that hope upon the stormy seas.
[59:29] Sure,
[59:35] storms rise,
[59:40] all kinds of trouble,
[59:44] but we are anchored.
[59:48] That's all.
[59:50] It will never sink.
[59:54] It can't sink.
[59:58] Christ is on the inside.
[1:00:01] Whether the things turn upside down,
[1:00:05] you're not going to run crazy.
[1:00:08] Why? There's something special God has
[1:00:10] put in your life.
[1:00:14] Then he says, "Now, I've noticed many
[1:00:16] Christians in my life
[1:00:20] to be up and down.
[1:00:24] I've wondered about that.
[1:00:27] And
[1:00:31] why are people so tossed about?
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; You find then
[1:00:39] people who seem to be very religious,
[1:00:44] seems to have a deep desire.
[1:00:49] Day they search
[1:00:52] and hunt
[1:00:54] and seek for God
[1:00:57] and never come to any settlement of any
[1:01:00] kind
[1:01:09] in any kind where they could ever be
[1:01:11] settled or anchored in Christ.
[1:01:16] And this I have learned being in
[1:01:18] experience
[1:01:22] that it is the people of intellectuals.
[1:01:28] Hey, they want you to explain
[1:01:30] everything.
[1:01:33] How did you feel?
[1:01:35] Did you feel some warmth there in the
[1:01:37] heart?
[1:01:39] Maybe you have not got it.
[1:01:42] Don't need to look at that.
[1:01:44] have a personal relationship.
[1:01:48] Brother, I felt so much here, this and
[1:01:51] this. And then now like this when they
[1:01:53] teaching people how to speak in tongues,
[1:01:56] speak this word. Speak fast, fast, fast,
[1:01:58] fast first fast first fast first fast
[1:01:58] first fast first fast first fast first
[1:01:58] fast first fast first fast first fast.
[1:02:01] But the Bible says
[1:02:04] nobody was there to teach them the
[1:02:05] tongues.
[1:02:07] The scripture says when the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] came down,
[1:02:12] the spirit gave them
[1:02:16] genuine tongues.
[1:02:19] Not a makeup.
[1:02:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Not a
[1:02:25] makeup
[1:02:28] to know that I've also got it.
[1:02:31] You don't need to do that. It's by your
[1:02:34] life that people will prove whether you
[1:02:35] have it or not.
[1:02:39] Praise the name of the Lord. Then he
[1:02:41] says now speaking this
[1:02:45] is two different types of Christian
[1:02:47] Christianities.
[1:02:50] Okay. He says but I would not say two
[1:02:53] different types.
[1:02:56] I said two different phases would be
[1:02:58] better word to use.
[1:03:02] One of them is in an intellectual or
[1:03:05] mental conception of God.
[1:03:11] What God has said in his word
[1:03:16] of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge
[1:03:21] and the other is an experimental
[1:03:23] experience that God has given this man
[1:03:25] in his heart.
[1:03:32] The intellectual is hungering
[1:03:37] feisting on God,
[1:03:42] but his fist doesn't hold.
[1:03:47] The other one seems to have victory all
[1:03:50] the time.
[1:03:54] There's nothing bothers them.
[1:03:57] They are just solid
[1:04:01] anchored as they can be.
[1:04:05] No trials,
[1:04:10] no storms bother them at all.
[1:04:20] No trials will be there.
[1:04:22] Problems will be there. Praise the name
[1:04:25] of our Lord.
[1:04:26] because this one is anchored.
[1:04:31] But they seem to have something about
[1:04:33] them
[1:04:36] that people who are Christians
[1:04:39] who are trying to live for God
[1:04:44] that type of Christian.
[1:04:49] Praise the name of our Lord. Be that
[1:04:51] kind of person
[1:04:54] in your neighborhood.
[1:04:59] You know, let them see there's something
[1:05:01] special about you.
[1:05:04] Praise the name of the Lord. Moved by
[1:05:07] circumstances.
[1:05:14] Oh, the conditions are hard. I can't
[1:05:16] come to church.
[1:05:20] Even in the midst of many hardships,
[1:05:23] you are right there faithful.
[1:05:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Not to and
[1:05:30] fro.
[1:05:32] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:05:35] So now the Holy Spirit,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; the Bible says in Acts 5:32,
[1:05:47] "And we are his witnesses of these
[1:05:50] things, and so is the Holy Ghost, whom
[1:05:53] God has given to them that obey him."
[1:06:04] So he says the Holy Ghost
[1:06:07] is given to those who obey God.
[1:06:13] That's all that you need to do.
[1:06:16] Be obedient to the word of God. And then
[1:06:19] the Holy Spirit will come.
[1:06:23] It's not anything complicated.
[1:06:27] Oh, now I don't know if God will ever
[1:06:29] give me the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:33] The Bible says the promise
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; is unto you
[1:06:40] and your children
[1:06:43] and as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:06:45] call.
[1:06:48] So you can ask yourself
[1:06:51] did I come here by myself or God called
[1:06:53] me
[1:06:57] if you called yourself then there is
[1:06:59] nothing for you
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; but if you know that it's God who called
[1:07:03] you
[1:07:06] the Bible says the promise is unto you
[1:07:11] and he has already given the Holy
[1:07:12] Spirit.
[1:07:14] So what you need to do receive what he
[1:07:17] has already given.
[1:07:19] Praise the name of our Lord. You can
[1:07:21] receive the Holy Ghost here at church.
[1:07:25] You can receive the Holy Ghost right at
[1:07:26] your home.
[1:07:29] Anywhere you can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:07:32] as long as your heart is right before
[1:07:34] God.
[1:07:37] So you need to see that you consecrate
[1:07:41] yourself before God.
[1:07:47] Praise the name of our Lord. Have time
[1:07:50] you closely
[1:07:53] have time for the Lord.
[1:07:56] You know the way you consecrate on
[1:07:58] something.
[1:08:02] Praise the name of the Lord. Like I can
[1:08:04] give some examples.
[1:08:07] Praise the name of the Lord. When your
[1:08:09] heart is in something,
[1:08:13] maybe at your places of work,
[1:08:16] Maybe it may be your businesses.
[1:08:19] You know, you have a lot of burden on
[1:08:21] your heart to go and work that day.
[1:08:26] You have somebody coming at 6.
[1:08:29] Even when you sleep, your sleep is not
[1:08:31] enough.
[1:08:34] You wake up even before time. Many times
[1:08:38] and you try to look at the watch,
[1:08:41] but it's still duct dangerous now.
[1:08:44] But your mind is on what you're going to
[1:08:46] do
[1:08:48] and then now you go what you're going to
[1:08:50] do.
[1:08:52] Sometimes you have forgotten taking tea
[1:08:56] and you start working in your things
[1:08:58] you're doing.
[1:09:01] And as you keep yourself busy,
[1:09:04] you not even think about that you never
[1:09:06] ate food.
[1:09:09] You just realize you're becoming weak.
[1:09:13] Then you start but why why am I becoming
[1:09:15] weak you look at the time maybe it is
[1:09:19] five
[1:09:22] say hey the day is almost gone then it
[1:09:26] comes to your mind I've not taken tea
[1:09:29] not eaten anything
[1:09:32] because your heart is in that thing
[1:09:37] praise the name of our lord happen in
[1:09:39] our lives every other
[1:09:42] like when you're doing some assignment
[1:09:46] something ahead of you you want to
[1:09:48] accomplish
[1:09:51] you are concentrating
[1:09:53] all your mind even some noises which can
[1:09:57] happen you are not so much bothered
[1:09:59] about it
[1:10:01] you are just focused on something
[1:10:06] praise the name of the Lord your heart
[1:10:08] is sold into that thing you're
[1:10:11] That is the same thing with the Lord.
[1:10:14] When you fast,
[1:10:17] you're not going to be troubled about
[1:10:18] hunger
[1:10:20] if you are really fasting because your
[1:10:23] mind is on God.
[1:10:25] But now the moment food comes about in
[1:10:27] your mind
[1:10:30] then you know the fasting is over.
[1:10:35] Praise the name of our Lord. Just know
[1:10:37] the fasting is over.
[1:10:41] Bible says Jesus when he had fasted
[1:10:46] afterwards he hungered.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; So when the hunger comes
[1:10:52] that's the time to go and eat.
[1:10:55] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:11:01] I have to complete the days I I I
[1:11:03] pledged. But you see the the mind has
[1:11:06] already left the things of God.
[1:11:12] You already on something different.
[1:11:15] When Peter hungered
[1:11:18] then the Lord told him eat.
[1:11:22] Praise the name of Lord. Brother Brham
[1:11:25] says
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; in the message
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; they intervail.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Christianity is not something.
[1:11:38] God is not one you have to beg and cry
[1:11:41] and plead.
[1:11:51] He's going to look at me that I'm
[1:12:02] outside. God has not given me the Holy
[1:12:03] Ghost. It's not like that. It's your
[1:12:06] heart condition.
[1:12:09] Starve yourself
[1:12:11] and everything like that to get to
[1:12:17] certainly not.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not dis I'm not degrading a fast.
[1:12:26] But here not long ago
[1:12:29] a man wrote a book on fasting.
[1:12:36] Women come in the meeting
[1:12:39] and men who went out to those fast that
[1:12:43] were insane.
[1:12:49] They went just because the book said
[1:12:52] fast 40 days.
[1:12:56] Some of them with false plates
[1:13:00] and their teeth would drop out
[1:13:06] and their eyes would sink back
[1:13:11] and mothers to be women to be mothers.
[1:13:15] Their little ones as you understand
[1:13:19] You don't completely go mentally out
[1:13:25] and be taken to the institutions.
[1:13:34] Many of them come in that condition.
[1:13:37] I believe in fasting
[1:13:40] certainly. But when you fast,
[1:13:44] you don't hunger.
[1:13:47] Jesus after he had gone through fasting.
[1:13:52] The Bible said, he was hungry.
[1:13:55] God puts a fast on you.
[1:13:59] You don't put it on yourself.
[1:14:03] He certainly captured the woman.
[1:14:09] The man that wrote that book
[1:14:12] when he said put a picture of a woman
[1:14:15] there
[1:14:20] look 20 years younger
[1:14:23] and said after you that fast
[1:14:27] you ought to see her then just about a
[1:14:31] year later that she looked like after
[1:14:33] that
[1:14:36] you don't do that. You don't do things
[1:14:40] by works.
[1:14:44] It is by grace.
[1:14:47] God is sovereign grace.
[1:14:51] Praise the name of our Lord. So make
[1:14:55] sure that your heart is right before
[1:14:57] God.
[1:14:59] Peter told them, "Repent, be baptized in
[1:15:03] the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:15:06] you shall receive the gift of the Holy."
[1:15:08] And he says, "The promise is unto you."
[1:15:12] So you take it as God's promise.
[1:15:17] Lord, I'm here to receive the promise.
[1:15:21] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[1:15:23] message, the Holy Ghost is the message
[1:15:26] possessing the enemy's gates.
[1:15:31] He says,
[1:15:36] "I don't know, but I'm persuaded
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:41] to believe that Joshua
[1:15:44] was a little bit,
[1:15:47] just a little bit tiny fellow.
[1:15:50] I can see jump on a box.
[1:15:55] Men and brethren,
[1:15:59] two million people,
[1:16:02] we are more than able to take them.
[1:16:07] See why there was a seed of Abraham.
[1:16:13] God gave the promise.
[1:16:16] That was their possession.
[1:16:21] God gave the promise.
[1:16:24] Don't matter what the opposition was
[1:16:30] the true seed of Abraham
[1:16:34] said we can take it
[1:16:38] because gave it to us.
[1:16:40] When they were going to the promised
[1:16:42] land
[1:16:44] you know 12 spies were sent.
[1:16:48] Now when the others saw the sons of Anch
[1:16:50] were giants,
[1:16:54] the land was grown with milk and honey.
[1:16:58] Then they came back to the camp of the
[1:16:59] Israelites.
[1:17:02] Ah, the land is there,
[1:17:04] but we can never take it.
[1:17:07] We are like grasshoppers.
[1:17:10] Those are giants.
[1:17:13] We better go back to Egypt.
[1:17:16] And that's what the devil wants to tell
[1:17:18] us.
[1:17:22] You mean getting the Holy Ghost?
[1:17:24] My friend is not.
[1:17:28] Do you know how he suffered to get the
[1:17:29] Holy Ghost?
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Then why did Christ suffer on the cross?
[1:17:34] Praise the name of the Lord. People take
[1:17:36] that mind
[1:17:39] until one was saying,
[1:17:41] you know,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; if you don't make it in the rapture,
[1:17:47] When you don't have the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:50] you become the foolish virgin.
[1:17:53] The message is not for foolish virgin.
[1:17:56] This message is for the bride of Jesus.
[1:18:00] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:18:02] Oil here,
[1:18:05] freely given
[1:18:08] why don't you receive the oil in your
[1:18:09] life?
[1:18:11] Why don't you receive oil in your
[1:18:13] vessel?
[1:18:15] the life of Jesus Christ himself,
[1:18:18] you know. So they were telling the the
[1:18:20] Jews,
[1:18:22] they cannot take the land, it is
[1:18:24] difficult,
[1:18:26] oh no, we are going to perish here in
[1:18:28] the wilderness
[1:18:30] when we go there.
[1:18:31] going to kill us.
[1:18:34] And brother is saying Joshua was saying,
[1:18:38] we are more than able
[1:18:42] not looking at your ability
[1:18:45] at the promise of God.
[1:18:47] I give you the land. Praise the name of
[1:18:50] our Lord. So he gives us the Holy
[1:18:52] Spirit. So what do I do? I receive you
[1:18:56] the Holy Spirit.
[1:18:58] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:19:01] says
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; there are there you are standing this
[1:19:06] morning
[1:19:08] there stands the church of the living
[1:19:10] God.
[1:19:13] I don't care what anyone else says,
[1:19:18] whatever the doctor says,
[1:19:21] anything, what the unbeliever says,
[1:19:26] you know, we are more than a match for
[1:19:29] anything.
[1:19:32] We are Abraham's seed
[1:19:35] and we shall possess the gate of our
[1:19:37] enemy.
[1:19:40] No matter what the enemy is,
[1:19:44] God gave the promise
[1:19:47] that was theirs,
[1:19:50] their possession.
[1:19:52] Healing is your possession.
[1:19:56] Salvation is your possession.
[1:20:01] The Holy Ghost is your possession.
[1:20:05] And there is great thousands of
[1:20:06] preachers and so forth in the land today
[1:20:08] that say it is not so.
[1:20:15] But the seed of Abraham
[1:20:18] knows it is so.
[1:20:21] They went right in and possessed the
[1:20:23] gates of the enemy.
[1:20:28] They said they would
[1:20:30] believe it because it is the promise.
[1:20:34] This seed shall possess the gates of the
[1:20:36] enemy.
[1:20:40] Now you go through the testing trials
[1:20:44] and Joshua stood they are royal.
[1:20:50] The little fellow said
[1:20:53] I don't care how big they are.
[1:20:56] I don't care what kind of spear they
[1:20:58] got,
[1:21:01] how high their cities is world,
[1:21:05] how great it is. Our promise is
[1:21:11] that the gate will be possessed by the
[1:21:13] seed of our
[1:21:16] we are going over to take them.
[1:21:19] We are more than a match for them.
[1:21:23] And that is the true sin.
[1:21:26] Praise the name of our Lord. That should
[1:21:28] be your confession.
[1:21:31] The Holy Ghost is mine.
[1:21:36] I don't know whether the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:38] maybe it is for dear brother
[1:21:41] but me I don't know
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; take it
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; possess it
[1:21:47] desire
[1:21:49] Lord I'm here
[1:21:51] filled with your Holy Spirit Lord I'm
[1:21:54] here to be changed
[1:21:57] the name of our Lord and when they were
[1:21:59] ready to possess the land
[1:22:02] do you know what happened.
[1:22:04] They never had missiles.
[1:22:08] They never had those missiles.
[1:22:10] They only had to follow God's
[1:22:13] instruction.
[1:22:17] God told them, clean up yourselves,
[1:22:21] sanctify,
[1:22:23] separate from evil things,
[1:22:26] separate from things that may water down
[1:22:29] your face.
[1:22:32] dying to yourself.
[1:22:35] Then they cross Jordan,
[1:22:38] dying to the things of the world,
[1:22:41] dying to the things that are contrary to
[1:22:43] the word of God.
[1:22:46] He told Joshua,
[1:22:49] walk around the city
[1:22:52] seven days.
[1:22:54] So every day they were walking around.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Every day
[1:23:00] they were walking around. And then on
[1:23:02] the seventh day, sold them seven times.
[1:23:07] And now when you finish,
[1:23:11] what do you do? Blow a trumpet.
[1:23:16] Praise the name of the Lord. Blow the
[1:23:18] trumpet.
[1:23:20] And then what happened? The city
[1:23:22] collapsed.
[1:23:25] They never had missiles to blow it up.
[1:23:29] It was financially done by obeying the
[1:23:32] word of God.
[1:23:35] And that's the same baptism of the Holy
[1:23:37] Spirit.
[1:23:39] Cornelius just obeyed the angel's voice.
[1:23:44] The angel told him, send for somebody to
[1:23:48] go and pick Peter.
[1:23:51] And then now Cornelius got faithful men.
[1:23:56] And then he told them, "Go to this place
[1:24:00] on the seashore
[1:24:03] and then ask for the house of Simon the
[1:24:05] Turner."
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And then you'll find a man called Simon
[1:24:10] Peter.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:24:16] He went and told the friends
[1:24:20] and then his relatives
[1:24:22] and said, "I've had a vision."
[1:24:26] Now,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; don't first look for a vision to say
[1:24:28] that now you're going to get the Holy
[1:24:30] Ghost.
[1:24:38] You don't need that.
[1:24:40] We have a sure word of prayer.
[1:24:44] Whosoever will
[1:24:46] come to the waters.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; The promise is unto you. You don't need
[1:24:53] a vision to prove whether you're going
[1:24:54] to get the Holy Ghost or not.
[1:24:58] A sure word of prophecy.
[1:25:02] The Holy Ghost is mine.
[1:25:05] Praise the name of the Lord. So now when
[1:25:08] Cornelius did that
[1:25:10] and when those reached Peter's house,
[1:25:14] It was around that time
[1:25:17] and then Peter had also gone to pray.
[1:25:21] You see how the Lord works
[1:25:24] a prayer upon Peter's heart
[1:25:28] upon Peter's heart and Peter was praying
[1:25:33] and then afterwards he became hungry
[1:25:37] and then he going into a vision
[1:25:40] and then things came from heaven on
[1:25:42] sheet
[1:25:44] and there were unclean animals.
[1:25:47] voice from heaven said,
[1:25:50] "Flay and eat."
[1:25:53] The first time it came, the second time,
[1:25:56] the third and Peter was telling the
[1:25:58] Lord, "I've never eaten anything
[1:26:01] unclean."
[1:26:03] And then the vision went away. And then
[1:26:06] Peter started wondering.
[1:26:09] God told him, "What God has made clean,
[1:26:14] don't call unclean.
[1:26:17] And then he was wondering, doubting
[1:26:18] within himself.
[1:26:22] And then the men had reached the gate
[1:26:23] and they were knocking.
[1:26:26] But the Holy Ghost told him, "I've sent
[1:26:29] men to you.
[1:26:31] Go with them. Don't doubt anything.
[1:26:36] God working out.
[1:26:39] Praise the name of our Lord." And now
[1:26:41] they stayed overnight.
[1:26:43] The following day they went
[1:26:46] Peter went with some Jews there
[1:26:49] going to this meeting to meet these
[1:26:51] people's
[1:26:54] house
[1:26:57] was bowing down to him he said don't bow
[1:27:00] down to
[1:27:02] started asking him
[1:27:05] why have you called for me praise the
[1:27:07] name of our lord started explaining
[1:27:11] okay one thing I Oh
[1:27:14] is no respect of person.
[1:27:16] Whosoever fe does this
[1:27:20] and he started preaching Christ
[1:27:23] the word the sacrifice. And then the
[1:27:26] Bible says while Peter yet spoke this
[1:27:32] what happened? Their hearts were right.
[1:27:36] Their hearts were ready.
[1:27:38] So the Holy Ghost just came down.
[1:27:42] What science was there?
[1:27:45] How many years did they take to get
[1:27:46] there
[1:27:49] condition?
[1:27:51] Praise the name of Lord. Apollos do know
[1:27:55] about the Holy Spirit for you. You know
[1:27:58] about the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:00] You just need to have faith
[1:28:03] in the promise of God. You said, "Lord,
[1:28:06] the Holy Spirit is mine."
[1:28:09] And so you've come and received the Holy
[1:28:11] Spirit.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:29:04] since you believed?
[1:29:07] When you're looking for the bom of the

[1:38:38] Oh, you can now speak to the Lord.
[1:38:41] Father, how we thank thee, Father. How
[1:38:43] we glorify your name. We thank you,
[1:38:47] Father, for the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:49] Spirit and fire. How you've brought us
[1:38:52] out, Lord. How you've redeemed us, Lord.
[1:38:56] How you've saved us, heavenly father,
[1:38:58] and given unto us your spirit, Lord. Not
[1:39:02] of any merit, Lord. Not of anything good
[1:39:05] we have done, but by your grace,
[1:39:08] heavenly father, that you give us thy
[1:39:10] spirit, Lord. And how can just there
[1:39:14] maybe didn't know anything but Lord your
[1:39:16] spirit just came down because he
[1:39:19] recognized the sacrifice and he had the
[1:39:21] word of God about the washing of sins
[1:39:24] and everything and the Holy Spirit came
[1:39:27] and took over all their lives and you
[1:39:29] are the same Lord yesterday, today and
[1:39:32] forever. Lord, now so many times we've
[1:39:35] heard about the Holy Spirit. We pray in
[1:39:37] the name of Jesus Christ that that same
[1:39:40] spirit, Lord, that we've been hearing
[1:39:42] about may himself come down and fill all
[1:39:45] our hearts with the father that each and
[1:39:48] every one of us, oh God, may be made a
[1:39:51] new creation, new in Christ, Lord, no
[1:39:55] longer ourselves living, Lord, but Lord,
[1:39:58] you alone living in us, Lord. I pray may
[1:40:01] help every one of us in the name of
[1:40:03] Jesus Christ. Lord be filled with your
[1:40:06] Holy Spirit Lord. Lord to have the life
[1:40:08] of Christ living in us Lord. No more our
[1:40:11] self living Lord. No more our desires
[1:40:14] Lord. No more our mind Lord. No more our
[1:40:17] intent Lord but Christ living in us. Oh
[1:40:22] God how we sanctify.
[1:40:25] Oh God how we glorify your name. Oh God,

[1:40:48] heavenly father. Transform us heavenly
[1:40:51] father. And the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:53] may come down in our lives. And how you
[1:40:56] said, Father, you keep us by your power,
[1:40:58] Lord. You fill us with your spirit,
[1:41:01] Lord. You told them to wait in the
[1:41:04] Jerusalem, Lord. And they did wait and
[1:41:07] the Holy Spirit himself come down. And
[1:41:10] how you came, heavenly father, and
[1:41:12] anointed each of them. You filled each
[1:41:15] and every one of them. You were right in
[1:41:17] that place, Lord. Even in Cornelius's
[1:41:19] house, you came and filled each and
[1:41:21] every one of them. God, it was all about
[1:41:24] the heart being right. Oh God, and just
[1:41:26] remembering Simon the sorcerer, how he
[1:41:29] wanted to buy the Holy Ghost by money.
[1:41:31] He thought there was an extra thing I
[1:41:33] need to do. Oh God, but still Lord, you
[1:41:36] are the same. Oh heavenly father, how we
[1:41:39] thank thee Lord for the portion of the
[1:41:42] Holy Spirit that you give unto us Lord
[1:41:45] to be your children Lord to be like our
[1:41:47] Lord Jesus Christ. So help every one of
[1:41:50] us now in the name of Jesus Christ. All
[1:41:53] your children in the name of Jesus to be
[1:41:55] filled Lord that no longer are we living
[1:41:58] but you living in us. How we thank the
[1:42:01] father. How we glorify holy name. How we
[1:42:04] magnify holy name. You are great Lord.
[1:42:07] You are awesome Lord. You change not
[1:42:10] heavenly father. You f heavenly father.
