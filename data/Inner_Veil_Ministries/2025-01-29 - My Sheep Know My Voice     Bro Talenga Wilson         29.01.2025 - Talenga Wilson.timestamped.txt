[12:40] Bibles and open the Book of John chapter
[12:45] 10 we shall read verse
[12:50] 11 up to around verse
[12:53] 24
[12:56] amen and the Bible says
[13:00] I am the Good
[13:03] Shepherd the Good Shepherd gives his
[13:06] life for the
[13:10] ship amen and it says but he that is UN
[13:17] haing and not the shepherd who own the
[13:20] Sheep are not sees the wolf coming and

[13:26] catches them and Scatter the Sheep
[13:51] theing flee because he is not he is UNH
[13:54] Haring and care not for the Sheep
[14:03] I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep
[14:14] andn and as the father knoweth knoweth
[14:17] me even so know I the father and I lay
[14:20] down my life for the Sheep
[14:30] and other sheep I have which are not of
[14:33] this fold them also I must bring and
[14:37] they shall hear my voice and there shall
[14:41] be one fold and one she Shepherd
[15:02] therefore do my father love me because I
[15:04] lay down my life that I may take it
[15:14] again no man Tes takes it from me but I
[15:18] lay it down of myself I have power to
[15:21] lay it down and I have power to take it
[15:24] again this commandment have I received
[15:26] of of my father
[15:48] amen may the Lord bless his word we may
[15:50] get
[15:52] seated amen amen so I want to speak on
[15:56] my sheep know my voice
[16:04] my sheep know my
[16:09] voice and when I
[16:12] speak they
[16:13] hear and they
[16:16] recognize that this is the voice of the
[16:20] shepherd praise the Lord and Jesus
[16:23] himself
[16:24] said I am the Good
[16:27] Shepherd praise the Lord I know my
[16:31] sheep and they are known of
[16:34] me praise the Lord and now as he was
[16:37] speaking this verse 19
[16:40] says there was a division therefore
[16:43] among again among the Jews for these
[16:51] says and of them
[16:53] said he has a devil and is mad why he
[17:05] others said this are not the words of
[17:08] him that has a devil can a devil Open
[17:11] the Eyes of the
[17:21] blind was a division amongest
[17:24] them the was that he spoke to them when
[17:28] he was teaching them praise the Lord he
[17:31] says I am the
[17:33] shepherd and then he led
[17:37] his to the sheep and says they are
[17:41] sheep and because they are sheep they
[17:44] are known of
[17:45] me and I know them praise the Lord and
[17:50] says I keep the
[17:51] flock all of them in my
[17:54] FL and then it says in verse 22
[17:59] and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the
[18:01] dedication and it was Winter and Jesus
[18:04] walked in the temple in Solomon's
[18:17] por then came the Jews around about him
[18:19] and said unto him how long do thou make
[18:22] us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell
[18:25] us plainly
[18:37] Jesus answered them I told you and you
[18:39] believed not the works that I do in my
[18:42] father's name they bear witness
[18:54] of but you believe not because you are
[18:57] not of my sheep as I said unto
[19:04] you and then he
[19:07] says my sheep hear my
[19:14] voice those that were
[19:17] his when he spoke they were able to
[19:21] know that he is the
[19:24] Shepherd that he is the Christ and they
[19:27] had no doubt in their heart
[19:30] the Lord that's why when there was a
[19:37] cont some of them called him a
[19:40] devil there were certain of those that
[19:43] rose up and
[19:45] said for sure he cannot be a
[19:48] devil because the devil cannot open eyes
[19:52] of the blind
[19:55] man they recognize their Shepherd
[19:59] and Jesus comes down in 27 and says my
[20:02] sheep know my hear my
[20:06] voice and I know
[20:09] them because when I
[20:11] speak they follow me praise the Lord
[20:15] when I speak they hear the voice and
[20:19] they are able to know that that is the
[20:21] master then they come and follow me and
[20:26] I give unto them eternal life
[20:31] and they shall never
[20:34] perish neither shall any man PL them out
[20:37] of my
[20:40] hand praise the Lord my sheep know my
[20:44] voice I know them and they know me
[20:49] that's what he said says when I call
[20:52] them they hear and they don't hear and
[20:56] remain
[20:57] there when they hear the voice they come
[21:01] towards the
[21:03] shepherd praise the Lord they come
[21:05] towards
[21:06] me praise the
[21:09] Lord I am the good
[21:12] shepher praise the Lord now A Good
[21:15] Shepherd takes care of his
[21:18] flock he does not allow strangers
[21:21] in neither does he let wild animals come
[21:26] in but a good shepherd
[21:29] he's the one that keeps his
[21:31] flock and therefore he can lay his life
[21:34] for the
[21:37] flock and that's what Jesus said he says
[21:40] I a good shepherd because I can lay my
[21:44] life for the
[21:45] sh I can lay my life for
[21:49] them praise the Lord for their
[21:52] sake I have the power to take it back
[21:56] again praise the Lord says I am a good
[22:01] shepherd Jesus Is a Good
[22:03] Shepherd praise the Lord because he said
[22:06] he can lay his
[22:07] life indeed because he's a good
[22:10] shepher he laid his
[22:13] life for us the
[22:15] Sheep praise the Lord he laid his life
[22:19] for us to be safe he laid his life for
[22:24] our
[22:24] Salvation praise the Lord he laid his
[22:27] life so we could be reconciled back to
[22:31] him praise the Lord and so he says now
[22:34] when I speak
[22:35] out my sheep because they are a sheep
[22:41] they have the nature of a
[22:43] sheep they are
[22:45] obedient praise the Lord because they
[22:48] know I am the
[22:53] shepherd when I speak they hear praise
[22:58] the Lord and when I call they come and
[23:02] they follow me my sheep know my
[23:06] voice praise the Lord he says I can lay
[23:09] my life for them and then I can pick it
[23:13] again praise the Lord so now God
[23:15] thinking about
[23:17] us how Satan will divert
[23:20] us from the original plan of
[23:23] God he laid his life for
[23:26] us that we may be called back to his
[23:31] flock praise the Lord because you
[23:34] believe that you were a part of him you
[23:38] were a part of his flock praise the Lord
[23:41] And now when Satan came heed us from the
[23:46] original plan of
[23:48] God and when we we got born to the world
[23:52] we got lost praise the Lord and forgot
[23:55] all that we wear and forgot all that we
[23:59] were we forgot who we were but now when
[24:03] Jesus comes praise the Lord he lays down
[24:07] his
[24:08] life he lays down his life for
[24:11] us as a
[24:13] sacrifice praise the Lord such that we
[24:16] can be reconciled back to
[24:19] God and get back to the
[24:21] flock praise the Lord so now because he
[24:25] said I can lay down my life for this
[24:29] that makes him the
[24:32] sacrifice for his flock so he became a
[24:36] sacrifice our FL and he is still the
[24:41] sacrifice for his flock so he does not
[24:45] allow any strangers
[24:48] in he does not allow any wild beast to
[24:52] come
[24:53] in he is very
[24:56] protective of his flock
[24:58] praise the Lord but then when he
[25:02] speaks this flock every sheep in the
[25:06] flock must be able to recognize the
[25:10] voice of the
[25:12] shepherd praise the Lord and when they
[25:15] recognize the voice of the
[25:16] shepherd you must move right to the
[25:20] shepherd praise the Lord because if you
[25:23] don't move towards the voice you shall
[25:26] not be safe
[25:28] why he says certain of them are not in
[25:31] The
[25:34] Fault praise the Lord but he said but
[25:37] when I call them they shall hear the
[25:40] voice then they shall come in and then
[25:43] it shall be
[25:45] onefold praise the Lord so when you hear
[25:47] the voice of God you don't remain there
[25:51] but you have to move towards the
[25:53] voice because that's where there is
[25:56] security
[25:59] praise the Lord my sheep know my
[26:02] voice so we can only be
[26:05] safe when we are in the
[26:08] flock because there is a sacrifice at
[26:11] the
[26:11] door the shepher
[26:14] himself laying down there for our
[26:18] protection praise the Lord so we are
[26:20] only safe when we are in the flock of
[26:23] the
[26:24] she praise the Lord and nothing can harm
[26:27] us
[26:29] praise the Lord nothing can harm
[26:32] us as the sacrifice lays
[26:36] there praise the Living God and he says
[26:39] when I
[26:40] speak the sheep hear the voice now the
[26:44] Sheep has a
[26:46] life praise the Lord the Sheep has a
[26:50] life and because the shepherd is in the
[26:54] door and who is the door and who is the
[26:57] shepherd
[26:59] Jesus Christ and he says when I
[27:01] speak so now when he speaks the Sheep is
[27:06] able to
[27:07] recognize or to hear the voice because
[27:11] there is a
[27:12] connection between the ship and the
[27:16] shepherd praise the Lord there is a
[27:19] nature that connects the ship and the
[27:23] shepherd praise the Lord so now the
[27:26] Sheep must have the
[27:29] life must have must bear the
[27:32] nature and likeness of the
[27:34] shepherd that's why when the shepherd
[27:37] calls you are able to hear the ship is
[27:41] able to hear because in the ship is a
[27:45] life that can recognize the voice of the
[27:48] shepher that's why when there are other
[27:51] animals and when the shepherd calls the
[27:54] other animals are not able to recogn
[27:59] that this is the voice of Our
[28:02] Shepherd because in them there is no
[28:05] life that is able to recognize the voice
[28:09] of the
[28:10] shepherd but he says I know mine I know
[28:14] my sheep and whoever the father has
[28:17] given
[28:18] me as a sheep I shall lose
[28:22] none when I call when I speak they shall
[28:26] come and they shall enter into the flock
[28:30] and then he says when they enter the
[28:32] flock then he comes upon the door and he
[28:36] lays his life at the
[28:38] door as a Good Shepherd protecting that
[28:43] which the father has given him and then
[28:46] he says as long as the father has given
[28:49] them and they in my FL I shall lose
[28:53] none praise the Lord so now he becomes
[28:56] our life
[28:58] the sacrifice of our life so as long as
[29:02] the shepherd is at the
[29:04] door taking charge of the
[29:07] flock we know that we are safe and we
[29:11] shall not get lost praise the Lord but
[29:14] there is only one
[29:16] thing only one thing we must be able to
[29:21] hear the voice recognize the voice obey
[29:25] the voice and follow the voice of
[29:29] the say that when he calls that there is
[29:33] danger we able to hear and run back to
[29:36] the flock because it's only in his
[29:39] flock that we are
[29:42] safe prise the Living God and says they
[29:46] hear my voice and when I call they shall
[29:49] come and follow me where he leads they
[29:54] follow praise the Lord being a sheep
[29:57] when I hear his voice when you hear his
[30:00] voice you follow him so where he leads
[30:03] you you will follow go with him and
[30:07] there is a songor that says I will go
[30:11] with him through the
[30:13] garden I'll go with him through sorrow
[30:17] through grief through judgment I go with
[30:21] him all the way because he is The
[30:25] Shepherd of my
[30:26] soul because I am
[30:29] sheep I will go wherever he
[30:32] leads praise the Lord I will go wherever
[30:35] he
[30:37] leads and each time he calls I will
[30:40] answer each time he calls I will hear
[30:42] and I will
[30:44] answer I will go wherever he leads
[30:48] me praise the Lord and now Jesus warns
[30:52] us of the end time
[30:56] confusion where many shall come in the
[30:59] flock where many shall come and he calls
[31:03] them
[31:05] wolves to try to divert the
[31:08] flock but as long as we have the voice
[31:11] of the
[31:13] Shepherd no matter how hard s
[31:18] tries as long as we are hearing the
[31:22] voice as long as we are following the
[31:26] voice praise the Lord
[31:28] as long as we are going by the voice of
[31:31] the
[31:32] shepherd we shall not get
[31:35] lost praise the Lord he says in the end
[31:38] times so many things shall happen and he
[31:42] says in Matthew chapter 24
[31:45] verse3 it says and as he sat upon the
[31:48] Mount of
[31:52] Olives as he sat upon the Mount of
[31:56] Olives the disciples came unto him
[31:58] privately
[32:03] saying tell us when shall these things
[32:07] be and what shall be the sign of thy
[32:11] coming and at the end of the
[32:14] world and at the end of the
[32:20] world and Jesus answered and said unto
[32:24] them take he that no man deceive
[32:29] you praise the Lord take he be
[32:34] careful that no man deceive you and says
[32:38] for many shall come in my
[32:41] [Music]
[32:45] name
[32:48] verse men shall come in my
[32:50] name I am the
[32:53] shepherd I am the Good
[32:56] Shepherd that takes care of the
[32:58] flock that lays my life down for the
[33:02] Sheep as a sacrifice for their
[33:06] safety says but in the early
[33:08] times take he that no man deceive
[33:12] you because so many shall
[33:15] come in my name saying I am the
[33:18] Christ I shall receive many and says
[33:22] many false prophets shall
[33:26] arise 11 and shall receive
[33:30] many and then says because iniquity
[33:32] shall
[33:34] abound the love of many shall work
[33:38] SC be careful because in the end
[33:42] times there are so many
[33:45] Shepherds that shall come praise the
[33:49] Lord but now he describes
[33:52] himself as the Good
[33:54] Shepherd many Shepherds will come praise
[33:58] the Lord that shall put on that
[34:01] image as Christ but he says be careful
[34:06] that they deceive you not because when
[34:09] they shall come they shall say we are
[34:11] the
[34:12] Christ the anointed ones and they shall
[34:16] receive many say there shall be so many
[34:19] false
[34:21] prophets so there be so many
[34:24] Devils shall come to the EV the ship
[34:28] shall come to scatter the sheep from the
[34:32] flock praise the Lord but he says be
[34:36] careful praise the Lord because when
[34:38] they come they shall be
[34:41] anointed he says they shall say we are
[34:43] the
[34:44] Christ that means they shall have the
[34:47] anointing the anointing to teach the
[34:51] anointing to do
[34:52] miracles do so many great things but
[34:55] says be careful
[34:58] that they do not deceive you praise the
[35:01] Lord because the Bible tells us that
[35:03] even Satan
[35:05] himself lufer himself he has the
[35:09] ability to
[35:11] condescend into the angel of
[35:15] Light that he presents
[35:18] himself as the angel of Light see so
[35:22] many praise the Lord and Jesus warned us
[35:26] so many of the things will happen in the
[35:30] end
[35:30] times but it says be careful that you
[35:34] are not deceived praise the Lord second
[35:38] Corinthians 11
[35:41] verse3 for as a for such a false
[35:47] Apostles he calls them false
[35:52] Apostles de sightful
[35:55] workers transforming themselves into the
[35:58] Apostles of
[36:01] Christ but no
[36:03] Marvel for Satan himself is transformed
[36:07] into an Ang of
[36:13] light praise the Lord with one reason
[36:17] with the purpose of the inverting the
[36:21] truth bringing doctrines of
[36:24] men and diverting people from the truth
[36:27] word of
[36:29] God theying people from following the
[36:33] voice of the
[36:35] shepherd but Jesus warns us and says he
[36:39] is the only good
[36:41] shepherd and only his
[36:44] voice must we hear and
[36:47] follow praise the Lord because where is
[36:50] he leading us he is leading us
[36:53] home where is he leading us he is
[36:56] leading us to himself
[36:58] he leads us with the word where the
[37:01] other false
[37:03] Apostles the other false
[37:06] prophets the false
[37:08] Christ the false
[37:10] Shepherds they lead us to man
[37:14] doctrines only the voice of the Good
[37:16] Shepherd Jesus
[37:18] Christ that leads us to the word and
[37:21] it's only in the word that we are
[37:24] S I am the Good Shepherd
[37:27] and all my
[37:29] sheep know my voice praise the Lord and
[37:33] when if they know my voice even in the
[37:36] end
[37:37] times there are so many voices that are
[37:40] coming on the
[37:42] scene to they the
[37:44] ship praise the Lord the ship that
[37:47] belongs to
[37:49] Christ Christ says as long as God has
[37:52] gotten
[37:53] you and brought you to him says will be
[37:58] faithful I am a very good shepherd and I
[38:01] will not lose you so even in the
[38:04] confusion of
[38:05] voices when there are so many voices of
[38:09] shepherds the sheep that God has called
[38:13] himself shall be in position to
[38:16] recognize only one voice the voice of
[38:19] the Good Shepherd the voice of the Lord
[38:21] Jesus Christ because my sheep know my
[38:25] voice and only his voice
[38:28] do they
[38:30] recognize are you able to recognize the
[38:32] the voice of the
[38:34] shepherd because there are so many
[38:36] christs there are so many false prophets
[38:39] there are so many teachers of the word
[38:42] praise the Lord but when you listen you
[38:45] are able to know that this is the voice
[38:48] of the Good
[38:50] Shepherd this is not the voice of the
[38:52] good shepher so you will not follow the
[38:56] voice of other Shepherds you shall only
[39:00] follow the voice of the good
[39:02] Shepherds my sheep know my
[39:05] voice and the prophet says the
[39:08] message communion
[39:11] 1962 now if you're are communing with
[39:15] God in taking the real
[39:20] communion because people take so many
[39:22] other
[39:24] communions but he says if you're
[39:26] communing with
[39:28] God in his word by taking the real
[39:34] communion the spirit is in the spirit in
[39:37] you disagrees with his
[39:41] word you are not communing with
[39:44] God you're communing with
[39:47] Devils praise the Lord if the spirit in
[39:51] you disagrees with the word of
[39:54] God and yet you confess
[39:58] that you are communing with
[40:00] God that you are following
[40:03] God the prophet says you are communing
[40:06] with
[40:07] Devils because so many Devils shall show
[40:09] up in the early
[40:12] times they shall teach people so many
[40:16] things praise the Lord but how are we
[40:18] able to identify them at the end they
[40:23] disagree with the word of
[40:25] God praise the Lord
[40:27] but the true spirit of
[40:29] God is in agreement with every word of
[40:34] God prise lord so he says you are
[40:36] communing with other
[40:38] Devils they are so
[40:41] impersonating and the B said in the last
[40:46] days they would almost deceive the very
[40:49] elected if
[40:52] possible the Paul teaches us where we've
[40:56] read in in in 2 Corinthians chapter
[41:00] 11 Satan
[41:02] himself became the angel of
[41:06] Light Satan himself Lucifer becomes the
[41:10] angel of
[41:12] Light deceive to
[41:15] impersonate praise the Lord but in him
[41:19] is no light praise the Lord he says in
[41:22] the last days they would even deceive
[41:25] the very elected if possible
[41:30] but the elect has the word the El has
[41:35] the word from the
[41:36] beginning the El has the seed of the
[41:41] word praise the Lord as long as that
[41:44] seed is in there you can never get lost
[41:48] praise the Lord because the seed in
[41:51] there has life and that life is in
[41:55] agreement with the word of God
[41:58] that life has the ability to hear the
[42:02] voice of the Good
[42:04] Shepherd so now even when these other
[42:06] voices
[42:08] come yes you shall hear them but you
[42:11] shall not follow them because they don't
[42:14] speak life to your
[42:16] soul praise the Lord but when you hear
[42:18] the word the word of the Good Shepherd
[42:22] you feel there is life in the word and
[42:25] that word speaks life
[42:28] speaks life to the word that is in your
[42:31] heart and he says heavens and earth will
[42:35] pass away but my word shall not that
[42:39] word which you have received this true
[42:42] word of God as long as it abides in you
[42:47] it shall abide
[42:49] forever so now Heaven and Earth shall
[42:51] pass away but that word in you can never
[42:56] pass away
[42:58] shall live praise the Lord forever
[43:02] because that life that word is actually
[43:06] Christ
[43:07] himself praise the Lord so it is now
[43:09] that life in us that will help us to
[43:14] hear the voice of the
[43:16] shepher praise the Lord that life in us
[43:20] will help us to
[43:22] identify the true voice of the Good
[43:25] Shepherd only that voice shall we
[43:29] follow say as Paul said in
[43:33] Gans an angel from heaven
[43:36] preaches any other gospel than this that
[43:40] you've already heard let him be a c even
[43:44] an angel in the in the early church when
[43:48] those men like St
[43:50] Martin IRAs those Godly men when the
[43:55] devil would appear like an angel of
[43:56] Light
[43:59] you watch he will be a little bit off
[44:02] the
[44:04] word praise the Lord he shall be a
[44:07] little bit off the
[44:08] word he may look so close to the
[44:12] word somehow he shall be a little bit of
[44:16] the words and how are you able to
[44:19] identify it because you have the words
[44:22] and the word that you have must identify
[44:25] the true words
[44:27] when you hear that voice praise the Lord
[44:30] and what is that voice that voice is the
[44:33] true word of
[44:35] God that voice is the voice of Jesus
[44:39] Christ that voice is Jesus Christ
[44:42] himself praise the Lord so he says they
[44:46] they shall
[44:47] speak but
[44:49] somehow they shall go off the
[44:52] word and he says he appeared to Eve as
[44:55] an Ang of light he appeared to EV as an
[44:58] angel of
[45:00] Light told
[45:02] her the Lord said this the Lord said
[45:06] this he disagreed with
[45:10] God right at the end and that's the way
[45:14] false communion does
[45:16] today when people think they are praying
[45:19] to
[45:20] God obey the word it is a false
[45:24] communion
[45:27] if you out there you say you pray to God
[45:32] you say you believe God you say you a
[45:35] good
[45:35] Christian but then you
[45:38] disagree with one bit of the
[45:41] words praise the Lord it is a false
[45:44] communion you aren't communing with God
[45:49] you are communing with Devils because if
[45:52] you're communing with God you shall take
[45:55] God
[45:57] his word shall be in
[45:59] agreement the word of God and says if
[46:03] you abide in me and my word abide in you
[46:07] then ask what you will see it will be
[46:12] done now it just can't go one
[46:17] time the
[46:19] next you abide in me my words abide in
[46:23] you that is it stay right there
[46:27] abide means to rest
[46:30] there stay right there praise the Lord
[46:34] stay right in the
[46:36] word if the word abides in you it can't
[46:40] abide in you
[46:41] today then tomorrow it is off it has to
[46:45] abide in you once and for all it has to
[46:49] rest in there and you also have to rest
[46:52] in the
[46:53] word so now you can't hear the voice
[46:56] today
[46:57] and then you believe it and you said
[47:00] that is the truth and then tomorrow
[47:03] again you hear the same voice speaking
[47:06] something and then you say but there
[47:09] somehow I don't believe it you are not
[47:11] communing with God are communing with
[47:14] Devils because you're communing with God
[47:18] you shall rest in his words and you
[47:21] shall take every
[47:23] word that God speaks praise the Lord and
[47:27] then he says now let me close in saying
[47:30] this one
[47:32] word and says the blood and the body of
[47:35] the Lord mixed with faith the blood and
[47:39] the body of the
[47:41] Lord mixed with faith that is the blood
[47:45] and the
[47:46] body that is the spirit and the word
[47:49] mixed with faith equals eternal
[47:54] life he that eats my flesh
[47:58] and drinks my
[47:59] blood has eternal life and I raise him
[48:03] up at the last
[48:05] day there you are that is it the
[48:08] communion of the
[48:10] Lord the word and the spirit this life
[48:14] is in the
[48:15] blood and the word and the spirit equals
[48:18] eternal
[48:22] life and you receive it by by faith in
[48:25] the
[48:27] and then he says here is my prayer as I
[48:30] see the end
[48:32] approaching and see at any
[48:34] minute something could
[48:36] happen I know that we are not far
[48:40] off from the coming of the
[48:42] lord lord then in the name of the Lord
[48:46] Jesus the son of God let me take the
[48:50] word The Sword and weave it with the
[48:54] Faith with what faith I have
[48:58] and cut my way through every demon
[49:02] power I see Jesus by the communing of
[49:05] his
[49:07] word says commune with his
[49:10] word commune with the word of
[49:13] God if you abide in me commun with his
[49:17] words you abide in me and my word in
[49:21] you ask me what you will and it will be
[49:25] done for you
[49:27] there is real communion with the
[49:29] world and the spirit with faith to it
[49:34] together ask what you will and it will
[49:36] be
[49:37] done praise the Lord you commune with
[49:40] the word you abide in the words you
[49:44] believe the words and so you abide in
[49:46] the words then the word abides in
[49:50] you you believe the word of God then the
[49:53] word of God rests in your heart
[49:56] it rest in your soul then you begin
[49:59] depending upon the word you begin
[50:02] communing with the
[50:04] word nothing else but you're being led
[50:07] by the word because that word is the
[50:11] voice of the
[50:12] shepherd praise the Lord abide in me and
[50:16] I in you praise the Lord abide in me in
[50:20] other words follow my word believe my
[50:22] word live by my word walk by my word
[50:27] my word in
[50:29] you and then when you ask anything it
[50:32] shall be given unto you why because you
[50:35] are communing with the
[50:37] word and that's right the Life of Christ
[50:41] in you produces that life it produces
[50:46] Holiness it produces peace praise the
[50:50] Lord and then he says ask of anything
[50:53] and it shall be given to you why because
[50:56] you have the word which word has
[50:59] everything that you
[51:01] desire which word has life which word
[51:04] has protection which word has healing so
[51:08] because you live in the word you live by
[51:11] the word and the word lives in
[51:14] you if you speak anything it says it
[51:18] shall be done why because you abide in
[51:22] him you abide in the words you are in
[51:26] him his
[51:27] flock praise the Living God and now
[51:30] because you are in his flock praise the
[51:33] Lord now you have his word and you
[51:37] believe every
[51:39] word when he speaks you hear and you
[51:43] answer you don't believe something today
[51:47] tomorrow you say you don't believe it
[51:49] praise the Lord means you don't commune
[51:51] with him but true
[51:54] communion means taking God at his
[51:57] word taking his word and leing his word
[52:02] and living by his word hearing his voice
[52:06] and following his voice and going by his
[52:09] voice praise the Lord and what is the
[52:12] voice the voice of the Lord is the Lord
[52:15] himself and that is his word living by
[52:18] the word of
[52:20] God praise the Lord hearing the word
[52:23] doing what the word says do
[52:27] praise the Lord that is believing the
[52:30] word that is following the word so he
[52:33] says in the end times so many false
[52:36] teachers will
[52:38] come so many false prophets will
[52:42] come so many false Christ will
[52:45] come and they shall deceive so many but
[52:49] it says hold
[52:51] first to the voice of the Good
[52:54] Shepherd hold first The Voice by which
[52:58] you have been called hold fast to the
[53:02] word of
[53:03] God praise the Lord he says as long as
[53:06] you hold there and you AB in that word
[53:10] there is no way you'll be shaken there
[53:13] is no way you will be lost praise the
[53:17] Lord he says I shall lose
[53:19] none long as they are holding into the
[53:22] words and theyy in the words he say I
[53:25] shall raise
[53:27] up at last day so he shall lose none of
[53:31] us as long as we've had the voice and we
[53:34] are in the flock and we are being
[53:37] led by that voice praise the Lord so
[53:41] when
[53:47] Satan and makes himself the Ang of
[53:50] light but because you are made of a
[53:53] different nature
[53:56] you can't be part of
[53:58] him his voice sounds
[54:04] different praise the Lord he may have
[54:07] the
[54:08] Garment he may have the outer
[54:10] cover of of light but his voice shall
[54:16] not sound the same as the voice of the
[54:19] Good
[54:20] Shepherd praise the Lord so when he
[54:22] speaks you are able to know that he is
[54:26] not the voice of the
[54:28] shepherd because you are sheep and you
[54:31] can only
[54:33] recognize a sheep voice the voice of the
[54:37] shepherd so he may try to copy and be
[54:41] exactly like the
[54:44] shepherd but
[54:45] certainly the word in
[54:48] you which is the seed the life of God
[54:53] will not agree with him
[54:56] because he won't agree with
[54:58] him because God the god in you cannot
[55:02] agree with
[55:03] Satan praise the Lord and so as long as
[55:06] you have that
[55:08] word that is our
[55:10] security that is your
[55:12] security in those times of
[55:15] distress in those times of false
[55:17] teachers and false
[55:19] prophets which times we are
[55:22] Living Praise the Lord the Ang of light
[55:26] he come can't agree with the
[55:27] word so you can't agree with him and all
[55:31] the false anointed
[55:34] prophets will not agree with the word
[55:38] because they don't have the life in
[55:40] there to believe the
[55:42] word praise the Lord they are men
[55:46] Pleasers that's what the B says they are
[55:49] men Pleasers but the true seed of
[55:52] God is
[55:54] identified by their OB
[55:56] Obi to the word of God how do you are
[56:00] able to
[56:01] identify that you are a seed is by your
[56:05] obedience to the word of God praise the
[56:09] Lord so if someone is not obedient to
[56:12] the word of God they don't have the life
[56:14] of God in
[56:15] them and he says they shall
[56:18] confess to be Christ but as long as they
[56:22] don't have the Life of Christ in them
[56:26] life is in
[56:27] obedience in agement with the
[56:30] word they are false
[56:33] prophets and Paul says in in Galatians
[56:37] 18 even if they come in form of
[56:41] angels but speak another
[56:44] gospel different from
[56:47] this which we have told you he says let
[56:51] them be a
[56:52] c and he says if me
[56:57] and you see me coming back when I am
[57:00] speaking another
[57:02] gospel which is different from this
[57:05] which we have spoken to you he says let
[57:08] me be a cur because Jesus said so many
[57:13] false prophets will
[57:15] come so many false Christ will
[57:18] come if they can take on the form of
[57:20] Jesus
[57:21] Christ they can still take on the form
[57:25] of Paul
[57:27] that's why Paul said even if I come back
[57:31] because he was convinced that he had the
[57:34] Life of
[57:36] Christ he had the word of God he had the
[57:40] seed of life so that se in him not
[57:44] contradict with the word of God that's
[57:47] why he says even if it were me I come
[57:51] and teach something
[57:52] different Let Me Be A C in other words
[57:56] don't believe me c me
[57:59] out praise the Lord why because he is
[58:03] very
[58:05] confident that the true seed of God will
[58:09] be able to
[58:10] discern be able to recognize the voice
[58:13] and know that this is the
[58:16] truth and they shall go by the
[58:19] truth praise the Lord but they that are
[58:22] not known of
[58:23] him they shall fall the false unknown
[58:28] why because the life in them is not able
[58:32] to recogize the voice and discern
[58:35] between the
[58:36] voices of the Good Shepherd and the
[58:39] voices of the other
[58:41] Shepherds praise the Living God says
[58:44] they are
[58:46] obedient and that the nature of the
[58:49] sheep they don't add on or take away
[58:52] from the word they just follow
[58:57] what the word says the ship just
[59:01] follows what the shepher says the
[59:04] shepherd is
[59:05] leading they shall come
[59:08] following praise the Lord no matter
[59:10] where the shepherd goes if the shepherd
[59:13] goes to the bush they shall fall to the
[59:16] bush their nature is
[59:20] obedience to the leadership of the
[59:23] shepherd and that is the nature that we
[59:26] have the nature that we are given of
[59:29] Christ is the nature of
[59:32] obedience to the leadership of the holy
[59:35] spirit so where the spirit says go where
[59:39] he leads us there we shall go and there
[59:42] is a song WR that
[59:44] says praise the lord we shall go
[59:48] wherever he asks us to go even if it's a
[59:51] hard way we shall go the hard way
[59:55] because we know know that he has no bad
[59:58] plans for
[59:59] us praise the Lord so if it means going
[1:00:02] through the fire we shall go through the
[1:00:05] fire is going through the flood we shall
[1:00:08] go through the flood as long as he's in
[1:00:11] the lead we shall follow him because our
[1:00:15] nature is the nature of the sheep that
[1:00:18] is obedient to following the voice of
[1:00:20] the
[1:00:22] master praise the lord we shall follow
[1:00:26] our hearts
[1:00:27] courageous and say should you lead
[1:00:30] us where the battle
[1:00:33] rages we shall still
[1:00:36] march with our hearts courageous unto
[1:00:40] him why because our nature is made to
[1:00:45] follow
[1:00:47] him wherever he leads
[1:00:50] us you don't say no here no here is very
[1:00:54] hard for me to bear I can't contain it
[1:00:58] if you are a sheep you be obedient and
[1:01:01] you shall stay right there and wait for
[1:01:04] the next
[1:01:05] step praise the Lord so when he's
[1:01:07] leading you through the flag you are
[1:01:10] there and you are waiting upon him to
[1:01:13] show you the next cause of
[1:01:15] action so if he's standing right there
[1:01:18] you also stand right there and allow him
[1:01:22] do his will then when he takes you to
[1:01:24] the fire in the fire you depending upon
[1:01:29] him you're waiting upon him and you're
[1:01:32] waiting to see where next he is going so
[1:01:36] if he leads you through it you go his
[1:01:39] way that's why the Hebrew
[1:01:43] children praise the Lord they had the
[1:01:46] Life of
[1:01:47] Christ they were a
[1:01:49] sheep praise the Lord so when Calamity
[1:01:53] came and the only way of their
[1:01:57] was to pass through the
[1:01:59] fire because they had the nature of
[1:02:02] ship they stood right there and says if
[1:02:06] it is fire he's leading us is leading us
[1:02:12] and this is where he's taking us we
[1:02:14] shall go his way because we are
[1:02:17] confident that he has no bad plans for
[1:02:21] us so now they moved and they moved to
[1:02:24] the fire praise the Lord and in the fire
[1:02:28] he was there with them and it is him who
[1:02:33] still L them out of the fire and while
[1:02:36] they were in the fire the Bible says not
[1:02:40] even
[1:02:42] smoke tou their
[1:02:44] garments why because the Good Shepherd
[1:02:48] was there with them in the fire and as
[1:02:50] long as he's there with you in the fire
[1:02:53] the fire shall not touch you he shall
[1:02:56] not stop the fire from burning he shall
[1:03:00] allow it to burn because it is meant to
[1:03:03] burn but that fire shall not touch you
[1:03:08] praise the Lord so we shall go with our
[1:03:11] heart
[1:03:12] courageous unto him should he lead us
[1:03:17] through the floods should he lead us
[1:03:20] through sorrow should he lead us through
[1:03:23] pain we shall March with our heart
[1:03:27] courageous to him because our nature is
[1:03:32] to follow his
[1:03:34] leadership my sheep know my voice and
[1:03:38] that's how he's able to recognize his
[1:03:42] she when he speaks they hear and they
[1:03:46] answer and when he says they say
[1:03:50] Amen because they are sheep and they are
[1:03:54] obedient to every word
[1:03:56] that comes out of his mouth my sheep
[1:03:59] know my voice and we are his
[1:04:02] sheep praise the lord we are his sheep
[1:04:06] and if we hear his voice let's go by his
[1:04:10] voice praise the Lord not
[1:04:14] complaining believing his word believing
[1:04:17] every step of the
[1:04:19] way leing every
[1:04:21] Journey that he takes us through with
[1:04:24] not complaining
[1:04:26] but believing unto him praise the Lord
[1:04:29] and and the prophet says in the message
[1:04:33] Hebrews chapter 6 and
[1:04:36] 7
[1:04:40] 197 says and the man that is Bor of the
[1:04:43] spirit of
[1:04:44] God becomes a dve of
[1:04:47] God a dve of
[1:04:51] God his nature his change
[1:04:56] his
[1:04:57] makeup yes you put the spirit of the dve
[1:05:00] in the
[1:05:07] crow he would never sit on a dead
[1:05:11] ccass If he if he lit down by
[1:05:15] mistake he would certainly get away
[1:05:20] quick he couldn't stand
[1:05:22] in and the man that born of the spirit
[1:05:25] of God
[1:05:27] don't
[1:05:30] it you in
[1:05:33] there light
[1:05:39] a but he will get out of there
[1:05:43] quick a woman May entice
[1:05:46] him him turn
[1:05:48] around but he will turn his head
[1:05:51] again he will get away from there quick
[1:05:55] why he is a
[1:05:57] dve you ain't going to pull
[1:06:00] him because that he
[1:06:03] knows my sheep know my
[1:06:06] voice and the voice of the master is
[1:06:09] continuously
[1:06:11] calling like we heard last Wednesday
[1:06:14] that the voice of the
[1:06:16] blood keeps on crying out it keeps on
[1:06:21] calling because the Good
[1:06:23] Shepherd became the sacrifice
[1:06:27] the good shepher laid himself up as a as
[1:06:31] a
[1:06:32] sacrifice for us then his blood that
[1:06:36] comes out of him that blood is what
[1:06:40] claims each one of us and covers each
[1:06:43] one of us praise the Lord so the prophet
[1:06:46] says that he may get yourself in the
[1:06:49] wrong
[1:06:50] place but each time you hear the
[1:06:53] voice there still small
[1:06:56] voice the voice of the
[1:06:58] Shepherd in your heart you can't settle
[1:07:02] there shall R right straight
[1:07:05] back to the flock because your nature is
[1:07:10] not meant to be there it's meant to be
[1:07:13] into the FL my sheep know my
[1:07:17] voice praise the Lord and the
[1:07:21] stranger they will not follow he is a
[1:07:24] dve
[1:07:26] um to begin with that's what I'm
[1:07:29] speaking about the actual something that
[1:07:33] anchors in
[1:07:35] there that's right and when they that
[1:07:38] are not of the FL
[1:07:40] come and try to imitate
[1:07:44] it they won't last there they are men
[1:07:48] Pleasers
[1:07:50] bers lovers of themselves more than
[1:07:54] lovers of God
[1:07:56] they take time to talk about what befits
[1:07:58] them and what benefits them more than
[1:08:01] building the kingdom of
[1:08:06] God men shall be lovers of
[1:08:10] themselves that's the Bible says in the
[1:08:12] end
[1:08:13] times praise the Lord it says men shall
[1:08:16] be lovers of
[1:08:18] themselves
[1:08:20] disobedient
[1:08:22] boastful reject the truth
[1:08:26] praise the Lord because the truth makes
[1:08:29] them
[1:08:32] comfortable praise the Lord but yet the
[1:08:35] ship is very
[1:08:38] comfortable with that truth praise the
[1:08:41] Lord why because she has nothing else to
[1:08:46] do to obey and
[1:08:49] believe that's her
[1:08:51] nature obey and
[1:08:53] believe praise the Lord now the those
[1:08:57] praise the Lord that talks about that
[1:09:01] are
[1:09:02] disobedient that don't Point
[1:09:05] people or don't Point
[1:09:08] themselves towards Christ but Point
[1:09:12] people does of men with which people
[1:09:17] believe with which people are pleased
[1:09:20] with he says be aware of
[1:09:23] them they begin to preach
[1:09:26] does of men when they begin to preach
[1:09:30] does of men rather than pointing the
[1:09:33] people to
[1:09:35] Christ then you know they are false they
[1:09:39] have a false
[1:09:41] anointing because the true anointing of
[1:09:44] Jesus Christ points the people to Christ
[1:09:49] praise the Lord but now the false
[1:09:51] anointing shall Point people something
[1:09:55] else and not until Christ praise the
[1:09:59] Lord so now they begin to
[1:10:01] preach doctrines Bible calls them the
[1:10:04] doctrines of
[1:10:06] men they begin to preach what are those
[1:10:09] doctrines the baptism not in the name of
[1:10:13] the Lord Jesus
[1:10:14] Christ praise the Lord but the
[1:10:17] baptism Father Son and Holy
[1:10:21] Spirit yet it was not
[1:10:23] so praise the Lord from the beginning of
[1:10:26] the
[1:10:27] Apostles they begin to
[1:10:29] deny the scriptures they said now here
[1:10:33] there is something wrong there was an
[1:10:36] interesting evening
[1:10:38] yesterday when I came back to office I
[1:10:41] found my
[1:10:43] brother and then my sister Beck was
[1:10:47] there they have a
[1:10:50] friend I just bumped into them and they
[1:10:54] were speaking something about about the
[1:10:55] Trinity and about God and the
[1:10:58] Bible and then I came in they all kept
[1:11:01] quiet and I told them you are choking
[1:11:04] me I told him me I'm a preacher and now
[1:11:07] I'm going to start from where you've
[1:11:10] ended and now the young man he has been
[1:11:13] seeing me in a different
[1:11:15] perspective he has just been there for
[1:11:17] three days I told them I'm not going to
[1:11:21] sit this young man has asked a
[1:11:23] question about baptism about the godhead
[1:11:28] and I told him young man I am going to
[1:11:30] start from there and I told him let us
[1:11:33] go back to Genesis chapter
[1:11:35] 1 and we started from Genesis chapter 1
[1:11:38] and we ended up in
[1:11:40] Revelations and then at the end of the
[1:11:42] sermon of around two to three hours he
[1:11:46] says which means I must be baptized
[1:11:49] again I must be baptized again and I
[1:11:53] told him yes you must be baptized again
[1:11:57] and then he said oh that means all
[1:11:59] along these
[1:12:01] Apostles and these
[1:12:04] pastors been teaching the wrong word I
[1:12:07] told him yes because B says in the end
[1:12:12] there shall be false
[1:12:13] teachers false prophets and I told him I
[1:12:18] have not said anything outside the word
[1:12:21] every word which I have spoken I was
[1:12:24] quoting for the Bible
[1:12:25] and you read it and the Bible became new
[1:12:28] to him it's as if he was reading it for
[1:12:31] the first time and I told him this is
[1:12:34] the truth and I told him at the end that
[1:12:37] you are blessed because the Bible says
[1:12:40] the things we are hidden from the wise
[1:12:42] and The
[1:12:43] Prudent but you are
[1:12:45] blessed because now he has revealed it
[1:12:48] unto you and now you have no
[1:12:51] excuse but believe it and then said so
[1:12:56] which means there are those who are not
[1:12:57] meant to
[1:12:58] believe I told him yeah there are those
[1:13:01] that will not believe it because maybe
[1:13:04] somehow they are not predestined to
[1:13:06] believe it and I told him but as long as
[1:13:10] you are known of God like I told you
[1:13:14] that you were with him before the
[1:13:16] beginning of the world so now if you
[1:13:19] were with him and we are part of him you
[1:13:22] shall still be with him in the end of of
[1:13:25] the times and he says so I have to be
[1:13:28] baptized then I told him yes you must be
[1:13:32] baptized and he says yes he wants to be
[1:13:35] baptized praise the Lord there are false
[1:13:38] teachers who are teaching the false
[1:13:41] Doctrine the doctrines of men they not
[1:13:45] pointing the people Jesus
[1:13:47] Christ the good shepher they're
[1:13:49] anointing they're not pointing people to
[1:13:53] the voice of the good Shepherds
[1:13:56] but they appointing the people the
[1:13:58] doctrines of
[1:14:00] men and there are so many people out
[1:14:02] there that are lost
[1:14:05] because of these teachings Jesus said if
[1:14:09] it were possible they will deceive the
[1:14:12] very
[1:14:14] elect God that it is not possible for
[1:14:18] the elect to be
[1:14:19] deceived praise the lord we know that
[1:14:23] somehow someday the elect of God will
[1:14:27] hear the voice of the Good
[1:14:29] Shepherd and when they hear the voice of
[1:14:31] the Good Shepherd they will be able to
[1:14:34] know that this is the voice of the
[1:14:37] master they shall not sit but they shall
[1:14:40] come up they shall come out into the
[1:14:44] flock to believe the true word of
[1:14:47] God abide in me and my word abides in
[1:14:51] you you rest in
[1:14:54] me I will also take my rest in you stay
[1:14:58] right in the word and take your
[1:15:00] rest praise the Lord whether I lead you
[1:15:03] to the
[1:15:05] fire whether I lead you to the
[1:15:07] fire you follow because your
[1:15:12] obligation your nature is
[1:15:14] obedience follow to the fire and white
[1:15:18] water I bring
[1:15:20] next that is the voice of the
[1:15:22] master praise the Lord should he lead us
[1:15:26] where the battle
[1:15:28] rages we shall still mat with
[1:15:30] our praise the Lord they teach the
[1:15:33] people the doctrines of
[1:15:35] men they teach that they are three
[1:15:38] gods they teach that the baptism father
[1:15:42] son Holy Spirit they teach that a woman
[1:15:46] can still stand up because everyone of
[1:15:49] us is
[1:15:50] Anointed and they nor quote the book in
[1:15:53] Joel in the last
[1:15:56] God will pour His Spirit upon young men
[1:15:58] and and upon old
[1:16:00] people and young men and young women
[1:16:02] shall
[1:16:04] prophesy praise the Lord they take the
[1:16:07] scripture interpret it and then teach
[1:16:11] the people the doctrines of
[1:16:14] men but how are we able to identify them
[1:16:18] we have the word praise the Lord you
[1:16:22] have the word even before you believe
[1:16:26] the seed of God was in
[1:16:28] there and is that seed that is able Rec
[1:16:32] organize the true
[1:16:34] word praise the Lord and our prayer is
[1:16:37] that this word out there and reaches
[1:16:42] Every Soul that was predestinated for
[1:16:45] the of the world to believe this word
[1:16:48] because not
[1:16:50] until the last of the elect comes in we
[1:16:54] shall still be
[1:16:55] so now the prayer of every saint in
[1:16:58] these trying
[1:16:59] moments in this stressful moments in
[1:17:03] these moments of
[1:17:05] peral our prayer is that this gospel
[1:17:09] goes out there to reach Every Soul to
[1:17:13] catch every bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:17:16] bring them back to the FL that when they
[1:17:18] come to the flock we shall not be here
[1:17:22] anymore but we shall be taken because
[1:17:25] the purpose of God of reconciling
[1:17:29] his back to himself shall be finished
[1:17:33] praise the Lord Romans 1 verse
[1:17:36] 21 because they are
[1:17:39] disobedient because they glorify
[1:17:42] themselves more than God we've heard
[1:17:46] many of them in the entire world they
[1:17:49] calls great
[1:17:51] men men of God great pastors
[1:17:55] healers
[1:17:57] prophets even an
[1:17:59] Abomination it's even an
[1:18:04] Abomination it is to mention their
[1:18:09] name you can't call them Pastor so and
[1:18:13] so you either supposed to call him a man
[1:18:15] of
[1:18:17] God glorifying themselves more than
[1:18:21] Jesus Christ they are not pointing
[1:18:23] people to believe Christ and Trust on
[1:18:27] Jesus Christ by they appointing people
[1:18:31] themselves glorifying themselves
[1:18:35] exalting themselves more than Jesus
[1:18:38] Christ to search turn
[1:18:41] away the voice says to search turn
[1:18:45] away because they not leading you to to
[1:18:48] to life they not leading you to eternal
[1:18:51] life but they leading you to destruction
[1:18:56] they are hipping to
[1:18:58] themselves
[1:18:59] glories instead of glorifying the only
[1:19:03] son praise the Living God and the Bible
[1:19:07] says because they had in their
[1:19:11] hearts because they hard their
[1:19:15] hearts no I'm not
[1:19:17] reading God them gave them
[1:19:20] up praise the Lord he gave them up
[1:19:24] praise the Lord because that when they
[1:19:26] knew
[1:19:27] God they glorified him not but rather
[1:19:32] glorify
[1:19:36] themselves may God help every servant of
[1:19:40] God not to glorify themselves but
[1:19:44] glorify God in everything and point
[1:19:47] people to Christ says they were thank
[1:19:50] neither were they
[1:19:52] thankful but became vain in their IM
[1:19:59] inations and their foolish heart was
[1:20:04] darkened professing to be
[1:20:07] wise they became
[1:20:11] fools praise the Lord and the prophet
[1:20:14] says you know great bright things is
[1:20:17] what blinds the eyes of the
[1:20:20] people he was looking for a new light
[1:20:25] was looking for a new
[1:20:27] light she got it why the Bible has said
[1:20:32] Satan became the angel of Light and he
[1:20:35] came to speak to Eve so now because Eve
[1:20:38] was was looking for
[1:20:40] light she found it praise the Lord
[1:20:44] because that's what she was looking for
[1:20:46] and now because these men the false
[1:20:49] teachers and false Apostles there is
[1:20:52] something they are looking for God gives
[1:20:55] them
[1:20:56] over praise the Lord if they're looking
[1:20:59] for fame they shall find it if they're
[1:21:02] looking for Glory they shall find it but
[1:21:06] then they become
[1:21:08] fools that's what the Bible says they
[1:21:11] became
[1:21:12] fools professing themselves to be
[1:21:16] wise and the Bible say in the last
[1:21:19] days the Devils would be
[1:21:24] themselves into Ministers of
[1:21:27] light look at the very first sin was
[1:21:30] ever
[1:21:31] performed Satan wanted a greater and
[1:21:34] greater
[1:21:36] Kingdom great thing and went over in the
[1:21:39] north and set his own kingdom
[1:21:42] up outshine
[1:21:45] Michael always those bright
[1:21:48] things we are not
[1:21:51] monkeys we are not monkeys monkeys is
[1:21:54] Rich after right
[1:21:57] things let's be men and
[1:22:00] women let's be men and
[1:22:07] women sit down look at the gospel see
[1:22:11] what it says and follow the leading of
[1:22:14] the Holy
[1:22:16] Spirit you will never be able to know
[1:22:19] God until the Holy Spirit comes into you
[1:22:24] said that no man can call
[1:22:27] Jesus the Christ only by the Holy
[1:22:31] Ghost if you if you'll never receive the
[1:22:35] Holy
[1:22:36] Ghost you you you you don't know what
[1:22:40] he's the Christ
[1:22:42] yet you don't that he's the Christ yet
[1:22:45] remember that you're only walking
[1:22:48] towards that
[1:22:49] light you can say my pastor said so
[1:22:53] that's true my Bible said so that's true
[1:22:58] my mother said so that's true my church
[1:23:01] believes it is
[1:23:03] the that's true but what about you as an
[1:23:08] individual you don't know until you've
[1:23:11] received
[1:23:12] it and when you receive the Holy
[1:23:15] Ghost then you are a
[1:23:18] witness that he is alive forever
[1:23:22] more now the Holy Ghost is within you
[1:23:25] now and then you watch him as he
[1:23:29] works you hear the voice and you follow
[1:23:33] that voice because the voice is coming
[1:23:35] out of you the voice is in you and when
[1:23:39] he speaks you follow that voice because
[1:23:43] that voice is the voice of the Holy
[1:23:45] Spirit if the Life of Christ is in you
[1:23:49] it will produce his life in
[1:23:52] you you shall not seek to glorify
[1:23:55] yourself but you shall seek to glorify
[1:23:58] God praise the Living God and it says in
[1:24:02] the message the
[1:24:05] lamp and the
[1:24:07] dve praise the Lord he says now I want
[1:24:11] you to notice another thing the lamb was
[1:24:14] a willing
[1:24:16] lamp to be
[1:24:19] led it was
[1:24:21] willing and God his LS
[1:24:26] are willing to be led by God
[1:24:29] Spirit my sheep know my
[1:24:33] voice and a stranger they won't
[1:24:36] follow the strangers will
[1:24:39] come praise the Lord they will speak but
[1:24:43] we know the voice of the shepherd and
[1:24:46] only his voice do we
[1:24:48] follow and when the voice shall call out
[1:24:52] our names in the last day
[1:24:55] oh not even the
[1:24:58] ground shall hold us
[1:25:01] back voice of the
[1:25:04] shepherd which is the voice of the
[1:25:06] trumpet when it shall sound the Bible
[1:25:10] says the dead in Christ
[1:25:13] arise because they died they had a life
[1:25:17] in them the voice was in
[1:25:20] them recognize the voice was in them
[1:25:29] them so when the voice shall
[1:25:32] sound the trumpet shall sound says the
[1:25:36] dead in Christ shall rise
[1:25:38] up not even the
[1:25:40] grounds have the
[1:25:42] ability to hold us back when we hear the
[1:25:46] voice we come out and even in that day
[1:25:51] those that shall be sleeping when they
[1:25:53] shall hear the voice
[1:25:55] they shall come out to follow the voice
[1:25:59] they shall come up and shall be C up
[1:26:02] with the Lord in the air my sheep know
[1:26:05] my voice wherever they are as long as
[1:26:09] they hear the voice they run quickly to
[1:26:12] the master because my sheep know my
[1:26:15] voice and another message about the
[1:26:19] little eag and Mother
[1:26:22] E the message the ego in her
[1:26:26] nest now when we
[1:26:29] notice this old
[1:26:33] H every time she would find a little b
[1:26:36] or
[1:26:38] something she cl to
[1:26:47] herck little
[1:26:51] chickens all the little chickens come
[1:26:54] then the little e come in the back
[1:26:56] looking
[1:27:00] around because it was not recognizing
[1:27:03] the
[1:27:04] nature he was a f looking little
[1:27:07] creature but you know one day she happen
[1:27:10] to be out in
[1:27:14] theard
[1:27:16] feeding and the old mother happen to fly
[1:27:20] by and as she flew by and great Shadow
[1:27:25] swept
[1:27:26] over over the top of the
[1:27:29] Bard she looked down the mother Eagle
[1:27:33] looked
[1:27:34] down and she seen her
[1:27:37] own and he knows his
[1:27:41] voice and she screamed to
[1:27:44] him praise the Lord so now the prophet
[1:27:47] talks about the story of the
[1:27:49] eagle and the iglet the iglet had been
[1:27:53] lost
[1:27:55] because that the farmer got the
[1:27:58] egg and brought it and and it HED
[1:28:01] together with the
[1:28:02] chicken and now the iglet was always
[1:28:05] feeding together with the
[1:28:08] chicken it was always
[1:28:11] isolated so now he says some point when
[1:28:15] the mother the
[1:28:17] mother could Now look for food and then
[1:28:20] when he got it he could throw it for the
[1:28:23] chicken
[1:28:24] but now these chicks would eat by the
[1:28:28] iglet theet could not understand it and
[1:28:33] then he says one day she was
[1:28:36] moving behind the
[1:28:38] cheeks and then there was the mother up
[1:28:41] there then when the mother looked down
[1:28:45] with his big eyes he was able to locate
[1:28:49] the
[1:28:50] iglet and when she saw him the prophet
[1:28:54] says she
[1:28:56] screamed she screamed from a
[1:28:59] distance because she
[1:29:01] knew this little
[1:29:03] e had the life praise the Lord he had
[1:29:08] the nature to be able recogize the voice
[1:29:12] of mother
[1:29:13] eag so when she screamed the prophet
[1:29:17] says the little fellow turned his
[1:29:20] head and begin to look
[1:29:22] upward my she know my
[1:29:25] voice when he speaks they
[1:29:28] hear so the little e was able to hear
[1:29:32] and he looked up that's the way he ought
[1:29:34] to have been looking all the
[1:29:37] time and when he looked up she screamed
[1:29:41] back and she said
[1:29:43] Son you are not a
[1:29:46] chicken you are mine that is the voice
[1:29:50] of the sheer he says you don't belong
[1:29:53] there you don't belong to
[1:29:55] domination you don't belong to those
[1:29:59] organizations you belong here in the
[1:30:01] world praise the Lord you are mine I am
[1:30:05] so glad that God is God
[1:30:08] children all works of
[1:30:11] Life
[1:30:13] bus whatever they may
[1:30:16] be God knows his
[1:30:19] own and when they hear the gospel of the
[1:30:22] power of Jesus Christ
[1:30:24] they know that
[1:30:26] voice why because my sheep know my
[1:30:30] voice and now Satan may
[1:30:33] try so much squeeze the nature out of
[1:30:37] us by giving us lots of
[1:30:40] worries by giving us lots of
[1:30:44] Pleasures making us to sh up the
[1:30:46] pleasures of the
[1:30:47] world trying to squeeze the love out of
[1:30:51] us trying to divert us and us
[1:30:55] out praise the Lord into the lust of the
[1:30:59] Flesh and all these kind of
[1:31:02] things but you won't last there
[1:31:05] long when you hear the voice of the Good
[1:31:09] Shepherd you say here I am then you
[1:31:12] begin to follow him where he leads me I
[1:31:16] will follow I will go with him through
[1:31:19] the garden I'll go with him through the
[1:31:22] Judgment I'll go with
[1:31:24] through the fire I'll go with him
[1:31:27] through death I go with him and he shall
[1:31:30] lead me all the way because the purpose
[1:31:34] of creation the purpose of God is to
[1:31:37] bring us to himself and see us into
[1:31:40] eternity his purpose is not to call us
[1:31:44] to leave us here in church his purpose
[1:31:46] is to call us give us his word give us

[1:31:54] the end of the day that life produces
[1:31:57] eternal life out of Us Praise the Lord
[1:32:00] that when he calls us we shall be able
[1:32:03] to hear our
[1:32:04] names and we shall be able to join him
[1:32:07] will be taken eternity praise the Lord
[1:32:10] he says I will accept him but I won't
[1:32:13] let him in this little place because I
[1:32:15] have been this way since I was a
[1:32:19] child because I have been this since I
[1:32:22] was a child
