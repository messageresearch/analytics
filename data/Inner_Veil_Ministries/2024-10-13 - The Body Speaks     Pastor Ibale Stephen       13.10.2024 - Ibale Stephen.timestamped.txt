[28:35] up chapter
[28:40] 8
[28:43] verse before we do that let's bow heads
[28:46] in order of
[28:48] prayer precious Heavenly
[28:51] Father we thank you we've come before
[28:55] your
[28:56] presence and we know we are
[29:00] welcome because of the blood of Jesus
[29:03] Christ your voice says come un to
[29:06] me all you
[29:08] who and
[29:10] heav and I give you rest father among us
[29:15] there are people that are
[29:18] depressed have got different
[29:20] needs they need rest from you so Lord as
[29:25] we read the word
[29:28] I pray that may anoint
[29:30] it to the need of the
[29:33] people in Jesus name amen so okay we are
[29:41] reading um 2 Kings
[29:48] 87 and Elisha come to
[29:52] Damascus and benad the king of Syria was
[29:55] sick
[29:59] and was it was told him
[30:02] saying the man of God is
[30:08] come and the King
[30:12] said take a present in thine
[30:16] hand and go meet the man of
[30:21] God and inquire of the Lord by him
[30:25] saying shall I recover of this
[30:30] disease so went to meet
[30:34] him and took a present with
[30:37] him even of very a very good thing of
[30:50] Damascus and and stood before him and
[30:55] say thy son Ben king of Syria has sent
[31:01] me to
[31:05] thee saying shall I recover of this
[31:10] disease and elishah said unto
[31:14] him go say unto
[31:17] him thou
[31:20] mayest certainly
[31:24] recover how B the Lord
[31:28] has shown
[31:30] me that he shall surely
[31:34] die and he setled this continent
[31:39] steadfastly until he was
[31:43] ashamed and the man of God
[31:48] wept you may be
[31:52] seated
[31:55] so you know the scripture
[32:01] says and Elisha settled his continent
[32:09] steadly until he was
[32:12] ashamed and the man of God
[32:15] we he sticks his face to
[32:20] you now The New International Version
[32:23] says
[32:27] he stared at
[32:29] him with a fixed
[32:33] gaze until has was
[32:38] [Music]
[32:40] embarrassed
[32:45] embarrassed so the man of God began to
[32:51] weep then the New Living Translation
[32:55] says
[32:59] became
[33:01] [Music]
[33:02] uneasy
[33:07] uney so the
[33:09] prophet when he looked
[33:14] atel became
[33:17] ashamed he became
[33:19] embarrassed he became
[33:23] uneasy he became uncomfortable
[33:28] there is something we want to pick out
[33:30] of
[33:31] that and
[33:38] say why
[33:40] we my
[33:43] Lord and he
[33:45] said because I know the evil that thou
[33:48] will do unto the children of
[33:52] Israel and I want you to know
[33:56] today that when Elijah was going
[34:00] out and he was going up y to take a new
[34:06] body he was stepping into
[34:10] theop there is something which
[34:13] happened God asked him to anoint three
[34:17] men one of them
[34:20] was then the next one is jeu and then
[34:25] Elisha himself
[34:28] when Elijah was going out he anointed
[34:32] three
[34:33] men so we go back to verse 12 and read
[34:37] it
[34:40] systematically
[34:43] and why we my
[34:47] Lord and El
[34:50] answered because I know the evil that
[34:52] thou shal do the children of Israel
[34:57] their
[34:59] strongholds wil thou set on
[35:03] fire and their young
[35:05] men wi thou slay with the
[35:08] sword and will th their
[35:13] children and rip up their children I
[35:16] mean their women with
[35:22] child just when you know they they are
[35:26] happy with child
[35:31] so for a title this
[35:34] morning I want to speak on the
[35:38] subject the body
[35:43] speaks the body
[35:46] speaks now the body has a
[35:50] language which is separate from the
[35:53] language of sound
[35:57] the body itself has a
[36:00] language has anybody ever come before
[36:04] you and before he says what he wants to
[36:08] say youve given him a seat to
[36:11] se but the body begins to
[36:14] speak and then you know this person
[36:17] here has come with bad
[36:20] news all he has come with good
[36:25] news this B
[36:29] speaks sometimes he speaks with the
[36:31] words of your
[36:34] mouth and sometimes he speaks
[36:38] alone you'll find
[36:41] people they speak their body
[36:45] speaks together with the words of their
[36:50] mouth and sometimes this B
[36:53] [Music]
[36:54] speak on their own so your body sends
[36:59] forth
[37:01] signals that originate from the brain
[37:05] cells it may move signs that signal
[37:12] [Music]
[37:14] happiness or
[37:16] shock
[37:18] orer or
[37:21] misy your body
[37:24] speaks you know you can get it
[37:28] State and somebody sends a
[37:31] message I have made at least about
[37:36] 500,000 for your
[37:41] [Music]
[37:43] birthday your body
[37:46] speaks so I want you to follow this
[37:49] subject very
[37:53] closely so these signals
[37:58] could come
[38:00] alone or could be escorted by
[38:04] sound like screaming in
[38:09] h all at least a
[38:12] smile so your
[38:14] body
[38:17] communicates so when King B of Babylon
[38:21] saw the hand write a judgment
[38:27] Amen on the
[38:29] wall the body reacted to the
[38:34] shock of his human
[38:36] Spirit the Bible says his continence was
[38:42] changed his thought troubled
[38:46] him the joints of his Lo were
[38:51] loose the KN SM one against another
[38:58] the body
[39:00] speaks either when it's got good
[39:04] news it will speak I mean it will react
[39:08] in a state of
[39:12] Happiness if you know it's bad
[39:15] news it cannot pretend to put on another
[39:23] expression so as many as we are here
[39:28] as many as we are
[39:31] here that is true to us
[39:34] all amen your body reports what's
[39:38] running through your spirit
[39:42] world and it does not require the sign
[39:45] of the son of
[39:47] man to tell what's going
[39:50] on you don't require a gift of
[39:54] discernment but you know there those
[39:59] things that l in the future of a
[40:04] man and sometimes you may not be
[40:08] able to point out those
[40:11] things but some people are gried by
[40:17] fear and they fear for what they don't
[40:21] really can be able to
[40:25] explain and so those things keep
[40:27] traveling a man's human
[40:33] spirit and if that man stands before a
[40:38] prophet he can pull out those things out
[40:41] of
[40:43] him are you together with me yeah the
[40:46] prophet can tell you that you are being
[40:50] troubled you've lacked peace of
[40:53] mind because there is something that
[40:56] awaits you up
[41:00] that's how God made a
[41:02] man that he has got special
[41:05] feelers amen if there is a danger ahead
[41:09] of
[41:10] you your body
[41:14] speaks because God made
[41:16] you in such a way that you have got what
[41:21] we call a sensor on the inside
[41:25] there brother tells us about the
[41:30] earthquakes that was hitting uh in
[41:35] India but before the earthquake
[41:38] came you know in India they build walls
[41:42] from
[41:44] stones and so there are some pockets and
[41:49] spaces where the birs can
[41:52] go and build their
[41:55] nests but before the earthquake
[41:58] hit these birds flew
[42:02] out and the animals they walked away
[42:06] from the
[42:07] walls because these have never
[42:11] fallen they in
[42:13] contact with their own God they really
[42:17] know something is going to
[42:19] happen and when
[42:22] ask what happened amen the people were C
[42:26] up into
[42:28] it but the animals the
[42:31] birs try to save
[42:34] themselves you remember the tsunami
[42:37] which hit
[42:38] Asia you know the
[42:41] animals and
[42:44] elant they were moving away from the
[42:47] rivers because they knew the flood was
[42:50] going to hit
[42:53] the what I want tell you is that when
[42:57] you are in the right standing with
[43:00] God your body will
[43:02] speak will speak good
[43:05] things if you are not in contact with
[43:08] God you'll always be
[43:10] troubled because you do not know what
[43:13] comes
[43:14] next so I want to
[43:17] say that you know if a man is in that
[43:20] state of
[43:23] depression and is not up about himself
[43:27] cannot
[43:28] explain what's happening to you I really
[43:32] don't know but I feel there is something
[43:35] in
[43:36] me now listen to me very well if you
[43:40] stand before a
[43:42] prophet like was stood before a
[43:46] prophet a prophet would
[43:50] pull those things out of the movements
[43:53] of your
[43:55] body amen you are
[43:58] unhappy you
[44:00] uneasy you cannot
[44:03] look you want look down a prophet will
[44:07] stand and pull those things out
[44:10] of I want tell you when brother Bram was
[44:15] meeting some
[44:16] people he would start talk to
[44:19] them and he says excuse me
[44:23] sir what's your name maybe uh you saw
[44:27] soon then he starts talking to them and
[44:30] he says I'm trying to catch your
[44:34] spirit because the body
[44:37] movement was reporting
[44:40] something that was not okay and brother
[44:43] Bram was a prophet he could get into the
[44:47] human Spirit of the people and pull out
[44:51] the secrets of their
[44:53] mou are you together with me and I want
[44:57] to say anointed preaching anointed
[45:03] preaching is the same anointing that
[45:05] uses a
[45:07] prophet are you together with me it's
[45:10] exactly the same
[45:12] anointing the anointing of a prophet and
[45:16] the anointing of a
[45:17] Preacher is exactly the
[45:21] same I want to give you a quote
[45:23] here from the message discernment
[45:28] the prophet says a new testament
[45:32] Prophet is a
[45:34] preacher if he's
[45:36] preaching not try to edify
[45:41] himself to make a big name or toedy his
[45:47] organization you see where I'm coming
[45:49] from he says such a man he under the
[45:53] same
[45:54] anointing that uses a prophet
[45:58] if he comes
[46:00] innocently and is only trying to preach
[46:03] the
[46:04] word try to lift
[46:06] himself to a very big level if he comes
[46:13] down surrender to be used by God is the
[46:18] same
[46:19] anointing with a Old Testament
[46:24] Prophet is the same anointing
[46:28] which Elijah
[46:30] had when he looked into the face
[46:35] of andel's body
[46:40] movement began to
[46:42] speak and the prophet
[46:47] cried say Amen
[46:50] somebody and then he says why do you cry
[46:53] my
[46:54] Lord then he begins to tell him
[46:58] I see you here that you are going to
[47:00] destroy the children of
[47:03] Israel and when you read a lot
[47:08] lower with what he had told him he came
[47:12] to a point
[47:20] and am I a
[47:22] beast to do things like
[47:25] that he was was not
[47:28] aware but the
[47:30] anointing had
[47:36] C sometimes when we come to
[47:39] church and we are preaching we preach in
[47:44] season and out of season there are
[47:47] certain things that are laid out in the
[47:51] future but the preacher catches them
[47:55] here and you who has some kind of a a
[47:59] different
[48:01] understanding you begin to say why is he
[48:05] saying
[48:08] that why is he saying
[48:11] that
[48:13] that's is's wondering why the prophet
[48:17] was telling him that but the prophet had
[48:21] seen the
[48:22] future so in the message the voice of
[48:25] the sign
[48:27] the prophet says
[48:30] anybody every preacher is a prophet
[48:35] because he for telling
[48:38] something preaching the word and
[48:41] inspiration is called a prophet but in
[48:45] the Old Testament they were more than
[48:49] that they were
[48:51] seers they were man who told
[48:55] things that was coming to pass and it
[48:59] happened so I want tell you this
[49:02] morning that the difference between the
[49:05] Old Testament
[49:07] prophet and the New Testament
[49:10] preacher is that the Old Testament
[49:13] Prophet would go a level
[49:16] higher to be a
[49:18] Seer so he would
[49:20] see but the anointed
[49:23] preacher he picks it from the word
[49:27] and presents it to you so I want to say
[49:31] this
[49:32] morning that as I stand here I'm
[49:35] prophesying to
[49:36] you amen when I say that God Is A Healer
[49:42] and you say amen God will grant it to
[49:45] you it's the same
[49:48] anointing amen the only thing between
[49:52] me and brother PR is because brother PR
[49:58] would look into your human
[50:00] spirit and he would tell you what was
[50:02] going to
[50:04] be amen are you together with me okay so
[50:09] as I stand here and I preach I can
[50:14] speak you into the
[50:17] future amen and if you are willing to
[50:20] take
[50:21] them God will bless you
[50:26] that's what a preacher
[50:28] is now let us go into the
[50:32] text and cause the title to stand
[50:37] out that the body
[50:42] speaks so when elij was heading
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] out he anointed Three
[50:53] Men and he anointed them
[50:57] for a specific
[50:59] purpose if God anoints a
[51:02] man he doesn't give him a universal
[51:08] anointing he anoints him for specific
[51:13] purpose he can anoint me to be a teacher
[51:16] of the
[51:18] word and he can anoint another man to be
[51:21] an
[51:23] evangelist and one interesting thing
[51:27] is that
[51:28] everybody will only see the entire
[51:32] world by the picture that the Lord God
[51:35] has given
[51:36] him amen when he sits in front of the
[51:41] pastor he has to be so
[51:45] humble to be able to
[51:48] understand how the anointing of a pastor
[51:50] is
[51:52] working because the pastor is the father
[51:56] he handles the people with
[51:59] Grace but the
[52:01] Evangelist is a burning
[52:03] fire is you either take it or leave
[52:10] it so this is the way it
[52:13] works so he anointed
[52:16] elishah to be a prophet in his
[52:19] position because he was going
[52:22] away and he anointed
[52:26] be king of
[52:28] Assyria and he anointed je to cut off
[52:32] the family of
[52:35] ofab so two of these
[52:39] men which means
[52:42] je
[52:44] anduse the
[52:49] anointing are you together with me it's
[52:52] the anointing they receive
[52:56] put them in such a respectable
[53:00] position so now Elisha looks
[53:05] at and he says look at this
[53:08] man it's God who anointed him to be
[53:12] king look at what he's going to do with
[53:15] this he looked at him and he was
[53:21] embarrassed then the prophet cried
[53:27] it's a strange subject we have
[53:30] today but it's very important for
[53:34] us two of these
[53:36] men misus The Authority given to the
[53:44] ministry je was called to cut off the
[53:48] family of I mean of
[53:51] Ahab but he went beyond the purpose of
[53:54] the anointing
[53:57] and he destroyed thousands of
[54:00] men simply because they worshiped
[54:06] B he says how many are
[54:09] here who
[54:12] are I'm also one of
[54:14] them now I've been converted to
[54:19] B and all the worshipers of
[54:22] B they ran from all the other places
[54:25] where they went
[54:27] and they came into the
[54:29] temple and he told the people and he
[54:33] says look
[54:34] around if there is anybody here who
[54:38] doesn't was B put him
[54:43] out and they looked around and they said
[54:47] this one here is not a wor for bow this
[54:51] one here is not
[54:53] wor when they were out
[54:56] call these men bring the
[54:59] SW kill all these
[55:01] men don't spare anyone if you let anyone
[55:06] go he will be paid by your
[55:11] life and he killed
[55:14] people simply because they were
[55:17] Sinners but remember a sinner will
[55:20] always have his
[55:22] chance until he goes out of his life
[55:27] are you together with me God was not
[55:30] happy with
[55:31] him amen and in the
[55:35] future God cut off his entire
[55:39] family never to be exercised in the
[55:42] ministry
[55:44] again to be king over the
[55:47] land amen so he had some kind of a a a
[55:52] righteous indignation
[55:57] and there are so many people that take
[56:00] the
[56:01] pulpit and they go
[56:03] beyond there are many Christians who go
[56:07] beyond and they develop a righteous
[56:12] indignation but whatever anointing you
[56:16] have as a minister you are anointed for
[56:19] a particular
[56:22] purpose amen he had been raised to put
[56:27] down ahab's
[56:28] family from the king I mean from the
[56:31] Throne of
[56:32] Israel then
[56:34] has a man whom the sick Ben had benad
[56:40] had
[56:43] sent Amen to consult the
[56:46] prophet to see whether he would recover
[56:49] from his
[56:51] sickness is the man whom Elijah had
[56:53] anointed
[56:56] and the prophet told
[56:59] him that
[57:02] yes Ben would
[57:07] die he would not
[57:10] die
[57:12] but he will
[57:15] die he had seen him that he would not
[57:20] die by the
[57:22] sickness then later he said
[57:26] he will
[57:29] die God say unto him thou May certainly
[57:35] recover however the Lord has shown me
[57:40] that he shall
[57:44] die I want you to s that in a little
[57:49] bit you know it is not the
[57:52] disease that killed him
[57:57] but this
[58:01] man when he
[58:04] left the presence of
[58:07] elishah and elishah had looked at
[58:10] him and seen through his human
[58:14] Spirit he had seen him as a dangerous
[58:18] man amen so listen now he says after all
[58:26] the king said he would
[58:29] die so what did do when he got to King
[58:38] Ben he had to slaughter
[58:44] him have you
[58:47] seen because God says two things here
[58:52] one I was
[58:54] anointed to be king
[58:57] Syria the second thing then her would
[59:01] die so I would rather kill him now and I
[59:05] take
[59:08] thece but
[59:10] remember when David was
[59:14] anointed to be king over
[59:17] Israel he waited for his
[59:21] moment he did not go and H down for SA
[59:29] are you together with me so the prophet
[59:32] look at looked at
[59:34] hael and his body
[59:37] spoke without the company of
[59:42] words amen but as a prophet elishah bust
[59:48] out and
[59:50] cried at the body language
[59:54] ofel El
[59:57] he had settled his continent
[1:00:01] steadfastly until was
[1:00:04] ashamed amen
[1:00:08] and why wh
[1:00:14] thou elij said
[1:00:16] him because I know the
[1:00:19] evil that thou you will do to the
[1:00:22] children of
[1:00:24] Israel and then he began to break them
[1:00:27] down in four
[1:00:30] categories the
[1:00:32] strongholds will thou set on
[1:00:35] fire they young
[1:00:38] men thou slay with the
[1:00:40] sword and will Dash their
[1:00:44] children and rap up their women with
[1:00:49] child these two men here
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:00:57] was anointed to destroy
[1:01:01] Israel but both of them did
[1:01:06] it can I be
[1:01:09] anointed and misuse the
[1:01:12] gift yes you can be
[1:01:16] anointed and you misuse the
[1:01:22] gift praise the Lord I want you to
[1:01:26] listen to The Prophet
[1:01:29] here he says if you don't think this is
[1:01:34] true just listen to this all over the
[1:01:39] world in both
[1:01:42] Pentecostal and fundamental
[1:01:45] groups they are organizing the business
[1:01:48] men
[1:01:56] they have invaded the
[1:02:00] pulpit without a call from
[1:02:03] God they have styled
[1:02:06] themselves the fishes of
[1:02:09] men and the founders of a move of
[1:02:13] God and they say the gift and Ministry
[1:02:17] of Ephesians
[1:02:20] 4 that God gave the
[1:02:23] church has failed so they are taking
[1:02:27] over here we are right in the midst of
[1:02:31] the Fulfillment of
[1:02:34] Prophecy called the gain Saints of
[1:02:41] K don't even know that they are
[1:02:46] fulfilling they are blindly going
[1:02:49] on preaching
[1:02:53] experience for truth may God have pity
[1:02:57] on
[1:02:58] them may their eyes be opened before
[1:03:01] it's too
[1:03:03] late they've got an
[1:03:06] anointing God has blessed them that
[1:03:10] whatever they
[1:03:11] touch turns into
[1:03:15] gold and they think okay since the
[1:03:19] church is moving
[1:03:21] slow we can also change our anointing
[1:03:26] and take it to the
[1:03:30] church and see what we can
[1:03:33] do this is now the misplacing of the
[1:03:40] anointing God has anointed
[1:03:43] you to be king of
[1:03:46] Syria but you destroy
[1:03:49] Israel God has anointed you to cut off
[1:03:53] the family of Je
[1:03:56] but then you are turning again to slay
[1:03:58] some other
[1:04:00] people when God anoints a man his
[1:04:05] anointing works
[1:04:07] best when he stands in his position
[1:04:11] of
[1:04:13] Abraham when God called him out and
[1:04:16] placed him in the land he would stand
[1:04:20] and kill a number of
[1:04:22] Kings as one man but when he go goes
[1:04:26] beyond the
[1:04:27] borders he loses the
[1:04:30] authority now this is where we say he
[1:04:34] has revealed un to us the mystery of his
[1:04:38] will every one of us should know what
[1:04:42] has God called me to
[1:04:44] do and what are my
[1:04:48] boundaries amen so God says I mean
[1:04:52] brother Bram says that's the same way
[1:04:56] the businessmen have
[1:04:59] gone so keep the
[1:05:02] anointing God has given
[1:05:04] you in the place he anointed you
[1:05:08] for because anointing
[1:05:12] misused it causes a
[1:05:14] death the Lord spoke when they were
[1:05:18] being
[1:05:20] anointed these two men he says anoint Je
[1:05:25] the son of nush shout thou anoint to be
[1:05:29] king over
[1:05:30] Israel
[1:05:32] anoint to be king of Assyria but now
[1:05:37] cross his
[1:05:39] line and his body
[1:05:41] spoke and the prophet him by his
[1:05:48] intentions amen let me show you
[1:05:51] something here when Jesus in The Book of
[1:05:54] Mark chapter 2
[1:06:00] told the man
[1:06:06] that he said
[1:06:08] Son thy
[1:06:10] sins be
[1:06:13] forgiven and then the scripture
[1:06:16] says you know the
[1:06:19] Pharisees
[1:06:22] unsettled but their bodies spoke
[1:06:28] amen their bodies
[1:06:30] spoke and then Jesus says what are you
[1:06:35] debating within
[1:06:39] yourselves which is a hard
[1:06:41] thing to say that your sins be forgiven
[1:06:46] you or to say that pick up your bed and
[1:06:50] go are you together with me now in Jesus
[1:06:55] here
[1:06:56] was in the
[1:06:59] sameere spiritual
[1:07:02] height with
[1:07:04] El who entered into the mind
[1:07:08] of and again he also now
[1:07:12] Jesus he goes into the minds of the
[1:07:15] Pharisees are you together with me that
[1:07:18] you are debating in your
[1:07:22] mind the body spoke
[1:07:26] but the words did not
[1:07:28] come together with the
[1:07:30] body amen and immediately when Jesus
[1:07:34] perceived in the
[1:07:37] spirit that they reasoned within
[1:07:41] themselves amen he said to them why
[1:07:45] reason you these things in your
[1:07:50] hearts so when we come down to
[1:07:53] church then Minister stands in front of
[1:07:57] you he's ministering to speaking
[1:08:02] Hearts hallelujah
[1:08:07] hallelujah and if your heart speaks
[1:08:11] first then you can have whatever you
[1:08:13] have need
[1:08:15] of so what is your heart speaking this
[1:08:20] morning is your heart saying Lord I need
[1:08:23] to be an overcomer
[1:08:26] that's what you are going to take
[1:08:29] today is your heart saying
[1:08:31] Lord help me overcome this state of
[1:08:35] depression that's what you are going to
[1:08:38] take that's why brother Bram says when
[1:08:41] you come to church you get what you
[1:08:45] expect how many expect to
[1:08:48] go amen the Lord will grant it to you
[1:08:53] the only limitation I have
[1:08:56] is that I cannot
[1:08:59] see what you need but by preaching of
[1:09:03] the
[1:09:04] word the Holy Spirit comes directly to
[1:09:08] you to correct you to instruct you to
[1:09:13] teach you and when you take it that is
[1:09:16] your
[1:09:21] blessing praise the Lord sometimes as I
[1:09:26] said this body speak
[1:09:30] independent they speak independent of
[1:09:37] words
[1:09:38] listen brother Bram says let me just put
[1:09:42] in a
[1:09:44] word here from my own
[1:09:48] Ministry if you don't
[1:09:50] mind you all know that this gift in my
[1:09:54] life
[1:09:57] is a
[1:09:58] supernatural it's a gift
[1:10:01] where the holy spirit is
[1:10:04] able to discern
[1:10:07] diseases and the thoughts of men's
[1:10:11] hearts and other hidden
[1:10:14] things that only God could
[1:10:17] know and then reveal to
[1:10:20] me he's describing his
[1:10:23] gift I wish you could stand with
[1:10:27] me and see the faces of the
[1:10:31] people when Satan knows is going to be
[1:10:40] exposed are you together with me brother
[1:10:43] Bram says that their bodies begin to
[1:10:47] shift they begin to get
[1:10:51] unsettled he says I wish you could stand
[1:10:54] with me and look at the faces of the
[1:10:57] people I want to say it again the body
[1:11:02] [Applause]
[1:11:05] speaks praise the Lord the body does
[1:11:08] what it speaks now it isn't the
[1:11:13] people that I'm talking
[1:11:16] about it is that Satan has got a
[1:11:20] hold in their lives through
[1:11:23] sin indifference
[1:11:27] and disease but you should see their
[1:11:31] faces Satan knows is going to be
[1:11:35] exposed and the most peculiar changes
[1:11:38] come over the people's
[1:11:42] continents like the scripture says
[1:11:45] Elisha fasten his
[1:11:48] Contin
[1:11:50] on and he was ashamed
[1:11:56] do you understand
[1:11:58] why brother Bram would get those people
[1:12:01] in the prayer
[1:12:03] line they come stand before
[1:12:06] him and they begin to see the figting of
[1:12:09] their
[1:12:10] bodies the gift of a prophet would know
[1:12:12] who they
[1:12:13] were where they came from what their
[1:12:17] names were and then the prophet says
[1:12:21] that same gift is the gift of a Preacher
[1:12:29] except
[1:12:31] that he cannot tell you he cannot
[1:12:36] fore so brother Bram says there was
[1:12:39] aggressive movement of
[1:12:42] spirit among the people and the
[1:12:46] faces and body
[1:12:49] movements they showed and proved
[1:12:53] it praise the Lord
[1:12:56] certain kind
[1:13:02] of and little after
[1:13:07] that we see this man
[1:13:11] here the moment he leaves the presence
[1:13:13] of the
[1:13:14] prophet he goes and
[1:13:19] kills kills
[1:13:22] Ben it takes the kingdom
[1:13:26] it begins to invade
[1:13:29] Israel are you together with me there is
[1:13:32] something that I want to say to that
[1:13:35] when we come to church there is a state
[1:13:38] which we should
[1:13:41] overcome amen don't come with your
[1:13:49] baggage and you are determined to defend
[1:13:51] your bages
[1:13:59] no I don't like this
[1:14:02] man you defend your surrender yourself
[1:14:06] to
[1:14:07] God you don't come to a man you
[1:14:11] like you don't like you come to meet
[1:14:15] God and let your body say
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:20] amen and if a minister says anything
[1:14:25] just amen because that's the same
[1:14:28] Ministry of the
[1:14:30] Prophet it would be the same like he was
[1:14:32] sitting in the meeting so brother
[1:14:36] BR are you together with me so when God
[1:14:40] speaks to the evil
[1:14:43] spirits they
[1:14:46] frown sometimes they tear up the
[1:14:50] people and they begin to
[1:14:53] scream amen
[1:14:55] praise the Lord but then I want to tell
[1:14:58] you
[1:14:59] also when God is speaking to the
[1:15:04] C Hallelujah the body will report
[1:15:09] back are you together with me somebody
[1:15:12] will lift up his hands and he say that
[1:15:15] is mine I receive
[1:15:18] it amen the man can even stand up on his
[1:15:23] feet to receive
[1:15:26] your body
[1:15:27] speaks when you come to the house of God
[1:15:31] if you
[1:15:32] contr your body will speak if you agree
[1:15:36] with God your body will
[1:15:39] speak the body
[1:15:41] speak amen it is who
[1:15:45] said let them sacrifice the sacrifices
[1:15:49] of
[1:15:51] Thanksgiving and decare his works
[1:15:56] with
[1:15:57] rejoicing are you together with me so
[1:16:00] you sacrifice the
[1:16:03] sacrifices of
[1:16:05] Thanksgiving and you decare his
[1:16:08] works with rejoicing are you together
[1:16:11] with me your body cannot be
[1:16:14] silent when God is doing something for
[1:16:17] you your body cannot be silent when God
[1:16:21] is speaking and
[1:16:23] prophesying you are a child of God that
[1:16:27] you are not going to fail that you'll
[1:16:30] overcome praise the Lord your body will
[1:16:33] come up to say amen I believe
[1:16:39] it are you together with me so while we
[1:16:43] come to
[1:16:44] church we should watch in
[1:16:49] prayer are you are you together with me
[1:16:52] because the moment you enter into these
[1:16:54] Gates
[1:16:56] you've entered into a
[1:16:59] Battleground are you together with me
[1:17:02] you can come to
[1:17:04] church with one evil
[1:17:06] spirit and you can leave the church with
[1:17:10] seven evil spirits because of the
[1:17:17] attitude it is
[1:17:19] scripture brother Bram told us when he's
[1:17:23] casting out demons
[1:17:25] they are looking for where they want to
[1:17:27] go oh my God Amen when they cast out
[1:17:32] demons amen from those paks
[1:17:36] there they were looking for where to go
[1:17:40] I when they were casting them out of the
[1:17:42] mad man of
[1:17:45] GAD they
[1:17:47] say we cannot
[1:17:50] operate without a body there's no way
[1:17:54] the devil can
[1:17:56] what without a
[1:17:58] body and when there was
[1:18:00] nobody that was ready to Habit
[1:18:03] them they said okay let us go to the
[1:18:07] pit and they went to the pit and the
[1:18:11] pigs R
[1:18:12] mad they could not think
[1:18:15] anymore and they landed in the
[1:18:20] water so when you come to
[1:18:23] church you've come
[1:18:26] battle you must know what you are
[1:18:30] doing praise the Lord you know I don't
[1:18:34] want to be
[1:18:37] called into a place where they are doing
[1:18:42] battle I don't know to take
[1:18:45] cover I don't know to do a
[1:18:48] camouflage and look like a
[1:18:52] vegetation you see I don't know
[1:18:55] and then these bombs are
[1:18:59] coming I will
[1:19:01] die because of fear and you come to
[1:19:05] church you have come into a
[1:19:09] Battleground Satan vers as
[1:19:12] God and this preaching here is dealing
[1:19:16] with the
[1:19:18] spirits brother Bram told us that when
[1:19:21] you are preaching these Spirits here
[1:19:25] you know when you are
[1:19:27] preaching the people they get even
[1:19:31] healed not even coming down
[1:19:34] here the Holy Spirit
[1:19:37] himself begins to do a surgery upon the
[1:19:41] people are you together with me so if
[1:19:44] you are not in your
[1:19:46] prayer if you are not in your right
[1:19:49] M and if you are
[1:19:52] negative you become habitation
[1:19:56] of those evil
[1:20:01] spirits brother Bram
[1:20:03] says many times you see them in
[1:20:07] different
[1:20:09] forms he recently here recently I seen
[1:20:13] one coming from a
[1:20:16] woman that looked
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:23] like with
[1:20:25] big
[1:20:27] hairs hanging under his
[1:20:30] legs and so forth it swings coming right
[1:20:36] out they are evil spirits and many times
[1:20:41] it's someone looking over so
[1:20:49] beautiful on the
[1:20:52] outside could only look on on the inside
[1:20:55] of and see what it
[1:20:59] is then he says we are dominated by
[1:21:03] spirit and one time he was casting out
[1:21:07] spirits and the spirit here which was
[1:21:11] casting out was appealing to a spirit in
[1:21:15] the
[1:21:17] congregation which has got exactly the
[1:21:19] same
[1:21:21] attitude the same kind
[1:21:24] and let me tell you if it gets out of
[1:21:27] the other
[1:21:28] man it will look for that attitude and
[1:21:31] say it
[1:21:36] again you understand what I mean so when
[1:21:39] you come to
[1:21:40] church pray up father you have come into
[1:21:45] your presence I bring my burden it's not
[1:21:49] you who like to be what you
[1:21:52] are you don't like to that
[1:21:55] attitude because that attitude torments
[1:21:59] you amen you come to church to be a
[1:22:02] better
[1:22:04] person and so when you come to church
[1:22:08] open the door let the word
[1:22:11] coming amen and get to the
[1:22:15] center where your problem is and you say
[1:22:19] Lord I'm negative Lord I got an immun
[1:22:22] spirit
[1:22:25] amen I am so much of unth
[1:22:29] thankful don't hide your
[1:22:32] baggage you have come to a
[1:22:34] hospital you have come to be
[1:22:37] healed let your body language
[1:22:41] say thank you
[1:22:43] Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord I
[1:22:47] am being set
[1:22:49] free praise God on the day of Jubilee
[1:22:54] the Jubilee trumpet would
[1:22:57] sound and every
[1:23:00] slave would drop whatever work tool he
[1:23:05] has and today there is a jubilee
[1:23:09] trumpet that is blowing this
[1:23:12] morning drop every tool that the devil
[1:23:16] tries to put upon you and said master I
[1:23:21] want to go from here set free
[1:23:28] listen would have been
[1:23:30] saved if at that time he fell at the
[1:23:34] feet of the Prophet but he said am may
[1:23:38] fall at that moment he didn't know he
[1:23:42] was going to be a
[1:23:43] murderer right from that spot he went
[1:23:47] and killed King
[1:23:52] Ben be positive
[1:23:56] when God is speaking
[1:23:59] to so the demon mve to the
[1:24:05] people in
[1:24:07] service and the bodies would not keep
[1:24:09] silent about those
[1:24:12] movements so when these demons come they
[1:24:16] steal the minds of the
[1:24:19] people they will cause you to move out
[1:24:22] of church
[1:24:25] when something important is going to be
[1:24:29] said amen let me tell you your
[1:24:33] mouth can keep the secrets of the
[1:24:38] heart but your body cannot keep
[1:24:43] them praise the Lord you will never keep
[1:24:47] your
[1:24:48] secret your body lets out who you are
[1:24:54] amen you cannot say and say oh God bless
[1:24:58] you

[1:25:13] open God bless you it comes with the
[1:25:18] life it blows towards a
[1:25:21] brother it blows towards a sister

[1:26:13] quiver they will not speak
[1:26:16] easily something is
[1:26:19] reporting that something is not right
[1:26:24] the prophet looked him in the
[1:26:28] first to read all the
[1:26:31] Sid and the man got
[1:26:34] ashamed there are certain things that
[1:26:37] your actions will

[1:28:15] Revelation that was paying the
[1:28:18] time right from the bottom of his
[1:28:21] heart and that thing
[1:28:24] kept going
[1:28:26] forth into Isaac the blessing entered
[1:28:30] ISAC the blessing entered Jacob until

[1:32:26] is in itself a body
[1:32:29] language which is loud
[1:32:32] enough to speak to the rest of the
[1:32:37] Believers the body
[1:32:40] speaks your body never hides
[1:32:47] anything how can you stay
[1:32:51] away from the communion
[1:32:54] you are not
[1:32:57] busy and you say I'm not going to
[1:33:01] come the B has

[1:34:05] me and then you say
[1:34:08] no I will not do it in remembrance of
[1:34:15] you why did you die for
[1:34:20] me after the same man also

[1:34:45] me amen as a true Christian I cannot
[1:34:50] avoid the
[1:34:52] symbols that actually presentent my
[1:34:57] faith this doing remembrance of
[1:35:01] me the bread speaks of the body that was
[1:35:05] broken at
[1:35:09] Calvary and my body language
[1:35:13] speaks of my
[1:35:16] faith in the finished work of
[1:35:20] Calvary when I come to the communion
[1:35:22] night
[1:35:25] amen that the body was broken for
[1:35:29] me and that by the innocent
[1:35:33] blood of the Lamb of God I am now part

[1:35:57] Communicator my body
[1:35:59] language must deare me as part of the
[1:36:02] New
[1:36:04] Testament and by Discerning the Lord's
[1:36:10] body many are healed at the communion
[1:36:16] table because they come with the
[1:36:19] heart and they come into
[1:36:22] it amen amen deep
[1:36:26] analysis of the Lord's
[1:36:30] Supper must be properly
[1:36:34] understood the
[1:36:35] doctrine identifies us with the Lord's
[1:36:43] day you just you know don't know
[1:36:48] this but it identifies you
[1:36:53] with the Lord's
[1:36:55] day that
[1:36:57] Master I'm going to be there I'll be one
[1:37:01] of
[1:37:02] them when you come with Bread and Wine I
[1:37:07] will be there he said I'm not going to
[1:37:11] take
[1:37:13] this until I come again so when you take

[1:37:25] I'll be
[1:37:28] there are you together with me yes sir
[1:37:33] yes let's look at this uh
[1:37:37] Abraham he has that his backl brother
[1:37:42] lot had been taken
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:37:45] captive amen by the forces of the
[1:37:49] world he goes into battle to deliver his
[1:37:54] and he pursued the
[1:37:57] Kings and brought back all the
[1:38:01] loots amen and also brought back a
[1:38:04] lot so what happens after the
[1:38:08] battle and I know you were in battle
[1:38:11] this
[1:38:13] morning yeah you've been in battle for
[1:38:15] quite some
[1:38:17] time there are certain
[1:38:20] kings that want to take you captive
[1:38:27] but
[1:38:29] Abraham comes here to do
[1:38:32] battle to deliver
[1:38:35] you would you say Lord deliver
[1:38:38] me from the different
[1:38:41] attitudes to deliver you from your
[1:38:44] family
[1:38:46] troubles it is here where you are
[1:38:51] canell the min hisory the preaching
[1:38:59] ising and when you take the
[1:39:02] councel it's an anointed
[1:39:06] councel amen and the Lord delivers
[1:39:10] you so now when lot I mean when Abraham
[1:39:15] was coming back from the slot of the
[1:39:19] kings in Genesis
[1:39:22] 14 verse
[1:39:23] 18 and king of
[1:39:28] Sal brought Bread and
[1:39:33] Wine and he was the priest of the most
[1:39:35] high
[1:39:37] God
[1:39:40] so comes forth as both King and
[1:39:46] priest in the valley
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:52] of Amen
[1:39:54] after the battle with the
[1:39:57] Kings but at the
[1:40:00] time
[1:40:02] M presented only Bread and
[1:40:07] Wine to
[1:40:09] Abraham he doesn't come and show him a
[1:40:14] crown because it is this
[1:40:19] communion that will take him to the
[1:40:22] crown
[1:40:25] hallelujah it's communion
[1:40:28] time it's Fellowship

[1:40:35] the
[1:40:36] CR amen because you
[1:40:40] stand as our
[1:40:42] priest as long as we are on this
[1:40:46] journey amen and the last
[1:40:49] message the last two
[1:40:52] messages is
[1:40:54] leadership and
[1:40:56] communion hallelujah hallelujah so as
[1:40:59] you do the
[1:41:01] communion you are celebrating the
[1:41:03] finished work of
[1:41:06] C without
[1:41:08] which there is no crown for
[1:41:13] you so how can you say I don't need the
[1:41:19] communion the scripture says and he
[1:41:22] blessed him
[1:41:25] and
[1:41:26] said Blessed Be Abram of the
[1:41:31] god possess of Heaven and
[1:41:34] Earth and blessed be the most high
[1:41:38] God which has delivered th enemies into
[1:41:41] thy
[1:41:43] hand and he gave
[1:41:45] him a of
[1:41:50] all blessed be the god
[1:41:55] the most high God who has
[1:41:59] delivered thy
[1:42:01] enemies into th
[1:42:04] heart under your
[1:42:07] control
[1:42:13] Hallelujah your
[1:42:15] control amen he gives you
[1:42:18] power and
[1:42:20] authority and he says blessed
[1:42:24] God who has delivered th
[1:42:27] enemies into thy heart Hallelujah he was
[1:42:32] blessing
[1:42:34] himself because he couldn't bless
[1:42:36] anybody
[1:42:38] higher and when he did that Abraham said
[1:42:44] surely I should pay my
[1:42:47] TI and he gave a of
[1:42:51] all and God
[1:42:54] who is the priest of Abraham's
[1:42:58] confession bless
[1:43:00] Abraham and by
[1:43:03] Revelation Abraham saw the final Tru of
[1:43:05] the
[1:43:08] crown and then he gave him a TI of
[1:43:12] all what does This
[1:43:16] Ti
[1:43:18] represent it
[1:43:20] represented the hidden truth
[1:43:23] that the Earth is the
[1:43:27] field and the Harvest of the
[1:43:30] field pays the ti to
[1:43:32] God so
[1:43:34] Abraham being a part of the good
[1:43:38] wheat which makes the ti of the
[1:43:42] Harvest paid the
[1:43:45] ti trying to
[1:43:47] say when you come as king I'm going to
[1:43:52] be part of
[1:43:56] your your body
[1:43:59] speaks when you reject the
[1:44:05] ti that my
[1:44:08] understanding my
[1:44:10] Revelation is
[1:44:13] limited so communion and
[1:44:17] ties speaks
[1:44:20] loudly so
[1:44:23] God visisted Abraham in numerous
[1:44:28] occasions but this
[1:44:31] vist spoke
[1:44:34] eternity because he carried a
[1:44:37] crown otherwise
[1:44:40] Abraham would not know that this
[1:44:44] m is the king of
[1:44:49] Sal are you together with
[1:44:51] me yeah
[1:44:53] he
[1:44:54] came with Bread and
[1:44:57] Wine Abraham eat some of
[1:45:00] this
[1:45:06] because are going to be
[1:45:08] Redeemed by the breaking of the
[1:45:11] body and the flowing of the
[1:45:13] blood take of
[1:45:16] this
[1:45:18] abah was identified with it in time
[1:45:26] we identified with it in
[1:45:32] reality if it brought God
[1:45:36] himself to Institute
[1:45:39] communion in type and
[1:45:43] Shadow then where is the
[1:45:47] reality but me and
[1:45:50] you coming to the Lord's table
[1:45:54] each time we practice
[1:45:58] it yeah we become that
[1:46:01] reality and then talk about
[1:46:05] healing coming down into the
[1:46:07] church when you come with
[1:46:10] sincerity to the Lord's
[1:46:13] table forgiving one
[1:46:15] another and saying Lord if I don't
[1:46:20] forgive I will never be forgiven
[1:46:24] no wonder when Jesus came he said
[1:46:29] Abraham
[1:46:30] rejoiced when he saw
[1:46:34] my hallelujah hallelujah he saw the day
[1:46:39] when is going to come back
[1:46:42] again with Bread and Wine in the coming
[1:46:47] Kingdom so my body
[1:46:50] language must run to the C
[1:46:55] amen not stay on the
[1:46:58] perimeter to the
[1:47:00] center fellowship with
[1:47:03] brow is a good body
[1:47:08] language it is a sign of
[1:47:11] life
[1:47:13] amen Before Peter started
[1:47:17] backsliding he had followed from the
[1:47:19] center
[1:47:23] and he always fought for the first class
[1:47:29] with and John would
[1:47:32] go and get into the the Master's you
[1:47:36] know
[1:47:37] BOS and when he writes about
[1:47:41] himself he says and the
[1:47:46] Apostle whom the Lord
[1:47:50] loves he knew that God loved
[1:47:56] he
[1:48:01] always it is me I'm I'm going to die for
[1:48:07] you Peter at the
[1:48:10] center when you see the people draw away
[1:48:14] from the
[1:48:16] center the body is
[1:48:20] speaking are you together with me
[1:48:23] let's go to John chapter
[1:48:26] 21 verse
[1:48:31] 17 Jesus said unto him the third
[1:48:36] time Simon son of
[1:48:40] Jonah lovest thou me Peter was
[1:48:44] grieved because he said unto him the
[1:48:46] third
[1:48:47] time lovest thou me and he said unto him
[1:48:52] Lord
[1:48:53] th knowest all
[1:48:55] things thou knowest that I love
[1:48:59] thee Jesus said unto him feed my
[1:49:04] sheep amen ver I say unto
[1:49:08] thee when thou was
[1:49:11] young thou guard
[1:49:15] thyself and walkest with thou
[1:49:19] West but when thou shalt be old
[1:49:23] thou sh stretch forth thy
[1:49:28] hands and another man shall gu
[1:49:32] the and carry the thouest
[1:49:36] not this Jesus
[1:49:39] spoke
[1:49:41] signifying by what Death Peter should
[1:49:45] glorify
[1:49:48] God and when he had spoken
[1:49:51] this he said that to him follow
[1:49:57] me I want to bring out something you
[1:50:00] very
[1:50:02] interesting in these
[1:50:04] scriptures then Peter turning
[1:50:07] about because he was told
[1:50:11] follow but remember there was a first
[1:50:14] class
[1:50:17] seat one time years
[1:50:20] ago I was traveling with my wife
[1:50:24] and when we were buying
[1:50:25] tickets the normal places were
[1:50:29] finished but I had to go some
[1:50:32] place and then my wife would come and we
[1:50:36] would meet in a certain
[1:50:38] place when I went to board the
[1:50:43] plane they started saying
[1:50:46] um okay they changed my seat
[1:50:54] and so I asked why did you
[1:50:56] change they said it's okay but I didn't
[1:51:00] know they had given us the first
[1:51:05] class so I missed
[1:51:07] it I've never been in the first
[1:51:10] class but my wife
[1:51:14] has so this first class here is very
[1:51:19] necessary when you're on that plane they
[1:51:22] begin to close the
[1:51:24] curtains you should not see the kind of
[1:51:28] food that the people in the first
[1:51:33] class why don't we fight for the first
[1:51:37] class and John fought for the first
[1:51:44] class then Peter turning
[1:51:47] about Jesus told him follow
[1:51:50] me since the disciple for whom Jesus
[1:51:53] loved
[1:51:57] following which also leaned on his
[1:52:00] breast at
[1:52:05] supper and said
[1:52:09] Lord which is he that betrayeth
[1:52:13] thee Peter seeing
[1:52:16] him says to
[1:52:19] Jesus Lord
[1:52:22] and what shall this man
[1:52:25] do because Jesus had told Peter follow
[1:52:30] me and then I mean John comes
[1:52:34] also
[1:52:37] says one
[1:52:39] want that's the
[1:52:42] church that's how Pastor
[1:52:48] suffer this one comes tells you this
[1:52:51] that one comes tell you this and both of
[1:52:54] them are
[1:52:58] strong what shall this man do Jesus says
[1:53:03] unto him if I will that etern I
[1:53:09] come what is that to
[1:53:11] the you follow
[1:53:15] me then went this saying abroad among
[1:53:19] the brethren
[1:53:23] that the disciples I mean that disciples
[1:53:26] should not
[1:53:29] die yet Jesus
[1:53:31] said notto
[1:53:34] him he shall not die if
[1:53:38] I I
[1:53:41] come what
[1:53:46] that churches with their
[1:53:50] battles this family guess that
[1:53:55] this brother against that
[1:53:58] brother don't mind it is very
[1:54:05] healthy it was in Jesus
[1:54:09] church at the
[1:54:12] top they work the first
[1:54:18] class how many of you would want the
[1:54:20] first class I do
[1:54:23] to be there and fed from fresh
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:28] revelation God giving me everything that
[1:54:31] I pray
[1:54:32] for me an understanding that's not
[1:54:36] common to the rest of
[1:54:38] the I love the
[1:54:44] first but you see the body
[1:54:48] speaks when Peter started backsliding
[1:54:53] he
[1:54:55] preferred the lower
[1:54:58] class from the first
[1:55:01] class he didn't want the sent
[1:55:05] anymore inth
[1:55:08] 26 verse
[1:55:11] 58
[1:55:13] Jesus is passing through his
[1:55:17] tribulations he being taken to be
[1:55:20] crucified
[1:55:22] the Bible says but
[1:55:25] Peter followed him far
[1:55:29] off to the high priest
[1:55:34] Palace and went in and sat with the
[1:55:40] servs to see the
[1:55:45] end the
[1:55:47] body spoke
[1:55:52] I've given up on that I had
[1:55:55] thought he would come and redeem
[1:55:58] Israel now look they
[1:56:08] Tak and I even cut the man's
[1:56:12] ear maned
[1:56:17] it so he started following from AF
[1:56:23] then while he was a
[1:56:25] f when they were beginning to
[1:56:28] talk Peter was
[1:56:32] that he wants to participate in
[1:56:35] everything so when they were talking he
[1:56:39] said you sound like one of them he say I
[1:56:44] don't know that
[1:56:46] man the moment you get away from the
[1:56:50] center you are not safe from
[1:56:56] Spirits you are not safe from negative
[1:57:01] Spirits they want to get a hold
[1:57:04] of and Peter denied him the first
[1:57:08] time Peter denied him the second time
[1:57:11] Peter denied him the third time and then
[1:57:14] Peter
[1:57:18] wept the body actions of Peter
[1:57:23] we're speaking about a backsliding
[1:57:27] man followed from
[1:57:30] AF sat with the palace
[1:57:35] servants his company had
[1:57:39] chained amen and
[1:57:42] finally he denied his Lord three
[1:57:46] times he was always among the
[1:57:50] disciples but he drew back
[1:57:53] so the Lord watches your body
[1:57:57] language and I pray that we may strike
[1:58:00] revival
[1:58:03] time may God send a Revival message to
[1:58:07] us this
[1:58:09] morning amen your negative mind your
[1:58:14] negative attitude your negative body
[1:58:17] language the sees
[1:58:20] it at the res
[1:58:23] go and tell my
[1:58:25] disciples and Peter are you together
[1:58:29] with me and God in his goodness got the
[1:58:36] weakest and made him the head of the
[1:58:40] disciple he made him the
[1:58:43] spokesman on the day of
[1:58:45] Pentecost so I don't care how you feel I
[1:58:49] don't know how far you've been following
[1:58:52] but the Lord is speaking to you go and
[1:58:56] tell my Ginger
[1:58:58] church and so and saw who alone knows
[1:59:02] his
[1:59:04] weakness that I still love him let him
[1:59:07] not fall from AAR let him come down to
[1:59:11] the
[1:59:12] center hallelujah hallelujah now upon
[1:59:15] the first of the
[1:59:20] we very early in the
[1:59:23] they came to
[1:59:26] the bringing the
[1:59:28] spices which they had
[1:59:30] prepared to spice up the Tom of a dead
[1:59:36] man but they found the Stone Road
[1:59:41] away they checked on the
[1:59:44] inside and they found him
[1:59:46] not and it came to pass as they were
[1:59:50] much perplexed
[1:59:52] behold two
[1:59:54] men stood by them in shining
[2:00:00] garments and as they were
[2:00:02] afraid and bowed down their faces to the
[2:00:07] Earth they said unto them why seek ye
[2:00:11] the living from among the
[2:00:14] dead he's not here his reason remember
[2:00:19] he spoke unto
[2:00:20] you when he was in
[2:00:24] Galilee Are you together with me so now
[2:00:29] listen to the
[2:00:30] power of the body
[2:00:34] language this man was following a far
[2:00:38] off and when Peter heard the
[2:00:42] news of the
[2:00:44] Resurrection he was the first one
[2:00:46] running to the
[2:00:48] center are you together with me look at
[2:00:52] those two
[2:00:53] languages following from AF and now he
[2:00:58] has heard of the Resurrection he's
[2:01:00] running up the front of
[2:01:03] everybody the
[2:01:06] age the
[2:01:08] AG did not matter at that
[2:01:11] time he was the oldest I mean disciple
[2:01:23] so absenting from
[2:01:26] service is the perfect body
[2:01:30] language because when Peter
[2:01:34] recovered the busy
[2:01:38] job the business
[2:01:41] job you know according to this and
[2:01:44] according to
[2:01:45] that it was no longer an
[2:01:49] issue the fear of the
[2:01:53] was no longer an issue are you together
[2:01:56] with me when you
[2:01:59] recover your body language
[2:02:05] changes
[2:02:07] words and the last
[2:02:10] Channel I mean the first
[2:02:13] channel of
[2:02:16] communication it's your
[2:02:18] body before the word comes out
[2:02:22] your
[2:02:23] body
[2:02:28] speaks am I right this
[2:02:31] morning amen so there is
[2:02:35] something that's unsettling the
[2:02:41] people the neurotic condition of the
[2:02:45] people testifies of
[2:02:49] it the world is gripped in fear
[2:02:54] no trust among people

[2:02:59] children
[2:03:01] anymore and the children don't trust

[2:10:49] out why don't you run
[2:10:51] back to the
[2:10:54] center why don't you ask God to have
[2:10:58] Grace that you may have a Revival cycle
[2:11:03] again because the moment you get the
[2:11:06] Revival
[2:11:07] cycle your body will
[2:11:10] speak that's how good your body
[2:11:14] is
[2:11:15] amen yeah let me tell you we need to run
[2:11:20] back
[2:11:22] let me put in here the revelation of
[2:11:25] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him
[2:11:30] Revelation
[2:11:32] 1 and verse
[2:11:35] one do you love him
[2:11:38] friends
[2:11:40] amen
[2:11:41] Revelation 1 verse
[2:11:45] one the revelation of Jesus
[2:11:49] Christ which God God gave unto
[2:11:54] him to show unto his servant things
[2:11:57] which must shortly come to
[2:12:04] pass and he signified it by his
[2:12:10] Angel his servant
[2:12:13] John so the revelation of Jesus
[2:12:17] Christ dealt with in the Book of
[2:12:20] Revelation
[2:12:23] it is something higher than knowing the
[2:12:28] godhead amen it is higher than knowing
[2:12:31] the
[2:12:33] godhead which you all know if you just
[2:12:38] stop at the understanding of the
[2:12:42] godhead then that is
[2:12:45] information you need to come to the
[2:12:48] revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:12:52] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[2:12:56] servs and you
[2:12:58] also become the revelation of that
[2:13:04] Revelation
[2:13:06] amen it is Christ this Revelation is
[2:13:10] Christ carrying to us the entire
[2:13:15] disposition of
[2:13:18] God his nature
[2:13:21] character has revealed in
[2:13:24] Christ and his entire life has lived
[2:13:29] through the seven Church
[2:13:30] ages that is the revelation of Jesus
[2:13:33] Christ that we are dealing with
[2:13:39] today
[2:13:40] okay brother Bram says the Greek word
[2:13:44] for
[2:13:46] ration is apocalypse
[2:13:51] which means
[2:13:54] unil the
[2:13:56] unil is perfectly
[2:14:00] described in the example of a
[2:14:04] sculp unfailing his work of
[2:14:08] Statuary exposing it
[2:14:12] to
[2:14:15] uncovering
[2:14:17] revealing what was previously hidden
[2:14:22] amen it is now a SC
[2:14:29] here and he has hidden it but
[2:14:33] then he has to open it to the own
[2:14:39] Lu that's the revelation of Jesus
[2:14:43] Christ and for you to see him you don't
[2:14:47] stay at the

[2:14:53] CER and you see the revelation of
[2:14:56] Christ the end covering is not only the

[2:15:08] works in the church which church is
