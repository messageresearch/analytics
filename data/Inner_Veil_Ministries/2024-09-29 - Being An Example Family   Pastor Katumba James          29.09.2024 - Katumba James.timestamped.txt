[22:10] together as a family that the Lord has
[22:13] put
[22:14] together we love you and we bless you
[22:17] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:21] this amen let us go to Genesis CH
[22:27] 25 reading from verse 19 to verse
[22:37] 23 Genesis
[22:41] 25 reading from verse 19 to verse
[22:48] 23 the Bible
[22:50] says and these are the generations of
[22:53] Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begot Isaac
[23:00] Genesis 25 verse
[23:26] 19 and ISAC was 40 years old when he
[23:30] took Rebecca to his wife the daughter of
[23:33] Beth the Syrian of parad the sister toan
[23:37] the
[23:55] Syrian and Isaac Entre the Lord for his
[23:58] his wife because she was Barren and the
[24:01] Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca
[24:04] his wife conceived
[24:16] is and the children struggled together
[24:18] within her and she said if it be so why
[24:23] am I thus and she went to inquire of the
[24:27] Lord
[24:40] and the Lord said unto her two Nations
[24:43] and thy wom and two manner of people
[24:46] shall be separated from thy bowels and
[24:48] one shall be stronger than the other and
[24:52] the Elder Shall Serve the younger
[25:18] may God bless his word may
[25:22] seated so I want to preach on the
[25:25] subject
[25:29] being an example
[25:34] family praise the name of the Lord so
[25:38] when you read in the
[25:40] scriptures praise the name of the Lord
[25:43] you always find that all the fames
[25:46] through the
[25:48] scriptures they had
[25:52] challenges praise the name of the Lord
[25:55] the first family of Adam and Eve
[26:01] they had
[26:02] challenges they had problems in their
[26:06] family like now the first
[26:09] thing talk to the
[26:12] serpent and then the serpent deceived
[26:16] Eve Eve followed what the serpent was
[26:21] telling now what was the reaction of
[26:24] Adam and you see every one of
[26:28] Us in all our
[26:32] families pressures will
[26:35] arise troubles will
[26:37] come problems will
[26:40] come challenges will
[26:42] come and you know as long as we are
[26:45] living in this
[26:48] life uncertainty will not stop
[26:53] coming you know because we're living in
[26:56] these bodies
[26:58] and as long as we are living in these
[27:01] bodies anything can happen at any
[27:05] time and maybe you know you even don't
[27:08] know sometimes where it's going to come
[27:11] from but then our
[27:15] responsibilities as a family is to see
[27:18] how you handle those challenges that
[27:20] come in your
[27:23] home like now you look at
[27:26] Adam when Eve
[27:29] adultery what did Adam do he forgave
[27:34] her he received her to
[27:38] himself praise the name of our Lord we
[27:41] see the same thing with actually
[27:45] Joseph when Joseph Was preparing to
[27:48] marry
[27:51] Mary you know Joseph found Mary with a
[27:56] child
[27:59] but now the Bible
[28:01] says
[28:03] Joseph never wanted to make it a public
[28:09] example because what would have
[28:13] done what they were doing at that
[28:16] time is you know you take her to the
[28:18] people or to the elders and say this
[28:26] woman but not been with her but she's
[28:30] pregnant and then she would have been
[28:32] Stone to death but then the Bible says
[28:36] Joseph being a just
[28:41] person he nevered anything evil to
[28:44] happened to
[28:45] Mary so then he had
[28:48] decided to put her away
[28:52] secretly he never wanted anything evil
[28:55] to happen to
[28:57] Mary that's why the Bible says he was a
[29:00] just man he was a
[29:03] rightous and he should be the same thing
[29:05] also to
[29:06] us in our
[29:09] families praise the name of our Lord is
[29:11] that if the other party has done
[29:15] something you know you need to bear with
[29:18] that
[29:19] person you need to exercise
[29:23] forgiveness praise the name of our Lord
[29:26] and also we who are message
[29:30] Believers we know better than what the
[29:32] people in the world
[29:35] do because here you know it is the love
[29:37] of
[29:38] God that has saved us it's the love of
[29:42] God that has kept us at this time so you
[29:46] need to exercise that same love of
[29:50] God in your
[29:52] family praise the name of our Lord as
[29:55] we've said every family from Adam there
[30:00] has always been
[30:02] challenges and sometimes things maybe
[30:05] you don't
[30:07] understand and now if you don't
[30:09] understand an issue in your
[30:11] family then you go to God In
[30:14] Prayer like we've read here in in
[30:17] Genesis
[30:19] 25 the Bible says when
[30:23] Isaac married got Rebecca as his wife
[30:29] he was 40 years of
[30:31] age but it took him 20
[30:34] years for Rebecca to give birth socca
[30:38] was
[30:40] baren now Isaac never exchanged for
[30:44] somebody
[30:46] else he had to
[30:49] wait praise the name of our maybe he
[30:52] kept on
[30:53] praying the first year he prayed nothing
[30:56] happened he prayed nothing happened
[31:00] third he prayed nothing happened until
[31:03] now the 19th year in their
[31:07] marriage God heard their
[31:10] prayer the same thing with Elizabeth and
[31:16] Zaria Zaria was an old
[31:19] man Elizabeth was an old
[31:22] woman and then Zakaria would go to the
[31:25] temple and then he burns incense
[31:28] and then the people were waiting from
[31:31] outside also
[31:33] praying that their
[31:35] prayers would go with the
[31:39] incense and they kept on maybe God was
[31:41] answering their
[31:43] prayers but now Zakaria here from a
[31:47] young man to an old man praying for a
[31:52] child nothing was
[31:55] coming but Zaria
[31:58] didn't get another
[32:00] wife because Elizabeth was
[32:03] baren they kept on waiting on the
[32:06] Lord they were
[32:08] patient praise the name of our Lord they
[32:11] were able to bear with one
[32:14] another and you see this is what also we
[32:16] need to
[32:18] learn to learn how to bear with one
[32:23] another praise the name of our Lord
[32:26] learn to bear with your husband
[32:29] learn to bear with your
[32:30] wife and certainly each has got their
[32:35] weaknesses but in the midst of their
[32:38] weaknesses that's why you are part of
[32:41] them praise the name of our Lord and
[32:44] that's why you need to know that you
[32:46] compliment one
[32:49] another you need to give the other
[32:53] support you need to be a
[32:56] companion to your wife
[32:58] a companion to your
[33:00] husband praise the name of our Lord
[33:02] that's why God permitted for you to live
[33:06] together praise the name of our Lord so
[33:09] then don't Seek about
[33:12] separation don't Seek about how you can
[33:15] live contrary to one
[33:17] another but you see how you can live in
[33:23] harmony husband and a wife you know
[33:26] creating a
[33:29] environment for your children to grow up
[33:32] in the fear of the
[33:34] Lord creating a conducive environment
[33:38] for your children to
[33:40] desire to be like
[33:43] you praise the name of our Lord you know
[33:45] there are people who have grown up with
[33:47] bad
[33:50] examples when they look at their
[33:55] families they say I don't want to
[34:00] say that is
[34:02] torture say why entering that thing when
[34:04] you're still
[34:07] young because they have been shown bad
[34:11] examples but you see family is good to
[34:15] start when you still
[34:18] strong praise the name of Lord why would
[34:21] you want to reach a middlee person then
[34:23] you start a
[34:26] family not the best especially if God
[34:30] has given you the
[34:32] ability it's always good to
[34:35] marry when you are still young praise
[34:38] the name of our Lord for the
[34:41] Sisters there is a age you can reach
[34:43] that you may not be able to
[34:48] conceive so you find out that's
[34:52] out then for
[34:55] brothers there is a time you reach
[34:59] that you
[35:07] everybody
[35:10] look you know because you keep on
[35:14] growing so it's always good start your
[35:17] family when you are still
[35:20] young that you can raise your
[35:23] children when you are still strong and
[35:26] when you are still you know even places
[35:28] of
[35:29] work when you reach 60 they
[35:33] say we retire
[35:35] you now assume you are 60
[35:38] years and your children is 5
[35:41] years 10 years not because of
[35:54] Misfortune because one was
[35:57] now it's you saying I think now I've
[35:59] made enough money I can
[36:04] marry you know it's not really the
[36:08] best so then we need to see
[36:11] that that you know you learn have family
[36:14] when you are young
[36:18] enough and you devote time for your
[36:22] family to raise your
[36:24] children you reach maybe that age 60 you
[36:28] you can now be able to see of your
[36:32] children and then maybe see them
[36:36] mared say that they can get be able to
[36:38] relate with
[36:40] you praise the name of our Lord have
[36:44] that praise the name of our Lord you
[36:48] know there is a
[36:50] scripture maybe we go
[36:53] there first Corinthians chapter 7
[36:59] praise the name of the Lord First
[37:02] Corinthians chapter
[37:08] 7 and then verse
[37:12] one he says now concerning the things
[37:15] whereof you wrote unto
[37:17] me it's good for a man not to touch a
[37:21] woman
[37:29] now you the Bible
[37:36] says did
[37:41] a
[37:45] ien that it is not good for a man to
[37:47] touch a woman misin
[37:51] it praise the name of our Lord what what
[37:55] is he talking about
[37:58] say it's
[37:59] good for a man not to touch a
[38:04] woman which
[38:09] manse says
[38:12] nevertheless to avoid
[38:15] fornication let every
[38:18] man have his own
[38:21] wife and every woman have her own
[38:25] husband so which man is it talking
[38:28] about the one who is not
[38:31] married praise the name of the Lord so
[38:34] if you're not married it's good for you
[38:36] not to touch a
[38:38] woman but now if you are
[38:40] married you have
[38:43] one praise the name of our Lord and then
[38:47] now you see that in this verse
[38:49] here is a
[38:51] promise that every man can have his own
[38:56] wife and every woman can have her own
[39:01] husband so now if I want a
[39:05] wife I take that scripture to
[39:07] God lord you said I need to have my own
[39:10] wife if I want a husband I Take God that
[39:14] scripture Lord you said I didn't have my
[39:18] own
[39:20] husband not one we are going to share
[39:22] with others
[39:28] so you see the scripture is telling
[39:31] us you know
[39:34] everyone a husband a man can get a
[39:39] wife and a woman can have a
[39:44] husband praise the name of our Lord now
[39:48] you know the devil is so
[39:52] terrible when you are not
[39:55] married you desire one another so
[39:59] much now when you come
[40:02] together husband and
[40:05] wife then the devil brings things
[40:08] out you start seeing
[40:11] hatred
[40:13] [Music]
[40:14] despising listing somebody's
[40:20] mistakes there's a brother had a black
[40:23] book on his wife
[40:28] and so he had that black
[40:31] book he would write down the
[40:35] date what the wife has
[40:38] done and he he was putting every mistake
[40:41] of the
[40:44] wife how you can imagine such a
[40:47] home the husband writing a black book
[40:50] against his
[40:53] wife now maybe you may not have that
[40:56] black
[40:59] but in your mind you keep on reminding
[41:02] her did this the other year again you
[41:05] have done this again you have done this
[41:09] we need to bring forgiveness there we
[41:11] need to bring in forgiveness
[41:14] there praise the name of our Lord you
[41:17] know that's one of the things which
[41:19] brought
[41:22] divorce in the Old
[41:24] Testament because he said if you have an
[41:28] issue against your wife you write her a
[41:32] letter of
[41:34] divorce and give her to go and then
[41:37] another can Mar and then they came and
[41:40] asked Jesus why did Moses tell
[41:44] them let us go to MTH chapter
[41:47] 19 praise the name of the Lord MTH
[41:50] chapter
[41:51] 19 and then verse
[41:54] three the FES also came to him tempting
[42:00] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[42:04] a man to put away his wife for every
[42:16] cause he answered and said unto
[42:20] them have you not
[42:23] Tre that he which made them at the
[42:26] beginning
[42:29] made them male and
[42:32] female and said for this cause shall a
[42:36] man leave his father and
[42:40] mother and shall C to his
[42:44] wife and they shall be one
[42:49] flesh wherefore they are noral
[42:53] TR but one
[42:55] flesh what for God has joined
[43:00] together let no man put
[43:04] a so he was pointing them to the first
[43:09] Covenant one man one
[43:12] woman and said he made them
[43:15] one but now these people were now
[43:18] referring to where it can be one plus
[43:21] many
[43:27] then they said to him in verse
[43:29] S why Moses command to give a writing of
[43:33] divorcement to put her
[43:46] away he says unto
[43:49] themes because of the hardness of your
[43:55] heart suffered you to put away your
[44:01] wives but from the beginning it was not
[44:06] so so now Christ addresses the issue of
[44:09] the hardness of our
[44:13] hearts and this is one of the areas in
[44:16] our
[44:18] marriage where Satan can
[44:21] exploit when you have a Hardy
[44:24] heart towards your wife
[44:27] when you have a hard heart toward your
[44:30] husband you can never enjoy your
[44:34] marriage you know the hardness of heart
[44:38] will make you
[44:43] judgmental
[44:45] FL every small thing you are not
[44:49] appreciating and you see the devil puts
[44:52] upon
[44:53] you that you easily see the mistakes
[44:57] and you don't see the
[44:58] good that's what the devil does and so
[45:01] you find that your marriage is
[45:05] hard every day you live in
[45:11] it they so hard remove the hardness of
[45:15] heart praise the name of our Lord and I
[45:18] personally
[45:20] believe there is no better
[45:24] wife than what God has given you
[45:28] there is no better
[45:31] husband than what God has given
[45:33] you so don't start thinking about
[45:36] somebody
[45:38] else no see how best you can make that
[45:42] work
[45:44] out the husband you have or the wife you
[45:47] have see how best you can live in
[45:52] harmony how you can live in
[45:55] happiness not allow the
[45:57] pring to
[46:04] you like this it wasn't for
[46:08] you praise the name of our Lord so you
[46:11] just appreciate what God has given
[46:14] you and be
[46:16] thankful and said Lord I Thank you for
[46:19] my wife Lord thank you for my husand and
[46:22] then you pray for one
[46:24] another praise the name of our Lord
[46:27] you just pray for one
[46:29] another you know yesterday I was
[46:35] in and then there's a
[46:38] brother is a parish is a parish in one
[46:41] of those sub counties in par
[46:47] district and then now he was giving a
[46:50] testimony of the challenges at a place
[46:52] of work
[46:56] telling
[46:58] us that they call
[47:03] him was
[47:05] wondering they started calling
[47:08] me and I was
[47:11] like he wondered then he said okay he
[47:15] had some problem about being
[47:18] mad but of course he recovered he
[47:22] recovered but now the the place of work
[47:24] they know him as
[47:28] the name they call
[47:30] him then he was saying that he was he
[47:33] was getting annoyed with
[47:36] everybody who was calling him that but
[47:39] finally he accepted that they call
[47:43] him it was very
[47:46] strange he
[47:49] accepted praise the name of the Lord but
[47:52] now you see you are in a sitation
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] he's your wife she's your
[47:59] wife he's your
[48:02] husband praise the name of the Lord
[48:04] don't be ashamed about who they
[48:08] are you know even becoming your wife or
[48:10] your
[48:12] husband they didn't blindfold you
[48:16] first you made the
[48:19] choice praise the name of so just
[48:22] Rejoice with what God has given
[48:24] you and bear with
[48:28] bear with him the things may not be the
[48:32] best but they can do
[48:35] better and you see how you can live
[48:38] together in support of one another so
[48:41] you remove the hardness of
[48:45] heart you know he doesn't like this she
[48:49] doesn't like this then why would you
[48:51] want to repeat it all the
[48:53] time praise the name of our Lord you
[48:56] want to repeat the same
[48:57] issue isue or your family your people or
[49:03] this or this and now there are some
[49:07] tribes when the wife doesn't give
[49:12] birth she's feeling
[49:16] our some of those families like
[49:20] that now as a
[49:22] husband why do you keep your wife where
[49:24] she's abused
[49:28] you know you take her where you know
[49:31] she's
[49:33] secure you must be the protection for
[49:35] your
[49:36] wife you must be the protection for your
[49:40] husband praise the name of the Lord you
[49:42] see there are also some
[49:44] people when they
[49:46] marry they take their wies to The
[49:49] Villages and then for him he stays in
[49:51] town why did you marry her go and make
[49:56] plantations for you
[49:59] or you know very strange but somebody
[50:04] thinking is like that in the town I
[50:06] can't live with the wife let me take her
[50:09] to the
[50:10] Village she didn't marry you to be away
[50:15] from
[50:16] you praise the name of our Lord she's
[50:19] meant to live with
[50:21] you praise the name of the Lord she's
[50:24] meant to be with you unless maybe it is
[50:27] your
[50:31] conent but even that there are
[50:35] challenges the husband is in Guru the
[50:38] wife is
[50:39] Ina they meet maybe once in a week or
[50:42] once in a
[50:44] month there will always be more
[50:47] challenges more Tres
[50:50] than susp
[50:55] [Music]
[51:00] you making a lot of money you're not
[51:01] giving me
[51:04] support you don't care about me it has
[51:08] its own
[51:09] problems so now we need to
[51:12] see that we live in
[51:17] harmony praise the name of the Lord so
[51:20] Isaac when he saw the wife is not giving
[51:24] back he waited on the
[51:27] Lord praise the name of the Lord and
[51:29] then another thing you should make sure
[51:31] the devil doesn't put in your
[51:34] mind is to think you've got the wrong
[51:38] person don't allow the devil to put that
[51:41] in your
[51:42] mind accept this is my
[51:45] wife accept this is my
[51:48] husband regardless of their
[51:51] weaknesses regardless of their
[51:53] limitations
[51:57] for them and then you'll see how God
[51:59] will take you through the challenges
[52:01] that you
[52:03] face otherwise the
[52:05] devil will use those gaps you are
[52:11] seeing you
[52:14] know to create a distance between
[52:19] you until you know you start ausing one
[52:22] another you start thinking bad about the
[52:24] other
[52:26] the Devil is a master of
[52:28] that he knows how to
[52:31] paint you start imagining about your
[52:34] wife or your husband that they doing
[52:37] this you believe it then you build a
[52:40] complex toward the
[52:43] same so when he's talking to you about
[52:46] this you are responding to what you
[52:50] thinking have I had
[52:52] right okay let me keep quiet and now
[52:55] when he keeps
[52:57] you start
[53:02] thinking and then you get
[53:05] convinced the other day said that he
[53:07] kept
[53:08] quiet so it is true and then you start
[53:12] building your
[53:14] imaginations and if you thinking so much
[53:16] about it you even get a
[53:20] dream and you want to run your home
[53:22] based on dreams you dream
[53:27] and there are some
[53:29] places where Satan can anoint neighbors
[53:33] or other
[53:36] people to bring false
[53:42] information even the other one told
[53:45] me you shouldn't do like
[53:48] that praise the name of our Lord why
[53:51] would you believe another
[53:53] person more than your own husband or
[53:55] your own
[53:59] praise the name of our Lord why would
[54:00] you do
[54:02] that you shouldn't do
[54:04] that praise the name of our Lord and
[54:07] then now for my brothers and sisters who
[54:09] have not yet got into
[54:14] marriage praise the name of our Lord
[54:17] don't allow the
[54:20] devil to get yourself messed up
[54:26] praise the name of the Lord let me say
[54:29] it this
[54:31] way don't sleep with one
[54:38] another when
[54:42] not that you do before
[54:47] marriage is a good point for Satan to
[54:50] use in
[54:54] future you see be
[54:58] patient so he's doing it to somebody
[55:01] else and the devil uses that several
[55:05] times and sometimes you find people's
[55:09] challenges they come from that
[55:13] point not trusting one another not
[55:16] believing one another when one sees the
[55:19] husband talking with a
[55:22] woman he
[55:24] suspects I think he wants do the way he
[55:26] did to
[55:28] me when the other one sees the wife
[55:30] talking to another
[55:31] man he just imagin
[55:34] that but you see if you're working in a
[55:39] society you mean at place of work you
[55:42] should avoid talking to your female
[55:43] colleagues because you have a
[55:50] wife how can that
[55:52] happen you live in a community
[55:58] Society praise the name of the Lord but
[56:00] you see the devil has got a ground
[56:04] somewhere and then he puts that
[56:08] imagination not to trust the
[56:17] other you're not
[56:19] comfortable you're not trusting one
[56:22] another so see that you don't give
[56:24] certain opportunity
[56:28] to bring such imagination in
[56:30] future but see that you live
[56:35] upright waiting on the
[56:37] Lord praise the name of our Lord and see
[56:40] that you see that you avoid question
[56:49] things a husband or
[56:51] wife you know
[56:53] like I start talking with a sister a
[56:58] woman I'm very free with
[57:00] her but I'm not free with my
[57:04] wife then there's something
[57:07] wrong then you start wondering why is
[57:09] this smiling so
[57:12] much but doesn't smile with
[57:15] meise the name of you know it's just
[57:19] like this
[57:22] introductions you know when they are
[57:23] doing these introductions in many places
[57:28] when the women come especially the
[57:31] visitors maybe actually it's the guest
[57:34] who come and the V it's is the host who
[57:36] come and
[57:38] greet they say let us bring our
[57:40] daughters and they greet
[57:44] you and then now what they
[57:48] do let us also bring these ones to
[57:54] come now there was a
[58:00] scenario the visitors the women have
[58:04] come and actually it was the the men of
[58:07] the home the boys Men
[58:10] actually and many of them were
[58:13] married they come to greet the
[58:15] visitors and then this
[58:19] said and then the women come and they
[58:22] come with belts
[58:26] and then they come and put around your
[58:28] waist then they touch here then they
[58:31] start dancing around around
[58:34] around but you've never danced with your
[58:37] wife but you're dancing with a
[58:42] stranger you know and then until there
[58:45] was
[58:47] one the wife
[58:49] said you know those women can take your
[58:53] husband and she was really meaning
[59:00] so you need to avoid those kind of
[59:03] things you've never been able to walk
[59:06] with your wife in
[59:08] public but you busy with another person
[59:11] something
[59:13] wrong praise the name of our Lord even
[59:16] us when we are making functions in our
[59:18] home let us avoid those kind of
[59:22] things especially where you have
[59:24] authority
[59:26] why would they need opposite sex to come
[59:28] and meet in the front of
[59:33] the if it is really culture what kind of
[59:35] culture is
[59:38] that praise the name of our Lord so you
[59:41] need to avoid questionable
[59:45] things you know somebody is not trusting
[59:49] you and then there are others the TR
[59:53] comes from phones
[59:57] phones so one would rush very
[1:00:01] fast if the husband is in the
[1:00:04] bathroom or the wife is in the
[1:00:07] bathroom try to go who's calling what is
[1:00:11] on it
[1:00:13] here you know there are so many funny
[1:00:17] things until if they get it immediately
[1:00:21] they get whatever CH they suspect
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:26] either take a shot of
[1:00:28] it very F by the time you come out of
[1:00:31] the
[1:00:32] bathroom they already got the
[1:00:34] information they
[1:00:36] want you know even this man is cheating
[1:00:39] on me is cheating on
[1:00:42] me
[1:00:44] suspicion but the devil uses all those
[1:00:49] fronts you don't have peace at
[1:00:52] home that you don't have peace at home
[1:00:56] but you don't be like that we need to
[1:00:59] have trust for one
[1:01:01] another we need to have kindness one
[1:01:06] another praise the name of our Lord you
[1:01:09] know there was one said but why did this
[1:01:13] one come when I'm not
[1:01:15] there and then brought a
[1:01:19] complex but shouldn't be like
[1:01:22] that let us learn how to handle the
[1:01:24] challenges that we have at
[1:01:28] home and be
[1:01:31] open I don't know why I'm thinking like
[1:01:34] this oh am suspecting this and you be
[1:01:37] frank with one another and then you talk
[1:01:40] it over praise the name of our Lord and
[1:01:43] then you don't continue with that same
[1:01:45] thought propagating it propagating it
[1:01:49] yesterday I ask him for money he told me
[1:01:52] doesn't have but then now today I
[1:01:57] that somebody doesn't have and sent that
[1:02:00] person
[1:02:02] suspicion and all those things bring
[1:02:04] trouble at
[1:02:06] home that you know you cannot have peace
[1:02:08] at home but this should not be our
[1:02:13] families praise the name of our Lord we
[1:02:16] have Better
[1:02:18] Homes than read those kind of
[1:02:21] things now in the message he cares for
[1:02:24] you
[1:02:26] he says God gave man a
[1:02:30] wife to comfort
[1:02:33] him to touch
[1:02:38] him and any man
[1:02:41] knows that's a good that's a good wife
[1:02:45] that's got a good
[1:02:47] wife that there's something about a good
[1:02:53] wife then he said if a man be upset in
[1:02:57] his
[1:03:00] business or his walks of life and can
[1:03:04] come

[1:03:08] matter there is
[1:03:11] one he says there is one you know in
[1:03:15] other words you can get

[1:04:02] more
[1:04:03] fire yet you are meant to understand him

[1:04:09] colleagues the
[1:04:11] comfort you know
[1:04:14] understanding praise the name of the
[1:04:16] Lord so he says when a man has such
[1:04:19] troubles and he comes home the wife
[1:04:23] gives him comfort
[1:04:25] he says it's the way it's that way with
[1:04:28] me when I come from
[1:04:32] overseas somewhere and I am so
[1:04:41] nervous and
[1:04:43] upset and lot of
[1:04:46] sleep and hear the
[1:04:51] cry see the little hungry children on
[1:04:54] the street
[1:04:57] crying and going
[1:04:59] forth just kills me then when I come
[1:05:04] home if wife still sat down on the arm

[1:05:34] be a
[1:05:36] prison praise the name of brother was
[1:05:40] preaching on wedding
[1:05:44] inala and then he said you can see from
[1:05:46] outside very beautiful
[1:05:52] buildings but the person who lives there
[1:05:55] because when he enters there
[1:06:00] prison those should not be our
[1:06:03] homes Let There Be Joy Let There Be
[1:06:07] comfort then he
[1:06:10] says and just a few little parts from
[1:06:13] the
[1:06:19] wife means so

[1:08:22] other but there are people who are
[1:08:24] passing through a hard
[1:08:28] ministration very
[1:08:30] hard that you start saying God give
[1:08:32] Grace to that
[1:08:35] person there is an issue we trying to
[1:08:37] see how God can
[1:08:41] help right there
[1:08:43] in this
[1:08:46] brother is a whole head
[1:08:53] teacher now when he believed the
[1:08:59] message the wife the family is Seventh

[1:10:25] I don't believe there's any of us in
[1:10:27] that kind
[1:10:29] of I don't believe there's somebody any
[1:10:32] of us in that kind of
[1:10:34] station but there are people who live in
[1:10:36] that
[1:10:38] situation but they have to bear
[1:10:42] with you are heading a
[1:10:45] school and then they laughing at you
[1:10:48] head
[1:10:51] Master but you your that kind of
[1:10:57] so we need to see that we appreciate
[1:11:00] what God has given to
[1:11:03] us and not have the hardness of
[1:11:07] heart let that love for one
[1:11:11] another the desire for one
[1:11:14] another praise the name of the
[1:11:18] Lord say my time is running
[1:11:22] out let us go to First Peter chapter
[1:11:34] First Peter chapter
[1:11:36] 3 and then we start
[1:11:39] from verse
[1:11:42] 6 says even as Sarah obeyed
[1:11:47] Abraham calling him
[1:11:50] Lord whose daughters you are
[1:11:55] as long as you do
[1:11:57] well and are not afraid with
[1:12:02] amazement so the Bible says wives should
[1:12:05] obey their
[1:12:08] husbands and wives husbands should love
[1:12:10] their
[1:12:12] wives then verse seven likewise your
[1:12:16] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:12:23] knowledge giving honor to the
[1:12:27] wife as unto the weaker
[1:12:31] Vel and as being he together of the
[1:12:34] grace of
[1:12:38] life that your prayers be not
[1:12:43] hindered praise the name of our Lord
[1:12:46] that your prayers be not
[1:12:48] hindered so he says dwell with
[1:12:53] them in other words
[1:12:55] Let There Be
[1:12:57] Love Let There Be
[1:13:00] compassion let there be you know being
[1:13:03] patient with one
[1:13:05] another be considerate of one another as
[1:13:09] a husband and as a
[1:13:11] wife praise the name of our Lord as a
[1:13:14] husband and
[1:13:15] wife you know it shouldn't be like
[1:13:18] enemies living in the
[1:13:20] same and then you are in a marriage for
[1:13:22] convenience
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:34] no you are there for the
[1:13:37] husband praise the
[1:13:39] name but you know you see some families
[1:13:42] they because of the
[1:13:45] children but the children will go
[1:13:48] away and you know it is very
[1:13:51] funny there is a way mothers can win the
[1:13:55] children to their
[1:13:59] side now when the children have grown
[1:14:02] under well
[1:14:04] of they can take your wife from
[1:14:08] you just take her
[1:14:12] away you the father is going to die when
[1:14:14] he's
[1:14:16] alone just Beau for a good house
[1:14:19] somewhere
[1:14:21] there and then the father is in the
[1:14:23] house is collapsing
[1:14:26] as if he never
[1:14:28] produced used to TCH
[1:14:33] Mama there are some families like
[1:14:36] that and maybe when the children come to
[1:14:39] visit they give a special package to
[1:14:43] Mommy Mommy can change
[1:14:46] clothes but Dad has old
[1:14:50] shoes and you know at that time you're
[1:14:52] no longer working
[1:14:55] and maybe if you have not been in
[1:14:56] government you have no
[1:15:00] Pion now what can take care of
[1:15:03] you the children have abandoned you they
[1:15:06] on their mother there are some of some
[1:15:09] families like
[1:15:10] that then you start wondering what's
[1:15:12] wrong with the
[1:15:15] CH but you see we need to have that
[1:15:17] compassion for one
[1:15:20] another being
[1:15:22] considerate and then the Bible says in
[1:15:27] finally be all of One
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:35] mind you know one
[1:15:37] mind you think
[1:15:40] alike you have similar
[1:15:43] desires you have similar
[1:15:46] passion same
[1:15:48] direction praise the name of our Lord
[1:15:51] and then you can Edge
[1:15:53] together in happiness
[1:15:56] praise the name of our Lord and then you
[1:15:57] can have such a
[1:15:59] family that can encourage
[1:16:02] everybody you can have such an example
[1:16:07] family to your children praise the name
[1:16:10] of our Lord then he said having
[1:16:13] compassion one of
[1:16:18] another
[1:16:20] compassion why would you need
[1:16:23] compassion if you don't have any
[1:16:25] weakness because one or another you may
[1:16:27] make a
[1:16:28] mistake because we are still
[1:16:31] humans so now when one makes a
[1:16:34] mistake you don't use that person's
[1:16:37] mistake to crucify
[1:16:39] him no that's where you are
[1:16:43] needed to show
[1:16:45] kindness to show
[1:16:48] support and give that
[1:16:51] person
[1:16:53] encouragement then he says
[1:16:55] love as
[1:16:59] Brethren so you see that much as we may
[1:17:02] be husband and
[1:17:04] wife but we are Brethren at the same
[1:17:07] time praise the name of the Lord we are
[1:17:10] joint haers with
[1:17:12] Christ so as a
[1:17:14] husband you are a son of God as a wife
[1:17:19] you are a daughter of God so if you
[1:17:22] married the daughter of God
[1:17:25] tell me how will God think about if you
[1:17:28] mistreat
[1:17:31] her praise the name of like if you go
[1:17:34] and marry from the first
[1:17:39] family and then he you mistreating his
[1:17:44] daughter or you mistreating his
[1:17:48] son I don't think is something
[1:17:51] pleasing now how about God

[1:17:57] daughter you have God's
[1:18:01] son why would you miss God's
[1:18:05] child praise the name of our Lord you

[1:18:27] name of the Lord that's what Isaac did
[1:18:31] that's what Rebecca did when there was
[1:18:34] trouble in her
[1:18:35] womb then she inquired of the lord lord
[1:18:39] what is happening in me and then the
[1:18:42] Lord answered her we can also do the
[1:18:45] same thing when we have challenges at
[1:18:48] all when we have troubles at let us put
[1:18:51] it before the Lord in prayer

[1:24:55] chapter
[1:24:58] 6 and then verse
[1:25:08] one the Bible
[1:25:10] says children obey your parents in the
[1:25:13] Lord for this is
[1:25:21] right honor thy father and mother which
[1:25:23] is the first commandment with a
[1:25:30] promise that may be well with the and
[1:25:33] though may live long on the
[1:25:40] earth and you fathers provoke not your

[1:25:47] wrath but bring them up in the nature
[1:25:50] and admonition of the Lord
[1:26:00] praise the name of our Lord so we need
[1:26:02] to see that the
[1:26:05] Lord rules in the Affairs at

[1:26:12] raise them in the admonition of
[1:26:16] God we nurture them you know we disciple
