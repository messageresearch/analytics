[30:22] fine okay as we ordain have some
[30:25] ministers uh
[30:28] surely uh um I don't know the
[30:33] ministers and actually brother brandom
[30:36] said our our ordination papers are in
[30:44] heaven but uh I just want to ask then
[30:48] surely the Elders of the church brother
[30:51] brothers to really to come and we pray
[30:53] together lay hands on
[30:56] them
[30:57] we we understand that uh the laying on
[31:00] of hands is not uh uh giving a gift but
[31:04] recognizing
[31:14] a amen but before we do
[31:17] that and every church and every local
[31:20] church has
[31:25] a I want read one
[31:29] scripture actually that's a scripture of
[31:33] Isaiah then we will ask maybe their
[31:35] brothers with their families with their
[31:36] wives come one by
[31:42] one amen
[31:45] Isaiah I want to read that
[31:48] [Music]
[31:49] scripture we know that we sing an
[31:51] normally as an ordination
[31:56] song actually how Isaiah was
[32:00] there and you know all the scripture
[32:03] Isaiah 6
[32:06] verse1 Isaiah 6
[32:12] ver8 you know when Isaiah had to come to
[32:15] a
[32:17] realization and then realization of uh
[32:21] that he is an that he is himself not
[32:23] able to do that that
[32:26] job
[32:29] because Isaiah had said behold I a man
[32:31] of unclean
[32:35] lips but then God was sending forth the
[32:38] angel came forth with a fire of
[32:43] coal and I I trust the ministers that we
[32:45] are
[32:49] ordaining they have had that
[32:52] experience that had that
[32:56] experience
[32:57] that that uh that fiery cold touches
[33:01] their
[33:06] lips amen and then it was it said in
[33:10] verse
[33:11] eight also I heard the voice of the Lord
[33:16] saying whom shall I
[33:19] send and who will go for
[33:23] us then say it I that is Isaiah
[33:29] here am
[33:30] I sent
[33:32] me amen and this is actually what we are
[33:35] doing
[33:37] today here some some
[33:39] brothers they have F the call on their
[33:44] hearts and and I believe they have had
[33:46] all the
[33:48] experience of really that they have
[33:52] understood they are unworthy they cannot
[33:54] do it
[33:55] themselves
[33:58] and I I trust those
[34:00] ministers all had that
[34:02] experience that the fiery call has
[34:05] touched
[34:07] them amen what does the FY call a
[34:12] Ty the Holy Ghost touching our
[34:17] lives and when the Holy Ghost has
[34:19] touched your
[34:21] life then you ready for
[34:24] service you're clean and you're ready
[34:26] for service
[34:29] I I want to go before we
[34:32] start I want to I want to
[34:35] focus for those
[34:38] ministers on what are we sent out
[34:43] for now we pray for we ordain
[34:47] them and God will say the Whom Shall I
[34:52] sense and those three brothers here this
[34:55] morning this afternoon they're answering
[34:58] Lord here am i
[35:02] s so we join our hands of Fellowship
[35:06] together we pray as a church we pray as
[35:09] ministers as the Elders of the
[35:13] church pray for them and then they are
[35:16] ordained to go
[35:19] out to
[35:23] continue I want to really focus before
[35:25] we do that
[35:27] that you that is ordained
[35:30] now always
[35:32] understands for what are you sent
[35:36] for what are you sent
[35:38] for and what is your main
[35:42] purpose not building yourself a kingdom
[35:46] now you're building yourself a little
[35:48] nice
[35:50] Kingdom but you are sent out now for a
[35:55] purpose I want to go to what
[36:00] Isaiah prior to that
[36:05] ordination prior to the angels putting a
[36:07] call on his
[36:12] lips what Isaiah experienced in his
[36:18] life amen and this is so
[36:21] important that we have that
[36:24] experience amen that we have that and
[36:26] this is Isaiah 6
[36:29] verse1 you bring that up quickly before
[36:32] we
[36:33] go into the
[36:37] ordination praying for them and we have
[36:40] today brother Jeremiah
[36:46] muuga Church in B if I'm
[36:49] right then we have Brother Martin
[36:54] esala and then we have brother Wilson
[36:59] talena is that right you want to pray
[37:02] for them before that I want to read
[37:05] that please Isaiah 6
[37:09] verse1 that happened that happened to
[37:12] Isaiah the one that was that said
[37:15] finally Lord sent
[37:17] me that that is that happened to
[37:21] Isaiah the one that finally
[37:25] said sent me
[37:29] so now this as this afternoon we have
[37:31] three
[37:32] ministers they finally come to
[37:36] ordination other words here we
[37:39] are we want to be sent
[37:42] out and I just want to go to an
[37:44] experience that Isaiah
[37:48] has if you bring up Isaiah 6 ver
[37:52] one I think this is
[37:55] prior to that the angel with the fiery
[37:58] cold touched his
[38:02] lips amen and it says here in the year
[38:07] that King Uzziah
[38:11] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[38:17] throne and lifted
[38:22] up and his train filled the
[38:25] temple
[38:29] amen and then the whole story starts
[38:34] rolling amen amen and I trust those
[38:38] three
[38:40] brothers they have cut off from all arm
[38:43] of
[38:48] Flesh you see how that
[38:50] started it was in the
[38:53] year that King Uzziah died
[38:58] and Isaiah the young
[39:02] Minister was leaning on
[39:05] Uzziah but it was the
[39:07] year that the arm of Flesh
[39:12] died so Isaiah was focusing on
[39:17] Uzziah Isaiah was leaning on the arm of
[39:23] Flesh amen and it was in the same year
[39:28] that arm of Flesh
[39:32] died now
[39:34] Isaiah sees the vision of the
[39:39] Lord and it's so
[39:42] important as ordained
[39:45] ministers that we know we see the vision
[39:48] of the
[39:51] Lord because the vision of the
[39:54] Lord is what we are sent
[40:00] for not to bring our own
[40:04] Vision to bring to the
[40:07] people the vision of the
[40:10] Lord hallelujah you get it you get the
[40:13] picture so before you get
[40:17] ordained and and you understand even
[40:19] before the the fire of cold touched the
[40:22] [Music]
[40:24] prophets he saw the vision of the the
[40:27] Lord and even
[40:30] more and his
[40:33] train filled the
[40:36] temple brother rham
[40:38] said his
[40:41] train is
[40:43] Angels his
[40:45] train was his
[40:48] wig as we have seen in our
[40:51] day the vision of the
[40:54] Lord High and lifted
[40:58] up 27 miles
[41:02] high 30 miles
[41:05] across at that day at that day when the
[41:10] arm of Flesh cut
[41:13] off Isaiah said I saw the Lord high and
[41:16] lifted
[41:20] up I trust those
[41:22] ministers have seen in this
[41:25] hour the
[41:27] Lord high and lifted
[41:30] up and his train has filled the
[41:35] temple that is the vision of the
[41:39] Lord that when you go out ordained
[41:44] minister this is what you are sent
[41:48] for to bring to your
[41:50] church to bring to your church to bring
[41:54] to the
[41:55] people of the
[41:57] Lord hallelujah hallelujah I think that
[42:01] is so important that we understand
[42:04] that amen and when we seen the vision of
[42:07] the

[53:28] pastors but we we all are messenger
[53:32] Messengers in
[53:36] Christ and do we all have a
[53:39] vision amen do we understand what that
[53:42] vision
[53:43] is so many people go
[53:46] out and they go out without a
[53:50] vision so they go out and the Bible
[53:53] says without a vision
[53:56] Vision the people
[53:58] perish is that right without that
[54:03] Vision every church is
[54:06] perishing amen that's why the calling of
[54:09] the
[54:10] ministry it's like Isaiah was called
[54:13] into the
[54:14] ministry finally he could
[54:17] say Lord here am I sent
[54:21] me Hallelujah I trust that we can all
[54:24] say that
[54:26] I trust we all can say
[54:28] that that is that is the the power that
[54:31] thrives
[54:33] me amen you see maybe a man here that is
[54:39] preaching I was also a little boy I'm
[54:42] born in sin like you
[54:44] are but the product because I am what I
[54:48] am is because I saw the vision of
[54:52] the I saw what happened in our
[54:56] day I saw the Lord high and lifted
[55:00] up God cut all arms of Flesh away from
[55:05] me so that I could only lean on
[55:10] him amen and as I could only lean on
[55:14] in the vision of the Lord opened
[55:18] up I could see him 27 miles
[55:22] high 30 miles across
[55:26] the Lord high and lifted
[55:29] up and his
[55:32] train filled the
[55:34] temple this is what happened in our
[55:37] day so when we are ordaining
[55:41] ministers we ordained them for that
[55:45] purpose to spread that vision of the
[55:49] Lord to give the people in their
[55:53] churches their own IDE
[55:58] Isaiah could not be sent
[56:01] out as as he was leaning on
[56:05] the hallelujah amen God bless you all
[56:11] amen what a wonderful
[56:13] thing amen what a wonderful thing I
[56:16] trust we all can say praise the
[56:19] Lord amen and this is actually so
[56:22] wonderful how that develops into the
[56:24] next
[56:28] service amen it develops into the next
[56:33] service amen I didn't know how that
[56:36] worked out
[56:37] here I I didn't know really what I was
[56:41] expecting but I can see the Lord is high
[56:44] and lifted
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:50] up and his train fills the
[56:53] temple hallelujah amen God bless you
[56:57] all so we straight want to go into the
[57:01] words amen for this this
[57:04] afternoon I have a thought in my
[57:07] heart a very simple
[57:10] thought but it fits
[57:13] perfectly what happened in our
[57:15] day what happened to these
[57:18] men what happened to
[57:20] Isaiah what happened to him Hallelujah
[57:24] what happens to you what happens to in

[1:12:40] Grace let me read to you how brother
[1:12:43] brandham would would um pronounce it
[1:12:46] what Sovereign
[1:12:52] Grace
[1:12:54] and listen very
[1:12:55] carefully because this can solve every
[1:12:58] problem in a
[1:13:05] church this
[1:13:08] can every fliction that is amongst the
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:14] people and we know how quickly Satan can
[1:13:18] come like brother random would
[1:13:20] say this was the prophet
[1:13:23] and as he spoke to his own
[1:13:25] church he warned them he said we are we
[1:13:29] are a nice group of people
[1:13:33] now but Satan would try to destroy
[1:13:37] that brother Ram said either the
[1:13:40] government will
[1:13:42] come or the devil will come amongst
[1:13:46] us did Brother bam say that and we
[1:13:50] understand how quickly the we have seen
[1:13:52] the government that can come come Among
[1:13:56] Us amen The Government Can quickly can
[1:13:59] come and stop the
[1:14:02] service because of
[1:14:04] circumstances bring a separation amongst
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:07] people amen we have seen that but also
[1:14:11] the devil can come amongst
[1:14:13] us and the devil can cause afflictions
[1:14:15] amongst
[1:14:17] us amen the devil is specialist with
[1:14:22] that
[1:14:23] but but I think here is something so
[1:14:27] important that uh if we have that
[1:14:29] amongst
[1:14:32] us the devil has a very hard time to
[1:14:36] come amongst
[1:14:40] us he can try it but if we know some
[1:14:47] principles those
[1:14:49] principles don't allow him to come
[1:14:51] amongst us
[1:14:54] or even he can come amongst us and he's
[1:14:59] not
[1:15:01] effective brother random said we we can
[1:15:04] come to a certain
[1:15:06] place we can come to a certain
[1:15:09] condition to a position that Satan don't
[1:15:13] know what to do with
[1:15:18] us
[1:15:20] amen so each and everyone you can come
[1:15:24] to a
[1:15:25] condition you can come to a position
[1:15:28] that Satan don't know what to do with
[1:15:31] you and I tell you honest I want to be
[1:15:38] there I want the
[1:15:40] enemy to get
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:46] frustrated the enemy frustrated me so
[1:15:49] many
[1:15:52] times
[1:15:54] and now I want to frustrate
[1:15:59] him here's people amongst
[1:16:02] us they need
[1:16:04] medicine because of too much
[1:16:10] pressure is that right
[1:16:13] honestly I want the
[1:16:16] devil that he has to use his
[1:16:19] tablets because he has too much pressure
[1:16:28] hallelujah amen how can we get the devil
[1:16:32] under
[1:16:34] pressure he comes to you and he don't
[1:16:38] know what to do with

[1:17:03] screaming I can make I can make the
[1:17:07] sister be ugly to another
[1:17:11] sister but there's quick that forgiving
[1:17:16] Spirit
[1:17:17] you can
[1:17:19] drive Satan
[1:17:22] crazy
[1:17:26] now this is now not just some
[1:17:27] Pentecostal workouts you
[1:17:32] know I speak of
[1:17:35] realities the devil he didn't know what
[1:17:38] to do with
[1:17:40] Jesus he just didn't know what to do
[1:17:42] with him he could try what he
[1:17:45] wanted he could Pierce him he could
[1:17:48] knock him he could put a Thor of crown
[1:17:50] on his he could Market him and there he
[1:17:55] was he couldn't Market him he said come

[1:18:15] doing is it right church that frustrates
[1:18:18] the
[1:18:21] devil that frustration
[1:18:24] he can do whatever he
[1:18:25] wants you know why Jesus could do
[1:18:28] that because he

[1:25:20] throne watch David's story
[1:25:24] David's story so
[1:25:27] unusual but so
[1:25:31] typical so unusual and yet so
[1:25:34] [Music]
[1:25:35] typical you see now a prophet would come

[1:26:51] grace amen
[1:26:53] hallelujah
[1:26:55] hallelujah we see amazing reactions in
[1:26:58] the
[1:27:01] Bible allow me to dramatize a
[1:27:06] few because you know
[1:27:09] actually what we are in is God's Great
[1:27:15] drama I tell you
[1:27:17] something
[1:27:19] God
[1:27:21] loves drama
[1:27:24] comedy he loves
[1:27:28] drama yes he loves
[1:27:32] drama he he don't like it
[1:27:37] easy he loves
[1:27:43] drama
[1:27:45] amen see that from the
[1:27:47] beginning it was God
[1:27:51] himself
[1:27:53] opening the door in
[1:28:02] Eden it was
[1:28:04] God opening the door in
[1:28:10] Eden as he took
[1:28:14] Adam and took him away from his
[1:28:20] wife now Satan could sneak
[1:28:27] in because God God left God left the
[1:28:30] door
[1:28:31] open God wouldn't left the door
[1:28:34] open Satan had no right to
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] enter so God let the door
[1:28:45] open Adam was far
[1:28:47] away and now Satan was beguiling the the
[1:28:51] woman
[1:28:54] and normally Adam was a
[1:28:58] prophet but we understand God does not
[1:29:02] show everything to the
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:08] prophet So Adam would not see what was
[1:29:10] going
[1:29:12] on because God didn't show
[1:29:15] him and then when the thing was
[1:29:18] done and Adam came back and Adam came
[1:29:22] back and Eve was
[1:29:26] deceived now we hear
[1:29:28] God coming in the cooling of the
[1:29:32] evening into the
[1:29:34] garden and now Adam and his wife is
[1:29:37] hiding
[1:29:38] themselves where are

[1:30:00] drama God said Adam where are
[1:30:03] you and God knew exactly where Adam
[1:30:11] was
[1:30:13] hallelujah what why he was doing
[1:30:16] that because he needed the
[1:30:20] enemy he needed to do
[1:30:24] that so that God could
[1:30:28] express that he is a
[1:30:30] savior he is a
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:36] redeemer you see the drama that God is
[1:30:39] bringing
[1:30:44] [Laughter]

[1:55:51] be the womb of Jesus
[1:55:54] Christ
[1:55:57] born amen but that was a
[1:56:01] drama
[1:56:04] unfolding
[1:56:06] Hallelujah and remember as they drew a
[1:56:08] little
[1:56:10] closer and in heaven it was
[1:56:13] clear this is the hour where this
[1:56:16] prophecy
[1:56:18] is remember
[1:56:20] an elder came to
[1:56:22] John said don't cry John don't cry John
[1:56:26] was
[1:56:27] confused the Elder was not
[1:56:32] confused amen allow me to
[1:56:36] say In Heaven There are things easier
[1:56:40] clear than on
[1:56:44] Earth so
[1:56:46] Gabriel he is the announcing announcing
[1:56:50] Angel Gabriel
[1:56:53] understands this is the time now where
[1:56:56] this scripture of Isaiah is going to be
[1:57:00] fulfilled and he is a pronouncing
[1:57:04] Angel so he looks and he
[1:57:06] knows Mary is the
[1:57:08] girl and he's just on his way
[1:57:11] down to tell
[1:57:13] Mary you are the one God stopping him he
[1:57:18] said not now not now
[1:57:20] and Gabriel said why not God said to him
[1:57:25] it's not dramatic
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:36] enough oh I trust you get the the
[1:57:42] picture I just like it I cannot
[1:57:45] help because I see what God is doing in
[1:57:48] my life
[1:57:53] that's why I'm so glad that I'm saved by
[1:57:55] the grace of
[1:57:59] God now as now Mary was not engaged yet
[1:58:04] to
[1:58:06] Joseph she was just friendly with
[1:58:10] him
[1:58:12] amen and so God said to the angel no
[1:58:14] wait
[1:58:17] wait wait wait for a couple of days
[1:58:22] now then there came a day when
[1:58:24] finally Joseph and Mary
[1:58:28] decided we are we will
[1:58:31] marry and they call it betral that is to
[1:58:34] be engaged
[1:58:36] before is that right so they
[1:58:40] decided okay we going to get
[1:58:43] engaged they announced that in the
[1:58:46] temple Mary and Joseph are engaged
[1:58:53] now God said to
[1:58:55] Gabriel now
[1:58:59] go go now do your work and Gabriel said
[1:59:04] why now why not last
[1:59:08] week no no no no now it's more
[1:59:15] dramatic amen amen amen you understand
[1:59:20] it why is God doing that to confuse the
[1:59:28] enemy why is God allowing things in your
[1:59:32] life why is he allowing things in your
[1:59:36] life why did he allow
[1:59:40] Satan to walk into the life of
[1:59:48] joob
[1:59:50] he said Satan you can do whatever you
[1:59:55] want but his life you don't
[1:59:59] [Applause]
[2:00:02] touch what was God
[2:00:04] doing unfolding his
[2:00:08] drama and Satan were
[2:00:11] wondering I thought in the
[2:00:13] beginning that yob were just following
[2:00:18] God God has blessed
[2:00:21] him but now I
[2:00:24] know he's not following him because God
[2:00:26] has
[2:00:28] blessing because I took away all of his
[2:00:32] blessings and he's still following
[2:00:36] God finally Satan gets so
[2:00:39] confused said he even took away his
[2:00:42] health even brought his wife
[2:00:48] against
[2:00:53] and God looked at
[2:00:54] Satan said it's very hard for you to
[2:00:59] understand my
[2:01:01] drama and Satan said
[2:01:03] yes I don't
[2:01:09] understand amen come on Church it is God
[2:01:13] unfolding his
[2:01:16] drama at the end of the story me
[2:01:20] he will make the works of his
[2:01:23] enemy to praise
[2:01:26] him what a
[2:01:30] drama as Jesus died at
[2:01:34] Calvary as they was hitting his
[2:01:38] back and the stripes came on his
[2:01:40] [Music]
[2:01:42] back because of that
[2:01:46] wounds we are healed
[2:01:49] [Applause]
[2:01:50] what a
[2:01:55] drama
[2:01:57] Hallelujah and millions of
[2:02:01] people could
[2:02:03] confess in his
[2:02:06] stripes I am
[2:02:08] healed can we say that
[2:02:11] tonight in his
[2:02:13] stripes I am
[2:02:16] healed what a drama
[2:02:20] remember how they was hitting
[2:02:22] him and he had
[2:02:24] pain and Satan said
[2:02:27] yes he would not know that in those
[2:02:32] stripes we would be
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:35] [Applause]
[2:02:38] healed what a
[2:02:41] drama
[2:02:42] Hallelujah you know you know what Joseph
[2:02:45] and
[2:02:45] Mary it was so became so difficult
[2:02:50] because there was a law in
[2:02:52] Israel God gave that
[2:02:55] law God permitted that
[2:02:58] law amen there was two
[2:03:01] laws one law was for a
[2:03:04] virgin and another law was for an
[2:03:08] Engaged
[2:03:13] virgin amen so if a
[2:03:17] virgin is found pregnant
[2:03:20] is found
[2:03:22] pregnant then according to the
[2:03:25] law the man who pregnated
[2:03:29] her must marry
[2:03:33] her if he don't want to marry her he has
[2:03:37] to pay money to the
[2:03:39] father that's the law in
[2:03:42] Israel but when it comes to an Engaged
[2:03:47] virgin
[2:03:49] the law is
[2:03:51] different if an Engaged virgin is
[2:03:58] pregnant both of them the man and the
[2:04:02] woman has to brought
[2:04:05] before because now she is
[2:04:09] engaged
[2:04:10] amen
[2:04:12] amen and if she is not
[2:04:16] crying if she is not you reach your
[2:04:19] Bible if she's not crying why another
[2:04:22] man takes
[2:04:24] her she will put to
[2:04:29] death she be put to
[2:04:34] death come on
[2:04:38] church and Mary was not
[2:04:40] crying was the Holy
[2:04:42] Spirit pregnated
[2:04:45] her no you know what she said it be to
[2:04:49] me according to your
[2:04:53] word and she said
[2:04:55] that it means death to
[2:05:05] herself that's drama isn't
[2:05:10] it Satan never
[2:05:14] ever Satan never ever
[2:05:19] thought that the child would come from
[2:05:22] that
[2:05:24] way you know why God was hiding
[2:05:29] it in
[2:05:31] drama the drama was so
[2:05:34] good that Satan could not
[2:05:37] enter you can follow
[2:05:40] me the drama was so
[2:05:44] real that Satan spent not an idea
[2:05:49] to do what he had done in
[2:05:57] Eden
[2:05:58] Satan left Mary
[2:06:01] alone Satan left Joseph alone you know
[2:06:06] why because of
[2:06:09] drama
[2:06:11] Hallelujah so when drama is happening in
[2:06:14] your
[2:06:15] life don't get confused it is just
[2:06:20] God hiding you
[2:06:25] away
[2:06:28] Hallelujah we we are going deep to this
[2:06:31] evening but that's real
[2:06:34] life that will be maybe your
[2:06:36] future maybe your F your
[2:06:40] future will become
[2:06:42] dramatic maybe you go tomorrow to the
[2:06:45] doctor the doctor tells you you have
[2:06:51] cancer it can happen to me it can happen
[2:06:54] to
[2:06:55] you what do we do then stop
[2:07:00] crying no then start
[2:07:05] worshiping then tell him father you word
[2:07:09] said all
[2:07:11] things work
[2:07:14] together for
[2:07:16] good not all things are
[2:07:20] good but all things work together for
[2:07:24] good for them that love the
[2:07:28] Lord and if you love the
[2:07:31] Lord if love is
[2:07:35] projected Grace takes
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:41] over Hallelujah let me come to the close
[2:07:45] because we can go with Paul we can go
[2:07:47] with David
[2:07:50] but it's Sovereign
[2:07:57] Grace it became
[2:08:00] dramatic in the life of a
[2:08:04] girl her name was
[2:08:13] Ruth a husband
[2:08:17] died
[2:08:20] amen right yes yes a husband
[2:08:25] died became
[2:08:31] dramatic and then one
[2:08:34] day is
