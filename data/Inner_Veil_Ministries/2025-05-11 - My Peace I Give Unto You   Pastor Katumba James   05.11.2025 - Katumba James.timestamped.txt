[15:24] Let us pray. Father, how we are thankful
[15:27] aren't you Lord Jesus
[15:29] for the opportunity you've given unto us
[15:31] Lord that we [music] can come into your
[15:34] presence Lord and how you told us in
[15:37] your word that where two or three are
[15:40] gathered in your name you will be there
[15:43] in their midst and Lord you are you are
[15:47] here with us father may therefore speak
[15:49] [music] to us father the words of peace
[15:54] the [music] words of eternal life that
[15:56] we can find joy in your presence. Lord,
[16:00] may you release us from all troubles,
[16:03] from all worries,
[16:06] from all situations of [music] life
[16:09] that put us down
[16:11] that you may revive us again, heavenly
[16:13] father, and that your will may be done
[16:16] in our lives.
[16:18] Bless this service, heavenly father.
[16:21] Grant to hear everyone's heart's desire,
[16:23] Lord.
[16:25] and [music] grant your goodness upon
[16:26] every one of us even upon many who are
[16:29] not able to come to the Lord. We lift
[16:32] them also into your hands that your
[16:35] grace may reach unto them [music] far
[16:38] even those who are streaming heavenly
[16:40] father. We also commit them with your
[16:42] hands that your grace may reach unto
[16:44] them far and bless us all together for
[16:47] the grow of your holy name. In the name
[16:50] of Jesus Christ we pray and ask [music]
[16:51] this.
[16:53] Amen. Amen.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus
[16:56] Christ. [music]
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Let us turn to our Bibles
[17:01] in the book of John chapter 14
[17:06] and then we're reading from verse 26 to
[17:09] verse 28.
[17:15] Amen. Amen. The Bible says,
[17:20] &gt;&gt; "But the comforter, which is the Holy
[17:22] Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
[17:25] name, he shall teach you all things and
[17:29] bring all things to your remembrance,
[17:32] whatsoever I have said unto you.
[17:48] Peace I live with you. My peace I give
[17:52] unto you. Not as the world giveth, give
[17:56] I to you. Let your peace, let not your
[17:59] heart be troubled, neither let it be
[18:02] afraid.
[18:24] You've heard how I said unto you, I go
[18:27] away and come again unto you. If you
[18:30] love me, you would rejoice because I
[18:34] said I go unto my father for my father
[18:37] is greater than I.
[18:54] of his word.
[18:58] So I want to speak on the subject.
[19:02] My peace I give to you.
[19:05] Praise the name of our Lord. You know we
[19:08] are living in days where we have a lot
[19:10] of troubles.
[19:13] There are many stresses that come.
[19:16] There are many uncertainties that come.
[19:20] There are so many things that you know
[19:22] you find yourself you're going through.
[19:26] You start the day well
[19:29] in the course of the day you find
[19:30] trouble
[19:32] complete uncertainity.
[19:35] You know the Bible says
[19:38] according to the scriptures
[19:40] we are living in perilious times.
[19:45] And you know when you look at
[19:46] illustration of a perilious time
[19:51] the Bible says people shall be lovers of
[19:55] themselves.
[19:58] People shall be covenant breakers.
[20:04] People shall be only thinking about
[20:07] themselves nothing else.
[20:12] In the book of 2 Timothy chapter 3
[20:17] and then in verse one
[20:20] &gt;&gt; the Bible says this know also
[20:24] that in the last days
[20:27] perilious times shall come.
[20:31] And then he describes
[20:34] what brings the perilious times.
[20:39] Dangerous days,
[20:42] trouble days.
[20:45] Why? Because people shall be lovers of
[20:48] their own selves.
[20:55] You know they last after this, after
[20:58] this. They just not contented with
[21:00] anything.
[21:02] like now you get some of the villages,
[21:06] you get a rich man with a lot of money.
[21:11] He's owning a lot of land,
[21:14] but he wants to put the road to land
[21:16] through somebody's small land
[21:22] and they can afford to do the service,
[21:25] do the titles
[21:27] and then he fences it. Then he goes to
[21:30] the local authorities.
[21:33] You have to plan for me road.
[21:35] And then you get a poor person's house
[21:37] is all being swept out to create a road
[21:39] for the rich man.
[21:44] You know, no care,
[21:47] no concern about what your neighbor is
[21:49] going through.
[21:52] Like in some of these places which are
[21:53] here,
[21:56] somebody can build well his house.
[22:00] make sure that his water from his place
[22:02] goes through your your compound.
[22:07] And he said also you take care of the
[22:08] water
[22:11] can afford but the other one cannot
[22:13] afford
[22:15] but maybe wants this man to run away.
[22:19] And then there are others
[22:22] he can afford to buy the whole village.
[22:26] For if you are refused and you're in the
[22:29] middle
[22:30] you off
[22:33] perilious days.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[22:38] says boasters,
[22:42] proud,
[22:44] blamers,
[22:47] disobedient to parents,
[22:50] unthankful. [snorts]
[22:53] Regardless of what you do,
[22:57] just all the time murmuring,
[22:59] complaining,
[23:02] finding an excuse,
[23:05] finding something to criticize,
[23:08] finding something, you know, to to kind
[23:10] of rub rub off somebody or brush them
[23:13] off,
[23:16] you know. Then he says unholy
[23:21] without natural affection.
[23:25] You know they they don't have any
[23:28] feeling for anybody.
[23:31] It's all about them
[23:34] and if it's not about them
[23:37] should be none else.
[23:40] Praise the name of our Lord that we are
[23:42] living in. And then he says
[23:46] trust breakers,
[23:50] you know, false accusers,
[23:53] &gt;&gt; incontinent,
[23:56] fierce,
[23:58] despisers of those that are good,
[24:03] traitors,
[24:04] heady,
[24:07] highminded,
[24:09] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[24:12] God.
[24:14] These are the days we are living in. So
[24:17] then you find that trouble is
[24:19] everywhere.
[24:23] At home you may find trouble and if you
[24:25] are in a home where the husband and the
[24:29] wife don't relate at all
[24:34] travel at home
[24:36] maybe one goes to work and by come time
[24:38] coming home you are afraid. I don't know
[24:40] what they are going to choose me for.
[24:46] or they ask maybe they're going to ask
[24:47] me where have you been
[24:50] of all the good things
[24:53] there is only one mistake
[24:56] and one picks that mistake
[24:59] troubled lives
[25:02] we are living in such days
[25:05] like it was in the days of Noah
[25:08] the Bible says as it was in the days of
[25:11] Noah
[25:13] The Bible says in the days of Noah,
[25:17] people were violent.
[25:20] You know, they were imagining evil all
[25:22] the time,
[25:25] not concerned about the things of God,
[25:29] you know, just criticizing,
[25:32] maybe backbiting
[25:35] and all those kind of things as it was
[25:38] in the days of Lot.
[25:40] You know people only concerned about
[25:42] their interests.
[25:46] Praise the name of the Lord. We are
[25:48] living in this kind of days.
[25:51] But even in the midst of living in such
[25:54] times of uncertaintity,
[25:59] when the Lord Jesus was leaving,
[26:02] he told his disciples,
[26:05] "My peace
[26:07] I give to you. Praise the name of our
[26:10] Lord. In such times that we are living
[26:13] in,
[26:15] what we need is the peace of God.
[26:19] And let the peace of God
[26:22] be real in your life,
[26:26] not something you pretend about,
[26:30] you know, just something you try to
[26:32] form, you know,
[26:34] something that's not real.
[26:37] When the peace of God comes,
[26:41] it can come when you are even very sick.
[26:45] Everybody is saying you are going, you
[26:47] are going
[26:49] that peace holds you so firm.
[26:53] When everybody becomes hopeless,
[26:57] praise the name of our Lord, peace
[27:01] comes. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[27:04] may be locked up in prison.
[27:07] And then the peace of God just lures in
[27:09] your life.
[27:12] You know the peace of God has no bounds
[27:17] is not held by any circumstance or
[27:20] stration.
[27:22] He said my peace I give you.
[27:26] Let your heart be not troubled.
[27:30] We can go and look at John 16:33.
[27:35] The Bible says, "These things have I
[27:38] spoken unto you
[27:46] that you might have peace."
[27:50] Now, he's saying, "I'm speaking to you
[27:52] the word
[27:54] and the word that I'm speaking to you
[27:58] will give you peace."
[28:00] Praise the name of our Lord. It's also
[28:02] important for us.
[28:05] We have the word of God in our hearts.
[28:09] We have the word of God in your heart.
[28:12] And he said,
[28:14] &gt;&gt; I give you my peace.
[28:16] So he says, I've spoken you these things
[28:20] that you might have peace.
[28:24] Now you see the contrast here
[28:28] in the world. You shall have
[28:30] tribulation.
[28:36] Now he said in the world you're going to
[28:38] have tribulation
[28:43] you know but I have spoken to you my
[28:45] word
[28:47] that my peace may be in you.
[28:51] So even in prison
[28:53] you can have the peace of God.
[28:56] Even in sickness you can have the peace
[28:59] of God. Even when you are poor, praise
[29:03] the name of our Lord, you have the peace
[29:05] of God.
[29:06] So it is not dictated by circumstances
[29:09] you are going through.
[29:12] And you know the peace of God
[29:16] comes because God himself
[29:20] is right there with you in that
[29:21] condition.
[29:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[29:26] message to shall we go?
[29:29] Brother Brennham says, "If you ever got
[29:33] real peace,
[29:37] you've got Jesus.
[29:40] If you haven't got Jesus,
[29:43] you don't know even know what peace
[29:46] means
[29:49] until you come to him.
[29:52] I've seen people
[29:54] kings,
[30:00] &gt;&gt; great men,
[30:03] athletes,
[30:05] movie stars
[30:08] and all that.
[30:11] They are not peaceful.
[30:14] They can have the authority.
[30:16] They can have the money. They can have
[30:19] everything they want to have.
[30:24] Because peace
[30:27] comes from the prince of peace
[30:30] and if you don't have the prince of
[30:32] peace
[30:36] then you can't have peace. So then he
[30:39] says look at them watch their eyes a few
[30:43] minutes
[30:47] they are neurotics.
[30:50] See, no man,
[30:53] no woman,
[30:56] no child, no one can have peace outside
[30:59] of Jesus Christ.
[31:03] My peace I give unto you,
[31:07] not as the world giveth,
[31:11] not as the world gives peace,
[31:15] but he has eternal peace,
[31:19] a resting peace.
[31:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Even when
[31:24] you are sick,
[31:27] there is that peace that keeps you calm.
[31:31] Praise the name of the Lord. Even when
[31:33] you don't have money in your pocket,
[31:38] that peace that keeps you calm,
[31:42] even when you don't have a job,
[31:46] that peace that keeps you calm.
[31:50] Praise the name of the Lord. Even when
[31:52] the troubles around you are just so
[31:54] severe,
[31:58] there is the peace of God that holds
[32:00] you.
[32:02] So then he says, if you live,
[32:06] if you die,
[32:08] no matter if the rain comes
[32:12] or the sun shines,
[32:15] you have got peace anyhow.
[32:18] Praise the name of Lord. We need to have
[32:21] the peace of God
[32:24] that flows like a river.
[32:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Keep
[32:29] flowing. Keeps you going.
[32:33] Praise the name of the Lord. Somebody
[32:35] else may look at your condition
[32:39] with you. Look at that one. Why is he
[32:43] laughing? If he doesn't have anything,
[32:47] but there is the peace of God that
[32:48] surpasses all of us.
[32:51] Praise the name of the Lord. He makes
[32:54] you peaceful.
[32:56] He holds you sober.
[33:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Whether it
[33:03] rains
[33:05] shines,
[33:07] you have that peace.
[33:10] Praise the name of the Lord. Now the
[33:12] Bible says how the Lord will keep us in
[33:16] perfect peace.
[33:20] In the book of Isaiah chapter 26.
[33:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Isaiah
[33:27] chapter 26.
[33:31] And then we can read in
[33:34] in verse three.
[33:39] He says, "Though will keep him in
[33:42] perfect peace
[33:47] whose mind is stayed on thee,
[33:53] &gt;&gt; because he trusts in you.
[33:57] Trust ye in the Lord forever,
[34:01] for in the Lord Jehovah
[34:04] is everlasting strength."
[34:08] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[34:10] if you keep your mind
[34:15] you know you are trusting in him you are
[34:18] thinking about his goodness you
[34:20] appreciating him for even that he has
[34:22] done
[34:24] it says he will keep you in perfect
[34:26] peace
[34:28] and that's what we need to do in the
[34:30] trouble days that we are living in
[34:34] some of the things are not going the way
[34:35] you think they should
[34:38] maybe their businesses and they are
[34:40] failing.
[34:42] But the people don't have God.
[34:45] When they make a loss,
[34:47] &gt;&gt; they think that's the end of everything
[34:51] and they can commit suicide. But now for
[34:54] you, you will know
[34:56] I have one who is greater than all the
[34:58] things I'm
[35:00] praise the name of our Lord. He will
[35:03] keep you in perfect peace.
[35:07] You keep your mind,
[35:11] you keep your mind on God.
[35:15] You keep on thinking about the goodness
[35:17] of the Lord.
[35:19] Praise the Lord.
[35:22] Thanking the Lord.
[35:24] Praise the name of our Lord. There is a
[35:27] book I read.
[35:29] Praise the name of our Lord. I think it
[35:31] was 50 years in the church of Rome or
[35:33] something like that.
[35:36] There was a man,
[35:38] he was actually a criminal.
[35:42] And so that man there,
[35:45] they arrested him. Whether he was a
[35:46] murder, so they put him in prison.
[35:50] And when they put him in prison,
[35:53] during the time he was in prison,
[35:57] he got saved.
[35:59] And now because he was a murderer,
[36:04] he was meant to be killed.
[36:08] But then the person who witnessed to him
[36:12] went and pleaded with the king
[36:15] that was in one of the European
[36:17] countries there.
[36:23] So now he pleaded with him that please
[36:25] let this man not be killed. he has
[36:27] become better.
[36:31] So what the king had to do
[36:34] was to make sure that this criminal
[36:40] should be transferred to Australia
[36:42] because that's we're taking criminals
[36:47] and so they took him to Australia
[36:50] Australia but you know because he had
[36:52] been born again
[36:55] his conduct
[36:57] &gt;&gt; was completely
[36:59] pleasing to the prison wers
[37:04] whatever they would tell him he would do
[37:07] after picking this or this but he was so
[37:11] good to them
[37:14] until when he was in Australia
[37:16] they gave them to go and work
[37:20] and keep on working
[37:22] with all his heart doing whatever he
[37:24] would
[37:26] until the prison wers
[37:30] said this man is not worth to be in
[37:32] prison.
[37:34] He's a very good man. Then there they
[37:37] made him free as a citizen of the
[37:39] country.
[37:42] So he said,
[37:44] &gt;&gt; so there was mining on the coast of
[37:47] Australia.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, they were mining gold.
[37:52] But then for him go there try to look
[37:55] for whatever he would do
[38:00] in his mind
[38:02] all the time he was just praising God.
[38:07] His mind was always on God.
[38:10] He said one day he went to the sea.
[38:14] And when he was at the sea, he saw
[38:16] something glittering.
[38:19] And when he reached out,
[38:22] &gt;&gt; he went and found a big a big mold of
[38:26] gold.
[38:30] And that time whatever you get becomes
[38:31] yours.
[38:34] He got it and he was able to become one
[38:37] of the richest citizens in that country.
[38:41] But the whole thing was to accept Christ
[38:43] as your personal savior.
[38:47] God delivered him from sin
[38:51] and even delivered him from the natural
[38:52] prison.
[38:55] Praise the name of our Lord. We can
[38:58] learn to keep our mind on God.
[39:03] You know, regardless of the condition
[39:05] that you are going,
[39:07] maybe you have people at place of work
[39:11] who are against you. But what does the
[39:14] Bible say? Pray for them. Don't wish
[39:18] them evil.
[39:21] When you follow the word of God,
[39:25] the peace of God comes down.
[39:29] If you have issues against anybody,
[39:32] the Bible says forgive them.
[39:35] If you don't forgive them, then you are
[39:38] living under torment.
[39:41] So you cannot have the peace of God.
[39:44] You see, if you follow the word of God
[39:46] the way the word of God tells us to do,
[39:51] the peace of God will always come down.
[39:56] Somewhere the Bible says, if they smite
[39:59] on this side,
[40:01] he also don't smite back, but turn and
[40:04] they smite this side.
[40:07] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[40:09] Bible has told us he will keep you in
[40:12] perfect peace
[40:15] if your mind is stayed on God.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Psalms 119
[40:23] and verse 165
[40:32] and then verse 165.
[40:40] The scripture says,
[40:44] "Great peace have they which love thy
[40:47] law, and nothing shall offend them.
[40:57] Praise the name of our Lord. You get
[41:00] great peace
[41:02] when you love the Lord,
[41:06] when you delight in the word of God
[41:09] because the word is God himself.
[41:12] So you really want to be obedient to all
[41:15] the way the word is telling you.
[41:20] The Bible says
[41:21] you have great peace.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And nothing
[41:27] shall offend you.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; So then we need to see that we are
[41:34] obedient to the word of God
[41:37] and then the peace of God
[41:41] will always keep you
[41:44] stable.
[41:46] come as if nothing is taking place
[41:50] because the prince of peace
[41:54] is right inside of you.
[41:57] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[41:59] to see that the peace of God
[42:03] you know is always in our lives.
[42:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't allow
[42:09] things contrary to the word.
[42:13] see that you are obedient to the word of
[42:15] God.
[42:17] Follow what the word tells us to do.
[42:22] Praise the name of the Lord. That the
[42:24] peace of God may always be in us.
[42:30] Praise the name of the Lord. Now in the
[42:32] message against to whom shall we go,
[42:36] he says he is the only eternal
[42:40] happiness.
[42:44] and joy
[42:47] and peace.
[42:49] What more could I say?
[42:52] It is the only eternal joy,
[42:58] eternal happiness,
[43:01] eternal peace.
[43:04] My peace I give to you,
[43:07] not as the world give.
[43:12] Let not your heart be troubled.
[43:15] It is the only peace
[43:18] and only happiness.
[43:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So you just
[43:25] see that you hold him.
[43:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Just for
[43:32] him to be right inside of you.
[43:36] He says you might laugh like a loan.
[43:41] You might just go into hysterics over
[43:45] some movie star cracking a joke or
[43:47] something,
[43:50] &gt;&gt; you know, like, okay, now you see like
[43:52] we have this,
[43:56] we have these kind of, you know, people
[43:58] who try to make some kind of, you know,
[44:00] drama actors.
[44:07] I'm just forgetting the name
[44:12] like we have and others
[44:16] comedians
[44:18] you know people go and laugh
[44:22] you laugh so much
[44:24] but it can't bring you peace
[44:27] so you go and put on the joke like now
[44:29] Tik Tok you can go to one stream and you
[44:32] are on Tik Tok laughing the all day.
[44:37] Like some of them go to drink to have
[44:39] some kind of forget their troubles
[44:42] but the tr
[44:46] after drinking again you get back to the
[44:48] same person
[44:50] drugs
[44:52] you know. So the comedians can make you
[44:54] can crack jokes then you are laughing
[44:56] all the time.
[45:00] You can you can laugh
[45:04] when they are cracking a joke or
[45:06] something.
[45:08] But what is it?
[45:11] You are only making a noise.
[45:15] It soon wears off.
[45:20] You know, it's not eternal. There's no
[45:22] peace in it.
[45:24] In a few minutes,
[45:26] it's all gone.
[45:28] But when a man has come to a place
[45:33] where he has found the joy
[45:38] that there is
[45:40] of knowing that his sins are forgiven
[45:45] that he is dead and his life is hid in
[45:48] God
[45:51] through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost
[45:56] joy unspeakable.
[45:59] and full of glory in the power of the
[46:02] eternal God,
[46:06] knowing that you are resting satur in
[46:08] his love and grace.
[46:13] Whether the school keeps or whether it
[46:15] doesn't,
[46:20] what difference does it make?
[46:24] Praise the name of. So God alone
[46:28] gives us that true peace
[46:31] and you know that true peace comes
[46:35] when you read in Romans chapter 5.
[46:38] The Bible says
[46:40] &gt;&gt; that being therefore justified.
[46:46] Romans 5:1.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[46:54] We have peace with God
[47:00] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:03] So if you want that peace of Christ,
[47:07] Accept the Lord Jesus as your personal
[47:09] savior.
[47:11] Let him take away all your past sins.
[47:16] Be obedient to the word of God. Be
[47:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[47:22] Receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[47:26] Then the spirit of God himself
[47:29] will come into you
[47:32] and will bring that peace.
[47:35] My peace I give unto you.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Christ himself coming in our lives.
[47:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[47:45] message the minist I know
[47:49] he says
[47:52] Jesus might have said
[47:55] now in order to get back to the original
[48:01] God has to speak again.
[48:05] That's what he does when he gives you
[48:08] new birth.
[48:12] Your old life is gone
[48:15] and you are back to the original
[48:20] word of the Lord.
[48:23] If you are not,
[48:25] you are hybrid into churches,
[48:30] denominations.
[48:32] But when God speaks,
[48:36] he speaks and the Holy Ghost,
[48:40] then you are back in the original family
[48:43] of God.
[48:47] You don't have to be baby.
[48:51] You are a rugged Christian who can stand
[48:54] it.
[48:57] Praise the name of our Lord. This is
[48:59] where the challenge we can now be faced.
[49:03] Because we all go through trials.
[49:05] We go all through temptation.
[49:08] We go through testings.
[49:10] As children of God, we have to go
[49:12] through these things.
[49:14] We've got to go through them.
[49:17] When Christ himself is inside of you
[49:20] when Christ is not there,
[49:23] you fight along the way.
[49:26] You know, you'll give up.
[49:28] You'll say, "But this not what I
[49:30] expected.
[49:32] But he allows patience to come in our
[49:35] life
[49:37] to mold our character.
[49:40] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[49:43] have Christ inside of you,
[49:46] he says you go to the cross
[49:50] and to the cross was not something which
[49:52] was pleasant.
[49:55] It was sorrow.
[49:57] It was hardship.
[49:59] You go to the fairy furnace.
[50:03] It was not, you know, some refreshing
[50:05] thing which was there. It was fire.
[50:09] Praise the name of our Lord. It was a
[50:11] lion's den.
[50:13] It was not a picnic there.
[50:17] Praise the name of our Lord. whatever it
[50:20] may be
[50:22] because the word of the living God
[50:25] burning in your heart
[50:28] and your soul
[50:31] and all can backslide
[50:34] all can turn against you
[50:38] and everything else
[50:40] but that won't stop one thing
[50:45] that rugged word of God
[50:50] right there
[50:52] when he spoke that original voice into
[50:54] your heart.
[50:57] You are mine. Praise the name of the
[50:59] Lord. These are the consolations that we
[51:02] need.
[51:04] Where do I stand?
[51:07] Is Christ with me
[51:09] or I'm pretending that is not is
[51:12] you are certain.
[51:14] So now when the storms come, you know
[51:18] for sure
[51:21] and now when they were in the ship,
[51:24] you know, and then the storm was coming
[51:26] and the Bible says the wind was so
[51:29] strong
[51:31] and Jesus was in the back of the ship
[51:37] resting.
[51:39] And then for them there was the water
[51:40] was full in the ship.
[51:44] to awake him.
[51:47] You don't care that we perish.
[51:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the
[51:53] midst of the storm,
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus told the storm,
[51:58] "Peace be still." Praise the name of our
[52:01] Lord. That's what we need in our lives.
[52:04] Sometimes you're going through a
[52:05] terrible storm in your house.
[52:10] You know, you're going through a
[52:11] terrible storm at your place of work.
[52:14] You are going through a terrible storm
[52:16] in your life.
[52:18] You just need the prince of peace to
[52:19] come to that.
[52:22] Peace be still.
[52:25] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[52:26] know sometimes the storms come
[52:30] to clean you.
[52:32] Praise the name of the Lord. That's what
[52:34] happens.
[52:36] You know the storms come to make sure
[52:37] that the lake is clean,
[52:41] pushes the dirt all away.
[52:46] Praise the name of the Lord.
[52:49] You know there's no dust on water,
[52:52] [laughter]
[52:54] you know this garbage cans,
[52:57] the rubbish,
[53:00] broken things,
[53:02] and then the storm just comes.
[53:06] and then he pushes them outside
[53:10] and so when the storm comes
[53:13] you can learn how to pray.
[53:17] You know you are putting off those kind
[53:18] of fun lifestyle you've been doing.
[53:22] When the storm comes some of those
[53:24] friends who are not right can keep on
[53:27] going away
[53:30] start speaking bad about
[53:34] such that the codes are cut.
[53:39] You know the links you have with them
[53:41] are cut off.
[53:44] You know sometimes the lifestyle which
[53:46] is not pleasant,
[53:49] the storm just comes and this one is cut
[53:51] off.
[53:54] Maybe you are the person who used to
[53:55] spend a lot of evening with your friends
[53:57] in a bar.
[54:02] Now it comes you don't have money to go
[54:03] there.
[54:06] So you have enough time to go back home.
[54:10] storms come to clean us
[54:14] to put the house in order
[54:17] and when you call upon the prince
[54:22] then you've learned how to pray.
[54:25] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[54:27] to see that we have the peace of God in
[54:29] our life
[54:32] and let that peace lure in you.
[54:36] Praise the name of our Lord. In the book
[54:38] of Ephesians chapter 5,
[54:41] rather in Ephesians
[54:43] 2:14,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[54:49] &gt;&gt; "For he is our peace."
[54:56] Ephesians chapter 2:14,
[55:00] who has made both one and has broken
[55:03] down the middle wall of partition
[55:06] between us.
[55:15] Praise the name of our Lord. He says
[55:17] Christ is our peace.
[55:20] When he is inside of your life,
[55:23] he comes with his peace.
[55:26] He said my peace I give unto you
[55:29] as the world gives.
[55:31] So his peace
[55:34] you know comes and takes over in
[55:36] whatever condition that you are living
[55:37] in.
[55:40] So it's not it doesn't matter whether
[55:42] you in the lion is den
[55:46] of God like Daniel when he was thrown in
[55:50] the lion is den
[55:53] he was so calm. Praise the name of our
[55:56] Lord. He started running around shouting
[55:59] shouting around
[56:02] but he was so calm and he trusted in the
[56:05] Lord.
[56:07] And then Daniel said God has sent his
[56:10] angel
[56:12] and then the angel stopped the lion from
[56:14] doing any harm to Daniel.
[56:19] Praise the name of Lord. The four the
[56:22] three Hebrew children
[56:24] they were thrown in the fire. The son of
[56:26] man himself came down
[56:30] you know putting away the fire from
[56:32] doing them any harm.
[56:36] And that's what the peace of God does.
[56:39] Regardless of the condition we are going
[56:41] through,
[56:42] regardless of the situation that we are
[56:44] going through,
[56:46] his peace remains. Praise the name of
[56:50] Lord. And that should always be your
[56:52] desire.
[56:53] Every day you live. Sometimes things may
[56:56] not be working out the way you expected.
[57:00] Just have that peace of God.
[57:03] Praise the name of our Lord. Regardless
[57:05] of what you're going through,
[57:07] just see that you have the peace of God
[57:09] in you.
[57:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Colossians
[57:14] 3:15.
[57:19] Colossians 3:15.
[57:26] It says, "And let the peace of God rule
[57:29] in your hearts.
[57:38] Let the peace of God rule in your hearts
[57:46] to the which also you are called in one
[57:49] body
[57:53] and be thankful.
[57:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[58:00] that peace of God
[58:03] should rule,
[58:07] should govern.
[58:10] Praise the name of the Lord, should be
[58:12] taking charge,
[58:15] you know, the charge of the house,
[58:19] charge of the heart, praise the name of
[58:22] our Lord. Every decision you do,
[58:26] you do it after the peace of God.
[58:30] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[58:32] you do things based on what will the
[58:34] Lord Jesus Christ do.
[58:39] You know, you seek peace
[58:42] and then you follow it,
[58:45] you pursue it,
[58:47] you make peace.
[58:49] Praise the name of our Lord. People who
[58:51] are troubled,
[58:53] you're not going to start them how they
[58:55] can be totally different from one
[58:57] another.
[58:59] You know they are fighting
[59:01] and so when they are fighting you want
[59:03] to increase their fight
[59:08] peace maker
[59:10] to try to calm down the situation.
[59:14] Praise the name of our Lord because you
[59:16] have the peace. So you can only make
[59:19] peace
[59:21] when you have the peace. So he says that
[59:23] peace should lure in our hearts.
[59:28] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[59:30] we are called,
[59:33] you know, that we can be in one body
[59:37] and always be thankful.
[59:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[59:44] to Philippians chapter 4.
[59:49] Philippians chapter 4. Philippians
[59:53] &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse six.
[59:58] The Bible says, "Be careful for nothing
[1:00:04] in everything
[1:00:06] by prayer and supplication with
[1:00:08] thanksgiving.
[1:00:13] Let your requests be made known to God."
[1:00:21] Praise the name of God. He said, "Be
[1:00:24] careful for nothing."
[1:00:26] So now if you are not going to be
[1:00:28] careful for
[1:00:31] said make your request known to God.
[1:00:35] Put your troubles before God. Lord this
[1:00:39] is what I'm going through. Lord this is
[1:00:41] the situation I'm faced with. Lord come
[1:00:44] down to my station. I know as you keep
[1:00:47] on waiting on the Lord.
[1:00:50] He gives you the grace.
[1:00:52] Praise the name of our Lord to see that
[1:00:55] you are able to overcome the situation
[1:00:56] that you are going through.
[1:01:01] Mind is stabilized.
[1:01:06] Praise the name of Lord. And then he
[1:01:08] said, "And the peace of God
[1:01:12] which passes all understanding
[1:01:15] shall keep your hearts
[1:01:19] and minds through Christ Jesus."
[1:01:24] Praise the name of our Lord. If there
[1:01:26] anybody troubled,
[1:01:28] the Bible is telling us, put it before
[1:01:31] the Lord in prayer.
[1:01:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Bring it to
[1:01:36] the Lord.
[1:01:37] talk to God about it. This is what I'm
[1:01:40] going through. This is what I'm going.
[1:01:44] This is the trouble I have. This is the
[1:01:46] need I have. But when you put it before
[1:01:49] the Lord,
[1:01:51] you are trusting him that he's going to
[1:01:54] handle that.
[1:01:57] You keep on believing God.
[1:01:59] You keep on depending upon God.
[1:02:02] Praise the name of our Lord. You don't
[1:02:04] become panicky. I don't know whether the
[1:02:07] Lord is going to do this.
[1:02:10] Put it before him. He says, "And the
[1:02:14] peace of God
[1:02:16] passes all understanding
[1:02:20] keep your hearts and mind through Christ
[1:02:22] Jesus."
[1:02:26] But you see what the devil does, he
[1:02:29] always want to show your trouble.
[1:02:32] He want you to think about your travel
[1:02:35] something negative.
[1:02:38] But the Bible says in verse eight that
[1:02:42] whatever things are true,
[1:02:46] whatever things are true,
[1:02:50] whatever things are honest,
[1:02:53] whatever things are just,
[1:02:59] whatever things are lovely,
[1:03:02] Whatsoever things of good report,
[1:03:05] if there be any virtue,
[1:03:07] if there be any praise,
[1:03:11] you think on the things.
[1:03:14] Stop thinking about the negative.
[1:03:17] Stop thinking about your failure.
[1:03:21] Stop thinking that I don't think I'm
[1:03:23] lucky.
[1:03:27] you know, maybe I was cast,
[1:03:30] the family I was born in,
[1:03:33] that's not good.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So, where do you think about it?
[1:03:39] So, start thinking about things that are
[1:03:41] true,
[1:03:43] to the promises of God in the situation
[1:03:45] you are going through,
[1:03:49] thinking about that, meditating about
[1:03:52] that. Praise the name of our Lord. One
[1:03:55] day brother Brham was was was meditating
[1:03:58] upon Joseph
[1:04:01] and then he said how a good character
[1:04:03] Joseph was
[1:04:06] he thought about Joseph.
[1:04:08] Now when he kept on thinking about
[1:04:10] Joseph
[1:04:12] then the Holy Spirit told him
[1:04:15] you're going to bear a son and you're
[1:04:17] going to call him Joseph.
[1:04:21] Praise the name of our Lord. Positive
[1:04:23] thinking.
[1:04:26] When you are sick, don't allow the
[1:04:28] negative mind this one I'm going to die.
[1:04:33] I'm going to die.
[1:04:37] Be positive thinking.
[1:04:39] You know, think right.
[1:04:42] Think about something which is glorious.
[1:04:46] There's no glory in death.
[1:04:49] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[1:04:51] think about something that will bring
[1:04:53] glory to the Lord.
[1:04:57] Think about victory.
[1:05:00] Think about your healing.
[1:05:02] Think about your overcoming.
[1:05:04] You know, you think about things that
[1:05:06] are good,
[1:05:09] things that are pure,
[1:05:11] things that can bring glory to the name
[1:05:12] of the Lord.
[1:05:15] Don't go to the negative things.
[1:05:18] You know, my family
[1:05:25] Think about something which is true.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:05:31] the Bible says
[1:05:33] with that he will keep you in perfect
[1:05:36] peace.
[1:05:39] Praise the name of our Lord. And what we
[1:05:41] need is his peace.
[1:05:44] His only peace.
[1:05:46] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:05:48] message communion
[1:05:51] he says
[1:05:54] there is something about water
[1:05:59] something about refreshing.
[1:06:02] My point was
[1:06:05] to get the water
[1:06:07] when you are thirsty
[1:06:10] is something it does to you
[1:06:13] to get the water when you are thirsty.
[1:06:17] Now he said, "My peace I leave unto you.
[1:06:22] My peace I give you."
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Not as the world gives peace,
[1:06:29] but the way he gives you peace.
[1:06:33] His peace
[1:06:35] quenches our thirst.
[1:06:39] Praise the name of our Lord. If we are
[1:06:41] longing for peace,
[1:06:46] then let us refresh in his peace
[1:06:51] to know that we have peace with God
[1:06:56] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:07:00] He is our peace giver
[1:07:04] that quenches our thirst.
[1:07:08] Praise the name of
[1:07:10] See that you have the peace of God
[1:07:14] and the peace of God will keep you
[1:07:17] secure in every circumstance.
[1:07:22] It doesn't matter what you are going
[1:07:24] through.
[1:07:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[1:07:27] finish with Psalms 91
[1:07:32] and then verse one.
[1:07:34] He says,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; "He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:07:38] the most high shall abide under the
[1:07:41] shadow of the almighty.
[1:07:57] Now the thing is am I dwelling under the
[1:08:00] secret place of God?
[1:08:04] So if I'm under the secret place of the
[1:08:07] almighty God
[1:08:12] and that means that God is in my life.
[1:08:17] Then you have a confession
[1:08:20] that the Lord is my refuge
[1:08:25] and my fortress.
[1:08:27] My God in whom will I trust.
[1:08:33] So now you have God in you.
[1:08:36] The peace of God is there. The peace of
[1:08:39] God is there. The Bible says he will
[1:08:43] deliver you
[1:08:46] from the snares of the faller
[1:08:51] and from the noisome pestilence.
[1:08:55] Praise the name of our Lord you because
[1:08:59] he's right inside there.
[1:09:02] He takes charge over your security.
[1:09:07] Then he shall cover you with his
[1:09:09] feathers.
[1:09:11] and under his wings you shall trust.
[1:09:16] His truth shall be your shield and
[1:09:18] buckler.
[1:09:22] Then he said you not going to be afraid
[1:09:24] by the terror at night.
[1:09:28] You know thieves are coming.
[1:09:30] You can't even sleep at night.
[1:09:33] You just say Lord I commit my security
[1:09:35] into your hands.
[1:09:38] nor the arrow that flies by day.
[1:09:44] Like nowadays they don't use arrows,
[1:09:47] they use bullets
[1:09:49] and during day time you not see the
[1:09:51] bullet
[1:09:54] even those bullets
[1:09:56] I'm not going to be afraid.
[1:09:59] Praise the name of our Lord for the pest
[1:10:02] that walks in darkness.
[1:10:07] pestilence that walks in darkness
[1:10:13] like we had corona
[1:10:15] people afraid to touch surfaces
[1:10:23] even talking with somebody you fear
[1:10:24] going close to them
[1:10:30] moves where you can't tell
[1:10:33] but he says even that
[1:10:36] pestless that walks in darkness,
[1:10:40] the Lord protects you.
[1:10:42] Praise the name of our Lord. A
[1:10:45] destruction that waits at noon day.
[1:10:52] Then he says, "A thousand shall fall by
[1:10:54] thy side
[1:10:56] and 10,000 by the right hand."
[1:11:01] But it shall not come near you.
[1:11:05] Praise the name of our Lord. What a
[1:11:07] promise we have.
[1:11:10] So you can start asking yourself, how
[1:11:13] many have fallen around you?
[1:11:16] Have you been able to count 10,000?
[1:11:23] One by one. You find that even in our
[1:11:26] villages, we can't make those people.
[1:11:30] So by the time it reaches you
[1:11:33] say even 10,000
[1:11:36] 1,000
[1:11:38] why there is the protection of God he
[1:11:40] keeps around his children.
[1:11:44] Praise the name of our Lord. He keeps
[1:11:46] them secure
[1:11:48] the way he protected Job. That's how the
[1:11:51] Lord protects us. Praise the name of our
[1:11:54] Lord under his protection.
[1:11:58] We should have that confidence.
[1:12:00] The Lord will watch over me. The Lord
[1:12:03] will take care of me. The Lord will
[1:12:05] deliver me. The Lord will make me
[1:12:08] successful.
[1:12:09] The Lord will make me finish this
[1:12:11] journey.
[1:12:13] You are not looking at your abilities.
[1:12:16] If you're putting your trust in God,
[1:12:20] praise the name of our Lord. He says,
[1:12:22] "Only with thine eyes,
[1:12:26] verse 8, shall you behold and see the
[1:12:28] reward of the wicked
[1:12:34] because you have made the Lord, which is
[1:12:36] my refuge, even the most high, your
[1:12:39] habitation.
[1:12:49] Therefore shall no evil befall thee,
[1:12:55] neither shall any plague come near your
[1:12:58] dwelling place.
[1:13:03] Do you believe this?
[1:13:05] Amen. You take it. Lord, I believe this.
[1:13:10] And then you take it before the Lord in
[1:13:12] prayer.
[1:13:13] Maybe you're hearing troubles in the
[1:13:15] community where you live.
[1:13:17] Lord, this is your promise.
[1:13:20] You have promised this. You've promised
[1:13:23] this. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:13:26] so you believe the Lord that he's going
[1:13:29] to perform his word for you.
[1:13:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:13:34] to Psalms 46.
[1:13:37] And then verse one,
[1:13:40] the Bible says, "God is our refuge.
[1:13:49] a very present help in trouble.
[1:13:54] He said is very present.
[1:13:59] So once trouble comes
[1:14:02] know that he's already present.
[1:14:04] Tell it to Jesus.
[1:14:07] Talk to him about it. Lord there's this
[1:14:10] kind of condition. Lord there's this
[1:14:12] kind of stretch
[1:14:14] because he says he's very present
[1:14:19] when the trouble is there. That's one
[1:14:21] thing you should be sure when you see
[1:14:24] the trouble.
[1:14:26] Let it awaken you that God is present.
[1:14:31] Just be aware
[1:14:33] that God is present
[1:14:36] in whatever challenge you go through in
[1:14:38] life. Whatever you go through in life,
[1:14:42] just call upon the name of the Lord. So
[1:14:45] the Bible says, "Therefore we will not
[1:14:47] fear,
[1:14:49] though the earth be removed,
[1:14:53] though the mountains be carried in the
[1:14:55] middle of
[1:15:06] So the Bible says we shall not fear
[1:15:10] even if the earth you know you are
[1:15:13] standing on this ground
[1:15:15] and then the ground goes away from where
[1:15:18] you are standing
[1:15:20] the Bible says we shall not fear.
[1:15:24] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[1:15:26] says heaven and earth will pass away.
[1:15:30] So when the earth is passing away
[1:15:34] and the heaven is passing away, where
[1:15:36] will you be?
[1:15:39] Praise the name of our Lord. So be in
[1:15:41] the word all the time.
[1:15:44] The word will give you a firm base to
[1:15:46] stand
[1:15:49] your God. If it requires you to stand in
[1:15:53] the air,
[1:15:55] If he requires you to stand in the air,
[1:15:58] you'll stand in the air. If he requires
[1:16:00] you to be on the water, stand on the
[1:16:03] water. Praise the name of Lord. So then
[1:16:06] he says, let the mountains be carried in
[1:16:09] the midst of the sea.
[1:16:15] Let the wonders be there offer and be
[1:16:18] troubled.
[1:16:23] Just translate direct. Though the waters
[1:16:25] thereof roar and be trled,
[1:16:29] though the mountains shake with the
[1:16:31] straining they are.
[1:16:34] Praise the name, your confidence is in
[1:16:37] God.
[1:16:39] Let God be your peace.
[1:16:43] Praise the name of our peace of God
[1:16:48] completely l in our lives.
[1:16:52] And when you have peace,
[1:16:54] live in peace.
[1:16:57] Give peace to others
[1:17:00] in the name of our Lord, not troubles,
[1:17:03] not funny things,
[1:17:06] peace,
[1:17:07] live in peace, minister peace,
[1:17:12] and see that you give out peace to
[1:17:14] others.
[1:17:16] Praise the name of our Lord. He said,
[1:17:18] "My peace I give to you.
[1:17:21] And he has given us his peace. Praise
[1:17:24] the name of our Lord. And every day
[1:17:27] regardless of what we are going through,
[1:17:30] let the peace of God remain in our
[1:17:31] lives.
[1:17:33] Praise the name of our Lord. May God
[1:17:35] bless you.
[1:17:38] Amen.
[1:17:39] [applause]
[1:17:43] Let us sing that song down at the cross
[1:17:46] as we go to pray.
[1:17:48] 51
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Down at the cross where my sin be
