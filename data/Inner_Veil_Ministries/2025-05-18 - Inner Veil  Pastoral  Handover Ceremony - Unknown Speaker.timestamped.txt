[6:04] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[6:07] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[6:10] Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you very much.
[6:14] And clap for one Sunday school student
[6:17] today. Let's be seated.
[6:25] So us as parents and teachers we are
[6:30] living in the most dangerous
[6:33] times. We are living in the most
[6:36] challenging
[6:37] times where
[6:39] distractions and
[6:41] temptations are in every corner of our
[6:46] young people and constantly under
[6:49] spiritual attack. So the Bible tells us
[6:53] in the 2 Timothy 3:1, "But know
[6:58] this that in the last days, what will
[7:02] there
[7:02] be?" In the last days, what will there
[7:05] be? Perilious times will come. So if you
[7:10] are in a day that you feel you're being
[7:12] squeezed with issues of life, it is thus
[7:15] says the Lord, that's how it's going to
[7:17] be. Amen.
[7:20] This is the reality of this
[7:23] generation where the enemy uses every
[7:27] opportunity to target the hearts and the
[7:31] minds of the
[7:33] youth. Now more than
[7:37] ever, they need a sanctuary.
[7:43] They need a safe
[7:45] heaven where they can find
[7:48] peace, grow in faith, and be nurtured
[7:55] in God's word.
[8:00] Amen. We live in a time when from the
[8:05] moment we step out of our
[8:07] door, the world destruction is all
[8:10] around us.
[8:13] on the roads in the advertisements. As
[8:16] we walk here, other schools, our
[8:19] children are having great challenges
[8:21] even in our offices and even in our own
[8:26] homes. These distractions are
[8:31] designed. Does God love
[8:33] you class? Does God love you? Amen. Did
[8:38] he did he create this world in the
[8:41] perfectness of his himself? So God is
[8:45] perfect. Amen. So
[8:52] all things were created by him.
[8:59] You have a situation at home is not
[9:00] good. All things even that one God
[9:03] created for a purpose.
[9:08] Amen.
[9:11] So God has made a
[9:13] way for that generation to have a hiding
[9:19] place in the rock of ages.
[9:22] Amen.
[9:29] in the message God's own provided place
[9:33] of worship just to introduce it
[9:36] paragraph
[9:39] 78 God's
[9:41] 65128M paragraph
[9:44] 78 it say reads this but
[9:49] now we hear him say there is Only one
[9:53] place where he will meet man to worship.
[9:57] Not in my church, not in your
[10:01] church, not in your
[10:03] denomination, not in your ideas, but in
[10:06] one place. Amen.
[10:10] We read it right here in text. We'll
[10:12] refer it back back in a few minutes.
[10:14] Then if there's only one place that God
[10:18] meets man, we had better be very
[10:21] careful.
[10:23] Now let's lay aside our traditions.
[10:27] Underline that
[10:28] traditions this morning in this Sunday
[10:32] school lesson and be very sure that we
[10:36] find that one place
[10:39] because God has said here he will not
[10:43] receive you in any other
[10:47] way. Can I hear an amen? Amen.
[10:51] He will not receive you in any other way
[10:53] or any other place, any other church. He
[10:57] won't receive you in only in whose
[11:01] church.
[11:03] So let's find out where his church is.
[11:07] It's the only
[11:09] place where he'll receive you.
[11:13] Amen.
[11:16] Okay. I want us to find out something in
[11:19] this Sunday school class before I play a
[11:22] video for ask the children. Do you want
[11:23] to see a video of this messenger of this
[11:26] day? But hold on a bit. Uh let me let us
[11:30] read something
[11:32] uh more
[11:35] here.
[11:41] Okay.
[11:44] Right. Let's sing this song that our
[11:47] Sunday school we sing. This little light
[11:50] of
[11:51] mine, I'm going to let it shine.
[11:58] Amen. I'm going to let it shine.
[12:01] Hallelujah. This little light of
[12:05] mine, I'm going to let it shine. Let it
[12:10] shine. Let it shine. Let it shine.
[12:15] Amen. All right. Let's read the in the
[12:18] in the message. Goes on to provide
[12:19] presence. Later on, push it to paragraph
[12:22] 14
[12:24] uh 65 1128. We read this Sunday school
[12:27] class is a Sunday school. It's not a
[12:29] preaching, but we need to write notes.
[12:31] Okay. Then we see a video of what we're
[12:33] being told about. My heart shakes every
[12:36] time I think of it. Brother Palmer, I
[12:39] just climbed the steps up a few minutes
[12:41] until I got the message that was going.
[12:43] I just to believe it. Billy called me
[12:46] and somebody had got a hold and they
[12:48] knowed we are such lovely people. You
[12:50] are such lovely people. Clap for
[12:52] yourselves.
[12:55] I know that he he was gone is really
[12:58] shaking but we all go to God regardless
[13:00] of what we are. We must go on by one by
[13:04] one. But there's only one thing. Let us
[13:07] hear the conclusion of the whole matter.
[13:10] Amen. Fear God.
[13:13] Amen. And keep his commandments. Amen.
[13:17] For this is the full not half full duty
[13:23] of man.
[13:26] Yes sir. They says now I haven't got too
[13:28] much time for this Sunday school. Which
[13:30] is true. I have to go. I am horse me. I
[13:34] am nervous. I'm sweating. Sorry. So down
[13:37] there paragraph 17.
[13:40] Vag 17, it says,
[13:42] "Now, how many likes Sunday school?" My
[13:45] hand is up.
[13:48] Oh my, that's right. It's a good time to
[13:53] send your children

[14:11] right. Bring your children. That's
[14:14] right. To bring your children, you come
[14:18] also.
[14:23] There's no big amen there, but we have
[14:25] to have believe the whole world. All
[14:28] right. That's right. How many know
[14:30] that's how Sunday school was first
[14:33] originated? And this church is taking me
[14:36] back to our fathers.

[15:04] same message the the morning he was
[15:07] healed And then a prayer of N says
[15:09] greetings to all of you out across the
[15:12] lands. And I hear
[15:16] you are the one he was speaking. God was
[15:18] speaking to across the lands. Eh here in
[15:20] this wonderful place of life tabernacle.
[15:24] That's a good name. This is the inner
[15:26] veil tab here at Ginger with the whole
[15:31] jam crowned of Sunday school.
[15:36] You know, if I lived in Ginger, now
[15:40] saying nothing about anybody, but this
[15:42] will be a place I'd come to church
[15:46] right here at Innovail Ministries. This
[15:50] is not a
[15:51] denomination. Pastor Ibal, I know him,
[15:53] he's my father. This is not a
[15:56] [Applause]
[15:58] denomination tabernacle. They come out
[16:01] of the denomination because they
[16:03] accepted the prophet the message this
[16:06] message the prophet preaches. Amen. And
[16:10] we say thank you. So let us see a video

[24:18] school class. And uh let us uh now just

[24:24] did this guy tell us about the Sunday
[24:26] school? Uh uh in um in the in the church
[24:31] order 631
[24:33] 1226 paragraph
[24:35] um uh uh it I think is and so far I want
[24:41] to commend uh maybe just look and so far
[24:44] I want to commend
[24:46] uh it talks about the Sunday school. So
[24:48] say he said and so far I want to commend
[24:50] that brother Neva and you brethren here
[24:52] trustees and deacons and Sunday school
[24:55] superintendent. So Sunday school
[24:57] superintendent was a part of Brown for
[24:59] what you have done in helping this way
[25:02] and as who have been brought up by
[25:04] pastor since we were kids now we are
[25:07] grown up now we are working somewhere we
[25:10] are happy. Do we appreciate him? Let's
[25:13] give a clap for him. Amen. He's been our
[25:16] Sunday school superintendent, our
[25:18] pastor. He's been our helping guide over
[25:21] the years. And now you're here grounded
[25:23] in the word of God. It's something to
[25:25] worship and celebrate him. Amen. One
[25:27] more hand clap for our pastor as we
[25:29] celebrate
[25:31] him. And brother Brham has asked a
[25:33] question in paragraph 63. Now, Brother
[25:35] Brham, what about Sunday school? Brother
[25:38] Brham, about the Sunday school. All
[25:40] right. 63 says, "Yes, we've always had
[25:43] it that way. have the Sunday school just
[25:46] before the preaching service. That's why
[25:48] they had to call me. I'm sweating like
[25:49] this because they called me before. All
[25:51] right. And that gives a chance for the
[25:54] little fellas who attend Sunday school
[25:56] to dismiss their class if they want. And
[25:59] the little fellas don't understand
[26:02] it and they have to set all the way
[26:06] through the preaching service and then
[26:08] have a Sunday school. This is boring for
[26:10] us children, you know. But say the
[26:14] little fellas are on. Let the Sunday
[26:17] school be fast. Have a set time just as
[26:21] one set time for Sunday school. Go to
[26:24] session. Okay. Amen. And we happy for
[26:27] the leadership of our pastor. And please
[26:30] come all of you for Sunday school. It is
[26:32] important to have this class and have
[26:34] together. I hope uh the sound is good
[26:35] now. All right. I wanted us to do a
[26:38] class to do a video on a class but the
[26:40] sound has refused but we are not going
[26:43] to get deterred now I want good all
[26:48] right let's watch that video together
[27:14] Let's just be patient with them. Let's
[27:16] sing one more song. God's not dead. No.
[27:22] Oh, Sunday school class today. What's
[27:24] going on, my Sunday school? God's not
[27:27] dead. No, he's alive. God's not dead.

[27:38] alive. I feel him all over me. Let's
[27:43] start one more time now. The Sunday

[29:14] will definitely maybe postpone this
[29:16] class to another time. Oh, we're good to
[29:19] go. All right, let's enjoy the the
[29:20] video. my wife. Honey, this is brother
[29:23] Leroy and Paul Cop of Los Angeles,
[29:26] California. Delighted to have you in our
[29:28] home, brother Cop.
[29:32] Brother Brandham, in your two great
[29:34] campaigns at Los Angeles, at Calvary
[29:36] Temple, we noticed that the Lord Jesus
[29:39] Christ worked with you in a very special
[29:40] manner with these marvelous gifts, these
[29:43] earning of the spirits of men's hearts,
[29:45] as well as the sicknesses of their body
[29:47] and the signs of healing and miracles
[29:49] that were wrought. We thought it was
[29:52] wonderful. We're interested, Brother
[29:53] Brandham, in hearing more about this
[29:55] unique minister that God has given you.
[29:58] Very well, brother Cop. Let's go back to
[30:00] the beginning.
[30:02] I was born in eastern Kentucky in a
[30:06] little log cabin near Bertsville,
[30:10] Kentucky. The morning of my birth, I'm
[30:13] told of my
[30:15] parents that there was a light came into
[30:17] the room and hung over
[30:20] me. My people was not a religious
[30:24] people. They did not go to any church.
[30:27] Of course, this caused quite a stir
[30:31] among them. It's followed me all the
[30:34] days of my
[30:35] life. Recently, they took a picture of
[30:38] it in the scientific world as shown
[30:41] here. You're probably familiar with this
[30:45] picture. It was proven by science that
[30:48] it was the
[30:49] only supernatural being that was ever
[30:51] scientifically photographed. To my
[30:54] opinion, it's the same angel of
[30:58] God that followed the children of
[31:02] Israel
[31:04] from Egypt and to
[31:06] Palestine. You know, as a scholar
[31:09] yourself, that was the angel of the
[31:12] covenant, none other than our Lord Jesus
[31:14] Christ. And when here on
[31:17] earth, manifested in flesh, he did not
[31:21] claim to be a great person.
[31:24] He said the son can do nothing just as
[31:26] the father shows
[31:28] him. He in St. John the 5th chapter
[31:33] perhaps you're acquainted with it the
[31:37] scripture Jesus passed through this
[31:39] famous pool of
[31:41] Bethesda. He find many crippled people
[31:44] there blind halt lame waiting for the
[31:47] moving of the waters.
[31:50] It was strange that he just ministered
[31:51] to one. But if you'll notice, he knew
[31:55] where that person was. The father had
[31:58] showed him. He healed this one. Perhaps
[32:00] he he wasn't crippled. He was just
[32:03] laying on a pallet. But Jesus healed
[32:07] him. And then further in the chapter, we
[32:10] find about the 19th verse that he was
[32:13] questioned by the
[32:14] Jews. Perhaps it would be questionable
[32:17] today why God would pass through a place
[32:20] where all those people were lame and
[32:22] halt and blind and would not heal them
[32:25] all. But here I'll quote his words. He
[32:28] said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[32:31] the Son can do nothing of himself, but
[32:34] what he sees the Father do, this doeth
[32:38] the Son likewise." than according to his
[32:41] own
[32:42] word. His ministry was based
[32:45] upon visions from his
[32:48] father. Would not be strange then that
[32:51] his ministry should be carried on as he
[32:53] promised his disciples. The things that
[32:55] I do shall you do also. Greater than
[32:58] this shall you do, for I go unto my
[33:01] father. He said, "A little while and the
[33:03] world seeth me no more. Yet ye shall see
[33:06] me for I'll be with you even in you to
[33:10] the end of the world. Jesus Christ the
[33:12] same yesterday, today, and
[33:15] forever. I believe it's a confirmation
[33:18] in this last day of the resurrection of
[33:22] Jesus Christ living among his people,
[33:24] performing the same signs and wonders
[33:26] that he did when he was here on earth.
[33:28] At the age of seven, we moved from
[33:31] Kentucky to Indiana, up the road a bit
[33:34] from where we live
[33:36] now. We packed our water then from a
[33:39] well, some city block I suppose, behind
[33:42] the old country home.
[33:45] One
[33:46] beautiful September afternoon, while
[33:49] coming from the pump with some water, it
[33:51] was a stately popper tree stood about
[33:54] halfway between the pump and the home.
[33:59] Passing by there, there was a whirl of
[34:01] wind in the tree. What we call here a
[34:05] whirlwind. Why, it was nothing odd for
[34:08] that time of year in this part of the
[34:09] country, but it remained in the tree. It
[34:12] didn't leave. I stopped to see what it
[34:14] was, and a voice spoke from it, saying,
[34:18] "Do not never smoke or drink or defile
[34:21] your body in any way, for there will be
[34:23] a work for you to do when you get
[34:25] older."
[34:27] Frightened, that's not a word for it. I
[34:30] ran home quickly, telling my mother that
[34:33] a man spoke to me out of a tree. Well,
[34:36] she thought I was nervous. She put me to
[34:38] bed. But from then on, visions begin to
[34:42] come. And when this comes up on me, it
[34:44] produces a vision. I'm able to tell
[34:47] people what's wrong with them and what
[34:50] they must do in life and the sins that
[34:52] they are holding back in their life. At
[34:55] the age of
[34:57] 37, one night, I was praying in my
[35:00] room. And when I raised up, I noticed
[35:03] there was a light on the floor and
[35:06] looking around to see where it come
[35:07] from. It was coming from above.
[35:09] The pillar of fire was hanging just
[35:12] above restoring the light on the floor.
[35:15] I heard someone
[35:17] walking. I looked coming through the
[35:19] room. Coming into this light came a man
[35:23] and human figure. He had be about 200 lb
[35:26] of weight. He had dark hair to his
[35:28] shoulder and olive complexion. Is
[35:31] barefooted. Of course, I was frightened.
[35:34] And he said to me, "Fear not." And as
[35:37] soon as I heard that voice, I knew it
[35:39] was the same voice that had always spoke
[35:40] to me. But the first time I'd ever seen
[35:42] him in human form, he said, "I am sent
[35:45] from the presence of God to tell you
[35:48] that you're to pray for sick people.
[35:49] Great signs and wonders will be
[35:51] following your ministry, and you'll be
[35:53] praying for kings and monarchs and so
[35:55] forth." Well, I told him I was a poor
[35:58] man. I had no education. I would not be
[36:01] able to do this job. He said as Moses
[36:04] was given two signs of confirmation of
[36:06] his ministry that I would be given two
[36:08] signs. One would be the praying for the
[36:10] sick the miracles and the other would be
[36:12] you know the very secrets of the
[36:13] people's heart. I told him that I had
[36:16] been praying about this that the people
[36:18] told me that it was of the devil the
[36:21] ministry. He referred to me many
[36:23] scriptures such as when Philip found
[36:26] Nathaniel and Nathaniel came to Jesus.
[36:29] What Jesus told him where he had been,
[36:31] where he was under the tree when
[36:33] Nathaniel found him. And many other
[36:36] scriptures such as the woman at the
[36:38] well, how that she was revealed her sins
[36:41] to her. When Jesus told her that she had
[36:44] five husbands, she ran into the city and
[36:46] said, "This is the Christ."
[36:49] many other scriptures he referred
[36:51] to. I told him I would go. He gave me
[36:54] the assurance that he would be with me
[36:56] always. As you know, brother Cop, and
[36:59] the world knows of the great things
[37:01] that's been taking place in the
[37:03] ministry. We were thinking about whether
[37:05] these visions I would remember them very
[37:07] long. Some time ago, I had one about
[37:10] four years ago to be exact of a little
[37:13] boy being dead on the side of the road,
[37:16] struck by a car and killed. and he was
[37:18] to be raised from the dead. Well, I told
[37:22] everybody about it. Prophesied
[37:24] throughout the United States and Canada.
[37:26] Thousands of Bibles had it written on
[37:28] their fly leaf that this would take
[37:30] place. One day while we were having
[37:33] campaigns in the Scandinavian country,
[37:35] we were coming down through Finland from
[37:38] Kovio and there was a group of people
[37:40] gathered on the side of the road. They
[37:42] were hovered over some sort of a farm.
[37:45] We got out to look. There it was, the
[37:47] little boy. Everything has seen just the
[37:50] way it was shown to me. I said to
[37:52] brother Moore, "Look at your Bible and
[37:53] see if this isn't the scene." "Yes," he
[37:55] said. I knelt down and asked our Lord
[37:58] Jesus to confirm his word that he had
[38:00] showed me and had told me would come to
[38:02] pass. The little boy was brought to life
[38:05] again by our Lord Jesus. He's alive and
[38:08] healthy today. Brother Cop, this is just
[38:11] a few of the things that our Lord Jesus
[38:13] is doing today in the ministry that he
[38:15] has committed to me. To my humble
[38:18] opinion is to confirm his word, the
[38:22] things that he promised that would
[38:23] happen in this day we are seeing them
[38:25] take place
[38:28] today. Now, concerning the campaigns in
[38:31] Israel, Brother Cop, I'll be very happy
[38:34] to serve our Lord in Israel.
[38:37] I believe that my ministry will be very
[38:40] effective to the Jews because as the
[38:43] scripture says, the Jews seek signs, the
[38:45] Greeks wisdom. We believe many Jews and
[38:48] others there in the Holy Land will come
[38:50] to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[38:52] the Messiah when they see a Christian
[38:55] fulfilling the prophecy of Joel in the
[38:57] Old Testament.
[38:59] Yes, brother Cop, I'm sure that you're
[39:02] referring to Joel's prophecy in the Old
[39:04] Testament, Joel 2:28. how that he
[39:07] prophesied, saying that in the last days
[39:10] he would pour out his spirit upon all
[39:12] flesh, the sons and daughters would
[39:14] prophesy. The old man would dream
[39:16] dreams, and the young men would see
[39:19] visions. Well, brother Brandon, I guess
[39:21] we'll have to say goodbye for this time.
[39:22] It certainly has been a great pleasure
[39:24] and very
[39:25] edifying. We'll have to be running
[39:27] along, but we will see you, God willing,
[39:29] in Chicago in the next couple of days.
[39:32] Well, gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to
[39:34] have you in our home tonight. We'll be
[39:37] praying together for the success of the
[39:39] Chicago meeting, and by God's grace, I
[39:41] hope to meet you there in the next few
[39:43] days.
[39:46] Would you care for some teas if we're
[39:48] going? Oh, well, thank you very much,
[39:49] Mr. M. That'll be just fine.
[39:53] Thank you. Thanks, honey.

[1:11:58] I'm happy to see
[1:12:00] you. I'm happy to be in this uh meeting
[1:12:07] tonight
[1:12:09] and I don't know where to begin. I don't
[1:12:11] know why they chose me to be the first
[1:12:13] one.
[1:12:19] I I am the first
[1:12:24] born
[1:12:25] Steven's
[1:12:28] ministry and I think you allow you allow
[1:12:31] me to read a
[1:12:34] scripture
[1:12:35] and numbers
[1:12:39] chapter 27 Seven.
[1:12:56] Numbers 27 verse1 15
[1:13:01] says and Moses spake unto the Lord
[1:13:04] saying let the Lord the God of spirits
[1:13:07] of all flesh set a man over the
[1:13:11] congregation which may go out before
[1:13:14] them and which may go in before them,
[1:13:18] and which may lead them out, and which
[1:13:23] may bring them in, that the congregation
[1:13:26] of the Lord, be not asleep, be not sheep
[1:13:31] which have no
[1:13:33] shepherd. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:13:37] "Take thee Joshua the son of Non, a man
[1:13:41] in in whom is the spirit, and lay thine
[1:13:45] hand upon
[1:13:47] him, and set him before the priest, and
[1:13:51] before all the congregation, and give
[1:13:54] him a charge in their sight.
[1:13:58] and thou shalt put some of thine honor
[1:14:02] upon him, that all the congregation of
[1:14:05] the children of Israel may be obedient.
[1:14:09] Amen. And he shall stand before Eleazar
[1:14:13] the priest who shall ask counsel for him
[1:14:17] after the judgment of Urim. Before the
[1:14:21] Lord at his word shall they go out and
[1:14:25] at his word they shall come in both he
[1:14:30] and all the children of Israel with him
[1:14:33] even all the congregation.
[1:14:36] And Moses did as the Lord commanded him.
[1:14:40] And he took Joshua and set him before
[1:14:45] Eleazar the priest and before all the
[1:14:49] congregation. And he laid his hands upon
[1:14:55] him and gave him a
[1:14:58] charge as the Lord
[1:15:00] commanded by the hand of Moses.
[1:15:04] Amen.
[1:15:12] Alone. Alone.
[1:15:17] [Laughter]
[1:15:23] Alone.
[1:15:26] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign
[1:15:27] speech.
[1:15:34] [Laughter]
[1:15:47] forch.
[1:16:50] for Amen. Amen. I have another
[1:16:54] scripture in Deuteronomy
[1:16:57] 32 verse verse
[1:17:01] 71
[1:17:03] verse7 and Moses called unto Joshua you
[1:17:06] can paraphrase to save
[1:17:09] time and he said unto him in the sight
[1:17:12] of all
[1:17:15] Israel be strong and of good
[1:17:19] courage for thou must go with these
[1:17:21] people unto the land which the Lord hath
[1:17:24] sown unto and their
[1:17:29] fathers to give them and thou shalt
[1:17:33] cause them to inherit
[1:17:35] it. And the
[1:17:37] Lord he it is that does go before
[1:17:42] thee. He will be with
[1:17:45] you. He will not fail
[1:17:47] you. Neither forsake you. Fear not,
[1:17:52] neither be
[1:17:54] dismayed. And Moses wrote this
[1:17:57] law and delivered it unto the
[1:18:01] priests, the sons of
[1:18:03] Lev, which bear the ark of the
[1:18:07] covenant of the Lord and and all the
[1:18:11] elders of
[1:18:13] Israel. And then in verse 7
[1:18:16] uh 32 he says
[1:18:18] remember the days of
[1:18:21] old considered the years of many
[1:18:26] generations. Ask your
[1:18:28] father and he will show you thy elders
[1:18:33] and they will tell you. May God bless
[1:18:36] the reading of the
[1:18:37] word. Good morning everyone.
[1:18:41] We are here on a very special
[1:18:44] day, very special occasion
[1:18:48] uh
[1:18:49] that we have to
[1:18:52] witness of the handover
[1:18:56] um not because of
[1:18:58] anything but for the work of the Lord to
[1:19:01] to go
[1:19:03] ahead. I'm very happy
[1:19:06] uh to see the
[1:19:09] elders from various
[1:19:11] places. You're welcome and God bless
[1:19:15] you. Thank you for putting in all your
[1:19:21] efforts and your time.
[1:19:25] Uh the Bible says children honor your
[1:19:30] father and
[1:19:33] mother for many
[1:19:35] days for you to see many days and to
[1:19:39] live a good
[1:19:41] life. Praise God. I want to thank God
[1:19:45] for fulfilling that law in my heart, my
[1:19:47] life.
[1:19:50] I was born in
[1:19:53] 1950 at
[1:19:56] Amusadia
[1:19:59] district and in
[1:20:03] 1982. I was
[1:20:06] reborn through the
[1:20:08] gospel of my dear brother and pastor and
[1:20:15] friend, Pastor Steven Ibalari.
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:22] You know a person has three
[1:20:24] parents. You have a parents that give
[1:20:28] birth to
[1:20:29] you. You have a
[1:20:32] parents of your wife and of your
[1:20:38] husband and you have spiritual parents.
[1:20:45] Brother Steven
[1:20:48] and his
[1:20:51] wife were my past spiritual parents in
[1:20:54] the
[1:20:58] gospel. In
[1:21:01] 1982, I had gone to
[1:21:06] Busama 82. 1982,
[1:21:09] we went for a
[1:21:14] meeting and people
[1:21:18] preached, but Steven came and preached.
[1:21:22] had not known him but I watched his
[1:21:26] preaching and it impressed me so much
[1:21:30] after
[1:21:31] preaching I went to him and we
[1:21:35] talked then we became
[1:21:38] friends because we don't have time to go
[1:21:41] into
[1:21:42] details and he started coming to my
[1:21:45] place then one day he was going to Toro
[1:21:52] uh for a
[1:21:54] mission and I escorted him from my
[1:21:58] place. When we got to the
[1:22:01] bus then he told me brother do you know?
[1:22:06] I said no said God sent us a
[1:22:10] prophet. I said a
[1:22:13] prophet. He said
[1:22:15] yes. I said which prophet?
[1:22:19] Then he told me but this prophet has not
[1:22:22] been received by many
[1:22:26] people. I said why? He said they their
[1:22:30] teachings he
[1:22:32] gave but they are
[1:22:35] true. I said no I want to know that. Now
[1:22:39] he was in the bus and I was down.
[1:22:43] Yes. Then he because the bus was about
[1:22:45] to
[1:22:46] leave. So I said but brother don't worry
[1:22:50] I'll come and tell
[1:22:53] you. So he
[1:22:55] came home from
[1:22:58] Toro. He introduced the message to me
[1:23:02] and he told me so many good
[1:23:04] things. We are reading. We read about
[1:23:06] the godhead. We read about the serpent
[1:23:10] seed. We read about women
[1:23:14] preachers. But one thing that disturbed
[1:23:18] me was about the
[1:23:21] goddhead. But with time it got revealed
[1:23:24] to
[1:23:25] me. So we continued with
[1:23:29] brother and then we met
[1:23:34] brother. So we became
[1:23:37] three and we
[1:23:39] were just like uh I don't know what but
[1:23:44] the message was so special to
[1:23:46] us that anywhere we went we had to take
[1:23:51] the
[1:23:52] message and uh one strange thing
[1:23:58] is today you may look at brother Steven
[1:24:04] and see him the way he is but that is
[1:24:07] not the Steven who was
[1:24:10] then what was he
[1:24:12] then he wasn't a rich
[1:24:15] man Steven
[1:24:18] it even kept me
[1:24:21] astonished because Steven could walk
[1:24:27] from foot to come to where he
[1:24:31] was Steven could ride a bicycle
[1:24:35] Steven wasn't having
[1:24:38] anything and yet he he was coming from a
[1:24:42] good welloff
[1:24:45] family but he didn't mind about
[1:24:48] that. Now the message at that
[1:24:51] time was
[1:24:54] disliked. People would get books and
[1:24:57] burn them.
[1:25:00] And brother Steven
[1:25:02] chose to serve God with the message of
[1:25:06] the
[1:25:08] hour. And brother Steven in his life
[1:25:12] that he was
[1:25:14] living was very hard life
[1:25:19] friends. He didn't have a house. He
[1:25:22] didn't have anything. And sometimes you
[1:25:25] know I shed tears when I
[1:25:28] remember his own
[1:25:30] wife having one
[1:25:34] dress. At least me I could I I could
[1:25:39] earn because I was working
[1:25:43] with that was the
[1:25:45] life that was
[1:25:48] starting but he was so
[1:25:51] faithful and he had a
[1:25:54] camera. He had a camera that he was
[1:25:56] taking
[1:25:58] photos and this is where he would get
[1:26:01] some little some little
[1:26:04] bunny to feed the
[1:26:07] family. But then there's a testimony
[1:26:09] about
[1:26:09] that one day he carried those photos
[1:26:13] because he used to photograph then take
[1:26:15] them to
[1:26:17] Kenya across and the other side and then
[1:26:22] get the pictures back.
[1:26:25] But then he told me a story one time
[1:26:28] that he met a
[1:26:31] manuh he didn't know. He stopped him and
[1:26:36] asked him
[1:26:45] you you are a
[1:26:49] preacher. Thus says the Lord go back
[1:26:52] home. Don't worry. God is going to bless
[1:26:56] you. But don't don't don't keep moving
[1:27:01] up here. Just go back and God is going
[1:27:05] to bless
[1:27:06] you. Brother Steven came back and gave
[1:27:10] me that
[1:27:11] prophecy. Then he went back again. And
[1:27:15] when he went uh there was a trap laid
[1:27:18] for
[1:27:19] him and they I think they wanted either
[1:27:22] to steal him or to kill
[1:27:24] him. So he had to pass through a very uh
[1:27:29] special way to move out of the
[1:27:33] home. If if he has the time he will tell
[1:27:36] you or if you want he can tell you his
[1:27:40] testimony. Then he was saved narrowly.
[1:27:45] from wrong hands of those people in
[1:27:48] Kenya. He came back without the camera,
[1:27:52] without
[1:27:54] everything. And the stories are too
[1:27:58] many. How life started preaching the
[1:28:03] gospel. Sometimes brother tell me things
[1:28:08] that I would really not
[1:28:10] believe because he said one time he told
[1:28:14] me brother Ben do you know I said no. He
[1:28:18] says God tells me he's going to bless
[1:28:22] me. He said he's going to give me a big
[1:28:24] church.
[1:28:26] So I thought a big
[1:28:29] church when we are trying to preach in
[1:28:33] we had a convention one time in
[1:28:36] Toro where we are only
[1:28:39] 30 the whole national
[1:28:43] convention was having 30
[1:28:45] people
[1:28:47] honestly I didn't see ahead of
[1:28:51] us people believe like we
[1:28:56] believe and brother Steven was telling
[1:29:00] me you know brother Ben tells me I'll
[1:29:04] even go
[1:29:06] outside so I would hold my head I said
[1:29:11] enough go
[1:29:13] abroad abroad was something that we
[1:29:16] could not even think
[1:29:19] of but brother Steven was so faithful
[1:29:23] and was telling me this is what the Lord
[1:29:26] tells me. So this is how we moved
[1:29:32] together and with brother Steven he has
[1:29:35] been my
[1:29:38] mentor has been my
[1:29:41] mentor and at one
[1:29:44] time people started calling us I think
[1:29:46] the trinity
[1:29:52] They called us lots of
[1:29:55] names, briefcase
[1:29:58] preachers and all these
[1:30:01] things. Praise God. But I thank God when
[1:30:04] I
[1:30:05] see what he used to tell me all came to
[1:30:12] pass. Praise God. And that time when I
[1:30:16] mean 1987 85
[1:30:21] 89 it was very difficult
[1:30:26] friends you know the country was
[1:30:29] torn because of war we didn't have
[1:30:33] transport we didn't even these houses we
[1:30:35] now live
[1:30:37] in is just a miracle and it is a
[1:30:40] prophecy
[1:30:42] fulfilled so I I really thank God even
[1:30:46] for the
[1:30:47] protection. Praise God. Uh I don't have
[1:30:52] time but I want to chip in just a little
[1:30:54] thing that
[1:30:56] happened when we went to Congo. We went
[1:30:58] to four of
[1:31:00] us when we went four of us. His brother
[1:31:04] was
[1:31:05] brother him and myself. So uh we left
[1:31:09] them
[1:31:10] in and they were ministering. So me and
[1:31:14] we went ahead
[1:31:17] to GMA and then we I I went to
[1:31:22] witha
[1:31:24] and they came to they came from they
[1:31:27] came
[1:31:28] to GMA.
[1:31:31] But when we were there, brother was got
[1:31:34] a a message, a
[1:31:36] dream
[1:31:38] time and he he dreamed that you know the
[1:31:44] country was
[1:31:45] attacked, people were being
[1:31:48] massacred, people were dying. I was
[1:31:51] reading I was studying to go on to
[1:31:52] preach in the in the
[1:31:54] evening. So he woke he woke up and
[1:31:58] suddenly started telling me that story.
[1:32:01] I said, "Well, let us pray." We went and
[1:32:06] preached. And at night, we were supposed
[1:32:10] to go the following day to another
[1:32:11] another
[1:32:14] city. Now, I also got a dream and the
[1:32:18] dream was telling me, "Go
[1:32:21] back." And we said, "Go back."
[1:32:24] What? So, we we we the brother put us in
[1:32:28] his car.
[1:32:30] and we
[1:32:31] drove taking us to minister to another
[1:32:35] place and in brief we didn't reach the
[1:32:40] vehicle
[1:32:41] overturned. When it overturned, then we
[1:32:44] came back. We said, uh, we better not go
[1:32:48] because when we scrambled out, the
[1:32:52] natives of the land
[1:32:54] came and he tried to pick us
[1:32:58] up. But they put the vehicle back on the
[1:33:01] road and the vehicle was okay. So the
[1:33:05] pastor said, "Do we
[1:33:07] proceed or do we go back?" We say, "I
[1:33:11] remember the dream.
[1:33:12] I remembered what the brother had
[1:33:14] dreamt. I said we go
[1:33:17] back. So when we went back and put us on
[1:33:20] a
[1:33:21] ship, we made a ship. We came back to
[1:33:27] GMA. When we came back to GMA, I think
[1:33:30] brother Stephen either was preaching or
[1:33:33] what following day we came back to
[1:33:36] Kali. When we reached Kgali
[1:33:39] uh the brother pastor
[1:33:43] Vienna they said no brother Ben you
[1:33:46] people have not preached
[1:33:48] here we should preach you said no you
[1:33:52] should go back home so you can spend
[1:33:55] another day we said
[1:33:58] no boarded the ve the bus in the
[1:34:02] night we reached the border and when we
[1:34:06] got to the border It was so
[1:34:10] tight and we are wondering.
[1:34:14] Yeah. Was so tight. Then what happened
[1:34:18] when they let us when after they let us
[1:34:23] out they closed the
[1:34:28] border. We boarded the
[1:34:31] bus and we came home.
[1:34:36] The following day they
[1:34:39] announcing that rebels have
[1:34:42] attacked
[1:34:46] Randa and we
[1:34:48] said what a god we
[1:34:54] serve. It was much later after the war
[1:34:58] was almost over. Was he over?
[1:35:01] met pastor
[1:35:04] Vienna and Vienna gave us a
[1:35:08] testimony how they looked for
[1:35:12] us. They are saying we want those
[1:35:15] Ugandans who are
[1:35:19] here. That group
[1:35:21] went another group
[1:35:24] comes where those
[1:35:27] Ugandans I think it was the third group.
[1:35:32] when they could not get us that they got
[1:35:35] the
[1:35:36] sister because the brother was hiding
[1:35:39] under the bed.
[1:35:42] They got the sister and slaughtered
[1:35:46] her. And then the blood ran the brother
[1:35:49] says up to where he
[1:35:52] was. And when they went, he maneuvered
[1:35:55] his way
[1:35:57] out, brought into the to the border to
[1:36:00] the the
[1:36:02] airport and he flew to Kenya.
[1:36:06] I think he was staying with Pastor
[1:36:08] Kamat. God bless you so much.
[1:36:12] So uh I said our God is real.
[1:36:18] See he talked to brother
[1:36:21] was he talked to me but we couldn't
[1:36:25] understand but he still protected us
[1:36:29] until we came back.
[1:36:32] Friends, there are so many
[1:36:34] testimonies that we've gone through with
[1:36:37] the
[1:36:37] brothers, as a pastor, there are so many
[1:36:42] things and uh we appreciate God. We
[1:36:46] appreciate God for
[1:36:49] pastor is is
[1:36:52] rested. that these are
[1:36:55] brothers that have really stood with
[1:36:58] this
[1:36:59] message. I know, praise God. In the time
[1:37:04] past, I I didn't think as I have said, I
[1:37:09] didn't know this message would sweep
[1:37:13] over in the whole country like
[1:37:17] this. These
[1:37:19] brothers, they stood to bring in tapes
[1:37:22] and
[1:37:25] books. It was very hard to get books.
[1:37:29] We could get one
[1:37:30] book and saturate it
[1:37:34] around even copy
[1:37:38] it. It was a rare
[1:37:42] commodity and these tapes. We had what
[1:37:46] we call tape
[1:37:49] recorders. You people you are blessed
[1:37:51] now to have this message.
[1:37:56] There is nothing so special like this
[1:38:00] message. Now God has made it
[1:38:03] easy. You can download it for us. We
[1:38:07] look back and we see how we used to ride
[1:38:11] bicycles entering right into the
[1:38:14] bush. Brother is here. God bless you.
[1:38:19] And God is so wonderful. When we see the
[1:38:23] fruits coming out of it. Praise God. I
[1:38:28] don't I don't need even now to
[1:38:31] struggle at my age. Praise God. 75 years
[1:38:36] is
[1:38:37] enough. Let the younger
[1:38:39] people come in and carry the message up
[1:38:43] close. Praise God. Because this is what
[1:38:46] we desired.
[1:38:48] said that the message should reach
[1:38:51] out and it has reached out. So I pray
[1:38:55] that God will bless
[1:38:56] you. That was our
[1:38:59] lifestyle, the missionary
[1:39:02] trips. Praise God. The first plane I
[1:39:05] boarded was because of brother
[1:39:09] I to land in America. It was him who
[1:39:13] carried me
[1:39:15] there. Not selfish.
[1:39:19] people in
[1:39:21] Ginger, you are being so blessed. You
[1:39:24] see, in those times is when he he got a
[1:39:28] blessing to put this building. He didn't
[1:39:31] say, "Let me build my own
[1:39:33] house." Let me build a
[1:39:37] church come and
[1:39:40] worship. Oh, God bless you, brother
[1:39:42] Steven.
[1:39:46] We are most of us we are what we are now
[1:39:49] because of his
[1:39:52] ministry. When you get a
[1:39:55] revelation when he would get a
[1:39:57] revelation, he doesn't hide it, he will
[1:40:00] tell you and you look through the
[1:40:03] scriptures and see it is
[1:40:06] true. Praise God. I don't know what to
[1:40:10] say. We were down deep in the dust.
[1:40:14] Now we are moving on
[1:40:17] tyros. We didn't we didn't have
[1:40:21] ties. We didn't have ties. We didn't
[1:40:24] have
[1:40:25] cars. But
[1:40:28] remember this
[1:40:30] gospel goes with
[1:40:33] blessings. God cannot leave
[1:40:37] you in poverty. I remember brother
[1:40:41] Odipio when he was marrying
[1:40:43] He didn't have a wedding
[1:40:47] garment just ordinary
[1:40:50] dress and he was weded. Today if you
[1:40:54] want to wear a person you cannot bring a
[1:40:58] gass you you have to get a what a
[1:41:02] wedding
[1:41:03] garment them days just a few years
[1:41:07] behind
[1:41:08] here. It was a real hard
[1:41:11] life. We thank God for the gospel. Now
[1:41:17] tonight, praise God. I want also to
[1:41:21] thank you elders from different
[1:41:25] places that are standing with this
[1:41:28] gospel. God bless you so much. We
[1:41:32] respect the sovereignity of our local
[1:41:37] church. Let us remember.
[1:41:41] This is my last. Let's remember this.
[1:41:44] This gospel did not come to form a
[1:41:46] denomination.
[1:41:51] It came to prepare
[1:41:53] us to meet the
[1:41:57] Lord. Praise God. When you look at a
[1:42:01] brother in his
[1:42:04] capacity, receive
[1:42:06] him, you might know more than him.
[1:42:11] Praise God. But receive him,
[1:42:14] love
[1:42:17] him.
[1:42:18] Uh the young
[1:42:23] people. When Joshua got
[1:42:25] old, he said, "But there is more land to
[1:42:28] be
[1:42:32] acquired." Praise God.
[1:42:36] It is becoming very
[1:42:38] difficult if you are coming to think
[1:42:40] you'll be going
[1:42:44] abroad. It is becoming very tight.
[1:42:48] Countries are closing their
[1:42:52] borders. Our country still needs
[1:42:57] evangelism. That's my appeal to you
[1:43:00] young people.
[1:43:03] For us, we did evangelism
[1:43:06] everywhere. This church to begin, we had
[1:43:09] an evangelism on the other side. It
[1:43:11] started on street here in the
[1:43:15] school. Now we have
[1:43:17] churches. Young people, what are you
[1:43:21] doing? Praise God. I appeal to
[1:43:24] you, pastor, whoever is coming on whom
[1:43:29] they are going to hand
[1:43:31] over. Praise God. We are not handing
[1:43:33] over to you and then sitting back. No, I
[1:43:36] don't think brother Steven is doing
[1:43:39] that. He still has some energy to
[1:43:43] preach. Praise God. But he wants to
[1:43:46] offload his
[1:43:48] responsibility. He love too
[1:43:50] much. Even Moses, he said he chose
[1:43:54] men. He chose over 70 people to offload
[1:43:58] the
[1:43:59] work. And now as we grow into
[1:44:02] numbers, we need you young people and
[1:44:06] you ministers. Let us see eye to
[1:44:09] eye and preach the
[1:44:12] gospel. May God richly bless
[1:44:23] you. Do you appreciate Pastor
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:27] Beno? Amen. Amen.
[1:44:31] Immediately I want to invite pastor
[1:44:34] Emanuel and we shall have 10
[1:44:37] minutes and then maybe the home team
[1:44:41] that's brother Fred MV and brother
[1:44:45] sees in the afternoon instead of this
[1:44:55] morning. Yeah. God bless you.
[1:44:58] want to welcome you all to today's
[1:45:01] service. It is so special to
[1:45:05] us showing us the genesis of this place.
[1:45:10] I appreciate my
[1:45:12] pastor. It was 1986
[1:45:18] uh when we when he started the ginger
[1:45:23] church because back where brother B was
[1:45:27] talking
[1:45:28] about it was
[1:45:31] ina it was ina it was not in
[1:45:34] ginger so in ginger brother I
[1:45:39] comes I don't know whether it was 84 or
[1:45:42] 85
[1:45:43] five. But
[1:45:45] then me and and his
[1:45:49] wife, we shifted from
[1:45:53] Busam. I think it was in 86 either
[1:45:57] February or
[1:46:00] March. So we came to
[1:46:03] Ginger and we were staying in our uh
[1:46:07] mansion.
[1:46:10] It was really a big
[1:46:13] mansion a 10 by 10
[1:46:17] room 10 by
[1:46:20] 10 I think uh just near ginger
[1:46:30] essay in a boy's
[1:46:32] quarter school.
[1:46:37] So we were there
[1:46:40] uh it is now the person maybe to answer
[1:46:42] this
[1:46:44] question who was the song
[1:46:47] leader because what I remember I sat
[1:46:53] with his wife and he stood and
[1:46:56] preached he preached I don't know for
[1:46:59] what
[1:47:00] period after that he got his camera he
[1:47:04] goes out look for
[1:47:07] put. So that was the first
[1:47:10] church. Then uh he manage he managed to
[1:47:14] get when brother Mong came
[1:47:17] in brother
[1:47:21] Castas he got a nursery school where the
[1:47:24] other side is
[1:47:30] saturary schools now.
[1:47:34] So when we were there, I think we
[1:47:36] worshiped there. I think one month or
[1:47:40] two there was another powerful church
[1:47:42] also which came
[1:47:44] in. Our pastor could not pay
[1:47:48] rent. He was
[1:47:51] shocked. So again he had to look for
[1:47:53] another
[1:47:54] place. In that time we had got we had to
[1:47:57] go back to our original our mission.
[1:48:02] So you preach from
[1:48:03] there. Now we had somebody who didn't
[1:48:08] understand
[1:48:10] English. So now I had to stand in to
[1:48:15] interpret. Now I had my my
[1:48:22] patience so lovely to me.
[1:48:25] Now instead of interpreting what the
[1:48:27] preacher is
[1:48:29] saying I was attentive to my girl
[1:48:32] here then pastor PS you
[1:48:37] translate. So that was our church
[1:48:41] now because pastor was always
[1:48:44] aware in
[1:48:46] mission to
[1:48:49] patience. She thought I was her
[1:48:52] dad. So she always called me
[1:48:55] daddy. When I go to
[1:48:58] school, uh my obies come and say
[1:49:01] h you people you are joking
[1:49:05] with his daughter is crying for me.
[1:49:09] Daddy
[1:49:11] daddy and she was crawling towards the
[1:49:13] gate.
[1:49:17] So uh from there pastor got another
[1:49:22] place another church came and chased
[1:49:26] us. Lastly we ended up in ginger
[1:49:31] girls. So while we were
[1:49:33] there I could run from home come and
[1:49:36] prepare the
[1:49:38] place and then he comes and I song
[1:49:42] lead preaches. We go back
[1:49:46] Now one
[1:49:47] day uh it was he had preached about
[1:49:53] faith. So when he preached
[1:49:57] faith Monday
[1:49:59] morning I prepare
[1:50:01] breakfast it was
[1:50:03] porridge since he was tired. He was
[1:50:07] still in bed
[1:50:08] resting and all of a sudden
[1:50:11] patience because she was still
[1:50:14] crawling. She pulls the saucepan
[1:50:19] and it powers on her. Then mommy
[1:50:23] shouted. Then he asked what is it? So
[1:50:27] patience is
[1:50:28] burnt. Bring bring her here bring her
[1:50:31] here. and laid his hands on her, prayed.
[1:50:36] That was the end. No pain, no bruises,
[1:50:41] no
[1:50:44] nothing. So when we were in Ginger
[1:50:47] Girls, girls, I think
[1:50:50] 87 in the middle, more people were still
[1:50:54] coming.
[1:50:56] We had a brother the late now Pascal
[1:50:59] Amula,
[1:51:02] brother
[1:51:03] Tomi,
[1:51:05] Wilfreda, they came in. The church was
[1:51:08] growing. Brother Julius came
[1:51:11] in. Now while we were still there, there
[1:51:15] came up Calvary. I think something they
[1:51:18] were Koreans or Japanese.
[1:51:23] They also wanted a place for fellowship.
[1:51:26] So now the head ministries didn't know
[1:51:28] whether we stay in our block or he gives
[1:51:31] them the other
[1:51:34] block. The preacher there because he was
[1:51:37] white. He had good
[1:51:40] money. He promised to paint the whole
[1:51:44] school. But if I'm going to paint the
[1:51:47] whole
[1:51:48] school, there should be no church here.
[1:51:51] We were sent away.
[1:51:55] So we didn't know where to go.
[1:51:58] Now that time brother had come in with
[1:52:02] his
[1:52:03] family. So we went to his boy's court in
[1:52:06] his sitting
[1:52:08] room. That's where we were praying from.
[1:52:11] God bless brother and his family.
[1:52:15] So from
[1:52:17] there I don't know why but he became
[1:52:20] chairman management main street primary
[1:52:26] school. So he spoke to the head mad
[1:52:29] headmaster Mr.
[1:52:32] Mondo and they gave us a
[1:52:35] room and they gave us in the primary
[1:52:41] one we could reach there and play. Oh,
[1:52:44] before Main
[1:52:46] Street, after Ginger
[1:52:49] Girls, we went to Wuka.
[1:52:53] When you went to
[1:52:55] Waluka, you know, Wuka, that immediate
[1:52:58] school near tiptop.
[1:53:02] West. Yes. West. So, the church had gone
[1:53:07] to over 50 people.
[1:53:10] So I had also to leave home early
[1:53:15] morning come and clean the place and
[1:53:19] then the people come to have the
[1:53:21] service from
[1:53:23] there even uh in the shifting also there
[1:53:26] was also shifting of the
[1:53:29] home when we were in
[1:53:31] Wukuba there's a time when we were
[1:53:34] staying also in
[1:53:35] Waluba then we shifted to
[1:53:38] bug. So I could walk
[1:53:40] from come to west, clean the
[1:53:45] place. At times you could find the place
[1:53:47] too
[1:53:48] dirty that people defecated in
[1:53:52] it. And now
[1:53:55] once at times in the night it
[1:53:59] rains. So you come and you find the
[1:54:03] place the place is really terrible.
[1:54:08] But I could make all possible
[1:54:11] ways to make the place clean.
[1:54:16] So we moved on like that
[1:54:20] and uh when we came to main street
[1:54:23] uh we were staying in those uh lower
[1:54:29] classes and the chairs were really for
[1:54:33] babies. But the big people were the ones
[1:54:35] now sitting on
[1:54:37] us. But we thank God we were not people
[1:54:41] of the
[1:54:42] world. There were people of the other
[1:54:45] land who are not looking at the
[1:54:49] surroundings who are just looking at
[1:54:51] Jesus the
[1:54:52] word. Praise the Lord.
[1:54:55] I remember one time brother Castas
[1:54:58] preached he was talking about the
[1:55:01] zodiac and that's the time when sister
[1:55:04] Ledo came in and
[1:55:07] brother and it looked like things were
[1:55:10] the preacher either was
[1:55:12] confused looked like they didn't
[1:55:14] understand
[1:55:15] anything but they came the following
[1:55:18] Sunday they continue to come praise the
[1:55:22] Lord now from there I'm
[1:55:25] summarizing because there's too much
[1:55:29] uh while I was at
[1:55:32] school, pastor become became busy with
[1:55:35] the
[1:55:38] mission. So he trained me how to
[1:55:43] photograph and he got me that camera
[1:55:46] which you didn't need to
[1:55:50] focus. It is called Olympus Pen.
[1:55:54] So in senior 2 I started to
[1:55:59] photograph. I
[1:56:01] photographed at times I could get
[1:56:04] brother's
[1:56:05] bicycle. I go to
[1:56:07] primary. I go to
[1:56:10] secondary. I go
[1:56:12] to
[1:56:14] college. We are trying to make ends
[1:56:19] meet. Praise the Lord. Now from all
[1:56:24] there we were now planning for this
[1:56:27] place but there was no
[1:56:32] money. I remember when pastor went out
[1:56:36] in
[1:56:38] shells. Uh he called me when I was
[1:56:41] working in Victoria V
[1:56:45] hotel. Brother Fred Mv was the manager.
[1:56:51] And he says,
[1:56:52] "Emmanuel, what can I buy you from
[1:56:56] shells?" I told him, "You would buy me a
[1:57:00] keyboard, but buy me a
[1:57:05] guitar. Buy me a boxy guitar, I'll be
[1:57:08] able to play with play it."
[1:57:12] So I came back with a guitar. I was very
[1:57:16] happy. I song lead. I play the guitar.
[1:57:20] somebody we started even
[1:57:24] evangelism
[1:57:30] me we could
[1:57:32] evangelize we go
[1:57:35] to we were really doing the the best we
[1:57:40] could so pastor comes up with the mind
[1:57:44] we want to get our own plot
[1:57:48] Then I told him pastor
[1:57:50] how if we cannot
[1:57:53] survive? How are we going to buy a
[1:57:56] blood? Praise the Lord.
[1:57:59] So we believed and
[1:58:02] prayed. We believed and
[1:58:05] prayed and by God's grace we got this
[1:58:10] [Applause]
[1:58:13] place. Brother Mbe
[1:58:17] uh volunteered to look for mule
[1:58:22] trees. So pastor got him the
[1:58:25] money and he looked for those move trees
[1:58:28] in I
[1:58:31] believe because now the the uh the
[1:58:35] building was in
[1:58:36] construction and we needed now
[1:58:39] roofing. So we managed to bring I
[1:58:43] managed to bring uh timber
[1:58:46] We roof the
[1:58:47] place. Now we're
[1:58:50] struggling and the floor was
[1:58:54] mad. Pastor got some few
[1:58:57] benches. I don't know whether they are
[1:58:59] still around or the new generation has
[1:59:02] burnt
[1:59:06] them. So the brothers could see this
[1:59:11] side, the sisters could sit this side.
[1:59:15] And they were sitting
[1:59:21] on you know
[1:59:25] those ms which are real hard from the
[1:59:29] papyrus they call
[1:59:36] them. It is Mr. ins who used to call
[1:59:40] them like
[1:59:42] that. So that's how we are
[1:59:46] moving. So now it came to a time when we
[1:59:49] wanted to put in water to bring
[1:59:53] water and we place the pipes from down
[1:59:56] here to this
[1:59:58] place. But remember this place was so
[2:00:04] bad all the thieves from Ginger could
[2:00:07] hide
[2:00:09] here. The whole area
[2:00:11] here it was all
[2:00:14] bush. You could not pass that road there
[2:00:17] on a bicycle on foot by one by 7
[2:00:23] p.m. I told pastor you are building
[2:00:26] there but you are not going to
[2:00:29] manage. He said by the grace of God the
[2:00:33] church will
[2:00:34] stand.
[2:00:36] So when we lay the pipes pipe brothers
[2:00:40] had to volunteer to protect the
[2:00:44] pipes. Brother was one of them but very
[2:00:49] old but with the love of the church he
[2:00:53] volunteered. We were about I think
[2:00:55] brother brother how many were we about
[2:00:59] 20 about 20 brother Bill was were you
[2:01:03] there? Yeah brother Bill was around. So
[2:01:06] we were in
[2:01:08] shifts for watch for about one or two
[2:01:14] hours then you come and wake
[2:01:16] others so that they go you also sleep.
[2:01:21] There is a day it was really bad.
[2:01:25] It was brother
[2:01:27] John and brother John
[2:01:30] I don't remember with other two but John
[2:01:34] was so
[2:01:37] rough. You see police patrol was always
[2:01:41] parking at
[2:01:43] total. So now John we don't know what
[2:01:47] happened. John started uh lighting
[2:01:51] everywhere with a torch.
[2:01:55] Now police was scared. Said there could
[2:01:58] be people in that house in that church
[2:02:00] there. So police comes
[2:02:03] here and now John and
[2:02:06] I run away dis they
[2:02:10] disappear. Now they wake me up and
[2:02:13] brother I sleep with brother
[2:02:16] S and we didn't know what had
[2:02:18] transpired.
[2:02:21] So on going out with our
[2:02:24] torch police
[2:02:27] stop what
[2:02:29] is don't go back don't go
[2:02:35] stop now we said what what has
[2:02:38] happened so they told us hands
[2:02:43] up and then we walked towards
[2:02:46] them and they took us the petrol
[2:02:49] station What are you doing here? This
[2:02:52] place is dangerous. What are you doing?
[2:02:55] Then we told them the story. But who was
[2:02:59] lighting flashing
[2:03:02] everywhere? Said we were just woken up.
[2:03:05] We don't know who we maybe one of our
[2:03:08] friends. So where are they? Don't know.
[2:03:12] So we had to come back with
[2:03:13] them. They searched
[2:03:16] everywhere. But remember we had our B
[2:03:19] straight down.
[2:03:21] and we are putting on timber. So these
[2:03:24] guys were down
[2:03:31] there. So we went
[2:03:34] back. They interrogated all of
[2:03:38] us and they saw that we had a genuine
[2:03:41] reason but they wanted those two but
[2:03:45] they failed to see and we also didn't
[2:03:46] know where they had run.
[2:03:50] So it was really hard but we thank God
[2:03:54] at last we are
[2:03:57] here. Praise the Lord. At last we are
[2:04:01] here. I remember when we were staying
[2:04:05] in I think after pastor preaching
[2:04:09] in I think ministry primary
[2:04:12] school we had to walk to back
[2:04:15] home. We're just walking back home. from
[2:04:19] ginger
[2:04:20] town and we are
[2:04:24] happy. There's a time pastor could want
[2:04:28] maybe to get maybe like
[2:04:32] 100,000 but nobody could give him the
[2:04:35] money. One time he got some money. I
[2:04:39] think if you can rent a room here in
[2:04:41] Wyama road and we put a shopping can at
[2:04:45] least it can help
[2:04:46] us. When he gave the man
[2:04:50] money, he didn't he didn't give him the
[2:04:53] house and he left it. He's a polite man
[2:04:57] there. You just his money. But I think
[2:05:01] now today if that man is there, he's now
[2:05:03] asking pastor to give him a look.
[2:05:08] The other day pastor surprised
[2:05:11] me that some either two or three
[2:05:16] banks called
[2:05:18] him that pastoral you come. You see we
[2:05:22] see you are a capable
[2:05:25] man. You are
[2:05:28] enterprising
[2:05:30] enterprising. Uh you come and we give
[2:05:33] you money. We know you are able to pay.
[2:05:37] Hey pastor, when did this
[2:05:40] begin? The other time we wanted 100.
[2:05:43] Nobody was there to give us. Now today
[2:05:46] if you want 1 billion, we are ready to
[2:05:48] give you. That's the amazing
[2:05:52] grace. Praise the Lord. We thank God for
[2:05:56] pastor standing with the word. If he
[2:05:59] didn't stand for the word, we wouldn't
[2:06:01] be where we are. I am what I am.
[2:06:05] because of him.
[2:06:09] He didn't give me
[2:06:11] cash but he gave me the
[2:06:15] word. Praise the Lord. So this message
[2:06:19] is
[2:06:21] God. And if it is
[2:06:23] God, he is
[2:06:25] life. And where there is life, there is
[2:06:32] continuity. You cannot stay the same.
[2:06:36] Praise the Lord. He he has to show you
[2:06:39] have to show you are gaining something
[2:06:42] from God.
[2:06:45] We
[2:06:57] say you see a
[2:07:01] calf a calf will rejoice and
[2:07:05] kick because of the
[2:07:09] mother's. So if we are really God's
[2:07:12] children,
[2:07:13] We should rejoice in what he has given
[2:07:16] us because it is all
[2:07:21] powerful. It has all the
[2:07:24] potential to get you from to be with to
[2:07:28] sit with the rich people or the
[2:07:34] kings. Our new uh
[2:07:37] pastors where we
[2:07:39] minister. You are welcome.
[2:07:42] has been made a special day to speak
[2:07:45] about this
[2:07:46] ministry. This ministry has been here
[2:07:48] for
[2:07:50] us. When you look at this man here with
[2:07:54] a shining
[2:07:57] head, I don't know where the where the
[2:07:59] hair
[2:08:00] went, but that time when we started the
[2:08:03] church, he had plenty of
[2:08:06] it and he was a slender man. Either way,
[2:08:10] in senior
[2:08:11] 2, when I was in senior
[2:08:15] 2, you see my best shoe was butter
[2:08:23] slippers. I used it in senior one,
[2:08:25] senior 2, senior
[2:08:28] threeen with one trouser and one
[2:08:32] shirt, black and white.
[2:08:37] My badge was not sewn on the
[2:08:41] pocket because if it is sewn it means I
[2:08:45] will not have a shirt
[2:08:48] on. After school, I remove the
[2:08:52] badge. I keep it
[2:08:54] there. I go town. He got some
[2:08:59] money and he got a
[2:09:01] cooker which had an
[2:09:04] oven. So he trained his wife how to make
[2:09:09] cakes and we could bake
[2:09:12] cakes and I put in a box. I got tax
[2:09:17] park bus park selling those
[2:09:23] cakes. That was
[2:09:25] life in my
[2:09:27] sleeper. While at school
[2:09:30] lane we had either it was a communal
[2:09:33] home I don't
[2:09:35] know it was not a nuclear
[2:09:39] family you see nuclear family is father
[2:09:41] mother children but this one was for
[2:09:46] everybody one time ministers
[2:09:49] came around
[2:09:51] seven and we all squeezed inside
[2:09:55] there and the land lady asked mommy
[2:10:00] All these men coming from that
[2:10:02] house said yes. How did you fix
[2:10:07] them? Said they they they had to put
[2:10:10] their legs under the bed like
[2:10:15] this and it was all
[2:10:19] joy. The whole family of
[2:10:22] pastoral had one pair of
[2:10:26] slippers and that was my
[2:10:30] shoe. So whoever went to
[2:10:32] bathe had to use
[2:10:36] that. Praise the Lord. So one time said
[2:10:40] but this boy here he needs another
[2:10:43] trouser. He had got I think three
[2:10:47] trousers. So he he got one which was
[2:10:50] navy blue and said Emma you try that and
[2:10:54] when I put it on it could not go through
[2:10:57] the
[2:10:58] thigh. I was fatter than
[2:11:04] him because that time did I have any
[2:11:08] problem? No problem. Don't worry no
[2:11:10] nothing. So I was more heavier than
[2:11:13] him but he was the boss of the house. So
[2:11:17] that's how we live and that's where God
[2:11:20] has brought
[2:11:22] us. Now today we are happy to serve the
[2:11:27] Lord. Pastoral. Thank you very much for
[2:11:31] being there for every one of us. For
[2:11:33] most of us to see that you have shown us
[2:11:36] the way of the
[2:11:38] Lord. The word has been
[2:11:40] preached in hardship. It has not been
[2:11:44] easy but we thank God. Here we are. Let
[2:11:49] us be patient with
[2:11:51] God. Let us be patient with
[2:11:54] God. Most of the people we started
[2:11:57] with are all
[2:11:59] pastors. Pastor, thank you for being a
[2:12:01] good
[2:12:04] shepherd. Brother
[2:12:08] welcome. Brother Castas, you are
[2:12:10] welcome.
[2:12:13] uh brother, brother
[2:12:16] se those were the first elders in the
[2:12:19] church and we thank God you have been
[2:12:22] good and loyal to the
[2:12:24] pastor many have come from the ministry
[2:12:27] here and you who are here I believe you
[2:12:31] are coming also to follow
[2:12:33] us but what you have to
[2:12:36] do don't stay in the phone so
[2:12:41] in the
[2:12:44] computer. Face the
[2:12:47] book. Face the book. Not the other one,
[2:12:51] but this
[2:12:52] one. You see these ones here, they are
[2:12:55] good. When your
[2:12:58] mobile come to real
[2:13:01] studying, you need a hard
[2:13:05] copy. So, young
[2:13:07] ministers, hard copy.
[2:13:10] Get them. Brother Max is here. Let him
[2:13:13] supply you with
[2:13:14] books. Study and write in the
[2:13:18] book.
[2:13:20] Brother, thank you for this
[2:13:22] opportunity. You are not coming in a
[2:13:25] small place. You are coming in a heavy
[2:13:29] place because all of us we have to look
[2:13:33] to you now. You are becoming our father
[2:13:36] now. God bless you.
[2:13:38] [Applause]
[2:13:41] Amen. Do you appreciate brother
[2:13:42] Emmanuel?
[2:13:45] Amen. He said 10 minutes is not
[2:13:49] enough. So his 10 minutes became
[2:13:55] elastic. So I want to invite pastor
[2:13:57] Robert Kavas to be the last testimony
[2:13:59] before.
[2:14:04] [Applause]
[2:14:14] Thank
[2:14:16] you. I greet you all in the name of the
[2:14:19] Lord Jesus
[2:14:21] Christ. It's a great
[2:14:24] blessing to be together this
[2:14:27] morning. Amen. Amen. To witness a
[2:14:30] historical
[2:14:33] event. I have never attended this
[2:14:37] kind. I have never seen it
[2:14:40] before. So I I'm just trying to see am I
[2:14:44] doing the right way it should be done or
[2:14:50] not. Amen. Amen. But I want to
[2:14:53] appreciate
[2:14:54] God for the far he has brought
[2:14:59] us. He's a mighty God.
[2:15:03] Amen. Amen. And I want to say God bless
[2:15:06] you, Pastor Steven.
[2:15:10] Uh thanks for standing for the message.
[2:15:14] And I'm just uh one of the
[2:15:18] products of this
[2:15:21] ministry. Amen.
[2:15:25] Amen. Before I go further, I just want
[2:15:28] to
[2:15:29] say I want to thank the
[2:15:32] believers. for the believer's
[2:15:35] family at the country
[2:15:38] over and more specific to the inner
[2:15:43] ministries for the
[2:15:45] support, the
[2:15:47] comfort and the sacrifice you offered to
[2:15:50] us during the going away of our mother
[2:15:52] last
[2:15:55] month. Amen. Amen. We were so much
[2:15:59] blessed in
[2:16:01] history. This is the first time I've
[2:16:03] written a
[2:16:06] speech because I had too
[2:16:09] much and I wondered how what am I going
[2:16:12] to say? How am I going to say
[2:16:16] it? So I have written a
[2:16:19] speech and here it
[2:16:22] goes. Amen. Amen. In
[2:16:26] 1990 as a
[2:16:28] student I had in my ears the ever first
[2:16:31] utterance of the message of the
[2:16:35] hour and the name of brother William
[2:16:38] Marion
[2:16:40] Branham. It was through the motto lips
[2:16:43] of our beloved pastor
[2:16:50] Steven. I had never I never
[2:16:54] I had
[2:16:55] never heard about the
[2:16:58] message until by divine leadership
[2:17:03] uh in a primary school
[2:17:07] called I listened to the ever
[2:17:10] captivating message to a wandering s of
[2:17:12] a little boy in
[2:17:19] shorts and that set a fire burning
[2:17:23] to
[2:17:28] date. A gospel
[2:17:31] teacher with a piece of chalk on the
[2:17:34] black
[2:17:36] body was seriously speaking the word to
[2:17:39] a little attentive flock of about 20
[2:17:42] people
[2:17:48] estimated. Zechariah 4:10 tells us
[2:17:53] For who has despised the day of smaller
[2:17:57] things? It was so
[2:18:00] small, so powerful and so
[2:18:04] great. Not long after
[2:18:07] that, a younger minister by the name of
[2:18:10] brother
[2:18:14] Emanuela was introduced to me by a
[2:18:16] precious brother, Michael Kasamba.
[2:18:19] [Music]
[2:18:23] And I was led to the river for baptism
[2:18:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:30] Christ. Moving from the house of a
[2:18:32] brother
[2:18:34] [Music]
[2:18:36] called. Amen. Amen. I said I'm trying to
[2:18:40] see how brief I can be.
[2:18:45] In
[2:18:47] 1995 is when I again reunited with a
[2:18:50] long gospel teaching after
[2:18:55] school and shortly I was invited for the
[2:18:58] first time to minister in the presence
[2:19:00] of pastor Freeman in the mother church
[2:19:02] of Ginger Loco Christian Assembly as was
[2:19:05] called then.
[2:19:19] walking,
[2:19:21] preaching under this
[2:19:24] ministry. So inspired
[2:19:27] me that the gospel fire was burning at
[2:19:30] the place of work.
[2:19:34] Pastor kept following us
[2:19:37] up in those little
[2:19:39] groups, preaching to us
[2:19:43] in a pattern that has never
[2:19:47] stopped with every staggering
[2:19:53] income. My hands have been held from
[2:19:56] deep
[2:19:58] grass to grace untold.
[2:20:03] [Applause]
[2:20:05] I remember one time when I was teaching
[2:20:07] here in Sunday school,
[2:20:11] I used to ride a bicycle to come to
[2:20:15] Ginger. Uh pastor had now given me grace
[2:20:20] to minister as a Sunday school
[2:20:24] teacher. Sunday school. I came always
[2:20:27] very
[2:20:28] early, packed the bicycle out
[2:20:31] there. Uh, little did I know that one of
[2:20:35] the believers whom I shook hands
[2:20:39] with before I entered was interested in
[2:20:42] the
[2:20:43] bicycle. So as I came to
[2:20:46] preach, I think it was sister faith who
[2:20:49] told me he saw the person I shook hands
[2:20:51] with also going with the gospel.
[2:20:59] So after preaching, service went on. I
[2:21:03] didn't know what was going on. When
[2:21:05] everybody started to go home, that's
[2:21:08] when I realized I didn't have
[2:21:13] transport. Pastor stood with
[2:21:16] me. That bicycle, I don't have the
[2:21:18] stories talk about it.
[2:21:23] But we had to find a way of going back
[2:21:26] home. He supported me, got me a new
[2:21:30] bicycle. Uh, getting
[2:21:33] married. It has its own
[2:21:37] stories. We got married. I got married
[2:21:40] to a lovely sister, Juliet Modo. I think
[2:21:43] she's around
[2:21:46] maybe. But yeah, she's behind there.
[2:21:52] during our
[2:21:53] marriage like the way brother has
[2:21:55] described the incomes we had
[2:21:59] uh he was the best
[2:22:04] man pastor had a
[2:22:07] vehicle. It was the only vehicle I had
[2:22:10] on the on the function.
[2:22:13] It carried me,
[2:22:16] my wife and then a maid
[2:22:22] strictly. And that was the the
[2:22:25] wedding because we introduced and
[2:22:27] married the very
[2:22:29] day because the
[2:22:31] resources were just enough for
[2:22:34] that. If one missed food on the
[2:22:38] introduction that was all
[2:22:43] [Music]
[2:22:44] Because next for us we went
[2:22:48] home. Pastor monitored my
[2:22:51] life, watched
[2:22:54] me, looked after
[2:22:57] me
[2:22:59] and the
[2:23:01] the the what I would say is what I the
[2:23:04] title I would say for this speech here.
[2:23:06] I
[2:23:08] have I've said inspired by the inspired.
[2:23:14] Amen. Amen. I go I've been
[2:23:17] inspired by an inspired
[2:23:23] person. I think a man who has seen
[2:23:27] poverty, who has seen small beginnings,
[2:23:30] will know how to handle
[2:23:32] people who are having small
[2:23:35] beginnings and who are going through
[2:23:38] difficult. So his life has inspired
[2:23:41] me and meeting an inspired
[2:23:45] person is quite
[2:23:47] inspiring. And so it was for me meeting
[2:23:51] pastoral in my ears and through all the
[2:23:54] years that have
[2:23:57] followed. Lesson is
[2:24:01] learned. The great deep emphasis of the
[2:24:04] message of the hour
[2:24:09] reading it, listening to it and
[2:24:12] distributing it are the very core issues
[2:24:16] that I have been inspired into by this
[2:24:19] person called Pastor Ival
[2:24:26] Steven. In the
[2:24:29] 1990s, books were
[2:24:31] brought, tapes were brought and they
[2:24:35] were distributed.
[2:24:37] To date, I have been
[2:24:40] inspired even as I'm speaking. Whatever
[2:24:43] little man I get, I print message books.
[2:24:48] I distribute message books. I try
[2:24:50] whatever I
[2:24:52] can. My vehicle is always full of
[2:24:54] message
[2:24:55] books. I can buy message books and I
[2:24:58] give them as free as it is. I was
[2:25:02] inspired. I was led the message of the
[2:25:06] God bless
[2:25:11] you. A preached a practical preached and
[2:25:14] lived life of
[2:25:19] integrity has so much inspired many of
[2:25:21] us in the
[2:25:23] ministry that God has put in our med
[2:25:26] through
[2:25:28] pastor. He respects all categories of
[2:25:32] people both small and big.
[2:25:36] It's quite amazing and I have found that
[2:25:39] with
[2:25:43] pastor sometimes he's calling me
[2:25:46] pastor and I was I always wonder is he
[2:25:51] mistaken because I I don't really
[2:25:53] qualify to be a pastor before
[2:25:55] him. He will call you
[2:25:58] pastor. He respect every small gift.
[2:26:05] And we have been nurtured from nothing
[2:26:07] to something
[2:26:13] that another lesson I've learned.
[2:26:17] I have watched that this that I have
[2:26:20] watched that his
[2:26:23] greatest and very blessed
[2:26:26] success has been in the gospel and
[2:26:30] pastoring though I know it has gone with
[2:26:32] a lot on his
[2:26:37] physical. I have I have watched and
[2:26:40] learned the principle making tents like
[2:26:43] Paul did through our pastor.
[2:26:48] I have seen him struggle like any other
[2:26:50] mortal man to reach other ends such as
[2:26:57] business. Struggle like any other man in
[2:27:01] business,
[2:27:03] politics,
[2:27:04] poetry, animal
[2:27:06] keeping, education but in all the most
[2:27:11] and the blessed impact that has been in
[2:27:14] pastorship.
[2:27:19] And I am one of the most evident
[2:27:23] fruit though not any greater than
[2:27:27] others. Amen. Amen. As I stand, I just
[2:27:31] want to give a witness that we started
[2:27:34] in a small way in
[2:27:36] Kala to where let me say everywhere I
[2:27:39] have
[2:27:40] gone in the rented
[2:27:43] houses in the in the big houses, pastor
[2:27:46] has reached my place. He has come and
[2:27:50] when we started in
[2:27:51] Campala, it was a very small beginning.
[2:27:56] He used to come inspire us, speak to us
[2:28:01] and
[2:28:02] steadily, you know, challenging
[2:28:05] us with his life. As I stand, I'm
[2:28:08] pastoring a church in
[2:28:10] Campala. We started with about eight
[2:28:13] people. By his grace, we are more than
[2:28:16] 200
[2:28:17] people. I give thanks to God. God bless
[2:28:21] you for standing.
[2:28:24] I have been
[2:28:26] challenged always and wondered if I'll
[2:28:30] ever be a
[2:28:31] pastor to someone like the way my pastor
[2:28:34] has been to
[2:28:37] me. I do not want to
[2:28:39] presume but I want to feel the way John
[2:28:42] was called the disciple that Jesus loved
[2:28:49] most. We know that he loved them all.
[2:28:53] I'm inspired to follow the list of
[2:28:57] them that I find in the course of the
[2:29:01] ministry that may that may seemingly be
[2:29:05] shy as I have
[2:29:08] been try to lift them to their
[2:29:11] feet. I hope it may not have been clear
[2:29:14] but I'm saying pastor has followed
[2:29:19] us pastor does even the least shy like
[2:29:25] me until he can bring us to stand and
[2:29:28] stand before the
[2:29:31] people. I'm
[2:29:33] inspired in my ministry to follow up the
[2:29:39] list whether whether small or shy.
[2:29:44] they can be able to come to the
[2:29:48] surface. Before I went for the
[2:29:51] ministry, I went I sat in his
[2:29:54] office and my beloved pastor spoke to me
[2:29:57] as a
[2:30:00] mentor. He gave me four principles in
[2:30:03] the
[2:30:04] ministry. It was a heart-to-he heart
[2:30:06] talk in the office which was behind
[2:30:09] there and these have guided me. I'll
[2:30:13] share with you. He spoke
[2:30:16] inspiredly and he may not remember what
[2:30:18] he spoke and this I've repeated it over
[2:30:21] and
[2:30:23] over. He said Robert know who has called
[2:30:27] you in the
[2:30:30] ministry. Amen. That's right.
[2:30:33] I will not explain
[2:30:35] details but a minister should know who
[2:30:39] has called him in the
[2:30:44] ministry. The second he says always
[2:30:47] preach
[2:30:51] inspiration. That's right. Never preach
[2:30:55] situations. Amen. Preach what God has
[2:30:58] inspired you to.
[2:31:02] He told me the third thing he says avoid
[2:31:06] being
[2:31:09] emotional.
[2:31:11] Amen. Details I will not talk about
[2:31:14] them. The fourth principle he told me be
[2:31:18] careful of preachers
[2:31:24] influence. Amen. Each of these I have
[2:31:28] always had a sermon on each of them as
[2:31:30] full as full as
[2:31:34] full. God bless you
[2:31:38] pastor. The secret I have learned is
[2:31:41] that the pastor gives all his life to
[2:31:43] the right cause of the
[2:31:49] gospel. This I have discovered that by
[2:31:52] around his early age of about 30 years
[2:31:58] his early years of about 30
[2:32:01] years. When I met him, he looked
[2:32:06] mature,
[2:32:07] focused,
[2:32:09] experienced, deep
[2:32:11] rooted and more all like a man of about
[2:32:14] 50
[2:32:16] years who met
[2:32:18] him. Amen. Amen. It was later on I
[2:32:21] discovered that pastor was still a
[2:32:23] younger boy.
[2:32:25] when we met him. But by that time, the
[2:32:28] way we looked at him, he looked like he
[2:32:30] was 50
[2:32:34] years because he was
[2:32:36] mature. He was steady. He was deep
[2:32:39] rooted in the
[2:32:41] word. Thank God for that.
[2:32:46] I have learned that that years before
[2:32:49] that like brother Ben said he had
[2:32:52] surrendered his all to the ministry and
[2:32:55] the message of the
[2:32:57] hour. I believe he had forgo
[2:33:00] education. Maybe he had opportunity to
[2:33:03] continue. I've not heard pastor talk
[2:33:06] about
[2:33:08] employment. I've only heard him about
[2:33:10] the
[2:33:11] message. He had forgo politics.
[2:33:15] because I know he had great
[2:33:17] potential. It's a great life. His great
[2:33:20] life was a life of
[2:33:22] aspirations already sunk into the
[2:33:25] message of the
[2:33:26] hour. We thank God for such a life of
[2:33:30] sacrifice. Some of us have only been
[2:33:32] able to surrender to our to to to
[2:33:35] serve in our older
[2:33:38] parts and all our youth has been gone.
[2:33:42] I wish I had opportunity to surrender at
[2:33:44] the time when you
[2:33:46] surrendered. It would have been
[2:33:49] different. But I just left work I think
[2:33:52] about four years
[2:33:55] ago to devote myself. But I was already
[2:33:58] in 40s and
[2:34:00] 50s. For him in his 18s, he was already
[2:34:04] serving. When you retire now or when you
[2:34:07] say I want to give
[2:34:10] responsibility, we salute you with all
[2:34:14] respect. We love you. God bless you. He
[2:34:18] surrendered his home, his family, his
[2:34:21] strength, his resources, and the future
[2:34:24] to the service of the Lord. And when he
[2:34:27] sounds like he wants to hand
[2:34:29] over some of the administrative cause
[2:34:33] that go with the ministry, he has indeed
[2:34:35] labored. May God bless his beloved
[2:34:39] wife, our mother Sarah.
[2:34:42] The dear sisters,
[2:34:44] peace, peace, hope, hope, patience and
[2:34:47] faith for supporting closely our
[2:34:50] pastor he serves in the
[2:34:52] ministry. May God bless our pastor's
[2:34:55] heart.
[2:34:56] Pray that we hold his hands as the
[2:34:59] younger
[2:35:00] eagles. Hold the older
[2:35:03] ones. Comfort his heart as he pursu as
[2:35:06] we
[2:35:07] pursue the cause for which he has
[2:35:11] labored and may be his
[2:35:15] God. like Elijah, I pray that the
[2:35:18] anointing upon him will flow to others
[2:35:22] like it flowed to
[2:35:24] Elishah, Juel
[2:35:27] and
[2:35:28] 7,000. May manyers be in his crown even
[2:35:32] as he continues to
[2:35:34] serve. I just want to suppose it's a
[2:35:37] change of
[2:35:39] ministry. I just want to
[2:35:41] suppose that it's a change of
[2:35:44] ministry in the life of our pastor and
[2:35:47] yet only God knows all
[2:35:49] that. Amen. Amen. So it reminds me of
[2:35:52] some words that the prophet
[2:35:54] spoke about brother
[2:35:56] boss and brother Ne. I will not read the
[2:36:00] details. Brother I mean brother Brham
[2:36:05] said if there is anyone who represented
[2:36:07] Pentecost in this age
[2:36:12] who understood the cause of
[2:36:14] Pentecost. It was both worth. Amen.
[2:36:18] Amen. I say with all respect, but if
[2:36:21] there is any other minister, I know
[2:36:24] there are many ministers. But who has
[2:36:27] really stood for this
[2:36:29] gospel in before
[2:36:31] me? It is pastoral Steven.
[2:36:37] Steven should be
[2:36:39] respected like the way brother Brham
[2:36:42] respected
[2:36:44] Ne. He constantly talked about Neil.
[2:36:48] Even when the gift of Ne could not match
[2:36:51] that of Brother
[2:36:57] Brham, a real
[2:37:00] pastor, a real man of God, a real
[2:37:03] teacher of the gospel.
[2:37:06] I would compare you to
[2:37:08] brother. God bless your
[2:37:11] ministry. Amen. Amen. In
[2:37:14] closing, in closing, I want to say, may
[2:37:18] the almighty God anoint our precious
[2:37:19] brother
[2:37:23] James. May God use
[2:37:26] you in your humble
[2:37:29] nature. Dedicated to the
[2:37:32] cause. Simple.
[2:37:36] focused. That's the brother James whom I
[2:37:38] have
[2:37:39] known since he was a student at the
[2:37:43] university, whom I have been a best man
[2:37:47] for with whom we have closely walked
[2:37:50] together and served together. I heartly
[2:37:54] appreciate the grace that God has
[2:37:55] bestowed upon
[2:37:57] you to step in the footsteps of our
[2:38:00] pastor and steer forth the noble cause.
[2:38:05] of the gospel and uphold a spiritual
[2:38:11] legacy of our beloved gospel center in a
[2:38:14] veil ministries
[2:38:18] Ginger. We pledge to stand
[2:38:20] together by God's grace as we continue
[2:38:24] to
[2:38:24] serve. May God bless all the
[2:38:28] saints. God bless you friends. God bless
[2:38:32] your organizers.
[2:38:34] Oldtimes of
[2:38:36] ginger. I I I hope to mention
[2:38:41] this. I say rest in
[2:38:43] peace,
[2:38:46] brother. Rest in peace.
[2:38:49] Brother, rest in peace. Sistered, I want
[2:38:54] to say rest in peace.
[2:38:56] Brother, you held my hands when I was a
[2:38:59] little boy.
[2:39:02] If you were here, I believe we would
[2:39:04] rejoice together as we see the Lord
[2:39:07] uplifting this
[2:39:09] ministry and all others who have gone
[2:39:11] before and those who are present, all my
[2:39:15] young life
[2:39:17] deacons, mothers,
[2:39:21] sisters and friends. May God bless you,
[2:39:24] dear
[2:39:25] pastor,
[2:39:27] even grant you many fruitful
[2:39:30] years ahead.
[2:39:33] Amen. Amen. There's a request I put
[2:39:35] before him. There's a request I put
[2:39:38] before
[2:39:39] him at his own time. He'll be able to to
[2:39:43] perform it if it pleases him. May the
[2:39:46] good Lord bless you. Thank you for
[2:39:48] coming. Shalom.
[2:39:51] [Applause]
[2:40:01] Do you appreciate pastor Robert
[2:40:03] Kavasi? Robert
[2:40:06] Kavasi. Indeed, our time is just not
[2:40:11] enough. There are many people have been
[2:40:14] mentioned. Would be worth
[2:40:17] recognizing. Brother Castor, if you can
[2:40:19] stand up. came all the way from West
[2:40:22] Nile
[2:40:24] there. He was a deacon
[2:40:28] here. Brother, if you can stand
[2:40:31] up,
[2:40:33] brother is a is a pastor I think
[2:40:36] in you're welcome. He was also here.
[2:40:40] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:40:43] He's a he was a head deacon. Now he's a
[2:40:46] pastor. We have also brother
[2:40:54] simp. I'm sorry I may not pick one by
[2:40:56] one but there are so many who are
[2:40:59] here. Now I want to invite pastor
[2:41:03] Kamati to come and greet the
[2:41:06] church before we can sing one song and
[2:41:09] then we bring in
[2:41:14] pastoral. Amen. Amen.
[2:41:18] [Applause]
[2:41:43] God deals with the church as an
[2:41:48] individual.
[2:41:55] each
[2:42:03] [Music]
[2:42:13] individ when a man
[2:42:16] [Music]
[2:42:18] proves and God loves him.
[2:42:24] God takes that man.
[2:42:28] I'll
[2:42:31] repeat when Pastor Steven Iar
[2:42:38] proved and God loves brother
[2:42:45] Steven. God has taken him
[2:42:51] out of somewhere to
[2:42:55] himself there in front of the
[2:42:59] angels. He does something for Pastor
[2:43:02] Steven Ibar.
[2:43:07] He lifts him
[2:43:09] up there in the presence of
[2:43:12] God and gifts
[2:43:15] him and fills him
[2:43:18] and sets him
[2:43:22] out. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:43:26] Allow me not to say anything
[2:43:30] more, but I'm honored and very, very
[2:43:34] humbled.
[2:43:37] to be
[2:43:41] here to hear the testimony of my
[2:43:44] precious
[2:43:47] friend and I'll call him my senior
[2:43:52] pastor. The Lord has used him in a
[2:43:55] special and unique
[2:44:00] way. He has gifted him in a
[2:44:03] way like the pastor
[2:44:06] say that he has he has been inspired by
[2:44:10] the
[2:44:13] inspired and we say thank
[2:44:16] God for pastor
[2:44:19] [Applause]
[2:44:21] I pastor
[2:44:24] I is not
[2:44:26] tired so he's not retiring
[2:44:31] God is rating him
[2:44:33] up with greater
[2:44:37] responsibility so that he can deal with
[2:44:39] us
[2:44:41] pastors who are coming up and he can
[2:44:45] train us as he has always
[2:44:49] done. Thank you, Pastor
[2:44:52] Steven, for allowing the Lord to use
[2:44:55] you from very humble
[2:44:58] beginnings, sacrificing your
[2:45:07] all as I
[2:45:09] finish, I'm accompanied by my precious
[2:45:13] wife.
[2:45:16] [Applause]
[2:45:18] You can read the
[2:45:24] people and my very precious
[2:45:27] friend Patrick
[2:45:32] Mangi can greet the
[2:45:36] people and his wife
[2:45:38] Betty. Mr. Betty you can greet the
[2:45:42] people. These are very very precious
[2:45:44] friends.
[2:45:47] walked with me many many
[2:45:50] years. I also came with my precious
[2:45:53] lovely
[2:45:58] daughter.
[2:46:00] Peace.
[2:46:01] [Music]
[2:46:05] Peace. God bless you. My love and my son
[2:46:11] John Bogwa.
[2:46:14] Wow.
[2:46:19] Like an gave Samuel to
[2:46:25] uh in the temple.
[2:46:30] I humbly request pastor
[2:46:35] CV to take my son John
[2:46:39] and train
[2:46:42] him like you have trained pastor pastor
[2:46:45] here in
[2:46:49] Campara. I want to run from those four
[2:46:52] points. Please remember to write them
[2:46:53] for

[2:53:23] [Music]
[2:53:25] me. Somewhere in the
[2:53:30] temple, sing day and night.
[2:53:35] [Music]
[2:53:37] a voice in the night called
[2:53:43] [Music]
[2:53:45] Samuel. He arose and went to
[2:53:51] Eli. He answered, "Here I
[2:53:54] am." Oh, Eli told him, "That's the Lord
[2:54:00] says speak Lord I am."
[2:54:06] Oh, when he had the call
[2:54:10] again, speak thyself and hears the
[2:54:14] answer.
[2:54:17] The Lord then spoke to him for Eli's
[2:54:26] house and sent to all of
[2:54:31] Israel to be God's chosen prophet.
[2:54:37] Oh, as you as God
[2:54:40] commission
[2:54:43] him, send thou
[2:54:45] me, send me, oh Lord, to the
[2:54:54] nation. Send
[2:54:59] me and land so far away.
[2:55:10] your name to
[2:55:14] all in your presence. Here I stand
[2:55:19] before our
[2:55:21] praises. Send out
[2:55:27] me. The Lord may have called you.
[2:55:34] send you like
[2:55:37] Jonah. You've turned your way from the
[2:55:41] net of
[2:55:47] you. But even surely
[2:55:52] then God's plan will never fail.
[2:55:57] Heal the stormy sea
[2:56:08] situations on your knees down there.
[2:56:13] Three good days and nights of
[2:56:17] prayer for the Lord to come on sin with
[2:56:22] another
[2:56:26] chance. Oh that the next time his voice
[2:56:32] calls out and says whom shall I send?
[2:56:38] Oh
[2:56:41] my
[2:56:44] go send thou
[2:56:46] me. Send now
[2:56:51] me to
[2:56:55] nations. Send
[2:56:59] me and land so far
[2:57:04] away. I will proclaim your name. I will
[2:57:09] proclaim your name to all
[2:57:16] people. Here I stand before the
[2:57:24] praises. I will proclaim.

[2:57:29] proclaim your name to all
[2:57:36] people. Here I stand before thy
[2:57:41] presence. Send out.
[2:57:48] [Music]
[2:57:51] [Applause]
[2:57:58] Good afternoon.
[2:58:02] God bless you all.
[2:58:05] I greet you in the precious name of our
[2:58:07] Lord Jesus
[2:58:10] Christ and I'm happy to
[2:58:12] see quite a number of
[2:58:17] people to come on this
[2:58:23] small faction.
[2:58:29] Um I was of
[2:58:32] the idea that I wanted the people who
[2:58:35] started from
[2:58:39] here and the pastor says let's open the
[2:58:43] function to
[2:58:47] everybody and I've learned one
[2:58:49] thing to obey my pastor
[2:58:59] That's very important.
[2:59:02] Amen. Amen. So I told him
[2:59:04] also he should not put an
[2:59:08] emphasis on trying to get the people
[2:59:13] in. But I appreciate some of the people
[2:59:15] I see here.
[2:59:19] Uh the team from Nairobi
[2:59:23] Nairobi, brother,
[2:59:26] your wife, then brother here,
[2:59:31] and then brother Levi,
[2:59:34] and then my son John
[2:59:38] and the rest of brother Ruben
[2:59:42] and the rest of you.
[2:59:44] God bless you so much.
[2:59:47] I'm seeing
[2:59:48] brother Phillip
[2:59:51] Philip all the way from
[2:59:53] uh uh Chesro
[2:59:58] 600 kilometers from here.
[3:00:01] God bless you.
[3:00:04] Amen. I'm seeing brother many brothers.
[3:00:08] Amen. Amen. Amen. I certainly appreciate
[3:00:11] all of
[3:00:12] you. I want to
[3:00:15] welcome the pastors and
[3:00:21] you know who have come down here
[3:00:24] today to be with us. Brother,
[3:00:28] you came long ways to be here. God bless
[3:00:33] you. I always want to
[3:00:36] recognize the pastors that are taking
[3:00:39] the message.
[3:00:41] Now, I just want to invite
[3:00:44] you to recognize your presence. our new
[3:00:48] pastors that have been able to make it
[3:00:50] come just walk up
[3:00:53] here. You always do. We appreciate you
[3:00:56] people. Amen.
[3:01:02] Amen.
[3:01:04] Sometimes when we are having a
[3:01:07] function, we put in some money for them
[3:01:10] to be
[3:01:12] here and then we have about
[3:01:16] 200. Amen. Amen. And uh the Lord has
[3:01:20] honestly blessed
[3:01:21] us but we said this one should be a very
[3:01:26] quiet
[3:01:29] faction. Pray for those
[3:01:32] men. They've chosen to take the message
[3:01:35] that you cherish.
[3:01:38] [Applause]
[3:01:46] May the Lord bless
[3:01:47] you. You can go back and see.
[3:01:50] [Applause]
[3:01:56] Yeah. I appreciate brother Mambo being
[3:01:58] here.
[3:02:03] Brother Max
[3:02:05] of the voice of
[3:02:07] God of God. And then let the senior
[3:02:11] ministers come
[3:02:13] here. Amen. Come over. Come over.
[3:02:17] Amen. Amen. Brother Emma, brother Ben,
[3:02:19] all of you.
[3:02:22] Come over
[3:02:22] [Music]
[3:02:25] here. Amen. And all of you come
[3:02:28] over, brother. We appreciate having you
[3:02:36] here, brotherto.
[3:02:43] our
[3:02:46] brother, all of you, my
[3:02:50] neighbors. Amen. We certainly appreciate
[3:02:53] to have you
[3:02:55] here. And may the Lord bless
[3:02:59] you. God bless you so much. You can go
[3:03:02] back and take your
[3:03:04] seat. I'm not going to be long.
[3:03:09] And uh as I close
[3:03:14] uh I
[3:03:15] want
[3:03:17] brother Robert
[3:03:22] to come under the witness of his
[3:03:26] family and they'll stand right
[3:03:30] here. When we sent out brother
[3:03:34] Robert we prayed for him.
[3:03:37] to go
[3:03:38] out and do some
[3:03:41] work with those that used to come from
[3:03:44] Campala, come here for services and go
[3:03:49] back. And brother Robert went,
[3:03:54] but he has desired
[3:03:58] to
[3:04:02] have with an official ordination.
[3:04:09] So we shall ordain our
[3:04:12] brother. He has
[3:04:14] proved he has
[3:04:16] proved that he is a God called
[3:04:21] man. There's no question about his
[3:04:25] ministry and God has also given him a
[3:04:28] lovely family.
[3:04:31] You know,
[3:04:33] ministers, always pray for your
[3:04:37] families. And I've always told
[3:04:40] ministers, if you want to lose your
[3:04:45] children, talk about
[3:04:48] ministers in their
[3:04:51] presence. You'll never have
[3:04:56] them. You'll never have any child.
[3:05:00] Respect one
[3:05:02] another and God will bless
[3:05:08] you. I'm telling you, you say something
[3:05:12] negative about a
[3:05:14] brother in the hearing of your
[3:05:17] children, you are destroying
[3:05:20] them. All those things that you do on
[3:05:23] social
[3:05:25] media, they don't make you greater.
[3:05:30] Humility is your
[3:05:36] greatness. So I want to invite you for a
[3:05:39] few minutes here.
[3:05:42] I'm not going to
[3:05:43] preach, but I just want to do a
[3:05:49] handover to the man
[3:05:53] orained. Brother, God bless you.
[3:05:57] [Applause]
[3:06:01] How is my church?
[3:06:07] I was the first pastor in that place by
[3:06:11] that. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So
[3:06:15] let's stand up and get first kings
[3:06:18] chapter
[3:06:20] one and verse 33.
[3:06:24] I'm going to say a few
[3:06:27] things and I want to be so
[3:06:31] emphatic when I'm handing over to our
[3:06:35] brother. I'll say a few
[3:06:37] things and I trust that the
[3:06:40] Lord will take those
[3:06:43] things, print them on his
[3:06:45] heart. I want him to know
[3:06:48] today that
[3:06:50] God has anointed him to take over this
[3:06:55] world. Amen. So, first kings
[3:07:01] 133. The king also said unto
[3:07:06] them, this is King
[3:07:08] David, take you with take with you the
[3:07:12] servants of your
[3:07:15] lord and cause Solomon my son to ride
[3:07:18] upon my own
[3:07:24] mule and bring him down to
[3:07:27] Guehon. And let Zadok the
[3:07:31] priest and Nathan the
[3:07:33] prophet anoint the
[3:07:36] king over
[3:07:38] Israel and blow you with the
[3:07:42] trumpet and say go save King
[3:07:48] Solomon. Let us pray. Precious heavenly
[3:07:53] father maybe I would not be the best to
[3:07:56] speak at this time.
[3:08:00] But because you have allowed
[3:08:02] me to do the
[3:08:05] handover, I pray that I may take this
[3:08:09] opportunity, I also pray that you may
[3:08:11] anoint my
[3:08:13] words and as the people receive
[3:08:16] them, Father, I pray that you may bless
[3:08:19] them.
[3:08:21] May they become stepping
[3:08:24] stones in the hearts of the
[3:08:28] wise in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may
[3:08:32] be
[3:08:33] seated. So I'll just call
[3:08:37] this little
[3:08:41] uh talk to you the
[3:08:47] handover. Amen. Amen. So let me say a
[3:08:51] few things
[3:08:53] here before you know I pick up those
[3:08:57] scriptures I've
[3:09:00] read. Now the five-fold
[3:09:04] ministry is ordained of
[3:09:07] God but the
[3:09:09] shepherd is the founding gift.
[3:09:14] Amen. Amen. It is the ministry of a
[3:09:20] pastor that nurtures
[3:09:23] you from a
[3:09:25] child to a
[3:09:27] minister. This ministry of a
[3:09:31] past must have the ability to
[3:09:36] teach. Out of that
[3:09:38] ministry, the rest of the ministries are
[3:09:42] natured and they are shaped.
[3:09:45] There is a brother who is a sheep a
[3:09:47] pastor
[3:09:48] now. When he was in school with brother
[3:09:53] Robert,
[3:09:54] he came to me and he said
[3:09:57] pastor I want to leave
[3:10:00] school. He was in his A
[3:10:03] level and I asked him what? He says I
[3:10:07] want to go and drive a
[3:10:09] trailer so that I can preach the word.
[3:10:15] You see when you are just
[3:10:17] beginning in the absence of a
[3:10:20] shepherd that boy would have
[3:10:23] gone but now is a very responsible
[3:10:29] accountant in a big
[3:10:31] company and is ministering the
[3:10:34] world.
[3:10:36] Pastors are very important for your
[3:10:42] upcoming. You may be able to have more
[3:10:45] knowledge than
[3:10:48] them, but those men they have what we
[3:10:52] call a
[3:10:54] gift. Gift and knowledge are two
[3:10:56] different
[3:10:58] things. Gift is an
[3:11:01] anointing with power behind
[3:11:04] it. But knowledge may just be something
[3:11:07] you know and sometimes may never
[3:11:11] help. But I'll take the scripture here
[3:11:14] in Ephesians
[3:11:17] 4 and verse
[3:11:19] 11. And he gave
[3:11:22] some
[3:11:24] apostles and some prophets and some
[3:11:29] evangelists and some pastors and
[3:11:34] teachers. He doesn't say and some
[3:11:38] pastors and some
[3:11:41] teachers. But he seems to add these two
[3:11:44] gifts
[3:11:47] together. The ministry of a
[3:11:49] pastor and a teacher seem to be linked
[3:11:53] together in this
[3:11:56] scripture. Are you together with me? So
[3:11:59] the five
[3:12:01] ministry is just a selected few in the
[3:12:06] body. Amen. Amen. Not everybody is a
[3:12:10] part of this.
[3:12:13] but a fivefold
[3:12:16] ministry. Any man who takes part in
[3:12:19] it is ordained of God from before the
[3:12:23] foundation of the
[3:12:25] world to take care of the ministry of
[3:12:28] Jesus
[3:12:30] Christ. Amen. So not everybody can be
[3:12:33] one of
[3:12:35] those. They could be
[3:12:38] disputed, but God caused
[3:12:41] them to use them in his
[3:12:44] service. Amen. To the bride body. And
[3:12:48] sometimes for a specific
[3:12:52] season and in a specific
[3:12:56] location. Are you together with me? You
[3:12:59] know when God calls a
[3:13:01] man, he calls him for a specific season.
[3:13:07] and for a specific
[3:13:09] location. You cannot be a successful
[3:13:14] pastor in every area you plant
[3:13:18] yourself. God plants you in a
[3:13:21] place, waters your ministry
[3:13:24] there and the ministry begins to bring
[3:13:27] forth
[3:13:29] fruit. That's what God does. So at the
[3:13:33] handover, I want to tell the pastor
[3:13:37] here, if you can just
[3:13:40] stand in the rest of the words I'm going
[3:13:42] to say, take your distance. Don't mind
[3:13:44] just right there.
[3:13:47] On top of the obvious
[3:13:51] things that go with the
[3:13:54] ministry like a
[3:13:57] study and prayer, there are certain
[3:14:00] things
[3:14:02] You ought to take note of
[3:14:08] [Music]
[3:14:11] you have not been called
[3:14:14] to a popularity
[3:14:19] contest. You've been called to serve
[3:14:23] these
[3:14:27] people. The calling of a
[3:14:30] shepherd is more like the calling of the
[3:14:33] Old Testament
[3:14:37] priesthood. You are being called out of
[3:14:39] a
[3:14:41] people to serve a
[3:14:44] people. I'll take you to Hebrews chapter
[3:14:48] 5. I said I'm not going to
[3:14:51] preach. I'm just going to
[3:14:54] stay on a few
[3:14:56] things so that we go out of
[3:15:00] here. Hebrews chapter
[3:15:02] 5 verse one. For every high
[3:15:08] priest is taken from among
[3:15:12] men is ordained for
[3:15:16] men. Amen. He is taken out of
[3:15:20] you to serve
[3:15:22] you. Amen.
[3:15:25] Much as he has been part of
[3:15:28] you, you must accept him for the new
[3:15:32] calling the Lord has given.
[3:15:38] is called out of
[3:15:41] men and is ordained for
[3:15:44] men in things pertaining to
[3:15:48] God that he may offer both gifts and
[3:15:52] sacrifices for
[3:15:56] sin. And God designs the heart of this
[3:16:01] man. He makes him
[3:16:05] compassionate. I always wonder
[3:16:08] When whether some people are
[3:16:11] pastors, when they've got radical
[3:16:21] [Music]
[3:16:23] heart, God calls
[3:16:25] you to deal with the wickedness of the
[3:16:28] people.
[3:16:33] In verse two says, "Who can have
[3:16:39] compassion, on the
[3:16:41] ignorant, and on them that are out of
[3:16:45] the way."
[3:16:47] Now, your
[3:16:49] calling is to deal with the
[3:16:53] ignorant, you have to teach them. And
[3:16:56] those that are out of the way, you have
[3:16:59] to bring them back.
[3:17:04] So you are constantly going to
[3:17:08] deal with the
[3:17:10] ignorant so that you may teach them and
[3:17:14] those that are out of the way so that
[3:17:17] the
[3:17:18] anointing of a good
[3:17:21] shepherd that God has placed upon you
[3:17:24] may bring those people back into the
[3:17:30] bit. Amen. Amen. You need to step
[3:17:34] in this
[3:17:36] office knowing that you are a
[3:17:41] burdenbearer and not a lord over other
[3:17:43] people.
[3:17:48] You are a burden
[3:17:51] bearer. And I have a few
[3:17:54] things to categorically place before
[3:17:59] you that when you step into this
[3:18:03] office, be
[3:18:05] sure that you take a
[3:18:10] criticism with grace.
[3:18:16] There are people
[3:18:18] They are just specialists on
[3:18:22] criticizing. You are going to
[3:18:27] suffer. So take criticism with
[3:18:32] grace and take
[3:18:35] praise. Take
[3:18:37] praise with
[3:18:44] caution. Take criticism.
[3:18:48] with grace
[3:18:49] and
[3:18:51] praise with caution.
[3:18:56] Always deal with
[3:18:59] principles because it's principles that
[3:19:02] matter.
[3:19:09] Feed my sheep.
[3:19:12] Feed my lambs.
[3:19:15] God is not giving you God's
[3:19:19] food. You take too much
[3:19:22] time. Instead of feeding the
[3:19:25] sheep, you'll be fighting
[3:19:29] goats. Feed my
[3:19:32] sheep. Feed my
[3:19:37] lamb. Now when you give yourself into
[3:19:41] service,
[3:19:44] Do one
[3:19:45] thing. Never ignore your
[3:19:52] family. Always have
[3:19:54] time for your
[3:19:57] family because that's your first church.
[3:20:05] You are
[3:20:06] not going to be a happy pastor.
[3:20:13] with a lost family.
[3:20:20] And as you take the office
[3:20:23] today, you are not a
[3:20:28] replacement, but you are a continuation.
[3:20:35] [Music]
[3:20:37] You are not replacing
[3:20:39] anybody because the church is on a
[3:20:44] journey. Like when you look at the seven
[3:20:46] church
[3:20:48] ages is basically one
[3:20:51] church and every
[3:20:54] messenger and every age was a
[3:20:57] continuation of that.
[3:21:03] So I want you to know that as you come
[3:21:07] in, you are not replacing me,
[3:21:11] but you are a
[3:21:13] continuation of what God has been
[3:21:18] doing. A few
[3:21:20] things that I think you should
[3:21:23] remember for the many
[3:21:26] years that you are going to be in this
[3:21:29] office. Don't use the office
[3:21:33] to prove yourself
[3:21:36] right and others
[3:21:42] wrong which is a very big
[3:21:45] problem in the body of
[3:21:49] Christ. People use these
[3:21:52] offices to prove I'm the one who is
[3:21:55] right and all the others are
[3:21:57] wrong. And you are preaching to
[3:22:00] people who are not even there with
[3:22:05] you. Feed my sheep.
[3:22:08] Feed my lamb.
[3:22:14] Avoid on concentrating on painting a
[3:22:18] personal
[3:22:23] picture. Don't make yourself your
[3:22:26] object.
[3:22:34] Christ is the object of our worship.
[3:22:40] Amen. I told
[3:22:43] Robert that when God calls you,
[3:22:48] he hasn't called you to preach history
[3:22:51] of your me of your ministry.
[3:22:56] When I was in Kala, when I was
[3:22:59] in when I was in Ginger and you are
[3:23:03] telling what you
[3:23:04] did, tell the people what they want
[3:23:10] [Applause]
[3:23:14] now. Keep the
[3:23:16] people on the focus.
[3:23:21] You
[3:23:22] see sometimes
[3:23:25] we draw the people's attention on
[3:23:29] ourselves and then the problem to
[3:23:32] that is that the
[3:23:35] people
[3:23:36] will
[3:23:37] [Music]
[3:23:39] lose the
[3:23:41] understanding of the body of
[3:23:44] Christ. This one doesn't think like my
[3:23:47] pastor.
[3:23:50] and they call you anything they want.
[3:23:55] Avoid that.
[3:23:57] Let Christ be the principal thing.
[3:24:03] Don't make a
[3:24:08] man
[3:24:12] even the
[3:24:15] standard because you'll find people
[3:24:19] say
[3:24:22] no it's not
[3:24:24] you let us make a Christ
[3:24:28] the central theme
[3:24:34] As a minister, you are just one
[3:24:37] man for your local
[3:24:40] area. And when you uncristianize all the
[3:24:44] other
[3:24:46] ministers, you are not going to help the
[3:24:48] people that
[3:24:52] side. You are destroying them.
[3:24:56] Let Christ be the central theme.
[3:25:01] Brother Brham says in the spoken word is
[3:25:04] the original
[3:25:06] seed part one. He says God's
[3:25:10] son was his example
[3:25:16] seed and what his life
[3:25:20] was when the spirit poured upon him
[3:25:23] after his baptism.
[3:25:27] and the Holy Ghost came upon
[3:25:29] him and the very life that he
[3:25:33] poured. That same watering spirit of the
[3:25:36] Holy
[3:25:38] Ghost will bring forth the same kind of
[3:25:43] life doing the same kind that he did.
[3:25:48] is the same
[3:25:50] seed, son of God
[3:25:53] seed to bring forth a son of God
[3:25:59] seed. If you try breed that
[3:26:03] seed, you'll get a wrong crop out of
[3:26:06] these people.
[3:26:13] Preach in
[3:26:15] season and out of season.
[3:26:18] Because once you are
[3:26:21] underpiration, you're preaching in
[3:26:24] season and out of
[3:26:27] season. I taught you here in
[3:26:31] season is you dealing with the people
[3:26:34] what they need
[3:26:38] currently. And when you see a
[3:26:41] minister going beyond what you think is
[3:26:47] necessary, underline those
[3:26:49] words. He might be preaching out of
[3:26:54] season. And that time you'll
[3:26:57] say this day this scripture is
[3:27:00] fulfilled.
[3:27:01] So whenever minister stands out
[3:27:04] here just believe the Holy Spirit is in
[3:27:09] front there speak to you.
[3:27:13] So I want to hand over these
[3:27:16] things but I want
[3:27:20] uh you know
[3:27:22] the team to
[3:27:25] come and sing me a song.
[3:27:35] ministers do what God called you
[3:27:39] for. You are not one another
[3:27:45] supervisor.
[3:27:50] Sometimes you dig someone else's garden
[3:27:53] when your garden has
[3:28:00] God calls you for your local
[3:28:04] church. You are called for this
[3:28:14] people. Praise the Lord. Very
[3:28:18] little gospel theme that we have.
[3:28:37] [Music]
[3:28:45] Praise the Lord.
[3:28:47] Glory, glory,
[3:28:52] hallelujah. Glory. Glory, glory,

[3:29:56] to I
[3:29:59] see the
[3:30:16] glory.
[3:30:19] Hallelujah. His truth is my
[3:30:25] Lord. My eyes have seen the glory of the
[3:30:30] coming of the Lord. He is jumping on the
[3:30:37] [Music]
[3:30:47] pes.
[3:30:58] Heat.
[3:31:07] Heat. His truth is maring
[3:31:13] God. I have seen him in the washers of a
[3:31:18] harness that he comes. He have builded
[3:31:22] him also.
[3:31:42] Hallelujah.
[3:31:50] [Music]
[3:31:54] [Applause]
[3:31:56] Hallelujah. His truth is maring
[3:32:02] on. He has sounded forth the trumpet.
[3:32:09] He is lifting up the hearts of men
[3:32:12] before his
[3:32:16] My
[3:32:17] soul is
[3:32:21] my God is
[3:32:33] [Music]
[3:32:35] my hallelujah.
[3:32:41] [Music]
[3:32:44] Hallelujah. His truth is
[3:32:50] maring in the beauty of the L. Christ
[3:32:55] has gone across the sea. We adore
[3:33:01] hisome
[3:33:03] and he died to make
[3:33:07] me to make me free. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[3:33:13] [Applause]
[3:33:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:33:42] Glory hallelujah.
[3:33:47] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah.
[3:33:58] [Music]
[3:34:05] [Applause]
[3:34:08] is hallelujah.
[3:34:10] [Music]
[3:34:11] [Applause]
[3:34:12] [Music]
[3:34:15] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You
[3:34:18] may be seated.
[3:34:26] I want to appreciate God
[3:34:31] for my
[3:34:34] [Applause]
[3:34:39] family. They have traveled the 40
[3:34:41] journey.
[3:34:45] I don't want to
[3:34:47] talk about what they've come through,
[3:34:52] but it has been the grace of
[3:34:58] God. My
[3:35:00] wife, my entire
[3:35:03] family, can you all come over here?
[3:35:10] Sister Sarah, God bless you,
[3:35:15] [Applause]
[3:35:19] Few people come over.
[3:35:25] My grandchildren.
[3:35:28] The only one missing his brother
[3:35:33] Danny is doing
[3:35:36] exams. So he could not
[3:35:39] travel. Stand on that side.
[3:35:44] I traveled with
[3:35:47] them in many
[3:35:49] places when they were still little
[3:35:52] children to preach this
[3:35:56] gospel. They went into West Nile.
[3:36:00] They went into all the
[3:36:02] places and the Lord has kept us as one
[3:36:08] family.
[3:36:10] [Applause]
[3:36:15] I've always tried the best I
[3:36:19] can to respect the
[3:36:22] ministers and
[3:36:24] sometimes I've not got back the
[3:36:28] same but is my
[3:36:31] principle to
[3:36:33] bless the ministers.
[3:36:38] [Applause]
[3:36:42] These children
[3:36:45] here, they've witnessed
[3:36:49] people who come to my
[3:36:54] house. And they say, "Brother
[3:36:57] Steven, we've come to destroy
[3:37:01] you." They would say all they
[3:37:04] wanted and they drive away.
[3:37:08] they would come again
[3:37:10] another. I always tell
[3:37:13] them
[3:37:14] love
[3:37:16] purchase of the blood of Jesus.
[3:37:19] [Applause]
[3:37:24] I want uh
[3:37:26] brother James's family to come here.
[3:37:33] his dear
[3:37:35] wife and the
[3:37:41] [Applause]
[3:37:48] children. We've gone through so
[3:37:51] much for the last 40 years.
[3:38:00] Just stand right there. Come up. You
[3:38:03] come
[3:38:11] up for you belong
[3:38:16] up. Praise the
[3:38:18] Lord. That's his little family.
[3:38:25] [Applause]
[3:38:34] The best
[3:38:36] gospel comes from the
[3:38:40] family. That's where it comes
[3:38:45] from. That's
[3:38:47] why they put the condition of a
[3:38:51] family. If a man wanted to be a
[3:38:55] bishop
[3:38:58] because it's there where he
[3:39:01] learns to deal with the
[3:39:05] ignorant and those that are out of the
[3:39:11] way. May the Lord give us grace. Sir, I
[3:39:16] now would want to hand over to you
[3:39:22] some important documentation
[3:39:27] here that pertain
[3:39:31] to this
[3:39:34] assembly.
[3:39:36] These are the registrations of the
[3:39:38] church.
[3:39:41] [Applause]
[3:39:50] I never put the
[3:39:52] church in my own
[3:39:55] names because it's mine, not
[3:39:59] mine. Amen. I am a servant
[3:40:03] to this
[3:40:10] church. And then these documents
[3:40:15] here is the
[3:40:18] right for you to marry the couples.
[3:40:24] [Applause]
[3:40:30] And now finally
[3:40:32] this these are the titles
[3:40:40] of these
[3:40:41] plots one and
[3:40:45] [Applause]
[3:40:51] two. So I think my family you can move
[3:40:55] back to those
[3:41:00] people. I appreciate
[3:41:04] them. They have walked with
[3:41:06] you for the last 40
[3:41:10] years and I believe they love
[3:41:14] you. God bless you.
[3:41:17] [Applause]
[3:41:24] So I've given
[3:41:26] you those
[3:41:29] documents, but above it
[3:41:33] all, behold the purchase of the
[3:41:40] blood. They are
[3:41:42] all under your
[3:41:45] care. And these
[3:41:47] people are your holy burden.
[3:41:54] [Music]
[3:41:58] So the right under you, right under
[3:42:02] you, I also stand.
[3:42:06] [Applause]
[3:42:14] I pray that the Lord may give you
[3:42:18] grace that you may feed the older
[3:42:25] ego to a renewal
[3:42:31] [Applause]
[3:42:36] again. So for 10 years
[3:42:40] You've ministered under
[3:42:43] pastor and now
[3:42:48] you are the
[3:42:56] pastor. I want you to become
[3:43:00] an all word minister.
[3:43:08] All Genesis
[3:43:17] Revelation like
[3:43:19] Genesis is not the entire
[3:43:22] Bible. Some little
[3:43:26] experience, some little
[3:43:29] experience cannot be the entire message.
[3:43:36] [Music]
[3:43:37] Don't take people out of
[3:43:39] balance. Be a
[3:43:41] teacher of the entire
[3:43:44] world. Amen. So I want us to
[3:43:48] look at the principle of adoption
[3:43:51] here before I step out to call brother
[3:43:59] Robert and your wife and children will
[3:44:03] come to
[3:44:05] witness. I require brother
[3:44:08] James, me and brother
[3:44:11] Kamati to be able to lay hands on
[3:44:14] him as the rest of the
[3:44:17] ministers stand behind
[3:44:23] us. You see, when you are a
[3:44:26] minister, you should listen to the voice
[3:44:28] of the spirit.
[3:44:33] When he says turn northward,
[3:44:37] turn northward.
[3:44:39] If you don't listen,
[3:44:42] you destroy what you started.
[3:44:45] [Music]
[3:44:48] I want to say the people here love me.
[3:44:55] Nobody pushed me out.
[3:44:58] I heard the voice of the spirit.
[3:45:02] This is your
[3:45:04] time. And when you see
[3:45:06] somebody who can stand in the
[3:45:09] office with other better
[3:45:13] qualifications
[3:45:17] you talking about his master's
[3:45:21] degrees but I'm talking about the
[3:45:25] ability to deal with
[3:45:27] people. James is a class above the
[3:45:30] ordinary.
[3:45:33] [Applause]
[3:45:40] And I want to thank God for
[3:45:43] him for the 10
[3:45:45] years that he has been under
[3:45:49] tutorship. He never set his
[3:45:52] foot ahead of where supposed to
[3:45:57] stop. So now David gave
[3:46:01] Solomon the
[3:46:03] kingdom because the king
[3:46:06] David had seen that of all his
[3:46:11] children it is Solomon who had his mind
[3:46:16] that's
[3:46:19] adoption is catching the father's
[3:46:25] mind and the moment You think like your
[3:46:30] father then the father will be
[3:46:34] comfortable to share his authority with
[3:46:38] you. Amen. Amen. So your
[3:46:44] adoption is not your
[3:46:47] birth. You have to be born by the
[3:46:50] baptism of the Holy Spirit. And that's a
[3:46:53] very great
[3:46:55] subject. Amen.
[3:46:58] Some people still
[3:47:00] believe that when you get that
[3:47:02] excitement,
[3:47:05] you've got
[3:47:08] it. But just look at that
[3:47:13] message.
[3:47:15] Invisible union.
[3:47:21] When God made
[3:47:24] man, he made him into his own
[3:47:29] image and then placed him in a
[3:47:33] body and this body is a visible body.
[3:47:38] So the invisible
[3:47:40] union is God going into the female
[3:47:45] part which is you into
[3:47:49] union to bring forth
[3:47:54] fruit and that inside
[3:47:58] part it has no
[3:48:03] emotion. It is only
[3:48:05] faith. That's why he says total
[3:48:08] obedience to the
[3:48:11] word entitles you to the
[3:48:15] token pulls that
[3:48:18] token onto
[3:48:21] itself. But if the
[3:48:25] spirit doesn't go all the
[3:48:28] way to the
[3:48:30] soul and it stops at the human
[3:48:34] spirit, you can shout
[3:48:37] You can scream. You can fall. And
[3:48:40] brother Brham says you just
[3:48:43] feel an experience of
[3:48:48] sanctification at the
[3:48:50] altar. You cry and then you call it the
[3:48:57] home.
[3:48:59] Friends, we came out of Pentecost
[3:49:03] to come into the message of the hour.
[3:49:10] We
[3:49:11] shouldn't
[3:49:15] confuse the bosom of the Holy
[3:49:19] Spirit and stimulation of
[3:49:23] revelation. These are two different
[3:49:26] things. Amen. Amen. That's right. That's
[3:49:29] right. You'll find us excited, jumping,
[3:49:32] shouting,
[3:49:36] stimulation of
[3:49:38] revelation and the
[3:49:41] baptism is totally a different
[3:49:49] thing. I'm going far
[3:49:56] again. Praise the
[3:49:58] Lord. So that this
[3:50:01] training because you are born
[3:50:04] taken through Hebrews
[3:50:08] 12 just
[3:50:10] chastising the training of a
[3:50:13] child then
[3:50:16] allowed to share in the authority of the
[3:50:20] father.
[3:50:24] This
[3:50:25] training involves a
[3:50:28] period where a
[3:50:30] character is
[3:50:32] studied and then
[3:50:35] approved and later that
[3:50:37] character is put to
[3:50:41] use. Amen. That's
[3:50:45] adoption.
[3:50:47] Amen. So the occasion of adoption
[3:50:54] was not done in a
[3:50:59] corner. It was a public
[3:51:03] function. And
[3:51:04] today I want to say as far as ministry
[3:51:09] is
[3:51:11] concerned, brother
[3:51:13] James is an approved son of God.
[3:51:17] [Applause]
[3:51:24] And in the images of
[3:51:28] adoption, we are fellow hairs with
[3:51:30] Christ to the
[3:51:34] father. We share in his
[3:51:38] name because he left us the
[3:51:41] name and the name is not something that
[3:51:45] he answers back to.
[3:51:49] But the name talks about character.
[3:51:55] We dressed.
[3:51:58] Amen. Ourselves in that
[3:52:02] name by the
[3:52:04] baptism of the Holy
[3:52:07] Ghost. We dress, we put on that
[3:52:11] name. And in this
[3:52:13] adoption, he has made us kings.
[3:52:18] and priests.
[3:52:22] Not he will make
[3:52:24] us but he has made us
[3:52:28] kings and
[3:52:30] priests. I'm
[3:52:32] finishing in Revelation
[3:52:35] 1:6 it says and he has made us kings and
[3:52:38] priests unto
[3:52:43] God his father. Amen. Which was not
[3:52:48] [Music]
[3:52:50] possible after the
[3:52:53] fall of Jacob's first
[3:53:00] son. He could no longer take the
[3:53:04] kingdom and the
[3:53:07] priesthood. So the kingdom was given to
[3:53:11] David. The priesthood was given to Levi.
[3:53:17] But we thank God for this
[3:53:19] day that when David came, he was the
[3:53:24] image of the unification of the
[3:53:28] kingdom and the
[3:53:30] priesthood. Amen. Prophesying that when
[3:53:34] Jesus
[3:53:36] comes, he's going to make us once again
[3:53:41] kings and priests.
[3:53:46] And now an adopted
[3:53:49] son exercises the authority of his
[3:53:53] father. And it's the
[3:53:56] father that makes that authority
[3:54:01] work. Are you together with me? So I
[3:54:04] want you to see here. When David saw
[3:54:08] that Solomon was a mature
[3:54:11] seed, he said, "Now
[3:54:15] Solomon must be sworn in as king over
[3:54:18] Judah and
[3:54:22] Israel. Now we are used to the natural
[3:54:27] way that a hair in a natural
[3:54:31] family waits for his father to
[3:54:35] die. But we thank God that we serve a
[3:54:39] God who doesn't
[3:54:44] die. That's why
[3:54:46] David painting the picture of God
[3:54:50] here calls in
[3:54:53] Solomon and said go and cause him to
[3:54:55] ride on my
[3:54:58] new and let all the nation
[3:55:02] cry. God save the king. We got to save
[3:55:05] the
[3:55:06] king. Isn't that
[3:55:09] wonderful? We have fellow
[3:55:11] hairs with Christ to the father.
[3:55:15] In the name of Jesus, we share with all
[3:55:18] the authorities that he left behind for
[3:55:22] us. Amen. So listen now. David planned
[3:55:27] for Solomon's
[3:55:30] incoming. And I want to say any real God
[3:55:35] called
[3:55:38] pastor must
[3:55:40] prepare for
[3:55:45] [Applause]
[3:55:48] Solomon. He planned for Solomon's
[3:55:53] incoming. He set up the
[3:55:56] kingdom. He pointed to him where the
[3:55:58] dangers were in the kingdom.
[3:56:04] He organized the materials for the
[3:56:08] tabernacle. He even gave him the order
[3:56:10] of
[3:56:11] service. So
[3:56:13] Solomon slept I mean stepped into
[3:56:17] continuity and that's what you are doing
[3:56:20] now.
[3:56:21] You are not replacing
[3:56:25] nothing, but you are coming into the
[3:56:28] continuity with the authority of the
[3:56:31] father standing behind
[3:56:35] [Applause]
[3:56:38] you. And you now have all it
[3:56:42] takes to build the
[3:56:46] tabernacle and the
[3:56:48] kingdom to higher heights.
[3:56:53] David is not giving you an empty
[3:56:57] kingdom. He has taught you. He has
[3:57:00] instructed
[3:57:01] you. He has adopted you and is giving
[3:57:06] you a
[3:57:07] kingdom knowing that you have got the
[3:57:10] ability to build you to the
[3:57:16] higher. What David was not able to do.
[3:57:20] Solomon
[3:57:21] did. What I have failed to
[3:57:24] do, James will
[3:57:26] do. What I have failed to do is because
[3:57:31] the season for
[3:57:33] it had not come.
[3:57:41] I will take you into this scripture.
[3:57:45] And David
[3:57:47] said in 1 Corinthians
[3:57:51] 22:5, "My son is
[3:57:57] young and
[3:57:59] tender, and the house that is to be
[3:58:02] imputed for the Lord must be ex
[3:58:06] exceeding magnificial.
[3:58:18] of
[3:58:19] fame and of
[3:58:22] glory throughout all the
[3:58:25] countries. I'll therefore now make
[3:58:27] preparation for
[3:58:32] it. So
[3:58:34] David
[3:58:36] prepared
[3:58:38] abundantly before his
[3:58:43] death to build a magnificent
[3:58:48] kingdom. And that
[3:58:51] kingdom was not
[3:58:53] Solomon. No, the kingdom is not going to
[3:58:58] be you.
[3:59:00] The kingdom is the life of Christ in the
[3:59:05] people. The kingdom is in you.
[3:59:09] So let your
[3:59:11] ministry open the hearts of these
[3:59:14] people that King
[3:59:20] Theophony may build in their
[3:59:23] hearts, the
[3:59:25] kingdom of
[3:59:28] Mechisedc, the kingdom of
[3:59:31] righteousness and peace.
[3:59:36] Make
[3:59:37] sure that you
[3:59:40] continue making
[3:59:42] this a peaceful island in a troubled
[3:59:54] waters. I'm saying these
[3:59:57] things so that they can be remembered of
[4:00:01] you in the years that you serve.
[4:00:07] We are people who
[4:00:09] came without
[4:00:11] guidance. We just dug our
[4:00:15] paths. And today we thank God that he
[4:00:20] gave us sober
[4:00:23] minds to be what we
[4:00:30] are. Let's go to the last scripture
[4:00:32] here.
[4:00:34] one
[4:00:37] as brother Robert's family will be
[4:00:39] making way here.
[4:00:46] This is Hebrews chapter
[4:00:49] 7 and verse
[4:00:52] one. For this
[4:00:56] mech, king of
[4:00:58] Salem because he says he has made us
[4:01:02] kings and
[4:01:04] priests. So for this
[4:01:08] Melisd, king of
[4:01:10] Salem, priest of the most high
[4:01:13] God who met Abraham.
[4:01:17] returning from the slaughter of the
[4:01:21] kings and blessed
[4:01:25] him. He had been in the
[4:01:28] battles. He was
[4:01:31] exhausted but
[4:01:33] Melisd met him in the valley of Shave.
[4:01:47] Amen. Amen. You know, battles are
[4:01:51] fought in the valley,
[4:01:55] but doesn't
[4:01:56] matter. Mechisedc was there to
[4:02:01] strengthen the hands of
[4:02:05] Abraham. And the scripture say for this
[4:02:11] Melchisedc
[4:02:14] So this
[4:02:17] mechisedc not the mech in the valley
[4:02:24] of mechisedc
[4:02:27] in the present
[4:02:29] tense
[4:02:31] Hebrews 138.
[4:02:37] For this
[4:02:39] Melisd, the one whom brother Brham
[4:02:42] identified in the
[4:02:45] service. And he says, who is
[4:02:50] this? He says to whom also Abraham gave
[4:02:53] a tenth part of
[4:02:57] all. cross by
[4:03:00] interpretation king of
[4:03:02] righteousness and after that also king
[4:03:06] of which is king of
[4:03:08] peace. Amen. Amen. So he has made
[4:03:12] us kings and
[4:03:15] priests by dropping his
[4:03:19] nature. He drops the nature of mech in
[4:03:23] you.
[4:03:26] He gives you a drop of
[4:03:29] himself. And if you are a king, you are
[4:03:32] a king of
[4:03:34] righteousness. And if you are a king,
[4:03:37] you are a king of peace. This is what
[4:03:40] the church should
[4:03:43] do. Build that kind of
[4:03:47] kingdom. Amen. So this king
[4:03:51] Theophan has been made a continuing
[4:03:57] priest. The scripture says he's a priest
[4:04:02] continually. He's a priest
[4:04:05] today as he was
[4:04:07] yesterday. And as you stand as a priest
[4:04:11] among the people, let that anointing
[4:04:14] drop upon
[4:04:16] you to build the kingdom of
[4:04:20] peace, the kingdom of
[4:04:23] righteousness among the
[4:04:25] people. The King
[4:04:27] Theophan, a continuing
[4:04:30] priesthood, he's the one committing to
[4:04:33] you this
[4:04:34] office and he wants to use your
[4:04:38] [Music]
[4:04:40] instrumentality to help these people.
[4:04:46] In
[4:04:47] finishing, I want you to hear this.
[4:04:52] What made
[4:04:54] Israel What made Israel a great
[4:04:58] kingdom was not the size of land they
[4:05:06] had and it was not the amount of people
[4:05:09] they
[4:05:11] had but it's the
[4:05:13] God that was always in
[4:05:20] their maintain that presence
[4:05:23] here and God will bless
[4:05:27] you. He was among
[4:05:30] them. He went with them into the
[4:05:33] harvest. He went with them into the
[4:05:36] worship. He went with them into the
[4:05:39] battles. That was the
[4:05:41] strength of the
[4:05:44] church. May his presence work with
[4:05:48] you. And like you held my hands in
[4:05:53] battle, I will hold your hands in
[4:05:59] [Applause]
[4:06:04] battle. I will stand by
[4:06:07] you. You've got men of
[4:06:11] honor that are not standing against
[4:06:14] their word.
[4:06:17] Brother David
[4:06:19] here, brother Fred.
[4:06:23] You'll hear from them in the
[4:06:26] afternoon. They are going to stand by
[4:06:28] your side.
[4:06:32] [Applause]
[4:06:38] Together with you,
[4:06:41] we shall stand.
[4:06:48] And we shall
[4:06:51] make the end of this journey.
[4:06:56] The
[4:06:58] responsibility is now in your heart.
[4:07:06] Brother
[4:07:07] Robert, if you can come
[4:07:12] over, the Lord has prospered our
[4:07:18] brother. When he was working
[4:07:21] here, the people tell me I keep
[4:07:23] prophesying.
[4:07:27] But when you place the word in its right
[4:07:32] perspective, the word is prophetic.
[4:07:35] Maybe the rest of you can sit in the
[4:07:38] meantime, but brother, you can
[4:07:44] come. You know, it becomes prophetic.
[4:07:51] Brother
[4:07:52] Robert in the early
[4:07:56] 90s they were giving him
[4:08:00] 50,000 and he said I'm
[4:08:04] leaving. I said don't
[4:08:07] leave. I say if anybody
[4:08:12] hears that you have worked
[4:08:24] [Music]
[4:08:25] here. Praise the Lord.
[4:08:28] I said if they
[4:08:30] hear you have been working for those
[4:08:34] people all those
[4:08:36] years
[4:08:38] everybody will want to appeal
[4:08:41] you and that is the
[4:08:44] truth. When he went
[4:08:47] out the Lord has blessed
[4:08:54] him when he was at last post.
[4:08:59] He said,
[4:09:00] "Pastor, I want to
[4:09:03] retire and concentrate in the
[4:09:07] gospel." I said, "That's a good
[4:09:10] idea, but let God
[4:09:13] himself tell you to leave." Between that
[4:09:17] time and the time he was going to
[4:09:20] leave, something
[4:09:23] happened that caused him to walk out
[4:09:25] with a big blessing.
[4:09:32] So we thank God and we give him the
[4:09:36] glory for our brother
[4:09:39] Robert. We want to ordain
[4:09:42] him for the job that the Lord has given
[4:09:45] him to
[4:09:48] do and his family standing by his
[4:09:52] side. I invite the pastor
[4:09:57] And I ask
[4:10:01] brother to
[4:10:03] handle this.
[4:10:08] [Music]
[4:10:16] We pray. Amen.
[4:10:20] [Music]
[4:10:22] This is the Lord's
[4:10:25] doing is
[4:10:28] wonderful in our sight.
[4:10:33] Heavenly Father,
[4:10:37] we see a wonderful precedent
[4:10:43] of a
[4:10:44] man that you have approved
[4:10:48] [Music]
[4:10:49] through
[4:10:51] fairies, through
[4:10:54] thicket, through mountains.
[4:11:00] Lord still in his youth
[4:11:04] in his
[4:11:05] figure, anointing and
[4:11:08] inspiration. You have guided
[4:11:14] him to ordain this
[4:11:18] ministry for the church in
[4:11:23] Campara. Pressing all this
[4:11:27] responsibility in the hands of
[4:11:30] Lobat your
[4:11:32] servant and his family
[4:11:36] father in the name of the living God.
[4:11:40] In the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:11:44] Christ, we lay our hands as your
[4:11:49] ministers. Giving our precious brother
[4:11:53] Robert our hand of
[4:11:56] fellowship. We will stand with him. We
[4:11:59] will pray for him. We will walk with him
[4:12:03] even as he takes this
[4:12:06] responsibility. Oh heavenly father which
[4:12:09] has been very well estimated this
[4:12:13] afternoon by thy servant
[4:12:16] pass in his
[4:12:19] hands and

[4:12:25] Christ take his soul
[4:12:29] that it the soul will always amen
[4:12:34] your take his spirit
[4:12:37] his mind. Possess it Lord by the Holy
[4:12:41] Spirit. Give him strength in his body.
[4:12:45] Give him health. Give him wisdom. Humit
[4:12:49] heavenly father to
[4:12:52] serve to
[4:12:53] feed the sheep and the lambs of Jesus
[4:12:59] Christ. his precious
[4:13:02] wife, his
[4:13:04] children are called into this
[4:13:07] ministry together with him. Give them
[4:13:10] the
[4:13:11] grace. Give them hearts that can bear,
[4:13:15] hearts can
[4:13:16] forbear, hearts that can stand in the
[4:13:20] situations the difficult times
[4:13:23] come and the wind of opposition comes
[4:13:26] his way. Precious heavenly father, May
[4:13:30] he find sies in the loving
[4:13:32] wife, understanding in his precious
[4:13:36] children. Commit them in your hearts in
[4:13:38] the church he is pastoring. Precious
[4:13:41] heavenly father, may you continue to
[4:13:44] give them grace in their
[4:13:46] hearts. Lord Jesus, they will stand with
[4:13:48] their pastor. Heavenly Father, may you
[4:13:52] go, heavenly god, guide him into wider
[4:13:57] ministry. Not just the local church, but
[4:14:00] if you as you prove him in the local
[4:14:02] church, open doors, heavenly father,
[4:14:05] inspire him, direct him, guide his
[4:14:10] footsteps as we do this and lay our
[4:14:13] hands on our precious brother
[4:14:14] [Music]
[4:14:16] Robert in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:14:19] Christ.
[4:14:22] [Music]
[4:14:22] [Applause]
[4:14:24] [Music]
[4:14:28] Hallelujah. Amen.
[4:14:33] The Lord will be with
[4:14:35] you.
[4:14:37] Amen. God bless you.

[4:16:22] way among our new
[4:16:25] brothers and all the other areas of
[4:16:29] call. And
[4:16:31] whenever the pastor needs my
[4:16:35] presence, I will always be

[4:17:55] Lord that is calling me his

[4:19:08] us. God bless you, brethren. Can we all
[4:19:11] stand
[4:19:13] [Music]
[4:19:15] up? Let us humble ourselves and bow our
[4:19:19] heads before the
[4:19:20] Lord as we close
[4:19:24] this
[4:19:27] pray. Let us close our eyes and say a
[4:19:30] word of
[4:19:31] prayer. Father, we raise our
[4:19:34] hands and we bow our heads before
[4:19:37] you seeing that such a humble occasion
[4:19:41] has taken
[4:19:43] place. A very important
[4:19:46] occasion in
[4:19:49] love handing
[4:19:51] over. It is not common. Oh
[4:19:54] God, it is you. Oh
[4:19:57] master, we want to appreciate you.
[4:19:59] Loving
[4:20:00] father, we want to bless your holy name

[4:20:15] Lord. Bless our precious brother
[4:20:18] James and his ministry.

[4:21:53] We thank
[4:21:54] God for this day. Is the day the Lord
[4:21:57] has made for us to be glad and rejoice.
[4:22:01] Uh these are rare
[4:22:03] occurrences and they are right in the
[4:22:06] [Music]
[4:22:10] scripture. It's right in the scripture.
[4:22:13] The events that
[4:22:14] happen and you really you're right in
[4:22:17] the middle of
[4:22:19] scripture as the scriptures were being
[4:22:21] read.
[4:22:22] We are being blessed. So we are going to
[4:22:25] move as follows.
[4:22:28] I really
[4:22:29] request and if you don't
[4:22:32] mind assume that those doors are
[4:22:37] closed. Let's all move out through these
[4:22:41] doors and move to the
[4:22:44] tents so that we save
[4:22:46] time. I know we are many. We've not met
[4:22:49] for very long and we may take a long
[4:22:52] time to even sit down
[4:22:56] again. I don't know about you, but I'm
[4:22:59] anxious to hear
[4:23:01] more. I'm anxious to hear
[4:23:04] more. So, I want us to get there
[4:23:07] quickly as we get to learn so we can
[4:23:09] hear
[4:23:15] more. So, let's save the time.
[4:23:19] by using these exit
[4:23:21] doors. Let's go and sit in there so that
[4:23:25] we can move on with the next
[4:23:27] program as we get also to have our
[4:23:30] lunch. There's I believe a lot to say.
[4:23:34] When I look at all of
[4:23:35] you, you need to say
[4:23:38] something. You need to say
[4:23:39] [Music]
[4:23:42] something. Let's save the time. Okay.
