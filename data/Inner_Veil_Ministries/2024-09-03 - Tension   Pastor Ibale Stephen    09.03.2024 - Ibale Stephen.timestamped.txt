[28:12] apart the economy is falling
[28:15] apart the politics is falling
[28:18] apart family is falling
[28:21] apart nations are falling
[28:24] apart so the world is on tension

[28:39] place so pray for this
[28:42] country pray for the

[30:23] Lamentations 3se
[30:30] if the it is of the Lord's mercies that
[30:33] we are not consumed because his
[30:36] compassions fail
[30:45] not they unew every
[30:48] morning great is thy
[30:54] faithfulness may the Lord had blessing
[30:57] the reading of his word
[31:00] you may be
[31:04] seated so today I want to speak on a
[31:08] very small
[31:12] subject the subject of
[31:18] tensions
[31:20] tensions you know tension
[31:24] everywhere you know the word tension
[31:29] May mean being stretched
[31:37] out just like you are dealing with the
[31:41] rubber and you pull
[31:44] it you tense
[31:47] it it can
[31:49] break so this is the tension that's on
[31:52] the world
[31:56] today the world
[31:58] May
[31:59] mean being taken to the limits of
[32:02] patience or
[32:10] Temperance May mean stress due to Moun
[32:18] pressure
[32:21] pressure all a mental strain
[32:28] due to a opposing ideology of a
[32:34] matter amen amen tension is a mind in
[32:41] turbulence tension is a mind
[32:47] inul conflicting over a
[32:53] matter the matter that may not be is Sol
[33:02] it puts you under
[33:05] tension could be a
[33:08] conflict over
[33:11] values you know should I take this
[33:14] should I take
[33:16] that it could be caused by a matter
[33:19] between two
[33:21] people that are bound in a
[33:26] relationship like husband and
[33:29] wife and you see you cannot break your
[33:34] relationship but there are two opposing
[33:37] ideas between
[33:42] you that causes
[33:46] tension amen tension is not a very good
[33:50] thing but is something that we can never
[33:55] avoid amen one would also describe
[34:00] tension as the pressure one
[34:05] experiences in Coming to
[34:09] Terms in a choice of conflicting
[34:16] interests so the world
[34:19] today is in a state of
[34:22] tension and brother
[34:24] Bram described it as the w falling
[34:30] apart so the world is falling
[34:33] apart and every
[34:35] politician every
[34:37] denomination and every church will fall
[34:41] to
[34:43] pieces the political systems are falling
[34:48] apart the UN is falling
[34:52] apart the churches are falling
[34:55] apart the denominations are
[34:58] fall the tension is all over the
[35:02] air in every sector businessmen and
[35:08] attention because different things
[35:10] happen around the world of business
[35:13] every
[35:16] morning the economy is
[35:20] in but thank God that we got a kingdom
[35:25] that cannot be mov
[35:28] it is the Eternal kingdom of
[35:31] God it cannot be
[35:34] more and in the light of all the global
[35:39] turmo know Global
[35:43] turo God needed to congratulate brother
[35:48] Bram by
[35:50] prophecy when he had battled different
[35:56] options and came out up with the right
[36:00] decision as I speak to you
[36:03] all you are having tension over
[36:05] different
[36:08] opinion and so when brother BR made the
[36:11] right
[36:13] decision amen there was a
[36:16] prophecy which was interpreted by Dan
[36:20] Henry and God was
[36:23] saying because thou H has chosen the
[36:25] Narrow Path
[36:28] the hard way thou has walked in your own
[36:32] children amen now sometimes we need to
[36:37] know that when we come to moments of
[36:41] tension it's not the way of list
[36:47] resistance amen that will be
[36:50] right sometimes the harder
[36:54] option is what you need
[36:58] and that's how it is a
[37:00] paradox and God congratulates brother
[37:03] BR for looking at all
[37:07] options and then choosing the
[37:10] Hardway he says thou has picked the
[37:12] correct and precise
[37:16] decision and it's my
[37:18] way because of this momentous
[37:22] decision a huge portion of heaven will
[37:25] await thee
[37:28] meaning so many
[37:30] people will be waiting for you over
[37:33] there what a glorious decision thou Hast
[37:38] made this in
[37:40] itself is that which will
[37:43] give and make come to
[37:46] pass the tremendous victory in the love
[37:51] divine making the right
[37:55] choices the right choices in life
[37:58] so what happened here is stepped in the
[38:02] moment of
[38:04] tension to come to that hard
[38:07] decision and yet it was the right
[38:10] one so he needed the wisdom of
[38:15] Revelation he needed
[38:17] prayer and
[38:19] determination so it was tension and it
[38:23] will always be tension this world will
[38:26] never be
[38:28] peace until Christ
[38:30] come and you will never be free of
[38:35] tension until you have been
[38:38] changed from moral to
[38:41] immortality that's the only world where
[38:43] there is no
[38:45] tension you are going to have tension in
[38:47] your
[38:48] marriage you are going to have tension
[38:51] in your
[38:52] business you are going to have tension
[38:54] with your
[38:55] children tension is a way of
[38:59] life
[39:01] amen now it was
[39:04] tension when the children of Israel were
[39:08] being pushed by the Egyptian
[39:11] soldiers and all of the sudden in front
[39:14] of
[39:15] them was the Red Sea it was tension
[39:20] moments like that
[39:22] come when we are standing between the
[39:24] Rock and the hard place
[39:29] [Music]
[39:33] so when the three Hebrew
[39:36] children were first by the fire
[39:40] furnace that was
[39:42] tension they were saying make it
[39:47] hotter seven times and then these boys
[39:51] were they
[39:53] waiting for the hottest spot of the fire
[39:58] and now they would be thrown into
[40:02] the amen it was tension but they chose
[40:07] the hard
[40:08] way amen and they say whether our God
[40:13] delivers
[40:14] us he doesn't Deliver us we would rather
[40:18] die in the
[40:19] fire than b the
[40:23] images amen it's always tension
[40:27] it was tension when es saw this
[40:32] birth because he was seeing no
[40:35] future amen it was tension when the
[40:39] doctor
[40:41] pronounced that we have nothing to do
[40:44] for
[40:44] you you just live the way you are until
[40:48] you
[40:48] die it has always been
[40:51] T amen it is tension when you stood up
[40:57] and told the world about the way you are
[41:00] going to live your
[41:02] life it built
[41:04] tension you began to be very
[41:08] careful step you take in
[41:10] life we are talking about
[41:13] t amen so many people say I've got a
[41:18] mind
[41:20] tabulous mind turbulance
[41:30] you must learn to leave to the tension
[41:34] that we are living in in this world
[41:37] now it's going to be hard and going to
[41:41] be
[41:42] harder amen listen to The Prophet here
[41:46] in the M uniting time and
[41:51] sign some people try to introduce
[41:55] Christianity that you are free from
[41:59] worry no you are not you are not free
[42:03] from
[42:05] tension
[42:10] you when you become a
[42:13] Christian because you are kind
[42:17] [Music]
[42:20] ofy whatever it was out there not caring
[42:24] what you did
[42:28] are you together with me yeah you know
[42:31] people say you receive Jesus
[42:33] Christ and you are going to be free know
[42:37] your freedom is you trusting in the Lord
[42:41] for every situation that comes
[42:44] before but the will always be
[42:47] test previously before that you used to
[42:52] do whatever you
[42:53] wanted if it was drinking you would
[42:55] drink your heart would not be
[42:58] condemned if it was going to night club
[43:01] you would go and you would not be
[43:04] bothered but you made a decision and you
[43:08] told the world that you are going to
[43:11] live as a
[43:12] Christian and that now build the tension
[43:17] around amen because you no
[43:21] longer do what you wanted to do in your
[43:25] own eyes
[43:27] amen you are now faced with the
[43:29] challenges of the
[43:34] seison and making the right
[43:38] decisions sometimes the harder
[43:40] choices amen yes ago we used to pray
[43:45] when we
[43:47] wanted but now it's not like that you
[43:51] you pray As you move you pray as you
[43:54] walk on the street you pray when you in
[43:56] your
[43:58] you pray every time amen you studed the
[44:02] Bible when you wanted
[44:04] to but when you are a Christian there is
[44:07] a tension that pushes you
[44:10] forward amen you choose whom to you know
[44:14] when we out there we chose whom to
[44:17] love and whom to ha whom to forgive and
[44:22] not to
[44:23] forgive but now you are obligated
[44:28] to do the right
[44:29] thing amen amen let me say this before
[44:34] you were
[44:36] Christian you used to surender whoever
[44:38] you
[44:41] wanted
[44:45] [Music]
[44:47] toen because it would give you some
[44:52] premin but when you became a
[44:55] Christian you don't do that
[44:58] anymore amen so let me tell you this is
[45:02] a
[45:03] principle that killing your old
[45:07] habits will constantly keep you on
[45:12] taste because they F you all the
[45:15] time and that puts your in
[45:17] tension the prophet says here in the
[45:21] uniting time and
[45:23] sign he says but when you become a
[45:26] Christian
[45:28] every moment you are
[45:30] wondering am I pleasing my
[45:33] Lord I could hear from
[45:36] him it puts you on
[45:38] tension puts you on
[45:40] God that's what makes
[45:43] you what you are so after all tension is
[45:48] a
[45:51] blessing you always wondering am I
[45:54] pleasing you am I doing the right
[45:58] should I do this should I not do that it
[46:01] is tension and that tension will live
[46:04] with you
[46:06] forever amen then the prophet still says
[46:11] if I could have been born without this
[46:15] T I wouldn't have been what I
[46:18] am I wouldn't have been a
[46:21] Christian amen it was this tension that
[46:25] drove me to Jesus
[46:28] so it's been a blessing thing to
[46:32] me amen the pressure you
[46:36] have when you chose to come to the
[46:39] altar that was a
[46:41] blessing if you were born without
[46:44] realizing what tension
[46:48] means you wouldn't be what you are
[46:51] to so today tension is a
[46:55] blessing tension is God's
[46:58] way pushing us to stand in respect of
[47:01] the choices we make in
[47:06] life we made choices for our
[47:10] partners we said we shall love
[47:13] them we said we shall hon and cherish
[47:18] them in sickness and
[47:21] health in Riches of
[47:23] poverty we forsake all others and CLE on
[47:27] to
[47:28] them but you have to make the right
[47:32] decision you said in
[47:35] poverty all riches even when there is no
[47:39] money you are tast of
[47:45] God to honor your
[47:49] obligation amen your
[47:52] obligation amen that will constantly put
[47:55] your tension
[47:57] to fulfill your
[48:00] vows Amen to
[48:03] fulfill the desire of your heart that
[48:07] your people will be my people where you
[48:11] die I will die you made the decision
[48:15] that you are supposed to respect and
[48:18] that puts you in
[48:19] P amen we have tensions in the
[48:24] public because we told the world
[48:28] that we're going to live as
[48:30] Christians and as we first the trials of
[48:34] life we keep saying we have gone too
[48:38] far to go
[48:40] back amen the journey we've covered is
[48:44] too
[48:45] far it doesn't matter I told the world I
[48:50] will not drink again and I've gone so
[48:54] far to turn back and go back to
[48:57] the you understand what I
[49:00] meantion is
[49:04] good it keeps a Christian on
[49:08] God you need tension in your family
[49:13] relationship amen so that you may learn
[49:16] to submit one to
[49:23] another tension is the driving force
[49:28] of a
[49:29] Christian a Christian without tension in
[49:33] life cannot make it as a
[49:37] Christian amen listen see brother BR
[49:41] say speaking of
[49:43] tension I was praying about it this
[49:48] morning what would you
[49:52] do if you
[49:58] what would you do he says just think of
[50:01] it tension is a part of
[50:04] living that kind of encouraged
[50:07] me when I thought
[50:10] that if you had no
[50:13] tension you would be like
[50:18] [Music]
[50:22] a you have no
[50:24] feelings there be
[50:27] you could work
[50:30] on if you have
[50:32] notion you don't know what's good you
[50:36] don't know what's
[50:39] bad if you had
[50:41] no then you wouldn't have anything in
[50:45] your life to work
[50:48] on it would be so
[50:52] unfortunate because you could not be
[50:54] able to tell your
[50:58] understanding amen but every morning you
[51:02] wake up in the morning you wake up
[51:05] challenge will you do this again will
[51:08] you do that again there is a tension and
[51:12] the life of the chrisan is driven by
[51:16] tension amen tension tells me to work on
[51:21] my
[51:24] temper T tells me
[51:27] that I'm obligated to my
[51:30] family amen so as a Christian you need
[51:34] to accept your weak
[51:38] areas without putting up a
[51:49] fight to accept your weak
[51:53] areas without a fire it will cause
[51:57] tension but it will cause you to repair
[52:01] your weak
[52:03] areas amen T brother says really brings
[52:09] you closer
[52:12] together amen if you are a husband and a
[52:16] wife and there station it brings you
[52:20] closer if tension divides the family
[52:24] there is something wrong but when
[52:26] tension
[52:28] you look at where am I
[52:30] contributing are you together with me
[52:33] yeah the husband will say why am I
[52:36] failing in my
[52:39] responsibility I'm talking to brother
[52:42] Henry to brother Henry you just married
[52:47] yesterday amen marriage is not such kind
[52:50] of a bird of
[52:53] roses that you are going to live like
[52:55] honeymoon for
[52:58] forever that smiling sister
[53:01] there one time wakes up with a bad
[53:05] face there is a tension an tension
[53:10] reveals something to be
[53:13] worked amen good brother Steven heard
[53:17] that
[53:20] amen praise the Lord he says and
[53:24] somebody tells you that
[53:26] just think of the little
[53:30] wife that went under a lot of
[53:35] T when he wasn't so good all the husband
[53:41] went under some
[53:43] tension when he wasn't so good then when
[53:46] he so
[53:48] forgiven look how you feel about
[53:52] it amen then he says oh my see you got
[53:58] to have tension
[54:02] all he says you have to have
[54:05] tension tension is good for you you
[54:09] sometimes come to the pastor I don't
[54:11] know what is happening we are not
[54:13] talking we are writing
[54:19] cheat I want to tell you something here
[54:23] there is a man who had a trip and they
[54:26] will have having those bad moments of
[54:29] tension and he was a bad
[54:32] sleeper and so he couldn't want to be
[54:36] the first one to break the
[54:37] [Music]
[54:39] silence or to break the
[54:47] silence so now he wrot a
[54:49] che wake me up at 5:00 in the
[54:54] morning and then when it was
[54:57] 5:00 the sister wrote a cheat it is 5:00
[55:02] in the morning wake
[55:09] up you see
[55:12] sometimes we need to accept
[55:17] tensions and when it's there you don't
[55:21] Dodge the
[55:23] tension because it's telling you there
[55:25] is something here that we need to speak
[55:31] about so tension in any form
[55:36] of either
[55:38] family or church means you have a
[55:43] concern you just have to drive your
[55:45] concerns the right
[55:48] way amen if you have a conern don't use
[55:53] it as a form of criticism
[55:57] amen tensions will be there when we fa
[56:00] to deal with tensions two people can
[56:03] never live
[56:07] together amen
[56:12] so is a call to
[56:15] prayer amen listen here
[56:18] brother and just think of
[56:22] feelings what you didn't have what if
[56:26] you didn't have any
[56:29] feeling no pains or Nothing what if
[56:34] there been no pain at
[56:36] all you would have no feelings at
[56:39] all and if you had no feelings then one
[56:43] of your senses would be
[56:45] gone so see
[56:48] everything is just right
[56:52] anyhow so God just give us Grace
[56:57] to stand up to
[56:59] it that's the thing if I just stand up
[57:03] with that
[57:05] Grace and stand there and say we know
[57:09] that when this life is
[57:12] over the great one is on the other
[57:16] side where we are look going
[57:18] to and we remember that all these
[57:24] things that t
[57:30] good things will bring
[57:32] T and bad things will bring
[57:35] T when you have got a greater
[57:39] desire like brother Sten want is leaving
[57:43] in
[57:45] now it will bring
[57:48] tension when the family is breaking
[57:51] apart it is still tension so we need as
[57:55] Christians
[57:57] to believe that tension is what makes up
[58:00] our
[58:02] lives we can as well just learn how to
[58:05] deal with tension in our
[58:09] lives amen God allows
[58:13] tensions not
[58:15] separate but that we may get
[58:19] concerned and in certain times he will
[58:22] build these
[58:23] tensions in our individual lives
[58:27] TOA us to
[58:28] stop and over our
[58:34] lives amen he can allow us and you see
[58:39] once you don't deal with
[58:42] tension there will be a
[58:45] break amen you pull a
[58:48] rubber and it is so
[58:51] T and then you
[58:53] continue it you break
[58:57] the tension was too
[58:59] much that this rubber had to
[59:04] break when we were
[59:06] children we used to play with
[59:09] balloons then we would inflate them and
[59:13] when you infl a
[59:15] balloon that is
[59:17] tension if you exceed the tension then
[59:21] the balloon will burst
[59:26] would be having a very wonderful
[59:29] fellowship if all the families
[59:33] understand that life can only be
[59:36] governed by
[59:38] tensions because tensions
[59:42] declare that there is something to deal
[59:45] with amen and sometimes in your
[59:48] Christian
[59:50] Life as an
[59:52] individual as a person God will allow
[59:56] tension in your life so that you may
[1:00:00] stop and
[1:00:02] Ponder I take you to Second
[1:00:06] Corinthians chter
[1:00:08] 12 and verse 7 the
[1:00:12] blessing of
[1:00:15] tension now he says here unless I should
[1:00:21] be exalted above
[1:00:23] measure through the abundance of the re
[1:00:26] s there was given to me a Thor in the
[1:00:30] flesh the message of Satan to Buffet me
[1:00:34] lest I should be exalted above measure
[1:00:36] second Corinthians 127
[1:00:57] now I want you to see here a bance of
[1:01:02] Revelation and then a th
[1:01:06] here you understand what I mean God you
[1:01:10] are the one giving me this
[1:01:12] Revelations then why are you giving me a
[1:01:15] Thor in my
[1:01:17] flesh because this Thor here becomes a
[1:01:23] governor amen when you overcome
[1:01:28] this then the th goes a little
[1:01:32] deeper and then you come down then you a
[1:01:36] little
[1:01:37] better now this is the individual life
[1:01:39] of
[1:01:41] Paul amen that Paul I've given you a lot
[1:01:46] of
[1:01:47] Revelations but you are
[1:01:49] human and I want tell you you will not
[1:01:53] be able to govern this level of
[1:01:55] revelation
[1:01:58] so I'll give you something in your
[1:02:01] body to keep turning you
[1:02:04] down amen and then Paul in that
[1:02:09] condition he says in verse
[1:02:12] 8 for this thing I the Lord
[1:02:18] thce that it may depart from me and he
[1:02:22] said unto me my grace is enough for
[1:02:28] you have you really had a situation in
[1:02:32] life maybe you've had some pressure dtic
[1:02:37] conditions your nerves trouble
[1:02:40] you and you see when you are young and
[1:02:43] I'm saying these things you may not be
[1:02:46] able to
[1:02:48] understand but you get to a
[1:02:50] situation where your body instead of
[1:02:54] being a blessing
[1:02:56] it is a
[1:02:59] b have you come to such a
[1:03:02] point and then you go to God Who Says by
[1:03:06] my stripes you will
[1:03:09] heal and then he tells you my grace is
[1:03:11] enough for
[1:03:14] you that puts on a lot of
[1:03:18] tension but on the other side is very
[1:03:22] good because it keeps you in the
[1:03:24] presence of the Lord
[1:03:28] amen he said unto me my grace is enough
[1:03:31] for
[1:03:33] thee for my strength is made perfect in
[1:03:38] weakness most gladly therefore will I
[1:03:41] rather glory in the
[1:03:48] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[1:03:50] rest upon
[1:03:52] me hallelujah hallelujah that I will
[1:03:56] glory in my
[1:03:59] weakness that the power of God may be
[1:04:02] glorified in
[1:04:04] me amen praise the Lord so tension in
[1:04:09] Paul's
[1:04:11] life was intended to breed his P due to
[1:04:15] Great
[1:04:19] Revelation to keep him on his
[1:04:22] knees to keep depending on the
[1:04:24] supernatural
[1:04:28] is a blessing in this
[1:04:31] guys especially in the Min the life of a
[1:04:36] minister because we have the
[1:04:39] ability to hear from God on certain
[1:04:44] issues sometimes that are so crucial and
[1:04:46] so
[1:04:49] spiritual and if you don't have some
[1:04:53] tension you will be able to go up like
[1:04:58] that amen so as a
[1:05:01] minister you know one need to be
[1:05:04] conscious of
[1:05:07] humility amen because when we
[1:05:11] preaching the World Church is saying
[1:05:14] amen especially the World Church
[1:05:17] sometimes getting to of certain fact
[1:05:28] there is a
[1:05:30] temptation of taking you at the top of
[1:05:33] the
[1:05:35] Tabernacle that's what the devil was
[1:05:37] trying to do to the
[1:05:39] law that there is no body in the
[1:05:42] Tabernacle greater than
[1:05:44] you every body is below
[1:05:47] you amen so
[1:05:50] ministers need to ear you know humility
[1:05:59] then some of the ministers say
[1:06:01] yeah Jesus was
[1:06:04] humble but he had to get
[1:06:09] a and drove the people out of the
[1:06:12] temple that's true but was he doing it
[1:06:20] daily was he doing it daily that is just
[1:06:24] getting a weap and hipping the people
[1:06:27] and whipping the people and knocking
[1:06:29] their
[1:06:30] heads Jesus didn't do that
[1:06:34] always we need
[1:06:38] humility brother Bram would
[1:06:41] say and may your gift come down
[1:06:45] lord tonight upon your humble
[1:06:50] servant and may it be a night of all
[1:06:53] nights
[1:06:57] he was conscious of
[1:07:00] humility he says may your spirit come
[1:07:03] upon your servant
[1:07:08] tonight anoint me with your prophetic
[1:07:13] gift may I be able to do the things that
[1:07:16] you told me to
[1:07:18] do are you together with me he was
[1:07:22] conscious as a
[1:07:24] minister that I need to remain
[1:07:29] humble amen and then brother Bram he had
[1:07:35] cycle amen after the seven
[1:07:38] years this situation would come back
[1:07:42] again and he would get so
[1:07:45] sick he would throw up on the puet run
[1:07:48] to go to the bathroom you know he's
[1:07:51] praying for people to be healed
[1:07:55] his body was being
[1:07:58] buffeted after every seven
[1:08:02] years and then 7 Time
[1:08:05] s amen at the seventh
[1:08:09] cycle then on the message on the wings
[1:08:12] of a snow
[1:08:17] white amen that's where God told him
[1:08:22] amen that your your your enemy is dead
[1:08:26] because he would get some kind
[1:08:30] of he got a
[1:08:32] vision of this thing jumping over
[1:08:35] through into him and getting him
[1:08:39] sick and then again
[1:08:42] afterwards in that Vision when he was
[1:08:46] looking he had seen it jump and he had
[1:08:50] on Cactus
[1:08:58] and the Lord says your enemy is
[1:09:03] dead but he was going
[1:09:07] through moments of
[1:09:10] tension amen so I want to say this to
[1:09:14] you that there will be tension mounting
[1:09:17] around the body of
[1:09:21] Believers and maybe from
[1:09:24] within to help the body have a Harmony
[1:09:28] of
[1:09:31] Fellowship that's the Paradox
[1:09:34] of all these legislations coming
[1:09:40] up against the church will kick the
[1:09:44] church into
[1:09:47] tension and then bring the church
[1:09:50] together amen praise the Lord as long as
[1:09:54] we are free
[1:09:56] there is a tend of
[1:09:59] division the other day something small
[1:10:01] came
[1:10:03] up when they were dealing with the
[1:10:05] marriage
[1:10:08] bill and then one of the men who was
[1:10:11] part of this
[1:10:13] message he went into the
[1:10:16] Parliament and he says polygamy is
[1:10:20] right and he was using the name of one
[1:10:24] of the message churches
[1:10:27] and all the people came
[1:10:30] together and they were saying draw a
[1:10:33] doent and said it to us which
[1:10:38] defends that monogamy is the stand of
[1:10:41] this
[1:10:43] message I did the
[1:10:45] document praise the Lord all the
[1:10:48] brothers came together the arguments
[1:10:51] were no more there I want tell you
[1:10:54] tension is
[1:10:59] good tension is
[1:11:02] good amen now you know tension
[1:11:07] works in the good
[1:11:09] times as it works in the
[1:11:12] b sometimes you are going to have
[1:11:15] tension you are Desiring to come to
[1:11:18] terms with the certain
[1:11:22] matter and then if you don't have t
[1:11:26] you not have to you to go the message
[1:11:29] and
[1:11:32] stud but when that thing comes in did
[1:11:36] Brother Bram said
[1:11:38] this the Bible said
[1:11:41] this that's attention and it drives you
[1:11:45] into the
[1:11:46] word one day there was a testimony of a
[1:11:51] great king that went beyond the borders
[1:11:56] all the way from
[1:11:57] Jerusalem up down to
[1:12:00] Ethiopia are you together with me and
[1:12:03] then the queen out
[1:12:05] there how
[1:12:07] possible could it be that a man could be
[1:12:11] that
[1:12:13] wise so she was
[1:12:15] moved she had to cross you know she got
[1:12:18] into
[1:12:21] stress attention so she had to cross on
[1:12:27] cam three months across the
[1:12:30] desert that's not a short distance in
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:35] desert carrying tens of thousands of
[1:12:38] dollars worth of gold and
[1:12:43] silver Brave the desert
[1:12:46] robers talk about real heart
[1:12:50] tension that woman was on
[1:12:53] tension hallelujah hallelujah and I know
[1:12:57] that you were such a
[1:12:59] tension so much of
[1:13:02] attention that brought you down here to
[1:13:06] prove whether that's what the Bible
[1:13:08] teaches it was
[1:13:10] tension that led you to this
[1:13:14] message amen when the Deep calls to the
[1:13:19] Deep if there's any part of God in a
[1:13:23] man the supernatural God begins to move
[1:13:28] just amen do you remember the words of
[1:13:32] David as the heart longs for water
[1:13:39] Brooks so my soul thirsts after thee Oh
[1:13:45] God
[1:13:47] T that
[1:13:49] heart is really fasting for water
[1:13:56] he has to
[1:13:58] run until he finds the
[1:14:01] water and if a man has got God in his
[1:14:06] heart and he knows that there is an open
[1:14:08] Fountain
[1:14:11] somewhere must find
[1:14:14] that
[1:14:18] orish amen he will
[1:14:24] denyed you deny any form of
[1:14:28] anything to find a drink of a living
[1:14:33] God that's what starts the real thing
[1:14:37] moving
[1:14:41] tension if you miss
[1:14:45] services and it doesn't do any tension
[1:14:48] to your
[1:14:50] life then you are in trouble
[1:14:57] if you can insult
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:05] somebody and you do it without causing
[1:15:08] any
[1:15:10] tens then you are in
[1:15:12] trouble you are a
[1:15:17] ra as the prophet says so brother Bram
[1:15:21] tells a
[1:15:22] story of a man whose
[1:15:26] chicken didn't have enough eggs to
[1:15:29] hat so he got one dark
[1:15:34] egg and put it under the
[1:15:40] chicken and when that little duck
[1:15:42] hatched
[1:15:45] out that was the funniest
[1:15:48] looking among all the chickens
[1:15:56] because of this
[1:15:59] chicken this one
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:09] is so the chick would always be
[1:16:12] there this is a strange
[1:16:18] sister so that's about like a real
[1:16:22] believer with a nest full of this
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:27] chickens all of them picked on
[1:16:30] him he must be
[1:16:34] aoll
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] long that's what
[1:16:42] for
[1:16:48] whens together with me he's not like us
[1:16:52] those are the fs
[1:16:55] I want to say it
[1:16:57] openly the ministers
[1:17:00] initiate when they begin to promote
[1:17:03] their own
[1:17:06] groups against that other
[1:17:08] group but thank God that's not what we
[1:17:12] do
[1:17:15] here are you together with me it's a
[1:17:19] game of
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:23] black ating
[1:17:30] Spirit you know they keep picking on
[1:17:35] that so brother Bram says about that the
[1:17:40] clocking of the hand the little
[1:17:44] du he would go
[1:17:47] quack quack she would go clack
[1:17:53] clack why
[1:17:55] he didn't know that
[1:17:59] language a Believer don't know the
[1:18:02] language come in my dear

[1:18:42] churches that will give you the Holiness
[1:18:45] you

[1:18:51] that's chicken
[1:18:53] doctr so that knew there had to be a new
[1:19:01] bath
[1:19:03] so brother Bram tolds another dark
[1:19:09] story he tells Brother
[1:19:12] David who was Raising ducks in cages
[1:19:26] amen and it was near the
[1:19:29] river so the River Bank started going
[1:19:33] [Music]
[1:19:36] up the tension was coming
[1:19:40] up and the water Rose the
[1:19:44] Ducks above the
[1:19:47] cages and the BS began to Fellowship
[1:19:54] it was tension a rising
[1:19:58] River bringing the churches
[1:20:03] together
[1:20:04] tension will begin to bless
[1:20:08] us if we don't volunt fellowship with
[1:20:11] one
[1:20:16] another time will
[1:20:19] come where it will not
[1:20:22] matter which church you go
[1:20:27] it doesn't matter thews will put us
[1:20:32] out so you cannot say I am
[1:20:35] this or I am that or I am this good
[1:20:40] news we are
[1:20:45] Brethren praise the Lord many
[1:20:49] times you know uh travel strike our home
[1:20:55] sometimes travel hit our
[1:20:58] churches it's a blessing in this
[1:21:03] guys amen some people might
[1:21:07] say well you are sick just because you
[1:21:10] are not right with
[1:21:13] God not
[1:21:16] necessarily job was right with
[1:21:19] God and he was sick but is God testing
[1:21:23] you
[1:21:25] putting you on a test to see what you'll
[1:21:30] do amen he
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:35] allows the comes and doesn't
[1:21:40] go and you start wondering why
[1:21:44] me and the question why not
[1:21:48] you is you need tension at that time
[1:21:55] sometimes the
[1:21:56] tension will be in your
[1:22:00] home sometimes the tension will be in
[1:22:05] your
[1:22:06] business but we must grow to a
[1:22:10] next where we learn to
[1:22:14] believe that
[1:22:16] tension is nor
[1:22:19] more is a good
[1:22:23] thing if you don't accept
[1:22:26] T then you are going to go
[1:22:30] mental but when you
[1:22:33] realize that tension is part of
[1:22:36] life whenever the storms
[1:22:39] come just become
[1:22:42] anag and go to the eye of the
[1:22:46] stor and as it keeps
[1:22:49] really you just stretch your
[1:22:51] winds and that wind will lift you up
[1:22:56] the devil is
[1:22:58] saying it's not
[1:23:00] easy yeah he will not tell you that's
[1:23:03] the
[1:23:08] solution praise the Lord listen here
[1:23:12] brother Bram says it reminds me of a
[1:23:16] German painting in
[1:23:21] Germany we are talking about tension
[1:23:25] the blessing of
[1:23:28] it brother
[1:23:30] Steven how can you Trav is a
[1:23:34] blessing because God doesn't want to
[1:23:38] destroy
[1:23:40] you that's not how God deals with his
[1:23:44] children those Storms Come to try
[1:23:51] our amen so he says it reminds me of a
[1:23:56] German painting in
[1:24:00] German it's like the great picture of
[1:24:03] the Betrayal at Forest
[1:24:13] La so
[1:24:15] large they had to build a MTH
[1:24:19] building to put the painting
[1:24:22] in the German painting is called the
[1:24:27] cloud and when you are away from this
[1:24:32] picture it's most miserable disal
[1:24:37] looking
[1:24:42] side amen it's a bunch of clouds just
[1:24:45] mixing
[1:24:48] together and as you start walking to the
[1:24:52] picture it gives you
[1:24:56] amen oh what a dreadful sight it
[1:25:00] looks but when you get closer to it is
[1:25:04] Angels Wings beating
[1:25:07] together Hallelujah it looks
[1:25:11] different when you get
[1:25:13] there when you are far away a dreadful
[1:25:18] picture when you come closer is
[1:25:22] horrifying but when you continue and you
[1:25:26] get exactly closer you start seeing the
[1:25:29] Angels
[1:25:32] Wings hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[1:25:35] Lord I want to say something here you
[1:25:39] don't run away from

[1:25:50] together amen you need to get into the
[1:25:53] fellowship
[1:25:55] angs so that you can worship with them
[1:25:59] together amen and the closer we

[1:27:53] a
[1:27:54] Daniel the Bible says Daniel understood
[1:27:58] by

[1:28:02] messages you start studying your
[1:28:05] messages that's where we are going to
[1:28:08] get the
[1:28:09] answers to all this tension that's
[1:28:11] coming
[1:28:13] up you talk to
[1:28:15] people even brothers and they are
[1:28:20] saying when you say so what's the answer
[1:28:24] hey what have you been
[1:28:29] saying it's
[1:28:31] tension but brother Bram
[1:28:33] says in the message Christ revealed in
[1:28:36] his own
[1:28:38] word my
[1:28:41] mother my
[1:28:42] mother and your mother struck the age
[1:28:46] about 35
[1:28:56] my wife struck that age about
[1:29:01] 35 now it's down to
[1:29:04] 20 the whole human race is
[1:29:10] rot I want you to hear this very
[1:29:14] well well if them physical beings of our
[1:29:21] body is tearing down like a
[1:29:25] that from eating hybrid
[1:29:28] food
[1:29:31] tensions that rot
[1:29:33] it does not that also rot the brain
[1:29:40] cell they don't think
[1:29:48] right they just don't think
[1:29:53] right opening here the
[1:29:56] breast the one who sees is the one who
[1:29:58] will die the
[1:30:03] brain rotten
[1:30:07] cells
[1:30:10] multiplying the negative tensions among
[1:30:13] the
[1:30:15] people the people's temper is
[1:30:20] flaring just a little thing and a man's
[1:30:23] got a knife
[1:30:26] we are in the end
[1:30:29] time okay
[1:30:32] listen we can see how they can speed
[1:30:36] through the streets at 120 mil an
[1:30:47] hour is come to a place where the war
[1:30:52] Nation the world world
[1:30:54] not only this nation but everywhere
[1:30:58] mentally
[1:31:02] G what we
[1:31:05] eat is causing the brain cells to
[1:31:11] rot so that we can no longer
[1:31:16] have the quality TOs
[1:31:24] the brains have
[1:31:26] weakened and a little
[1:31:29] thing can heighten a big
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:35] T to the extent of throwing things all
[1:31:38] over the
[1:31:41] house the brain
[1:31:43] cells rotting
[1:31:48] away we subject our kids to bad
[1:31:52] food and even
[1:31:56] ourselves and we get our brain cells
[1:32:01] rotten and the decisions we make in
[1:32:05] life which will be necessary all the
[1:32:09] time is
[1:32:12] affected where brother Bram says and
[1:32:15] where God says he had made the harder
[1:32:20] choice these days the young people
[1:32:24] even older people don't want the
[1:32:28] Hardway
[1:32:32] shortcut let us finish it like that and
[1:32:35] these days they've got the
[1:32:45] song they don't want to stay in a state
[1:32:51] which is going to bother their decision
[1:32:53] making
[1:32:59] are you together with
[1:33:01] me so you
[1:33:04] know they don't think
[1:33:07] right and they find
[1:33:12] themselves doing
[1:33:15] things that will be
[1:33:17] negative in the
[1:33:20] future so we are living in the age of
[1:33:22] neurotics
[1:33:33] men that cannot handle
[1:33:38] tensions
[1:33:41] amen praise the
[1:33:43] Lord now if natural
[1:33:48] feeding affects spiritual
[1:33:51] brains I mean natural brain
[1:33:55] how about bad
[1:33:58] preaching and you subject
[1:34:02] people on something that is not balanced
[1:34:06] from Genesis
[1:34:11] Revelation what do you expect you are
[1:34:13] doing to the decision making uh
[1:34:16] principles of the
[1:34:20] people when they first t
[1:34:24] can they make a harder
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] Choice are you together with me yeah so
[1:34:34] brother
[1:34:35] Bram brings us to another height
[1:34:38] here he tells us
[1:34:42] Sal you
[1:34:44] know let me just look at it
[1:34:47] here it's uh in the message what does
[1:34:51] thou hear
[1:34:55] he says you know
[1:34:57] people
[1:34:58] listen under the juniper
[1:35:04] tree is
[1:35:08] like
[1:35:10] attention they like to
[1:35:16] sleep and brother Bram says I preach to
[1:35:20] more tired people than anybody in the
[1:35:22] world
[1:35:32] amen they just put a man where it
[1:35:35] doesn't
[1:35:40] go the brains are
[1:35:43] weak they cannot
[1:35:47] sustain one hour
[1:35:51] seron they are sleeping
[1:35:56] this is the age where we
[1:35:58] are where people don't like
[1:36:06] tension
[1:36:13] chur praise the Lord are you happy this
[1:36:16] Sunday he says I preach more people than
[1:36:19] anybody in the world
[1:36:23] people so
[1:36:25] tired they are so mentally
[1:36:29] strin until they are feeling the ins
[1:36:31] institions
[1:36:36] and hospitals
[1:36:39] everywhere they went in such a nervous
[1:36:44] condition till they don't know what they
[1:36:48] do believe and what they want
[1:36:54] they don't know what they believe they
[1:36:57] move to the next
[1:36:58] group and they are told this amen and
[1:37:03] they dance about it when they got this
[1:37:06] one something else he
[1:37:08] says to that one amen and they dance
[1:37:12] about it says they don't know what they
[1:37:17] believe they are just laying there they
[1:37:21] don't know what to do he says it is such
[1:37:24] a sad
[1:37:28] sign so if poor
[1:37:34] diet roast the brain
[1:37:37] cells how about the effect of spiritual
[1:37:43] diet what would it subject the people
[1:37:50] to that's why you see that the people
[1:37:55] have forgotten to preach
[1:37:58] Christ and they preach church and the
[1:38:01] people say
[1:38:03] amen and from there it's only our church
[1:38:07] and not that
[1:38:09] church
[1:38:12] chch and when we teach
[1:38:15] Christ the
[1:38:17] emphasis is on the
[1:38:20] letter and not the person
[1:38:26] praise the lord we feed
[1:38:30] people with negative
[1:38:33] quot which is not meant to be children's
[1:38:38] food brother Bram directed it to the
[1:38:42] Catholics
[1:38:44] organizations but now somebody picks
[1:38:47] it runs it against his own
[1:38:51] brother that's poor diet
[1:38:56] you kill the cous of the
[1:39:00] people
[1:39:01] amen and we turn our
[1:39:05] churches into
[1:39:08] neurotics because instead of arming them
[1:39:10] with the
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:16] genuine give them something which
[1:39:18] doesn't belong to them
[1:39:23] praise the Lord so we cause their
[1:39:26] spiritual
[1:39:28] brains to
[1:39:31] rot the
[1:39:33] decisions are
[1:39:36] wrong they are so you know until they
[1:39:41] are scared of the
[1:39:45] Brotherhood
[1:39:49] Brotherhood they can't go to that church
[1:39:52] they only go to this one
[1:39:54] is the dieting that they
[1:39:57] have which causes
[1:40:00] that there is something which you call
[1:40:02] social anxiety
[1:40:06] disorder we call it social anxiety
[1:40:12] disorder a mental
[1:40:16] condition which makes somebody avoid the
[1:40:19] public
[1:40:23] I want you to be a
[1:40:26] brother and a sister to one
[1:40:30] another I want you to
[1:40:32] know that tension is
[1:40:36] normal and
[1:40:41] necessary and even as I
[1:40:43] speak a number of you are going through
[1:40:47] tensions as you navigate on what you are
[1:40:51] hearing amen amen but that's very
[1:40:54] normal amen now God will subject his
[1:41:01] church to constructive
[1:41:05] tensions until all the false
[1:41:13] bases which the people build
[1:41:16] on will
[1:41:18] crumble amen so God will not stand by
[1:41:24] and just watch his
[1:41:27] children he allow
[1:41:29] them amen to be
[1:41:34] tested he subject
[1:41:36] them to positive uh
[1:41:41] tensions and now when the positive
[1:41:43] tensions
[1:41:46] come it will cause the people to
[1:41:49] think it will cause the people to go to
[1:41:52] the way
[1:41:54] it will cause them to go to the
[1:41:56] message they are going to pick out and
[1:42:00] find the balance level Genesis
[1:42:03] Revelation and they said this is where
[1:42:06] I'm going to put my
[1:42:10] anchor my anchor must hold within the
[1:42:14] veil you are going to be able to
[1:42:19] negotiate in the close of the world
[1:42:24] amen God will not stand by doctrinal
[1:42:30] interpretations he only want to stand by
[1:42:33] what he
[1:42:37] means you know
[1:42:41] while you Remember The Words which they
[1:42:43] bound Daniel
[1:42:46] by they told the king we want you to
[1:42:49] make a decision here
[1:42:53] by the law of the
[1:42:58] M which doesn't change and the King
[1:43:03] signed and after he signed then he says
[1:43:07] now the people who don't worship the
[1:43:10] God let them be fed to
[1:43:14] animals and the King only
[1:43:17] realize the wise man
[1:43:19] Daniel was going into the land's dead
[1:43:24] and he signed by the love the M which
[1:43:26] doesn't
[1:43:30] change he was thrown into the land's
[1:43:33] day the king didn't sleep the whole
[1:43:36] night then he came to the lands then in
[1:43:39] the
[1:43:41] morning Daniel are you there he said
[1:43:45] yeah oh your God kept
[1:43:48] you amen yeah so there is that love that
[1:43:55] which doesn't change and some people
[1:43:58] apply
[1:43:59] that and bring it to the work and they
[1:44:03] start saying God can only work this way
[1:44:07] he cannot only work that
[1:44:10] way always crosses his
[1:44:13] borders are you together with
[1:44:15] me so he'll give the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:19] Ghost Bas on acts 23
[1:44:24] amen do you hear that immediately they
[1:44:29] believe they were baptized they received
[1:44:32] the Holy Ghost but then the messenger
[1:44:36] teaches amen that there is
[1:44:39] justification
[1:44:41] sanctification of the Holy
[1:44:44] Ghost so now say how can you say when
[1:44:48] you believed you got the Holy
[1:44:50] Ghost Cornelius got it
[1:44:56] so we serve a God who cres his
[1:45:01] borders that does not mean justification
[1:45:05] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:45:08] Ghost does not mean that
[1:45:11] God cannot baptize with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:15] according to acts
[1:45:21] 23 those things to you
[1:45:25] isn't
[1:45:27] tension what you hear what you study can
[1:45:33] bring
[1:45:34] tension and positive
[1:45:37] tension God will put up this

[1:46:12] easy for the congregation of people to
[1:46:16] do when something just don't seem to
