[23:24] I want to encourage every one of us
[23:29] I don't know if all of us if you have a
[23:34] smartphone and then you on
[23:37] WhatsApp we have a church
[23:45] group and would wish if you're not part
[23:48] of it to really be part of
[23:52] it if you're not part of it at least you
[23:54] can get in touch with me and then see
[23:56] that you are part of it
[24:01] because we have daily
[24:05] devotions every morning and every
[24:09] evening and Pastor has been taking that
[24:12] for a period of
[24:15] time and I want to encourage each and
[24:18] every one of
[24:20] us take your
[24:22] time sit
[24:24] down and
[24:26] listen praise the name of
[24:29] be like somebody who in the service be
[24:32] like somebody who in the
[24:34] service whereby you know you sit down
[24:37] and
[24:39] listen not let me be doing this while
[24:41] I'm
[24:43] listening just take your time the way
[24:45] you reading your
[24:47] Bible when you reading your Bible you're
[24:51] not going to put on a
[24:56] radio you're not paying attention
[25:00] so you take your
[25:01] time put on your
[25:03] phone you download that devotion of the
[25:07] morning or the
[25:10] [Music]
[25:12] evening and then you listen to it and
[25:15] where possible go to the scriptures and
[25:19] read and meditate upon the
[25:22] things we are living in challenging
[25:26] times and we need more of God strength
[25:29] in
[25:31] us to help us overcome the time we
[25:35] living I would encourage every one of us
[25:39] to be doing that now that you have
[25:41] started on the Book of

[39:06] Lord amen on Christ the Dr We Stand
[39:11] praise the name of our
[39:12] Lord
[39:14] amen we appreciate that their
[39:18] dedication
[39:21] Amen Let Us stand up for a scripture
[39:26] reading we are going to the book of
[39:28] Ephesians chapter
[39:34] 19 up to verse
[39:38] 22 Ephesians 2 verse 19 up to verse
[39:47] 22 the Bible
[39:49] says now there you are no more strangers
[39:54] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[39:57] the Saints and of the household of
[40:11] God and built upon the foundation of the
[40:15] Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ
[40:18] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[40:32] in whom all the building F FR together
[40:36] growth unto a holy Temple in the
[40:50] Lord also are build together for ANH
[40:54] habitation of God through the spirit
[41:05] us pray father we thank you
[41:08] again and we give praise for the
[41:10] scriptures that we have
[41:13] read we pray that the Holy
[41:16] Spirit may come Lord Jesus Christ and
[41:20] give more light on these
[41:23] scriptures that we may have an
[41:25] understanding
[41:27] and build our faith
[41:29] Lord and be established in your Lord we
[41:33] pray you may bless us all
[41:35] together and help us to grow in you
[41:39] Lord that we may strive the St of a
[41:45] perfect in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:47] Christ pray and ask
[41:49] this amen you may be
[41:53] seated so I want to preach on the
[41:55] subject building on the set
[42:03] Foundation Building on the set
[42:09] Foundation praise the name of the Lord
[42:12] now the Bible is telling
[42:14] us in verse
[42:17] 20 that we are built upon the
[42:22] foundation of the
[42:25] Apostles and the prophets
[42:28] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[42:33] Cornerstone so we see that the
[42:36] apostles the New
[42:38] Testament and then the prophets the Old
[42:42] Testament and then the Bible is telling
[42:45] us that we are built on this
[42:49] foundation and now this
[42:52] Foundation is the word of
[42:55] God praise the name of our Lord
[42:58] so there is no other
[43:00] Foundation that we can be built
[43:03] on and then be
[43:06] certain that we are safe praise the name
[43:09] of our Lord now when we go to the
[43:12] scriptures
[43:14] here we go to the book of First
[43:16] Corinthians chapter
[43:21] 3 First Corinthians chapter 3
[43:27] and then we read from verse
[43:30] 10 he says according to the grace of God
[43:35] which is given unto me as a wise master
[43:38] builder I have laid the foundation and
[43:42] another build on but let every man take
[43:46] he how he build there upon
[44:05] so here Paul is saying that I'm the wise
[44:08] master
[44:12] builder so we see that in the the New
[44:17] Testament most of the letters in the New
[44:22] Testament we are written by
[44:25] Paul and it's not that
[44:28] Paul did it by
[44:31] himself but it was the spirit of
[44:34] God that was upon
[44:37] Paul that inspired him to write these
[44:43] letters praise the name of our Lord you
[44:45] see that most of the Epistles
[44:49] here which are actually in the New
[44:53] Testament where written by Paul when for
[44:57] example you read from the
[45:00] Romans First
[45:02] Corinthians second
[45:03] Corinthians
[45:05] Gans
[45:07] Ephesians Philippians
[45:10] phans
[45:13] Thessalonians second
[45:15] Thessalonians First
[45:17] Timothy second
[45:19] Timothy
[45:21] Titus
[45:23] filimon and
[45:24] Hebrews were all written by
[45:28] praise the name of our Lord he wrote
[45:31] more than
[45:35] 50% praise the name of our Lord of all
[45:38] the letters in the New
[45:42] Testament when you read the book of
[45:44] Matthew Matthew wrote about the life of
[45:47] Jesus
[45:49] Christ Mark wrote about the life of
[45:51] Jesus
[45:52] Christ L wrote about the life of Jesus
[45:55] Christ
[45:57] the same thing with
[45:58] John then Luke also writes the book of
[46:03] Acts based on what he
[46:06] had and what he saw praise the name of
[46:09] our Lord and then you see that
[46:12] Luke was following the ministry of
[46:16] Paul and then you will see you'll take
[46:19] interest that from about acts
[46:24] 13 it talks more about the ministry of
[46:29] Paul End praise the name of our Lord so
[46:33] you see Paul says I'm the wise master
[46:37] builder he wrote the New
[46:40] Testament by the revelation of
[46:44] God God gave him the
[46:46] grace to write praise the name of our
[46:50] Lord then he says I'm the wise master
[46:54] builder he was setting the found
[46:58] praise the name of Lord was setting the
[47:02] foundation on which the building of God
[47:05] is
[47:06] built on which the Church of God is
[47:10] built praise the name of the Lord
[47:12] preached about everything that concerns
[47:15] our Christian
[47:19] faith praise the name of our Lord he
[47:22] preached about
[47:24] everything and so Paul
[47:27] praise the name of our Lord gives the
[47:30] standard he gives the
[47:33] standard praise the name of our Lord and
[47:36] you know even when brother Bram was
[47:38] getting you know finding out the The
[47:41] Messengers to the church
[47:47] agent he was using
[47:50] Paul now in the Ephesian Church
[47:53] AG page 68
[47:59] he
[48:05] says when I said that God and his ways
[48:08] never
[48:13] change I did not say that the church and
[48:16] its Messengers could not
[48:20] change the church isn't
[48:23] God so she can change
[48:28] but what has
[48:29] said was that because of the unchanging
[48:34] God with unchanging
[48:37] ways we can go back to the
[48:40] beginning and see the first and perfect
[48:44] ACT of
[48:46] God and then judge by that
[48:50] standard that's how it is
[48:53] done the true church will always try to
[48:57] be like the original at
[49:01] Pentecost the true church of
[49:04] today we try to
[49:08] approximate the early first
[49:12] church and The
[49:14] Messengers to the
[49:16] churches having the same spirit of
[49:20] God in them will try to approximate
[49:26] Apostle
[49:28] Paul they won't be exactly like
[49:31] him but the true
[49:34] Messengers will be the ones that comes
[49:37] that comes the closest to
[49:41] Paul who was free from all
[49:47] men sold out to
[49:50] God and gave the word of God
[49:54] only and manifested the Holy Ghost in
[49:59] power none else would do
[50:02] that you have to work from the
[50:06] original as like be
[50:11] like the true church will always be the
[50:14] one that tries to follow in the steps of
[50:16] her
[50:23] Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers
[50:27] will follow the Apostle
[50:30] Paul the first
[50:32] Messenger to the first church
[50:35] age is that simple and
[50:39] wonderful praise the name of the Lord so
[50:42] now God has given us a
[50:45] standard and the standard is in his word
[50:49] you know what we need to
[50:51] follow praise the name of our Lord and
[50:54] then we have been called to be the Bride
[50:57] of Jesus Christ but even at the
[51:00] beginning there was a bride in the book
[51:03] of
[51:04] Acts each and every one of us we need to
[51:08] be
[51:09] Desiring to be like that bride at the
[51:12] beginning to be like that church at the
[51:16] beginning to be like those Believers at
[51:18] the
[51:19] beginning should always be our desire
[51:23] every because it is the same spirit of
[51:26] God
[51:27] and if it is the same
[51:29] word The Same Spirit then it has also to
[51:33] make us to be the
[51:35] same praise the name of our Lord and
[51:38] that should always be our
[51:40] desire you know you read in the Bible
[51:43] and then you get
[51:45] examples that can really challenge you
[51:48] and so then you work out to those
[51:52] examples praise the name of our Lord you
[51:55] know the Bible says we have a great
[51:57] cloud of
[52:00] witnesses in Hebrews 11 you know
[52:04] whatever we are going through there are
[52:06] people who went through
[52:08] what but then we need to ask ourselves
[52:12] when they were going through what I'm
[52:13] going
[52:14] through how would they handle
[52:18] the how would they handle the challenges
[52:21] that I was
[52:24] facing praise the name of our Lord so we
[52:26] have an example that has already been
[52:28] given to
[52:30] us praise the name of the Lord so now
[52:33] Paul says I am the master
[52:38] builder so he said I have laid the
[52:43] foundation praise the name of our and
[52:46] then now when he continues continues to
[52:49] say let every man take how he build on
[52:53] that found
[52:57] for no other
[53:01] Foundation 1 Corinthians 3:
[53:08] 11 for no for other Foundation can no
[53:11] man L than that is laid which is Jesus
[53:21] Christ praise the name of Lord no other
[53:25] man
[53:27] you can't lay another
[53:29] foundation and then it is acceptable of
[53:32] God and then it says that
[53:35] Foundation which he has laid is the Lord
[53:39] Jesus
[53:40] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
[53:43] now us
[53:45] also we are built on that same
[53:50] Foundation we become part of this
[53:54] building and now each and every every
[53:56] one of
[53:57] us praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[54:01] says in First Peter chapter
[54:04] 2 and then verse verse
[54:08] five praise the name of our
[54:11] Lord the Bible says ye also as Lively
[54:16] stones are built up a spiritual house
[54:20] and holy priesthood to offer up
[54:23] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[54:26] by Jes Jesus
[54:47] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
[54:50] the Bible is telling us we are Lively
[54:53] stones
[54:56] and if we are Lively
[54:58] Stones then there is
[55:01] gross praise the name of our Lord you're
[55:04] not going to be the
[55:06] same but there has to be a change
[55:09] working out in your
[55:12] life for you to
[55:15] conform for you to be
[55:17] transformed to the image of Jesus
[55:21] Christ we are a Lively Stone in other
[55:24] words there is the spirit of God in
[55:27] us and the spirit of God keeps on
[55:31] Guiding us keeps on instructing
[55:35] Us Praise the name of the Lord you know
[55:38] just like this
[55:39] building the foundation was
[55:43] set but then to bring the building the
[55:46] way it
[55:47] is bricks had to be put one on top of
[55:53] another and you know it's not just
[55:55] merely putting one on top of the
[55:58] other there had to be skilled
[56:04] people to do that
[56:07] together and they were not just merely
[56:09] putting bricks
[56:11] together but a particular direction had
[56:15] to be
[56:17] done praise the name of our Lord now
[56:20] when they were building the Temple of
[56:23] Solomon they were getting stones from
[56:26] different
[56:28] areas praise the name of our Lord and
[56:31] now in the message conference with
[56:33] God when Solomon's Temple was cut out
[56:36] across the
[56:38] world the stones were cut out across the
[56:45] world it was cut all over the
[56:49] world different fun looking Stones than
[56:53] everything else
[56:57] but when they begin to come
[57:00] together there wasn't a buz or a sound
[57:03] of a
[57:08] hmer 40 years in erecting of the
[57:13] temple they never had one hmer beit or
[57:19] a they were all cut out just right
[57:26] these great
[57:28] churches that has got the Holy
[57:32] Ghost will move right together in
[57:36] there fed
[57:39] places that day in the body of
[57:43] Christ for the rupture praise the name
[57:46] of our Lord you know this is a very good
[57:49] example that when they were building the
[57:51] Temple of
[57:53] Solomon
[57:55] builders went out in different
[57:59] countries different
[58:01] rocks and then they were cutting rocks
[58:04] from those
[58:06] places and The Rock would be so
[58:09] big and then they would transport them
[58:12] to
[58:13] Jerusalem and now when they brought
[58:15] these rocks from different
[58:18] places they never shaped any Rock when
[58:20] it reached at the temple
[58:24] site but they had to make sure that they
[58:27] get these
[58:29] stones that they join each other
[58:34] properly praise the name of our that's
[58:37] how was being
[58:38] built because God said that there should
[58:40] be no hmer at the
[58:43] temple so they got stones from different
[58:46] areas and then they brought them to the
[58:49] temple and then the
[58:51] builders had to be
[58:54] inspired started joining Stone to
[58:58] Stone and even that's how God also saves
[59:03] Us Praise the name of our Lord we come
[59:06] from different
[59:08] backgrounds we come from different
[59:12] tries we come from different family
[59:16] backgrounds we come from different you
[59:18] know education and so
[59:22] on praise the name of the Lord some
[59:25] people are raised in a particular
[59:28] way until now what this one calls good
[59:31] other calls it
[59:33] bad but that
[59:35] scure education
[59:37] background how this one dresses like
[59:40] this says I can't do like
[59:43] that praise the name of our different
[59:47] backgrounds like now praise the name of
[59:50] you know you can put on your cloth you
[59:54] like and maybe your put on a green
[1:00:00] Shir and then you put on a red one red
[1:00:03] down
[1:00:07] here and then you put on White
[1:00:10] Shoes somebody says
[1:00:15] color but that's his
[1:00:19] teste and then you put on a black tie
[1:00:23] here or you put on a strapped coat
[1:00:28] here or with flowers somebody says I
[1:00:31] don't like that but that's cut is cut
[1:00:35] from that
[1:00:37] side praise the
[1:00:39] name then another must put on the same
[1:00:43] colors
[1:00:46] throughout the shoes the heart Bel the
[1:00:51] sh or the browse or the bag
[1:00:57] totally
[1:00:59] different so we are got from different
[1:01:04] backgrounds we have got from different
[1:01:06] family
[1:01:08] background we are got from different
[1:01:12] exposures but then God brings us
[1:01:16] together to make the building of
[1:01:19] God praise the name of our Lord and even
[1:01:22] that's what it is as a
[1:01:24] church we come from different
[1:01:27] areas we have been raised
[1:01:30] differently we have different kind of
[1:01:34] opportunities we have different kind of
[1:01:37] work we have different kind of financial
[1:01:40] status or
[1:01:42] abilities one may be Desiring and
[1:01:45] praising his small
[1:01:48] heart and very Happ about it now when
[1:01:52] the other comes to the
[1:01:53] heart what is this
[1:01:56] but the other is so grateful about
[1:01:59] it but at the end of the day we are all
[1:02:02] children of
[1:02:03] God praise the name of that's why the
[1:02:06] Bible says when he invited the
[1:02:10] guest there was somebody at the
[1:02:13] entrance to put a robe on every one of
[1:02:16] them praise the name of our so when we
[1:02:19] come here we make sure we get the same
[1:02:22] Rob of the Holy Spirit
[1:02:26] praise the name of our Lord so then
[1:02:28] there will be no
[1:02:30] difference whether I'm educated or I'm
[1:02:33] not
[1:02:34] educated whether I'm a student whether
[1:02:37] I'm a university
[1:02:39] Professor whether I'm
[1:02:43] unemploy employe we are all children of
[1:02:48] God the name of you've been cut from
[1:02:51] different
[1:02:53] places but now when we come to the
[1:02:55] temple
[1:02:57] praise the name we need to find our
[1:03:00] positions in the
[1:03:03] building and that's what we need to know
[1:03:06] because it's a building that is
[1:03:09] being have you found your position in
[1:03:12] the
[1:03:13] building have you got your
[1:03:16] position on the whole
[1:03:18] building you
[1:03:20] identify yourself as part of the body of
[1:03:23] Jesus Christ
[1:03:26] that should give us
[1:03:27] joy praise the name of the Lord that I'm
[1:03:30] part of the
[1:03:31] building it doesn't matter my
[1:03:35] backround have I received of The Same
[1:03:38] Spirit have I believed the same
[1:03:42] word praise the name of our Lord that
[1:03:44] should be something that gives us
[1:03:47] joy praise the name of our Lord because
[1:03:50] all the other
[1:03:51] things are temporary
[1:03:54] things praise the name
[1:03:56] all the others are
[1:03:59] temporary but then we need to make
[1:04:02] sure that we are part of the building of
[1:04:06] God we need to make sure that we are the
[1:04:09] habitation of the holy
[1:04:11] spirit that the holy spirit is pleased
[1:04:15] to dwell within me the holy spirit is
[1:04:19] pleased to abide within
[1:04:21] you praise the name of our Lord so Paul
[1:04:24] as the master builder
[1:04:27] he set up the
[1:04:28] foundation and then he didn't set up
[1:04:31] this
[1:04:32] Foundation based on his
[1:04:35] education in galanter
[1:04:38] 1 and then verse
[1:04:40] 11 he says but I stify you Brethren that
[1:04:45] the gospel which was preached of me is
[1:04:48] not after man
[1:04:59] for I nether received it of man neither
[1:05:02] was I taught it but by the revelation of
[1:05:06] Jesus
[1:05:14] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
[1:05:17] Paul says the gospel that I
[1:05:20] preach the gospel that I
[1:05:23] believe it was by the re of Jesus
[1:05:27] Christ I never went to school to get
[1:05:31] it but it was the Christ
[1:05:34] himself who revealed himself to me and
[1:05:38] that is also the same thing with us that
[1:05:41] each and every one of us must get a
[1:05:44] personal
[1:05:46] revelation of who Jesus Christ is each
[1:05:49] and every one of us otherwise you can't
[1:05:52] be part of the building
[1:05:55] if you don't know who Christ is because
[1:05:59] at the end of the day we are making the
[1:06:02] body of Jesus Christ we are making the
[1:06:05] habitation of God so we need to get a
[1:06:08] personal
[1:06:11] revelation Christ himself revealing to
[1:06:15] you praise the name of the Lord and then
[1:06:18] you can know I know where I
[1:06:22] stand I know my position in the body of
[1:06:25] Jesus Christ
[1:06:26] I know why the Lord has called
[1:06:29] me praise the name of our Lord let us go
[1:06:32] to marthew chapter
[1:06:35] 16 and then verse
[1:06:39] 13 praise the name of the Lord the Bible
[1:06:43] says when Jesus came into the courts of
[1:06:46] CIA Philip he asked his disciples saying
[1:06:49] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[1:07:05] praise the name of the Lord you know it
[1:07:07] is easy to talk what about about what
[1:07:10] others talk about
[1:07:15] something oh how they call
[1:07:18] that it is EAS for you to
[1:07:21] talk because you've
[1:07:23] heard but your
[1:07:27] what do you talk about
[1:07:28] it praise the name of the Lord why do
[1:07:31] you go to that
[1:07:33] church that church is near
[1:07:36] my praise the name of that church I can
[1:07:41] sit that
[1:07:43] church when it is they put on the
[1:07:48] F and that brings you to the church
[1:07:51] church if I'm tired of sitting on the
[1:07:53] chair
[1:07:55] sit down because they have
[1:07:57] tites you know different
[1:08:00] reasons why do you go to that church
[1:08:03] there's enough
[1:08:07] paring if I'm tired I can go and sit on
[1:08:10] the
[1:08:12] veras why do you go to that church you
[1:08:15] know you can have those kind of
[1:08:18] things but then the thing is who do you
[1:08:22] call
[1:08:24] Christ praise the name of our Lord who
[1:08:27] do you call Christ what is Christ to you
[1:08:31] so now they told Jesus that some call
[1:08:34] you
[1:08:36] Jeremiah some call you
[1:08:38] Elijah some call you John the
[1:08:41] Baptist one of those prophets and then
[1:08:45] Jesus asked them what about
[1:08:48] you how do you call
[1:08:51] me and you see that's where the starting
[1:08:55] point
[1:08:58] praise the name of who do you call
[1:09:03] me like you know we have
[1:09:05] children who have been raised up in
[1:09:08] believing
[1:09:10] families why do you go to that church
[1:09:13] because my mother goes there my father
[1:09:16] goes there my friend goes
[1:09:19] there that's not reason
[1:09:21] enough you must know the real thing
[1:09:26] why you are part of the
[1:09:28] church praise the name of the Lord why
[1:09:32] so it has to come a personal
[1:09:37] revelation praise the name of our Lord I
[1:09:39] go to that church because they preach
[1:09:42] the message of
[1:09:44] the I go to that church praise the name
[1:09:48] of our because they preach about the
[1:09:50] Lord Jesus
[1:09:51] Christ I go to that church because the
[1:09:54] emphasize the life of Jesus Christ in
[1:09:56] our
[1:09:58] Liv you must have a
[1:10:00] reason praise the name of the Lord so
[1:10:03] now Jesus asked them but who do you say
[1:10:07] that I
[1:10:08] am and then in verse 16 and Simon Peter
[1:10:12] answered and
[1:10:14] say the
[1:10:16] Christ the son of the Living
[1:10:20] God praise the name of our Lord he had
[1:10:23] to get a personal re
[1:10:28] and we also need to get a personal
[1:10:32] revelation when you get a personal
[1:10:35] revelation of who Christ
[1:10:38] is the Bible says the gates of
[1:10:42] hell can never Prevail
[1:10:45] against praise the name of our Lord so
[1:10:48] Jesus say Jesus answered and said unto
[1:10:52] him blessed at those Simon by John
[1:10:57] for flesh and blood has not revealed it
[1:10:59] to
[1:11:03] you but my Father which is in
[1:11:06] heaven and I say unto you that th at
[1:11:11] Peter and Upon This
[1:11:14] Rock I will build my church and the
[1:11:18] Gates of
[1:11:19] Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:11:23] it so the the The Rock he was talking
[1:11:27] about was the rock of
[1:11:30] Revelation and it's upon the rock of
[1:11:34] Revelation that we are built
[1:11:36] upon praise the name of the Lord so you
[1:11:40] yourself if you are going to be part of
[1:11:42] the building of
[1:11:44] God if you going to be the body of Jesus
[1:11:48] Christ to get a personal
[1:11:51] revelation who Christ is to
[1:11:55] as an
[1:11:57] individual praise the name of our Lord
[1:11:59] and then the Bible says the Gates of
[1:12:03] Hell shall not Prevail against it and
[1:12:07] then brother Bram says they will fight
[1:12:10] it they will be against
[1:12:13] it but they will not Prevail
[1:12:16] against why it is a sure
[1:12:20] Foundation you are really anchored into
[1:12:24] Ita the name of our when Jesus started
[1:12:27] preaching in John chapter
[1:12:29] 6 and said unless you eat of My
[1:12:32] Flesh unless you drink of my
[1:12:35] blood many of his
[1:12:38] ministers were
[1:12:40] offended and they went away let us go to
[1:12:44] joh
[1:12:46] 6 praise the name of our Lord John
[1:12:49] chapter 6
[1:12:57] let us read from verse
[1:13:02] 53 can start from verse
[1:13:06] 15 I am the living bread which came down
[1:13:09] from heaven If any man eat of this bread
[1:13:12] he shall live forever and the bread that
[1:13:15] I give is my flesh which I'll give for
[1:13:19] the life of the world
[1:13:41] the Jews therefore strove among
[1:13:44] themselves saying how can this man give
[1:13:48] us his flesh to eat
[1:14:00] then Jesus said unto them very very I
[1:14:04] say unto you except you eat the Flesh of
[1:14:07] the son of man and drink his blood you
[1:14:10] have
[1:14:23] no teaching
[1:14:26] praise the name of our Lord and
[1:14:28] sometimes even we go through such STS in
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:32] Life along the
[1:14:34] path Trials Come testing
[1:14:38] comes praise the name of the Lord the
[1:14:41] teaching can be hard for
[1:14:43] you and then the Bible says in verse
[1:14:48] 16 many therefore of his
[1:14:53] disciples when they heard
[1:14:56] this say this is a hard
[1:15:01] saying who can hear
[1:15:05] it when Jesus knew himself that his
[1:15:09] disciples M that
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] te he said unto them does this offend
[1:15:21] you praise the name of the Lord but you
[1:15:24] know
[1:15:26] those who never had a personal
[1:15:30] revelation they went
[1:15:35] back because some people attract the
[1:15:38] ministry of Jesus
[1:15:40] Christ by the food he was
[1:15:42] making by The Miracles he was making by
[1:15:46] the healing was
[1:15:47] doing by the benefits around his
[1:15:51] ministry and then we see there also some
[1:15:53] people who come to church because of
[1:15:57] that but those are temporary
[1:16:00] things praise the name of the Lord you
[1:16:02] should look at something beyond
[1:16:05] that praise the name of the Lord it is
[1:16:08] the word of God that should be the
[1:16:11] attraction before
[1:16:13] us praise the name of our Lord attracted
[1:16:16] by the word of God and then you say what
[1:16:19] I desire
[1:16:20] most is the word of eternal life
[1:16:25] preached to my soul it doesn't matter
[1:16:28] what I'm going through it doesn't matter
[1:16:30] the circumstances I'm going but what I
[1:16:33] desire is God to speak to my soul praise
[1:16:38] the name of our Lord then the Bible
[1:16:41] says in verse
[1:16:43] 66 from that time many of his disciples
[1:16:47] went back and wed no more with him
[1:16:59] then said Jesus unto the
[1:17:03] 12 will you also go
[1:17:08] away then Simon Peter answered
[1:17:11] him Lord to whom shall we
[1:17:15] go you have the words of eternal
[1:17:20] life and we
[1:17:23] believe sure that th the
[1:17:30] Christ the son of the Living
[1:17:34] God now you see the basis of Peter
[1:17:39] stay was the
[1:17:42] Revelation that he got in MTH
[1:17:46] 16 that you are the
[1:17:48] Christ the son of the living so we need
[1:17:52] also to ask ourselves
[1:17:55] also got that
[1:17:57] Revelation because if you don't have
[1:18:00] that
[1:18:01] Revelation along the way you'll find
[1:18:04] yourself going
[1:18:07] away because you're not seeing any F
[1:18:11] interest but when you know that it is
[1:18:13] the word of
[1:18:15] life you know that it is
[1:18:17] Christ feeding from
[1:18:20] Christ I'm receiving the word of eternal
[1:18:23] life will keep there regardless of what
[1:18:27] you're going through regardless of the
[1:18:30] circumstances that you're going
[1:18:32] through praise the name of our and it's
[1:18:35] only the word of
[1:18:36] God that can keep us in his
[1:18:39] presence not
[1:18:41] Miracles praise the name of our Lord not
[1:18:44] big
[1:18:46] programs you know this project has
[1:18:49] come let us try to keep the youth doing
[1:18:53] this this project has come let us try to
[1:18:57] keep the professionals doing
[1:18:58] this you know in those
[1:19:01] denominations they have many of those
[1:19:04] things they see somebody who has come to
[1:19:06] their
[1:19:07] church and they say what what work does
[1:19:09] he do an accountant you be the
[1:19:14] treasur what work does he do an engineer
[1:19:17] you handle the construction Pro what
[1:19:20] does he do a health worker hand first
[1:19:23] eight what work does he do is a teacher
[1:19:27] do Sunday school what work does he do is
[1:19:30] a
[1:19:31] counselor let him beheading the
[1:19:34] counseling of
[1:19:37] people they try to who
[1:19:40] people by different small small
[1:19:44] attachments until they keep them busy
[1:19:47] the whole
[1:19:49] day says you have work to do at
[1:19:52] church are very early
[1:19:55] this is the
[1:19:57] progam if those things
[1:19:59] stop they also
[1:20:02] stop because they have no
[1:20:06] attachment but then what should attract
[1:20:08] us is the word of eternal
[1:20:12] life praise the name of our you know
[1:20:15] there is a story in Luke chapter
[1:20:18] 16 when the rich man died and he went to
[1:20:22] hell praise the name of our you know
[1:20:25] some say that in Hell there is no
[1:20:28] fire but the Bible States when this man
[1:20:31] reached in
[1:20:32] hell he was under
[1:20:35] torment fire was too
[1:20:38] much you know one should not first go
[1:20:40] there to prove that there is
[1:20:43] fire praise the name of you just know
[1:20:46] there is and I don't want to go there
[1:20:50] praise the name of our Lord so now this
[1:20:52] man looked at Lazarus
[1:20:55] and Lazarus was living by his
[1:20:58] house and then he said Father
[1:21:01] Abraham s Lazarus to my
[1:21:04] house I have five
[1:21:07] brothers let him go and tell to them let
[1:21:11] him testify to them let him preach to
[1:21:15] them that they don't come in this
[1:21:20] place because he saw where he was was
[1:21:22] very dangerous
[1:21:25] and then he remember these five
[1:21:27] brothers and he didn't want them to come
[1:21:30] to the same place he was in in
[1:21:33] heav and then Abraham told
[1:21:35] him they have
[1:21:38] Moses and the
[1:21:41] prophets in other words it was at the
[1:21:44] time of the law and the
[1:21:48] prophets the Lord Jesus Christ had not
[1:21:52] died and resurrected yet
[1:21:55] so now they were being held down in
[1:21:58] Paradise
[1:22:00] Paradise before the res of Jesus
[1:22:04] Christ was neighboring
[1:22:07] hell praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:22:09] people in
[1:22:10] hell would see the people in
[1:22:14] paradise and then they would talk but
[1:22:17] nobody would cross to the
[1:22:19] Earth because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:22] had not yet been shed
[1:22:25] praise the name of our Lord but now when
[1:22:27] the blood of Jesus was
[1:22:30] shed all those who were in
[1:22:33] Paradise resurrected with Jesus Christ
[1:22:36] on the resurrection
[1:22:38] morning praise the name of our Lord so
[1:22:40] now the man was saying let Lazarus go
[1:22:45] they know he died so if he
[1:22:48] res they will believe him now you can
[1:22:52] imagine how big a miracle resurrecting
[1:23:01] is dead for many
[1:23:04] years but he resurrected is the very one
[1:23:07] he has
[1:23:10] come come and preach theel and will
[1:23:12] believe Abraham said no if they can't
[1:23:15] hear
[1:23:17] Moses there no Miracle they can
[1:23:20] believe same thing now if we can't take
[1:23:23] the word of got to be
[1:23:25] serious it doesn't matter what project
[1:23:28] is
[1:23:30] brought praise the name of the Lord it
[1:23:32] doesn't matter what Miracle
[1:23:35] happens it doesn't matter what happens
[1:23:38] as long as the word has been
[1:23:41] rejected as long as the one that's been
[1:23:44] despised nothing else will be
[1:23:47] received praise the name of the Lord so
[1:23:50] we need to have a personal revelation
[1:23:54] Christ is and then it will hold your
[1:23:59] anchor the name of whether the storms
[1:24:04] come whether the Trials come it will
[1:24:07] hold you together Jesus told them will
[1:24:11] you also go
[1:24:13] away Peter said where can we
[1:24:16] go God was proving them the same thing
[1:24:20] with
[1:24:21] Elijah when Elijah called Elisha
[1:24:25] you know when you follow the
[1:24:27] scriptures and the
[1:24:29] history
[1:24:31] elishah followed
[1:24:33] Elijah for about 10
[1:24:36] years praise the name of Lord It's not
[1:24:38] that El elishah was anointed
[1:24:41] today the foll day started the work he
[1:24:45] kept on
[1:24:47] following and now when it was the time
[1:24:50] of Elijah being raptured
[1:24:55] elah tells Elisha why don't you stay
[1:24:58] here
[1:25:01] there Elish if El say okay now I've got
[1:25:05] opportunity to go from
[1:25:08] there that was not elah he knew what he
[1:25:13] had
[1:25:14] believed he knew what was
[1:25:17] following so Elish say as long as you
[1:25:21] are still alive
[1:25:24] and I can see you and God is still alive
[1:25:29] I'm not going to leave you why he knew
[1:25:32] his
[1:25:33] calling he knew his his basis of the
[1:25:38] call and I should also be the same thing
[1:25:41] with us we know why we have been
[1:25:45] called because the message of the hour
[1:25:48] prepares us for the
[1:25:50] rupture now the question is has the
[1:25:53] Rapture taken place
[1:25:54] yes then stay
[1:25:57] on praise the name ofay
[1:26:01] following so Elish followed
[1:26:05] elij Elish made sure he
[1:26:09] Elijah he said now has
[1:26:12] G now I can call upon the name of the
[1:26:16] Lord praise the name of the Lord we must
[1:26:19] have a personal
[1:26:22] revelation now if we are going to be
[1:26:24] built on the
[1:26:26] foundation we need to have a personal
[1:26:30] revelation of who Christ
[1:26:33] is God Is To Us Praise the name of the
[1:26:38] Lord in the message making a
[1:26:41] way he
[1:26:45] says no other Foundation is
[1:26:50] late but that which has already been
[1:26:53] late
[1:26:56] then he says no one to build upon any
[1:27:00] other
[1:27:03] Foundation like St and
[1:27:08] mud will wash it
[1:27:12] away and will the great will be the
[1:27:17] for Jesus said upon this Ro I will build
[1:27:22] my church
[1:27:24] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:27:27] against what is it he built it
[1:27:31] upon on the spiritual revealed
[1:27:36] truth that he is the Son of
[1:27:41] God who does that say I the son of
[1:27:48] man praise the name of the Lord so now
[1:27:51] you see that it is built on the spirit
[1:27:54] revealed
[1:27:58] truth even us now to be part of the
[1:28:02] building we need to get that personal
[1:28:07] revelation Christ is it doesn't matter
[1:28:11] what you are going through
[1:28:13] life but once you have the
[1:28:16] revelation of who Christ is praise the
[1:28:20] name of our Lord it will give you the
[1:28:23] ability Prevail against all the Wes of
[1:28:27] Satan whatever storm the devil will
[1:28:30] bring whatever sttion the devil bring
[1:28:34] you stand
[1:28:36] firm because you are built on a
[1:28:39] foundation when you are built on the
[1:28:41] foundation you are also a Lively
[1:28:44] Stone you have the
[1:28:47] testimony that this building the
[1:28:50] material that make this
[1:28:52] Foundation I am of the same
[1:28:58] material praise the name of now in the
[1:29:01] message
[1:29:03] you he says time
[1:29:09] tested the
[1:29:12] Christian must be
[1:29:15] tested every son that comes to
[1:29:19] God must be first child trained
[1:29:28] tested when you are going to build a
[1:29:32] building you test the
[1:29:37] material that you put on
[1:29:39] it praise the name of our says you test
[1:29:42] the
[1:29:44] material then he says when the Great D
[1:29:47] was built around
[1:29:50] your for the
[1:29:51] flood they tested every
[1:29:54] of that that went into that
[1:29:59] Dam to see if it would stand the
[1:30:03] waters and God tests his
[1:30:07] children with
[1:30:09] trials and
[1:30:11] travs and
[1:30:12] tribulations to find out if they are
[1:30:16] truly his
[1:30:18] children praise the name of our Lord he
[1:30:21] says we are tested
[1:30:24] materials have to be
[1:30:28] tested we even see in our the normal of
[1:30:33] Life praise the name of the Lord you
[1:30:36] take a child to
[1:30:38] school but the child is not going to go
[1:30:40] to the next class without passing
[1:30:43] exams and before they can give the
[1:30:46] examinations they are trials they have
[1:30:49] to go
[1:30:50] through
[1:30:51] tests discussions
[1:30:55] exercises are
[1:30:57] preparing for the final
[1:31:00] exams the natural things we do the
[1:31:04] testing how about the spiritual
[1:31:06] things so even us as a
[1:31:10] material as a living
[1:31:13] Stone you go through
[1:31:15] trials you go through
[1:31:17] troubles you go through
[1:31:20] tribulation different on it may not be
[1:31:23] the same
[1:31:25] praise the name of our Lord one may go
[1:31:27] this way another may pass through
[1:31:29] another praise the name of our Lord some
[1:31:32] through the fire some through the
[1:31:35] FL some through
[1:31:37] storms but all through the
[1:31:40] blood praise the name of our Lord we are
[1:31:42] all
[1:31:44] tested praise the name of our Lord you
[1:31:46] know just like the Bible talks about the
[1:31:50] seed that fell on a rocket ground
[1:31:54] and then the Bible says that on the Rock
[1:31:58] ground when the sun started
[1:32:02] shining then the seed started
[1:32:06] drying because didn't have the depth of
[1:32:09] the
[1:32:11] roots praise the name of our Lord and
[1:32:14] then it ended there like that but then
[1:32:17] when you look at
[1:32:22] the there is no
[1:32:24] plants which can grow without the
[1:32:28] sun praise the name of the Lord all
[1:32:31] plants need the
[1:32:33] sun all plants need the
[1:32:36] Sun but then the question is while my
[1:32:40] plant is
[1:32:42] growing Under the Sun and while yours
[1:32:48] isy praise the name of the Lord we live
[1:32:50] in the same
[1:32:52] environment we go through the same same
[1:32:54] economic
[1:32:55] contion to go through the same
[1:32:58] pressures but why is it that for you
[1:33:02] fall and then I stand so the thing is
[1:33:06] the deepness of
[1:33:08] root what is the depth of your
[1:33:12] root praise the name of our where have
[1:33:15] you loun your
[1:33:17] root praise the name of our which side
[1:33:20] are the root tributaries going to
[1:33:26] maybe this one is going to
[1:33:29] Facebook so Facebook
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:42] all that is
[1:33:45] there then maybe this one is on
[1:33:50] programs SPS all the time

[1:33:56] watching those
[1:33:58] games they make me
