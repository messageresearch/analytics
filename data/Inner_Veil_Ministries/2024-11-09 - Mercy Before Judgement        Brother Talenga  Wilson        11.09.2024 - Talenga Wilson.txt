you all you're welcome to you're all welcome to the service this evening and we thank God for such a Grace that we are here amen I want to appreciate the pastor for another opportunity to speak to you the word of God and I want to appreciate the Pres of our Jam here with us tonight amen and Pastor was here shortly but he says not going to be a to be with us I think brother the army officer sits in front here I think his time has come to and he with the to see him before Hees unfortunately the only time he had was between 4 and so the to live and says will not be able to be with us but we thank God for him amen so without wasting a lot of time we shall count our Bibles in the Book of Genesis and read chapter 19 verse 12 amen amen and the scripture says and the man said unto Lord thou hear any besides sonin-law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou Hast in the city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this place because the Cry of them is works and great before the face of the Lord and the Lord has senty and when the morning arose and the angels HED lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city and while he lingered the man laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the Lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all thee escap the M Beed may the Lord bless the reading of his words take our seats amen so I want to welcome you to the to the to our stud tonight for I'll be teaching all preaching or talking about Mery before judgment praise the Lord so we know the Bible teaches us that each time God is going send out something either it's a punishment or it's a plague praise the Lord he normally first of all sends a messenger to wonder people of the oncoming plague praise the Lord so he first of all shows Mercy to the people and he gives them a way of Escape before the plague hits so now here the angel that God had sent lot the city was going to be bured the whole city was going to be burned praise the Lord was going to be judged praise the Lord and this judgment was going to be by fire but before it was burned there was a people that God had seen praise the Lord that the Angels first visited Abraham praise the Lord and then they left Abraham the other side and then the angel came to lot to warn lot of what was going to happen to the praise the Lord show him Mercy praise the Lord when the angel came to Lord the Bible say the asked Lord don't you have any other person besides don't you have a sonin-law or don't you have sons or don't you have daughters or whatsoever that you have in the city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this place because the Cry of them is works and great before God and he sent us to destroy it so we know that Sodom and gor were in a Sodom condition and the people had committed sin and it had annoyed God and so God was to bring judgment Upon This City because of its wickedness praise the Lord but before he did it here is the Angel of the Lord and the angel of the Lord bringing caution to lot his house because there was only lot praise the Lord that God was coming to look out for to rescue from the city praise the Lord and the angel asked him do you have any other besides you praise the Lord why because the mercies of God were there with Lord God had brought Mercy before them so he was looking for anyone that was righteous before him was in the city so when he looked at lot and his house he asked him there was mer pres and God was ready to redeem to save anyone that accepted the mercies of God so he asked don't you have anyone why because the angel of the Lord had seen what was going before the city praise the Lord you have seen the events that we are going to happen that the city was going to be burned the Bible says when the morning arose the angels H and lot because lot was lingering the Lord so they they HED saying arise take thy wife and your daughters which are here lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city and still Lord was lingering and was a call call for deliverance to deliver him out of the iniquity deliver him out of the city because it was going to be judged by fire of the Lord and says while he lingered the man laid hold upon his hand praise the Lord he was lingering and yet the purpose of God message that the Angels had carried the message was to deliver lot and his house out of the city before judgment struck and the Bible says got a hold of his hand and upon his wife and upon his two daughters and the Lord being merciful unto him they brought him forth and set him without the city and it came to pass where they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for your life that was the message to escape for his life because judgment was going to strike the land and that is our God he such a merciful god praise the lord we shall see in the Bible History each time is going to judge the land is going to judge the people first of all sends a message praise the Lord a message to wonder people to call them to attention to tell them of the oncoming judgment a message of Mery a message of Deliverance deliver them before the Striking of the Judgment praise the Lord he sent the message to Lord to redeem him out don't come out because the city is going to be burn praise the Lord he has always given himself to the people he always opens himself out the people send his word full ofcy full of grace full of love to rescue the people to redeem them from the oncoming judgment praise the Lord and he makes sure that when he sends this message when he send the word of the word must reach every part praise the Lord if God has desire to save Ginger from maybe an event that is coming to strike Ginger first of all sends a message to Ginger makes sure that everyone in ginger hears this message praise the Lord that when judgment hits there is no excuse praise the Lord so when he sent the message and the angels reached the household of of lot they looked around lot and asked lot don't you have any other person besides your daughters don't you have Sons or don't you have sons inw or other person why because the message had been sent to rescue lot from the Judgment that was coming to strike the city praise the Lord and God promised us in the Book of Joel 2 verse 28 it says and it shall come to pass that afterwards I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh praise the Lord says your sons and your daughters prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions praise the Lord I don't mean the prophets all the prophecies that we see everywhere but the prophecies that the Bible talks of here the Declaration of the word of God Declaration of Mercy Declaration of Deliverance and judgments that would strike the Earth praise the Lord the spirit of Prophecy in other words that would be poured upon the people is the Declaration of a message of Deliverance to deliver the people of the oncoming judgment it's a declaration of the message of Grace praise the Lord that by faith and divine intervention to whom the message is sent they be able to receive it and save themselves from the Judgment that would strike the and this message the Declaration of the would be to call out the people toy call out the people towards Grace to call out the people towards Deliverance to call out the people onto Christ praise the Lord before judgment there is always a mer call the Ang said askap for your life praise the Lord for life when he was speaking to him says Escape do not delay why because the angel had gone ahead of time the messenger that God has sent lot had gone ahead of time and was able to see the things that we are to be was able to see the fire and the judgments that they are coming upon the and Lord was lingering he had the voice he had the caution he was L the Bible says because he was the elect the angel that was going to cause judgment that was going to bring fire do nothing without he couldn't do anything without Lord so as Lord was lingering because L was the elect in the city the Bible says the angel brought a hold of his hand and began pulling him all through and took him out of the city praise the Lord God is very Just Praise the Lord if you sent out a message if you sent out message of Deliverance he makes sure that that message reaches out to the people who have been ordained to be theer praise the Lord regardless of of L laziness when he looked back and he saw his wealth praise the Lord he was a rich man and the prophet says he was the mayor of the city so he could sit in the gates and he could could watch over things that were coming in into the City and things that were going out of the city he was in charge of everything that was coming to the city so when he had the message praise the Lord and he was now delaying he was looking at his wealth how will I live my wealth there are things that we are touching him were those attachments that were stopping him when the message of caution came to us maybe he said I will change tomorrow iust tomorrow I'll do this tomorrow give me a little bit of time praise the Lord he was looking at his wealth he wanted to take a part of it with but when the angel looked at him and he saw that lot was lingering praise the Lord because this message had been sent specifically to his household the angel got a hold of him and they Dred him out of the city why because L had not come into that continence praise the lord of the things that you going to come to pass and yet the angel has seen the fire the angel has seen the judgments praise the Lord and in the hands of the Angels was mercy and lot praise the Lord he lingered praise the Lord he was looking around he did not attach much value to the message that the Angels had brought because the purpose of God was Deliverance of God to deliver him to redeem him out of the city God did it by force why because the time was at hand the message had been preached and he had the message he was delaying and God used Force to take him out of the city in order to deliver him that's how merciful he is the B has said because God is merciful because of his mercies he had to drag him out the Lord being merciful they brought him forth and set him without the praise the Lord and the prophet says as it was in them days he said so will it be the message went forth and they merely laughed at it and mocked at it as someone who was telling some kind of idol Tale But it was of Mercy it was of Grace it was of Deliverance and Angel said that morning to lot after he would give the message he said H come here so I can do nothing till thou Hast come here praise the Lord God sends a message and he can do nothing the people have received that message and until Deliverance has come unto them praise the Lord says I can do nothing without you you must first come out of the city before I hit the seity with judgment call judgment strikes praise the Lord and he promised us that he would send us a prophet he would send us a message praise the Lord message would be specific specific to the end time right says I will send Elijah the prophet before the great and grateful of the Lord I send a message of Mercy I would send a message of Deliverance praise the Lord and this message had to be preached it has to be preached and it has to reach Every Soul that was ordained to be delivered praise the Lord because without us without that Soul without that bright praise the Lord God can do nothing to the Earth praise the Lord because he says I'll send elah the prophet before the great and grateful day of the Lord praise the Lord and that message of of of Malachi the message of that Elijah would be a message to be call to attention to turn the hearts of the children back to their fathers praise the Lord and until all children have received this message until all children have had this message a message of Deliverance a mercy call has nothing to do with this Earth because he says behold the day come that the Earth shall burn as an OV but it says before that day there must be a message a message of Deliverance praise the Lord to deliver us a message of Mercy that God will show us Mercy that means the hands of the Prophet age praise the Lord in the hands of Malachi 4 was the message of Grace Grace to this age Grace to You Grace to me to Deliver Us From The Storm that is coming to hit the earth praise the Lord and God had seen it and when he saw it gave it to the prophet and when the prophet came as we shall see the events of time praise the Lord he also went ahead of time like lot like the angel that came to lot did praise the Lord like Moses did when God had sent him to deliver the children of Israel when God sends a man he gets him and he takes him ahead of time to show him the things that are to be praise the Lord that when he comes back to speak a message he's speaking from experience he speaking from an informed point of view speak because he has had an experience with it so that when Moses comes down on the last day when God was going to strike the land of Egypt with a plague God speaks to Moses and he tells him go and tell the people tell them that on such and such a day I will vist the death angel shall vist the land of and all the firstborns shall be killed and then when he that was the Judgment that was going to come to the land of but before that judgment God gave a word of caution to Moses told him I will kill every first but before that this is the Mery call go and tell the people go and tell every househ to kill a lamb and then app the blood upon the praise the Lord that was the message of mercy and by so doing if the angel looked at the blood pass that household praise the Lord and now Moses came and gathered all the people told he told them on such and such a day at such and such a Time the death angel shall pass and all firstborns are going to be killed but God has given us mercy here is the mercy take this message of Mercy told them there is the token token ofy and when you apply this token the angel shall pass over you praise the Lord and whoever applied this whoever heard it remember God made sure that every household had that message and he gave them a space of time praise the Lord before that day came every had the message praise the Lord everybody had the but there are those that did not apply the token but those that were predestinated to leave Egypt the promised land they received the word they received the message they took the message they applied the token and they received Mery and they were not K praise the Lord before he does judgment before he passes judgment he shows Mercy praise the Lord he showed Mery upon and he never said that if the Egyptians if they apply the token that I'll kill them no he gave a token he gave a message of Mery of deliverance from the oncoming Church and whoever did apply they were rescued there was coming a storm praise the Lord but there was a God's people God had to show them he had to show them Mery he had to deliver them praise the Lord because if he came to pass judgment he would kill them all but as he was passing judgement before that before that he sent a message why he is a just God praise the Lord he will never judge you he never judge the world he never judge the people without showing them a of escap gives us a word show us the way the way of ESC before judgment he showed them the of es before judgment talk about the days of Noah God was going to destroy the then he got a messenger he got Noah and he brought no and he showed Noah the things that were to be he showed them the flats showed him the RS praise the Lord and the RS were coming I remember it had never rained on the face of but God told Noah that there is coming rain and Noah didn't know even what rain was so God got him and he took him ahead of time and he showed him the RS praise the Lord and he showed him the floods and he showed him the judgments and the things that you are coming to strike the Earth and he saw the people suffocating he saw the people dying because of the floods then God told him before that judgment is Mercy here is the message of Mercy get this message take it to the people praise the Lord and he gave him the words and he told him go and build the ark and after you you're done during the AR tell the people judgment is coming but here is Deliverance he never brings judgment without showing Deliverance praise the Lord he showed them judgment he showed him judgment and at the same time he showed him Deliverance he said whosoever shall listen to your gospel whoever shall listen to your message whoever shall hear your message and receive it and will accept come as a as a token as a SE of acceptance as a SE of obedience as a Sy of reception of of Mercy them come and sit in the ark praise the Lord so Noah went forth he began to preach and he told the people it is going to rain and the people could not understand praise the Lord but a few of them and that was his household they understood him they did not only understand him but they came into experience with the message that was preaching they had never seen the r but by faith they believed it and they saw that rain was coming they could not imagine that the rains would come and fill up the entire Earth but by faith the message was preaching they believed it and they went to the AR praise the Lord and the RS came judgment was passed and whoever obeyed the voice and went to the ark was rescued there is always Mery before judgment praise the Lord and in the times the B says I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh and there shall be prophetic declarations praise the Lord like I said not the prophecies that we see everywh praise the Lord but we are talking about declaring the word of God we talking about declaring the things that are to be praise the Lord and we we are thankful to God that before judgment God has sent us a prophet praise the Lord God has given us mercy God has sent us a prophet to restore our faith to restore us to the original what praise the Lord he has sent us a prophet and he has given him all the instruments he has showed him all the things that are to be praise the Lord he got a hold of him like he got Noah he got Moses he got a hold of him and he took him ahead of time and he began showing him all the things to be before the end of the world and he showed him everything and then he saw it he was convinced that the things shall come pass then he came and preached us the message praise the Lord he preached us message message 4 a message of bringing us into the words bringing us into Christ before the oncoming judgment he showed him when they hear and they welcome it they are guided they are Guided by the spirit of God in their day praise the Lord in the times of in the times of of Paul they were Guided by the spirit of God that was upon Paul praise the Lord and every messenger God gave them a message specific to their age praise the Lord and whoever had this message they got into the spirit of the messenger and they were Guided by the spirit that was upon their messenger and in this day praise the lord we are Guided by that spirit that was with Willam BR he's the messenger of our day praise the Lord so now when you receive the message it's nothing else but Jesus Christ then you welcome it in your heart and then you start a new part new Walk of Life the Holy Spirit and some here and turn away not news happened the days of Noah it happened the days of L it happened when Moses preached it happen when Paul preached Happ when all the messengers preach some shall hear this message but they shall turn away praise the Lord maybe they are too smart to listen and take action why because this message is all fashioned praise the Lord it keeps you old fashioned keeps simple keeps you humble praise the Lord it keeps you in the modest nature of the holy spirit so those that are smart they shall hear and they shall some believe that this message is the truth praise the Lord but they we have time praise the Lord one day I was hearing there's a preacher a charic preacher charismatic preacher I think is the preacher of the group preaching and he said there is a special man that God sent in this age and that man has a special message he had a special Spirit stand and he could look at you and tell you your thoughts where you come from what you at and everything about you and that man is a special man great prophet of the age but then he goes ahead to preach contrary what that man preached he knows that this manent of God he knows that he is a prophet to the ede but maybe because of a few factors cannot receive the call continues in their own way yet this message comes to wonder people praise the Lord that time is First and this message comes to position the people to position us into the word of God for our day and that makes the difference it's the message of the hour that makes the difference it makes the difference between you that have received it and the rest of the world why because when you receive this message you come into that prophetic eye you come into praise the Lord you are into a different state of life and the way you see things is different from from the the world sees much as we all profess we all confess Jesus Christ but it places us into a different position praise the Lord it makes us obedience the word of God you become obedient anyhow it conforms us to the word of God praise the Lord anyhow find yourself obedient and conforming to the word of God praise the Lord when you look at yourself you see something special about something different that the world knows not praise the Lord why because you have received the spirit of and you have received the purose of God for your age positioning us so when you receive this message it is not giving us knowledge of things that are to be he not giving us knowledge about the rupture he not giving us things that there is coming a rupture is not only giving us knowledge of the church ages of the revelation of the Seven Seals but this message is a m call that is preparing us for the things that have been praise the Lord it gives us the knowledge of the things that are to be so we know that there is coming a rupture we know that before the end of times God has given us things God has given the prophets things that are to be so it does not profit you to know the things are to be praise the Lord and then you face judgment praise the Lord so this message it purpose is to give you the knowledge things that are to be and also prepare you for those things that are to be and the ultimate goal of it is to prepare the bright for the rupture message of Noah was prepare the people for the RS were coming and now our message is to prepare us for the rapture the Lord it is not to know the entire seven Church agents is not know the entire Seven Seals the seven trumpets and all the Mysteries no is to prepare us is to tell us that there is Mery tell us that judgment is coming and going the Earth here his mer yourself behind his mer that is the purpose of the message praise the Living God is to take us ahead of time to prepare us for the oncoming Jud to tell us to escape to tell us time is First prepare yourselves keep yourself in the words the message directs us toward Jesus Christ praise the Lord and the prophet says then the next thing you go on you go to church and you hear the h s the gospel preach something and the Holy Spirit begins to speak to you come repent and you say oh I'm young I got plenty of time yet I got this I've got to do this you are rejecting God is provided way judging yourself then how can you blame God you cannot how shall the world blame God they cannot because the gospel has been preached the message has been preached praise the Lord so you have to blame yourself there's not a bit of need of anyone going to hell God has made AED of you can't help being a sinner you can't help that you was bornn a sinner can help staying a sinner you accept Jesus as in your place he was made sin for you of es you don't have to be a sinner Christian you will be a Christian you be holy not your own Holiness his Holiness not what you are but what God has done for you in Christ see so the message of every season points the people something praise the L and in this generation God has sent us that message a must call calling the people that there is coming a storm that the Earth is going to burn repent be baptized everyone of us in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of our sins and we shall receive the gift of the holy spirit that takes us ahead of time and reveals to us the that we hidden from the of the world and it tell us tells us of the judgments reveals us of what the Judgment shall be gives shows us the Mage the of es and keeps us in the word the message directs us to the word praise the Lord and now praise the lord we know that things that we are hidden from the from the world when God got the prophet and took him ahead of time he revealed all these things him and the prophet revealed all these things unto us remember when the angel was showing these things to joh praise the Lord if you read Revelation 4 5 chter 6 before the seals when the angel was breaking down the things the Bible says John was about WR praise the Lord when he saw them he was about to write them and the angel told him to shut up the book close it leave it sealed why these things had to be revealed by the last messenger by the evening light messenger when the prophet came 4 praise the Lord God took him up in a vision in March 1963 and he began to reveal to him secrets that were in the Seven Seals praise the Lord and he showed him the first seal praise the Lord remember re 6 verse1 praise the Lord Brother can give us that scripture praise the Lord when the angel was bringing down telling the seals giving the SE to John Revelation 6 verse1 when John saw saw a white horse a white horse rerise the Lord and says and I saw when the lamb open one of the seals heard the noise of the Thunder saying come and see and in verse two and I saw and behold White Horse and he that sat on him had a bow and the crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and Conquer one that sat upon the horse he had a b praise the Lord and the Bible says he had a b and a crown but the did not have an arrow so now he went out conquering threatening threatening the Conquering and to conquer praise the Lord and the world is confused of what that horse rider is when they see a white horse rider praise the Lord they may think that is Jesus Christ but that was not Jesus Christ that was the Antichrist of the Antichrist praise the Lord and when God came down and the showed the things to Willam BR show him that that wasn't that wasn't Jesus Christ that was the Antichrist praise the Lord and when he saw the he was crowned and who was he praise the Lord and the prophet says that that was the Antichrist praise the Lord he went out conquering in the first SE when he saw that one he says one riding the the White Horse and that was not actually the son of man it was the Antichrist pling in the white RO with a crown on pretending to portray righteousness in order to gain control and conqu as many as he could but soon his true colors would show up praise the Lord and in the second seal after he had gained control he began causing War killing and causing M to those that stood with the words he isn't the son of man praise the Lord the messenger was able scroll down and when he had opened the third seal that I beheld and a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances praise the Lord scroll down and I heard a voice saying in the mid of the a measure of it for a penny and three measures of B for a penny [Music] and see thou the oil and praise the Lord trade control over economies praise the lord of the earth and this control proph says it caused spiritual starvation but no one would be allowed to preach except they had maybe a license Authority from the that be the Antichrist changing form and in that time the people stared and it was a dark moment when there was spiritual Darkness praise the Lord and these seals keep resolving revolving over time spiritually conquered the people had been spiritually conquered and yet there is thirst for the true word of God and the people are lining up today behind false teachers behind false prophets praise the Lord behind the working of the Antichrist Spirit teaching people doctrines of demil teaching the wrong doctrines and piling up themselves wealth causing spiritual hunger are suffering from spiritual hunger spiritually being suffering to be fed praise the Lord but being taken advantage of by the spirit of the Antichrist that operates the church Ming the gospel monetizing the gospel foral praise the Lord turning the gospel praise the Lord in two weals praise the Lord asking the people to come be prayed up but pay some money and causing all that kind of spiritual confusion and then you see people piling uping up going out for to be prayed for because these men the Antichrist the anti Antichrist Spirit present the Antichrist spirit the anti Spirit presents himself in a very [Music] manner praise the Lord with the religious Rob powerful men men of God and then you see very many people railing up there ling up in the churches com and be prayed for come and receive blessings from them praying money for blessings praise the Lord the Antichrist Spirit taking over the churching theing the gospel but the seven Angel saw it saw it praise the lord and there is a call out of the price to come out of her that you don't sh her plague say come out because it is fallen and God is not in it the Antichrist theion cing many to commit fornication there is a call for Mery there is a call for deliverance in the end times come out of my people to come into Christ praise the Lord and in the fourth seal the angel showed and what did he see praise the Lord a Pale Horse he began as as a white horse rider and now here is a Pale Horse the same person changing form to meet his targets God revealed to ask what this is and the prophet says this is the final phase of the Antichrist Reign death through various means including religious deception and spiritual death in the fourth seal praise the lord we saw the matter the killing of the matters the killing of the Apostles the healing of the disciples the faithful the word of God praise the Lord and now we see them being killed at the hands of the Antichrist crying out for Mercy for God to vent judgment upon the Earth upon those that have killed them to Revenge their bloods upon the one that has killed them and we see a cry out how long will you take to avenge our blood upon them that kill us and kill our brothers and the prophet says those are the voices of the disciples the voices of the Apostles the voices of the MS before the altar that we are killed by the Antichrist and in theth Seal we see the revelation of a period of tribulation the of God calling upon the Earth upon them that refuse to believe the words to believe the Mery a per of suffering world with the earthquakes warning the people of the W of God and they need to prepare themselves for the day of the Lord come out of her my people is the Mery call today don't be partakers of her the message being preached to separate us praise the Lord to make us separate bringing all the spiritual Revelations that we are able to discern that you have a spirit of discernment know that this is the working of the Antichrist praise the Lord to know how the Antichrist operates without the spiritual ey without the prophetic eye 4 there is no way you can discern the operations of the Antichrist but we thank God that by the prophet of Mal he has given us the grace to be able to discern praise the Lord the operations the Antichrist the working of the devil praise the Lord we are able to know that the faith that we have is given to us freely that we don't need to pay money in order to receive the Salvation praise the Lord and when we see them we are able to know that it's the working of the Antichrist there is no in it there is a call come out of my people don't be partakers of her praise the Lord and now all these Revelations six seals praise the Lord are a preparation preparing us praise the Lord when you know who the Antichrist is it's not enough if you don't keep yourself in the word praise the Lord you need a word because it is our Salvation the Bible says they overcame him all the tribulations that subjected us onto that the enemy the Antichrist and all her operations subject the church to the Bible says they overcame him we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the power of Our Testimony and the Bible says in Revelation 19 that this testimony that we have the testimony of Jesus Christ prise the lord so when you have the testimony of Jesus Christ the lord and says that same testimony is the word of God so when you have the testimony which is the word of God you are able to go ahead of time when you see the times the trials shall subject when we see the tribulations as spoken of the seal the world going through turbulent moments earthquakes walls and all those fightings and the things that break our hearts when men's Hearts begin failing for fear praise the lord we look up why because we know we have received the word we have the testimony the word of Jesus Christ and this word of Jesus Christ given us the spiritual Revelations and able to go ahead of time we know that the things are to be when we begin to see the things taking place our hearts are not troubled you have the word of God you have the revelation of the message you have the reation of the word of God and you are able to go ahead of time see these things and when they happen you are is established in the word of God and you are not troubled why the word has established you the word has prepared you the word has made you ready praise Lord for the Judgment that is to come and in the seventh seal there was silence praise the Lord there was silence in the seventh seal silence in Heavens praise the Lord remember in the 16th seal there was suffering tribulation people's hearts were being put at at stake they are failing for fear looking at the earthquakes today you hear news there an in China thousand of people have Pastor you hear there was an earthquake in the US was this there was this a war in Ukraine there is a war in Iran there is a war in Palestine people's hearts are failing for fear this are prophetic Declarations of things that are to be we thank God that we have been established we have received the mer and because we have the master call our hearts have been established in the word of God and as long as we have the word of God says we overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ and by the power of Our Testimony which is the word of God which has established us and we can sail we can s above all the storms all the worries praise the Lord all the things that the world is facing because we have received the Mery call praise the Lord and all the things must come to pass praise the Lord without the message without the messenger we would not be able to know that the white raer in Revelation 6 ver is not Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ appears in Revelations chter 19 praise the Lord and then he appears he appears with judgment the seven seal there was silence praise the Lord what was the silence judgment the Rapture sudden take all the pr judgment comes but God has established Us by the message of the hour he has revealed unto us all these things that had been hidden from the foundation of the world and he has revealed all of them unto us praise the lord we know who the Antichrist Revelation verse 11 remember we saw praise the Lord that he took over threat and control over economies and in 13: 11 I beheld another Beast now he has taken over another form coming up out of the earth and had two horns like a lamb SP as a dragon and exercises all power the first Beast before him and listen and causes the Earth and them which dwell there in toship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he does great wonders so that he makes come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of great Miracles causing great Miracles praise the Lord great teachers because of the spirit of the Antichrist he had power to even bring fire from doubt and deceives them that dwell on the Earth by means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had wound SW and did live and he had power to give life the image of the Beast that the the image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be Ked he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond you see the mark in their right hand foreheads and that no man buy or sell he had a mark the name of the Beast the name of the Beast the of his name the Antichrist changing form and here he has power to make Miracles he has power to even heal he has power to cast out devil praise the Lord but what makes him how how are we able to discern is by the word of God praise the Lord anything that does not confess the Lord Jesus Christ as Lord and savior in the spirit of the Antichrist praise the Lord and anything that rejects the message of the hour that rejects the word of God for our day is the spirit of the Antichrist because the message of the hour is the revelation of Jesus Christ praise the Lord is the revelation of the godhead is the message of the hour that reveals to us that there is but one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord anything that does not confess that Jesus is Lord is the of antichrist whether causes Fire come from heaven and follow the Earth whether they cause Miracles as long as they don't confess that Jesus is God comeing flesh is the sweet of the Antichrist and judgment is coming to burn them up there is a fire that is coming to burn up the Earth Whoever has rejected this message shall be bured and here is wisdom let him that have understanding count the number of the Beast for the number of a man he started out in the first SE praise the Lord as a white Rider then he comes in red he comes in Bale he comes in BL praise the Lord and now he comes at the Beast he comes as the dragon and the Bible says all this is one person Satan praise the Lord trying to change forms until he graduates himself in form of a man to take control over the Earth and here is wisdom let him that have understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man his number is 63 score the world teaches that the that that this 6003 score and six praise the Lord that is going to be a Mark that is going to be put in the ahead praise the Lord but we thank God the message of The Hour That by the message of the hour will able to know that this is not a Mark or this is not a kind of a form of something or something but this is a man praise the Lord Satan comeing anding himself himself into a man to take control over the Earth here is wisdom count the number of the Beast and his number the number of a man so the white Rider the red horse rider the black all of them graduate into this image into a man and this man is the Antichrist this man positions himself in the place of the son of man and he worshiped like the son of man he's worshiped like Jesus Christ he called holy and people bow down and worship the devil Satan himself condescending and graduating himself into this man that he can cause praise the Lord persecution to the word of God praise the Lord and the Bible says he has power to call fire from heaven he has power to make Miracles but he Makes Miracles as long as he does not hold the word of God and as long as he does not confess there is but one God is the Antichrist praise the Lord even if he's a great preacher but if he teaches that there are three gods in one he is the spirit of the Antichrist because the spirit of the Lord was only one God from the beginning there was one God in the end still one God the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord so even if he's a great preacher and he comes and preaches for Paul says if there is if there is any other I guess it is 2 ver 6 it says even if it is I if I come back in the resurrection and Angel come and preach in other gospel that there are three Gods it says Let Me Be A C praise the Lord why because there are is only one God and outside that the spirit of the Antichrist and the message of the hour is calling us out the Antichrist spirits of the doctrines of devils come out of her to come into the word to come into Christ such that we can be rescued from the Judgment that is coming to hit the word praise the Lord so before God judges he has sent us this message to give us spiritual Revelations praise the Lord that there is one God if you notice that he says in the message will the church go before the tribulation did you notice that the says I can't do nothing till you come here what was it it was a message of the and before one of fire would fall from L had to get out of before one drop of rain fell from heaven went to the Earth before at the atom bomb can strike this nation the church the Bride of Jesus Christ will go in the rupture to me Jesus Christ everything is in order and he says I'm so glad says oh that great hour to think that we've had a part in this Junction to think we've had a part in this Junction remember so it shall be in the coming of the son of before the fire fell L was out but the angel said I can't do nothing I have got the liver in my hand to pull and make the fire fall from Heaven and the end of Destruction is holding the the hand of Russia atomic bombs that is going to judge this world fire until the church comes together as one great body of Christ I can't do nothing you come here God shall do nothing until you come here shall do nothing bright into the word the word is the message oftion word is the message of Mercy the word is the message of Deliverance speaking to us every other time to prepare us to prepare our souls prepare our hearts for the Rapture before the Judgment praise the Lord behold the day come that shall burn an and all the all that do wickedly shall be St and the day that cometh them up the Lord but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righte arise with healing in his wings he shall go forth and grow up as CS of the stto youto US that fear his name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings he can do nothing until the bright comes out he could do nothing lot was out of the city this is the message that is preparing us for the Rapture at the same time preparing us to pass over judgment it is a message of Deliverance
