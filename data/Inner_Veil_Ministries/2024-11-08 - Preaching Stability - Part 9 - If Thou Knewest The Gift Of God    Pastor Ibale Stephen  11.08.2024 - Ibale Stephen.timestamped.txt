[3:19] there

[3:24] [Music]
[3:26] re that's
[3:31] shall run
[3:37] dry
[3:40] come
[3:42] to this
[3:47] water there
[3:50] is a
[3:53] vast
[3:57] of oh
[4:01] there
[4:03] is a
[4:08] rever that
[4:12] never
[4:15] shall
[4:17] run
[4:23] Dr
[4:25] amen we've got a
[4:28] river which shall never run
[4:31] dry amen so you are welcome to the house
[4:35] of the
[4:36] Lord and I trust that the Lord has been
[4:39] good to you throughout the
[4:42] week amen he says I
[4:46] know Sister Maria he says I
[4:50] know I know your
[4:52] trials I know your
[4:55] tribulations he knows he knows whatever
[4:57] we go
[4:58] through but in all things we need to be
[5:02] thankful to
[5:03] God who knows us inside
[5:07] out you know uh one of the greatest
[5:11] stories brother Bram
[5:15] told and I've been meditating on that
[5:17] story for about a
[5:21] week is the story of
[5:25] Napoleon the prohibitionist
[5:31] amen he fought all
[5:35] Europe and brought it into his
[5:39] submission you can imagine he won all
[5:44] Europe at the age of
[5:48] 33 who is 33
[5:54] here very
[5:56] young you know and he conquered all
[6:01] he had all men under his
[6:05] command so he started the battles as a
[6:08] just
[6:10] man
[6:13] amen from the age of 17 to
[6:18] 25 he never
[6:20] drunk but as he kept conquering
[6:24] Nations he kept losing
[6:28] himself there certain things that you
[6:31] do when you get involved in
[6:34] them they keep weakening your
[6:39] personality so at
[6:42] 33 he had conquered all
[6:45] Europe and then he
[6:48] cried he looked
[6:50] around there was no more Other Nation
[6:54] conquer and there are people who are
[6:56] like
[6:58] that that they fight
[7:01] everybody but when they come to the last
[7:04] man they always remember I also have to
[7:08] be
[7:11] conquered amen there was no more
[7:14] countries to
[7:15] conquer and at that time he realized
[7:20] that from the age of
[7:22] 25 got preoccupied in conquering
[7:27] Nations and then he lost the
[7:30] control of himself over
[7:35] alcohol and Napoleon
[7:37] died at the age of
[7:40] 33 as an
[7:43] alcoholist from a
[7:46] prohibitionist to the man conquered by
[7:51] alcohol and he had cried I have
[7:54] conquered all
[7:56] Europe but who will conquer me
[8:00] so as we live our
[8:02] lives it's very
[8:04] important to keep
[8:06] looking and looking deep on inside of
[8:11] s that father as I fight help me to
[8:16] fight against the things that can
[8:19] overcome
[8:20] me amen so I certainly appreciate God
[8:26] myself for the grace he has given me for
[8:30] you know continuing with the
[8:33] exaltations amen and I know that the
[8:36] exaltations as we share them morning and
[8:42] evening amen it is building us
[8:45] up amen I had a discussion with a
[8:51] sister for about a whole
[8:54] hour when I was talking about uh uh
[8:59] beside
[9:08] give so and she
[9:11] said if there is anything that has ever
[9:15] built
[9:17] me this is what has established my
[9:20] Christian
[9:22] life so I would encourage
[9:27] you along this period of time
[9:31] just pick up the state of a perfect
[9:35] man all Blasphemous
[9:38] names and read it for you to really be
[9:42] able to
[9:44] understand what we shall be dealing
[9:47] with amen did you love the special
[9:52] songs amen they were singing about the
[9:57] fountain and I thank God for that
[10:00] Fountain of Living
[10:02] Water amen God bless you brother
[10:06] Cal amen God will continue building your
[10:10] gift let's stand up and get to John
[10:13] chapter
[10:15] 4 and verse 10 Let's Just Surrender to
[10:19] him okay so that the Lord may speak to
[10:22] us this
[10:24] morning encourage us and establish
[10:28] us amen amen John 4:
[10:32] 10 this is the story of
[10:35] Jesus with that woman at the
[10:39] well amen and Jesus I mean uh so Jesus
[10:45] ask the woman for some
[10:47] what and she says you have nothing to
[10:50] draw
[10:52] with and you know they were flowing in
[10:55] two different channels
[10:59] Jesus was speaking from the supernatural
[11:03] Channel and this woman was speaking in
[11:06] the natural
[11:08] channel it's always very
[11:11] important when we come to fellowship
[11:13] with
[11:14] God to surrender the
[11:17] s that we may come on the principles of
[11:22] the
[11:23] supernatural that we give ourselves a
[11:26] way that the Lord himself they have
[11:30] preeminence and speak to us from his own
[11:34] language which is the language of
[11:37] Revelation is that amen yeah that's very
[11:41] very
[11:42] important amen coming before him through
[11:46] the blood of Jesus Christ not condemning
[11:50] ourselves because the blood has
[11:52] completely Sanctified you and made you
[11:56] perfect enough to stand before him
[12:01] amen so how many have come to Fellowship
[12:05] from under the
[12:07] blood without the blood you are not
[12:10] worthy to come into that
[12:12] presence so this woman here found
[12:16] ourself in this
[12:17] presence and it's just like we are in
[12:20] the message of the
[12:22] hour because in the message of the hour
[12:25] the prophet was hearing from
[12:27] God and then giving us to I mean giving
[12:31] it to
[12:32] us but then we need to be like a
[12:35] John who said John who says I was in the
[12:39] spirit of the
[12:41] Lord then I heard so if we are going to
[12:44] hear from God we need to be in the same
[12:47] channel because we come into
[12:51] Fellowship amen with a supernatural God
[12:55] who was spoken to us by a supernatural
[13:00] gift in the end time so if we take our
[13:04] intellect we shall certainly stumble at
[13:07] the
[13:09] Revelation so Jesus says give me
[13:12] water amen I mean and then she I mean
[13:17] she says I'm I'm I'm I'm a
[13:22] Samaritan and you are a Jew we have no
[13:26] you know attachment of whatsoever kind
[13:30] so we don't come to church in our kind
[13:33] of
[13:34] self it doesn't matter what tribe I am
[13:38] it doesn't matter what level of
[13:40] Education I am or what level of wealth I
[13:44] am come to the church as Sons and
[13:47] Daughters of
[13:49] God Amen John
[13:52] 410 Jesus answered and said unto
[13:55] her if thou knewest the gift of God
[14:01] and who it is that says unto
[14:04] thee me to drink th would thou wouldest
[14:08] have asked of
[14:11] him and he would give thee Living
[14:15] Water may the Lord that bless in the
[14:17] reading of his
[14:19] word amen you may be
[14:21] seated so for the
[14:24] title if thou knewest the gift of God
[14:31] God if
[14:33] thouest the gift of
[14:36] God this woman didn't know that
[14:39] gift and so Jesus was
[14:43] laboring to bring up to the
[14:47] realization of who he was so Jesus
[14:51] missed the woman at the
[14:53] well and he demanded of
[14:58] her and she says how is it that you a
[15:03] Jew ask a drink of
[15:06] me and I'm a woman of
[15:08] [Music]
[15:09] Samaria amen for the Jews have not
[15:12] dealings with the
[15:15] Samaritans so she was looking at
[15:18] Christ from the physical
[15:22] aspect she was looking at a
[15:25] Jew so when we come to church you don't
[15:30] look at
[15:31] yourself from the angle of the natural
[15:35] man look at yourself from the Ang of son
[15:40] and daughter of
[15:42] God but Christ replied to her and said
[15:47] if you
[15:48] knew the gift of God and and who it is
[15:52] that as says to you give me to
[15:56] drink you would have asked of him
[16:00] and he would have given
[16:02] you living water are you together with
[16:06] me Jesus
[16:08] knew that that woman needed better
[16:13] water than what she was drawing from the
[16:17] well so she did not know that the man
[16:21] she was talking
[16:23] to had the
[16:25] ability to give her the better
[16:27] water and the better water was the
[16:31] Living
[16:33] Water amen which would give eternal
[16:38] life and this was without
[16:41] money without price Jesus says you just
[16:45] cannot
[16:47] understand because silver and gold
[16:51] cannot afford the
[16:53] water that I would have given you if you
[16:57] knew who I was that I was I mean that
[17:00] was talking to you so it's important for
[17:04] us to come to church
[17:07] pray because we are going to hear from
[17:11] God we don't just come down here because
[17:15] it's a Sunday
[17:16] routine we need to come to church like a
[17:19] Jo on the island of
[17:22] pmos he was prayed up and then he
[17:26] testified I was in the spirit
[17:30] on the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[17:33] great
[17:34] voice as of a
[17:36] trumpet it was not a trumpet but it was
[17:40] a voice as sharp and
[17:43] direct as the voice of a
[17:46] trumpet so if we are going to live as
[17:50] Christians we have to be in his
[17:53] Spirit like John was in his
[17:56] Spirit John was not talking about being
[18:00] in his own
[18:02] spirit that would not have brought these
[18:06] Visions it had to be the spirit of
[18:09] God and it has to be the spirit of
[18:13] God with us
[18:15] too all others all our way fors are in
[18:20] vain so we come to church when we are
[18:24] zeroed in
[18:25] him amen praise the Lord
[18:29] so if there is
[18:31] anything amen that we need to do
[18:35] friends we need to come to church when
[18:37] we are prepared to be in
[18:41] church amen you don't just wake up come
[18:45] to church your mind is not in
[18:48] church you are going to keep looking at
[18:50] your
[18:52] watch because you got a business meeting
[18:55] or you got some visitors and gave them a
[18:59] specific
[19:00] time as if you had an agreement with the
[19:03] holy
[19:05] spirit that by noon the service should
[19:08] be
[19:11] over you see what I'm saying so if there
[19:14] is anything good that will come to
[19:17] us it has to be revealed by the
[19:21] spirit confirmed by the
[19:24] word and made manifest by the result it
[19:27] bear
[19:30] so here is this
[19:32] woman she has come to the well like she
[19:36] always comes to the world like you
[19:39] always come to church but I want to tell
[19:42] you there will be one turn when that
[19:46] well when that church when that service
[19:51] there will be a greater appearing of
[19:54] Christ so we come to church when we are
[19:58] prepared for moments like
[20:00] that amen that day at the well there was
[20:05] a different
[20:07] woman I mean a different
[20:09] man but she was
[20:12] wondering why does a
[20:15] man come to the
[20:17] well when a man comes to the
[20:20] well it draws a lot of
[20:24] attention are you together with me yes
[20:27] sir was
[20:30] like when he went to the well it drew a
[20:33] lot of
[20:35] attention it made all those young ladies
[20:37] very
[20:39] excited because to go to the well among
[20:43] the Jews was the work of the
[20:46] women are you together with me so who is
[20:49] bride here this
[20:50] morning I believe I'm the Bride of the
[20:53] Lord Jesus Christ and we should be at
[20:56] the well this
[20:57] morning and meeting the
[21:00] man at the well should exactly excite
[21:05] us we should be able to say some
[21:08] amen we should be able to do some
[21:10] clapping if you want
[21:12] to why because there is a man at the
[21:17] well and the woman was very
[21:20] excited but then the man at the
[21:23] well says what is exciting you
[21:28] you knew who I was but this woman here
[21:33] did not know that the man who was there
[21:37] was himself a Fountain of
[21:41] Life Hallelujah there was a natural well
[21:46] and there was a spiritual well and the
[21:49] spiritual well was telling this woman
[21:53] draw from me because if you draw from me
[21:57] you will never come back for this
[21:58] natural
[22:00] water amen I would rather take that
[22:03] Everlasting
[22:05] water amen if you knew the gift of
[22:09] God so the
[22:11] fountain the Lord Jesus
[22:14] Christ was identifying
[22:17] himself as the gift of
[22:21] God Amen he
[22:24] himself was the gift of
[22:27] God now in in
[22:29] Samaria there was a day when Peter went
[22:34] and was actually laying hands on the
[22:37] people and they were receiving the gift
[22:40] of
[22:41] God the bosom of the Holy Ghost so one
[22:45] man came he was Simon
[22:49] sorer he wanted to take the gift of
[22:53] God by money but Peter said unto him
[22:58] thy money perish with
[23:01] thee because thou Hast
[23:04] thought that the gift of God may be
[23:07] purchased with
[23:09] money amen so Jesus is telling this
[23:14] woman that you need to break into the
[23:19] dimension that I'm speaking you from
[23:22] because if you get into that
[23:24] Dimension you will know who I am because
[23:28] I'm
[23:29] gift come from God that cannot be
[23:33] bought by money or by price but if you
[23:38] draw of
[23:39] me you will be drawing eternal
[23:43] life amen so this gift is
[23:47] Christ coming into the
[23:49] life of a Believer as the baptism of the
[23:53] Holy
[23:54] Ghost amen he says if you knew the gift
[23:59] that is standing before you amen so John
[24:03] chapter
[24:04] 7 and verse
[24:06] 37 are you still here this
[24:09] morning amen okay verse 37
[24:13] here he says in that last
[24:17] day that great day of the
[24:22] feast Jesus stood and cried
[24:26] saying man
[24:30] let him come unto me and
[24:32] drink he is giving free
[24:35] water because it's a free
[24:38] gift a woman at the well if you knew the
[24:42] gift of God who was standing before
[24:46] you so he that believeth on
[24:49] me as the scripture
[24:52] says out of his
[24:55] belly shall flow rivers of living
[25:01] that's what
[25:02] Jesus amen was inviting this woman
[25:06] to that receive me on the inside of you
[25:11] and out of you I will be flowing as a
[25:15] living
[25:17] water amen praise the Lord when we come
[25:21] down here amen out of our
[25:26] belly rivers of living
[25:29] water and where that ring water
[25:32] flows it flows with a
[25:36] gift if you knew the gift of
[25:38] God he fls with the
[25:41] gift
[25:43] amen
[25:45] Apostles some prophets to some teachers
[25:50] to some
[25:51] Administration to some prayer warriors
[25:55] to some
[25:56] musicians to some with GI of healing
[26:00] some gifts of wisdom so when we come
[26:03] together then flows the rivers of Living
[26:09] Water
[26:12] amen you may be the one who is having
[26:15] that
[26:16] flow hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[26:20] Jesus says you just don't know only you
[26:23] knew the gift of him that is standing
[26:26] before you Hallelujah Hallelujah and
[26:29] verse
[26:30] 39 but this spake of the
[26:35] spirit which they that believe on
[26:39] him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[26:43] was not yet
[26:46] given because that Jesus was not yet
[26:52] glorified so the Holy Ghost listen to me
[26:56] now is the gift of
[27:00] God that was standing before that
[27:07] woman by the person of the Lord Jesus
[27:11] Christ amen you see he was right there
[27:16] and he says I am the gift of God but you
[27:21] have look at me through the ve you can
[27:25] get to see the rivers of Living Water
[27:29] bringing himself down
[27:33] condescending comaling down to be made
[27:36] King f with the
[27:39] sinner amen think of it
[27:44] people how can you reject that matless
[27:51] love amen he's offering you live I mean
[27:55] rivers of Living Water
[27:59] the woman did not
[28:01] know that Jesus was God's wrapped
[28:06] gift in a human body and he said you've
[28:11] heard how I said unto
[28:14] you I go
[28:16] away and come again after you I go away
[28:21] I take away the body
[28:23] for and then send back the rivers of
[28:27] Living Water
[28:30] I go away in the bodly
[28:32] form I come back as the gift of God to
[28:36] you so the gift of God is the life of
[28:41] the
[28:41] person the Lord Jesus Christ and God
[28:45] gives us this
[28:47] gift as the baptism of the Holy
[28:50] Ghost amen how does this gift come it
[28:55] comes through Acts chapter 238
[29:00] repent and be baptized every one of
[29:03] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:07] for the remission of your
[29:09] sins and ye shall
[29:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[29:16] the promises unto you and to your
[29:20] children and all that are far
[29:23] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[29:26] shall call
[29:28] the principle is
[29:31] constant amen nothing changes repent be
[29:36] baptized receive the gift are you
[29:39] together with me that's the way we can
[29:41] receive the
[29:43] gift praise God repent which means to
[29:48] change your
[29:50] mind
[29:52] positively causing the change of your
[29:54] ways of
[29:56] life amen
[29:58] so when you repent from the sinful
[30:02] ways that control your life then be
[30:06] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:10] Christ so
[30:13] baptism means to submerge in
[30:17] water but Paul identifies it with
[30:22] barrial as one comes out of the
[30:26] water it points to resurrected
[30:30] life hallelujah hallu praise God no you
[30:35] not that so many of us as we baptized
[30:39] into Jesus Christ we baptized into his
[30:43] death oh
[30:45] Hallelujah Jesus tells this woman if you
[30:50] know the
[30:53] gift and who it is not speaking to you
[30:58] amen so our title this
[31:02] month amen preaching
[31:06] stability part
[31:08] n if thouest
[31:11] who
[31:14] Saturday amen these are the stabilities
[31:18] that we want to build the
[31:21] church because if you know the
[31:26] foundation then you know
[31:28] that you have the ability to catch
[31:31] light amen
[31:34] repent be baptized and this baptism
[31:39] here amen is a barrier with
[31:43] Christ and as Christ rose with the
[31:45] newness of
[31:47] life amen then we also after the
[31:51] bapm should resol with the newness of
[31:56] life amen amen Romans chapter
[31:59] 6 verse
[32:01] 4 he says
[32:03] therefore we areed with
[32:06] him by baptism into
[32:12] death we are trying to
[32:15] understand the constant
[32:19] principle repent bapti receive the gift
[32:24] and I believe that all of us here
[32:28] have repented have got a
[32:31] desire to live a clean life to live like
[32:35] a Christ you have put up a
[32:38] battle amen and you have got the blood
[32:42] constantly washing
[32:46] you amen and then after that you die to
[32:52] the things you've repented
[32:55] of how do you die to those things
[32:59] by you
[33:00] accepting to say Lord
[33:03] Jesus I know
[33:05] baptism does not save
[33:08] me amen I can as well go into the
[33:12] water as a dry
[33:15] Sinner and come out as a wet
[33:18] cner but at this time
[33:22] Heavenly my
[33:24] desire which is on the inside that I
[33:28] have to die to
[33:30] see I'm going to show
[33:33] it by me going into water and as I come
[33:37] out of water let it be a sign that I'm
[33:41] going to walk
[33:44] different amen so you know let's go back
[33:49] to Romans
[33:51] 64 therefore you are buried with him by
[33:54] baptism into death
[33:58] that like as Christ was raised up from
[34:00] the
[34:02] dead by the glory of the
[34:05] father even so we
[34:07] also should
[34:09] walk in the newness of
[34:12] Life hallelujah hallelujah he was raised
[34:16] from the
[34:17] dead by the glory of the
[34:20] father and he was not the same
[34:23] anymore hallelujah hallelujah the
[34:26] Pharisees
[34:28] could not lay hand on him
[34:31] anymore he was different he was a
[34:34] newness of
[34:36] Life
[34:38] amenu yeah now I want you to understand
[34:43] baptism in a deeper
[34:46] definition than going into
[34:49] water because the act of going into
[34:54] water mentioning the right formula
[34:59] that the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:01] Christ is not exactly the
[35:07] baptism the
[35:09] baptism should be a decision from the
[35:12] inner
[35:13] man that I'm dying to
[35:16] see Hallelujah I'm going to bury my
[35:21] SE so when the inner
[35:24] man has accepted to go and bu the SE
[35:29] when he's coming
[35:31] out is actually not
[35:35] Desiring to walk by that sin
[35:38] anymore is that amen for everybody you
[35:42] don't desire to walk in
[35:45] that it doesn't mean you cannot be
[35:48] tempted it cannot mean that you cannot
[35:52] fall you can fall but you cannot
[35:56] completely
[35:58] amen remain in the
[36:00] for you
[36:02] rise because that's not your nature of
[36:06] life God called you to live
[36:10] different amen so one must go in
[36:14] water as one that's being M into the
[36:17] nature of
[36:19] Christ and that's how we receive the
[36:22] Holy
[36:23] Ghost we baptize
[36:26] you in the name and the name speaks of
[36:30] the
[36:31] nature we baptize you in
[36:34] water to the nature of
[36:38] Christ hallelujah hallelujah that's how
[36:41] you receive the Holy Ghost because we
[36:43] are being baptized into our
[36:47] nature amen and the principle is
[36:51] constant so the B of the Holy
[36:54] Ghost releases the life of
[36:58] releases his
[37:00] nature releases his character to the
[37:03] church he releases
[37:06] himself as a life as a living
[37:10] water as a
[37:12] talent amen as a
[37:15] ministry as a
[37:17] seal as a guide so the B of the Holy
[37:21] goost is not a dead
[37:25] anointing it's not a dead anointing
[37:29] amen it's an active
[37:32] life oh praise God Amen let's go to
[37:36] Matthew chapter
[37:38] 25 and verse
[37:40] 14 do you love him church I love him too
[37:46] amen 25
[37:49] verse4 for the Kingdom of
[37:55] Heaven is as a man traveling into the
[37:58] far
[38:00] country now listen the Kingdom of
[38:05] Heaven is not a man traveling to a
[38:08] country but is as a
[38:11] man traveling into a far
[38:14] country he calls his own
[38:17] servants and commits to them his
[38:22] Goods not their goods now it is his
[38:26] Goods he says come on now come and
[38:31] become
[38:34] custodians and one he gives five
[38:39] talents to another
[38:41] two to another three to another one to
[38:46] every man according to his several
[38:50] ability and straight away took his
[38:53] journey are you together with me he
[38:56] gives
[38:58] thing
[38:59] his
[39:02] talent okay he opens
[39:05] up a certain
[39:08] measure of the river of Living
[39:11] [Music]
[39:13] Water and in
[39:15] there God flows into your
[39:20] life with the
[39:24] talent amen that's how God does
[39:29] not their
[39:31] goods but his
[39:33] Goods this speaks of
[39:36] you being a
[39:38] steward Hallelujah and when you are a
[39:41] steward when you begin to
[39:47] administer amen the gift given unto you
[39:51] then you are
[39:53] flowing a measure of Living Water
[39:58] to the church are you together with me
[40:01] yes the baptism by you know the gift of
[40:06] God the baptism by the gift of
[40:10] God produces different
[40:14] abilities and the way we tend to these
[40:20] abilities is what we call the
[40:24] stewardship amen we must learn that in
[40:29] the kingdom of God we are just
[40:34] stewards amen he gave them his own you
[40:38] gifts amen now Paul defines this
[40:45] stewardship in First Corinthians chapter
[40:49] 4 and verse
[40:52] one he says let show let a man show
[40:57] account of
[41:01] us as of the Ministers of
[41:05] Christ and stewards of the Min of the
[41:09] mysteries of
[41:12] God think of
[41:14] us on this
[41:16] order that we are
[41:19] ministers and the
[41:21] ministers are stewards of the mysteries
[41:24] of God
[41:30] moreover it's required in
[41:33] stewards that a man be found
[41:40] faithful it requires
[41:43] faithfulness because you are an
[41:45] [Music]
[41:47] administrator not a appropriator
[41:57] amen you are just an
[42:02] administrator amen when he was
[42:05] going into a
[42:08] country he says
[42:10] keep and use this until I
[42:15] come are you together with me all of us
[42:20] whatever gift we
[42:21] have it take
[42:24] this and use it until I come whether you
[42:29] are a prophet take this use it until I
[42:34] come whether you are a pastor take this
[42:39] use it until I come whether you are a
[42:43] musician take this use it until I come
[42:48] we are not
[42:51] propri amen we cannot use the gift of
[42:55] God as proor
[42:58] our submission to
[43:00] him while using the
[43:03] gift is faithful
[43:08] stewardship amen that is faithful
[43:12] stewardship so to every man according to
[43:16] his
[43:18] ability every
[43:21] maned
[43:25] meure amen amen every man brother Steven
[43:30] you''ve got a measure and a big
[43:33] one look at your
[43:38] Bible praise the Lord amen the Lord has
[43:41] given us
[43:43] measures we drink of the Same
[43:46] Spirit but then manifest
[43:53] sever according to different measures
[43:57] of the same
[43:59] gift which is
[44:02] Christ amen listen to brother Bram
[44:06] here he says and how that brother
[44:13] Cobo sitting there told me he was just
[44:19] converted from a night
[44:24] club he and his wife
[44:27] and now that
[44:29] singing how do you try to impersonate
[44:33] that it is a gift comes from God now the
[44:39] gift was in him when he was
[44:43] born amen the gift was in the other
[44:48] man when he was born but what they use
[44:52] it
[44:53] for is what goes
[44:58] amen that's where we have to
[45:01] answer how we use the gifts that God has
[45:05] given
[45:08] us brother and his wife were in the
[45:11] night
[45:13] club they were
[45:15] gifted all these men here who sing with
[45:19] voices up and
[45:21] down they were gifted Lucifer himself
[45:26] was gifted
[45:30] so every man will have to answer for his
[45:36] talent God gives men
[45:39] talent and they have to use it some can
[45:43] preach like a house on
[45:46] fire but God requires these
[45:50] talents and I'm so thankful to know that
[45:54] this Brethren sitting back there
[45:57] yielded their
[46:00] talents which they could be out there
[46:02] night
[46:04] class using those talents but they
[46:08] surrendered them to the Lord Jesus
[46:12] Christ to win
[46:15] souls amen so when you are
[46:20] created you've got a
[46:25] talent all the those disciples had
[46:30] talents but what happens
[46:33] now on the day amen of Pentecost the
[46:39] Holy Spirit came and
[46:43] anointed and the
[46:45] talent so that the
[46:48] talent could win
[46:52] Soul you have a natural Talent
[46:57] and if you are a seed of
[46:59] God that Talent was
[47:03] purposed Amen to win s for
[47:06] Christ amen so every born individual is
[47:12] talented and will give account for the
[47:17] talent how he used
[47:21] it I'll explain this let's go to Exodus
[47:26] 31
[47:36] he says
[47:37] see I have called by name
[47:44] bz the son of
[47:47] Y the son
[47:49] of of the tribe of
[47:52] Judah I have called by name
[47:59] meaning that I have designated
[48:04] him a specific
[48:08] design in form of abilities and
[48:13] character that's the
[48:18] name and he called him
[48:21] Abraham to mean father of
[48:24] Nations that's the character that's in
[48:27] the
[48:30] name are you together with me so he's
[48:33] saying I I
[48:36] specifically designed
[48:40] bz and I placed a gift in
[48:45] him and verse
[48:47] three I have filled him with the spirit
[48:51] of
[48:53] God hallelujah hallelujah if you knew
[48:56] the
[48:58] gift of him that speakto
[49:02] you I would have given you living
[49:08] water and in the Living
[49:11] Water there is a
[49:14] talent in the Living Water there is a
[49:20] gift so the
[49:23] anointing the B of the Holy Ghost is not
[49:27] an idol
[49:30] anointing when you receive the Holy
[49:33] Ghost it anoints the gift in
[49:36] you to begin to
[49:40] minister according to your
[49:43] calling I have filled him with the
[49:45] spirit of
[49:46] God in
[49:49] wisdom so to you the spirit of God in
[49:55] works you see there is something in
[49:59] there and when you receive the holy
[50:02] ghost that seed is
[50:05] quickened to begin ministering to
[50:09] God in a designated
[50:12] way in the way God has called you to
[50:18] Ser are you together with me that's why
[50:23] sometimes listen to me I wonder
[50:27] that do
[50:28] people take time to listen to the
[50:34] message do people take
[50:37] time so I decided to say I'm going to
[50:41] walk through with the
[50:43] people just to borrow 15
[50:47] minutes of the
[50:49] morning and 15 minutes of the evening
[50:54] isn't that good friends
[50:57] yeah to
[50:59] ignite what God has placed on the
[51:05] C amen so I have filled him with the
[51:10] spirit of
[51:12] God in
[51:16] wisdom and in
[51:18] understanding and in knowledge and in
[51:22] all manner of workers
[51:27] that's why you young
[51:29] men you go to
[51:31] school but you must pray where is my
[51:35] name where's my
[51:38] gift sometimes you say the doctors get
[51:41] more
[51:43] money but your
[51:45] nature you are a
[51:47] mechanic you don't have sympathy with
[51:52] people you are going to deal with
[51:55] patients like you are dealing with
[52:02] metals because we are looking for where
[52:05] there is
[52:06] money and yet God has given you another
[52:11] fi and at the end of the day you can't
[52:15] have patience with people in
[52:18] pain and sister Susan
[52:21] can testify to
[52:24] this that the medical coun has disced
[52:34] him because he doesn't have that
[52:38] gift that's not where his name
[52:41] [Music]
[52:44] is God could have called
[52:46] you to do manual
[52:50] things maybe like
[52:53] B but you want some kind of a special
[52:56] office
[53:00] job and then you start
[53:02] saying this job is too D for
[53:07] me too D for
[53:15] me you see what I
[53:18] mean while you have got the
[53:21] ability naturally to study and go into
[53:24] every
[53:25] area if you are a son of God ask God
[53:30] where is my
[53:33] gift you see I have filled him with the
[53:36] gift of
[53:38] God and when this gift is put at
[53:42] work it brings to
[53:44] surface the nature and talent that's
[53:48] Endor in that
[53:52] person amen verse four for
[53:57] it was to Divine
[54:00] Works to work in go and silver and brass
[54:06] and in cutting of stone to set them and
[54:10] in carving of
[54:12] Timber work in all man of
[54:15] work you have something in you much as
[54:19] you may not be a ppit
[54:22] preacher much as you are not a ppit gift
[54:27] there is something on the inside of you
[54:30] that the Holy Spirit wants to
[54:34] annoy and why you receive the B of the
[54:39] Holy Ghost and he anoints that
[54:43] part that part makes you acceptable in
[54:46] the
[54:48] body because God
[54:50] himself will have a way for the
[54:54] gift and then you'll see what among the
[54:58] people and then you are doing things
[55:01] together with the people and there will
[55:03] be a happiness when you realize that you
[55:07] are a part of a
[55:10] church some people walk
[55:13] away from a local church not because the
[55:18] church is
[55:19] bad but they have failed to find their
[55:22] position if you knew who it was that is
[55:25] speaking to
[55:30] amen so again brother Bram says not many
[55:34] years
[55:35] ago you may have the gift but brother
[55:40] you need your
[55:42] time Amen to begin working into that
[55:47] gift Moses had a gift but he needed 40
[55:51] years to work himself into that
[55:54] gift are you together with me there are
[55:57] some people he gets a dream that I was
[56:01] preaching and tomorrow he wants to
[56:13] preach me and it's true it
[56:17] does but every gift has its
[56:22] position amen there are men who have
[56:25] started out
[56:27] here but they are not here anymore and
[56:30] they're using the gift and they still
[56:33] look back here because they've got
[56:36] something in them but then every gift
[56:40] finds his appropriate
[56:43] [Music]
[56:46] Place praise the
[56:48] Lord yeah not many years ago there was a
[56:53] man that believed he he had a
[56:57] talent to write comic
[57:01] [Music]
[57:04] strips
[57:11] amen he went the editor of a great paper
[57:15] in ar
[57:18] City and took some of his
[57:22] writings and the editor
[57:25] said sir you just haven't got
[57:31] it you there is need of you of
[57:37] trying there's no need of you
[57:40] trying you can't do it but that didn't
[57:43] satisfy
[57:45] him he knew he had
[57:48] it and he went back
[57:51] again and again trying but the edor
[57:55] would turn him down
[57:58] finally went to the other
[58:00] places and they turned him down saying
[58:04] Mister you just haven't got it you can't
[58:08] do it but yet he believed he got
[58:10] it and that's the way he's got something
[58:15] in his hand and that's the way he's got
[58:19] something in
[58:22] his finally got the
[58:25] job writing little
[58:28] scripts I believe for the
[58:32] editorial of for a
[58:34] church some sort of a little comic
[58:39] stream for the church and he rented
[58:42] himself a little rat M invested
[58:49] garage where the mice was running all
[58:52] over the place
[58:58] in his
[59:02] sheet and he got notice a pecularity of
[59:06] a certain little
[59:11] rat there is where the
[59:14] story of Mike house was
[59:19] born now it's a mount
[59:23] million Disneyland show
[59:30] he had something in his
[59:32] hand and he knew he had it he knew he
[59:36] could do it and that's the way every
[59:39] great achievement is
[59:42] made when men and women have something
[59:46] in their
[59:48] heart they know they can do
[59:50] it hallelujah hallelujah he went and
[59:54] brought and took this things to a
[59:57] man and the man says this is
[1:00:02] garbage he wrote again another one took
[1:00:06] it back to him he threw it in the
[1:00:09] D my friend you don't have the
[1:00:13] gift you can't do
[1:00:17] it and then he went to the
[1:00:20] church okay write something for our
[1:00:23] little
[1:00:24] kid and while he was out there doing the
[1:00:29] work of writing scripts for the
[1:00:32] church he couldn't afford a decent
[1:00:36] place there were RS all over the
[1:00:39] place and the
[1:00:43] inspiration and the
[1:00:45] gifted studed a certain
[1:00:51] R and he had
[1:00:54] ability to write something about that
[1:00:58] rat it is a gift and when he wrote it it
[1:01:03] became
[1:01:04] great and that's how we got the M uh uh
[1:01:09] house the Mi Mouse thing in the
[1:01:14] Disneyland in Florida out there that's
[1:01:17] the biggest thing that the people
[1:01:21] go amen everybody in the world who tells
[1:01:26] he has been to
[1:01:27] Disneyland you know that man has
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:33] money but you look at where it started
[1:01:38] from don't
[1:01:41] despise a little
[1:01:44] beginning when God has begun with
[1:01:48] you just give it time and see where God
[1:01:52] will
[1:01:54] take amen amen so gifts and callings are
[1:01:59] without
[1:02:03] repentance then those gifts
[1:02:06] come these are in you before
[1:02:10] birth and when you are born again they
[1:02:14] are
[1:02:15] anointed to be
[1:02:18] used in the building of the kingdom of
[1:02:22] God Amen gifts is God anointing your
[1:02:27] talent so that your talent could be used
[1:02:31] in the body of Christ that's a
[1:02:38] gift you understand that
[1:02:42] now so Ephesians chapter
[1:02:45] 4 and verse
[1:02:48] 7 I thank God this
[1:02:51] morning amen but unto every one of us
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:58] is given
[1:03:00] Grace according to the
[1:03:04] measure of the gift of
[1:03:08] Christ amen
[1:03:11] everybody has been
[1:03:14] given
[1:03:17] Grace according to the measure of the
[1:03:19] gift of
[1:03:22] Christ how much depth of spirit have you
[1:03:25] received
[1:03:28] and that
[1:03:29] determines the weight of
[1:03:33] gift that will be activated in that
[1:03:35] man's
[1:03:39] life amen when it comes to Ephesians 3:7
[1:03:46] here
[1:03:48] whereof I was made a minister
[1:03:55] according to the gift of the grace of
[1:04:00] God given unto me by the effectual
[1:04:05] working of his
[1:04:09] power so the gift of the grace of
[1:04:13] God is the spirit you
[1:04:18] receive if thou knowest the gift of
[1:04:22] God and who it is that says unto
[1:04:29] thee give me to
[1:04:35] train and I would give
[1:04:38] you living
[1:04:41] water and the content
[1:04:44] there is how
[1:04:47] God will thereafter use you
[1:04:56] you see if you don't find
[1:04:59] peace in the
[1:05:01] church then
[1:05:03] know who that man
[1:05:06] is that is telling you give me to
[1:05:11] drink when he gives you living
[1:05:14] water there and then you
[1:05:18] settle you find your
[1:05:20] position and you'll be happy being a son
[1:05:24] of God
[1:05:26] daughter of God among many
[1:05:30] brothers you are not going to be
[1:05:32] offended beyond
[1:05:35] measure if that comes even that one has
[1:05:39] a
[1:05:41] purpose amen yeah how could have David
[1:05:45] become
[1:05:46] king without Soul he needed soul to
[1:05:51] shape his
[1:05:53] character to become a king
[1:05:56] you see what I mean so it doesn't matter
[1:05:59] what
[1:06:01] happens even that is necessary for
[1:06:06] shaping your
[1:06:08] character in your
[1:06:10] gift amen so verse seven if we can go
[1:06:14] back
[1:06:15] to whereever he was made a
[1:06:19] minister according to the gift of the
[1:06:21] grace of
[1:06:23] God given unto me by the working of his
[1:06:28] power unto me who am less than the least
[1:06:33] of All
[1:06:36] Saints is this Grace
[1:06:40] given what Grace was that to preach
[1:06:44] among the
[1:06:47] Gentiles the unable Riches of
[1:06:50] Christ amen so the gift is given by Gra
[1:06:57] and places every
[1:07:00] individual in his position in
[1:07:02] Christ Paul could have gone to the
[1:07:06] Jews but he says no this gift here DS
[1:07:12] me Amen to the
[1:07:17] Gentile in the formative
[1:07:22] years when I was already established
[1:07:24] here
[1:07:26] I had friends who were telling me we we
[1:07:29] can help
[1:07:31] you to start some substantive
[1:07:38] work but I felt my calling was
[1:07:44] here I couldn't go
[1:07:47] anywhere I had the
[1:07:49] opportunity but I felt deep down in my
[1:07:54] heart that my position
[1:07:58] was you see Paul could have gone to the
[1:08:03] Jews but he says the grace I
[1:08:06] receive is to preach among the
[1:08:10] gentil god once he anoints a
[1:08:14] gift he gives it is appropriate
[1:08:20] place do you love him the gift is given
[1:08:24] by grace
[1:08:26] amen and it helps a
[1:08:29] person to be a mean to find his position
[1:08:32] in
[1:08:33] Christ and that gift is Christ building
[1:08:39] back the
[1:08:41] kingdom
[1:08:43] amen so in this
[1:08:46] manner God gives
[1:08:51] himself as the gift of God
[1:08:55] to reestablish the
[1:08:58] kingdom that had fallen by
[1:09:01] sin I will repeat that God gives himself
[1:09:07] as a
[1:09:09] gift to the
[1:09:11] people so that the gift which is Christ
[1:09:17] in the people could
[1:09:19] reestablish the kingdom that fell by S
[1:09:25] amen that's the
[1:09:28] Revelation he was trying to give the
[1:09:30] woman at the
[1:09:32] well he was telling her I am the gift of
[1:09:38] God I am the wisdom of
[1:09:41] God I am the life of
[1:09:44] God I give myself to you as the BM of
[1:09:48] the Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost without
[1:09:52] money without price
[1:09:59] if you
[1:10:00] knew the
[1:10:03] gift we are getting a little into the
[1:10:05] depth of it
[1:10:08] now let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:10:12] 22 I took you through the end of the
[1:10:20] Covenant and I took the Lord said unto
[1:10:23] my Lord
[1:10:25] amen so that you may really be able to
[1:10:29] understand the way God works with
[1:10:32] us build out of us a
[1:10:36] kingom Matthew
[1:10:39] 22:41 while the Pharisees were gathered
[1:10:45] together Jesus asked
[1:10:48] them and you know Jesus was
[1:10:51] good he knew they believe scripture
[1:10:55] so you would tie
[1:10:57] them in the
[1:10:59] scripture if we say this they will say
[1:11:03] that if we say this they say that they
[1:11:06] keep
[1:11:07] quiet when they keep quiet then it
[1:11:12] teaches isn't that
[1:11:15] wonderful Jesus asked
[1:11:17] them
[1:11:19] say what think ye of
[1:11:23] Christ who son is
[1:11:27] he they say unto him the son of
[1:11:32] David you are
[1:11:34] coming he says unto them how then does
[1:11:39] David in spirit call him
[1:11:44] Lord amen saying the Lord said unto my
[1:11:49] Lord sit thou on my right
[1:11:53] hand till I make thine enemy is thy foot
[1:11:57] to if David then call him
[1:12:01] Lord how is
[1:12:04] son amen and no man was able to
[1:12:10] answer does any man from that day ask
[1:12:17] him
[1:12:20] questions ah uhhuh they says uhh uhh uh
[1:12:25] this man can tell you in the
[1:12:28] scriptures so we are trying to
[1:12:32] understand if you
[1:12:35] knew who the man that speak of
[1:12:39] you if you knew the gift of
[1:12:43] God so now David I mean Christ asks them
[1:12:48] who was Christ speaking of who who is
[1:12:53] Christ
[1:12:55] know he takes them into you know who is
[1:12:58] the son of
[1:13:00] David then says then how can he be son
[1:13:04] when he
[1:13:06] Lord he tied
[1:13:08] them amen
[1:13:13] so you know how then does David in the
[1:13:16] spirit call him
[1:13:18] Lord because they
[1:13:20] said Christ would be a son of David
[1:13:28] says okay Christ would be a son of
[1:13:32] David but why would David in the spirit
[1:13:37] call him
[1:13:38] Lord the Lord say down to my
[1:13:43] Lord sit down at my right
[1:13:47] hand till I make all your
[1:13:52] enemies your foottoo
[1:13:55] so son of
[1:13:58] David must be a figure of
[1:14:02] speech defining Christ
[1:14:06] service in bringing the kingdom of his
[1:14:11] father into physical
[1:14:15] existence so if you
[1:14:19] know I want you I don't know how I can
[1:14:22] say this
[1:14:25] David I mean son of
[1:14:27] David is an
[1:14:33] office
[1:14:34] amen it Christ was going to step
[1:14:40] into to make
[1:14:44] possible the
[1:14:47] restoration of the
[1:14:50] kingdom is God and
[1:14:57] David
[1:14:59] looked and saw the
[1:15:02] Lord the Glorious
[1:15:05] logos take on the B of
[1:15:08] Flesh to become the gift of
[1:15:12] God that defeats the
[1:15:14] enemy amen he stood out in the
[1:15:19] spirit and he saw the
[1:15:23] Lord taking on
[1:15:25] body are you together with me so a clear
[1:15:30] observation by
[1:15:32] David is that why God took another
[1:15:37] office he would still return the same
[1:15:41] Glory he would still retain the same
[1:15:45] power so David was looking at two
[1:15:49] distinctive
[1:15:51] offices and two distinctive
[1:15:53] manifestations
[1:15:56] but not two
[1:16:00] personalities okay so the sun came
[1:16:04] down as the visible expression of the
[1:16:08] father all that the father
[1:16:11] was was poured into the
[1:16:14] Sun so that's why he says if you
[1:16:20] knew that you are standing before God
[1:16:25] if you knew that you are standing in
[1:16:28] front of your
[1:16:30] creator if you knew that you are
[1:16:33] standing before a man who can change
[1:16:38] you but the woman was looking at a
[1:16:43] veil let's take the words of David
[1:16:46] himself Psalms
[1:16:49] 110 verse
[1:16:52] one a of the
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:56] the Lord said unto my
[1:16:59] Lord sit thou at my right
[1:17:04] hand until I make th enemies thy foood
[1:17:10] to so here David Sees
[1:17:14] God
[1:17:16] condescending and taking on a Redemptive
[1:17:22] nature in the form of men
[1:17:25] but yet still the almighty
[1:17:27] God Amen verse two the Lord said I the
[1:17:33] Lord shall
[1:17:35] send the road of thy strength out of
[1:17:41] Zion rule thou in the midst of th
[1:17:46] enemies
[1:17:50] verse thy
[1:17:52] people shall be willing in the day your
[1:17:55] power of th
[1:17:58] power and in the beauties of Holiness
[1:18:00] from the womb of the
[1:18:21] morning thou Hast the due of the youth
[1:18:28] the Lord
[1:18:32] has and will not
[1:18:35] repent thou art a priest
[1:18:41] forever over the
[1:18:44] of the Lord at thy right
[1:18:47] hand shall strike the I mean through
[1:18:50] kings in the day of his Wrath
[1:18:56] so
[1:18:57] God in the Jesus
[1:19:00] body he is seen as the angel of the
[1:19:06] Covenant
[1:19:07] M becoming his own
[1:19:12] servant in a borrowed
[1:19:15] body of the man
[1:19:20] Jesus so M had come down into body
[1:19:27] the
[1:19:27] woman was blind those great
[1:19:33] facts but she was
[1:19:35] turning first to
[1:19:38] First amen with the prophecy of
[1:19:42] David and that's the gift of
[1:19:46] God Amen so now in this body he fulfills
[1:19:52] Hebrews 73
[1:19:56] saying without father without mother
[1:20:01] without desent having neither beginning
[1:20:05] of
[1:20:06] days no end of
[1:20:09] life hallelujah hallelujah that
[1:20:14] amen hallelujah hallelujah made like the
[1:20:17] Son of
[1:20:19] God he says
[1:20:22] actually he is that one
[1:20:26] that is without father without mother
[1:20:30] without desent having no beginning of
[1:20:34] days having the end of
[1:20:38] life amen he was only
[1:20:42] man like the Son of God he was only man
[1:20:48] in the body of Flesh to abide as a
[1:20:51] priest Contin
[1:20:57] amen so brother Bram
[1:21:00] says who was
[1:21:03] it readers Bible
[1:21:06] scholars what was it lead the children
[1:21:09] out of
[1:21:11] Egypt it was the Ang of the
[1:21:15] Covenant who is the Ang of the
[1:21:17] Covenant Jesus Christ who was a pill of
[1:21:21] fire this is what the woman didn't know
[1:21:25] he was saying if you
[1:21:30] knew he stood here on Earth and he said
[1:21:34] I come from God I go back to God he came
[1:21:40] here was manifested in flesh he went
[1:21:44] back to the light
[1:21:48] again but the end of the
[1:21:51] Covenant that makes all things
[1:21:55] this woman had struggled with her
[1:21:57] life one H one man a second man a third
[1:22:02] man six month until he met the seven
[1:22:07] Hallelujah the seven had to deal with
[1:22:11] the inner person in order to redeem the
[1:22:14] outer woman are you together with me he
[1:22:18] says if only you knew and when she
[1:22:22] broke into that re
[1:22:25] and who knew it was she was given
[1:22:30] Waters of living I mean she was given
[1:22:32] living
[1:22:33] waterers hallelujah hallelujah she was
[1:22:37] given water on the inside she C the
[1:22:42] revelation of who this Messiah is and
[1:22:45] brother it changed her
[1:22:49] life amen oh hallelujah hallelujah she
[1:22:53] washed off all the
[1:22:56] she took that kind of
[1:22:59] L which was supposed to be used to car
[1:23:02] the
[1:23:03] water she wrapped around her
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:07] Min she could not walk that
[1:23:11] way she broke into
[1:23:13] Revelation and the Revelation took
[1:23:16] control her she went into the City and
[1:23:20] the city knew her very well and they
[1:23:23] started to wonder
[1:23:25] what has happened with the eyelid pencil
[1:23:28] is not there the lipstick is not there
[1:23:32] the short dress is not there is she the
[1:23:36] one is she the
[1:23:40] one and then she would say yes but I've
[1:23:44] got a revelation I stood in front of the

[1:24:16] revelation of that gift it makes you a

[1:24:28] is the end of the coven who comes down
[1:24:32] to make things
[1:24:34] possible she did not know that she was
[1:24:37] standing before the one who had no
[1:24:40] father and but only given a body through
[1:24:44] the birth of a woman to come and testify
[1:24:48] she did not know that she was turning
[1:24:51] before

[1:25:20] guide and the
[1:25:22] purpose each time that Angel of the Lord

[1:25:26] down who was to help
[1:25:30] Israel to get into the
[1:25:33] prop and to remain in the
[1:25:36] prop you see so to Israel on the
[1:25:42] journey he manifested as a pill of
[1:25:45] fire and he L

[1:28:50] God are you together with me if you can
[1:28:53] recognize the gift
[1:28:55] of it's not
[1:28:58] knowledge that gives these
[1:29:01] things if you can only know the gift of
[1:29:07] God if it's
[1:29:10] knowledge everybody would do
[1:29:12] it but if you can know the gift of
[1:29:18] God that's what
[1:29:22] matters you don't before a man you don't
[1:29:26] stand before a Jew you stand before the
[1:29:29] gift of

[1:29:39] Lord God Pur to establish a Divine
[1:29:44] Kingdom amen and stretched
[1:29:48] forth the hand of
[1:29:51] Jesus Amen the son of David
[1:29:55] amen listen here questions and
[1:29:59] answers God unfolding himself down to
[1:30:02] human
[1:30:04] being Now watch how did it
[1:30:08] do how he did it now that's the Son of
[1:30:14] God the
[1:30:16] logos now I can see him playing
[1:30:20] around like a child before the father's
[1:30:23] door
[1:30:26] with all
[1:30:27] eternity and now then in his
[1:30:38] imagin he begin to think of what things
[1:30:42] should
[1:30:45] be and I can hear him say let there be
[1:30:50] life hallelujah hallelujah when did he
[1:30:53] create
[1:30:55] he
[1:30:56] created when he condescended from
[1:31:01] Elohim and he came down into the
[1:31:03] logos and the logos was the
[1:31:09] sunship was God taking a spirit
[1:31:14] body and in that Spirit
[1:31:18] body he creates all
[1:31:21] things and all things he creat
[1:31:25] were created by
[1:31:27] Him and for
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:30] him he's not creating for another higher
[1:31:36] God because that God just
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:41] took and he stepped into that body and
[1:31:45] he says this is the
[1:31:47] son amen so Colossians 1116
[1:31:54] him were all things
[1:31:56] created all things were created by Him
[1:31:58] and for
[1:32:00] him so he
[1:32:03] condescended before he could
[1:32:05] create and it SE this same
[1:32:09] concept of the condesending
[1:32:13] God that he takes another
[1:32:16] step to create himself a
[1:32:19] body of
[1:32:22] Flesh for the
[1:32:24] of
[1:32:25] s and in that body he steps out before
[1:32:30] this
[1:32:31] woman if you knew the
[1:32:35] gift if you knew the
[1:32:37] gift and the woman doesn't
[1:32:40] know that she's so honored that the same
[1:32:44] one who created the heavens and earth
[1:32:47] who came down in the body of Jesus is
[1:32:51] standing before
[1:32:55] he had the
[1:32:56] power to dissolve that
[1:33:01] woman he had the power to force her to
[1:33:07] change God doesn't work like
[1:33:13] that if you
[1:33:15] knew he wants you to come to a
[1:33:19] point of
[1:33:21] knowing and submitting
[1:33:24] will you come to that
[1:33:26] level he's God he can do something that
[1:33:30] you can never be what you've never been
[1:33:33] you've always
[1:33:35] been amen but no he wants your
[1:33:40] participation
[1:33:46] you so the man was standing right there
[1:33:51] and God LA from this angle
[1:33:54] to that angle talking about the man and
[1:33:58] everything until breaks
[1:34:01] through and you said brother Steven why
[1:34:04] do you preach for two hours God is liing
[1:34:08] some somewhere here somewhere there
[1:34:12] somewhere there somehow he breaks
[1:34:14] through b and gets to the
[1:34:18] point he says I
[1:34:21] perceive you are that prophet
[1:34:26] will God break towards us
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] today if you knew the
[1:34:31] gift it will change your
[1:34:33] life when the woman knew the
[1:34:36] gift it changed her life amen notice God
[1:34:42] has had three fold purpose in this great
[1:34:45] mystery
[1:34:48] secret amen that yet before the
[1:34:52] world the first thing was that God
[1:34:55] wanted to reveal himself to the people
[1:34:59] to reveal himself in
[1:35:02] Christ therefore he blessed his name in
[1:35:06] Christ and Christ became the express
[1:35:09] image of
[1:35:11] Jehovah with the
[1:35:13] purpose of bringing everything under his
[1:35:18] control so the second purpose was to
[1:35:22] have preeminence in his book of
[1:35:26] believer that is the bride and he might
[1:35:29] live in the
[1:35:31] people so revealed to the
[1:35:35] woman then stepping down into the
[1:35:40] woman that the Life of
[1:35:43] Christ may take over the life of the
[1:35:46] Bride are you together with me all that
[1:35:50] Christ
[1:35:51] was he pours into the church
[1:35:54] and today the church is the anointed
[1:35:59] Christ here on Earth brother Bram then
[1:36:04] says when I think of
[1:36:09] it that the
[1:36:11] church is the anointed
[1:36:14] Christ here on Earth when I think of
[1:36:19] it I just denominations pass off
[1:36:24] the sin and everything else just
[1:36:28] going when I see God's gra
[1:36:33] purpose revealing
[1:36:35] himself the fullness of the god and
[1:36:39] body and then to bring the fullness of
[1:36:41] the godhead
[1:36:44] bod into people that you could have the
[1:36:48] pinenes the
[1:36:51] oversight the leading
[1:36:54] there he is working
[1:36:57] back amen his glory to
[1:37:00] man Hallelujah huj that's why he was
[1:37:04] Liber that woman of John 4 represents
[1:37:10] you Hallelujah to the point where you
[1:37:14] recognize who you are before
[1:37:20] God I would give you living water
[1:37:24] and out of you shall flow rivers of
[1:37:27] Living
[1:37:30] Water and I've told you as the waters
[1:37:35] flow it doesn't flow empty
[1:37:38] water that Waters anoints
[1:37:43] your
[1:37:46] talent anoints the
[1:37:48] gift that God has placed on the side of
[1:37:52] you so
[1:37:54] flowing out of you is God beginning to
[1:38:00] use you as the anointed
[1:38:06] Christ that's why we should not avoid
[1:38:10] the assembling of ourselves
[1:38:12] together you come and shake the hand of
[1:38:15] the brother and it tells you go bless
[1:38:17] you if he has got that right Spirit on
[1:38:20] there you have taken a blessing
[1:38:25] amen they lay hands on the
[1:38:28] sick and they shall recover even doesn't
[1:38:32] know that you are sick but in there the
[1:38:37] gift of healing he say God bless you you
[1:38:41] are going to be well he hasn't prayed
[1:38:44] for you
[1:38:46] hands amen and you receive that's why we
[1:38:51] should be a CH
[1:38:53] and flock together because everybody has
[1:38:57] got a talent to build the kingdom of
[1:39:03] God Amen see that's the threefold
[1:39:07] mystery he comes to reveal himself to
[1:39:10] the woman and then steps into the life
[1:39:14] of that woman is Living Water the B of
[1:39:18] the
[1:39:19] Holy amen and he says and thirdly
[1:39:24] to rest the kingdom twist right
[1:39:27] position that fell by
[1:39:29] sin by the first Adam back to where he
[1:39:33] walked in the cool of the
[1:39:35] even with these people talked with them
[1:39:40] fellowship with them so the assignment
[1:39:42] of the
[1:39:43] son is to bring all the
[1:39:46] enemies under his feet and then
[1:39:49] establish the Kingdom of
[1:39:52] Heaven amen
[1:39:54] so the Bible teaches about two
[1:39:57] kingdoms the kingdom of God and the
[1:40:01] kingdom of heaven the kingdom of God is
[1:40:05] the present time where you
[1:40:07] are where out of you flows the rivers of
[1:40:11] Living
[1:40:13] Water amen Luke chapter
[1:40:17] 17 20 to
[1:40:19] 21 the kingdom of God the Holy Ghost
[1:40:23] ghost in you the Living Water amen so
[1:40:27] the B of the holy ghost in a
[1:40:31] Believer is the kingdom of God but as
[1:40:34] the kingdom of God grows in the church
[1:40:38] body amen it builds
[1:40:41] itself into the kingdom of
[1:40:44] heaven and when the last elected
[1:40:47] one has come to that
[1:40:51] Perfection then the kingdom of God
[1:40:54] becomes the Kingdom of
[1:40:56] Heaven Jesus comes and takes his church
[1:41:01] home amen there is an important Point
[1:41:05] here the Holy Ghost drops into your
[1:41:09] life on the
[1:41:11] principle of a growing Master
[1:41:15] seed and it grows in the life of a
[1:41:20] Believer amen crowding all the canal
[1:41:25] out so when that
[1:41:30] comes it is not a
[1:41:33] flood no it's a mastered
[1:41:37] seat something comes
[1:41:40] true and then drops at the center of
[1:41:43] your
[1:41:48] life and it begins to grow
[1:41:53] so that's what he was
[1:41:55] asking to that
[1:41:57] woman why can't you break into the
[1:42:02] revelation of who is talking to his gift
[1:42:08] of
[1:42:09] God coming to you he want
[1:42:16] sucess so brother Bram says when a man
[1:42:19] is
[1:42:20] saved that much of him is God that much
[1:42:23] of him is
[1:42:25] God that's the little
[1:42:28] light that comes in to make you
[1:42:32] quit doing what's wrong that little
[1:42:36] button like a
[1:42:38] light and power of God will keep growing
[1:42:43] growing growing cring out
[1:42:47] unel so when The Parables of the two
[1:42:50] kingdoms
[1:42:53] as spoken in the
[1:42:55] Bible they have one common
[1:42:58] element it's growth because it's the
[1:43:01] same
[1:43:03] life
[1:43:06] amen if you
[1:43:10] knew oh there was a
[1:43:12] mystery standing in front of
[1:43:15] that but today there is a revelation
[1:43:19] standing before you take it
[1:43:23] amen it's not a mystery anymore it's a
[1:43:27] revelation that stands before you Christ
[1:43:31] is the Myster of God
[1:43:34] revealed amen it's no longer a mystery
[1:43:37] it's revealed to you you either take it
[1:43:40] or reject
[1:43:42] it
[1:43:43] amen so Mark
[1:43:48] 4:26 let us look at the element
[1:43:54] of the Kingdom of
[1:43:56] Heaven and the kingdom of God they've
[1:43:59] got a common element in
[1:44:02] them it's
[1:44:05] growth when the B of the Holy
[1:44:08] Ghost drops in the life of one
[1:44:11] individual it keeps growing growing
[1:44:16] growing it's the same way that you know
[1:44:20] all of us together
[1:44:23] we are having the growth of the Holy
[1:44:25] Ghost to bring forth a
[1:44:28] kingdom amen so Mark
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:32] 4:26 and he says so the kingdom of
[1:44:36] God as if a man should cast a seed into
[1:44:39] the
[1:44:41] ground so the kingdom of God grow you
[1:44:45] cast a seed on the ground because you
[1:44:48] want this
[1:44:50] SE to mature and so once it matures it
[1:44:55] grows into the Kingdom of
[1:44:58] Heaven
[1:45:01] 13:31 another Parable put forth unto
[1:45:05] them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:45:08] like a grain of mustard
[1:45:10] seed which a man took and sold in his
[1:45:15] field meaning a true I mean true
[1:45:19] birth it grows now in Daniel
[1:45:24] chapter
[1:45:25] 2 verse 31 through
[1:45:28] 35 we see a progressive
[1:45:32] growth of the kingdoms of this
[1:45:35] world as depicted by image of
[1:45:40] Nebuchadnezzar are you together with me
[1:45:43] it was
[1:45:44] growing amen so and Babylon the head of
[1:45:50] God
[1:45:53] was the
[1:45:54] peak amen of that
[1:45:57] Kingdom but then we see a
[1:46:00] stone which was cut without
[1:46:03] hands and Christ is the
[1:46:05] stone that was cast without cut
[1:46:09] without amen that will finally build
[1:46:14] himself into great Kingdom so God has
[1:46:19] purpose to have the Kingdom on the prin
[1:46:22] of Jehovah
[1:46:25] God who dwells with his
[1:46:28] family amen so he determined to have a
[1:46:33] kingdom and I want you to look at that
[1:46:36] woman at looking at the
[1:46:40] bride
[1:46:42] amen the first husband the second
[1:46:47] husband the sixth husband but the
[1:46:50] seventh changes the situation
[1:46:54] are you together with me he changes the
[1:46:58] situation he says do you know who I
[1:47:01] am amen when she broke
[1:47:04] forth that was enough she had found
[1:47:09] somebody amen who was going to be so
[1:47:12] meaningful to
[1:47:14] her amen he isn't now he says he is in
[1:47:19] self-existence anymore
[1:47:23] exist with his
[1:47:24] family
[1:47:26] Elohim now is
[1:47:28] Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who ex
[1:47:32] his family so now the kingdom of God
[1:47:36] will change from an
[1:47:38] individual family from the kingdom of
[1:47:41] God to the kingdom of heaven are you
[1:47:45] together with me which is going to be a
[1:47:47] whole
[1:47:49] group of the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:52] Christ
[1:47:53] not governed from
[1:47:56] outside not governed from
[1:47:59] away you know he's going to come
[1:48:02] down and take his PR live with her
[1:48:07] praise God there was a desire of God to
[1:48:11] be
[1:48:12] prominent and fellowship so it was
[1:48:16] coming Progressive
[1:48:18] LEL he has purposed to work his bride
[1:48:24] back into the
[1:48:28] area before the
[1:48:31] fall where God would
[1:48:34] come and say
[1:48:36] hi and they
[1:48:38] say they are not going to know him by
[1:48:42] Vision no sir we are not going to hear
[1:48:46] him by a voice no sir it will be
[1:48:51] Fellowship
[1:48:54] we shall be
[1:48:56] together are you together with me it's
[1:48:59] going to be totally
[1:49:01] different so
[1:49:04] Jesus to make this
[1:49:08] woman who he was if you
[1:49:13] knew I
[1:49:15] today if you knew who the gift of God
[1:49:20] is amen the Lord Jesus Christ always
[1:49:25] knocking at your door always seeking for
[1:49:29] Fellowship the one who is
[1:49:31] growing into your life if you know him
[1:49:36] it will change everything in our
[1:49:40] lives I wish I had the
[1:49:43] language to express what I
[1:49:47] feel amen praise the Lord do you love
[1:49:52] him
