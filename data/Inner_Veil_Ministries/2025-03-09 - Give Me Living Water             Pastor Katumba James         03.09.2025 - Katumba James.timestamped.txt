[0:31] yourselves Lord. Come and take Lord
[0:33] Jesus Christ our sacrifice and come and
[0:36] Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:38] Cleanse Father and clear our throats
[0:41] Lord that we may sing praises unto our
[0:43] King Lord. We thank you Jesus. You've
[0:46] given us voices to sing unto you. You've
[0:48] given us hands to clap for you Lord. And
[0:50] you've given you've given us eyes Lord
[0:53] to look in the word and to look in the
[0:55] middle of the word to see Lord Jesus how
[0:58] far we've come and what stain is
[1:00] remaining upon us as you say come and
[1:03] reason with that with me Lord Jesus
[1:06] today we come Lord in humility in
[1:08] humbleness Lord that Lord Jesus we may
[1:11] have that mind which was in Christ Jesus
[1:14] that we may take away Father our own
[1:16] thinking and ideas Lord may you Lord
[1:19] Jesus Christ. Forgive us, oh God, our
[1:22] trespasses. May you forgive us, Lord,
[1:24] our shortcoming. May you forgive us,
[1:26] Lord, that weakness, Lord, the besetting
[1:30] sins, oh God, which hinders, Lord, the
[1:33] flow, the free flow of the Holy Spirit
[1:35] in us, Lord. We thank you, Jesus,
[1:37] because the desire of God is to see that
[1:40] he moves in the church, is to see that
[1:42] he moves in the bride. Lord, we thank
[1:44] you, Jesus. May you take us into the
[1:46] presence, Lord. That we may be like
[1:48] Elijah, Lord, who was moved by the Holy
[1:51] Ghost, Lord, that we may be like

[1:56] the Holy Ghost, Lord. And Lord Jesus,
[1:58] may you inspire the minister, Lord, and
[2:01] inspire us, Lord, that you may hear from
[2:03] the spirit. Oh, hallelujah. We give you
[2:06] glory, Lord Jesus. Thou art worthy to be
[2:09] praised, oh God. Oh, hallelujah.

[17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet in the name of our Lord
[17:38] Jesus Christ.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; On Sunday, we are going to have two
[17:42] services.
[17:45] We have the Lord's supper as well.
[17:49] Praise the name of our Lord. So, let us
[17:51] go to John chapter 4.
[17:54] We're reading from verse 10 to verse 15.
[17:59] [Music]
[18:02] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says
[18:05] [Music]
[18:06] Jesus answered and said unto her, "If
[18:09] thou knowest the gift of God, and who it
[18:12] is that says to thee, give me to drink,
[18:16] thou would have asked of him, and he
[18:19] would have given thee living water."
[18:31] [Music]
[18:35] The woman says unto him, "Sir, thou hast
[18:38] nothing to draw with, and the well is
[18:42] deep, from when
[18:44] that living water,
[18:50] [Music]
[18:55] and thou greater than our father Jacob,
[18:58] which gave us the well, and drank there
[19:00] of himself and his children and his
[19:03] cattle.
[19:09] [Music]
[19:15] Jesus answered and said unto her,
[19:17] "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall
[19:21] thirst again.
[19:32] shall give him shall never thirst. But
[19:35] the water that I shall give him shall be
[19:38] in him a well of water springing up into
[19:42] everlasting life.
[19:54] [Music]
[20:05] The woman says unto him, "Sir, give me
[20:08] this water that I thirst not, neither
[20:11] come to draw.
[20:19] [Music]
[20:21] May God sing of his word. You may be
[20:23] seen.
[20:24] So I want to take our subject
[20:28] from verse 15
[20:32] where the woman said unto Jesus,
[20:37] give me this water that I thirst not,
[20:40] neither come hither to draw.
[20:46] So I'm talking about give me living
[20:49] water.
[20:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Give me
[20:54] living water.
[20:57] So we see that the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:01] identified himself
[21:04] as the living water.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He
[21:10] expressed to this woman
[21:13] that this water you've come to draw from
[21:15] the well.
[21:18] You are going to come go back and then
[21:21] come back. You're going to thirst.
[21:24] You're not going to get satisfaction
[21:26] from this well.
[21:28] But then he said, "But the water that I
[21:31] give,
[21:34] it springs up into eternal life.
[21:39] And it's a water where you thirst for
[21:42] nothing else.
[21:46] And he said, you know, in you, you
[21:47] become a well of water.
[21:52] And then the woman said,
[21:54] give me this water.
[21:57] Praise the name of our Lord. And each of
[21:59] us, we've been given that privilege
[22:04] that we can drink of that water.
[22:08] And you know, it should be something
[22:10] that you desire so much.
[22:14] You know that you desire it,
[22:17] you know, to come down in your life.
[22:21] Now in the message thirsting for life,
[22:25] brotherham says and notice
[22:29] here is where David got it.
[22:33] Now my hunter brother in here
[22:38] [Music]
[22:39] the one
[22:43] you know this
[22:45] that little deer
[22:49] Yeah. bleeding
[22:53] like that.
[22:55] That has got to get to water.
[23:00] I've wounded them myself,
[23:05] shot them,
[23:07] and shot them high or low
[23:12] and watch them.
[23:15] If he ever gets to water,
[23:19] you will never get him.
[23:23] He will just keep on crossing back and
[23:26] forth.
[23:30] He will never leave that water.
[23:36] He will just keep going back and forth.
[23:40] And you wouldn't get him if you had to.
[23:46] As long as he could stop and get a good
[23:49] drink,
[23:50] [Music]
[23:53] take off across the hill
[23:56] and come back right back
[24:00] and double itself back
[24:03] and then you could track him all the day
[24:05] long
[24:11] as long as he can find water.
[24:15] He will stay alive
[24:18] but keep him away from the water
[24:23] he will die. So now he's talking about
[24:26] this animal
[24:28] that when you shoot it
[24:31] you know the the life
[24:34] is to look for where the water is
[24:38] and as long as that animal can find
[24:41] water
[24:43] and its life is saved.
[24:47] But then if it can't find water,
[24:50] then it's going to die.
[24:53] So like now this animal when it gets
[24:56] where water is
[24:58] it drinks a lot,
[25:02] maybe running around like that
[25:05] and then it comes back the same spot
[25:07] where it got the water.
[25:10] In other words, without the water,
[25:14] you cannot live.
[25:16] And then now he says,
[25:19] "And David said,
[25:22] as the heart thirsts for the water,
[25:27] [Music]
[25:34] my souls after thee, oh God.
[25:41] I must find him or I will perish.
[25:48] I have been wounded
[25:50] and I must find the waters of life
[25:56] or I will perish.
[25:58] God, I have joined churches.
[26:03] I've jumped from this and that
[26:07] from this to the other.
[26:13] But if you don't find the waters of
[26:16] life,
[26:19] you will perish.
[26:21] But once get into that water,
[26:25] he is there.
[26:27] He will stay
[26:30] where there is a fountain of life.
[26:35] flowing freely tonight
[26:39] in the house of David
[26:41] in the city of God.
[26:44] All people rush,
[26:48] hunger,
[26:49] thirst. Blessed are they that hunger and
[26:52] thirst for righteousness.
[26:57] They shall be filled.
[27:00] Then he says,
[27:01] &gt;&gt; see they go to it. If you are wounded
[27:05] tonight,
[27:07] if the devil has took a chunk out of
[27:10] you,
[27:16] you are thirsting.
[27:19] What can I do? Brother, brother,
[27:23] just come to Jesus Christ.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now we have
[27:29] the fountain of water
[27:32] that has been open to us.
[27:35] The fountain of living water.
[27:39] So in anything
[27:42] you need to know that without Christ in
[27:44] my life.
[27:48] I am completely a failure.
[27:51] Praise the name of our Lord. We each
[27:54] need to recognize that
[27:56] that Jesus Christ
[27:59] &gt;&gt; is the fountain of life
[28:02] &gt;&gt; is the source of life.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; The life that we were born with from our
[28:07] parents
[28:10] [Music]
[28:11] is very temporary.
[28:15] It has death in it.
[28:17] It has frustrations in it.
[28:24] It has failures in it. It has sickness
[28:28] in it. It has troubles in it. That's our
[28:32] first life we get on earth.
[28:35] Natural birth. The first life that you
[28:38] get.
[28:39] And the Bible says a man that is born of
[28:43] a woman
[28:46] is of a few days.
[28:49] That's what the scripture says because
[28:51] it has frustrations.
[28:54] You know, it doesn't matter how great
[28:57] achievements one can get.
[29:03] You know, you at the end of the day find
[29:05] it all comes to nothing.
[29:10] Praise the name of the Lord.
[29:12] Like I was reading yesterday that this
[29:15] morning or yesterday
[29:18] how they are saying that Britain
[29:23] will need to borrow a lot of money
[29:28] for its economy to be revived. If not
[29:31] everything is collapsing
[29:35] and then you look at a big country like
[29:37] Britain,
[29:39] it is such a crisis
[29:43] and then they were talking about how how
[29:45] tens of thousands of million years
[29:56] leaving Britain
[29:58] going to another country.
[30:01] And then you start wondering
[30:04] every country would want to be like
[30:05] those countries.
[30:08] But then at the end of the day they are
[30:09] finding they have a lot of troubles
[30:10] among them
[30:13] showing us that the things of this life
[30:17] very temporary.
[30:20] Praise the name of our Lord. A limit.
[30:24] They may not be able to take you too
[30:26] far.
[30:28] The life itself is temporary.
[30:32] You know the achievements are temporary.
[30:35] There is failure in all these kind of
[30:37] things.
[30:39] That's why we need the fountain of
[30:42] living water.
[30:45] Christ who is our life. Now in
[30:49] Colossians chapter 3,
[30:52] the Bible says in verse 4,
[30:59] He says when Christ
[31:03] who is our life
[31:06] shall appear
[31:09] then shall you also appear with him in
[31:11] glory.
[31:15] So then we need to make an effort.
[31:19] We need to see that each of us is
[31:21] serious.
[31:24] That Christ is your personal life.
[31:30] You have no other life
[31:32] other than Christ himself living in you.
[31:36] Now look what this woman at the well.
[31:40] You know, she came to draw the water
[31:44] and she came at midday
[31:47] because in the cultures there
[31:50] concerning her morals,
[31:54] she wouldn't be allowed to mix with
[31:56] other women.
[31:59] So now Jesus knew there is somebody I
[32:01] have to talk to at this time.
[32:04] So he goes to the well
[32:07] and he waits for her there.
[32:10] while the disciples went to town to buy
[32:12] some food.
[32:14] And now when she comes to draw water,
[32:17] he tells her, "Give me something to
[32:20] drink."
[32:22] And normally when God comes our way,
[32:27] he always wants to start with what you
[32:29] are doing
[32:32] your attention.
[32:34] When Jesus met Peter and Andrew,
[32:40] They were fishing.
[32:42] So he started with them the language of
[32:43] fishermen.
[32:47] Get their attention.
[32:49] This woman came to the well to draw
[32:51] water.
[32:53] So even Jesus started by that mind she
[32:56] had
[32:59] me to drink something.
[33:02] And then she say but you you you are a
[33:05] Jew Samaritan. We have no dealings.
[33:10] And then Jesus told her, "If you knew
[33:13] the gift of God before you,
[33:17] you would ask me of living water."
[33:21] Then she started asking him, "What do
[33:23] you mean? You don't have anything to
[33:26] draw.
[33:28] Now you're telling me that you can give
[33:29] me water?
[33:31] Are you greater than Jacob our father?"
[33:35] Now when brother Brennham teaches us
[33:39] that he was catching her spirit
[33:43] you know to know the condition of her
[33:45] life
[33:48] and you know that everybody that comes
[33:50] in the presence of God.
[33:53] He God would always want to calm you
[33:56] down.
[33:59] He always want you to come down.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[34:04] The angel came to Mary,
[34:07] fear not.
[34:09] It didn't just start a shouting much.
[34:13] And then now you see some of these
[34:15] people on television
[34:17] when people come to them are already
[34:19] shaking.
[34:22] God doesn't work like that.
[34:25] Praise the name of our Lord. He comes in
[34:27] a situation where you can understand
[34:29] what he's saying.
[34:33] Job, stand up like a man and I speak to
[34:35] you.
[34:39] He wants to take your attention.
[34:42] And so Jesus had to speak on the water
[34:45] she had come to draw
[34:50] to get attention
[34:52] to help her. Praise the name of our
[34:55] Lord. So now Jesus said, if you knew the
[34:59] gift of God,
[35:01] you ask me of living water.
[35:04] Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord
[35:07] Jesus tells that the water that I give,
[35:11] you will not need to come to this world.
[35:16] But now you see this woman, the
[35:18] condition she was living in.
[35:22] Jesus saw her condition,
[35:25] where her problem was.
[35:27] So he came to where the problem was
[35:31] and said go and tell your husband to
[35:33] come here.
[35:35] And then she said I don't have any
[35:37] husband.
[35:38] And he said you have said the truth. You
[35:41] have had five
[35:43] they are not yours. Even the one you
[35:46] have now
[35:48] is not your husband. Now this woman in
[35:52] her condition
[35:54] changing one man to another man
[35:58] she never got any satisfaction in it
[36:02] and anything of this world.
[36:05] You can never get satisfaction.
[36:09] Praise the name of the Lord. You can
[36:11] never get satisfaction in the things of
[36:13] this life.
[36:16] The only satisfaction you can ever get
[36:20] is only from God.
[36:23] Praise the name of our Lord. Regardless
[36:25] of what somebody may try to achieve.
[36:30] Praise the name of our Lord. There will
[36:32] be no satisfaction of the things of this
[36:34] life.
[36:36] But what the Bible tells us, be content
[36:39] with what you have.
[36:43] There is no satisfaction of the things
[36:44] of this life.
[36:48] One person wrote about rich people
[36:52] that he will struggle to get a million
[36:54] dollar.
[36:58] when he gets a million dollar
[37:01] then he said why don't I get two
[37:04] he struggles he gets two I said but I
[37:07] need five
[37:09] then he gets the five said no they're
[37:11] not enough I need 10
[37:14] said at least have 10 but now when he
[37:17] has somebody having $100 million
[37:22] I also need to have hundreds of million
[37:24] dollars
[37:26] then when he has the billion
[37:30] billion
[37:32] and he says I need to struggle to get a
[37:34] billion
[37:37] burning out
[37:39] [Music]
[37:45] like now the richest man in the world
[37:49] he was saying the other day
[37:52] he said because he owns Tesla
[37:56] and now he's saying that I'm going to
[37:57] make robots
[38:00] and the robots will make my company to
[38:02] be a trillion dollar more trillion
[38:04] dollar company.
[38:08] While everybody is looking at him
[38:11] because he's two times richer than the
[38:13] next person to him.
[38:18] But now he's looking at having trillion
[38:20] dollar rich person.
[38:24] No end to the chasing of these things.
[38:28] Praise the name of our Lord. And now
[38:30] these things here,
[38:33] they perish.
[38:35] They are of a a short time.
[38:40] You know, they are just some things that
[38:42] take a little time.
[38:46] Let us go to the book of Isaiah
[38:50] chapter 55
[38:53] and then verse one.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "For everyone that
[38:58] thirsteth,
[39:00] come ye to the waters. And he that has
[39:03] no money, come ye, buy and eat." Yeah.
[39:07] Come buy wine and milk without money and
[39:11] without price.
[39:13] [Music]
[39:27] [Music]
[39:29] God gives us things free,
[39:34] without money, without price.
[39:38] But yet the things of God,
[39:41] they are the ones which are despised.
[39:44] You go to the town and maybe start
[39:46] preaching the gospel,
[39:49] nobody will pay attention to what you're
[39:51] doing.
[39:52] But let a witch doctor come,
[39:56] a magician comes
[39:59] there mixing things,
[40:01] you get people surrounding there
[40:03] blocking that whole.
[40:07] You see how deceptive Satan is
[40:11] that he has taken the mind of people
[40:15] until the people want things which have
[40:17] no life
[40:20] and they spend their money in those
[40:22] things
[40:23] they spend their time in those things
[40:26] but then the things of God which are
[40:29] free
[40:31] nobody cares about them
[40:34] that's how Satan has deceived
[40:37] But then God is telling us come and buy.
[40:41] They are freely given to us.
[40:45] Praise the name of our Lord. Freely
[40:47] given.
[40:48] You know people are used to being
[40:50] cheated.
[40:53] You know every time they think about
[40:55] cheating, cheating, cheating.
[40:59] So the Bible says, why do you spend
[41:02] money
[41:04] for that which is no bread,
[41:08] &gt;&gt; and you labor for that which satisfies
[41:10] not?
[41:13] Hearken diligently unto me,
[41:16] [Music]
[41:17] and you eat that which is good.
[41:23] and let your soul delight itself in
[41:26] fattiness.
[41:29] He said, "Harken to me."
[41:32] Listen attentively,
[41:35] you know, pay attention.
[41:38] Be obedient,
[41:40] and then you shall eat the fat of your
[41:42] the land,
[41:45] and your soul shall delight itself in
[41:47] fattiness.
[41:50] Incline your ear.
[41:52] Come unto me here and your soul shall
[41:57] live
[41:58] and I will make an everlasting covenant
[42:00] with you.
[42:03] Even the sure mercies of David.
[42:08] Praise the name of our Lord. What an
[42:10] assurance we have to from God.
[42:15] It is an asssurance.
[42:19] You know God telling us come unto me
[42:23] like in Matthew chapter 11 and then
[42:27] verse 28
[42:28] come unto me. You are heavy laden.
[42:33] I will give you rest. But somebody says
[42:36] me I'm not coming.
[42:39] I'm too busy.
[42:41] Like the invitation which was given to
[42:43] the people.
[42:45] come to the wedding banquet
[42:50] of the king. He said call as many as
[42:53] possible
[42:56] satisfaction.
[42:57] Everything is said
[43:00] I have married the wife.
[43:03] In in other words, he was contented with
[43:07] his religion.
[43:10] Like when you talk to somebody about
[43:12] accepting Jesus Christ as their personal
[43:14] savior,
[43:16] he tells me I'm a Muslim.
[43:19] Me I'm a Catholic. Me I'm a Protestant.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Then you ask him. When did you become?
[43:26] He said my family even my grandfather
[43:31] then you tell him it was your
[43:32] grandfather's religion.
[43:36] You also need to make a decision as an
[43:38] individual.
[43:40] Because the Bible says the soul of the
[43:43] son
[43:45] is of the Lord. Even the soul of the
[43:49] father
[43:50] every soul has to decide for itself.
[43:54] The soul that sinnth
[43:57] shall die. The religion of your father
[44:00] will not help you.
[44:02] The religion of your mother will not
[44:04] help you.
[44:07] Like the people who come to church
[44:08] because of parents
[44:11] or if you are coming to church because
[44:13] of your parents,
[44:16] it will not help you until you make your
[44:20] personal decision.
[44:22] I said, Lord, I'm accepting you today.
[44:27] Your parents may be drinking from that
[44:28] living fountain.
[44:30] Your parents may be drinking from that
[44:32] living fountain.
[44:35] See,
[44:38] but what about you?
[44:41] Where are you drinking from?
[44:44] Praise the name of the Lord. Your
[44:46] parents take the things of God to be so
[44:48] serious.
[44:51] How about you?
[44:54] Praise the name of our Lord. God doesn't
[44:56] have grandchildren.
[45:00] You also have to make him your father.
[45:03] You have to make him your creator.
[45:06] You have to make him your savior.
[45:09] You as a personal individual
[45:12] and have a personal relationship.
[45:17] So he says come and buy
[45:20] without money without price
[45:23] and you get satisfaction.
[45:26] Praise the name of our Lord. But people
[45:29] don't care about the things of God.
[45:32] But he says, "Come unto me a heavy laden
[45:37] and I'll give you rest." Praise the name
[45:40] of our Lord. Now in the message without
[45:42] money without price,
[45:45] he says all things that are lasting,
[45:51] all things that are good,
[45:54] all things that are pleasant,
[45:57] all things that are eternal
[46:01] are free
[46:03] and cost you nothing.
[46:07] At the ending of the writing of the
[46:09] Bible,
[46:12] It said, "Whosoever will
[46:16] let him come and drink from the waters
[46:19] of the fountain
[46:24] of life
[46:26] freely,
[46:27] without money, without price.
[46:31] Why do you spend money
[46:34] for that which satisfies not?
[46:38] And let the real things that do satisfy
[46:43] free
[46:45] go and preserved by yourself.
[46:49] [Music]
[46:53] Praise the name of the Lord. He says
[46:55] without money,
[46:57] without price. Now you look at what is
[47:00] happening now.
[47:03] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[47:05] have a phone
[47:07] to use it, you need data all the time.
[47:14] Every time maybe 1,000 or 2,000 or
[47:17] whatever,
[47:20] it is just like drunkards.
[47:22] [Music]
[47:26] Even when he's having 500
[47:29] He will go where they get a small total
[47:32] 500
[47:35] having 1,000
[47:38] first branch there
[47:40] and these phones become like alcohol.
[47:44] The phones become like alcohol
[47:48] data data data data. So you spend a
[47:51] whole night just spending on whatever
[47:54] media it is.
[47:58] You you have your Bible there and the
[48:00] whole week you've forgotten about it.
[48:04] They are free
[48:07] but you are troubled because you don't
[48:08] have money for data
[48:14] to use it. It costs
[48:19] to use it
[48:22] free of charge.
[48:24] Why do you spend money on those things
[48:27] which are not?
[48:29] The message books
[48:31] are just there. There are books you have
[48:34] you've never read for 10 years.
[48:40] But you are troubled about data.
[48:45] What is trending? Have you heard this?
[48:50] You want to post something on status.
[48:59] to know that. So you data
[49:03] &gt;&gt; or you go to those things of maybe
[49:05] borrow
[49:07] time
[49:10] but free things
[49:13] are lying idle there
[49:15] and yet they have life.
[49:19] But then we spend time on this
[49:23] funny funny adverts come
[49:28] funny things and then you can say oh
[49:31] what is this then your data is over but
[49:35] then you've got evil spirits in your
[49:36] heart
[49:38] so you put data to get evil spirits you
[49:43] put data
[49:45] to corrupt your morals
[49:49] you put data to get your heart troubled,
[49:53] your mind troubled, and you become sick.
[49:59] Why do you buy things
[50:01] which have no life? But that's what the
[50:04] devil has done.
[50:06] Free things,
[50:08] we despise them.
[50:10] Things which are expensive,
[50:13] we want to be there, struggling to be
[50:16] part of them.
[50:18] Then brother Brandham says,
[50:21] While you are in silence and in prayer,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; is there in this building this morning?
[50:32] Those who have not who have not drinking
[50:36] from that fountain
[50:39] that desires
[50:42] the of the world is still in your life
[50:47] and you would like to change your
[50:49] drinking place this morning.
[50:54] Oh user of your money.
[50:58] You would like to come and buy from God.
[51:03] without money, without price,
[51:07] honey,
[51:09] milk,
[51:10] joys of wine.
[51:13] Would you raise your hand and say,
[51:14] "Remember me, brother."
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. We are
[51:20] faced with the same challenge.
[51:24] The Bible says where your treasures are
[51:30] that's where your heart is. So you start
[51:32] examining yourself.
[51:34] Where is my heart? When I look at the
[51:38] time the whole day,
[51:41] where do I spend most of my time?
[51:46] Praise the name of our Lord. You do a
[51:48] selfexamination.
[51:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in this
[51:54] message
[51:55] the communion
[51:57] he says I'm astounded in this day
[52:03] and I've always been
[52:05] people profess to be Christians
[52:09] and the first little trial comes on
[52:15] they fall by the wayside.
[52:19] It goes to show
[52:22] that it was an intellectual conception
[52:25] of Christ.
[52:29] That's the reason so many doesn't hold
[52:32] out today
[52:35] is because it is an intellectual
[52:37] conception.
[52:40] Intellectually you could believe it.
[52:44] But it goes further than that.
[52:48] To accept Christ
[52:50] is to accept the person of Christ.
[52:55] Many of us accept religion of
[52:57] Christianity
[53:03] upon learning of creeds.
[53:07] Others accept Christianity upon
[53:09] doctrines of baptism.
[53:15] Others believe that they are Christians
[53:17] because of some emotion that they have
[53:19] exercised
[53:27] such as shouting or dancing in the
[53:30] spirit or speaking with tongues
[53:34] or having some marvelous gift to
[53:36] present.
[53:39] All those things are good
[53:42] in their place.
[53:44] But to accept Christ
[53:48] is to accept the person of Christ.
[53:54] [Music]
[53:57] It is then these other things just
[54:00] automatically fall in line.
[54:06] Praise the name of the Lord. So now you
[54:08] look at your interaction with God.
[54:14] How are you relating with God in your
[54:17] life?
[54:20] How do you say you have God in your
[54:22] heart
[54:24] and you think about him only once in a
[54:26] week
[54:29] when I'm coming on Sunday?
[54:32] You know God, I'm going to meet God.
[54:36] How about at your home? Other activities
[54:39] you just don't mind about him.
[54:43] So you had an intellectual conception of
[54:45] God.
[54:48] If you really accepted God,
[54:52] he came into your heart.
[54:55] He doesn't leave you.
[54:57] And that personal relationship
[55:01] will always influence your decision
[55:05] making.
[55:08] will always influence where you spend
[55:10] most of your time.
[55:14] Like now in the previous quote we've
[55:16] been reading,
[55:19] you change your drinking place.
[55:24] You know your drinking all the time
[55:26] maybe is in football.
[55:29] Your drinking all the time maybe is in
[55:31] these funny things of dirt jokes and
[55:34] everything.
[55:37] Or maybe in your profession that's all
[55:39] you think about
[55:43] or maybe in your farmland and all all
[55:45] shop and everything like that
[55:49] and you are taken up by those kind of
[55:51] things.
[55:53] He says change it
[55:56] let it be in Christ.
[56:00] Now that does not mean that you leave
[56:01] your farm.
[56:04] But he's telling you while you are even
[56:06] in your farm,
[56:09] let Christ rule at your place of work.
[56:13] The decisions you make,
[56:16] you you are working in your farm or your
[56:18] shop.
[56:21] The Holy Spirit in you will make you so
[56:25] conscious.
[56:29] the things of God until when it is time
[56:32] for fellowship,
[56:36] you will not care.
[56:38] The next clients come, you say, I'm
[56:40] going to pray
[56:43] and then you shut down whatever you're
[56:45] doing
[56:46] and say I have to remember my great and
[56:48] serve him.
[56:51] Praise the name of our Lord. You put the
[56:53] things of God first.
[56:57] Praise the name of our Lord. your time,
[57:00] you will put the things of God first.
[57:03] The life you live,
[57:06] you'll put the things of God first.
[57:09] When you are going to a shop to buy
[57:11] clothes,
[57:13] you're not going to go by the fashions
[57:14] of the world.
[57:17] Why? Because God is in you. He is a
[57:21] living fountain.
[57:23] And you know, like we go to River Nile
[57:25] here. Have you ever imagined river
[57:28] stopping to flow?
[57:34] You just say you know you know the
[57:36] bridge is dry
[57:39] bridge.
[57:41] Of course in some countries you get
[57:42] those rivers dry
[57:46] like there is a place I went to and then
[57:49] you say signpost river.
[57:53] When you reach there, but where is the
[57:56] river here?
[57:59] The fountain of God doesn't dry up
[58:04] unless you block it.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; You can't put there blocks of stone
[58:09] here. This and then you say divert,
[58:14] divert,
[58:16] you go the other side. But me, I don't
[58:18] need you now.
[58:20] Then on Sunday you try to unblock one
[58:22] block
[58:25] &gt;&gt; and then after Sunday you block.
[58:30] You know the river of God does not
[58:32] become dry.
[58:35] It's you now to decide that let me block
[58:37] it.
[58:40] We put useful lusts here
[58:44] because those things will actually
[58:46] grieve the Holy Spirit
[58:49] and the Holy Spirit is the river of
[58:50] life. So you grieve the Holy Spirit
[58:54] then you blocking it.
[58:57] Praise the name of the Lord. But we need
[59:00] to see that we keep the river flowing.
[59:05] Let us go to John chapter 7.
[59:09] Praise the name of the Lord.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; John chapter 7 and then verse 37.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; In the last day, that great day of the
[59:18] feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
[59:22] "If any man thirst, let him come unto me
[59:26] and drink.
[59:32] Verse
[59:39] 38.
[59:40] [Music]
[59:42] He that believeth on me, as the
[59:45] scripture has said, out of his belly
[59:48] shall flow rivers of living water.
[1:00:03] He says, "He that believeth on."
[1:00:07] So how do you drink?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Believe. When you believe
[1:00:13] when you are obedient
[1:00:16] then you are drinking and our drinking
[1:00:18] should be continuous.
[1:00:22] Come unto me
[1:00:24] and drink. So when you come to him,
[1:00:28] accept what he's telling you,
[1:00:32] take it seriously in your life. Be
[1:00:36] obedient to what he's telling you and
[1:00:39] just keep on drinking. Keep on drinking.
[1:00:42] And then brother Brandham says, when the
[1:00:45] tree keeps on drinking,
[1:00:47] then it puts the leaf.
[1:00:50] When it keeps on drinking, the branch
[1:00:52] comes out.
[1:00:54] It keeps on drinking, the flowers come
[1:00:57] out, keeps on drinking, the fruits come
[1:01:00] out.
[1:01:02] That's how we grow in Christ.
[1:01:05] We should continuously drink from the
[1:01:07] living fountain.
[1:01:10] And as you drink, you are satisfied.
[1:01:15] You know, the more you drink is the more
[1:01:17] the weaknesses keep on going away.
[1:01:21] It's just like the the when a flow is
[1:01:24] happening,
[1:01:27] you know, it keeps on washing the
[1:01:29] trashes,
[1:01:31] push them aside, push them aside. And
[1:01:34] that's the same thing. When we keep on
[1:01:37] receiving the Holy Spirit,
[1:01:40] keep on blocking this funny spirit, the
[1:01:42] other funny habit, the other funny
[1:01:45] thing, the other funny thing. And then
[1:01:47] at the end of the day, you find that
[1:01:50] your weaknesses
[1:01:53] are all no more. Why? Because you keep
[1:01:56] on drinking.
[1:01:58] You keep on drinking. So as you drink,
[1:02:02] you receive the power.
[1:02:05] And as you receive that power,
[1:02:08] that power transforms you. Praise the
[1:02:12] name of our Lord. You keep on reading
[1:02:14] the word of God. You keep on meditating
[1:02:16] upon the word of God. You keep on
[1:02:18] believing the word of God. It changes
[1:02:22] your mind.
[1:02:23] The way you think. You used to think
[1:02:26] dirty thoughts
[1:02:29] until you would want to see where those
[1:02:32] you know evil spirits attract where they
[1:02:33] are.
[1:02:38] So when you have an evil spirit here
[1:02:41] and another has another evil spirit
[1:02:43] there even when they are strangers
[1:02:48] you'll find yourself easily working with
[1:02:50] those people
[1:02:53] like people who like
[1:02:58] the spirits identify themselves
[1:03:02] somebody newly come to church or maybe
[1:03:04] to a community
[1:03:06] But this woman has just come.
[1:03:10] But how would he get there? But his
[1:03:13] spirit is communicating saying there's a
[1:03:14] friend here.
[1:03:18] Even cheats are the same.
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:22] They just get themselves together
[1:03:26] and then they'll find that they are
[1:03:28] comfortable and that one is my best
[1:03:30] friend.
[1:03:32] But you've just known the person today.
[1:03:35] How is it your best friend?
[1:03:37] Because the evil spirits there.
[1:03:40] But now when you allow the Holy Spirit
[1:03:42] to come
[1:03:44] and cut off those evil spirits,
[1:03:48] he will remove those kind of strange
[1:03:49] natures.
[1:03:52] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:03:55] to keep drinking.
[1:03:57] As you keep on drinking,
[1:04:00] your thoughts are changed. Your decision
[1:04:02] making is changed.
[1:04:05] Even how you speak,
[1:04:07] you will not just speak anything anyhow,
[1:04:11] your words will be selected.
[1:04:15] It will be hard for you to say bad dirt
[1:04:17] words out of your mouth
[1:04:20] because they not in your mind. You don't
[1:04:22] think about them.
[1:04:25] Somebody who is vulgar
[1:04:29] is dirty.
[1:04:33] The mouth is dirty.
[1:04:36] The thoughts are dirty. Their actions
[1:04:38] are dirty.
[1:04:40] You know, it's just like a house flies.
[1:04:44] They go to dirty places
[1:04:47] and house flies are like evil spirits.
[1:04:50] They go where dirty things and rotten
[1:04:52] things are.
[1:04:55] So that one with a dirt mind,
[1:04:58] evil spirits just possess him there.
[1:05:03] you get close to them.
[1:05:06] How when you get close to dirt places,
[1:05:09] you smell dirt things.
[1:05:13] But why would you want to smell dirt
[1:05:15] things?
[1:05:18] That's the same thing with being a with
[1:05:20] a dirty person.
[1:05:22] His dirt is talk and if you're not care,
[1:05:25] you'll start eating his jokes.
[1:05:31] the demons have got into you
[1:05:34] but you know you just need to see that
[1:05:36] you avoid those kind of wicked things.
[1:05:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us move
[1:05:44] on to another scripture here.
[1:05:48] Let us go to the book of Psalms chapter
[1:05:50] 36
[1:05:54] from verse 5 to verse 10.
[1:05:58] The Bible says, "Thy merc, O Lord, is in
[1:06:01] the heavens, and thy faithfulness
[1:06:04] reaches unto the clouds.
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:11] Thy righteousness is like the great
[1:06:14] mountains. Thy judgments are a great
[1:06:17] deep, oh Lord, though preservest man and
[1:06:20] beast.
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:37] how excellent is thy loving kindness, oh
[1:06:40] God. Therefore, the children of men put
[1:06:43] their trust under the shadow of thy
[1:06:45] wings.
[1:06:50] [Music]
[1:06:57] They shall be abundantly satisfied with
[1:07:00] the fatness of thy house, and thou shalt
[1:07:04] make them drink of the river of thy
[1:07:07] pleasures.
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:29] For with thee is the fountain of life.
[1:07:32] In thy light shall we see light.
[1:07:45] Oh, continue thy loving kindness unto
[1:07:47] them that know thee, and thy
[1:07:49] righteousness to the upright in heart.
[1:08:00] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:08:03] scripture is telling us
[1:08:06] that God
[1:08:09] will abundantly satisfy us.
[1:08:14] Praise the name of the Lord. So you come
[1:08:16] to the fountain.
[1:08:18] The other the woman was asking Jesus
[1:08:20] Christ,
[1:08:22] give me of this water. Give me of this
[1:08:25] living water. And then God is telling us
[1:08:29] is the fountain of life.
[1:08:32] So you just come to him.
[1:08:36] The fountain has already been open.
[1:08:39] Why don't you drink? Why don't you have
[1:08:42] a permanent connection?
[1:08:45] And then you see that you keep on
[1:08:46] drinking.
[1:08:48] Fill my heart, Lord.
[1:08:51] Fill me more and more.
[1:08:54] You know, you are not limiting him.
[1:08:57] You're not drinking a little, but you
[1:09:00] are taking in abundantly.
[1:09:03] You're receiving more of God in your
[1:09:05] life.
[1:09:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:09:09] message life,
[1:09:12] he says, "Take that blessed Holy Spirit
[1:09:18] that God placed a thirst in your soul
[1:09:25] to call for
[1:09:29] and you satisfy it.
[1:09:39] with a nightclub somewhere.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; So God put that thirst for the Holy
[1:09:46] Spirit.
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:50] But then you take an alternative of a
[1:09:52] nightclub.
[1:09:57] No wonder
[1:09:59] you got a headache the next morning.
[1:10:04] Then you take a case of beer,
[1:10:09] go to your house
[1:10:11] and sit down and drink it
[1:10:15] trying to satisfy
[1:10:18] godly thirst
[1:10:22] that God put in your soul to thirst
[1:10:24] after him
[1:10:28] and you take the devil's slope and try
[1:10:31] to satisfy that thirst.
[1:10:38] How can you receive anything
[1:10:41] but eternal separation from the presence
[1:10:44] of almighty God
[1:10:48] when he put that thirst after him?
[1:10:55] Praise the name of the Lord. And David
[1:10:57] surrendered himself and said,
[1:11:00] "My soul is thirsting like I was in a
[1:11:03] dry land
[1:11:06] where there is no water.
[1:11:09] I search for thee, oh God.
[1:11:12] There you are." David said, "I send thee
[1:11:15] in thy sanctuary,
[1:11:18] and my soul thirsts for that power
[1:11:23] where there you are." That's the
[1:11:25] difference.
[1:11:27] That what's that's what makes things
[1:11:29] different
[1:11:32] is the thirst that God give you.
[1:11:38] If you satisfy it with the water,
[1:11:43] come unto me all you that thirsty.
[1:11:47] Come and drink from the fountain of life
[1:11:49] freely
[1:11:52] without money, without
[1:11:54] there is a fountain open in the house of
[1:11:57] the city of David.
[1:12:02] There is a fountain that you are
[1:12:03] thirsting for.
[1:12:07] Don't try to pervert it
[1:12:11] by saying, "I'll satisfy it by drinking.
[1:12:17] Or I'll satisfied by having date with
[1:12:19] girls.
[1:12:24] I'll sleep out on my husband.
[1:12:32] I'll go out a little on my wife.
[1:12:37] You are only heaping judgment.
[1:12:40] You say, "I'm not satisfied.
[1:12:44] No wonder it is God dealing with you.
[1:12:49] God trying to bring you something
[1:12:53] and you take the devil's suggestion
[1:12:57] and go off with it. And that's the way
[1:13:00] sorrow comes.
[1:13:03] That's how death comes.
[1:13:06] And that life is not life.
[1:13:09] It is death. For the wages of sin is
[1:13:12] death,
[1:13:15] but the gift of God is eternal life
[1:13:20] that will receive it.
[1:13:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us come
[1:13:25] to God for true satisfaction.
[1:13:29] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:13:31] fountain of living water,
[1:13:35] let it be opened in your soul.
[1:13:38] Let it be continuously flowing.
[1:13:41] And now when God is in your soul,
[1:13:45] he will make you go to places that
[1:13:47] please him.
[1:13:51] He will make you read his word.
[1:13:54] He will make you hear his word.
[1:13:57] He will make you think about his word.
[1:14:00] He will make you obey his word.
[1:14:04] He will make you desire more of him
[1:14:08] when Christ comes inside of you.
[1:14:12] The Bible says Simeon was waiting for
[1:14:16] the consolation of Israel.
[1:14:19] In other words, he was reading the word
[1:14:21] of God.
[1:14:25] When Daniel was in Babylon
[1:14:28] from the age of around 12
[1:14:32] and then now he was about 68 years
[1:14:36] and then he was always reading the
[1:14:38] prophets of Jeremiah.
[1:14:42] Now when he knew that the time is at
[1:14:43] hand
[1:14:45] for their captivity to get over,
[1:14:49] he read in the book of Jeremiah.
[1:14:51] And he went with the word before the
[1:14:53] Lord.
[1:14:55] Lord, our time is up.
[1:14:58] Lord, forgive us. We want to be restored
[1:15:01] back to Jerusalem.
[1:15:04] That God that is in you
[1:15:07] will always draw you to know more about
[1:15:10] him.
[1:15:12] always take you to read his word.
[1:15:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Draw you to
[1:15:17] places that he's pleased with.
[1:15:21] When the Holy Spirit was on Simeon
[1:15:24] reading the word, talking about the
[1:15:26] promises of God,
[1:15:29] the Holy Spirit revealed to Simeon that
[1:15:33] you are not going to die until you see
[1:15:37] the Lord is Christ. And that's the same
[1:15:40] thing. also in our lives. If you have
[1:15:43] the spirit of God, the spirit of God in
[1:15:46] you will always take you back to the
[1:15:49] word of God.
[1:15:51] Praise the name of our Lord. In other
[1:15:53] words, you are drinking from the
[1:15:54] fountain. It's a living reality.
[1:15:58] It's not something you're just
[1:16:00] imagining.
[1:16:02] God speaks to you. God manifests himself
[1:16:05] to you. God hears your prayers.
[1:16:08] God shows himself to you. That's what
[1:16:11] the Bible says. He that loveth me and he
[1:16:16] keepeth my word, I will manifest myself
[1:16:19] to him.
[1:16:21] He reveals himself to you. And then the
[1:16:24] Bible says when he the spirit of truth
[1:16:27] is come,
[1:16:29] he will show you these things. He will
[1:16:31] show you things that are to come.
[1:16:34] The spirit was in Simeon. He showed
[1:16:37] Simeon what's going to come.
[1:16:39] Praise the name of our Lord. The spirit
[1:16:42] was on Daniel. He showed Daniel what's
[1:16:45] going to come.
[1:16:48] The spirit of God when he's in us, he
[1:16:50] will reveal to us the word of God. He
[1:16:54] will remind you the word of God.
[1:16:56] So the spirit of God in you
[1:16:59] will not make you so much think about
[1:17:01] the weekend program.
[1:17:05] I know. At at this club there is this
[1:17:09] cinema hall there is this
[1:17:12] in this town there is this rally
[1:17:16] at this time there is man you
[1:17:20] this and this and the things of God have
[1:17:23] no room there
[1:17:27] like when Jesus was going to be born
[1:17:30] the Bible says there was no room in the
[1:17:32] in
[1:17:34] how about in your in
[1:17:37] is there room for Christ?
[1:17:40] Praise the name of our Lord. If he's
[1:17:42] there, he'll create enough room for
[1:17:44] himself.
[1:17:46] But if he's not there, there will always
[1:17:48] be no room. But you have room for this,
[1:17:52] room for the other, for the other. All
[1:17:55] the other programs,
[1:17:57] you are able to do them. But the things
[1:18:00] of God are forgotten.
[1:18:05] you know I had money but
[1:18:08] even I don't have to go to church
[1:18:12] I'll tell them I don't have I didn't
[1:18:13] have transport
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; but the phone has data
[1:18:17] time is there but no transport to go to
[1:18:20] church
[1:18:22] there's no room in the in there
[1:18:25] in your heart is not recognized
[1:18:29] God is not recognized in your heart.
[1:18:33] He's not the boss.
[1:18:36] He's not the Lord of your life.
[1:18:38] But you need to accept him as your Lord
[1:18:43] and as your savior. That's how the
[1:18:45] fountain will keep on flowing.
[1:18:49] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:18:52] We can finish.
[1:18:54] Let us go to Isaiah chapter 26.
[1:19:02] Isaiah chapter 26.
[1:19:07] And then we start reading from verse
[1:19:08] two.
[1:19:11] The scripture says, "Open ye the gates
[1:19:15] that the righteous nation which keepeth
[1:19:17] the truth may enter in."
[1:19:24] Though we will keep him in perfect
[1:19:26] peace, whose mind is stayed on thee,
[1:19:30] because he trusteth in thee.
[1:19:40] Trust ye in the Lord forever, for in the
[1:19:44] Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.
[1:19:55] praise the name of the Lord. Trust in
[1:19:57] the Lord. In other words, have faith in
[1:20:01] God.
[1:20:03] Have faith in the word of God. Keep on
[1:20:05] believing. Let that fountain keep on
[1:20:08] flowing. And then the Bible says, it
[1:20:11] will keep you in perfect peace
[1:20:15] in the midst of the challenges you may
[1:20:17] be going through in life.
[1:20:20] Your anchor holds. Praise the name of
[1:20:23] God. You are not scared. Like Psalms 46
[1:20:27] says,
[1:20:29] whether the earth below you is taken
[1:20:31] away,
[1:20:33] you are standing firm.
[1:20:37] The Lord is a very present help.
[1:20:43] The Lord is my refuge.
[1:20:47] is a continuous fountain flowing.
[1:20:51] Praise the name of our Lord. In your
[1:20:54] good days,
[1:20:56] keep God with you. Let that fountain
[1:20:59] flow.
[1:21:01] Don't only think about God when you're
[1:21:02] in troubles.
[1:21:05] I'm distressed. I don't know what to do.
[1:21:08] There are troubles here,
[1:21:10] issues here. You need to see that you
[1:21:13] keep God with you all the time.
[1:21:17] Bless the name of our Lord. Make God
[1:21:19] your friend,
[1:21:21] your personal friend that Lord, I cannot
[1:21:25] live without you.
[1:21:28] Just keep on drinking on that fountain
[1:21:31] every day. Like in the Old Testament,
[1:21:34] they had the morning oblation,
[1:21:37] the morning sacrifice.
[1:21:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Daytime
[1:21:43] they were doing sacrifices. Evening they
[1:21:46] were doing sacrifices
[1:21:48] that should be our life continuously
[1:21:51] given into the Lord.
[1:21:54] Praise the name of our Lord. Just having
[1:21:56] that personal relationship with God
[1:22:01] like I remember about Boaz
[1:22:04] the Lord of the harvest.
[1:22:07] When he went into his harvest
[1:22:09] he was all the time exalting the name of
[1:22:12] the Lord.
[1:22:15] even in his field.
[1:22:18] Praise the name of our Lord. He's
[1:22:19] talking about the blessings of God. He's
[1:22:22] talking about the goodness of the Lord.
[1:22:24] That should do the same thing even us
[1:22:28] at our places of work. We are glorifying
[1:22:31] and lifting his name high.
[1:22:34] Where you study from, you are glorifying
[1:22:37] and lifting the name of the Lord high.
[1:22:40] At your home, praise the name of our
[1:22:43] Lord. You are lifting his name on high
[1:22:47] because you are drinking from that
[1:22:48] living fountain.
[1:22:51] It never dries up. And when it flows in
[1:22:54] you,
[1:22:56] Jesus was telling this woman, out of
[1:22:59] your belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:23:02] water.
[1:23:04] So you also start giving out.
[1:23:07] Stream start coming out of you.
[1:23:11] When you are talking to somebody, they
[1:23:14] are troubled.
[1:23:16] Your words will encourage them.
[1:23:20] There is a stream flowing out.
[1:23:23] When you get people who are really in
[1:23:25] kind of terrible situation,
[1:23:28] you can speak peace to them.
[1:23:31] It's a river that is flowing out.
[1:23:34] Praise the name of the Lord. When you
[1:23:36] get people complaining all the time,
[1:23:39] you speak peace, you know, you give what
[1:23:42] you have.
[1:23:44] The streams flow out.
[1:23:47] The fruit of the spirit comes out
[1:23:51] and people can taste of that fruit
[1:23:54] and say, "Surely this river is very
[1:23:56] sweet.
[1:23:59] Not bitter waters,
[1:24:01] but sweet waters."
[1:24:04] It all comes when we are having that
[1:24:06] fountain within us.
[1:24:10] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:24:12] how we shall be able to turn many people
[1:24:13] to Christ
[1:24:15] at our places of work, where we study,
[1:24:19] where we live, when they see your good
[1:24:21] works.
[1:24:23] We glorify the father who is in heaven.
[1:24:26] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us keep
