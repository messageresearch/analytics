[35:36] That day he set me free
[35:40] and made my heart
[35:44] his very throne.
[35:47] My life is no longer mine. I'm a
[35:52] prisoner of love divine.
[35:55] And now I live
[35:59] to praise his name.
[36:03] Who I am, Lord.
[36:07] Who I am.
[36:11] I can see
[36:15] who I am.
[36:19] I'm part of my Savior.
[36:23] I'm part of his word.
[36:27] His revelation
[36:31] predestination
[36:33] [Music]
[36:35] of who I am.
[36:39] On Calary,
[36:41] he died to redeem his Lord's pride.
[36:47] The king of kings
[36:51] became my savior.
[36:55] This is God's grace mystery
[36:59] of love expressed to me
[37:03] that Christ had done
[37:07] my one.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Who am I then?
[37:10] &gt;&gt; I am Lord.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Oh I am Lord.
[37:16] Oh, I am.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can see now.

[37:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, I can see now who I am.
[37:28] I'm part of my Savior.
[37:32] I'm part of this world.
[37:37] It's a revelation
[37:41] predestination
[37:45] of who I am.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, who I am.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; I am.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, I can see now.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; I can see.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can see now. I am
[38:06] &gt;&gt; the my savior
[38:11] of his world.
[38:15] He's a revelation
[38:19] predestination
[38:23] of who I am.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Revelation.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation.
[38:33] destiny nation
[38:36] of who I am.
[38:41] [Applause]
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Aina,
[38:47] &gt;&gt; do you love him?
[38:50] &gt;&gt; We're in his presence.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; And to know who you are before him
[39:00] &gt;&gt; is a revelation. purely revelation.
[39:04] Amen. Amen.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; So I want to welcome all of you into the
[39:08] presence of the Lord.
[39:12] And there are certain small things
[39:15] that always God allows.
[39:20] Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; To kind of confirm
[39:24] that he is in the environment.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just don't know why
[39:32] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about you
[39:36] &gt;&gt; and yesterday I said why don't I call
[39:38] him and say I've not seen him in a long
[39:40] time
[39:43] and I knew that if I called
[39:46] he would say I will come
[39:48] but he's there
[39:52] you know those are things that God
[39:54] allows
[39:56] &gt;&gt; sometimes to tell you I'm not far from
[39:58] you Amen.
[40:02] So, it's a blessing to be in his
[40:03] presence every Sunday morning.
[40:07] And some of the people that have been so
[40:10] zerous,
[40:12] Amen. for the last 40 years.
[40:16] Amen. The older they became
[40:20] is the more they've held on like
[40:24] Amen. Brother,
[40:28] Alex.
[40:29] God bless you.
[40:32] Amen.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; They are not in it, you know, simply
[40:35] because it's good time.
[40:39] Sometimes it's been hard,
[40:41] but they've held on
[40:44] so many hours, brother Fred, you know,
[40:48] when he said he was going to stay in,
[40:52] I wondered how he would be able to be in
[40:55] services all the time.
[40:58] But the Lord has given him grace.
[41:02] Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; To keep driving about 60 kilome to this
[41:09] not once, not one year, not
[41:14] years.
[41:15] Amen. So we appreciate God for people
[41:19] that have made a commitment
[41:22] and they will not fail on that
[41:24] commitment.
[41:26] Amen. Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; You see when I go out there sometimes
[41:31] I appreciate the culture of the white
[41:33] people.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; When a white decides to say I have
[41:40] believed
[41:43] that is final.
[41:46] That's final.
[41:47] If they don't play about their
[41:49] commitment.
[41:52] Amen. Yeah. So, you know, we want to see
[41:55] men and women who have made real
[41:57] commitments like Ruth.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And you know, she says, "Your people
[42:06] will be my people."
[42:09] Amen. Where you die.
[42:12] Where you be, I will be buried. Amen.
[42:15] And then you break the bridges behind
[42:18] you.
[42:21] meaning that you are not going to go
[42:23] back
[42:25] into the former convictions you had.
[42:30] So we appreciate all of you that have
[42:33] kept faithful
[42:36] and you are here all the time,
[42:39] some 40 years,
[42:43] some 20 years, some 10 years, and even
[42:47] those of you have been around for 5
[42:49] years.
[42:52] you know years keep moving.
[42:55] Amen. I don't remember how many years
[42:58] but even uh brother here is almost
[43:02] moving 20 years I think.
[43:06] It's like he came yesterday.
[43:10] Amen. It's a comfort
[43:13] to the ministry
[43:15] to keep seeing the faces he has always
[43:18] seen. Plus
[43:24] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Our sister,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[43:31] Amen. Since you left tomorrow,
[43:34] you have been faithful.
[43:37] God bless you so. Amen. Amen. So, uh,
[43:41] our pastor is not here today.
[43:45] He's in with brother Pastor George
[43:49] Franklin.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Franklin got here yesterday
[43:58] &gt;&gt; and very late.
[44:01] You know, the plane kept saying in the
[44:03] next 2 hours
[44:08] he was supposed to arrive at 10:00 in
[44:10] the morning,
[44:12] 2 in the morning,
[44:16] then 6:00 in the I mean in the evening
[44:18] rather
[44:21] until he got here at 8:00 in the
[44:24] evening.
[44:26] So, they got to the pastor's house at
[44:28] around 2:00 in the morning.
[44:33] Amen. Amen. I told the pastor,
[44:37] I've been doing this for the last 40
[44:38] years.
[44:41] Now, these are your visitors.
[44:45] Amen. Amen. That's what it means to
[44:48] retire from the rest of
[44:52] Do you love him this morning?
[44:54] You just take your burdens onto him.
[44:58] He cares for you.
[45:01] Today we've had a question
[45:03] and uh the question is who am I?
[45:07] Amen. This the one we are going to try
[45:10] to answer this morning
[45:12] and we shall keep by the grace of God
[45:17] as the Lord keeps giving me grace
[45:20] to deal with the subject of who am I.
[45:25] You know when you know who you are and
[45:28] you catch a revelation of who you are,
[45:32] it is strengthening.
[45:34] It is establishing.
[45:36] It's encouraging.
[45:38] Amen. You know I'm in this journey
[45:42] between me and my father.
[45:45] Amen. Not between me
[45:49] and my brother. If my brother falls out,
[45:53] I'm falling out.
[45:55] You are in this because you were called
[45:58] by Godated
[46:01] seed.
[46:03] Amen. It's a blessing to know that.
[46:06] Let's stand up and get into the
[46:09] scripture reading this morning.
[46:12] We shall go to the book of John
[46:15] chapter one. Amen. Amen. Uh before we
[46:19] read the scripture,
[46:21] let's have a word of prayer. Precious
[46:24] heavenly father, we give thanks and
[46:27] known to you.
[46:29] Father, for giving us grace
[46:32] this morning to come before your
[46:34] presence,
[46:36] Lord, in your presence, we've got
[46:38] answers to all questions.
[46:42] We've got, Father, dear Lord God, the
[46:44] supply of all our needs,
[46:48] find comfort in the time of trouble.
[46:52] Find the peace, Lord.
[46:54] We find the joy in times of sadness.
[46:58] Father, this is a house of correction, a
[47:02] house of instruction,
[47:04] a house where we rejoice together.
[47:07] Father, you've done a lot of good for
[47:09] us. We are getting into the sharing of
[47:12] the word.
[47:14] I pray that you may break it to us that
[47:17] it may become life, Father, that it may
[47:20] encourage us
[47:22] in the end times. Lord, when everything
[47:25] is going wrong,
[47:27] help us Lord to know who we are that we
[47:31] may act as those who have got a
[47:34] revelation of God
[47:37] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So John 1
[47:41] verse 19
[47:44] it says and this is the record of John
[47:48] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[47:51] from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[48:01] who art thou? May the Lord have blessing
[48:04] the reading of his word.
[48:08] you may be seated.
[48:10] So
[48:13] you know they sent people
[48:17] from Jerusalem
[48:19] to ask him who he was
[48:23] and he confessed and denied not
[48:27] but he confessed
[48:29] I am not the Christ.
[48:31] He could not take another man's position
[48:35] because he knew we were. Amen. He would
[48:39] not want to be in the greater position.
[48:43] When God puts a man in a position,
[48:47] he makes that man know his position
[48:50] and makes that man rejoice in his
[48:52] position.
[48:54] And they asked him, "What then art thou?
[48:58] Yes."
[49:00] And he says, I am not.
[49:04] Art thou that prophet?
[49:06] He answered, "No."
[49:08] Then said they unto him, "Who art thou,
[49:12] that we may give an answer to them that
[49:15] sent us?"
[49:17] What sayest thou of thy soul?
[49:21] Now
[49:23] &gt;&gt; he said,
[49:24] &gt;&gt; "I am the voice of one crying in the
[49:28] wilderness.
[49:32] Make straight the way of the Lord
[49:36] as said the prophet Isaiah."
[49:39] So we are answering the question, who am
[49:42] I?
[49:45] And all of us many times have questions
[49:49] as on to who we are before God.
[49:53] So we all certainly in another life here
[49:56] on earth
[49:59] we have earthly identities.
[50:03] Earthly identities
[50:07] and some of that we are proud of it
[50:12] and some of it we are even ashamed of
[50:14] it.
[50:16] They will know you as so and so son
[50:20] and sometimes your father was the least
[50:23] in the village.
[50:27] So you don't have such a status
[50:31] and sometimes
[50:32] you'll be identified by the wealth you
[50:35] hold
[50:37] or by the fame you hold.
[50:41] Fame. Fame. Amen. So there is a way each
[50:45] one is known in this present world
[50:50] we whoever we are there is a way we are
[50:54] known
[50:56] and many times the people don't refer us
[51:02] by our names they refer to you by the
[51:06] status
[51:09] you know they just call that Mawa's
[51:12] place
[51:16] That's what they call brother William on
[51:18] the
[51:20] many people don't know his name
[51:22] but they say oh that doctor's place
[51:27] in the scriptures
[51:29] men were usually referred to
[51:34] you know by their status many times
[51:38] and sometimes the people who are not
[51:40] born again
[51:43] They are very very you know happy being
[51:46] referred to by the good status
[51:52] that governor or
[51:56] M or
[51:58] that rich man.
[52:01] You see they they appreciate that.
[52:04] And even in the Bible there were men
[52:07] that were referred to by their status.
[52:12] You would find statements like
[52:15] the ground of a certain rich man brought
[52:17] forth plate flesh.
[52:24] And now another one is there was a
[52:26] certain rich man which had a steward.
[52:32] There was a certain rich man which was
[52:35] clothed in purple and fine linen.
[52:41] And there was a certain noble man
[52:45] whose son was seeking.
[52:50] There was in a city a judge
[52:53] which feared not God neither regarded
[52:56] man.
[52:58] You know they were being referred to by
[53:01] their status.
[53:03] Amen. As a son of God, I wouldn't want
[53:07] to be referred to by my status.
[53:11] Who am I? Amen. So they are famous
[53:15] persons
[53:17] whose names are even rarely mentioned.
[53:21] When they in the community,
[53:23] they start calling them Mr. President.
[53:27] Sir,
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Mr. President
[53:30] you know they are referred to by the
[53:32] status.
[53:34] So we do
[53:36] what we do
[53:39] or you know how we live our lives
[53:43] gives us a legacy in life
[53:47] and maybe a famous legacy
[53:52] in you know or an infamous legacy.
[53:57] Amen. Amen. So what do you want to be
[54:02] remembered for?
[54:05] because you are a child of God
[54:09] and then you want to have a mix of
[54:11] certain other stuff.
[54:14] What would you want to be remembered
[54:16] for?
[54:18] To be remembered as an unstable
[54:20] Christian
[54:23] to be remembered as a kid
[54:26] to be you remembered as a corrosome
[54:28] woman.
[54:31] What would you want to be remembered
[54:33] for?
[54:35] You know, there are some people that are
[54:36] going to leave this earth
[54:40] and they would tell stories about them.
[54:44] But every Sunday,
[54:47] from when I was a child
[54:50] up to when I grew,
[54:53] I'm now 50.
[54:55] I've always seen that man
[54:58] carry his Bible.
[55:01] on Sunday going to church that he never
[55:05] missed a service.
[55:07] Are you together with me?
[55:09] &gt;&gt; I want to be remembered by that legacy.
[55:12] Amen. Would you want to be remembered
[55:16] for sowing discord among the brethren?
[55:23] You wouldn't be remembered for such a
[55:25] legus.
[55:28] Somebody say amen.
[55:30] You want to be remembered by something
[55:34] that will be good that even if people
[55:37] don't know your name
[55:40] when they point to that house, they say
[55:43] that's the pastor's house.
[55:46] Are you together with me? Amen. So
[55:49] sometimes
[55:51] in the scriptures, men who mattered
[55:54] much,
[55:56] their names were mentioned in the
[55:58] scriptures. Those
[56:01] who mentioned much before God,
[56:05] they had names mentioned.
[56:08] And some others people who were famous
[56:10] here on earth,
[56:13] the scripture just says there was a rich
[56:16] man.
[56:19] There was a noble man.
[56:21] But when we go to the book of Luke
[56:25] chapter 16
[56:27] and verse 19,
[56:29] there was a certain rich man
[56:34] which was clothed in purple and fine
[56:36] linen.
[56:40] And he faed somely every day.
[56:45] And there was a certain beggar
[56:49] named Lazarus.
[56:52] Are you together with me? The other man
[56:55] who was rich is mentioned by his wealth.
[57:00] But this man here
[57:03] who feared God, he has his name in the
[57:07] lamb's book of life.
[57:09] Even if he was a beggar,
[57:12] God call him by name.
[57:15] Who am I this morning?
[57:18] Amen. Amen. So going by this parable,
[57:22] you could be poor,
[57:25] but if you have lived right,
[57:28] you will always be remembered by your
[57:29] name.
[57:32] Amen. You'll always be remembered by
[57:34] your name.
[57:36] If my legacy is negative this morning,
[57:41] I'd rather repair it now
[57:44] that I could be remembered
[57:47] for a Christian who straightened his
[57:50] work.
[57:52] Amen. If it's a crooked walk,
[57:56] I would rather repair it now
[58:00] that I may be remembered as a Christian
[58:03] who repaired this Christian work.
[58:08] I want you to remember that we have got
[58:11] the blood constant with us.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember these two things
[58:17] as you live your life. You should know
[58:22] you were saved by grace.
[58:25] Amen. You had done nothing whatsoever.
[58:29] But grace came your way because you
[58:32] predestinated of God.
[58:35] But after grace you are kept by the
[58:38] blood.
[58:40] Amen. Every morning keep taking whatever
[58:44] is negative
[58:46] and the blood allow God to wash you.
[58:51] Keep you in a walk
[58:54] after you have left.
[58:56] you will be remembered for the person
[58:58] who care to put everything under the
[59:01] blood.
[59:03] Amen. So so many people today
[59:07] when they join church they just become
[59:10] drifters.
[59:13] Amen. So we don't want to do that.
[59:16] We want to be people
[59:19] that have come to a place
[59:22] and we don't drift.
[59:25] We are not drifters from church to
[59:27] church
[59:29] without purpose and direction.
[59:33] Amen. So you know brother remember him
[59:38] saying what a horrible thing. You know
[59:41] when he was talking about uh the uh
[59:44] voice of many water
[59:48] and then he says those voices
[59:51] &gt;&gt; were the voices of the minister.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? They were
[59:58] voices of the minister.
[1:00:01] Amen. They were like the voices of many
[1:00:04] waters.
[1:00:07] But when God calls a man,
[1:00:11] it pleases God
[1:00:13] to place him in an in
[1:00:18] a particular Yes. which is the church so
[1:00:22] that this person here
[1:00:25] can have a watch,
[1:00:28] can have a shift,
[1:00:30] can have somebody watch over him.
[1:00:34] And if you do not have a person
[1:00:38] to watch over you, you know, brother
[1:00:41] Brandham
[1:00:42] would worry over you.
[1:00:45] He says, "What a horrible fear
[1:00:48] or a drifting soul
[1:00:51] of the sea of life, no pilot to guide
[1:00:54] him.
[1:00:56] Lose floaty with the taring
[1:01:01] the row of the great cataract.
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:05] What a horrible thing
[1:01:08] it would be to a drifting soul.
[1:01:12] Amen. If you was a Christian,
[1:01:15] if God calls you, stand and make a
[1:01:19] legacy.
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:25] Are you together with me? Yeah. You
[1:01:27] leave a legacy
[1:01:29] and you say God have mercy upon me that
[1:01:32] I may stand right.
[1:01:35] I want a people that are going to be
[1:01:38] looked for
[1:01:40] and the address is permanent.
[1:01:44] The address is permanent.
[1:01:50] But when you say is in this church, then
[1:01:53] that church in that church are drifting.
[1:01:57] So,
[1:02:00] amen. But you need to stand
[1:02:04] and say, "Lord, here I am." And I'm
[1:02:07] going to be counted here.
[1:02:10] If I'm the tribe of Judah,
[1:02:13] I cannot become Benjamin.
[1:02:16] Are you together with me? Yes, sir. If
[1:02:19] I'm Benjamin today,
[1:02:22] I cannot become tomorrow.
[1:02:26] Amen. If I'm Judah, I'm Judah.
[1:02:30] And if they are looking for me, there is
[1:02:33] a tribe where they can find.
[1:02:37] Yes sir. That's how we can have a strong
[1:02:39] church.
[1:02:42] Amen. Amen. We should settle
[1:02:45] and be pased
[1:02:48] rather than drifting on the Cadillac.
[1:02:52] The voice of the ministers
[1:02:55] from pastor to pastor
[1:02:58] we must find a solid ground
[1:03:01] in our local church.
[1:03:04] Amen. This is now pastoral teaching.
[1:03:10] Amen. Everybody must know who I am.
[1:03:15] You should answer your question.
[1:03:17] Who am I? Brother says, "We don't dress
[1:03:22] up
[1:03:25] to lay around
[1:03:29] lay around a corner
[1:03:33] and flat with girls.
[1:03:41] Amen. Amen. We train our army to fight.
[1:03:45] [Laughter]
[1:03:48] So when you come here, you know that you
[1:03:51] are being trained
[1:03:53] to handle something.
[1:03:56] You are here to be trained.
[1:04:00] But if they send some from Jerusalem
[1:04:05] and say, "Who are you that we may send a
[1:04:08] report back to those who are ready?"
[1:04:11] John was ready.
[1:04:14] He knew he was. go from the pulpit to
[1:04:16] the pew.
[1:04:19] We must fight anything
[1:04:24] to stay in our legacy as Christians.
[1:04:29] Amen. Amen. Yes sir. So I want the blood
[1:04:33] of the lamb.
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:37] Amen. And as I walk,
[1:04:40] praise God. They can trail me.
[1:04:44] They can try to see who I am.
[1:04:49] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I want us
[1:04:53] to really be, you know, people.
[1:05:00] If the Lord can help me to put this
[1:05:03] right,
[1:05:06] who have discovered who they are?
[1:05:10] My legacy
[1:05:13] should not be
[1:05:15] there was a certain rich man.
[1:05:18] No sir, my legacy
[1:05:21] should have a name to it.
[1:05:24] And his name was Lazarus.
[1:05:28] Praise God. So let us define a name here
[1:05:32] which we have done a few times.
[1:05:35] And I said that a name
[1:05:38] has something to do with the divine
[1:05:40] assignment.
[1:05:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:59] Sometimes
[1:06:00] our mothers or fathers,
[1:06:03] they give us names that are negative
[1:06:09] and those names sometimes
[1:06:12] influence what we do
[1:06:16] because if they give you a name and your
[1:06:20] name is
[1:06:22] you wouldn't want to be defeated.
[1:06:26] grow up with that in the mind.
[1:06:29] If your name is
[1:06:32] you don't want to be found that you are
[1:06:34] the most forome woman.
[1:06:38] There is a way these names influence us.
[1:06:42] Are you together with me? Yes sir. Your
[1:06:46] names have something to do with the
[1:06:49] divine assignment.
[1:06:53] We shall go into the book of Matthew
[1:06:56] chapter 1 and verse 21.
[1:06:59] The Holy Spirit says
[1:07:02] about Jesus,
[1:07:04] and she shall bring forth a son,
[1:07:08] and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
[1:07:13] What the name Jesus about?
[1:07:17] He shall save his people from their sin.
[1:07:23] giving him a name
[1:07:25] that identifies his divine assignment
[1:07:32] is to be a savior
[1:07:35] of his people.
[1:07:37] So the name Jesus
[1:07:40] defined a divine assignment.
[1:07:45] But then the question is who am I? And
[1:07:49] what's my divine assignment?
[1:07:53] What's my divine commission?
[1:07:57] If I came from God,
[1:08:00] I did not come here on earth to be, you
[1:08:03] know, some kind of a decoration.
[1:08:09] Amen. So that the people who look at me
[1:08:13] would look at how handsome I am
[1:08:17] and would look at how I walk.
[1:08:21] No, there is something more. You are
[1:08:24] here if you came from God
[1:08:28] and divine assignment.
[1:08:32] Amen. Let us go into the book of Genesis
[1:08:36] chapter 17 verse 5.
[1:08:40] Now he's talking to Abraham
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Neither shall thy name
[1:08:46] anymore be called Abraham,
[1:08:52] but thy name shall be called Abraham."
[1:08:58] In that name is the assignment to be a
[1:09:01] father of many nations.
[1:09:06] Are you together with me? So the
[1:09:08] commission
[1:09:10] is defined by the name.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So a name is your divine
[1:09:19] assignment from God,
[1:09:22] your divine character,
[1:09:25] your divine nature.
[1:09:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now I'm not
[1:09:32] talking about your name
[1:09:35] which was given by your father.
[1:09:38] I'm talking about your new name,
[1:09:42] which is not actually new
[1:09:46] because that's what you were before the
[1:09:49] foundation of the world.
[1:09:51] Your name defines your engagement in
[1:09:55] divine things.
[1:10:01] Are you together with me now?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; In the name Abraham
[1:10:07] the divine commission
[1:10:10] to be a father of nations.
[1:10:13] So as I come and you know confess the
[1:10:16] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:20] and then I I'm saved and I'm baptized.
[1:10:25] I receive the bapt of the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:28] When the bas of the Holy Ghost touches
[1:10:31] my life,
[1:10:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:37] becomes a tutor,
[1:10:40] a teacher to train me into my divine
[1:10:46] assignment.
[1:10:51] Praise the Lord. How can I get to know
[1:10:54] what my new name is?
[1:10:57] My divine assignment in the body of
[1:10:59] Christ.
[1:11:02] It is hidden in the white stone.
[1:11:07] Are you together with me? Because a
[1:11:10] stone
[1:11:11] is something to do with revelation.
[1:11:16] Thou art Peter
[1:11:19] and upon this rock,
[1:11:21] meaning upon the revelation of the word.
[1:11:26] For in the word
[1:11:28] is your name, it is hidden in there. So
[1:11:33] to discover who you are, you need to
[1:11:36] bury yourself in the word.
[1:11:41] As you bury yourself in the word,
[1:11:44] you are going to know who you are
[1:11:47] and you don't know yourself as Moses
[1:11:51] because it's your parents who gave you
[1:11:53] that.
[1:11:55] You are defined
[1:11:58] by a holy character
[1:12:00] that God embeds in your life.
[1:12:04] Amen. And as your character
[1:12:08] begins to change
[1:12:10] and working the things of God,
[1:12:13] that's the name.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation chapter 2
[1:12:19] and verse 17.
[1:12:21] He that has an ear,
[1:12:25] meaning he that has got the ability to
[1:12:29] hear from God
[1:12:34] by revelation,
[1:12:36] let him hear what the spirit says that
[1:12:38] the church.
[1:12:41] To him that overcometh
[1:12:43] will I give to eat of the hidden manner,
[1:12:48] and will give him
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; a white stone.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in
[1:12:59] the stone,
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; a written a name written
[1:13:06] is not written on the stone.
[1:13:12] is written in the stone
[1:13:16] and the stone is the revelation of
[1:13:20] Christ you
[1:13:22] amen and that revelation
[1:13:25] comes from here.
[1:13:28] So basically
[1:13:30] the Bible in a way
[1:13:32] is the stone and in
[1:13:36] is where you find your new name.
[1:13:39] So as you keep studying the word
[1:13:43] it keeps influencing your life
[1:13:46] and causing you to do certain divine
[1:13:49] assignments.
[1:13:53] You give up certain things in life.
[1:13:57] And as you keep doing like a you are
[1:14:00] living the life that God ordained
[1:14:05] before the foundation of the world for
[1:14:08] you to live. Let me tell you something.
[1:14:11] When men received the Holy Ghost, there
[1:14:15] are seven on record.
[1:14:18] There are seven men on record.
[1:14:21] Amen. One of them is Paul and then we've
[1:14:25] got all the others like
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; then we've got Martin.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Then we've got Cola.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Then we've got Martin Luther.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Then we've got Wesley.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And we also have William brother.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Seven men.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Now the seventh
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; was able to know who you are.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; But the first six
[1:14:52] They did what they did
[1:14:56] and they didn't know who they were.
[1:14:59] It's only Malachi 4
[1:15:01] tells us who they were.
[1:15:04] But their name was the divine assignment
[1:15:09] which we call them by
[1:15:12] as messengers.
[1:15:16] God help me to bring this out. To him
[1:15:19] that overcomes
[1:15:21] will I give to eat of the hidden man
[1:15:25] and will give him a white stone
[1:15:28] and in a new I mean and in the stone a
[1:15:32] new name
[1:15:35] which no man knoweth saving it that
[1:15:38] receiveth it.
[1:15:43] is a name
[1:15:45] which is personal holder.
[1:15:50] No man can take that name.
[1:15:54] No man can take that character because
[1:15:58] it's a divinely assigned by God
[1:16:03] to lead this person
[1:16:06] to live his life for the purpose of the
[1:16:09] gospel
[1:16:11] in a certain way. Amen. So an overcomer
[1:16:16] that overcomes the selfwill,
[1:16:21] God gives him a hidden manner.
[1:16:26] There was the public manner
[1:16:30] which was picked up by everybody
[1:16:33] and it was good enough for the dead.
[1:16:37] But then there was hidden mana
[1:16:39] which was in the holy of holies.
[1:16:42] Praise the Lord. He says, "He that
[1:16:45] overcome,
[1:16:47] I'll give him to eat of the hidden man.
[1:16:51] I accept him in the inner veil."
[1:16:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I accept him in
[1:16:59] the inner fail.
[1:17:01] He'll be locked behind the the noise of
[1:17:06] the public.
[1:17:09] And then I'm going to have fellowship
[1:17:11] with him.
[1:17:14] And now as I have fellowship with him,
[1:17:18] what I speak to him
[1:17:22] will be hidden manner.
[1:17:25] And it is hidden in this book.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah. So we outgive ourselves
[1:17:32] to the study of the word
[1:17:35] so that God can speak to us about who we
[1:17:39] are.
[1:17:41] Amen.
[1:17:43] God don't speak to us about who we are.
[1:17:48] Amen. And then he says even as he is in
[1:17:52] here,
[1:17:55] he's going to discover his name
[1:17:59] as he keeps himself in the word.
[1:18:02] Now we have known what we mean by name.
[1:18:07] A divine assignment.
[1:18:12] your commission in the body,
[1:18:15] your position in Christ,
[1:18:18] you cannot discover it
[1:18:21] when you keep yourself away from the
[1:18:23] world
[1:18:25] because that's where your divine
[1:18:28] commission is hidden.
[1:18:30] Amen. So now let me tell you something
[1:18:34] that there was mana which came down
[1:18:39] and everybody had ability to collect
[1:18:43] but then there was man which was kept in
[1:18:47] the secret
[1:18:49] special for special men
[1:18:52] and you want to become one of the
[1:18:53] special people
[1:18:55] learn to go into the holy of holies.
[1:18:59] Amen. So now this man
[1:19:02] which we are talking about comes down as
[1:19:06] logos the word
[1:19:09] in the age which you live
[1:19:12] and this man here which is the word is
[1:19:17] broadcast to all
[1:19:20] and everybody who has ears can hear it
[1:19:24] but the elect.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. When he hears together
[1:19:30] with the others
[1:19:33] gets a hidden portion,
[1:19:37] a man which is assigned to him
[1:19:39] individually
[1:19:42] to transform his life
[1:19:45] and that's what you call the rem
[1:19:49] which is the position of revelation
[1:19:53] which is assigned to you personally.
[1:19:56] the personal portion
[1:19:58] of the revealed word and that's where
[1:20:01] you can find your name.
[1:20:05] Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; It shapes you.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, yeah."
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; At the end of this service, if we ask
[1:20:15] people to come forward
[1:20:17] and they start saying something about
[1:20:19] what they
[1:20:22] say
[1:20:25] and all of you will be totally saying
[1:20:28] something different.
[1:20:31] God deals to every man according to the
[1:20:35] way he has called it.
[1:20:40] Are you together with me? Yeah.
[1:20:42] According to the way God has called
[1:20:44] this,
[1:20:46] brother Brandham says
[1:20:48] it also says here
[1:20:52] that he's going to give the overcomer
[1:20:56] in the PGA church.
[1:20:59] is going to give the overcomer
[1:21:02] a white stone
[1:21:04] and in
[1:21:07] not on the white stone a new name which
[1:21:12] the owner alone knows
[1:21:19] that owner receives the joy
[1:21:24] of serving a certain way
[1:21:28] because God
[1:21:30] deals with him on that level.
[1:21:35] Amen. Nobody will force him that we
[1:21:39] didn't see you singing this morning
[1:21:42] because it's on him.
[1:21:46] It is honored in his life.
[1:21:50] Is his own name.
[1:21:53] He has got a joy.
[1:21:56] Are you together with him alone?
[1:21:59] You know, nobody will tell him don't
[1:22:02] miss the I mean the overnight
[1:22:05] because this man here Jesus call upon
[1:22:09] his life.
[1:22:12] Amen. You are not going to blame anybody
[1:22:16] because maybe this man is God in another
[1:22:19] area
[1:22:22] and then God will put a call upon a
[1:22:25] man's heart
[1:22:27] to become a witness
[1:22:30] as we all testify.
[1:22:33] But this man has got a special call.
[1:22:37] It is a joy upon his life.
[1:22:40] He says
[1:22:43] And
[1:22:45] he's going to give the overcomer
[1:22:48] a white stone and in
[1:22:52] not on
[1:22:54] the stone a new name which the owner
[1:22:58] alone knows
[1:23:02] and knowing that a name signifies
[1:23:05] character.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the idea of a new name
[1:23:13] is a familiar one.
[1:23:17] Abraham
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; was changed to Abraham.
[1:23:21] Sarai
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; to Sarah,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Jacob to Israel, Simon to Peter, Saul to
[1:23:31] Paul.
[1:23:33] from the name they were given,
[1:23:36] natural names
[1:23:39] to certain form of names
[1:23:42] which actually pointed to what God had
[1:23:45] called them to do.
[1:23:49] Are you together with me? So these names
[1:23:52] either brought a change
[1:23:57] or were given because of a change.
[1:24:00] It was only after Abraham and Sarah,
[1:24:05] they had their names changed
[1:24:10] by the Lord
[1:24:12] that they were made ready to receive the
[1:24:16] coming son.
[1:24:20] In Jacob's case,
[1:24:23] he had to overcome
[1:24:26] and then he was called a priest.
[1:24:29] [Applause]
[1:24:30] In the case of Simon and Saul,
[1:24:34] when they had received the Lord,
[1:24:37] their change came.
[1:24:40] And today, each one of us,
[1:24:44] a true I mean uh true believers
[1:24:49] has had a change in name.
[1:24:55] We all have a change in name
[1:25:00] from Pentecost Assemblies of God,
[1:25:04] Pentecost Assemblies of God, from Church
[1:25:07] of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints
[1:25:12] or from whatever church that you could
[1:25:14] come to.
[1:25:16] You have now got a new name.
[1:25:20] We are Christians.
[1:25:25] And they were first called Christians
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; in Antioch
[1:25:32] because they were like Christ.
[1:25:36] So their character
[1:25:39] gave them a name. I think you see where
[1:25:42] we are going.
[1:25:44] So but one day we will have another
[1:25:48] change.
[1:25:50] We will over certain receive a new name.
[1:25:55] It could well be that name was our true
[1:26:00] and original name written in the lamb's
[1:26:03] book of life
[1:26:09] from the foundation of the world.
[1:26:11] He knows the name but we do not. one day
[1:26:17] at his good pleasure
[1:26:20] we will know also.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So I want to say that as we are here we
[1:26:30] all have a new name.
[1:26:33] It is in finding God's perfect will.
[1:26:39] Amen. For your life here on earth.
[1:26:43] So, and as you step into the opening of
[1:26:46] the word
[1:26:48] to your age
[1:26:51] with the bas of the Holy Ghost, you step
[1:26:54] into the manifestation of the name.
[1:26:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The name is not
[1:27:00] just coming to us.
[1:27:04] The name is what you have always been
[1:27:06] before God.
[1:27:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But when you
[1:27:11] receive the word,
[1:27:14] for your age and the bas of the Holy
[1:27:16] Ghost. It helps you to manifest that
[1:27:21] character.
[1:27:23] The name we are talking about.
[1:27:27] Amen. Praise the Lord. Listen to what
[1:27:31] brother Brandham says
[1:27:33] in the first city says. And it's only to
[1:27:37] be revealed
[1:27:40] at the last day
[1:27:42] when this actual seal is broken.
[1:27:47] That name broken to who?
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Not to Christ
[1:27:54] but to the church. Notice now. Oh my.
[1:27:59] That just makes me tremble.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I hope that the church truly
[1:28:04] understands.
[1:28:07] You people, I'm going to call you bride.
[1:28:13] Hallelujah.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to call you.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Now from church
[1:28:21] to bride,
[1:28:25] from church to bride.
[1:28:29] But then when you become a bride
[1:28:33] as an individual,
[1:28:35] you've got your personal character.
[1:28:38] You've got your personal character
[1:28:42] the way God designed you to live your
[1:28:44] life.
[1:28:47] We can never be uniform
[1:28:52] from there because we become the body of
[1:28:55] Christ.
[1:28:58] Sometimes the body
[1:29:00] you might be talking about a finger,
[1:29:04] sometimes you are talking about the arm.
[1:29:07] Sometimes you are talking about the ear,
[1:29:10] every one of these members
[1:29:14] special character.
[1:29:16] Are you together with me? Much as we are
[1:29:19] the new name as Christians
[1:29:23] and we've been promoted to being a
[1:29:25] bride,
[1:29:28] we must cut out a personal revelation to
[1:29:31] this message
[1:29:34] that adopts us in divine service
[1:29:39] and we refer to you as a person placed
[1:29:42] in the body.
[1:29:45] our placing in the body,
[1:29:48] your inheritance,
[1:29:50] your individual position in Christ.
[1:29:54] Are you together with me? Yeah. I want
[1:29:56] to tell you something here.
[1:29:59] Maybe I'm trying to bring you so close
[1:30:03] to the subject that you may be able to
[1:30:05] understand.
[1:30:07] Amen. As much as
[1:30:12] an inheritance as a part of Judah
[1:30:16] When he got into the land,
[1:30:19] he reminded Joshua
[1:30:22] which Joshua was a type of the Holy
[1:30:24] Ghost.
[1:30:27] But remember, let me take you to Joshua
[1:30:30] chapter 14. He reminded Joshua
[1:30:34] that much as I am Judah,
[1:30:38] much as I am the bride,
[1:30:41] but there is a personal inheritance for
[1:30:43] me.
[1:30:47] Are you together with me? Yeah. Much as
[1:30:50] we are all given a new name.
[1:30:53] We are now the bride of the Lord Jesus.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We are like now Judah.
[1:31:01] But out of Judah,
[1:31:03] out of you being a bride,
[1:31:06] there must be a calip element
[1:31:10] which has a personal inheritance.
[1:31:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; And you ask,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; give me my mountain,
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; my mountain, my own mountain
[1:31:25] that we gave you as together as the
[1:31:32] give me.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Hallelujah.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Are you going to ask for your mountain?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Your position in the body.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Much as you are
[1:31:43] part of the body,
[1:31:45] but there must be a caliber position.
[1:31:49] The way God calls you, the way God works
[1:31:52] around you, the way God uses you. Amen.
[1:31:56] You must be identified.
[1:31:59] When they went to Job, he says, "I am
[1:32:02] one."
[1:32:04] Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I'm a voice of one man
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; going in the wilderness. He understood
[1:32:12] that the Pharisees
[1:32:14] were not looking for his personal name,
[1:32:18] but the Pharisees
[1:32:20] were looking for the divine assignment.
[1:32:24] John had to tell them who he was by a
[1:32:29] divine assignment. What God had called
[1:32:31] him to do.
[1:32:34] Amen. Joshua chapter 14 and verse 10.
[1:32:39] And now, behold, the Lord has kept me
[1:32:43] alive.
[1:32:45] This is Calb. As he said this 40 and
[1:32:48] five years,
[1:32:53] even since the Lord spake this word unto
[1:32:55] Moses,
[1:32:59] while the children of Israel wandered in
[1:33:01] the wilderness,
[1:33:04] and now, Lord, I am this day for school
[1:33:07] and 5 years.
[1:33:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; As yet I am as strong this day
[1:33:22] as I was in the day that Moses sent me.
[1:33:30] And my strength was
[1:33:32] as my strength was then even so is my
[1:33:36] strength now.
[1:33:41] for war to go
[1:33:45] and to come back. Hallelujah.
[1:33:47] Hallelujah. He says, I feel the same
[1:33:50] strength
[1:33:52] as when Joshua sent me as a spy.
[1:33:57] Hallelujah. To spy the land.
[1:34:01] Hey, he says, "I'm still strong enough
[1:34:05] to go to battle and to come back." He
[1:34:09] had an understanding
[1:34:11] of who you were and what he was.
[1:34:17] Praise the Lord. Now therefore, give me
[1:34:20] this mountain
[1:34:23] whereof the Lord spoke in that day.
[1:34:27] For thou hadest in that day how the
[1:34:30] anarchims well,
[1:34:36] and that the cities were great and
[1:34:38] fierce.
[1:34:41] If be so, the Lord will be with me,
[1:34:47] then I shall be able to drive them out
[1:34:50] as the Lord said.
[1:34:54] And Joshua blessed him.
[1:34:57] and gave unto the son of Jeff Hebron for
[1:35:01] an inheritance.
[1:35:07] Moses come here.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; I want some four people volunteer
[1:35:11] please.
[1:35:15] Come
[1:35:16] and
[1:35:19] come here.
[1:35:21] One more person.
[1:35:24] Now
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; I want to say this is Judah.
[1:35:31] And in Judah
[1:35:33] they've been given their inheritance,
[1:35:37] a land of their own.
[1:35:42] And now everybody
[1:35:44] is part of Judah.
[1:35:48] Are you together with me?
[1:35:50] But then out of Judah
[1:35:52] comes this
[1:35:55] and he says, "Much as we've got the
[1:35:57] general inheritance,
[1:35:59] but I want my personal.
[1:36:02] Give me my mouth.
[1:36:06] We are church.
[1:36:09] We are bride.
[1:36:11] That's our new name.
[1:36:13] We walk as a bride should walk.
[1:36:17] But this here
[1:36:19] He says on top of that,
[1:36:23] give me a new name. Give me a new
[1:36:25] character. Give me a new way of doing
[1:36:28] things.
[1:36:31] I'm not that I'm separating from Judah.
[1:36:34] I am Judah. But I feel there is
[1:36:38] something personal that I must possess.
[1:36:42] Amen. So you already here.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; You've been given a new name.
[1:36:48] You've been called church and out of
[1:36:51] church you can be called bride.
[1:36:54] Amen. Like all the others from being a
[1:36:58] bride.
[1:36:59] Who am I
[1:37:03] person? Who am I?
[1:37:05] What has God called me to do
[1:37:09] as an individual to sit in the church
[1:37:12] enjoy the services? Who am I?
[1:37:17] Yeah,
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; that's
[1:37:24] when we talk about the age of
[1:37:28] we are talking about the age where all
[1:37:31] the people are recognizing who they are.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I want to see this
[1:37:46] morning
[1:37:48] identifying themselves.
[1:37:51] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's go to a high
[1:37:54] octave here.
[1:37:56] So we are looking at personal
[1:37:59] inheritance here
[1:38:02] which I'm calling a personal name,
[1:38:06] a personal calling, a personal
[1:38:08] character,
[1:38:10] a portion of the word that identifies
[1:38:13] you as an individual gift to the body of
[1:38:17] Christ.
[1:38:19] Amen. Because you ate from the word
[1:38:23] to be identified as bread.
[1:38:26] Amen. It was given to us all.
[1:38:30] We are bread but yet in the bride you
[1:38:34] are there. What's your position
[1:38:38] of Christ?
[1:38:41] Who am I? This goes far above the titles
[1:38:44] we hold.
[1:38:47] Either pastor so and so
[1:38:50] so and so. This is God identifying you
[1:38:54] by your divine assignment that you did
[1:38:57] the B.
[1:39:00] Amen. It goes beyond
[1:39:04] the status we hold in each other.
[1:39:07] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:39:11] The Pharisees
[1:39:12] understood that God called men.
[1:39:16] The God called men
[1:39:19] were only known
[1:39:21] by given names.
[1:39:24] Amen.
[1:39:26] God given names.
[1:39:29] And these names
[1:39:32] were not John
[1:39:37] the son
[1:39:38] of Zechariah.
[1:39:42] No.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:45] They wanted to see what is your divine
[1:39:49] assignment.
[1:39:52] What did God call you to do?
[1:39:56] What's your name?
[1:40:01] I
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; I want to break this mystery here.
[1:40:05] Who are you?
[1:40:08] You are here,
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; but who are you?
[1:40:12] You see much, let me tell you about
[1:40:15] Moses again
[1:40:17] that much as the vision of the
[1:40:19] tabernacle was given to Moses
[1:40:24] for him to bring that vision
[1:40:29] to manifestation.
[1:40:32] He needed men who had divine abilities
[1:40:36] given to them.
[1:40:43] Are you together with me?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Moses was spiritual.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Moses could speak to God.
[1:40:51] Moses could see visions.
[1:40:53] And he saw the vision.
[1:40:56] Amen. Of the tabernacle.
[1:40:58] So what?
[1:41:01] Moses is leading a nation
[1:41:04] which is a church. But then they needed
[1:41:08] men.
[1:41:10] that had the ability
[1:41:13] to bring to presence of manifestation
[1:41:18] the vision that Moses had seen.
[1:41:23] And that's why I said this morning
[1:41:26] the pastor
[1:41:28] needs you so much to build this church.
[1:41:34] You may you know he may have the vision.
[1:41:38] He may know what he wants to achieve.
[1:41:41] He cannot achieve it without special men
[1:41:46] assembly.
[1:41:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:52] Not just to be another church member.
[1:41:57] Praise the Lord. Who are you?
[1:42:00] Let's go to Exod 31
[1:42:03] and look at what I'm saying.
[1:42:06] Do you like the teaching of the word?
[1:42:09] Yes.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; So, Exod 31:1,
[1:42:15] and the Lord said unto Moses, saying,
[1:42:21] he has already shown him the vision
[1:42:24] of the tabernacle.
[1:42:26] He has given him the measurement.
[1:42:29] He has given him the nature of the
[1:42:31] materials.
[1:42:34] But then God tells him
[1:42:37] among the men in the camp,
[1:42:43] among the men that are in the church,
[1:42:47] I have called by name.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Meaning I have
[1:42:55] called
[1:42:58] with certain divine ability.
[1:43:03] Amen. The son of Yuri,
[1:43:06] the son of Y of the tribe of Judah. And
[1:43:10] I have
[1:43:12] filled him with the spirit of God
[1:43:16] in wisdom and in understanding and in
[1:43:20] knowledge and in all manner of work of
[1:43:22] God.
[1:43:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To deise
[1:43:28] the coming works
[1:43:31] to work in gold
[1:43:34] and in silver and in brass and in
[1:43:38] cutting of stones
[1:43:41] set them
[1:43:43] of timber to work in all man of work.
[1:43:51] So
[1:43:53] without
[1:43:56] the vision
[1:43:58] of Moses of the tabernacle
[1:44:02] could not come into existence
[1:44:06] without being anointed
[1:44:10] by the I mean to be anointed by the
[1:44:14] abilities of divining cunning works.
[1:44:18] After
[1:44:21] there were certain aspects
[1:44:23] of Moses tabernacle
[1:44:26] that could not come into existence.
[1:44:30] There is a reason why you are what you
[1:44:33] are
[1:44:34] in this local assembly
[1:44:37] and be found doing your part.
[1:44:42] If God called you to be a deacon,
[1:44:45] be honestly a deacon.
[1:44:49] Don't carry a title.
[1:44:51] There was a certain rich man.
[1:44:54] You should have a name attached to
[1:44:58] the practice of the office.
[1:45:01] Amen. If he has called you a trustee,
[1:45:05] if he has called you to be a song
[1:45:07] leader,
[1:45:09] he has not called you to come here and
[1:45:12] recite songs.
[1:45:21] You recite songs.
[1:45:25] You are called because you have got a
[1:45:28] certain special ability.
[1:45:33] Amen. Be faithfully found in your
[1:45:35] position
[1:45:39] and you are trading your talent
[1:45:43] even if you got what?
[1:45:45] That's what God has given. Tread it.
[1:45:49] Tread it.
[1:45:51] Amen. So, we've had this kind of
[1:45:54] background.
[1:45:56] So, let's go now to the scripture
[1:46:00] in John chapter one.
[1:46:02] Verse 19 where we were.
[1:46:06] And this is the record of John
[1:46:09] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[1:46:12] from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who art
[1:46:15] thou?"
[1:46:23] And he confessed
[1:46:26] and denied not, but confessed, "I am not
[1:46:30] the Christ."
[1:46:32] because he knew what the Pharisees were
[1:46:36] looking.
[1:46:38] He says, "I'm not what you think.
[1:46:41] I cannot take another man's place.
[1:46:45] Are you together with me?" If we can be
[1:46:48] as honest
[1:46:51] as more I mean this man who was honest
[1:46:56] and you know God called me to be a
[1:46:58] deacon.
[1:47:00] There is no way I can be a pastor.
[1:47:03] We would have stable churches.
[1:47:08] If God has called you to be a song
[1:47:12] leader, there's no reason why you claim
[1:47:16] to go and become a deacon.
[1:47:19] He says, you know, he confessed. He
[1:47:22] denied not and said, I am not the
[1:47:25] Christ. That's not my position. God will
[1:47:30] always bless you when you find your
[1:47:33] position in the body.
[1:47:38] You don't take another man's place.
[1:47:42] And they asked him what then at thous
[1:47:47] you know those were great name
[1:47:50] but he could not take on those name
[1:47:56] in the body. Amen. And he said I am not
[1:48:01] at thou that prophet.
[1:48:05] And he said, "No,
[1:48:07] I'm not Malachi 4 that comes after
[1:48:11] grace.
[1:48:13] No, I'm not." And said they unto him,
[1:48:17] "Who art thou?"
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; That we may give an answer to them that
[1:48:22] sent us
[1:48:25] thou of thy soul.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; He say,
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; "I am."
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[1:48:37] We are not talking about natural names.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; We are talking about the character
[1:48:45] of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:48] in your life.
[1:48:51] Amen. Who are you?
[1:48:54] Are you a prayer warrior?
[1:48:57] Are you an apostle?
[1:49:00] Are you one who shows mercy?
[1:49:04] Are you out there to pray for people?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; What has God placed in your life?
[1:49:13] You see, he said, "I am
[1:49:17] the voice of one
[1:49:20] crying in the wilderness."
[1:49:23] John knew his divine assignment.
[1:49:27] I am a voice
[1:49:29] of one crying from the wilderness.
[1:49:33] Amen. So each age
[1:49:36] had its message
[1:49:40] and he had its messengers
[1:49:43] and all through the time
[1:49:46] every age has packed its message
[1:49:51] with a messenger.
[1:49:55] God in every dispensation
[1:49:58] has sent forth some anointed
[1:50:02] with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his
[1:50:07] message every time.
[1:50:10] He packs them.
[1:50:14] He anoints them. He anointed
[1:50:18] in a special way. No man would try to do
[1:50:22] what he was doing.
[1:50:26] because it was supposed to be an
[1:50:28] anointing.
[1:50:31] Amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; But out of the dispensation of voice to
[1:50:35] the earth,
[1:50:38] still God
[1:50:40] has heard
[1:50:42] some calyps
[1:50:45] who had the personal inheritance
[1:50:49] of what God was doing in that day.
[1:50:53] apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers,
[1:50:57] evangelists, God calling them and
[1:51:00] anointing them off of the message of the
[1:51:03] hour.
[1:51:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. And even as the
[1:51:10] ministers teach
[1:51:13] even their local churches,
[1:51:15] the same grace
[1:51:17] without anointing certain people.
[1:51:21] That's why Paul says having then gifts
[1:51:24] defering according to the grace
[1:51:28] that is given to us. Hallelujah. Then he
[1:51:32] says prophecy
[1:51:34] ministry like apostles.
[1:51:38] He says first apostles,
[1:51:40] secondly prophets, thirdly teachers,
[1:51:44] evangelists,
[1:51:45] pastors. And then he says, "He that
[1:51:48] exaltth,
[1:51:50] he that giveth,
[1:51:52] he that ruleth,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; and he that even showeth mercy,
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; all those that give, they only just drop
[1:52:02] off as anointings from the age.
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:08] Amen. So let me give you some powerful
[1:52:10] statements from brother.
[1:52:13] Are you together with me?
[1:52:19] from the name
[1:52:21] then names
[1:52:25] I'll call you bride
[1:52:28] but out of there
[1:52:31] everybody has got a name has got a
[1:52:35] character has got a nature has got a
[1:52:38] commission has got a way the ghost uses
[1:52:47] Brother Brham says, "Now the thing for
[1:52:50] every individual to find
[1:52:56] is his place in God.
[1:52:59] What God has called you to do
[1:53:03] and then abide in that place."
[1:53:09] Okay? You take these little children
[1:53:13] who's been wandering from church to
[1:53:15] church
[1:53:18] and from place to place and positionally
[1:53:21] place them
[1:53:24] by the Holy Spirit tonight in their
[1:53:27] position in Christ.
[1:53:31] Then he says we all have different
[1:53:35] makeups.
[1:53:38] If we would just find our position in
[1:53:40] Christ
[1:53:42] and they abide
[1:53:45] and serve him,
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; who am I?
[1:53:50] Lord help me. Who am I?
[1:53:55] Let's go to adoption message.
[1:53:58] He says,
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; but the purpose of this
[1:54:02] is seeing your position in Christ.
[1:54:09] Seeing that is not something that you
[1:54:11] just stumbled into
[1:54:14] or something that you might have merited
[1:54:17] somewhere,
[1:54:22] but it's what God
[1:54:24] did for you himself.
[1:54:27] Not that you were so good
[1:54:30] that you went to a church one night
[1:54:33] that some poor brother led you up to the
[1:54:35] altar.
[1:54:38] It wasn't there. It was God before the
[1:54:42] foundation of the world
[1:54:45] you to
[1:54:48] amen. So your divine assignment
[1:54:53] is what holds your new name.
[1:55:00] Find your position
[1:55:02] and abide
[1:55:04] like a John. He knew he was. I am a
[1:55:08] voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[1:55:14] Who am I?
[1:55:20] And yet you are something.
[1:55:24] But how can you know who you are?
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; It's hidden in the word.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Can I encourage you a little bit?
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Iranians didn't know he was.
[1:55:38] He just kept in the word and doing what
[1:55:41] he saw in the word.
[1:55:43] Martin didn't know he was. He just kept
[1:55:46] in the word and not doing what he said.
[1:55:50] And finally at the end they were
[1:55:53] identified
[1:55:55] by the eagle anointing
[1:55:58] when Malachi 4 paraded them and told us.
[1:56:05] So that's what you are just have faith
[1:56:09] as you study the word whatever the Holy
[1:56:12] Ghost is leading you
[1:56:14] do it faithfully.
[1:56:16] Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Do it faithfully
[1:56:20] knowing that is the leadership of the
[1:56:23] Holy Spirit.
[1:56:26] Amen. The Holy Spirit makes you a wife.
[1:56:31] Be a faithful one.
[1:56:34] There
[1:56:36] makes you a business manager.
[1:56:40] Be a faithful one. God bless you there.
[1:56:44] At the end of the day, your life will
[1:56:47] end up testifying to somebody.
[1:56:51] That's the way God work.
[1:56:54] Amen. Find your position and abide.
[1:56:57] John says, I am the voice of one.
[1:57:01] I am not imitating anyone.
[1:57:04] I am cut this way.
[1:57:07] That's what I am. I am a voice of one.
[1:57:12] I'm not an imitation,
[1:57:15] but I have found the will of God
[1:57:18] in my life.
[1:57:21] Can't you say amen to that?
[1:57:24] When you have found your position in
[1:57:26] Christ,
[1:57:29] God creates a special design
[1:57:34] in every elect
[1:57:37] so that they can operate a certain way.
[1:57:41] have called Bezar
[1:57:44] by name.
[1:57:48] Praise the Lord. No man will ever be
[1:57:50] like me.
[1:57:52] And there's nobody who has ever been
[1:57:54] like me.
[1:57:57] There's nobody who will be like you.
[1:58:00] And there's nobody who has ever been
[1:58:02] like
[1:58:05] one of us. In the Lamb's book of life
[1:58:09] have a special design.
[1:58:13] Amen. He designs your perception
[1:58:19] and perception
[1:58:21] is the way to see things a certain way.
[1:58:26] So he gives you a mind
[1:58:29] that thinks a certain direction
[1:58:34] special perception
[1:58:37] and by that perception
[1:58:40] you become a blessing to the body.
[1:58:44] Amen. So John the B said I am one.
[1:58:49] And therefore God dealt with him in a
[1:58:53] particular perception.
[1:58:56] He saw things in that direction.
[1:59:00] Therefore he said things in a certain
[1:59:02] way
[1:59:04] different from the rest of the people.
[1:59:08] He held views
[1:59:13] relevant to that season.
[1:59:17] That's what a call is,
[1:59:22] brother. Brother read something in the
[1:59:24] paper.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If there is a need
[1:59:32] of some kind,
[1:59:34] there will be somebody thirsty
[1:59:38] to fulfill that need.
[1:59:41] that circle
[1:59:45] you just see somebody
[1:59:48] step forward being anointed
[1:59:51] being capable
[1:59:53] doing certain things and you wonder but
[1:59:57] that's a call
[2:00:00] amen
[2:00:01] I'll give you a simple example here
[2:00:04] brother Brandham read a paper
[2:00:08] and he says uh in the message expect
[2:00:13] He says a year or two years ago
[2:00:19] where a little baby had eat
[2:00:23] the rasses of the pencil.
[2:00:26] He ate the pedals of a bicycle.
[2:00:31] They say what's the matter with the
[2:00:33] child?
[2:00:35] The doctor examined
[2:00:38] and take an analysis of this blood.
[2:00:41] and come out with a fine.
[2:00:44] He needed sulfur.
[2:00:48] Are you together with me? There's sulfur
[2:00:51] in rubber,
[2:00:57] a deep
[2:01:00] calling to the deep.
[2:01:02] See what I mean?
[2:01:04] If there is a call,
[2:01:07] there is a call here for self,
[2:01:12] there's got to be somewhere
[2:01:18] to respond for it.
[2:01:23] Are you together with me? If there is a
[2:01:26] need
[2:01:27] which I believe there are needs.
[2:01:32] Amen. The pastor was crying last Sunday
[2:01:36] about young people that should come up
[2:01:41] and be able to stand in certain gaps.
[2:01:44] We have gaps in this church.
[2:01:47] There's a deep and the other deep is
[2:01:51] you. Who am I?
[2:01:56] To every elect,
[2:01:58] there is a call
[2:02:01] that's general.
[2:02:03] as the bride of Christ.
[2:02:06] Amen. That's to live the life of being a
[2:02:09] Christian.
[2:02:11] As a bride, Christianity
[2:02:14] is our general inheritance.
[2:02:18] Like a caliber, the inheritance of
[2:02:20] Judah.
[2:02:25] But then out of Judah
[2:02:27] Calb steps up, give me my mouth.
[2:02:35] You see the message
[2:02:37] will make a lot of sense
[2:02:40] if we don't come to church
[2:02:43] just listen to the preacher.
[2:02:47] If back in our home,
[2:02:51] we are buried in the word, we listen to
[2:02:54] the tapes and we feed
[2:02:58] in a personal perspective,
[2:03:02] God reveals
[2:03:05] who you are.
[2:03:07] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:12] Now
[2:03:13] I want to paint a picture
[2:03:17] of a Christian.
[2:03:19] We have seen the picture
[2:03:22] of Judah.
[2:03:23] We want to paint a picture of what a
[2:03:27] church is
[2:03:29] where God is going to find some calip
[2:03:35] and assign them
[2:03:38] by his grace.
[2:03:41] Listen
[2:03:43] in invisible union.
[2:03:46] I want to name three
[2:03:50] things here
[2:03:52] that she must not get away from.
[2:03:57] Amen.
[2:04:00] Keep the church in mind.
[2:04:04] While I'm speaking to the natural woman,
[2:04:10] remember our last service on the bind
[2:04:14] behind the invisible union.
[2:04:17] She has a sacred trust of virtue
[2:04:21] committed to her.
[2:04:27] Nothing else holds it but a woman.
[2:04:32] She must not defile that party.
[2:04:37] We are trying to understand now the
[2:04:40] church body
[2:04:43] out of which God He's
[2:04:47] going to call a John the Baptist.
[2:04:51] He's going to call a Calip
[2:04:54] who understands his personal position.
[2:04:59] And he says she has a sacred trust of
[2:05:03] virtue committed to her.
[2:05:09] Then he says, "God gave her that virtue
[2:05:14] just as it was in the garden of Eden.
[2:05:18] She can say yes
[2:05:20] or no. She has a sacred trust of
[2:05:24] womanhood,
[2:05:26] committed to her that she must not
[2:05:30] break.
[2:05:31] The womanhood I'm speaking of here
[2:05:35] is her conduct.
[2:05:38] her character around men,
[2:05:43] not letting every man.
[2:05:48] Did you get that?
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; So the bride
[2:05:53] is supposed to conduct herself
[2:05:55] jealously.
[2:05:59] She should be found
[2:06:02] being jealousy.
[2:06:05] Amen. guarding the position of her
[2:06:08] husband.
[2:06:11] Thus, the church is jealously guarding
[2:06:15] the position.
[2:06:19] A Christian
[2:06:21] has sacred trust in Christ.
[2:06:25] Men who have seen who they are
[2:06:28] and they protect.
[2:06:31] Amen. They don't take that into
[2:06:34] different wild ways of life.
[2:06:40] Amen. They don't go to the nightclubs.
[2:06:43] It is a sacred trust.
[2:06:47] Amen. She doesn't let every woman
[2:06:51] every man.
[2:06:53] She has a husband
[2:06:55] and that is Christ.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. She has her
[2:07:00] husband
[2:07:01] and that's the work. She just doesn't
[2:07:04] let every man,
[2:07:08] every doctrine, every organization,
[2:07:12] she has a sacred trust.
[2:07:15] You have a sacred trust.
[2:07:18] Yeah. I'm trying to show you
[2:07:21] now the kind of inheritance, the nature,
[2:07:24] the character of the bride.
[2:07:30] out of that pride.
[2:07:32] Then God begins to anoint Calbs for
[2:07:35] particular services.
[2:07:40] Amen.
[2:07:42] Now he says some of these women looks on
[2:07:46] the screens
[2:07:52] and see these movies stars kissing
[2:07:58] and hugging
[2:08:01] and sloping around over these women.
[2:08:06] I mean sloping around. You know
[2:08:13] over these women
[2:08:15] a woman that does that
[2:08:18] is of a bad character.
[2:08:21] So a true housewife
[2:08:24] should not spend time
[2:08:28] on those
[2:08:31] you know films.
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:39] No
[2:08:41] sacred trust.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; That's the bride.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Because without which
[2:08:50] they pick a spirit from it,
[2:08:55] but you are consecrating yourself
[2:08:58] for the service of the Lord.
[2:09:01] Amen. Amen. Yeah. Now
[2:09:04] keep the church in mind.
[2:09:08] She's kissing and slopping
[2:09:13] and messing around in everything else.
[2:09:20] But the word
[2:09:24] letting the devil
[2:09:26] and education
[2:09:28] and scientific searches
[2:09:31] and so forth.
[2:09:34] and it takes you away.
[2:09:38] You spend your time
[2:09:40] far from the voice of your husband.
[2:09:44] You don't have fellowship with him
[2:09:47] to identify
[2:09:50] yourself with him.
[2:09:53] Amen. So there was sacred trust
[2:09:59] and the second character
[2:10:01] is sacred womanhood.
[2:10:07] So sacred womanhood
[2:10:10] must not be discredit
[2:10:14] discredited.
[2:10:19] Praise the Lord. So the natural woman
[2:10:24] Just like the bride of Christ
[2:10:27] must guide her character.
[2:10:31] Her body
[2:10:33] must be carried in honor.
[2:10:38] Her way of dressing
[2:10:40] must respect her body.
[2:10:44] There's a form of dressing
[2:10:46] that does not belong
[2:10:50] for a Christian woman.
[2:10:54] And when we talk about this dressing,
[2:10:57] we are talking about the dressing of the
[2:10:59] word.
[2:11:03] You are properly dressed
[2:11:06] by the garments of his promised work.
[2:11:11] Are you together with me? You don't just
[2:11:13] go and get anything
[2:11:16] which describes you
[2:11:19] as a wife of Christ. Listen,
[2:11:24] Proverbs chapter 7
[2:11:27] verse 4. Solomon
[2:11:30] is advising his son.
[2:11:34] If you happen, you know, say amen
[2:11:36] somewhere.
[2:11:38] Amen. Amen. Verse four says, "Say unto
[2:11:41] wisdom,
[2:11:43] thou art my sister,
[2:11:45] and call understanding thy kins woman,
[2:11:50] that they may keep thee from the strange
[2:11:53] woman,
[2:11:56] from the stranger which flatterth with
[2:11:59] her word."
[2:12:04] For at the window of my house,
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; I looked through my casemate,
[2:12:14] and I beheld among the simple ones. I
[2:12:18] descended among the youth a young man
[2:12:21] void of understanding.
[2:12:33] passing through the street near her
[2:12:35] corner.
[2:12:39] And he walked the way to her house,
[2:12:45] in the twilight, in the evening, in the
[2:12:48] black and dark night.
[2:12:55] And behold, there met him a woman
[2:12:59] with the attire of a prostitute
[2:13:04] and still at heart.
[2:13:10] That woman
[2:13:12] did not have sacrih.
[2:13:19] Amen.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; The
[2:13:23] is so bad to her character.
[2:13:28] short,
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; tight,
[2:13:32] transparent,
[2:13:34] lower to the front,
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; bad in everything.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Bad in everything.
[2:13:42] And yet Solomon says,
[2:13:46] "Praise the Lord. She had the attire
[2:13:51] of a prostitute.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; God have mercy.
[2:13:59] On the way we adorn ourselves
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; in the promised word of this hour
[2:14:09] that we may keep it straight
[2:14:12] and our sisters
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:17] there is a dressing of
[2:14:20] don't try
[2:14:24] don't try it
[2:14:29] You know, so the way she's not
[2:14:31] protecting her womanhood,
[2:14:35] that what Solomon is saying,
[2:14:39] womanhood doesn't work like that.
[2:14:43] And then the third virtue here
[2:14:47] is sacred motherhood,
[2:14:52] sacred trust,
[2:14:55] secret womanhood
[2:14:58] and sacred motherhood.
[2:15:03] Listen now I'm talking about n the
[2:15:06] nature and character of the bride.
[2:15:13] And brother Brham says when I speak
[2:15:16] about this woman
[2:15:19] see the church
[2:15:21] that's preparing herself
[2:15:25] and out of her
[2:15:27] comes a people with a new name.
[2:15:34] Have you heard me?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Notice
[2:15:38] that's committed to her. That's the
[2:15:40] third virtue.
[2:15:44] Sacred virtue,
[2:15:47] sacred womanhood,
[2:15:50] sacred motherhood,
[2:15:52] honor her husband,
[2:15:55] sacred virtue. Amen.
[2:15:58] Amen. So bad dressing by woman dishonors
[2:16:02] her body.
[2:16:06] Amen. This is the quote now.
[2:16:10] as a woman has a sacred responsibility
[2:16:14] to her motherhood.
[2:16:20] Now listen here the word church when I
[2:16:24] say woman
[2:16:28] as a woman has a sacred responsibility
[2:16:33] to her motherhood
[2:16:36] to her virtue
[2:16:38] to her husband. The church has a sacred
[2:16:42] responsibility
[2:16:46] to prayer to the word and to Christ just
[2:16:51] the same as the woman has.
[2:16:54] But we need to train
[2:16:57] our virtuous areas
[2:17:00] as born sons that make the bride
[2:17:04] to be found in prayer
[2:17:07] to be found in the word
[2:17:10] and to really have constant fellowship
[2:17:12] with Christ.
[2:17:15] Those three things now. So in teaching
[2:17:18] on adoption
[2:17:20] in the message here him brother Brham
[2:17:24] says now here is where I think that
[2:17:27] Pentecostal church made their mistake
[2:17:32] when that son was born into the family.
[2:17:37] He was a son at birth.
[2:17:41] I want to say all of you are sons and
[2:17:46] daughters of God.
[2:17:49] God knows you. You were in the book, but
[2:17:53] he wants to work on you so that you may
[2:17:56] be able to bring forth the manifestation
[2:17:59] of your name.
[2:18:02] Amen. But his inheritance
[2:18:05] was not yet determined.
[2:18:08] It depended
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; on his character.
[2:18:16] The inheritance
[2:18:18] depended on his character
[2:18:23] depended on those three things.
[2:18:26] Sacred trust,
[2:18:28] secret womanhood,
[2:18:30] secret you know virtue,
[2:18:34] which means that we need to marry
[2:18:37] ourselves
[2:18:40] to prayer
[2:18:42] to the word and a constant fellowship
[2:18:45] with Christ.
[2:18:47] Therefore,
[2:18:49] character determines your personal
[2:18:51] inheritance
[2:18:55] so that you may stand out like a John
[2:18:57] the Baptist
[2:19:00] from all the entire body
[2:19:04] of Christ and you have found your place,
[2:19:09] your position, and you say, "I am one.
[2:19:13] [Applause]
[2:19:15] I'm not here as an imitation.
[2:19:19] I am not. You become a character that
[2:19:21] pulls the body a certain way.
[2:19:28] You start seeing things in a certain
[2:19:30] perspective.
[2:19:32] And when you begin to share what God is
[2:19:35] showing you
[2:19:37] because you have come to a particular
[2:19:39] form
[2:19:41] of manifestation,
[2:19:43] it begins to bless the body.
[2:19:46] And that's how we recognize our gift.
[2:19:51] And that's now how we can show the
[2:19:53] manifestation of who we are.
[2:19:57] You may be poor in the world's goods,
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; but you'll be a voice
[2:20:04] in the wilderness.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; A voice
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; that's dressed in the word.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[2:20:15] Who am I?
[2:20:19] I'm part of the body,
[2:20:21] but God, what do you want me to do?
[2:20:26] What do you want me to be?
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you,
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; you may never know,
[2:20:38] but
[2:20:39] it is hidden in the world.
[2:20:42] One day at a time,
[2:20:45] shows you one thing,
[2:20:47] you do that. Tomorrow, you see another
[2:20:50] thing. You do that. the other day you
[2:20:54] you know and you may never know until
[2:20:57] when trouble come
[2:21:01] to you and call you mighty man of valor
[2:21:08] and then will begin to wonder
[2:21:12] the least of my family
[2:21:14] what is the list in the tribe how mighty
[2:21:17] can I be he kept himself in the world
[2:21:21] doing the little thing
[2:21:24] in ministry is not doing big things but
[2:21:28] finding out that God needs me.
[2:21:34] God can anoint you today when you come
[2:21:37] down here. You are not competing with
[2:21:39] anybody doing the will of God.
[2:21:46] Amen.
[2:21:47] We need people who will stand
[2:21:50] because we already on the way out.
[2:21:54] Amen. So it's now your generation
[2:22:00] unless you go in
[2:22:02] this tabernacle
[2:22:04] might not be complete.
[2:22:07] We need a somewhere.

[2:22:13] that anointed.
[2:22:16] Amen.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; So we should learn to wait on our
[2:22:22] ministry.
[2:22:24] Paul says all ministry,
[2:22:28] let us wait on our ministry.
[2:22:32] Or he that teacheth
[2:22:34] on teaching,
[2:22:36] or he that exaltth
[2:22:38] on exaltation. He that giveth,
[2:22:42] let him do it with simplicity.
[2:22:45] He that ruleth
[2:22:47] with diligence, he that showeth mercy,
[2:22:51] with cheerfulness,
[2:22:53] and the real true Christian,
[2:22:56] the real believer in God waits upon the
[2:23:00] Lord for these things.
[2:23:07] Amen. So wait on your ministry.
[2:23:11] I feel a call be sure that it is God.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; I'm doing this because I feel
[2:23:20] there is a need for people to stand in
[2:23:24] the gap in certain areas.
[2:23:29] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:23:32] do you love him?
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; John, who are you?
[2:23:41] He knew who he was. Straight. I'm a
[2:23:45] voice of one crying in the
[2:23:48] but who are you?
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; They were not looking for the physical
[2:23:51] name
[2:23:54] but the position
[2:23:56] in the body that God has revealed to you
[2:24:02] and uses you in that position.
[2:24:10] Who am I?
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; You see what I mean?
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Your position
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; knew that beyond being a part of Judah,
[2:24:28] I must have a personal position.
[2:24:33] A part of me being a part of the bride
[2:24:37] and I have sacred trust.
[2:24:40] I've got sacred womanhood.
[2:24:43] I've got sacred virtue.
[2:24:46] I behave like a bride.
[2:24:49] That is good. But what's my position in
[2:24:53] the body?
[2:24:57] The answer is
[2:25:01] you may never know.
[2:25:04] But as long as you get married to the
[2:25:06] word,
[2:25:08] And every little thing that you see in
[2:25:11] the world,
[2:25:13] you perform it. You become a
[2:25:17] mighty man of valor.
[2:25:21] God bless you.
[2:25:25] We give the Lord a hand of praise.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[2:25:37] We shall continue
[2:25:40] answering the question
[2:25:42] from different directions.

[2:25:49] the next time I'm here?
[2:25:52] I'm not I'm going to tell you that you
[2:25:55] don't craft yourself.
[2:26:00] I have called by name.
[2:26:05] So there is a call
[2:26:07] upon your life.
[2:26:10] You just need the grace of God
[2:26:13] to reveal it.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Let these sisters come over here again.

[2:26:31] is something special.
[2:26:34] Who am I?
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[2:26:42] That's a very important thing
[2:26:47] to know who you are in the body of
[2:26:50] Christ.
[2:26:52] The eagles, the young eagles should be
[2:26:55] quick.
[2:26:59] Not slow,
[2:27:01] fast.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Would you want to know your name?
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; We shall deal with that.

[2:51:27] I've been reminded
[2:51:31] there's a concern from the the deon
[2:51:35] board.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; A concern
[2:51:40] And this goes to the mothers.
[2:51:48] We are kindly requesting the mothers
[2:51:53] to do their best
[2:51:56] and ensure that we are not blocking the
[2:51:59] toilet system
[2:52:05] with the diapers of the babies.
[2:52:10] You can just put them right outside
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; or we have a a place we burn them right
[2:52:18] at the pit.
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; So it it helps us because when our
[2:52:25] systems are blocked then we are not able
[2:52:27] to use them very well
[2:52:32] and it also lessens on the costs as a
[2:52:35] church.
[2:52:38] Canisa.
[2:52:44] [Music]
[2:52:57] Just make one more announcement.
[2:53:02] [Music]
