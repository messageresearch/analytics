Luke Chapter 22. reading from verse 28 to verse 34. so the Bible says you are they which have contained with me in my Temptations and I appoint unto you a kingdom as my father has appointed unto me that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan as desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not and when you are converted strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and they say I tell the Peter the shall not crawl this day before that thou Hast the right deny that thou knowest me name where is foreign foreign foreign he says but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not okay this is strengthen thy Brethren so I want to preach on strengthen thy brethrens for maybe about one hour oh God it's good to be gracious strengthen thy Brethren praise the name of Allah now in the seven Church age books in the exposition of the seven churches the sadian church Age The Prophet says Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die every attack now the ideas expressed in the two words to watch contains not only the idea of being awake teach together but to be alert Ori William nada to be otherwise instinuates danger and loss to strengthen means more than just to give strength it means to fix and establish for permanency these two commands refer to what is left of the truth which itself is really all about to die for praise the name of our Lord let me jump there says strengthen yourself now in what you have left in such a manner as to permanently establish what you have and ensure against future loss this word strengthen here which we have read in Luke chapter 20 verse 32. it means to establish together [Music] so in other words if God has fixed you in a certain position you need to be established you need to be steady fast like now in this end of the sadistan church it was you know the age of you know bringing back the truth praise the name of our Lord it was the age of Martin Luther where he preached they just shall live by faith and they just shall live by faith was a measure of light that age received you know during that the time of Martin Luther Martin Luther the Catholic church was teaching that salvation is by works and punishing yourself God reveals to Martin Luther and tells him that they just shall live by faith and that was the light that God permitted in that day so now the holy spirit is telling them hold the farm that which you have received you know the Revelation that has come to you and of course we know that the Revelation has gone further than that because when we look at the Philadelphian Church there was sanctification the father Revelation and then we come now to the Lord this year and then we see the Pentecostal moves the restoration of gifts it was a higher Revelation now we are living in a different day the word of God has been fully restored we have got the full revelation of the world so now as we have got the full revelation of the world we need to be established in the present truth praise the name of our Lord you need to be established in the present truth um no you're not going to be tossed to and fro many things that are coming up in different understandings that are coming up so to strengthens you know you need to be established you need to be found which you have received praise the name of our Lord and this is what the Lord wants us to do is that we dwell or we be established how then we need to be established in what we have received praise the name of our Lord when you hear the word of God you have received the word of the Lord how do you handle the word of God that's now the thing how do you handle the word of God and you see when you receive the word of God you need to receive the word of God out of a pure heart and then the Bible says God will not despise such a heart in Psalms 51. and then verse 16. for the desire is not sacrifice else I would give it for though the lightest not in bad offering um the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh God though will not despise so that's the heart that God wants and then verse 1. therefore saying we've received this ministry as we have received the mercy we faint not foreign foreign but by manifestation of Truth commanding ourselves one to every man is conscious in the sight of God oh sorry last verse 3. amazing there is now so he says we have Twitter things you know you know you are not working in craftiness when we receive the word of God we need to have such Humble Hearts that we obey the word of God you know because our hearts are the ground our hearts at the ground you know and there are four kinds of grounds there is the West Side Hearts the heart which is like a west side in a good ground one [Music] Colossians chapter 1 Colossians chapter 1 and verse 10. the Bible says let us start from verse 10 verse 9. for this course we also since the day we had it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding okay that you might walk worthy of the Lord and to all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God okay foreign strengthened with all might according to his glorious power and to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness um no um no I mean he says the desire is a commands that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding and that you walk praise the name of our Lord You Have Known the way of the Lord so then the thing is if you have known the way of the Lord you need to walk in that way of the Lord so he says you've known that way then you walk in that way so it says that you may walk worthy before the Lord in other words whatever you are doing you're doing it from the bottom of your heart when you speak to somebody you're not hiding [Music] that's how it happened is that allow your heart receive the word take away the Stony condition from your house take away the sunny condition from your house you know take away the West Side condition from your heart then that word of God establish you that word of God will strengthen you that nothing can come and move you okay this is what the scripture is you know you yourself you know you must purpose of received this word let me take a hold of it in my belief in it in My Confession of it in my obedience to it praise the name of Allah not talking it but the heart is praise the name of Allah but you see what you confess is exactly what is right inside praise the name of Allah let us go to First Corinthians chapter 15. to jump back on stage talking and then verse 58 Academy so the scripture says therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadyfast and movable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord foreign foreign praise the name of Allah so now Jesus Christ was telling Peter but yes when you are converted strengthen your brother you know you cannot establish somebody if you're not established praise the name of Allah if you are falling how do you hold somebody to stack you're also going to pull him to force so he was telling Peter first be converted when you are converted praise the name of Allah and our conversion comes with the baptism of the Holy Spirit when the spirit of God comes down in our hearts praise the name of our Lord and then you receive the life of Jesus the life of God himself to come down in us to take care of us to direct us so then you see that even when you are born again yourself you need to be strengthened or you know you need to be established let us go to First Peter chapter 1. First Peter chapter one dollar and then verse 22. seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit and to unfeigned love of Brethren see that you love one another with a pure fervent Hearts amazing galanga okay momotima no no praise the name of our Lord he said obeying the truth so you obey the truth when you hear the word of God and when you obey the truth the Bible says in Ephesians verse 13. that's right in whom you also trusted after that you had the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise Ephesians 1 13. amen is foreign [Music] not of the corruptible seed but of The Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever um praise the name of our Lord being born again not of the craftable seed foreign foreign and you know and then they take them then they take them when they take them to hospitals I'm forgetting the word they use this praise the name of our Lord there is that chart of the child from the time he's born praise the name of our Lord and then they went the child at Birth and so maybe the child is 3.5 kilos then they say you come back after three months or six months we are going to give disseminization so maybe they put the itemization for 13 hours or for whatever and then they measure the child and then they measure now supposing this child is still three point is 3.5 that chart has graphs and now your child is still flat but your money do you feed your childhood they measure growth by weight if your child is weight is really very low um then they said this child needs a lot of care that is a child may die but it depends on your reception of the word of God how much time are you giving to the Lord I know the scripture says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word I've reached gamble that proceeds out of the mouth of God that means we have in continuous feeding on the world you continuously feed on that word you have continuously reading the message of the hours you continuously hearing the message and as you keep on hearing as you keep on feeding you know you are growing by what you are here praise the name of our Lord you are growing by the things you give your attention too and this is how we are strengthened this is how we establish praise the name of our Lord so you cannot put away your time into you cannot do our without putting your time in it you need to put time there or not you ever say that in the things of God taking time to read the words you see that's Revelation 1 3. let us go to Revelations and then verse 3 and so I upset Revelation 1 3. so the scripture says blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand is he said you are blessed when you read foreign [Applause] [Applause] and his knowledge and adherence to the pure word of God has seen by March of examples in the Old Testament is telling us no True Believers is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive then his knowledge together of and the adherence to the pure word of God praise the name of Allah so if you want to be strong you want to be spiritually Healthy You Want to Be Alive take time hear the words that's how you get strange it gives you strange it gives you confidence praise the name of our Lord because you know what the will of the Lord so you were able to stand all precious you are able to stand all trials and then you are able to know that there is a purpose of God in the thing that I'm going through and from by wings foreign when we are converted but what Q Siva praise the name of our Lord you know the man who was running away from Jerusalem and then he was going to Jericho brother Branham says he was living a blessed City he was living a Heavenly City I was going to a cup City he was descending down to a caste City and you see when he reached there he was beaten almost to death and then the Good Samaritan came yeah no this is Inspire your servants the ministers our gracious and precious Brothers the Shepherds of the floor that you have called out and set apart dedicated dedicated lives to service that will take these sick people of soul body and wine until they aware so now when you come to the service praise the name of our Lord You Remember in John let us first go to John then you can proceeded John chapter one chapter 21. verse 15 yes so when he they had died Jesus says unto Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas loveth though me more than this he says unto him yeah Lord the knowest that I love thee he says unto him feed my Lambs yes he says unto him again the second time Simon son of Jonah it says unto him feed my ship very very eyes Okay verse 17. he says unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas loveth though me Peter saying Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time laugh it on me and he said unto him Lord so know it's all things the noise that I love thee Jesus said unto him feed my sheep this morning praise the name of and this is how the Lord also works so then you see that in the scriptures they were not avoiding assembling together of Brethren God should always be with us if we are going to be strengthened we are going to be established we need to be in The Fellowship of the Lord you shouldn't avoid coming to church you need to be there when you are not there there is something you lose but then when you are there there is something that impacts your life praise the name of our Lord you are impacted you established let us go to Romans praise the name of Allah Romans and then he says making requests if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you foreign making requests if okay for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end you may be established so he put the ministry there they may impart unto us the spiritual gifts and then that gift establishes it strengthens you [Music] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers Ephesians Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. okay era um for the perfecting of the sense for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christine before till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of Son of God and to a teacher of the fullness of God um carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but we Uganda foreign move along but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christo amen praise the name of Allah so he gave us the five-fold ministers for the perfect till we come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Sun and unto a perfect man in the measure of the stage of the fullness of Christ as long as the Rapture has not taken place and we need the five-fold ministry to bring us into Perfection to bring us in that time when we shall be with the Lord himself praise the name of Allah so he sends us the ministry to strengthen us you know to give us strength to stand praise the name of Allah that we don't avoid Fellowship but you see the devil is so evil are you understand the movie you know he put somebody down I saw the onesie and then he tells them don't go to church I didn't have this I was not feeling well and it keeps you further in that case that's what the devil does understand and somebody thinks that it's doing them anything better praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we don't avoid fellowship or coming to church it is good for thessonians chapter 3 verse 2. that's what I've done practicians chapter 3. 7 our brother and minister of God and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith Christo okay praise the name of our Lord so he sent timose to preach the gospel to establish and that's what the ministry does to us strengthening Us in different kind of ways sometimes through Corrections sometimes through review always sometimes you know sometimes you know through kind of teaching Doctrine knowing what is the truth what is happening we are being strengthened so Jesus told Peter yes we need also to be strengthened praise the name of Allah now as I finish let us go second Peter chapter one in surrender and then we start reading from verse three and then verse 8. says according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue za whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust is foreign foreign godliness brotherly kindness and brother kindness charity foreign foreign foreign for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ foreign you need to have he has given unto us according yet exceedingly great and precious promises and that is by his power the power that transforms us and as you keep on growing in him because you start with faith as you have faith in the world so the same words your kind of you know your commitment to him knowledge Temperance Temperance patience then godliness you are being established you are becoming grounded and this is why the Lord foreign the fruit of the spirit but where does the spirit bear his fruit if you yield to the spirit the fruit of the spirit will be manifested you are established you know you are strengthened praise the name of Allah so then the master can come for the Harvest praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says in John chapter 15. that if a tree a branch does not bear fruit you know first there is a condition where you're not bearing but you need to bear foreign foreign foreign so there is a fruit bearing fruit and then there's bearing more fruits and then it's bearing much fruits we need to be strengthened in the Lord say that you bear more fruits it multiplies and it is so precious it is of a great quality the love of God is in you not hatred but the quality of the spirit of godliness because it says coming for a church without spots without any blemish that's what Christ is coming so he was telling so you connect from him it's a reality somebody's so traveled let him go near the river of sweetness we need to be strengthened to end openness we need to be strengthened in the Lord let us be established in what God has giveness do that word you keep on manifesting keep on showing
