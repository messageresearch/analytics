[52:09] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[52:11] Christ,
[52:13] &gt;&gt; we thank you so much this morning, Lord,
[52:17] &gt;&gt; the opportunity you've given unto us
[52:20] that we can come into your presence,
[52:22] Lord,
[52:24] you said where two or three are gathered
[52:26] in your name,
[52:29] you will be there in their midst.
[52:32] And Lord, we believe you are here in our
[52:34] midst.
[52:36] You also told us in your word,
[52:39] they shall be taught of the Lord
[52:43] and great shall be their peace.
[52:46] We pray that you may speak to our
[52:47] hearts, heavenly father.
[52:50] Show every one of us what we have need
[52:52] of. We pray that you may meet everyone
[52:55] their needs.
[52:58] Bless us all together, Father. May your
[53:01] name be magnified and glorified for the
[53:04] glory of your name.
[53:06] In the name of the Lord Jesus.
[53:10] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[53:14] I greet all in the name of our Lord
[53:16] Jesus Christ.
[53:19] We're happy this morning to be into the
[53:21] presence of the Lord.
[53:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Amen. We
[53:27] have somebody come here for the first
[53:28] time who can recognize your presence by
[53:31] raise of your hand.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, you're welcome. my sister.
[53:37] Amen. Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; We also want to welcome back the holiday
[53:40] makers.
[53:43] Praise the name of our Lord.
[53:46] And appreciate our brothers amongst us.
[53:51] I see our sister. Hope you're welcome.
[53:54] I see Manuel back there.
[54:00] And others praise the name of our Lord.
[54:04] So we are grateful to be in the presence
[54:05] of the Lord.
[54:07] Praise the name of our Lord.
[54:10] Now today we have two services
[54:15] and we have the Lord's supper
[54:18] starting at 5:00
[54:22] and then foot washing.
[54:24] We always do this once in a month.
[54:29] We are doing it today
[54:33] but on 31st of December
[54:37] we shall also be doing it
[54:40] and 31st December will be a Wednesday.
[54:45] So on that 31st of December,
[54:50] we shall have an afternoon service
[54:55] that will start at 300 p.m.
[55:00] Praise the name of our Lord. We know the
[55:02] sample will be in Gaza convention
[55:06] which is starting on 29th which will be
[55:08] a Monday
[55:12] up to 1st of January.
[55:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Then again
[55:20] there is a convention
[55:23] which is starting on 18th up to 21st
[55:27] December.
[55:32] Already there are three sisters who have
[55:34] confirmed going
[55:36] and we need to know others who are going
[55:38] there
[55:41] being organized by pastor somewhere.
[55:46] you need to contribute 20,000 shillings
[55:48] for that.
[55:50] Then the one of
[55:53] starting as I said starting on 29th
[55:58] that's this month of December
[56:01] up to 1st of January
[56:04] and you are required to pay 100,000
[56:06] shillings.
[56:09] Praise the name of our Lord. And I would
[56:11] request you those who are going to Gaza
[56:12] to get in touch with brother William
[56:17] so that means of transport can be
[56:19] organized for all those who are going.
[56:24] Praise the name of our Lord. On Sunday
[56:27] this coming Sunday
[56:30] that is on 14th
[56:33] we are going to be hosting here brother
[56:34] Andreas
[56:36] Andreas. So, we're going to have two
[56:38] services
[56:40] and then we're also going to be having
[56:43] other pastors come from different
[56:45] places,
[56:47] places where we go to do missions every
[56:49] week.
[56:51] We shall love more people to hear
[56:55] and so we are going to have lunch for
[56:56] all of us.
[56:59] So, I would request you to make your
[57:00] contributions for lunch.
[57:07] Praise the name of our Lord. I know the
[57:09] times are hard,
[57:12] &gt;&gt; but you're not putting anything in vain
[57:14] into the things of God.
[57:18] Praise the name of the Lord. So, I just
[57:20] encourage you to do that.
[57:23] Praise the name of the Lord. There's a
[57:25] dedication of a baby. Let us sing that
[57:27] song. Bring them in.
[57:33] I told them, Sister Ba, there's a baby
[57:35] brought.
[57:40] or a child, I don't know, but
[57:48] bring them in.
[57:52] Bring them in.
[57:56] Bring them in from the field of sea.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Halleluah.
[58:05] Bring them in. Halleluah.
[58:10] Bring them in.
[58:14] Bring the wondering ones to Jes.
[58:22] Bring them in. Bring them in. Halleluah.
[58:28] Bring them in.
[58:33] Bring them in from the fields of sea.
[58:43] Bring them in.
[58:47] Bring them in.
[58:52] Bring our wondering ones to Jesus.
[59:01] Praise the name of our Lord.
[59:03] We always want to do everything
[59:07] based on the scriptures.
[59:10] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[59:12] the Bible says
[59:15] heaven and earth will pass away.
[59:18] Man's ideas will pass away.
[59:22] Many spirits and everything will pass
[59:24] away.
[59:26] But the word of God can never pass away.
[59:30] So in Matthew chapter 19
[59:34] then verse 13 to verse 15
[59:41] the Bible says
[59:43] then were there brought unto him little
[59:46] children that he should put his hands on
[59:49] them and pray and the disciples rebuked
[59:53] them.
[1:00:02] But Jesus said, "Suffer little children
[1:00:05] and forbide them not to come unto me,
[1:00:09] for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
[1:00:19] and
[1:00:24] and he laid his hands on them and
[1:00:26] departed then.
[1:00:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Yesterday I
[1:00:32] was in our village.
[1:00:35] And then what is interesting,
[1:00:38] one of my young brothers brought a child
[1:00:40] to be dedicated.
[1:00:45] Praise the name of again here dedicating
[1:00:48] another church.
[1:00:50] All of them.
[1:00:53] She wants all of them to be dedicated.
[1:00:57] Praise the name of God. So now Jesus
[1:01:00] Christ
[1:01:02] never instructed to baptize any little
[1:01:04] child.
[1:01:07] But when the children were brought to
[1:01:09] Christ,
[1:01:11] he laid hands on them and blessed them.
[1:01:15] The baptism of little children
[1:01:18] is a false teaching.
[1:01:22] It's not biblical
[1:01:24] because the Bible says
[1:01:28] the children have no offense.
[1:01:32] When you read in Matthew chapter 18,
[1:01:36] even Matthew chapter 19 we have read
[1:01:39] it saying of such is the kingdom of God.
[1:01:44] But now when you go to the
[1:01:45] denominational churches,
[1:01:47] they scare parents
[1:01:50] that if your child dies without being
[1:01:52] baptized
[1:01:55] that they going to hell. When the
[1:01:57] scripture says they have no offense,
[1:02:02] Because baptism
[1:02:04] is for the person who understands what
[1:02:06] they are doing.
[1:02:10] Because the Bible says man believes with
[1:02:13] the heart and then confesses with the
[1:02:16] mouth.
[1:02:18] This child cannot believe.
[1:02:20] This child cannot confess and you cannot
[1:02:23] believe
[1:02:25] if you have not been preached to.
[1:02:28] So in the denominations
[1:02:31] they bring false witnesses
[1:02:37] and then one says I'm confessing for the
[1:02:39] child.
[1:02:41] I'm going to keep the child
[1:02:44] false witnesses.
[1:02:46] But here we want to follow what the Lord
[1:02:48] did.
[1:02:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:57] Mai, let us pray for Mikai.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:02] Christ,
[1:03:03] we dedicate Mikai into your hands.
[1:03:05] Father,
[1:03:07] the gift you've given our sister.
[1:03:10] We pray that your blessing be upon this
[1:03:13] baby.
[1:03:15] Rebuke all forces and powers of darkness
[1:03:19] come against little children.
[1:03:22] We pray heavenly father.
[1:03:25] Guardian angel
[1:03:28] may continually watch over this child.
[1:03:31] And Lord, at the time of the age of
[1:03:33] accountability,
[1:03:35] this child come to personal realization
[1:03:39] that was born in sin and shaped
[1:03:41] iniquity.
[1:03:43] He would desire to be born again.
[1:03:46] We pray that at that time heavenly
[1:03:48] father we accept the Lord Jesus as his
[1:03:51] personal savior
[1:03:53] heavenly father to be born into the
[1:03:55] kingdom of heaven.
[1:03:57] I pray for our sister here Lord.
[1:04:00] Lord that father you may give them
[1:04:02] ability

[1:04:08] all that this child would need
[1:04:11] the physical needs the spiritual needs
[1:04:14] the emotional needs father that you may
[1:04:17] watch over this child
[1:04:20] and provide for that the child needs
[1:04:23] this family heavenly father in the name
[1:04:26] of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:28] Amen Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Mariah, let us pray for Mariah. Father,
[1:04:39] in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:04:41] let's get Mariah into your hands,
[1:04:44] praying that your blessings come upon
[1:04:47] her life.
[1:04:49] Watch over her life. Heavenly Father,
[1:04:52] deliver her from any form of evil or
[1:04:56] powers of darkness.
[1:04:58] We may give the parents ability
[1:05:01] to raise our father as a proper child.
[1:05:05] Fight for all that's needed for her
[1:05:06] welfare and living.
[1:05:09] Grant her good health, heavenly father.
[1:05:12] And at the time of accountability,
[1:05:15] may she accept the Lord Jesus as her
[1:05:17] personal savior.
[1:05:19] Lord into the kingdom of God to watch
[1:05:22] over her life
[1:05:25] every other day for the glory of your
[1:05:28] holy name. In the name of Jesus, we pray
[1:05:31] this.
[1:05:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:36] Whoa.
[1:05:39] Praise the name of our Lord. On Friday
[1:05:41] at sister Martha's place
[1:05:45] and then we told that this one is hard
[1:05:46] duplicate.
[1:05:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us pray
[1:05:54] for her. Father, we thank you for this
[1:05:57] little girl.
[1:05:59] We dedicate this girl into the hands of
[1:06:02] the Lord

[1:06:06] family
[1:06:08] and brought this child back and your
[1:06:09] heavenly father.
[1:06:12] Pray your blessings and protection be
[1:06:13] upon us.

[1:06:37] personal savior
[1:06:39] precious and protector
[1:06:42] blessings be upon our Lord in the name
[1:06:44] of Jesus we
[1:06:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you so much.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; I'll just call on sister faith if you
[1:06:59] can sing a song then we can go to the
[1:07:02] reading of the word.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] God bless you.
[1:07:56] I sleep through the gates of hell as
[1:08:01] Peter greeted me.
[1:08:06] And one by one I met the saints. I
[1:08:11] longed so much to see.
[1:08:16] I saw my hero Steven.
[1:08:26] But before my breath could find the
[1:08:30] words, I heard them speak to me.
[1:08:39] Are you
[1:08:42] the bride of the last days?
[1:08:47] was to the worst of times
[1:08:52] when so many sleep away.
[1:08:58] He your crown.
[1:09:02] Take your place beside the throne.
[1:09:08] Christ is now your very own.
[1:09:13] This is a special chosen one. You see
[1:09:19] special choice and one
[1:09:25] you see.
[1:09:31] It was the worst of all the ages.
[1:09:36] They continue
[1:09:39] to say,
[1:09:42] "How did you live a Christian life in
[1:09:48] such a godless day?"
[1:09:53] Question of a question,
[1:09:57] my heroes gave to me.
[1:10:03] Then I heard a voice behind me
[1:10:08] whisper tenderly.
[1:10:16] This is she
[1:10:18] the bride of the last days
[1:10:24] who stood the worst of times
[1:10:29] when so many sleep away
[1:10:36] your crown.
[1:10:40] Take your place beside the throne.
[1:10:45] I am now your very own.
[1:10:50] This is a special chosen one. You see,
[1:10:56] a special choice one.
[1:11:04] is she
[1:11:09] the trials that you're facing
[1:11:15] may seem so big and tall.
[1:11:20] But when you hear a master speak, it
[1:11:26] will make it worthy.
[1:11:33] What he told
[1:11:36] you are she
[1:11:41] the bride of the last days
[1:11:47] who stood the worst of times.
[1:11:52] are so many feet away.
[1:11:58] He is your crown.
[1:12:03] Take your place beside the throne.
[1:12:08] Christ is now your very own.
[1:12:14] This is a special chosen one. You see
[1:12:20] his special joys and wine.
[1:12:26] You are she.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:46] Are you the bride of the last day?

[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; The special chosen one.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So today we
[1:12:57] want to talk about the bride.
[1:13:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[1:13:02] stand up and have a word of prayer.
[1:13:06] Amen. Amen. Father, we thank you for
[1:13:09] this morning.
[1:13:12] How we are privileged, heavenly father.
[1:13:15] that we are the bride,
[1:13:18] the chosen one of this last day.
[1:13:22] When every evil is happening,
[1:13:25] we are people, oh God,
[1:13:28] we are the people that you've chosen to
[1:13:32] prove to Satan that even in the midst of
[1:13:36] his Eden,
[1:13:38] you have the bride.
[1:13:40] We want to thank you so much. May you
[1:13:42] therefore speak to our hearts, Father.
[1:13:45] Encourage us, strengthen us, direct us
[1:13:49] that Lord, every day we live,
[1:13:52] we may be ready for the rapture. That
[1:13:56] how we love you and how we thank you
[1:13:57] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:14:00] pray.
[1:14:02] Amen. Amen. Let us go to the book of
[1:14:05] second John chapter one.
[1:14:10] We are going to read from verse one to
[1:14:12] verse three.
[1:14:16] And our subject
[1:14:18] is the elect lady grace.
[1:14:25] Elect ready grace. The elect lady grace.
[1:14:35] Grace
[1:14:38] says, "The elder unto the elect lady and
[1:14:41] her children whom I love in the truth,
[1:14:45] and not I only, but also all they that
[1:14:48] have known the truth."
[1:14:51] Second 2 second John chapter 1 verse
[1:14:54] one.
[1:15:11] For the truth is sake which dwelleth in
[1:15:14] us and shall be with us forever.
[1:15:24] Grace be unto you. Mercy and peace from
[1:15:29] God the Father and from the Lord Jesus
[1:15:32] Christ, the Son of the Father in truth
[1:15:35] and love.
[1:15:47] May God sing of his word.
[1:15:50] Praise the name of our Lord. We want to
[1:15:52] talk about the elect lady grace.
[1:15:59] Praise the name of our Lord. The elect
[1:16:03] lady grace.
[1:16:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Very
[1:16:12] interesting scripture here.
[1:16:14] He says she's an elect
[1:16:18] lady
[1:16:20] and grace.
[1:16:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:16:25] message the invisible union of the bride
[1:16:27] of Christ
[1:16:30] it says in paragraph 40.
[1:16:33] May I add to this woman
[1:16:36] grace,
[1:16:40] may I place her in the Bible
[1:16:44] also is called the elect lady,
[1:16:51] Miss Grace.
[1:16:54] I'm going to talk about
[1:16:58] the Bible declares
[1:17:00] to the elect lady.
[1:17:04] If you notice
[1:17:06] elect
[1:17:08] come from the word elected lady
[1:17:14] one lady
[1:17:17] amongst all other ladies
[1:17:21] was elected.
[1:17:24] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:17:26] just like when a young man is looking
[1:17:28] for a wife to marry.
[1:17:33] Praise the name of the Lord. And you
[1:17:35] know sometimes
[1:17:37] of course somebody must have the mind.
[1:17:40] What kind of wife do I want to marry?
[1:17:44] And so maybe you kind of imagine.
[1:17:47] You know sometimes from maybe your
[1:17:49] background.
[1:17:52] Some people would say maybe I want to
[1:17:53] marry a certain kind of girl
[1:17:58] kind of woman.
[1:18:00] She should be speak my language.
[1:18:04] She should be educated to this kind of
[1:18:06] lady.
[1:18:08] She maybe should be like this or like
[1:18:10] this.
[1:18:13] You kind of have a picture in your mind
[1:18:17] of the person you are thinking about.
[1:18:21] So now you interact with many
[1:18:25] you know you meet many along the way
[1:18:29] and sometimes you can think about this
[1:18:30] one
[1:18:32] then maybe after sometime you say maybe
[1:18:34] she's not the one another time another
[1:18:36] one it keeps on like that you keep on
[1:18:39] thinking
[1:18:41] praise the name of you know when you are
[1:18:44] a young a young woman and you're not
[1:18:46] married
[1:18:51] know that there are people are noticing
[1:18:52] your conduct. Amen.
[1:18:56] There are people who are looking out
[1:18:59] who are scanning
[1:19:04] you know they try to look
[1:19:07] and you know when you are ready for
[1:19:09] marriage
[1:19:10] your friends can even give you some
[1:19:12] ideas.
[1:19:14] Ah that church has got some good sisters
[1:19:18] and now with WhatsApp
[1:19:21] they can share even the photos
[1:19:23] but then there are others
[1:19:26] sisters
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; who are fast at putting themselves on
[1:19:29] all platforms
[1:19:33] I'm here available I'm here
[1:19:36] I'm here I'm missing
[1:19:44] Then others can put that kind of I don't
[1:19:47] know what they call it kind of like love
[1:19:54] I'm looking for love
[1:19:57] and then they are just there then others
[1:20:00] can start talking on those medias
[1:20:03] and you know the way they kind of talk
[1:20:06] it's like look at me, I'm also
[1:20:08] available.
[1:20:10] Then there are those who will come and
[1:20:12] change their different fashion.
[1:20:16] Take a photo like this
[1:20:18] on the sideways
[1:20:20] in the back as you're looking at
[1:20:22] somebody at the back
[1:20:25] saying I'm available.
[1:20:28] But there are people looking at all this
[1:20:30] kind of
[1:20:32] and you know the photo can cause
[1:20:34] interest
[1:20:39] not just stop at the facial thing
[1:20:42] will go further and find the character
[1:20:46] which kind of person is this one
[1:20:50] praise the name of so it's not automatic
[1:20:55] because you've got somebody's
[1:20:56] recommendation
[1:21:00] everything is going to be okay.
[1:21:03] Now a man chooses from many.
[1:21:09] So now he sends this elected lady
[1:21:14] one lady. He speak from many
[1:21:19] praise the name of our Lord. There are
[1:21:21] many but there's only one that is
[1:21:25] elected.
[1:21:27] And the scenario of election
[1:21:30] is something that so much God is
[1:21:33] sovereign.
[1:21:36] When God desired a king in Israel,
[1:21:41] he told the prophet go in the house of
[1:21:44] Jesse.
[1:21:46] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[1:21:48] brother Brham says, "God
[1:21:51] keeps on unfolding his revelation."
[1:21:58] Like in the beginning, praise the name
[1:22:01] of our Lord, he talked about the woman
[1:22:03] is sick.
[1:22:05] And then now in the time of Jacob,
[1:22:08] Jacob talks about Judah holding the
[1:22:10] scepter.
[1:22:14] But then you see it didn't come there
[1:22:16] and then.
[1:22:18] You find even when Jacob was talking
[1:22:20] about that,
[1:22:22] Joseph was the lead of his brethren
[1:22:26] and Joseph got the double portion.
[1:22:29] And then from that time again Levi took
[1:22:33] the leadership
[1:22:35] through Moses and Aaron.
[1:22:38] And then when the time of Moses was
[1:22:40] over, then Joshua comes in from the
[1:22:44] tribe of Ephraim.
[1:22:47] And then you see that different judges
[1:22:50] were coming from different tribes.
[1:22:53] And then finally, Israel desired a king.
[1:22:57] And when Israel desired a king,
[1:23:01] the man who would suit their interest
[1:23:05] was Saul who was of the tribe of
[1:23:08] Benjamin.
[1:23:09] So he was made a king for 40 years.
[1:23:13] But then he wouldn't meet the
[1:23:15] requirement of God.
[1:23:18] And then God told the prophet, I've
[1:23:21] found a man
[1:23:23] who has a heart like my heart.
[1:23:26] Praise the name of our Lord. And God
[1:23:28] held the mystery to himself.
[1:23:32] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:23:34] the same thing now.
[1:23:36] But God holds the mystery
[1:23:39] to himself
[1:23:41] the same way
[1:23:44] held the mystery to himself.
[1:23:47] When he was at the well
[1:23:50] because he prayed in his heart, ALL THE
[1:23:53] PEOPLE AROUND HIM DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE
[1:23:54] WAS UP TO.
[1:23:56] BUT YET THEY KNEW HE HAS GONE TO PICK a
[1:23:58] wife.
[1:24:00] The qualities of the wife
[1:24:03] something that was a mystery was
[1:24:06] something that was kept a secret.
[1:24:09] Praise the name of God. AND SO EVEN GOD
[1:24:12] TELLS SAMUEL, "Go into the house of
[1:24:15] Jesse."
[1:24:17] And when Samuel comes into the house of
[1:24:19] Jesse,
[1:24:21] then Jess presents the first born.
[1:24:24] The prophet was excited. OH, THE LORD IS
[1:24:27] anointed before.
[1:24:30] You know, he was a sodian of soul.
[1:24:35] And you know, AS A HUMAN BEING, you
[1:24:38] can't be biased in one way or another.
[1:24:44] You may make a decision which may not be
[1:24:46] the best.
[1:24:49] This sister looks better than this
[1:24:51] sister.
[1:24:53] This sister is more presentable.
[1:24:56] This one is more educated.
[1:24:58] This one comes from a good family
[1:25:00] background.
[1:25:02] This one I think we of the same size.
[1:25:05] This one we speak the same language
[1:25:09] and that's how man chooses
[1:25:12] using the physical stature.
[1:25:15] That's what the man can see. But the
[1:25:18] Lord rebuked the prophet
[1:25:21] and TOLD THE PROPHET, "GOD does not look
[1:25:24] at the outside,
[1:25:27] but God looks at the heart."
[1:25:30] Praise the name of Now, how about you?
[1:25:33] What do you look at?
[1:25:36] Praise the name of the Lord. The good
[1:25:39] job or what?
[1:25:42] There was a brother I'm told
[1:25:45] and then he called a certain pastor.
[1:25:48] I want to get a wife.
[1:25:50] So do you have in your church
[1:25:53] nurses and teachers?
[1:25:57] He was looking for a profession.
[1:26:02] And then the pastor told him, "If you
[1:26:05] want teachers,
[1:26:07] go to the teaching college.
[1:26:10] If you want nurses, go to the nursing
[1:26:13] training school
[1:26:15] and there are many of of them here.
[1:26:19] But what I have is the daughter of God.
[1:26:23] Praise the name of God. You know some
[1:26:25] people have a wrong kind of choice
[1:26:31] is having this kind of thing, this kind
[1:26:34] of thing. not to look for the true thing
[1:26:39] what can make somebody marry.
[1:26:43] So now the prophet was rebuked.
[1:26:46] Don't choose by what you see. And then
[1:26:49] God told the prophet, wait until I show
[1:26:53] you.
[1:26:55] Now you look at that scenario. There
[1:26:57] were many sons of Jesse,
[1:27:01] but only one was meant to be the king.
[1:27:06] Praise the name of our Lord. And there
[1:27:08] are so many sisters
[1:27:12] because you're meant to marry from the
[1:27:14] message.
[1:27:16] But not every sister in the message
[1:27:20] can be your wife. There is only one
[1:27:23] ordained of the Lord.
[1:27:26] So what do you do? Go to the Lord in
[1:27:29] prayer and be patient with the Lord.
[1:27:34] Praise the name of our Lord. It may be
[1:27:36] the first year you may fail to get one.
[1:27:41] Keep on waiting.
[1:27:43] Maybe the second year
[1:27:46] somewhere first born went
[1:27:50] second born, third born until the
[1:27:54] seventh born and all the children there
[1:27:55] were over.
[1:27:58] And now it was evening. Then the prophet
[1:28:01] was asking the father, you don't have
[1:28:03] another child.
[1:28:05] There was one who was forgotten
[1:28:07] somewhere. And then he just called him.
[1:28:09] God called him.
[1:28:11] And when he just came,
[1:28:14] the spirit told the prophet, he's the
[1:28:16] one to anoint him, the choice of God.
[1:28:21] Praise the name of. And so we see in the
[1:28:23] day we are living in there so many
[1:28:26] churches,
[1:28:28] there are so many denominations.
[1:28:30] But Christ has got only one bride.
[1:28:34] Praise the name of God. ONLY ONE BRIDE
[1:28:37] OF CHRIST.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And it's not about being the first one.
[1:28:44] We are the first ones.
[1:28:48] Our nomination started long time ago.
[1:28:51] We have just begun. It's not about that.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; It's not the firstborn sha. area but God
[1:29:01] is choice.
[1:29:03] Praise the name of So God has chosen us
[1:29:07] as the bride of Jesus Christ. Praise the
[1:29:10] name of our Lord. Now, brother Brandham
[1:29:12] says here,
[1:29:14] he says like the virgin was to bring
[1:29:18] forth the body of God
[1:29:22] on the earth. She was an elected woman.
[1:29:27] God chose Mary
[1:29:31] and also
[1:29:33] God has chosen an elected lady
[1:29:37] which is his bride.
[1:29:40] She's elected.
[1:29:43] I hope you remember that
[1:29:46] praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:29:48] says the illustration here showing that
[1:29:51] the relationship
[1:29:54] of the bride
[1:29:56] to Christ, the elect lady
[1:30:01] and how she was to be brought to him,
[1:30:06] where she would come from
[1:30:09] and how that she would be brought to
[1:30:11] him.
[1:30:13] The church here
[1:30:16] in an illustration
[1:30:18] that we've got in the view
[1:30:21] is illustrated by a woman
[1:30:25] which a woman is always a type of the
[1:30:28] church
[1:30:30] because the church is considered a
[1:30:33] bride.
[1:30:35] A bride. She is the bride of the Lord
[1:30:38] Jesus Christ,
[1:30:40] the son of God. But now we are talking
[1:30:43] about the elected lady.
[1:30:48] And now when we talk about the lady,
[1:30:51] think about a church
[1:30:54] of the bride. One who is going to make
[1:30:57] union
[1:31:00] with our Lord Jesus Christ. But yet
[1:31:02] there's also another bride.
[1:31:06] Satan is bride.
[1:31:09] Praise the name of Allah. There is
[1:31:11] another lady
[1:31:13] or maybe a woman.
[1:31:15] You know, a lady is more of respect.
[1:31:19] But now when you get one who dresses
[1:31:21] naked,
[1:31:25] what honor is there?
[1:31:29] What honor is there to expose your body?
[1:31:34] What honor is there
[1:31:36] to have bad morals?
[1:31:39] What honor is there to live a filthy
[1:31:42] life?
[1:31:44] You know, there is no honor to that.
[1:31:47] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the
[1:31:50] message,
[1:31:53] let me get it here.
[1:31:57] In the message,
[1:32:00] the Satarian church age
[1:32:06] He says
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; now then the teaching of the Catholic
[1:32:12] Church,
[1:32:14] the church is female.
[1:32:17] It is a female. It is a woman
[1:32:21] denies the word of God.
[1:32:24] The pope who is literally Apollo in the
[1:32:26] modern version
[1:32:31] has taught the people to join themselves
[1:32:33] to idols.
[1:32:36] The Roman church has now become a false
[1:32:40] prophetist
[1:32:43] to the people because she has taken away
[1:32:47] the word of the Lord
[1:32:50] from the people and given her own ideas
[1:32:56] as to what constitutes forgiveness of
[1:32:58] sins,
[1:33:01] what brings the blessings of God.
[1:33:04] And the priests have gone so far as to
[1:33:06] state categorically
[1:33:10] that they have the power
[1:33:13] not only in this life but also in death.
[1:33:18] They teach on their own
[1:33:20] that there is a purgatory.
[1:33:23] But you can't find that in the word.
[1:33:27] They teach that prayers and masses and
[1:33:30] money
[1:33:36] will get you out of purgatory
[1:33:39] and into heaven.
[1:33:41] The whole system
[1:33:44] that is based upon its teaching is
[1:33:46] false.
[1:33:49] It is not lie on the sure foundation of
[1:33:53] the revelation of God in his word.
[1:33:59] But lies on the sifting
[1:34:03] sinking sands
[1:34:06] of its own diabolic untruth.
[1:34:12] The church went right from organization
[1:34:15] to domination
[1:34:21] and hence to false teaching
[1:34:25] that is right. The Roman Catholics
[1:34:30] don't believe that God is in his word.
[1:34:34] No sir, if they did, they would have to
[1:34:37] repent and back up.
[1:34:40] But they say God is in his church.
[1:34:44] That would make the Bible the history of
[1:34:46] the Catholic church.
[1:34:49] It isn't. So look what they did to water
[1:34:52] baptism alone.
[1:34:56] They took it away from being Christian
[1:34:57] baptism
[1:35:00] and made it a pagan of titles.
[1:35:06] Now we are seeing this condition
[1:35:08] of the church called mystery Babylon.
[1:35:13] You know, it just started on its own
[1:35:17] kind of ideas.
[1:35:20] And then we find in the book of
[1:35:22] revelation
[1:35:24] in revelations chapter 17.
[1:35:30] And then the Bible says
[1:35:33] in verse one,
[1:35:35] "And there came one of the seven angels
[1:35:39] which had seven vials and talked with
[1:35:41] me, saying unto me, come he will show
[1:35:44] unto thee the judgment of the great war
[1:35:47] that sits upon many waters.
[1:36:04] Now, so the religious system here
[1:36:07] is called the great war.
[1:36:11] And now this great war,
[1:36:14] the Bible says, she is the mother of her
[1:36:18] lot.
[1:36:21] Just like Jezebel
[1:36:23] when she brought idolatry in Israel
[1:36:27] and she was married to the king.
[1:36:32] She brought all filthness.
[1:36:36] She brought all immorality.
[1:36:39] She brought all idol worship.
[1:36:42] She brought all witchcraft.
[1:36:45] Praise the name of our Lord. And she
[1:36:47] would seduce
[1:36:51] When came the Bible says she painted
[1:36:55] herself.
[1:37:00] So the painting,
[1:37:02] the spirit behind painting
[1:37:06] is it seduce
[1:37:09] red lips here
[1:37:12] as if they have drunk blood,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; black lips,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; green lips, green.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Green.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Then the eyebrows.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Then the face.
[1:37:29] And then when people are having their
[1:37:30] weddings,
[1:37:33] you find they have put I don't know
[1:37:34] whether they they used to call it copper
[1:37:36] girl those days. I don't know what they
[1:37:37] call it.
[1:37:40] Put some layers of new skin here.
[1:37:45] And then you find just like an artistic
[1:37:47] face.
[1:37:53] Some yellow here.
[1:37:56] Which am I looking at?
[1:38:01] painted Jezebel
[1:38:04] to seduce.
[1:38:07] And then there are those who now to use
[1:38:09] their nails
[1:38:11] and they now to disguise the color,
[1:38:16] but it's the same spirit.
[1:38:18] They put on silver. Silver just shines.
[1:38:24] It's the same spirit of painting.
[1:38:30] There is somebody
[1:38:33] came with black nails.
[1:38:37] Then I was asking her what has happened
[1:38:40] to your nails
[1:38:42] said you know we were playing a drama
[1:38:45] drama act at school
[1:38:50] said drama act and then they are
[1:38:53] permanently then I was asking another
[1:38:56] person
[1:39:01] then I was asking another person when
[1:39:03] you go to election
[1:39:05] they give you a
[1:39:10] Does that ink stick there forever?
[1:39:16] And then I saw the nails of the toes
[1:39:18] were also painted.
[1:39:22] Spirits
[1:39:24] and so you find the devil just anoint
[1:39:26] somebody
[1:39:28] and then they start doing things they
[1:39:30] don't know.
[1:39:32] Become another Jezebel.
[1:39:34] But you see that Jezebel
[1:39:37] had daughters,
[1:39:40] she and her daughters,
[1:39:42] wherever kingdom they went,
[1:39:45] they brought the kingdom down.
[1:39:49] So even the Bible says here that this
[1:39:52] church system,
[1:39:55] she's a mother of her lot.
[1:39:58] In other words, other religions have
[1:40:00] gone out
[1:40:02] and he has taught them how to rebel
[1:40:06] against the word of God.
[1:40:11] SO NOW GOD sends a messenger
[1:40:15] to call the PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF
[1:40:17] BABYLON
[1:40:19] said Babylon is fallen. She's fallen.
[1:40:23] She's full of wickedness.
[1:40:25] She's full of immorality.
[1:40:28] She's full of blood.
[1:40:30] Come out over my people. But now you
[1:40:33] look at this mystery. Babylon
[1:40:36] the war.
[1:40:38] What she claims to be
[1:40:40] in Revelations 18.
[1:40:43] The Bible says now this is her claim.
[1:40:49] Revelations 18:E4.
[1:40:52] And I heard another voice from heaven
[1:40:54] saying, "Come out of her, my people,
[1:40:57] that you be not partakers of our sins,
[1:41:00] that you receive not of her plagues.
[1:41:16] For her sins have reached unto heaven,
[1:41:18] and God has remembered her iniquities.
[1:41:29] Reward her even as she has rewarded you,
[1:41:32] and double unto her double according to
[1:41:35] her works, in the cup which she has
[1:41:37] filled
[1:41:38] to her double.
[1:41:59] How much she has glorified herself
[1:42:03] and lived deliciously.
[1:42:06] So much torment and sorrow give her. For
[1:42:08] she says in her heart, "I see it as a
[1:42:12] queen. I'm no widow." And she has seen
[1:42:15] no sorrow.
[1:42:38] Therefore shall her plagues come in one
[1:42:40] day, death and mourning and famine, and
[1:42:44] she shall be utterly burned with fire.
[1:42:47] For strong is the Lord God who judges
[1:42:49] her.
[1:43:12] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:43:14] Bible says
[1:43:16] she glorifies herself
[1:43:21] and then she says
[1:43:23] I am a queen.
[1:43:30] I'm the wife of the king.
[1:43:33] I'm the queen of heaven
[1:43:37] and I am no widow.
[1:43:42] What is her confession?
[1:43:44] She says, "I have a husband."
[1:43:49] But who is the husband?
[1:43:52] Who is her influencer?
[1:43:56] Who is her ruler?
[1:43:58] Who is her Lord?
[1:44:01] So her character
[1:44:04] reflects who her Lord is.
[1:44:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Her
[1:44:09] character
[1:44:11] identifies her of who rules in her.
[1:44:17] Praise the name of OUR LORD. SO NOW THAT
[1:44:19] means she is the bride of Satan.
[1:44:24] She's influenced by Satan.
[1:44:28] She's used by Satan.
[1:44:31] She has rejected the leadership of God.
[1:44:35] So now in the message the church age
[1:44:41] he says
[1:44:44] and that weakness in her allowed Satan
[1:44:52] to seduce her
[1:44:55] by the way of the serpent
[1:44:59] and brought the woman to a very popular
[1:45:02] peculiar position.
[1:45:08] before God and his word.
[1:45:12] He is the type of all things vulgar,
[1:45:20] foul,
[1:45:23] loosome on the hand.
[1:45:33] And on the other hand, she is the type
[1:45:36] of all things clean
[1:45:40] and beautiful
[1:45:42] and holy as the receptacle of the spirit
[1:45:47] and blessings of God.
[1:45:50] Now he's comparing two kinds of women.
[1:45:54] He's comparing two kinds of bride.
[1:45:57] And you know in the nature here
[1:46:00] there is a woman who is pure,
[1:46:04] good character,
[1:46:06] decently dressed,
[1:46:09] faithful to her marriage vote,
[1:46:12] obedient to her husband,
[1:46:15] raising her children well.
[1:46:17] But yet THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER woman
[1:46:21] who is lives like a prostitute.
[1:46:26] She's a prostitute.
[1:46:29] You know she gives her body to anybody.
[1:46:33] She doesn't care how she dresses.
[1:46:37] She doesn't care her conduct.
[1:46:40] She doesn't care how she's raising her
[1:46:42] children.
[1:46:44] She doesn't care her morals.
[1:46:48] very immoral
[1:46:50] you know. So there is one
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; WHO IS SO TERRIBLE
[1:46:56] and then there is another one WHO IS
[1:46:58] AGAIN SO YOU know exalted before the
[1:47:02] Lord.
[1:47:05] THE other one is of the devil. Then the
[1:47:07] other one IS OF GOD. THE OTHER ONE IS
[1:47:10] INFLUENCED BY SATAN. THE OTHER one is
[1:47:12] influenced by God.
[1:47:15] SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT TWO KINDS OF WOMEN
[1:47:17] HERE.
[1:47:18] ONE WHO IS just so vulgar.
[1:47:24] You know the Bible talks about
[1:47:27] a man choosing a wife. And if you have a
[1:47:30] wife,
[1:47:32] all the time she's against you or after
[1:47:35] you.
[1:47:38] The Bible says you would rather be on
[1:47:40] the rooftop.
[1:47:44] When you come in the house, no peace,
[1:47:48] no peace.
[1:47:53] This one here, any small mistake.
[1:47:58] Before you finish the sense of power,
[1:48:02] pick up the word here. Where have you
[1:48:05] been? Who is that person?
[1:48:10] There are those.
[1:48:13] But we shouldn't have our houses like
[1:48:15] that.
[1:48:16] Let us not put our houses on fire.
[1:48:21] You put them on fire
[1:48:25] until a brother would want I wish I
[1:48:27] would go away.
[1:48:34] Praise the name of Lord. Now let me
[1:48:37] bring this
[1:48:39] especially sisters who are married.
[1:48:42] Find out why doesn't your husband like
[1:48:45] being with you.
[1:48:49] Just find out.
[1:48:51] If there is any assignment far away,
[1:48:56] that's happiness.
[1:48:59] God has given me some relief today
[1:49:04] when he's going far. Find out yourself
[1:49:08] if you're not the problem
[1:49:12] where the husband is happy to be far
[1:49:14] away.
[1:49:17] find out where is my responsibility in
[1:49:20] this issue
[1:49:22] because the Bible says it's not good for
[1:49:24] a man to be alone
[1:49:27] by by the time a man is married
[1:49:30] and then he says I'm better off when I'm
[1:49:32] alone
[1:49:35] there is a problem
[1:49:39] the name of yeah we need to find out
[1:49:43] the same thing with the husband
[1:49:46] why Is my wife telling me I'm looking
[1:49:48] for a job in the other place?
[1:49:53] Not being near her family.
[1:49:56] There's a problem. So you try to find
[1:49:58] out as a husband,
[1:50:01] what is my contribution to dismiss?
[1:50:06] Praise the name of our Lord. So then he
[1:50:09] says
[1:50:14] she is the type of all thing
[1:50:19] vulgar fall and lossome
[1:50:24] but then on the side of God
[1:50:28] you know she's actually very clean
[1:50:34] beautiful and holy and recept receptacle
[1:50:40] of the spirit and the blessings of God.
[1:50:45] And on one hand
[1:50:47] is called the wall
[1:50:51] who is drunk with the wine of her
[1:50:54] fornication.
[1:50:57] On the other hand, she is called the
[1:51:01] bride of Christ.
[1:51:03] On one hand, she's called the mystery
[1:51:06] Babylon.
[1:51:08] the abomination before God.
[1:51:11] On the other hand, she's called the new
[1:51:13] Jerusalem.
[1:51:15] our mother. Mama wife on the other hand
[1:51:20] she is called
[1:51:22] she on the one she's called so full and
[1:51:25] wicked
[1:51:28] and she's sarcast in the lake of fire
[1:51:33] as the only place fit for her.
[1:51:38] And on the other hand, she's exalted to
[1:51:41] the heaven,
[1:51:43] sharing the very throne of God
[1:51:47] and the only place befeitting such a
[1:51:49] queen
[1:51:53] and this Sataran church age.
[1:51:57] She is a dominating female.
[1:52:06] She is the mystery Babylon.
[1:52:10] She is the great war.
[1:52:12] She is Jezebel,
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; the false prophetess.
[1:52:18] Why? Because the true female
[1:52:22] is submissive to God.
[1:52:25] Christ is her head.
[1:52:28] She has no word but his
[1:52:32] no thoughts but his
[1:52:35] no leadership but his.
[1:52:38] But what about this church?
[1:52:41] She has cast out the word.
[1:52:45] She has destroyed the Bibles
[1:52:48] and worth essence of godly.
[1:52:55] has slain those who would preach the
[1:52:58] truth.
[1:53:01] She has taken over kings,
[1:53:04] princes and nations
[1:53:07] armies
[1:53:09] and insist that she is the true body of
[1:53:12] Christ
[1:53:16] and her popes are vicers of Christ.
[1:53:23] She is entirely seduced by devil
[1:53:27] until she's in turn has become the
[1:53:29] seducer of others.
[1:53:34] She is the bride of Satan
[1:53:37] and has produced his bastard child
[1:53:40] religions.
[1:53:44] This is the time we're living in. Praise
[1:53:46] the name of our Lord. The bride of
[1:53:48] Christ and the bride of Satan.
[1:53:52] We've read in Revelations chapter 18
[1:53:56] and mystery Babylon
[1:53:58] the great WAR SAYS I'm a queen
[1:54:03] I have a king I have a husband I'm no
[1:54:07] widow who is a husband
[1:54:10] Satan
[1:54:12] when people reject the word of God
[1:54:16] then they get the leadership of Satan
[1:54:20] and that's the same thing also with our
[1:54:22] lives. WHEN YOU PUT THE word of God
[1:54:24] aside
[1:54:26] and you are believing a lie
[1:54:30] and lies, the father of lies is the
[1:54:34] devil.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. But now we
[1:54:38] are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:41] Praise the name of our Lord. God has
[1:54:43] chosen us to be the bride of Jesus
[1:54:46] Christ. And it is by election.
[1:54:50] Praise the name of our Lord. IT'S BY THE
[1:54:52] GRACE of God that the Lord has chosen
[1:54:56] us. The Lord has called us to be his
[1:55:00] own. It's not our ability,
[1:55:03] but is the election of God.
[1:55:06] Praise the NAME OF OUR LORD. NOW, ARE WE
[1:55:09] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST?
[1:55:11] Praise the name of our Lord. So John was
[1:55:15] writing to the elect lady
[1:55:18] and then brother Brandham calls the
[1:55:19] elect lady
[1:55:22] grace.
[1:55:25] Praise the name of our Lord. AND THEN
[1:55:27] THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN CHRIST CAME, he was
[1:55:30] full of truth
[1:55:32] and full of grace.
[1:55:35] And what was in Christ, he put it in his
[1:55:39] body.
[1:55:41] SO THEN THE CHURCH OF CHRIST BECOMES the
[1:55:44] embodiment
[1:55:46] of the truth and grace. Praise the name
[1:55:50] of our Lord. SO SHE'S CALLED TRUTH.
[1:55:54] She's called grace
[1:55:56] because grace resides within
[1:55:59] resides within. Praise the name of her.
[1:56:03] When Jesus was standing before Pilate
[1:56:06] AND THEN PILATE WAS ASKING JESUS,
[1:56:10] "What is truth?"
[1:56:12] And truth was standing before.
[1:56:15] And this is what the Lord HAS CALLED US.
[1:56:19] PRAISE THE NAME OF OUR LORD THAT YOU CAN
[1:56:21] BEAR a record
[1:56:23] of truth. Praise the name OF OUR LORD.
[1:56:26] YOUR VERY LIFE should reflect the word
[1:56:29] OF THE LORD.
[1:56:31] YOUR VERY TESTIMONY. THE WORDS THAT YOU
[1:56:34] SPEAK, FIND out the words that you
[1:56:37] speak.
[1:56:38] YOU KNOW, WE ARE LIVING in an age of
[1:56:40] deception
[1:56:42] until people don't mean what they say.
[1:56:47] And he can put you on the wall
[1:56:51] over something,
[1:56:53] but what is a choosing you
[1:56:56] is what he always does.
[1:56:59] That's the devil.
[1:57:02] They are choose of brethren.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; He always goes
[1:57:11] this and this and this. Praise the name
[1:57:13] of our Lord. And now if you are the kind
[1:57:15] of person who likes reporting other
[1:57:17] people's mistakes,
[1:57:20] how about your mistakes?
[1:57:23] Why don't you tell that person you are
[1:57:25] telling
[1:57:28] I have this weakness.
[1:57:30] Confess your faults one to another
[1:57:34] nots
[1:57:37] brother. Pray for me.
[1:57:41] I have this weakness.
[1:57:43] I have the other.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Pray with me.
[1:57:46] Praise the name of the Lord. So we are
[1:57:49] living in an age of deception.
[1:57:52] where the Bible says the truth has
[1:57:56] fallen on the streets.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; They left it on the streets. It is
[1:58:02] something else that's moving the people.
[1:58:06] Praise the name of our Lord. But we need
[1:58:09] to be that elect lady,
[1:58:13] the the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:16] who has been born again.
[1:58:19] God has chosen her. And now when God has
[1:58:23] chosen her,
[1:58:25] she's delighted
[1:58:28] to be the choice of God.
[1:58:31] So she wants reflect the image of her
[1:58:33] husband.
[1:58:36] She doesn't want to be like Vashit
[1:58:40] Vet WAS THE QUEEN
[1:58:43] VERY BEAUTIFUL
[1:58:45] WHO LOOK what
[1:58:48] now the king had made feasts
[1:58:52] now on the seventh day
[1:58:55] he wanted the glory of the queen to be
[1:58:57] displayed
[1:59:00] and you know the Bible says the hair of
[1:59:02] the woman is her glory
[1:59:06] And the woman is the glory of the
[1:59:08] husband.
[1:59:10] Praise the name of our Lord. So the king
[1:59:13] wanted the discipline of his glory.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he was drunk.
[1:59:21] And then she said,
[1:59:25] "How could you go this drunk man?" And
[1:59:28] wine.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord, the
[1:59:32] stimulation of revelation.
[1:59:36] Praise the name of God. She didn't want
[1:59:38] a further revelation of the husband.
[1:59:43] She didn't want a further you know
[1:59:45] unfolding of the husband.
[1:59:50] So now like now we could talk about
[1:59:53] Luther.
[1:59:54] They got the revelation of the just
[1:59:56] shall live by faith
[1:59:59] and then they stopped at that. They
[2:00:01] didn't want to go further.
[2:00:04] They never wanted to go further into a
[2:00:05] further stimulation.
[2:00:09] They never wanted to go into a further
[2:00:10] revelation
[2:00:12] unfolding of the word.
[2:00:15] So they rejected him.
[2:00:18] Then now he got Wesley
[2:00:21] and then he brought sanctification,
[2:00:24] a further revelation of the word.
[2:00:27] And then Wesley, he didn't want to go
[2:00:30] further than that. He brought now
[2:00:33] restoration of gifts. And then our
[2:00:35] brothers, the Pentecostals,
[2:00:38] they just stop at those things.
[2:00:41] Gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts,
[2:00:44] gifts, gifts, gifts,
[2:00:46] and that's what they fall all the time.
[2:00:49] But when you meet Christ,
[2:00:52] he keeps on revealing himself to you.
[2:00:56] And that should always be our desire.
[2:00:59] I have come to church today. Praise the
[2:01:01] name of our Lord. Why don't you come for
[2:01:04] a further revelation of Christ,
[2:01:08] a further knowledge of Christ
[2:01:10] on Wednesday,
[2:01:13] praise the name of our Lord now to
[2:01:15] brothers and sisters don't want to come
[2:01:16] on Wednesday.
[2:01:20] What holds you back?
[2:01:23] What hinders you?
[2:01:26] Praise the name of the Lord. You are
[2:01:28] refusing a further revelation
[2:01:32] to know him better
[2:01:35] to be helped to overcome your
[2:01:36] weaknesses.
[2:01:39] Praise the name of our Lord. You only
[2:01:41] want to be a religious person
[2:01:45] on Sunday. Sunday, I'm always there.
[2:01:48] How about Wednesday?
[2:01:51] I'm too busy
[2:01:56] first. Excuse me.
[2:01:58] I have the other business.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; I have
[2:02:04] you know
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; she had got fellow women
[2:02:09] and these days there are many women
[2:02:11] groups on villages
[2:02:15] and sometimes they sit on this morning,
[2:02:18] Friday morning.
[2:02:20] Saturday morning
[2:02:22] and then sometimes
[2:02:25] Sunday afternoon
[2:02:29] I had to be in the
[2:02:32] not class.
[2:02:38] We were sharing money
[2:02:41] and the year is coming to an end
[2:02:45] refusing a further revelation of the
[2:02:47] word.
[2:02:49] Now today we have the Lord's supper.
[2:02:53] I'm too busy.
[2:02:56] But then Christ saying, "Why don't you
[2:02:57] come and commune with me?
[2:03:00] I have a better program."
[2:03:05] So you find yourself
[2:03:08] you are failing in your personal life
[2:03:13] because you have not allowed Christ
[2:03:17] to take charge over your life
[2:03:20] to be the Lord of your life.
[2:03:23] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[2:03:25] when you hear Christ is coming
[2:03:28] it should excite you. I'm going to
[2:03:30] interact with him. I'm going to have
[2:03:33] fellowship with you. So then YOU FIND
[2:03:36] YOURSELF LORD I want to be here.
[2:03:40] Let us not be like Adam and Eve.
[2:03:44] When the Lord came in the cool of the
[2:03:45] day
[2:03:47] you don't find Adam in the use of place.
[2:03:51] Then he called ADAM
[2:03:55] where are you?
[2:03:58] Ah, we heard your voice
[2:04:01] walking in the garden and we hid
[2:04:04] ourselves.
[2:04:06] We went in in in
[2:04:10] the organizations
[2:04:13] business. We went in businesses.
[2:04:17] There's a problem.
[2:04:20] You know, if you come in touch with
[2:04:22] Christ,
[2:04:24] you don't want to leave him.
[2:04:27] You just say Lord I want to spend all my
[2:04:29] time
[2:04:33] until when you if service like one once
[2:04:36] in a while
[2:04:38] or whenever the Lord comes you find the
[2:04:41] service is over but you don't want to
[2:04:44] leave church you just feel you need to
[2:04:46] be there
[2:04:48] fellowship
[2:04:50] communion
[2:04:52] what friendship with Christ
[2:04:56] Whenas
[2:04:58] and HIS FRIENDS IN THEIR troubles
[2:05:02] when they found Christ they didn't know
[2:05:05] that he was Christ they didn't know that
[2:05:07] he was Christ they started walking with
[2:05:10] him and then he was talking to them
[2:05:16] laws
[2:05:17] songs prophets
[2:05:20] and then you know the BIBLE SAYS THE
[2:05:23] TIME HAD GONE AND THERE WAS A JUNCTION.
[2:05:28] And when they reached that junction,
[2:05:31] it was as if he's going this way. WHAT
[2:05:34] DID THEY DO? They constrained him. Don't
[2:05:37] leave us. Don't leave us.
[2:05:40] When you meet Christ,
[2:05:42] something in you just feels like, "Oh,
[2:05:44] God, don't leave me."
[2:05:49] But then here Christ is the one who has
[2:05:51] said I want to be around in fellowship
[2:05:56] in the afternoon service. I want to be
[2:05:58] around in fellowship in the Lord's
[2:06:01] community. I want to be around in
[2:06:03] fellowship in the footship.
[2:06:08] Do you know Jesus
[2:06:10] for me? I gave you Saturday Sunday
[2:06:12] morning only.
[2:06:15] you get others who are idle to be
[2:06:18] present.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; That was not
[2:06:23] and you know they insisted on knowing
[2:06:27] him further
[2:06:30] and the Bible says they sed him.
[2:06:33] They had not yet known him something in
[2:06:36] them.
[2:06:40] SPEAK MORE LORD SPEAK. I WANT TO HEAR
[2:06:43] THIS. WANT TO HEAR THINGS. Praise the
[2:06:46] name of God. LIKE THE GENTILES IN ACTS
[2:06:49] chapter 13 when they came to the
[2:06:52] synagogue and then they had pop
[2:06:54] preaching at Barabas,
[2:06:56] the time had gone now and they said,
[2:06:59] "Oh, we want to come back the next
[2:07:02] Sabbath.
[2:07:04] Hear these words.
[2:07:06] Praise the name of OUR LORD." THEN THE
[2:07:08] BIBLE SAID that the people praise the
[2:07:11] name of our Lord. I'm just forgetting
[2:07:13] the name of the place.
[2:07:16] The people in Bela
[2:07:19] when they heard the word,
[2:07:22] oh, they went home
[2:07:24] and then they started checking.
[2:07:27] What was he preaching to them? Where was
[2:07:29] he teaching? Where was this?
[2:07:32] How about us? We come to church. No
[2:07:36] notes.
[2:07:39] You're just there.
[2:07:42] It's just like a news conference.
[2:07:49] Things will get when we get new.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; You need to write something when you
[2:07:54] come to church.
[2:07:57] Praise the name of our Lord. Have
[2:07:59] something to write.
[2:08:02] I was almost asking my daughter.
[2:08:05] I almost I didn't ask her.
[2:08:10] Where is your notebook?
[2:08:13] I didn't ask anyway.
[2:08:18] When you come to church,
[2:08:20] why are you keeping your notes?
[2:08:24] Praise the name of the Lord. And the
[2:08:26] Bible says, I went back home and started
[2:08:30] searching these things,
[2:08:32] whether these things be so.
[2:08:37] Where do we find this? He quoted in the
[2:08:40] message
[2:08:42] quote. Where is that quote?
[2:08:45] He read this scripture
[2:08:48] he talked about.
[2:08:50] Where is that quote?
[2:08:53] That means there's something IN YOU KEEP
[2:08:57] ON burning
[2:09:00] and say I want to COME BACK AGAIN AND I
[2:09:03] want to hear more of the Lord. speak to
[2:09:06] me. SPEAK TO ME. AND THEN THE BIBLE
[2:09:09] SAYS, when you look at these two
[2:09:11] scenarios,
[2:09:13] these people of Berea
[2:09:15] in Acts chapter 17,
[2:09:19] praise the name of the Lord. It's good
[2:09:21] you've got it there. Acts chapter 17 and
[2:09:24] verse 11.
[2:09:27] And these were more noble than in
[2:09:29] Thessalonica.
[2:09:34] Let us go back verse 10.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; And the brethren immediately sent a
[2:09:40] sireus by the night and
[2:09:53] of the Jews.
[2:09:59] The Bible says the people in Bair
[2:10:03] were more noble
[2:10:06] than those of Cessonica.
[2:10:09] What is our testimony now?
[2:10:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Can we say
[2:10:16] like my brother here Joshua?
[2:10:19] Can I say you are better?
[2:10:23] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[2:10:25] says they were better.
[2:10:28] What made them better?
[2:10:31] The Bible says they received the word
[2:10:35] with the readiness of mind
[2:10:40] and they didn't leave it at church.
[2:10:43] But they went back
[2:10:45] and searched
[2:10:48] the scriptures.
[2:10:50] How often
[2:10:53] daily
[2:10:55] praise the name of our Lord whether
[2:10:58] those things were so
[2:11:02] now we are living in an age of deception
[2:11:07] terrible deception.
[2:11:11] Praise the name of our Lord that you
[2:11:13] need yourself
[2:11:16] to go back to the books
[2:11:19] yourself
[2:11:22] go back and read these things.
[2:11:27] It's not enough for you to hear a quote.
[2:11:30] It's not a just enough for you to hear
[2:11:33] one scripture.
[2:11:35] GO BACK and read the thing.
[2:11:38] Read the background.
[2:11:41] LIKE ON WEDNESDAY WHEN WE'RE HERE IN THE
[2:11:43] SERVICE, you know, we're giving AN
[2:11:46] ILLUSTRATION
[2:11:48] THAT YOU KNOW THE BIBLE AND EVEN THE
[2:11:51] MESSAGE THE WAY IT is preached.
[2:11:55] Praise the name of our Lord, you must be
[2:11:58] able to take time and read through the
[2:12:00] whole thing
[2:12:03] to know what he's talking about.
[2:12:06] Otherwise, you may land on the
[2:12:07] scripture.
[2:12:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Let me give
[2:12:11] you an illustration.
[2:12:14] Praise the name of our Lord. I want us
[2:12:16] to go in the scriptures here in the book
[2:12:18] of Luke.
[2:12:26] And then we read in
[2:12:33] just beg your pardon.
[2:12:39] Luke chapter 8
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; and then verse
[2:12:52] 41
[2:12:55] the Bible says and behold there came a
[2:12:58] man named Jarius and he was the ruler of
[2:13:01] the synagogue and fell down at Jesus's
[2:13:04] feet and besought him that he would come
[2:13:07] into his house.
[2:13:19] For he had only one daughter about 12
[2:13:22] years of age, and she let die. But he
[2:13:26] went
[2:13:28] But he went the but as he went the
[2:13:30] people thronged him.
[2:13:48] Now you see the story starts
[2:13:52] and it stops there
[2:13:55] and now when he does that
[2:13:59] another story comes in
[2:14:02] the woman with a blood issue
[2:14:05] So he start wondering
[2:14:07] this man Jarius
[2:14:10] what happened to his daughter
[2:14:13] the only daughter
[2:14:16] who was dying
[2:14:18] because it hurts you oh this man was
[2:14:20] losing his daughter
[2:14:22] we had already pray to God
[2:14:27] he prayed to God first
[2:14:31] now see God has not yet answered him is
[2:14:33] going another person. Praise the name of
[2:14:36] Lord.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; So then
[2:14:39] if you don't continue reading
[2:14:43] and then you stop at that I don't know
[2:14:46] what happened to Jaras.
[2:14:48] God I don't know. And now you read the
[2:14:51] message one quote and you go with that.
[2:14:56] Read further than that.
[2:14:59] You pick only one scripture go with
[2:15:02] that. read further than that. Let us
[2:15:06] learn to be people who study the word of
[2:15:08] God.
[2:15:11] Take time read the Bible. Take time read
[2:15:14] the message.
[2:15:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Otherwise,
[2:15:18] you'll end up
[2:15:21] with people's conclusions.
[2:15:27] Then that becomes your quote also.
[2:15:31] No.
[2:15:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Go and read
[2:15:36] the things.
[2:15:38] Go and study.
[2:15:40] Where does it come from?
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; How does it end?
[2:15:46] That's how you need to know.
[2:15:48] How does the story go?
[2:15:52] You know the Bible is written. It starts
[2:15:54] on this issue.
[2:15:56] Stops in the middle. It starts on
[2:15:58] something else. It continues. maybe
[2:16:01] brings to conclusion again comes back to
[2:16:04] the other side and then he bring maybe
[2:16:06] another one. Now if you are not patient
[2:16:11] to read the whole way
[2:16:14] you're going to be confused.
[2:16:17] We need to study the word of God. Let us
[2:16:21] be like those people of Bair.
[2:16:24] You've only heard one scripture in
[2:16:26] church.
[2:16:27] Go back read more ABOUT IT.
[2:16:31] OH LORD, I'VE heard about Jezebel.
[2:16:36] How am I raising my children?
[2:16:40] Lord, I've heard about Jezebel.
[2:16:43] How am I as a wife?
[2:16:46] Lord, about
[2:16:49] how am I as a husband?
[2:16:53] What are my contribution to the kingdom
[2:16:55] of God?
[2:16:58] So now the Bible says those people of
[2:17:00] Bela
[2:17:02] they were doing well.
[2:17:04] Now see how how good it came out to be
[2:17:08] in Acts chapter 17.
[2:17:13] And then in verse 12
[2:17:16] therefore many of them believed also of
[2:17:19] honorable women which were Greeks and of
[2:17:22] men not a few.
[2:17:36] Now when you take that word,
[2:17:40] you desire father communion,
[2:17:45] the more you commune with him
[2:17:48] is the more he transforms your life
[2:17:52] is the more he helps you overcome your
[2:17:54] weaknesses.
[2:17:56] You find this spirit has gone away. You
[2:17:58] find the other spirit has gone away.
[2:18:00] Why? Because more light is coming in
[2:18:03] you.
[2:18:04] And as more light comes into you,
[2:18:07] darkness also goes away.
[2:18:10] And this is what we should always
[2:18:11] desire. Lord, I desire closer walk with
[2:18:14] you.
[2:18:16] Lord, I desire closer walk with you.
[2:18:19] In Acts chapter 13,
[2:18:22] the Bible says in verse 48,
[2:18:26] "And when the Gentiles heard this,
[2:18:31] they were glad and glorified the word of
[2:18:34] the Lord.
[2:18:36] As many as were ordained to eternal
[2:18:38] life,
[2:18:41] they lived. And the word of the Lord was
[2:18:44] published throughout all the region.
[2:18:49] Praise the name of the Lord. You need to
[2:18:51] desire a father communion with Christ,
[2:18:57] husband and wife.
[2:18:59] Praise the name of our Lord. If you in
[2:19:02] true relationship
[2:19:05] or in a true marriage,
[2:19:09] you'll always desire to be with one
[2:19:11] another.
[2:19:13] You'll always
[2:19:15] when one is away,
[2:19:17] you feel you miss.
[2:19:20] You just want to be close to one another
[2:19:24] close walk.
[2:19:26] If you even eating something,
[2:19:29] you remember I wish my husband would eat
[2:19:31] this. I wish my wife would eat this.
[2:19:36] That's the same thing with Christ and
[2:19:38] his bride.
[2:19:41] IS THAT CHRIST WHO DESIRE to feed the
[2:19:44] bride
[2:19:46] AND AS THE BRIDE I DESIRE TO COMMUNE
[2:19:50] with Christ
[2:19:52] why would you want to be like a widow
[2:19:56] because a widow doesn't have a man
[2:20:00] praise the name of our Lord let us not
[2:20:03] be like
[2:20:06] she was deserting the husband
[2:20:10] deserting the husband Those
[2:20:13] should be happening to the other immoral
[2:20:15] woman
[2:20:20] mystery Babylon.
[2:20:21] They have deserted the word of God.
[2:20:25] They don't want to have communion with
[2:20:27] Christ.
[2:20:29] They don't want his word. They don't
[2:20:32] want his spirit. They want other things.
[2:20:36] But as the elect lady,
[2:20:39] praise the name of the Lord. YOUR THE
[2:20:41] WORD OF THE LORD SHOULD ALWAYS BE YOUR
[2:20:44] desire
[2:20:46] like WHEN PETER SAID WHEN JESUS TOLD
[2:20:49] them would you also go
[2:20:53] say to whom shall we go praise the name
[2:20:56] of our lord that's a true wife
[2:21:00] that's a true bride
[2:21:04] there is nowhere else
[2:21:08] we came away from our parents we left at
[2:21:10] denomination.
[2:21:12] We are here to meet Christ.
[2:21:15] Praise the name of God. THAT SHOULD BE
[2:21:17] YOUR DESIRE.
[2:21:19] IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE the way you are
[2:21:20] behaving those days,
[2:21:24] whether you come to church, whether you
[2:21:26] don't
[2:21:27] cares that was those days
[2:21:32] when you are in the denomination,
[2:21:35] you know they don't care. The time they
[2:21:38] are timing
[2:21:40] is Christmas.
[2:21:42] So they are painting the churches,
[2:21:45] changing everything,
[2:21:48] choirs are singing,
[2:21:50] Christmas carols,
[2:21:53] Christmas and then now everything is
[2:21:55] being set
[2:21:57] until when the people are coming in the
[2:21:59] church.
[2:22:03] How was this one dressed?
[2:22:06] And when the the priest is preaching
[2:22:11] and then there are some ladies who just
[2:22:13] want to be real sin.
[2:22:18] So the door is the other side
[2:22:26] and then you know people with iPhones
[2:22:33] they always like going to the mirror.
[2:22:36] And then they they put it there so that
[2:22:39] you can't see that. Sure. This one is
[2:22:41] holding an iPhone.
[2:22:46] She makes a selfie.
[2:22:49] iPhone.
[2:22:51] So this one comes with some iPhone.
[2:22:54] Maybe they they call they make a call.
[2:22:57] Want to show the phone. Then other start
[2:23:00] looking at her.
[2:23:02] Hey, is this much money?
[2:23:06] earrings are this much money, the
[2:23:08] handbag,
[2:23:10] the clothing,
[2:23:12] the shoes.
[2:23:16] Sure,
[2:23:20] but we have left those things.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. When we
[2:23:25] come here, we come to meet Christ.
[2:23:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Just here
[2:23:30] we can have that interaction with
[2:23:32] Christ.
[2:23:35] Not what I have,
[2:23:38] not what I am.
[2:23:40] You know when we come to church,
[2:23:43] like when they were invited for the
[2:23:45] wedding service,
[2:23:48] there was a man at the entrance.
[2:23:51] He would give them the same role.
[2:23:56] Whether you are poor or you are rich,
[2:24:00] educated, not educated, you live in the
[2:24:03] village, you live in the town, all are
[2:24:06] given the same role.
[2:24:09] And when we come to Christ, he gives us
[2:24:11] the same robe.
[2:24:13] The Holy Spirit, righteousness,
[2:24:17] and that should be our desire.
[2:24:20] Lord, I want more of you.
[2:24:23] Praise the name of God. Why? because we
[2:24:25] are his bride
[2:24:28] should always make us happy
[2:24:30] to hear the word of God.
[2:24:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[2:24:36] message church age
[2:24:39] he says how can you tell the spirits
[2:24:42] apart?
[2:24:45] Give them the word test.
[2:24:50] That should be the same thing. Whose
[2:24:52] husband are you?
[2:24:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Whose whose
[2:24:58] wife are you?
[2:25:02] Whose spirit have you taken?
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Christ or the spirit of
[2:25:08] the devil.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. If you the
[2:25:12] bride of Christ, you have the spirit of
[2:25:15] Christ.
[2:25:16] SO THE SPIRIT OF Christ
[2:25:19] speaks to you
[2:25:21] not once,
[2:25:23] not twice, keeps on speaking to you.
[2:25:27] Even when you at home, the spirit
[2:25:29] speaks. When you're at your place of
[2:25:31] work, the spirit speaks. You don't limit
[2:25:35] the spirit speaking to you because the
[2:25:38] spirit dwells within you.
[2:25:41] And when THE SPIRIT IS SPEAKING to us,
[2:25:44] THE SPIRIT SPEAKS the word of God,
[2:25:47] praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[2:25:49] says, if they don't speak that word,
[2:25:53] they are of the evil one.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; As the evil one, deceived the first two
[2:26:00] brides.
[2:26:03] If we will try to deceive the bride of
[2:26:05] this last day
[2:26:08] by trying to get her to hybridize
[2:26:11] herself through crates
[2:26:16] or just plainly turning from the word
[2:26:22] and to any sign that suits her.
[2:26:29] God never placed signs
[2:26:33] ahead of the word.
[2:26:38] Now you know the Bible says these signs
[2:26:41] shall follow them.
[2:26:44] So we don't follow signs.
[2:26:46] We follow the word then the signs
[2:26:49] happen.
[2:26:51] Praise the name of our LORD BECAUSE THE
[2:26:52] BIBLE say that in the last days,
[2:26:57] the days that were living, Mark 24:4,
[2:27:02] many false prophets shall come,
[2:27:04] many false Christ shall come
[2:27:07] and they will be used of the Holy
[2:27:09] Spirit,
[2:27:11] but yet they are false.
[2:27:14] That's what the brother, brother
[2:27:16] Brennham preaches, the anointed ones at
[2:27:18] the end time.
[2:27:21] THE HOLY SPIRIT is the one doing the
[2:27:23] healing of the people. The Holy Spirit
[2:27:26] is the one prophesying.
[2:27:29] But this man is false.
[2:27:33] So you may follow what he says
[2:27:37] and you end up in destruction.
[2:27:40] So he says we don't follow signs.
[2:27:44] Then he says,
[2:27:46] "But God never placed signs ahead of the
[2:27:49] word.
[2:27:53] Signs follow the word
[2:27:57] as when Elijah told the woman
[2:28:00] to bake a cake
[2:28:03] for him first
[2:28:06] according to the word of the Lord."
[2:28:09] When she did as the word said,
[2:28:12] the proper sign came,
[2:28:17] come to the word first
[2:28:19] and then watch the miracle.
[2:28:22] The seed word
[2:28:25] is energized by the spirit.
[2:28:29] How can any messenger
[2:28:32] sent from God,
[2:28:36] how can any messenger sent from God
[2:28:40] believe only a part of the word
[2:28:44] and deny the other?
[2:28:47] The true prophet of God in this last
[2:28:50] days will proclaim the whole world.
[2:28:55] Denominations will hate him. His words
[2:28:58] may be as harsh as John the Baptist
[2:29:02] who called them vipers,
[2:29:05] but the predestinated
[2:29:08] will hear and be ready for the rapture.
[2:29:12] The royal seed of Abraham
[2:29:15] with like faith as Abraham
[2:29:19] will hold to the word
[2:29:21] with him for they are predestinated
[2:29:25] together.
[2:29:27] The last day messenger
[2:29:30] will appear in God's appointed time.
[2:29:34] It's the end time now.
[2:29:37] We all know for Israel is in her
[2:29:40] homeland.
[2:29:42] Any time now,
[2:29:44] he will come according to Malachi.
[2:29:48] When we see him, he will be dedicated to
[2:29:51] the world.
[2:29:53] He will be
[2:29:56] he will be indicated
[2:29:58] pointed out in the word
[2:30:02] revelations 10:7
[2:30:04] and God will vindicate his ministry.
[2:30:08] He will preach the truth as did Elijah
[2:30:11] and be ready for Mount Zion shut down.
[2:30:17] Many will misunderstand him because they
[2:30:21] have been taught scripture in a certain
[2:30:23] way
[2:30:26] which they consider the truth. When he
[2:30:29] comes against that,
[2:30:32] they will not believe. Even some true
[2:30:35] ministers
[2:30:37] will misunderstand the messenger
[2:30:41] because so much has been called God's
[2:30:44] truth by deceivers.
[2:30:49] But this prophet will come and the for
[2:30:53] as the forerunner of the first coming
[2:30:55] cried
[2:31:01] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[2:31:04] the sin of the world. So even he will no
[2:31:07] doubt cry out
[2:31:10] behold the lamb of God
[2:31:13] coming in glory. He will do this for
[2:31:17] even as John was the messenger of the
[2:31:19] truth to the elect.
[2:31:22] So this one the last messenger
[2:31:27] to the elect and the word born bride.
[2:31:32] Praise the name of our Lord. So God has
[2:31:35] sent us a messenger,
[2:31:37] a prophet in our generation
[2:31:40] with the word of God.
[2:31:43] Praise the name of our LORD THAT CALLS
[2:31:45] OUT OF organized religion
[2:31:48] and then he calls us that we can unite
[2:31:51] with the Lord Jesus
[2:31:53] in an invisible union
[2:31:57] that Christ can be formed in you.
[2:32:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Just like
[2:32:02] Paul when he was telling the church of
[2:32:05] Corinthians
[2:32:08] in 2 Corinthians chapter 11
[2:32:12] and then verse two he says
[2:32:16] I am jealous over you with godly
[2:32:19] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[2:32:22] husband that I may present you as a
[2:32:25] chest virgin to Christ.
[2:32:39] He says, "I've espoused you to Christ."
[2:32:44] There is only one husband.
[2:32:48] So, we need to hear Christ.
[2:32:51] He is our husband.
[2:32:54] Now, as a chest virgin,
[2:33:00] you only desire the seed of Christ,
[2:33:04] not another man's seed, not the devil's
[2:33:07] seed, not denominational seed, not the
[2:33:11] seed of science and
[2:33:14] the seed of God only.
[2:33:17] And the seed of God now HAS COME BY THE
[2:33:20] TRUE message of the earth.
[2:33:23] So you should take time, read this
[2:33:24] message book,
[2:33:26] hear them, praise the name OF OUR LORD,
[2:33:30] LOOK AT THE TIME YOU SPEND ON social
[2:33:31] media,
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; on Twitter, Twitter,
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; WhatsApp, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram
[2:33:39] and all of them. Find how much time you
[2:33:42] spend on the things.
[2:33:45] How much time
[2:33:47] do you spend
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; with Christ
[2:33:51] reading his word that you may know the
[2:33:53] mind of God for your life
[2:33:56] that you may know the season that we are
[2:33:58] living
[2:33:59] HOW MUCH TIME YOU LOOK AT Daniel
[2:34:04] was a prophet
[2:34:06] BUT EVEN DANIEL BEING A PROPHET
[2:34:09] A VERY BUSY man
[2:34:12] vice president vice president
[2:34:17] Now he says
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; I understood by books
[2:34:24] and for you understand
[2:34:27] Facebook
[2:34:36] there is this can you think the other
[2:34:38] pastor knows how to preach. Have you
[2:34:39] heard of him?
[2:34:43] You go on Tik Tok they have they have
[2:34:45] crooked it
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; then that gets in your mind another gets
[2:34:48] in your mind
[2:34:52] why don't you listen to the prophet
[2:34:53] those times
[2:34:57] go back and listen to the prophet
[2:35:01] these differences we have in the message
[2:35:05] are because people are misinterpreted
[2:35:11] one will come with this quote
[2:35:14] And when you look for it, you'll find
[2:35:16] it. Then you find your thinking starts
[2:35:19] changing.
[2:35:24] We went the other
[2:35:28] churches.
[2:35:30] Be careful.
[2:35:35] Too cold.
[2:35:40] And when you come start saying
[2:35:45] what
[2:35:53] now you see everything
[2:35:59] we are dying
[2:36:02] it's you is dying.
[2:36:04] Praise the name of
[2:36:07] the word.
[2:36:09] Praise the name of our Lord brings life.
[2:36:13] But somebody doesn't want to hear the
[2:36:15] word.
[2:36:19] And you know the devil is so smart.
[2:36:23] You know in the 70s and the 80s
[2:36:27] they used to call you they used to call
[2:36:30] local churches
[2:36:37] churches.
[2:36:42] And now when they saw that the youth are
[2:36:44] going to those churches of
[2:36:53] let us bring machines in the church. The
[2:36:54] youth are leaving us and so they started
[2:36:57] following the bandwagon.
[2:37:00] Now they start entertainment
[2:37:03] everything.
[2:37:05] Hey we are also there.
[2:37:09] But the thing is what is taught in that
[2:37:12] church because that's where the life is
[2:37:17] if the word is not given priority
[2:37:22] there is death there.
[2:37:25] So we NEED TO TAKE TIME GO and listen to
[2:37:28] the prophet
[2:37:31] go and hear the message of the earth.
[2:37:34] We have many message books.
[2:37:36] Take a book. Ensure that a week
[2:37:40] you're reading a message book.
[2:37:44] Let us say amen.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. The things
[2:37:49] are not new.
[2:37:52] We are just giving emphasis
[2:37:55] for your good.
[2:37:59] Go and take that message book.
[2:38:02] Start reading from the very beginning.
[2:38:06] Good evening friends.
[2:38:08] How are you? Then you hear you know the
[2:38:12] the testimony
[2:38:14] and sometimes when you're hearing that
[2:38:16] testimony
[2:38:18] it could be the problem you have at your
[2:38:19] house.
[2:38:21] Oh God you heal this child
[2:38:25] say Lord you can do the same thing. You
[2:38:29] know your faith is built.
[2:38:31] Lord help my daughter, my son. Lord help
[2:38:35] my mother. Lord help my father. Lord
[2:38:37] help my my neighbor. There's something
[2:38:40] that has moved you.
[2:38:43] Then you continue reading and you read
[2:38:45] another eight. This is the thing at a
[2:38:49] place of work. We had this challenge.
[2:38:52] Even this had the same challenge.
[2:38:54] This is what you do.
[2:38:57] You know you are learning.
[2:39:00] You're not going by only one quote,
[2:39:03] but you're getting a whole course menu
[2:39:07] from the beginning to the end. Praise
[2:39:11] the name of our Lord. Let us have that
[2:39:14] back.
[2:39:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Have your
[2:39:18] message book. Read it or listen to the
[2:39:22] text. MAYBE YOU'RE DRIVING. PUT ON THE
[2:39:26] VOICE OF THE PROPHET.
[2:39:28] listen to the message you are seated
[2:39:31] there. You know like when we go out in
[2:39:34] the mission field I always encourage
[2:39:36] those mas
[2:39:42] those who cannot read
[2:39:44] that get this book.
[2:39:48] You get a student who is learn one of
[2:39:51] those children.
[2:39:54] You tell them to come and read for you.
[2:39:55] sit down.
[2:40:02] There's something you're going to learn.
[2:40:06] Praise the name of our Lord. How about
[2:40:08] us now?
[2:40:11] All your eyes are focusing on the wrong
[2:40:13] focus. Wrong focus.
[2:40:17] And at the end of the day, you have
[2:40:19] wrong things in your mind. And you think
[2:40:22] wrong and you speak wrong and you do
[2:40:26] wrong.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; I don't know why my home is not. I don't
[2:40:30] know why my life.
[2:40:32] What do you feed on?
[2:40:35] Praise the name of what do you feed on?
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; What do you spend most of your time? So
[2:40:41] he says, I've espoused you as a chest
[2:40:43] virgin.
[2:40:45] to one husband
[2:40:48] even Christ. But I fear
[2:40:52] lest by enemies
[2:40:54] the servant as begile if through his
[2:40:57] subility.
[2:41:01] So your minds
[2:41:04] should be corrupted.
[2:41:07] What corrupts your mind?
[2:41:11] What defiles your mind?
[2:41:15] anything contrary to the word of God.
[2:41:19] So what should I do? LET ME GET BACK TO
[2:41:22] THE WORD.
[2:41:24] Christ is the groom.
[2:41:28] The word
[2:41:29] and as the elect lady,
[2:41:33] the bride of Christ,
[2:41:35] I have to be in continuous love with the
[2:41:38] word of God.
[2:41:41] Read the message books.
[2:41:43] Hear the voice.
[2:41:45] And when you read and hear the voice, be
[2:41:49] obedient to the word.
[2:41:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Be
[2:41:54] obedient.
[2:41:56] Don't despise it,
[2:41:58] but take it as my word,
[2:42:02] the word of God.
[2:42:04] I love the word of God.
[2:42:07] So, it gives you joy. It gives you
[2:42:10] peace. Praise the name of our Lord. That
[2:42:13] should be your desire.
[2:42:15] I KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS WE SHOULDN'T BE
[2:42:17] only hearers,
[2:42:20] but we should be doers of the word.
[2:42:23] Praise the name of our Lord. Let that
[2:42:25] word be manifested in my life.
[2:42:28] Let that word be manifested in my heart.
[2:42:31] Let that word BE MANIFESTED
[2:42:33] EVEN AT MY PLACE OF WORK. EVEN WHEN I'VE
[2:42:36] NOT TOLD THE PERSON I'M SAFE,
[2:42:39] BUT WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOU as a human,
[2:42:42] you must be saved. The word is putting
[2:42:45] on flesh.
[2:42:47] And when the rapture is to take place,
[2:42:50] praise the name of Lord, the rapture is
[2:42:52] not going to take Bibles.
[2:42:56] The rapture is not going to take message
[2:42:59] books.
[2:43:01] But to qualify for the rapture,
[2:43:05] YOU get the message of the hour.
[2:43:08] Let it be a living reality in your life.
[2:43:11] And then it gives you the power to be
[2:43:14] part of the rapture.
[2:43:16] Praise the name of Lord. That's what is
[2:43:18] going to happen.
[2:43:20] So are you preparing yourself?
[2:43:24] Praise the name of our Lord. How much
[2:43:26] have you put inside?
[2:43:30] Are you really feeding?
[2:43:32] We need to be like the people of Bair,
[2:43:35] daily waiting on the Lord, daily reading
[2:43:38] the word. And the Bible says, God would
[2:43:42] come daily.
[2:43:44] God would come daily,
[2:43:46] a communion, a time of fellowship.
[2:43:50] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:43:53] You know, you have your own husband.
[2:43:58] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:44:01] There are no
[2:44:04] you know when you come from those
[2:44:06] polygamous families
[2:44:13] every wife has the time for the wife.
[2:44:23] But this time it's only you as the wife
[2:44:27] and only one husband.
[2:44:30] continuous communion.
[2:44:35] But now what's happening?
[2:44:37] You get this woman here.
[2:44:41] She doesn't have only one husband.
[2:44:48] You know, if I waste too much time on
[2:44:49] the word,
[2:44:52] we shall eat shall eat.
[2:44:59] I've given you a turn of Sunday.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; Monday, don't tell me about God.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; I have another husband.
[2:45:12] Tuesday then on Wednesday,
[2:45:16] okay, maybe
[2:45:18] let me call him.
[2:45:22] We shouldn't do like that. Supposing
[2:45:24] comes on Monday.
[2:45:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Supposing
[2:45:30] he comes on Monday,
[2:45:32] you're going to be left behind
[2:45:35] and you know the tribulation period
[2:45:38] is not a pleasant time to be on earth.
[2:45:42] Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[2:45:44] better make our preparations ready.
[2:45:48] Make sure you are born again.
[2:45:51] Make sure you have the life of Jesus
[2:45:53] Christ. Make sure you're living the life
[2:45:55] of Jesus.
[2:45:57] Praise the name of our Lord. I'm not
[2:45:59] going to continue. We shall continue in
[2:46:02] the afternoon on this same subject.
[2:46:06] May God bless you.
[2:46:08] Amen. Let us sing that song Grace. Grace
[2:46:12] as the song leader comes.
[2:46:16] We shall continue with the same subject
[2:46:18] in the afternoon.
[2:46:21] Marvelous grace of our loving. Let us
[2:46:23] stand up.
[2:46:25] far to end.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; Marvelous grace of our loving
[2:46:32] Lord.
[2:46:33] Grace that exceeds our sins and our guil
[2:46:40] on Calary's bount
[2:46:47] where the blood of the lamb was. Oh
[2:46:53] grace
[2:46:55] grace,
[2:46:56] God's
[2:46:58] grace,
[2:47:00] grace that will part and bless with
[2:47:04] thee.
