father you may speak to us according to your Divine Purpose we also bring all our bur and needs before you knowing that Lord you care father May Grant every may you grant every heart's desire Lord and bless us together Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm sorry I came a little bit late praise the name of the Lord let us go to John 4 John and then we starting from verse 9 the Bible says then say the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew ask drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans a Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knowest the gift of God and who it is that says to thee give me to drink thou do have asked of him and he would have given thee Li says unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from when then thou Hast that Living Water may God bless of his word we may be seated I've seen our sister from sister Faith is it so I want to preach on knowing the gift of God praise the name of our Lord knowing the gift of God so now the Lord Jesus Christ he met this woman at the well the woman found Christ sitting there at the praise the name of our Lord and then you know how brother Bram tells us and said that Jesus was contacting her spirit that's why he started talking to her you know from a common ground give me some water to drink you know because Jesus was already there and then he wanted to get the attention of this woman and then she starts giving reason that we have no dealings the Samaritans and the Jews and then Jesus draws her attention that it's not only the drink is asking her to give him but he wanted her to know the gift of God and that gift of God was Christ himself praise the name of the Lord say if you can know the gift of God praise the name of our Lord you would have asked him and he would have given you living water praise the name of the Lord now we see that this scenario that when Christ kept on talking to the woman then he was able to know what her problem was and then her problem was about unclean living she was living in immorality and then he starts that can you bring your husband don't have but then she was living with man there at home and then you know when Christ kept on you know desending father her life the woman was awakened spiritually and then she started talking about worship and then said that you know tell us that we should come and worship at Jerusalem Jem praise the name of our Lord now Christ was revealing the gift of God to the woman until it draw the attention of the woman toire toship to desire living water and then she said I you are a prophet and when the Messiah cometh he will tell us this things and then Jesus declares to her I am he praise the name of the Lord and then she was able to get into true worship praise the name of the Lord even as if we can get to know the gift of God what God has given to us then we shall be blessed by the gift of God prise the name of the Lord and brother tells us approach to the gift of God you towards the gift of God will either bless you praise the name of our Lord it will bless you so now even us we need to recognize the gift of God that God has given to us and then that's how we shall be blessed when we know the gift of God we shall be blessed by God using that gift praise the name of you know when Jesus was before the people when Jesus was before the people you know the Pharisees came and then they were asking him who who gave you that power they were not blessed they were not blessed praise the name of our Lord but when the publicans came you know they were repenting they were turning away from their evil ways the same thing when they come to John the Baptist when they come to John the Baptist the the Sinners they were asking John what shall we do praise the name of our Lord and then he was telling them what they should do and when they were obedient they were blessed by the gift of God but when the priests came to John when the phes came to John they were asking him who are you praise the name of our Lord and they were not blessed praise the name of our Lord so now we need to see that we have a right approach to the gift of God praise the name of our Lord must the right approach to the gift of God if we are going to be blessed by the gift of God and we must have faith that you know that gift will bless us brother Bram was a gift to our age was a gift to the age when brother the angel told him when if the people believe you in words if they accept you if they believe what you are telling them there is nothing going to stand between you and cancer and that is also the same thing also to us that any gift that God gives to us we need to believe that gift praise the name of our Lord God gave us Christ as a gift to the world to give us eternal life praise the name of the Lord if you don't believe Christ you can't have eternal life praise the name of the Lord so if we are going to be blessed by the gift of Christ then we need to believe that gift we need to accept that gift we need to obey that gift praise the name of our Lord the Holy Ghost is a gift that is given to the church to guide us to teach us to comfort us EMP power us to tutor us as long as we are able to believe that gift as long as we able to know that gift a personal relationship with the Holy Ghost then the purpose of the holy spirit will be fulfilled in our lives praise the name of our the fivefold ministry are gifts to the body of Jesus Christ that God has given to us so if we can receive the fivefold ministry then we shall be blessed of the lord we shall be positionally placed in our position and then we shall not have that thing of running up and down you know running from this church to the other Church you are running with this again anotherr praise the name of the Lord and you know as members of this church you know it's not us to go and look for the gifts where they are praise the name of our Lord the gift will find us here praise the name of the Lord not saying let me leave this church now evangelist maybe I run to and then I live where I feed from praise the name of Lord you don't eat balanced diet by by eating from the neighbor's home praise the name of Lord praise the name of the Lord you know children are not raised from the neighbor home I've taken long without eating meat then I go to my neighbor you don't know what is prepared there praise the name of our Lord but the gift will find us here praise the name of our Lord because you have an overseer praise the name of our Lord gift of that God has given to us to raise us to shepher us to feed us so he oversees every spirit that comes with praise the name of our Lord when you go AR when you go to some of those places the P may not know what you're going to feed on praise the name of the Lord and then you may find that you are eating maybe wild GS there's that in second Kings chapter 2 second Kings chapter 4 praise the name of our Lord let us go to the book of Second Kings Second Kings and then we going reading in chapter beg your pardon Second Kings let us go the book of second Kings chapter 2 and then we read in verse I beg your pardon so the sons of the Prophet had going to get to go and get food from the field and now they L the spirit of discernment so they were they were able to get GS because they were hungry and then they cooked it and they found that there was poison in the pot and then they cry to the prophet oh there's death in the pot praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we recognize the gift that God has given to us praise the name of our and receive the gift the Bible says that receives a prophet in the name of the Prophet receives the prophet's blessing he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receives a righteous man and that's the same thing about all the gifts of God when the woman at the well when she recognized the gift of Christ and then he said oh give me to drink of that Living Water you know she desired Christ until when Christ revealed her life she said you are a prophet so she was blessed by the gift of Jesus Christ but now when the Pharisees criticize that gift when thees rejected that gift they will not be able to be blessed by the gift praise the name of our Lord now in the message it shall be even as it was told me he says looking around over the city and seeing the conditions walking in the city and see many of the people go out this gift is a pioneering it must go into places it must bring for there will be people who will follow me in here gopel ministers and so forth with revivals but first before you can get the people there's got to be a Godly demonstration of something to pull the people to let them recognize that it is the truth that is right and now notice the meetings are glorious and wonderful and I love you all gifts must be confirmed anyone can say anything they wish to and they can have impressions but when God really sent something he will vindicate that to be the truth God will speak of it the Bible said in Hebrews God testifying of his gifts Hebrews 11 the is that right God testifying then you got God's testimony the holy spirit is the gift of God you believe it when he comes to you he will testify that it is there all God's gifts testify it isn't nothing you try to make work you got to be positive now a confirmation of the presence of God is that he's here through the word then he's here through the gifts now notice they work and how they are confirmed then he says quickly I shall hurry quickly now and your faith is getting real high I believe just about as high as I can see faith the thing you need now is to let your faith lose but what you you you you are wondering is to get up here on the platform seeing those people healed here but if you just turn yourself your faith lose out there where you are it will be just the same where you are it is your faith anyhow it is your faith only faith is the way to get it from God anything you get salvation forgiveness anything comes from God through faith you believe it you accept it praise the name of our so now when God sends us a gift we must have faith in that gift this gift is going to help me praise the name of the Lord but if you don't have faith in the gift of God there is no way the gift of God is going to help you praise the name of the Lord and this is how God wants us to relate with whatever gift he puts in our midst praise the name of our Lord and being part of the body of Jesus Christ we all have various gifts praise the name of our Lord so you must believe that one whose gift is going to bless you you must believe that the other one's gift is going to benefit you praise the name of our Lord and this is how the body can really grow up recognizing the gift that God has put in our mid and then cherishing this gift praise the name of our Lord so now as we have been saying the fivefold ministry is a gift to the [Music] body a pastor is a gift to the church praise the name of our and then now in your family praise the name of our Lord your wife is a gift to you even your husband is a gift to you and each of them have got their positions a wife is a gift to the husband as a helpmate and then a husband is a gift to the wife as the head praise the name of our Lord then the parents are gifts to the children to raise them to nurture them to provide for them to guide them and so you find that each and every one of us we have been blessed by various gifts praise the name of our Lord church we are blessed with the pastor when we go home we are blessed with our families even as parents your children are a gift to you praise the name of our Lord there are gifts to you and now if God has given us a gift you need to cherish the gift that God has given you we need to embrace the gifts that God has given to us praise the name of our Lord God has given you children he gives them to you to bring your Generations you know they are they your Generations you know your generation is passing through that the Bible says that the book of the generation of let us go to Genesis 5 verse1 the Bible says this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of of God made him so then he starts mentioning all the people that came from a generation praise the name of our Lord you bringing offsprings you know and then they go to Future Generations so children are a gift to a family praise the name of our Lord so you need to see that you cherish whatever gift that God has given to us and then even us as members of the body of Christ we are a gift one to another every one of us is a gift to another person as the body of Christ if we are members we are a gift to one [Music] another praise the name of our Lord so there is a way we can bless one another and now in the body we have various gifts praise the name of the Lord and even these gifts that we have are of different measures praise the name of our Lord we may have the same gift but the measure is different based on the grace that God has given to us the Bible says he gave some five talents and then another two talents based on their several abilities praise the name of the Lord so if God has given you a small measure don't despise that small measure and then you go and bury it but you know use that small measure God has given you that you can build the kingdom of God let us go to MTH 25:4 the Bible says for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his Goods Matthew [Music] [Music] 25:14 so the Bible says he delivered them to them his Goods so each of us we have been there are Goods that God has delivered to us he has gifted Us in various ways so whatever he has delivered with us he wants us to use it to establish his Kingdom praise the name of at your place of work God has put you there to be an example of a true Christian that's why God has placed you in that position and if God's time is up he will take you away from there but as long as God has placed you there he wants you to trade his talent the life he has given you he wants you to show it to the people to demonstrate it to the people that there are still people who fear God there are still people who are faithful there are still people who are sincere there are still people who follow the word of God and then when you are there you need to testify of the name of the Lord when the woman at the well she got the revelation of Jesus Christ she didn't hold the Revelation to herself but she went and declared the gift of God to the other people telling them come and see come and see this man who has told me all about my life the name of our Lord even at our places of work let us interest the people you know to know what we believe to testify to them the gospel that we have to testify to them the message that we have believed tell them this is what I believe and this is what God has blessed me with this is what has kept me upright up to now and invite them come Fellowship together praise the name of the Lord you are trading your gift you are not buing it you're not hiding yourself but know when they see your life and then they tear what you are speaking they said these things much together then he says in verse 15 and to one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey now praise the name of the Lord so our measures may be are different but based on the ability that God has given to us he wants us to train this Talent he wants us to train these gifts to bring more children to the kingdom of God that you yield yourself to God that God may use you that the spirit of God himself who gives the gifts we have come and operate his own gift that has blessed us with praise the name of the Lord the eternal life he has given you he wants others also to get that same eternal life prise the name of Lord look at Cornelius when Corel the vision of the Angel he didn't just keep quiet about it but he told even his friends told his neighbors he told his relatives and then told them come we are going to have a meeting at home what the Lord has has prepared for us and that should always be our desire also the places that we're living in interest your neighbors tell your neighbors about what you believe tell your families about what you believe where you are studying from let others know what you believe let know God has given us a message praise the name of the Lord then you are trading your talent you are making many people to know what God is doing in your life praise the name of our Lord now in the message The Works that I do bear The Works that I do bear witness of me he says now we pass over those things these great words that we learn and things that we do and gifts and everything that is fine but you would better get the giver before you start after the gift God can't trust his gift with everybody do you believe that when God gives you a gift you have to watch what you are doing with it do you believe that praise the name of so when God blesses us with gifts he says we have to watch what we use the gift then he says did you know a man could take a gift of God and send his soul to hell with it do you believe that praise the name of the Lord so as God has blessed us we need to use the gifts of God to build the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord we allow the Holy Spirit to to use Us Praise the name of our Lord to bring to manifestation the ability that God has blessed us with praise the name of the Lord then the message the Angel and the commission he says now watch the gift is what God has sent down now if he sent it in the form of a brass serpent water whatever it is you believe not the water not the serpent but the gift of God is that right the BR serent did not pray for nobody neither could the pool of water pray for anybody but God said Jesus ascended on high he gave gifts back to man and now of course God operates by the Holy Spirit through man man is God's agent praise the name of the Lord now you see how God has blessed us with several gifts when the snakes were killing the people in the wilderness brother says he gave them the BR serent as a gift thato looks at theen serpent he was praise the name of our Lord so you see that God has put several gifts in our midst to edify us to deliver us so in whatever station you may get yourself there always a gift of God has put there to deliver you out of that St praise the name of our Lord there's a gift that God has put there in the in the years after the breast serent you know he they were were there was a pool of water and then the Bible says that an angel would come and travel the water and soever was dropping in that water he would be healed praise the name of the Lord now you imagine how they were living in the Old Testament only one person to be healed in the when Falls during the times of el the Bible says only one leper was healed but right now the Bible says Christ has ascended and when he ascended he has given gifts to men praise the name of our Lord so right now we have no limit praise the name of our Lord all that we have need of is actually in Christ so it's now your faith in Christ that will bring the gift of God to manifestation praise the name of our Lord this is how God is so gracious until now praise the name of our Lord in the Old Testament he would tell the lepers you go and offer a sacrifice to the priests to be healed but right now the Bible says we are Kings and Priests praise the name of the Lord you can pray for somebody who is sick praise the name of our Lord and you can bless them praise the name of our Lord the Bible says if you believe in The Book of Mark chapter 16 let us go and read that scripture Mark 16 and then verse 1 he says and this signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hand on the sick shall recover who the Believers praise the name of the Lord so we are all endued with gifts praise the name of the Lord like maybe at home you know the devil likes attacking children when it's deep in the Night 2 a 2 a maybe the phones are off can pick you and the devil attacks anybody at your home take this scripture the name of our Lord as a remedy then you lay hand on the sick and pray for that person the Bible says they shall recover praise the name of our Lord so God has endued us with various gifts but then we need to know how to use the gifts that God has given us praise the name of our Lord in the time of need know what what to apply praise the name of our Lord know what scripture background you're standing on know where your backup is and then you can Proclaim that gift the believer a brother or sister can pray for the person and they are healed praise the name of Lord Brother gives a testimony you know he was conducting a prayer line and then there was a mother who was carrying a sick child but now there was also another mother in that meeting and then that mother was moved by compassion and then in her heart she felt she needed to go and pray for that child and then the mother who had a sick child was in the prayer line so now she went to the mother excuse me I want to pray for your child she laid hands on the child prayed for the child said that but you can continue in the prayer line so now when these people came before brother brother Vision said that your child was healed when the other mother prayed for her praise the name of Lord so we have been given this Authority that you can have faith you can have faith and then you use the faith you can have compassion love for one another and then you can go and stand in the person's position and then they are delivered praise the name of our Lord we need to recognize the gift of God that he has given to us praise the name of our Lord that you can bless another person you can help another person you can deliver another person you can witness to another person and they can also get saved they can also stand strong they can overcome their weaknesses each and every one of us as members of the body of Jesus Christ we need to recognize the gift of God when we know the gift of God we shall be able to use that gift to bless others praise the name of Lord you can bless others who are your neighbors you can bless others who are your friends tell them about the goodness of God and then you see them turning away from their evil ways tell them how the Lord desires their lives and then you can see them accept the Lord Jesus as their personal savior praise the name of our Lord we need to recognize the gift of God that he has given to us and then when we use that gift of God we shall be in position to establish the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord just to see that we use the gift of God in the right way and being faithful you know to trade that gift how do you trade the gift praise the name of by doing according to the word of God when you get somebody sick pray for them when you get somebody somebody doing something wrong tell them what they're doing is wrong there is a better way to handle things praise the name of Lord and you know you just don't be only passive they just silent name of Lord tell them the goodness of God share with them the Gospel of Jesus Christ tell them God has sent us a prophet praise the name of our Lord you know it is very there are so many things in the message which you can share with people praise the name of the Lord you can tell them about brother Bram baptizing on River Ohio 193 and then that light came down and then the voice said as John the Baptist was sent for the first coming of Jesus Christ so we have a message that prepares us for the second coming of you can pick many things that have been happening in our AG you can talk to them about the seven Visions God told Brother Bram in 1933 that all these things are going to happen before the end of the world praise the name of the Lord tell them about attacking ethopia they would said this happened praise the name of tell them about the second world how brother prophesied 1933 about it tell themy advances you know and now we are seeing them happening now you have many things you can use in the message to draw people's attention to the word of God how about the revelation of the Book of Revelation you can tell them the Mysteries have been revealed you are trading your talent the gift that is in you the eternal life you are causing another person to come and drink of the same praise the name of our Lord now in the Book of John 4 John chapter 4 and then verse 14 the Bible says but soever drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life praise the name so if you have become a well of water you've become a well of water because you have drunk from Christ but there are people who have not yet drunk from the will of Christ that's why Christ has put you there that's why Christ has also made you a gift to the place where you work that's why Christ made you a gift to the place where you start from that's why Christ has made you a gift at your family where you living in and then you have that well of God's water you are a well praise the name of the Lord and a well keeps on flowing praise the name of our Lord a well is not

to them and if they recognize that this person is a person of God praise the name of our Lord they recognize God and you testify to them turn away from your evil ways turn away from your wicked ways and come to the Lord the name of our Lord Jesus told that woman I will give you living water and indeed when she drank of that water she didn't keep quiet she went to the city come and here come and here this come and here and the Bible says the whole city believed John 14 and verse 29 verse 39 and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that I ever did John 4:39 you John chapter 14 chter 4: 39 praise the name of the Lord the Bible says many Samaritans believed because of the saying of the woman which testified what testimony are you giving out to the people how are you trading your talent how are you trading your gift this woman went and testified and many people believed and the Bible says when the Samaritans believed they came to Jesus when you testify bring them to Christ let them come and drink of the living Fountain let them come and know the gift of God and they also become a gift of God to others so the Bible says in verse so when the Samaritans came unto him they besought him that he would t with them and ab there two days and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have had them ourselves and not that this indeed the Christ the savior of the world praise the name of Lord when they came to Christ she's the one who showed them Christ we need also to show the people Christ we need to show the people the message that we have received this is what I believe this is my testimony when believe they will have a personal revelation of who Christ is and when they get a personal revelation they also tell others praise the name of the fountain is Flowing it's not stopping at you but it keeps on flowing flowing praise the name of our Lord at the time where we are looking for the last elect praise the name of Lord how will they know if somebody doesn't tell them praise the name of our Lord how will they drink if somebody doesn't release the Living Water to them
