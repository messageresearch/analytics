God may he be there father to inspire them Lord to RTO them all you want them to know about you and thank you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's turn to the Book of Luke chap 15 and the scripture says either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she has found it she call her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost let's once moreci Lord we pray that may you come and bless your word in Jesus's name we pray you may take your seat praise the name of the Lord I just want to speak to you this evening on the subject of the sac value amen the value so I I'm believing that God will speak to each one of us this evening so to begin with uh sacred value so sa sa means something that is highly valued something that is important something that is Holy is not must holy praise the name of the Lord and when I talk about value this evening I want us talk about two compound meanings of value as things that are that deserve a high you know regard something that is very important something that is very useful praise the name of the Lord and in this definition of values I want to talk about the things that are so much useful the things that are so much significant in the life of a Christian praise the name of Lord and these same things are principles or ethics or morals of Christianity these are behaviors or you know in games they call them rules of conduct praise the name of the Lord so and then another definition I want to deal with this evening value as one that is something of great worth that Christian would want to you know invest in that every Christian would want to see that he participate or takes part of that praise the name of the Lord so heaven heaven and earth shall pass away the things on this Earth shall pass away there is nothing Eternal except the sa Souls praise the name of the Lord all the efforts of M will go to D at the end of the road except the souls of men that have been saved praise the name of the Lord the of a Believer praise the name of the Lord example a person who is going to marry like my brother here any time once he hears the call he will be looking for someone to praise the name of the so he will have to look for a specific you are we together you have to look for a specific character and that's the that is the you know that's the measure that is going to use to settle upon a specific sister like other when you're looking for a wife you look for a specific character specific value the name of the Lord and our character many times we have heard when we are going to begin you know when when we are going to get into the marriage phase you are told look for character know one time brother asked me what do you mean by character the name of the Lord you know so character is a distinguishing future praise the name of the Lord a trait a complex of trait or a mixture of traits that makes a person or a group or a breed or a breed so different from another and that's the same way that's the same way that a Christian should be in this world to have a specific value distinguish you the rest of the people the name of the Lord I want to get into this spot here where the Prophet was talking about a hunter know the field to hun and he says and you have to know the characteristic of the animal that you are hunting or sometimes you can be certainly deceived for instance like the stone ship the stone ship way up in in British Colombia [Music] praise the name of the Lord now he was giving an example that for example when you're going to hunt and you're looking for a ship there is a certain kind of ship called the stone ship this ship looks so similar to the there and he says he continues down and say now if you didn't know the difference when you was going to track a ship over there you couldn't tell the difference unless you was a shrewd Hunter you a shrew Hunter because they make the same kind of tracks they bound when they run away and when you see one standing at a distance with his head you hardly know the difference praise the name of the Lord so you must have the the specific state of a specific animal before before you go to H and then he says in paragraph 15 the goat walking also and the goat walking also there is a characteristic in a goat under ship that you would have to know the difference in them when you were up high because they both dwell high in the mountain you have to know the difference but if you notice God stumbles himself as he walks while a sheep sits his feet down like this the the characteristic of the way he makes his tracks your game by the characteristic of of what it does and how it acts Lord so for us to know who we are for us to examine ourselves where we are standing we go to look into the the law of Liberty the the scripture What is the characteristic of the child of God let's start the book of Galatians chapter for As We Lay a little bit of a foundation for us to stand on praise the name of the Lordan he says now I say now I say that the hair as long as he is a child defer nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so Paul here is telling us that a child that is born in a family he has no difference with a servant yet he is theable the son of the father but why is he considered as he is not yet his as as much as the servant why is he considered like that because the trait of the fathered in this sun Paul says that until the time appointed when the father has designated specific tutors and govern to this son here until this child reflect the same trait of the Father the same character of the Father the same value of the Father the father will come publicly and say this is my son him today that he can run all my functions my duties praise the name of the Lord so as long as the son does not have the gene of the father or the trait of the father can't be declared publicly I hope you following me friends amen he say in the message here when a boy was born that boy was was his was his son by birth but yet that son did not fall hair to everything until he became of age and the father tested his character praise the name of the Lord son couldn't inherit everything until his character was tested it is the same as the fathers and then he continues and says now in the Old Testament when this baby boy was born father hired a tutor a teacher a rer and to get this rer many of you know the galatian letter Paul writing like to us in this picking out the [Music] thisor the father picked out the best man that he could find for the job because he was certainly interested in his child and any fathers any father any father is that way that's a real father that's just the love of a parent to her child and his father went around and found the bestor that could raise his son could bring up his son educate son and teach his son to follow his Father's Footsteps and this tutor was to bring message to the father how the child was progressing and this tutor was to bring message to the father how the child was progressing now all that was a type of the church today for when God brought us into his kingdom by of the Holy Ghost and become a child of God God sent us the bestor but there was in all Heaven the Holy Spirit he is to Nature and to bring up and to raise and to teach the church brother we need the Holy Spirit and this the prophet says that the tutor is the Holy Spirit and the purpose of the tutor to bring the character of the father in you the father you know be so he gives you the holy spirit for the Holy Spirit to take charge of everything in your world not you it is the spirit of God that is teaching that is tutoring and the key that you need in your Lifey what the tutor tell as as you son disobey Judah will not take you to the Father the examination because the prophet has told us Jud rather the father had to test the CH the character was his own prise the name of the Lord so value we are talking about the sa Value SA that's we can say the Divine value praise the name of the Lord so the value that we are talking about is what the prophet is referring to as the character every child of God must get these sacred values life for him to walk daily praise the name of the Lord so we see that the J's role was to bring the perfect value of the father in this boy without that the father couldn't publicly declare the son Lord it wasn't the sun chice of who the tutor is today people want to have their own choice about the tutor as long as I'm a religious that's what I need a Christian must receive the tutor that comes from God spirit and once you reject the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord before you even receive the spirit you must receive the word of God believe it so when you believe the word of God when go you know the Paul says Paul says that once you believe the word of God is obligation the Holy Spirit it is not when you believe but after you believe God gives you the the holy to you to bring out the G bring out the character of God in you so L of that there no public declaration the sa values so the Jud was identified by the father and the had full authority of the over the son it is not saying that God is that Jesus Christ is my Lord is not training in your body he has to be your lord and has full authority over you whatever he wants in your life you see not to see that you know on Sunday I'm anointed I'm inspired I'm a Christian on Tuesday on Wednesday THS you are not that that's not what this son was a true Son of God accept the tutor to do the work daily there was no public every other day was on duty son was in the field what the fathered the TR praise the name of the Lord so we see here obedience the was all the son needed toing the father's values praise the name of the Lord so we must accept to go through child training we must accept to go through child training his reflecting image right in us his fullness praise the name of the Lord total surrender theor that's what brought the value son here want you love to surrender the Holy Spirit want you love to surrender the TR may bring out his own virtue you let's turn to the book of First Peter here and make this a little bit clear brother second pter one he says in verse according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue now he says according as his divine power divine power the power that Christ talked about inse receive when the truth has come in and what does this tror do he brings down the Vues praise the name of the Lord and he says in verse four whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises be partakers of the divine nature having es the corruption that is in the world and then he say and besides this giving all diligence [Music] giving to your add to your faue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and temperance patience to patience brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness all this it is not your work it is the work that you can manest if you obey praise the name of the Lord that is the Divine values that God wants to see you see and he verse for if these things be in [Music] you they have to be in you and not just to be in you but they don't have effect they must abound they must do something and then he says they make you that you shall neither be baren in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ he that La these things is blind and cannot see a far have this virtues here says you can't be Buren the fruit of the spirit the fruit in it due season because the vacu that of the Son of God Is Right In you let's look another here in the book of Galatians 5 here says in verse 22 but the spirit of but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faithness Temperance SE there is no so this all together second verse and this Gans 5 verse2 the prophet tells us that these are the head of the woman that she searched for praise the name of the Lord let's pick up that scripture and then we you know we get down into our subject he says in Luke 15:8 where we read first either what man either what woman having 10 pieces Luke 15 either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it praise the name of the Lord so this woman had 10 tablets in her head she lost one when she knew the husband is coming back had to sweep the at night she couldn't risk her husband to come back she doesn't have the praise the name of the Lord and like any other woman you know what trait your husband loves most we we spoke here with brother that as you're going to Mar for a specificate you look for for a specific this that you're looking for is not something that is going to perish tomorrow that is Everlasting that will not let you go into hell that means Holiness that is true praise the name of the Lord so when people are telling you when people are telling you look for a character friend man is character man is character of you see that someone may tell you she has Le she has a piece of land you can go for her that's of it own another will tell you she has money you will not suffer that's another tra but a Son of God we look for that value not going away that value you back God and every woman knows that this is the character hband knows that once I lost is as much as I've lost him my husband wants to see this display the Lord with his church he wants to see that character that tra that we have talked about reflected in his church in his every day not only on Sunday is in the second coming of the Lord it say it is late than we think we don't come to church few we do not come to church to hear a good sermon or come to church to hear good music they all got their place the of but what we better come to church to do take up with God our soul salv the day of redemption is near say Jesus Christ son like this he said to a woman in our subject tonight we find this woman her husband had gone and she had lost one of the coins out of her taet and he says here in paragraph 56 today if a woman is married she should wear a wedding GRE saying that she's married that is to keep other men from they look and they see she's marri in those days they didn't have wedding rinks they had a tablet they put on their head it had 10 coins and it went around their head and that was as saying they were a married woman and no man was to fool with them nobody was to flatter with them they married praise the name of the Lord and he continues down and say it was placed in there and each que meant a certain Vue of that woman and he says the first meaning her love to her husband second her pledge of Vue to to live clean for him and theth see the prophet is trying to expl and says that all these tablets each had a meaning and then says the first one was her love to husband she lose the love of husband the second one The Virtue to live clean for him the and that's why this woman let's continue here in paragraph 59 he says if you want to look it up look in Galatians 5 you find out that that woman represented the church and the church is an Expos wife to Christ the that the church is a to we found the name of the Lord where we read the spirit talking about love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness the prophet says this is theet of the of Jesus Christ that's the tablet that's supposed to be wor in the church he go to Second Peter chapter 1 and he say Brotherly Love fellowship and this woman must have been long about that that she realized that she had lost one of those qus but when she realized the prophet says that it has been it must have been a little bit longer it must have been dark and then it says in paragraph 61 if there ever was a time the church to take inventory to find out if you've got all the co to find out whe love is there you have that of the Fai is there the word of God abah thought the of sah was there said it's going to be praise the name of Lord and the prophet says this is the time that we should examine ourselves and find out is Joy there patience there gentl there goodness there weakness there Temperance there are youing them in your season inventory the is at hand Prophet says here it should be now it's getting dark the veil HS and clouds of destroying civilization is hanging over immorality on every hand we are living in a tremendous time when there is wickedness people who go to church sh sh means when they not meaning it they come to church but is for a formality people who go to church try to hide from their meanness they have lost a certain taet a certain vum to cover it up they don't come to you know to examine themselves but they come to hat it praise the name of the Lord and the prophet continues and say people who go to church and profess Christianity live like the rest of the world smoking gambling dress dressed wearing clothes that they ought not wear their own dressing room out of the streets before the public and brother Brotherly Love is a thing that is passing praise the the name of the Lord we have to take inventory you see the this woman woman she realized how did she know because maybe she lost it in the morning but she wasn't taking inventory going through oh is it there is it there is it there we' go to take event that the Val beone you see and then he says here in paragraph 62 was getting night and remember her husband would return found her one of those que out it showed she had been marked a hot and if she had filed and it was seen by the people they brought her before the priest and brought witness that she had been found such and the priest seen that she was married took the que out of her tablet that she had been doing wrong praise the name of the Lord so the prophet is telling us here that if one was out she had to be taken to the priest you know there's a scripture in the book of Galatians chapter 3 it says in verse 27 for as many as for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ Galatians chapter 3 praise the name of the Lord now Paul is telling us as long as you were baptized in Christ not being baptized in a certain religion being baptized in Christ you see the scripture can't be broken you have to put on Christ how do you put on Christ by putting on the Vues by putting on his tra he said he that believeth on me the same work that I did shall do also so when you are baptized in Christ Christ himself comes and be your dress comes and be your dressing we comes and be reflected on you that whoever looks at you sees Christ praise the name of the Lord because you have been baptized into Christ when you baptized into is a religion that's why the prophet says people and ask them are you Christian and they say no I'm a Catholic why they were baptized into the this evening you have been baptized in Christ you will put on that Christ and that's what the prophet is telling this woman she had to look for the for the tablet and when that tablet was not F to the priest told her and told him she has lost it and when the husband came found that she didn't have that taet the husband was free to put her away praise the name of the Lord and that is anonymous to the foolish virgin where the scpt says that when the bridegroom came and they didn't have the wife praise the name of the Lord I want to Tye that this evening one of the values with one of the tablets when the bridegroom comes and he doesn't find it there we shouldn't stand there the prophet in paragraph 65 the church better examines by the word of God our our our devotion will become T tar cigarette smokers pained up jeel everything in the calendar that that the rest of the world does Christian Church is associating in those things today till you can't hardil one from the other time we took eventually it is getting light praise the name of the Lord this is the time that we should take eventually because this kind of a thing where we can associate ourselves with the world until you can't differentiate from by the way they talk you seeing that Jes wearing like the rest of them having our things conducted the same way the world does be our Norm here because we are A peculiar people from a different Nation the name of the the prophet says you know he was he was speaking in that specific place I think it was identified by character you see we are ug like the rest of the people out we are born from heaven we are born from above our citizenship in heaven for our nature our character our we live be different people of the world that shouldn't be our value ass with the and the prophet it was too late till she had a CLE till she had a c she had toate a c and she got a CLE not only did she get a CLE but she got a broom and she went to house cleaning you see that what was she cleaning which did she lead which C theel candle praise the name of the Lord and he continues oh brother if there ever was a need of time of liting of lighting of the cand the sending forth of the Gospel Light the Holy Ghost back into the church not so much for emotions not so much for you know not for some Fanatics not for some emotion work not for a jump for joy but for a heart searching you see a heart searching experience when men and women get right with God see the proph say it's not about the excitement it's not about you know the emotion that's not what she did wasting the gospel handle examining yourself right in the word not using another a standard coming to Christ himself as the standard and say what have I to do to get better back in the land the Propet said she had to late goel to search for to search for that tablet it says in paragraph 6 I see time is running here he said she lead a CLE to give her light before every before every every every little candle he says rather and brother every little candle in here ought to be lit tonight not only that but she got the broom and the neighbors could see the dust flying real her husband was about to come and if he called her with that one Co out she was a brother with the Church of the Living God great hours that we are leaving it behoves us to check up go before God let the CLE of the word of the and examine ourselves and find out if we are not falling short and especially when we see all these things coming we are at the end time the coming of Christ is at hand there is not another hope in the world for the church the husband is about to come and in the scripture Jesus said blessed is that when come what staying in service prise the name of the Lord bearing the fruit of the spirit seeing that if I lose this tablet here I search for it until I restor back when I lose this tablet of Joy here for it until I get event all the time examine yourself all the time praise the name of the Lord to be certain that the building block of present right in your soul you see because it is easy to walk out a m and you leave Brotherly Love somewhere to walk a long distance and yet you have L that's the same characteristic that was in the Ephesian Church age they had lost something Jesus came and rebuked them go back to where you where you were you must find that first in and that's what I'm meaning this when I talk about examining ourselves we may get back that sacred value that is missing right within us so the character and the value of every believer that silver you know tablet that the prophet has refered to as the fruit of the spirit praise the name of the Lord so he says in the message an absolute he say man is not measured by how much his biceps are how much his biceps are praise the name of the Lord how big a muscle he is is measured by his character that's exactly right and character comes from the word of God that alone and the real sent of God looks for the character of the Vindicated word the name of the Lord and we are invited to shape our character to his character by obedience to the Holy Ghost because it is only the holy ghost that can bring about that character in our lives praise the name of the Lord the prophet sayia in identification of 63 if we are ready to lay our character down talking about losing who we are we allow God himself come and do his work if we are ready to lay our character down say his head now he's talking about the character that we should lay down he says High minded L was of pleasure More Than Love accusers continent dispers of those that are trying to do right the form of godliness the power of the word he says how can how can God come into a place like that word you see when he watches over his word to vindicate it to make it to pass and the word is push out how can he identify himself we go to take the entire Full Gospel we must and now being that we have identified oursel as Full Gospel let us mold our character we are invited to be molded In His Image praise the name of the Lord that we might reflect his presence and the works that I shall you do also the life that I live shall you we are invited by go to take him as an example let our character be molded like his then when we let his character be in us then we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character your mind makes you know your mind makes your character the mind like Paul say of Christ this mind that was in Christ being that mind of Christ be in yous the character of a Son of God praise the name of the Lord and any person that has been baptized into Christ and is bearing the fruit of bearing the character of the spirit that man will always desire to be under the preaching of the word the hearing of the word go to listen of the word of God because is the word that brings about the TR you must know the word of God the word the name of the Lord he says here in the message he him he says it pleases God to find his children obedient to his work not only ISS not on little ISS but obedient to the word not obedient to the church obedient to the word that is the thing that is going to start this is the blueprint this is the standard this is the only thing whatever shall take away to the same will be taken part from The Book of Life I don't want anything less than this put in here I don't want anything more I want just what it says it says in paragraph 27 notice then when he come and the father was pleased with his son you know that's what we saw about you know when the when the father was pleased with his son after the son you know reflecting the rec of the father inheritor of all that the father had that's what God wants us be all the character it is not hard all that we do submit to the spirit obey the spirit surrender to the spirit you see that's all that we need but the problem is compromising you know time is passed I just want to get down just to get you some quotes here he the message the comfor the message the comfor God can never get a people under his own control he say say God can ever get a people under his own control if he will get a man or a woman that W compromise on his word that's the person that will put under his control and then he continues and says but we stand there like the Rock of Ages will believe every word of it believe that he is behind it and the man who believes it you must act like it you see if you don't act like it then you don't believe it but if you believe it act like it you see he and you can put it to work and the word we be in you then it says in paragraph 78 we lost our heritage because that we just compromis that's how we lose it and that's how all through the church ages that's how they lost it by compromising you see because of their own benefits you see constan he want to rule everyone he says let us join the church and the state such that I can rule all of them praise the name of the Lord and that's what is being done today because of the self gain you say no I can't just compromise here let just add zero not be compromising I'm going to a function no one is going to see me I can dress like this compromising you see my friends would will looking bad some small be seen compromising friends the prophet say we lost our heritage because that we just compromised and that's why every other day we find that a specific value or trait is missing why compromising look at the look at the church ages Ephesian church because of compromis they left you know somewhere comes rebuke them lost your your first love they left a certain portion of the word are we together friends he continues and say and when we compromise then we cannot expect God his promise to us see do you want God to keep his promise to you compromise anywhere he says because we have broke in upon the sacred trust and the trust that God gave us that trust what happens look at the children of Israel every time they rejected and went to asra God also held his hands said when you seek for me you remember me and serve me and worship me and believe me I'll come and fight for you praise the name of the Lord and it is testified through the scripture every man that stood on the word of God went to God for help came on the the name of the Lord for example when the king of assria told him I'm coming to take what did he he stood before the Lord and He took even the letters before from the hising your people for us what happened the Spirit came down and he going to die he never tookah to do anything look atah when the spirit Came Upon said is going to die T is going to die is going to die what didah do it is because of his obedience to the word because of he's not compromising the word stood in for him he said don't go served you with a perfect heart not compromised Everywhere You see I've done all that is right before you that's where we need to stand friend are you sick anything he say if we can be he to his promise let's stand on the perfect word of God without compromising because we have come we have broke in upon the sa trust and you fa the trust that God gave us he says let us keep that trust keep it sacred keep you should stand like job and say even if I lose everything I will not lose my sa trust in the Lord praise the name of the Lord he says keep it holy keep every every word of it and compromise Noh take God at his word act like it stand on it don't move that's what we must do that's what God is looking for praise the name of the Lord friends that's the person that will stand that will stand as a of Living Water that will stand as a Fountain of Living Water praise the name of the Lord he say he continues as I say this morning in the message in our message in this morning speaking of it beh us becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness up to us to whom the word been deliver up to us that we stay with that word to stand and say why am I told that I should not wear trousers get the other people from the other church are wearing them you shouldn't stand and say why am I told that I should not do this let my friends from the other Church they doing it the prophet say to us it has been delivered are we together the message the revelation of this hour has been delivered to us so we shouldn't stand compare ourselves them that are still in darkness yes sir he here and as we stay with it as we stay with it we see God working Among Us coming to us stay with it it is a Heritage that God has given us anything that we are to represent anything that we are to reflect it comes from the word so once you reject the word then you can't bring up forth anything you see the prophet told us that the dyamics comes on the mechanics the mechan praise the name let's turn to the Book of Revelation as I try to finish here in the few minutes Revelations chapter 21 so I hope you have seen the values but what is the value you know we have been talking about the sacred values amen praise the name of the Lord he say in the Book of Revelation 21 and then verse he says and he said unto me it is done I am alha and omaa the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely praise the name of the Lord he's calling all them that are thir it is not he's not calling those who know they are righteous he's not calling those who know they are full he said he that is a thirst praise the name of the Lord are you thirsty this evening he says he that is a thirst not like the FES no sir that are thir let's join it together with John verse 13 he say Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drink of this water shall thirst a shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be him well of water up into everlasting life so he says he's giving out the water and this water when it comes in you it becomes a well also and you also begin to distrib so when you become aware you don't only provide for yourself you see the well flows living water and it is Flowing where it is passing there are people drinking of this living water praise the name of the Lord so I believe this evening talking about being born or baptized in Christ we have partaken of this well we have partaken of this living water you come as a thirsty man and with the Living Water like this woman here that responded and said give me the water give me the and I drink so this evening the sacred value that I want to talk about winning Souls winning Souls we are going to see what the prophet says about that but as we go into the prophecy Christ is saying I give you the Living Water freely so whenever you feel thirsted just pray unto him oh Father add me more father give me more and is giving you that water becomes a well inside of begins to flow it is Flowing is not flowing hatred it is not flowing you know issues of the world flowing the values flowing the fruit of the spirit is Flowing the same that water he has not said that when I give you this water the water that will flow out of you be of a different nature the same water that Christ giv is that water you give out praise the name of the Lord he says in verse 15 the man says unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come to drw so we see that the scriptures never F person any person that takes of this water by all means must become aware you see because Jesus Christ cannot lie I hope we are together he says You must be a well springing everlas and in verse 37 in the last day in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood cried say If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on as the scripture has said out of his belly shall rivers of Living Water any person that believeth on Christ any person that comes and drink out of him there is a river flowing and theal supp to the nearby people are you supplying to the near people are you supplying to your neighbors are you supplying to your colleagues at work are you supplying to your colleagues at school are you a river are you a well the word has been broken which cannot be so the prophet says here I asked my wife not long ago I said I want to ask you something what is real true value placed on nothing but L soul is the only thing that got value in it praise the name of the Lord Brother my sister after receiving Christ something that is of Great Value I hope my brother can get this here you canp nothing but l so the prophet tells us after receiving Christ we bear the sacred values that he has referred to as theet and every morning we to examine ourselves to be sure that none is L praise the name of the Lord because that is the trait that is the character that God wants to see in you daily praise the name of the Lord now he's telling us that after receiving Christ you bear the sacred values something that is more valuable you know than you buying land than you you know whatever you do in life whatsoever you do in life he says there is nothing that is so valuable that lost his SCE that's what we should go for because that's what we should do we are rivers of Living Water dist you see yes got let's continue nothing but is the only thing that is got value in it money passes away homes DEC and everything in the Earth the only value lasting value rather have one so in glory that I want to Christ to know and see that the light of God around that Soul through all eternity to be associated with that to have every pen of the money because I have to lose it friend that's the value that's the value as the as the living water is Flowing it should be able to out to a brother not not like the Levites that passed that man that that had fallen the Jero you see you have your brother you have your friends you have your colleages at neighbors but look at what they testify about you praise the name of the Lord yet you are put there by God for purpose you see the prophet says my brother sister tonight without hope without God that's why I am here to speak to you to try to get you to love the Lord Jesus I want to some of his blessed word and then he says he continues another message he says one so saved when that star is a shining y our name will be wrapped into is your value have you got any value there that should be our anchor know that there is a glory my name ised because anything that we do down here we are certainly going to leave but that so there you're going to go with it that's a testimony that will be seen there as the scripture say that they will be shining as the brightness the STS they that they W he says here there is your value it isn't how much you got how much you desire it is how much you can do toward saving sses our money will Fed I'm certain I'm certain that every one of us every morning we look out for to you see that but how discouraging it is know that when we cross over that we are going to leave here me right I'm not saying that don't work Paul says and the scripture says he that he without sewing you will not e he that doesn't work shall not eat so we must work for us to eat but if we are working this body that is going to Decay how much should we work our names will be rupted glory he continues and says now the prophet here down he gives an example of his car and he say in paragraph 33 I polished that little old F he was he was he was he was talking about his old his F his I that old brother anyway you just continue where we were says I polished that little old f i Pol this morning setting up there in the gar and then he says brother he says I polish that old and then he says and this morning setting up there in the gar is aadl that they have given me he was talking about two he polished the old f he was talking about the cadl he had been given and then he says and setting up there in the G is a that they gave me but one of these days that will be like the is it will be no more but God will still be the same if I get a soul saved for Christ brother as long as there is an eternity the glory of God will rest on that s so what's value any what good does it do when the struggles is in your throat and the doctor sees the P coming up your s what good is all the money all the popular people to you on the back and become a great person what good does that do to you not a bit it vanishes and stays on Earth but one Soul saved you will see your name wrapped into it as long as the Morning Star shall glitter in the each one new Housewives you don't have to be a preacher you do something for the glory of God remember Eternal things is what lasts forever get let that be the first thing all your work and all your AAS and all your motives praise the name of the Lord I just want to end with one quote here I pray you forgive me for for keeping you this long he says in the message investment the Bible say thou Rich Thou Art Rich Thou Art rich and increased in Goods to this stage to this age he was talking to this age but don't know that you are naked miserable poor wretched blind and don't know it what a miserable condition he talking about the people that stand in the feet of the Pharisees and they say we Are Holy we are righteous we don't need Phan you see they say we are rich the scripture is saying you say that you are rich you increased with Goods but you don't know you are naked you are miserable poored and he says what a miserable condition and you know the prophet says the reason it was such a miserable because they didn't know their condition but happy are you know that the nature the you know the nature of the age today standing there but yet we who have realized that we need the weight rment that we need the iel we are here to receive SE from the how happy are you the prophet continues and says men and Brethren don't make an investment in something like that is bound to perish you see he continues and say why not make an invest an investment in something that is proved Through the Bible and you know with the text that I got written here here tonight still this text proving Through the Bible those who made that and who turned it down and then he say here I am showing you a real investment and I want to say this I'm showing you a real value that will look at you and say my son is wor praise the name of the Lord he says I am showing you a real investment to make put your life you are your money your talent put everything you've got in Christ God guaranted it to us by raising him up again we will raising the last today promised what more could you look forward to he's asking you tell me any investment you make that would pay off like that show me one you see not any all the Investments that we make down we are to leave them here it's not bad to have them brother it's not bad to have them brother we must have them and I want to tell you you must work to but yet there is a more excellent investment that's what the prophet is showing then he says tell me what you invest in this morning and make $10 million and tomor be a what what good would it do you you see that's the same thing that happened to the Rich Young lul after reting eternal life he went and made businesses and indeed he he was a big businessman but after the biggest Harvest ever had in his life that same night he was aose and the prophet says what would it profit you friends we've got to take inventory we' got to examine our where are we putting most of our investment in the Kingdom or in this one here you see we must know where True Value is say one night he asked his wife where is True Value he preached the word he stood in Services he had had all that he wanted all that he ever wanted lay hand on it but yet was asking where is true friends it would be bad if we hear this word here and then we fa to recognize the the prophet as I try to wind up what good will it be what Pro a man the whole world his value but if you popular and so and so so and soor Doctor Bishop Elder pop or whatever you might be those are prizes of men brother be called a Holy by the people and be a Son of God in my heart with the new birth the spirit of Christ dwelling in me and him proving it by the Vindication of his wife and making me live the life that I once lived I you know he says and make me live the life that I once lived I don't live no more and yet he was a teacher scholar but he changed his life when he met Christ and made his inv in he was a different man from then on brother sister my prayer is from this on from then on we should be different men know where toay our
