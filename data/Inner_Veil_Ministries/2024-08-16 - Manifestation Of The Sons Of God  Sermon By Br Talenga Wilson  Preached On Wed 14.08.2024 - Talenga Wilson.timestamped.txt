[0:02] Verse
[0:03] 18 8 verse 18
[0:10] says for I reckon that the sufferings of
[0:13] this present time are not worthy to be
[0:16] compared with the glory which shall be
[0:18] revealed in US
[0:36] for the Hest expectation of the creature
[0:38] wait for the manifestation of the sons
[0:41] of
[0:51] God for theature was made subject to
[0:55] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[0:58] him who has subjected the
[1:14] because the creature itself also shall
[1:17] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:19] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:21] the children of God
[1:40] for we know that the whole creation grth
[1:43] and travaileth in the pain
[1:53] together and not only they but ourselves
[1:57] also which have the first fruits of the
[2:00] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[2:04] ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi
[2:08] the Redemption of our
[2:25] body amen amen may the Lord bless his
[2:28] word
[2:31] we may be
[2:32] seated
[2:34] amen the
[2:37] manifestation of the sons of
[2:39] God
[2:41] manifestation of the children of
[2:44] God amen amen do you love him amen the
[2:49] scripture
[2:50] says that the suffering of this
[2:54] present and not worth to be
[2:57] compared with the glory which which
[3:00] shall be revealed in
[3:03] us so the scripture gives us
[3:06] hope that
[3:08] someday there is a glory that hides on
[3:11] the inside of
[3:13] us that shall be
[3:16] revealed there is a glory on the inside
[3:18] of
[3:19] us that shall be brought to
[3:22] manifestation praise the Lord for the
[3:25] honest expectation of the
[3:28] creature wait for the manifestation of
[3:31] the sons of
[3:33] God so now throughout all through all
[3:37] the
[3:38] tribulation and the sufferings of this
[3:41] present
[3:42] time the Bible says when the children of
[3:45] God are to be
[3:48] manifested at the time of manifestation
[3:51] of the sons of
[3:53] God the glory that shall be made
[3:56] manifest the glory that shall come out
[3:59] of us
[4:01] to be manifest the rest of the
[4:03] world the Bible says the sufferings are
[4:07] not even an inch of that
[4:10] Glory praise the Lord for the title
[4:14] tonight taking a trip on the
[4:16] manifestation of the sons of
[4:21] God the manifestation of children of God
[4:23] in the end
[4:25] times praise the Lord so what is to
[4:28] manifest
[4:30] to manifest means to
[4:32] display it means to
[4:35] reveal or to make something
[4:39] evident to make something
[4:42] clear to make something
[4:45] visible it involves bring something that
[4:48] may have been
[4:55] hidden something that has been internal
[5:00] or not yet fully
[5:03] realized into a
[5:05] state where it is clearly
[5:09] perceived reced or
[5:14] understood praise the Lord remember the
[5:16] scripture said that the enti
[5:20] nature is
[5:22] gring waiting for the
[5:25] manifestation of the children of God
[5:29] praise the Lord and the first scripture
[5:31] told us that there is a
[5:34] glory a glory on the
[5:37] inside that shall be made
[5:40] manifest in the end of
[5:43] times so now to
[5:45] manifest That Glory that sits on theide
[5:49] of us means that that
[5:52] Glory all that life all that nature at
[5:57] some point in time
[6:00] shall have to be seen
[6:03] plainly shall have to be made
[6:06] visible the rest of the people
[6:10] see praise the Lord for example in the
[6:14] context of the Bible in the scripture
[6:18] where we read the manifestation of the
[6:21] sons of
[6:22] God would refer to the Future
[6:26] event God is children
[6:30] will be clearly
[6:32] revealed recognized in their glorified
[6:38] State showing who they truly are in
[6:43] Christ and this
[6:46] manifestation will make
[6:48] evident the full
[6:52] transformation and Redemption that God
[6:55] has accomplished in
[6:57] them we shall know who we
[7:00] are for we shall see who he who
[7:04] is and when we look at him shall be able
[7:08] to see him that he shall be like who we
[7:12] are why because when you go back to the
[7:14] Book of
[7:16] Genesis God was creating
[7:19] man God created man in his own image in
[7:24] the likeness of God created he him
[7:29] Lord so God created man in his own
[7:33] image the glory of God in the likeness
[7:37] of God and along the
[7:40] way when man
[7:42] sin he lost the glory of
[7:45] God he lost the likeness of
[7:49] God he lost the life of
[7:51] God praise the Lord but now we know that
[7:55] when Jesus
[7:56] comes he comes to to
[8:00] that which man
[8:02] lost he
[8:04] comes that Glory which man lost in Adam
[8:10] praise the Lord And now when he comes he
[8:14] comes to pay the
[8:16] price on Calvary and he dies praise the
[8:20] Lord and his death and his suffering was
[8:25] the
[8:26] restoration of the glory that we had
[8:28] lost in Adam
[8:30] praise the Lord And now when he's taken
[8:32] up to
[8:34] Glory the Bible says he was against sin
[8:36] of the
[8:39] Angels coming down praise the Lord so
[8:43] now the same God who gave up
[8:47] himself upon the day of
[8:50] Calvary is the same that left the
[8:53] throne sin of the
[8:56] angels and now he came down on the day
[8:58] of Pentecost
[9:00] to live among his
[9:02] people praise the Lord that's why the
[9:05] Bible says for God so love the world
[9:09] that he gave up his only begotten son
[9:12] that whoever believeth on him praise the
[9:16] Lord shall not die but shall have
[9:19] everlasting life so now the life of God
[9:24] the life of Jesus Christ which was given
[9:27] unto us on on the of P
[9:31] to live in US gives us that everlasting
[9:36] life now the Bible has said that there
[9:39] is coming a time of the full
[9:43] manifestation That Glory that lives on
[9:47] the inside of us and now the Bible says
[9:50] that the sufferings that we go
[9:53] through canot be
[9:56] compared That Glory that shall be made
[10:01] manifest in our lives praise the Lord
[10:04] now the manifestation of the children of
[10:07] God is the period in
[10:09] time when the Pure Life Of
[10:12] God that sits at the theme of his
[10:19] Tabernacle praise the Lord that sits on
[10:22] the inside of his
[10:26] Tabernacle in the innermost part of it
[10:30] like we saw last week the three
[10:33] courts that make up the Tabernacle of
[10:36] God Bible tells us that you that I that
[10:42] we are the Tabernacle of
[10:44] God praise the Lord so now we know that
[10:47] the fullness of
[10:49] God dwells within the Tabernacle of
[10:53] God and now the manifestation of the
[10:56] sons of
[10:57] God will come at a
[11:00] time when that God that sits at the
[11:05] theme of his
[11:07] Tabernacle praise the Lord shall make
[11:10] his way out to be known to the rest of
[11:14] the
[11:15] world that's when the whole world will
[11:17] see and the Bible says when they shall
[11:20] see when they shall see us they will be
[11:24] able to see
[11:25] God why he has walked worked his way out
[11:30] to make a
[11:32] manifestation so the high priest of our
[11:36] confession moving from the innermost
[11:40] Court declaring
[11:43] salvation declaring
[11:45] salvation declaring
[11:48] victory that you look at the present
[11:51] time you look at the pain and the
[11:54] sufferings that you're going through
[11:57] they were all finished at Calvary
[12:00] praise the Lord is God on the inside of
[12:03] us trying to make his way out as he
[12:07] makes his way out he makes a
[12:11] declaration that whatever we are going
[12:13] through at the present of
[12:16] time it was all FAL
[12:19] Calvary cannot be
[12:22] compared to the glory that shall
[12:25] come praise the Lord so now that
[12:27] manifestation
[12:29] is in other
[12:31] words a
[12:34] reflection a
[12:36] manifestation of the true nature of
[12:40] God through his children it is God
[12:45] himself
[12:47] manifesting his
[12:49] nature his character through his
[12:52] children such that when the people look
[12:55] at
[12:55] us they are not seeing us they are able
[12:59] to see the likeness of God in
[13:03] us they able to see the image of God in
[13:06] us they able to see the life of God in
[13:09] us a pure
[13:12] reflection and
[13:14] manifestation of the life of God in
[13:17] us praise the Lord God bringing the
[13:23] seat that was once planted in
[13:27] Us in two mon
[13:30] praise the Lord so that brings God into
[13:34] manifestation when we begin to portray
[13:36] the nature of
[13:39] God it brings God into
[13:42] manifestation it brings the image and
[13:44] likeness of God into
[13:48] manifestation it makes us like
[13:51] him and that's what makes us the word
[13:54] put on
[13:57] flesh he lives within us and he makes
[14:01] his way out to manifest the world that
[14:04] he lives in
[14:06] us the Bible says he's not in
[14:09] heaven he left the heavens and now he
[14:13] created a
[14:15] tabernacle Tabernacle that is
[14:19] likened the Tabernacle that Solomon
[14:22] built
[14:24] him praise the lord we saw that there
[14:27] are three courts
[14:30] we have the outermost
[14:32] Court which is the body which must be
[14:37] purified and brought into subjection of
[14:40] the word of
[14:42] God by the preaching of the word praise
[14:45] the Lord it gets into
[14:48] subjection praise the Lord on the day of
[14:51] Pentecost there were certain of them
[14:54] there were certain of
[14:57] them that still lost in the
[15:00] world and when he had come and he was
[15:04] ready to make
[15:06] himself and
[15:08] ab in this Tabernacle there those that
[15:12] had not yet come come into countenance
[15:14] of that
[15:16] Glory so when Peter stood out and he
[15:19] began to preach and he began to
[15:23] rebuke prise the Lord their bodies the
[15:26] outermost Court
[15:29] into
[15:30] sub and the Bible says they were praked
[15:33] in their
[15:34] hearts and they were
[15:37] sighing and they said unto Peter and the
[15:41] rest of the
[15:42] disciples men and
[15:45] Breen what shall we do to receive of
[15:49] this
[15:50] Glory what does that mean outmost part
[15:53] of the
[15:54] Court had come into subjection of the
[15:59] praise the Lord it had come into
[16:01] obedience and it was yearning to open up
[16:04] the
[16:06] door the outer court for the high priest
[16:09] to
[16:10] enter praise the Lord and the B says
[16:13] when they open their doors as the high
[16:16] priest entered he began now to do the
[16:19] work he began do the
[16:22] process of
[16:24] cleansing of
[16:26] sanctifying Praise the Lord he got to
[16:29] their hearts he go to their spirits and
[16:32] he began to
[16:34] wash praise the Lord the more they kept
[16:37] themselves in the presence of
[16:39] God in the preaching of the word the
[16:42] Bible says it is the Waters of the
[16:46] words that was us the preaching of the
[16:49] word of God cleanses us it washes us and
[16:54] it makes us clean and before him praise
[16:59] the Lord that is God Jesus Christ our
[17:04] high priest now in the middle
[17:07] court cleansing Us by the preaching of
[17:10] the Waters of the word praise the Lord
[17:14] And now when he's
[17:15] done and the spirit has come into
[17:19] subjection of the word of
[17:21] God
[17:23] proceeded to the innermost
[17:26] Court we saw last week the holy of
[17:30] holies the theme of The Tabernacle of
[17:34] God the dwelling place of the Tabernacle
[17:38] of
[17:39] God where he
[17:41] lives praise the Lord and when he gets
[17:44] in
[17:46] there that is going to be our starting
[17:49] point
[17:50] tonight that when he gets in
[17:53] there praise the Lord he is like a
[17:57] seed that has been planted in the
[18:00] ground when the seed is planted in the
[18:04] ground the farmer his interest is not to
[18:09] get his
[18:10] seed bur it in the ground and leave it
[18:13] there the farmer has the
[18:17] expectation he has the hope that someday
[18:22] the SE which she has burried in the
[18:24] ground shall bring forth fruits of the
[18:29] same kind praise the Lord so now when
[18:32] the high
[18:33] priest Jesus Christ the word of God gets
[18:38] in our
[18:40] souls the process of transformation
[18:45] begins the process of confirmation
[18:50] begins he now begins
[18:53] confir he conforms us to his
[18:56] word he conforms us to
[19:00] obedience to his word and then the
[19:04] process of
[19:06] manifestation of manifestation of the
[19:09] seed of manifestation of the life that
[19:13] is in the seed begins from
[19:16] there so now we notice that there is no
[19:20] way we can show the
[19:23] manifestation of the life of God unless
[19:27] un unless the life of
[19:29] God has found its
[19:32] way from the outermost
[19:35] Court our
[19:37] spirit then to the soul until we have
[19:40] the word in our
[19:42] souls we can never
[19:44] manifest the life and likeness of
[19:48] God praise the Lord that's why the Bible
[19:51] says
[19:52] behold I stand at the door and
[19:56] knock I stand at the door are
[19:59] knock praise the Lord he knocks because
[20:04] he wants us to
[20:06] respond he knows that he has brought
[20:09] salvation he wants to save us praise the
[20:13] Lord his desire us to save
[20:15] us but he knows that first of all we
[20:20] must bring our bodies unto
[20:23] subjection so he stands at the door
[20:26] knock by way of the
[20:29] at the day of Pentecost he was knocking
[20:32] those
[20:33] men they were calling Peter and the rest
[20:37] of the
[20:38] Apostles they called them
[20:40] drunkers praise the Lord but when the
[20:43] word was
[20:44] preached it condemn their
[20:47] hearts condemn their lives so they had
[20:50] to
[20:52] surrender by opening up their
[20:55] doors for the high priest to enter
[20:58] let's open our doors for the high priest
[21:01] to enter so that he can move through the
[21:05] the outer
[21:06] door to the middle court to the holy of
[21:11] holies to begin the work of
[21:15] confirmation to confir us to transform
[21:19] us to change us work upon us to get us
[21:25] into subjection of the word of God
[21:28] he says to the world they will not be
[21:31] able to see me but you that has opened
[21:35] the
[21:36] door praise the Lord he says you that
[21:39] have
[21:40] believed you shall be able to see
[21:43] me the world will see me no more but you
[21:48] shall be able to see
[21:50] me John 14
[21:53] ver yet a little
[21:56] while the world sees me no more
[22:00] but
[22:01] yet see me because I
[22:05] live you shall live
[22:07] also praise the Lord let God help us to
[22:12] know that he lives in
[22:14] US recognize that he is alive in our
[22:18] lives that he's alive at every moment of
[22:21] Our
[22:22] Lives to help us believe that the
[22:26] sufferings of the present time
[22:29] cannot be
[22:31] compared to the victory that awaits
[22:34] us to the world we are not able to see
[22:38] him but to us we able to see him because
[22:42] he lives in us and because he lives in
[22:46] us he says you shall live
[22:49] also and that and that day you shall
[22:53] know the day of the
[22:56] manifestation of the sons of God
[22:59] you shall know that I am in my
[23:02] father and you in
[23:04] me and I in
[23:07] you why because when we shall see him we
[23:11] shall see him because he shall be like
[23:14] us we have created in his own
[23:17] image in his likeness so you shall see
[23:21] him we shall see that he is like
[23:24] Us Praise the Lord that's why he says
[23:28] you shall know that I am in my
[23:32] father and you in me and I in you he
[23:37] that loveth my
[23:39] Commandments he that has my
[23:42] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[23:46] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[23:50] shall be loved of my father I will love
[23:54] him and I will manifest myself to him
[23:59] I will manifest myself to
[24:02] him at every moment of life I will
[24:05] manifest myself to
[24:07] him in moments of happiness I will
[24:11] manifest myself to him in moments of
[24:15] trouble I will manifest myself to him
[24:18] praise the Lord in moments of
[24:21] abundance I I will manifest myself to
[24:24] him in moments of
[24:26] lack I will manifest myself to him in
[24:30] moments of life I will manifest myself
[24:33] to him and in moments of
[24:37] sickness I will still manifest myself to
[24:39] him as a
[24:41] Healer he that lovees
[24:43] me I will also love him praise the Lord
[24:48] God making himself
[24:51] manifested before his sons and in so
[24:55] doing manifesting the sons of God
[24:59] in the end times now this
[25:02] manifestation can be likened
[25:05] seed that is planted into the
[25:08] ground it must
[25:11] meet conditions and go through a process
[25:15] of
[25:16] time to be able to crop up into
[25:20] matur and bear fruits to man to manifest
[25:23] the life that the seed once had
[25:30] praise the Lord God planted his life in
[25:35] us and in the end
[25:38] time that life must
[25:42] manifest at the harest
[25:45] time at the time of the end
[25:48] time at the time of the
[25:50] Rapture the same life that he planted in
[25:53] our
[25:55] souls must be the same life that shall
[25:57] manifest with
[26:00] that is a
[26:02] manifestation of the sons of God so we
[26:05] can liken this
[26:07] manifestation the SE that is
[26:10] planted and Jesus spoke a parable in the
[26:13] book of
[26:15] MTH from
[26:18] verse and he
[26:20] spoke many things unto them in
[26:24] saying behold went forth to
[26:28] and when he s some seeds fell by the way
[26:32] side and the fs came and div them
[26:37] up and some fell upon stoy
[26:43] places where they had not much
[26:48] Earth and for with they sprang
[26:52] up because they had no deepness of the
[26:57] Earth and when the sun was
[27:00] up they were
[27:04] scorched and because they had no
[27:07] root they withed away remember we are
[27:12] likened the life that we have praise the
[27:16] Lord the Salvation that we have is
[27:19] likened this
[27:21] city the Bible said some fell on Stone
[27:26] places that was not a good ground
[27:29] so when they attempted to
[27:32] grow they
[27:34] withered because of the
[27:36] sun their Roots were not
[27:39] deep but the Bible
[27:42] sayto them that love
[27:44] him the
[27:46] Sons The
[27:48] Suffering the scoring of the
[27:51] son the drought and and all the
[27:55] distress cannot be compared
[27:58] to the glory to the life that shall be
[28:02] made
[28:03] manifest praise the Lord so that
[28:06] means the sons regardless of the scoring
[28:10] of the
[28:12] son as long as we are planted on the
[28:14] good
[28:16] ground Our Roots are
[28:19] deep prise the Lord and if the roots are
[28:23] deep we shall be able to stand the test
[28:26] of time
[28:29] and it shall come until that
[28:31] day of the manifestation of the son
[28:34] of and some fell among
[28:40] thorns and THS
[28:43] up and chocked
[28:46] them but other fell into good
[28:50] ground and brought fourth
[28:54] fruit some fell into good ground
[29:00] and the says and those that fell into
[29:01] good
[29:03] ground they brought forth
[29:05] fruit some
[29:13] 100
[29:16] verse par of
[29:22] the when anyone Hearth the word of the
[29:25] Kingdom
[29:28] and understand understand it
[29:31] not then cometh the wicked
[29:34] one and catches away that which was sown
[29:39] in his
[29:41] heart this is he which received seed by
[29:44] the way
[29:47] site both he that received the seed in
[29:51] two Stone
[29:54] places the same is he that Hearth the
[29:57] word and and known with joy receives
[30:08] it yet he not root in
[30:12] himself but for a
[30:16] while for when tribulation or
[30:18] persecution arises because of the word
[30:21] and
[30:29] remember that's the
[30:31] reason why when God was creating
[30:35] man praise the Lord when God was
[30:37] creating this
[30:39] Tabernacle he had to have a sacred
[30:45] place he had to have a
[30:51] place to hide his word in
[30:54] there praise the Lord because when the
[30:56] body goes into suffering
[30:59] the body can EAS reject the
[31:02] words because of the persecution and
[31:05] distress and the pain that we go through
[31:09] the sickness and troubles and
[31:12] Sorrows sometimes we come short of the
[31:15] of
[31:16] strength and we become weak but because
[31:20] there is a life in our
[31:22] soul that life for TRS from the inside
[31:25] out
[31:28] give us hope that there is life beyond
[31:32] the
[31:33] suffering that there is life beyond
[31:37] sickness the life that God puts on the
[31:40] inside of
[31:41] us is that seed of
[31:44] life praise the Lord so now even if
[31:47] there is
[31:49] persecution even if there is
[31:52] distress we are not
[31:54] offended we cannot hate God we cannot
[31:58] reject his
[31:59] words why because that life on
[32:04] theight is God
[32:06] himself praise the Lord so he cannot
[32:09] reject
[32:11] himself praise the Lord he has made in
[32:15] us that's why he says he is in
[32:18] us and we are in him and when we are in
[32:22] him he brings this
[32:26] body subjection
[32:28] of his word praise the Lord he says that
[32:33] one that that is growing up in the th
[32:37] ground when Trouble
[32:40] Comes and he gets
[32:44] offended praise the Lord when the word
[32:46] is being preached at that point of uh of
[32:51] uh the cleansing
[32:54] process of sanctification
[32:58] he may not be able to Bear the
[33:00] words praise the Lord because now it's
[33:03] no
[33:04] longer concerning the
[33:07] body there are no
[33:09] promises your flesh praise the Lord you
[33:13] have gotten the
[33:15] sickness you've got sickness you've been
[33:18] prayed for you have prayed but you're
[33:22] not
[33:23] recovering praise the Lord if you don't
[33:26] have the words
[33:28] rooted in your soul you can easily
[33:31] reject
[33:33] God and take the
[33:36] alternative but if a man has the word of
[33:39] God if a man has that
[33:42] hope that glorious hope of his
[33:46] resurrection regardless of the suffering
[33:48] of the
[33:50] body he has hope and he can never reject
[33:54] the word of God
[33:58] is brought under subjection of the
[34:00] word because the word has found AB in
[34:03] his
[34:05] heart he that receiveth seed among among
[34:08] that receiveth seed into the good
[34:13] ground is he that Hearth the
[34:16] word understands it which also be
[34:20] beareth
[34:23] fruit and bring forth some 100f
[34:29] Psalm
[34:32] 6sm and we are that
[34:36] seed you are that
[34:39] seat I am that seat praise the Lord and
[34:43] the word of God is the good ground we
[34:47] are planted into the word of
[34:49] God the good ground praise the Lord
[34:53] which is the word of
[34:54] life the life of Jesus Christ himself
[34:59] and the Bible says in John 1
[35:02] verse4 the word was made
[35:05] flesh and dwelt
[35:08] among and we beheld his
[35:11] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[35:14] of the
[35:15] father full of grace and
[35:18] truth praise the Lord so the
[35:21] seed which is the
[35:23] Life coming from the farmer
[35:26] [Music]
[35:28] from the farmer which is God in this
[35:31] respect enters into our lives by
[35:35] faith the Lord Jesus Christ it goes
[35:38] through the three
[35:41] phases the three
[35:43] courts praise the Lord our body the
[35:47] spirit and into the soul where the seed
[35:52] of
[35:53] life
[35:54] lives so now this seed has to first of
[35:58] all get into this ground like I
[36:01] said then the process of germination
[36:06] starts and life from the
[36:10] ground that makes it live
[36:15] again has to break the she of the
[36:21] seed praise the Lord I want us to go
[36:23] slowly here
[36:25] now when the seed is planted
[36:28] it can never
[36:30] germinate unless the
[36:33] ground gives it life into the
[36:37] seed the seed requires
[36:42] moisture it requires
[36:45] water it requires oxygen and
[36:48] hydrogen and the rest of the
[36:52] minerals for it to Bear
[36:55] life so first of all
[36:58] it has to be
[37:00] broken it body has be
[37:04] broken praise the Lord the outer
[37:08] protection the outer part of the seed
[37:11] Jam has to be
[37:14] broken such that the
[37:17] ground gives it
[37:20] life praise the Lord so now when the
[37:22] outer part is
[37:24] broken and it Ro and dies
[37:29] then the ground the good ground gives it
[37:33] life into the seat so now the life moves
[37:38] through the outer
[37:40] Court it now gets into the
[37:45] seed into the of that
[37:48] seed and ites it it gives it life praise
[37:54] the Lord and when it gives it life then
[37:57] the seed begins to
[38:01] expand the process of germination
[38:05] begins from inside that
[38:08] se if you know the
[38:11] grain if you look at
[38:14] maze praise the Lord it has the outer
[38:18] layer which is always
[38:21] ating then the
[38:23] coting has that part the white part
[38:26] inside it
[38:29] then inside that part there is that
[38:33] jam which is the life of that
[38:37] grain the Lord so now when that M grain
[38:41] is
[38:42] put the ground the ground gives it
[38:46] water IT Supplies it water then the
[38:50] water breaks the outer
[38:52] sh when the outer shet is
[38:55] broken now the inner part also begins
[38:58] to it gets into
[39:01] subjection to the conditions of the
[39:04] ground if doesn't get into
[39:07] subjection the life will never get to
[39:09] the J of the
[39:11] seed and the seed will die but when it
[39:14] gets to
[39:16] subjection the life passes through that
[39:20] part and it reaches the
[39:22] J when it reaches the J the J begins to
[39:27] receive the
[39:28] strength it receives energy and it
[39:32] receives energy it begins now to Bear
[39:35] the life the life now
[39:38] begins praise the Lord that the same way
[39:41] God does to
[39:43] us the farmer goes out to plant his seed
[39:48] and now this seed that falls on good
[39:51] ground it comes out how does it come out
[39:56] because it has obey
[39:58] the conditions of the ground and the
[40:02] ground is the word of God the ground is
[40:06] God himself the ground is the life of
[40:10] Jesus Christ so when we are planted in
[40:12] his word we have receed the word of God
[40:16] we get into subjection to the word we
[40:19] obey the word so the word breaks us down
[40:24] it breaks our
[40:25] EOS it breaks makes our desires it makes
[40:29] this
[40:30] body come into
[40:33] subjection to the word of God then when
[40:36] the body gets into
[40:38] subjection now that life from the
[40:42] ground which is the Life of
[40:44] Christ gets now to the
[40:47] heart and the heart is that white
[40:51] layer is that white layer the the heart
[40:56] is that white layer
[40:58] praise the Lord of that
[41:01] grain praise the Lord so now when life
[41:04] from the ground ends on that
[41:07] layer and the Soul doesn't receive it
[41:12] the seed will still
[41:13] die praise the
[41:18] Lord it will
[41:20] die why the life has not reached the
[41:25] jam praise the Lord now remember it is a
[41:29] very big
[41:31] c it's a big
[41:33] cting so now the life begins to go
[41:37] in and it goes and goes and as it's
[41:41] going that part must also
[41:44] rot it must also break down and when it
[41:48] breaks down the life now moves onto
[41:53] the and when it gets the SE J
[41:57] catches the life and now it catches the
[42:00] life it must not remain
[42:03] there that life must once
[42:07] again must pass through the same
[42:11] process to leave the innermost Court of
[42:14] the
[42:15] seed and now it begins to come
[42:19] out praise the Lord and the farmer is
[42:23] shaking on his seat by day when he
[42:26] plants it today
[42:28] after a week he comes to check whether
[42:31] the seed has come out so now the seed
[42:35] for to
[42:37] manifest the life praise the Lord that
[42:40] was given to it that jam begins again to
[42:45] grow and it brings out the
[42:48] roots praise the Lord and The Roots now
[42:52] begin coming through from the seed
[42:55] J the she
[42:58] to the spirit and there the roots are
[43:01] growing
[43:02] deeper and now it comes out to that
[43:06] second
[43:07] Co and from the second Co it now breaks
[43:11] again
[43:12] out to the outer coat then the leaves
[43:16] begin to grow then the process of
[43:19] germination begins from
[43:21] there then when the fmer comes out he
[43:24] looks at it and become becomes happy
[43:28] because he has seen
[43:30] life the process has
[43:33] begun praise the Lord that is not the
[43:36] end of
[43:37] it the father praise the Lord is Happy
[43:43] until he has seen the fruits of the
[43:47] seity until he has seen the
[43:50] manifestation of the seed which he put
[43:52] to the
[43:53] ground but the Bible says the seed which
[43:57] falls on good
[43:58] ground is the same that grows up and it
[44:02] Springs up and springs up it brings
[44:07] forth
[44:08] fruits praise the Lord and now during
[44:12] that
[44:13] process it is the process that the Bible
[44:17] has said praise the Lord that the
[44:22] suffer of the
[44:24] present the farm is patient
[44:27] praise the Lord and the life in the seat
[44:31] is also patient because it has lost its
[44:34] shape to the roots to the
[44:38] stem praise the Lord and to the leaves
[44:42] but the life is still
[44:44] patient until it finds its way back to
[44:47] the SE
[44:49] again why because the same seed must
[44:54] come into manifestation
[44:58] we have been
[45:00] planted in the word of God praise the
[45:03] Lord and now God has given us his life
[45:08] which has gotten into our
[45:10] hearts down our souls and that life
[45:14] again comes out remember this time
[45:17] around it does not go through a painful
[45:23] process it is not so hard as before
[45:27] praise the Lord why because the seed has
[45:30] subjected
[45:32] itself the outer coat is rotten the midd
[45:36] ised so when the seed is when the life
[45:39] is coming from theide
[45:41] out it is very
[45:43] easy takes a shorter time why the man
[45:48] has subjected
[45:49] himself to the leadership of the Holy
[45:52] Spirit praise the Lord then the farmer
[45:55] comes out see the seed growing out and
[45:59] begins to grow he checks on it day at
[46:02] day he provides it with the good
[46:06] atmosphere when the sun is so
[46:09] hot he does not wait for the
[46:12] rains praise the Lord he brings water
[46:16] and begin watering it and begin it he's
[46:21] taking care of the seed he's taking care
[46:24] of the crop because he wants to see the
[46:26] the
[46:28] manifestation of the fruit in the
[46:30] Harvest Time and the farmer does not
[46:33] rest until he gets the seeds
[46:38] ready God has planted us and God shall
[46:42] provide praise the Lord the seat must go
[46:47] through the
[46:49] drought the drought must come it is a
[46:53] part of the
[46:54] process praise the Lord but when the
[46:56] drought
[46:57] comes there are some seeds the Bible
[47:01] says they
[47:03] withered praise the Lord their hearts
[47:05] became
[47:06] weak when trouble came along the
[47:10] way their hearts become
[47:13] weak and their strength goes
[47:16] down why they have not put their hope
[47:20] and their trust in the words they put
[47:24] they have not put their trust in life in
[47:27] the
[47:28] ground so they are not deeply
[47:31] rooted their roots are just on the
[47:35] surface a tree a CR that has have that
[47:41] has their
[47:42] Roots deeply rooted in the
[47:45] ground praise the Lord the droughts may
[47:49] come and it may SC
[47:51] them and during the day
[47:54] sometimes the leaves May wither
[47:58] but the life in the root never with us
[48:02] praise the Lord by day it gets deeper in
[48:06] the in the
[48:07] ground you get deeper in the word you
[48:10] get deeper in the Life of Christ when
[48:13] the Dr comes you have put your hope in
[48:15] the word you have put your hope in
[48:18] Christ and you have the hope that
[48:21] someday there shall be a manifestation
[48:24] of the sons of
[48:25] God you are the sons that must be
[48:29] manifested in that day praise the Lord
[48:32] so when the drought
[48:33] comes it will
[48:36] scch but because you put your
[48:38] trust in the word of God you still
[48:42] remain
[48:43] standing and then the storms will
[48:46] come and it will come and hit you then
[48:50] you go the other sight you go the other
[48:53] s but at the end of the day you still
[48:57] come out
[48:58] Victorious and you remain
[49:01] standing praise the Lord what is the
[49:04] drought the drought are the hardships in
[49:07] life the drought are the persecutions
[49:11] along the
[49:12] way the drought and the sicknesses and
[49:16] trouble that devil brings along the way
[49:20] the Dr are the desires of the flesh that
[49:24] the enemy brings along the way the flesh
[49:28] the desires the lust of the
[49:30] Flesh and the lusts to have material
[49:35] possession and all those kind of things
[49:39] that take away our attention from the
[49:41] word of
[49:42] God the pain that we go
[49:45] through because of sickness that is all
[49:49] drought and if you have not put your

[52:42] Time praise the lord we can be good
[52:45] Christians but what proves us
[52:49] good is the life that we
[52:52] manifest praise the Lord our bodies
[52:56] a carrier of the
[52:58] seity and the
[53:01] farmer God the Lord Jesus Christ wants
[53:05] to have these seeds in
[53:08] abundance that's why he sld the
[53:11] seeds that's why he sold his
[53:14] word that's why he gave up his
[53:16] life in the season of

[53:23] not only bear the fruits but also bring
[53:27] of
[53:28] harvest praise the lord it's not a one

[54:51] the midst of the
[54:53] droughts he will take care of us
[54:57] we have so many people so many of
[55:00] ouren that have

[55:08] and come short of
[55:11] Fellowship praise the Lord some
[55:14] persist but the life isn't
[55:17] Pleasant they persist B towards the

[56:03] hope that in the evening in the cool of
[56:07] the
[56:08] day in the night we shall regain our
[56:12] strength to push back once
[56:15] again we know that we have a farmer who
[56:19] is very concerned by our
[56:21] Affairs we very concerned by the
[56:24] leaves who wants us be of
[56:27] Fellowship so when you're weak and your
[56:30] leaves have withered and so you have
[56:33] little strength
[56:36] Fellowship he comes with the
[56:40] watering and begins to irrigate
[56:43] you begins to water you can be by the
[56:46] way of the
[56:48] word it can be by way of the word it can
[56:51] be by a
[56:53] worship somehow you start feeling the
[56:56] more still small
[56:58] voice speaking words of
[57:01] encouragement speaking words of hope
[57:04] that is the farmer trying to water the
[57:09] crop why he does not want you to die he
[57:14] wants you to come to
[57:16] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[57:18] of God praise the Lord as long as the

[57:26] as long as the ground has good
[57:30] [Music]
[57:32] minerals and has the necessary
[57:35] content regardless of how hard the
[57:38] drought
[57:41] hit we know that the
[57:45] lifegiver the life the
[57:47] ground will feed us it will feed our
[57:51] roots and the crop will grow regardless
[57:57] spring to
[57:59] Mur we shall come to
[58:01] maturity we shall come to
[58:04] manifestation of the sons of God praise
[58:07] the Lord the drought will come because
