[19:57] and speak the word of God
[20:00] amen we shall take up our

[20:06] chapter 3se
[20:16] 23 amen
[20:18] amen for our subject
[20:23] tonight it shall be dying
[20:27] daily
[20:29] dying daily to
[20:32] ourselves to
[20:35] our amen amen so Romans 2 verse 23
[20:42] says for all have sinned and come short
[20:45] of the glory of God being justified
[20:48] freely by his grace through the
[20:50] Redemption that is in Christ
[20:57] Jesus
[21:14] may the Lord add a blessing to his
[21:19] word amen amen so like I
[21:23] said we shall be taking a simple text
[21:27] subject
[21:29] on dying
[21:31] daily dying daily to
[21:34] ourselves for Christ to
[21:37] live praise the Lord ding daily to our
[21:42] affections dying da to our
[21:45] interests to allow Christ to
[21:48] live amen the scripture said
[21:52] here all have
[21:54] SE and come short of the glory of God
[21:59] and because every day we
[22:02] sin we have all
[22:05] sinned now for us to be
[22:08] reconciled we need Jesus Christ praise
[22:11] the Lord because we sin every
[22:14] day in sin we have to Die daily of this
[22:20] life praise the lord we have to Die
[22:24] daily of this
[22:26] life such that we allow
[22:29] the will of God to live in our
[22:33] lives praise the lordes and
[22:36] says if we say we have not
[22:39] seen we make God a
[22:43] liar that's what he says if we say that
[22:46] we have not seen no we don't move in we
[22:48] have not
[22:50] seen we make God a
[22:53] liar but because we move in
[22:57] sin had to pave a way for
[23:01] us you had to provide a way for
[23:04] us to be reconciled daily to
[23:09] himself praise the name of the Living
[23:11] God that we are reconciled daily to
[23:15] himself praise the living Bo so now I
[23:18] want us to go to a scripture
[23:22] here yes excuse
[23:27] me
[23:30] sorry my Gadget is getting is behaving a
[23:32] little
[23:52] bit amen First
[23:56] Corinthians we can go to chapter
[24:04] 15 let's first let's start with Gans 2
[24:06] verse
[24:09] 20 says I am crucified with
[24:13] Christ I am crucified with
[24:17] Christ
[24:19] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[24:24] liveth in
[24:26] me and says the life which I now
[24:30] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[24:35] the Son of
[24:38] God praise the name of the Living God so
[24:42] that's what Paul says the life that he
[24:46] lives no longer him that
[24:49] liveth Christ that liveth in him so now
[24:52] when we turn to First Corinthians
[24:55] 15 and we start from verse 30
[25:01] say and why stand we in J but every
[25:10] hour I protest by your rejoicing which I
[25:13] have in Christ Jesus our
[25:24] lord I
[25:27] daily after the manner of men I have
[25:30] fought with beasts at
[25:34] Ephesus what what advant what advantages
[25:38] it to
[25:41] me if the dead rise
[25:44] not let us eat and
[25:46] drink for tomorrow we die and then he
[25:50] says be not
[25:52] deceived for such evil
[25:57] conversations
[26:02] for such evil conversations corrupt good
[26:06] manner so now Paul is emphasizing the
[26:09] element of
[26:12] dying says I Die
[26:15] daily for what for the sake of the
[26:18] Gospel of Jesus
[26:20] Christ and when he was speaking here
[26:24] Paul was rebuking the
[26:26] people those that were disputing the
[26:28] resurrection of the
[26:31] Dead praise the Lord he was rebuking
[26:34] evil conversations amongst
[26:37] them that we disputing the the
[26:40] resurrection of the
[26:42] dead and he says if the dead rise
[26:46] not then let us eat and
[26:49] drink for tomorrow we die and we have no
[26:52] hope of
[26:54] Resurrection because we have the hope of
[26:57] Resurrection
[26:59] praise the Lord because we have the hope
[27:01] that after this
[27:03] life there is a life that God has
[27:06] prepared for
[27:08] us we have a mission to look
[27:12] for we have a mission to look
[27:15] after and that is the will of God for
[27:17] our
[27:18] lives that's why he says for that reason
[27:21] I have to Die
[27:24] daily noer I that
[27:27] leave the life of Jesus Christ in
[27:31] me emphasizing the need for us to seek
[27:34] the will of God for our
[27:37] lives prise
[27:40] the for the blood of Jesus
[27:43] Christ when he died the Bible says in
[27:47] Hebrews
[27:49] 12 verse
[27:51] 24 blood of
[27:53] Jesus speaks better
[27:57] things
[27:59] in the life that we
[28:01] live because we are bound to
[28:05] backsliding the prophet says it takes a
[28:07] constant
[28:10] prayer to go to keep us closer to
[28:13] him and at times because of
[28:17] sin it becomes very hard for us to
[28:20] maintain that prayerful
[28:24] life praise the Lord hard for us to
[28:27] maintain stay that constant
[28:32] atmosphere of prayer Keep Us close at
[28:35] God every
[28:37] day praise the Lord the Bible says even
[28:40] when we are at those weakest
[28:44] moments sin condition has pushed us so
[28:49] deep the Bible says when we are weak at
[28:53] that
[28:55] moment then are we strong why because
[28:59] the grace of
[29:01] God that God has provided for us to be
[29:06] reconciled
[29:07] himself the grace of God that God has
[29:10] provided for us to be brought back to
[29:14] him the Grace by which a Christian
[29:18] liveth the Grace by which we
[29:22] walk that Grace still sees us when we
[29:25] are at the weakest of point
[29:28] and what God has provided for us to be
[29:31] reconciled back to
[29:33] him praise the Lord and when that Grace
[29:36] takes
[29:38] over the divine superal nature of
[29:44] God deeps us into his
[29:47] blood for our complete recovery by the
[29:50] blood of Jesus
[29:54] Christ that blood of
[29:57] Jesus speaks better
[30:00] things blood of
[30:02] ab we see that when
[30:05] AB when he was murdered by
[30:07] Cain in Genesis chapter
[30:10] 4 was crying out for
[30:14] vengeance out
[30:16] bitterness praise the Lord but the blood
[30:19] of Jesus
[30:20] Christ which has been provided for
[30:23] us it speaks better things than
[30:26] vengeance
[30:29] praise the Lord speaks forgiveness to
[30:31] our
[30:33] sins it speaks reconciliation to the
[30:37] Fallen speaks Redemption and
[30:41] salvation to our
[30:43] Souls praise the Living God for us to
[30:47] partake of the benefits of that
[30:50] blood for us to partake of the benefits
[30:53] of that
[30:54] sacrifice we go to Die daily of
[30:57] ourselves
[31:00] of our
[31:01] ways allow God's ways in our
[31:05] lives prop says in the message God is
[31:10] provided now there is only two ways of
[31:14] anything that is the way the right
[31:17] way and the wrong way and them ways are
[31:21] your
[31:23] ways and God's ways he says there are
[31:26] two things always
[31:29] there is two
[31:30] ways there is the good way which is
[31:33] God's way and then there is the wrong
[31:36] way which is our ways and you can't be
[31:40] in your
[31:41] way and God's way at the same
[31:45] time you've got to forget your own
[31:49] way in order to get in God's
[31:52] way for as long as you're in your own
[31:56] way out of him
[31:58] way so forsake your
[32:01] ways forsake your
[32:04] thoughts forsake
[32:06] everything about you and rely on one
[32:10] thing that is thus says the
[32:13] Lord so we have to forsake our
[32:16] ways praise the lord we have to forsake
[32:19] all our
[32:21] affections only allow the will of
[32:26] God so
[32:29] be dying to
[32:31] ourselves allow the person of Christ to
[32:34] live in our
[32:35] lives Die
[32:37] daily is to choose the will of God
[32:40] against our own
[32:44] will daily is to choose the will of
[32:49] God of how hard it
[32:53] made for you to Die daily of your
[32:56] interest you have to choose the will of
[32:59] God against your own
[33:02] will praise the Lord and then you have
[33:05] to choose the Lord his
[33:08] way Paul speaks about choosing God his
[33:12] way he was a just
[33:14] man very just man and he sacrificed all
[33:20] his
[33:21] titles his respect his wealth family
[33:26] friends for the sake of the Gospel of
[33:29] Jesus
[33:31] Christ and he was not ashamed of this
[33:35] gospel but he spoke and rebuked evil
[33:38] with
[33:41] boldness why he not consider himself
[33:46] worthy consider his life so
[33:50] precious consider his titles and His
[33:53] glory so
[33:54] precious comp to the word of God
[33:58] so now Paul rejected all those
[34:02] glories and he made a choice and he
[34:04] chose the Lord's
[34:06] way it says in Romans 1 verse
[34:10] 16 I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[34:15] Christ why he made a
[34:18] decision follow the way of the
[34:21] Lord is the power of God and
[34:25] salvation everyone that
[34:29] believeth so now if this just man was
[34:33] not ashamed of the way of the
[34:37] Lord a man who endured all
[34:40] persecution for the sake of the way of
[34:43] the
[34:44] Lord praise the Lord how much more ought
[34:48] we to
[34:49] be how much
[34:52] more should we
[34:56] be
[34:59] the titles that he
[35:01] carried if he
[35:03] carried the knowledge that he had
[35:05] acquired in
[35:08] theology rejected and he undressed
[35:12] himself all those
[35:14] glories and accepted to follow the way
[35:17] of the Lord how must we be
[35:21] today the Lord we all to choose the
[35:24] Lord's
[35:26] will our own will so doing we shall be
[35:31] dying to
[35:32] ourselves allr to
[35:35] live praise the name of living God and
[35:38] now we find that this Paul who died
[35:40] daily of his own
[35:44] way he let the word of the Lord be
[35:48] exalted praise the Lord but we also find
[35:53] where the scripture says all have
[35:56] sin and come short of the glory of
[36:01] God Paul finds
[36:03] himself Waring against
[36:08] himself praise the Lord at some point in
[36:12] time there are some bit of element of uh
[36:16] of uh
[36:18] self
[36:21] extion when he want his wanted to
[36:26] exalt before
[36:29] God each time Paul saw that coming
[36:32] through he remind himself of God his
[36:35] provided
[36:37] way and he looked beyond his
[36:40] past looked beyond his
[36:43] glories and he looked way up to
[36:48] Calvary Jesus and each time he saw
[36:52] that he says I Die daily I Die daily of
[36:56] these my glor
[36:59] daily of all my
[37:01] imperfection I Die daily of all my
[37:04] desires allow the Gospel of Jesus
[37:07] Christ allow the Life of Christ to exalt
[37:12] itself praise the Lord he relied on the
[37:15] principle of
[37:18] Grace he relied on the grace of
[37:21] God the power of Jesus Christ to
[37:24] overcome that sin that wanted to exalt
[37:29] itself before
[37:31] God praise the Lord his
[37:35] struggles struggles in his
[37:37] life he was still living this
[37:40] m and those imperfections used to come
[37:44] through and wanted to exalt
[37:47] themselves that's why in Romans chapter
[37:51] 712 he
[37:53] says I find then a law but when I would
[37:58] do
[38:00] good evil is still present with
[38:04] me iight in the law of God after the
[38:08] inward
[38:12] man after the inward
[38:15] man I see another law in my
[38:20] members Waring against the law of my
[38:24] mind bringing me into captivity the law
[38:27] of sin which is in my
[38:32] members and he cried out and said oh
[38:35] riched man that I
[38:38] am who will deliver me from the
[38:42] body man am I
[38:47] oh who will deliver me from this
[38:51] body of this death but I thank God
[38:55] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[38:58] so then with the mind I myself serve the
[39:01] law of
[39:04] God this flesh is still bound to
[39:08] sin he desires to serve
[39:11] sin and time he go to that
[39:14] point he chose to die to
[39:18] himself chose to die to
[39:22] his chose to die to those
[39:26] members body that we are Waring against
[39:29] the law of
[39:31] God the law to serve the
[39:35] Lord to exal Jesus
[39:38] Christ he says for that
[39:41] reason I choose to Die
[39:45] daily Paul did not choose to die to
[39:50] himself that this war that was existing
[39:53] in his
[39:55] members would exal beyond the will of
[40:00] God for that reason the gopel of Jesus
[40:04] Christ not be
[40:08] exalted to die to himself to die to all
[40:12] those
[40:13] thoughts that he would choose to serve
[40:15] the
[40:16] Lord praise the Lord and
[40:20] then took the way of the
[40:22] Lord how much more must we die of our
[40:27] thought
[40:30] much of our
[40:33] imaginations
[40:35] man time those thoughts came his way
[40:38] those
[40:40] imaginations
[40:42] self time it came his way he had to make
[40:46] a
[40:47] choice and he always made a perfect
[40:50] choice chose the Lord his way and he
[40:54] rejected his own
[40:55] s how much we as
[40:59] Christians we to die to these our
[41:04] imaginations our
[41:06] pride was
[41:08] Pride had it all he was a great man he
[41:13] had been schooled and he had the
[41:15] knowledge of
[41:17] theology such a great man he
[41:21] would he chose to reject
[41:25] price over the will of God
[41:28] praise the Lord how much more ow we to
[41:32] die of our
[41:33] pride allow the will of God how much
[41:37] more we to die of
[41:40] boasting
[41:43] conspiracies and
[41:46] envy and anger and bitterness and evil
[41:51] talks and all evil
[41:53] lives and impatience with one another
[41:58] with the word of God and his
[42:01] promises how much more ought we to all
[42:05] these
[42:06] things for the will of God praise the
[42:10] Lord and how do we dive
[42:13] ourselves by choosing the will of
[42:16] God by choosing to go with the word of
[42:20] God prise the Lord by being obedient to
[42:23] the word of
[42:25] God by being Obed to the Holy
[42:28] Spirit prise the Lord that when our our
[42:34] members want to exalt beyond the will of
[42:38] God choose to humble
[42:41] yourself such that you allow God to come
[42:45] and exalt
[42:46] himself praise the lord we Must Die
[42:50] daily to stay in the way of
[42:53] God praise the Lord we thank God
[42:57] because he has provided for us a
[43:00] way of how we can die to
[43:05] ourselves be kept in his
[43:08] will the Lord at Cal when Jesus died the
[43:13] sacrifice that was given for
[43:15] us when he poured his blood he gave us a
[43:20] life and he gave us Grace praise the
[43:23] Lord that even when we have become so
[43:26] weak
[43:28] and we cannot contain the precious in
[43:30] our
[43:33] members Grace is still
[43:36] sufficient prise the Lord even when our
[43:39] members rle against
[43:42] ourselves
[43:43] Pride
[43:45] self wanting to take shape against the
[43:47] word of
[43:49] God is a sufficient
[43:52] Grace that still brings us back to
[43:55] himself that Grace
[43:57] the grace of Jesus Christ praise the
[44:00] Lord which is God is provided
[44:03] way God has provided for us to be kept
[44:07] in his
[44:09] will praise the Lord so what ought we to
[44:12] do we need to accept Grace we need to
[44:16] walk in Grace praise the lord we need to
[44:20] Simply accept the will of
[44:23] God that is what he has provided for us
[44:26] to be to die to
[44:28] ourselves allow Christ to live in
[44:31] Us Praise the Lord to Die
[44:34] daily is letting go of
[44:38] oneself for Christ to
[44:41] live praise the Lord being identified
[44:44] with Jesus Christ and his
[44:47] word choosing the word of
[44:50] God choosing do the the will of the word
[44:53] of
[44:54] God accepting the appro of the Cross of
[45:00] Calvary to be led of the spirit of
[45:04] God not self
[45:07] will living a life of Jesus
[45:10] Christ that reflects the acts of the
[45:13] holy spirit in the body of a
[45:17] Believer how to do
[45:20] it Paul had to do it in order to reflect
[45:24] the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[45:28] the rest of the world he says when I die
[45:32] to
[45:33] myself I am crucified with Jesus
[45:36] Christ praise the Lord when I died
[45:39] myself I am crucified with Jesus
[45:43] Christ and he says if I
[45:46] die as many times as
[45:50] possible I am allowing Jesus Christ to
[45:55] come and live within me
[45:57] why because when you
[45:59] die not losing your
[46:01] [Applause]
[46:04] breath try to talk about dying your self
[46:10] will your own
[46:13] thoughts praise the Lord that it is no
[46:16] longer you that is
[46:18] living but Christ
[46:21] himself Paul says when I die I am
[46:25] crucified with Jesus
[46:27] Gans verse 20
[46:31] says I am crucified with
[46:35] Christ
[46:36] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[46:42] liveth in me and the life which I now
[46:46] live because I have died
[46:50] myself the life that I
[46:53] live is not I that
[46:55] liveth praise the Lord but I live by the
[46:59] faith of the Son of
[47:02] God who loved me and gave himself for
[47:07] me praise the Lord because I am dead to
[47:11] myself no longer I that liveth but
[47:15] Christ that liveth in me because I am
[47:18] dead
[47:19] myself
[47:21] influence of this flesh has no effect on
[47:25] me that's what Paul said he said there
[47:29] there is a war in my
[47:32] members when I try to do
[47:35] good I try do the will of
[47:38] God that is always the mind of evil
[47:41] present with
[47:43] me comping me to do the
[47:46] contrary says but I choose to Die
[47:50] daily such the influence of this
[47:54] flesh has no effect on me
[47:57] the influence of the affections of this
[48:01] flesh have no influence on me why
[48:05] because it's no longer I that
[48:07] live but Christ
[48:10] that praise the Lord message
[48:15] communion communion of 1962 the prophet
[48:19] says our bodies need food and drink each
[48:25] day in order
[48:27] survive for our physical
[48:29] body if we don't take food each day and
[48:33] drink our bodies
[48:36] weaken then there is something in
[48:39] us that we must have
[48:42] food there is something on theide of
[48:46] us that convinces that you need
[48:50] food even if you pretend that you don't
[48:52] want to
[48:54] eat the hunger your stomach will push
[48:58] you to ask for
[49:01] something in order to survive and also
[49:04] have energy
[49:06] to praise the Lord says something in us
[49:10] that we must have
[49:12] food one day's food will not last for
[49:16] the next
[49:18] day you've got to have food each day to
[49:22] strengthen your motal
[49:24] being so you can live over
[49:28] you can live over without F but you are
[49:32] weaker and the second day you you are
[49:36] still
[49:37] weaker and the third day you are getting
[49:40] tremendous
[49:42] weak why because the body has not been
[49:46] given
[49:47] food but if the body needs food to
[49:51] survive that means even the life that we
[49:55] have our souls also need to be
[50:00] fed in order for for them to
[50:04] live if your body needs
[50:07] food even your soul needs
[50:10] food in order to live and the prophet
[50:13] says here it does not mean you eat only
[50:16] today and then you survive the second
[50:19] day he says yes you can eat today and
[50:23] survive the next day your body will
[50:26] become
[50:29] the Lord now what do we need we need to
[50:32] eat this food every
[50:34] day to eat spiritual food every day for
[50:38] you to be able to live say well that's
[50:42] what many times that we do in the
[50:44] spiritual
[50:46] real you see each day we go to commune
[50:49] with
[50:51] Christ we've got to talk to him each
[50:55] day go to settle it with him each
[50:59] day said I die each
[51:03] day each day I die I live not me but
[51:08] Christ lives in
[51:09] me if your physical body needs food each
[51:15] day drink each day to survive you are
[51:18] spiritual body need spiritual food and
[51:20] communion with the Lord each that
[51:25] survive said shall not live by bread
[51:28] alone but by every word that proceeds
[51:32] out of the mouth of
[51:33] God each day we've go to study the
[51:37] Bible each day you need spiritual
[51:40] food to give you spiritual
[51:44] energ food give you the
[51:47] momentum praise the Lord carry on for
[51:50] the next day every day you need
[51:52] spiritual food keep you awake that you
[51:56] are able to die
[51:59] yourself and let the inner person Christ
[52:02] himself
[52:04] exalt otherwise if you eat
[52:07] today read your Bible today and then
[52:11] tomorrow you say after all I read
[52:13] yesterday praise the Lord the spirit is
[52:16] getting weaker then carry over yes
[52:19] you're able to
[52:20] survive but yet your spirit is getting
[52:23] weaker and you're not getting sufficient
[52:27] energy
[52:29] to your members that are Waring against
[52:33] yourself how did
[52:35] overcome prise the Lord he chose to go
[52:38] by the word every day of his
[52:40] life ding daily he shows Christ every
[52:44] day of his
[52:45] life he confess Christ every day of his
[52:49] life he moved he rebuked the devil in
[52:52] the name of Jesus
[52:54] Christ made sure that spoke about Christ
[52:57] everywhere he
[52:59] Liv thrown in in the
[53:02] prison he still spoke about Jesus he
[53:06] about Jesus he was feeding every
[53:09] day so doing was able to die

[54:09] out of the mouth of
[54:10] God praise the Lord yes sir that's the
[54:14] scripture when died it was no longer him
[54:19] so he was not ashamed of the Gospel of
[54:22] Jesus Christ when we die to
[54:25] ourselves no longer us that live but
[54:29] Christ himself and Christ can never be
[54:32] ashamed of his own words praise the Lord
[54:36] so when we die daily we shall not be
[54:39] ashamed profess that we are Christians
[54:42] we be ashamed speak about the gospel
[54:46] that we have received to speak about the
[54:49] message that we believe why because now
[54:54] that that influence
[54:57] would cause you to be
[54:58] ashamed no longer living because you
[55:03] yourself Christ Christ wants to make
[55:06] himself
[55:08] exalted and by exting himself he must
[55:11] speak about himself everywhere at home
[55:15] praise the Lord in the church in the
[55:18] streets at the place of work everywhere
[55:22] Christ manifesting himself prise the
[55:25] Lord as
[55:27] Christians choose to Die
[55:30] daily get
[55:33] identified with Christ we shall exalt
[55:36] Christ everywhere we
[55:37] go because it is not our lives but when
[55:41] they look at you they're not seeing you
[55:44] because you ad yourself they seeing
[55:47] Christ and they seeing the Life of
[55:50] Christ because you no longer live but
[55:54] Christ lives you praise the Living God
[55:58] message the end time
[56:00] evangelis
[56:03] 1962 Jesus said you must be born again
[56:08] in order to be born
[56:09] again is letting yourself go and
[56:14] die and the spirit of Christ come into
[56:18] you then you are you are no more
[56:24] yours praise the Lord
[56:27] no longer yours it is Christ in
[56:31] you the holy
[56:33] spiritul said I Die daily yet I live not
[56:39] I but Christ lives in me praise the Lord
[56:44] John the
[56:46] rator the
[56:48] Divine who received the Revelation and
[56:51] wrote it
[56:52] down he died to himself
[56:56] for Christ to live and the life of
[56:59] Christ was in
[57:01] him he was free from the chains and
[57:03] influence of
[57:06] sin was free from
[57:09] Fear he was free from
[57:11] affection he wasn't ruled by any of
[57:14] those affections of the
[57:17] body that's why when they persecuted
[57:21] him of the gos of Jesus
[57:23] Christ he was not afraid to
[57:27] die praise the Lord because he knew that
[57:30] it was not him that is
[57:33] living was no longer John that is
[57:37] living was Christ in
[57:39] John that's why he was able to face even
[57:42] if it meant
[57:45] death he was still Bal praise the Lord
[57:49] because he had already died
[57:51] himself and it was the life of Jesus
[57:53] Christ in
[57:55] him life of Jesus
[57:57] Christ praise the Lord that manifested
[58:00] in
[58:01] him we know that it does not
[58:04] die he died once and now he live
[58:09] forever died once at
[58:12] Calvary died
[58:14] at he went down praise the Lord he went
[58:19] and conquered the
[58:21] KE he went to the devil and he conquered
[58:24] death from
[58:26] and now he he came back praise the Lord
[58:29] and so if he conquered death he died
[58:33] once and he liveth
[58:35] forever Christ died
[58:37] once
[58:39] forever lives in us that means we have a
[58:43] life shall not die but we have a life
[58:47] that liveth
[58:48] forever even when this body is
[58:51] destroyed the life that lives in us the
[58:55] life of Jesus Christ
[58:57] that it is
[58:59] eternal that lives forever so now John
[59:03] had this
[59:05] Revelation that he had died
[59:07] himself and it was noer him that was
[59:11] living Christ The Life of Christ was in
[59:15] Joy when they attempted to kill
[59:19] him he was not afraid praise the Lord
[59:23] even when the devil
[59:25] attacks that life that lives on the
[59:28] inside of
[59:29] us all those kind of
[59:32] afflictions diseases and all
[59:36] sin and all the Pains of this
[59:39] body the life that we have shall not
[59:43] die praise the Lord so now they tried to
[59:46] kill him they want they boil him in
[59:51] oil he couldn't
[59:53] die why because was no
[59:58] longer Christ on the inside
[1:00:01] of he was determined to even face
[1:00:04] death because he knew that even when
[1:00:07] they touch this
[1:00:08] body he had a life on the
[1:00:11] inside that could not die praise the
[1:00:15] Lord that is the assurance that we
[1:00:19] have praise the Lord that we have died
[1:00:21] to
[1:00:22] ourselves we have died to these bodies
[1:00:26] if Christ is living in us even when we
[1:00:29] are faced with these
[1:00:31] afflictions when we are faced with kind
[1:00:33] this kind of
[1:00:35] diseases it is cancer know that the best
[1:00:39] it can
[1:00:40] do the best it can
[1:00:44] do to affect this body it cannot affect
[1:00:49] the
[1:00:49] life Jesus Christ that we have received
[1:00:53] why because his life Liv
[1:00:59] forever God himself now if John had died
[1:01:04] himself was able to
[1:01:07] understand all these
[1:01:10] afflictions for the sake of the
[1:01:12] Gospel until they threw him on the
[1:01:16] island but even when he was thrown
[1:01:19] there and all the
[1:01:22] Scorpions
[1:01:24] the them
[1:01:26] animals could not still touch that
[1:01:30] life the Lord he had a
[1:01:34] life which was beyond the things around
[1:01:38] him was beyond the afflictions that
[1:01:42] he and that is the life that we are
[1:01:45] given we die to
[1:01:47] ourselves praise the Lord and now talk
[1:01:51] about
[1:01:52] St he was
[1:01:54] stoned thought when they
[1:01:57] to St the life that was living
[1:02:00] on the best they
[1:02:03] could St his body but they could not
[1:02:06] Stone the life out of him he still
[1:02:09] confessed
[1:02:10] Christ he still confessed Jesus
[1:02:14] Christ even at that point of death
[1:02:17] praise the Lord about
[1:02:19] Daniel they wanted to kill him they
[1:02:23] thought by throwing him in the den
[1:02:26] would kill the life that he had
[1:02:29] received but he had a life that was not
[1:02:33] his but the life of God
[1:02:36] himself was living in Daniel and as long
[1:02:39] as that life was there there was nothing
[1:02:43] that was able to with
[1:02:44] understand and the Lions had nothing to
[1:02:47] do with that
[1:02:49] Li talk
[1:02:51] about and all and his two
[1:02:54] friends and
[1:02:57] they had been given a
[1:02:59] life because they had made a
[1:03:02] choice to go in the way of the
[1:03:05] Lord they had made a choice to follow
[1:03:08] God provided
[1:03:10] way not they were not
[1:03:13] ready to denounce God's provided
[1:03:17] with chose
[1:03:20] to they chose to die to themselves and
[1:03:25] yes they
[1:03:26] themselves if they had not died
[1:03:29] themselves there is no way they would
[1:03:32] Mar to
[1:03:33] fire because this body has
[1:03:38] affection when it comes near
[1:03:40] fire that affection Christ
[1:03:43] fear and they would fear if they were
[1:03:46] living by their
[1:03:48] lives those three young men they are not
[1:03:51] living their own lives but they are
[1:03:54] living the life of God himself
[1:03:56] that's why even when they fa the fire
[1:03:59] they were not afraid to face because
[1:04:02] they had more than
[1:04:04] fire on theide of was eternal they had
[1:04:10] Revelation not even that fire could
[1:04:13] quench the fire that Wasing on the
[1:04:16] side
[1:04:17] through come
[1:04:20] out the so now if we must win over all
[1:04:25] this TR
[1:04:30] affection we to die
[1:04:33] ourselves and allow Christ to live in
[1:04:36] us to give us the victory that we can
[1:04:39] overcome all those
[1:04:42] troubles
[1:04:43] brother because he had made a good
[1:04:46] choice he chosen the Lord is
[1:04:50] provided children go in the will of
[1:04:54] God
[1:04:56] even when he met this firece
[1:05:00] bull the grace of God that God provided
[1:05:05] for him because he had chosen that
[1:05:08] himself was able to bring down this
[1:05:11] Fierce
[1:05:12] bull not
[1:05:14] affect had killed so many people but
[1:05:18] because there was a different life in
[1:05:20] the life of
[1:05:22] BR came before this
[1:05:24] bull could not affect him he was not
[1:05:28] living his life there was the life of
[1:05:30] Jesus Christ in
[1:05:32] him because he had denounced
[1:05:34] himself and he had allowed Christ to
[1:05:37] live if we denounce
[1:05:39] ourselves we denounce our
[1:05:42] affection denounce our
[1:05:45] ideas you denounce our self
[1:05:49] love and allow Christ to
[1:05:52] live we shall have the grace sufficient
[1:05:56] to S against all afflictions of
[1:06:00] life we shall have gra
[1:06:03] sufficient to go through all
[1:06:06] diseases to go through all
[1:06:10] pain through all
[1:06:12] pain without fear why it is not you that
[1:06:17] is living but Christ has come and he
[1:06:21] lives on the
[1:06:22] inside praise the Lord so as Christians
[1:06:27] we ought to Die
[1:06:29] daily that Christ
[1:06:32] himself may come and live and when he
[1:06:35] lives it's no longer you it's no longer
[1:06:39] I it's no longer my will praise the Lord
[1:06:43] even when I want something so
[1:06:45] much as long as it's against the will of
[1:06:49] God I will choose the will of
[1:06:52] God I will not choose my own will that
[1:06:56] Grace as long as you remain
[1:06:59] obedient there is that sufficient
[1:07:02] Grace to enable us look and follow the
[1:07:05] will of
[1:07:07] God against our own
[1:07:10] will the B says many are the plans of
[1:07:13] man in his
[1:07:17] heart but the Lord will
[1:07:22] prevails
[1:07:24] about is you and and I it is the
[1:07:27] Christian who has received the word of
[1:07:30] God you who have received of the life of
[1:07:34] God no long governed by your s
[1:07:38] will but you always pray for the Lord's
[1:07:42] will the grace of God has been provided
[1:07:45] for us and it is always present with us
[1:07:50] to support us he's always present with
[1:07:53] us to help us in the will of God the
[1:07:57] prophet says how do we come to that by
[1:08:01] keeping a constant prayer
[1:08:04] life the Lord and the more you keep that
[1:08:07] constant prayer
[1:08:08] life the more you love God the more you

[1:08:33] come in the way of the
[1:08:34] world praise the Lord that's what Paul
[1:08:37] did in in Romans chapter 7 he say yes I

[1:08:53] he do he shows the Lord his way
[1:08:56] the will to do good will to the word of
[1:08:59] God the word of God that's how we were
[1:09:03] able to receive this

[1:09:59] needs as long as we are going by the
[1:10:02] will of
[1:10:03] God going by the word of God his grace
[1:10:08] will always go before
[1:10:10] us says the feet of the
[1:10:14] righteous of the LA who are the
[1:10:18] righte they that obeyed the word of
[1:10:21] God accepted to go in the Lord's proph
[1:10:27] the will of God whether the rest of the
