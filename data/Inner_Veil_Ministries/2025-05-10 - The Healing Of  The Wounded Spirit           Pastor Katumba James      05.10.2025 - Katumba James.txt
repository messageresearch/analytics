We are grateful this morning that you've given us this opportunity that we can come into your presence and you promised us in your word that where two or three are gathered in your name. You will be there in their we speak to our hearts. We also hear our prayers. We heal the sick in our ministry the sinners in our ministry. that Lord may set every captive free and you may fill us with your Holy Spirit.

You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thank God for being back this morning. Is there somebody coming here for the first time? You can raise up your hand. believe we are not strangers to anybody. Praise the name of our Lord. We thank God for bringing our pastor back. Amen. Amen. And we just keep on praying for him because there's a lot of work he's doing outside in the mission field. Just pray the Lord gives him more grace. Amen. Amen. So today we have two services. We have the Lord's supper. service and even the foot washing from 5:00. Praise the name of our Lord. Then next Saturday, we are going to have our praying and fasting meeting. Praise the name of our Lord. And as many as can, it's good to be part of them. That will be on 11th of this month, October. Saturday we having praying and fasting meeting here. Then on Sunday which is the next Sunday which is 12th of this month we shall have two services also together but after service for the youth who are going in school I know not many of them are around. But still we shall meet those few around instead of saying let us wait for them to be in holiday. So we shall keep on having maintaining those meetings. Mid of the month afternoon service we shall have the youth meetings always in the middle of the month shall raise the youth meetings for those who are in school. Then at the end of the month we shall have for those who are out of school. Remember last time when we met here that was last Sunday there were quite a number of questions and then we took time in them and I believe even next. So if you have any question to bring them before time so that we can have enough time for preparation. Praise the name of our Lord. Then on 19th, that's two weeks from now, the weekend after the next weekend, we are going to host Pastor Tom from Clodale, Canada. [Music] Praise the name of our Lord. They are longtime friends of our pastor and invited him to come. He invited him to come when he was in Canada. [Music] &gt;&gt; And we thank God that he has come our way. Praise the name of the Lord. So we expecting quite many people to be around. So we need also to see that we pull up our support. Praise the name of our Lord. We expecting over 200 people to be with us, maybe over 70 or 80 pastors to be now the Lord will give the grace that day. So I call upon your support that you send your contributions to brother can have the meal of all of us together. We need I think about one and a half million shillings for lunch. I was asking brother Peter on Friday and then he said he has only 110,000 and that was what was saved from the previous time. So I call upon your contribution. Last time I think we put in little I don't think it was more than 300,000 the contributions which came from the people. So you can imagine where the balance came from. So we just need to be concerned about these burdens. Let us be part of the services of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Be like theite woman. All the other widow said that I have only the last meal. But then the prophet told him told her give me that. She didn't know what was going to happen. But the Lord cares. Praise the name of Lord. So let us not be in that situation. when was telling Esther &gt;&gt; that you know you never know this is your time of helping when you're in the kingdom and then he told her but if you don't help will come from elsewhere at least I don't want that help to come from elsewhere I want it to come from me praise the name of our Lord say I'm the one going to support not our brothers I think will do will do just be partaking of the blessing of the lord praise the name of now before go the reading of the word invite the youth to come and sing amen Amen.

Oh Jesus. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you God for [Applause] Amen. The great physician is here. Praise the name of the Lord. So all that we have need of the Lord is ready to provide for them. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us pray again. Father again we thank you. We thank you that you are the great physician and you are ever present Lord to heal us in every situation. We pray may speak to our hearts and you said in your word that you sent your word and heal them. And we pray that the healing of our bodies, the healing of our spirits and the healing of our souls happen when we are hearing the word of God that he may set every one of us free that we may be able to rejoice before it. preeminence upon these psalms that you may speak to us that we may hear from you for the glory and horn of your name in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us turn to our Bibles in Proverbs chapter 18. We're reading from verse 10 up to verse 19. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "The name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous runth it and is safe. The rich man's wealth is his strong city and as an high wall in his own consent. Before destruction, the heart of the man is and before honor is humility. He thatth a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame unto him. The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can bear The heart of the prudent getth knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. A man's gift makes room for him and brings him before great men. He that is first in his own cause seemth just, but his neighbor cometh and searches him. The Lord causes contentions to seize and part between the mighty. [Music] A brother offended is harder to be one than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. May God bless his word. You may be seated. So I want to preach on the subject the healing of the wounded spirit. wounded. Praise the name of Lord. You know, maybe afflicted, &gt;&gt; distressed, &gt;&gt; bruised, praise the name of our Lord. The healing of the wounded spirit. So yeah, the Bible has told us In verse 14, &gt;&gt; the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity. In other words, maybe you know your disease, you know, so the spirit can sustain you to a certain extent to be patient, you know, to endure. But then he says when a person when a a spirit is wounded, stricken or you know depressed, you know, maybe you know afflicted, you know, like on Wednesday we are talking about Samson being afflicted. you know the words of you know they were so much afflicting Samson you know putting a lot of pressure on you and you know there's where the scripture says that if you have a wife you know and all the time her words are just depressing you then he says you'd rather live on the roof rooftop. Now you can imagine you're not meant to sleep outside but you find sleeping in your house with your own wife it is so terrible. [Music] So now you see that oppressed Samson &gt;&gt; by her words by her deception. And then we see that we also go through the same kind of situations in different kind of circumstances because of the pressures of the time. Maybe because of the things you are aspiring to achieve. Sometimes it can be because of the sicknesses. Sometimes can be because of the disadvantaged background you have. You know the family you were born from. you know, not so much privileges that you had. [Music] You know, even eating a good meal would be by luck. Like now many children are studying their last term. But then you get some of these children on the road selling something. Then sometimes others are in school like I remember I think it was either on Friday when I was traveling back. I was going back home and then I think I was passing through Kag and then there was a mother carrying a baby on her back and carrying a hole. I think it was I'm just forgetting the exact time but it was during that time midday and then there was a young man a young boy of about 10 12 years also carrying a hole and I felt bad the other children are in school but then this one is in the garden with the son who's meant to be in school and of course the young such a young boy would think about the friends who are in school but then they are taking you to the garden or maybe something different like that and all these kind of things can affect us. Praise the name of our Lord. Different kind of scenarios in life. Now we are living in a time which is a neurotic age. You know People are crazy. You know the decisions they make are craziness in the message the junction of time he said and if they have been through all of these things when all the world history is climaxing in this great drama. What's the matter? What makes people so nervous? Why is even the psychiatrist are coming to be prayed for? Why is the world in a navious age, a neuroretic age, when the people can't wait down the street 90 miles an hour, stop at a beer joint, two hours before they go home, run over people. You know it's just like now on the road somebody can just come and enter the road doesn't regard who are using the road only to enter crosses these cars and then stops ahead and you start wondering what's the rush for like now you can imagine this was in 1956 somebody driving very fast speed, you know, 90 mph is about 150 km an hour, you know, and then after driving too fast, he's rushing to go to a drinking point and then he sits there. Then you ask him, "Why were you rushing on the road? Madness. What's everybody in such a hurry? You can't visit your neighbor. You don't have no friends. You don't know who lives next door to you. You ain't got time to do this. You are in a hurry. What is the matter? Praise the name of So you see tension is building up everywhere. Circumstances keep on oppressing us and then you find that yourself. You are completely under you know oppression at your place of work. ts they want you to do like now these days they retrench the stuff and now the gaps which are left there you are the one to fill those gaps and your salary is not increased and you are just afraid you don't want to lose your job a lot of pressure all the you know, a lot of pressure in everything. And so we see that we are living at such a terrible time. And everybody trying to work hard, everybody trying to achieve this. After achieving this, then there's this target. After this target, then there's this target. The world is just in a neurotic age. Pressure everywhere. Now in the message letting off pressure he says we are living in anetic age tension. Everybody is racing here going there and going nowhere. Praise the name of. So it is just a circle like this circle and then you become old in a circle and at the end of the day whatever you struggled for you lose it. Then he says it's just that kind of an age and I know this church would be plugged with it. And as everywhere is plugged with it, the tabernacle is plugged with it. Everywhere the whole world, you know, it's just like, you know, a plague, you know, It's a day of pressure. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry and wait. Drive 90 miles an hour and then go home for supper and wait for two hours to get it ready. But you've been running around to nowhere madness. Then he says it's a time that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nous tension. The wife say something a little contrary. You want to fly off temper. Husband says something. You will part your foot and tell him get in the room. See well now husband I don't want know what's with you. Get out there. attention wife I'm so nervous why what's the matter all this together this tension building then the result of it is doing something wrong acting out of place that's right now it will take the poor act that way. [Music] It will make the middle class act that way. It will make the rich act that way. It will make the wrong act that way. It will make the pretty good act that way. It will make the good act that way because it is tension steam build up. Go to blow it out somewhere. You don't you blow the boiler up wounded spirits. Then he says, "Now we find that it builds up as the day goes by. You talk to your boss. If you are working or so and so if you speak to the kids, come here now. Everybody is guilty. I'm guilty. You are guilty. We do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise. So there is an excess pressure built up today. Before I go further, I might say this. I believe it is the enemy coming down and pressing. It is the devil. And we know the coming of the Lord is at hand. And the Bible says in the last days that the devil would go like a roaring lion. And if he would get you under pressure, hurrying, running over something, you'll make decisions that you wouldn't make if you would sit down and think over it. Praise the name of our Lord. Living under pressure. And you know this happens everywhere. at home, at places of work, in the neighborhood, in the communities where we live. You know, sometimes can happen between you and your friends or it can happen between you and your husband or your wife or between you and your parents or between your your children and yourself. Anywhere it can happen. And so you get your spirit is wounded. Your spirit is afflicted. You don't know sometimes what to do. Sometimes you make wrong decisions. Praise the name of God. And so you see how the devil works out and you know the devil can set you into something and leaves you there to be afflicted. Praise the name of God. He gets you into a situation that's not pleasing. Sometimes it can be because of your own weaknesses or your rebellious spirit. You know, you rebel over something and then it gets you into trouble. Of course, you may not know that I'm getting into trouble. Just like the prodigal son, he had a good father. Everything there is nothing that he lacked. But the group influence say why don't you tell your father to give you what belongs to him and then he got what belonged to him. And then the Bible says not so many days. Of course in that condition he didn't know that he was wrong. You know he was busy enjoying the wealth feeling the power of money. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this and a show off not knowing he was already on the path of destruction. And even as sometimes that we can get ourselves into those kind of challenges not knowing you're on the path of destruction. So now when he got everything he went to a far country he went into captivity but he didn't know that he was in captivity until he wasted everything and the realestrations came to him. no food. Those days he was, you know, busy wasting a lot of money. &gt;&gt; Yesterday I was reading a certain story about the daughter of the president of Cameroon. &gt;&gt; She lives in fivestar or highar hotel in Switzerland. &gt;&gt; And then they were saying that since 1980s They spent $65 million to just hire that place for them. But now you see, you can get yourself under such pressure. Pressure. There's a class you want to be living in, but yet you can't afford it. you can't sustain it. You can't same thing now which happens these days. Maybe you've just got a job and then you want to buy a very expensive car. &gt;&gt; But a car does not use water. You get it? even driving it to town. You can't you can't afford the fuel. When it comes for servicing, they're asking you for a lot of money. Like there are some of those expensive cars. I'm just forgetting some of those names. But just servicing it, you need $30,000 over 100 million. So just service it. And I also want to bribe this pressure. &gt;&gt; Cyrus knows them. Pressure &gt;&gt; and that's what was happening to this prodigal son. You are having the money but you don't know how to make the money. How do you spend and you can't get inside? You're going to waste everything you have because the needs keep on coming, problems keep on coming, pressures keep on coming. So now before you spend where is the next money going to come then you make a right decision. Why if I spend all this what will I have tomorrow? So this prodigal son he just wasted everything. And you know the Bible says a rich man has many friends. But even when you are poor, even your neighbors just despise you. A very bad condition. You may have wisdom, but everybody will despise your wisdom. So the Bible says a poor man uses tells those stories. He wants this but doesn't go directly. You know, &gt;&gt; so now the prodigal son when he wasted everything even his very friends left him. And then the Bible says he went and joined a man of that country who had a farm. Now you can imagine a Jew to go and work in swine when the swine were eating husks. You know even these days speaks eat husks. A man was salvating and the Bible says nobody would give him that held in captivity. Praise the name of our Lord. So we see even the children of Israel, they were held in captivity when they rejected the word of the Lord. When they rejected the path of righteousness, then they got themselves in captivity. And the same thing with us. We can end up in captivity when we don't obey the word of God. It may be a captivity of a certain condition. It may be a captivity that demons just keep on tormenting you. A demon of anger. You become annoyed over nothing. You know it can be another you know a bad habit. You know you've gotten hold in a situation which is not pleasant. Praise the name of our Lord. There was a young girl here in the message from that time. This girl refused to obey her parents. And when she refused to obey her parents, she saw a young man because he had good hair. She fell for that young man. And even some people can just fall for somebody because of something [Music] and then they go they turn their ears from hearing and correction. They have their friends they are following. So now in the message from that time it says going into the emergency room there was a beautiful young woman sitting there great brown eyes and dark hair. She looked like she would have been a queen for any man's palace. Said, "How do you do?" She said, "How do you do, brother Branham?" I looked around and there they was in a straight jacket [Music] and screaming and then cursing and a woman using the bed pan and wiping her face in it. Excuse that. I looked around and there was then he said for after eating your breakfast you just okay then he says and there was there was what your faith was when you preach divine healing then he said I said well I just don't know where to start first the younger lady said I wish you would start with me fast. Now you can imagine young woman put in an emergency you know and then now brother Brandham reaches the room with many people were there and then he sees the mess in the place they wouldn't put them with with other sick people in the church. Then he said, "Where do I start from?" And then this girl said, "Start with me." The young lady said, "I wish you would start with me first. If you don't, I said you are not a patient." She said, "Yes, sir." I said, "Well, what's the matter?" She said, "Mr. Brham, Mr. I was raised in a Christian home. I was raised to honor God. She said, "One time I got out with a boy. My mother and father warned me not to go with such a boy." But said he was ch. He had you know hair pretty. You can imagine those things. Maybe he was driving a car or he had a good motorcycle or you would change clothes and then your ears cannot hear your parents and then you go with the neighbor or your friend or wherever it is. That's where her problem started from not hearing. Let us go to paragraph 38. He said, "Now this younger lady, I say to her, &gt;&gt; what happened?" She said, "Well, a boy." This boy smoked and said, "He tried to get me to smoke and I wouldn't do it. and said one night he gave me a piece of a candy that had been domated Spanish fly. Then he said, "You veterary doctors know what that means." So she said, "He got me on the wrong road. She said, "Then I eat this candy thinking it was all right." She said, "I don't know what happened till the next day and my morals as a young lady was ruined." He raped her and maybe she came awake when he had already taken off. And she said, I thought, what is the difference? Because like maybe she tried to keep herself sober, but then how do you keep yourself sober with the wrong company? They trick you like Samson and Samson thought he's keeping himself sober thinking that cared about his life but was about money. And even this young man with pretty hair was about pleasure and wasting his life. No value for her. So after wasting her throw her there and then when she came back to her senses said now what values do I have now then she started drinking see how wrong road she was taking but how did she start refusing to obey the parent and sometimes these things can start as simple as that in our Christian life. It can also start by you rebelling against the word of God. Then captivity keeps on increasing. The devil takes on more room. Praise the name of the Lord. You know like coming to church in timeh I think I'll go at any time. But then there are things you have troubles in your life. There are things that are binding you but you are failing to obey the simple things by 9:00. We should be in church. I I have a lot of things to do. So it holds you. It takes time to release your deliverance because you're not doing the simple things. song service I will not be there. So even the things that bind you cannot relieve you. When the preacher comes to preach your mind is still troubled. You are on the other thing. You are on the other thing. What is it? You know we need to learn to be obedient to the word of God. However simple it is, it matters a lot before God. see that you don't have an excuse. Praise the name of the Lord. Why would I miss church service on Wednesday when I work in Ginger Town? But you make sure that you are busy through that day. Your schedule is about making more money. So how are you going to get the favor of God if you cannot obey the things of God? You know God was telling Eli about his children and then he said those who take me lightly you know they don't honor me. Then he said I take them lightly. So how do we take the things of God? You know, but you need God to deliver you, but yet at the same time, you don't care about him. You don't want to obey even the least things. Praise the name of our Lord. So how are you going to be helped? And so you find that the devil takes opportunity and gets more of bondage. He keeps on binding you, binding you. Like now this girl, see the trend, she lost her trust in her parents and then started trusting this young man until this young man wasted her. Then she started getting into a deeper wrong side. Said, "I started drinking." And then he said, She said, "I joined church. I did everything I know how to do." And he said, "Finally, I served a time at the good shepherd's home in the Catholic institution. She went to many different places until she just became a prostitute. And then they would arrest her, put her in prison, two years, three years, comes back just a wasted life, wounded, you know that kind of condition. And then he says, she did everything. Then he said, &gt;&gt; I said I drank alcohol. I said then I would quit that then picked it up again. I served two years in the woman's penicary then I would come out. I joined another church and said then you do a bit good. She said I heard about your meetings. I thought I would come down and see if you would help me trying to get back from where she left when she disobeyed her parents. What a long journey she took. What a long time of captivity. Like children of Israel, 70 years in captivity. I don't know what your captivity is this morning. Praise the name of Allah, but before God, there's always a time of restoration. Praise the name of us. So then she heard about it, there was something in her that would tell her, I should not do the things I'm doing. I should not be drinking. I should not be on the pro. I should not be a prostitute. I should not be smoking. Something was still in her but how to overcome it is what she was facing. She would go to this church. She'll try to do this kind of thing. She try to do this kind of thing. But it was still holding her binding her when she heard about brother Brham's meeting I want to go there. And then he said and I looked at her a beautiful woman. I thought what wouldn't that be a queen for some little tired evangelist coming in from the field go out sweet little wife put her arms around him said darling I know you are tired let us go to paragraph 42 those big bright eyes looked up to me And she said, "Mr. Branham, &gt;&gt; I've always believed that something drove me to do these things that I don't want to do. It was a turning point. Going astray." So she was seeking deliverance. Praise the name of the Lord. And what brings us to church? to seek our victories, to seek our captivity that Lord, this is my weakness. Lord, this is where I'm bound. Lord, this is the weakness I have. So you come, Lord, I need your deliverance. Praise the name of our Lord. And so he said, I said, &gt;&gt; that's a demon. It's a devil power. He said, I've always believed it. So I said, "Pray again." You know, they took time praying. But these spirits are stubborn. And you may also have a stubborn spirit. But you don't give up and don't emulate that spirit and just rejoice over it. Don't be friends with it. It tells you go and do this. Don't do it. It tells you go and use that one. Don't do it. Whatever the demon forces you to do, you reject it. That's how it becomes powerless. So he said, "We will do pray." She got down and prayed. She looked over at me again. I prayed for her and laid hands on her. And so she stayed there a while and she looked back. She said, "Do you believe it is over?" I said, "Just keep on praying. Praise the name of God." You know when you know what you want, don't give up. Praise the name of the Lord. Keep pressing. Keep believing. Keep praying. Keep obeying. You know where you want to go. You know where you want to reach. Praise the name of our Lord. Well, she prayed a while longer. I was taking plenty of time with her just I got the case over till I got the case over and after a while she struck fire and when she did she raised up and them eyes had changed. She said something has happened. I said now it is over. You don't have to join nothing now. Praise the name of our Lord. She's got married and got children. No more drinking. Praise the name of her. She got her deliverance. She got her healing from all those kind of bondage of so many years wondering so many years. bound in many fest. Praise the name of our Lord. She was delivered. And we can also be delivered in whatever condition we are in. Whatever spirit that troubles, it doesn't matter what kind of spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. We can be delivered from that condition. It can be a habit which you are not pleased with. Praise the name of our Lord. We can be delivered from whatever condition it could be. Praise the name of our Lord. So now Satan works out in many ways to hold us in bondage, to trouble us, to hold us in things which are not pleasing. And you know wounding our spirit can come in different forms like this girl. It came because of you know the condition of rebellion. But then you can also be wounded in your spirit by your brothers persecuting you like David. His spirit was wounded when Saul was persecuting him. His spirit got wounded when Abselum took over. It can happen in any way. It can be a situation that can come in your life and then you get wounded. You become afflicted. You are held down. It can be an imagination. You know you imagine something and as you continue imagining that something you are bound. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So you can be held in a condition that is not good. But then how do we come out of those? Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message straight is the gate. [Music] Brother Brandham had a dream and when he had a dream he thought he was going to backslide because of what the dream was showing. So it can be something you interpret or you misunderstand the situation and then you take the wrong road. So he says, "Straight is the gate." And when I went into the front room and sat down for a while, it was about 3:30 in the morning. I got real sleepy. I went back. I laid down and I dreamt a dream. And it was most odd dream. And most of all of you know one of the managers Jakamoa. Most of you know the manager called Jakamoa. I have known him for years. I thought that I was about with a date, a girl about 17 years old. And I was taking her by the hand, leading her up the hill, little Jackie. Well, I know her since she was just a nursing baby. And I was leading up the hill. And I went three city blocks up the hill leading this girl and we come under a big tree. And she sat down and I look and I I like a lot of the young teenager girls today, you know, till she sat down and then she took the little skirt, kind of spread it and sit down. And as young frogs usually look like looking at each other, she folded her hands like this and begin to look towards the sky. Well, Jack is a very fine little girl. Then he said &gt;&gt; she looked towards the skies and now the reflection of the skies was in her eyes. Well, I went about 5 ft from her, kind of laid down sideways like this and got a straw and put it in my mouth and begin to chew on the straw like this. And I begin to think, what am I doing up here? Why me? an old man and this young girl. Why? I said, I'm married and I have a bunch of children and I don't want any business up here with this guy. And I started to raise up. And when I did, a voice came from the tree saying, "This is for a sign and for a cause." And I woke up and I almost screamed a nightmare. I thought I wonder if that means that I'm going to backslide or something happened to me. Now you can imagine brother I'm in this kind of condition. It's a dream. The things you're seeing are are not usual. You've gone to the hill holding a young girl's hand and then you are standing there and then she's looking at the sky. But why am I alone with her? Said maybe I'm going to backslide. Now if he would only take his own understanding, he would miss the purpose of that. So you get to misunderstanding some situations. Like sometimes husband and wife may misunderstand each other, children and parents may misunderstand or friends may misunderstand. But now what brother Brham did, he went and waited on the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he said, &gt;&gt; "I thought if I got to use my own mind, then I'll get all mixed up. So I'll just wait on God." Praise the name of our Lord. That's how we need to handle every in our commit to the Lord in prayer. Lord, there is this issue that has come Lord, there's this challenge that has come and then you pray over it. You wait on the Lord. He said, I started praying. I said, Lord, does this dream pertain does this dream pertain to the vision just the early part of the night? Oh, what does it mean? After waiting some time, maybe an hour, my wife was already up and ready had breakfast. Then the voice came back and said, "Go to Kingstone and you will be told what to do." Praise the name of Lord. He had to seek assurance. And that should be the same thing in our lives. Praise the name of our Lord. When an issue you don't understand, put it before the Lord in prayer. Like Rebecca, praise the name of our God. And even Isaac, when the wife was taken 20 years without producing, he presented the issue before the Lord. Lord, help us. And now when she conceived and then when Rebecca conceived there was struggle in her womb. &gt;&gt; Now she didn't go to a which doctor you know you try to discern what is this happening my businesses are collapsing. Oh you come and make some chams here things maybe will change. She waited on the Lord and then the Lord told her, "You are two nations in you." And this the same thing brother Brandham is doing. Learn to wait on the Lord. Praise the name of God. I know some of us. We are bound in his situation, but we don't have time to speak to the Lord. When you take time with God, it is budget time. But you in continuous bondage and then you want to budget for God one minute, five minutes. Even when you give him that time, it's not 100%. You are praying but the radio is on. So you are now trying to hear the news. Then you pray here, you turn, you just twisting like that. Like when you go to somebody's office, you are seated and he's listening to you. You receive a call. I'm here in the big man's office. You know that kind of condition. You're not giving him your time. you're not consecrating yourself, then how are you going to break some of these things? But you need time to consecrate. Lord, I'm here. Lord, I'm under this bondage. Lord, I'm under this torture. I need to be delivered out of this. Praise the name of our Lord. So, he waited on the Lord. And then the Lord told him, "Go to Kingstone." And then you'll be told what to do. And when he reached in Kingston, the vision became clear in paragraph 26. And the vision was the little church. The girl was a virgin. So the girl stood for a church, just a child. And that meant the virgin the virginity of the church. Three city blocks meant three days. I would minister and taking the little virgin church by my ministry from where she was on higher in the things of God until it shook the entire island. Praise the name of our Lord. And the Bible says, they that wait on the Lord, they shall renew their strength. Praise the name of our Lord. So it doesn't matter what kind of weakness you have. It doesn't matter how much you are wounded. Learn to wait on the Lord. No, this is the trouble I'm having. No, this is the captivity I'm in. And then you yourself You present it before the Lord. Lord, I desire to be delivered. Lord, I desire to be released from this kind of pain. Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes you can misunderstand things. Praise the name of our Lord. There was also another sister here in the message questions and answers of 1964. It's question 290. He says question, "Brother Brandham, what shall we do? Something has settled over me that I cannot break through. I dreamt. I was lost in white sand. It was getting dark. I couldn't find my way. This dream has stayed me with me ever since last fall. Now I am as one groping in darkness. Even and my wife were included in my dream. My son and my wife were included in the dream. Now they are also in darkness. We are in desperate. We are in desperation. I believe God will show you what it is in our hearts. Now if we are wrong or sinning, tell us we want to be right. Praise the name of the Lord. Just something comes and then the devil, he wants to get you, you know, mixed up. Praise the name of our Lord. And sometimes it can be different situation. You hear something which is not correct and then you become indifferent to the person. But you just had something wrong. And then you say, I'm told he talked about me. I'm told he doesn't want me for any good bondage. And now you think that by isolating yourself you are helping yourself or maybe you hear somebody has talked against you in church say I'm no longer coming to church. You are doing yourself more harm. Ah I don't want that church. Then you spend more money traveling long distances. If sometimes you borrow, if you don't have money, I'm going to be at home. I'm not coming to that church. But how many have talked about you? Are you coming to meet them or you're coming to meet God? And then you get yourself under captivity, bondage, bondage. And you know there's doors They will try to look for transfer very fast but that's not helping the solution. So there are sometimes we get misunderstanding, misinterpretations or you misunderstand and you make the wrong decision and then you get yourself more hurt, wounded, years of wondering. You become a wandering star. I'm no longer going to sing with those people. I'm no longer going to participate in anything. You are wounding yourself. So now Satan just knows how to manipulate uses your imagination and wants you puts you off. So he says, I don't know the lady but I just feel if you are here lady that here is your trouble. You have let something happened to you that made you navious. Sometimes we let these things come in our life. Maybe the way you responded to your wife or your husband and then something you find there's no peace there or how you handled a certain issue there's no peace there. So you let it take a hold of you and this what was happening to this sister. Then he says being in white sands now he's interpreting the dream represents purity and righteousness and you are just letting Satan put one over on you misinterpreting the situation so you take the wrong turn. you make the wrong decision. Satan taking a hold of you. So he says your dream proved that there is nothing wrong. You are only navvious and by doing this and thinking this you are making the rest of your family navious. Now you can imagine it starts from one person and then you share your fears the imaginations and then everybody takes a hold and now that demon the devil has used to speak those things takes a hold of the whole family. So you find a darkness is coming also. But how did it come from one person misunderstanding the situation? So then he says stop doing it. Claim your godgiven right. Your dream proves the interpretation that you are in white sand. Everything is right. It's you yourself navious and you let one member the family get nervous. It goes the next member and the next member and the first thing you know you are all fussing and going on and one member family gets kind of upset about something. It upsets the other and the other and the other and the thing you know the whole family is upset that is Satan. Then if one member family member rejoices let the rest of them rejoice. So every one of the family try to do that. Try each one of you children to help your papa mama mama papa. You try to help your children. Don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit get around you. You are Christians. You are born of the spirit of God. You are the salt of the earth. You have God-given rights. And the Bible said, if there be any praise, if there be any virtue, think on these things. Don't think about the wrong thing. Praise the name of God. That should help us. Not imagine something wrong and then the wrong thing you have imagined, you are telling this one, telling the other one, telling the other one. At the end of the day, Satan has taken a hold of all captivity. Praise the name of our Lord. But we just need to see that we take our Godgiven right. Praise the name of our what the Lord has promised us and then we take that and make good use of it. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, Satan &gt;&gt; uses many things to hurt us, &gt;&gt; to take us off the right track, &gt;&gt; to mislead us, Satan &gt;&gt; desired. Praise the name of our Lord, like Jesus told Peter that Satan has desired to sift you. He desire to sift you. like wheat. He pushes you this way, then this way, then this way, and you have no peace. You have no rest. What did Jesus tell Peter? But I have prayed for you. Praise the name of our Lord. That's why we need to pray for one another. We are living in a neuroretic age. We need to keep each other in prayer. We need to be concerned about one another. What's my brother going through? What's my sister going through? You know, this one doesn't have a job. See, can he get a job? How can he be helped in this country? Praise the name of our Lord. So, Satan desire to do harm to Job. And now the Bible says in the book of Job chapter one and then verse one. There was a man in the land of wolves whose name was Job. And the man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and estued evil. And there was born unto him seven sons and three daughters. His substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 y of oxen and 500 she ashes and very great household. So that this man was the greatest of all men of the east. Now Job did so well. The family was okay. The children are there. The wealth is there. the great honor in the village or in the country. Then the devil say I need to access this one here. &gt;&gt; Started you know that kind of false accusation and you know the devil is a false accuser. So we shouldn't be false accusers. The Bible says don't react over an issue before you hear it. So the devil chooses Job. Then Satan was telling God that man because you've blessed him. That's why he worships you. That's why he does this kind of now. We shouldn't have the same mind of Satan. I come to church because I'm okay. Come to church even when things are hard. Praise the name of God. Even when your prayer is taking long to be answered, just keep on coming. You know, so Satan &gt;&gt; was given permission to go and destroy whatever Job had. He killed the seven sons, the three daughters in one day. Then he went and destroyed all the animals he had. And Job was getting all these reports. They were telling him this has happened. This has happened. This has happened. This has happened. Job was wounded. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. No more person to call you father. No more wealth. Nothing completely. Wounded spirit. But what did Job say? Job just worshiped God. Lord, whatever I had came from you. It has gone back to you. &gt;&gt; Glory be to your name. Praise the name of our Lord. That should be our stand. Not to take the name of the Lord in vain. You know, trying to accuse God over this, trying to blame God over this, trying to say all these problems. It's because of the church I go to, all these problems. No. Praise the name of our Lord. Be like Job. Just rejoice before the Lord and say, Lord, I thank you for everything. Glory be to your holiness. Now, the devil, he was irritated by that. You know, because the devil wants to do this for you to go away from God. But Job never allowed Satan to use him. And that should be the same thing with us. Don't allow Satan to use him. Don't allow Satan to make you responsible for the failure of your family. And every trouble it is the husband. Every trouble it's the wife. Every trouble it's the father. Every father it's the mother. Don't be the one responsible. [Music] See that you do everything to the best of what you know living upright before God. So now when Satan failed that He said now he's life. And so Satan was given opportunity. And then he went to Job in Job 2:7. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord Job with boils from the sole of his feet unto the crown. [Music] and he took a port share to scrap himself with and he sat upon the ashes. Now see the condition of Job. He has lost everything. Even now his health everywhere is itching and painful that his fingers the nails could not soo them. He got just you know a broken pot started scratching his to get some relief. Satan getting him in that condition, wounding him until his wife came to him and said unto him, "Do you still retain your integrity? Trust God and die, wounded, afflicted." What did Job do? But he said unto her, verse 10, &gt;&gt; thus speaketh as one of the foolish women, &gt;&gt; what shall we receive good at the hand of God and not receive evil in all this job sin not with his lips? Praise the name of our Lord. He held his integrity. And that's how you need to learn that in every situation I shouldn't take the name of the Lord in vain. But I should learn to say Lord I thank you even when I've taken a year without a job. Lord I thank you that you are keeping me. Praise the name of our Lord. Lord I thank you. Even I've taken maybe 10 years. or five years, whatever duration you've waited for and seems nothing is happening, say, "Lord, I thank you that you have kept me. You provided for me. You fought my battle. You brought me this far." Praise the name of our Lord. You're not serving God because of circumstances. You're not serving God because of benefit, but your heart loves God. Praise the name of the Lord. And you say there is nothing between me and my God. Praise the name of our Lord. Whether they have not added my salary or the landlord has increased the rent. Praise the name of our Lord or whatever situation it is. My business is not doing well. My farm is not doing well. My my my every investment is down. Lord, I thank you. Praise the name of our Lord. That was Job. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Say, "Lord, I thank you. He never sinned before God." You know, whatever he went through during that time, his heart was still depending upon God. Praise the name of our Lord. That's how we need to live. Wherever much you've been wounded, however much you've been hurt, see that you hold the name of the Lord. You know, the Bible told us in Proverbs 18:10 that the name of the Lord is a strong tower. Praise the name of Lord. So when you are wounded, what do you do? Run into that strong tower. Praise the name of Lord. And then you get comfort there. You get consolation there. You know, maybe you are confused with things there. You don't know how to go about things. The Bible says the name of the Lord is a strong and mighty town and the righteous run into it. Praise the name of Lord. You run there. Say, Lord, I'm looking for my safety. Lord, I'm looking for my deliverance. That's how Job was handling things. Lord, I'm here. I cannot turn either side. You are my only hope. Praise the name of the Lord because you know the end from the beginning. He found comfort in the Lord. And while Job was going through the things, his friends spoke bad about him. Now you can imagine the situation of Job. You are wounded. Your family is no more. You can't have fellowship with your wife. He says, "Why don't you cast God? The children are dead. Even the close friends are speaking against you. The wealth everything is gone." So in Job chapter 19 and then verse 1 to verse three, then Job answered and said, "How long will you vex my soul and break me in pieces with words? [Applause] These 10 times have you reproached me. You are not ashamed that you make yourself strange to me. Now you can imagine you are under this affliction. You under this affliction even your friends you made a mistake. You are the one. You are a secret sinner. Afflicted and sometimes those words can afflict you. You get troubled. You don't know which way to turn. Praise the name of our Lord. But you just need to look to the Lord and say Lord help me in this kind of praise the name of our Lord. Now it is very interesting that the very friends who are talking against Job, God told Job, you pray for them. Praise the name of our Lord. And those are the solutions. They have done bad to you. The solution is forgive them. That's what the Bible say. Now those are things the devil doesn't want you to do for I don't have things to pray for but God says pray for them. Praise the name of our let us go to Matthew chapter 5 and then verse 43. We are looking for the healing of our wounded spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Job needed healing. So the Bible says in Matthew chapter 5 and then verse 43, you have heard that it has been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you, that you may be the children of your father, which is in heaven. For he maketh his son to rise upon the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. Now he said okay this is what you are used to doing under normal circumstance you're not attracted to a bad person but he said now when you come to Love your enemies. Those who exploit you. You've taken a whole month. That man has cheated your salary. The landlord is chasing you. Your children have been chased away from school. Then he says, "Pray for them and praying not to c them. Lord, may all his business come down. says, "Pray for them. Wish them good." That's how we are healed. Praise the name of our Lord. He said, "Pray for them. Those who despitefully use you. Bless them. Don't c them." And that makes the difference. Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us go to Mark 11 and then verse 22. Mark 11 and then verse 22. The Bible says Jesus answering said unto them, have faith in God. For ver I say unto you, that soever shall say unto the mountain, be thou removed, and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, you shall have whatever he saith. Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them. And when you pray, forgive if you have ought against any, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. If you don't forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. Praise the name of the Lord. That's our healing. You want God to hear your prayers. He says, "Forgive." You want God to hear your prayers. He says, "Pray for them." You want God to hear your prayers. He says, "Forgive your enemies. Have no grudge against anybody." And then we need to learn as children of God, not have anything evil in your heart against anybody. Cuz the Bible says, "If possible, live at peace with everybody. Let them have issues against you. Don't have issues against. That's how you are released. That's how you are delivered. Don't take issues against people all the time. You know there are some people who always seek trouble for others but you shouldn't be like that. The Bible says blessed are the peacemakers be a peacemaker at home be a peacemaker not a person who preaches strife when this trying to reconcile the one trying to put a wedge between them. No, we need to be children of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go back to Matthew chapter 5. He says, &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5 and then we read in verse 7, &gt;&gt; blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. That's what we are called to be. And Job, God told Job or he told his friends who were talking against him in Job chapter 42, praise the name of our Lord. Job chapter 42 and then verse 7 up to verse 10. And it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said unto Eleph the Temonite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against thy friends, for you have not spoken of of me the thing which is right, as my servant Job has done. Never never know. Now you can imagine when these people were talking to Job, they were choosing Job. Job, you did this. God cannot do this kind of thing any way it is you think God can do that as they were talking against Job God says you have talked against me it is me you have spoken about it you are choosing then he told them &gt;&gt; go to Job therefore take unto you now seven bulocks and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. And my servant Job shall pray for you. For him will I accept, lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job. [Music] Praise the name of the Lord. He's telling them go to Job offer your sacrifices and then after that he will pray for you. But they talked about Job. They looked at him as a bad person. And then Job was not in a good condition at all. But then God said, "Go to him. He knows how to handle his afflictions. Praise the name of our Lord. is not going to accuse everybody. You know there are people now to choose this one. And then you bring a wedge. The fathers are choosing the children. The children are choosing the mother. The mothers are choosing the the children. The wives are choosing the husband. Husbands are choosing Where is forgiveness there? How do you pray for them when you're choosing them? Maybe you're going to choose them before God. I want these children to know that I'm their father, their mother. No, forgive. Praise the name of Allah and pray for them for the good. You know, they are parents who now to c their children. this child doesn't understand. You are condemning him to that condition. But bless as a parent, praise the name of our Lord. Bless your children, bless your family. Don't curse. Praise the name of our Lord. But you can bless. You know God was telling Job your friend are in trouble but I want you to bless them because we are called to bless like marriage. When the whole country was sick said go to Abraham my prophet prays for you. What is it? God desires to bless us. God desires to deliver us. out of whatever captivity we are in out of whatever situation we are in. So now they had to go to Job. So &gt;&gt; and build that and Zora they went and did according to the commandment of God. And the Bible says the Lord accepted Job. God would want to hear your prayer for your enemies. Praise the name of Lord. He wants to hear your prayers for your enemies. And out of a true heart, he wants you forgiving your enemies. If you have issues against your husband or against your wife, God wants you to forgive them or your children or your parents. You have just issues of ages. God wants you to forgive. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. I'm not taking issues and saying no. This is the one you need to overcome the captivity. So now when Job prayed for them, the Bible says in verse 10, "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. Praise the name of the Lord. You want your captivity to be turned away. Pray for your enemies. Forgive your enemies. That's what Job was being told. Pray for them in praying for them. Then the Lord releases you also. Praise the name of our Lord. He released Job's captivity. So Job had to have a pure heart. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's the same thing. He said when you start praying, you want God to help you in this area, you want God to deliver you in this kind of situation. He said when you pray, forgive. There's no negotiation about that. Because if you don't forgive, he will not hear your prayers, you're not going to be healed. But if you want to be healed, the healing of your spirit, forgive. Praise the name of our Lord and don't take issues against. Forgive, pray for them. And that's what Job did. He prayed for his friend. He prayed for his wife. Praise the name of our Lord. And then the Bible says God gave Job twice as much as he had. He released him from his captivity. Praise the name of Lord. And so God desires to release every one of us out of our broken spirit, broken heart. Praise the name of our Lord. He wants to release each and every one of us. And say, Lord, I need to be helped. And you don't allow the devil to deceive you, but just say, Lord, here I am. Praise the name of our Lord. As I finish, &gt;&gt; let us go to to the book of Jeremiah, chapter 29. And then verse 12, &gt;&gt; he says, &gt;&gt; "Then shall you call upon me, and you shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you." He says, "You call upon me." We've been looking at how you call upon the Lord. said, "You pray unto me. You hear what I'm telling you and you shall seek me and you shall find me when you shall search me with all your heart and I will be found of you, says the Lord, and I will turn away all your captivity. And I will gather you from all those nations and from all the places whether I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will bring you again into the place where I caused you to be carried away captive. Verse 14. Verse 14. Praise the name of the Lord. He says, "I will set you free from every condition and then restore you back." &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. We need the healing of our spirit. We need our victories. We need our deliverances. If you have something against somebody, take it off your heart. Praise the name of our Lord. Be free with God. God will not hear you. Because that's what the Bible says. When you come to offer sacrifice and you remember you have ought against anybody, make it right. Don't pretend about it because you're not going to be set free. But you need to be released. Praise the name of our Lord. Take envy out of your heart. Take hatred out of your heart. take any kind of evil spirit out of your heart and say, "Lord, here I am. I need your deliverance. I need to be released from captivity. Praise the name of our Lord." Now, in the message, hearing and receiving. He says, "Inspire your servants, the ministers, our gracious and precious brothers, the shepherds of the floor that you are that have called out and set apart, dedicated lives to the service. We pray for them Lord for they are the men who carry these the inkeepers that will take these sick people of soul and body and keep pouring oil and wine until they are well. It is said in the parable that he gave them two pens. The one there was for both salvation and healing. And he said, "If there is anything more, I'll come and give it again." You know, the that man who was beaten, good for the dead, they had to take him to the inn. And the inn is the church. Praise the name of our Lord. That great physician is here to heal us of our broken hearts, our broken spirit, our troubled soul. That's why we are here. I said there are two pens salvation and healing oil and the wine to revive us to bring us back. Praise the name of Lord. Then he said the word and the spirit they are both here for what? For our deliverance to be released from any form of captivity that way. Praise the name of our Lord. So then you have to take it. It is the bomb in Gilead. [Music] And so if the doctor gives you medicine and you don't take the medicine, then you can't be better, but we are here to receive the healing of our body. We are here to receive the healing of our spirit. We're here to receive the healing of our souls. Praise the name of our Lord. So you take it and say, Lord, help me. Praise the name of our Lord. Lord, deliver me out of this trap. Lord, deliver me out of this spirit. Deliver me out of this habit. Praise the name of the Lord. May God bless you. Amen. Let us sing that song, cast your burdens. Praise the name of our Lord. And let us all cast our burdens to the Lord unreservedly. Praise the name of our Lord. Cast all your burdens. Cast all your cares and Say, "Lord, help me. Lord, deliver me. Lord, heal me. Lord, set me free." &gt;&gt; Praise the name of God. &gt;&gt; Cast your burden unto Jesus, for he cares for you. Ask your bing and to Jesus for he cares for you.
