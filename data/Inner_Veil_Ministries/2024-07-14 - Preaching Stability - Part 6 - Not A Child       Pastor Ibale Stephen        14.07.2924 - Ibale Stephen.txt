to Father we pray that you may be present and speak to us from your word teach our hearts 75 hide your word in our hearts and cause it father to come to life and bring forth fruit in Jesus name amen amen amen do you love him amen we shall go straight to the word of God Amen we shall go to the Book of Luke Chapter 2 and verse 52 amen and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man may the Lord bless in the reading of his word we may be seated amen am so the title today is preaching stability part and the emphasis is not a child Amen brother Bram says in the message Faith once delivered the Saints you are the same yesterday today and forever the Christ that lived in the body called Jesus is the same logos tonight that lives in the body of the church performing the same things living the same ways loving the same ways and doing the same things The Same Spirit producing the same things the same Jesus yesterday today and forever amen so we have the same spirit in us that was in Christ Jesus we as the church we are the body of that Christ so when Christ was born in flesh the scripture shows us that he grew in three phases he grew in wisdom he grew in St and also in favor with God and then men so when he was born in the moral flesh he was certainly governed by the elements that control the body of Flesh he could get emotional and cry he could you know visibly re reveal when he was hungry amen the devil saw he was hungry and wanted to capitalize on that condition you know the pressure of the ministry beat down his body and his body went you know forward it went forward 17 years and when they saw him they said you are a man not 50 years and you say you know before Jesus was you were he was also threatened by death so all the elements that governed the human flesh also governed the body of Christ he was born into the veil of Flesh and Paul says but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death that's why he came in this flesh so that he could suffer death the penal of sin that you can live so and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so now we see just the coming forth of a man and so he kept increas in wisdom and in St so in wisdom God kept revealing amen certain revelations in season as it was needed for the son amen and you know I want to remind you one thing which I've told you a few times here that gra I mean growth is a very interesting because you keep learning and as you learn you drop amen you learn this and then you drop sometimes you come to what you learn again you drop it a second time just that's what growth is growth is not an instant leap into destination it's an evolution from one glory to another glory and yet the glory after that is greater than the glory before amen you see we grow into those phases just as become a Christian justification itself is a glory you rejoice deeply in your life but then you find that again when sanctification comes is a greater glory than justification and when the B of the Holy Ghost comes a more greater glory so growth is going from glory to glory and looking back at the children where they are growing they celebrate every level amen of their growth when they start finding out they can craw they celebrate that level and they keep wanting to go when they stand they celebrate that all the time they want to stand are you together with me and when they discover they can walk they want walk all over the place amen and when they discover they can run they want to run all over the place so you know uh they celebrate every station they get to but they don't station in that station they keep growing up so as sons of God we understand and celebrate every growth but yet at the same time we must keep our eyes on the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus knowing that there is more that God is going to give amen we've got a God who keeps revealing his attributes day after day even when we erupt even when we get back home Amen in the New Jerusalem God will always be revealing himself in greater things praise the Lord so now listen at this different children may be born at the same time and also fed on the same food their level of growth is not uniform are you together with me it's exactly the same thing even in the church that you find people who are born in a similar season their growth is not the same and so is the form amen you can s Cor in the same day and then on the same plant you find this C is ready and this one is not your ready are you together with me so you know con was planted the same day but it's not being harvested on the so we need to appreciate the change God takes us through however small it is and however slow it is if it is a chance Le to appreciate God for amen and keep pushing the battle trusting that if this little Chang has come there is more that God is going to bring brother Bram speaks about a colored sister that he met in a meeting she said I want you all to know one thing I'm not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but there is one thing sure I'm not what I used to be hallelujah hallelujah so for every little change in your Christian Life you need to learn to appreciate it because that's God and it's a sign that you can be able to grow and I know some of you mothers when you are mother for the first time and you have got a baby and the baby took a step for the first time most of the mothers clap their hands and they get very excited they know there is a growth taking place so growth natural or [Music] spiritual is a mystery in itself you cannot let a finger on Gross whether it is spiritual or natural if you put your corn in the field you cannot wake up and say that I want to see when this corn is growing you will look at it from day tonight you will not testify of the growth but that core is growing amen that's true so you know we cannot put a finger on our spiritual growth but the truth of the matter is that we are growing anyhow hallelujah hallelujah amen and so spiritual growth which cannot be computed in years amen a person may be in church for about 4 [Music] but he still a child so the spiritual growth is not computed in how many years we've been in the church the spiritual growth is measured by the depth of the Life of Christ manifested in an individual amen spiritual growth is measured by by one being seasoned amen seasoned seasoned uh is not eratic eratic is somebody [Music] okay is not amen so this person here amen his spiritual growth this man is measured by the form of training of the word he has taken you know to be reflected that he's not an novice to show that he's [Music] reliable because of experience and long standing proof of the Christian experience so the mystery of growth comes by [Music] laying under the [Music] malach and then you are feeding on that word and as you feed on that word it Seasons you amen praise Lord and once you take the seeds of the message of the hour and you place them in your heart and provide them the atmosphere that the seed requires to grow that seed will grow and that seed will bring forth life amen so the word is a seed that is s souls and a seed if it's a dramatized seed and it goes into the ground then that seed under the right conditions of the Sun an atmosphere will bring forth the life that is in the sea and so is the word of God if a person can take that word and place it in their heart and give it the right sunshine the right temperature not s n but s o [Music] n and right temperature faith that and promise we live amen praise the Lord and begin the one before him praise the Lord I see let's get to Mark chapter 4 on verse 26 amen the word we preach here is a SE just saw it in your heart and give it the right atmosphere keep praying about it keep talking about it if you can sing sing about it that where you are watering the sea amen with your faith so Mark 4 ver 26 and he say so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground not the kingdom of heaven but rather the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is Christ in you the hope of glory that indwelling spirit is the kingdom of God in you are you together with me amen with the Holy Spirit in you you are in the Kingdom so is the kingdom of God as if a man should s a sea amen and verse 27 and should sleep and Rise night and day and the seity should spring up and grow up he knoweth not how amen you cannot keep track the rate of growth of the seed much as it's growing you cannot recognize the rate at which that seed is growing I want to stand before you this morning and tell you you are all growing amen I've got a testimony you are not what you used to be much as you are not what you want to be that's a true testimony that there is a growth going on in your amen and by the way on Sunday next Sunday we've got a minister from Zambia who is going to speak here amen so let us be here and feed from the word of God Amen so he says in verse 28 for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself there now you know Jesus is explaining grow he says that the Earth bringeth forth of herself first the blade then the after that the full in the so then it goes through potential stages amen it brings forth the first blade and that first blade is potentially the seed amen if you lose it at that stage you cannot get the seed amen so the seed goes through potential [Music] stages and why all these stages are celebrated by The [Music] Farmer they are not sea amen but they are just stages of the growth of the sea amen we are very happy this morning to see sister Florence here amen some of you may not know let us stand up Sister [Applause] Florence ah praise the Lord those are the but with age she used to walk about 15 km to come to church but she can't do it anymore one time they brought a not here that she is going to face surgery and you know when you are coming here to minister your mind is wrapped up in what you are going to say and I didn't want anything to take my mind I just say father before the doctor touches her let that thing disappear and just as the doctor came started looking for that human it was not there and the doctor I mean she said give me a note that this thing has disappeared and he says no but I'll operate you sometime to the best of my knowledge she has not been operated up to now amen so we appreciate our sister being with us again amen so you know the seed goes through stages for it to bring back the nature of its par hallelujah hallelujah amen so what are you growing towards you are growing towards the nature of your parent that's what we call the stat of the perfect that is our parent that's what we are growing are you together with me this is what brother Bram said in the quot here amen that the Christ that lived in the body called Jesus is the same logos tonight that lives in the body of the church are you together with me even the body called Jesus he grew through phases to manifest the father even in the church he grow through phases to man The Father amen so that's the mark of the high calling in Christ amen verse 28 he says for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of our first the blade then the ear after that full Conn in the ear it's going through phases then it goes through a potential stage while all these stages are celebrated by the farmer they are not the sea but is looking forward to the High Calling which is the manifestation of the par she that put in the ground amen verse 29 but when the fruit is brought forth immediately put forth the SE because the sea because the Harvest is come amen so the testimony of Christ in you will have to develop gradually until you bear The Life of Christ himself so in these bodies of growth I mean of Flesh we grow as we also grow in spiritual fields we are not children anymore not a child are you together with me not a child that being the title today there's no par that be happy of having a child that doesn't grow he will remain a little kid he remain doing child [Music] things he cannot support himself he needs the support of the father of the time there's no parent who want see a child like that we want to see our children go through an evolution from one glory to another Glory everything with life grows and growth in itself is like a journey when you are taking a journey maybe you are going TOA while you are going to Nairobi you don't keep seeing this same building the time the is changed amen here you are in a vol you in a hill down there you are taking turn so we grow through changing experiences it's just like us ministers also our Ministries grow if I sound like what I was 10 years ago you are going to ask what is happening with our because a Ministry is supposed to grow a gift must grow amen it's like this song leaders they are also ministers by song Amen they also have to pray and say heavenly father help my gift to grow amen so basically in the age we've got the example of brother BR he was a minister that grow amen the prophet grow in the ministry just like a Christ are you together with amen you know Christ grew in wisdom and St there are certain things that he could say but not even the son knows amen he says not even the son knows amen about the coming now what does that mean it means that the fact that he wanted the to the the disciples were asking for it was not for their season so God could not release it to him there were certain things that brother Bram said and then later in his ministry he said something different that is a sign that a Ministry grows it grows in Revelation grows in understanding it grows in compassion amen so you know the growth of any living organism living orm is a multiplication of Cs and this cells here keep taking a nature that has got the capacity to support that organism at a certain level of life amen and when you are a human being even your brain cells change it keeps growing you begin to think different because your mind has to support the of your body amen so on this principle even our Ministries grow speaking about the ministry of Christ brother Bram said but as soon as Jesus begin to tell them the truth about the gospel what happened the servant went away the others went away and Jesus popularity Contin to fail until finally they crucified him but his ministry R deeper and deeper and it lasted now some of the people could confuse the fame with the ministry you see a Ministry at a particular time could be handling a level which makes it popular because he handling what the people want amen but Jesus rose a level higher and took the people into the world are you together with me and he says eat of My Flesh drink of my blood and the people could not catch that level the people were used to the level pick up your bed and go rise and walk and everybody why because super things were happen but he now took them to a different level where they required Revelation and submission the people who followed him started walking away the seven walked away he had come to a level of the depth of the ministry brother Brenham says the minister kept growing deeper and deeper the popularity [Applause] [Music] fa because he was now dealing with issues of life so and speaking of the changing of his own Ministry brother Bram called the last change the stage of my Ministry meaning that the ministry had gone through phases in the last pH he was asking God to allow him to dress the bride with the Govern of the world are you together with me yeah not those massive Crusades so the growth here is like the pyramid it is wide at the bottom but as the person grows higher and higher there are so many things that follow that's how the church grows it doesn't grow into majority it grows into the minority and when I'm talking about the church I'm not talking about this local church here I'm talking about the body of Christ amen it grows into the minority not little flock for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen so life grows through stages just like our Ministries grow rest bram's Ministry R through three phases Amen in the anointed onean time he said the first pool healing second pool prophesying third pool the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed are you together with me so now it grew through three phases and all these phases was to pull the elect of the season to bring him in into the flock so now that gift with there when it was ministered it was exercised it was not a show it was to pull the people and so the three phrases he called them three pools he said the first pool was the healing of the people and the people were so excited they were happy with the pool and then the second pool was prophesying telling the secrets of the people's heart and then the third po was the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed Hallelujah so these pools existed in the ministry of Christ too just as they did in the ministry of brother BR and at one time brother Bram say pools exist in every Ministry so now praise the Lord no the first pool deal with the condition of the flesh healing and mes would come you are healed in Jesus name and they would go excited take up your bed and go they would get excited that was the ministry of brother brother people threw crutches and they walked off their wheelchairs some of them were resurrected from the dead but those were tempor side because the people died again are you together with me and that would make a man very popular the second po dealt with the condition of the human Spirit and the prophet called it prophesy amen yeah you know he would tell what was on the inside of a p where the person come from how many doctors you seen amen and at one time he says if I had to say everything that I see some of the people would end up in jail he was looking into the human Spirit of the people people whereing sin is brewed amen praise the lord it's brewed like a brew in there amen so now he was looking into there and now the third po it dealt with the soul [Music] the opening of the world Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the Mysteries being revealed to unveil the Christ which was hidden in the world hallelujah hallelujah and this was specifically to the elect are you together with me all the others the first pool and the second pool was to everybody but the third was God dealing with the seed gen of a man he was dealing with ear he that has an ear amen so he was speaking the word to he that had done that was the third po the revealing of Christ Amen brother Bram says here Christ the Myster of God revealed he says look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride it's the same God God in his body was Christ and Christ in his body is the church oh my God what manifest God made manifest in Christ and Christ made manifest in the blood and as God from the body of Adam and took uh from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God was to take from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bright out that won't fall by Creed or denomination but she's coming back with the pure anded word of God being manifested are you together with me so this last pull here is not popularity it's not people taking the sick amen even if when they bring them they can be healed but the purpose God is looking for your soul this is the pool it deals with the word the raling of Christ which is the MST of God revealed praise God so we learn from John 5 of the man at the well of Bethesda who was weak in his limbs amen for 38 years the first pull was the healing of his body amen then Christ moved on to tell him see no more that was the second pool dealing with the human spirit then asked they him the people now what man is that which said unto thee that take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed was not who it was for Jesus had conveyed himself away IM being in that place after where Jesus finds him in the temple and said him behold Thou made see no more L the worst thing come unto thee the man departed and told the Jews it was Jesus which made me so in this particular aspect here we see the first pool we see the second pool and we see the third pool are you together with me amen the first is the healing of the body the outer and the second now is the human Spirit which is the middle C S no more but then the final C is when Jesus revealed himself to him are you together with me so every oncoming pool was a stage higher than the previous with God working himself towards the center of human life works from the outside so he enters into the outer cor of your flesh that's where signs and wonders then he goes into the middle that's Christ the high priest that's where the ceremonies were done and then finally he goes into the holy of hly taking the blood on the altar hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah until the blood has been applied to your soul amen from body to human Spirit human Spirit to the soul God perfected in threes listen just like God living in the three courts he sure lives in the court of the congregation amen which is the outer Court he also lives here to the ho place but his Abiding Place this was just attributes of his presence from the holiest of holiest amen you see now listen all these different worshipers met God at different levels because they all went to the Tabernacle there was the outer Court when the priest goes in they experience that presence he goes into the middle place the experiences what presence are you together with me so we as we come together as a local church and the presence comes down everybody will experience God at a certain level you cannot come to church and you go back [Music] and understand amen so now you must Express his presence by your body Soul and Spirit God being perfected in thre amen so when the first pool was manifested in the ministry of Christ it was Healing The Sick it not requireed to go away for the second one to come the first pool did not require to go away the second one to come the second the first was there and the second pool came and while the second pool was there the third pool came so all these three pools leaving the church today the one who needs healing God is here to heal the one who needs the healing of the human Spirit God is here preaching to your human spirit amen and for those who want to catch life hallelujah hallelujah he is also here to baptize Every Soul that seeks to have him amen oh praise God let's go to this quot here he says watch three watch three everything in the Bible is three three blanks to one father son Holy Spirit not three Gods one faith hope and [Music] charity not three different things but all the essence of one do you love him you see I want you to see how these threes still work in one amen he says faith help charity not three different things but all the essence of one love now then there was justification Bas of the Holy Ghost not three different dispensation not three works of Grace but one work in three different manifestations same Holy Spirit was with Luther under justification was under wle with sanctification in the church now in the B of the Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit not two Holy Spirits not three Holy Spirits Same Spirit are you together with me amen so now that's why the first pool does not have to go away for the second pool to come because it was one God pulling at different levels he has to be here to keep pulling at different levels because we still have some people that can understand by the first pool we still have people that can only understand by the second pool when you preach to condemn sin we still have them here we also have people that can pull by the revelation of Christ amen that's the same way these three pools work the work of Luther did not die away from the church for the work of Wesley to come but rather Wesley became a higher order of the same God and when Pentecost came it was just God lifting the church to a higher order that the same God that's the growth of the ministry are you together with me when you did with the blade you know when the cor is coming up there's no way you can have the so the life in the plant keeps posting on until all the stages packed back in the sea and if you plant the seed back it will do the same thing all those pools are a part of the maturity of the SE are you together with me the third pool therefore is not a Doctrine but rather the coming forth of the person of Jesus Christ in manifestation is the opening of the word when we sing of the world we are not basically talking about doctr but we are talking about Christ coming forth the manifestation in the beginning was the word amen do you love him the first pull is when he healed the second pool is when he convicted men of sin in order to killing the human Spirit the third pool he proves himself as the voice of the word that rested in the holy of holies amen the third pool has now being Vindicated brother Bram uses those words in the message Look Away to Jesus and many people attribute the the third po they only put the teaching so they say from 1963 that was the third po but all the things that is spoke about to vindicate the third P were done before 196 it is the same God he was just crossing his own borders the same one who justifies amen he sanctifies you and fills with the Holy Ghost but when you sin again doesn't mean you cannot be Sanctified anymore Hees his borders as a whale are you together with me you know the three I mean the the three son names Son of God Amen we had him first a son of man when came in the Jesus body and then when he died he manifested the office of Son of God because the blood was now available to cleanse the people Son of God the sacrifice of sin but then afterwards before he comes a son of man I mean a son of David to become king he comes again a son of man to fulfill St Luke 173 and so many people say you see today he son of man yes but he crosses his borders as he will because today he still forgives sin is the Son of God we are still baptizing are you together with me God crosses his borders amen now remember there will never be an impersonation of that third po because it can't be he says it cannot beated because it will be a manifestation of Christ himself walking from the side of a [Applause] Believer if it's just doctr it can be passionated but since it's the word bringing forth his own life it cannot be personated the opening of the word is the opening of The Working of Christ on the side of his own bride amen okay not a child let's go to First Corinthians 13 we identify the subject he says in 1 Corinthians 1311 when I was a child meaning that I'm grown not a child are you together with me not a child and that's the desire of every patient I want to be like Jesus to grow in wisdom and Stat and also in favor with man Paul is testifying on when I was a child Paul is saying I'm not a child when I was a child I SP as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away child's feel when I was not when I am amen so this is a powerful concept when it comes to grow a young child understands as a child and it speaks with the authority of the child's knowledge he and then he serious he wants you to understand he speaks as a child but he wants communication when I was a child I understood as a child and I spoke as a child a child can insist on error and this is applicable to in spiritual reference a child can completely insist in error in the spiritual field and I told you that a child is not the many years youve spent in church are you together with me a child amen is somebody that has not evolved amen amen he says when I was a child I spoke as a child it affected Paul he's saying I was at one time a child it affected Peter he was trying to insist in circumcision he was a child so knowing the spiritual maturity is not necessarily a chronological age we have got [Music] seniors in the church that can speak like a child they'll be so sincere they'll be so sincere because that s they can go you see I thought as a child there was a level of maturity that control his manifestations he would do things because he's alive on side but at a particular level when I was a child there is a way I looked at the ministry and some of the people talk to you about the ministry with the sincerity of the child the way the way I looked at the Brotherhood saying that oh If This one belongs to my group of Brethren that's the brother when I was still a child I thought that I could cont the regions where Christ works from that's when I was a child I could draw zones I could that one is not a brother he doesn't dress like us that one is not a brother he doesn't come to a convention that one is not a brother when I was a child I thought as a child I dressed as a child praise the Lord amen I Associated as a child so that's why we should keep fixing our eyes on the mark of the ey calling in Christ Jesus we have come to this level it is okay it's the Life of Christ but I need to go to another level and when I get on this one I should not make it a station as long as there is a life to walk into let us keep walking [Applause] up amen amen oh there is an image to into the of a perfect Amen brother Bram he was a maturity Above the Rest of the ministry he was two Wilds apart from him and the others you know he used to see things from the spirit world they used to see things for a natural interpretation you know he s the Fallen Roman Catholic church amen as the Fallen system saw he saw the Fallen Roman Catholic Church as the system that the Antichrist would use but the rest of them were just analysts they look at communism that was against church and they said that's the Antichrist they were kids they spoke as children are you together with me but when I became a man he says that I put away Child Things maturity looks Way Beyond the child's mind and the worst problem you'll have in church is the young man spiritually amen am trying to understand spiritual [Music] things and trying to put your authority over the things that you have not grown into Yet brother Bram said I don't remember the quote very well but when they chose a certain young man to be a judge at a very low age is necessary to grow are you together with me I was very surprised when they were swearing in MPS in the UK 22 years 24 years 25 years I said God what experience are they bringing to the parliament are you together with me and that's why also Parliament has gone that way the young men just jump out of University I'm going to the Parliament and there you go Jesus could not start his ministry until he had grown in wisdom and are you together with me maturity looks Way [Applause] Beyond so like yesterday we're dealing with the subject desire the sincere mil of the word which you are going to grow back feed on the word pick on sincere vitam of the world spiritual muscle amen because when God was recommending the office in church he says not so somebody must be mature in the word wisdom and listen to the advice of Pauli 2 verse and as he have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord walk in him not only walking in him verse seven rooted and built up in him are you together with me you are rooted in him you are not a baby you know baby who needs to be B and then you rock him [Music] and no that's not how God works he needs your maturity when the servant walked away he did not say what shall I do without the 12 he will also go away are you together with me yes when Elijah found Elisha and then elishah said let me go and build my people I want to go with you he was always asking what have I done to you then he says as my go your God lives I'm not going to let you go I you El amen he could not give up he gets in g girl why don't you stay here he said no I'm coming along with you they get to the Crossing Jordan why don't you stay here I'm going with you what you want I want a double portion of your anointing that was the mark of the High Calling nothing nothing could put El back so when we come down here in church we walk in him but also we get rooted and built up in him amen so you get rooted into him wrapped up that you cannot be uprooted from him because he's the one holding you hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah he says rooted and built up in him and established in FA amen they have been taugh amen abounding there in with Thanksgiving walk in him be rooted in him establishing him amen praise the Lord abound and to abound is to remain and increase to fish richly so that one has abundance to abound is used in a flower growing from a bir to full blood amen growing into a full manifestation not a child anymore but rather the hidden beauty of Christ must be made manifest so maturity is the Lady of the Valley that has way out of the m c around the tree to come to the beauty and come to the top to display it Beauty and therefore grow is a process grow is a PA must have a testimony are you together with me that's what we are talking about not a child Ephesians 4 and verse 14 that we forth be normal children what classifies you as a child toss you to and FL carried about with wind of [Music] little a man just put his castol on the on the road side and put a table [Music] there were putting the T Wasing ears let me go see what they will say children are TOS to anded by every wind of doct if they are 10 years in the message they've had about 15 shades of faith [Music] that's a children are TOS to and from Doctrine to Doctrine thinking that's what will give them the maturity being blown by every wind of Doctrine but we need to be rooted and built up in Christ and get established in the faith simple you already have the faith I was preaching faith in Tanzania we had a conversion of more than a thousand people and I tell you I've never really seen I preached it in a few but it hit the not the people know they have the faith but you know if you don't have the faith what saved you what saved you you see the time of the fing the Bible says they will be running running to and from so running from convention to convention is not a sign of maturity you are looking for something and the Bible says you will not find it God established a local church and the principle of God is let the fivefold ministry in there and feed the people have confidence in the Ministries that come your way amen listen to what he says here in Hebrews 139 amen so converstions are very nice Amen to people who are too busy and maybe find a little time to concentrate they are very nice but your local church is the best place because at your local church God is feeding you with exactly what you have need of Amen Hebrews 139 be not carried about with diverse and strange doctr for it's a good thing that the heart be established with Grace hallelujah hallelujah for the heart to be established with Grace it's not different doctrines that will bring you to the maturity but when your heart is anchored in the finished work of calv it brings the Holy Spirit into that hat and then the Holy Spirit that's the worship amen so time comes you know when you plant a seed uh how many of you know those white peas they br in a pod like this white yeah those PE is it is green but also you know when the sun is come if you don't take them out of the farm quick the Shar will keep throwing away the sea have you seen that it keeps vomiting the sea there Comes A Time of maturity when the shark can't hold you are you together with me so you know and the sh are things that when necessary before but when you come to maturity you don't depend on those anymore they just vomit you amen so I want you to know that when certain classes of people amen when they feel like you are not necessary for them anymore don't you start saying oh my neighbors don't have a need of me or at my place of work they don't talk to me they feel like the level of your life is not what can benefit them so the seed has to be separate Hallelujah and we have come into the time where the sea is being gathered in the world Amen the Fe is thrown out of the shark because it has all the life the parent seed had and now the time has come for to give a test hallelujah hallelujah that look at what I look like I look like my parents look at my character I look like my parents praise God Amen First Corinthians 3:10 1310 but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away with that which is in part was necessary at a certain level but when that which is perfect is come so we need to go back into the context of this scripture we have to pick it from the top of the chapter and see as we grow from the imperfect to the perfect verse one TKS TKS without the evidence the evident presence of character amen yeah what how can I say it's like speaking tongues without the evident presence of child himself the give of the spirit that's imperfect is talking about gifts that can be exercised but yet without charity so he's speaking now about the Corinth Church which is the reflection of Pentecost verse two gifts without the evident presence of Charity The Giver that is imperfect verse three benover without the evidence of the presence of character the I mean of char The Giver bover is the ability to give of what you have to support your community to support your church you bant you can give of your money but without charity that's imperfect so from verse one they exercise the gifts of T give some Miracles and exercise giving to charity organizations but they lacked the evidence of his presence all those good things were imperfect because while they did them they lacked long suffering they lacked kindness they were envious theyed meaning they were bful they behaved unseemly are you together with me because they did all that and charity was Char is long suffering but they had quick temper amen they had no feeling for the flock and they were easily provoked they rejoiced in iniquity they are happy when the hear of a brother who was Fallen they exercised all these negative attributes and yet still they held the gifts so then that which is perfect therefore is come it means that which is perfect will be higher than all these gifts that are mentioned in the chapter that which is perfect is the maturity of the seed in the body of the church listen to what brother Bram say in questions Anders please explain First Corinthians 13 8 now that the perfect word is restored to the church are these virtues fulfilled then brother Bram says and when that which is perfect is come that which is in part it doesn't mean it is not part of the word but just holding things in [Music] pieces shall be done away with hallelujah hallelujah are you together with me amen Paul say though I speak with tongues of men and angels and do all things but when that which is perfect is come now is there anything perfect but God no sir is God the perfect when that which is perfect is come and the perfect by the grace of God is the third Po and the perfect came down on the sunset Mountain with the interpretation of the word so the gifts are good they can reveal the hidden life of a person but that's as far as they can go but when that which is perfect is come and that being the perfect interpretation of the word with the Divine indication it will bring the power of transformation gifts are good they can show what is happening in that family but they can't bring Deliverance are you together with me but that which is perfect which is the perfect interpretation of the world when the word is taken to the heart of a Believer and he allows that word to work then that which is in part will not even be necessary because you are obedient to the word the word transforms your life the word designs you is in the perfect where rapturing faith is built amen maturity is not in the gifts maturity is allowing the word to have the preeminence in the life of a Believer amen life led by the word is the life led by the guy the person himself DWS in that life and if there is a gift that comes with Christ at the bottom of the heart is different Colossians 316 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in SS and HS and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord so maturity is the word dwelling in you richly and demonstrating itself as the living word amen it dwells in you richly that in you it begins to dig deep amen from the benefits that are hidden in there maturity is the word amen dwelling in you and making you a teaching life an admonishing life a life of worship that's maturity your life can teach amen you are un admonishing life and then even yourself you are singing melody in your heart you just feel like you should sing some amen so The Church Must goow to that maturity and that maturity must be constant amen when Israel relaxed on the experience they lost their Victory to the Gentile kingdoms when they were going out Moses told pharaoh we want to go out and Worship On The Mountain little they know that they were talking about Mount hor amen no no the Mount Zion that's where they wanted to go and worship oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah they were talking about the place where Christ was going to put his foot amen you see and then Pharaoh says you you you you can go but leave your children and the animals behind they said no whatever we have goes with us in the worship even our children we take them into the worship how many of us have told our children to pray it's very important The Exodus the Passover to enter into the place into the land of Canaan they had gone to worship everything they did was worship the way their lives was designed was it was designed around in the Tabernacle even their Clans they were governed under worship even when they planted what they ripped was governed under worship everything they leave worship when God calls you out he calls you out to worship he wants you to live a life of productive mat but when they started backsliding the Gentile Nations took them over we must be a productive maturity not children anymore as I said that gross just keep string in but then the H says that which you have till I come that is stability the Lord will ask that one he gave you that which you [Music] have a the potentials to give bir another seat because the life is already on their side and the life on this seat is the very life which was in the previous are you together with me so any real SE that is mature has got the ability to give bir to another seed which matures like it matured that's what Isaiah 5 verse 12 and they that shall be of the shall build the old places are you together with me Lord G maturity such a maturity that I can also transfer that same life to my own children and they that of thee shall have the same life and they build the W places he says Thou shalt raise up the foundation of many generations and thou shall be called the repair of the bridge the rest of Towell that's the way God looks at and if God has some mature seeds here he's looking at them to see that that life must be constant that they've got the ability to pass it on they testify they pray they do everything to keep that life alive so when we are [Music] gone we want the seed Left Behind to mature enough to maintain The Life of Christ in the church that's what Isaiah is saying that shall be of the shall build the old west places hallelujah hallelujah the pastor will not worry to be away for a month because the people left behind they got a hold of that life and it is constant not a child anymore so that's the SE I want leave when I'm gone I don't want leave behind another Book of Judges I want to live behind real fertilized eggs amen the Lord they have fed on the work and the world is now being productive let us look at the contrary here judges chter 2 verse I'm finishing in a short while and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the ERS that outed Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of n the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old [Music] and they bued him in the border of his inheritance in Tim timus the M of [Music] epim on the side of the [Applause] H and all that Generations were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation which knew not the Lord no yet The Works which he had done for Israel and the scripture says they were sons of bar andal means good for nothing handsome but nothing strong muscles but nothing they took over the church I don't want the church to be dependent on one man because after those had died the class of the maturity there came up a people that knew not the Lord and then the Gentile nations would come and overrun them and the Bible says God would raise a judge and God was with the judge and after the death of the judge amen I mean and when the judge comes amen then God would give Victory to the judge but when the judge die again the nations take over we don't want to have a church that stands on the stability of [Music] one we must grow whereby we shall be mature we adopted children God can have confidence in us that we may enter the holiest by the blood and that's maturity and stability so that every one of us has access to the holy of holies toad his CA with God not waiting for Deon SW not wa for pastor J but we have got the ability to enter into theol by the blood of Jesus that's not children anymore go in like the high priest did in Fellowship into the holy of holies amen that is maturity amen so if you see the blood of Jesus Christ his son from all go and hold on the horns of the alt and plead your case with God that is stability that's maturity maturity does not deserve Fellowship does not desert Fellowship because of a wickedness maturity will remind God that you did not save me to lose me in the wilderness amen my salvation was not a space of time that's a mature person he doesn't succumb to a wickedness [Music] cry for your restoration amen creating me a clean heart of God renewing me a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me rest to me the joy of Salvation and hold me with th right Spirit you go in and you plead your case with God Amen that's maturity and that is stability not a child anymore amen so we are in the har season the seed now is supposed to be mature and the bride must learn to act with responsibility not a child anymore we are in theega season of the church and we need to build back the pillars that had been broken between the season of Alpha and Omega there were some pillars that were broken because we are coming over here not in the amen are you together with me so that we can come up to the Alpha and Omega season as mature seeds we need to see ourselves as the root and offspring of David that which went into the ground has come up in maturity here are you together with me listen I'll give you the last scripture do you love him amen see not a child do not come to church as a child do not come here to be rocked [Music] amen you say not a child anymore listen as I finish in him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God that's my prayer today Lord make and brother that one cannot go out huh I'll make him a pillar it cannot go out anymore and I write upon him the name of my God name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem Out of Heaven my God and I write upon him my new name hallelujah hallelujah praise God so Revelation 32 was the age of the open door where everything good and bad of all the ages had access to enter into the age of Separation which is the age of L hallelujah hallelujah so that was the age where everybody claim to be the real one and authentic so the Overcomer of this age needed the spirit of discernment that only the E age the the E could give amen the age where we are because everything amen came through that door everything good and everything bad and they come in and they claim everything we are the right ones we have this those ones are wrong so it was a terrible time this is the age amen where we are now this is an age where people are blown by every wind of do everything comes in here this is the age of behold I come quickly hold that first which thou let no man take th CR so the Overcomer that stands in the face in the face of all these different claims and still overcomes the Lord says I make him a pillar in the house of God he has the SP of discernment he has had all the claims but for him he has stood fir behind the voice of the eag the prophet messenger and he's not being moved he says when I find that one is not a child I'll make him a pillar in the house of my God because a pillar is Dependable I will come tomorrow and I still find it is the one that fights the [Applause] earthquake I find tomorrow holding the building together even after so preaching stability not a child God says he wants to depend on you he wants to make you a pillar in the house of God how are you pillars this afternoon amen the overcomer that starts in all the form of opposition he says I will make him a pillar now brother Bram says now is not only giving Crown [Music] amen the Overcomers they give them crowns now is not only giving crowns but he says that these in the bride will be pillars in the temple of God but what is the temp of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God the Holy Ghost within us now is going to make the Overcomer pillar in that Temple what is a pillar a pillar is actually part of the foundation for it holds up the super structure amen praise God that puts the Overcomer right in with the apostles and the prophets hallelujah hallelujah that's the overcome he says I plant him in the foundation of the prophets and the apost and he going to hold the super structure God is looking for somebody that he can depend on any local church to oh hallelujah hallelujah that one is not a child he has been tested he has been tried he has been through the stor and is found to be faithful he that overcome I will make him a pillar God bless the pillars here I'll make him a pillar in the house of God Amen so you must stand strong the entire house stands because of you stands because you pray stands because you intercede St because you are a student of the because you encourage the you are pillar from the foundation to hold the super structure God bless you amen hallelujah hallelujah string on the Promises of Christ [Music] aloud [Music] Glory oh yes Standing on the Promises of God
