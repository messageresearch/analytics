morning amen so you are all welcome to the house of the Lord and it's the best place for all of us to be we should always remember one another in prayer because the life on this other side of of Eternity is always full of Trials amen you remember brother George uh em in your prayers and sister alel uh brother's daughter uh she's not doing very well so each time you kneel down remember one another in prayers so before we go into uh the teaching of the word this morning I want us to remind ourselves of the words of brother Bram he says Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous amen you know kind of walking on the you see when you on the sea and it is snow it's winter some of those Seas freeze that people can drive over them but when the eyes I mean begins to melt a car driving on there can sink so he says here Bible teaching is usually little treacherous amen a little you know kind of walking on out on a but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother B that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church now preaching usually catches a but after catching a sinner so what this preaching would bring him into the hands of a teacher to get a real Jewel out of him amen so now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and he can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are in Christ amen preaching is good it catches you in your mistakes but after the preaching catches you you need a teacher after the preaching to shap you in object that God will use and this is what we see to be focused on here in this church amen let's stand up and get into the scripture reading do one thing this morning pray for me and pray for yourself that as the Lord speaks to me he will also speak to you from what he has spoken to me amen so I we get to the Book of Psalms chapter 96 amen but we have a word of prayer first precious Heavenly Father we give thanks and honor for the opportunity to be in your presence father songs of worship have been sung the people have expressed themselves to you they appreciate your love and at the end of it all we all profess Lord that we are standing on good on Holy Ground we pray that you may take from your word and speak to us the words be of eternal life in Jesus name amen amen so uh Psalms 96 verse oh Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him on the earth may the Lord that blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so this morning we are going to take time and explore the beauty of holiness so the title this morning the beauty of Holiness and this morning by faith we are standing on a Holy Ground amen teaching as we said is like walking on a th but I pray that the Lord may visit each and every one of us with a special understanding on the subject that we are going to share this morning now Holiness is something that vocabul canot Thor explain because Holiness is only to God and God Alone we cannot make Holiness because Holiness is an attribute that identifies the nature of God so how can you ident I mean explain that Holiness therefore is God's unique characteristic a character that man's Fallen nature cannot hold because it is a condition of character and and then this Holiness is literally different from Perfection and it's different also from sanctification I want to make a statement here that in Holiness there is no repentance because it's all righteousness but in sanctification there is repentance because we make mistakes so holiness is a state that only God has and can hold amen Holiness as our title reads is beautiful and in MTH 5 verse 48 we are called to be perfect as our father is perfect now Perfection is the nearest thing to Holiness but then it is not Holiness because this Perfection here which the Lord is speaking about is not sinless Perfection and since it's not sin Perfection it cannot be the Holiness that god holds because in Holiness which means in God there is no sin and therefore in Holiness there cannot be repentance are you together with me so holiness is something that so deep and it belongs to God and God Alone this Perfection here can be closely related to sanctification amen and sanctification is something you step into and you keep growing in are you together with me you grow in sanctification but Holiness is a step amen which is of god now how can we be holy the only way you can be ho is when the presence of God has come to you are you together with me amen so now Holiness can be to a person as it can be to a place so that means it has nothing to do with your works because you will not say this is Holy Ground because it has not qued this morning no Holiness is a state that God gives which he can place in a person and he can also place in a place listen to brother Mage influence of New York he says it's the presence of God in our midst now that brings Holiness can you say Amen to that not my Holiness not yours but his Holiness his presence is what brings the Holiness we ought to Humble ourselves cover ourselves in reverence humility and say Lord Jesus receive me into your kingdom his Holiness not our Holiness holy spirit amen so holiness is the nature and character of God and if given to man it can only attach to the seed Je which is in the soul which soul is the replica of the holy of holies that's where you would find life that's where you found the sh glory of God it was in the holy of Hol so that Holiness attaching to the SE is a gift of Grace it is God coming in Union not because you Merit but it is the gift of Grace and then you walk in obedience to the word for the sanctification of your spirit are you together with me so brother was teaching about the New Birth the no you are born from above and then God attaches himself to your SE G and after he does that then it causes you to walk in the world and as you walk in the world you are constantly Sanctified amen and as you are constantly being Sanctified you are moving into that Holiness amen which Holiness can only be attributed to us in the entire fullness the change of our body are you together with me amen Holiness is beautiful because it holds the glory of God around it and the glory of God Is So compound it could be SE Divine H div digity magnific the Excellence of God the preeminence so whenever God in his Holiness comes down the glory descends with him and this Glory here is very [Music] commanding amen when you stand in that Glory you don't begin to negotiate with God When you stand in that glory amen it just takes over your dictat amen I will tell you certain things here when that glory of God amen comes down because when God comes down the glory comes with it because the glory and the Holiness is part and Par of God those are Natures of God that you cannot separate from him and he remains God are you together with me yeah you cannot separate those attributes the Holiness and the glory and remains God like you cannot extract oxygen out of water and it remains water are you together with me so when God comes down it pulls even the unconverted to realize that there is a presence of God in the area I will tell you something here that nobody lectured to Saul when the presence of God came down on the road to Damascus because the glory of God brought him down on his knees and he did not ask anybody and he says Lord I mean who is that one he only said Lord that's what the presence does when the presence comes down it establish humility your life it will establish uh you know reverence in your life and it will help you recognize the lordship of God amen that's what the glory of God does when God came down in Ezekiel 1 to meet eel nobody told eel KNE down no he says I fell down as though I was dead and then when he came to Daniel he says I fell down and there was no cess left in me celess means goodness there is nothing which we have done that can stand before God and compare to Holiness are you together with me and when God came down on the is of John says I fa as though I was dead praise God so glory and Holiness Holiness belongs to God and just you know that's what it is and when Ezekiel Saw the visions of God he was blanked in glory god was blanketed in glory which was Amber in brightness amen praise the Lord so let me say this when we come down here in church praise God you must have faith in the blood you must have faith in the blood and you must have faith that the grace of God has saved your soul and therefore when you are coming to church I want you to have one thing at your heart that we are coming into a beauty of Holiness as long as we are coming to meet him and to worship him we are coming the beauty of his Holiness are you together with me praise the Lord so if we Z into prayer with seriousness that's the kind of atmosphere we are stepping into the beauty of Holiness that is surrounded by the glory of God that's why Paul says having the boldness therefore to enter into his presence by the blood of Jesus Christ it takes boldness you live your house when you are pray and you say Lord I'm entering into the Hall of holies it took boldness for the high priest to enter into the holy of holies amen they were even tying a rope on his leg because he was entering into a holy place and if he died there no man has the right to enter in there just pull the rock so when this high priest entered there it was boldness is it boldness for you this morning to come into the beauty of Holiness and be able toship him we thank God that we have got something that we can actually attach our boldness to the blood of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus so holiness is a state of being that we shall only fully behold when we step into it according to First John 3 verse 2 when he shall appear we shall be like him hallelujah hallelujah that's when we can testify about the beauty of Holiness Hallelujah hallu because you will be as he Hallelujah the interpretation will be the change of your body for you to understand the Holiness is when you step into that body change but we believe one thing that we come from Christ and we are going into Christ and if the root be holy then so are the branches holy we are depending on him so holiness is God's own life in you amen let's go to Ephesians chapter one amen verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love so you are blessed with those spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you are chosen to be holy you are chosen to come into the sture and nature of God himself to come into the character and nature which language cannot explain hallelujah hallelujah that's what we are called for amen if the root is Holy if the root is Holy also be but in the fullness of adoption amen when we have been adopted to W the change of our body amen but right now we are under the spirit of adoption and through our daily sanctification we are steadily growing towards that Hool are you together with me so keep putting the nature and the character of your human Spirit under the blood keep sanctifying yourself because as you sanctify your the seed chin On th side keeps growing and growing and growing into the character of Christ himself praise the Lord amen so second Peter 1 and verse he says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature second Peter 1:4 amen as you as you keep walking in the word claiming every promise you are becoming a partaker of the nature of God are you together with me every nature I mean every promise you Tak brings you closer to the manifestation of Holiness and Glory that's what Peter says we are being called Glory praise the Lord yes sir so the presence of God by the B of the Holy Ghost his holiness and as you keep receiving in the different virtues you are growing into the full character of Holiness so when Christ stood on the Mount of transformation Peter called it a holy M and he had demanded to build the three Tabernacles are you together with me so Hol is the presence of God a person can be as a can be so holiness is not what you've done Holiness is the presence of God Amen so there are certain things we do we keep under sanctification amen am to attract the presence of God and as long as the presence of God keeps flowing towards you then around you the Holiness and the glory of God hallelujah hallelujah oh where Peter declar the mountain a ho M he desired to have three Tabernacles that place the presence brought down the Holiness and the glory and therefore it was a beautiful place hallelujah hallelujah that place there was beautiful for worship hallelujah hallelujah let us enter into Worship in the beauty of Holiness realize his presence Peter realized that presence says David required to Worship in the beauty of Holiness I have seen it today let us build three Tabernacles here are you together with me oh worship the in the beauty of Holiness praise God Holiness was established by his presence it makes the place beautiful amen step into that beauty and Worship the Lord so when the pastor is preaching and you see yourself in the word and you see at a certain point like God has open the door I want you to go in and pick what you desire are you together with me we are in the beauty of Holiness yes this morning the Lord himself comes down and creates the atmosphere so when the Holy Ghost is bringing forth the word and it comes to a junction where you really feel that's where my need is oh don't get ashamed to lift up your hands and just say thank you Jesus I want to take that that is mine yes sir because we have three hours of service but you may have just have a me of what the Lord is giving to you don't let him pass back just go in for it in the beauty of Holiness praise the Lord yes sir amen you can say Amen you can lift up your hands you can glorify God because he's passing by yourself and the Vindication of his presence is the beauty of Holiness step in and worshiping amen so when the song leaders come here Moses their Ministry is to bring down the beauty of Holiness into the beauty of Holiness are you together with me they bring beauty of Holiness amen because we step into the beauty of Holiness when God comes into a place it becomes beautiful it is Holy is glorious but yet also inside you God stepped in and closed in the soul the beauty of Holiness in the beauty of Hol hallelujah hallelujah that's how we step into the house of worship with the beauty of Holiness in the beauty of Holiness you come when deep down your soul you really feel the presence of he has closed in my soul is connect the SE gen of my soul amen and if it's connected there deep down on the side there is a glory amen there is a Holiness and when is established present here by the singing and the worship and yet God inhabits the Praises of his people it makes the place a holy place so the beauty of Holiness into the beauty of Holiness and watch what God is going to do amen praise the Lord amen sing song leaders let them sing to sing the beauty of Holiness down to break all those negative spirits to sing until you sing the TRS away from the hearts of the people Amen in the days of Moses the Bea of Holiness was in the holy of holies where the high priest was allowed to enter once on of the people not everybody could enter there he entered their on behalf of the people telling the people that you have the access to enter into the Hest but I'm entering there on your behalf to do a service for the atonement of your SE that's where the Holiness was that was where the throne was and brother Bram say and a man or a woman that ever walked into that sh the whole world was shut behind why because in there there was a golden sensor no aenor which was golden in they would put the incense in there and now the high priest will go in there and swing that golden in and this sensor here was an instrument of worship that was only used in worship on the day of atonement the high priest kept waving the and as the sensors were smoking out of there he was like presenting the prayers of the people as the smoke went up the prayers were going up to God and then brought it back again like he was stretching more prayers and then waving them and was sending more prayers for the people so the high priest was doing this only once a day on the day of atonment in Revelation 8 it signifies the ascending of the prayers of the Saints I'm talking about in that presence in there was an AR of the Covenant over with go speaking with Humanity of [Music] Christ amen required God to become a man in order for him to atone for our sin with the same AR was golden P of which had man and in there there was also aon's Ro which bed and the tables of the Covenant and over the Ark of the Covenant was the chab beams of Glory who were overshadowing the The Throne of God are you together with me I'm trying to explain what God has placed on the inside of you are you together with me yes and he deposit in the holy of holies and in there the devil is not supposed to reach there hallelujah hallelujah praise God in the high priest who could reach there and today Christ is the high priest of our confession are you together with me he's the only one who goes in there and when he goes on the side there that that means that he has got into I mean that he has brought in there the presence of God the beauty of Holiness are you together with me and that means in there he receiving your prayers and it also means that in there there is the living manner that never gets stale that in there there's the Mery sins of the Forgiveness of sins when the holy of holies is open to the almighty nothing enter there there's no liar that can get in there rather just to open the door for the Lord to come in when when he comes in and he's on the throne no man can come amen meaning that inside the holy of holies were all the instruments of life and in the holy of Hol are you together with me and the high priest were once every year with the blood which he offered for himself and also for the people he went in to present the blood and also to offer the which is to present the prayers of the people which now Christ himself does because the high priest of your at that time it required the high priest today Hallelujah the holy of holies is open for you are you together with me amen you know the curtain was Tor from top to bottom giving the opportunity for the people to step into the holy of holies and stand before his presence Christ made a way for us to enter into the beauty of Holiness having therefore Breen boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus we all of us can be able to worship the of H you said father you've made a way it's prophetic for me to enter into the H of H but then the Bible says you need boldness by the blood of Jesus the year have the blood this morning has Jesus Jesus wash you in the blood wash from your sins if you are wased you've got the necessary B to enter into the Hool of H to enter before life to enter before Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you've got the ability to go in is what I want you to do this morning to tell the devil you cannot keep me aake from the mer Hallelujah I have committed sins I have committed mistakes and the blood was paid outside to take me ins so today I want to take my blood I want to take my blood to the today I want to go and lay my hands on the SE and say oh Lamb of God have on me and this is what you do every morning you going into the holy of holol we do not need the high priest number because the temple has changed amen the Temple of Moses the Temple of Solomon they had Chambers but the CH the temple today is the temple of David it does not have chamber the moment the door opens you are in the holy of are you together with me so you come with your desires direct to the throne of God you come here to worship and you must be seen worshiping oh praise God let me take you to the book of Acts in chapter 15 verse he says after this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of which is fallen and I build again the RS there and I will set it up and now verse 17 the of men might seek after the law and all the Gentiles upon my name is called says the Lord who does all these things praise the Lord he says now in the New Testament the Tabernacle which I'm going to build is not built by heart and this T here is going to be a people that are going to be the Fulfillment of the prefigure of David's tab which tacle of was just a door into the mercy are you together with me and he says now tacle after the death of Christ be built again that's when Paul had gone to Jerusalem Amen to explain what God was doing among the gentle people he says Peter you are just leading people in worship where you are always the middle amen this big man of God but the time has come the temp of David has to be built again where everybody has access to the beauty of Hol you can go to the mer se you can say Lord have mercy on me so we are not in the Tabernacle Moses we are not in the Tabernacle of Solomon we are now in the Tabernacle of David that does not have partitions like the pastor was preaching here everybody has the right to let the sick and they shall recover hallelujah hallelujah that's what we learned on Wednesday here it's not a Preserve of some this is an open Tabernacle the beuty of Hol you can enter in there brother Bram says the beauty of Holiness is the beautiful atmosphere worship amen God establishes it God establishes and he expects you to walk because there is something in you and once that beauty of Holiness amen is established that also pulls upon the be of Hol which is in the soul you cannot stay away when the church is open amen something in there we pull you into the Fellowship of the S when the presence is here I don't have to tell you now it is the time to pull for your petition amen something inside here we let you know this is the moment and you can jump on your and receive what you have need of we don't come to church just to be very good listen no we come to church free listen but if we could ever get a group of people together where was the genuine Holy Spirit atmosphere sacred and sincerity and worship and men and women sitting in there are God conscious are you together with me listen to how he's bling this words if we could ever get a group of people that was genuine ho where was the genuine Holy Spirit atmosphere amen as sacredness and sincerity and worship and men and women sitting into that presence God conscious they you know they've not come to play games they are God conscious they know they've not come to meet one another they are God conscious are you together with me they are not just coming to do some ritual they come to church they sit on the service is that the group that we have here that have recognized a genine holy spirit atmosphere and sincerity and worship and their he come to Father we are [Music] on are you he's here willing to give those that are here but if he giving and you are not here you receive nothing I don't mean you are not here as your body but if your SE if your ear is not open you will not receive that I'm trying to tell you how devid desired to come into the be of H amen and know that the great po of God is present ready to do all things without one Shadow of Doubt even an effect upon the unbelievers that is sitting in this evening you can never come into that atmosphere without something happen hallelujah hallelujah I expected more of your amen that you cannot walk into that be of Hol and you live without anything happening that's the kind of faith we should have when we come to church and when we have that kind of attitude we are not going to put it on the preacher we shall be putting it on the Lord amen but the people they are CED by ministers that if I don't have brother so and so nothing Canen H are you together with me until people say that brother does not have the gift no we have come to a point where we want to say look our to [Applause] Jesus even before because this is the third po error churches May close any time you are not going to carry pastor with you you must carry the atmosphere of the presence of the Lord and this is what you are training amen you see so that you you you know this kind of looking for the best Church there no best churching about a presence in the atmosphere something happens and seeing the atmosphere already present Anything Can Happen amen they come in turn atmosphere and they God conscious and God is hearing and is caring amen anything can happen praise God the back condition can go my can go pressure can go the Pains of the body can go God can create opportunities he says you don't leave without something happening I pray that something happens for amen yes sir now that we understand both the seed both the seed and the atmosphere we must begin amen we must bring in the teaching that the the seed needs atmosphere to grow amen you already have the SE CH which needs an atmosphere and the atmosphere is the presence hallelujah hallelujah and when that presence is come then the Holiness is come then the glory of God is then the SE is begin to grow into the image hallelujah hallelujah praise God the Holy Ghost himself clear I mean Cates the atmosphere benefit of the seed amen he brings the r which is the Holy Ghost he allows the Sun and all being the Holy Ghost atmosphere to bring the seed to maturity and this atmosphere is the beauty of Holiness we step into it and over and over you are in that atmosphere when time for the rain the rains come the same Holy Ghost is the time for the sun the sun comes the same Holy Ghost he knows what you need just always pray to step into that presence and maintain that presence praise God I want you to hear this in message expectations he says and that's the way we have to get it in the seed form all in one Accord and one place there was blessing the God for the Holy Ghost which had come which had never come yet but they believe it was because God was going to keep his promise are you together with me how many come to church without understanding we are going to Galilee to wait amen that I'll meet you in G and he came and after that in the upper room and he came how many people come to church with so many expectations in their life and knowing that God will meet my you see we need to beat the rich of religion amen where you come to church because it's a Sunday the moment you beat that tradition you are just going to look for the presence hallelujah hallelujah where you go to a place and the song leaders have been out there and a number of Brothers have brought their leak of fire they s the presence down it doesn't matter whether it is a Thursday meeting you go because you know God is going to come if you just come on a Sunday it's a religious attitude which we shouldn't have we should always desire to come and worship in the beauty of Holiness the beaut of Holiness does not have Monday does not have Tuesday does not have Wednesday brother James I'm not the pastor but I want us to come here on the Tuesday next week and see who will come we don't come to worship a day that's why we are going to come here on Tuesday it is the beauty of Holiness and you step into it with lots of expectations knowing that God is going to do something praise God Amen we just need to grow out of this organizational system in this organizational system if it's a Friday must be a Friday if it's Saturday must be a Saturday Sunday must be a Sunday no we are talking about a presence praise the Lord and when they kept blessing God that atmosphere got just right then there come a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and filled all the house where they were sitting the atmosphere got right amen that's what matters that's why the most obligated people are the people who prepare for the coming in of the Ark they were very necessary David prepared them he said you are going to be for amen so that you may prepare the hearts of the people to bring down the glory of God that the people may step Moses's part is very vital to prepare people and you people you pray for him before you come to the service Lord help him to be in tuned enough to bring the beauty of Holiness amen praise the Lord he says we get an atmosphere here every every blind every sick person everything all with one ACC living the sick amen they just piled up the CR I mean he says I seen it last week in Wood River Wood River river yeah River where there wasn't even a person left they just piled up crutches and wheel chairs and I was standing at the platform preaching like this and they just begin T up throwing them to the corners atmosphere was right the tradition I wait for the pastor to finish then I'll go in the line then it's going to touch me no just watch the atmosphere and Lord I think for me the atmosphere to this point is right and you step in and you surpass me you see the angel as the waters and according to the connection between you and the flow of the Holy Spirit you feel that this trouble in his mind amen the traveling of the water at the 50th me is mine stepping there going with Fai and say Lord I receive it huh are you together with me this atmosphere is for the seed gen in the soul you can you can lay a seed out there in the ground no matter how much that seed is dramatized and lay it there it's going to have an atmosphere for it to come alive atmosphere is that presence he says the son has to come to a certain power before bring it to a certain atmosphere to have an atmosphere an egg only to want out no matter how fertile it is it's going to have an atmosphere praise the Lord do you love him there must be an atmosphere I say something about sanctification and Hol you know this luganda Bibles they don't have the word word of Holiness Perfection Holiness it lamps it together they are Clos but not sanctification is something that we grow into but holiness is the state of God himself which we can partake by maintaining the presence so sanctification you grow every day you have something to take under the blood that's sanctification but then is the state of God which you can never get into unless you maintain sanctification are you together with me yeah so but the problem is that our emotions keeps leaking away the present leing leaking amen you have but something now when I say you have a Holiness you must understand what I mean you are maintaining a presence but all of a sudden something comes and punctures that Hol then it begins to leak and then that atmosphere begins to leak you lie and that you know attribute begins to leak last for women then it begins to leak last for money and then it begins to leak but the only pres time I mean the only way we can maintain the presence is by Prayer by study and meditation of the word when you step into that presence and you really know then you try your your best to maintain that presence keep your life in prayer keep your life in study and also meditate on the word you see Holiness and Glory goes together but sometimes our human nature to out fear causes it to Le out you remember the glory of God with the light on mam but then when the message came from Jezebel the fear licked out the glory Elijah began to wonder you mean this woman is coming to kill me and Elijah read like wind he go to a certain place and he doubted the confidence of his servant amen of his servant and he says I'll leave you here because you might betray me baby and you went another Journey again so many things that atmosphere and you need all the time to come into the house of the Lord and fill up you fill up in your study you fill up in your meditation you fill up in Fellowship don't just wait to come to church call brother not only talk about the Border B accident you've seen but have something to say on the word to maintain that atmosphere you be the only one in your family you need to maintain Fellowship on the phones with people just be like little children when there something that means too much you just tell a brother I have called you to tell you the song which has kep me going today [Music] don't switch him off amen there is something moving in there amen he wants to maintain the atmosphere for it was not the song it could have been a scripture you also Fellowship around let us maintain the be of H Amen brother Bram says here let me correct that there is no holy man there's no holy church there's not such a thing it is a holy God you know there's been too much preaching on churches our church brother when you get into our church there's nothing like that brother Bram says it is a holy God not a holy man it's the Holy Ghost Peter one time referred the holy M on M Transfiguration it wasn't the mountain that was Ho it was the holy God that made them on this mountain it's not the holy church it's the holy God in that church not the holy man but the Holy Spirit working in that man are you together with me so once you also feels the beauty of Holiness step into those moments and worship sing songs of worship claim some form of promise even if you are driving amen I sometimes stop my car if I can't stop my car bring out my phone and record what the holy spirit is moving in my mouth and I meditate on it praise the Lord if you feel like the exaltation has blessed you you have got a friend call him and fellowship about that we have to maintain the beauty of Holiness amen oh I am so glad that my Holiness is not of myself Bram says I am glad that I am in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed imparted down to me Holiness sanctification so let's talk about sanctification here now I know one must live a Sanctified life and Sanctified life is a constant submission to the world that sanctification there cannot be sanctification if you the ex because it's committed to the word you are trying the best you can to m the beaut of Holiness that's what the Holy Ghost led me to do that let me participate with my brethren and you do not know what it takes some of the preachers even from overseas they tell me you've got such a patience all the ministers here know that you see if you do that for a few days you begin to say nons Amen but when the Holy Ghost is maintaining something let us try the best we can to maintain the beauty of Holiness amen amen oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah you know sanctification is mission to the word and this submission I mean this submission separates you from the world because the word doesn't tell you go to the Disco it will be telling you stay away from the disc and then as long as you keep obeying the word dress right amen you the words you dress right it will keep away from Bad Company because the word can't tell you to go into Bad Company it keeps you away from the night Sports keep your lips clean amen so that you may not get it to condition of Isaiah a man who stays in the midst of man with unlean lips that is sanctification you cannot be in the word without being Sanctified because he says sanctify them with thy truth the word is trth so sanctification helps you to keep walking in such a life that attracts the Holiness of God are you together with me yeah so I think I car subject on sanctification Holiness and Perfection they seem to be connected but there are three totally different things you see so in another way of looking at it sanctification before you the atmosphere of Holiness amen word sanctification word sanctification is a characteristic of Holiness and that's why when some of our people get that good feeling of sanctification they may confuse it with the BM of the Holy Ghost they come to the Altar and shout and cry and beat the altar but you see the holy spirit is pointing his life away into sanctification you Hur the past you begin to cry people call it the Holy Ghost praise the Lord do you love him this morning amen once yourself feels the beauty of Holiness step into it and worship sing songs do something there Lord I need you at this time father do something for me Lord God whether you are driving whether you are walking God in your heart because you are meditating on the word and you cross something oh thank you Jesus praise God oh Heavenly Father possess that my heavenly father I want to give thanks to you I want to give you the glory whether you were in class whether you were at work whether you on the road you don't have to shout out sometimes you are in an examination and then something crosses your mind and then hallelujah [Laughter] hallelujah you see they are going to get confused praise the Lord amen you know those things that come to your mind as long as it's the word of God is God communing with you never bypass them let's look at Isaiah in the beauty of Holiness in the beauty of Holiness is realized that he needs to grow in the areas of his sanctification he cried saying me for I am done because I am a man of unlean lips I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lives for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of H he realized his [Music] weakness the beauty of Holiness the beauty of his Hol of his presence it doesn't wait for you to come into church can feel the presence as you are walking brother Bram could feel the presence when he's on hunting trips and then he says Lord is there something you want to say to your Serv are you together with me since that presence and when you say that Holiness then anything passing by say some words of pray amen and Isaiah was saying that then FW the him having a call in his hand which he had taken with a tongue from The Altar and La it upon his mouth and said L this has touched thy lips and your iniquity has been taken away and your sin is bur the beauty of Holiness and in there Isaiah learn how to worship are you together with me he keeps throwing away everything I think this is not good for me what are you throwing away in this service today I know the holy spirit is passing your away what are you throwing away what you allow the seraphim come with the Call of fire he knows what areas to pass the call of fire to cleanse you and make you perfect that you may always stand in his presence in this beauty of Holiness oh Isaiah learned how to worship he knew what he needed while stepping into that pres he saw the Holy Angels hallelujah hallelujah praise God he comes to church and his eyes are all over the place his ears are all over the place but some people come to church and they are not here but Isaiah was there and he was able to recogize how those men the Angels who had never seen were treating themselves before the amen you come down to church we don't copy from one another but there will be certain things which brother so and so does when is in the house of the Lord and you are going to learn from that hey I mean Isaiah was learning from the serapi praise God Amen they had never sined before but they covered their faes in amen they how necessary it is to be rever in the house of God are you together with me they keep reverence he saw them cover their feet in humility and they saw how they flew around in action going around shouting holy holy Lord God Almighty prise God Amen you need to get in here and you say teach me out to worship and you allow the Holy Spirit to teach you humility you allow the Holy Spirit to teach you reverence you allow the Holy Ghost to help you get into service amen praise God there is a level of sanctification we need to raise in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you come into the presence of God you are ready to Lear praise God there's a level of sanctification we need let's go to Ephesians 2 this is very interesting he says in verse 4 but God who is rich in Mercy for this for his great love where with he loved us even when we were dead in sin he has quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and has raised us up together in M SE in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now who is this us is it this no the where the glory of God goes to by the B of the Holy Ghost so the Redemption puts the church into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that is a spiritual Dimension where the blessings of the believer are hidden your blessings are hidden in a dimension so you allow the Holy Spirit to come down into your life Lift Your Inner Man Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where your blessings are hidden meaning that you can never receive the bless until you are lifted to the heaven places in Christ Jesus are you together with me so the Redemption puts the church into Heavenly places ascending to the Heavenly places is you putting fruit into the beauty of Holiness amen you are like Moses at Mount you are like a Peter John and James the Mount of transfiguration you are like a s on the way to Damascus you are Beyond flesh and blood and you came to a point communicate with God that's where the Holiness is that's where the glory is that's where the blessings are if there is a soul here amen soul soul amen he needs to step into that presence and have conference with God hallelujah hallelujah when Isaiah isah stepped into that Holiness he had conference with God they spoke one to another when Moses on Mount stepped into that amen they had conference with God and I want tell you today if you come into that presence you will talk to God you'll be able to bring out the depth of your heart which you can never tell a pastor which you can never tell your wife which you can never tell in the presence just flow out when we come into that beauty of Holiness into the holy Mount we take communion with God look so fell to the Earth and had a voice saying why thou persecutest me and he say who thou Lord hey are you together with me wonder that somebody in the midst of a fire is talking to me he knew that was God and he knew that was a holy SP Hallelujah he did not need any tutorship that that is God the glory that's in that presence just makes itself known you know it is God you need to get to such moments you you are dealing with God sometimes we come to church and we just know we are dealing with a pastor need to come to a point where you know you are dealing with God and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou it's hard for thee to kick against the bricks amen are you together with me he says it's so hard for you fight me it's very important to get into that presence and he trembling and astonished Lord what will you to do Brothers should I speak when you enter into that presence you speak with God you have conference with God when Moses got into that presence he had conference with God when Daniel got into that presence he had conference with God when eel got into that presence he had conference with God when the three disciples entered into that there was conference with God today God wants to have a conference with you amen you've had problem you had issues today God wants to find you in a secret place in a and talk to you Hallelujah I'm sure that's where you're going to find solution for your problem you need to rise above what we've been taught as a letter that a Christian prayer does this how does he get into that prayer that's what we are dealing with and when you know how to get in there it changes everything praise the lord we are ID because we have not been at the presence to be commissioned of God hallelujah hallelujah when Moses met him in the Holy Bush God commissioned him when isah met him God commissioned when God commission everybody whoever meets God God Commission and brother James says that everybody has a call but the only thing you need is to step into conference with God in the beaut of Holiness so let us understand our fellowship with God before I finish do you love fellowshipping with God let's understand and let us be the kind of people that brother Bram spoke about when they come into the presence of the Holy Ghost they are so good cautious amen they don't come behind walls to say I've been present but Pastor is but God doesn't see you when God sees you that's when you say you are present having conference with God you step into the H of Hol you hide away from the world you are conscious God is there and anything can happen Anything Can Happen blind eyes Anything Can Happen ears anything can happen that's what I want you to take with you you've got so many things that have stood for so many years Anything Can Happen listen we are talking about being that spot the beauty of Holiness okay Hebrews 12 verse2 Paul is describing your fellowship with God but you are come Zion and the City of the Living God the Heavenly Jerusalem and un inumerable company of angels I'm asking you where are you you see that's the [Music] problem you are not with God where are you we meet in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus until you feel that yes I'm in that presence you are not present because Paul is describing you we have come unto Mount Zion the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem company of angels look at the definition of that felly the Living God Heavenly Jerusalem inumerable C of angels so our coming together our gathering we being in Heavenly places is something beyond what our eyes can describe are you together with me the Holy Ghost worship is not done in our kinds it's our Inner Man Who steps into a future toship God are you together with me you Step Beyond yes sir this kind of man in order to be wor able to worship God David said I was happy when they said unto me go to the house of the Lord but when he got there he also says praise the Lord all my soul and that which is within me are you together with me sister MAA your natural self told you let's go to the house of the Lord but when you here you start appealing to your soul praise the Lord all my soul and that which is within me so when you your soul projects out my soul projects out then that's we meeting in m z in the Holy m in the holy of holies it is you eating in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it is you and me in the beaut of Holiness to worship we are send our future room amen it's like that Eternal fellow which we are going to have after the change of our bodies in Mount Zion this the kind of Fellowship we must have with our father are you together with me when we come into this Fellowship when people are zero God Amen they Zer in God they've completely given themselves into what they are doing when you do that it's like you have ascended you've been taken into your Eternal R that's what Paul is seeing in Hebrews toship we are send our future Zion he will come to Mount Zion one of these days and Mount Zion will have a light on her all day and all night the redeemed shall walk in that light praise God I want you to have a picture of what it means to step into the Bea of Holiness and David says let's was Lord in the be of Holiness let us say that let us Worship the Lord in the Bea of holiness you see then the prophet says on top of Mount Zion will sit the lamp so when we come together in a time of worship I want you to know that God is not seeing at your color no he's seeing you by the G SE where the glory of God is hidden the Holiness of God is hidden and the blessings of God are hidden so when he sees you in a fellowship like this as far as God is concerned he seeing his children gathered on Mount Zion after the body change hallelujah hallelujah when we have that kind of look feeling like that there nothing which God can withhold from us because it's a holy atmosphere is that too much for you this morning he says on top M Zion will set the lamp and the city will need no light the lamb is the light thereof and above the lamb will be the fire which is the logos God the great light the eternal light that will shine upon the throne and Jesus will not be on his father Throne he will be on his throne and the father will hover over the son which the father and the son will be one and while they are yet speaking I will answer before they can think I think for them hallelujah hallelujah he took John Peter James on the mountain and he started giving them a preview of what the kingdom will be these fellowships we have is God bringing us into preview of what we shall be on M and the preview of John Peter and James was real Jesus opened himself and they saw him by the glory which goes with Holiness are you together with me so when we come down here the prev of M Zion must be so you must believe for the impossible that God can do amen oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah you can tell God there will be nopper there there be noer why am I AER here amen and God can perform it itto you to your facei amen so when you begin to pray you are zering into your theop it is stepping into Heavenly places prayer is not prating before an it is stepping into the P of Holiness that is where John was when he says I was in the spirit on the Lord's that the [Music] atmosphere everything Supernatural began to open for and God has called his bride up and I will show you that's where Abraham ascended to when he saw the Lord's Day in the valley of shave so you are not you are come out Mount and out the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem one inumerable compan of angels hallelujah hallelujah in the fellowship here I don't know whether you know what I'm talking about I'm talking taking you to CIA sincere Fellowship puts us into a very holy presence it places Us in the presence of innumerable campan of angels if you could have your eyes open today there are hundreds of angels after all when you receive a man a Son of God you receive him together with an angel when I come into your house when I enter your house you have not only received me you received me with an angel amen we have got angels that go with us and when we come here an inumerable company of angels amen you see so if you go beyond the tradition of Fellowship you can get into a Divine fellowship with god listen to what brother Bram says and when his eyes come open to see the spiritual world this is the servant of elishah all around that old Prophet was Angels the mountains was on fire with angels and the Chariots of Fire so there is a world right here now in the building are legends of angels believer now this are believer right here they Angels Jesus said in the Psalms by the King David that the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him so look at the Believers here those he who fear God so the angels are everywhere now if you can just worship God and open your eyes you'll find that God is all around us creating a beauty of Holiness to step in And We Worship the Lord amen verse 23 he says to the general assembly of and the Church of the first which are written in heaven unto God the judge of all the spirits of just men made hallelujah hallelujah heav places being def amen beauty of Holiness when we come together in the Bea of Holiness he says that we have come as a general assembly and the Church of the first so in the Heavenly places is not this little church and that little church ver as that little church it's a general assembly it's one body there's no sism every joint suppliers he sees one body among which he dwells he doesn't see the hand being better than the leg he doesn't see the in Tabernacle being better than the Bible Tabernacle the general Church of the firstborn who are under the same token we are being many and one body in the Lord for us the body is one and there's many B members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also crisis for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of us all above us all and through us all is the general assembly the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven oh hallelujah hallelujah we should never allow to n ourselves with visions my pastor is better than that Pastor my church is better than that that's not how God looks at the church of [Music] the are you together with me we are in Heavenly places we are gathered in Christ Jesus in presence of God where all things are possible amen so when you step into that Dimension the beauty of Holiness you are in Fellowship the spirits of the just I'm finishing but I want you to know that David cries and says let us go and Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness amen and he says unto Jesus the medat of a new covenant and the blood of sprinkling that speak better things than that of isn't that wonderful Fellowship having Fellowship the mediator amen of the new Grace Covenant and he wants you to listen to him because you are gathered to hear him his blood speaker better things than the blood of ab it doesn't speak condemnation the blood of ab spoke Revenge the blood of Jesus speaks better things forgive them the blood of cried out for Revenge but the blood of Jesus cries out for temperance cries out for patience the blood of Jesus does not cast the Brotherhood the blood of Jesus does not cause separation the blood of Jesus calls you to one body the blood of Jesus does not separate this preacher against that preacher the blood of Jesus says that you are one body but members in particular and everybody has his part amen praise God so we are before the blood that speaks better things and the prophet says sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the Old Testament the blood spoke of K in the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of Heaven are you together with me here amen so here you need to catch your REM your REM from the logos logos is the general word given to the edge but the r is your personal revelation from that logos amen when my grandaughter was born I called everyone needs a of his own amen we come into this presence and you live without God speaking to you you need to take some REM so we are at the borders between and do you understand me between David and Solomon because David's Kingdom ends with the kingdom of Solomon coming in how did that Kingdom end it did not end like this it ended like this so I want you to understand that the kingdom of David when it was ending the kingdom of Solomon had to come in but Solomon comes in when David is not dead that's the season of Solomon's adoption are you together with me so we at the borders of David to Solomon while you are in the by Flesh and Blood you've already set a step into the Feast of Tabernacles amen by [Music] your has stepped into eternity that's what I mean so you step into such an eternity and the things that you are hearing and the things that the Holy Spirit reveals to the Believers of the message can only be given by the Holy Ghost the world and doesn't know what is happening around but you know what is happening because you have been called come up here and I'll show you step into the presence where the Holy Spirit speaks better things and you are feeding on prophetic revelation you are a level higher your worship why do you worship it's not a worship are you together with me it is a worship of the world to come that's why we say we are not on Mount Si we are on Mount Zion your worship is different your worship is not coming to church your worship is the work of your life are you together with me that's why our women they make sure they don't expose this because it throws and it makes their Hol leak amen why do you show the line here amen that's why they put some clothing longer do you know why because they are typing the bride of Christ that while we are in L we are not Lan Church a part of us has already stepped into the future world we are worshiping we were in heaven on m z we are worshiping in the seventh Feast amen which is the Feast of Tabernacles the type of theia when we have become the bride are you together with me yes sir we are stepping into Holiness you don't step into it half naked you are Ador as a bride of Jesus Christ amen why do you keep putting pins here you throw away those clothes and get the right ones because you are representing a future your future is where you are flesh and blood is inia the is z are you together with me amen you are in this world but not of this world this is where we are amen we have stepped into the beauty of Holiness our worship is not allow worship of entertainment it's a worship to praise God Amen from the bottom of our praise God we are the borders of David you in by Flesh and Blood you have a step into the Feast of Tabernacles amen by your soul amen listen to brother bran future home he said the Feast of Tabernacles was the last feast the seventh Feast we are worshiping now under the Feast of Tabernacles in theeven chur while we are here our real person is there that's how we come to church this comes here flesh and blood but the reality of who you are is beyond M Amen in theum we will be under the Feast of Tabernacles again in the seventh day but then after the seventh day we have a holy conation go back into the Eternal by the Eternal one that came and redeemed us and taking us back letting us recognize that we are a part of this are you together with me so at this point the seed G on the side of the Soul begins to announce that it's breaking morning Eternal unfair amen something in you one time you W up so happy and you start wondering why doesn't the Rapture come now have you ever felt like that yeah you just wake up so happy you are raptured something is testify you are not of this world Amen so something in you to Worship in anticipation for the coming world that's the worship we are in you know that you are in connection with the word which was with a vure dipped in blood the word which was with a vure dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven follow him and out of his mouth goes a Shar SW and tread us with wine press heed The Wine Press of the fierceness of the Wrath of the almighty God Amen and he has on his V and on his written king of kings and Lord of lords are you together with me we are in fellowship with the attribute of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and when John describes he says he had a vure dipped in Blood and his name was called the word of God the armies of Heaven followed amen and his mouth came a fulled SW sword and he was treading Down The Wine Press of the wrath of God is quenching it because the bride is coming hallelujah praise God I want us to know that we don't come here just to be obligated to religious function right here we are in the borders of Solomon's kingdom of the son of David we draw ourselves therefore into Theon hallelujah hallelujah Sol a type of the son of David the son of David is Christ as King in the so our worship at this time changes fles and blood we in but by the human spirit I mean by the soul G the Gen see we are in eternity that's why we say we are at the border we feel like this seed on the inside gets warm sometimes like sometimes would be taken away the Jo unspeakable you begin to sing the world day something on th side there is say we are at the border time to go is now something keeps pushing you into the solomonic worship Hallelujah because the Tabernacle the Tabernacle is being dedicated are you together with me you are the Tabernacle of God and you are being dedicated for the coming of the Lord something inside you tell you time shall be no more why don't you worship Him at the worship of Solomon why can't you take that boldness by the blood of Jesus that when you come into church you are not coming into just a gathering of friends you are coming into the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and allowing the atmosphere of the presence of the Lord himself to come down with Holiness and Glory look know you not that you are the temples of God and that the spirit of God dwells in you at the dedication of the temple you should actually proceed forth amen into that worship and when Solomon came the scripture says in 2 Chronicles chapter 5 verse it came even to pass as the Trum come on brother Moses and Joshua wherever you are and it came to pass come on the musicians you don't just come here to just get aitar no sir you come here to produce Divine Melodies amen brother St you come here to produce Divine Melodies amen the jitar and the organ and all the other instruments they come and blend together to testify of the Oneness of the body of Christ together in worship hallelujah hallelujah it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers we as one to make one sound to be hard in praising thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voices with the trumpets and the symbols and the instruments of music and praise the Lord say for is G for end is forever the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by the reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord F the house of God hallelujah hallelujah Holiness Glory go together and at that time the worshipers St into that real the beauty of Holiness they stepped inside there the singers everybody they come as though they were one and at that time the ministry of Christ emerged and took over the Bible says the priests could not Minister what does it me that the pastor will never minister no it is the glory of God that comes down to take the gift of the minister to speak to the people like they hearing from God are
