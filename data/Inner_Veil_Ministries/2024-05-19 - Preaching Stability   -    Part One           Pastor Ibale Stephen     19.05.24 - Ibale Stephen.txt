are thankful people that we've been able to come before your presence and have fellowship with you that's the principal reason why were created to have fellowship and Lord you have made access for us to come into the Holiness by the blood of Jesus that we may find Salvation in times of need so we pray Lord that you may come down and father speak to us from your word and Lord when you speak we pray that may also water it with the spirit of life that the word may bear fruit in our lives I commit you all these your children that are present this morning that father you grant them the desires of their hearts meet their need father in Jesus name amen Romans chapter 1 and verse one Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God what an identification amen says I'm a servant of Jesus Christ are we all Servants of Jesus Christ but then Paul says he was called to be an apostle what are you called to be he knew himself what were you called to be that we may know the mystery of his will may God bless the reading of the word and we may be SE so today I'm just going to start on a few [Music] series and I'm going to call this series preaching stability preaching stability you see when we were called we were called at rest but sometimes when people find Christ they become so unsettled because they think they are the ones who are going to work it out but you know I want to take some series and preach stability so that you can come to the church and just come to celebrate and thank God for Redemption the salvation of your soul God fulfilling his promises that's what we are here for now Christ is that eternal spirit amen but you know uh before the foundation of the world that eternal spirit existed alone he had no you know star no moon no atom no guns this eternal spirit was by himself and the Hebrews called him Elohim the one who exist who exists alone so now he condescended when he came to the time of creation he left the form where he was as Elohim and come into a lower form but he was still the same God same power same Authority and then we understood him as logos because he was going to create and he needed to speak the word and then that same one here is the one that was that Pillar of Fire the Fountain of Life everything that exists came from that Fountain so we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God the power of the word and as sons of God we or from that Eternal Gene amen which is called Christ that's where we originate from that's what makes you an eternal son I mean an eternal child of God you know because you were with him from before the foundation of the world Amen so where did you come from you came from Christ that anointing that Eternal Fountain amen so we are Eternal and we are not products of time amen like C was we are not like Kan you know you know a product of fleshly Union there is a part of me that existed in the original creation amen so in Christ we are as Eternal as Christ is eternal because a man that's born of Christ must be born from above amen so all the elects amen from time back into eternity when we are put together we make the body of that Christ so in our various Natures in Christ we make the Eternal character of God are you together with me yeah we come from God Amen right from Abel all of those after the last elected one make one body and every one of those has been a special character that come from God and that special character cannot be replicated amen everybody is an original character amen you may get a thousand pastors and you put them there but they are not the same everybody is different that's what makes God special amen different characters right from Abel to the last elected one everybody is going to be an original product and until all the character of God has been produced here on Earth to be tested then overcome there cannot be a Rapture are you together with me so some Apostles some are prophets some are evangelist some are pastors some are teachers some do exaltation some they do giving some are business some are mechanics some are Housewives some engineers in different callings but everyone is unique from one another that's how rich God is amen I'll will show you the wealth of God look at vegetation amen when you get out into the wild there are thousands and thousands of different designs amen of vegetation you get mang you get oranges you get tangel you get different avocados you know all kinds of things but all these look different in thousands and yet all of those if their are fruits they taste different and all those every one of them is different from another by the quality of food that they carry some of this vitamin some of this you know God is so rich amen is Rich of design we are billions of people here on Earth but none existing on the Earth today looks like the other that's a wonderful artist are you together with all of us when we apply our thumb print we exactly different even what you think identical twins they are not the same it's your eyes which think we are the same and your eyes may look at us and you think we are the same because we are all pastors no everybody has got a different calling and the way he manifest the gifts God has given Amen brother Bram says it takes God as his Spirit as he promised to move in our bodies as he did in the body of his son amen I'm taking you up 11 now he promised to move in your body the same way moved in the body of his son and we being his become sons of God and a part of that same Spirit are you together with me because Jesus was the fullness and he came in body but we we receive of the fullness but still coming in a body are you together with me yes sir and he says when you receive of that fullness then God begins to move in your body the same way moved in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ then he says the character The Works manifest the same thing as it did when it was in the Corporal body of our blessed savior together with me so we are all called differently but whichever call we are called into we are a part of that great body and that's what brings the stability if we are part of that same we got the example of our own bodies a finger will never wake up one morning complaining why it's not the feet why am I not the toes amen the body is always in a Harmony if we come by that same Spirit then we come from a body and we are part of the body body that's where the unity of the body comes from if you came from the father because elect cannot fight elect amen he says Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle are you together with me I don't know what you are called to be but God has invested in everything one a specific calling that can never be duplicated called to be Paul knew who he was in the body of Christ and that's your well amen when you know who you are in the body of Christ I'll take you to the Book of Exodus amen chapter 31 and then verse two here it says see I have all I have called by name bzar the son of Yuri the son of of the tribe of Judah so I have called by name now we already know that a name has to do with disposition you know disposition is the nature the name always speaks about your nature so he's telling Moses I have called by name amen I have called him by a specific gift he not going to be a Moses is not going to be Anon is not going to be maybe Miriam but he has a part in the body are you together with me I have called him by name there is a character I have set in him and that's what is saying or he's calling the name and verse three says listen I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all man of work command now when you receive the B of the Holy Spirit you have received a particular form of disposition you know a way God wants you to manifest yourself you don't receive the Holy Spirit and you become Dom when if filled B with the Holy Spirit he begins to explain what that spirit is going to do it will give him understanding and knowledge in all manner of workers now that God has filled me with the Holy Ghost what is the spirit going to do in me that should be the question of Lord help me that you may testify about me like you Tes about I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and understanding and knowledge in all manner of work so I have filled him with the spirit of God to work the gold Amen to craft the gold to craft the silver and once he FS with this spirit that spirit will bring certain abilities that will help in the building of the Tabernacle are you together with me yeah you don't ask for the B of the Holy Spirit just to show you've got power to heal the sick that's the minor thing when we talk about the Holy Spirit because there are those that will use the gift to heal the sick even without the B of the Holy Spirit together with me so now that I have received the Holy Spirit what is your purpose in my life remember TI this morning is preaching stability part one because when we were called we were called to rest we were not called to panic amen so he says in verse four to devise caring Works to work in gold and in silver and in BR and cutting of stones to set them and cing of Timber work in all man of work I behold I have given him AOL the son of of the tribe of Dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted put wisdom that they may make all that I have commanded thee listen now the way God is working here he has called Moses he understand the specifications amen all the entire uh house is in his mind but then God says you are not able to craft these things so you need to find a man and I've called B by name are you together with me so might be a very knowledgeable wise pman but then the specifications is not coming from his mind Moses has the specifications but he cannot work the specifications a can work them but he doesn't know how to do that so he has to stay on the ministry to him to what God wants him to be are you together with me yes sir he says behold I have given with him a a is also called to work the gold and the silver but then is now God is setting ranks he makes B the head and is a helper amen but all of them are needed to do the work so we being many we are one body in Christ and every one member of One or to another are you together with me yeah he says I called a with him so God made it he made it that way so that there cannot be competition in the body are you together with me everybody has got a spot this amen and then begin to operate if this hand grows on the h in the back here then it will have trouble to do its work it could have desire to be the side of the maybe grow from here but that one will deform the body I'm preaching stability this morning amen he says I have called him I have filled him with the spirit of God but then I've have given him a praise the Lord but in the world people go with what earns more [Music] money but in the body of Christ we are positioned to support the body amen and I've told my brother Nelson here that it's important to pray if you don't pray you cannot prosper in your calling amen you might be a Constructor an engineer and Doctor you need the anointing of the holy spirit for you to do your work better amen that's what it is says I have filled him with the spirit of wisdom in doing what in crafting are you together with me so it's very important whatsoever call you find yourself pray that father show me my position give me the grace and the faith to stand in my position you can become the better teacher amen even if you are not a Bible teacher in school you ask for wisdom for God to lift up you you up in your position amen but in the car world oh you know you don't take that c take this one here this one here pays more amen but as a child of God when you find your position that's your joy that's your happiness that's your blessing amen that's why we must be faithful in the house of God faithful as a technician faithful as a teacher amen you know because God will open up appropriate doors to bless you in the area where he has do what you do as unto the Lord use your gift Faithfully so that you can also have the ability to win men un Christ that whatever comes to your work and sees what you have done oh he's going to thank God this is a very wonderful man you know he want to come to church and see where do these people come from amen you are sent there as an attraction misus their gifts Desiring to remove Moses from the office amen so but you know God told my Moses is not so is faithful in all my house in my house you know he says you know Moses I speak to him Li ear as a Ser as a prophet is more than what you people can judge amen said my Moses is faithful in all my house because he knew how to use his gift to benefit the entire body he is faithful in all his house are you Faithful as handling your calling in the house of God if we were faithful and we knew what we were doing we would not go outside to SCE people to do our works because we've got men that have been baptized with the Holy Ghost are you together with me in wisdom to do certain things so we originate from eternity in our Seasons to OCC and use our positions in the body we are part of Eternity and each time an elect comes to his adoption it's ET rolling into time amen because you come here to fulfill a purpose amen there is a purpose for every SE gen of God which comes from above maybe God you know manifested you in this season because you are a prayer he knew the hard time that was going to come chch and sometimes on this very local church and then he manifest you as a man who can manage situations by pray to another maybe God brings you in and then he says you can be anointed to amen and for that one he says you give in simplic you know God knows what he wants to do with us so the seiling of the soul is Sten stepping forth in take his position in the body when the Holy Ghost seals your soul then you are stepping forth in your season to take your position in the body so I would also say like brother Bram says the Royal elected seed are predestinate for of God and the mind of God and His Thoughts then he says in very plain language they were in the mind of God eternally somebody say Amen they are not products of time they were in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated DEC season amen you were in the mind of God but you could only be manifested in this season because this is where your calling is it was not in the time of Luther it was not in the time of Wesley neither was it in the time of Moses or Noah this season to manifest the purpose of God for your life and as each member came forth the prophet says it became expressed and took its place in the body amen so they are predestinated in him came from the same source with him it was eternal we are Eternal with him but then in our season we come to manifest God in the many member body every one of you is a part of the body of Christ amen okay now we go down here brother Bram in the saman churches he says now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal Loos was manifested the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodly and that Eternal one was was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the ti of son even we also Eternal in his thoughts in our time became the many membered spoken flesh and those Eternal thoughts which is you now manifesting flesh are the sons of God when Jesus was manifesting flesh he was showing us the father when you are manifest in flesh you are trying to show forth the am even so we are so we did not become seed by the rebirth we were SE and therefore we reborn only the elect can be reborn because you were SE is the reason why we could be quickened in N Seed there's nothing to Quicken are you together with me amen so now I want tell you you did not become SE to be saved but you were see and that's why you are saved so you are Eternal with God Amen he that believeth me amen and you are the believer because you are the Eternal SE a portion of you is God himself amen like he does this and so the same potentials come down in your heart the same poten of this great God that's how you are Eternal amen because you got those Po and you come down here to manifest the father amen only himself by his position in the body Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle that when the sons of God were becoming manifest when God spoke them into creation the person that I took was to be an apostle that's what say so Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated under the gospel of God understanding of himself John the Baptist when they went to ask him who he was he had a clear understanding of who he was and he says I'm a voice of one crying in the wildness I have got news for you every one of us has a [Applause] position has a position in this calling he's saying that I am separated un the gospel of God I cannot be mixed up I know where my authority comes from I'm not blown by every wind of doctr I am separated to the gospel of God how many of you would say like Paul separated to the gospel to listen to the T to read the books to to pray to have all the attributes of God manifested to be able to love because that's what God is and being separated to the attributes of God that I can become a body to manifest that Eternal God Amen I have been given a master seed Fai amen Master seed is the smallest of seed it cannot be hybrid so you have been even that kind of Faith to place you in the body it cannot be mixed up amen he says I am called be an apostle I know who I [Music] am Paul is saying my position of faith is designed to sustain a gentile apostleship amen I cannot go up in the calling of Peter he was called for the Jews but I know my position and once every one of us knows our position the body that's the stability of the church amen when I Paul go scripture I only get to see Gentile promises I just seem to see hey God was hiding them in scripture here oh my God they are supposed to be part of it amen yes sir but Peter was not called for that even when celius prayed a gentile and God sent Peter while he was speaking the Holy Ghost came down Peter still say it's not enough unless you wash your feet you wash your P you the Jewish you know he could not go beyond that and when he tried he was destabilizing the body and says I will him first to first as long as you recognize your position work in your position that's the stability of the church so when God calls you he releases a position of Faith the kind of Faith That is supposed to sustain you in your calling look at Abraham he was called into the land of promise he was anointed and stood up against many kings many kings that had taken lot defeated them redeemed lot brought the loot but then each time he went away from his position he was afraid of one king he would even tell his wife please please you tell these people you are my sister why he has gone away from his position he loses the authority he loses the power he feels vulnerable so perfect way I mean perfect Faith Works by seeing your position in the body recognize your position and see how faith and Grace and see how faith and Grace will pour out to support you in that position amen is the beginning of all form of blessing the moment you see your position amen you may not have to pray for certain things God will just bring them to you because they are necessary for your position that's how interesting it is seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness and everything else will be added to you you don't need to go and fast no when God sees this is necessary for his position he'll give it to you now listen to what says in the message hear his voice and see how God in his great plans just know how to make every person exactly to be a certain thing because he's going to use them for that purpose hallelujah hallelujah in his wisdom he made you what you are knowing that he was going to use that nature the moment it is sealed under the holy spirit so in every age he releases a particular Grace for a particular area I mean he release a particular Grace for a particular area there is a specific Grace for every area whether you want it or you don't want it not every preacher will be successful everywhere when you take me to another place I may not be able to perform because the nature of the Gen that God gave me was for this area and then he says the angel came down and told Brother BR if you can get the people to believe you then nothing will stand against you not even cancer that's why we stand trusting that God has placed us here and he gives me the kind of approach to the word that meets the needs of the people that's the way God works amen he gives a particular Grace for a particular place he has given us the seeds of our people over the Earth we planted this seeds and God has blessed the people because of the ministry that we have rendered out here amen he has blessed the people some of them have gone beyond where they expected to but God when he blessed Abraham he says I've made you to be a blessing when he blessed me He blesses me here to be a blessing and he attaches you know a certain form of seed that I plant among the people and then the people begin to harvest amen they start wondering how have we come this far how did I overcome this how did I overcome that but because a man has been given the grace he only makes a statement and it sticks in the life of the person it becomes an overcoming weapon hallelujah hallelujah amen he has given us the seeds for our people he has been able to keep us together he has given us respect for each other are you together with me I want to take the example of the seven churches that Min Ephesus could not take over the grace the grace of and be blessed by it it could not work because the season for Ephesus required a certain form of Grace and that's what God gave them you cannot get the grace that God gave Ephesus and you give it to they cannot handle it they will mess it up Andia they being rebuked they are being corrupted they are being chastized God is trying to get his and thank God that you are being picked out of Amen listen now much as Peter was an apostle he could not understand how God was working among the Gentiles but yet they were both you know Apostles God could only give him an understanding for the needs of his Jewish people amen praise the Lord preaching stability I want to tell you friends that when God Saves you he places you in a place and puts the kind of Ministries that can be able to satisfy your need there are so many people who don't understand how God works and those are blown by every wind of doctr when a preacher comes in town they all gone with it because they are excited because every portion of ministry is good and necessary for the body but then that Ministry passing through is just a little dose that is supposed to bless you when you run away with that man you are going to find out that no there is something that I'm lacking here and that's why you see people they run out of church and come back in church again they've not found out the way God works with this on the general level on the general level we are Brethren but God when is Grace relevant to the needs of the [Music] area you can't take me to and I become a successful Minister there in every stren circumstance [Music] he releases his name wrapped in the needs of the people and that's why every local church is unique amen that's the way God works when he sees the needs of the people he wraps his name in there [Music] I'm going to explain it in Revelation 2 verse1 that's why every church is unique amen Revelation 2 chap I mean 2 verse one the angel of the Church of of Ephesus right these things says he holds the Seven Stars in his right hand who walks in the midst of the golden candle are you together with me but is not saying the same for the church in sa he's identifying himself by different attributes but here at Ephesus he was demonstrating the [Music] sovereignity of who he was through the entire seven churches that even in the next Church it will be me amen that's going to be sueme because there has never been a church before the church is starting here to the Gentiles withus and so he's telling them I am the one who holds the Seven Stars meaning there will be seven Church seven Messengers but they all originate from my so he was like introducing himself to these Gentiles understand how God was going to work through the churches are you together with me Ephesus was the god I mean in Ephesus was God demonstrating his sovereignty in the church he was demonstrating his Divine Authority that he was going to exercise through the seven churches he demonstrated himself holding seven steps and walking one step in E phia and all those seven churches there was no pop with him there was no Cardinal with him there was no Bishop with him there was no pastor with him trying to tell them that now the church is beginning it's going to run seven churches be me that will be spr there he is with the Seven Stars in his right hand the right hand arm signifies the power and authority of God this signifies that the very power and authority of God and behind the messengers of every age they go forth in the fire and power of the Holy Ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light they reflect this light they have no light of Their Own they K not their own fire that men may walk in the light of their spars hallelujah hallelujah I cannot you know spark my own fire I have to contain and maintain you know that same fire but you find a minister like is the one who Sparks the fire like is the authority behind the word so the character of God is always wed Amen in the area of need of the [Applause] people they had never seen a gentile Church before so what they needed is to understand what God was starting with them and would go for the seven churches that was the need he works the same way in the local churches he stands in the weakness of the people and wraps himself in those weaknesses so that he may identify himself as their strength amen I'll give you an example in Genesis in the time when Abraham needed a lamb God wrapped his name in the need of Abraham so that he can declare that I am Jehovah are you together with me the title shalom shalom shom would not work for Abraham God wrapped himself in the need of Abraham to Ral himself to Abraham so what he did was to release aamb and when the lamb come forth it was Jehovah Gyra that's the need of Abraham it was not Jehovah he was not sick are you together with me so your needs dictate the need of the ministry are you together with me that's why you'll find many ministers they can come you can get excited a little bit but I want tell you but after some time you find there is something that you need amen praise the Lord in judg in the time when Israel was going into war in the time of Jon the Lord put forth the end of his [Music] stuff amen and touched the Flesh and [Music] un amen that Daniel was giving as a sacrifice and there arose a fire out of the Rock and consumed the flesh and the UN Cates then the angel of the Lord departed out of J son J realized that he had met the angel of and then he said fear not Thou shalt not die and when Jon built the altar he called it Jehovah shalom shom could not call it Jehovah he now talking about the peace of God in the midst of trouble is hiding his name in the needs of the people are you together with me that's how God works those seven Redemptive names will always wrap behind the local church all the seven Redemptive names were always go wrapping himself in the needs of the people that's why in the seven Church ages he says I am he that works in the seven golden cand that's where the need of the people was and that's how God was revealing him I am he that was dead but is now alive the persecution was coming on and so he wrapped himself in the ability of turning death to life in order to give the people courage that's the way God works he wrap himself in the needs of every local church are you together with me we cannot compare ourselves with the church in another area because by principle God RS in the gifts designed to deal with our local challenges so he WS in the approach of the world maybe brother Wilson maybe brother Dan or brother James or any of the ministers and it's God always allow those gifts on their side pray for them amen so the needs of the people are what shapes the local Ministry praise the Lord that's what shapes a local Ministry I don't know about other groups but your need shapes our gift you find some other people they dance five hours and preach for one hour that's okay for them are you together with me but you are fed on the word amen yes sir the Apostle in Peter was different from the Apostle in Paul because their needs were different your need shap my Ministry so the grace for the [Music] ministry pour out differently in different areas amen God works in the same way in families amen your needs are different God will reveal himself different you have different testimonies based on the different challenges you have in your families to one family is Jehovah Rafa because they've had a sequel and God has helped to recover him from the sergeant when you talk to brother he will say he gave back my daughter as one from the dead are you together with me then to another is Jehovah Gyra he has supplied the need I than God I thought my children wouldn't do their exams but miraculous miraculous brother so and so bless me with such and such he does the same in our individual lives when we start to testify here you see people flowing on different Avenues why because they are meeting God on their individual [Music] ground so God will always wrap his name in the needs of the people and because people fail to understand the way God works they start thinking that because we've got the Pam and then we've got you know uh virtues attached to [Music] churches then the people said no in Ephesus it was Faith there was no godliness they make a mistake all these seven churches every one of them had all the Seven Virtues in them but then the challenges were different in every age so now the challenge is what produced a prominent virt but all of it were there amen but the challenge like in the age ofia the church is tor apart Brothers don't regard one another preach against one another in the prominent V we need now but not that all the other vires are not here but God always RS himself in the weaknesses of the people in the challenges of the people in order to bring their Victory all the virtues have been present in every age because these Seven Virtues the inner nature of [Music] God there the inner nature of God but there was a virtue that was more prominent nevere to the needs of the are you together with me just like all of us there are some of you you don't have need of money so when we talk about Jehovah Gyra you don't understand it but then you've got problems of sickness and you always God hallelujah heavly father you are because that's your need [Music] okay praise the Lord every age had a different manifestation of Grace and so are the different ministers amen God designs them and places in them something different one from another we can never be the same listen I'll go first Peter here 4 ver 10 as every man has received the gift so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manf grace of God Amen see every man has received a gift that he has to minister bad but then this gift here you were a steward that you may use it to minister to others and now listen [Music] that's a Grace given to you but this grace is not un the Bible is calling it manold Grace amen which manifest differently Peter Apostle different John an apostle different Paul and Apostle different that's the way God works James an apostle we don't even hear that he ever went out of Jerusalem stuck right there but he was manf gifts of God and in all these gifts no man has a right to claim that his gift is greater than the other one no sir amen so every age had a different manifestation of Grace and so other different ministers with the different manifestations of the grace of God as Manifest by way of their gift so every man receives a gift in service and this gift shapes in levels of Faith depending on the nature of [Music] need where that gift ministers where the people cry more God will give more and where people cry less God will give rest are you together with me sistera the more you cry is the more God Prov if this church is not in need there's no need for God to give more he says I'll remove the cand but when the people are still need every it pushes the minister heavenly father let me search for more it's a gift and God uses it to satisfy the needs of the praise the Lord and this gifts I've told you they come right from eternity it's not something God is going to throw at you you find a man who is not himself amen this year is something else another time is coming with he's changing all the time he's not satisfied with what he is tomorrow you'll find is dancing this way he's trying just to excite the people but we are dealing with preaching stability you know the joy of a parent is to see a baby stand and then when he stands you know you can scream scared you I see my daughters just clapping inside there because this baby is standing then falls down but still very happy at least he has been able to stand they rush for their cameras you know after taking the first [Music] step not that they don't love the baby but they love the product better if you say you love this child so much each time he stands up you say it's going to fall then he will never walk are you together with me that's God he watches us we stand here and there what are you looking for you are looking for stability amen yeah you'll be athletic you can even run upstairs you don't even get scared we are talking about stability a stability that will never be blown by every wind of doctor a man who can stand up like and he says Paul called an apostle of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle amen he knows who he is praise the Lord he's not just trying to let me see whether this is my gift let me see whether this one is my gift you see Dan he can never preach like WI can bite his tongue out but he has a calling which is different that's the way God works with us there is me here I can never be you don't get me out of the pit sweating no but I have something to say that's God praise the Lord so as a young man you know that your gift is an eternal attribute of God Amen so in Romans 11 verse 29 I'm going to finish quickly don't mind he said is for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance when you believe that's not when you got the gift that gift was on the inside of you amen so gifts what are they they are the nature of character that God placed in the Gen SE for every particular God placed a nature of manifestation in you in your G before the foundation of the world and that's what a gift is so after designing the [Music] call because gifts and callings are without repentance but then he designs the well I'm a pastor but what type of Pastor am I going to be so he works around you to design how you are going to minister in your call and then when he does that he puts a conscience a conscience amen of where the holy spirit is guiding you amen so the call is an eternal nature that nature was in Moses even when he was being raised in the house of pharaoh he knew there was something different he knew that it was not supposed to be that way so that conscience becomes the burden of the ministry and the Man start saying I feel a c brother I feel I need to do some for God Amen so and the burden became so heavy on Moses he chose rather to suff Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season that's how powerful that CA sometimes it will cause you to put away profitable things in your life if they are not right with God and you say no feel my C does not allow me to be this to do that are you together with me so a call to the ministry means that the man God chose for the season purpose and location has been able to identify who he is hallelujah hallu meaning now he can be able to testify like a Paul and say to be an apost so God always knows the man but then the man must catch up with the mystery of God's will in his life God knows who you are gifts and callings are without repentance but he gives you time so that you can come to a point of recognizing Who You Are are you together with me yeah time came and Moses started feeling compassion for the children of Israel and then God began to get into that gift he gave it a burden he allowed the trials to come you know how he killed that Egyptian amen and then finds these brothers fighting among themselves and then he says why you are all Hebrew why do you fight among yourselves says oh so you want to kill one of us like you killed that EG and Moses fled because the secret was known God is leading Moses into certain situations and the purpose is to help that Ministry that gift that call to go through testing and come to it maturity are you together with me you see when we talk about if a man desire the office of a bishop he really feels he can do the work the scripture says he must not be a noice and that's what God did for Moses Moses you are not going to get into this office as long as you are still in office you are doing the work differently you are doing the work wrongly Moses R to the Wilderness and it was needful for that Ministry to mature and when he came back he was working by the instructions of God praise the Lord you see sometimes when you start you know trying to advise people you don't do this you do this he doesn't want me to pre you see what I mean so listen Ephesians 1:9 he say having made known unto us the mystery of his will every one of us will come to a spot where God makes known unto him the Myster of his because not all of us are going to be preachers but yet every one of us has a part in the body of Christ so the mystery of his will is the Revelation having made known unto us not unto me the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which has purposed in in Christ before the foundation of the world in himself so this discover where your life functions best without a f motive and wait upon the Lord are you together with me the prophet says God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or her self God's mystery amen so Paul brother Bram says was there in Arabia rented him a little building somewhere walking up and down the floor with old Scrolls he had met God he had told him what he was going to do but the mystery is white Paul is wondering how am I going to do it he says I'm not going to put my mind in it let me go into prayer seek God find his perfect will for my Ministry is that amen he was there seeking crying praying calling God God will make us Le a certain way as we pray and study the word finally we shall discover who we are in the body of Christ there's too much of superal superal me God just just called me like that so much of it me God has called me God I even don't know nobody preach to me but let us get here first Samuel 3 verse therefore Eli now you already know how uh Samuel's mother was crying to have a baby and then he cried in the Tabernacle and then you know finally she promised God that when I get a son I bring him back into the Tabernacle and that's what she did mothers are you here who have got some children from God no I just want to see mothers I'll bring them back to the Tabernacle that's the faith of Samuel's mother that I'll bring my children back to the Tabernacle listen I'm building up a thought Samuel is brought back the mothers brought him in the presence of the Lord and so the boy Samuel was always in the temple praying maybe studying the word and God started calling listen it is Eli who told Samuel how to relate to God to relate in first Samu 39 therefore Eli and Samuel said to Samuel go lie down because he has been called several times and then he keeps running to Samuel thinking Samuel is the one calling Samuel now is teaching I mean Eli is teaching Samuel to God he tells Samu go lie down and it shall be if he shall call thee thou sh for th servant here so Samuel went and La down in his place now there will always be a Ministry but never a true gift see no one is going to resist me it's not scripture regardless of how powerful your calling was there will always be a minister that will stand to guide that gift he might be a gift amen just like El but he must be there to guide you in your [Music] ABC Amen brother Bram was a messenger to the but he needed dris yes to guide him in his initial stages don't be a supernatural amen and they are talking about lights and voices because even when Cornelius prayed and the angel came down the angel sent him back to a man elishah needed Elijah much as God gave him a double portion a greater gift than what Elijah preaching stability in local churches I want you to take me to Second Timothy 2 verse there should always be you know when you feel the call what shows you a is when you [Music] stabilize under a Ministry waiting for your season and second Timothy vers one secondy verse this is Paul to Timothy thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus verse amen and the things that thou Hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also amen so it is Paul Timothy timy Faithful Men TOS must be teaching so that the man May mature in the handling of the word amen because there is no way a seed will come because the seed is life but a seed I mean that life must have a body are you together with me yeah when we look at this be here amen the be itself is the life on the ins but the be we see it's a body are you together with me so now the seed comes by the body you have to have a be to go into the ground for it to produce another be amen even you to be born you are to come by the body there must be a way Minister coming through must submit to the body of another Minister brother Bram says the seed of Christ must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born again SE of the world must come through now remember what is it Chris how does my seed come through the body even in naturally you come through the body how does the apple tree seed come come I mean through through the body seed is through the body and the church is the body of Christ hallelujah hallelujah so you must be subject in the church to the ministry to you to maintain the stability of the church praise the Lord preaching stability and we are going to take some time amen so the principle is at the time of need then God stands out and calls out because he sees that his F has a mature crop then he stands up and he says I'm looking for a man who's going to stand in the Gap because there is a need in there a in there is a need in God is saying I'm looking for a man who can stand in the G he knows he knows the man but is looking for somebody who is really dedicated and rip enough that's why he comes to Isaiah and takes him before himself cleans his lips with fire and then he says whom shall we say because you are seeing a mature so young men SS and brothers you have got a position in the body but you must St the world so that your maturity may be a result of what you have fed of God will say whom shall I say in E 22 and I sought for a man among them that should make up the Hedge and stand in the gap before me in the land praise the Lord there was a bridge somewhere maybe that's where the enemy was attacking the CH and then you know it's a bridge it's a hall it's a gap and then he says I'm looking for a man who's going to stand and seal this guy maybe that Gap needs prayer I'm looking for a man that is going to seal this Gap maybe that Gap is a song leader amen man that will be able to deliver the congregation into real atmosphere before the minister comes he says I'm looking for a man so he seeks for mature men that will not be blown by every wind of dark seasoned men men who understand the purpose of their calling men who are ripe Amen to catch the faith and the purpose they have got the vision they understand what God wants done with this men that can handle the sword like the Mighty Men of David they can preach they can teach they can give seasoned counsel that's what God is looking for I'm looking for a man am amen so adoption message I'm finishing Amen brother Bram says Bible teaching this is a great quote here Bible teaching is usually a little Treach Treach [Music] kind of walking out on the thin ice but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to bring the church to what I think to a complete understand [Music] what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is wonderful but I believe sometimes that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him a condemnation by the word then everybody in church is crying and you know they are convicted but the preaching leaves them there teaching takes them further now that you in this condition God wants to do this that is teaching brother Bram says but teaching places a man what he is and we can never rightly be able to have [Music] faith until positionally we know what we are hallelujah hallelujah he says teaching positions a man this is your position irus this is your position Mar this is your position and then the men will catch Faith related to their position he says when a man comes to that level he will have position of Faith praise the Lord so as you stud the word God begins to give you understanding of the Myster of his will for your life you discover your position in the body and then you will receive a suppor faith for that position by faith Hallelujah Hallelujah by faith Moses by faith everybody receiving Faith to support him in his position where God has pled God begins to work you in a certain CH and he says I sought for a man among them today will you be that man Whom Shall we send will you be that Isaiah and you say here I am s me you catch your position and God blesses you and God blesses with position of Faith amen God bless [Applause] you we shall continue with the teaching along creating stability do you love him when fire [Music] the making him asure can be can you get it that trust amen amen are you like Isaiah are you waiting for the call of fire when the call of fire touch the prophet you just say Lord call a fire touch my lips they unclean I don't want to be What I Am Lord change me praise the Lord yes sir are you there yeah yeah where is the song book Moses okay where are you come is it 93 93 I think two praise the lord we need the call of fire this afternoon [Music] when the call of fire touch the pro making him as pure as pure can [Music] be when the voice of God will go for [Music] us he I am s s [Music] speak my Lord speak my Lord speak and I quick to answer thee speak my Lord speak my speak and I answer Lord [Applause] say Amen here the lord of the Harvest
