[1:05:05] ourselves amen amen so let's uh turn to
[1:05:10] scriptures this
[1:05:12] morning and see what the Lord is going
[1:05:15] to
[1:05:17] do we shall turn to Psalms chapter
[1:05:24] 1 amen
[1:05:26] do we have another V in our presence
[1:05:30] here if yeah God bless you there's
[1:05:33] another brother back there his first
[1:05:36] time to be with us I pray that the Lord
[1:05:40] May bless
[1:05:41] him amen so Psalms 1 and verse
[1:05:47] one blessed is the
[1:05:50] man that WTH not in the councel of the
[1:05:54] ungodly
[1:05:57] no stands in the way of
[1:06:00] Sinners no sth in the seat of the scone
[1:06:06] food but his Delight is in the law of
[1:06:09] the
[1:06:11] Lord and his Lord does he meditate day
[1:06:15] and
[1:06:18] night and it shall be like a tree
[1:06:21] planted by the rivers of water
[1:06:27] God bringeth forth his fruit in his
[1:06:32] season his also shall not
[1:06:37] wither and whatsoever he does shall
[1:06:44] prosper do we want to
[1:06:48] prosper let's be planted by the rivers
[1:06:50] of
[1:06:52] water may the Lord reading the bless to
[1:06:55] the reading of his
[1:06:58] word uh let's resume our
[1:07:02] it amen so I have for a
[1:07:07] title I want you to listen
[1:07:10] properly we are preaching stability part
[1:07:16] eight fruit in his
[1:07:21] season
[1:07:23] amen so
[1:07:26] may the Lord be gracious to
[1:07:28] us now there is a statement of brother
[1:07:32] Bram
[1:07:34] here what we
[1:07:37] need you know is not juvenile
[1:07:42] delence no it is not juvenile
[1:07:51] delence parent delence
[1:07:55] because the parents has
[1:07:59] neglected and the whole lot of
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:03] it is the way the church never preached
[1:08:07] it what's the matter
[1:08:11] Brethren get back to the
[1:08:14] gospel preach the
[1:08:17] old time
[1:08:21] Holiness and get into the church again
[1:08:26] we must have a
[1:08:30] standard that's good we must have a
[1:08:36] standard you know when we see these
[1:08:40] schools they've got a
[1:08:43] standard you don't just go there dressed
[1:08:47] with
[1:08:48] anything you need to have a
[1:08:52] uniform you know we need to have a
[1:08:57] standard as
[1:08:59] Christians you don't just be anything
[1:09:02] and remain to be a
[1:09:05] Christian so God will change the world
[1:09:10] someday and the world will have to have
[1:09:13] a
[1:09:15] standard and brother
[1:09:17] Bram says the
[1:09:19] church must be that
[1:09:22] standard that when the people see you
[1:09:26] they are looking at a standard of what a
[1:09:28] Christian must
[1:09:31] be amen so in Psalms
[1:09:35] 1 the scripture speaks about the life of
[1:09:38] a
[1:09:40] Christian but when he comes to verse
[1:09:43] three he brings in the life of a
[1:09:48] messenger to an age the life of the
[1:09:53] messenger to the age
[1:09:56] the entire Psalms chapter
[1:09:59] one is speaking about the life of a
[1:10:03] Christian in relation to his interaction
[1:10:06] with
[1:10:09] Society but when he comes to verse
[1:10:13] three this verse
[1:10:15] here specifically addresses the
[1:10:19] messenger so verse one is the blessed
[1:10:24] man
[1:10:25] amen that WTH not in the Cel of the
[1:10:30] ungodly how many of you are blessed here
[1:10:33] today a blessed man does not walk in the
[1:10:38] cast of the
[1:10:40] ungodly now walking is taking a
[1:10:44] distance amen it's not just a matter of
[1:10:48] sitting you are taking a journey you are
[1:10:51] taking a distance
[1:10:55] but in this type of
[1:10:57] Journey which is your course of
[1:11:01] walk as a
[1:11:03] Chris in this
[1:11:06] earth God canels
[1:11:09] you that you should not take Cel of the
[1:11:15] wicked I know there are some young girls
[1:11:18] here they are looking at a
[1:11:21] marriage but sometimes they take the Cel
[1:11:25] of the
[1:11:27] wicked the young men who are looking for
[1:11:30] a
[1:11:31] wife they may take the cancel of the
[1:11:34] wicked we don't need to take the Cel of
[1:11:37] the
[1:11:39] wicked because the Christian church has
[1:11:41] got
[1:11:44] standard amen you just go into the word
[1:11:48] and you find the
[1:11:50] standard you have your Bible you have
[1:11:53] the spoken word books
[1:11:56] amen so that you don't go out back and
[1:12:01] forth to look for Cel about
[1:12:06] situations a blessed man will always
[1:12:09] take counsel from the
[1:12:12] world he will take a counsel about his
[1:12:16] family he will take a Cel about his
[1:12:20] job he will take C about his Christian
[1:12:23] Life
[1:12:26] he does not Vis Mr
[1:12:29] Google for the I mean for his Christian
[1:12:33] life amen so and if he is a
[1:12:38] minister he does not mix seeds in his
[1:12:43] farm he knows the pure seeds to s in the
[1:12:47] Christian
[1:12:50] farm he has been given faith
[1:12:55] amen and that Faith which we
[1:12:58] have is T is typed by a mastered
[1:13:04] seed and the must seed is the smallest
[1:13:08] of
[1:13:10] seeds but it cannot be
[1:13:14] hybrid are you together with me so
[1:13:18] sometimes people are looking for some
[1:13:21] Mega uh ideas to live their lives
[1:13:28] but our faith is just as small as a
[1:13:30] mustard
[1:13:33] seed but you know the nature of faith we
[1:13:38] have you know Christ compared to the
[1:13:41] Master
[1:13:43] Seat because it is
[1:13:45] small you cannot hybrid it you cannot
[1:13:49] add anything to it it always turns
[1:13:53] pure but once you plant it it grows into
[1:13:58] a very big
[1:13:59] tree and all the clean birs of the
[1:14:04] air will want to come and roast in that
[1:14:08] tree hallelujah hallelujah when you have
[1:14:11] your little Mustard Seed
[1:14:16] F and it's planted in the good ground of
[1:14:19] your
[1:14:21] soul and watered by the spirit of Christ
[1:14:27] it makes you grow
[1:14:30] up into a man of great
[1:14:33] influence so that all the clean birs of
[1:14:36] the
[1:14:38] air like doves and
[1:14:41] Eagles you know they come and Roo in
[1:14:44] that
[1:14:45] tree you are going to become the anchor
[1:14:48] of
[1:14:50] fellowship and like we said the other
[1:14:54] Sunday you become a
[1:14:56] pillar in the house of God Amen a pillar
[1:15:01] it supports the
[1:15:02] structure the super
[1:15:05] structure connects you to the
[1:15:08] foundation it Bears the
[1:15:11] weight and I want to have those kind of
[1:15:15] Christians that are
[1:15:17] pillars and they've got enough
[1:15:22] muscle to Bear the super structure
[1:15:26] that you have a Christian
[1:15:28] here but is uh uh the kind that can
[1:15:32] really produce a positive
[1:15:38] influence amen and you know he happy
[1:15:41] being a
[1:15:44] pillar amen so this blessed man
[1:15:48] here does not stand in the way of
[1:15:51] Sinners with
[1:15:53] Sinners because a sinner is the one who
[1:15:57] does not uh have the confidence of the
[1:16:03] word and because he has no confidence in
[1:16:06] the
[1:16:07] word then he ends up bearing evil
[1:16:12] fruit because the word which would be
[1:16:15] his
[1:16:17] fortification amen he doesn't have
[1:16:20] confidence in
[1:16:21] it amen praise the Lord
[1:16:25] hallelujah hallelujah that's a blessed
[1:16:28] man he doesn't go with
[1:16:31] people who don't have confidence in the
[1:16:36] world we need to surround
[1:16:39] ourselves with positive
[1:16:42] men who believe the word when the word
[1:16:47] speaks they can say
[1:16:49] Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah so a
[1:16:52] blessed man
[1:16:54] has not Bas under negative
[1:16:58] influence amen because we have a man who
[1:17:02] has
[1:17:03] blessed but he affected
[1:17:07] himself you know he negatively affected
[1:17:12] himself by sitting around with
[1:17:15] men of negative
[1:17:17] influence he has been given to
[1:17:20] us as an example that you can be a
[1:17:24] Christian
[1:17:26] a positive
[1:17:27] believer but you can flock
[1:17:30] together with men of negative
[1:17:33] influence and they can affect
[1:17:36] you this man is
[1:17:39] Isaiah amen and this man
[1:17:42] believed he had a gift of God and indeed
[1:17:46] he had that gift of
[1:17:48] God but and he also
[1:17:51] thought that his life was perfect
[1:17:55] until God allowed him to stand in the
[1:18:01] presence of that scanning light of his
[1:18:05] presence you know God
[1:18:08] himself is a fire is a light is a
[1:18:14] scanner that when you stand before him
[1:18:18] you are just
[1:18:20] transparent everything you have done
[1:18:24] which he the side it just become very
[1:18:27] open to
[1:18:29] you so when Isaiah went into that
[1:18:32] presence he was very surprised he didn't
[1:18:36] know he was that kind of un evil
[1:18:40] man amen so there is
[1:18:43] something that takes over your normal
[1:18:48] judgment amen when you stay in negative
[1:18:52] community
[1:18:55] when you go with men who don't have
[1:18:58] confidence in the
[1:19:00] world they smear their influence upon
[1:19:04] you and that influence blind
[1:19:09] you you keep thinking you are okay with
[1:19:13] God when the honest light you are
[1:19:17] not so
[1:19:19] God you know one time took his
[1:19:22] man his name is
[1:19:25] Isaiah and picked him from the Society
[1:19:28] of the negative
[1:19:31] people who had dir
[1:19:34] lips and brought him before
[1:19:38] himself I want tell you one thing but if
[1:19:42] you come from
[1:19:43] God God can never lose
[1:19:46] you at a certain
[1:19:49] time in life he'll pick you up and bring
[1:19:54] you in the presence of his scanning
[1:19:58] life and that's what he did to
[1:20:00] Isaiah and Isaiah said why is
[1:20:05] me I
[1:20:08] am because I am a man of unclean
[1:20:13] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[1:20:15] people of unclean
[1:20:18] lips for my eyes I've seen the
[1:20:22] king the Lord of host
[1:20:26] amen so all the things he
[1:20:29] said the things he said about the
[1:20:32] Brotherhood the things he said about
[1:20:36] people they all came back to him so
[1:20:40] dwelling in the midst of dat
[1:20:43] lips amen gave Isaiah similar dat
[1:20:48] lips when they speak you get tempted to
[1:20:52] say something also
[1:20:55] and Isaiah found out that he had said a
[1:20:58] lot of dirty things in his
[1:21:01] life and I want tell you that the tongue
[1:21:06] here is a powerful
[1:21:10] weapon it can set
[1:21:12] fire on a
[1:21:14] forest just like a little
[1:21:18] [Laughter]
[1:21:21] Marl you light it just small put it on a
[1:21:27] leaf it can burn an entire
[1:21:32] forest and that's how James defines the
[1:21:36] tong amen so we need to guard the
[1:21:41] tong
[1:21:43] amen I mean
[1:21:46] t can defile the hearts of the
[1:21:50] people and then you find out that this
[1:21:54] heart
[1:21:55] could even permanently be
[1:21:59] affected because somebody said
[1:22:03] something so Isaiah could only come
[1:22:07] clean when he came before the throne of
[1:22:11] grace are we before the throne of grace
[1:22:14] this
[1:22:15] morning amen and he cried out because
[1:22:20] evil
[1:22:21] [Music]
[1:22:22] company had affected these garments of
[1:22:27] righteousness so Isaiah needed a call of
[1:22:32] fire to clean his
[1:22:34] mouth because that
[1:22:37] mouth is
[1:22:43] contagious
[1:22:48] amen you see there is only one
[1:22:51] thing that when a man
[1:22:55] has a dirtty
[1:22:57] mouth the only way you can keep company
[1:23:01] with
[1:23:03] him is either you also pick that
[1:23:09] mouth if you can take the d
[1:23:12] m then you part from that d
[1:23:17] m because it's a contagious
[1:23:21] disease You Begin by feeling checked
[1:23:24] when you say
[1:23:28] things and then you come to a time when
[1:23:32] you don't care what you
[1:23:34] say but a blessed
[1:23:36] man should design his
[1:23:40] life around the
[1:23:43] world he should
[1:23:45] avoid the seat of the
[1:23:50] SC and he should Delight in the love of
[1:23:52] the Lord
[1:23:55] and meditate there in day and
[1:23:58] night amen so the mind of a
[1:24:01] man who has found favor with
[1:24:05] God should be preoccupied by the
[1:24:10] word that man has found favor with
[1:24:13] God a blessed man is not one who's got
[1:24:18] lots of
[1:24:20] money amen a blessed man is man who has
[1:24:26] found fav before God that's a blessed
[1:24:30] man you want to M the
[1:24:33] favor amen that gave you eternal
[1:24:37] life then you must guard
[1:24:40] yourself Hallelujah hallu but when the
[1:24:43] psalmist comes to verse
[1:24:46] three God introduces to the way of the
[1:24:50] junctional man
[1:24:54] amen a
[1:24:56] messenger in whom the will of God for
[1:24:59] the age is
[1:25:02] hidden amen so when we are moving the
[1:25:06] journey back into eternity where we came
[1:25:10] from we come to a point of a
[1:25:14] junction and whenever we get into a
[1:25:17] junction God does not allow his
[1:25:21] children to guess which way to go
[1:25:25] in that
[1:25:26] Junction he always places a junction of
[1:25:31] man an anointed
[1:25:35] man Noah was a junctional
[1:25:38] man he could not God could not let the
[1:25:41] people
[1:25:44] guess and then Moses was a junction of
[1:25:48] man the people had
[1:25:51] cried and God had heard people had
[1:25:55] labored and God had see when time comes
[1:25:59] to
[1:26:00] that God always puts a
[1:26:04] junction so along the move of the
[1:26:08] church all the way from
[1:26:10] pent to the change of our body when the
[1:26:14] church is taken out of the
[1:26:16] earth God has plac seven Junction
[1:26:22] men at the seven Junction of
[1:26:26] time and these men here they hide the
[1:26:30] will of
[1:26:33] God Amen the way they live their
[1:26:37] Liv is the
[1:26:39] revelation of how God wants the men to
[1:26:44] walk in this Junction of
[1:26:47] life God hides in that
[1:26:50] man the Revelation to the ede
[1:26:54] are you together with me because the
[1:26:57] life lived by the
[1:26:59] messenger is the revelation of the
[1:27:02] character of
[1:27:04] God for that particular age Hallelujah
[1:27:08] hallu and so when the p is
[1:27:14] writing he talked about verse three here
[1:27:18] and he says and he shall be like a
[1:27:23] tree Ed by the rivers of
[1:27:26] water amen that bringeth forth his
[1:27:32] fruit in his
[1:27:34] season
[1:27:37] his shall not wither and whatsoever he
[1:27:41] doth he shall
[1:27:43] prosper hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[1:27:46] Lord there are so many great things in
[1:27:49] that
[1:27:50] verse he shall be like a river I mean
[1:27:54] like a
[1:27:55] tree planted by the rivers of
[1:28:00] water amen all the
[1:28:04] flows of the
[1:28:06] virt of the Holy Spirit you know goes
[1:28:10] through his
[1:28:12] life amen now here there
[1:28:16] again amen and bringeth forth his
[1:28:21] fruit in his season there are two his
[1:28:27] here his
[1:28:29] fruit whose fruit God's
[1:28:33] fruit in the
[1:28:36] season of that
[1:28:39] messenger are you together with me he
[1:28:42] stands there to tap into the
[1:28:47] fruit of that season and once it Taps it
[1:28:52] it positively affect his
[1:28:55] life that it can
[1:28:58] influence the people at the junction of
[1:29:02] time to know how to live their
[1:29:05] lives oh praise the Lord so today I'm
[1:29:10] going to be very fundamental in my
[1:29:14] preacher because I want to talk about
[1:29:17] the
[1:29:18] fruit of the
[1:29:22] season the must be a fruit of the
[1:29:26] Season by their fruits you know
[1:29:30] them amen there must be something
[1:29:35] because the word is a
[1:29:37] SE and once you saw it it has to bring
[1:29:41] forth a
[1:29:42] fruit but what kind of fruit should the
[1:29:46] message of the
[1:29:48] hour bring out of
[1:29:52] us he
[1:29:54] fruit in his
[1:29:56] season amen he's planted by the rivers
[1:30:00] of
[1:30:02] water so this man here becomes a
[1:30:06] parable to the age are you together with
[1:30:10] me he becomes a
[1:30:12] parable to the age the way he lives his
[1:30:16] life is a parable to the ede and you
[1:30:22] take a church
[1:30:24] that's always in arguments and
[1:30:30] stewing just remember they are not they
[1:30:34] are in a
[1:30:35] desert and out of
[1:30:39] water that one no we are not going to
[1:30:43] accept brother says you just know that
[1:30:46] church is in a
[1:30:49] desert is not planted by the rivers of
[1:30:52] water
[1:30:54] because it's not natural
[1:30:57] water but the virtues of
[1:31:00] Life flows through that
[1:31:04] church amen and it does not have
[1:31:08] time to steal to argue to preach about
[1:31:13] other people there's too much in the
[1:31:17] world to cover that we don't have time
[1:31:20] to deal with outside stuff
[1:31:26] amen a church that's long I mean that's
[1:31:29] loving and
[1:31:31] humble and
[1:31:33] flexible and Fs and goes with the word
[1:31:36] of
[1:31:38] God remember they are living by the
[1:31:43] fountain that never dries up that's the
[1:31:47] church amen so this man here amen shows
[1:31:53] us how
[1:31:56] where this particular
[1:31:59] verse verse three shows us how where the
[1:32:03] junction of man is
[1:32:08] planted how it would help
[1:32:11] him to bring forth God's
[1:32:14] fruit in season because himself as a
[1:32:19] man would need that fruit
[1:32:22] too so for him to bring forth
[1:32:26] fruit he has to be planted by the rivers
[1:32:29] of
[1:32:31] water so where he
[1:32:35] planted amen shows us how
[1:32:41] important that he stands in that
[1:32:44] spot so that the rivers of
[1:32:48] water which is the very life of God
[1:32:52] himself would flow through
[1:32:56] him to the
[1:32:58] generation without which he cannot bear
[1:33:04] fruit in his
[1:33:06] season hallelujah hallelujah is planted
[1:33:09] in the right
[1:33:10] place that brings forth fruit in
[1:33:15] season so I want you to read this
[1:33:17] scripture this
[1:33:19] way and he shall be like a tree
[1:33:24] planted by the rivers of
[1:33:27] water that brings forth God's
[1:33:31] fruit in the messenger
[1:33:35] season and
[1:33:38] his amen shall not
[1:33:42] wither and whatsoever he does shall
[1:33:46] prosper and then transfer
[1:33:50] that and put it in your own life if you
[1:33:54] are standing by the rivers of
[1:33:56] water Hallelujah the right
[1:34:00] fruit will come out of you in
[1:34:07] season because you were
[1:34:10] stationed by the rivers of
[1:34:13] water and when temper
[1:34:15] comes then the stream of temperance
[1:34:19] comes
[1:34:21] through because that's the season
[1:34:26] amen sometimes when you need to a
[1:34:31] brother then the re brotherly kindness
[1:34:34] comes
[1:34:36] through and you just don't know you just
[1:34:40] a brother I had gone too far with that
[1:34:44] man but something changed
[1:34:47] me are you together with me you are
[1:34:50] planted by the rivers of water
[1:34:55] and at the right season you bear the
[1:34:58] right
[1:35:01] fruit amen are you together with me so
[1:35:06] every
[1:35:07] AG had a form of
[1:35:09] fruit to bring forth like at the edge of
[1:35:14] Paul had a form of fruit to bring
[1:35:18] forth and the
[1:35:20] messenger was the fruit example for
[1:35:26] Ed because when he stood in the
[1:35:29] channel of the FL of the Holy
[1:35:33] Spirit then the Holy Spirit positively
[1:35:36] affected the life of that
[1:35:38] man and that man began to Bear the
[1:35:43] fruit that God
[1:35:45] wanted that age to
[1:35:48] bear so the revelation of the
[1:35:51] word and the way that messenger lived
[1:35:54] his
[1:35:55] life was a teaching to the
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:02] people
[1:36:03] look when anybody
[1:36:07] came and trying to say
[1:36:11] something the Disciples of that
[1:36:13] time they only said you don't speak
[1:36:19] like are you together with me and that
[1:36:23] was
[1:36:24] enough his life his understanding his
[1:36:29] way of
[1:36:30] life teaching to the
[1:36:35] people amen listen to what brother Bram
[1:36:39] says
[1:36:40] here now he shall bring forth his
[1:36:45] fruit in his
[1:36:50] season
[1:36:51] watch E he
[1:36:54] is the personal pronoun
[1:36:57] there it is his
[1:37:00] fruit God's
[1:37:02] fruit in the season the prophet is
[1:37:05] bringing
[1:37:07] it it will be in the prophet
[1:37:12] season God's
[1:37:14] fruit In God's Time by The Prophet
[1:37:19] season he shall bring forth his fruit in
[1:37:22] this season
[1:37:25] see if there isn't two he
[1:37:29] there bring forth God's
[1:37:32] fruit the season that the messenger is
[1:37:36] ordained to
[1:37:38] come he bring forth
[1:37:41] those now remember the messenger that
[1:37:45] brings the fruit of
[1:37:47] God will bring it in God's
[1:37:51] season in the season of the
[1:37:54] bringer he bring forth his fruit in his
[1:37:58] season and this fruit cannot
[1:38:02] wither is got predestinated fruit in
[1:38:06] there it can't destroy it because it's
[1:38:10] predestinated
[1:38:13] fruit hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't
[1:38:17] wither you cannot say
[1:38:19] now another fruit is coming instead of
[1:38:22] this
[1:38:25] so God brings this
[1:38:27] man in God's Own
[1:38:31] season so that he can
[1:38:34] stand as a teaching
[1:38:37] life to the rest of the
[1:38:39] body are you together with me
[1:38:43] Mal is our teaching
[1:38:47] life amen so he stands
[1:38:51] out and brings forth the
[1:38:55] of the church are you together with me a
[1:38:59] church is not somebody saying I believe
[1:39:03] Jesus to be my personal Savior and you
[1:39:07] stop there there must be a
[1:39:12] standard are you together with me so God
[1:39:16] uses this
[1:39:18] message to bring forth the
[1:39:21] standard he bring
[1:39:24] to the Forefront the fruit of
[1:39:27] God for the age he steps forth to
[1:39:31] manifest that
[1:39:33] fruit as a standard of life on the
[1:39:38] edge and that fruit is
[1:39:46] Everlasting did you hear
[1:39:49] that amen you see what I'm trying to say
[1:39:53] is that when he comes with the
[1:39:56] world the world produces its
[1:40:01] life in the Believers and that's the
[1:40:07] standard so I will take you to the first
[1:40:11] church
[1:40:13] age to give you an example here in
[1:40:16] Revelation 2
[1:40:19] verse1 he says to the angel of the
[1:40:23] church church ofus
[1:40:30] right these
[1:40:32] things says
[1:40:36] he
[1:40:38] now he is introducing
[1:40:44] himself the one who is speaking to this
[1:40:48] church is being described
[1:40:54] as one that holds the Seven Stars in his
[1:40:57] right
[1:40:59] hand and walks in the midst of the seven
[1:41:03] golden
[1:41:05] candles and then he stops there that's
[1:41:09] not all that Christ is hallelujah
[1:41:13] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is more
[1:41:16] than
[1:41:18] that but what is revealing
[1:41:23] of
[1:41:24] himself is the floor of
[1:41:28] virtue the
[1:41:31] river that the church would need in that
[1:41:39] age are you together with me there is
[1:41:43] more to
[1:41:46] him but he says at this
[1:41:49] time what they need is to know the one
[1:41:53] who is holding the Seven
[1:41:56] Stars in his right hand and walking in
[1:41:59] the midst of
[1:42:02] theen it was the beginning of the
[1:42:09] Church of the New
[1:42:13] Testament because
[1:42:16] John John in
[1:42:19] Revelation he's having a preview
[1:42:23] of the church this is the church the
[1:42:27] beginning of it and the winding up of
[1:42:30] it and he's looking all
[1:42:34] through to the
[1:42:36] end until he sees New
[1:42:40] Jerusalem coming from heaven like a
[1:42:43] bride adored for her
[1:42:46] husband so John starts at the beginning
[1:42:51] here and he sees all the way to the
[1:42:55] end are you together with me so now at
[1:42:59] the
[1:43:00] beginning is seeing the beginning of the
[1:43:05] church that the one who has
[1:43:08] come as the Lord of
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:12] lords he has seven
[1:43:15] stars because there are seven
[1:43:19] Junctions to the church ages
[1:43:23] so now we held Seven
[1:43:26] Stars and these Stars here according to
[1:43:30] Revelation chapter
[1:43:32] one and verse
[1:43:34] 20 there were the
[1:43:36] angels to the seven
[1:43:40] churches are you together with me now
[1:43:43] listen friends the
[1:43:46] angel is a
[1:43:48] messenger hallelujah hallelujah are you
[1:43:51] together with me now that's what the
[1:43:54] word angel
[1:43:56] means messenger if is an
[1:44:00] messenger is caring a message from
[1:44:04] God if he an angel from
[1:44:07] heaven he also has a message but those
[1:44:10] angels from Heaven they got
[1:44:14] wings but the men on
[1:44:16] Earth who are anointed to bring a
[1:44:20] special
[1:44:21] message to the
[1:44:24] they are referred to as
[1:44:27] Angels hallelujah hallelujah so there
[1:44:29] were seven
[1:44:31] angels Seven Stars in his right hand
[1:44:36] John is trying to tell the church that
[1:44:40] all these
[1:44:42] Messengers that will come through the
[1:44:45] Journey of the
[1:44:46] church will be under Divine
[1:44:50] protection hallelujah hallelujah we in
[1:44:53] the right hand of
[1:44:54] power in the right hand of
[1:44:57] authority hallelujah hallelujah and when
[1:45:00] this messenger
[1:45:02] comes he Bears the fruit of his age and
[1:45:07] the same
[1:45:09] anointing that has kept him and worked
[1:45:12] through him again goes over Tak over the
[1:45:17] enti
[1:45:18] church are you together with me so what
[1:45:21] happens now that the entire church is
[1:45:25] under Divine
[1:45:27] protection hallelujah hallelujah do you
[1:45:30] know friend that you are under his
[1:45:33] presence you are under Divine protection
[1:45:36] you are under Divine
[1:45:38] Guidance the life of a
[1:45:41] messenger is a teaching to the
[1:45:44] people where he is in the right hand of
[1:45:48] God the church is in the right hand of
[1:45:51] God hallelujah huah so John in the first
[1:45:56] CH he says the Seven Stars in the right
[1:46:00] hand of God oh praise God
[1:46:06] working through the seven
[1:46:09] candlesticks and those are the
[1:46:12] churches God himself Works in his
[1:46:16] church oh hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:46:20] there's no Prophet Within
[1:46:23] there's no pop with him there's no
[1:46:26] Cardinal with him there's no Bishop with
[1:46:28] him there's no pastor with him he is the
[1:46:33] author of the
[1:46:34] church so he walks in the church how
[1:46:38] does he walk in the
[1:46:40] church in the first church
[1:46:43] age he threw the St
[1:46:46] up and that was Paul and Paul started to
[1:46:50] shine to the edge
[1:46:53] the people were walking in the lights of
[1:46:56] that star which was the light of God
[1:46:59] that was God in the seven churches when
[1:47:03] that light became
[1:47:05] deep up another one and God by a Divine
[1:47:10] Light in the life of a messenger Hees to
[1:47:14] guide the church are you together with
[1:47:17] me that's the way God
[1:47:20] works amen some of the people people are
[1:47:24] trying to pray that they may hear some
[1:47:27] voices to know that God is with them you
[1:47:31] don't need no voices you just need the
[1:47:34] word that's all you
[1:47:36] need oh Hallelujah huah amen so what
[1:47:41] happens
[1:47:43] here is that God would dig from his
[1:47:48] nature to identify the character the age
[1:47:52] needed
[1:47:56] to overcome the challenge in the
[1:47:59] ede and then he would announce that
[1:48:03] character and then he would offer that
[1:48:07] character to the
[1:48:10] church hallelujah hallelujah he
[1:48:12] announces it I am the one who is holding
[1:48:17] the
[1:48:18] Stars I am the one who is working in the
[1:48:22] church
[1:48:23] he has announced the
[1:48:25] character that whatsoever messenger
[1:48:28] comes that will be my
[1:48:33] voice amen so this introduction of
[1:48:38] Christ to the Saints of the
[1:48:42] age was
[1:48:44] relevant to their daily
[1:48:48] work amen so Christ in never
[1:48:53] was the
[1:48:54] Overcomer hallelujah hallelujah it's not
[1:48:58] the
[1:48:59] people it is Christ who was the
[1:49:03] Overcomer Hallelujah in your daily
[1:49:07] walk Christ is the
[1:49:10] Overcomer amen he says I know you have
[1:49:14] got a little
[1:49:16] strength but I have set before you an
[1:49:19] Open Door which no man can close
[1:49:23] God opens every door in your
[1:49:26] life God is the Overcomer in your
[1:49:30] life amen he just
[1:49:33] comes and hides himself as a
[1:49:39] special that's you being
[1:49:45] aeed by the rivers of
[1:49:49] water that a particular anointing
[1:49:53] necessary for you to
[1:49:55] overcome to come and take over your
[1:50:00] life amen so Christ in every age was the
[1:50:05] Overcomer he still the Overcomer in my
[1:50:09] age the overc in every individual
[1:50:12] life he gives you the
[1:50:15] VT to live
[1:50:17] by amen I'll go back to the verse I love
[1:50:21] so much
[1:50:31] here is our love made
[1:50:38] perect that we may have boldness in the
[1:50:43] day of
[1:50:46] judgment now many people
[1:50:50] think of the judg
[1:50:55] day but
[1:51:00] here says that
[1:51:03] judgment must start in the house of
[1:51:08] God in the body of the
[1:51:11] church are you together with me the
[1:51:14] trials you go
[1:51:16] through the
[1:51:18] persecutions the trying of your faith
[1:51:25] amen you are standing in
[1:51:28] judgment and what's being
[1:51:31] judge is not you but the nature of
[1:51:36] sin that's in you being
[1:51:41] Jud he says our
[1:51:45] boldness to
[1:51:48] stand in the day of
[1:51:51] judgment because as he
[1:51:54] is we are in this
[1:51:57] world hallelujah hallelujah but we will
[1:52:01] be but we
[1:52:05] are what he is we are not we will be but
[1:52:12] we
[1:52:13] are how can we
[1:52:16] be except that the scripture
[1:52:22] comes
[1:52:24] alive when he says when
[1:52:27] Christ who is our life shall be revealed
[1:52:32] so the life you
[1:52:33] live on the
[1:52:35] inside is
[1:52:39] Christ amen you see I I want you to see
[1:52:44] this
[1:52:46] that Christ in you the hope of
[1:52:50] glory it can't
[1:52:53] you you can't
[1:52:55] overcome and you cannot even live the
[1:52:59] life the scriptures tell you
[1:53:03] to unless you
[1:53:06] stood by the rivers of
[1:53:10] water that
[1:53:14] anointing and as the anointing flows
[1:53:17] through
[1:53:19] you then that's your victory
[1:53:26] so our boldness in the of
[1:53:29] judgment which in our case is
[1:53:33] now that
[1:53:35] boldness must rest in the
[1:53:38] truth that we have allowed
[1:53:41] Christ to live his life
[1:53:44] here by the instrumentality of the
[1:53:47] members of our
[1:53:49] B to an
[1:53:51] extent we are what he is the
[1:53:56] ministry and the later becomes
[1:54:02] him did you hear that becomes
[1:54:06] him
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:11] unfortunately some people looking
[1:54:18] at but down on the inside
[1:54:22] there is a life and that life keeps
[1:54:26] coming
[1:54:28] through until it comes to the St of a
[1:54:33] perfect and becomes a rupturable
[1:54:37] life amen so
[1:54:41] Christ holds the Seven Stars in right in
[1:54:44] his right
[1:54:46] hand and these Seven
[1:54:49] Stars with seven different
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:56] anointings amen of the one
[1:55:00] God and in Revelation
[1:55:03] 5 these
[1:55:05] anointings were referred to as seven
[1:55:11] spirits that God has seven
[1:55:15] spirits and some people say yes seven
[1:55:18] spirits but let's go to Revelation 5
[1:55:24] verse I want tell you you are
[1:55:27] this not
[1:55:29] you amen but Christ in you will take up
[1:55:33] every
[1:55:35] Cheng bring you to victory your
[1:55:38] character will to
[1:55:40] Victory
[1:55:42] amen Revelation
[1:55:45] 56 and I
[1:55:47] beheld and in the midst of the
[1:55:50] throne and of the
[1:55:53] beast and in the midst of the
[1:55:56] elders stood a
[1:55:59] lamb as it had been
[1:56:03] slain hallelujah hallelujah finished
[1:56:07] work of
[1:56:08] Calvary having seven
[1:56:11] HS which HS is the hiding of
[1:56:16] power and seven
[1:56:18] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[1:56:23] forth into the
[1:56:26] earth now to begin
[1:56:28] with we
[1:56:34] know these are not teaching a new and
[1:56:41] contr joh
[1:56:45] 44 which says God is a
[1:56:52] and of course one
[1:56:54] Spirit but this you know here is like
[1:56:58] First Corinthians chapter
[1:57:02] 12 8
[1:57:05] 11 where we find one
[1:57:09] fruit manifesting himself in N
[1:57:15] ways he doesn't say the fruits of the
[1:57:19] spirit he says the fruit of the
[1:57:23] spirit so in here you best understand it
[1:57:28] like looking at an
[1:57:31] orang one but there are sever slices in
[1:57:37] there are you together with me so now is
[1:57:41] God in the N gifts of the holy
[1:57:46] spirit he calls it the gift so we know
[1:57:50] that the seven spirits of God
[1:57:54] means it is one
[1:57:56] Spirit and the Same Spirit coming in the
[1:58:00] Sevenfold
[1:58:04] manner amen because you are seven
[1:58:08] stars seven
[1:58:10] Messengers and every one of these
[1:58:13] Messengers has a totally independent
[1:58:19] anointing different from another
[1:58:21] messenger
[1:58:23] and now when Paul John is
[1:58:25] looking he sees seven
[1:58:28] spirits he
[1:58:30] says the anointing
[1:58:35] upon different
[1:58:37] from even is
[1:58:40] different is different and even is
[1:58:45] different even wle is
[1:58:48] different and he says seven spirits but
[1:58:52] it's actually one
[1:58:54] spirit manifesting in seven different
[1:58:59] forms so are you together with me so now
[1:59:03] in Revelation
[1:59:05] 45 these same Spirits I called lamps of
[1:59:13] fire burning before the
[1:59:15] Lord so the next thing here is he
[1:59:20] walks in the m
[1:59:23] of the
[1:59:25] seven amen so this
[1:59:29] life kept filtering into the
[1:59:33] church as planted
[1:59:40] in by the seven
[1:59:42] men that Carri the
[1:59:45] anointing hallelujah
[1:59:49] hallelujah do you understand that now
[1:59:52] when
[1:59:54] planted whatever he
[1:59:57] planted the
[1:59:59] way and now when it grew to
[2:00:03] maturity then we've go to the next
[2:00:07] one also
[2:00:09] planted whatever planted was added to
[2:00:15] what way now in our
[2:00:19] time Hallelujah in our time we at the
[2:00:23] end we in the seventh Church Age We have
[2:00:27] got the
[2:00:28] fullness of what the seven spirits
[2:00:31] was hallelujah hallelujah no wonder in
[2:00:34] our
[2:00:35] age comes the
[2:00:38] Revelation the Myster of the
[2:00:40] God because the fullness was now
[2:00:47] here hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah
[2:00:52] oh Hallelujah therefore
[2:00:53] Paul was the
[2:00:56] planter of the first
[2:00:59] churches the seeds of revelation God had
[2:01:02] given
[2:01:03] him the scripture say they set for the
[2:01:15] [Applause]
[2:01:18] foundation you cannot do anything
[2:01:24] without going back to the apostolic
[2:01:29] found what are you
[2:01:32] building you have to go back to the
[2:01:36] foundation let's go to
[2:01:49] First any computer anges are
[2:01:53] different when he's doing his programs
[2:01:56] Five May mean
[2:01:59] 10 so verse 10
[2:02:02] here Paul
[2:02:06] says according to the grace of
[2:02:10] God which is given to
[2:02:14] me meaning that he was given the
[2:02:19] seed as a wise master
[2:02:23] build I have laid the
[2:02:27] foundation and another
[2:02:31] build but let
[2:02:34] every take build
[2:02:39] there I'm being so fundamental this
[2:02:44] morning because I'm trying to bring
[2:02:47] forth the fruit in
[2:02:50] season because every seed
[2:02:54] planted must bring forth
[2:02:56] fruit what must the Malachi for seed
[2:03:00] bring
[2:03:04] forth okay so God gives the message of
[2:03:08] the
[2:03:09] grace to open the souls of
[2:03:13] men to the word of God in the
[2:03:16] earth okay now listen to this quote here
[2:03:21] now we can
[2:03:23] that Jesus
[2:03:24] Christ is revealing
[2:03:27] himself Through the
[2:03:30] Ages by his Spirit In The
[2:03:35] Messengers God reveals
[2:03:38] himself to the edge Through The
[2:03:41] Messengers they become a teaching
[2:03:47] life did you hear that the Messengers
[2:03:52] become a teaching
[2:03:54] life to
[2:03:58] thege so they are as Moses was to the
[2:04:02] children of
[2:04:04] Israel he has had the Revelation for
[2:04:07] [Music]
[2:04:09] his so each messenger had God's
[2:04:13] revelation and
[2:04:16] Min for that
[2:04:19] day thus when we see the m
[2:04:22] MERS in his right
[2:04:25] hand we see the
[2:04:27] Lord identifying
[2:04:31] himself with these men and granting them
[2:04:35] his
[2:04:37] [Music]
[2:04:38] power did you hear that granting them
[2:04:42] his
[2:04:44] power and that's the
[2:04:47] victory for
[2:04:49] the god not send a powerless
[2:04:58] message because it's the
[2:05:01] Overcomer how will the church
[2:05:04] overcome without the indwelling
[2:05:07] Christ how can you
[2:05:09] overcome your
[2:05:11] weaknesses without an indwelling
[2:05:14] Christ how can you overcome unless you
[2:05:18] decide to
[2:05:20] surrender certain
[2:05:22] your
[2:05:23] life father it never
[2:05:30] be then he grants you the
[2:05:36] power shall we take a decision this
[2:05:40] morning amen it's not
[2:05:44] enough that he has Associated himself
[2:05:46] with the World Church
[2:05:53] which we
[2:05:54] saw when he was standing among the seven
[2:05:58] golden
[2:06:02] lamp is it even
[2:06:05] enough that we see the five Ministry
[2:06:14] of Apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[2:06:20] pastors for each
[2:06:22] age the pastor I mean the church
[2:06:30] goes in
[2:06:32] every
[2:06:34] age the church goes as and not just the
[2:06:40] later but the CLG
[2:06:44] group shepher are
[2:06:48] wrong as well as sheep
[2:06:53] then
[2:06:54] God brings himself on the
[2:06:57] sea as the chief
[2:07:01] sheer Amen in the ministries of these
[2:07:03] seven
[2:07:05] men to lead these people back to the
[2:07:08] truth and the Abundant power of that
[2:07:13] truth God is in his people all his
[2:07:18] people so if any man has the spirit of
[2:07:22] Christ he none of his and he is the
[2:07:27] word that would be the word recognized
[2:07:32] in the
[2:07:35] people but he has placed a special
[2:07:40] leadership in this men of his own
[2:07:45] choosing through the determined C of his
[2:07:48] will
[2:07:51] they appear
[2:07:53] once in each Edge it's the same
[2:07:58] spirit in
[2:08:00] them
[2:08:02] okay so now the messenger appears on the
[2:08:08] edge what
[2:08:13] next
[2:08:14] because we see in Revelation chapter 1
[2:08:23] that Jesus reveals
[2:08:26] himself to
[2:08:28] John on the
[2:08:31] of and then tells
[2:08:35] John to send
[2:08:39] messages to the seven
[2:08:42] churches which
[2:08:45] were
[2:08:46] by these
[2:08:49] Messengers then he would get the man of
[2:08:53] to the angel of
[2:08:57] Ephesus so now the men would come to
[2:09:01] check on the ministry of
[2:09:04] John and I mean to check on the life of
[2:09:08] John because he was on the
[2:09:15] island because it was a problem to the
[2:09:18] Roman Church I mean to the Roman
[2:09:23] Empire they tried to kill him they
[2:09:26] couldn't die they tried to boil him in
[2:09:30] O
[2:09:36] he and he was there
[2:09:38] alone there were all kind of very
[2:09:42] poisonous
[2:09:45] reptiles and they knew he would
[2:09:48] die but he couldn't die
[2:09:53] God instead started
[2:09:55] visiting and these men
[2:09:58] here so
[2:10:01] much love those men loved so
[2:10:04] much that they wouldn't fear the
[2:10:06] reptiles of
[2:10:09] the they would go there to check on
[2:10:13] him and then God would
[2:10:16] know the man who is
[2:10:18] coming is from Ephesus and then he says
[2:10:23] right are you together with me so then
[2:10:26] he would write as the man goes
[2:10:30] back he goes with the
[2:10:33] message back to the church in
[2:10:37] Ephesus now the pastor sat
[2:10:41] down the Apostle sat down the sat down
[2:10:46] everybody sat down the messenger was now
[2:10:52] voice to that
[2:10:55] church are you together with me yes sir
[2:10:59] okay now let's look at the
[2:11:02] principle second
[2:11:04] Timothy chapter 2 verse one you love
[2:11:09] Bible
[2:11:11] teaching that's how you are going to
[2:11:14] stabilize in your Christian
[2:11:17] work God bless you
[2:11:20] brother you now under my
[2:11:25] command amen he knows you know because
[2:11:29] you
[2:11:36] remember whatever it is he said you
[2:11:40] don't need to come to my
[2:11:43] house I'm a man under
[2:11:46] Authority if I say
[2:11:49] go he goes if I come he comes because
[2:11:54] he's under
[2:11:57] Authority amen what's the authority of
[2:12:00] brother
[2:12:05] here when he says
[2:12:07] go no man can disobey his
[2:12:13] voice amen and so this man here he also
[2:12:19] went and
[2:12:22] the
[2:12:23] command
[2:12:28] every and
[2:12:30] things changed
[2:12:32] instantly in the
[2:12:35] church
[2:12:38] listen second Timothy
[2:12:41] 2 verse
[2:12:44] one th there for my
[2:12:49] son be strong in the
[2:12:51] that that is in Christ
[2:12:56] Jesus this is Paul the messenger
[2:13:01] commissioning
[2:13:03] Timothy and the
[2:13:05] things that you have heard of me among
[2:13:08] many
[2:13:11] witnesses the same commit thou to
[2:13:14] Faithful
[2:13:16] Men Who Shall be able to teach others
[2:13:20] also
[2:13:22] did you hear that he says even the
[2:13:26] things you had about
[2:13:28] me that's why I say when God become I
[2:13:33] mean sends a
[2:13:34] message he becomes a teaching to the
[2:13:39] [Music]
[2:13:41] end and after commissioning
[2:13:45] him he says Thou therefore endure
[2:13:48] hardness
[2:13:52] as a good soldier of Jesus
[2:13:57] Christ praise the Lord so this is how it
[2:14:03] works from Paul the
[2:14:06] messenger to
[2:14:09] Timothy and from
[2:14:11] Timothy to
[2:14:14] faithful and faithful
[2:14:16] men to others also after that he says I
[2:14:23] Endure hardness as a
[2:14:28] soldier timoy you are not a
[2:14:32] soldier but endure
[2:14:35] hardness the way a soldier endures
[2:14:40] hardness when is in the season of
[2:14:44] War why would
[2:14:47] Paul tell Timothy that
[2:14:52] because the opening of The
[2:14:54] Words which has never been known
[2:14:57] before would alwaysa a
[2:15:01] war are you together with me I think I
[2:15:04] sent you the
[2:15:06] message amen about some of our young
[2:15:13] missionaries there they were preaching
[2:15:17] and they came to
[2:15:19] think that these people had never
[2:15:22] had and some men who were the leaders of
[2:15:27] the district and
[2:15:35] what are FAL
[2:15:43] prophets
[2:15:47] as brother Bram says
[2:15:51] about the opening of a
[2:15:53] seal what
[2:15:55] happen a SE is
[2:15:58] open what that a
[2:16:02] mystery is
[2:16:04] unfold and when a mystery
[2:16:07] unfold then a trumpet
[2:16:10] sounds it declares what a plague
[2:16:17] Falls what is that part that war part
[2:16:22] the Ang of the church catches the Myster
[2:16:25] of
[2:16:26] God not ful yet
[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:33] reveal but when he does catches the
[2:16:37] Myster of God and when he goes forth to
[2:16:40] the
[2:16:41] people after the mystery has been given
[2:16:44] to
[2:16:45] him for the
[2:16:48] people what does he do out there
[2:16:51] he begin to Proclaim that
[2:16:54] message and what does it
[2:16:56] start a war a
[2:17:05] spiritual and it tells him the is
[2:17:10] open truth are coming
[2:17:18] for hand yourself
[2:17:22] like a
[2:17:23] soldier on war so the war is always
[2:17:27] concerning the revealed will of
[2:17:32] God to
[2:17:35] the are you together with me now the
[2:17:38] truth
[2:17:39] comes and it opens up a
[2:17:43] wall the wall is because the
[2:17:47] truth will always challenge the standard
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:54] it will call the
[2:17:56] church from the St
[2:17:59] position back to the
[2:18:02] center he bring forth his
[2:18:06] fruit in this season but what is the
[2:18:10] fruit of this
[2:18:12] season what will this message have to
[2:18:15] bring
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:20] because the fillment look here
[2:18:23] now the fruit in our
[2:18:26] season is The Fill Mal
[2:18:32] 4 verse 5
[2:18:34] and God sending us a prophet in this
[2:18:39] age amen it is restoring people
[2:18:44] back to the apostolic
[2:18:48] foundation not maintaining the church in
[2:18:51] the
[2:18:53] era of the
[2:18:55] denomination is calling people out of
[2:19:00] denomination teaching them the
[2:19:02] sovereignity of a local
[2:19:06] church revelation of the one true
[2:19:10] God and not being a
[2:19:12] trinity the true
[2:19:15] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:19:18] Christ are not entitles
[2:19:21] the
[2:19:22] sereny the
[2:19:24] position of the believing
[2:19:27] woman in the Bible women and need for
[2:19:35] decy the standard teaching to these
[2:19:39] sisters is let your
[2:19:42] women keep silence in the
[2:19:47] churches it's not permitted to them to
[2:19:50] speak
[2:19:52] but they are
[2:19:53] commanded to be and
[2:19:55] obedience as also says the
[2:19:58] Lord hallelujah hallelujah all this is
[2:20:02] the fruit of the age where we
[2:20:09] walk and then you
[2:20:12] wonder
[2:20:14] am
[2:20:16] living in the
[2:20:18] channel where this fruit will
[2:20:22] positively affect my
[2:20:24] life so God releases this
[2:20:28] truth and paules Timothy
[2:20:33] saying hardness as a good soldier of the
[2:20:39] Cross so while dispensing this
[2:20:43] truth it causes a spiritual war
[2:20:52] you understand what I
[2:20:54] mean you
[2:20:56] see he desires all
[2:21:00] people to be
[2:21:03] saved and also come to the knowledge of
[2:21:06] the
[2:21:10] truth so while dispensing this
[2:21:18] truth it brings a challenge
[2:21:22] it's Paul to Timothy Timothy to Faithful
[2:21:27] Men Faithful Men to others
[2:21:31] also and this line of
[2:21:34] command is very
[2:21:37] necessary to keep the Revival
[2:21:43] burning when you shift from the
[2:21:46] life then the
[2:21:48] gospel loses
[2:21:53] Direction
[2:21:55] listen brother Bram says in every age we
[2:22:00] have exactly the same
[2:22:03] pattern that's
[2:22:05] why that's why the light comes through
[2:22:10] some god-given
[2:22:14] messenger in a certain
[2:22:17] area and then from the messenger
[2:22:21] they sprad the
[2:22:24] light through the ministry of
[2:22:27] others who are being Faithfully
[2:22:30] Tau but of course all those who go
[2:22:35] out don't always
[2:22:38] learn how necessary it
[2:22:42] is to speak only what the messenger has
[2:22:48] spoken and Paul remember
[2:22:52] want the people to
[2:22:54] say only what he
[2:23:00] say are you together with me we have the
[2:23:04] Bible it has spoken to
[2:23:07] us and we speak what the Bible
[2:23:14] says for you just Crum things like
[2:23:18] that but if you don't CR
[2:23:25] we must maintain the
[2:23:30] fruit and brother Bram
[2:23:33] says they add
[2:23:37] here all they take away
[2:23:39] there and soon the message is no longer
[2:23:44] pure and the Revival dies
[2:23:47] down how careful we must be
[2:23:51] hear one
[2:23:53] voice for the spirit has but one
[2:23:57] voice is the voice of
[2:24:00] God want them to say what he
[2:24:04] say as Peter did
[2:24:06] likewise he warned them that even he
[2:24:11] Paul could not change one
[2:24:14] word what he had been given by
[2:24:18] Revelation how important it is
[2:24:21] hear the voice of God by way of his
[2:24:25] Messengers and then say what has been
[2:24:29] given the
[2:24:34] church okay so the
[2:24:38] messenger is the standard of God's
[2:24:41] requirement for the
[2:24:46] age amen so you remember
[2:24:51] in Psalms
[2:24:55] 13 the scripture speaks about this
[2:24:59] man and he says it shall be like a tree
[2:25:02] planted by the rivers of
[2:25:06] what that bringeth forth God's
[2:25:11] fruit in the season of the
[2:25:14] message amen so God hands this man
[2:25:21] with
[2:25:22] seeds of the ede go and plant the
[2:25:29] word and say go and plant the
[2:25:35] word meaning he gives him the right
[2:25:43] seed of the word to the edge all his
[2:25:48] Harvest
[2:25:51] hallelujah hallelujah in that age must
[2:25:55] be
[2:25:56] exactly like the
[2:25:58] message that he has put into the
[2:26:05] people some of you have
[2:26:10] planted and some of you don't have the
[2:26:16] opportunity to
[2:26:18] plant like a corn
[2:26:22] you only plant
[2:26:26] roses because you grew up on the streets
[2:26:29] of the
[2:26:33] city but when you plant a purle
[2:26:42] rose
[2:26:45] R it doesn't come yellow
[2:26:50] are you together with
[2:26:52] me when you plant that thny
[2:26:56] [Music]
[2:26:59] Rose you cannot have a a a harvest of
[2:27:03] the
[2:27:05] rose without no
[2:27:09] thought the seed that goes
[2:27:13] down must bring back the
[2:27:16] life that was in the sea
[2:27:21] amen and so
[2:27:24] Mal was given some seeds to
[2:27:29] plant and
[2:27:32] harvest that is because of the message
[2:27:35] of
[2:27:38] Mal must resemble the message
[2:27:42] of amen and that's why we stick on the
[2:27:48] Revelation to the end
[2:27:51] hallelujah hallelujah holding the
[2:27:53] standard
[2:27:55] high so that by the grace of
[2:27:58] God
[2:28:00] maintain the life of the Holy
[2:28:02] Ghost in the
[2:28:06] church amen let us look at it here some
[2:28:10] of the things Deuteronomy chter
[2:28:17] 22se it a seed planted in the Malachi 4
[2:28:23] message the woman shall not wear that
[2:28:26] which pertain a
[2:28:29] man neither shall a man put on
[2:28:33] a amen woman
[2:28:36] garment for all that do
[2:28:41] so Abomination the Lord thy
[2:28:44] God did you hear that so before the
[2:28:48] spirits of Sodom
[2:28:58] churches men were real
[2:29:01] men and women were real
[2:29:04] women amen men dressed as
[2:29:08] men they loved their
[2:29:11] wies they took responsibility of
[2:29:14] their they worked for the
[2:29:17] family and took care of their children
[2:29:21] that was the
[2:29:22] seed where is that
[2:29:26] seed in the
[2:29:28] harest we must bring back the same
[2:29:32] life amen and the women took their
[2:29:37] positions as
[2:29:39] women they dressed as
[2:29:41] women they were
[2:29:44] natural on the inside and the
[2:29:47] outside they took care of their
[2:29:51] children where are the Harvest in those
[2:29:58] areas listen the seeds First Corinthians
[2:30:05] 11:15 was
[2:30:07] s by Mal 4 and we must make
[2:30:12] sure that it comes to the
[2:30:16] Harvest he says in verse 15
[2:30:20] but if a woman have long
[2:30:22] hair it's a glory to
[2:30:25] her for her hair is given for her for
[2:30:32] Recovery not
[2:30:35] now amen because it is the hair which is
[2:30:40] the
[2:30:41] covering and when she cuts her
[2:30:44] hair even if she puts head
[2:30:48] catch amen she has cut her
[2:30:56] covering you see
[2:31:07] what listen in First Corinthians
[2:31:11] 115 for every
[2:31:14] woman that
[2:31:16] prayers or
[2:31:18] propes with
[2:31:24] C for that
[2:31:28] [Music]
[2:31:32] is so what is the covering
[2:31:36] there the covering is your beautiful
[2:31:41] hair amen so God car so much about the
[2:31:44] looks of
[2:31:47] women because they represent to the
[2:31:50] Bride of the Lord Jesus
[2:31:52] Christ adored like the
[2:31:55] bride in Revelation
[2:31:58] 19 to her was
[2:32:01] granted amen that she should
[2:32:05] be
[2:32:07] L clean and
[2:32:09] white L is the righteousness of the
[2:32:13] Saint
[2:32:15] the is not
[2:32:17] dressed in Scamp
[2:32:21] dresses in
[2:32:23] TI she was dressed in a
[2:32:26] gar it was not a

[2:32:33] forth his

[2:32:48] with we just need to maintain
[2:32:53] it I'm going in a s spot

[2:35:38] pain so I must do my
[2:35:43] best and brother Bram
[2:35:45] said a woman never did pain
[2:35:50] her face to meet
[2:35:54] God she painted her face to meet
[2:35:59] men and that was
[2:36:02] Jezebel Jezebel painted her
[2:36:05] face and put a round tire around her
[2:36:09] head and went out to meet the
[2:36:16] man no other woman did that
[2:36:21] I would support
[2:36:24] you if Sarah painted her
[2:36:29] face if Rea painted
[2:36:34] her I would support
[2:36:37] you maybe if Elizabeth painted
[2:36:43] her or
[2:36:45] Mary the mother of the Lord's body
[2:36:49] painted her
[2:36:50] face the only woman that painted her
[2:36:54] face was a negative
[2:37:01] character and brother Bram sold those
[2:37:06] seeds and the Harvest must be reflected
[2:37:09] in
[2:37:12] Fruit amen amen now let me just talk
[2:37:17] about even the natural dangers
[2:37:23] amen of trying to bleach your
[2:37:27] face this is science now sence when you
[2:37:32] apply a skin bleaching product to the
[2:37:38] skin such as
[2:37:41] Hydro it decreases the number of
[2:37:45] melanites in your skin
[2:37:50] this can result in a lighter
[2:37:55] SK and more even appearance in the
[2:38:00] skin skin
[2:38:03] bleaching has been associated with the
[2:38:05] number of adverse health
[2:38:11] effects
[2:38:14] amen isal poison
[2:38:20] because it's also in that kind of those
[2:38:24] sping uh
[2:38:29] creams signs and symptoms of matal
[2:38:32] poisoning
[2:38:42] include the skin begins to die in
[2:38:45] certain parts high blood pressure
[2:38:56] fatigue neic symptoms such as
[2:39:07] tror amen memory

[2:39:35] skin caused by contact with certain
[2:39:41] substances symptoms can range from mild

[2:40:25] it is a skin
[2:40:28] disorder that causes
[2:40:31] black
[2:40:35] pigmentation it usually
[2:40:37] occurs as a
[2:40:40] complication of long time use of skin
[2:40:43] bleaching creams
[2:40:52] people who use it on large areas of the
[2:40:56] body on the entire
[2:40:58] body they develop what they call
[2:41:04] EO e e okay are you together with me so
[2:41:10] this kind of thing
[2:41:12] here if you find a person who has used
[2:41:16] the bleaching for a long time
[2:41:20] the skin
[2:41:22] dies becomes
[2:41:25] black and some like
[2:41:30] Reds
[2:41:38] [Music]
[2:41:42] of there's more I would have put

[2:41:59] fruit in this season will be the
[2:42:02] positive
[2:42:05] effect in the lives of the
[2:42:08] people and every Ministry we always bear
[2:42:12] some
[2:42:14] fruit and Paul called the
[2:42:16] colians the Corinthians

[2:45:34] nuggets amen and the
[2:45:37] Corinthians had grown to the level that
[2:45:42] they can
[2:45:43] swallow great
[2:45:45] nuggets isn't that
