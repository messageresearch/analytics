[35:12] here people have a
[35:16] culture their own
[35:20] tradition when they about to give
[35:23] birth they stop coming to
[35:26] church but we thank God she didn't stop
[35:28] coming to
[35:32] church praise the name of the Lord and
[35:35] now when they give birth they take one
[35:37] month without coming
[35:40] toch but last
[35:42] Sunday they were in
[35:45] hospital and this morning I was
[35:48] wondering are they coming to
[35:51] church and then here she has come to
[35:54] church
[35:57] the name so we need to change those
[36:00] birad
[36:03] tradition giving birth should not be an
[36:05] next for you to be away from
[36:09] church praise the name of our Lord
[36:12] mothers can we say
[36:14] amen amen let it be like that I want to
[36:18] appreciate for your
[36:20] dedication praise the name of the Lord
[36:23] so in Matthew chapter 19
[36:27] then verse
[36:29] 13 the Bible
[36:31] says then were there brought unto him
[36:34] little children and he should put his
[36:37] hands on them and pray and the disciples
[36:41] rebuked them but Jesus said suffer
[36:45] little children and forbid them not to
[36:47] come unto me for of such is the kingdom
[36:50] of heaven and he laid his hands on them
[36:52] and departed hands
[37:13] Lord so children were brought for
[37:19] dedication children were never
[37:22] bapti what we see commonly being
[37:25] done because
[37:28] baptism one has to First
[37:32] believe now this child cannot understand
[37:37] anything and before you
[37:39] believe you must first hear the
[37:42] gospel this child cannot hear
[37:46] anything so the gospel
[37:49] is to
[37:51] Salvation you first hear the
[37:54] gospel and then the gospel convicts you
[37:57] and then you believe that
[38:00] gospel when you believe with the heart
[38:03] then you confess with your
[38:05] mouth this child can never confess
[38:09] with but then in the
[38:11] denominations they
[38:13] get you know they get false
[38:19] Witnesses maybe an
[38:22] auntie you know and then they say
[38:25] confess on behalf of the child
[38:28] that's deception it's not written in the
[38:31] Bible but now we pray for the little
[38:34] baby that at age of
[38:39] accountability you know like maybe about
[38:41] 12 years when you read in Luke 12 Luke
[38:46] 2 Jesus went to the temple and then he
[38:50] was able to talk with those doctors of
[38:52] Law and
[38:55] Priests about the word god
[38:58] so we take that as an age of
[39:01] accountability where somebody can make
[39:04] their own
[39:06] decisions praise the name of our Lord so
[39:08] we are going to
[39:10] dedicate in the hands of the
[39:13] [Music]
[39:21] Lord let us pray father in the name of
[39:24] our Lord Jesus Christ

[41:07] protection re the evil one
[41:09] Satan power of Darkness that the devil

[41:15] child and command the name of Jesus we
[41:19] pray that you may give the
[41:20] ability father and mother this child be
[41:25] a good example this child

[41:39] ofus am God
[41:49] bless amen praise the name of our
[41:53] Lord amen
[41:55] am I that we stand
[41:59] up and then we take our scripture
[42:01] reading for
[42:02] today's
[42:06] service we are going to Luke chapter
[42:11] 8 verse 1 to verse
[42:15] 3 but before we read
[42:18] again father in the name of our Lord
[42:21] Jesus Christ we approach again your
[42:23] throne of grace and
[42:25] mercy asking you going to come and speak
[42:28] to us
[42:29] father through your word we understand
[42:33] that the heavens and earth were made by
[42:34] the word
[42:37] of when there was nothing
[42:39] completely and it's your word that we've
[42:41] come to feed
[42:43] on so Grant speak to us far according to
[42:47] your purpose and will in the name of the
[42:50] Lord Jesus
[42:51] us amen Luke chapter
[42:55] 8 we're reading from verse 1 to verse
[43:01] 3 so the Bible says and it came to pass
[43:05] afterward that he went throughout every
[43:08] city and Village preaching showing the
[43:12] Glad Tidings of the kingdom of God and
[43:14] the TR with him
[43:36] and certain women which had been healed
[43:38] of evil spirits and infirmities Mary
[43:41] Magdalene out of whom went seven divots
[43:45] and Joan the wife of shua hel stward and
[43:48] Susanna and many others which ministered
[43:51] unto him of their substance
[44:24] may God bless of his
[44:25] word May
[44:31] seated I want to preach on ministering
[44:33] to
[44:37] God ministering to
[44:40] God and I pray God gives me the
[44:43] grace to be able to bring out what he
[44:45] has put upon my
[44:47] heart praise the name of our Lord
[44:50] ministering to
[44:52] God and many times we think that
[44:56] ministering to God
[44:58] God you know is only limited to
[45:02] men but you know it is the ministry of
[45:08] Christ where the Bible talks about
[45:12] Apostles
[45:14] pastors deons teachers and
[45:18] evangelist that is limited to
[45:21] God limited rather to
[45:24] men like in the Old Testament
[45:28] priesthood was only for
[45:31] men but then you will find that what the
[45:34] devil always
[45:36] does he will always do things contrary
[45:39] to
[45:41] God as long as God takes this
[45:45] direction the devil will endeavor to
[45:47] pull you out of the right
[45:50] direction like in the Old
[45:53] Testament praise the name of our Lord
[45:55] you know the PRI was committed to the
[45:58] sons of
[46:01] Aaron but then the devil in the Old
[46:05] Testament then you'll find also
[46:07] anointing women to be
[46:11] priests and then now the Christian
[46:14] Church takes it
[46:16] up but then you don't get it in the
[46:19] scriptures praise the name of but now to
[46:22] minister here which we want to talk
[46:25] about minister means to
[46:31] serve you know it's like to be a
[46:35] servant an
[46:38] attendant to wait
[46:41] upon to minister to one
[46:45] another praise the name of the Lord like
[46:48] the wife ministers to the
[46:52] husband praise the name of our Lord
[46:54] making preparations and things like that
[46:58] supplying the needs and so
[47:00] on then the husband now brings the
[47:03] requirements
[47:05] at and then the wife prepares them
[47:08] again now we've read here in Luke
[47:11] chapter
[47:12] 8 and then the Bible
[47:15] says and certain women which had been
[47:18] healed of evil
[47:25] spirits and then yna the wife of
[47:29] su Herod
[47:32] stewards and
[47:34] suan and many
[47:37] others and then the Bible says they
[47:40] ministered to
[47:43] Christ with their
[47:46] substance they ministered to Christ with
[47:49] their
[47:51] substance and God has called every one
[47:54] of
[47:54] us that we can min minister to
[47:58] him by the abilities that he has given
[48:01] unto us that we minister to God by the
[48:05] talents that he has given to
[48:07] us that we minister to God by the
[48:11] resources he has given to
[48:13] us that we minister to God by the
[48:17] inference that he has given to
[48:19] us that we minister to God by the
[48:23] positions that he has placed Us in the
[48:25] society
[48:27] in the communities where we are that we
[48:30] can minister to
[48:31] God at your place of work you can
[48:35] minister to God at your home you can
[48:38] minister to God in the community where
[48:41] you live you can minister to God or
[48:44] along the path you can minister to God
[48:49] now there is a good example
[48:51] here when we go to the Book of Luke
[48:54] chapter
[48:55] 4 and then verse
[48:59] 27 praise the name of our Lord it says
[49:03] and many lepers were in Israel in the
[49:06] time of Elias the prophet and none of
[49:09] them was cleansed saving Nam
[49:27] now you see the scripture here says
[49:29] there were many lepers in
[49:32] Israel in the times of Elish
[49:36] the but none of
[49:40] them was
[49:42] cleansed except
[49:45] Syria now the question is how was n
[49:51] cleansed how was
[49:54] delivered praise the name of the Lord
[49:56] let us go to Second Kings chter
[50:00] 5 and then verse
[50:05] one second Kings 5
[50:14] verse1 the Bible says now n captain of
[50:18] the host of the king of Syria was a
[50:21] great man with his master and honorable
[50:24] because by him the Lord had given
[50:27] Deliverance unto syia he was also a
[50:30] mighty man of Val but he was a
[50:53] leper and the syrians had gone out
[50:57] by companies and brought away captive
[51:00] out of the land of Israel a littleade
[51:04] and she waited on n's
[51:25] wife now you see the syrians went and
[51:29] took captive
[51:32] Israel and then they took a
[51:35] little and then this little was to's
[51:41] wife and now this little girl when she
[51:46] saw
[51:48] Nam the Master of the
[51:50] House much as was in great
[51:53] Authority much as God had given him a
[51:56] lot of viory
[51:58] he had
[51:59] leprosy and then the girl said unto her
[52:03] mistress would God my Lord were with the
[52:06] prophet that is in E Samaria for he
[52:09] would recover him of his
[52:16] leprosy now you see how
[52:20] God use this little
[52:23] God to serve him she test
[52:27] IFI about what the Lord can
[52:31] do and each and every one of us at our
[52:35] places of work where we live we can
[52:39] testify about the goodness of the Lord
[52:42] you can tell your
[52:44] colleagues What the Lord Has Done in
[52:46] your life praise the name of our Lord
[52:49] you can tell your
[52:50] neighb what the done in your life you
[52:54] can tell your family the Lord has done
[52:57] in your life you can tell strangers What
[53:01] the Lord Has Done in your life what are
[53:03] you doing you are ministering unto God
[53:06] when you tesy about the name of the Lord
[53:09] you are you are ministering unto God you
[53:12] are glorifying the name of the Lord so
[53:15] even this little man her
[53:18] testimony brought glory to the name of
[53:20] the Lord and then she told the
[53:24] mistress that you know there's the
[53:26] prophet in
[53:27] Israel he can kill all he can pray and
[53:31] heal this man of
[53:33] Leos but the Bible says there was no
[53:36] person who had ever been healed of
[53:37] leprosy by
[53:40] elishah but God revealed himself to this
[53:43] girl and this girl had the
[53:46] boldness to
[53:48] testify much as he was taken in
[53:52] captivity praise the name of our Lord so
[53:55] we can also testify
[53:57] we can testify at our places of we can
[54:00] testify where we live we can testify
[54:04] with the families that we live we can
[54:06] testify to the neighbors that we live
[54:08] in now testified about
[54:12] God and now the Lord Jesus picks it up
[54:16] and says
[54:17] n was the only person who
[54:21] healed in the days of Elish but how was
[54:24] he healed God used the little girl to
[54:28] bring that
[54:29] link praise the name of our Lord and God
[54:32] would also want to use you this
[54:34] morning God wants to use you at your
[54:36] place of life God wants to use you at
[54:39] your home God wants to use you wherever
[54:42] you
[54:42] want that the name of the Lord can be
[54:46] glorified so you don't say I'm not a
[54:49] preacher isn't there something that the
[54:52] Lord has done in your
[54:53] life that you can tell somebody about
[54:57] oh brother what happened at night snake
[55:00] was almost biting but the Lord saved him
[55:03] from that you are
[55:05] testifying you are giving encouragement
[55:07] to somebody and this is what the Lord
[55:10] wants us to
[55:11] do is the name of but you see what the
[55:14] devil
[55:15] does he wants to fill your mind with
[55:18] negative
[55:22] things that snake was going to
[55:25] bit slept hungry and I'm so
[55:28] [Music]
[55:30] hungry now the snake baiting you and
[55:32] sleeping
[55:33] hungry which would you
[55:38] want praise the name of the Lord but the
[55:41] devil just knows how to make
[55:44] sure that whatever God
[55:47] does is covered covered saying that you
[55:51] don't glory in the things that the Lord
[55:53] is doing
[55:56] will try to bring
[55:58] something and I've already seen it
[56:02] personally when the Lord does
[56:04] something and then you find you getting
[56:07] a lot of
[56:09] headache and then your mind What the
[56:11] Lord Has
[56:12] Done start all the head the head then
[56:17] you completely forget what the and
[56:19] that's why the devil does he will cause
[56:22] a problem here and then you forget the
[56:25] other thing
[56:27] like the children of Israel they were
[56:29] delivered out of
[56:31] bondage now they reach the
[56:34] Wilderness three days from the Red
[56:37] Sea the water is bitter oh This Bitter
[56:41] Water this
[56:44] bit and that's what the devil does to
[56:47] make sure that you don't glorify what
[56:50] the Lord is
[56:52] doing but this Syrian rather this little
[56:55] girl
[56:58] much as she was in
[57:00] captivity she was not living with her
[57:03] parents she didn't forget the name of
[57:06] the Lord praise the name of the Lord
[57:08] that should be our
[57:10] lives let your life not be built on
[57:13] negative
[57:14] things let your life not be built on
[57:16] your
[57:18] weaknesses but build your life on What
[57:20] the Lord Has
[57:22] Done and even what the Lord has promised
[57:26] Just Keep On Believing you just keep on
[57:29] trusting praise the name of our Lord so
[57:32] God has called us and each and every one
[57:36] of us can Minister unto the
[57:39] Lord in a different ways God has
[57:43] put praise the name of our Lord now in
[57:46] Luke Chapter
[57:49] 2 Luke Chapter
[57:52] 2 and then verse 36
[57:57] the Bible
[58:01] says and there was one Anna a prophetes
[58:06] the daughter of fenry of the tribe of
[58:08] Assa she was of great age and had lived
[58:13] with an husband seven years from her
[58:15] virginity
[58:37] and she was a widow of about four SC and
[58:40] four years which departed not from the
[58:44] temple but served god with fastings and
[58:48] prayers night and day
[59:04] now the Bible
[59:06] says Anna of
[59:10] age 84
[59:12] years she never left the
[59:16] temple but she served
[59:20] god with
[59:22] what praise the name of Lord verse
[59:28] 37 the Bible says she served god with
[59:35] fasting not only
[59:39] oneise the name she was in continuous
[59:45] fasting and
[59:47] prayers she was in continuous
[59:51] prayers now the question is who of us
[59:54] cannot do that
[59:58] fasting and
[1:00:01] praying praise the name of Lord she was
[1:00:04] ministering to
[1:00:06] God with
[1:00:08] fasting and with
[1:00:10] prayers everyone of
[1:00:12] us can serve the Lord with
[1:00:16] that you first when the Lord put that
[1:00:20] fast upon your
[1:00:22] heart and then you you separate yourself
[1:00:25] from the things
[1:00:28] and then you wait on the
[1:00:30] Lord you fast you
[1:00:33] pray was doing that kind
[1:00:36] of praise the name Sheed serving
[1:00:42] God she ministered unto
[1:00:45] God and each of us God has given us
[1:00:50] something whereby we can minister to
[1:00:54] God and when God has called you to
[1:00:57] minister to
[1:00:58] him do it with all your
[1:01:03] heart praise the name of the Lord do it
[1:01:06] with all your
[1:01:07] heart don't do it
[1:01:10] halfheartedly don't do it maybe for a
[1:01:13] show
[1:01:14] off don't do it you know in kind of you
[1:01:17] know
[1:01:19] M
[1:01:21] complaining don't do it this GR
[1:01:26] don't do that because God wants your
[1:01:30] service to be pure from your
[1:01:33] heart praise the name of our he wants
[1:01:36] your
[1:01:37] service to be pure from your
[1:01:41] heart so you don't do it to show
[1:01:44] others oh if it was not me nobody would
[1:01:48] do that that's not the way to do
[1:01:51] things praise the name of our Lord let
[1:01:54] us go to Romans chapter 12
[1:02:03] and then we start from
[1:02:07] verse verse
[1:02:11] four for as we have many members in one
[1:02:14] body and all members have not the same
[1:02:24] office so we being many are one body in
[1:02:29] Christ and everyone members of One of
[1:02:41] another having then gifts deferring
[1:02:44] according to the grace that is given to
[1:02:46] us whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:02:50] according to the proportion of faith
[1:03:09] oh Ministry let us wait on our
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:21] minister or he that exal on exaltation
[1:03:25] he that giveth let him do it with
[1:03:27] Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence
[1:03:31] he that shows M with
[1:03:47] cheerfulness now here is giving the
[1:03:49] different kinds of way we can minister
[1:03:51] to
[1:03:53] God based on the
[1:03:56] ability that the Lord has given to you
[1:04:00] because we have several
[1:04:02] abilities praise name of like Anna the
[1:04:06] ability that God gave
[1:04:08] her was to keep in the
[1:04:11] church praying and
[1:04:14] fasting that's the God
[1:04:17] given praise the name of our Lord in
[1:04:20] praying and
[1:04:22] fasting and that that was so because she
[1:04:25] she was a
[1:04:27] widow she didn't have a husband to
[1:04:30] minister praise the name of our Lord now
[1:04:33] if for you have a
[1:04:35] husband you're not going to spend a
[1:04:37] whole day in church every
[1:04:40] day oh the Bible has told me I should to
[1:04:43] pray every time and fast every
[1:04:47] time oh every day you in
[1:04:52] overnight you're not going to do that
[1:04:55] because you have a husband to minister
[1:04:58] to now I'm not saying that you don't
[1:05:00] need to do
[1:05:01] that but you have a role to
[1:05:05] play going I'm going to be on missions
[1:05:08] all the
[1:05:10] time but you have children little
[1:05:12] children at home to
[1:05:14] raise and I have a m who going to raise
[1:05:17] for me the
[1:05:18] children no you're doing it the wrong
[1:05:22] way God has given you a role as a mother
[1:05:27] you can minister to God as a
[1:05:29] mother by raising the children in the
[1:05:32] way of the
[1:05:34] Lord like the mother of John
[1:05:36] Wesley she had so many children she was
[1:05:40] faithful mother and praise his children
[1:05:43] in the way of the Lord praise the name
[1:05:46] of the Lord you are a wife be as a good
[1:05:50] wife praise the name of our Lord by
[1:05:53] doing what is needed of you
[1:05:56] praise the name of the Lord but you see
[1:05:58] the devil is bringing many kind of contr
[1:06:00] thoughts this
[1:06:06] days and then I was hearing some program
[1:06:08] in the course of last
[1:06:10] week and then one of the
[1:06:14] Commissioners in the ministry of
[1:06:18] gender and then he was
[1:06:20] saying hous
[1:06:23] work which are done by the one
[1:06:27] they must be paid
[1:06:30] for praise the
[1:06:32] name but that's what the world is doing
[1:06:35] that's where the world is going but when
[1:06:38] you come as a
[1:06:40] family you have responsibility you do as
[1:06:43] a husband you provide and as a wife you
[1:06:46] are
[1:06:47] supportive now if you you as a husband
[1:06:50] you are
[1:06:51] providing whom do you want to pay you
[1:06:53] for doing that
[1:06:58] praise the name of the Lord and as the
[1:07:00] wife as being
[1:07:01] supportive you want also to be paid the
[1:07:04] salary for that even the children will
[1:07:06] ask you for salary for producing
[1:07:09] them and the world is becoming
[1:07:12] crazy you know we need this we need this
[1:07:16] we need this that's not the way it is if
[1:07:19] God does given you a
[1:07:21] role do it
[1:07:23] carefully praise the name of
[1:07:26] serve the Lord with all your heart not
[1:07:29] looking for this looking for this
[1:07:31] looking for that you don't do that and
[1:07:34] you know our countries such kind of
[1:07:36] mindset has taken
[1:07:39] place like I was reading about South
[1:07:42] Korea they don't want to give birth to
[1:07:45] Children until the population of the
[1:07:50] country the people who die are more than
[1:07:53] those who are produced
[1:07:57] very
[1:07:58] funtion but this is self
[1:08:02] destruction when we get away from the
[1:08:04] word of
[1:08:06] God so God has given us
[1:08:10] rules we have talked about
[1:08:13] Anna she was in the temple serving God
[1:08:15] day
[1:08:16] and and as a married
[1:08:19] woman praise the name of our Lord all
[1:08:22] the time you away from your
[1:08:24] home then did you
[1:08:27] marry praise the name of our Lord as a
[1:08:31] mother all the time you away from your
[1:08:34] children why did you produce
[1:08:37] them because as a mother you're meant to
[1:08:40] nurture these children you me to raise
[1:08:43] this children but you see the devil
[1:08:45] shows you
[1:08:47] something so that you miss the real
[1:08:50] call which the Lord has put
[1:08:53] before praise the name of our Lord
[1:08:55] because even at home you can pray from
[1:08:58] home while you taking care of the needs
[1:09:00] at
[1:09:01] home you can fast from home while you
[1:09:04] are taking
[1:09:05] responsibility as a mother and as a wife
[1:09:08] you can do this kind of
[1:09:10] things praise the name of our Lord but
[1:09:13] you see in some
[1:09:15] Churches praise the name of our Lord the
[1:09:18] wives just keeping
[1:09:21] overnight until the husband thinks there
[1:09:23] somebody she has gone out with
[1:09:27] they do things the other way
[1:09:30] around without following the order of
[1:09:33] the
[1:09:34] law praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:09:37] Bible is telling us based on what God
[1:09:40] has given us ability to
[1:09:43] do let us wait on our
[1:09:47] Minister let us wait on the things that
[1:09:50] God has called us to
[1:09:52] serve as a mother be a faithful
[1:09:57] mother as a wife be a faithful wife as a
[1:10:02] father be a faithful father praise the
[1:10:05] name of our Lord and now we are living
[1:10:08] in a
[1:10:09] time that the devil has turned things
[1:10:12] upside
[1:10:15] down many nowadays especially the Young
[1:10:21] Generation they don't want take
[1:10:22] responsibility of home
[1:10:27] they only want to
[1:10:28] produce and doesn't mind how many they
[1:10:30] are
[1:10:31] producing and now it's the mother who
[1:10:34] suffers with
[1:10:35] the or the
[1:10:38] grandmother for him his work is
[1:10:41] produced doesn't
[1:10:49] care the first one is in
[1:10:52] ginger another one mother to him the
[1:10:56] pray is just giving
[1:10:57] bir but when you ask
[1:11:05] him knows what they at last night never
[1:11:08] sent any support for
[1:11:11] their when it comes to time of school
[1:11:14] fees the phones go
[1:11:17] off or they become sick
[1:11:25] that one that sick why did you produce
[1:11:28] them but this is the time we
[1:11:31] living that men are not taking
[1:11:33] responsibility of their
[1:11:36] hom the only thing they want is just be
[1:11:39] with a woman that's all the rest the
[1:11:41] woman suffers with
[1:11:44] that and then look for another then look
[1:11:46] for another then look for
[1:11:49] another that's how bad the world has
[1:11:52] become but now as children of God go we
[1:11:56] shouldn't do like the world is doing if
[1:11:59] God has called you to be a
[1:12:01] father be a father of your
[1:12:04] house praise the name of Take Charge
[1:12:07] over your
[1:12:08] house provide for your
[1:12:10] house praise the name of our Lord you
[1:12:13] don't know even your children how many
[1:12:15] clothes they
[1:12:17] have praise the name of you know some of
[1:12:20] them just now to work on
[1:12:23] themselves but child the clothes are all
[1:12:28] Tor what kind of father are
[1:12:32] you but God has called
[1:12:35] you to serve him as a
[1:12:38] father be a good example to raise your
[1:12:42] family praise the name of Lord if you a
[1:12:45] husband be responsible
[1:12:49] husband and when you fulfill every part
[1:12:52] God has put upon you
[1:12:55] you're serving God you're doing
[1:12:57] something which the Lord Delights
[1:13:00] in praise the name of our Lord or you
[1:13:03] come back home without
[1:13:05] food so what are you going to eat are
[1:13:09] you going to eat
[1:13:11] Stones when the Bible says as a father
[1:13:14] you are meant to provide for your
[1:13:17] house say me me I don't
[1:13:21] care my wife takes care of
[1:13:23] that so who what have you
[1:13:27] become praise the name of the
[1:13:30] Lord we need to see that we take the
[1:13:33] roads that God has given unto
[1:13:36] us if God has made me a father be a
[1:13:40] faithful father take charge over your
[1:13:43] children raise them in a good example if
[1:13:46] God has made me a
[1:13:48] husband let me be a faithful husband
[1:13:52] provide for the home take care of
[1:13:54] everything that's required of me if God
[1:13:58] has made me a wife let me do the same if
[1:14:01] God has made me a mother do the same
[1:14:04] praise the name of our Lord because it's
[1:14:06] God who has placed Us in different
[1:14:09] positions praise the name of our Lord
[1:14:12] and you know some of these things which
[1:14:13] we do which are not
[1:14:15] right in future they affect
[1:14:18] you and then you start wondering how I
[1:14:21] wish how I wish to avoid those
[1:14:26] things you better do the right thing
[1:14:28] now praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:14:32] Bible

[1:32:11] meal
[1:32:13] offering it says now it is a strange
[1:32:17] thing that God would send his Prophet to
[1:32:19] a widow woman's house
[1:32:27] what a
[1:32:28] place but she must have been a real
[1:32:31] virtuous
[1:32:35] woman or he would never send his Prophet
[1:32:41] there oh if a person was
[1:32:45] worthy we would be a worthy person to
[1:32:48] entertain a man like elah
[1:32:55] you remember it was
[1:32:57] Zacharia in in his
[1:33:00] house that had being Royal and
[1:33:04] true Waiting for God to give him a
[1:33:08] child and the angel
[1:33:11] Gabriel come to the house it was Virgin
[1:33:16] Mary who lived clean and
[1:33:20] pure and waiting for a promise of God
[1:33:25] that he sent an angel
[1:33:28] too so even you're
[1:33:31] living your
[1:33:34] cleanness your
[1:33:36] righteousness can cause God to come
[1:33:39] down and we need go to come down in our
[1:33:43] homes but for you why is your home
[1:33:45] having all those troubles all the
[1:33:49] time rebellious
[1:33:52] children complaining
[1:33:55] wife abusive
[1:33:57] husband how will God come
[1:34:00] there how will you have fellowship at
[1:34:03] home if the demons are happy to stay at
[1:34:06] your
[1:34:09] home they are busy there and let me tell
[1:34:13] you you know these demons identify one
[1:34:19] another complaining
[1:34:22] Spirits you'll see people people
[1:34:24] complain becoming close to one
[1:34:28] another because they have the same
[1:34:30] Spirits I thought this now again this is
[1:34:33] going to happen again I've added
[1:34:37] taxes going to build then another oh now
[1:34:41] these complaining
[1:34:43] Spirits they just
[1:34:46] congregate same spirits in the other
[1:34:49] things like when you read in the in the
[1:34:52] message when brother Bram was always
[1:34:56] Discerning when he identifies that this
[1:34:59] this is a spirit of
[1:35:01] cancer he identifies it or he mentions
[1:35:05] it then there this Spirit of cancer it
[1:35:09] calls other spirits of cancer to come
[1:35:11] and support
[1:35:13] it and then he tells people close your
[1:35:18] eyes don't open your eyes because this
[1:35:21] demon is refusing to live
[1:35:24] but he's calling other demons to come
[1:35:26] and
[1:35:27] fight when he talks about maybe a demon
[1:35:30] of heart
[1:35:31] pressure then those demons get
[1:35:34] identified in the
[1:35:36] congregation then he would say every
[1:35:39] person with heart
[1:35:43] pressure raise up your
[1:35:46] hand because he sees that if this person
[1:35:49] can be delivered
[1:35:51] here all the others same problem
[1:35:55] can so let not our
[1:35:59] homes be a d of
[1:36:04] demons demons of
[1:36:06] Rong Demons of
[1:36:08] complaining Demons of
[1:36:11] despising demons of
[1:36:14] this God cannot send his servant
[1:36:17] there that's what brother is saying he
[1:36:20] wouldn't send Elijah to a home like that
[1:36:23] the home was
[1:36:25] clean there was fear of God in that
[1:36:28] home and then God sent his servant to be
[1:36:32] there for a long period of time can God
[1:36:35] come and visit our
[1:36:37] homes praise the name of our Lord we
[1:36:40] make our homes Pleasant to
[1:36:43] God God was happy to visit
[1:36:46] Abraham why because their heart
[1:36:49] condition was right how about us is God
[1:36:53] pleased visit
[1:36:55] us is God happy to say this is my
[1:36:58] son is God Happ to say this is my
[1:37:02] daughter we need to see that we keep
[1:37:04] ourselves
[1:37:06] righteous then he says talk about
[1:37:09] running about with the world and Fleet
[1:37:11] with the
[1:37:14] world and then expect to see
[1:37:18] angels and have Miracles
[1:37:20] done it is out of God's prog
[1:37:25] you want God to do something for
[1:37:27] you keep your heart clean Keep Your Home
[1:37:32] clean the same thing with our church if
[1:37:34] you want God to visit
[1:37:36] us let us have the fear of
[1:37:39] God praise the name of the Lord then the
[1:37:42] Lord will come he says You must live
[1:37:46] right clean up the house clean up your
[1:37:50] habits clean up the things of the world
[1:37:54] get rid of your
[1:37:57] cards your world

[1:38:04] of
[1:38:05] God can speak and
[1:38:08] say fear not it is I praise the name of
[1:38:13] when your home is ready to receive
[1:38:16] God then he says the little woman was
[1:38:20] praying not knowing that walking down
[1:38:23] the
[1:38:25] mountain come the prophets he had a
[1:38:28] vision where to go God don't lead these
[1:38:32] people
[1:38:34] blindly he tells them where they are
[1:38:37] going he was looking into the
[1:38:40] city it was
[1:38:43] terrible people were starving to death
[1:38:47] and scaming for water and hungry it's a
[1:38:51] reflection of immorality
[1:38:55] a reflection of
[1:38:56] sin and this and this nation is in for
[1:39:01] it even the law of nature would not let
[1:39:04] it
[1:39:06] be when we are wasting money with r
[1:39:12] living and half of the world is staring
[1:39:17] today now he's talking about this
[1:39:21] woman a wi woman
[1:39:24] you know let us go to Luke and we pick
[1:39:26] it from
[1:39:28] there Luke chapter 4 where we
[1:39:33] read and then verse 25
[1:39:40] 26 Luke
[1:39:44] 4:25 he says but I tell you of a truth
[1:39:47] many widows were in Israel in the days
[1:39:49] of Elias when the heaven was shut up
[1:39:52] three years and six month when great
[1:39:55] fine was throughout all the land but
[1:39:57] none of them was Eliah saent save unto
[1:40:01] Sara a city of sedon unto a woman that
[1:40:04] was a widow
[1:40:41] praise the name of the Lord now you when
[1:40:43] you get down to find out who this woman
[1:40:47] was she was living in a place where
[1:40:51] people were dying of her
[1:40:56] and you remember in those days when
[1:40:58] there was fine people would eat the D of
[1:41:03] animals people would eat one another's
[1:41:07] child just for the sake of hunger which
[1:41:09] was there but now this woman waited on
[1:41:13] the
[1:41:14] Lord she had a
[1:41:17] son and then she was preparing her last
[1:41:20] meal
[1:41:23] got out of the city to pick
[1:41:25] sticks and then she could prepare a meal
[1:41:29] and
[1:41:30] die because that was the end of it it
[1:41:33] was not raining but now the Bible says
[1:41:37] God sent there
[1:41:40] Elijah how many of us can have God sent
[1:41:45] somebody in our
[1:41:48] houses where God is very pleased
[1:41:54] to come down in our homes to come down
[1:41:57] in our families like now this widow
[1:42:00] woman God was pleased to send there a
[1:42:04] Prophet and then said that woman will
[1:42:08] minister to
[1:42:09] you now look at this woman she didn't
[1:42:13] have
[1:42:14] much and some of us
[1:42:16] think some of us to minister to God we
[1:42:21] need to have much
[1:42:23] but it is your heart's
[1:42:26] condition that is very important before
[1:42:29] God praise the name of some of us think
[1:42:34] to support the work of God I need to be
[1:42:37] saving a lot of
[1:42:39] money it is your
[1:42:41] heart praise the name of Lord it is your
[1:42:44] heart
[1:42:45] condition somebody may be earning too
[1:42:49] much but he doesn't care about the
[1:42:51] things of God
[1:42:53] while another ands too
[1:42:55] little but from the little they are they
[1:42:59] care to support the work of
[1:43:02] God this woman had too
[1:43:05] little but God looked at her
[1:43:08] sincerity God looked at her heart that
[1:43:12] this woman is faithful and so he sent
[1:43:16] there Elijah and the woman ministered to
[1:43:20] Elijah she was a widow woman
[1:43:23] I don't think she had the best house in
[1:43:26] town she was a widow woman I don't think
[1:43:29] she had many
[1:43:30] things that should be the same thing
[1:43:33] with us you may be sleeping in a small
[1:43:37] room and you don't have enough
[1:43:40] space but God may be
[1:43:43] pleased to come and
[1:43:46] that and for you may have a big
[1:43:49] house too many rooms but there's no room
[1:43:52] for
[1:43:55] praise the name of the Lord it may be
[1:43:57] like that so it's about our heart
[1:44:01] condition are we ready in the services
[1:44:04] of the Lord are we ready to give to the
[1:44:07] Lord are we surrender to the
[1:44:10] Lord praise the name of our Lord this
[1:44:12] woman was poor she had come to the end
[1:44:16] of her
[1:44:17] living but God respected her
[1:44:20] face brother Bram says she had an
[1:44:23] overnight
[1:44:25] meeting praying the whole night tomorrow
[1:44:28] I'm eating my last meal tomor this is
[1:44:32] end but then she didn't start choosing
[1:44:35] God oh Lord I Thank for the life you've
[1:44:38] given me for bring me to this and then
[1:44:41] in the morning God tells Elijah go to
[1:44:45] that place you'll say woman that I have
[1:44:49] commanded to take care of you praise the
[1:44:52] name of our
[1:44:53] we need to learn how to minister to
[1:44:56] God we don't need much to minister to
[1:44:59] even the little that we have we can use
[1:45:02] it to minister to
[1:45:03] the praise the name of our Lord don't
[1:45:06] wait to sa
[1:45:08] Vision I don't know if I'm being hard
[1:45:11] behind praise the name of our Lord don't
[1:45:15] wait but in the ability that God has
[1:45:18] given
[1:45:19] you God wants you to serve him
[1:45:23] now in the message enticing
[1:45:26] Spirits he
[1:45:29] says what is
[1:45:32] it what is
[1:45:36] it seeking first the kingdom of
[1:45:41] God not the not the kingdom of God all
[1:45:46] little
[1:45:48] noise not the kingdom of God and the
[1:45:51] little emotion
[1:46:00] but God in his
[1:46:04] righteousness and all these other things
[1:46:07] will be added to
[1:46:09] you now that Widow
[1:46:13] heart faith comes by
[1:46:17] hearing hearing by the
[1:46:20] word she said that's the word word of
[1:46:23] the
[1:46:24] Lord for that's a holy man of
[1:46:27] God that is God's
[1:46:30] prophet and I know it the
[1:46:33] truth and it's the word of God she
[1:46:36] didn't run across to ask the
[1:46:39] neighbors how to do it she didn't want
[1:46:42] to go to
[1:46:44] share and the neighbor
[1:46:46] said well what do you
[1:46:49] think that preacher is over my house
[1:46:51] saying this
[1:46:54] what do you think about
[1:46:56] this she went ahead and be to dump
[1:47:03] out she let
[1:47:06] go she let go of what she
[1:47:09] had that she may get
[1:47:12] more that's what the world needs
[1:47:16] today good old fashion letting
[1:47:20] go and got
[1:47:24] now this
[1:47:26] woman Elijah told
[1:47:29] her first make a me for
[1:47:32] me and then when elah told her that he
[1:47:36] said God will
[1:47:39] F so now brother Bram is saying when she
[1:47:42] would go and remove the
[1:47:45] meal then God would F she removes God
[1:47:50] fs and that's the same thing in the
[1:47:52] Services of the
[1:47:54] Lord the more you minister to
[1:47:57] God the more he gives you the grace in
[1:48:00] the
[1:48:01] ministry praise the name of the Lord the
[1:48:03] more you give to God the more he gives
[1:48:07] you but when you retain from
[1:48:10] God then you limit
[1:48:13] Yourself Praise the name of our Lord
[1:48:15] that's also in
[1:48:17] nature when a leg receives water when a
[1:48:21] leg receives water
[1:48:25] when a l receives
[1:48:27] water and it doesn't give
[1:48:30] out it becomes
[1:48:34] dead but if it can receive the
[1:48:38] water and it Lees the water to keep on
[1:48:41] flowing it becomes
[1:48:44] aive praise the name of the Lord so when
[1:48:47] this woman continued making a meal for
[1:48:50] Elijah then God kep on sustaining
[1:48:55] her God kept on
[1:48:59] giving that's also the same thing with
[1:49:02] us we need to minister to the Lord in
[1:49:06] the abilities that God has given us and
[1:49:10] the more you serve the Lord the more
[1:49:13] grace God gives
[1:49:14] you praise the name of our we need to
[1:49:18] learn how to serve the
[1:49:20] Lord praise the name of
[1:49:23] you need to learn how to serve God
[1:49:27] Faithfully praise the name of our Lord
[1:49:30] now let us go to the scripture
[1:49:36] here Acts chapter 9 ver
[1:49:45] 36 9:36
[1:49:52] so the Bible
[1:49:57] says and they went on their way and they
[1:49:59] came to a certain sorry 36 is now there
[1:50:04] was at Jer a certain disciple named tabi
[1:50:08] which by interpretation is called
[1:50:10] docas which this woman was full of good
[1:50:13] works and arms did which she did
[1:50:37] praise the name of Lord now the Bible
[1:50:41] says was full of good
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:47] works and then she did a lot of arms
[1:50:51] deed
[1:50:57] and now as the body of Jesus
[1:50:59] Christ we need to be full of good
[1:51:03] works and we need to be supportive of
[1:51:06] one
[1:51:08] another praise the name of the Lord we
[1:51:10] need to be supportive of one
[1:51:12] another now was doing
[1:51:16] this until the Bible says when she
[1:51:20] died people were mour
[1:51:24] until they called for
[1:51:25] Peter oh we have a problem we have our
[1:51:29] sister she has done this and the Bible
[1:51:33] says they brought the things that she
[1:51:35] had made for
[1:51:37] them in verse 36 and it came to pass in
[1:51:41] those days that she was sick and died
[1:51:43] whom they had washed When and they laid
[1:51:47] her in the upper chamber
[1:52:00] much as leader was night Jer and the
[1:52:04] disciples had heard that Peter was there
[1:52:07] they sent unto him two men Desiring him
[1:52:10] that he would not delay to come to them
[1:52:31] then Peter Rose and went with them when
[1:52:33] he was come they brought him into the
[1:52:35] upper chamber and all the widows stood
[1:52:38] by weeping and showing the coats and
[1:52:41] garments which which doas made while she
[1:52:46] was with them
[1:53:12] praise the name of our Lord so the Bible
[1:53:16] says
[1:53:17] died the people she had blessed her
[1:53:23] came with the court she has
[1:53:26] made and then they started displaying
[1:53:29] them this is what she did this is what
[1:53:33] she did this is how good she was this is
[1:53:36] what has been
[1:53:38] happening praise the name of then what
[1:53:41] about us here as a church in a
[1:53:44] family what can you be remembered
[1:53:48] about praise the name of the Lord what
[1:53:51] will you be remembered about
[1:53:53] as somebody who was kind as somebody who
[1:53:57] was
[1:53:58] compassionate as somebody who was giving
[1:54:01] his as somebody who was helping
[1:54:04] others tab was remembered for her
[1:54:08] courts that she made for the people
[1:54:12] until they were concerned about her and
[1:54:15] then they called for Peter to come and
[1:54:17] raise tab from
[1:54:19] the why she was ministering to
[1:54:23] by supporting the
[1:54:25] Saints praise the name of our Lord we
[1:54:28] also need to learn the same
[1:54:30] thing that you can bless
[1:54:33] others you can be a blessing to others
[1:54:36] but the things that God has
[1:54:39] given praise the name of our Lord some
[1:54:42] of us have got a lot of cloes we don't
[1:54:44] use at
[1:54:45] home why do you keep them at
[1:54:48] home why do we keep them at home
[1:54:52] when there are people who don't have
[1:54:53] those
[1:54:55] clothes some of us you know we have
[1:54:58] maybe too many sand
[1:55:00] there the mattresses you feel you are
[1:55:03] fed up of
[1:55:04] this but even your St is too full of
[1:55:08] those why are you keeping them
[1:55:11] there now giving you don't only give out
[1:55:14] old
[1:55:16] things praise the name of the Lord you
[1:55:19] don't give out only those things you
[1:55:20] don't like
[1:55:22] but even something you say ah this thing
[1:55:24] is good for my
[1:55:28] brother I can give this to my sister I
[1:55:31] can give this to my
[1:55:32] brother praise the name of our Lord like
[1:55:35] maybe you've stopped producing
[1:55:38] children but you have things of babies
[1:55:40] at home you pick some of them and say
[1:55:43] Let me give this brother let me give
[1:55:45] this sister it can help
[1:55:47] them you know we need to be concerned
[1:55:50] about one another
[1:55:52] you know this brother has a problem this
[1:55:55] sister has a problem and then God can
[1:55:57] give you the ability to
[1:56:00] help take interest in supporting
[1:56:03] them and then there are some people who
[1:56:06] are in positions of
[1:56:11] influence you can

[1:57:17] now move on to the next
[1:57:19] one praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:57:22] go to marthew chapter
[1:57:28] 8 Matthew chapter 8 and then verse
[1:57:37] 14 the Bible
[1:57:47] says and when Jesus was coming to
[1:57:50] Peter's house he saw his wife wife's
[1:57:52] mother laid and sick of a fever and he
[1:57:56] touched her hand and the fever left her
[1:57:59] and she Rose and ministered unto
[1:58:17] them praise the name of the
[1:58:20] Lord the Bible says
[1:58:23] when Peter's mother-in-law was
[1:58:28] sick Jesus healed
[1:58:31] her when he healed her she didn't sit
[1:58:36] back how about us are we sitting
[1:58:39] back are we sick not to
[1:58:43] minister are we
[1:58:45] sick not to
[1:58:48] minister find something you can do for
[1:58:51] the kingdom of
[1:58:55] praise the name of the Lord don't tell
[1:58:56] me I can't do anything there are so many
[1:59:00] things to be
[1:59:01] done there are so many things to be done
[1:59:03] for the
[1:59:04] kingdom there are so many ways we can
[1:59:07] minister to
[1:59:09] God now you can imagine Peter's
[1:59:13] mother-in-law old
[1:59:15] woman when she got healed she rose up
[1:59:19] started doing something around
[1:59:22] how about us let us be found doing
[1:59:27] something for the body of Jesus Christ
[1:59:30] let us be found doing
[1:59:32] something in our services to the
[1:59:35] Lord let us not take the spirit of the
[1:59:38] end
[1:59:40] time you know the Bible says various
[1:59:43] times shall
[1:59:45] come men shall be lovers of
[1:59:49] themselves no natural affection
[1:59:57] of
[1:59:59] the they don't care about another
[2:00:04] person God has called us out of this
[2:00:07] world not to live like they were but to
[2:00:11] be like the true children of
[2:00:13] God praise the name of our Lord and God
[2:00:16] is expecting us to minister to him in
[2:00:20] the way that the abilities that he has
[2:00:22] given to
[2:00:24] us God has given us sever
[2:00:27] abilities there are many opportunities
[2:00:29] in the services of the
[2:00:32] Lord and God wants us to participate
[2:00:35] in praise the name of our Lord let us go
[2:00:38] to Matthew chapter
[2:00:43] 25 Matthew 25 and then verse
[2:00:48] 41 the scripture says
[2:00:53] and then he shall say also unto them on
[2:00:55] the left hand depart from me you cast
[2:00:58] into Everlasting fire prepared for the
[2:01:00] devil and his
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:19] angels for I was hungry and you gave me
[2:01:22] no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no
[2:01:35] drink I was a stranger and you took me
[2:01:37] not in naked and you closed me not sick
[2:01:41] and in prison and you visited me not
[2:02:08] then shall they also answer him saying
[2:02:11] Lord when so with the hungry or thirsty
[2:02:14] or stranger or naked or sick or in
[2:02:18] prison and did not Minister unto thee
[2:02:41] then shall he answer them saying I say
[2:02:44] unto you in as much as you did it not to
[2:02:47] one of the least of these you did it not
[2:02:50] to me
[2:03:03] praise the name of the Lord now this was
[2:03:05] on the Judgment
[2:03:07] Day and then he's telling the people who
[2:03:09] were on the left hand
[2:03:11] side when I was sick you never
[2:03:14] visited when I was in prison you never
[2:03:17] Vis when I was naked you never
[2:03:20] dressed when I was hungry you never
[2:03:23] F when I was thirsty you never give
[2:03:27] me they were
[2:03:29] selfish they were just concerned about
[2:03:32] their own
[2:03:34] selves and that's the same Spirit of the
[2:03:38] age and you know the spirit
[2:03:41] inia is a spirit where it says I'm full
[2:03:44] of
[2:03:47] goods I'm too
[2:03:49] rich and there's not satisfaction to the
[2:03:52] things you can
[2:03:55] possess you know somebody wants to take
[2:03:57] over the whole
[2:03:59] village where would the other people
[2:04:01] live
[2:04:03] now where are you pushing
[2:04:07] them praise the name of the
[2:04:09] Lord you know there was a
[2:04:13] place and now this man was too
[2:04:16] rich and he kept on buying buildings in
[2:04:19] the
[2:04:20] town and whatever building he
[2:04:23] buys he chases way the people are using
[2:04:25] the and the building stays there for a
[2:04:27] whole year again he goes and buys
[2:04:29] another look at that
[2:04:32] craziness then you ask him why is he
[2:04:34] buying the building and not
[2:04:36] us he doesn't want anybody to be
[2:04:39] there he was making the town a ghosty
[2:04:49] town but this is the president we have
[2:04:52] now somebody goes and buys
[2:04:55] land land tches away the
[2:04:59] squarters and the land they
[2:05:04] areolate how is that wondering
[2:05:08] craziness but this is the end time
[2:05:10] spirit that we
[2:05:12] have somebody wants to buy
[2:05:16] everything and doesn't use them while
[2:05:19] the other people are there
[2:05:23] they don't have anything but he doesn't
[2:05:26] care and then there I think is in
[2:05:29] Proverbs where the Bible says that if
[2:05:32] you deprive some people either food or
[2:05:38] something they will C
[2:05:42] you people don't fear cures
[2:05:45] now I don't
[2:05:48] care that's what is happening the Bible
[2:05:52] says he told them when I was naked you
[2:05:56] never
[2:05:57] dressed so you need to be
[2:05:59] concerned if my brother doesn't have
[2:06:02] clothes to put
[2:06:03] on why can't I help my
[2:06:06] brother praise the name of the Lord
[2:06:09] maybe somebody's shoes are worn
[2:06:12] out until they have cracks
[2:06:16] down now it is raining the water will
[2:06:19] enter inside
[2:06:21] you have too
[2:06:23] many you don't
[2:06:28] care and then another you see that even
[2:06:31] the col is completely worn
[2:06:36] out and maybe you want to demonstrate
[2:06:39] and then use him what happened to your
[2:06:43] shirt
[2:06:46] another praise the name of the Lord not
[2:06:48] moing him in his condition
[2:06:53] you know we need to be concerned about
[2:06:54] one another and then he says I was
[2:06:58] hungry and you never paid me and then
[2:07:01] you hear this
[2:07:03] brother this is the condition is in get
[2:07:06] food and take to
[2:07:09] their praise the name of our Lord and
[2:07:11] then different kind of needs I was in
[2:07:15] hospital I was in prison and you never
[2:07:18] visited me take interest
[2:07:21] to go and visit another who's in a bad
[2:07:24] condition to go and encourage another
[2:07:26] one praise the name of the Lord and then
[2:07:29] this asking Jesus when did we see you
[2:07:33] naked when did we see you you know
[2:07:35] hungry when did we see you seeck when
[2:07:38] did we see you in prison and we never
[2:07:42] ministered unto
[2:07:44] you and then he says since you didn't do
[2:07:47] it to this my
[2:07:49] brethren you never did it to me praise
[2:07:53] the name of our but God has called us to
[2:07:56] minister to
[2:07:58] him in the different things we can
[2:08:01] do in Luke chapter 8 these women
[2:08:05] minister to Christ with their
[2:08:09] subst we need to minister with what God
[2:08:13] has given to us it may be money it may
[2:08:17] be
[2:08:18] resources like we having a meeting here
[2:08:20] two weeks from
[2:08:23] you may have food and say oh no let me
[2:08:25] bring food to the
[2:08:27] trustees maybe you have money let me
[2:08:30] bring money to the
[2:08:31] trustees so that there's no work there's
[2:08:34] no lack in the service of the
[2:08:38] Lord praise the name of our Lord we need
[2:08:40] to take concern about the things of
[2:08:43] the you want to be blessed are you also
[2:08:47] blessing
[2:08:48] others praise the name of our Lord wants
[2:08:51] us to
[2:08:53] minister praise the name of the Lord let
[2:08:55] us go to Hebrews chapter
[2:08:57] 6 and then verse 10 as I try to
[2:09:03] finish Hebrews chapter 6 and verse
[2:09:11] 10 so the Bible
[2:09:20] says for God is Not unrighteous to
[2:09:23] forget your work and labor of love which
[2:09:27] you have show toward his name in that
[2:09:30] you have ministered to the Saints and do
[2:09:46] Minister amen he said you minister to
[2:09:49] the Saints
[2:09:51] and he says you are still ministering to
[2:09:54] the praise the name of the Lord there's
[2:09:57] a brother here in
[2:09:58] church that God put a burden upon
[2:10:02] his because we do missions every
[2:10:06] week
[2:10:07] Mission and you know it's a lot of
[2:10:11] expenses until sometimes you get into
[2:10:15] debts but there's a brother God put upon
[2:10:19] his heart
[2:10:21] that every week she sent say that this
[2:10:25] is
[2:10:26] fuel
[2:10:27] 100,000
[2:10:29] 200,000 the burden is upon him not that
[2:10:33] he's having too
[2:10:34] much but God has put such a burden upon
[2:10:38] his
[2:10:41] us they don't know situation is so
[2:10:44] bad but the other
[2:10:47] woman
[2:10:49] OFA she was a widow
[2:10:53] woman she had a young
[2:10:56] son the husband had
[2:11:00] died
[2:11:02] WID with a young
[2:11:05] son and only one mill
[2:11:10] left but she ministered to the prophet
[2:11:12] of

[2:28:35] 27 and then verse
[2:28:42] 55 Matthew
[2:28:48] 2755 the scripture says
[2:28:55] and many women were there beholding a

[2:30:16] earn he puts it in the kingdom and then
[2:30:19] he is only
[2:30:22] 10% and then he was saying why would I
