========================================

what is your petition praise the name of our Lord and then you know and think about Esther is At first she was afraid to go before the king she was wondering whether she would find favor before the king praise the name of Allah now my question to you my brother have you found favor before God this morning now you may start thinking maybe have not but the fact that you've come into His presence you have found forever before God often you know praise the name of us the fact that you've come into His presence the same thing with Esther the fact that she was able to go before the presence she already got the faith even us now we have already got favor of the king we have already got favor of God so what is your request what is your petition [Music] he said what is your request praise the name of our Lord let us go to Instagram read that scripture praise the name of our Lord there's something to us this morning chapter five this is praise the name of our Lord and then verse three it has started from verse 1. now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal April and stood in the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house this is when the king saw yesterday Queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the King held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand so Esther Drew near and touched the top of the scepter Hallelujah foreign but you can imagine there was destruction that was rooming there was destruction that had been declared against the Jews praise the name of Allah and then here we have the enemy Satani that is always after you praise the name of our Lord is moving up and down are you again moving like a roaring lion to devour he's always against us and then here God has given us an opportunity that we have come into His presence we have got favor before God so now the question what is your request what is your petition praise the name of Allah you see that the goodness of God even when when people were evil before him a man like he had caused the death of numbers and then when he met the Prophet Elijah and then Elijah pronounced judgments himself and then he went and sought the Lord in Santa Claus I'm not going through some of these things in his days he got favor he got some kind of relief you find a man like Cain after he had killed his brother then he started crying to God now people are going to kill me now people are going to kill him he prayed yes what the Lord he gave him a protection foreign [Music] oh Lord it's my desire to help me they need Deliverance in this area Lord I need for vision in this area what is your request when you come before his presence what do you come to talk to him about Lord I've come to tell you this God have come to mention this to you no this is my burden Lord this is my troubles don't limit Yourself Praise the name of our Lord don't limit yourself may not be necessary in my name but it is the same God that asking you this morning what would you have me to do for you what will you have me to do for you when he got the lepers and they cry down to him like Isaiah I need to be clean what is your request and the scripture says it shall be done [Music] what they needed of him he made Provisions when he was somewhere and they were drowning he created peace praise the name of our Lord you may also be needing peace in your heart you may need peace in your house you may need peace in your house I need peace at my heart I need peace in my soul you may be needing come facts Lord I'm so traveled at my place that could be your request that would be your petition I said Lord come down in my collection Lord come down in my scenario he gives us eternal life but doesn't mean but he gives us all the other things he said seeking first the kingdom of God seeking first the kingdom of God then all these other things we need to behold the face of God and when you behold his face then you speak to him Lord this is my scenario Lord this is my trouble Lord this is my name and then you see how the Lord will provide praise the name of Allah the way the king supplied for Esther praise the name of our Lord let us go back there is Isaiah chapter six praise the name of our Lord and then verse 6. then through one unto me having a life call in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar um [Music] and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lord this has touched thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged do you know they come here [Music] so Isaiah in the presence of God he identified his needs [Music] praise the name of us if there is any cleanness also in us and then in the presence of God say Lord this is where I'm failing no this is what I'm lacking in myself you just need to be open in your house you just be himself [Music] [Music] [Music] climb up here [Music] [Music] and then the seraphim foreign foreign foreign [Music] Lord this is my weakness and when Daniel cried to the angel the word the more Daniel had that one Daniel the more strength than your gain Daniel he stayed in the presence we need also to behold the face of God and when you hear the voice of God and then that voice of God changes you from within and then you find that your weaknesses are going your failures are going down something like Isaiah all his sin was taken away everybody and he was able to stand upright with confidence in the presence and that's what God wants of Us Praise the name of Allah in Revelations chapter 22. when the Lord was telling John before they come Canada praise the name of Allah then he said sure like [Music] he said amen he didn't say ah wait wait wait there are some businesses I want to finish in my house I have a course to do wait wait wait I'm still young [Music] right there absolutely praise the name of our Lord Zachariah chapter 3 and verse 1. so the scripture says and he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist to him now you can imagine that Joshua the high priest standing in the presence of God and then Satan instance standing on his right hand and right hand of authority right hand to perform the duty of God right hand to offer incense to do the word of God and Satan was standing on that hands to resist him to attack him to oppose him foreign [Music] foreign foreign and he has Satan was resisting the high priest and the high priest was the most holy man on us the high priest was the most righteous man is resisting him and he's going in the presence of God to intercept for all the nation all the sin of them can Satan says you're not going to do it he stood in the presence now you look what this scenario University and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuked the offset even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem is it not a brand cracked out of fire Joshua is standing in the presence of God and then Satan resisting him the Lord took concerns to come against the center who was actually resisting Joshua and the Lord said Center the Lord rebukes praise the name of it but you see Satan left Joshua with filtered garments foreign but when you come before the presence of God Don't just run away praise the name of Allah when you come into the presence of God don't just go away praise the name of Allah like in John chapter 8. they got the woman in adultery because and when they come down they take her to the temple where Jesus was yes praise the name of our Lord John chapter 8 and verse praise the name of our Lord the Bible says Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them yes and the secrets and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set up in the Middle East praise the name of Allah the righteous people now they've got this one in sin and then they take her in the temple before Christ we have gotta in a downtrend ism praise the name of Allah they all come into the presence of God but what brought them in the presence of God the Pharisees when they come in the presence they come to our Jews son when Joshua went into the presence of God Satan went to our church praise the name of our Lord how about us when we come into the presence of God we come to I choose our neighbors we come to our choose our colleagues oh they are so bad people when when you know when in the book of Acts chapter 9. praise the name of our Lord when ananias went into the presence of God he was also telling God this Soul here is a very dangerous man but the Lord corrected him praise the name of our Lord so when the Pharisees brought the woman God foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign they say they have homework the Bible says they went away but yeah they were convicted because of their sins so they went back with their sins but the woman that they were accusing stood before the presence of God until she was forgiven we also need to do the same thing the Bible says though your sins be as rendered Scarlet yeah we need to stand before the presence the woman who was brought before as a sinner left as a righteous yes the people brought her who were choosing they left when they are convinced praise and you know in the Scriptures it gives you know stories for things we can compare when the righteous people oh the self-made righteous people the Pharisees when they had John preach they started asking him when they had Jesus preach who gave you that Authority but when the Sinners had John preach what did they tell him what shall we do the Pharisees when they had them preached [Music] in Canada like when Moses went to the mountain and he was in the presence of God and when Moses was coming down and then he came down to the camp yeah and then they saw him his face was shining even nonsense would come into the presence of God let us go back with our faces shining to our neighbors shining at our places and then they say we are he has been with the Lord let us go to this message praise the name of our Lord in his presence so the prophet says after Jacob addressed all the night in confessing his sins you remember the place he was it was called penery penly Penny the word Finley in the Hebrew means face of the almighty God praise the name of our Lord what a good place to wrestle yeah coming into the presence of God and then you wrestle no this is my fear Lord this is instead of the word of God something that the devil was putting again on your mind which was not right and when you started the world when you hear the message it is like Joshua the High Praise standing before the presence giving him confidence anointing him we have also come into the presence Jacob the little shyster yeah his name was Jacob which means it's a planter that is a deceiver had to run all of his life away from God but when he got one time in the presence of God in the face of God he got a hold of God and wouldn't turn him loose we need more Jacobs hold on the face of God in the presence of God he stayed until it was Sun up yes Lord this is the day to overcome all my weaknesses Lord this is the day to overcome all my my challenges let it be the day and say Lord I need your deliverance I need your Victory praise the name of our Lord when we come in the presence beholding the face of God praise the name of Allah what a great thing it was now to know that he had wrestled through that he had seen the signs of God he had had dreams about God but this was one time he was in the face of God in the presence of God think of it friends in the presence of God a man is changed [Music] now he could walk with God he was a different man than what he was before he went up there the bat was now over and he began to build an altar yeah he hadn't been used to building waters you know but I tell you when he come in the presence of God you want to build a notice someone you want to find somewhere where you can pray foreign you need in the message a man running from the presence of the Lord he says lay out in the presence of God then with our hearts not our hands not so much but our hearts before God until he has seasoned us but through and through to where we can show others Jesus Christ lives yes we want to believe that research and remember where Jonah went God was in the boat God was in the storm God was in the fish he went on being right along with Jonah until his perfect will was done that is right and if he's ever after but you will be miserable until you come back and do the thing you started out for him to do at the first place don't go run from presence of God face up to eat you believe it is the truth then if it is the truth it is worth living foreign and then chapter one praise the name of our Lord now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amitai saying arise go to the Navy the great City and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto tashish from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joppa and he found the ship going to tashish so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them and tashish from the presence of the Lord this is a very interesting scripture we and Reigns from the presence of God now the question is where was the presence of God praise the name of our Lord because the Bible says he ran away from the presence now where was the presence praise the name of Allah just read verse 9 and 10. now Jonah was telling these people and he said unto them I am an Hebrew and I fear the lord the god of Heaven which has made the Sea and the dry land then we are the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why have you done this for the many knew that he fled from the presence of God because he told them so where was the presence so the Bible says instead of going to the Navy he went to tashish now if we went to the Navy we'd also be running away from the presence of God the same thing with us if we are in the presence of God if we are doing the will of God then we are beholding the festival praise the name of our Lord so every day keep yourself be holding the face of God doing the will of God keeping yourself in the presence he was running away from the presence if he was going to the Navy the place that God told him he was staying in the presence are we in the presence of God praise the name of our Lord oh you say yes we are in charge we are in the presence of God how about at your home are you in the presence of God then the face of God foreign and the Lord spoken to Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and unto his son saying on this one you shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them foreign praise the name of our Lord he says the Lord bless you and keep you the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious unto you and lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace God blesses us with his face shining upon him with his continence verse 26. the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee again and then verse 15. Psalms 89 15. he said blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk O Lord in the light of thy continence they walk in the light of his countenance you know it's the glory of God that comes around your life when we receive the word of God you are receiving the power of God and you are receiving the creative power of God the power that transforms us now if you had weaknesses and then that weakness goes away then you are being transformed when you are being transformed praise the name of our Lord then you full you fulfill the purpose for your creation you manifest that which is in you praise the name of Allah so the Lord wants his first to shine upon us [Music] the Lord wants us to have his continence his continence failed praise the name his countenance when we come into the presence we need to leave this place when the continents of God is upon us we need to leave this place when our faces are shining you know there is a nature of making your face foreign a busy go a busy go when you put them on your face it will make your face shine but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about that your first shining into your amazing because of the glory of God God coming down in you will come praise the name of Allah and then he makes your face shine what does it do when you meet people what's in Canada who are traveled accumulator praise the name of our Lord Acts chapter 6 and verse 15. Illuminator the Bible says and all that sat in the council looking steadfast on him so his first shine as he had been the face of an Angel available praise the name of Allah Stefan shining the glory of God in him he first ministered to them the word of God foreign and then read in verse seven the summer Canada comes out so the scripture says but if the ministration of death written and engraved instance was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away oh verse 13. which put a veil over his face and the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished is but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil and taken away in the reading of the Old Testament which well is done away in Christ is but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart is nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is [Music] but way all with open face be holding us in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so the Bible is telling us when Moses in the Old Testament when he when his face was shining he put on a veil and then the scripture is telling us that that Veil is now upon the heart you know when the law is read they are still a veil upon the hearts of the people to praise the name of Allah until that way they can't say Beyond because a veil covers in verse 16. that if our hearts turn to the Lord then the veil is taken away [Music] is it possible you may have come with weaknesses this morning but you need to have the veil of unbelief get away in the presence of God can we can it do for me this is oh I wish I was there in Branham and then when the prophet is Discerning say now you you there this is your problem the Bible says don't say so don't say so praise the name of Allah and then there are others oh when are we going to organize a confession and then that anointed the Bible says don't say something what does the Bible say the word is near you foreign foreign [Music] so in verse 18 he says and then the Bible says and then we Behold The Glory of [Music] let us go to Psalms 4. and then verse 4. Psalms chapter 4 and then verse 4. in the scripture says standing away and sinning not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still seller was um offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord there have been many that say who will show us any good Lord lift though up the light of thy continence Upon Us put gladness in my heart more than in the time that they are corn and their wine increased hotel is let me down in peace and sleep for the Lord only maketh me dwell in safety praise the name of our Lord he says God will put gladness in my heart and then he says that gladness is more than this thing I know when somebody is harvesting um praise the name of Allah because the Bible says they go sowing in tears but they come rejoicing you know with thieves but the Bible says God put such gladness in your house we just need to continue beholding his presence Lord I want to behold yourself I want to look into your face and the more you see his face is the more you are changed your commercials is the more you are transformed is the more your weaknesses it's the one you become strong Psalms 8. the Bible says turn us again oh God and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved who was doing Havoc foreign first John chapter 3 and then verse 1. the scripture says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not available foreign [Music] foreign and it does not yet appear what we shall be yeah but we know that when we shall appear we
