wonderful let's give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise that in this vessel of clay you have something that the world can never pay for let's stand up and get to Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 44 what can you give praise the Lord so you are all welcome and the visitors Among Us brother Henry visitor tell us the truth praise the Lord amen so you are all welcome and just keep trusting that the Lord has something for everyone this morning verse 44 says again the Kingdom of Heaven is like to treas he in a field the which when a man has found he hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sell all that he has and buth the field I want you to view yourself as a ground where some precious uh gem can be hidden and as I've already said behind this Ann vessel they lay something so precious that the world can never for so by throwing away everything else you can be able to buy into control of the ground where the treasure is amen so by the field he gets a hold of the treasure that his Joy may be full verse 45 again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly Pals who when he had found one pile of great price or Great Value went and sold all that he had and bought precious Heavenly Father tonight to this morning we just feel like we are Prospectors men who go into the wild to look for something so precious that father when we find it we can sell everything and be able to possess it but today we've got Revelation that we don't have to go into all the wild we have to come into ourselves father that we may be able to discover the power of great price I pray that you may bless these people as they listen to your word and as they take by faith every promise that's coming to them this morning in Jesus name amen you may be seated so this morning I've got a title the ultimate value the ultimate value so we want to speak about value and Men Who find something very valuable they make sure that they get a very safe place and keep it there you don't keep your ultimate valuables you keep them in the living room but you take them in a remote spot in your house and sometimes most times you even buy a safe box where you are going to put those valuable things you don't just expose to every onlooker because it's very valuable so value means the weight invested in a matter different considerations could be monetary considerations or otherwise amen so in general terms it's the regard of consideration considered in Goods or Gos in life I would have gotten brother again to come here and to explain to us what legal value would me but I've not prepared it for him amen so when thinking about value your mind will always move in the importance attached to that particular valuable thing you always look at it in terms of commercial [Music] rating which is involved in that particular good and the message brother Bram preached investment is I mean is built around value and value invested in different categories could have value computed in different choices of life you know to many people you know value would mean anything to somebody to to be the education attaches very great value to that another person the fame we is the value can speak about to some other people value is their profession some is their good jobs and this may sound a little strange to you but to some people which is not your category it could be profitable habits like a Pros to somebody that's a value to some people it's gambling amen but you know uh when the scripture says it could be that you've invested in some of those areas but when you find something of Greater price you sell all that which you consider value in order for you to get a pile of great price are you together with me in the message invest brother Bram says if you are a [Music] businessman every P you got and buy the one of great price and then brother Bram says make your investment in Christ are you together with me he say sell everything and put your investment in Christ so at one point of life amen we shall all we have been faced with the challenge of value there was a rich ruler in the scripture at one point he was faced with the challenge of value all of us somewhere in life we shall be challenged with something that we call Value there will always be two Alternatives stand before you but where do you attach your value amen so in Mark 10 and verse 17 this Rich Young Ruler and you know he had three problems around him youth in itself is a problem you think you know more than everybody else that's the problem of being a youth this old men here they don't have any bra but you being old is wisdom praise the Lord but that's the problem of being young the next problem was wealth when people have money they become very arrogant they become so arrogant they begin to think they own the world and he had the third problem he was a ruler so let us have simpathy with this young man but one time he was first with the challenge of value he had come to a point and he had realized that eternal life in itself was more valuable than what he had amen so in verse 17 and when he was going forth into the way there came one running and this is the Rich Young Ruler and knelt down to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life the man was faed with value he was controlling a territory he had money he had the fame of a youth when he started measuring what he had as opposed to eternal life he found out that eternal life is of Great Value he realized the AG and then he came running he was not walking he had heard that the master was in the area and he came running and he did not stand but he put all his power down he put all his wealth down he put his youth down he knelt down before the master because there is something he wanted to get out of amen he needed eternal life the only one who had the of how he could get eternal life says what must I do that I may inherit eternal life are you together with me so today we realize that eternal life is a geographical point where those who have got eternal life also dwell on one side it's geographical and in another life it is the quality of of life which is the life of God himself amen and he dwells in eternity so he says I want have an inheritance in eternity and some crazy people they start saying that now I can sell you a plot in heaven that God has got agents on Earth who sell his plots in heaven so you see the man F that eternal life is of Great Value but the problem with this man is that he wanted eternal life on top of what he had but then eternal life in itself there was a condition that you had to F in order for him to have it praise the Lord now in verse 19 thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth you know and the Bible says Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing you lack because for you to have eternal life it's not just going to be a to what you have is going to be a takeaway to empty out so that eternal life can occupy the empty space therefore go thy way sell whatsoever you have give it to the poor and you shall have treasure in heaven and come and take up the cross and follow me the Bible says he had a lot of wealth so when he consider that looking at himself as poor as the rest of the people he knew he says I can I cannot my me look at like my neighbor who does not even have food no no no but the problem is the man did not have a conference with God sometimes we need a conference with God where God can speak and we speak back that's the difference between the Rich Young Ruler and the woman at the well the woman at the well had a conference with the master this man had conference with the master he would have come to the area of understanding what the master meant for him to sell all that he had that's the problem with people they judge god without giving him an opportunity to have a conference with him when you come to church you are having conference with God God is talking to you when you in your standard time you are in conference with God God is talking to you this man didn't give godun to a conference with him he made his own decision and he was sad at that same and went away G possession The Joy could only be found in the greater value one cannot hold Goods of contradicting value at the same time because you've got Goods of contradicting value they will always be one ultimate value amen you see you cannot hold two things and both of them read the same value it can't be are you together with me yes sir you need to take time and find out the True Value amen of the things that were involved with the things of the Kingdom amen now because like we are talking about the Prospectors amen those who go to prospect for gold maybe to prospect for Di Prospect for oil there are certain things that they must do first of all they must seek but this man did not seek into of the Lord you know he did not enter into the council Master what did you mean do you mean that only the poor that go to heaven he would have made him understand a little deeper than that and once he has s then he find hallelujah hallelujah we seek we find then we sell all the other things hallelujah hallelujah of less value to purchase the field which has the P of great price he did not do that so it means that we are confronted by the need to make a right decision always in life praise the Lord you see when you are first with two contr values take time and find out what holds the True Value because this man wanted to have this and wanted to have that and yet the master had given him anate you know cancel and told him sell follow me listen brother Bram lived his life by making right choices in life we need to learn how to make right counsels to make right decisions each time you make the right decision in life God gives you the strength to back up the right decision he only waits for you to make a decision the right decision the right decision and the moment you make the right decision God will always back up that decision if you always remain between two opinions you walk away amen like the rich young man you don't get what you're looking for make the right decision Amen brother BR in the message uncertain sound he's talking about uh uh uh you know the man who spoke in Tong in one of his meetings and then another man you know the man who spoke in tones actually spoke French but then another one could come I mean some men came and they say we know what this man is saying because that's French so it was interpreted and the Man I mean who was speaking in Tong he was actually God talking to brother BR saying because thou H has chosen the Narrow Path the hard way thou Hast make walked of thy own choos making a choice Moses had to walk of his own choosing he didn't have two but he made his decision thou has picked the correct and PR and precise the season and it is my way because of this momentous deis a huge portion of Heaven awaits the this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love hallelujah hallelujah God in his wisdom he puts two things of contradicting value and then he says what choice are you going back and you come to a moment a moment of prayer a moment of meditation you totally sell yourself to God and always the right thing we have the pool in a person's heart it will always pull and the right thing was eternal life the pull in this man's life but unfortunately the man made the wrong choice hallelujah hallelujah God gives you the choice he gave brother Bram the choice and when brother Bram made the choice he says yes that's my way the moment he presents is right there to guide you to make a decision praise the Lord so your right decision in life at the foundations to the tremendous victory in the love divine amen hallelujah so the Bible say the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure field treasure means a place in which good preure things are collected and laid up it's like a bank it's a treasure it keeps very precious things so the prospector therefore SS all that he has amen so that he may buy that field and possess the treasure I'm talking about value this morning sometimes we made choices that are totally valueless and they torment Us in life brother Bram says and our rights to the world we've sold out and bought this SP of great price we sold all right it's our right to be in the night club but we sold those right because you bought a power of great price you've got a right to dress and you expose your fraud but you don't do that you dress so nicely because you sold your rights to buy a pile of great PR you would have a dress like you but then you don't do that because you have got a choice in life amen and work and letting the Holy Spirit manifest itself that's what is real church is that's what you are you understand value praise the Lord with joy you sold your right to living your Liv amen like anybody else of the world you have a right to be parting somewhere drinking and gambling you go down it Sports and do whatever but you sold your and that's what God was asking the rich to sell your right come follow me did you s your right that's why you are here that's why you don't act like the world Abraham sold what he had in the land of the child to move into Canaan and in there God showed him a treasure heing called the value a land that would possess with his seed after him and when God was describing this land to Israel when they were going to possess it he called it a good land a large and a land flowing with milk and honey can you imagine he was describing Israel he was calling it a good land he was calling it large he was calling it a land flowing with milk and Hy he was describing the value God calling that little pass of land amen a large and good land which is be as small as mus are you together with me large simply because it was big enough for the purpose are you together with me amen don't look at your brother's house just have value in your own house it's big and large because it is now for the value the purpose amen sometimes we so much young to have like the one of brother Silas you know brother Silas in his mind he has a house if you need to know the people you open their mind then they plan a bedroom as big as this church but God says you don't need all that land and the little pass of land he's calling it good and large flowing with milk and honey and the song writer say little is much when God is there hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord little is much when God is in it that little land there it controls the brain of the entire world it controls the wealth of the entire world it flows with mil and the richest men in America they are Jews you see it says large but good enough for the purpose so looking at the description of the [Music] land it was a blessing but Abraham needed SE for him to inherit it together with him in that land and you know God will always do certain things around us to help us realize the value God will do things to highlight value embedded in what is doing in our lives he trained Abraham to appreciating value of Isaac taking him 25 years in waiting when sah gave birth Abraham should have looked at this baby turn him this way his head that is value are you together with me sometimes there are certain things that we prefer and we will not realize how great they are in our lives they come so [Music] simply God allows you to weigh and the more you wa is the more value keeps building and when it comes to you you lift up your hands you say thank you Father 40 years in the wilderness God was building value in the minds of the children of so when they got in there brother it was joy and happiness amen when Solomon valed the kingdom amen God gave him wisdom because he had value for what God had put into you see what I'm saying God wants to teach us that kind of mind the mind that resports to Value God has invested in our lives and sometimes even the things around us if we don't value what God has given to us it's always very difficult to give God thanks when he does what he does for us now I've been talking about value of the things around us but I want to bring this value to us ourselves sometimes we look at ourselves and we don't give ourselves the kind of value which God attaches to us are you together with me he valued us and redeemed Us by his own blood that is Ultimate value cannot be anything greater than the blood of God himself because the life of the flesh is in the blood amen so we are worth the same value of the blood of God but how much value do we attach to ourselves and how much value do we attach to the blood of God God has had the path that he did to come and bring himself into our domain I want to take time and speak about value value ultimate value amen so he he had to come from eternity he came from what the Hebrews called Elohim and Elohim is God before even became God he God before he became a creator because he existed all by himself there was no Heaven there was no Earth because God created them so he was in a state where he needed nothing because he had no Angels around him he didn't have people around him he was by himself and the Hebrews know him as Elohim the one who exist on his own amen praise the Lord but then when he came to a point where he was going to do creation amen he needed to come into position of being amen so that that which is created could have something to look back to and so God just m himself a body which the Greek theologians called the logos amen it is at that stage that he spoke the creative word amen when he was in that logos he had built himself a body and now logos was a body of Light which light is totally different from our light so he created himself that body and that body cannot be seen by a natural man because it's a spirit body and when I die out of this body I also go into another body which is a body of Life called the are you together with me waiting for me to come back in the resurrection and pick up this one in a glorified form so logos was a body of Life totally different from this life brother Bram describes him with this words that the logos that went out of him become a little Hollow of light I'm taking it spiritual cph now and when this light came to meet sa on the way to Damascus praise the Lord this light here was am Mega light resolutions amen that Soul could not see he could not see him this was a blinding life his natural ey could not see through [Music] that but yet he was conscious that he had met a supernatural being hallelujah hallelujah praise God out of that light voice why do you s knew this is not a man this is God then he says who are you my Lord he says I'm Jesus whom you persecute he had gone back into that original step hallelujah hallelujah that's the kind of light he is oh praise the Lord and the impact of that lighted in the life of sa until an prayed for him to be brought back into the that as a light in Genesis John called him the word because when he came into that form that's where he stands let there be so that light that God was was associated with the word and John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God okay but the word then took a turn and put on a body which body we know as the Son of God he fails and then came down to us John 11:4 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the Glorious the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so the Virgin amen what he gave birth to was the covering was theing of God God was that superal he was veiled in that body we could only look at him look at the humility of God the people of this Earth you see the only thing that shows God is humility the men of this world they like to show Power if you are a journalist or if you are a common man and you say bad word about the man in power you are in trouble but what shows that Jesus was God he could stand and take control of the power and authority which he had he could have stood and speak away this entire world as the Pharisees SES you know called him all kinds of names called him but Power under control that is God and when time he decided to take John Peter and James to the mountain to show them who he was and then he transfigured himself meaning that he got those men to see beyond the V and they saw him in the glorified for that we shall have with him after we've been resurrected then they saw here Moses they saw here Elijah and then they saw him himself are you together with me and they were so astounded you me this is the one we always play around that was God so for us to Value ourselves as Son of God we need to understand amen the worth of the blood that redeemed you because you are as valuable as the blood is that's the price of your soul you are as valuable as the money that this Bible is as worth as the money that buys so your soul is as valuable as the blood of God himself we are talking about Val and sometimes people can get valuable things and they play around with them I want tell you this morning don't play around with your soul your soul is so expensive your soul was bought by God himself he had to sell his own blood to purchase you that's how valuable you are so your soul must be friend your soul must be brought to the house of God are you together with me and when your soul is bought redeemed then your soul will begin to testify of what it is by the things on the outside of it Hallelujah hallu your soul will testify I'm a lady I'm very expensive I'm not cheap to go around putting paint on myself Soul hallelujah hallelujah my value is on the inside as expensive as God himself you don't die for something cheap value Amen brother Bram now shows us and he says God came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the Holy Ghost and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built God came down in a blood cell amen not through a man because I came by the power of a man are you together with me but that's not how Jesus came God Who is the word spoke himself into blood into the womb of the vir can you imagine God coming down amen for the purpose of death the seed of the woman came in order that he he be bruised to bring our salvation when the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of Our Lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of God that's who Jesus is and that Holy One was filled with the Holy Blood even the blood of God that Tabernacle came in bir he grew to be a man he went to Jordan and there that sacrifice was washed of jining the River Jordan he was not baptized because he was a sinner but he was baptized because in the Old Testament the sacrifice had to be washed hallelujah hallelujah so that baptism was a washing of the sacrifice amen when that acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water came God came and him filling him with the spirit without Miss amen and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of God was liberated to came back upon the sinner who would accept Christ as his savior hallelujah hallelujah that life comes down for you and me so God created his own body by speaking a blood cell in the wom of a virgin and therefore the blood to that body is the blood of God himself he created himself a body and then he came and dwed it because this is the pattern God you know when he was uh before the foundation of the world before he even had anything created he had me in his mind are you together with me I was a thought in his man waiting for a time when I would come into natural B to fit in my position so God and man have always been together God allows man to come upon the Earth to take control of all the creation that would make and because God allowed man to come into a natural world he also allowed man to have a natural body so that the creation could look back to the Lord in some form of substance hallelujah hallelujah and after that when we fell the only one God could redeem us was him to come into this substance where we are and so he became body and blood so us to be able to redeem us he are to become our brother by a birth in a body hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God created his own Body by speaking a blood cell in the wom of a virgin and there for that blood amen is the blood of God himself and we are Redeemed by the blood of God hallelujah hallelujah that's the altimate value that you should be attached to your soul do you see what I'm saying your your your soul can only be computed into the value of the blood of God can you play with such a value are you together with me natural men when they have cars and they love their car they wouldn't want a child to play with natural things which pass away there is a soul on the inside of you God redeemed it by the cost of his own [Music] blood such value should not be sunk into garbage stuff amen saying that you are gambling gambling that value in the night club with such a value alcohol with such a value prostitution with such a value you should not Gamble that value it's ultimate value you were bought by the blood of God himself I take you to the book of Acts chapter 20 verse 28 if you knew the value you would always have time for God but because we don't understand the value we may not have time for the things of God Acts 20 verse 2 he says take he therefore unto yourselves Paul was speaking to the Elders of the church and all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood amen so the blood of God released the life of God to baptize us into the family of God as Sons and Daughters I thought somebody would say so my birth into the family by B of the Holy Ghost makes Christ become the first born among many brother because he's a Son of God is the firstborn he's my brother do you see the value that you now get to because of the blood you are elevated to a level of Brotherhood with the Lord Jesus Christ value let's talk about value Amen brother Bram says here he's one of us he's our King FK oh my he's my brother he's my savior he's my God he's my Kingsman Redeemer he's my all so what was there without him without what would you be without you see so you see he's my all he is standing there as our King folks and now he's been interceding for us till this time and now he comes forth to take the book of Redemption to claim his rights of what he did for us are you together with me yes sir that is him praise the Lord he so much protects you like we saw last time the names in the book you are so precious but do we attach that value back to the oh we are children you buy a kid a very nice little suit so that he can also appear as a gentleman and the next thing is playing in the D is that what we are do we attack value because our value can only be computed together with God nothing else can buy you praise the Lord amen he's doing that because you were in him before the foundation of the world you were Spirit of Spirit but when you stepped into flesh you were deceived by sin so you had to come in the same flesh where you sinned so that he could redeem you back amen so that you can become substance of his substance hallelujah hallelujah do you love him yes sir God values your soul listen to The Prophet here s good or bad death doesn't change it listen what is the soul it is you whatever you do is your soul are you together with me whatever you do is your soul so when you realize there is something that's not right that have come through my life you need to go back to the Fountain of blood and emphasize that I'm a Child of God by putting your sin under the blood that means you understand your value amen you are a soul the part inside of you and when you die ever what shape that so is it that's the way it goes It goes to its destination you pull it up no matter how much you don't you would that so is got to be changed here born again are you together with me so the soul is I in in a body and God has redeemed that soul and the S of an elect is over growing value before [Music] God are you together with me first of all it has got an eternal value but when it's redeem the it has a growing value praise the Lord that Soul has an interesting value of 10,000 walls but it still keeps gaining how does it gain value when you serve God your soul is gaining value amen yeah you remember the the talent the five talents the two talents amen well done and they were taken in Praise the Lord but then at the end of it there will be stars in our crowds there will be those that will glitter in the Kingdom growing value when you come down here and and you sing and you are singing from the heart you are attaching value when you testify you are attaching value When you pray for a brother you are attaching value we must keep attaching V to our soul amen keep attaching value amen get down on pray for the brothers for the sisters don't judge them have mercy upon them rest that's you are adding value when you take your time to be in a service like that God is adding Gams in your listen brother Bram says here you know old B [Music] Robinson B Robinson many of you has heard of him a nazarine church he said Lord give me backbone like a give me lots of knowledge in the G end of my [Applause] soul and let me fight the devil as long as I got one tooth and then him till I die I think that is good and that's just what he did that's just what he did nearly 100 years old I'm still preaching the gospel hallelujah hallelujah give me some strength to walk to church even when I don't have money hallelujah hallelujah that's when God will bless you yes sir because you see you are doing some for the kingom he bless you here and he'll give you gems in the Kingdom keep handing value praise God I hear them old veterans preaching like that the other day I happen to turn on the radio an old brother by the name of Modi around 100 years old still preaching the gospel I said God bless him and may he have stars in his crown when he gets there oh hallelujah hallelujah what are you asking James what are you asking James for for staying away from church God give me more GS for being B to the Brotherhood God give me more gems I know you're talking to yourself you are worth more gems as long as you are still alive make a decision realize value and ask God to give you strength from inherent value I mean from the iner [Music] Val so we can load more value by service Amen in the rest ation of character you are adding more value are you together with me when I'm better than yesterday that's value added to my soul amen your soul is of Great Value so valuable that it must never be loaded with the junk of sin because that saw that sin it shall listen here Mary Magdalene had to cry out the F of sin as her tears wash the Master's feet amen and the master said wherever this gospel shall be preached in the world there shall also this that this woman done be told for Memorial of her are you together with me she added value to the soul she went down on her knees wiped out all her B the thief on the cross cried for Redemption of his soul and the master say I say unto thee today sh thou be with me in Paradise heed value to we need to redeem that value at the feet of the Cross so Lord I was wasting the value of my soul I redeem my value praise the Lord Redeeming the soul and then God begins to pile value we need to redeem that value so what's the ultimate value for you to understand it you have your clothes you go and buy a shirt it is so beautiful and when you put it on there is a way you feel like you are you in the present and then after two years no how could you wear that suit of the people the things of this world they are falling value we attached to them but they pass away brother Bram tells a story of the 1926 old T he owned at the age of 16 or 17 and tells how he spent time every day polishing that polishing it and he had very great value for it he could turn aside look at it Gish it he attached Great Value to that car but when he was telling the story he was in his 40s at that time he wonders saying he would wonder if pieces of that car were brought to him now he wouldn't even want to drive it the things of this world the value Falls you have the money the value Falls you've invested in Friendship the value Falls that was now because it was not ultimate value anything that has value Falls brother then poses a question and he said what is value he posed the question he said what is value and that's the answer that we need to have he answers and says well after Sunday afternoon Sunday morning I would go down and sharpen all the bits and things for the air compressor and clean it up sunnd afternoon polish the it looked like a paint would almost come off what if I tried this morning to find one piece of that for what if I tried one of these bits of that air compressor the same time I could be winning Souls I was polishing my f i wonder where is value all these other things we have they could be things of value you could have a house it's of Great Value but there's only one that has ultimate value and that is your soul it is as expensive as God is you need to feed yourself you need to bring it into fell it is the only ultimate value of the things of the world brother the ultimate value but one so sa brother says you will see your name wrapped into it as long as the Morning Star shall glitter it so he say let us save Soul starting on your own give it regard give it time I can't be your T not your good house not your achievement praise the Lord they could be great but I want you to deal with timate which is your soul the value in Gold it perishes you go to a shop buy a car the moment you drive out you cannot get the same money you bought as long as you are out the god that perishes because it perishes by failure to maintain value and that's what people fight for is the money but it can't hold value because of money even Judas sold his soul and that man couldn't hold the value at the time of the challenge that man wouldn't meet his satisfaction he threw it away went and H him what is value answer it is my soul it is so Ultimate Gold perishes but the soul is an eternal value came from God cannot be killed in time on the way back to God that's the only thing that's times the test of time your soul listen the value in God perishes brother Bram says but there's a gold of God first Peter 1:7 the tri of your Faith being much more precious than of gold that pures the train of your faith is more precious than a billion Shillings given to you because this gold will perish we lose value but there is something Eternal when you uphold the value of your soul uphold that value tell your soul this way don't go I will not do that I don't I deny that my praise is the praise of God himself praise God the god of God is a Christlike character producing the fin of Affliction that is the right kind of God your character is a star in your crowd okay but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly God that will perish the church is rich is compl it has made the major Criterion of spirituality the evidence of God's blessing and the correctness of Doctrine is now based on how many folks are involved in it how many people in that church I don't go that one that one what is there they've lost the standard you had better come before it's too late says the Lord and by of me God tried in Fire and when you be truly rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it hallelujah hallelujah we've got a that gains value in service while we came naked naturally spiritually we shall not go naked hallelujah hallelujah we shall go loed with stars the soul keeps gaining value no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character amen amen hallelujah hallelujah rather that's what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was moded by suffering in fire amen or will it be the softness of this character AG it's up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own body learning to attach the value to the soul like a godes it God values your you know the Devil is a preacher of prosperity wealth Prosperity Gospel that's going to get even build a house are you together with me that's not a spiritual blessing because we are here we are conscious of what we ought to do that we must work and build a home care for the family amen buy a car but if that becomes the promise that makes you a child of God the devil's gopel I see you in one year you are driving he already so he knows in that year I think the brother will buy a you see the Devil is a preacher of prosperity and wealth and health is the backbone of his [Music] gospel theil would glorify the rich man over Lazarus saying Lazarus you are a man of God and the dogs are leaking your when he looks at the rich Manus great home wonderful Farms one time he came to a point of saying now I've bu the G I have got a great Yi let me just have and put in the [Music] G and rest that's how stupid he was he computed his wealth to being spiritual and God called him a fool you fo your soul will be needed today so the devil you know he believes that people come to church for two things health and wealth he doesn't know that people come to church for the welfare of their soul and when the soul prospers the blessing comes down to the body the wealth comes the healing comes you don't have to meas them and you take away the people's concern for the soul and they care for which God will certainly give to them so we had a church that was going on way back even before Moses that was the Church of job job lived before all the prophets job lived before all Moses leave because after Moses every book of the Bible which was written Moses was quoted but not job he lived before Moses so there was a church service in Job 1 verse the devil came around walking back and forth and God was asking Satan what his interest was in the service then Satan answered the Lord you know first of all he says I'm just from up and walking up and down the is not specific and down but you've got your week planned W night church Sunday morning church and Sunday evening we've got the Lord's Supper you've got your days properly planned out but the devil wakes up without a plan then God asks him I know what you are looking for have you considered my servant J who is upright excuse for and nobody's like him listen to the Prosperity Gospel verse then Satan answered the Lord and say does job fear God for nothing has not Thou made a h about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side have you not bless the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he has and he will cast thee on the first that's the preach of prosperity and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he has is in thy only upon [Music] himself so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord this upon himself upon himself refers to the most valuable which is the soul of job Satan tamper with all that job has but he has something very valuable don't touch that song God do you care for your soul said the devil came and bat down the we and job was not moved again he came into the next sometimes we must be very careful I don't know why I'm thinking the thinking you know the devil doesn't work without a to use so if you don't come for the benefit of your soul I'm afraid you might be giving opportunity to the enemy to use you then after that you are the one saying you think those people are faithful for nothing look at the jobs they have but for me they for us tell us look the houses they have for us they tell us did you hear that then the next service see the devil came in job 2 verse 4 Satan answered and said for skin all that a man has will give for his life but put th hand now and touch his B and his flesh and On th face the Lord said unto Satan he in th hand save his life don't tamper with the area where R is life he has no right your soul until you move out of the blood when you move and cross the line he will be right there God will build a bounding value in the soul that is surrendered to God character buil in the soul will manifest on the outside are you together with me it has to be a growing glory is inherent Glory but it has to be grory praise God as you know on your faith upon your virtue the glory is growing yes sir upon your knowledge are then the value of your soul is growing amen you begin to Bear the fruit of his presence you are adding to the value of your soul when you come to church you have to be born by the spirit of God then by the life that's on the vine growing through the branch you'll be able to bring forth the fruit of his presence yes sir youing value and when you walk [Music] around ever since he got saved he has never gone back he was a very drunk but now look at he home they counting value they counting your blessing are you like that will the people start counting your blessings they see them hallelujah hallelujah because the soul is prospering the people can see the value amen yes sir so one of these days you are going to phas into the glory himself amen so I want to finish on this not I love him this morning he's been so good talking about you are not cheap you are a great value before God nothing can buy you Ephesians verse you are accepted in the Beloved I'm trying to make you understand who you are value that you are having predestinated us un the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved amen so you are you know you are being accepted in the Beloved God numbers you as a part of his own you are accepted in the Beloved you are not cheap you are very expensive God says this soul is mine and I'm going to protect it in the trials I Pro protect my soul in sickness I protect my soul Amen brother says and as long as you accepted in the Beloved how can God bring you into judgment he already judged Christ in your how could you have to suffer for your sins when Christ has already done are you together with me because you put your sins down the enemy should not lie you you are going to be judged for the sins that you've been forgiven and you already accepted in the Beloved are you together with me do you see why am might I'm taking you yes sir praise the Lord in Ephesians 2 verse 5 he says even when we were dead in sins has weaken us together with Christ by grace are you sa and has raised us up together with him and has made us together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah sometimes when you are dedicated there is a time you feel like you don't live here yes sir you always feel like you belong somewhere you are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah that is who you are you are elevated you are taken up you don't belong here sometimes you lift up your heart and then you feel like you are not praying from this here you are praying from a certain angle that's who you are very valuable before God and I'm telling you friends begin to realize who you are and maintain the value in first John 4 verse 17 here is our love that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so our win this world if we have not changed in the body form but as he is so are we praise the lord we of Great Value and we are looking now to facing us to what he is beloved now are we the sons of God and has not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is hallelujah hallelujah we have been redeemed taken on a journey to the extent that even this which die will be changed and we shall be like him look at that we shall come to the image the person and substance of our value that's the Lord God himself God bless you God bless you turn around tell brother that we are all very great we are of very great value and we all live a life where we maintain the value which God has given to us because he working on us to take us to the Ultimate Image and the Ultimate Image finally we shall be as it is and at that spot the devil will not have any way to deal with you God bless you amen amen yes sir ultimate value is the soul instead of it losing value it keeps gain Val in service ship in Praise when we come to church everything we are getting crowns Mees in our God [Applause] bless amen we get on our feet what will you give in exchange for your soul amen amen
